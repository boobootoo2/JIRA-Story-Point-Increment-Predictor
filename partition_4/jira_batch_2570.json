That way, the user knows that the bug has been fixed, and will probably show up in the next version, but there&#x27;s nothing to download yet.\n\nThis means that \"resolved\" should be what you use when a bug is fixed and shipping in a distribution.",

      "description": "So I have an account \"runhello\". I have a private repository on bitbucket, let&#x27;s call it SERVERSOFT; there is web software in here that I would like to be able to deploy to a server, so to do this while limiting security risk I created a separate account \"mcc_deployer\" (I&#x27;m assuming that&#x27;s OK) and granted it readonly access to the repository. I then attempted to check out SERVERSOFT on the server. Here is what I found:\n\nI can successfully:\n\n* Check out SERVERSOFT, from the mcc_deployer account, using hg.\n* Check out SERVERSOFT, from the runhello account, using svn [and also of course using hg].\n* Check out a public repository created by runhello, anonymously, using svn.\n\nHowever, if I try to check out SERVERSOFT, from the mcc_deployer account, using svn, this fails. I try:\n\nsvn co --username mcc_deployer https://bitbucket.org/runhello/SERVERSOFT/trunk/server\n\nIt prompts me for my password several times, then prints:\n\nsvn: PROPFIND request failed on &#x27;/runhello/SERVERSOFT/trunk/server&#x27;\\\\\nsvn: PROPFIND of &#x27;/runhello/SERVERSOFT/trunk/server&#x27;: authorization failed (https://bitbucket.org)\n\nWondering if I&#x27;d misunderstood the documentation (http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/BITBUCKET/Accessing+your+Bitbucket+Repository+via+Subversion) I then tried:\n\nsvn co --username mcc_deployer https://bitbucket.org/mcc_deployer/SERVERSOFT/trunk/server\n\nWithout even asking for a password, it immediately printed:\n\nsvn: PROPFIND request failed on &#x27;/mcc_deployer&#x27;\\\\\nsvn: PROPFIND of &#x27;/mcc_deployer&#x27;: 200 OK (https://bitbucket.org)\n\nI realize the svn bridge is beta, however, this seems like some sort of oversight.

(e.g, translation, sysadmin, developer, designer, etc ...) This will allow contributors to *browse projects that need people with specific skills* and thus eases the process of finding a _good_ project to join.\n\nI would love to read your feedback on this suggestion.\n\nRegards,\n\nAmine",

Some other people are using the repository now to do work and I&#x27;m not involved in that work but I still receive all the notifications for new issues, etc. which do not interest me.\n\nFrom what I could understand, the only ways for me not to receive these notifications is either to remove myself from the repository (and then I&#x27;ll have to be added again when I take part in another sprint), or globally disable all email notification in my account preferences (but then I will lose other notifications that I do want, like replies to a bug report I filed in a project that uses bitbucket, etc.). What would solve this problem perfectly for me would be the ability to disable email notifications per repository.\n\nThanks for reading,\n\nChristian",

However I noticed one limitation.\n\nIf you attempt to svn commit to bitbucket after performing the \"svn cp\" command (or \"svn copy\", or for that matter \"svn move\") you will get this error message:\n\nsvn: Server sent unexpected return value (405 METHOD NOT ALLOWED) in response to COPY request for &#x27;/runhello/hgtest/!svn/bc/3/trunk/dir1&#x27;\n\nAlthough this does not actually prevent use of the bridge (because it is possible to just manually copy and then svn add the item to be copied), it seems unfortunate because there _is_ a copy primitive in hg so it seems like it shouldn&#x27;t be hard to tweak your script to translate svn COPY to hg copy.",
