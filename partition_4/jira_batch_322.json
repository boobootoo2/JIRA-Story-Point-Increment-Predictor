      "description": "h3. Summary\r\nThis Bug is Cloned from the server version of this BUG JPOSERVER-2703,  With slight differences in the Epic issue type behavior.\r\n\r\nWhen you are creating an issue in an epic the option for initiative hierarchy levels (the level above an epic per portfolio hierarchy configurations) is also listed in the create dialogue as an option to be created as the level below the epic, as the Initiative can be mapped to the Epic as the parent, in turn could lead to additional errors such as a related Server platform BUG [JPOSERVER-2691|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JPOSERVER-2691] (Which currently only affects the Server version of the application at this time and not known to affect the cloud version) as a conflict occurs because the initiative cannot be both the parent and child of an Epic at the same time, but similar behavior could occur, and the mapping should not be possible.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# make sure a hierarchical level above epic exists (initiative)\r\n# Navigate to an existing Epic\r\n# Use the \"Create issue in epic\" option\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nOnly standard issue types that are not mapped to an initiative hierarchy are listed in the issue type field. \r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nThe Initiative issue types are listed as avaliable issue types, and the Initiative can be selected and created as a child of the Epic\r\n \r\nh3. Notes\r\nAs the Initiative is considered a standard issue type but mapped to the higher hierarchy levels by portfolio the mappings would be possible if Portfolio was disabled, so an additional Expectation could be that a warning or error would occur when a initiative issue type is selected noting the issue types are invalid because of hierarchy configurations\r\n\r\nh3.Workaround\r\nYou can use the following JQL to identify issue in this state:\r\n{code}\r\nissuetype = \"initiative\"  AND \"Epic Link\" is not EMPTY \r\n{code}\r\nperform Bulk Update to remove the Epic link",

This is the expected behaviour. Subsequently importing this file uses the System File Encoding. This introduces a problem with some characters in various encodings as the characters become corrupt. \n\n\nh3. Environment\nJIRA 6.4.12, \nJIRA Portfolio 1.10.4\n\n\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\n# Set a JIRA environment up to use: {{-Dfile.encoding=cp1252\"}} encoding.\n# Create a Plan which includes characters which vary in encoding. \n# Export this plan. \n# Confirm the plan opens as a UTF-8 Encoded file using a text editor. \n# Import the plan. \n# Observe the characters become corrupt. JIRA Portfolio has treated the file as a 'cp1252 encoded file. \n\n\nh3. Expected Results\nJIRA Portfolio should treat the file as a UTF-8 file on import and export. \n\n\nh3. Actual Results\nJIRA Portfolio corrupts some characters, when the system file encoding is not  UTF-8. \nFor Example: \n{code}\n\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4f8b\u5b50\n{code}\n\nBecomes:\n{code}\n\u00e8\u00bf\u2122\u00e6\u02dc\u00af\u00e4\u00b8\u20ac\u00e4\u00b8\u00aa\u00e4\u00be\u2039\u00e5\u00ad\u0090\n{code}\n\n\nh3. Workaround\nSet the File Encoding to UTF-8 in JIRA. \nThis can be done by adding the property {{-Dfile.encoding=utf-8\"}}: by following the instructions in: [Setting Properties and options on startup|https://confluence.atlassian.com/jira/setting-properties-and-options-on-startup-120007.html]. \n\nNote: This will not fix existing corrupted plan templates, that have been previously imported/exported and contain corrupted characters when accessed with a text editor using UTF-8 encoding.

      "description": "{panel:bgColor=#e7f4fa}\n  *NOTE:* This bug report is for *JIRA Portfolio Cloud*. Using *JIRA Portfolio Server*? [See the corresponding bug report|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JPOSERVER-1381].\n  {panel}\n\nI had previously imported issues (Epics, Stories and Tasks) from a live project into a \"Sandpit\" project in our Jira Cloud instance. These were given new issue names on the import so that they are completely separate from the project that they were imported from (SAN-1, SAN-2 etc).\n\nBefore trying Jira Portfolio Labs, I had previously added a new Issue Type called \"Initiative\" and associated it with the Sandpit project.\n\nWhen subsequently trying out Jira Portfolio Labs and setting up a plan to import the issues from the Sandpit project, everything appeared to work ok and epics, stories and tasks were imported. There were, of course, no initiatives in the project at this point.\n\nPortfolio Labs was configured to allow Initiatives in the Scope. When attempting to create new initiatives, this worked correctly. However, when trying to commit the changes back to Jira using \"Review and commit changes\" in Jira Portfolio Labs, the following exception occurred:\n\nLinked Applications\nJIRA\nDashboards\nProjects\nIssues\nTempo\nBoards\nPortfolio\nTests\n Create\n\nSearch\nHelp\nAdministration\nUser profile for Gary Bates\n\nScope\n\nTeams\n\nReleases\nUntitled plan\n2Uncommitted changes\nGive feedback\nRecalculate\nProjects: All\nReleases: All\nTeams: All\n\nContains text\n\nMore\n \nThere is no iniative in the current result set.\n08/Apr/16 - Start11/Apr/16 - Later\nScope\n\nIniative\nTitle\nReleases\nEstimates (h)\nProgress\nSAN\nLiving Well\nSAN\nAgeing Well\nIssues without parent Iniative\nLater\n40.51\nCreate Iniative\nReview and commit changes\n2 changescouldn't be committed to JIRA.

Summary\n\nWhen a JIRA Portfolio Plan is connected to an existing project where, in order to create an issue, the following fields are *Required* under that Project's Field Configuration:\n\n* *Description* field\n* Another field, such as a test custom field\n\nWhen committing a change, such as a new Epic/Story/etc., the Set Required Fields Screen will be brought up so that the user may populate that other required field. In the process, the *Description* field is also brought up but it does not retain the description that may have been added in Portfolio.\n\n\n\nThe issue cannot be created without the user repopulating the Description again since it is a required field.\n\nh3. Environment\n* JIRA 7.1.6\n* Portfolio 2.0.6\n\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\n\n# Create a new project\n# Create a new custom field (e.g. \"Test\", which is a Single Line Text Field)\n# Configure the project's field configuration so that *Description* and *Test* are +Required+\n# Create a new plan and associate it with this project\n# Create a new Epic and give it a description in Portfolio\n# Commit the change\n\nAt this point, you will find that the issue isn't automatically created since the user needs to populate *Test*. *Description* will be blank. Cannot proceed with creating the issue until *Description* is populated again.\n\nh3. Expected Results\n\nDescription should be retained from Portfolio into the Set Required Fields screen during the commit. Completing the commit should create the issue with the Description.\n\nh3. Actual Results\nDescription is not retained in the Set Required Fields screen during the commit.\n \nh3.Workaround\nEither:\n\n1. Repopulate the description at the Set Required Fields screen\nor\n2.
