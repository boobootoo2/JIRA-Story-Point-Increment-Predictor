There are 2 users with the same e-mail in that Active Directory, where one of the users has JSD permissions and the other does not. When I try to add as participant the user that has permissions from the Customer Portal \"Add People\" function, I write his name, which is found, but when adding it it says \"Error, cannot add this e-mail .....\". If I add him as participant from within the issue in JSD backend, it works. The problem seem to be that Jira Service Desk is looking by e-mail when adding from the Customer Portal and finds the other user, which does not have permissions, although his username is different than what I write in the text box. When I changed the e-mail of the other user, I can add the user that has permissions without a problem.",

Summary\r\nWhen a JIRA Delegated Authentication Directory is used, and is 'higher' then an Internal JIRA Directory Server, when JIRA Service Desk Attempts to create users, they will be created as users in The JIRA Delegated Authentication Directory by default.\r\n\r\nAs ServiceDesk users are unlikely to exist in the Delegated LDAP Directory, this results in users who were created in JIRA ServiceDesk (either manually or by public signup) from authenticating with JIRA Service Desk.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Create a JIRA Delegated Authentication Directory, and ensure it is the top directory in the order of User Directories.\r\n# Create a JIRA Service Desk Agent or User from JIRA Service Desk. \r\n#- Note: you will be unable to supply a password for this user.\r\n# Observe in your User Management that this user has been created in the Delegated Authentication Directory\r\n# Your user will be asked to set their password, but this will fail with the error:\r\n{code}\r\n2015-01-01 01:01:01,042 http-bio-8080-exec-42 ERROR anonymous 111x111x1 - 192.168.0.1 /servicedesk/customer/portal/1/user/setpassword [feature.customer.user.SetPasswordManager] Exception occurred whilst resetting password ' : Passwords are stored in LDAP and are read-only for delegated authentication directory'\r\n{code}\r\n# As No entry exists for the customer in the LDAP Directory, the user is unable to log in.\r\n\r\nh3.

Actual Results\r\nAs per the reproduction steps, JIRA ServiceDesk defaults to the Delegated Authentication Directory when it is the highest in the order of User Directories. \r\n\r\nThis prevents new users that are created, from logging in. \r\n\r\nh3.

Problem Definition\r\nSome request types might require being handled in an external system but the Customer Portal can't be setup to provide a link to another system in lieu of raising the request in JIRA. \r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\nAllow for a *Request Type* to be defined that displays information or a link to an external system, but can't be used to create requests in JIRA. \r\n\r\nh3. Why this is important\r\nFor example, one Help Desk in an organization us using JIRA Service Desk, but another group in the organization may intake requests using another tool.  \r\n\r\nh3. Workaround \r\nRegardless of which Workaround you ultimately try to use, there are two places built in that you can provide a link to your Customers using standard JIRA markup.  These are:\r\n# The Request Type *Description*\r\n# In the *Help and instructions* section for the Request Type, edited by clicking on the \"Edit Fields\" link once the Request Type has been created.\r\n\r\nh4. Workflow Restriction\r\nTo prevent Requests from being created in the first place, you can create a Request Type using an Issue Type associated with a simplified Workflow with a Validator strict enough to prevent the Request from being created.  \r\n\r\nFor example: A *Permission Validator* requiring *Administer Projects* will result in \"Only users with *Administer Projects* permission can execute this transition.\"\r\n\r\nIn the Customer Portal, if a normal Customer clicks on *Create* for the associated *Request Type*, they'll receive: {quote}*Error*\r\n\r\nUser '<username>' doesn't have the 'Administer Projects' permission{quote}\r\nh4. Automation Rule\r\nThis approach doesn't prevent the creation of Requests but instead provides a way to automatically handle them while referring Customers to the correct channels.  \r\nIn short, create Automation Rule roughly matching:\r\n- *WHEN*: Issue Created\r\n- *IF*: Issue matches a specific *Customer Request Type*\r\n- *THEN*: \r\n-- Add a comment: {code}Please use [some other system|http://external-link.example.com] to raise this issue{code}\r\n-- Transition issue: Close Ticket\r\n\r\n-----\r\nh6. Original Description\r\n{quote}We have a need for some request types that rely on external systems to be created within the external system.  In order to accommodate those, I can currently create a custom field that displays the required information directing the user elsewhere, but in that case, the 'Create' button still exists.\r\n\r\nI would like to be able to create request types that display a message, but do not allow for issue submission.\r\n\r\nDisplaying a given knowledge base article for an issue type would also be a possibility.{quote}",

      "description": "Was evaluating JIRA ServiceDesk with JIRA Agile integration when got a NullPointerException when trying to open Customer Portal in Service Desk. Reinstallation of any of the plugins does not solve the issue.\r\n\r\nNot sure about steps to reproduce, but will try to describe what I did:\r\n1. Installed JIRA in a custom folder \"c:\\Atlassian\\Jira\". Instance directory was specified as \"c:\\Atlassian\\Application Data\\Jira\".\r\n2. Configured JIRA for Service Desk demo.\r\n3. Created an issue as a customer, then closed it.\r\n4. Created a custom issue type but haven't linked it to Service Desk.\r\n5. Installed JIRA Agile, created a board and linked it to same project as Service Desk (\"Welcome to Service Desk\").\r\n\r\nResult: Customer Portal page from Service Desk is not opening anymore.\r\n\r\nFull exception details below:\r\n{noformat}\r\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"

Since Customer does not have access to JIRA, the attachment can't be accessed.

Lets face it, most big companies these days strive to base their processes around ITIL methodology, the last 3 I have been involved with have anyway (3000 employees, 73000 and 300).\r\n\r\nThis is the first time I have come across JIRA and as a Service Desk Manager find it quite limiting. While I understand this tool is fundamentally based around Agile PM, Service Desk functionality is very cumbersome and limiting.\r\n\r\nI know SD is only in its early stages, I just hope this gets addressed as automating process for standard changes and incidents etc should be standard in almost any service desk product.\r\n\r\nWhy is it important?\r\n\r\nIf I have a standardised task which does not change and follows the same path of implementation every time, I should be able to use a workflow to automate that entire process. Tasks we have should auto generate upon specific status changes or assignment or closure of other tickets.\r\nAssigning to multiple \"assignees\" is wasteful and creates too many overheads around future administration. ie. if one person leaves, you now have to update that workflow or any other workflow that person was a part of. If it was a group, then you have nothing to do whatsoever except update the one group.\r\n\r\nThe only solution for this is to allow the assignment of issues to groups.\r\n\r\nRight now, we have to manually create every single ticket, monitor queues etc. Wasting my technical resources time that could be better spent on improving processes for our customers.",

This workaround will schedule a consistency task between 30 seconds - 2 minutes of the workflow transition rule executing. If the reindex initially may have got the queues into an inconsistent state, this task will reload the issue from database and index again.\r\n\r\nHowever, the real fix will be available from JIRA 7.0.0 (JSD 3.0.0) where on every reindex, the issue will be reloaded before indexing, to prevent these inconsistencies occurring at all.\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\nI have a Service Desk workflow that is triggering transitions when the issue is commented upon (similar to the default Service Desk workflow).

Having this permission allows agents to create issues through the JIRA channel using the Create Issue function in JIRA. \r\n* If these permissions are not present an error will appear like discussed [here | https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/SERVICEDESK/Resolving+permission+scheme+errors]\r\n* Removing these permissions does not prevent agents from creating issues in the portal or through the email channel. \r\n\r\nAs an admin, I may need to give some users Create Issue permission but do not want these users to be able to create issues in the Service Desk project using the Create Issue function in JIRA. I need to be able to give some users this permission so that issues can be created using, for example:\r\n* API\r\n* Issue collectors\r\n* Regular JIRA mail handlers\r\n* Add-ons\r\n",

[See the corresponding bug report|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSDCLOUD-1726].\n  {panel}\n\n*Summary:*\r\nBased on this [documentation|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/Cloud/Getting+started+for+service+desk+agents#Gettingstartedforservicedeskagents-Workoncustomerissues], it shows that it's possible to add attachment by copying the link from Agent view:\r\n{quote}\r\nTo ensure that the customer sees the attachment, right click on the attachment to copy link address and paste the link into a comment surrounded by square brackets as follows: [description of attachment|attachment link]. Click preview to confirm the attachment link has copied correctly: \r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nWhen users copy the link, the URL will be {{https://<instance-name>/secure/attachment/10200/test.pdf}} instead of {{https://<instance-name>/servicedesk/customershim/secure/attachment/10200/10200_test.pdf}}. Since Customer does not have access to JIRA, the attachment can't be accessed.\r\n\r\n*Steps to reproduce:*\r\n# Customer create a new issue\r\n# Agent adds an attachment and right click to copy the attachment link\r\n# The URL will be {{https://<instance-name>/secure/attachment/10200/test.pdf}}\r\n# Agent adds the attachment using this format[description of attachment|attachment link]\r\n\r\n*Expected Result:*\r\n- Customer should be able to access it without having JIRA application access\r\n\r\n*Current Result:*\r\n- Customer is not able to access it\r\n\r\n*Workaround:*\r\n- -Use this format [ ^description.ext ] to add the attachment-\r\n\r\n- The workaround above no longer works as even when linking the files in the chat; the file is pointing to  {{https://<instance-name>/secure/attachment/10200/test.pdf}} (JIRA) and no longer point to Service Desk. For now if the customer wants to directly access the attachments; the agent have to manually provide the Service Desk URL instead; which is {{https://<instance-name>/servicedesk/customershim/secure/attachment/<ATTACHMENT_ID>/<ATTACHMENT_ID>_<FILE_NAME>}}",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSDCLOUD-1725].\r\n  {panel}\r\n\r\nCurrently, we could configure JIRA Service Desk SLA goals based on the JQL and the Calendar to take the Working Hours information. While this could be used for goals that is specific to Priority or the details about the issue, it does not support SLA goals that is based on time. There some users that is set the SLA Goals based on the time when it is created, in which the SLA will adapt when it is passed a specific hours. While currently we could specify multiple goals for the same JQL filter, JIRA Service Desk will refer to the most top goals if it were the same. Not to include when the SLA is passed the working hours, it would stop until the next day.\r\n\r\nFor example about the SLA that is based on time:\r\nbq. When a ticket is created at 17:50 the time starts to count towards the 2 hour goal until 18:00. Then at 18:00 the working hours stop and the goal is set to 3 hours with 10 minutes already subtracted from that and the time continues on counting towards the 3 hours goal.\r\n\r\nHence, it would be great if JIRA Service Desk to have an option to make goals moved or continue to a different calendar based on the time.\r\n\r\nh5. Update:\r\n\r\nIf a user has 2 calendars and an issue is worked on in one calendar and transfered to another calendar, if the work was done before the working hours of the calendar, the amount of SLA already expended is not carried over.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n# Create 2 calendars (9-5) say one for GMT+8 and another for GMT-5.\r\n# Create a select list custom field TimeZone with values (America) and (APAC) accordingly.\r\n# Add the field to the Create, View and Edit Issue screen of your Service Desk project.\r\n# Create SLA goals with for example {{request type = \"Service Request\" and TimeZone = America}}.\r\n# Use the GMT-5 Calendar for the America based goals and repeat similar for APAC.\r\n# Create an issue and Select a specific timezone say APAC which matches the issue type of the goal.\r\n# Note the time.\r\n# Transition the issue so that the SLA is met or time is consumed from it.\r\n# Change the TimeZone field to America.\r\n\r\nh5. Customer Expectation\r\n\r\nThe Consumed time is accounted for following this change.\r\n\r\nh5. Actual Result\r\n\r\nJIRA going by working calendar would not count anytime consumed from earlier SLA if the working time does not fall within the working time of the new calendar.",

We are aware that this is important and understand that the account activation email is causing confusion for your customers.\u00a0\r\n\r\nWelcome emails are instance wide and span across multiple projects, which is why modifying them is challenging. We are now exploring the possibility of suppressing these emails and building a new flow for users to activate accounts.\r\n\r\nOnce again, thanks for voicing your concerns and stay tuned for future updates.\u00a0\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nJIRA Service Desk Team\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n----\r\nh3. Problem Definition\r\n\r\nDue to reduce the number of communication between JIRA and users, some administrators would like to disable the Welcome messages\r\n * Welcome messages are also referred to as \"Activate Your Account\" emails\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nAdd the new customer welcome message as a notification type that can be edited within the notification scheme.\r\nh3. Example Use Case\r\n\r\n\"We are running into a problem with JIRA service desk whereby we need to allow for open customer enrollment, but we do not support a portal site and do not want to link customers to that site in their update emails. The entire Welcome email is entirely unnecessary for this reason, and while we can use the default JIRA notifications as a way to update customers, we would like to be able to just change the outgoing emails from Service Desk the same as with JIRA notifications. \"",

When a customer creates an issue of the defined issuetype, the customer doesn't see the issue in his list of issues (the counter has not changed).\r\n\r\nI've created a new jira-project and made the issuetype I allready defined available in the new project. When the customer creates an issue (of the same issuetype) in the new project, the issue is added to the customers list of issues (the counter is changed by 1).\r\n\r\nDo you have any idea what the problem might be? Does it have something to do with the fact that my first project was created before I installed and configured the service desk module?\r\n\r\nWith kind regards,\r\nNiels Koreman",

Request\r\nAs a JIRA Service Desk customer I'd like to have a better formatting for Wiki Markup, such as for Code Blocks, No Format, Panels or tables\r\n\r\nh4.

Suggestion\r\nAllow more space for the comments column and decrease the font size, as well as making noformat scrollable and improving the spacing and padding in code blocks and panels.
