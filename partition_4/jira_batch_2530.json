Organizing these repositories is a chore. As an agency user having hundreds of repositories is expected. A way of tagging repositories would help solve this problem. Currently my Team has 55 repositories. We are naming them in such ways as [wordpress] [theme] newproject.com or [custom] [platform] projectname.\n\nThis is currently allowing us to filter the projects using existing methods within the system and finding types of projects such as codebases or libraries is easy through the user dashboard.\n\nThe downside is that this leads to bloated repository names and frequent renaming of repositories.\n\nRequest: Add tagging to repositories. A user would go into a repository and have a box somewhere on the screen that would allow for comma separated tags.\n\nThe request is minor at this time, but as we proceed throughout the year, 200 repositories is a reality we expect to have to deal with. Then searching through them will be cumbersome and may require elevation.\n\nThanks for your time!",

      "description": "We are using a topic branch workflow where members of our team push topic branches to allow passive review. Unmerged topic branches may be modified and updated (non-ff) before being merged to {{next}} (either directly or via pull request) and later graduating to {{master}}. Usually topic branches are deleted after graduating to {{master}}. After a release, {{next}} is rewound to pick up any topic branches that didn&#x27;t make the release. This workflow is pretty simple for our team and gives us a convenient display of everything being worked on, even before creating PRs.\n\nhttps://bitbucket.org/petsc/petsc/commits/featurebranches\n\nThe problem is that forks include all branches by default, which become outdated when upstream deletes them or non-ff pushes them. I would like to restrict forks to only include the branches that are intended to fast-forward ({{maint}} and {{master}}).\n\nNote that this branch proliferation isn&#x27;t a problem when cloning via the git client because {{git fetch --prune}} cleans up.",
