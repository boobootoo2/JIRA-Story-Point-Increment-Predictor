After comparing this bug request against the known bug report [JSDSERVER\\-5786: Service Desk customer sign up/password reset page does not indicate if the password does not meet the password policy requirements|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSDSERVER-5786] we realized that both are addressing the same error with a slightly different scenario which is during account creation. We will be closing this request now and will ask you to cast your votes and add any additional feedback so we can have the impact of this issue gathered in one single request.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nAmirul\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\nh3. Summary\r\n\r\nService Desk customer sign up page does not indicate why account cannot be created\r\n\r\nh3. Environment\r\n * Jira Service Desk 3.12.1\r\n * Jira is using a read-only LDAP directory in the top ordered position\r\n * Jira Service Desk does have public sign up enabled, both for the system and for this project.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# As a new JSD customer, go to the login page http://localhost:8791/servicedesk/customer/portal/1/user/login?destination=portal%2F1\r\n# click the \"Sign up for an Account\" link  http://localhost:8791/servicedesk/customer/portal/1/user/signup\r\n# Enter in email address, password, and full name, then click 'Sign Up'\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results (end user)\r\nAccount should be created\r\nOR\r\nA clear error message needs to be displayed to the end user to explain why account was not created.\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results (end user)\r\n* Nothing happens on the page\r\n* User is not able to create an account\r\n* only by looking into the browser's console when trying to click the signup button, is there an error generated such as:  {code:borderStyle=solid}\r\n{\"errors\":[],\"reasonKey\":\"Signup is not currently available\",\"reasonCode\":\"400\"} \r\n{code}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Notes\r\nWe need to be more communicative with the end user to explain why they cannot create an account right now.   If this is a JSD specific setting preventing this, then the error message displayed on the screen should say so.   If it is a problem that stems from the Jira server settings like in this case, then the error message displayed should convey this detail.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nThe Jira administrator will have to\r\n* Change the order of the user directories so that the read-only directory is not in the top/first position\r\n",

Environment\r\n* JSD 3.12.0\r\n* [Issue Picker for Jira|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/de.catworkx.jira.plugins.cwx-issue-picker/server/overview]\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Install [Issue Picker for Jira|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/de.catworkx.jira.plugins.cwx-issue-picker/server/overview] plugin\r\n# Create and configure an Issue Picker custom field as a single select. We can use JQL resolution is empty to get all issue or any other JQL as long as it displays a list of issues.\r\n# Add the field to JSD screen.\r\n# Visit one of the issues via view issue page in JIRA.\r\n# Now try to use inline edit.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nThe field can be edited as the option to select the list in the field is available in the drop down.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nOnce we click inline edit and choose a new value the details are not saved\r\n \r\nh3. Notes\r\nThe developer for the plugin have tested the behavior and shared with us on their insight.\r\n\r\n# Current design code in service desk seems like disabling the inline edit as shown below{code}\r\nJIRA.bind(JIRA.Events.INLINE_EDIT_BLURRED, function() { AJS.log('blurred...'); console.trace(); });\r\n{code}\r\n# As soon as you try to open the select box in inline edit mode, the event is fired and inline edit mode is cancelled.\r\nThe stacktrace shows that the minified JS of Jira Service Desk is what fires the event. The offending module is:\r\n/* module-key = 'com.atlassian.servicedesk.frontend-webpack-plugin:context-jira.view.issue', location = 'jira.view.issue.bundle.js' */\r\n\r\nh3. *Possible Solution*\r\nMake sure only select2 fields with certain data- fields or CSS classes are used, so that JSD doesn't cancel editing for other fields. (courtesy of the plugin vendor)\r\n\r\nh3.Workaround\r\nCurrently, to edit the value of the field instead of using inline edit, users can use the edit button available in view issue page.",
