      "description": "Hi,\n\nI realize that as a primarily social coding site, Bitbucket needs to make its entire list of users available (as in issue 6278) in user selections.\n\nHowever as a primarily private/team user it would be helpful to myself and my team if there was some way to enable the user auto complete listings in BB to at least \"prefer\" the members of the team and/or list them ahead of other suggested users.  Right now for some of our team users, I need to practically type their entire name before they even show up in the autocomplete list.\n\nThis is particularly annoying for the access management screens in our team account when I essentially would always be adding only members of our team (yes we can use groups but there are times when it is easier to add individual users)\n\nAt the very least it would be nice if this was an option in the team account itself.  Maybe that would make it a little easier to implement?\n\nThanks and let me know if I need to provide more info/detail about what I&#x27;m looking for.",

This doesn&#x27;t make much sense to me...\n\nI tried adding my other projects as submodules to my bitbucket hosted site/repo, but this didn&#x27;t seem to work when I clicked a link pointing to a submodules&#x27; index.html file (ie: myusername.bitbucket.org/projectX/index.html).\n\nPerhaps, I&#x27;m missing something simple. Perhaps it an enhancement that Bitbucket could add.\n\nThoughts?",

I get a \"500 Something went wrong\" page with debug id: 9567b3e548db40eab5979a01410b2cce.\n\nRecently, i created a second user and fixed ssh-keys according to: https://confluence.atlassian.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=271943168.\n\nMy ~/.ssh/config defines one alias for the second username and points to the second ssh identity.\n\nSo for the repositories the belong to the second user, i use git@ALIAS instead of git@bitbucket.org and this is working ok.\n\nFor the repositories that belong to the first user, i use the standard git@bitbucket.org.... url but still i can see from the notification emails, that commits are from the second username.\n\nEach user contains the appropriate ssh-keys. User1 has ssh-key1 configured and User2 has key2. So even if something wrong happened locally, bitbucket shouldn&#x27;t accept my commits to a repo that the user doesn&#x27;t have permissions.\n\nI think thats the reason the repository i mention earlier is not working.\n\nThanks\\\\\nGeorge",

      "description": "Currently with the v 2.0 API the only way to get a list of files modified within a pullrequest is to obtain the associated {{patch}} sub-resource and extract file names from the diff statements (via grep/regex etc). For example:\n\n# Query the API: {{https://bitbucket.org/api/2.0/repositories/pypy/pypy/pullrequests/150/patch}}\n# Iterate over the content returned, searching for lines starting with &#x27;diff&#x27; e.g. {{diff -r 388909aea9514189bb4d9f9d3bc146891ec0c4b1 -r f7dffcd98d3fa6b6a184342a9670ac7cf85ade36 rpython/jit/tool/test/test_traceviewer.py}} indicates that rpython/jit/tool/test/test_traceviewer.py has been modified\n\nIt would be very useful if an additional &#x27;files&#x27; sub-resource could be added to the pullrequest resource, which when called would return a list of files modified within the pullrequest e.g.\n\n{{https://bitbucket.org/api/2.0/repositories/pypy/pypy/pullrequests/150/files}}\n\nThis enhancement would be of particular use to a number of us who want to integrate automated pullrequest management into our CI/CD process (Please see discussion on related issue [pullrequest listing API is necessary.
