      "description": "In Advanced Roadmaps for Jira (ARJ) sprints end one day earlier than they actually do on the board.\r\nAs ARJ is designed to support plans spanning over months or even years its time scale is always in days. Moreover sprints of a single team are not allowed to overlap. The combination of these constraints may result in cases that are confusing as there might be discrepancies between sprint end dates visible on Boards and the Gantt chart bars and scheduled end dates in ARJ.\r\n\r\nConsider for example a sprint ending on the 31/Dec 9AM.  At some point ARJ needs to decide if the 31/Dec is considered to be part of this sprint or not - not only for the lengths of bars in the schedule, but also for capacity based planning as it is used in auto-scheduling. In this particular case it seems obvious to let the sprint end on 30/Dec in ARJ. But what about a sprint ending at 3PM.\r\nTo avoid complications arising from hard cutoffs where the difference of a single minute on the planned sprint end dates can have a significant impact on the outcome of auto-scheduling it has been decided to always exclude the last day of the sprint. This seemed to be the right decision as the next sprint can then start on the day configured on the board and a two weeks sprint on the board actually has 14 days.\r\n\r\nIn order to resolve this problem ARJ would need to change it\u2019s time granularity and take the time of the day into account.",

However, we are able to move the issue to an Active Sprint although Jira shows the following error:\r\n\r\n!image-2020-07-07-19-30-46-968.png|width=375,height=95!\r\n\r\nThis error is the same that is shown when reordering issues in the Backlog.
