[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JPOSERVER-364].\n  {panel}\n\nWith our implementation of the portfolio and Jira Agile we have created a particular mapping between estimates on custom sub tasks to the estimates on the 'skills' in the portfolio. Note we are using time to estimate effort. For example we have custom sub tasks 'Design', 'Development' & 'Testing' that link to skills of the same name in the portfolio. \n\nOnce a portfolio epic becomes 'live' we would like to link an actual epic in Jira with which then aggregate sum of the relevant sub task types would flow back into the portfolio 'skill' estimates in the portfolio. Effectively the ownership of the estimates now moves to the implementation of the epic in Jira. This now gives us a 'live' constraint based view of the skill estimates as they vary during the implementation phase, eg the test estimate doubles and the test skill become a visual bottle neck in the portfolio. We are often coupled to skill shortages in our workflow, etc.\n\nIn the current portfolio documentation there is a suggestion to use the story breakdown to create a separate story for each skill and just use title string to describe. We could do this but we find this data model less obvious than using specific sub task types for the skills. Also a single story neatly contains all the effort estimation in this model, avoiding a proliferation of stories under an epic. I should note also we like the portfolio be a lean with just epics that link to the Jira epic and avoid duplicating too much data, the drill down is always possible with the issue link.\n\nSo the question is would this 'sub task type' to 'skill' mapping be something worth considering in the portfolio product when setting up synchronization?\n\nIf not it would be great to have a basic API on the portfolio to allow us to scripts this custom synchronization we desire properly. At the moment we actually have this working with some custom scripting that interacts with the Jira API and SQL db for the portfolio (gasp), updates once a day. This was really just our proof of concept ;)\n",

Right now my only choice to get up and running with Portfolio is to add each one of these to the project. This would be tedious but simple if I could filter on project and status (e.g. everything in the FOO project that is open or in progress) but unless I personally create that filter, I can't use a basic filter that is native to Jira. This is a huge disconnect from the native application we are creating our requirements documents in and will be a barrier to adoption.",

Static does the same the current implementation, i.e., allowing to specify weekly hours statically allocated to this team in a certain timeframe, dynamic means that the person can be allocated up to the total available time to a team, but across all teams not more than the total weekly hours. Additionally, it should be possible to specify a range, e.g. \"can be allocated up to 50% of her time to this team\"\nThe scheduling algorithm, when scheduling by priority order, allocates these flexible capacities greedily to the most important items, i.e. to get something with high priority done first, the according team will get the person allocated by as much as possible. \nThis means, people could switch from sprint to sprint flexibly between teams, in Kanban mode even from day to day, working for team A on one day, and team B on another day.

I take this to mean that you can have a master plan currently running, fork it off to draft a possible alternate plan, then declare that alternate plan to be the master plan once you're happy with it.\nHowever, because the Plan owns the Team definitions, if any team settings change on the current master plan (e.g. new members, leave dates) while a new plan is in draft, you have to manually bring those changes across. When trying to plan for 200+ people, this is near impossible.\nTo plan large work programs in practice, I need to be able to migrate team, skills and stages  data between plans. Much better though would be for that data to be factored-out of my plan, so that I can have two or more plans live-linking to a common set of Team records. I.e. give me the option of having plans that just _use_ Teams, rather than _own_ them.",

Thus with a weekly hours field and exceptions. This would then allow to divide the working hours of a person between two teams automatically.

This issue is being addressed as part of the all new Portfolio live plans, which feature an entirely overhauled and more seamless integration model with JIRA Software / Agile. Live plans are currently available as a labs feature for both Server* and Cloud, so you can start evaluating them without any risk of impacting existing Portfolio plans. They are not yet feature-complete, we're working on bringing all major capabilities of standard plans back into live plans on top of the new integration model before we graduate live plans out of labs and make them the new standard way of working. \nPlease check out this blog for a summary and short videos of how the top-voted suggestions are being addressed with live plans: [Top 10 suggestions addressed in live plans|http://blogs.atlassian.com/2016/03/10-user-suggestions-addressed-in-portfolio-for-jira/] and join our [Portfolio Pioneers LinkedIn group|https://www.linkedin.com/groups/7018171] to discuss feedback and best practices!\n \nThanks,\nMartin Suntinger\n[msuntinger@atlassian.com|mailto:msuntinger@atlassian.com]\nPrincipal Product Manager, Portfolio for JIRA\n \n^*The live plans labs feature is available with Portfolio for JIRA 1.12 or higher. It is compatible with JIRA Software 7.0.5 or higher, and JIRA 6.3 or higher, in association with JIRA Agile 6.7.12 or higher.^\n{panel}\n\nAt the moment, sprints scheduled in Portfolio and Agile aren't aligned.

Live plans are currently available as a labs feature for both Server* and Cloud, so you can start evaluating them without any risk of impacting existing Portfolio plans. They are not yet feature-complete, we're working on bringing all major capabilities of standard plans back into live plans on top of the new integration model before we graduate live plans out of labs and make them the new standard way of working. \nPlease check out this blog for a summary and short videos of how the top-voted suggestions are being addressed with live plans: [Top 10 suggestions addressed in live plans|http://blogs.atlassian.com/2016/03/10-user-suggestions-addressed-in-portfolio-for-jira/] and join our [Portfolio Pioneers LinkedIn group|https://www.linkedin.com/groups/7018171] to discuss feedback and best practices!\n \nThanks,\nMartin Suntinger\n[msuntinger@atlassian.com|mailto:msuntinger@atlassian.com]\nPrincipal Product Manager, Portfolio for JIRA\n \n^*The live plans labs feature is available with Portfolio for JIRA 1.12 or higher. It is compatible with JIRA Software 7.0.5 or higher, and JIRA 6.3 or higher, in association with JIRA Agile 6.7.12 or higher.^\n{panel}\n\nPlease allow the import of dependencies to other issues.\n\nE.g. a depencie is given in a JIRA issue by setting a link from one issue to an other, using the link type \"depending on\". By importing the issue into JIRA Portfolio, the linked issue should be set as \"required\" in JIRA Portfolio.\n\nThis way all relevant information can be set by the assignee in the JIRA issue (estimation, dependencies).",

This issue is being addressed as part of the all new Portfolio live plans, which feature an entirely overhauled and more seamless integration model with JIRA Software / Agile. Live plans are currently available as a labs feature for both Server* and Cloud, so you can start evaluating them without any risk of impacting existing Portfolio plans. They are not yet feature-complete, we're working on bringing all major capabilities of standard plans back into live plans on top of the new integration model before we graduate live plans out of labs and make them the new standard way of working. \nPlease check out this blog for a summary and short videos of how the top-voted suggestions are being addressed with live plans: [Top 10 suggestions addressed in live plans|http://blogs.atlassian.com/2016/03/10-user-suggestions-addressed-in-portfolio-for-jira/] and join our [Portfolio Pioneers LinkedIn group|https://www.linkedin.com/groups/7018171] to discuss feedback and best practices!\n \nThanks,\nMartin Suntinger\n[msuntinger@atlassian.com|mailto:msuntinger@atlassian.com]\nPrincipal Product Manager, Portfolio for JIRA\n \n^*The live plans labs feature is available with Portfolio for JIRA 1.12 or higher. It is compatible with JIRA Software 7.0.5 or higher, and JIRA 6.3 or higher, in association with JIRA Agile 6.7.12 or higher.^\n{panel}\n\n* I have an epic with two stories in JIRA\n* I import this epic and its stories to Portfolio\n* I create another epic in JIRA\n* I move one of the two stories of the first epic to the new epic\n* I want this change to modify my Epic/Story relationship in Portfolio in order to be in sync with my configuration in JIRA",

We have a lot of teams with various skills, and we often get assigned tasks that will only fit into the skill set of a few persons on a specific team. \n\nAn example: A task (epic) has been assigned to my team. I have linked the epic to my backlog and estimated it to 10 days. The task only targets Skill 1 in our cross-functional team:\n!1.png|thumbnail!\n\nWe have 5 skills, and skill 1 is, by default, set to 20%. I now want to make skill 1 accountable for 100%. You cannot punch in '100%', so I enter '100':\n!2.png|thumbnail!\n\nBut now the full estimate is 100 days. Of course, I could the just enter 10, but that still interferes with the idea of making Portfolio driven by the data in the backlog.\n\nWould it be possible to allow for entering percentages in the skill fields? However, I am not sure if this is the best solution for the problem. If I have a task with 70% Skill 1 and 30% Skill 2, it would be possible to slot it in using the idea above. But as time progresses and, say, the Skill 1 part estimate increase due to whatever, this will also affect the percentage of the estimate that goes to Skill 2.\n",
