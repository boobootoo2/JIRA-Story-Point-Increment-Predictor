[#SRCTREEWIN-535]\r\n\r\nWhen viewing Unstaged files, I would love to have the ability to sort the list by file type (extension) or provide a filter to temporarily isolate certain files.\r\n\r\nFor example, I have a bunch of .META files that I don't want to commit at this time or permanently ignore, but I'd like to temporarily hide them so that I can see which .CS files have been modified. Being able to add an \"extension\" or \"file type\" column to the \"Flat list (multiple column)\" mode and sorting by that column would do the trick. A text field that would allow me to enter a wildcard filter should work as well. For example, \"-*.meta\" to temporarily remove the .meta files from the list.",

Expected Results\r\n\r\nSince an old version is incompatible with SourceTree, an error message should show -- indicating to the user that he should use a newer version of Mercurial\r\n\r\nh3.
