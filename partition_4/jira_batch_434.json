My idea is to instead of having the files in that list there would be folders you can create and if you click that folder you'll see the files you added within that folder.Current versionListDocument1Document2\u00a0My IdeaListBlueprintsFolder\u00a0 \u00a0 Blueprint1.pdf\u00a0 \u00a0 Blueprint2.pdfSpecificationsFolder\u00a0 \u00a0 SpecificationDocument1.doc\u00a0 \u00a0 OtherSpecifications.doc\u00a0Hopefully you get my idea and isn't having too hard of a time trying to interpret the idea I had.\u00a0\u00a0RegardsDaniel",

Workaround\r\n * Make sure Insight index (cache) is stored before Jira triggers \"force shutdown\" command - refer to [this guide|https://documentation.mindville.com/display/INSSERV/Installation+Guide] that explains how to do this.\r\n * Otherwise, manually copy the index as follows:\r\n ## In Jira, go to settings > Apps > Manage apps > Indexing Insight > Persist Insight Index to file\r\n ## Copy the index directory ($JIRA_HOME/caches/insight_indexes) to a backup location\r\n ## Before the next Jira startup event, restore the copied index directory over the existing one.\r\n\r\nh3. Notes\r\n\r\nSo far, we have seen this behaviour only during startup event. It does not happen regularly, but only under rare and specific circumstances.

Issue Summary\r\n\r\n(*) This is a combination of existing bugs: [IMFC-72|https://jira.mindville.com/browse/IMFC-72] & [IMFC-82|https://jira.mindville.com/browse/IMFC-82]\r\n Insight Macro for Confluence with versions above 1.4.1 could potentially cause JVM crash. Problematic frame is libj2v8_linux_x86_64.so+0xae3a19\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n * Set up a Confluence instance, such as 7.11.1\r\n * Set up a Jira instance, such as 8.13.1\r\n * Once both instances are started, link Jira and Confluence using the Application Links.\r\n !Application_Links_-_Jira.png|thumbnail! \r\n !Application_Links_-_Jira.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nh4. On Jira side\r\n * Install the\u00a0Insight NVD plugin for Insight. (i) This plugin is not involved on this bug. We just used it to create over 30k objects to generate custom data)\r\n * Create a new Insight object schema\r\n * From this new schema, create a new CVE import and synchronize it - this will create a lot of objects\r\n !CVE Import.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\nh4. On Confluence side\r\n * Install Insight for Confluence app\r\n * Configure an Insight Macro to use the newly created application link (System / Manage Apps, select Insight Macro and click configure)\r\n * Create a new page and insert the Insight Macro.\r\n * In the macro configuration, select the Insight schema you just created\r\n !Insight_Confluence_Macro_1.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\n * Select all the attributes (to make the response as big as possible)\r\n !Insight_Confluence_Macro_2.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\n * Set the 'Load more limit' to 500.\r\n !Insight_Confluence_Macro_3.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\n * On the new page, the list of objects will be displayed\r\n !Insight_Confluence_Macro_4.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\n * Export this page as PDF or Word\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nThe PDF should be exported and Confluence does not crash\r\n OR\r\n Insight objects are loaded in Confluence pages without Confluence crashing\r\nh3.

We continue to deepen the integration of Insight with JSM and do not have plans to provide the ability to disable the feature.\r\n\r\nInsight provides powerful asset and configuration management capabilities that lets you create and manage your IT and business assets, and interact with them through requests, incidents, changes, and more. Whether it\u2019s hardware, software, or office equipment, you can see everything you own at a glance and categorise it in a clear way. These capabilities are a cornerstone of IT Service Management (ITSM), a market where we continue to see strong momentum.\r\n\r\nWe hope that you appreciate our candid and transparent communication. Please visit our product documentation to learn more about [getting started with Insight|https://confluence.atlassian.com/servicemanagementserver/getting-started-with-insight-1044784303.html].\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\n\r\nCharlie\r\n\r\nJira Service Management, Server & Data Center\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\nHey Team,\r\n\r\nGreetings for the day, hope you are doing great..!!!\r\n\r\nCustomers would like to have an option in the GUI (manage apps) to disable the recently bundled plugins like Insight, Advanced Roadmaps for users if they don't prefer to use them. \r\n\r\nCurrently the option to disable these plugins is not available and hence the customers need to go through REST API based approach or database updates (pluginstate table) which needs manual intervention. Hence it will be great, if we can offer this flexibility to customers to choose whether they prefer to use these plugins (if not can disable in GUI itself). \r\n\r\nThank you for the help in advance.",

Issue Summary\r\n\r\nWhen using basic search to filter the attribute values, some values are not listed if\r\n * there are at least 2 object types referencing the same object and this object type/attribute is created/updated later than another one\r\n * very few objects are assigned with the value(s) (< 1%)\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n(i) In order to reproduce this, we need a big amount of data. An easy way to reproduce this is by using the NVD data.\r\n # Set up NVD integration as per [this documentation|https://documentation.mindville.com/display/INVDI/Setting+up+Insight+NVD+Integration] and sync from the CVE-2020 database.\r\n # The Product object type will have 7000+ objects created.\r\n # Create another object type (e.g. Variants), create 3 objects (e.g. u1, u2, u3).\r\n # Add an attribute to the Product object type referencing Variants.\r\n # Assign 5 objects of Product with u3 and 30 objects with u1. Assign all other objects with u2.\r\n # In the object schema search page for Product, use basic search and select to filter by Variants. We'll see all 3 values of Variants appear in the list.\r\n # Now we need a second object type referencing Variants too. To make this simple, we can create another object type (e.g. Application) and import another 7000+ objects again from the CVE database (or CSV import).\r\n # Add an attribute to the Application object type referencing Variants.\r\n # Assign 5 objects of Application with u3 and 30 objects with u1. Assign all other objects with u2.\r\n # In the object schema search page for Application, use basic search and select to filter by Variants.\r\n # Note that only option U2 with lot of occurrences will show up:\r\n !screenshot-1.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\n(!)\u00a0It was also noticed the same problem occurs when\u00a0an attribute is referring to Jira Groups (with non-standard groups) and it is used in the Basic Filter. When the Object Type has a huge amount of assets, the Basic Filter does not list all possible Groups.\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nAs long as there's at least one object with the attribute value, the value should show up in the basic search list of both object types (Product and Application)\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n * In the search for Product, all 3 options (u1, u2, and u3) are shown in the list\r\n !screenshot-2.png|thumbnail!\r\n * In the search for Application, only the option(s) with the majority of occurrences are shown. With the steps above, only U2 is shown.\r\n !screenshot-1.png|thumbnail!\r\n * If you type U1 or U2, the option will become available\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n # Use the advanced search; or\r\n # Type in the value in the basic search field (it may fail in some cases as well)",

Hence it cannot work with the bulk edit - as the Bulk action has no\r\nspecific Project Context - you may Bulk Edit Issues of different Projects at the same\r\ntime...\r\n\r\nYou will note that when you create an issue, you can see the project in the form but\r\nthis is not the case for the bulk edit screen. The bulk edit action for Jira issues\u00a0is not\r\nbound to a specific project so the placeholder will return no value and there will be\r\nno Object available for selection...\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nI understand that there is an underlying logic difficulty here.

Problem Definition\r\nThe Jira REST API on api/2/issue returns inconsistent information on the Insight custom field in GET as compared to POST request - the JSON data for GET request includes the object's \"label / name + object key\" but the POST request only requires the \"object key\". The expectation for the REST API would be a consistent data.\r\n\r\n # Following [this guide|https://documentation.mindville.com/insight/latest/insight-with-jira-rest-api-33466746.html], create an issue via Jira REST API and include the key attribute to define the Insight object key(s). For example:\r\n{code:java}\r\n{\r\n    \"fields\": {\r\n       \"project\":\r\n       {\r\n          \"key\": \"ITSD\"\r\n       },\r\n       \"summary\": \"REST ye merry gentlemen.\",\r\n       \"description\": \"Creating of an issue using project keys and issue type names using the REST API\",\r\n       \"issuetype\": {\r\n          \"name\": \"Task\"\r\n       },\r\n       \"customfield_10300\" : [{\"key\" : \"IAS-1\"}]\r\n   }\r\n}\r\n{code}\r\n(i) This will create an issue in project ITSD and associate object IAS-1 in an Insight custom field\r\n\r\n # Run the GET request to retrieve the data. For example:\r\n{code:java}\r\n{\r\n  \"expand\": \"renderedFields,names,schema,operations,editmeta,changelog,versionedRepresentations\",\r\n  \"id\": \"10501\",\r\n  \"self\": \"http://localhost:48133/j8133/rest/api/2/issue/10501\",\r\n  \"key\": \"ITSD-44\",\r\n...\r\n    \"customfield_10300\": [\r\n      \"iPhone 7 (IAS-1)\"\r\n    ],\r\n{code}\r\n(!)
