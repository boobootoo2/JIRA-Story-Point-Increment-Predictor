Issue Summary\r\nScheduler worker thread pool can completely block with a hung TCP connection waiting for HTTP CONNECT response from outbound proxy because there's no SocketTimeout.\r\n\r\nOnce the worker thread pool is blocked, all scheduled Bamboo tasks won't run. Included to, but not limited to:\r\n* Scheduled background deletion\r\n* Scheduled triggers\r\n\r\nh3. Environment\r\n* Bitbucket application link\r\n* Having any application link from Bamboo to another Atlassian application go via outbound proxy, even if Bitbucket is not.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Start Bamboo connected to a proper outbound proxy e.g. Squid on port 8080\r\n# Create an Application Link to Bitbucket Server\r\n# Create a plan with a Bitbucket Server Repository with a Bitbucket Server repository triggered trigger\r\n#* It's important that we have a valid connected application link first, or we never appear to get to the point where the Stash Polling job performs an outbound request which is why I used a proper outbound proxy to reproduce.\r\n# Stop the outbound proxy and replace it with a generic TCP listener on the same port. E.g. netcat:\r\n{code}\r\nsudo nc -k -l 8080\r\n{code}\r\n#* It's important the TCP connection can be established but there is no response to the HTTP CONNECT.\r\n# After ~180 seconds (3 minutes), 1 scheduler worker should attempt to run the Stash Polling quartz job and hang waiting for a response to the HTTP CONNECT.\r\n#* This may vary in time on later versions due to the applink inbound connection status cache.\r\n# After a further 1620 seconds (27 minutes) the remaining 9 scheduler worker threads should also block waiting for the cache to be populated by the one runnable / never ending thread.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nSocket timeout should be hit and exception should be thrown.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nThread sits waiting indefinitely until the TCP connection is closed or Bamboo is restarted. Each scheduler thread gets put into an infinite wait each time a Stash Polling Quartz job is run, while waiting for cache population. Eventually the whole thread pool is starved and no scheduled jobs run.\r\n\r\nExample runnable thread:\r\n{noformat}\r\n\"scheduler_Worker-3\" #41 prio=5 os_prio=0 tid=0x00007f979fb6d800 nid=0x3617

      "description": "h3. Summary\r\nQuiet period setting on a a repository will sleep an entire PlanExec thread for the duration of the quiet period and subsequent retries. This can easily lead to thread starvation for the limited thread pool of 4 with long and frequent quiet period usage -- leading to triggered build and deployment delays even for plans that do not have the quiet period configured (because they must pass through the queue serviced by the same worker pool)\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Set a quiet period delay of 600 seconds on 4 separate plans referencing the same repository.\r\n# Add a repository polling trigger.\r\n# Create another plan with a repository polling trigger referencing a different repository.\r\n# Commit to the repository and wait for polling trigger.\r\n# All 4 plans will take up a PlanExec thread for 600 seconds.\r\n# Commit to the second repository to attempt to trigger the other plan.\r\n# Build will remain queued until PlanExec threads clear up from the 600 second quiet period.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nQuiet period should not block change detection for other plans.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nChange detection is blocked.

The feature I'm asking for is for a commit or branch to be blocked at the HITL plan until it passes the Systems plan.\r\n\r\nConceptually it's similar to the existing dependency blocking strategy feature. The problem is the existing dependency blocking only works within the context of parent and child plans, and only blocks if the build was triggered by a parent building, not if the build was manually triggered or scheduled. I want a general way to say \"Don't run this commit on plan B until it has passed plan A\"\r\n\r\n!image-2018-12-28-19-00-14-909.png|width=522,height=91!",

      "description": "This suggestion comes from requests made in the Atlassian Community ([https://community.atlassian.com/t5/Bamboo-questions/Why-doesn-t-Bamboo-s-REST-API-support-reading-and-writing/qaq-p/958960], [https://community.atlassian.com/t5/Bamboo-questions/How-do-I-get-Deployment-variables-via-REST-API/qaq-p/633329]) and other sources in which find very difficult setting up Variables in Bamboo, forcing users to manage them from Bamboo's UI instead.\r\n\r\nAs it stands now, Bamboo Java Specs provides us with a way to work with Variables in Bamboo ([https://docs.atlassian.com/bamboo-specs-docs/6.7.2/specs-java.html#variables]). However, this approach seems to be restricted to Plan / Environment variables as there is/are no example on making variables available to the Global scope in Bamboo.\r\n (i) There is no example in [Variables|https://docs.atlassian.com/bamboo-specs-docs/6.7.2/specs-java.html#variables] related to Environment variables, but here is an example:\r\n{code:java}\r\nDeployment deployment = new Deployment(new PlanIdentifier(\"PROJ\", \"PLAN\"), \"My Deployment\")\r\n\t\t.environments(new Environment(\"My Environment\")\r\n\t\t\t.variables(new Variable(\"myEnvironmentVariable\",\"FROM ENVIRONMENT\")));\r\n{code}\r\n(i) The downside of using Bamboo Java Specs is that you have to set up your environment with Maven, Java and such in order to publish your changes against your Bamboo Server instance. If this is not the case, then you would required to go through the repository configuration, making your source code available as Specs in Bamboo, setting you Git, commit your changes and so on...\r\n\r\nFor reasons described above, it would be much easier/appreciated having REST API endpoint available for:\r\n * viewing, creating, updating, deleting *Global* Variables\r\n * viewing, creating, updating, deleting *Plan* Variables\r\n * viewing, creating, updating, deleting *Environment* Variables\r\n\r\nAt the moment, there are two endpoint that can be used to view variables and they are described in BAM-16056 and BAM-18006. However, you have to consume Bamboo actions in order to create variables (_as described in_ [https://community.atlassian.com/t5/Bamboo-questions/How-do-I-get-Deployment-variables-via-REST-API/qaq-p/633329]), meaning that you have to dig into web browser requests in order to get the correct action and parameters to create variables. Not to mention how difficult it is to update or delete a variable (_in which requires its id_). Unfortunately, not everyone has knowledge in web requests, meaning that users should have a way to accomplish things (_configuration in this case_) in an easier manner.",

      "description": "h3. Problem\r\n\r\nThe new Repository Commit task will commit all files and folders (added or modified) in the repository folder area. By default the Source Code Checkout task is set to the plan build working directory and there is where all the Bamboo tasks for that particular plan will run, creating and modifying files. As a consequence, if the Repository Commit task is used, the plan will end up committing not only modified repo files but any other temporary file that was created during the build.\r\nh3. Suggested solution\r\n\r\nTwo improvements can be done in this task to help the users:\r\n # Add a check box that will allow the user to disable the addition of new files.\r\n This would allow users to create new files in the repository area and they would not be committed. Only modification of existing files would be possible.\r\n # When a commit task is added a warning will show up explaining that the Source Code Checkout task should be set to a different location (in case it is set to the plan build working directory). This would prevent problems with any other tasks that might create temporary files that should not be added to the source repository.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nEvery time you use a Repository Commit Task, make sure you set a special folder for the the repository checkout. This can be achieved by setting the\u00a0*Checkout Directory* *field*\u00a0on your\u00a0*Source Code Checkout task*.",

Option 2\r\nSecure Bamboo using SSL. HTTPS endpoints for the webhook are unaffected by this due to the proxying done by Bitbucket Cloud:\r\n* [Securing Bamboo with Tomcat using SSL|https://confluence.atlassian.com/bamboo/securing-bamboo-with-tomcat-using-ssl-391087422.html]\r\n* [Securing Bamboo with Apache using SSL|https://confluence.atlassian.com/bamboo/securing-bamboo-with-apache-using-ssl-391087437.html]\r\n\r\nYour Bamboo Base URL will need to be updated with the new HTTPS address and each Bitbucket Cloud webhook will need to point to the new address.\r\n\r\nh6. Option 3\r\nIf SSL is not an option, use a HTTP reverse proxy in between the source and the Bamboo server that sets the X-Forwarded-For field to only contain IP addresses. E.g. The {{proxy_set_header}} directive in Nginx:\r\n* http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_proxy_module.html#proxy_set_header\r\n{code}\r\n...\r\nproxy_set_header  X-Forwarded-For $remote_addr;\r\n...\r\n{code}\r\n",
