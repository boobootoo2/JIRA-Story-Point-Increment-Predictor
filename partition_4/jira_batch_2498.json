This is annoying because this file is no longer readable the same way with the same tools and the commit diff can&#x27;t tell you what actually was the change. Please let the online editor use the normal {{\\n}}, at least when the file already uses {{\\n}} instead of {{\\r\\n}}. I personally also believe that there is no reason to spend two bytes to say what one byte can say, but I accept if other people think differently about their text files.\n\nAlso easily noticeable with a git diff are a few space chars that are not necessary. The bitbucket diff doesn&#x27;t show them. A simple regex can match and kill all trailing space chars automatically without changing the meaning of most text files.\n\n(I leave the priority on major. Don&#x27;t know about you guys but for me personally such kind of result critical ;))",
