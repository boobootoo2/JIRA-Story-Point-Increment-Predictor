However, for some of our projects we don't use the default SVN \".../branches/\" path but \".../releases/\" instead. The problem is that this custom URL automagically resets itself back to default \"/branches/\" every time someone makes a change in plan configuration.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n\r\n* Create a new plan.\r\n* Create new Subversion source repository\r\n* Go to \"Branches\" tab\r\n* Click \"Change Subversion branches URL\" and change the URL from \".../branches/\" to \".../releases/\" (or something else). Save.\r\n* Go to \"Dependencies\" tab. Add any child plan. Save\r\n* Go back to \"Branches\" tab. See that the URL changed back to \".../branches/\" again.\r\n\r\nThis does not seem to happen if you uncheck \"Automatically detect root URL for branches\" box in \"Advanced Options\" of SVN source repository settings and provide custom branches URL there. \r\n",

I am attaching a section of the logs. \r\n\r\n*workaround*\r\n\r\nThe workaround is to set \"The average time builds have been waiting in a queue\" to something unreasonable big, like for example 28,500 minutes (or even more).\r\n\r\nThe reason we should do that is that the Bamboo EC2 optimizer (the mechanism in Bamboo that can spin on or shut down EC2 instances according to the build queue load) algorithm works as follows (with details excluded):\r\n1) each minute run a check if there is a necessity to spin (or shut down) an EC2 instance:\r\n1.1) (more-less) if there are builds in the queue that can't be built with the current agents at all, start the relevant EC2 images\r\n1.2) if there are builds in the queue that can be built by EC2 agent and Bamboo is not spinning up EC2 images:\r\n1.2.1) check the thresholds (time line the queue, total builds in the queue, etc), and if we cross the thresholds - spin the relevant EC2 images\r\n\r\nAnd that \"EC2 Optimizer\" is running this algorithm each 60 seconds.\r\nNow, the problem is when the newly EC2 image is spun up and register itself as a ready agent. Before that new agent will pickup the build some time will pass or elapse (communication, initializing, etc). So the build that triggered EC2 image startup will still stay in the queue, most probably it will stay in the queue for the succeeding \"EC2 Optimizer\" run. And that succeeding run will check in the step (1.2) that Bamboo is not spinning EC2 images (because EC2 agent just transitioned to a ready state) so it will check the thresholds (did build stay 1 minute in queue? for sure - EC2 agents spin up in more than 1 minute) and as a result - the second EC2 image will be started by Bamboo again.\r\n\r\nThis seemed to have fixed itself in 4.4.5",

So in our example, the first stage job will contain changes from perforce1 (if there were any, but since it was triggered by the changes, then certainly there were some changes), and the second stage job will contain changes from perforce2 (so most probably: no changes at all).\r\n3) the \"Recently Built\" activity stream scans for the recently finished jobs, and uses the following logic to determine what to display:\r\nif it is a build that was manually triggered - displays the username stored against trigger reason (note that this data is stored differently than the changes from repositories - it is stored together with the trigger reason mentioned in 1.1). \r\nIf it is a build triggered by \"code changed\" event, then we display username(s) of people that are recorded as authors of the commits relevant to that job.\r\nGiven that we don't store irrelevant code changes in the job build result, and given that usually there is no commits on the perforce2 repository (the one used in second stage), so the \"Recently Built\" is displaying \"Anonymous\" user as it doesn't see any authors. \r\n",

For instance, the above section should really be two sections: one for the non-job-specific information (which would exclude logEntries etc.) and then another section for the URL with a job in it, which would talk about the job-specific information available.",
