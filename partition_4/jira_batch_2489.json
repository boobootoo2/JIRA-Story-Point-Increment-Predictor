So, say private pull requests are allowed or enforced, then the user would be forced or optionally be able to make pull requests private, i.e the source code is not made public until merged.\n\nWe identified this as a good requirement because we have private and public repositories at our organisation and for security might not want the data of a pull request being public, for example if a not so advanced user stores a password in a file. So, what we do now is submit no pull requests and just merge a special branch of each user that did some changes. The user then though has to ping the public project maintainer to merge in the changes. It works but it would be nice to have at least a notification in that case. However, putting it in a private pull request would make this much better.",

      "description": "Right now when viewing a Pull Request in BitBucket, {{*.ico}} files are not displayed correctly in many cases, depending on the way the file was saved. {{*.ico}} files can be saved in a couple of different formats. If the {{*.ico}} file only contains a single image, then it already is displayed correctly. But this is unusual. Typically, {{*.ico}} files will have multiple images embedded inside of them. I use a free program called IcoFX to generate my {{*.ico}} files, and I know it stores the following different versions of the same file inside the single file:\n\n# 512x512 - 32 colors\n# 256x256 - 32 colors\n# 48x48 - 32 colors\n# 32x32 - 32 colors\n# 16x16 - 32 colors\n# 48x48 - 8 colors\n# 32x32 - 8 colors\n# 16x16 - 8 colors\n# 32x32 - 4 colors\n# 16x16 - 4 colors\n\nWith files like these, currently the BitBucket image previewer shows a blank square instead of the image.\n\nWhat it should do: display the largest available image with the most colors available. So in the example above it would show the 512x512 (32 colors) version.",

However, based on the reported size from the repo page on bitbucket, it is still showing as 1.9GB - with the warning that \"the repository size is over 1GB\".\n\nAs it is, I&#x27;m worried that any pushes we do could push it beyond the 2GB hard-limit.
