Our priority Epics are in one (blue) release and are estimated across several teams, but as the screenshot shows, on one team the Epic is not scheduled until Sprint 6-7.\n\nI have checked all settings in the plan, set minimum load of story points to 0 (for epics) and even reduced the large Epic estimate (36) to a low number, and the Epic always remains \"stuck\" in Sprint 6.\n\nCould you please advise the logic used for the Schedule and why this is happening?

Problem\n\nThe \"Dependent story constraint\" can be confusing, and it can result in JIRA Portfolio calculating impossible schedules.\n\nh2. Suggestion\n\nThe feature should be documented and labeled better.  It appears to only apply to scrum teams but apparently it's relevant to any kind of team?\n\nh2. Background\n\nI'm planning a small milestone with a few tasks distributed between two teams.  Our hours-per-day setting is set to six hours.  In the attached image, you can see the time estimates.  There are four tasks (not stories, does it matter?) that depend on one another:\n\n* Final QA (1 hour), depends on:\n* QA fixes (4 hours), depends on:\n* QA testing (2 hours), depends on:\n* Mailer implementation (12 hours)\n\nThose four issues form a critical path that will take at least 17 total hours.  JIRA Portfolio calculated a schedule that says that we should be able to accomplish all four of those things in one six-hour day.\n\nThat's impossible.\n\n!Engineering_-_JIRA_Portfolio_-_JIRA.jpg|width=600px!",

I create filter for jira product and verion -in general more than 100 issues in there. \n2. I import the issues, I select the filter and it shows 100 of 500.\n3. The checkbox  Exclude already linked issues is checked but seams not to work.\n\nI expect that after 5 runs of import the list should be empty as the checkbox:Exclude already linked issues is marked.\n\nMy questions/issues:\n1. This looks like a bug or I use it in wrong way\n2. How to handle 500 isues where I cannot limit it to 100,the onlylimitations on my filter is fixversion\n",

At the same time, the card showed Free Capacities of Back End Dev, which doesn't make sense.\n\nAtlassian suggested that rather than having separate stages for work type, eg, one stage for Design, another stage for Back End Dev, and another for Technical Lead etc, the calculation would probably work better if all work types were set up as different skills within one stage.

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JPOSERVER-1820].\n  {panel}\n\nh2. Problem Definition\nJIRA has setup with components. Each component represent components in the enterprise systems.  When issue (story/task) is created first in JIRA first, during the initial analysis phase the component is assigned to the issue in JIRA.\nLater during the planning phase, where PMO is creating a plan through Portfolio issues are imported on the portfolio plan. In the portfolio teams and skill sets are defined so that portfolio can suggest resource allocation. The component field is also visible on portfolio now. But currently there is no direct association between component and either team or skill sets. So when portfolio suggests resource allocation (or when PMO 'calculates' for the schedule) the resources picked up are from random teams - without any consideration on the skill set/teams. So the development tasks/stories will get QA or BA resource getting assigned.  The only option is to go individually on all the issues and change the resource allocation manually.  When there are 100 - 200 different epics (with average 5-10 tasks/stories under each epic)  under development for different releases, it becomes extremely tedious job. \n\n\nh2. Suggested Solution\nI think we can have feature/option to link JIRA component with Portfolio skill set or project teams. \nOne can associate/link component with teams created in portfolio. \nFor example:\nComponent \"Pricing engine\" can be mapped to \"Pricing team\". Similarly component \"XYZ adapter\" can be mapped to \"XYZ adapter team\". \n\nFor someone skills are more helpful to plan. In that case one can associate component with skills and this can be many to many relationship. \nFor example:\nComponent \"Pricing engine\" can have multiple skill set associated with it.  Other component \"XYZ adapter\" may have other skill sets, but can share some skill set from \"Pricing engine\" component.\n\nOne can create this association while creating a plan from JIRA issues or from the \"Configure\" plan option.\n\nOnce the link between component and teams/skills is established, portfolio can use it while suggesting resource allocation on a schedule or calculating capacity.  Portfolio can now suggests resources which are at least meaningful (based on the teams/skill set).\n\n\n\nAgain, this link can be kept optional. so only those who require to use can use. Those who do not need it can continue with current behavior. \n",

Problem Definition\nFor Kanban Teams, in an epic, there can be a possibility of the *Bottleneck* and *Free Capacities* is showing the same skill. This is caused by the bottleneck and free capacities are calculated on a daily basis and then aggregated weekly. \n !Screen Shot 2015-11-18 at 10.38.00 am.png|thumbnail! \n\n*USE CASE*\n* In this example, I have an epic that takes 4 days to complete\n* I also only have 2 developers\n* In the first day, both developers will work on the epic. This means 2 man-days of work will be done on that epic. This leaves 2-man days left\n* However, for that first day, there will be a bottleneck as we did not have enough people to complete that epic in one day\n* In the second day, both developers will again put in 2 man-days of work. This will complete the epic. So it will no longer be a bottle neck\n* For the rest of the days of the week, there will be free capacities\n\n{panel}\nSo if we list the bottlecks and capacities for the whole week it will look like:\nMon: Bottleneck\nTue: (No bottleneck or free capacity)\nWed: Free Capacity\nThu: Free Capacity\nFri: Free Capacity\nWhen we aggregate/combine this for the whole week we get:\nWeek 1: Bottleneck and Free Capacity\n{panel}\n\nThis could lead to confusion to the users\n\nh3.

Let me give you an example.\n\nWe have an Epic (e.g. New website), this includes a lot of tasks that are completely under our control (prepare texts, code HTML template) but also contains some tasks that are managed outside our team (e.g. check legal with lawyers, get design from external freelancer).\u00a0\n\nThe problem here is that we know how long this typically\u00a0takes (e.g. lawyer check = 2-3 weeks, UX design 2-3 weeks), but we are struggling with modeling this in a Portfolio plan.\n\nHere are some hacks we tried and got almost there.\n # Created an External team with Lawyer & Designer virtual team members.\n # Added 3 skills (Core, Legal, Design) with 100%, 0%, 0% default setup.\n # Setup our internal team for Core skill and External team (Laywer = Legal, Designer = Design)\n\nThis works pretty well.\n # Portfolio will not try to recalculate plan and assign tasks to External team if you dont explicitly estimate some work for Legal/Design skill.\n # You can make an upper limit capacity for your external suppliers (handy since you don't want to overload them when you need them on multiple projects simultaneously.\n\nHowever. There is one minor glitch. If you actually don't care about capacity of the third party or you don't want to create a team member for every external supplier you are stuck.\n\n*Suggestion:*\n\nHow about adding a special wait time estimate to tasks? You just say - this task will take about 20hours from an external source (skill) and i dont care about capacity planning. Everything else will just work as is.\n\nIs there any other better way to model this in Portfolio?\n\n\u00a0",

Order of stories in sprints is different than order in the backlog. In real world sometimes it\u2019s possible, but sometimes it has no sense. There could be situation where we have some dependencies \u2013 Story4 cannot be implemented before Story3.\n\nIn mode b) planning fills the sprints without changing their order.
