This is being triggered at a time when the dialog cannot be opened and causes the crash.\r\n\r\nA fix is in progress.\r\n\r\n*Work Around*\r\n Ensure that any .hgrc or mercurial.ini files found in\r\n* bookmarked repository's .hg folder\r\n* %HOME% folder\r\n* %USERPROFILE% folder\r\n\r\ncontain section like this. \r\n\r\n{code}\r\n[ui]\r\nusername=Joe Blogs <joe.blogs@example.com>\r\n{code}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlternatively temporarily moving the %localappdata%\\Atlassian\\SourceTree\\bookmarks.xml out of the %localappdata%\\Atlassian\\SourceTree folder, opening SourceTree and then editing the user name and email in the Tools/Options/General Tab will write the details to the %USERPROFILE%\\.hgrc file.\r\n\r\nIt should then be possible to replace the bookmarks.xml and restart SourceTree.\r\n",

It seems if SourceTree detects a \"permission denied\" error (which is thrown by explorer) it determines it to be an authentication error.\r\n !screenshot-1.png|thumbnail! ",

It happens a lot, usually when I have several repo tabs open. However, lately I've been working on a smaller repository (113 files over 32 folders taking ~4.5MB of diskspace). So I'm thinking there is a more critical problem here.\r\n\r\nAnd once SourceTree is in this state, the other opened tabs behave the same way; ditto on even opening a new repository tab (so opening/closing the tab won't work).\r\n\r\nThis happens frequently and the only fix it to close/restart SourceTree.. and then do the same again later when it gets into the same state.\r\n",
