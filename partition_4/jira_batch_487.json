[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSDCLOUD-421].\r\n{panel}\r\n{panel:title=Original description}\r\nI have a complaint about SLA reports of JIRA Service Desk and I think this should be classified as a bug as I don't want to believe it was designed this way.\r\n\r\nThe reports tab of JSD service provider interface show line charts about number of created, resolved tickets for past 7 days, 30 days, etc. As far as I understand, report filters tickets based on createddate and resolveddate of the issues. The annoying thing is, if I select a report for the past 7 days and run the report at say ... 10:00 AM, the date filter includes records for the past 6x24 hours. There are two things wrong with this:\r\n\r\n1- There appears to be names of 7 days shown on the report but there are actually 6 days on the report (6x24) The first and last days are incomplete. The rest of \"today\" is not lived yet and more importantly the \"first day\" only includes tickets after 10:00 AM of that day. This is not obvious for the customers, they expect full days.\r\n2 - As time passes through the day, I cannot have the same report again. Every minute passing changes my report from the starting point, filtering tickets according to a moving point in the middle of the day, so my reports are inconsistent.\r\n\r\nThe reports should allow me to set beginning and ending dates of reports and more importantly reports must contain full 24 hours for any day shown on report.\r\n{panel}\r\nh3. Problem Definition\r\n\r\nService Desk's Report only allows a specific range\u00a0on filtering the Report period. As an example, the 7 days report will show the following information:\r\n||6 days ago||5 days ago||4 days ago||3 days ago||2 days ago||Yesterday||Today||\r\n|00:00 - 23:59|00:00 - 23:59|00:00 - 23:59|00:00 - 23:59|00:00 - 23:59|00:00 - 23:59|00:00 - 23:59|\r\n\r\nAs today has not yet finished, the data can change each time the report is generated.\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nAbility to provide custom ranges for the Report period\r\nh3. Why this is important\r\n\r\nAllow the\u00a0user to extract and focus on the important details from the report.",

      "description": "Issues that are considered resolved are not having their SLAs update accordingly reports in the service. The reports will not accurately represent the actual data. This means that even though a team may have already dealt with 1000+ issues the SLAs and associated reports will only show new information. Especially when dealing with a \"Time to Resolution Average\" If the goal was originally 240 hours based on a 24/7 calendar, when changed that to a specific calendar (say a 9-5 based calendar) and a 9 hour goal the averages will be thrown way off.\r\n\r\nThe problems pertain exclusively to historical issues. (ie issues that were marked as resolved before the change to the SLA took place) \r\n\r\nFor example let's build a mock timeline:\r\n01-01-2014\r\nCreate SLA \"Time to Resolution\"\r\nGoal is 240 hours based on a 24/7 calendar\r\n01-02-2014 -> 02-01-2014\r\nCreate and Resolve numerous tickets\r\n02-02-2014\r\nModify the SLA \"Time to Resolution\"\r\n-NEW goal is 8 hours based on a custom 9am-5pm calendar\r\n02-03-2014 ->\r\nCreate and Resolve numerous tickets\r\nThe problem is that the tickets created and resolved during the \"01-02-2014 -> 02-01-2014\" phase do not have updated SLAs. Those tickets still present to me SLA data from the initial creation of the SLA on 01-01-2014 (goal being 240 hours) instead of updating the SLA to match the new SLA criteria that was established on 02-02-2014. According to the documentation (https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/SERVICEDESK/SLAs):\r\n\r\nSLA usage notes\r\nIf you edit an existing SLA, JIRA Service Desk will re-index all the existing issues in the project; the re-indexing will ensure that the SLA status on the issues accurately reflects any changed criteria. All the historical SLA data will be recalculated to measure against the new metrics.\r\n\r\nAs stated previously, all issues should have their SLA data updated to match the current SLA goals and criteria.\r\nIn the attached screenshots you can see the following:\r\nSLA Time to Resolution.png\r\nShows that the SLA \"Time to Resolution\" is configured for 9 hours, based on the OPI (9am-5pm) calendar and for issue type \"ScanIt Support Ticket\"\r\nIssue with incorrect SLA.png\r\nShows that a \"ScanIt Support Ticket,\" that was created and resolved before the SLA modification took place, displays information based on SLA goals that do not exist anymore.\r\nIssue with correct SLA/png\r\nShows what I expect to see on all \"ScanIt Support Ticket\" issues, even historical issues. You can see that the SLA is set to a 9 hour goal like how it is configured in the Service Desk SLAs for the project.",

While, it makes sense that the other aspects of JIRA is isolated from the Customer Portal, It's a different thing while working in JIRA and you need to find the URL of the SD request. \r\n\r\nThis is the use case described by a customer who raised this:\r\n{code}\r\nwe also communicate about tickets with customers through other means like email and Skype. Its is then very convenient for the customer to get a direct link to the ticket instead of having to search for it by themselves. For us we are then also sure we are talking about the same ticket.\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nIt doesn't appear efficient to have to search in Service Desk for the corresponding Request for an issue you're already working on in JIRA, and this can be improved by simply providing the URL reference of the SD request in a JIRA issue field.",

We just tried the workaround mentioned in the below article by taking a backup of existing AoD instances and restoring into a standalone version. However we got stuck in the fourth step as we do not have Jira system administrator global permission to work with project import tool.\r\nhttps://confluence.atlassian.com/display/ONDEMANDKB/How+to+Merge+Two+JIRA+OnDemand+Instances\r\n\r\nWould like to know how to overcome this issue mentioned step 4 and proceed with step 5. Any help / thoughts around this topic will really help. Thanks.\r\n\r\n",

[See the corresponding bug report|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSDCLOUD-358].\r\n  {panel}\r\n\r\nh3. Summary of bug\r\n\r\nWhen enabling Service Desk for an existing project, if there are already existing issues that are closed, those issues will not have the SLA counter, and as such will not be counted into the SLA reports\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n# Create a project and a few issues\r\n# Close some of the issues (but not all)\r\n# Enable Service Desk for that project\r\n# Check the closed issues, there will not be any SLA there.\r\n\r\nAn example :\r\n\r\nThe project PNS has 5 issues :\r\n\r\n!SDS1.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nWhen searching for {noformat}project = PNS and \"Time to resolution\" = breached(){noformat}\r\nthe results contains 1 issue :\r\n\r\n!SDS2.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nWhen searching for {noformat}project = PNS and \"Time to resolution\" != breached(){noformat}\r\nthe results contains 3 issues :\r\n\r\n!SDS4.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nThere is one more issue missing, and that issue was actually closed before Service Desk was enabled for this project. As such, the results from the two queries does not add up to the total amount of issues contained in the project.\r\n\r\nh3. Additional Info\r\n\r\n* Although the closed issues will not have any SLA, the issues that are not closed yet will have SLA\r\n* If the closed issues are re-opened, then SLA will be enabled for it. However, the SLA will be reset\r\n* When Service Desk is activated for a project, the SLA information is actually already stored in the database, even for the closed issues. However, for some reason, it is not showing in the UI of the issue.\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nTo enable SLAs for already resolved issues, use the REST API SLA reconstruction call from this KB article: https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirakb/missing-or-corrupted-sla-data-in-jira-service-management-828790603.html\r\n\r\nThis reconstruction call will ignore the fact that the issue was already resolved, and will add the SLA to this issue.",

Both are important for measuring the performance of our support department. \r\n\r\nWe set rules for several statuses to measure the response time which should be around 4-8 hrs. the other one measures the time to resolution and that should be 8-16 hours.Both are dependent on priority level. \r\n\r\nThe first SLA (time to first response) works correctly. The second (time to resolution) seems to have problems displaying the clock both on Ticket level as well in the List overview.\r\n\r\nTime to Resolution starts counting when entering the workflow status 'DMC VOD'. At this time the clock shows correctly. When entering a next status, that clock disappears on both levels (Issue and Overview of Issues). Even when the ticket enters the stage on when it stops counting (Completed) it doesn't appear anymore, as it does with Time to First Response. \r\n\r\nThis might perhaps be caused by a conflict that occurs when a Workflow stage is shared by two SLA's. The 'DMC VOD' stage finalizes the first SLA 'time to first response' and starts the second SLA 'time to resolution'. However, the second SLA only displays correctly on all levels when entering that exact stage 'DMC VOD'. \r\n\r\nwe are running on ON-DEMAND.\r\nWe included ten screenshots showing the flow and what bothers us.\r\nWe also attached the workflow for you.\r\n\r\nThe metrics that disappear are exactly the ones we are focusing on, the SLA that is visible all the time is the one that is less important.\r\n\r\nI could not generate a file that sends you the SLA, so therefore i created a screenshot for that.\r\n\r\nOur major question is:\r\nWhy are these metrics disappearing when going through the workflow?",
