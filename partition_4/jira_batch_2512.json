When I think it should be deployed to the staging server, I checkout staging, merge master into it, and then push to remote staging. The problem is, if I already pushed the same commit to remote master, pushing to remote staging will not fire the post hook again.\n\nThe automated deployment gets the payload, sees that it&#x27;s on branch master, and ignores it. It does not get the payload with branch staging in it (which it should use for deployment).\n\nSo essentially unless I push to staging first, I can&#x27;t get automated deployments working. This is true when trying to deploy to a live site once everyone gave the thumbs up on the staging. Ideally it would be a checkout live, merge staging, push upstream live, and done.\n\nAny plans on making bitbucket fire hooks on push?",

I am trying to pull\\\\\nrequest into the unitrefactor bookmark on the destination (when I opened the pull request, this was 943c100, since the PR has been merged manually now this changeset is no longer the head). When I view the pull request using the \"Edit\"\\\\\nbutton, I am able to choose the correct destination branch and the diff\\\\\nrenders correctly.\n\nUnfortunately, when I actually update the pull request, it appears as if\\\\\nthe diff is against the Stable branch - a completely different head\\\\\ncompared to the one I requested.\n\nThe strange this is, I was able to select the correct destination just a\\\\\ncouple of days ago. However starting yesterday this appears to not work\\\\\nanymore.\n\nThis is for a mercurial repository.  I have no idea if this problem is isolated to mercurial or is a general issue with bitbucket&#x27;s branch pull request functionality.\n\n*Intended behavior*:\n\nI would like to be able to open pull requests against arbitrary heads in\\\\\nthe destination repository.\n\n*Actual behavior*:\n\nI am currently only able to open pull requests against the \"default\" head.\n\n----\nFor now we are reviewing contributions manually on this repository,\\\\\nobviously this is less than ideal. Please let us know if you discover\\\\\nanything or need more information.",
