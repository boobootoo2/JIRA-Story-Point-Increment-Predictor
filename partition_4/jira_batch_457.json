We have updated our documentation to make these requirements more clear:\u00a0[Managing access to your service project - Choose who customers can share requests with|https://confluence.atlassian.com/servicemanagementserver/managing-access-to-your-service-project-939926273.html#Managingaccesstoyourserviceproject-Choosewhocustomerscansharerequestswith]\r\n\r\n\u00a0*2.\u00a0Regarding the issue with not being able to use email addresses in the UserPicker*\u00a0\r\n\r\nOnce the requirements mentioned in the previous point are met, you will be able to search for existing customers using their email addresses in the UserPicker (according to any user filtering rules that you have in place). However, regardless of the permissions, you won\u2019t be able to add the email addresses of people who aren\u2019t customers. Such external email addresses can be added only through the\u00a0*Share request*\u00a0and\u00a0*Raise request on behalf of*\u00a0fields.\r\n\r\nThe confusion comes from the fact that the UI component offering the ability to \u201cAdd new customer\u201d is generic. It is the same component that is used by the\u00a0*Raise request on behalf-of*\u00a0field, but the intended behavior is different. We\u2019ve also updated our documentation to emphasize this, and raised a ticket to update the UserPicker UI component to hide this functionality in the contexts where it can\u2019t be used:\u00a0JSDSERVER-8346\r\n \r\nI hope this helps!\r\n\r\nYann\r\n Software Engineer - Jira Service Management\r\n{panel}\r\nh3. Summary\r\n\r\nIn JIRA Service Desk 3.2.6, administrators may configure a Service Desk's Request Security so that customers can see other users, when filling in a user field, if \"they... enter the exact email or username in a user field\".\r\n\r\nIn JIRA Service Desk 3.3.0+, the structure and wording of this functionality was changed slightly, and administrators may instead configure a Service Desk's Customer Permissions so that customers may share requests with \"Any customer, by typing an email address\".\r\n\r\n(x) In *either* case, customer's actually cannot fill in these users if they enter their full email address; only when using their full username. This is misleading and confusing in the circumstances where the user security is set and customers wish to pull in other customer's via email address (when they don't know the other customer's usernames).\r\n\r\nSee behavior in Service Desk 3.2.6:\r\n !3.2.6_User_Search_Email.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nSee behavior in Service Desk 3.3.0:\r\n !3.3.0_User_Search_Email.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Create a \"User Picker (Single User)\" custom field and associate it with the Service Desk screen\r\n # Modify a Request Type in the Service Desk so that the form incorporates that custom field\r\n # Depending on the version of Service Desk being used, configure Request Security (Service Desk 3.2.x and below) or Customer permissions (Service Desk 3.3.x and above) for the security option which allows customers to select other users if provided a full username/email address (no searching).\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nA customer should be allowed to fill out the form by providing either the full username or the full email address of the user they intend to add.\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nThe error message \"Please provide a valid value for field 'UserPicker'\" is thrown, even if a valid email address is provided. Only the full username will be accepted.\r\nh3. Notes\r\n * As of SDS 4.1.0, the user picker field suggestions do not work unless the permissions are set to \"Any customer or organization, by searching in this project\".\r\n * The customer having the global \"Browse users\" permission does not change this behavior.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n # Use the username of the user to be picked, rather than the email address (unless you're in\u00a0JIRA Service Desk\u00a03.16.+, step two is the only viable workaroud).\r\n # Change the Service Desk's Request Security/Customer permissions to \"Any customer or organization, by searching in this project\" to allow the suggestions to work in user picker fields.",

Why this is important\r\n \r\nWhile this is not inherently a bug and is intended behavior, there could be improvements in the logging or messaging that is provided to the user, since it isn't necessarily clear that the resulting behavior is that a new issue is created, rather than the email being rejected outright. This could be done in the application logging, or via clearer errors/warnings in the UI project permissions. \r\n",

But, from the feedback we've received so far, we understand that this method doesn't work for all teams. To help us improve this experience in the future, we're changing this bug to a feature request so we can continue to gather feedback.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\n\u2014 JIRA Service Desk Team\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n----\r\nh3.

Problem Definition:\r\n\r\nAt the moment for JIRA Service Desk 3.3, on the page, that is a message that a satisfaction feedback will be sent out when an issue is resolved. But, there is no information about the prerequisite that it comes out with \"Request Resolved\" notification and only Service Desk generated notifications.\r\n\r\nThen, for JIRA Service Desk prior to 3.3, the documentation did not mention that the feature only works for JIRA Service Desk generated notifications. Hence, if the \"JSD Global Notification\" option is disabled in which the option is not available anymore on version 3.3, the Satisfaction Feedback would not be included even though it is enabled.\r\n - [Collecting Customer Notification|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/SERVICEDESKSERVER031/Collecting+customer+satisfaction+%28CSAT%29+feedback]\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution:\r\n\r\nFor the settings in version 3.3, a message which mentions that the \"Request Resolved\" notification is needed will be great. While the documentation on the previous version is updated that mentions it only works for JIRA Service Desk generated notifications.\r\nh3.

Problem\r\nThe Default service desk project configuration documentation is outdated. \r\nhttps://confluence.atlassian.com/display/SERVICEDESKSERVER033/Default+service+desk+project+configuration\r\n\r\nThe title may also need to be changed to \"Default JIRA Service Desk project configuration\" \r\n\r\nh3. Details of problem\r\n\r\nh5. Database tables: \r\n\r\nThe article includes database tables and this list is incomplete. Example missing would be AO_C7F17E_LINGO added in 3.3. Approvals are another example of missing tables. \r\n* The other content on the page appears to be things that are unlikely to change between versions. The database tables do change as new features are released.\r\n\r\nh5. Custom Fields\r\n\r\nThe list of custom fields is outdated.\r\n* Other fields are included with JSD install, for example \"Request Participants\"\r\n* Creation of JSD projects results in the creation of additional custom fields. For example creating IT Service Desk project will create 17 custom fields if they do not already exist. Example field \"Product Categorization\"\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\nIt is great to have the list of database tables that are related to JSD. In addition the custom fields need to be updated. \r\n\r\nIf it will be difficult to keep this updated I suggest moving this to be a KB article so that support can assist with maintaining this. A link to the KB article could be placed on the documentation page.\r\n\r\n\r\n ",

Summary\r\n\r\nWhen there are multiple approvers added in a transition, users will not receive any notification until all approvers have approved the transition. It would be useful to have notifications to be sent out when each of them approves, so that the users would know exactly who has/has not approved without logging in to the customer portal or JSD.\r\n\r\nh3. Suggestion\r\n\r\nJSD should fire a system event, ie Issue Approved. So that JSD admin can customize who should receive the notification in the notification scheme.",

Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Create a workflow for your project that has the states \"Waiting for Support\", \"Waiting for Customer\" and \"Resolved\"\r\n ## The initial state of the workflow should be \"Waiting for Support\"\r\n ## The end state of the Workflow should be \"Resolved\"\r\n ## A transition from \"Waiting for Support\" to \"Waiting for Customer\" has to exist\r\n # Create an SLA that\r\n\r\n ## Starts when the request enters status \"Waiting for Customer\"\r\n ## Pauses when the request is in status \"Waiting for Support\"\r\n ## Stops when the request enters status \"Resolved\"\r\n # Create an automation rule\r\n\r\n ## When comment is added to an issue\r\n ## Then transitions issue from \"Waiting for support\" to \"Waiting for Customer\r\n # Create a new request that uses the above workflow\r\n # Send an email to the system that will\r\n ## Trigger a comment on the request\r\n ## Add participants to the request\r\n\r\nh3.

This is noted as a bad idea since it messes with satisfying SLAs \u2013 especially when the SLAs may include conditions such as \"Comment: For customer\".\r\n\r\nOf course, there's also the point that when raising an issue into an organization, which of the members of this organization should be assigned or receiving notifications about this issue?\r\n\r\nI don't think this is a rare or even obscure use case so maybe it could become a priority?\r\n\r\nA workaround that we're working with is creating an internal user part of the organization only used by the agents with which we can raise issues.

Problem Definition\r\nNewly created portal users through Google Apps Sync do not come with any organization as default. You can only choose an organization if inserting the customer directly to a project. Being able to automatically assign them to a default organization would resolve this.\r\n\r\n\r\nh4. Suggested Solution\r\nIt would be good to automate user's creation by adding a default organization. So you can choose which SD Projects this user will be able to access by adding this organization to those projects.\r\n\r\nh4. Workaround\r\nOnly way to give access to a SD project as default is by creating sync users as portal only(by not giving any application access) and changing customer permissions to \"Anyone with an account on this JIRA Site\"\r\n",
