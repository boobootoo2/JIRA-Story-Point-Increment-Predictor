In RP1 you include two projects, Pr1 and Pr2.\n# Then you create a Sprint, named S1\n# In RP1, you drag and drop issues from both Pr1 and Pr2 to S1.\n# Unlike the classic Planning Board (where issues are actually transferred into versions of the actual one project they are related to), issues are only transferred into S1. This is visible on the bottom right part of the issue in JIRA (under the Agile section)\n# In RP1, you can click on Report and then, instead of Sprint Report, select Cumulative Flow Diagram. This depicts the Cumulative Flow Diagram for S1 (and can act as a temporary workaround) but:\n# This is something you cannot have in the GreenHopper Cumulative Flow Chart Dashboard Gadget (also Wallboard capable) as you can only select a version, not a sprint.\n\nQuestion: Shouldn't the Cumulative Flow Chart Gadget be able to work with Sprints instead of versions only?{color}",

Confirm that the status options are not part of my workflow.\n6)  Drag any of these invalid status options to the unmapped columns area and they simply disappear.. thus re-affirming to me that they should not have been there.\n\nSo it appears the bug is that In order to create additional boards that share the same project the user has to go fix the column mappings.

Stability\n\nI would like GreenHopper API to follow the same rules JIRA API follows. Backward-incompatible changes would advance major API version; forward-incompatible changes would advance minor API version; implementation details change would advance micro version.\n\nI would suggest that unlike JIRA, GreenHopper API have its own version number, independent from GreenHopper plugin version. This will allow you to advance API version in minor releases - but it will be an explicit, visible change (which hopefully you'd mention in the Release Notes).\n\n2. Usability\n\nRight now we have to extract GreenHopper classes and instances with reflection, because there's no compile-time artifact that we can depend on. The API should be a separate artifact that both GreenHopper main body and the outside plugin can depend on. \n\nThis artifact should have its own versioning (see above) and be published along with the sources for the API -- before or at the same time GreenHopper version using that API version is released.\n\nThanks for listening!\n",

      "description": "When JIRA is behind the firewall and if the Greenhopper feedback module is enabled it throws javascript exceptions. This could be handled as a feature to have a global configuration which indicates to JIRA that internet connection should not be attempted (including UPM probably).\n\n{panel:title=Atlassian Status as at 28th August 2012| borderStyle=solid| borderColor=#ccc| titleBGColor=#49BD5F| bgColor=#E7F4FA}\nWe hardened this code in GreenHopper 5.10.6 so that most users should not see errors of this sort. \n\nWe've further hardened the code in the forthcoming GreenHopper 6.0.2. Once GreenHopper 6.0.2 is released all users will be able to upgrade to this version and be assured these errors are resolved. \n\nThank you.\n\nRegards,\nShaun Clowes\n{panel}",

Instead, we can bind the change handler for the marker class only, and avoid this work.\n** We can speed up the marker change handler through performing a check on current issue position vs. old issue position, and doing an incremental update.

      "description": "When planning a SCRUM sprint across multiple projects (using the new Rapid-board), it would be very nice to be able to highlight issues related to the different projects, similar to what can be done in the Agile Task Board today. The Highlight feature could be based on filters, similar to the Quick Filter functionality, but instead of filtering out and only showing the issues that match the filter, it would be more practical to filter by highlighting the issues matching the filter.\nThe reason for this is that when prioritizing the backlog, I need to prioritize issues across projects. If I use the QuickFilters today to only see issues from one specific project, and then start to reorganize the order of the issues, I have no control of how the reordering affects the other projects. By leaving all issues in the list and just highlighting the issues belonging to one filter, I will still be able to maintain control of the order also between the projects.",
