While you can now create subtasks, there is no mechanism within Next-gen to convert subtasks into Stories  NOR is there a way to convert existing stories / tasks into a subtask issue type.\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\nIt would help to have the option to \r\n* Convert To Subtask\r\nand\r\n* Convert subtask to Story (or other standard issue type)\r\n\r\nh3. Why this is important\r\nThe inability to convert such issue types makes it really tedious to recreate issues.  Sometimes a subtask becomes more complex of an issue and in turn is deserving to be it's own issue outside the bounds of that parent Story.  \r\nIn next gen you have to recreate the entire issue as a type of story, whereas in Classic projects, you can just use the convert option in the ... or More menu in order change this issue type without having to create the issue.\r\n\r\n",

However please keep in mind that it is using an internal endpoint not officially documented/supported and this workaround might stop working without prior notice:\r\n\r\nSend a POST  request to the REST API endpoint https://INSTANCE.atlassian.net/rest/internal/simplified/1.0/projects/PROJECT-ID/issues/EPIC-ID/children providing a list of issue-ids in the request body.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n- IDs of the issues to be updated: 10405, 10203\r\n- Project ID: 10303\r\n- Epic ID: 10519\r\n- Curl command to set the Epic (10519) as a parent to the desired issues (10405 ,10203). Please replace all the things in CAPITAL with the proper values:\r\n{noformat}\r\ncurl -D- -u EMAIL:API_TOKEN -H \"Accept: application/json\" -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d '{ \"issueIds\" : [\"ISSUE-ID-1\", \"ISSUE-ID-2\"] }' -X POST https://INSTANCE.atlassian.net/rest/internal/simplified/1.0/projects/PROJECT-ID/issues/EPIC-ID/children\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nIn order to get the list of issue-id to update you can:\r\n# Run a search to get the list of issues to update\r\n# Switch to the list view\r\n# Select to display only the issue-key column and export to CSV current columns only. This way you get a CSV file that only contains issue-key and issue-id. You can parse this file in many different ways to just  get a coma separated list of issue-ids surrounded by double quotes\r\n\r\nFor details on how to authenticate REST API calls using API TOKENS please refer to the  [API tokens|https://confluence.atlassian.com/cloud/api-tokens-938839638.html] documentation page.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
