But, as opposed to the description, it doesn't mounts the EBS volume (the one mounted last time) and creates a fresh EBS from the snapshot.\r\n\r\nThis makes sense for those using many agents configuration, but, for several developers with a single agent license, the same EBS volume must be used instead on creating a fresh one every time.\r\n\r\nI mean that there should be an option for this at least. Currently, I assume the process is as follows:\r\n\r\n1) Create a EBS volume from the snapshot (snapshotId is provided in configuration) and get its volumeId.\r\n2) Mount the volumeId to the new instance.\r\n\r\nI propose that it should be modified as:\r\n1) Ask for a snapshotId and a EBS volumeId(s) in elastic bamboo instance configuration and keep those in record.\r\n2) Launch a new instance and check if a volumeId provided is valid and not mounted already, and if its free, mount it to the new instance and if none of the volumeId(s) is valid and free, create a new volume from the snapshotId, get newly created volumeId and mount it.\r\n3) Optional: Update the newly created volumeId in record (array) for reuse.\r\n\r\nI think the option to reuse the existing EBS volume (the same which was used last time) may be provided easily in the elastic bamboo, at least for those using a single instance and this will be of great help for many customers.\r\n\r\nThis issue is same as https://studio.atlassian.com/browse/JST-3293 and the one that is irrelevant may be closed.\r\n\r\nThanks & Regards\r\n",

However, this option is not available when configuring the equivalent field for a Job.\r\nIs there a reason for that? Or is this a bug?\r\nDoes anyone have an answer as to why the 'Mercurial Web Repository' option is not available when configuring a Job? (whereas it is for a Plan)\r\nAha - I see what the issue is - when you're configuring a Plan, the 'Web Repository' field does not appear to be validating your selected repository and the 'Mercurial Web Repository' option appears no matter what repository type you select.\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nChai:\r\n{quote}\r\nAh okay. That sounds like a bug\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nGiles:\r\n{quote}\r\nYeah - I thought so - fyi - the Job configuration page appears to be working okay in this regard.\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nWorth investigating.

Result shows nested \"\"-s and commit fails with errorcode 1. See previous posts for log example.\r\nI added also : \"Verbose logs: true \" for Mercurial repository configuration. I see in configuration that : \"This Job will use all Repository settings from the plan\".\r\nUnfortunately, I cannot see any extra verbosity nor debug info. Can I somehow turn on additional debugging? How?\r\nI also tried separately, giving several release specific parameters (version etc.) as arguments, result is the same.\r\n\r\nIf my config seems enough/OK then I think this is a real {color:red}blocker issue{color}.\r\n\r\nBy the way, if Maven plugin (\"release:prepare\" for example) expects some command line input from user then Bamboo Agent keeps on waiting for that input and cannot be killed / shut down / disabled without Bamboo server restart. This can be tested if you add Maven builder goal \"release:prepare\" and run it.\r\n\r\ngood luck",

Now Bamboo deletes the files and does a new checkout. In our case this has taken 4 hours. (Because it is a big project and because the build server was heavily used)\r\nBut this would be a lot faster if Bamboo could use SVN switch in stead of the clean checkout. SVN switch would take as long as a normal SVN update. (With SVN switch you can switch the sources from one branch to another) in stead of new checkout.\r\nSo my question is: can we somehow use SVN switch?",

      "description": "Emails sent by jira are mime/multipart-alternative.  This means they contain multiple versions of the email as appropriate for different software or human consumers.\r\n\r\nAs is common, the two versions are text/html and text/plain.\r\n\r\nThe html version is typically used more commonly by more recently designed email clients, which incorporate (for better or worse) entire html rendering engines into their email display.  These emails look pretty reasonable when loaded into an html rendering program.\r\n\r\nThe plaintext version is used by software which does not incorporate html rendering, such as automated tools, text based mailers, or mailers configured to avoid the security issues of html rendering.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the plaintext version of the emails is not really plain text.  It's essentially marked up text that the user is expected to read past manually.  Here is an example of such an alert generated within atlassian's own bamboo install.\r\n\r\nNote that the urls, brackets of various sorts, and so on are from the original text, not added by any email client or other software.\r\n\r\nFurther note that these urls are not asides, after the relevant text, but inserted in the middle of statements, between subject and lists, which makes the text nearly impossible to read.\r\n\r\nIdeally all of the text within the brackets should not be produced, or should be produced entirely aside from the main email text.\r\n\r\nThe upshot, for me at least, is that all the bamboo reports here are useless, and I have to simply configure my mail routing to automatically delete them.\r\n\r\n[http://tardigrade.sydney.atlassian.com:8085/bamboo/images/jt/icn_plan_failed.gif]\r\nBAM-MAIN-8435<http://tardigrade.sydney.atlassian.com:8085/bamboo/browse/BAM-MAIN-8435/>\r\nfailed.\r\nCode has been updated by Brydie\r\nMcCoy<http://tardigrade.sydney.atlassian.com:8085/bamboo/browse/user/bmccoy>.\r\n3/1717 tests failed.\r\n\r\nCode\r\nChanges<http://tardigrade.sydney.atlassian.com:8085/bamboo/browse/BAM-MAIN-8435/commit>\r\nSee full change\r\ndetails<http://tardigrade.sydney.atlassian.com:8085/bamboo/browse/BAM-MAIN-8435/commit>[\r\nhttp://tardigrade.sydney.atlassian.com:8085/bamboo/images/icons/more.gif]\r\n[http://tardigrade.sydney.atlassian.com:8085/bamboo/images/icons/businessman.gif]\r\nBrydie McCoy<http://tardigrade.sydney.atlassian.com:8085/bamboo/browse/user/bmccoy>\r\nBAM-5955<http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/BAM-5955?page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.ext.bam\r\nboo%3Abamboo-build-results-tabpanel> Adding audit logging into creation services.\r\n(120644<https://atlaseye.atlassian.com/changelog/bamboo?cs=120644>)",
