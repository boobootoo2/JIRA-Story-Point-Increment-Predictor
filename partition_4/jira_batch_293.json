It happens for nearly every operation on an issue.  this happens even when there is no change to Rank.  This is confusing and just clutter.  See below for an example.\n2.  The value displayed currently in the JIRA change log for rank is meaningless - e.g. there is no Rank 219000000\n3.  When I do drag and drop rank an item, there is no change to the change history in JIRA for rank but the rank value does change ! :) \n\nThanks for listening and helping.\n\n-------------------\nChange by Joel Feldman - 11/Feb/08 12:36 PM  \nFix Version/s   Sprint 20-Red [ 10020 ]  \nRank  2190000000   \n\nChange by Joel Feldman - 11/Feb/08 01:22 PM  \nFix Version/s  Sprint 20-Red [ 10020 ]   \nRank  20000000 \n\nChange by Chris Brookins - 19/Feb/08 07:28 PM  \nSummary  78BL8Q ScheduleWizard: Clicking OK in Holidays form doesn't save the new business hours for the user  78BL8Q ScheduleWizard: Clicking OK in Holidays form doesn't save the new business hours for the user  \nRank  645000000  \n",

Or repeat steps #1-3 if I got the page # wrong.\n4) select drag and drop them to the right spot on the page - if that spot on the page is off-screen I need to drop and then scroll my window and repeat step 4.\n\n*Instead I'd prefer to do it in 1 drag step like MS Word allows for dragging text.* \ne.g. When I hover over a page number on a drag operation, switch to the target page BEFORE I drop, then I can drop exactly where I want.  Also when I drag items outside of the visible scrolling area of the page, the browser window should auto-scroll up / down depending on where my cursor is so I can drag and drop exactly where I want to.    This is just like what happens with MS Word and dragging some selected text.   As I drag outside the window, the window scrolls in the direction of my dragging.  And If I drag the text over a minimized window app in the task bar, the windows app opens to accept the text I am dragging so I can drop it there.  Greenhopper pages would operate like windows apps in this case, opening as I dragged over each page.\n\nAnother less elegant (but equally fast) option would be to have a modal \"Move\" button.  I select the items to Rank, click Move, and then find the page I want (by clicking on each page - no dragging), and then when found I click on the item that I want to move the items next to.  Like I said not as elegant, but faster and less error prone than how it is now :)\n",

Selecting this link on a project on which GreenHopper is not enabled simply takes you to the open issues tab. Now when you return to the dashboard the greenhopper link disappears from all projects, including the ones on which it is enabled. This is disconcerting as the link is inconsistent in how it appears.\n\nAdditionally, even though GreenHopper has only been enabled on a few projects, the planning board and task board links appear on the default dashboard. When selected, these links take me to a random project (I think the last one in alphabetical order, though I cant prove it). The behavior ought to be that if GreenHopper is not enabled, do not show these links on the default dashboard at all. Users can go into their project and then get into the planning board. That way users of projects in which GH is not enabled do not get confused by these links.",
