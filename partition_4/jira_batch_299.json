Eventually this may become cumbersome to navigate as different types of filters are created, and more options are added.\r\n\r\nSee Screenshot 1\r\n\r\n!image-2021-06-10-10-54-44-333.png|width=974,height=172!\r\n\r\n*Suggested State:*\r\n\r\nI would like to be able to group quick-filters, so that someone unfamiliar with Jira can better leverage these filters intuitively.\r\n\r\nSee Screenshot 2 (photoshopped)\r\n\r\n!image-2021-06-10-10-55-54-581.png|width=887,height=216!\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n*Configuration*: I suspect to handle custom naming, you could have a + button in the configuration quick filter page, allowing a user to add as many \"buckets\" as they would like, and assign a name to each.

Many of us are already hitting our automation limits monthly, and without the ability to simply purchase plans to increase automation limits, we're asked to double our Jira subscription costs.\u00a0\r\n\r\nWhile I understand that we can set rules for individual projects, this just isn't feasible when I have 100s of projects on a small team or 1000s for larger teams. One thing changes in that workflow and you're asking us to update 1000 individual rules.\u00a0\r\n\r\nPlease reconsider the current published solutions and offer better options for your users.\r\n\r\n!image-2021-05-28-08-35-38-800.png!",
