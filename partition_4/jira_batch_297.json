Summary\r\n\r\nWhen creating a Kanban project board and selecting the \"*Create a board >> Board from an existing project*\" option, the\u00a0default Jira filter in use *(project = <insert_pkey> ORDER BY Rank ASC)* is not correctly leveraged when in regards to the imported issue statuses that are associated to the board columns.\r\nh3. How to reproduce\r\n # On any project board page, choose 'Create Board'\r\n # Select 'Create Kanban Board'\r\n # Select 'Create a board >> Board from an existing project'\r\n # Fill in required fields for target project\r\n # 'Create Board'\r\n # Select 'Board Settings' of newly created board\r\n # Select 'Columns'\u00a0\r\n\r\nh3. Expected behavior\r\n\r\nWhen completing the actions above, the expected behavior is that *only statuses that are included on the target project* are added to the board columns.\u00a0\r\n\r\nLooking at the board settings a very basic JQL filter is created and leveraged in creating the board\u00a0*(project = <insert_pkey> ORDER BY Rank ASC).*\r\n\r\nThis would lead the user to believe that only statues leveraged in the target project 'Issue Types' and 'Workflow' should be added to the board. This is not the case.\u00a0\r\nh3. Observed behaviour\u00a0\r\n\r\nWhen creating the board, all statuses that are mentioned in the assigned project '*Workflow Scheme*' are added to the board. Not just those in the assigned project Workflow.\u00a0\r\n\r\nFor example ->\r\n\r\nIf a project leverages this Scheme:\r\n\r\n!JSWCLOUD-21893 - Ex. Scheme.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nBut, the project *does not* include all issue types included in that scheme:\r\n\r\n!JSWCLOUD-21893 - Ex.

Issue Summary\r\n\r\nWhen using a custom date range on your Plan, grouping the view by Sprint will cause the capacity indicator to be positioned outside of the actual scheduled dates.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n# Create a future Sprint on your Backlog and set the *Start date* and *End date* a month ahead of today (eg. start=05/Oct end=31/Oct)\r\n# Go to your Plan and set the grouping by Sprints\r\n# Change the date range to custom and set a *Relative* range of 3 months before and after today\r\n !date_range.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nThe Sprint capacity indicator should position the Sprint on the timeline coherent to its start and end date.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nThe Sprint capacity indicator is out of range. Take notice that the Sprint is scheduled for Oct yet we see it positioned in July on the timeline.\r\n\r\n !TST7_SCRUM_-_Advanced_Roadmaps_-_Jira.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\nh3.

This allows the version to be searched and added to issues.\u00a0\r\n\r\nHere are the prerequisites for this bug to be triggered:\r\n # A version is initially not in an *archived* state.\r\n # A full view of an issue should be open in a browser tab at the time the version is still not in an\u00a0*archived* state.\r\n # Once the version has been archived, the browser page of the issue should not be refreshed. And then select the *archived* version (either from the\u00a0*unreleased* section or the\u00a0*recent* *versions* section). This action triggers the archived version to be 'saved' in the\u00a0*recent versions* section and then can be used in other issues.\u00a0\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nThere can be several ways to reproduce this.\r\n\r\n*Replication # 1*\r\n # On the Release list page, create a version with a start date and end date of your choice.\r\n # Create an issue and open it in a new browser tab. (Let's call this issue A).\r\n # Check the\u00a0*Recent Versions*\u00a0section of the\u00a0*Fix Versions*\u00a0field and you will find the created version. (Do not refresh this page.)\r\n # Go back to the\u00a0*Release*\u00a0list page and archive the created version.\r\n # Go to issue A's browser tab and select the archived version from the\u00a0*Recent Versions*\u00a0section of the\u00a0*Fix Versions*\u00a0field. (This 'saves' the archived version on the *Recent Versions* that allows it to be used by other issues).\r\n # Create another ticket and open it in a new tab. (Let's call this issue B).\r\n # Select the archived version from the\u00a0*Recent Versions*\u00a0section of the\u00a0*Fix Versions*\u00a0field.\r\n\r\n*Replication # 2*\r\n # In the Release list of your project, create a version with a start date and end date of your choice.\r\n # Create an issue using the Create button (Let's call this issue A).\r\n # Select 5-6 other versions in the Fix versions field (that is not what you created in step#1) for issue A. This is to replace all the versions under the *Recent versions* section for the Fix versions field dropdown menu.\r\n # Create another issue and open it in full view in a new browser tab. (Let's call this issue B)\r\n # In the *Fix versions* field, observe that the version created in step#1 is no longer in *Recent versions*, but only under the *unreleased* version section only of issue B. Do not refresh this page.\r\n # Go back to the Release list, in the same browser tab you used for Step # 1.\r\n # Archive the version you created.\r\n # Go to the tab you have for issue B and select the archived version. The archive version should only be visible under the *unreleased versions* in the Fix versions field dropdown menu.\u00a0(This 'saves' the archived version on the *Recent Versions* that allows it to be used by other issues).\r\n # Create another issue and open it in full view in a new browser tab. (Let's call this issue C)\r\n # In the *Fix versions* field of issue C, observe that the archived version is in the *Recent versions* section and can be selected.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n * Archived versions should no longer be visible in the Fix Version field menu of any issue.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n * The archived version is still visible in the *Fix Version* field of an issue, under the *Recent versions*.\r\n * The archived version selected could not be removed from the fix version field.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nTo prevent the bug to be triggered:\r\n * If there were open issues in your browser tabs before a version is *archived*, refresh these browser pages. This will remove the archived version from the\u00a0*Fix Version*\u00a0field and will prevent you as a user to select this *archived* version.\u00a0In the below steps, I added the{color:#00875a} *refresh the page* {color}action on Step # 5 which should prevent the bug to be triggered.\r\n\r\n # On the Release list page, create a version with a start date and end date of your choice.\r\n # Create an issue and open it in a new browser tab. (Let's call this issue A).\r\n # Check the\u00a0*Recent Versions*\u00a0section of the\u00a0*Fix Versions*\u00a0field and you will find the created version.\r\n # Go back to the\u00a0*Release*\u00a0list page and archive the created version.\r\n # Go to issue A's browser tab and\u00a0{color:#00875a}*refresh the page.*{color}\u00a0You will no longer find the archived version under the\u00a0*Recent Versions*\u00a0section of the\u00a0*Fix Versions*\u00a0field for this issue B.\u00a0\r\n\r\nIf\u00a0the bug was already triggered and you can see the archived version from the *recent versions*\u00a0section of the *Fix Versions*\u00a0field, we can remove it from the selection by performing the following:\r\n # In any issue in the same project that is not using the archived version, choose 5 versions for the Fix versions field (other than the archived version that is visible). This step will remove the archived version from the *Recent versions* section because it will be replaced by those versions you selected.\u00a0\r\n # Revert the Fix versions field of the issue to its original value.\r\n\r\n\u00a0",
