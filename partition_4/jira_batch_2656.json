This all seems to work fine and my builds do get run properly when I commit to master.\r\n\r\nHowever, I ALSO appear to get builds running when a branch is first created/pushed to the Git repository.

Plus, even if we limit the forest to a few key git repos, linked to the Crucible project, Crucible is still not able to anchor patches properly.\r\n\r\nThis is ultimate a problem in JIRA as well. You can manually sustain 300 app links to the 300 git repos in an Android forest.\r\n\r\nThe atlassian tools as a whole, need a completely new feature for dealing with a group of source code repos or a \"forest\". So that we can point Bamboo, or Crucible or JIRA to an Android style forest of Git repos and expect the tools to do something reasonable.\r\n\r\nI'm guessing other companies are running into this sort of thing as well, I see this as an important feature for Atlsasian to be part of the Android develpment environment.\r\n\r\nYou can find out more about the repo command here:\r\n\r\n[http://source.android.com/source/version-control.html]\r\n",

What exactly remembered by Bamboo to checkout - branch name (as it is configured and supposed to be) or explicit commit in this branch?\r\n\r\nThe problem is following (as illustrated on the attached image, timeline is up to down):\r\n\r\n- You have few branch plans configured as Gatekeepers for an integration branch (let's call it next).\r\n- Developer A pushes his changes into personal branch, Bamboo checkouts next (X), merges A's changes into it, and starts building it (X+A).\r\n- While it is building, Developer B does the same for his branch, and build B is queued.\r\n- After the plan A completes, Bamboo pushes updated integration branch (next) to Gitolite server (X+A to Y, fast forward).\r\n- Bamboo takes queued build B and checkouts integration branch (next) to do the same.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that on that step Bamboo 4.4.0 checkouts not NEW state of the integration branch with just pushed changes (Y on the image to build Y+B), but that commit in the next which was last when the build B was queued (X). As result, it attempts to push back non fast-forward updates (X+B), and since they are disabled on Gitolite, the push fails. In fact, this makes impossible to use this feature because too many pushes fail if you have active committers.\r\n\r\nAs I understand, it should checkout next by the branch name to its current state with just pushed updates, not an older commit (we configure branch by name, not a single commit). Then there will be no such problem since all commits into the integration branch will be fast-forward.\r\n\r\nIn short, it should be:\r\nX+A -> Y (fast forward)\r\nY+B -> Z (fast forward)\r\nAnd only Bamboo updates next branch, that guarantees FF only updates.\r\n\r\nCurrently it is:\r\nX+A -> Y (fast forward)\r\nX+B -> Z (non fast forward, FAILS)\r\nX is chosen because it was last when B was detected and build queued. But we should merge with next branch (its HEAD), not with some commit in the past.",

Running 100 agents we have teams who want the capability auto-detection and do not want to manage the capabilities at all; and also teams who want explicit control of specifying their agents' capabilities using a bamboo-capabilities.properties file. It seems that if the agent allows the use of an agent-side bamboo-capabilities.properties file then it should also allow use of the DISABLE_AGENT_AUTO_CAPABILITY_DETECTION flag, or else what is the point of the bamboo-capabilities.properties file?\r\n\r\nh4.

From what I've seen and from an Atlassian response on Answer : https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/139244/bamboo-wallboards-extension there doesn't seem to be an plugin point to add menu items to the Wallboards dropdown. Working with internal Agile teams in my company there has been significant growing demand for many different types of Wallboards displaying all kinds of Bamboo data. Right now someone would have to add a link next to the Current Activity menu that displays a page listing all the Wallboards they have created. This looks very duplicative since there is a big Wallboard icon/dropdown visible as well. It would help keep the UI much cleaner if the Wallboard dropdown allowed plugin points.",

The fly in the ointment is that the available dependency build triggers only go up the chain, not down.\r\n\r\nFor example, given a chain consisting of:\r\n\r\n  com.example.lib.core          COREBUILD\r\n  com.example.lib.coolstuff     COOLBUILD  (depends on lib.core)\r\n  com.example.lib.niftystuff    NIFTYBUILD (depends on lib.core and coolstuff)\r\n  com.example.lib.moneystuff    MONEYBUILD (depends on lib.core)\r\n  com.example.srv.happysrv      HAPPYBUILD (depends on lib.coolstuff, niftystuff and moneystuff)\r\n\r\nIf there's a change in the repository to niftystuff, I have the option to delay the building of NIFTYBUILD until its parents, COREBUILD and COOLBUILD, have completed building of any unbuilt changes.  This ensures that NIFTYBUILD is extra nifty by incorporating any pending changes from the libraries that it depends on (lib.core and coolstuff).\r\n\r\nWhat I don't have is the additional option of having Bamboo complete the NIFTYBUILD based on the commit, and based on the dependency chain generated by the Maven Dependencies Processor, trigger the dependent/child HAPPYBUILD.  Even though one of its component libraries has changed, my normally happy server doesn't get rebuilt automatically unless I go into the manual dependency definition for each of its dependencies (COOLBUILD, NIFTYBUILD, MONEYBUILD), and add HAPPYBUILD as a child dependency.\r\n\r\n",

Since we have only single clean environment we have only single Agent running all jobs sequentially. But what I see is when multiple checkin happen the Stages across multiple branches get mixed up, thus resulting in the following run sequence where stages of one branch get mixed with stages of other branch.\r\n\r\nBranch 1, executes Stage 1\r\nBranch 2, executes Stage 1\r\nBranch 1, executes Stage 2\r\nBranch 2, executes Stage 2\r\nBranch 1, executes Stage 3\r\nBranch 2, executes Stage 3\r\n\r\nWith this work flow, the last job will definitely fail as it will never get a clean environment. Not sure if this is a bug, but I believe a build plan run should be atomic and isolated and is currently not the case.",
