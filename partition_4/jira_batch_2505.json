I&#x27;m pretty sure you know about this, but here is a related page: https://developer.apple.com/notifications/safari-push-notifications/\n\nI really need to know when my repo was changed by other members of my team, so I subscribed to Bitbucket notifications. And now I have full inbox of them. I don&#x27;t need to have an email. I just want to be notified that the repo was changed.\n\nIt would be awesome, if you can implement this.\n\nThank you in advance,\\\\\nDan Pristupov",

Instead, it would be nice to just say something about an Hg repo having been stripped back to HASH and a Git repo having a \"Reference to branch forced to SHA1\" or something along those lines. Showing the hashes of a Git repo can be a security issue for users who have accidentally pushed in a password considering you can just hack them into the URL.

Now I&#x27;ve decided that I want to group my feature branches not with a &#x27;dev/&#x27; prefix but with &#x27;feature/&#x27;, and I want to use a branch called &#x27;dev&#x27; as the integration branch with all finished changes.\n\nSo I merged and deleted all &#x27;dev/*&#x27; branches on Bitbucket and locally. I then created a local &#x27;dev&#x27; branch (branching off of the &#x27;master&#x27; branch). Now if I try to push this branch to Bitbucket (remote &#x27;origin&#x27;), I get the following error:\n\n{code}\n#!bash\n\n !

I am not aware of any method by which to actively remove this folder, either thru the web interface or with any git-remote command. I don&#x27;t know how often git-gc runs on Bitbucket and if it will fix this issue. If I use the web interface to create a new branch off of &#x27;master&#x27; directly in the Bitbucket repo, the error message says &#x27;Invalid branch name&#x27;.\n\nIt would be nice if Bitbucket could see that the &#x27;dev&#x27; branch name is in fact available.",
