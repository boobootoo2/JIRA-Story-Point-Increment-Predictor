      "description": "Hi - I&#x27;m curious if you&#x27;d be interested in adding a code type of \"epub\" for repositories.  It&#x27;s very similar to html/css, but is a particular file structure where a bunch of html, css, and xml files are zipped up into a package.  I&#x27;m a small publisher (bitingduckpress.com) and we&#x27;re finding that version control for epubs during book development and editing is tricky.\n\nI&#x27;m mostly on the technical side of things, and am trying to move the word-side of things to using git.  We&#x27;re just starting to do git version control using html/css (what all the epubs start out as) but it would be a nice feature to be able to stick an epub in a repo and track changes to the individual files.  It&#x27;s probably not a big market for you right now, but it&#x27;s got the potential for growth, as epub workflow and version control is pretty primitive right now.  A lot of people use Adobe Indesign, which is actually _much_ harder than working in a text editor and gives worse results (worse looking epubs with basic features missing).  We typically are working on 5-10 titles at a time, with 3-4 people passing around edits.  It&#x27;s the kind of thing that I&#x27;d eventually put together for myself, but have my hands full with the rest of building/maintaining the web store and running the business. It&#x27;s probably mostly a change to your source browser, so I&#x27;m flagging it there.\n\nThanks for at least reading this, and for offering a nice online service.\n\nchris lindensmith",

      "description": "Hi,\n\nThis summer I worked with Bitbucket for my previous employer. Your services are so great that I suggested to implement it for my current (new) employer.\n\nThe situation is that I migrated all the repos (about 180) from an old SVN-server to Bitbucket. Since I&#x27;m no longer employed by them, I got revoked from their group, thus no longer having access to their repositories.\n\nThe problem, now, is that I am still following all the repositories that I created, but I can&#x27;t see a way to unfollow them, because of the revoked access...\n\nIf you need more information, feel free to send me a message.\n\nCheers,\\\\\nAngelo",

AFAIK i&#x27;ve done recreation in the past sucessfully. But this time i couldn&#x27;t recreate it. So i created one in my own space and tried to tranfer it but this didn&#x27;t help either.\n\nI attached a screenshot which might provide some more context.\n\nCan you help here?\n\nI appologize for the priority but this is at least critical for us. The repository is highly used in \"hybris/puppet-modules\" and \"hybris/devop-vagrants\" as submodules and fiddling around with nested submodules on mercurial is expecially no fun, if repos get deleted and recreated (but it&#x27;s better than cloning large binaries for the next years ;-) )\n\nthanks\n\nKim Neunert",

I received a notification as an email. The only link in the email was listed as having a purpose of disabling notifications, so I didn&#x27;t want to click it. I started a reply-to, but the email was of the \"no-reply\" variety, so figured that was the wrong way to go.\n\nI browsed to the relevant bitbucket repos, but the activity didn&#x27;t list anything like the notification i had received. I clicked on the dropdown in the upper right corner, nothing about notifications. Click my profile, nothing involving notifications.\n\nI finally gave up trying to reply to the notification and looked up the user directly and saw a send message button. So, I message him. As soon as I messaged them I&#x27;m redirected to the \"Messages\" area which lists his original message that I received a notification about. I look at the URL and realize it matches the \"disabling\" link from the email. sigh. So, then I&#x27;m like there must be some way to get to this Messages area directly. I poke around. And eventually after scanning for it half a dozen times I realize it&#x27;s supposed to be the same as Inbox.\n\nSo, the email notification says nothing about Inbox or Messages. The Messages screen says nothing about Inbox, and none of the links in Bitbucket seem to point to Notifications or Messages.\n\nNow that I know these are the same things I&#x27;ll be ok, but would have been great if they used the same word.\n\nCheers,\\\\\nLaura",

This is fine and I was planning to just add aliases in bitbucket to bridge the gap. However, when setting up and alias in bitbucket the backslashes get converted to forward slashes when saving, so the new aliases don&#x27;t end up matching anything.\n\nThis is a minor bug but still annoying, especially when those usernames then get propagated to Bamboo.\n\nThanks",
