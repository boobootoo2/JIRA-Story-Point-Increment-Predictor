While the cloud version already has the functionality to set up approvals. I'm referring to [https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiracloud/configuring-jira-service-desk-approvals-815569154.html].\r\n\r\nWhat I would like to know, can you share your expectation when this function will be available?\r\nDo you also know what will be the version of the Service Desk with the functionality for setting up approvals? We are now on JIRA Service Desk 3.1.9.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance,\r\n\r\nBest Regards,\r\n\r\nWim van Oorspronk\r\n\r\n",

This would help engineers and PMs to quickly prioritize. Currently we can't tell the difference between P2 and P3s without navigating out of the epic or clicking into the defect which is time consuming when we have 10+ bugs.

They have been helpful in making the decision to prioritize this issue.\r\nWe are excited to announce that the capability to have a configurable number of Knowledgebase search results was shipped in 4.2.0.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\n- Jira Service Desk Team\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\n{panel:bgColor=#e7f4fa}\r\n*NOTE:* This suggestion is for *JIRA Service Desk Server*.

Problem Definition\r\n\r\nWhen you have Service Desk integrated with a Confluence Knowledge base you can see search results for related articles from within JIRA. However these search results appear to be limited to only 3 results in this view. Conversely looking at the confluence space directly results many more search results.\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if within the project configuration within Service Desk that you could customize the number of expected search results. At the moment this does not appear possible.\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nCurrent method of using the [Label restrictions|https://confluence.atlassian.com/servicedeskserver031/serving-customers-with-a-knowledge-base-802164866.html#Servingcustomerswithaknowledgebase-LabelsHowtosuggestarticlesforspecificrequesttypes] might be helpful in some cases, but it does not allow for more results to be displayed.",

Problem Definition\r\n\r\nAs per the [JIRA Service Desk 3.2.x Release Notes|https://confluence.atlassian.com/servicedesk/jira-service-desk-3-2-x-release-notes-830281732.html], it is currently not possible to upgrade directly from JIRA 6.4.x and Service Desk 2.5.9 to JIRA Core 7.2.x with JIRA Service Desk 3.2.x. Hence, customers running on JIRA 6.4.x will have to *upgrade twice, increasing their downtime* and also the upgrade effort to go to JIRA 7.2.x and JSD 3.2.x.\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nAs a JIRA administrator, I would like to be able to upgrade from JIRA 6.4.x and JSD 2.5.9 to JIRA 7.2 and JIRA Service Desk 3.2 directly so that I can perform a single upgrade.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nThe following [jira-config.properties|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/AdminJIRAServer070/Advanced+JIRA+application+configuration#AdvancedJIRAapplicationconfiguration-jira-config.propertiesThejira-config.propertiesfile] parameters can be used when upgrading from JIRA 6.4 to 7.0 and Service Desk 3.0:\r\n{code}\r\nupgrade.reindex.allowed=false\r\njira.autoexport=false\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nThis will cause the intermediate upgrade path ( JIRA 6.4 -> JIRA 7.0 -> JIRA 7.2 ) to occur much faster as JIRA performs an export and re-index normally as part of the upgrade which takes a long time in larger environments and is unnecessary for intermediate upgrade versions. These parameters can be removed when upgrading JIRA 7 to JIRA 7.2",

Description of problem:\r\n\r\nA NullPointerException is thrown due to a missing ICON_ID in \"AO_54307E_VIEWPORTFORM\".\r\n * JIRA Service Desk will not fully start if one of the affected request types is configured to receive email. This results in partial functionality working.\r\n * When JIRA Service Desk does start, users are unable to access some request types or service desk projects. In some cases the entire customer portal may not load.\r\n\r\nRequest types that are missing the ICON_ID are affected and portals containing those request types may experience problems. In addition, when configuring request types the \"Edit Fields\" link on affected request types no longer works.\r\n * The \"Edit Fields\" link does work for unaffected request types in the same service desk project.\r\n * The service desk project containing affected request type(s) will not load in customer portal. Users may see an error, a spinning icon, or a blank page.\r\n\r\nh2. Steps to reproduce:\r\n\r\nIt is unknown how this the data got into this state, the problem occurred on a customer's instance after starting JIRA Service Desk.\r\n * It is possible to trigger this problem and see the symptoms by setting the ICON_ID of a request type to be NULL.\r\n * In one case Service Desk logs of upgrade from version 2.5.9 > 3.1.9 > 3.2.1 do not show where \"SyncUpgradeTaskMigrateRequestTypeIconIDs\" ever ran.\r\n _NB: This task may have run previously in 3.1.x as AsyncUpgradeTaskMigrateRequestTypeIconIDs_\r\n\r\nh2. Expected Results\r\n\r\nJSD starts without any problems and after startup there are no issues accessing request types or portal.\r\nh2. Actual Results\r\nh6.

Workaround:\r\nh6. If JIRA Service Desk is accessible\r\n\r\nUse the SQL query to retrieve a list of affected request types. Manually change the icon for each of these request types in the Service Desk user interface.\r\nh6. If JIRA Service Desk failed to load\r\n\r\nThis was fixed by identifying there was a missing icon for the JIRA Service Desk customer portal. the broken icon was identified with the below SQL:\r\n{code:java}select \"ICON_ID\", a.* from \"AO_54307E_VIEWPORTFORM\" vpf left outer join avatar a on a.id = vpf.\"ICON_ID\" where a.id is null;\r\n\r\n{code}\r\nAnd then fixed by updating the database to point the icon to an existing icon (ie a record in the {{avatar}} table that exists), and then JSD was restarted and the Customer Portal updated.\r\nh2. Background:\r\n\r\nIn Service Desk Server version 3.1.9, icons attached to request types are recorded in the ICON column in \"AO_54307E_VIEWPORTFORM\".\r\n\r\nAs of 3.2.1 the icons are stored in the ICON_ID column, also in the \"AO_54307E_VIEWPORTFORM\" table.\r\n\r\nAn upgrade task performs this change\r\n{noformat}    *********************************************************************************\r\n    JIRA ServiceDesk v3.2.0-051 #DevVersion built 2016-08-26T20:02:10.216-05:00 - Starting sync upgrade task: SyncUpgradeTaskMigrateRequestTypeIconIDs\r\n    *********************************************************************************\r\n\r\n{noformat}",

Issue Summary\r\n\r\nAs soon as a user is added to an issue as an approver, that user is treated as a customer for the purposes of notifications, even if they're an agent. Unless they then remove themselves after approving a given issue, they'll miss out on receiving any subsequent internal notifications.\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Create an issue that has an approval process.\r\n # Add a user that is an Agent as an approver.\r\n # Get the issue to the approval step.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nThe user receives the approval notifications, and also the agent notifications.\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nThe user is being considered a customer and only receives customer notifications.\r\nh3. Workarounds\r\n* Enable Service Desk to send both Jira and Customer notifications when the user is an agent. This can be done by going to Jira Administration > Applications, option Configuration, scroll down and change the _Notification_ setting to \"Yes, send customers both Jira Service Desk and Jira Notifications\" !screenshot-1.png|thumbnail!\r\n* Have the approvers remove themselves from the Approvers list.\r\n\r\nOriginal description:\r\n{quote}As soon as a user is added to an issue as an approver, that user is treated as a customer for the purposes of notifications, even if they're an agent. Unless they then remove themselves after approving a given issue, they'll miss out on receiving any subsequent internal notifications.\r\n\r\nThe use case here is when a customer is set as an approver and merely replies via email saying \"This is approved\" but doesn't visit the portal to actually click the Approve button. The agent can add herself to the Approvers field and manually approve it to transition the issue through the workflow.\r\n{quote}",

Summary\r\nThe [Pagination|https://docs.atlassian.com/jira-servicedesk/REST/3.1.4/#pagination] used in JIRA Service Desk REST API does not return consistent results\r\n\r\nh3. Environment\r\nJIRA Service Desk REST API\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Create a GET request for Customer Requests\r\n{code:borderStyle=solid}\r\n<baseURL>/rest/api-name/resource-name?start=0&limit=100\r\n{code}\r\n# Observe the \"size\" from the result\r\n{code:borderStyle=solid|title=Results}\r\n  \"size\": 76,\r\n  \"start\": 0,\r\n  \"limit\": 100,\r\n  \"isLastPage\": true,\r\n{code}\r\n# Change the {{start}} to a higher value and re-send the GET request\r\n# {code:borderStyle=solid}\r\n<baseURL>/rest/servicedeskapi/request?start=20&limit=100\r\n{code}\r\n# Observe the \"size\" from the result\r\n{code:borderStyle=solid|title=Results}\r\n  \"size\": 36,\r\n  \"start\": 20,\r\n  \"limit\": 100,\r\n  \"isLastPage\": true,\r\n{code}\r\n# Change the {{start}} to a higher value and re-send the GET request\r\n# {code:borderStyle=solid}\r\n<baseURL>/rest/servicedeskapi/request?start=30&limit=100\r\n{code}\r\n# Observe the \"size\" from the result\r\n{code:borderStyle=solid|title=Results}\r\n  \"size\": 16,\r\n  \"start\": 30,\r\n  \"limit\": 100,\r\n  \"isLastPage\": true,\r\n{code}\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nFrom the above example, Pagination should return 56 and 46 respectively\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nReturned values are not 56 and 46 respectively\r\n \r\nh3. Notes\r\nJIRA Service Desk REST API is still an experimental release as per [this comment|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSD-107?focusedCommentId=853509&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#comment-853509]\r\n\r\nh3.Workaround\r\nIt seems that the Servicedesk api code actually skips \u201cstart\u201d parameter amount of entires twice. So, if you add start=10, its actually doing start=20 internally. If you say start=100, its actually doing start=200.\r\nIn order to get it working correctly, you would need to use half of the value of the start parameter that you intend to use. For instance, I tried this :\u00a0\r\n\u00a0{noformat}http://localhost:8080/jira792/rest/servicedeskapi/request?start=0&limit=10{noformat}\r\nand then\r\n{noformat}http://localhost:8080/jira792/rest/servicedeskapi/request?start=5&limit=10{noformat}",
