      "description": "*Brief*\nAs a scrum master, I have the task of putting together the next sprint. As we have so many stories to choose from, I need a way for myself and the product owner to sit down and see all these stories in one place and organise some kind of priority that can then help me put a sprint together.\n\nI currently use a physical card wall for this task where I have all the story cards posted, grouped by the next couple of sprints then the rest as a backlog underneath. the cards are also grouped by component from left to right on the wall.\n\nI would rather use GreenHopper to help me achieve, we already use it for tracking the current sprint quite successfully but find it difficult to prioritise the backlog by just looking at one long list or one version or component at a time. \n\nI have created a mock of what I think the card wall view in greenhopper could look like. Please find attached two PDF's one with and the other without comments\n\n*Conditions of satisfaction*\n* the issues are laid out in a grid view as cards, similar to the way sub tasks on the task board\n* the cards should display in rank order with the highest priority listed at the top\n* you can drag stories up and down to change its rank, highest is most priority similar to regular planning board view\n\n* the cards should be grouped by version\n* versions are displayed in date order with the earliest version listed highest and the latest at the bottom along with an unscheduled group.\n* i can choose how many issues i see on a page, per version and column before it paginates\n* I can hide versions I don't want to deal with. We use versions for tracking sprints and releases and I am only interested in organising new sprints so want to hide the release versions\n\n* I can see how many story points are currently in a version\n* I can set a limit on how many story points should be in each version which would be the team's velocity\n* If a version has too many story points in it then it should clearly indicate this so issues can be manually moved\n\n* you can drag stories between versions and it automatically adjusts the fixVersion\n* when the fix version is updated, it only removes the previous version and adds the new one, leaving any onther versions that story was part of, still there.\n\n* It should be possible to arrange the issues into columns\n* I can choose to arrange the columns by Component, assignee or just one big column\n* I can reorder the columns to put the most important components or assignees first, furthest left, and the least important further right\n\n* I can choose to center the view around story points or ideal hours when dealing with velocity, I personally would use story points\n* the story point value or ideal hours of each card is clearly visible\n* I can quickly set the team's velocity in bulk for all future versions so I can get an idea if more or less issues can be added to future versions\n\n* there should be a minimum width of each column so that the issues remain readable, and a horizontal scrollbar should allow you have more columns than can fit on the screen at the same time\n* the version should remain on the screen when scrolling horizontally so you never forget which versions your looking at",

It will also help save space since the alternative today is having both \"Show Epic\" and \"Hide Epic\"\n\nHaving coloured background on the buttons will also visualize the active filters even more. Today it is easy to see that it is an active filter when focused on, but when focus is further down the page it may be easily overlooked.\n",

No thinking was required.\n\nIn 4.4.1, that obvious, single-click mechanism for exiting the detail view seems to have been lost.\n\nWorkarounds:\n\n* Use the browser back button to step back until finding the planning or task board.\n* Find the \"Agile\" tab in the middle top, click it. This sends you back to the same board but the first page. Navigate back to the original page.\n* Find \"More Actions\" button in the vast middle, click it, look for \"Planning Board\" or \"Task Board, think about which one we were at before, click it.\n\nAm I missing something?
