[See the corresponding bug report|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSWSERVER-10988].\n  {panel}\n\nIn the \"Agile Sprint Health Gadget\", JIRA displays our team's user avatars and allows us to click on them to see who's doing what this sprint--which is great!  However, some users have usernames containing spaces (e.g. \"big doggie\").  Clicking on these users causes the search to fail with the following error:\n\n{{Error in the JQL Query: Expecting either 'OR' or 'AND' but got 'doggie'. (line 1, character 16)}}\n\nThe query in the search box is:\n\n{{assignee=big doggie AND Sprint=18}}\n\nand the URL leading to that page is:\n\nhttps://whatever.atlassian.net/secure/IssueNavigator.jspa?reset=true&jqlQuery=assignee=big%20doggie%20AND%20Sprint=18\n\nThe issue is probably easily solvable by changing the URL to always include quotes around the {{assignee}} parameter, e.g. {{assignee=%22big%20doggie%22}} or whatever.  You guys may have some other considerations that make that unfeasible, though.\n\nThe specific version of JIRA is JIRA v6.4-OD-02-003\n\nThanks!",

      "description": "It is naturally expected that if you don't have \"Parallel Sprints\" enabled, it should be impossible to have Multiple Active sprints showing up on the same board. However, this is not the case. There is a reproducible scenario, in which multiple active sprints will appear in a JIRA Agile board eventhough Parallel Sprints are not turned on, and this could cause some confusion for users.\n\n*Steps to reproduce*\n* Ensure Parallel Sprints are turned off on your JIRA Agile instance\n* Configure two boards, one a subset of the other, but both pointing to the same project:\n**  Board A's filter could be: \"Project = XYZ ORDER BY Rank ASC\"\n** Board B's filter could be: \"Project = XYZ AND issuetype = bug ORDER BY Rank ASC\"\n* Start a sprint on Board A, made of stories/tasks but not including any issues of bug issuetype (It is important to not include any issuetype bug to the first sprint in Board A at this point so you dont automatically start a sprint in Board B whose filter includes the bug issuetype)\n* At this point Board A has one active sprint, and board B has none.\n* Now start a sprint in Board B.\n\n*Result*\n* The Sprint started in Board B is also added to Board A which already has one active sprint. Causing multiple active sprints in Board A.\n\n*Remarks*\n* It is recommended that each Project have it's own JIRA Agile board, and this scenario will not come up under this configuration. However, certain customer's usecases may cause them to have different teams sharing a project, while each team has their own board (https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/GHS-5410 - Again, the recommended usage here is to ensure that each team's board returns a unique set of issues - otherwise you would experience this issue at some point and the results may not be desirable)\n* I have not raised this as a bug, because the behavior is not necessarily incorrect (although it's confusing). The configuration of both board's filters suggests that Board A is a Parent Board for Board B, which causes sprints from the child board to show in the parent.\n* Why is this confusing? Well, for most users, this result is not what they intended at all. Users of Board B for instance may be unaware that there is another board with configuration as Board A. Even if they are aware, they may not be thinking that their action of starting a sprint in their board has started a sprint on someone else's board.\n\n*Suggestion*\n I guess this scenario can be handled better by JIRA Agile, if atleast a message at the top of Board A automatically shows up whenever this scenario has led to multiple active sprints. Explaining to all board users, how they came across the other active sprints (perhaps mentioning who started the sprint or from which board they were started). Even something as simple as the following will help:\nbq. \"You are currently having multiple active sprints on this board. This may be because you have other boards whose filters are a subset of this board's filter, active sprints from those other boards will automatically show up here.\"",

I have Scrum teams that each have a _primary_ pillar, but that can perform work on any pillar during any sprint based on the company's goals at any given time. \n\nEach scrum team, while potentially working on the same application as a different team, is it's own stand-alone body, complete with DB Devs, App Devs, QA-Testers, DevOps, and Product Owners.\n\nThe problem I have is, since teams aren't isolated to Pillars, we generally have a larger unified backlog that serves the whole department, and we use quick filters to show pillar specific tasks if a team is only going to work within a specific pillar.\n\nI have a unique sprint for each team, in order to track velocity, capacity, and success on an individual team level. This is because they estimate on within their own team.  Thus, Velocity should be unique among teams.\n\nUnfortunately, Since each scrum board must include issues from every Pillar (i.e. Jira Project) since a team can work within any of them, the Velocity report shows ALL sprints, rather than just the ones for the Team I'm interested in.\n\nI currently have no way to \"tie sprints together\".   I *could* filter each board by a ticket field, but this would mean I need to manage that field for _every_ ticket.  ANNOYING.  Thus, the Sprint label would simply this process.\n ",

Many users would like the sprint field to be cleared out or at least to be notified  by the system that this issue is going to occur if he proceeds with this operation.\n\nh3.

The problem with that is that the user ends up performing an unintended action (creating issue outside of intended context) because of his limited permissions.\n\n(/) The better way may be to check the required project permissions first, and give the user a choice to go ahead and create the issue outside the epic if he lacks the edit issue permission; otherwise, simply disallow the use of this feature for a user without the required permission to complete it successfully.\n\n(i) _I have not raised this as a bug because an error message does pop up during this operation stating that the user doesn't have edit issue permission for the epic or the newly created issue as the case may be. However, it probably still doesn't make any sense to allow creating the issue outside the epic anyway without atleast a warning dialog to the customer of the outcome of his action if he chooses to continue._\n",

This issue was initially found in JIRA Agile 6.4.0+, the specific cause for this issue found and was resolved in the JIRA Agile 6.4.2 release. It has been however found following to this release that subsequent similar issues have been seen where is it not possible to rank issues in JIRA Agile. \n\nIt is understood that the cause of this issue after the 6.4.2 release is different to the initial bug, and that it may have something to do with specific database configuration or data being in an inconsistent state due to the previous bug. One of these issues is exposed within the Oracle Database server and has been logged in the following bug: GHS-10910\n\nIf customers have run into this problem and are not currently on 6.4.2 it is recommended that they immediately upgrade to the latest version of JIRA Agile as this should resolve their problems.\n\nIf the upgrade does not fix the problem customers will need to trigger a *balance*, details on how to perform this are specified below.\n\nIf the *balance* does not work and you are on an Oracle Database please follow the steps below entitled *Upgrade Notes for JIRA Agile 6.4.2*, it is possible you have run into GHS-10910 please follow that for updates.\n\nIn other cases please contact https://support.atlassian.com, if customers urgently require their JIRA Agile to be functional again please follow the *Rollback the plugin* steps below.\n\nCheers,\n\nMichael Andreacchio\nJIRA Support Team Lead\n\n{panel}\n\nIssues are not able to be ranked in JIRA Agile 6.4.x.

Upgrade Notes for JIRA Agile 6.4.2:\n\nThe upgrade involves upgrading the plugin and then checking the database for certain edge cases that can occur that are broken ranking values. If these edge cases have occurred they need to be fixed in the database, which is described below.\n# Back up JIRA DB and perform the workaround on a staging server first.\n# Upgrade JIRA Agile.\n# Stop JIRA.\n# Run the below SQL to clear up any improper ranking.

Oracle SQL\n(!) _If using Oracle, ensure the database collation is set as per [Connecting JIRA to Oracle|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Connecting+JIRA+to+Oracle].
