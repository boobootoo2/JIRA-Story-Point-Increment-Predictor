Issue Summary\r\n\r\nWith a large number of users (in our case, north of 1 million), typing to search for users in the \"Alert user\" field of a \"THEN\" automation workflow action causes a spike in CPU utilization, followed by constant garbage collection at a level that renders that node in the cluster unable to respond to any other requests until the service is manually restarted.\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Navigate to the \"Project settings\" area of a Service Desk project\r\n # Click \"Automation\" in the sidebar\r\n # Either edit an existing rule or create a new one\r\n # If necessary (if creating a new rule), add an applicable \"WHEN\" action (such that adding a \"THEN\" action is possible)\r\n # Add a \"THEN\" action; select the \"Alert user\" action\r\n # In the resulting text field, type some characters to select a user\r\n # Wait for list of users to return; see that the response takes a long time (30+ sec) and may not ever return (receiving error message: \"The call to the Jira server did not complete within the timeout period. We are unsure of the result of this operation.\")\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nSearching for a user returns results in a reasonable amount of time for the specificity of the query and the service should remain available.\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n # Each character typed into the field results in a request like the following: {{/rest/servicedesk/automation/servicedeskmodules/1/then/alertuser/search?usernameOrEmail=b&projectKey=ABC&_=1591399088734}}\r\n # Every time the text field gains/loses focus, the same request is sent again\r\n # If the user interprets the long response time as an indication that the user they're searching for doesn't exist, they may choose to clear the field with their backspace key; each press to erase a character also sends a request\r\n # While a search for one or two characters, or even a copy/pasted username (a single request) may return successfully (though after a long delay; 30+ sec), a user who types a long username or email address, waits, sees no response, then backspaces their way back through the query can easily generate 20-30 requests in just a few seconds; this activity is enough to cause:\r\n ** High CPU\r\n ** High JVM memory usage\r\n ** Continuous garbage collection\r\n ** Service instability and potential unavailability (if the user attempting these searches bounces to other nodes in the cluster (as a result of nodes becoming unhealthy) and attempts their search again)\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nAt the load balancer or other proxy in front of Jira, block requests on the path {{/rest/servicedesk/automation/servicedeskmodules/1/then/alertuser/search}} to prevent these search requests from reaching Jira. Obviously this has the side-effect of disabling the functionality entirely, but it does prevent users from triggering this issue.",

The problem we have is that the Customers that are created in Project A become available as customers/reporters in Projects B-F. This could lead to someone accidentally using the wrong user if they modify the reporter...\r\n\r\nOur desire would be to have the users/Customers from Project A created in project and NOT in projects B-F - or have them unavailble to use as a reporter..

It is expected to override security restrictions, but it doesn't. Queries that return issues in browser, return nothing if run via API.

      "description": "h3. Issue Summary\r\n\r\nThe changes added for https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-70137 in Jira changed the way we check for visible comments for our users, and since JSD has a new type of user (\"Customer\") those changes affected us since \"Customer\" type users do not have BROWSE_PROJECTS permission (and should not have). \r\n\r\nThis bug causes all recalculations of SLAs with the \"Comment: for customers\" condition to be wrongly recalculated and corrupted, explaining what we are seeing in this ticket.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Create a new project in an empty JSD\r\n # Create a new SLA configuration like this: Start: Issue created, Pause: Status: Waiting for Customer, Stop: Comment: for customer\r\n # Create a new customer user using self sign-up\r\n # Use that customer to open a ticket through the customer portal\r\n # As an agent, go to the ticket and add a public comment. The SLA will be correctly stopped and complete.\r\n # Now, to break the SLA: delete the SLA values for the issue using the following SQL:\r\n{noformat}\r\ndelete\r\nfrom customfieldvalue\r\nwhere issue in (\r\n    select id as issue_id\r\n    from jiraissue\r\n    where project = (\r\n        select id as project_id\r\n        from project\r\n        where pkey = '{PROJECT_KEY}' -- project key\r\n    )\r\n      and issuenum = {ISSUE_NUMBER} -- issue number\r\n)\r\n  and customfield in (\r\n    select id as sla_custom_field_id\r\n    from customfield\r\n    where customfieldtypekey = 'com.atlassian.servicedesk:sd-sla-field' --sla field type key\r\n);\r\n{noformat}\r\n # Now execute a call like below to Jira's REST to clear the cache (replace the auth strategy with whatever makes sense):\r\n{noformat}\r\ncurl --location --request DELETE 'http://localhost:2990/jira/rest/internal/1.0/cache/app' \\\r\n     --header 'Authorization: Basic {BASE64_AUTH_STRING}' {noformat}\r\n # Call the reconstruct API on the issue (we might need to enable the sd.sla.fix.timeline feature flag here (again, replace the auth strategy with whatever makes sense):\r\n{noformat}\r\ncurl --location --request POST 'http://localhost:2990/jira/rest/servicedesk/1/servicedesk/sla/admin/task/destructive/reconstruct' \\\r\n     --header 'Authorization: Basic {BASE64_AUTH_STRING}' \\\r\n     --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\r\n     --data-raw '[\"{ISSUE_KEY}\"]'{noformat}\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nThe SLA should be in a correct state after calling the full reconstruction API.\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nSLA is now in a broken state. For example, SLAs that should have been paused / stopped are still running\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nh5.

Issue Summary\r\nDue to a limitation, User Picker fields in Customer Portal is limited to only 10 users ([relevant Feature Request|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSDSERVER-6443]). This limitation becomes problematic when the 'Raise this request on behalf of' field doesn't restrict the search should there be multiple users matching the keyword. This still occurs even when searching the full name.\r\n(i) The problem also occurs should the email address use the same string as the name\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Create 10 users with similar name\r\n** For example, create users named AAA Useryan, BBB Useryan, CCC Useryan and so on\r\n# Now create another user called User Useryan\r\n# Go to the Customer Portal where all the Users can access\r\n# Raise a request and in the 'Raise this request on behalf of' field, try to search for User Useryan\r\n# Notice how the results still show the other users as they still match the keyword\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nThe results would be filtered down to the users that strictly matches the keywords. Or prioritize the ones that better match the keyword by placing the users on top of the list.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nThe results show all users that match any one of the keywords.

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSDCLOUD-9076].\r\n{panel}\r\n \r\n\r\nh3. Problem Definition\r\nSince Jira Service Desk CSAT (customer satisfaction) system currently permits users to re-submit their satisfaction star ratings multiple times (see also JSDSERVER-3839 ), Jira should be able to track these changes from a historical perspective.  Currently this is not possible.  Since the data is being stored on a custom field, as soon as the customer changes their star rating, that value overwrites the previous data for that interaction.\r\nWhile the issue history in Jira does indicate the date/time of a satisfaction rating was provided, it does not track what that rating was.\r\n\r\nIn turn these original ratings are lost.\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\nTrack the historical rating values in some manner.  Either in the issue history, or when viewing the changelog of the issue via the API, this information would be useful to be able to store and retrieve.\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Why this is important\r\nIt is possible for a customer to incorrectly update the wrong request, or worse update all their previous requests and change these values. This provides a very skewed CSAT values if done, and does not accurately reflect the original CSAT ratings given initial provided\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround \r\nNone",

      "description": "There are two different ways to create/update issues by emails:\r\n - The first one is using Jira Mail handler. This is a global Jira Core feature where\u00a0admins can configure Jira to receive and process emails. Jira can receive emails from licensed users to create issues or add comments and attachments to existing issues automatically. The process is explained in this KB on\u00a0[Creating issues and comments from email|https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiraserver085/creating-issues-and-comments-from-email-981155478.html]. As you can see in the KB, there is a note mentioning the following, which takes us to the second option:\r\n{quote}If you're looking for a help desk solution, it may be more practical to use Jira Service Desk, rather than setting up Jira Core or Jira Software for this purpose.\r\n\r\nJira Service Desk uses a built-in processor to receive and process issue requests from emails. Issues created in Jira Service Desk don't require the sender to have a license to create, view, comment, add attachments, or transition issues.\u00a0\r\n{quote}\r\n - The second one is a Jira service desk property and you can\u00a0[read more about receiving email requests with Jira Service Desk here|https://confluence.atlassian.com/servicedeskserver033/receiving-requests-by-email-861255251.html].\r\n\r\nAs of today, there are a few differences between these two methods. For instance, using Service Desk mail handler:\r\n * Customers that are included in creating tickets from emails do not need to have application access (license) or to comply with the project permission scheme (only the customer permission configuration is needed) to be allowed to open new requests or add comments.\r\n * You can use automation rules that are only suitable for this mail handler.\r\n\r\n\u00a0On the other side, Jira Mail Handlers are much more configurable than the JSD Mail Handler:\r\n * For example,\u00a0 you can decide if the mail handler will only create new issues, only add new comments, or do both (while the JSD Mail Handler does either by default).\r\n * You can configure a default reporter, a catch email address, some regex expressions to decide how the quotes email will be stripped, etc\u2026 (which is not possible with the JSD Mail Handler).\r\n\r\nI understand that this is related to the fact that JSD was added as a plugin to Jira and therefore had its own mail framework. This suggestion is to come up with a consolidation by\u00a0taking the best of both mail functionalities which will reduce the confusion and offer a better configurability for JSD mail functionality.",

So *you will end up with two different pictures within the same comment*. One is correct and the other one isn't.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Attach a picture in the email body using Drag and Drop OR copy-paste (Example image001.png)\r\n # Send the email \r\n # Check the comment in \"Text\" Mode, it should be \r\n{code:java}\r\n!image001.png|thumbnail!\r\n{code}\r\n # Now create a new email and attach *another picture* in the email body using Drag and Drop OR copy-paste with the same name (image001.png).\r\n # The image is uploaded with the name (image001-1.png), which is the correct behaviour as this was fixed in Jira 8.6 and above (https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-2169)\r\n # Check out the comment in \"Text\" Mode, it shows *two pictures* \r\n #* The *first* picture attached with the name (image001.png) \r\n #** {code:java}\r\n!image001.png|thumbnail!\r\n{code} *which is incorrect.*\r\n#* The *second* picture attached with the name (image001-1.png)\r\n#** {code:java}\r\n!image001-1.png|thumbnail!\r\n{code}\r\n\r\n\r\nh3.

Actual Results\r\nWhen checking out the comment in text mode after uploading the second image, the comment shows {code:java} !image001.png|thumbnail! {code} which is incorrect because it shows the first picture attached, it also shows *the second picture* {code:java} !image001-1.png|thumbnail! {code} \r\n\r\n*Text Mode*\r\n*  !text mode.png|thumbnail! \r\n*Visual Mode*\r\n*  !Vmode.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\nh3.

      "description": "h3. Issue Summary\r\nJSD's Automation webhooks behave differently to Jira webhooks when using Jira behind outbound http-proxy.  Jira webhooks respect the NonProxyHosts configuration while Service Desk webhooks always go through the proxy. This can also lead to a scenario where using JSDs automation to fire webhooks, they look like they are sent, but they timeout and/or fail silently.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# In the setenv.sh/.bat we set additional JVM arguments (JVM_SUPPORT_RECOMMENDED_ARGS) with:\r\n#* http.proxyHost\r\n#* http.proxyPort\r\n#* http.proxyUser\r\n#* http.proxyPassword\r\n#* https.proxyHost\r\n#* https.proxyPort\r\n#* https.proxyUser\r\n#* https.proxyPassword\r\n#* https.nonProxyHosts\r\n# Add a JSD automation that triggers a webhook.\r\n# Perform an action that triggers this automation rule.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nThe web request is sent through the proxy configured in the JVM arguments and reaches its destination.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nThe webhook is triggered, but it does not follow the proxy configuration and does not go out of Jira, failing silently.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n Currently there is no known workaround for this behavior. A workaround will be added here when available",

You can modify the project-queue-react-table.11ec2bcb91b8f432dc30.css in the servicedesk-frontend-plugin-4.7.1-REL-0008.jar and changed the width from 70px to 75px or 80px.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
