Well, what does that mean?\n\n!2404979742-Capture.PNG|thumbnail!\n\nTo me, a Full Stack Developer is someone with familiarity in each layer, if not mastery in many and a genuine interest in all software technology.\n\nGood developers who are familiar with the entire stack know how to make life easier for those around them. This is why I\u2019m so against silos in the work place. Sure, politics and communication challenges get in the way in large organizations. I think the point Facebook is going for with their hiring policy is, if smart people use their heads and their hearts, a better product gets built in less time.\n\nlayers of the full stack:\n\nServer, Network, and Hosting Environment.\\\\\nThis involves understanding what can break and why, taking no resource for granted.\\\\\nAppropriate use of the file system, cloud storage, network resources, and an understanding of data redundancy and availability is necessary.\\\\\nHow does the application scale given the hardware constraints?\\\\\nWhat about multi-threading and race conditions? Guess what, you won\u2019t see those on your development machine, but they can and do happen in the real world.\\\\\nFull stack developers can work side by side with DevOps. The system should provide useful error messages and logging capabilities. DevOps will see the messages before you will, so make them count.\\\\\nData Modeling\\\\\nIf the data model is flawed, the business logic and higher layers start to need strange (ugly) code to compensate for corner cases the data model doesn\u2019t cover.\\\\\nFull stack developers know how to create a reasonably normalized relational model, complete with foreign keys, indexes, views, lookup tables, etc.\\\\\nFull stack developers are familiar with the concept of non-relational data stores and understand where they shine over relational data stores.",

I pushed a change, made a PR, got feedback, modified my changeset, and pushed an extra head with force. When editing the PR it shows the new changeset in the list. But when I save it, the actual PR still uses the old PR.\n\nI guess it is fair enough if it only supports \"extending\" the PR but not \"removing\" changesets from it ... but then it should show that in the edit ui.\n\nHowever, I manually stripped the old head. That \"broke\" the PR more than expected. From what @brodie had told me I thought you stored the context together with the comments ... but since bb no longer shows any context after the changeset has been stripped, I assume that isn&#x27;t the case.\n\nAnyway, after that I could update the PR to the new changeset.",

However as far as I know there&#x27;s no way to do the same with a tag reference. Instead, one has to look up the associated SHA-1 and use that instead, which is awkward (and fixed, although I know tags aren&#x27;t supposed to be moved).\n\nWhat I&#x27;d like to see is a syntax that allows a tag to be specified, perhaps something like this example:\n\n\"This regression was previously fixed in tag:release_1_2_3\"\n\n(would automatically hyperlink to whichever commit had that tag on it).\n\nI&#x27;m not sure whether it would link to the actual tag instance, or to the associated commit. Perhaps the former, as some tags may be annotated, but the most likely use-case is that the user actually wants to link to the associated commit.\n\nFor that matter, being able to link to branch references would be useful too (such that they follow the head of the branch):\n\n\"This issue should be addressed on branch:bugfix_12345\"\n\nAlso, I&#x27;m thinking Issue comments primarily, but being able to specify these in commit messages makes sense since commit messages often end up as an Issue comment anyway.",
