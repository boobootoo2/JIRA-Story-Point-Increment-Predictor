Issue Summary\r\n\r\nWhen Jira is connected to 2 Confluence server instances via an application link, the Knowledge Base search functionality might not work from the main Help Center page, while it will still work from the individual portal search page and the request creation page.\r\n\r\nCurrently, Help Center search performs the search exclusively on the Primary Confluence instance and no other.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThis is a request to able to resolve this - through either -\r\n # Provide the ability to select which confluence instance is used in the Help Center searches\r\n # Or enable ability to search on all connected Connies\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to reproduce\r\n - Setup 2 Confluence instances\r\n -- The first one will be referred to as *Confluence*\r\n -- The second one will be referred to as *Confluence 2*\r\n - Create a new space in *Confluence*, and create a few pages containing the word \"laptop\"\r\n - Setup 1 Jira instance\r\n - Configure 2 application links in *Jira > \u2699 > Applications > Application Links*, 1 to each Confluence instance, with the application link to *Confluence* set to the primary one:\r\n !Step1.png|thumbnail!\r\n - Create a Service Desk project in Jira, and configure there a knowledge base using the space coming from *Confluence*\r\n !Step2.png|thumbnail!\r\n - Go to the main help center page of the customer portal (<JIRA_BASE_URL>/servicedesk/customer/portals)\r\n - Type \"laptop\" in the search, and notice that the search is returning articles coming from *Confluence* (in addition to the relevant *Request Types* from JSD projects)\r\n !Step3.png|thumbnail!\r\n - Go back to *Jira > \u2699 > Applications > Application Links* and now set *Confluence 2* as the primary link\r\n !Step4.png|thumbnail!\r\n - Go back to the main help center page of the customer portal (<JIRA_BASE_URL>/servicedesk/customer/portals)\r\n - Type \"laptop\" in the search\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n - The search does not return any article from *Confluence*, but only the relevant *Request Types* from JSD projects:\r\n !Step5.png|thumbnail!\r\n - When opening the Browser Dev tool, we can see that no pages are returned from the request <JIRA_BASE_URL>/rest/servicedesk/knowledgebase/latest/articles/shared/search?resultsPerPage=3&pageNumber=1&query=laptop&_=1627633567284\r\n{code:java}\r\n{\"results\":[],\"total\":0,\"pageNumber\":0,\"resultsPerPage\":0,\"isCloud\":false}\r\n{code}\r\n!Step6.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\n - When enabling the debugging package *org.apache.http* in Logging And profiling, we don't see any outbound HTTP request sent from Jira to Confluence, which shows that the Jira application did not try to send any request to Confluence to search for these articles\r\n\r\nh3. Expected results\r\n - The search should be returning articles coming from *Confluence* (in addition to the relevant *Request Types* from JSD projects)\r\n - When enabling the debugging package *org.apache.http* in Logging And profiling, we should see Jira sending outgoing HTTP requests to Confluence to search for the key word \"laptop\" within the Confluence space linked to the JSD project.

Note that the overwriting of the user name only occurs in the UI, but not in the Database, unless the *Update* button is clicked on. For this reason, this behavior does not impact the actual Mail Server configuration used by the Service Desk Mail Handler (which is stored in the Database).\r\n\r\nh3. Environment\r\n\r\nThis behavior was replicated in Service Management 4.13.0, but it could be impacting older versions too.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to replicate\r\n\r\n- Create a Service Management project\r\n- Configure a shared mailbox in *Project Settings > Email Requests* using the *Other* tab with\r\n-- testsharedmailbox@test.com as the *email address*\r\n-- userwithmailboxaccess@test.com\\testsharedmailbox as the *username*\r\n- Click on the update button, and make sure that the connection is successful\r\n- Click on the *Microsoft* tab, then switch back to the *Other* tab\r\n\r\n [^Screen Recording.mov] \r\n\r\nh3.

Note that this issue can sometimes be replicated by:\r\n- opening any Jira page outside the Service Management project \r\n- then going back to *Project Settings > Email Requests* page\r\n- in some cases, the *Outlook* tab will be selected by default, and when selecting the *Other* tab, the username will be overwritten by the email address\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Suggestion\r\n\r\nModify the way the username is displayed in the UI when switching from the *Microsoft* tab to the *Other* tab, as it can be very confusing from the Project Admin, because it looks like the incorrect username is being used in the *Email Request* configuration (while it is correct in the Database).\r\n",

Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Enable Object picker on an Insight CF\r\n # Enable Customer portal for JSM customers on the object schema\r\n ** !2021-07-23_13-55-29.png|thumbnail!\r\n # Mark an object attribute as \"hidden\"\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nPortal-only users should not be able to see hidden attributes on the object picker in customer portal\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nAll attributes, including the hidden ones, are visible\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nPossibly we can disable Object picker on the CF configuration.

Ex:\r\n !Screenshot 2021-07-13 at 16.26.27.png|thumbnail! \r\n# Create an Insight custom field set on the previously created schema and object type and try to set the *Filter Issue Scope either on one Status for the attribute created or one project* (ex Status = (\"Active\") or Project = currentProject()):\r\n !Screenshot 2021-07-13 at 16.27.40.png|thumbnail! \r\nOR\r\n !Screenshot 2021-07-13 at 16.30.58.png|thumbnail! \r\n# Assign the Insight field to the screen of a JSM project (ex. PRESET which is the value I populated the Project type attribute with).\r\n# Try to create an issue in PRESET project and observe that only three objects are proposed in order to respect the Filter Issue scope:\r\n !Screenshot 2021-07-13 at 16.29.51.png|thumbnail! \r\n# Enter the PRESET project settings and edit one request type to add this example Insight custom field.\r\n# Keep the field hide and so that is mandatory to fill it with preset value. Observe that all objects are proposed as preset value for the object type and the Filter Issue Scope is not respected:\r\n !Screenshot 2021-07-13 at 16.29.13.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\nThis happen both in the case of Status and Project filter for the filter issue scope.\r\n\r\nThis looks similar but slightly different from [ICS-1577|https://jira.mindville.com/browse/ICS-1577], previously fixed in Insight 8.4.4.\r\n\r\nIn this case whenever the issue is raised from within the portal, the wrong value is also shown:\r\n\r\n !Screenshot 2021-07-13 at 17.04.03.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nThe preset value drop down menu should respect the Filter Issue Scope.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nFilter Issue scope is not respected\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\nCurrently there is no known workaround for this behavior. A workaround will be added here when available",

Steps to Reproduce\r\n # With Insight 8.6.11, set up and import from the CVE-Database as per [this documentation|https://documentation.mindville.com/display/INVDI/Importing+Data+into+Insight]. For testing purpose, we choose CVE 2020.\r\n # Note the time taken to complete the import.\r\n # Upgrade to Insight 8.6.12 or any newer version, create another schema and perform the exact same import.\r\n # Note the time taken to complete the import and the CPU usage.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nThe time taken to complete the import in both versions is almost the same\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n* It takes much longer to complete the import in Insight version 8.6.12 and above. Based on the comparison of the logs, we can see that the step to decide actions for all objects is *taking more time* in the newer Insight versions (103ms vs 401608ms). \r\n* *CPU spike* can also be observed along the import process especially on step 3 (decide actions for all objects) and as soon as the import is done, CPU usage is back to normal. Due to the much longer process, the impact of CPU spike is amplified.\r\n(i) In some cases, the import seems halted for hours on step 3 and CPU usage is constantly at its peak. The import has to be terminated manually by canceling the import, disabling and re-enabling Insight or restart Jira.\r\nh4.

Steps to Reproduce\r\n(i) This can be reproduced but intermittently and it does not affect every object.\r\n # Make sure an object type has 2 Date type attributes.\r\n # Create 10-20 objects and fill in most attributes except 1 of the Date type attributes.\r\n # Edit these objects to fill in the other Date type attributes.\r\n # Check the object history.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n* The object history only contains actual changes that were made by user. For example,\r\n{quote}\r\nChanged the `T-shirt size` to `M` (was `S`)\r\n{quote}\r\n* The first Date type attribute that was already filled during the object creation and didn't have any change do not appear in the object history of the Edit action\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nIn the object history, there are also entries for Date attributes that weren't changed at all. And this entry gets added every time the object is edited for any attributes. For example,\r\n{quote}\r\nChanged the `Employment start date` to `1 Jan 2021` (was `1 Jan 2021`) \r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\nCurrently there is no known workaround for this behavior.

I am suggesting an improvement for SQL scripts to be able to find duplicates.\r\n\r\n*The workaround that currently exists is the following*\r\n\r\nWhat you can do at the moment, using IQL:\r\n\r\na. Visually locate a duplicated Object.\r\n\r\nb. identify the Duplicate from the Original (the object id of the original will be lower than the duplicate, and reflected in the numeric part of the object Key, e.g. KEY-123 = original while KEY-234 is a duplicate as objectId: 123<234 )\r\n\r\nc. If there are a few duplicates, locate the oldest one - and note the Created date & Time\r\n\r\nd. Use the Insight object search to filter on your All your Schema Objects Created from the Duplicate Create date onward, e.g. IQL: Created >= 29/Jun/2020 05:36:00\r\n\r\ne. Note that some objects may have been created legitimately and ARE NOT Duplicates, hence you should carefully revise the filtered objects, before deleting any.\r\n\r\nf. we strongly recommend to create a Jira/DB Backup before you start deleting any object - to allow a valid restore point. As deleting Objects is irreversible unless you restore a backup.\r\n\r\nHowever working with very high volumes of objects makes this workaround not sufficient. \r\n\r\nKind regards\r\nThomas",

      "description": "h3. Problem\r\nRight now, the only way to check if a user is using up a JSM agent license is through *Jira Administration >> Applications >> Application access* and cross checking the groups' members who are assigned. The Jira Administrator needs to be involved in this check.\r\nThe mapping between the jira-servicedesk-agents group (or any group with application access to JSM to take up an agent's license) and a project's team/role is not readily viewable at the project settings level.\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\nAdd a filterable column under *Project settings >> Users and roles* showing the user groups that a user is assigned. This way, a project administrator can check at the project settings level the number of users who are taking up an agent license without having to approach a Jira system administrator.\r\n\r\nh3. Why This Is Important\r\nThis will reduce the need for a Jira administrator to perform a simple check, and empower project owners/admins to view which users in their respective projects are taking up an agent license.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\nJira admins still need to be involved to identify the users who take up an agent license. Once step 1 and 2 are recorded, the project admins can do step 3 on their own moving forward.\r\n\r\n# Jira admin: Check *Jira Administration >> Applications >> Application access*. Note down the groups assigned to Jira Service Desk.\r\n# Jira admin: Navigate to *Jira Administration >> System >> Project roles*. Check each Project role's default members to see if the group from step 1 is assigned to a project role. Note down the project roles with default group members from step 1.\r\n# Project admin/Project settings: Go to *Project settings >> Users and roles*. Filter by the project roles from step 2. This will list all users who have an agent license.",
