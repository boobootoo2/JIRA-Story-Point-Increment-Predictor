Sometimes Bamboo will reuse and assign the FOO-1 plan key to the newly create branch. that is when I have problems.\r\n\r\n6. Try to create a release from the FOO-1, say release FOO-1-${buildNumber}, which translates to FOO-1-1.\r\n\r\nBamboo will complain that FOO-1-1 cannot be create because it is lower than FOO-1-40 (from step #2 above).\r\n\r\nAlso, in the create release page, when I select the branch behind the FOO-1 plan key, it will list the build results  created by the branch that was previously pointing to FOO-1. \r\nThat is how I came to realise bamboo was reusing old plan keys from deleted branches.\r\n\r\nI hope my explanation isn't too confusing.\r\n",

Creating a brand new \"Artifact Download\" task allows you to select All or Individual though, but never via \"Add another artifact\".\r\n\r\nThis is a regression, because this used to work a month or so ago.\r\n\r\nhttps://answers.atlassian.com/questions/291074/bamboo-ondemand-artifact-download-selection",

Overview\r\n\r\nThe ability to flexibly manage / register Deployment environments, where these environments are created/instanced in 'the cloud' and exist as part of an elastic infrastructure.\r\n\r\nh1. Background\r\n\r\nHaving switched from SVN to Mercurial/Git we have found that using Branches to develop and test on has become a best-practice in our teams. One impact of this change, however, is that we now find that we are restricted on the number of physical test environments in which we can deploy to.\r\n\r\nAs a result, we've begun investigating using AWS in a way similar to the 'elastic agent' concept by which we create a 'snapshot' test environment build, and then create test environment instances from that snapshot which are then deployed to as though any other test environment.\r\n\r\nh1. Implementation Thoughts\r\n\r\nI could see this being done in one of two ways:\r\n# Follow a similar approach to Elastic Build Agents where users...\r\n## Create and register AMI's with Bamboo\r\n## When a new Environment is required, Bamboo can manage the initialisation of an instance based on that environment\r\n## When the Environment is no-longer required, Bamboo can manage the shut-down/hibernation/termination of that environment\r\n## Value-Add features under this approach would be to have the ability to snapshot the Instance at given points in time so that 'child'/'related' instances can be created at any point to allow Developers and QA teams to work in tandem without necessary disrupting one-another\r\n# Provide API Access to the Deployment administrative functions which can be used by an Instance-triggered script to...\r\n## Create an Environment definition in Bamboo on Boot\r\n## Remove the Environment definition from Bamboo on Termination/Shut-Down",

The lacks of possibilities in configuration with the ant patterns force to create too many artifacts and thus the use of bamboo for deployment is lesser interesting whereas the possibilities of rollback deployment within artifact are very useful. \r\n\r\nAt least, i would like a functionnality to exclude/include files when i create an artifact.

The deployment project has a task to download all shared artifacts - and when we deploy 'build 1' it gets 'myartifact' and carries on - so far so good. \r\n\r\nTime marches on, and we need to make some adjustments to the structure of 'myproject'. The artifact 'myartifact' is now obtained from 'foo/target', and we adjust the artifact definition accordingly. We produce a build (let's call this 'build 2')\r\n\r\nWhen we try to deploy 'build 2' we get the artifact that we need and the deployment succeeds. If we try to deploy 'build 1', it fails because it can't find an artifact under 'foo/target' - and there was indeed no such artifact, because we had not yet made the structural changes.\r\n\r\nThis seems completely wrong to me. Existing builds should not be affected by changes to the build plan. Each build should hold its own knowledge about the artifacts that it contains - this should not come from the current build plan. Because of this apparent bug, we can no longer make deployments of 'build 1'. This will quickly become a showstopper for us, unless there is some kind of workaround - and I can't think of any.\r\n\r\n*Update:* This does appear to be a bug relating to the 'Artifact Download' task used in the deployment plan.
