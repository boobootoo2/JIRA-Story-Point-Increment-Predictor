This is great but I would like two enhancements to it:\n\n* When I am on a commits tab I don&#x27;t see which commits I&#x27;ve reviewed and which not. It would be nice to add some flag/icon/color indication to the approved commits\n* When I am looking in the commit page I&#x27;d like to quickly skip to next/previous commit in a list. Jira style \"j/k\" shortcuts would be great for this. (and maybe arrow icons too for those who don&#x27;t use shortcuts)\n\nThanks\\\\\nDusan",

It has an item \"Issues (count)\" that refers to page with a list of currently open issues (with \"new\" or \"open\" statuses).\n\nWorking for relatively long time on my project I mentioned that the count of open issues in menu item is not equal to the count of issues in page&#x27;s title (that is just above issues&#x27; list and represents a valid value). To be more precise, the count of open issues in menu item is less than the count in page&#x27;s title by one. E.g, when count of open issues is 14 I see \"Issues (13)\" in menu item.\n\nI&#x27;m not sure whether such behavior correct or wrong but probably there can be page&#x27;s caching issue.\n\nA problem becomes apparent on my private repo&#x27;s page: https://bitbucket.org/Arrenda/arrenda.ru/issues?status=new&status=open",
