When using the option of 'Apply to these projects', the user  is able to select which project can and which project cannot use the Classic Boards. However, it seems that they cannot disable all the projects\n\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\n\n# Head to the 'GreenHopper Configuration' page in your JIRA Administration\n# At the 'Enabled Projects' tab, try to first add all the projects into the 'GreenHopper Projects' list (This is because, by default, the radiobutton 'All Projects' are selected, thus no projects are in the 'GreenHopper Projects' list)\n# Then, try to remove all of them\n# When  you click on 'Modify' after removing all of them, the list will turn yellow, and nothing will happen. When the screen is refreshed, the projects are back i nthe 'GreenHopper Projects' list\n\nh3. Additional Info\n\n* This was tested in GreenHopper 6.2.1 and GreenHopper 6.2.2. \n* I've attached a video of how the bug occurs, so that it's more convenient",

After performing this function, it did not return to the backlog, but was removed entirely from the Rapid Board.\n\nThis is critical since we truly are unaware of which items are being displayed on the Rapid Boards and which are not. We are working with a 3rd party company on this particular project and collaboration with them through the Rapid Boards is vital.\n\nAlso note: We have other Issues in the same state, criteria and status but do appear on the Plan Board without issue.\n\nIf you navigate directly to the issue detail, then click Agile > View on Board, JIRA states \"There are no boards which contain this issue.\"\nScreenshot: http://screencast.com/t/lAPBzIOgX\n\nProject Name: DDB - RMHC Site\nProject URL: https://reside.jira.com/browse/DDBS\n\nIssue ID: DDBS-11\nIssue URL: https://reside.jira.com/browse/DDBS-11\n\nRapid Board name: DDB - RMHC Site\nRapid Board URL: https://reside.jira.com/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=64\n\nBelow is the checklist from the earlier referenced wiki article:\n1.

(listing assignees with non-sum-zero of course)\n\nThis way i could tell that our current team can do the Sprint or not...\n\nCurrent workaround:\n1. Start the Sprint\n2. Go to Work mode\n3. Count manually using Assignee Swimlane\n4. Remove/Add Stories so that the Sprint can be doable\n\nIt is extremely painful and when the customer is there (face to face planning meeting) is shameful, so usually we can prioritize but defer the final planning and negotiate the final Sprint plan offline with the customer.... not a real agile approach\n\n\n\n",

      "description": "As Patrick, I want to be guided when creating a board so I don't get lost in the process.\n\nCoS:\n\n- The dialog consists of three parts:\n-- Board type (Scrum, Kanban)\n-- Project/Filter (create new project, choose existing, specify saved filter)\n-- leftovers: sample data on/off, workflow (JIRA vs GH Simplified)\n- this dialog replaces the existing ones present in:\n-- create new scrum board\n-- create new kanban board\n-- create new DIY board\n-- the dialog available from the cog menu (incl Manage Boards)\n- the \"DIY\" option is removed from the \"Getting Started\" screen as it is effectively obsolete\n- if Scrum or Kanban mode is chosen from the \"Getting Started\" screen, then the wizard should start at step 2 (i.e. we already know if it's scrum or kanban)\n- the text inviting you to create new project or choose existing on \"Getting Started\" needs rewording so it simply opens the dialog -- remove the two \"1\" and \"2\" things and replace with just \"1\".\n- the link to create a sample project should be rewired to use the new wizard and take you directly to creating the project with sample data and workflow options already selected.\n\n(!) Dev Notes (!)\n\nQ: What if there are no existing projects to select?\nA: Skip the step to choose and go straight to create new project\n\nQ: What if there are no filters to select from?\nA: No option to choose to create from a filter\n\nQ: What if the user has no permissions to create a project?\nA: menu link or button disabled; getting started text changes and does not show option to create\n\nQ: For OnDemand, what if the user doesn't have all application permissions to create a project?\nA: menu link or button disabled; getting started text changes and does not show option to create\n\nQ: What if there is a large number of existing projects?\nA: Drop down is really long\n\nQ: What if there are a large number of filters?\nA: Drop down is really long\n\nQ: What if the user does not have permission to see some/all filters?\nA: They won't appear in the list\n\nQ: Are selections persisted between board creations?\nA: No\n\nQ: Does scrolling through all the panes persist selections?\nA: Back / Next through pages should persist selections\n\nQ: Is there proper XSS escaping for filters and projects?\nA: Yes\n\nQ: What if the window is resized?\nA: Dialog stays the same size\n\nQ: Does the create button disable/spinner after pressed?\nA: There is a spinner.\n\nQ: What happens if the operation is cancelled after the create button is pressed?\nA: Within the process the dialog just goes away and no board is created. After the final button is pressed the page will reload and go to board, no cancel button. \n\nQ: Has this been checked from plan, work, and report? Manage Boards, Board Configuration, and Getting Started all the same?\nA: Link will be in menu for Manage Boards, Plan, Work and Report. \n\nQ: Will the dialog not render properly in some browsers?\nA: No, it will always be beautiful. \nA2: In JIRA 5.1, 5.2 the dialog has some differences as expected.",

This frequently brings up questions about the teams being on or off track.\n\n*Imagine the following scenario:*\nTeam Rocket committed to burn down 100 story points. Halfway into the sprint, they have already burned down most of the committed story points and some of the team members start to work on other issues of the backlog. Since everything needs to be tracked, they pull them into the active sprint. These scope changes now lead to confusion about if the team is still working on the original commitment or on additional work.\n\n*There are two options:*\n# The team is on track, which means it has burned down most of the original committed stories and everybody should be cheering\n# The team is off track, because even though their burndown looks nice, they have been working on stuff that has been pulled in as scope changes and they have not worked on some of the originally committed stories.\n\nA possible solution could be to render two different graphs, one for the original scope excluding scope changes (yellow) and one containing both  the original scope and the scope changes (red):\n\n!burndown_ontrack_legend.png!\n\n_Note: This is a mockup and the actual curve might not be 100% correct._\n\nWe found ourselves in a situation where we would get nervous calls from our directors asking why our burndowns look so bad and if we can make it while our SCRUM masters were totally satisfied, because the teams had actually a better throughput and pulled in additional work. The other way around, a burndown could look good, but originally committed work had been ignored.\n\n*This is a real showstopper for us!*",
