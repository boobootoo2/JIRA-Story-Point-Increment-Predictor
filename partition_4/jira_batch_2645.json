As the host comparison is case sensitive the 'referer' check fails. I think just to be safe we should perform a case insensitive comparison of the 'referer' and the 'host' headers host.\r\n\r\n*Note*\r\nIf one does not configure tomcat to have proxy configuration and passes through the HOST header by using the apache httpd 'ProxyPreserveHost' configuration directive then this issue can be avoided. Because ProxyPreserveHost does not cause the scheme or port to be properly set one has to explicitly configure the tomcat connector to include scheme=\"https\" and the proxyPort=\"443\" when using bamboo behind a https proxy. In such a setup we also recommend setting secure=\"true\" in the tomcat connector configuration.\r\n\r\n ",
