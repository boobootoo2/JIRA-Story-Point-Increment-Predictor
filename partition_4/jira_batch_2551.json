Unfortunately, there appears to be no way to do that in Bitbucket - they either mark it as resolved and then I have no idea which ones have been tested or not, or they simply post a comment which means I have to pick up on that.

      "description": "It would be useful if there was some way of making mercurial repositories non-publishing.  This simply amounts to including the following lines in the {{.hg/hgrc}} file.  Unfortunately, there seems to be no way to access this from the bitbucket web interface:\n\n{code}\n[phases]\npublish = False\n{code}\n\nh1. Use Case\nOne might like to maintain a private repository for an online backup.  Pushing to this private repository should not alter the phase of *draft* change-sets so that later rebasing etc. can be performed.  (Pushing to a public repository, or a shared private repository, however, should change the phase to *public*.)\n\nAs second use case is code review: it is useful to push ones code to a fork, so that a code review can be performed on a pull request.  At the end of the code review, one often wants to clean up the changes (rebasing) before the code is pulled back into the main project.  It would be very useful to be able to mark the review fork as non-publishing so that the phases are maintained, guiding this later rebasing.\n\nh1.
