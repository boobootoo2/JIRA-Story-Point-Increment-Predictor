Expected Results\r\nThe release is used for the deployment\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nIncorrect or the latest release from any branch is used in the deployment\r\n \r\nh3. Notes\r\n* When the page Deploy Release with promoting existing release is loaded, it try to get the list of all the branch plans and its releases and then auto populate the \"Release\" field with the latest release (created from any branches)\r\n* The problem only happens when there are a lot of branch plans and releases which cause the delay in getting the list\r\n* Even though a branch plan and release are manually selected by the user, the \"Release\" might auto changed later due to the automation (before the \"Start deployment\" button is clicked)\r\n* Should disable \"Start deployment\" button in deployment until page has fully loaded or stop the auto populate function if a manual selection is detected\r\n",

This is fine when variation on the environment is required. However, some customers will want to \"duplicate and transfer\" the configuraiton to other plans.. To do this they have to first clone and then go back and edit the association. An improvement for Bamboo could be to make the cloning experience for deployment environments more like build plan cloning and to offer a pulldown of plans that it could be associated with or triggered by. Default behaviour could be to provide an option to clone associated deployment plans if the parent is also cloned.",

I've been meaning to fiddle around step 2 and make mischief with the [bamboo deployment variable|https://confluence.atlassian.com/bamboo/bamboo-variables-289277087.html#Bamboovariables-Deploymentvariables] _bamboo.deploy.release_ in an attempt to rename a release but I don't think that will work.\r\n\r\nIs this something that can be achieved with a special task or at least a routine I can access within the deployment project to do this?\r\n\r\nKind Regards,\r\n Daniel",

Scenario A - In place upgrade\r\nIf you are upgrading Bamboo and not changing the databases type, version, or location, don't perform an export. Instead, create a Bamboo backup by taking a dump of the database using the native tools specific to your database and create a filesystem copy of the BAMBOO_HOME directory.

Scenario B - Upgrade + DB version upgrade\r\nIf you are upgrading Bamboo _and_ changing the databases version, don't perform an export. Instead, create a Bamboo backup by taking a dump of the database using the native tools specific to your database and create a filesystem copy of the BAMBOO_HOME directory. Next, import the database dump into the new version of the database.

Instead, create a Bamboo backup by taking a dump of the database using the native tools specific to your database and create a filesystem copy of the BAMBOO_HOME directory. Next, import the database dump into the new database on the new server. For further instructions, refer to the [Bamboo upgrade guide|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/BAMBOO/Bamboo+upgrade+guide] documentation.\r\n\r\nh4. Scenario D - Upgrade + DB type change\r\nIf you are upgrading Bamboo _and_ changing the database type, you will need to perform an export. After you import the export file into the upgraded version, stop Bamboo and manually copy the data from the CREDENTIALS table from the source (old) database to the target (new) database.

Summary\r\n\r\nIt is currently possible to set the maximum number of elastic agents that can be running concurrently inside the *Elastic Bamboo configuration* page, according to the [Configuring Elastic Bamboo - Global settings|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/BAMBOO/Configuring+Elastic+Bamboo#ConfiguringElasticBamboo-Globalsettings] documentation. However this is a general configuration and doesn't take into account any of the instance's specification.\r\nh3. Suggestion\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to have the ability to set the maximum number of elastic agents that can be running concurrently based off of the AMI id.\r\n\r\nFor example: If the *Maximum number of elastic agents* configuration is set to 5, the user can start 5 elastic agents based on the Windows stock image, but what if we want to limit the maximum number of *Windows stock images* users can start up concurrently? It's not possible to trim down the number of *specific* images that can be running at the same time without affecting other images.",

      "description": "h3. Summary\r\n\r\nCurrently it's possible to have Bamboo automatically link a plan branch to a JIRA issue if the branch name contains a JIRA issue key or something similar to a JIRA issue key. This feature is described with more details inside the following documentation:\r\n\r\n- [Using plan branches - Integrating branches with JIRA applications|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/BAMBOO/Using+plan+branches#Usingplanbranches-IntegratingbrancheswithJIRAapplications]\r\n\r\nThe problem is that there's no validation. If Bamboo understands that the branch name contains something similar to a JIRA issue key, it creates a link to JIRA even if no JIRA issue exists with that key, and if you simply want to remove that association, you are not able to because there's no option in the UI that provides such ability. It would be nice if Bamboo could check and identify if the JIRA issue exists before creating the link.\r\n\r\nOnce you turn this feature off new branches will no longer be automatically associated to JIRA issues, however existing plan branches will remain linked to JIRA issues (even if the JIRA issue doesn't exist) and there's no way to remove the link from the UI.\r\n\r\nh3.Workaround\r\n\r\nIt is possible to remove the link directly from the database. Please [raise a support ticket|https://support.atlassian.com] for Bamboo and mention this bug report so that the Atlassian Support Team can help you remove the links from the database.",

Summary\r\nCurrently, there is no way to tell when was the latest date/time a user logged in Bamboo, regardless the authentication type (_e.g.: Internal Directory, External Directory_)\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# When authenticating in Bamboo (_Internal Directory_), there is no database table that holds information on user's latest authentication against the application.\r\n# When authenticating in Bamboo (_External Directory, e.g.: JIRA_) you can run the following SQL statement against JIRA's database:\r\n{code:sql}\r\nselect Attr.attribute_value as LAST_AUTHENTICATED\r\n  from cwd_user as Person\r\n  join cwd_user_attributes as Attr\r\n       on Person.id = Attr.user_id\r\n where Person.user_name = 'USERNAME'\r\n   and Attr.attribute_name = 'lastAuthenticated';\r\n{code}\r\n||LAST_AUTHENTICATED||\r\n|1467639110107|\r\nHowever, when authenticating with the same USERNAME in JIRA and re-running the SQL statement above, the same gets updated:\r\n||LAST_AUTHENTICATED||\r\n|1467639474640|\r\n(i) Due to the information above, you cannot tell whether the authentication was from Bamboo or JIRA.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nBe able to determine when a particular last authenticate against the application.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nInformation cannot be retrieved.\r\n\r\nh3.

The command below, tested on Unix machines, allows for multiple {{catalina.out}} files in multiple directories, for example in the case of upgrades:\r\n{code}\r\nfind / -name catalina.out -exec grep \"Finished doing authentication checks for\" {} \\; |awk -F ' ' 'BEGIN {date = $1} {if ($1 > date && $1 > a[$11]) a[$11] = $1} END {for (i in a) print i\" : \" a[i]}'\r\n{code}\r\nSample output:\r\n{noformat}\r\nnonadmin, : 2017-02-15\r\nbamboo, : 2017-02-24\r\n{noformat}\r\nNotes:\r\n# The command provided will only work on terminals which support GNU tools\r\n# This can be run from any directory accessible by the Bamboo user\r\n# This command may take some time to run, dependent on the size of your {{catalina.out}} file(s)\r\n# This suggestion is provided as-is and support will not be available from Atlassian Support",

Occasionally, our dev team will manually deploy from the 'master' branch to our STG/INT environment. When choosing to deploy the environment, and then choosing \"Create new release from build result\" the \"Release\" field is auto-populated based on the variables in the Release-versioning setup. \r\n\r\nHowever if you update the plan branch to a different one, ie master, it defaults to branchname-buildnumber. I see that this is mentioned on the Release Versioning page (\"Releases from branches will default to using the branch name suffixed with the build number of the build result.\"), but was wondering if there was a specific reasoning/purpose behind that as opposed to just auto-populating the format the users set on this page.\r\n\r\nNo urgency here.

      "description": "Hi,\r\n\r\nWe just upgraded to Bamboo 5.12.2 and discovered that Altassian plans to remove the repositories settings at the build plans level. Already in version 5.12.2, our users cannot create their build plan repositories anymore because we did not grant them the Create Plan permission and will certainly not grant them that permission in the future.\r\n\r\nThe reason is we have one Bamboo instance that we share among hundreds of teams. This Bamboo is linked to a Confluence instance and a Jira instance. Applinks being what it is (instable); we are not found of multiplying instances (also it will bring more operation/maintenance work).\r\n\r\nSo this move of Atlassian to remove the repositories settings at the build plan level and require users to have the create plan permission is not fitting our model here:\r\n- giving the Create Plan permission to all of our users will result in a mess in the way our build plans are created; grouped in projects, etc...\r\n- as we cannot offload the repository settings to our users now, we have to handle this part\r\n\r\nAny ways for Atlassian to revisit its motive to remove this feature (adding repositories at build plan level with out the Create Plan permission) ? Also it is not really logic. Why would you need a Create Plan permission (which is at the Bamboo global instance level) when you have the Admin permission of a given build plan ?\r\n\r\nThank you",
