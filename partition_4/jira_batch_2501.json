But I&#x27;ve noticed AndySomerville_HAE constantly mentions \"_Weekly notice: +1 is no longer tracked by the system and sends email to everyone on the thread. Please use the vote link in the upper right instead._\".\n\nNow in some threads he mentions this several times thoughtout the comment  list; but the first thing that struck me was that I had to scroll back to the top of the page to vote for the issue. Where as writing +1 appeared to be easier (I&#x27;ve not done it) as the comment reply box is closer.\n\nExmaple: https://bitbucket.org/site/master/issue/5811/support-two-factor-authentication-bb-7016\n\nh2. The Improvement:\n!2044311852-Capture.PNG|thumbnail!\n\nI&#x27;ve circled the basic idea in red, the edit is simple (this is messy, you can polish it) and involves making the Issue Attribute Box fixed.\n\nNow when the visitor scrolls the page the Issue Attribute box will be fixed on the right giving the appearance that it is scrolling down with the page.\n\nBelow are the details for the quick edits I made using the Chrome Developer Tools:\n\nThen in the select the <div> as shown below:\\\\\n!809194900-Capture10.PNG|thumbnail!\n\nThen again for the <div> shown below:\\\\\n!4270863558-Capture20.PNG|thumbnail!\n\nHere is the CSS in case it is not clear:\n\n{code}\n#!css\n\n.aui-group>.aui-item+.aui-item {\n   padding-left: 20px;\n   position: relative;\n}\n\n.issue-attrs {\n   border: 1px solid #CCC;\n   border-radius: 5px;\n   margin-top: 10px;\n   padding: 10px;\n   position: fixed;\n}\n{code}\n\nThese are only quick messy edits, they will need to be polished and be positioned correctly. But hopefully it shows you a neat way to keep the issue attribute box always visible to your larger screen audience and hopefully reduce the +1 comments because the vote but will be always within reach without having to scroll to back to the top and more importantly *visible*.\n\nAn idea you could use to refine it further would be to detect when the visitor has scrolled to/past the container and if so then make the container fixed.\n\nThanks for reading and I hope that helps.\n\nSteven",
