The main idea is to see something like on the first page of the \"Kanban and Scrum - making the most of both\" book.\n\nhttp://www.infoq.com/minibooks/kanban-scrum-minibook.\n\nThere are exact requriements.\n\n1. We need to limit tickets count for the not finished and finished tickets in one number. Like on the picture. Now haven't this ability and have to put two numbers in two columns. So we have to create two columns for each stage (for example \"Planning\" and \"Planning Done\", \"Development\" and \"Development Done\") and limit maximum count of tickets on each of them. This makes desicion of setting that limitations more complexity and our working process on issues less obvious.\nThere is two options of solving this problem\n* to have one limit for two columns(like in the book)\nor\n* to have ability to see any indication on ticket that it is done on this stage. So we do not need to create two colulms for each stage.\n\nSecond option looks like more simple for implementation.\n2. We need to see definitions of done (DoD) for each stage on the board.\n3. We need to see metric \"lead time\" on the board or in other place.\n4. We need to see indication of capacity exceeding for the stage even if we use filtration by user.\n\nCan we expect the implementation of this features?",

For example, we have a work item type that is very easy for development (1/10 the dev work that other items are) but is the same work for QA and Operations as other work items.  We've found the best way to do that is to be able to configure the column constraints differently for each column, based on a separate field (such as Story Points, or Work Item Weight, or whatever).  So we want to configure one column for a constraint of 3 \"Work Item Weights\" but the next column for a constraint of 5 items.  We can do this today in that old fashioned task board, but were disappointed to find it unavailable in the newfangled Rapid Board.  We're stuck using both, for different things (sigh).",

      "description": "Hi we found that that the GH statistics burndown chart works ok for Daily, well except that its completely unreadable because you can't zoom the graph,but aside from that it basically works.  However if you group by Children, then it doesn't work.  Basically its only counting the story points for issues which were explicitly marked with a Fix Version of one of the children and not also including:\n\n- those marked with the parent version\n- those closed in the same date range as a child version and marked with the parent version.\n\nHere is an example scenario:\n\nSo, lets say I make a parent version 1.0.0 and I then make a child version 1.0.1, and the start date for 1.0.1 is Jan 1st, and its ;end date is Jan 3rd.\n\nNow lets say I create a story with 4 points, and I closed it on Jan 2nd, and I set the Fix Version (when I close) to be 1.0.1 (the child version).\n\nIf I now go to the statistics burndown chart and group by children, it shows zero points left. Perfect! All good.\n\nBut...if I instead do this:\n\n    open the story with 4 points\n    on Jan 2nd close it, and set Fix Version to 1.0.0 (the parent version)\n    go to tteh statistics burndown chart and group by children.\n\nIt will show 4 points remaining.\n\nWe believe what is happening is that even though the documentation says that the grouping is by custom time segments (i.e. jan 1st to the jan 3rd), this is not actually how the chart works.\n\nInstead the chart is only collecting into a child bar, the stories that were explicitly set to that version.\n\nWe tested in our instance of JIRA and we found that this is how the chart is working.\n\nWhy this is wrong:\n\n1) the daily chart isn't working like that, so its inconsistent.\n\n2) if you manage a large team, getting all 200 designers to properly select\nthe explicit Fix Version for the child sprint is (in theory) correct, but\nnot practical. Policing all 200 designers every day is just not practical.\n\nWhen grouping by children, it should include in child versions issues that were either closed during the same time period for the sprint (presuming they have at least the right parent version).\n\nIf you have sub-teams working on different parent versions at the same time, then you can't just pick the stories that were closed within the same time range as a sub-version, they might be completely unrelated! But if the users at least set the fix version to parent version (giving you enough context), then the the child-versions should be inferred from their date ranges and when the story was closed.\n\nThis would ensure that that statistics burndown chart would show the same value sin both daily and children views.\n\nFor this particular issue; we have exactly this case, all of the designers closed the stories during sprints, but for whatever reason, many of them closed the stories with the parent version instead of the exact sprint version. So the daily chart works fine, but the children chart is busted, because it isn't being smart enough to match up the dates when the stories were closed with the child versions.\n\nIt should be able to do that because the Fix version was set to the parent version, so the tool should have enough context to know which sub-versions to map to.",
