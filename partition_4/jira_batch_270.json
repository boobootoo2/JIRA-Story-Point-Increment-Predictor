I don't know if -1 refers to the place in the list, or if -1 is a designation for the \"Please Select...\" option specifically, I hope the latter though.\r\n\r\nI know we don't have any plans to make changes to the Task Board this late in the game, but it would be great if we could make this change to help out the customers that don't have a default resolution set.",

Due to changing requirements (the old story), the release date for 1.0 has been changed from June 1 to September 1.\r\n\r\nNow, in my project-specific dashboard, I have the Agile Gadget showing the burndown chart, and I use the combo box to either look at the current sprint or at 1.0. However, the 1.0 burndown chart keeps showing the time until June 1 on the X axis, showing the project as horribly late, and not progressing (since we are beyond June 1, of course). However, the Agile Gadget does show the correct release date, Sept. 1 near the top.\r\n\r\nUpon further investigation, when opening the 1.0 version in Greenhopper's Planning Board, and toggling visibility to show all data, it shows both a release date (Sept. 1) and an \"end date\" (June 1, still). So apparently, it's the end date, not the release date, that the Agile Gadget is using. But when going to \"Manage Versions\" and trying to edit that version, it only shows me the release date, so there is no way I can set the end date to Sept. 1 as well.",
