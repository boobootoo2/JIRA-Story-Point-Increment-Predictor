When you edit milestone, version or component in repository (issue tracker) settings, sometimes you may end up with sudden remove of previously selected element.\n\nAt first, I thought, that this happens only on non-Latin characters (for example using correct \"b\u0113ta\", which requires UTF-8, in place of incorrect \"beta\"). But it turned out, that it could happen anytime. Simply edit some of your milestone, version or component, refresh page after successful edit and at some point you may end up with {{default}} setting being cleared.\n\nNote: You must refresh page or change configuration section to another and back to current to notice this issue. Even, if {{default}} settings is removed after particular element edit, you won&#x27;t notice this until next page refresh.\n\nBTW: I&#x27;m marking this problem as \"trivial\", though I have a very bad feeling that fixing it won&#x27;t be trivial for Bitbucket core dev team. [Adding {{delete}} link to auto-generated comments|https://bitbucket.org/site/master/issue/8725/an-ability-to-edit-and-delete-all-the] also sounded like trivial thing, but it turned out, that even after half of the year, you have failed to implement it.

      "description": "Hello,\\\\\nRecently we got granted an academic license for Bitbucket for our technical highschool. Awesome. Now the preparation for next years turnus (beginning of september) starts, and I investigated the API a bit.\n\nUnfortunately I was not able to find an API call to create a user.\n\nSo my question/proposal is/would be:\n\nAre there any API calls to create users and teams based on dynamic dataset, which we will receive automatically from our student information management system? I would have to create initially a couple of hundret users and about 50 teams? Do I have to do this manually?\n\nThanks for any help/enlightment.\n\nkind regards\\\\\nKlaus",
