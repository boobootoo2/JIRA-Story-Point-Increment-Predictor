Create a branch and some commits without mentioning the Jira issue key AB-123 (i.e. no link established yet between AB-123 and bitbucket/git just yet - observe that the Jira issue still shows \"Create branch\" as the only available content in its Development panel (Initial state))\r\n 3. Create a PR for that branch and mention AB-123 in the PR \"Description\" field with the intention to link it by doing so\r\n 4. Optional: Approve/Merge the PR\r\n\r\n*Observation:*\r\n\r\nA) In the created PR Description field the string \"AB-123\" is displayed as hyperlink and upon click navigates to the Jira issue with issuekey AB-123 - that is expected behaviour and is OK from my point of view; and it gives the impression that the Jira issue has been linked successfully.\r\n B) When navigating to Jira issue AB-123, the Development panel does not show any information about the PR, the branch, the commits, the deployment status etc.; instead it shows the initial state link \"Create branch\" as the only available content - This is not the expected behaviour from my point of view.\r\n\r\n*Request:*\r\n\r\nAt least there is an inconsistency in linking the Jira issue, as in point A) above it seems like the Jira issue was successfully linked but in point B) above it becomes apparent that this link is only one way.

We\u2019ve been assessing this problem and agree it needs to be resolved. Unfortunately this is a complex task which is going to take some time.\r\n \u00a0\r\n I assure you we\u2019re aiming to have it fixed and would like to thank you for your patience.\r\n \u00a0\r\n While I can\u2019t give an exact date that a fix will be ready, I can share that *it will be a question of months rather than weeks or days*. I recognize that this may be disappointing, but I feel it\u2019s important to be *transparent with you* about the level of effort involved so you can plan accordingly.\r\n \u00a0\r\n Regards,\r\n Ivan Teong\r\n Product Manager, Jira Software Cloud|",

Currently, by referencing a Jira\u00a0ticket in a commit and pushing that commit to GitHub, a reference to that commit will automatically show up on that ticket in Jira.\r\n\r\nThe integration doesn't, however, appear to garbage collect references to dangling commits. These references can crop up very often during the course of normal software development, for example when rebasing, squashing, or cherry picking in git and pushing to GitHub, the \"orphaned\" commits will still have references in Jira on the associated ticket. In git, dangling commits can be removed using `git prune` for garbage collection.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, lack of garbage collection in Jira results in, depending on software workflow, sometimes many (> 10) references to dangling commits on a particular ticket, which reduces the utility of the Jira and GitHub integration. Some mechanism for garbage collection of references on tickets to dangling commits would greatly improve usability. Ideally this would happen automatically behind the scenes, for example via a garbage collection mechanism similar to `git prune` for ticket <-> commit references within Jira. However, even adding the ability to remove commit references manually on tickets would be helpful, e.g. a garbage can icon next to each commit reference.",
