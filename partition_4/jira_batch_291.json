These two JIRA versions are being used to track the current sprint and also the overall version release.\n\nIf the issue is dragged from version \"Sprint 2\" to version \"Sprint 3\" in the planning board, the association with \"Thing A - Release 1.1\" is lost. This is bad! Not only are we losing information, but it is lost silently with no indication to the user.\n\nIt was suggested to me by a colleage that this can be handled by using GreenHopper's version \"Master\" feature: if we made \"Component A - Release 1.1\" a master of \"Sprint 2\" and of \"Sprint 3\" then moving this issue from Sprint 2 to 3 would retain the assocation with \"Thing A - Release 1.1\". \n\nHowever, this only works if *all* items in your sprint are associated with a given 'master' version. It does *not* work if your project has multiple concurrent arallel release streams, and issues for more than one of those streams are being worked on in a single sprint. For instance, if you have two components, each component may have their own \"next release\", as a JIRA version:\n\nJIRA version: \"Thing A - Release 1.1\"\nJIRA version: \"Thing B - Release 2.7\"\n\n(Note that this has nothing to do with JIRA Components - it makes sense that issues under \"Thing B - Release 2.7\" would also be associated with a component called \"Thing B\", but this is orthogonal to versioning and use of the Planning Board in \"versions\" mode).\n\nIn this scenario, we're working on both of these components towards their respective releases in all of our sprints, e.g.:\n\nISSUE-1 belongs to 2 fixVersions (as before):\n   \"Thing A - Release 1.1\"\n   \"Sprint 2\"\n\nISSUE-2 belongs to 2 fixVersions:\n   \"Thing B - Release 2.7\"\n   \"Sprint 2\"\n\nIf I make \"Thing A - Release 1.1\" a master of Sprint 2, then dragging ISSUE-2 from Sprint 2 to Sprint 3 loses its association with \"Thing B - Release 2.7\".\nIf I make \"Thing B - Release 2.7\" a master of Sprint 2, then dragging ISSUE-1 from Sprint 2 to Sprint 3 loses its association with \"Thing A - Release 1.1\".\n\ni.e., we get exactly the same problem as originally described.\n\nI can't make both of them a master of Sprint 2 since this is not supported by GH. It would not make sense to support it either, because that would imply that ALL Issues within Sprint 2 belong to both of the releases - this is clearly not the case.\n\nTherefore the only correct solution I can think of is to ensure that dragging from \"Sprint 2\" to \"Sprint 3\" *only* removes the association with \"Sprint 2\" and adds association to \"Sprint 3\" - *and does not remove any other existing fixVersion associations*.\n\nThe only time it may be acceptable to remove fixversion associations is if you manually do a \"synchronise\".\n\nThanks,\nBaris.",

For example today the vertical scroll bar on the right hands side (in IE) was almost entirely off the edge of the IFrame and so very hard to drag using a touch screen :) Also a JIRA page that would fit nicely in a full screen window doesn't always fit nicely in the IFrame.\n\nHowever, the benefit of not losing your context in the PLANNING BOARD or TASK BOARD when closing the IFrame makes the IFrame invaluable.\n\nSo, it occured to me, what about a compromise? Why not make it so that GH opens a full size IFrame completely covering the GH window, but that when closed takes you back to your previous GH context.\n\nThoughts?",

Also by using the JIRA workflow system more power would be handed to the end user to customise the business logic.\n\nI haven't thought this through, but it strikes me as intriguing..\n\nA major pro of this approach is that, to my mind at least, it more closely matches the real world. With a real white board there may be a clear set of rules behind where most of the sticky notes are placed, but the only thing that really determines where a sticky note is is the person who picks it up and puts it down again. Trying to base the column on logic is going to get ever more complex as witnessed by the discussion and changes on [GHS-408].",
