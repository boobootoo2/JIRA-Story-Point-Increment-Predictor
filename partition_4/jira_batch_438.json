Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Using any workflows that have a Pending for Approval stage, add a direct transition from this status to a different one.\r\n # Create a Service Request with Approvals\r\n # While it is waiting for the approvals to be provided, move the request to a different status (and In Progress or Final status will work).\r\n\r\n*Pending Approvals:*\r\n !1-PendingApproval.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\n*After the premature transition:*\r\n !2-AutoCancelled.png|thumbnail! \r\n !3-AutoResolved.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\n*Transition after all the approvals are granted:*\r\n !4-ExpectedBehavior.png|thumbnail!\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nThe \"Past Approvals\" should be kept.\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nThe \"Past Approvals\" is hidden from the UI (but the information remains available on the backend).\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nIn case you need to view the information from the *Past Approvals* section on the UI, you may transition the issue back to the Waiting for Approval state. \r\n (i) If you wish, you may even complete the necessary approvals on this state, and the issue will proceed to the next stage while the *Past Approvals will be maintained*.\r\n\r\nYou can also visualize who provided their approval directly on the database using the query below (while checking the 'TEST-123' by an actual issue key):\r\n{code:sql}\r\nSELECT apl.\"ID\", CONCAT(prj.pkey, '-', jis.issuenum) AS IssueKey, apd.\"DECISION\" AS Decision, app.lower_user_name AS Approver\r\nFROM \"AO_56464C_APPROVAL\" apl\r\nJOIN \"AO_56464C_APPROVERDECISION\" apd ON apl.\"ID\" = apd.\"APPROVAL_ID\"\r\nJOIN app_user app ON apd.\"USER_KEY\" = app.user_key\r\nJOIN jiraissue jis ON jis.id = apl.\"ISSUE_ID\"\r\nJOIN project prj ON prj.id = jis.project\r\nWHERE CONCAT(prj.pkey, '-', jis.issuenum) = 'TEST-123';\r\n{code}",

However the available fields in which you can choose to add as part of the webhook payload is very limited to a predefined list. Currently as of 4.11, you can only choose the following fields:\r\n * Recipient Name\r\n * Portal name\r\n * Name of person who caused the action\r\n * Issue summary\r\n * Issue description\r\n * Issue key\r\n * Issue reporter\r\n * Issue resolution\r\n * Request URL\r\n * Request status\r\n * Request details.\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nAllow for all issue fields (both system fields and custom fields) to be included in the json payload of that automation webhook.\r\nh3. Why this is important\r\n\r\nThis is already possible in Jira Cloud, due to the integration of codebarrel automation across all projects. This is important because the current state greatly limits the ability to integrate JSD server with other 3rd party products.\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nThe [Automation for Jira Server plugin|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1215460/automation-for-jira-server?hosting=server&tab=overview] (Full version, not Lite) is able to do send webhooks as an automation action.\u00a0 Also you can use [Smart values|https://support.atlassian.com/jira-software-cloud/docs/what-are-smart-values/] in that automation rule in order to select any field in the issue to be included as part of the json payload.",

It is additionally possible to configure that transition to set or clear a Resolution value.\r\n\r\nIt is also possible to configure a custom post-function in a transition (provided by the *Jira Suite Utilities* or *Scriptrunner* third party add-ons for example) to clear an issue's resolution upon the transition being executed.\r\n\r\nIf both of these are configured for the same transition, the resolution clearing functionality will be redundant between the third-party postfunction and JSD's own capability. When this transition is executed from the customer portal, the following problems will occur:\r\n* Even though the resolution will be cleared, the issue history does not record the change.\r\n* If any SLA conditions are to be triggered by \"Resolution: Cleared\", they will not occur. By default, the \"Time to Resolution\" SLA will not be restarted as expected when this happens.\r\n\r\nh3.

Issue Summary\r\n\r\nFor a JSD that uses the local directory and built-in login form, if a user leaves their browser open and takes no action (maintaining a browser session, but not a Jira session), the next action they take (e.g., clicking a link) will result in a redirect to one of JSD\u2019s login pages, but the page will not render, resulting in a blank page.\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n_To reproduce these steps faster, set Jira\u2019s {{session-timeout}} to some small value, like 1 or 2 minutes._\r\n # Log into an instance of Jira Service Desk (e.g. \u201c/servicedesk/customer/portals\u201d); at the login screen, do _not_ check the \u201cKeep me logged in\u201d checkbox\r\n # Access some part of Jira Service Desk (an issue view, portal view, etc.)\r\n # Wait for Jira\u2019s session to expire (optionally, keep an eye on Jira\u2019s security log to know the session has been destroyed)\r\n # Click a link or refresh the page\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nUser should be redirected to a JSD login page; the login form should render, allowing the user to log back in.\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\n*Short version:* The user is redirected to the JSD login page, but an error in the rendering of the page results prevents the login form itself from rendering; instead, the user sees a blank page.\r\n\r\n*Long version / theory:*\r\n # The user is redirected to the JSD login page\r\n # Since the user\u2019s browser session hasn\u2019t ended, their browser will still hold the previous session\u2019s {{JSESSIONID}} cookie, and will send that cookie in the initial set of requests to the login page\r\n # Some of those requests will be to the _/rest/webResources/1.0/resources_ endpoint; this endpoint responds with a 401 when an invalid {{JSESSIONID}} is sent, but the endpoint itself \u2013\u00a0at least for requests from the login page / for assets required for the login page \u2013\u00a0doesn\u2019t actually require a Jira session to return a successful response\r\n # The responses returned by _/rest/webResources/1.0/resources_ are crucial to the continued rendering of the page; once that endpoint responds with a 401, further rendering of the page is blocked, resulting in the blank page\r\n\r\nIt seems like this is, at some level, a Javascript race condition \u2013\u00a0in my attempts to grab a screen recording of this bug, I found that I couldn\u2019t reproduce the bug while trying to record the screen, while every attempt to reproduce while the screen _wasn\u2019t_ being recorded resulted in the flow described above.\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nUsers can get around this issue by clearing their cookies or restarting their browser (or taking whatever steps are necessary for their particular browser for the current _browser_ session cookies to be considered \"expired\").\r\n\r\nIf the JSD service is behind a load balancer or other traffic manager which supports scripting and supports modifying requests before forwarding, such a script can be written which removes the {{JSESSIONID}} when:\r\n # the HTTP method is POST\r\n # the request path is _*/rest/webResources/1.0/resources_\r\n # the referer is one of JSD\u2019s login pages (e.g. _*/servicedesk/customer/*/login*_)",

Problem Definition\r\n\r\nWhen a notification generated by a Software issue is forwarded to a JIRA Service Desk (JSD) email channel account, the original Software issue is updated with a comment rather than a new JSD ticket being opened.\r\nh5. Background\r\n\r\nThis is considered expected behavior because the handler/channel is processing the incoming mail [based on Message ID|https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirakb/how-jira-updates-issues-from-email-611812070.html]. There are many business use-case scenarios where this behavior is undesirable.\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nIf a Software email notification is forwarded to a JSD email channel account and does not include the Software issue key in the Subject line, the incoming message should be processed as a new JSD issue.\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nThere are two workarounds:\r\n # Copy/Paste the contents of the Software notification into a new message and send to the JSD email channel.\r\n # Create a new issue in the JSD project, then change the Subject line to reflect the new JSD issue key before forwarding the email notification.",

Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n- Install a fresh Service Desk 4.8.0 instance\r\n- Create a Service Desk project\r\n- Configure a Service Desk Mail handler in *Project Settings > Email Requests*\r\n- Send a new email to the mail handler, including 2 attachments of exact same name\r\n--  (!) Note that the 2 files don't need to have the same content. Only the filename matters to replicate the bug\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nA new ticket is created from this email and no error is thrown in the Mail Processing logs or Jira log file.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nA new ticket is created from this email and an error is thrown in the Mail Processing logs or Jira log file.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nh4. Workaround 1\r\n\r\nRemove any attachment with duplicate file name before sending an email to the Service Desk Mail Handler.\r\n\r\nh4. Workaround 2\r\n\r\nDisable the dark feature {{sd.email.attachments.store.duplicates}} by:\r\n- Going to the page: <JIRA_BASE_URL>/secure/SiteDarkFeatures!default.jspa\r\n- Adding {{sd.email.attachments.store.duplicates.disabled}} to the list of dark features, as shown in the screenshot below:\r\n !DarkFeature.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\nh3. Important notes\r\n\r\nThis bug is similar to the bug JSDSERVER-6884, however:\r\n- the steps to replicate it are different\r\n- the fix implemented for this bug is different than for the other one, therefore the fix version is different for both bugs\r\n- the workaround involving the dark feature *only works for this bug*, but not for the other one",
