However when using the new view we divide out backlogs into sprints instead of dividing the backlog using different versions in the classic planning board. The new view is much more easy to work with especially the simplicity to do re-planning (change sprint velocity) just by dragging and dropping the bottom part of the sprint boxes. However we lost one very important thing moving from Fix-version to the new artifact \u201cSprint\u201d and that is the visibility of the future plan of a backlog items. \r\n\r\nProblem\r\nWhen requesting information about an Issue (User Story), the Agile Panel on the issue view page contains information regarding only the started or completed sprints in which the issue has been planned. For us and I do think for others as well it is crucial to know when an Issue (User Story) has been planned in the future.\r\n\r\nFeature request\r\nWe really need to be able to be able to find out the name of a sprint to which and Issue have been assign even though the sprint is not yet started.
