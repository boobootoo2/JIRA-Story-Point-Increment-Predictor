      "description": "h4. Experienced Behavior:\r\n\r\nIssues moved to a JIRA Service Desk project do not show SLA information when the SLA would be in a stopped state after the issue is moved.\r\n* SLA does show when it would be in a paused or started/running after the issue is moved.\r\n\r\nThe SLA will appear if there is a start condition that allows the SLA to restart and, after the move, an action is taken that meets this condition. In this situation the SLA appears and begins to count down as expected however the first SLA cycle icon does not appear.\r\n\r\nh4. Expected Behavior:\r\n\r\nSLA value is calculated and displayed for all issues moved to Service Desk project regardless of SLA state after the move.\r\n\r\nh4. Steps to reproduce:\r\n* Create two projects, one of which is a Service Desk\r\n* Create issue in non service desk project\r\n* Take an action on the issue that would meet Service Desk stop condition\r\n* Move issue to service desk project\r\n* The SLA does not appear when viewing the issue\r\n\r\nh4. Use Case Example:\r\n\r\n\"We have a project that is NOT using Jira Service Desk (JSD). If we \"work\" on it, assign it, comment on it, etc and then move it to a project that is using JSD, the time to first response SLA is not displayed.\"",

[See the corresponding bug report|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSDCLOUD-735].\n  {panel}\n\nHello!\r\nAfter installing \"Service Desk\" I created project with a role \"Service Desk Customers\". After this i wrote a plugin which is trying to find user's project roles using JIRA API.\r\nThe problem is that for users with this role plugin can not find this role. As a result, I need to do some administrative or programmatic workarounds.\r\nHope you can help me.\r\nThanks in advance, Andrey.",

Would you fix it (or even it isn't work incorrect) in Jira Service Desk?\r\n\r\nThis is description of the problem:\r\nWe observed some bug in calculation of due date.\r\nBelow is the scenario for getting this incorrect behaviour:\r\n1. We have registered issue (for example 1.08.2014) with Start SLA in the future, for example today: 11.08.2014\r\n2. This issue has Time SLA which should start calculating today 11.08.2014, but work is in progress from 1.08.2014.\r\n3. From 1.08.2014 this clock was frozen for 10 hours (for example in 5-6.08.2014).\r\n4. When Time SLA starts today, it has \"-10h\" in \"Consumed time\", which ist't correct, because it should start today and it shouldn't take into account the time when clock was frozen.\r\nWhen Consumed time is calculate as negative, Due date is also incorrect.\r\n\r\nPlease let us know whether this problem occurs in Jira Service Desk and if it'll be fix.\r\n\r\nBest regards, \r\nMalgorzata Mroz",

First let me say that makes sense and I agree. \r\n\r\nHowever, in a case like we are in now, having really just got going with Service Desk and still trying to focus our SLA in the tool, it would be nice at that time to have the option to reindex *all* of the issues.  We are not changing the underlying theory of our SLAs, just trying to focus your tool to get them all as correct as possible.  This has taken a number of iterations, but would be valid for all of our data. \r\n\r\nIn closing, we just think there should be an option, not the default option at all, but a admin only option that would allow the SLA to be processed on all tickets regardless of their status.

The queues provide this, but rather than having an infinite number of queues we would prefer to be able to hand this to our users.    What we would like is the ability to : \r\n\r\na) filter within a Service Desk Queue based on fields in much the same was as auto filter works in Excel.  This should be allowed for all fields with the exception of the issue key.  In this way we could have Queues based on the workflow step, and the user being able to apply a filter to allow them to only see certain fields for say client, location, (and as we work in the oil industry) rigs, wells\r\n\r\nb) the ability to sort on any column (field) in a queue by clicking on the column header.  Options should be ASC or DESC.  In this way the user could do this rather than being set by an administrator.  Additionally setting this by an administrator appears to have a bug ( (JRA-39263) Service Desk - Unable to sort in a Queue)",
