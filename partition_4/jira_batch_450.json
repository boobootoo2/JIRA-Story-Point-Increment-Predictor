      "description": "h3. Summary\r\n\r\nCurrently, the Satisfaction Survey is only partially translated in case you leave the default question to be asked instead of customising it. It seems that all the other phrases in the survey, for example each of the five stars subtitle (i.e.:\"Good\", \"Very Good\"), are correctly translated based on the customer's profile configured language, however, the default question itself \"How was our service for this request\" is translated, or not, based on the application's default language, making the survey language inconsistent.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1) Jira application default language is English\r\n2) SD Project's default language is English, but Portuguese is an added preferred language as well.\r\n3) Customer's profile configured language is set to Portuguese (pt-BR).\r\n4) The Satisfaction Survey question is not customised (default question is always \"How was our service for this request?\").\r\n\r\nCustomer has mainly English customers, but also have customers that speak Portuguese.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected results\r\n\r\nUser will receive the survey on his e-mail all translated correctly to Portuguese, including the survey's question, based on his profile's configured default language as per [our documentation|https://confluence.atlassian.com/servicedeskcloud/translating-your-customer-portal-and-supporting-multiple-languages-886180551.html].\r\n{quote}Customers can set their preferred language in their profile. If they don't, your portal detects the language set in your customer's browser. It will try to display this language first.\r\n\r\nIf you don't support their preferred language, the portal displays the project's default language. We recommend setting the default language to match the native language of the majority of your customers.{quote}\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nCustomer receives a survey with most of the field translated to Portuguese correctly, however, the survey's question itself is in English.\r\n\r\nh3. Troubleshooting\r\n\r\nWe found that the survey's question always responds to the application default language, ignoring the customer's profile default language and the project's default language as well. It seems that this field behaves differently from the other fields in the survey, as you can see in the image attached.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nIf you customise the survey's question, it will show exactly what you have wrote in the field for everybody, so none of these rules applies. This doesn't work for projects that works with customers that speaks different languages, as it won't be translated in any way. The behaviour we're reporting this bug is for the default survey question that is already set on the application.\r\n\r\nOn both cases, this doesn't work for the customer as she has customers from different countries and neither setting a customised fixed questions that won't be translated or setting the application default language to the alternate language is applicable.",

When this situation happens:\r\n - the log analyzer returns the following error:\r\n{code:java}\r\nLoading Requests with Anonymous Comments in the Customer Portal fails with 500 error NullPointerException\r\n{code}\r\n\r\n - the following error can be found in the JIRA logs (please note that some text has been replaced with XXXXX for confidentiality purpose):\r\n{code:java}\r\n2017-12-05 09:08:00,541 XXXXXXXXXX ERROR XXXXXXX XXXXXXX XXXXXX XXXXXXXX /rest/servicedesk/1/customer/models [c.a.p.r.c.error.jersey.ThrowableExceptionMapper] Uncaught exception thrown by REST service: key not found: 114\r\njava.util.NoSuchElementException: key not found: 20\r\n\tat scala.collection.MapLike$class.default(MapLike.scala:228)\r\n\tat scala.collection.AbstractMap.default(Map.scala:59)\r\n\tat scala.collection.MapLike$class.apply(MapLike.scala:141)\r\n\tat scala.collection.AbstractMap.apply(Map.scala:59)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.servicedesk.internal.feature.customer.request.list.RequestListSearchResultsFactory$$anonfun$9$$anonfun$apply$1.apply$mcZ$sp(RequestListSearchResultsFactory.scala:176)\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nA possible consequence of this bug is that if a customer tries to go \"My Requests\" from the Customer Portal and selects \"Closed requests\" or \"Any status\", all the fields get grayed out and nothing happens. The only way to get the dropdown menus to work is to use the browser back-button.\r\nh3. +Steps to reproduce+\r\n\r\nThe steps to reproduce this issue are currently unknown, as it is in theory not possible to delete the \"Summary\" field from the JIRA GUI. This issue might be occurring due to a direct database manipulation or the usage of a 3rd party add-on.\r\nh3. +Workaround+\r\n\r\nTo verify if you are impacted by this bug, run the following query in the JIRA database (please replace XX with the ID next to \"Uncaught exception thrown by REST service: key not found: \" from the error message found in the log):\r\n{code:java}\r\nselect * from \"AO_54307E_VIEWPORTFIELD\" where \"FORM_ID\" = XX;\r\n{code}\r\nIf this query does not return any row, then it means that the request type that has the ID XX does not have any field.\r\n\r\nTo fix this issue:\r\n # Run the following query in the database to get the name of the invalid Request Type (please replace XX with the same value as the other query):\r\n{code:java}\r\nselect \"NAME\" from \"AO_54307E_VIEWPORTFORM\" where \"ID\" = XX;\r\n{code}\r\n\r\n # Open JIRA and look for this Request Type in the impacted Service Desk project by going to Project Settings > Request Types\r\n # Click on \"Edit fields\" next to \"Internal IT\"\r\n # Click on \"Add a field\", and choose the \"Summary\" field",

Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Configure the \"Transition on Comment\" rule as noted above\r\n# Configure Approval for a status in your workflow\r\n# Open a request and add an Approver that is not a Reporter/Participant\r\n# Have this Approver make an external comment on the request\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n# Request should automatically transition.  The Automation system should evaluate any customer user as a Customer no matter which user picker field it exists in.  \r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nNotice that the request does not transition, and that you see the same output as the attached screenshot which shows the rule processing the request as NOT from a Customer user.  \r\n\r\nh3. Notes\r\nIn this instance, the Approver is a Customer management and not an Agent/Agent Manager\r\n\r\nh3.Workaround\r\nAdd the Approver as a participant or share the issue with the Approver's organization.",

Our customers may believe that they have raised a ticket with us when in fact their email has gone nowhere. We are using 'noresponse@domain'. Although\u00a0the address is self explanatory, we all know you cannot assume anything with customers!\r\n\r\nI contacted your Support who were very helpful but said I can only configure a bounceback if I turn on the requests but is not an option for us.\r\n\r\nCan we have a new feature to use a bounceback mail if you disable the requests please?\u00a0\r\n\r\nExample,\u00a0\r\n\r\nThank you for contacting <CompanyName>, if you need Technical Support please visit <PortalURL> as this account is not monitored.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nKind Regards,\r\n\r\nAoife Duggan",

Notes\r\n * The transition is firing an issueevent, but this event is also subsequently triggering other actions on the same thread. In turn when SD goes to check this issue in order to create the jsd notification, the status has already changed for that issue which in turn is generating this inconsistent cache state as an error that indicates jsd cannot send a message on this issue.\r\n * It is possible that other event based actions in Jira could also be affected by this bug. So far we just focused on notifications not working. But it follows that other event driven features such as automation, could be affected by these nested events not all getting fired as expected.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n # navigate to $JIRAURL /secure/SiteDarkFeatures!default.jspa you will need to be a Jira system administrator to reach this page\r\n # remove the feature flag \"sd.internal.base.off.thread.on.completion.events.enabled\"\r\n # While this work-around can help prevent the event based problems noted in this bug, once the upgrade for 3.9.2 has been released/applied, I would recommend turning back on \"sd.internal.base.off.thread.on.completion.events.enabled\" so that get the benefits of faster requests (SLA indexing / updating and others will happen asynchronously).",

Summary\r\nResolve/Close request transitions in a Service Desk instance do not trigger the appropriate notifications to Agents/JIRA Users according to the notification scheme.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Define users/groups under the Issue Resolved and/or Issue Closed notification settings of a Service Desk project's notification scheme.\r\n# Create a Service Desk request in the Service Desk of step 1\r\n# Resolve the request of step 2\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nThe users or members of the group as defined under step 1 should receive notifications of the request being resolved\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nThe members of the group or entities do not receive any notifications of the request resolution\r\n\r\nh3. Root cause\r\nIn the Service Desk default generated workflow, the transition that resolves requests fires a Generic Event in the transition post-functions.\r\nThe notification scheme however acts on the Issue Resolved event. Since this is not defined in the post-functions, no notifications will be send.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\nThere are 2 possible workarounds for this issue.\r\n# Add the users/groups in the notification scheme to the \"Generic Event\" instead of the \"Issue Resolved\" notification. This will however trigger notifications on all Generic Events within that project to the defined user/groups\r\n# In the relevant workflows, change the \"Fire a Generic event\" to \"Fire a Issue Resolved event\". Ensure you do this for all resolve issue transitions in all workflows, and do not forget to publish the workflows after the changes have been made in order for the changes to take effect",

      "description": "h3. Problem Definition\r\n\r\nAccording to [JIRA Service Desk 3.6.x release notes|https://confluence.atlassian.com/servicedesk/jira-service-desk-3-6-x-release-notes-915154145.html], the SLA rendering has been improved to include days and weeks.\r\n\r\nThis improvement is not documented in the official [SLA documentation|https://confluence.atlassian.com/servicedeskserver/setting-up-slas-939926373.html].\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Why this is important\r\n\r\nIt is really important to explain how the new rendering works and how the number of days is calculated, because the way it is calculated now is complex and not straight forward, and doesn't always make sense to our customer.\r\n\r\nHere is an example:\r\n- Let's assume that there is a calendar with 5 days a week and 8 hours per day.\r\n- Let's assume that there is an SLA configured with this calendar and a goal of 40h (1 week).\r\n- There will be situations where the remaining time will be displayed in the issue view as 3d 14h.\r\n- This rendering can be confusing for the user. Since 1 day = 8 hours, it would make \"more sense\" that the displayed time is 4d 6h instead of 3d 14h, without having any documentation explaining how the time is displayed.\r\n\r\nh3. Suggestions:\r\n\r\n# Provide a clear documentation explaining how the number of days is calculated in the SLA\r\n# Provide the JIRA Admin with the option to modify the way the time is rendered (for example, provide the option to display 4d6h instead of 3d14h)\r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "description": "We love the customer satisfaction module, but I'd like to have a little more control over it as a manager.\u00a0\r\n\r\nSpecifically, I'd like to allow admins to change/remove scores. Why? Because sometimes users get confused and select 1 thinking that's the best or have mouse/Outlook/browser issues that somehow result in a 1 star rating. When I call them to ask them why they rated a member on our team a 1, they say they were happy with the service and meant to give a 5. So I'd like to either just blow away that 1 or be able to edit based on what the user says. For disclosure, you could put any 'edited' scores permanently in a different color - say green stars vs yellow stars on the report page for customer satisfaction. That would keep abuse to a minimum because it would be clear that the score changed. We could use an internal comment to justify the change. Out of fairness to my team, my upper management isn't going to care that an end user made a mistake and gave an individual one star\u00a0but absolutely will consider that 1 star part of their overall work performance which is a bummer. I want to be able to go to bat for them to manually override a legitimate error if it occurs. This feature, of course, could be disabled in the project settings for those who don't want to allow any modifications.\r\n\r\nThanks for considering!\r\n\r\n\u00a0",

      "description": "h3. Summary\r\n\r\nStarting in JIRA 7.4.0/JSD 3.6.0, a new *Request Type Cache* was introduced, which helped improve the performance of various parts of JIRA Service Desk which were originally more database intensive. This cache is invalidated in certain circumstances; generally when changes are made to JIRA's Issue Types or Request Types, just for example.\r\n\r\nOne specific circumstance where the cache would be invalidated and rebuilt would be when a field is present on a Request Type, where that same field is not present on the Create Issue Screen associated with that Request Type's *Issue Type* and *Project*. This marks the field as an *Obsolete* field, which JIRA will be able to repair by removing the field off of the Request Type.\r\n\r\n(x)\u00a0This logic does not work properly if a dynamic field (such as JIRA Service Desk's *Organizations* field) is being treated as an *Obsolete* field. If *Organizations* is removed off of the *Create Issue Screen* associated with the Request Type, JIRA will invalidate the Request Type Cache and attempt to repair the Request Type by removing *Organizations*, which is not possible.\r\n\r\nThis will cause JIRA to always try to invalidate the cache upon loading the Customer Portal or accessing the Request Type in question, leading to excessive database calls as the cache is rebuilt over and over again. This can lead to performance issues (e.g. Slow Loading Customer Portals) in larger environments, or in environments where there are very many Request Types.\r\nh3. Environment\r\n * JIRA 7.4.0+/JSD 3.6.0+\r\n\r\nh3.

Problem Definition\r\nIn [Serving customers with a knowledge base|https://confluence.atlassian.com/servicedeskserver038/serving-customers-with-a-knowledge-base-935909471.html], there's a setting for Viewing Access that says *All active users and customers* rather than *Only licensed users*. \r\n\r\nIn Cloud, this automatically gives access to a Service Desk Customer when searching the Knowledge Base that is linked to a Service Desk Project. When they click on an article, it automatically loads the article. This is likely due to Cloud having SSO.\r\n\r\nHowever, in Server, it doesn't necessarily have a method that passes on the login to Confluence to allow access. When clicking on the article, it passes them to the following login prompt:\r\n\r\n !Screen Shot 2017-11-16 at 5.24.44 PM.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\nWhen users see this, it causes confusion since the article doesn't mention this prompt at all, and many assume, as myself and many others did, that it requires a Confluence login here. However, this is not the case, and the user is able to login with the same Service Desk Customer account that they used to access the Customer Portal.\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\nUpdate the article above to include information about the login process, so customers do know if they aren't using SSO or something that passes the login information between instances that they will need to login again using the same Service Desk Customer details.\r\n\r\nh3. Why this is important\r\nI was able to find a few bugs in jira.atlassian.com that were closed simply due to this misunderstanding, and it's a question I get a lot in Community, so I feel that clarification is needed.",
