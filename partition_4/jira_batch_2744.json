I have good news! We\u2019ve been hard at work on an all-new [Organization audit log|https://www.atlassian.com/software/access/guide/elements/organization-audit-log], which brings a complete log of all of your company-owned managed accounts login activity. This includes password resets and log in attempts. The log retains these activities for 6 months, but can be exported to CSV or via our organizations API. You must have an Atlassian Access subscription to view these activities. \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or suggestions for future reporting functionality, please don\u2019t hesitate to email me at rgarg@atlassian.com or comment on this ticket.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nRak Garg\r\nAtlassian Product Management\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\nh3.

There's not a way to review the users' access logs for the last {{x Days}}, {{x Weeks}}, {{x Months}}, etc.\r\n\r\nh3.

Similar to the first approach this will make the account holding the link managed and our system will be able to re-do the linking on a new login. Note that by verifying the new domain all users from this domain will start using your SSO configuration and will be notified.\r\n* Re-do the SAML integration. This will make all new logins create a new SAML link, thus the affected users will have a new link created to their correct account and will be able to log in.\r\n\r\nIf none of those approaches are feasible for your use case please contact [support|https://support.atlassian.com].",

This can also happen due to a secondary email alias on the IDP while Atlassian Account doesn't support any form of aliasing. \r\n\r\nWhen an Org Admin encounters this. Help is needed from support. \r\n\r\n- No straightforward indication from org admin of the wrong email address that is synced (ie. External ID connected with the email address propagated to Atlassian: ie. SCIM logs). \r\n- The Atlassian Account with the wrong email address needs to be unsynced. Perform email address change in Atlassian side if data migration is required.\r\n- The Account needs to be reprovisioned in the IDP side by re-assigning the user to the group.\r\n\r\nUnsyncing a user is not a straight forward operation.

This is a feature and not a bug. We\u2019ve designed the search this way to allow for flexibility and allow admins to find what they\u2019re looking for when they aren\u2019t sure of the exact search string. Here is an example of how searching might work:\r\n\r\n1. An admin searches for \u2018robertsmith\u2019\r\n 2. A user who\u2019s email is robertsmith@atlassian.com will show on top of the search results, since this is the longest closest match\r\n 3. A user who\u2019s email is alicesmith@atlassian.com will show further in the search results, because this user has \u2018smith\u2019 in common with the original \u2018robertsmith\u2019\r\n\r\nWe hope this clarifies search behavior on the managed accounts page. Please feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions!\r\n\r\nCheers, \r\n Rak Garg\r\n Product Manager, Atlassian Access\r\n{panel}\r\nh3. Issue Summary\r\n\r\nThe search in managed accounts fails when the complete email of the user is provided in the search textbox.\u00a0\u00a0\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Go to the \"Managed Accounts\" of an organisation.\r\n # Search users using the complete email id(including the domain).\r\n\r\nh3.

Actual Results\r\n\r\nRandom users are shown as the search tries to find users based on the domain as well, which matches a lot of other users.\r\nh3.
