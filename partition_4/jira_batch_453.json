This will also help the agents to check those emails that are Rejected whether it is important or not.\r\n\r\nh3. Suggestion Solution:\r\nIt will be great if there is a drop down for the Processing Log for each email status which will reveal the Email Body where the Agent could review it. For now, for the drop down to show just for the email that is Rejected will be useful.\r\n\r\nh3.

Notes\r\nThe bottleneck is with permission checking for organization membership, which is done for each portal against the database by isMemberOfAnyOrganizationInProject():\r\n{code}\r\nselect count(\"AO_54307E_ORGANIZATION_MEMBER\".\"ID\") from \"public\".\"AO_54307E_ORGANIZATION_MEMBER\" \"AO_54307E_ORGANIZATION_MEMBER\" inner join \"public\".\"AO_54307E_ORGANIZATION\" \"AO_54307E_ORGANIZATION\" on \"AO_54307E_ORGANIZATION\".\"ID\" = \"AO_54307E_ORGANIZATION_MEMBER\".\"ORGANIZATION_ID\" inner join \"public\".\"AO_54307E_ORGANIZATION_PROJECT\" \"AO_54307E_ORGANIZATION_PROJECT\" on \"AO_54307E_ORGANIZATION_PROJECT\".\"ORGANIZATION_ID\" = \"AO_54307E_ORGANIZATION\".\"ID\" where \"AO_54307E_ORGANIZATION_PROJECT\".\"PROJECT_ID\" = ? and \"AO_54307E_ORGANIZATION_MEMBER\".\"USER_KEY\" = ? limit ?\r\n{code}\r\nWhile the query itself may be executed very quickly, this begins to have a significant impact with instances with large number of portals because the query is being executed multiple times against the database directly, while executing the {{GET /portals}} request to ServiceDesk.\r\n\r\nh3.Workaround\r\nThe workaround is to disable [Service Desk's Customer Organization feature|https://confluence.atlassian.com/servicedeskserver035/setting-up-service-desk-users-894759487.html#Settingupservicedeskusers-manageorgsManageorganizations] on the instance. Just a heads up on the main implication of disabling this feature, basically users will now need to manually list out members of their organization they would like to share their request with and cannot simply share with the entire organization once this feature is disabled.\r\n\r\nSteps to disable the feature\r\n# Log in to the following path on your test instance: <jira-base-url>/secure/admin/SiteDarkFeatures!Default.jspa\r\n# Add the following parameter {{sd.customer.orgs.group.participants.disabled}} to the _Enable Dark Feature_ field and click Add",

      "description": "Hi Atlassian Team,\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nI love your products and I'm playing with the JIRA Service Desk to compare it with some others similar products. I really like the project and the features you purpose.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nBut there's one behaviour\u00a0that is not compliant with my expectations : the recipients/CC/BCC visibility and management when JIRA Desk sends notifications, like when the agent add a comment to a ticket.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nIn my current company, we are quite every time several people to work on the same support tickets : Agents (internal people), Customers ( several people from the same company), and Third Parties (several people from different companies). It's due to the role of my company in the workflow.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nSo, from an agent side, we have to manage who are the Recipients, the CC and sometimes the BCC. 2 consecutive comments could be sent with different Recipients/CC/BCC. \u00a0And the current way to manage it is to change\u00a0the\u00a0Request participants and the Watchers for every comments.... \u00a0not very fun and source of mistakes.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe best would be to have the possibility to select (drag&drop) the Recipients/CC/BCC before sending the comment, and potentially for other notifications.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nIs that something you could manage in the future?\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThanks & Regards,\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nEdouard\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0",

      "description": "Hello \r\nI'd like to suggest some features to extend the possibilities available on request sharing in customer portal.\r\nWhy I'm asking for this is that in many companies rather complicated structure and supervisors often want to see and control requests created by their staff.\r\nCurrently requester could be forced to share his requests by default but with all the organization. Automatic sharing on request creation with single user is not available. And sharing with all organization is not really secure.\r\nSharing with hands is annoying and people can forget to share request.\r\nAnother problem is that requesters forced to share their requests by default if they are included in one organization only. Yes they can choose the private mode, but forget to do it.\r\nSo what I'm suggesting is to make more options available on request sharing:\r\n * option for requester profile to share requests to a single person (supervisor) controlled by administrator\r\n * option to add shares on request creation ( I think some kind of multi-user picker field available in the request template for customer portal will do the job)\r\n * option for customer portal so administrator could choose if requesters can share their requests by default or have to do it manually.\r\n * option to block sharing of the request for specific users.\r\n * and the most important option - view requests in organization access should be controllable so administrator could choose users that can view requests in organization.\r\n\r\n\r\n Please get back to me for any clarification.\r\nThank you very much for a great product and let's make it even better!\r\nBest regards, Nikolay",

Issue Summary\r\n\r\nWhen a user creates an issue via email, because JIRA service desk only allows the project to have one incoming mail channel, if the issue is then moved to a different issue type, would stop sending notifications and finding the impacted issues would be quite difficult. \r\n\r\nh5. Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n# Create an issue in a Service Desk project via customer portal.\r\n# Move the issue to a different issue type because as the agent you see it is not raised under the correct request type.\r\n\r\nh5. Observation\r\n\r\nJIRA Service Desk would clear out the customer request type field found on the right hand panel under service desk following the move. The problem however is that it does not also reset the customer request type field entirely, it just clears the Request Type field we see on the panel to _No Match_ as seen below:\r\n !Selection_069.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\nThis can be confirmed by adding the Customer Request Type to the view issue screen.\r\n\r\nh5. Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nJIRA Service Desk would clear the request type also removing all values from the field and allow admins to be able to find issues which have no request type using the query\r\n{code}\r\n\"Customer Request Type\" is EMPTY\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nh5. Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nAs shown in the image earlier, the data that was originally in the field is still in the actual Customer Request Type field and using the JQL in the above query would result in an empty query though the Request Type field shows no match.\r\n\r\nh5. Workaround\r\n\r\nUser would need to query the JIRA instance for all issues of a particular issue type that do not have the expected Request type associated with them using a query like the below:\r\n{code}\r\n\"Customer Request Type\" != \"<add the request type expected for the issue type here>\" and project = \"Your Project\" and issuetype = \"your issue type\"\r\n\r\n/* It there are more than 2 or more issues, modify the query to*/\r\n\"Customer Request Type\" not in \"<add the request type expected for the issue type here>\" and project = \"Your Project\" and issuetype = \"your issue type\"\r\n{code}",

This will make the user to be required to put captcha in a single failed login attempt.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce:\r\n# Create a new customer.\r\n# Exclude the customer on every Customer Portal\r\n# Get the portal link for a ticket\r\n# Access the link and try to log in using the new customer\r\n# An error will be showing up that the user is not allowed to log in, not telling that the request is not accessible.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Result:\r\n* The customer will be logged in and then a notice that the request is not accessible will be shown.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Result:\r\n* It will said that the login failed due to wrong username/password and the logs will show that multiple login attempts that force the user to do captcha check later.
