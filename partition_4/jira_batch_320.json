Problem description\nGiven there is a Live Plan importing issue from a number of different projects and some of these projects need to have strict permission restrictions.\nIf a user does not have the \"Schedule Issue\" permission on one of these projects he will be able to \"scenario\"-rank issues of these projects in the Live Plan, but he won't be able to commit these changes - keeping them forever in the Uncommitted changes list.\n\nh3. Suggestion(s)\nOne solution would be to provide an option to decouple ranking between JIRA and the Live Plan for one or more issue sources. If issues from these issue sources are ranked these are excluded from committing.\nAnother would be to introduce a more sophisticated permission scheme for ranking in Portfolio.\nA thisd option would be to provide the possibility to ignore certain changes on the commit list (forever).",

But I am still having conflict problems with changes made to issues in Software and uncommitted changes to those same issues in Portfolio.\n\nFor instance (in this example we'll say the original release is _Version 1.0_ for the story):\n\n# First, I'll change the Release for the story in Portfolio to _Version 2.0_. It will show as an Uncommitted change, as it should\n# Next, I will go into that same story in Software and change the Release to _Version 2.5_. It updates there, so far so good\n# Finally I go back into Portfolio, I have an uncommitted change that is different than my latest update to that same issue in Software.  There is no easy way to tell when looking through uncommitted changes what the effect would be\n# If I revert the change in Portfolio, it will show the release as 2.5, the one I made in step 2\n# If I commit the change in Portfolio, it will update the issue in Software as well to 2.0, the one I made in step 1\n\nI don't know what the right solution would be.  Any change made in Software overrides any uncommitted changes in Portfolio?  A better view of uncommitted changes to know if there are conflicts between the two?",

Workaround\n\nBased on our investigations so far, this bug occurs when calculating the schedule (work assignments) for Agile sprints if the capacity of at least one of the people working on this sprint is exceeded.\nIn order to get the plan working again please adapt the scope of all imported Agile sprints manually by either removing issues from the sprint or adapting their estimates.\n\nWe are working on this and hope to provide fix soon.",

When there are multiple backlogs and teams working on the same Plan, it may get an unexpected result.\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\n\nHave Backlog A and Backlog B runs in parallel on two different backlogs with assigned to two different teams.\n\nBacklog A has the following backlog (rank in brackets):\n BACKLOGA-1 (1)\n BACKLOGA-2 (2)\n BACKLOGA-3 (3)\n BACKLOGA-4 (4)\n BACKLOGA-5 (5)\n\nBacklog B has the following backlog (rank in brackets)\n BACKLOGB-1 (6)\n BACKLOGB-2 (7)\n BACKLOGB-3 (8)\n BACKLOGB-4 (9)\n BACKLOGB-5 (10)\n\nIf BACKLOGA-1 has a dependency on BACKLOGB-2 it does not schedule it straight after BACKLOGB-2 completes (which it should, because it is first in the backlog and has the highest rank).\nh3. Expected Results\n\nBACKLOGA-1 scheduled right after BACKLOGB-2\nh3. Actual Results\n\nBACKLOGA-1 scheduled after BACKLOGA-5\nh3.

Problem\nIn a plan that uses default estimates, an issue receives an \"Item ignored - The estimates on this item are too small.\" violation which prevents the issue from being scheduled. However, entering a value of 0 will keep the issue from being scheduled anyway, so the only notable effect of this is the violation showing up on the issue in the scope table. The violation should not be there, but does not make a difference from a scheduling point-of-view.\n\nh2. Work-around\nRemove the explicit estimate of 0 on the issue (which will cause the issue to be unestimated, unless it receives an estimate via estimate conversion set up for its issue source. In that case, the secondary estimate should be removed from the issue, if possible).",
