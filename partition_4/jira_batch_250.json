      "description": "{panel:bgColor=#e7f4fa}\n  *NOTE:* This bug report is for *JIRA Software Server*. Using *JIRA Software Cloud*? [See the corresponding bug report|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSWCLOUD-6471].\n  {panel}\n\n In GreenHopper, it is possible for us to configure the a scrum board filter to include other projects, or only include certain issues of a project by attributes as needed. Because of this, there's a possibility that users may accidentally include a sub task to a Sprint while actually the parent task is excluded from the Sprint. When this scenario happen, the following error will be produced if we try to generate a Sprint Report:\n!scshot1.png!\n\nA simple steps to reproduce the problem:\n- Create a new project with 1 issue having 1 subtask\n- Create a scrum board for the project\n- Go to the Plan board and include the parent issue in a Sprint (subtask won't be displayed in the plan board). Start the Sprint\n- Modify the board filter (Configure > Filter > View in Issue Navigator), exclude the parent task from the filter. Save.\n- Back to the Scrum, try to generate Sprint Report and the problem is reproducible.\n\nIt'll be great if we have the feature to exclude a sub task if the parent issue is not included, or add a more meaningful message that may help customer to understand the root cause of the problem. \n\nh3. Workaround\nRemove the subtask without the parent from the JIRA Agile (formerly GreenHopper) board. Identifying the problematic issues is not a trivial process, and can be done with either of the following workarounds:\n\nh5. Using JQL\n\n# Identify the board which is causing the problems and copy the filter from it in *Board > Configure > Filter > Filter Query*. For example:\n{noformat}\nproject = \"Sample Scrum Project\" ORDER BY Rank ASC\n{noformat}\n# Add {{AND type not in subTaskIssueTypes()}} to it (see the below example) and then search for that filter in the Issue Navigator, so as to return all the parent issues.\n{noformat}\nproject = \"Sample Scrum Project\" AND type not in subTaskIssueTypes() ORDER BY Rank ASC\n{noformat}\n# Those issuekeys will need be collected and collated for comparison against a filter again. This can either by done by exporting the results to CSV and extracting them from there, or by using the Javascript in step 4 & 5.\n# Using Chrome, open the [Chrome Developer Tools|https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/docs/overview#access], select the console and add the following Javascript to it. Make sure to press enter after adding the Javascript.\n{code:javascript}\nAJS.$(document).ajaxSuccess(function(e, obj) { try{ console.log(JSON.parse(obj.responseText).issueTable.issueKeys.join(',')) } catch(e) {} })\n{code}\n(i) You should see the below appear after entering to confirm the JS went through:\n!Document.png!\n# Reload to filter and the issue keys will be put together in the console as below:\n!Issues.png!\n# Take those issue keys and add them into the JQL query from step 2, put them inside the {{and parent not in ()}} section and change the {{not in subTaskIssueTypes()}} to {{in subTaskIssueTypes()}}. See the below example:\n{noformat}\nproject = \"Sample Scrum Project\" AND type in subTaskIssueTypes() and parent not in (SSP-1,SSP-2,SSP-3,SSP-4,SSP-5,SSP-6,SSP-8,SSP-9,SSP-10,SSP-13,SSP-14,SSP-15,SSP-16,SSP-17,SSP-18,SSP-19,SSP-20,SSP-21,SSP-22,SSP-23) ORDER BY Rank ASC\n{noformat}\n(i) This will search for all parent issues that do not exist within the board.\n# Remove those subtasks from the board.\n\nh5. Using SQL\n\nIn order to find out all the subtasks without their parent, you may use the following queries: \n# Run the following query in the database and get the id of the subtask link: \n{code:sql}\nSELECT * \nFROM   issuelinktype \nWHERE  linkname LIKE '%subtask%'; \n{code}\n# After this run the following query in the database, substituting the value for 'Link Type Id' by the id derived from the above SQL:\n*Before JIRA 6.1:*\n{code:sql}\nSELECT ji2.pkey AS \"parent issue key\", \n       ji1.pkey AS \"child issue key\" \nFROM   issuelink il \n       JOIN jiraissue ji1 \n         ON ji1.id = il.destination \n       JOIN jiraissue ji2 \n         ON ji2.id = il.source \nWHERE  il.linktype = <Link Type Id>;\n{code}\n*After JIRA 6.1:*\n{code:sql}\nSELECT p.pkey AS \"parent project key\",\n    ji2.issuenum AS \"parent issue num\",\n    q.pkey AS \"child project key\", \n       ji1.issuenum AS \"child issue num\" \nFROM   issuelink il \n       JOIN jiraissue ji1 \n         ON ji1.id = il.destination \n       JOIN jiraissue ji2 \n         ON ji2.id = il.source \n       JOIN project p\n        ON ji1.project = p.id\n       JOIN project q\n        ON ji2.project = q.id \nWHERE  il.linktype = <Link Type Id>;\n{code}\n\n(i) This query will list all the sub task type of issues with their parents. You can now compare the subtasks from your filter query and verify if their parents are present on the board by looking up their parent id from the query results.",

[See the corresponding bug report|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSWCLOUD-6414].\n  {panel}\n\nBasically, it does not respect the subtasks of the same parent available in JIRA, but *only* looking of the subtask with the same parent issue on the board. If you have different *Boards* with one parent issue and many subtasks in other boards, moving one of those sub-tasks to the *Done* column will enforce the parent issue to be *Resolved* even though not all *Sub-Takses* are done. \r\n\r\nh3. Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n# Create project and board project_A and board_A\r\n# Create board_B that show project_A\r\n# Create board_C that show project_A\r\n# Create one task with two sub tasks it project_A\r\n# Set filters in board_B and board_C so each one of them will show one sub task\r\n# In one of the board_B or board_C move the sub task to done\r\n# A popup message will appear saying *All sub-tasks for parent issue XXXXX-1 are now Done*. Even only *one* sub-task is done and the others not yet.\r\n\r\nThis is also reproducible when a user divide a Board into two for the same project and workflow. Example, create a Developer Board and QA board where the Resolved/Closed JIRA status is available only in QA board. It will still prompt to closed the parent issue even if the parent issue is NOT in the same board.",
