The Project is really my project portfolio, and each task represents a potential project that could impact one or more of our systems. I have one board that I want to use with the stakeholders to establish the overall priority of the initiatives. The card format is very useful for visualizing everything in the portfolio and allowing us to reorder priorties on the fly. (I have two basic columns for this -- \"Unprioritized\" and \"Prioritized.\")\nI have another board I want to use to track the progress of the requirements definition. I have two statuses defined in my custom workflow - \"Prioritized\" and \"Defining.\" What I'd love to be able to do is display all the initiatives in priority (RANK) order and drag the cards between \"Prioritized\" and \"Defining,\" but not allow the rank assigned to the card on the planning board (whose column \"Prioritized\" contains both statuses, \"Prioritized\" and \"Defining\") to be modified on this screen. When I remove the \"Order by\" clause in the filter it disables the RANK feature, but it also displays the cards in random order, making it difficult for the team to quickly see what should be their next priority for their requirements process.

If a developer wants to view/show other \"in progress\" (or resolved) stories they are working on, they are forced to pull the story into the Sprint, which can adversely affect the Sprint burndown report (adding the story causes the \"remaining values\" to spike up for non-closed issues).\n\nIt would be nice if we had some type of filter/toggle in Work view to enable displaying these stories on the board (we don't really care about the \"to do\" items, mainly the \"in progress\" and \"resolved\" ones).\n\nAlternatively (if this was easier to implement), perhaps the Work view could be changed to allow the Sprint \"selector\" to change to a future sprint and/or the backlog so we could view in progress stories in that manner. (Currently it has an arrow that seems to indicate that it would display a selector, but this only shows us the sprint start/end dates and the \"Complete sprint\" button)\n\n(This may be somewhat related to GHS-9723)\n\nHopefully I explained this clearly enough, if not please let me know if I can clarify what we're looking for.\n",

We also often have tickets that roll over to the next sprint. \n\nCurrently when you close a sprint, any unresolved tickets are supposed to return to the top of the backlog. However, there's a bug in JIRA where the ticket is not returned to the _top of the backlog_ but instead is sent to the _first open, unstarted sprint_. The result is that, when closing sprints, we often add tickets to the wrong sprint and have to hunt for the tickets and remove them manually from those sprints.
