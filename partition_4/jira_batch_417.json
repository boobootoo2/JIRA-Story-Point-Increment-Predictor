      "description": "Hi all,\n\nI am currently working with GreenHopper within JIRA Studio (2.3).\nI am working in a software company and we make software engineering and requirements engineering both with JIRA Studio.\nWe have one single JIRA Project for both kinds of work.\nThe developers work on the issue types Bug, New Feature, Development Task, Improvement and the requirements engineers work on the issue type Requirement.\nBoth roles have different workflows.\nNow due to the fact that both work on the same JIRA project there are some shortcomings when working with greenhopper.\nIt is not possible to easily switch between both modes (development and requirements).\nCurrently we solve the situation the following:\nThe Greenhopper Template contains all workflow steps (from both disciplines). The developers hide all steps that are for the requirements engineers and the requriements engineers hide all steps that are for the developers.\nFurther we created two contexts \"Development\" and \"Requirements\" that only show the issues types that belong to the users role.\nSo the problems are the following:\n* The hiding of the \"not needed\" fields must be done manually by each user\n* A user that has work to do in both roles (e.g. development lead of the project) has no chance to switch unless he/she adds the hidden fields again.\n* It is not possible to provide such settings globally. It must be configured per project per user\n\nWhat I suggest:\nA new setting maybe called \"view\" that allows the greenhopper admin to define multiple views on workflow basis. I imaging that I can set a template per workflow and in Greenhopper I can then choose what role I have and then I see my templates and my issues. People that have multiple roles can easily switch between those.\n\nI hope you find this meaningful.\n\nRegards,\nFlorian",

      "description": "Currently when ranking is enabled, if you create a new card on the Planning Board with a card selected, the newly-created card is inserted above the select card. On the Task Board this doesn't occur, however, (it shows at the bottom of the To Do list) and it's not really immediately obvious as to _why_.\n\nA customer raised this as a support issue, and gave a very well thought-out response as to why at least the option to put newly-created cards above the selected card (or at the very top of the list) should exist:\n\n{quote}\nThe scenario that our Scrum master is interested in is pretty constrained. Being able to add new bugs during a sprint is part of Scrum. Having them added to to top of the sprint backlog is how it's typically done (not just at our company \u2014 it's a common practice). I don't think that items need to be inserted directly into either the In Progress or Done columns. I don't think that sorting needs to be supported in the To Do column. Based on the scenario and Scrum practice, the only change needed is the ability to add a Bug to the top of the list (by selecting the top existing item in the list).\n\nFurther, Rank, which is a custom field, is kept invisible to the user. All the user is interested in is order of issues \u2014 the rank field is a way of supporting a sortable list, and the the specific values that it contains aren't of interest. That is, if four issues are given ranks values or 1, 2, 3, and 4, they will sort in the same order if they are instead given values of 2, 17, 22, and 48. The value doesn't matter.\n\nThe task view is showing the same issues as the planning view (for a given version, for example), but divided into three columns based on status. Does the rank value currently remain unchanged when issues are moved across the three columns? Or is it changing to reflect which items are moved across the columns first? (I actually have no idea, but it doesn't look like it's changing to me.)\n\nIf the rank value doesn't change when moving across columns (and this is a big \"if\"), then the rank value will preserve the list order regardless of which column an issue is in. That is, when a new issue is inserted at the top of the to do list, the rank values could be updated behind the scenes exactly as they are when a new issue is inserted at the top of the planning board list. The fact that I can insert a new issue at the top of the planning board list, switch to task board, and see the newly added item at the top of the To Do list suggests that this would be technically possible. That is, it appears that rank applies to all of the issues in a given version and is used to preserve the order. (FWIW, this suggests to me that the answer to your question is that yes, the rank of the cards in the other column should potentially change, but this is invisible to the user as it is done in a way that preserves the order of items in the list. As well, dragging the bug over to the In Progress column should behave the same way it would if it were a previously existing issue, or if it were one newly added in the Planning Board.)\n{quote}",

Sometimes it is positioned before the drop target, sometimes behind it. It does not seem to matter whether I drop onto the left or the right side of the card. It may depend on whether I'm dragging from one row to another or within a row. Trying to drop into the space between cards does nothing at all.\n\nI'd make a few suggestions:\n\n* Drop zones should be consistent. I would recommend dividing the card in two and looking at where the mouse pointer is when dropping. If it's on the left half of the card, drop before. If it's on the right half of the card, drop after.\n* The space between cards should be a valid drop zone.\n* Rather than highlighting the card that the mouse is over, I would add an indicator to the space between cards where the dropped issue will appear.\n* When hovering over an invalid drop zone, change the indicator to show that the card will return to the original location. Maybe change the mouse cursor style to {{no-drop}} as well (see http://www.quirksmode.org/css/cursor.html).",

This is incredible odd to see in an engineering tool.\n    * The average makes a lot of sense as a velocity if averaged over versions (aka sprints) that have been released (aka completed). Your documentation notes that the value chart view is a good way to understand velocity. Averaging over sprints that haven't started yet doesn't make any sense. Can you help me understand why this might be useful, if there is a use?\n\nSo please either add the significant amount of digits without rounding or round and remove the \".0\".

The user would rearrange issues, JIRA Client calculates numeric values for the order, and then tries to upload them to the server (either via SOAP RPC, or through Edit Issue HTML forms).\n\nThis used to work with Greenhopper's Ranking field very nicely. As of version 5.1, 5.2 (probably 5.0 too), it stopped working. If I upload a new Ranking value, it is ignored.\n\nAs much as I could gather, you have changed the semantics of the new uploaded value. It used to be exactly the value of the field, as with other normal fields. Now it seems to be exactly the ranking value of another issue, which is desired to follow the one being changed. (Please confirm - is that correct?)\n\nIf I may suggest a way to fix this, could you please:\n1. Accept any numeric value X for ranking\n2. If X matches the ranking value of any issue, act exactly as you do now\n3. Otherwise, find the issue that has minimal ranking that is greater than X, and use it as the base issue similar to case 2.\n\nIn other words, instead of using \"Issue[Rank=X]\", use \"Issue[min(Rank>=X)]\" as the base issue for the change.\n\nThat way, the functionality would be more robust and compatible. (I understand the final value may be different from the uploaded one, but I think remote clients can cope with that. Also, you could take the exact uploaded value as a \"hint\" for the new value of the ranking field.)\n \nThanks!\nIgor",

      "description": "We are presently collecting feedback on our spike of multiple project support within GreenHopper. Current information can be found on GHS-1800. \n\n*This is a _spike_ that was developed with no formal structure or testing. We are trying to get an idea of what GreenHopper will look like with multiple projects. There will be bugs. We will throw all of this code away and we may not ever support multiple projects, there are no guarantees.*\n\nYou can create an account on the [customer sandbox|http://greenhopper.onjira.com/] and play around with the functionality. Some points to note are outlines below:\n\n*Current Functionality restrictions*\n* Individual projects can no longer be selected.\n* The page title and project icon will not reflect the selected project.\n* Shared versions will only appear if the all projects selected match the all projects the shared version exists in exactly.\n* Within a selection of projects, only the Issue Type Scheme and Permission Scheme can be different.\n* Existing versions with the same name will not be linked in Greenhopper, only shared versions created through GreenHopper will be linked.\n* Selecting the scrum project template will no longer change the issue type scheme in the selected projects but will still change the other settings.\n* 'On the fly' can no longer be selected as a context.\n\n*Tips*\n* To choose which projects to select, create a new context or manage/edit an existing one.\n* Creating a version in GreenHopper will create a shared version across all of the selected projects.\n* Ranking is now global, so changes in rank will affect all contexts. That means that every issue in JIRA has a relative rank to every other issue.\n* All schemes, except for issue type and permission schemes, should be the same across all projects that are selected.\n* Deleting or releasing versions that are part of a shared version through JIRA (ie, not through the GreenHopper interface) will is strongly discouraged. It will likely not work.\n* Configurations selected through Tools>Configuration will now configure based on the selected context instead of project.",

Additional Sprint work takes place in the \"Sprint\" version. If additional subtasks for one of the planned issues are created either within a Greenhopper version board focusing on the Sprint version or from within a Jira screen explicitly specifying the \"Sprint\" fix version, then the subtask is created as desired, with the \"Release Goal\", \"Release Commitment\" and \"Sprint\" versions, but without the archived \"Sprint Plan\" version. \n\nIn fact, because the \"Sprint Plan\" version has been archived, it cannot be assigned to a new subtask through conventional means. \n\nHowever, if the subtask is created through the Jira interface and a version is not assigned at creation time, every fixVersion from the parent is duplicated in the subtask. The workaround for a subtask in this condition is laborious as it involves unarchiving the version, editing the subtask to remove the version which the listener added in error and rearchiving the version.\n\nNote that all that is necessary for this to take place is to have Greenhopper installed on the system. It will occur even if the project is not associated with Greenhopper and if all of the configurable listeners are disabled. I conclude from this that the process which is setting these versions is a core listener associated with Greenhopper.",
