They do not commit to a sprint backlog, and they do not commit to a number of issues or total story points/hours to complete. The velocity chart uses terms which forward the anti-pattern of treating velocity like a \"stick\" with which to punish teams when it is not achieved. The term \"committed\" also leads stakeholders to negative perceptions of teams who successfully meet a sprint goal and do not finish all the work in sprint backlog. These effects combine to incentivize teams to under-plan based upon their capacity (so they always finish \"committed\"), and/or to discover elaborate Jira work-arounds to alter sprint scope for reporting.\r\n\r\nFor further information, I respectfully recommend the product owner for this chart review guidance from the authors of Scrum on scrum.org",
