Problem Definition\n\nWithin JIRA, the current Development Panel will only list the number of Crucible reviews related to that issue in a single state (Open or Closed, etc).\u00a0\u00a0 However this will not give you the total number of reviews related to that issue directly on the page itself.\u00a0 For example\n\n1. 2 open reviews -> OK\n 2. 2 closed reviews - > OK\n 3. 1 open review and 1 closed review -> Only lists the 1 open review\n\nGranted when you click on that link the popup window will show you all the review and their states correctly.\u00a0 The problem is that the the development panel within JIRA is limiting what information it provides here.\nh3. Suggested Solution\n\nIt would be helpful if you could see the total number of reviews, and all the states/status of them without having to click on the review link.\nh3. Why this is important\n\nA related bug, -JSW-13607-, touched on this behavior, but was ultimately closed as 'cannot reproduce'.\u00a0\u00a0 However from reading a comment from Matthew Watson, it makes it seem like this particular aspect (the total issues listed in the panel) is by design:\n{quote}Also note that the count on the development panel is not the total count, it is only the count of reviews/pull-requests/builds that are in a given state (open/merged/failing/ etc.)\n{quote}\nQuoted comment from -JSW-13607-\n\n\u00a0\n\n!developmentpanel1.png|thumbnail!",

Problem Definition:\nIf a board's filter query is changed so that it shows issues from a different project, and that new project's workflow does not contain the statuses set up in the board configuration, they will not be usable. This is a problem for any user who wants to set up a board ONCE, and copy it to use it for other projects without having to do much extra work.\n\nh3. Suggestion Solutions:\n1. When a board has statuses that do not belong to the project it is showing issues from, provide a button along the lines of \"Add these statuses to the project [Project Name]\" to quickly add all missing statuses to that project's workflow. The user can already do this one status at a time with the \"Add Status\" button, so this new button would simply automate that process.\n\n2. When a board has statuses that do not belong to the project it is showing issues from, provide a button on each status that does not belong (And therefore has a yellow exclamation mark symbol) which lets the user quickly add that status to the project it is missing from.\n\n3. Allow the user to assign a different workflow to a board, WITHOUT turning off the \"Simplified Workflow\" features. This way the user can set up ONE workflow, point all of their boards at it, and they'll all have the same statuses available, but they can also carry on adding statuses/columns simply. This will, of course, add those same statuses to all the linked boards, so a warning will need to be shown to this effect.",

While the bubble is present, you cannot click on the confirm check button (also where it overlaps with the cancel check button, the same thing will happen there). Moving the mouse will cause this to rapidly flash in and out of the screen, interfering with the user's ability to click either of these boxes.\n\nBetter visualized:\n [^Story_Points.mp4] \n\nh3.

Click the Estimate to try to edit the value inside\n3. Note the Story Points bubble popping up\n\nh3. Expected Results\n\nThe bubble should not be showing when trying to click the button.

Please see Anton's very detailed answer regarding this:\n\n\u00a0\n\nFirst of all, all calculation happens on client side, in JavaScript.\nHere is a function:\n\n{noformat}\nReleaseDatePredictor.getCompletedEstimatePerDay = function (completedEstimateDataPoints, startTime, endTime, seriesDataPoints) \\{\n var completedData = [];\n var currentEstimateCompleted = 0;\n var currentIndex = 0;\n var issuesCounted = [];\n var workingDays = 0;\n\nfunction addToIssuesCounted(issue) \\{\n // keep track of burned down issues\n var changeEvent = ChangeEvent.getChangeEvent(issue);\n if (changeEvent == ChangeEvent.burndown || changeEvent == ChangeEvent.completeScopeAdded) \\{\n issuesCounted.push(issue.key);\n }\n }\n\nfunction removeEstimateAlreadyCounted(currentComplete, issue) \\{\n // if we already counted this issue in the burndown\n if (_.contains(issuesCounted, issue.key)) \\{\n // if it's now being re-added to scope, don't count it again\n var changeEvent = ChangeEvent.getChangeEvent(issue);\n if (changeEvent === ChangeEvent.completeScopeAdded || changeEvent === ChangeEvent.scopeAdded) \\{\n return currentComplete - issue.completedEstimate;\n }\n }\n\nreturn currentComplete;\n }\n\n// for each day since the start of the chart, check for estimate completed\n for (var i = startTime; i <= endTime; i += ChartUtils.oneDayInMillis) \\{\n // ignore non-working days\n if (!BurndownRate.isDateInNonWorkingBlock(i)) \\{\n workingDays++;\n }\n\nvar completedToday = 0;\n var issuesChanged;\n // check the next data point in the series\n for (var j = currentIndex; j < completedEstimateDataPoints.length; j++) \\{\n var dateOfChange = completedEstimateDataPoints[j][0];\n\n// if this occurred in the last day, add it\n if (dateOfChange <= i) \\{\n // if we didn't already pass the start time, don't add the points\n if (dateOfChange > startTime) \\{\n var estimate = completedEstimateDataPoints[j][1];\n\n// track the burned down issues we count and reduce estimate for those we've already counted e.g. re-added scope\n issuesChanged = (seriesDataPoints[j]) ? seriesDataPoints[j].issues : [];\n if (issuesChanged) \\{\n estimate = _.reduce(issuesChanged, removeEstimateAlreadyCounted, estimate);\n _.each(issuesChanged, addToIssuesCounted);\n }\n\nif (estimate > currentEstimateCompleted) \\{\n // Add the difference between the last change and the current value\n completedToday += (estimate - currentEstimateCompleted);\n }\n // Reset the current value to compare for next time\n currentEstimateCompleted = completedEstimateDataPoints[j][1];\n } else \\{\n // still want to add to the issues we've counted so we don't count it again\n issuesChanged = (seriesDataPoints[j]) ? seriesDataPoints[j].issues : [];\n if (issuesChanged) \\{\n _.each(issuesChanged, addToIssuesCounted);\n }\n // also need to reset the current estimate completed\n currentEstimateCompleted = completedEstimateDataPoints[j][1];\n }\n } else \\{\n // Passed today, reset index for next loop\n currentEstimateCompleted = completedEstimateDataPoints[j][1];\n currentIndex = j;\n break;\n }\n }\n\ncompletedData.push(\n \\{\n time: i,\n estimate: completedToday\n }\n );\n\n}\n return \\{\n completedData: completedData,\n workingDays: workingDays\n };\n };\n{noformat}\n\nThis function is responsible for evaluation of how much of estimate is done per period from the start day of the version, up to now. In order to do so, it receives list of completed estimates with timestamps when they was completed, start time, end time and list of issues completed in specified period.\n\nFor some reason, \"end time\" is in future. 24 hours in future. I tried to changed it to simple \"now\" value, but then everything falls apart.\nAlso for some reason for one completed estimate this method receives list of 3 estimates.\nFirst estimate equals zero. Second estimate is the real estimate and the third one is fake estimate, just a copy of second estimate (please, somebody, shoot me).\n\nAnyhow, the algorithm works in that way that it adds completed estimate only for previous days, not for \"today\". But it counts working days for every day it iterates.\n\nLooking at at the picture:\n[^image_2016-12-01_18-21-14.png]\nJIRA Agile starts with \"start\" date, which is midnight of current day, today is working day, so it increases number of working days. Working Days = 1. \nNext, it takes first completed estimate from the list, checks if it happened \"last day\", it this case it is didn't, so it skips it (but that doesn't matter because first completed estimate is zero anyway).\nNow, JIRA Agile goes further through time (not through space, though >_<), by adding 24 hours to \"start\" value. Next, JIRA increases number of working days by 1. So there is 2 working days already.\nAfter that, JIRA takes a completed estimate from list of completed estimates, and thinks that it happened \"yesterday\", so it adds amount of completed estimate to \"Total Amount Of Completed Estimate\". It is still zero though. But we have 3 completed estimates in the list. So JIRA just takes next completed estimate and adds it to Total Completed Estimate. This time it was 1d (8 hours), so Total Completed Estimate = 1 day. Now it takes 3d and last completed estimate. It compares it with completed issues in \"seriesDataPoints\" list and understands that we've already added this estimate, because it the same estimate as estimate 2 in this list (really, somebody, shoot me already), so it skips it.\nOk, next cycle, next day, JIRA adds 24 more hours to \"start\" value and understands that it bigger than \"end\" value, so it considers that everything is done.\n\nSo, we have that JIRA thinks that there are *2* working days and there is only *1* day of completed estimate. This leads to predicted velocity of *4* hours a day instead of *8* hours a day and makes predicted completion day 2 times further in future that it is in reality.\n\n\u00a0",

In order to mitigate this issue we implemented the following board filter which works great in clearing out the Board from issues which were released:\n{code:java}\nproject in (<redacted>) AND (status != Done AND (fixVersion is EMPTY OR fixVersion != \"Unreleasable Work\")) OR (status = Done and fixVersion in unreleasedVersions() and fixVersion != \"Unreleasable Work\") ORDER BY Rank ASC, STATUS ASC\n\n{code}\nHowever, after we implemented this filter, I noticed that the Control Chart gets wiped with every release. I am assuming this is because the Control Chart uses the current state of the board filter and not keeping track of the boards history. Would it be possible to start storing the Control Chart data in a way which would take historical states into consideration?\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nAlternatively, is there an alternative way for me to hide tickets from appearing in the Done column indefinitely and keep the Control Chart in-tact?\n\n\u00a0\n\nThanks in advance for your response!",

Jira searches for IN-12345 (IN being the last project browsed).\n\nh3. Suggested Solution\nThe customer would want to have both, search for the issue key as well as for the text in the custom field\n \nh3.
