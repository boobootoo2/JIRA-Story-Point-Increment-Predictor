This  makes for a cleaner and more readable history, and avoids the usability problems above.\n\nCan the branch closing feature for Mercurial repositories be changed to work this way?\n\n(Alternatively, if there are users who for some reason insist on the current close-after-merge behavior, can both options be supported?)",
