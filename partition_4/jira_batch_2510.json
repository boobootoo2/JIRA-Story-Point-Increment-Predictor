      "description": "* look into trying  a sample rate of 16khz and sample bitsize of 16.\n* make a methode for the buffer sizes so they reflect the audio format config.\\\\\nfollowing taking from stack overflow\n\n\"To see why, you must simply notice that the function in question takes a byte array as an argument and processes each value from that array individually. The byte datatype is an 8-bit value. If you want something that works with 16-bit values, you need to use a different datatype (short) or convert to that from bytes.\n\nOnce you do that, you will still get different values for 16 bits vs 8 bit because the range is different: 8 bit goes from -128 to +127 and 16 bit goes from -32768 to +32767, but they are both measuring the same thing, meaning they scaling the same real-word values to different represented values.\n\nAs for sound-levels and their relationship to time.... well it depends on your sample rate and the size of the arrays going into this function. For example, if your samplerate is 8kHz and you have 2048 samples per buffer, then your function is going to be called 8000/2048 or about 3.9 times per second, meaning your results are coming in at that rate (every 256 milliseconds).\"",

From the beginning, commits and image assets was generated from Mac and Linux. Some team member is using Windows, and the trouble began when they try to do commit and push.\n\nEach time we push commit to Bitbucket with image asset created from GIMP in Windows, each image become corrupted. You can see the attachment below.\n\nAnd then we tried to clone it again to try and see whether the corrupted images is carried out. Unfortunately, all our images is now corrupted.\n\nAdditional info, we are using Vagrant with VIrtualBox for devops. The OS is using Ubuntu in Windows 8 host.\n\nOur repository folder is synced to it, that&#x27;s why we can do commit from Windows.\n\nThis problem also arise when we checkout to other branch in Windows.\n\nIn my opinion, this is related to LF and CRLF line endings.

Most modern browsers seem to keep form state if one goes back then immediately forwards again, but the JS that \"Cancel\" fires irrecoverably destroys the information, mildly amusing for a VCS hosting provider.\n\nLooking at another site, StackOverflow, there are a couple major differences that I feel make for far superior UX:\n\n# You are warned about potentially destructive actions (going to another post, closing the window, hitting back, etc), and also:\n# *There is no \"cancel\".* Web forms are not modal, you do not need to \"abort\" entering data in order to go do another task instead. [I&#x27;ll let the Nielsen Norman group, a UX research firm explain it|http://www.nngroup.com/articles/reset-and-cancel-buttons/].\n\n#* What you call \"Cancel\", Nielsen calls \"Reset\", a much more destructive thing:\n\nbq. * The worst problem about Reset is that users click the button by mistake when they wanted to click Submit . Bang \u2014 all your work is gone!\n* Having two buttons at the bottom of a form clutters up the interface and makes it harder for users to clearly see their next step. Some small amount of wasted time is spent scanning the useless button and deciding which of the two buttons is the correct one.",

This forces us to deny all pull requests in Bitbucket in order to close them.\n\nPlease update the pull request interface to either recognize squashed merges or allow the user to force the pull request into a \"MERGED\" status.\n\nThanks.",
