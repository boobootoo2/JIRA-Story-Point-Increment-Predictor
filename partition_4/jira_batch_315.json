I trust you can use the content, not just to dismiss our quaint ways of working ;-), but also for improving the product going forward.\n\nIf you have any questions, please comment on this ticket.\n\nIn any case, I'll be attending the Summit next November, should the need arise for us to have further interaction.\n\nCheers,\n\nLasse",

As such the target for each theme is set to 50% each.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the estimate shows that ~91% of focus will be spent on Grapes theme, ~9% of focus will be spent on Pineapples as the report blindly adds Story points and treats them all as equal when they are not (and never should be considered in that way!)\r\n\r\nWhat we need is to take into account both the estimates on the Epics/Stories/Tasks and the team velocity, in order to be able to compare apples to apples and look at the focus (themes) across the whole projects.",

This basically means that the blocked issue virtually gets \"ranked\" below the blocking issue (unless the rank order already matches the dependency order, i.e., the blocked issue has a lower rank than the blocking one). In certain situations (like two teams working on de facto independent backlogs) this behaviour leads to unintuitive / unexpected outcomes.\n\n*Solution*\nIn order to allow scheduling to better adjust to the particular setup, an option to change this behaviour should be introduced. I want to be able to \"pull up\" blocking issues above my blocked issue to keep it from being scheduled later. Alternatively I would like scheduling to ignore dependencies and just have them visualized.",

Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n# Create one project and add 2500 issues to it\r\n# Create a new Portfolio plan and select this project as an issue source \r\n# In the plan's configuration, when accessing the screen \"Confirm what's in scope\", try to expand an Epic view or the \"Issues without parent Epic\" panel\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nAll issues below Epic are displayed\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nThe message \"The next level of the hierarchy is currently disabled. There are too many issues to load them all individually. Please use filters to narrow down the data set first\"\r\n\r\n !Screen Shot 2019-08-29 at 9.51.42 PM.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\nh3. Notes\r\n\r\nThis affects only the \"Confirm what's in scope\" view, the plan works.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nCurrently, there is no known workaround for this behavior. A workaround will be added here when available",

Summary\r\n\r\nCurrently the scope table aggregates values from child issues for display, for example if there was an Epic 'epic' with two children configured with:\r\n* Child A - Theme 1\r\n* Child B - Theme 2\r\n\r\nThen on the Epic Theme 1 and Theme 2 would both be shown. The same behaviour will apply for releases and other values in the scope table as well.\r\n\r\nIf one of the children is hidden by a filter then its values will not be aggregated. Taking the above example if Child B was hidden by a filter then the Epic would only show Theme 1.\r\n\r\nThis suggestion would change that behaviour so that aggregate values from child issues are always visible, even if the child issue itself is hidden by a filter.\r\n",
