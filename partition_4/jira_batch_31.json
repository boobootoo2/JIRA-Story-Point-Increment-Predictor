This leads to completely misleading diffs that don't reflect the actual changes that have been made.\r\n\r\nIf I bring up an external Diff of the file it is also against the wrong version, so clearly SourceTree is choosing the incorrect version at a low level somewhere. Stranger still, if I restart SourceTree often it will start showing the diff correctly.... only to then break again as I browse around on other changed files in the File Status UI.\r\n\r\nI had never seen this in any version of SouceTree prior to 2.0.

That's only one reason for these policies.\r\n * One might not want to get the work environment changed during critical phases of the development process. Do you have deadlines? I do.\r\n * Some people prefer to not be the first to use a new version. If you're like me, you tend to run into issues. I switched to 2.x with 2.0.20.1 and even though I really like the speed bump (and no longer having selection issues in the lists), the blurry text (SRCTREEWIN-7085) makes me feel like having motion sickness.

Like 100MB/week? Via EDGE?\u00a0Every network packet counts. Trust me.\r\n * Privacy concerns. (On Mac, I use LittleSnitch to enforce privacy settings.

I propose a better warning system when your working copy has merge conflicts, for the sake of saving engineer's lives (If you have a soul, please help): Crazy red warning that changes background color of working copy display. Maybe additional markers in the UI to represent, \"Hey, something's wrong.\"\r\n\r\nCurrent issue: Merge conflicts only show up as an easily-dismissed dialogue with lots of text, and little markers next to items. Too many times to count, we've had artists/designers pull down the project, have a conflict, have the merge show up as expected (all local and remote modifications, plus conflicts marked with exclamations), and the user simply discards all of the files they didn't change (including all remote modifications in the merge), causing lost work and/or lots of engineer time to bring back the lost content.\r\n\r\nBy just adding a red background and a warning banner in this situation, it would make it incredibly easier to handle these situations on large teams, especially as we're bringing on lots of new users that have little or no git experience. Training helps,\u00a0but these indicators will do wonders.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0",
