      "description": "I populated a repository with files from my Windows 7 partition. These contained danish (aka international) characters. Mercurial turned out to be unfriendly in the way it obtains file names and thus checks in junk names.\n\nIn the bitbucket source browser I noticed that one folder (imported from a folder with the \u00c5 character in it) was empty, even though it actually contained several files locally. After renaming the folder to not contain the character the files inside became visible.\n\nNote that \u00c5 is a particularly troublesome character because it has two UTF-8 encodings (e.g. A-WITH-RING and RINGED-A), both representing the same character. These are known as NFC and NFD encodings. Because my files originated on a Mac, which converts everything it saves to disk to NFD encoding, their current encoding is NFD (Windows uses the encoding it&#x27;s given, which avoids a ton of problems, but I digress).\n\nOn another note, I had serious problems getting the push to work at all. Anything above 30-50MB is lucky to get through, returning either 502 Bad Gateway or 500 Server Error. It took 14 (!!!) pushes to finally send all the repository data across the wire. Is this a bitbucket or Mercurial problem?",

      "description": "Some of the lexers in the Pygments highlighting tool accept options to select a specific dialect of the lexer&#x27;s language. For example, the C lexer accepts an option to highlight either ANSI or C99 stdlib function names, the Pascal lexer to select Delphi, Turbo- or Free-Pascal, the Modula-2 lexer to select PIM, ISO or ObjM2 dialects.\n\nAt present, Bitbucket does not have the capability to supply options to the Pygments lexers. However, it would be nice to add such a facility to Bitbucket. The following is a proposal how this could be achieved without having to make any changes to Bitbucket&#x27;s user interface:\n\nLexer options would be supported through one or more user supplied files that would reside in the user&#x27;s repository along with the source files. The filename(s) would ideally reflect the purpose. A leading dot or underscore might be used to make it more transparent that the file(s) do(es) not actually belong to the software in the repo.\n\nSince a repo may contain files of different languages, there would need to be a way to store options for multiple lexers. There are two ways to do this:\n\n# one file per repo, file containing a list of mappings\n# one file per mapping, file ending or mimetype in the file name\n\nApproach no.1 may need a little more effort to parse the file contents, but it is much cleaner because everything is in one place. The following describes this approach ...\n\nThere are two ways to map, either by mimetype or by file-ending.\n\nAlternative A, mapping by mimetype:\n\nEBNF\n\nfile : entry* eof ;\n\nentry : mapping newline ;\n\nmapping : mimetype ( &#x27;:&#x27; option )+ ;\n\nmimetype : &#x27;x-&#x27; identifier ;\n\noption : identifier ;\n\nidentifier : ( &#x27;a&#x27;..&#x27;z&#x27; | &#x27;A&#x27;..&#x27;Z&#x27; | &#x27;_&#x27; ) ( &#x27;a&#x27;..&#x27;z&#x27; | &#x27;A&#x27;..&#x27;Z&#x27; | &#x27;0&#x27;..&#x27;9&#x27; | &#x27;_&#x27; )*\n\nnewline : &#x27;\\n&#x27; ;\n\neof : <end of file> ;\n\nEXAMPLE\n\nFilename: .SYNTAXCOLOR.OPTIONS\n\nContents:\n\nx-csrc:stdlibhighlighting:c99highlighting\n\nx-pascal:delphi:units\n\nx-modula2:iso:gm2ext\n\nAlternative B, mapping by file-ending:\n\nEBNF\n\nfile : entry* eof ;\n\nentry : mapping newline ;\n\nmapping : filetype ( &#x27;,&#x27; filetype )* ( &#x27;:&#x27; option )+ ;\n\nfiletype : &#x27;.&#x27; identifier ;\n\noption : identifier ;\n\nidentifier : ( &#x27;a&#x27;..&#x27;z&#x27; | &#x27;A&#x27;..&#x27;Z&#x27; | &#x27;_&#x27; ) ( &#x27;a&#x27;..&#x27;z&#x27; | &#x27;A&#x27;..&#x27;Z&#x27; | &#x27;0&#x27;..&#x27;9&#x27; | &#x27;_&#x27; )*\n\nnewline : &#x27;\\n&#x27; ;\n\neof : <end of file> ;\n\nEXAMPLE\n\nFilename: .SYNTAXCOLOR.OPTIONS\n\nContents:\n\n.c,.h:stdlibhighlighting:c99highlighting\n\n.pas:delphi:units\n\n.def,.mod:iso:gm2ext\n\nNote, only one of these alternatives is needed. Perhaps mapping by mimetype is the best way to do this.\n\nhope this helps",
