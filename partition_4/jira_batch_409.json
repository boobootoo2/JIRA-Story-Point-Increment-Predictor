This does not make much sense for us, as the JIRA/GreenHopper administration is not done by the Scrum team themselves, but they need to be able to manage their sprints on their own.\n\nTherefore, we need to specify which users/groups/project roles are allowed to start a sprint independently from the \"Administer Projects\" permission.\nTo be honest, the reliance of GreenHopper on JIRA permission feels often inadequate and I hope that you find a way to manage GreenHopper permissions independently (this relates to GHS-1787, GHS-3928).\nAs long as this is not possible, maybe there is a way to at least separate starting a sprint from the \"Administer Projects\" permission? E.g. by adding a \"Manage Projects\" permission in JIRA that allows some of the things included in the \"Administer Projects\" permission?",

      "description": "In an open source software company, it's often the case that some company-confidential discussion of business strategy takes place in a \"product management\" issue, and then actual implementation of a feature/story/use case takes place in linked public issues.  It would be nice to allow someone to rank the private issues, and be able to specify that issues related by a particular link type should receive the same rank.  \n\nThere a multiple advantages to these issues being links rather than subtasks:\n\n1) public and private issues can be managed together\n2) issues in multiple projects can be managed together\n3) there could be multi-level hierarchy (though I'm much less concerned about this)\n4) there does not have to be an issue type differentiation between a Feature that is also a subtask of a Story and one that is not.\n\nCurrently I'm working around this by using the REST APIs of Jira and Greenhopper to scan for links and rerank linked issues, but it feels like a hack.\n\nMy blog about it is here: \nhttp://agrimmsreality.blogspot.com/2012/04/greenhopper-jira-and-rest.html",

When releasing sprint1, the 2nd one is moved to sprint 2. Story 2 is completed in Sprint 2. Velocity graph will count Story 2 in both Sprint 1 and Sprint 2\n\nFor that:\n- create a version hierarchy with\n- 1 parent version : Release 1\n- 2 child versions : Sprint 1, Sprint 2\n- Create 2 stories and assign them to Sprint 1:\n- Story1 estimated with 5 Story Points\n- Story2 estimated with 8 Story Points\n- Resolve Story 1\n- Release Sprint 1. GreenHopper will propose you to move story 2 in another version. Select Sprint 2\n- Resolve Story 2\n- Display the velocity graph : go to the chart board, select version \"Release 1\", Value chart, Story points by children.\n- you would expect: 5 points done (Story 1) in Sprint 1, 8 points done (Story 2) in Sprint 2.\n- you will see : 13 points done (Story 1 + Story 2) in Sprint 1, 8 points done (Story 2) in sprint 2\n\n\nthanks to help.\n\nRegards,\nRuchi",

      "description": "As a Rapid Board user I would like to be able to see sub-tasks of top level issue types if they are not included in the filter my rapid board is based on.\n\nThe main problem being addressed here is that it is not possible to have a filter which includes user stories, but not their tasks and still have the tasks shown on the rapid board.\nA actual example of when this is required is the following. A company has X number of development teams that each have a rapid board. Each user story has a 'team' field which is tagged with the team currently working on the user story. The filter the rapid board is based could look something like 'team = \"teamname\"'. This filter would result in X amount of user stories being listed. With the current solution it isn't possible to list the subtasks of those user stories.\n\nWith the planning board this was not an issue as it would filter on fixVersion, which would include the subtasks. \n\nA workaround for this would be to simply tag the subtasks with the same team as the parent. While this is entirely possible, the hierarchy would break as soon as the team is changed on the parent.\n\nAlternatively the JQL could be more advanced and support queries such as \"issuetype = Task AND parent.team='teamname'\"",
