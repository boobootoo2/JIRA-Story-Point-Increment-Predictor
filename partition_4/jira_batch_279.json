Since the JIRA \"Projects\" pulldown already allows project selection, do we really need a second GreenHopper based project selector right underneath? Is it required to dis-ambiguate navigation - user wants to see project page vs GreenHopper planning board for project?\r\n",

Additional Sprint work takes place in the \"Sprint\" version. If additional subtasks for one of the planned issues are created either within a Greenhopper version board focusing on the Sprint version or from within a Jira screen explicitly specifying the \"Sprint\" fix version, then the subtask is created as desired, with the \"Release Goal\", \"Release Commitment\" and \"Sprint\" versions, but without the archived \"Sprint Plan\" version. \r\n\r\nIn fact, because the \"Sprint Plan\" version has been archived, it cannot be assigned to a new subtask through conventional means. \r\n\r\nHowever, if the subtask is created through the Jira interface and a version is not assigned at creation time, every fixVersion from the parent is duplicated in the subtask. The workaround for a subtask in this condition is laborious as it involves unarchiving the version, editing the subtask to remove the version which the listener added in error and rearchiving the version.\r\n\r\nNote that all that is necessary for this to take place is to have Greenhopper installed on the system. It will occur even if the project is not associated with Greenhopper and if all of the configurable listeners are disabled. I conclude from this that the process which is setting these versions is a core listener associated with Greenhopper.",

For example, we may have a Project Management component, with tasks for Daily Scrum, Scheduling, Client meetings, etc. We generally don't chop these up by iteration and put them on the task board. So to find them, one must switch to the planning board, view by component, then find the bucket you want.\r\n\r\nIt would be great if we could have a way to quickly access project-wide tasks, mainly for rapid time entry. Maybe the forums concept of a \"pinned\" post, where the issue always appears in certain views, or the concept of a \"dock\" that could be loaded with issues. Simpler would be a project-wide dock, more complex would be user-specific ones.\r\n\r\nBAsically the user story is \"as a project team member I want to be able to easily log time against any of a number of project-wide tasks.\"\r\n\r\nPerhaps this can be accomplished using out of the box features and I just haven't been creative enough yet ...",
