Workaround\r\n\r\nIn the example above the regular JIRA mail handler is being used.

      "description": "{panel:bgColor=#e7f4fa}\n  *NOTE:* This bug report is for *JIRA Service Desk Server*. Using *JIRA Service Desk Cloud*? [See the corresponding bug report|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSDCLOUD-2373].\n  {panel}\n\nh3. Summary\r\n\r\nWhen a customer of a JIRA Service Desk sends an E-mail from Service Desk to another person (who is not an agent, reporter or request participant) of the issue, if that additional party replies to the issue and includes the JIRA Service Desk E-mail, the E-mail is treated as a new issue, even though:\r\n- Subject Line contains the Issue Key, \r\n- Email Headers are still intact. \r\n\r\nFor Example: \r\n# Customer 1 raises a Service Desk request.\r\n# Agent 1 responds to the Service Desk Request.\r\n# Customer 1 receives a response and CC's the response to another Customer (Customer 2).\r\n# Customer 2 responds to the service desk request, CCing in the same people.\r\n\r\nCreating new E-mails under this scenario causes additional overhead for the Service Desk Administrator, and may be confusing to the customer interacting with the Agent, due to the fragmented nature of the E-mail interactions \r\n\r\nThis was introduced as a result of the changes in: [JSD-1876|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSD-1876] which fixed an issue when a user who was not a Service Desk customer responded to a Service Desk Email.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Set up a new Service Desk\r\n# Create an Issue and Send a Comment to a customer as an Agent\r\n# As a customer forward the issue to a colleague to get help responding to the Agents queries\r\n# Respond to the agent, and customer as the external party. \r\n# The response will not be linked to the existing issue unless you are already a request participant of the issue. \r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nJIRA Service Desk should be able to detect the E-mail trail relates to a specific issue, and give the customer an option to enable Automatic request participants based on Email interactions. \r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nJIRA Service Desk fails to recognise that the Emails in the aforementioned scenario relate to a pre-exiting issue, even thought the Email contains the correct headers, subject line, and the other users in To/CC fields are the customer and the Service Desk Email address.\r\n\r\nh3. Notes\r\nThe current functionality for inbound E-mail appears to be: \r\n# Check who the sender of the Email is\r\n# Add sender as a new customer if they are not (depending on SD configuration)\r\n# Decide what to do with E-mail content based on the sender's authorisation.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\nPlease use either *Service Desk Automation* _or_ the *JIRA Automation Plugin* to do this. \r\n\r\n*Using JIRA Service Desk*\r\n# Go To your *Settings* under the affected JIRA Service Desk\r\n# Select *Automation\r\n# Create a new Rule and select \"Custom Rule\" with the following:\r\n## *WHEN*: Issue Created\r\n## *IF*: Issue Matches and Create an Advanced JQL filter\r\n## *THEN*: _Add a Comment_ that indicates that the user is not authorised to comment on the request\r\n## *THEN* _Issue Transition_ that Resolves the issue.\r\n\r\n*Using the Automation Add-on*\r\n# Create a new Rule\r\n# Set the Issue Event to be Issue Created\r\n# Set the JQL Expression to something S\r\n# Add Actions as to how you would like to handle this circumstance. \r\n\r\n*Note on JQL matching.*\r\nThe Affected issues are expected to contain:\r\n- Your E-mail Prefix in the Subject line of the Email\r\n- An Issue Key in the Subject line of the Email\r\n- Either a \"Re:\" or \"Fwd:\" in the Subject line of the Email.\r\n- The content should contain \"_This message is automatically generated by JIRA Service Desk._\"\r\n\r\nTherefore we can create a JQL query to match on these issues: \r\n{code}\r\ntext ~ '\"This message is automatically generated by JIRA Service Desk.\"~0' \r\nAND \r\n(summary ~ \"Re \\\\[CDX\\\\] \\\\[SD\" OR summary ~\"Fwd \\\\[CDX\\\\] \\\\[SD\") \r\n{code}\r\n\r\nYou could add different options to this JQL Query as you see the need to do so, such as project filters.

Expected results\r\n* Replying person's email content from step 3 is added as a comment to the SD-1 issue, no duplicates issues are created\r\n\r\nh3. Actual results\r\n* Replying person's email from step 3 creates SD-2 with *Re:  Foo Is Broken* title.  SD-1 and SD-2 are not linked in any way.  Content from replied email in SD-2 is not present in SD-1 and vice versa.\r\n\r\nh3.

Customer Request Type, Request participants, etc. When the default language is English, these custom fields will be created in English (name and description). When the default language is another language, these fields will be created in the said language. For example, French would be *Participants \u00e0 la requ\u00eate* and *Type de requ\u00eate client*.\r\n\r\nHowever, after it is installed, the name and description will not be updated accordingly if the default language is changed. When originally installed in French, the fields will retain their French name and description even though the default language is changed to English\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Change default language to French\r\n# Install Service Desk\r\n# Check the custom fields page to see the names/description created in French\r\n# Change the default language to English\r\n\r\nh3.

Actual Results\r\n# The name and description remains in French\r\n\r\nh3.Workaround\r\nChange these values directly from the database in the *customfield* table.\r\n\r\nAs many of the custom fields created are system fields, they will be locked.

When an image is attached by an internal account or by a customer, the image that shows up in the automated email is broken.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce \\[bug 1\\]:\r\n# Create a Service Desk ticket as an agent or as a customer. Here is the portal: \r\n# Make sure your Agent account is the assignee. Make sure your customer account is the customer on the ticket.\r\n# Log in as an Agent  and navigate to the Service Desk.\r\n# Open that ticket on behalf of a customer for editing and go to \"More\" and select \"Attach Files\".\r\n# Make an external comment and attach an image to it.\r\n# Log into the email account associated with the customer account. You should see the email come through with a broken image for the attached email. \r\n\r\n\\[bug 2\\] The problem also happens the vice-versa direction, and presumably this is the same underlying issue:\r\n# Log in as a Customer  and navigate to your list of open tickets.\r\n# Edit the same ticket and add an image to a comment.\r\n# Log into the email account associated with your Agent account\r\n\r\n\\[bug 3\\] A third related problem is when you comment and add the attachment on the same time, JIRA doesn't recognize that it exists when it sends the email, so the email contains an error message for the attachments, saying it doesn't exist, even though it is successfully added to the ticket. Another email is sent right after saying the attachment was added:\r\n# Same steps as above, only add the attachment on commenting, by clicking the attachment icon\r\n\r\n\\[bug 4\\] This can also be replicated with emoticons.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nThe customer should receive an automated email with that external comment. \r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\\[bug 1 and 2\\] In first two cases, the images are broken:\r\n!attachment_after_commenting.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\n\\[bug 3\\] The third problem shows this:\r\n!attachments_when_commenting.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\n\\[bug 4\\] Here is the emoticons problem:\r\n!emoticons.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nh3. Note\r\n\r\nIt seems that an agent emailing him/herself does not cause this problem.\r\n\r\nh3.Workaround\r\nNone so far.",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSDCLOUD-2312].\n  {panel}\n\nHello Team \r\n\r\nOur Company wants to use the JIRA Service Desk for all our clients. So we are talking about 50-500 Clients/Organizations (with 100-10000 employees) each using the customer portal to raise their Support Tickets. We want to give them an efficient Ticket Management system/Portal.  So our intention is to let each Client (1-2 Admins) be able to review reports on all their tickets raised with us. We think its too much manual work for us to generate each type of report they require fortnightly/monthly for 500-1000 organizations. It seems like a lot of unnecessary  manual work.\r\n\r\nWe understand JSD Agents only have that permission. We are ready to purchase JSD Agent license for 1-2 people for each organization BUT we want to restrict their access from editing workflows , viewing our internal communication , work logs, etc. Basically we just want them to be able to see issues raised by their own organization and create reports based on them.\r\n\r\nDo you think this is possible? My first alternative was to give them JIRA License but they can  still see our internal communication and worklogs which is bad :( We cant seem to attach our server related attachments to the support Ticket , hiding it from the client. I dont think we want to create duplicate tickets in a different project every time and work on those duplicated tickets rather than the original. \r\n\r\nCan you please suggest a solution or suitable alternative solutions ? \r\n\r\nThank you for your time and support. \r\n\r\nRegards\r\nManjusha \r\n\r\n\r\n",

Summary\r\nAt the moment, when a user is in the *My Requests* page, there are 2 ways to go back to the Help Centre so that the users can create a new request. However, the links are not user friendly and pretty small. Although functional, it does not provide the best user experience\r\n!1.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nh3. Suggestion\r\nInclude a big *Create new request* button in this page so that users can easily create new request by clicking the link. Clicking on the link should either bring the user to a specific project if the user only has access to 1 project, or to the Help Centre if they have access to multiple projects\r\n!new.png|thumbnail!",
