We use Epics in this view, one per business feature.\n\nThe engineering team pulls these into their own Scrum Board by creating a new epic on their board with the same name and linking to the Kanban epic for visibility.  The team is empowered to pull off the kanban as they wish, and create their own tasks.\n\nFor visibility, we want the Kanban Epics linked to the Scrum Epics. \n\nThe workflow is a bit cumbersome\n\n*Problem*\n It is a huge pain to manually link (click the epic in Scrum Board, click More, click Link, etc...  too many steps, and the server response is slow between each).\n\nAlso, when under Link, it is unreliable, I start typing my epic title, and it doesn't show, I have to type the ID for the epic most of the time (PRO-24).  This is a huge pain. \n\n*Solution*\nIt would be nice to drag an epic from one board to another board's epic, to create the link (or right click link, then drag to the other browser window's epic to link it...)....   \n\nAn alternative that would work for us would be ability to auto mirror kanban epics upon creation to a Scrum Board.  I also looked for Bulk Copy but it didn't seem to exist.\n\nAnother alternative would be a kanban view for Epic viewing / editing, in the individual Scrum Board.  Then we could eliminate a level.  Though it is nice to have multiple teams (and multiple Scrum Boards) all linking to the same Kanban, so....

The REST method that retrieves available transitions - {{/rest/greenhopper/1.0/xboard/issue/transitions.json?issueId=<issue-id>}} - for the given issue follows no particular order.\n\nThe random order can be noticed on the \"Update Parent Issue\" dialog - which is triggered when all sub-tasks related to an issue have resolution set; and on the \"Operations\" dialog - that is called when clicking \"More Actions...\" in the context menu for issues in a board.\n\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\n# Create a new *Software* project with a board, using the \"Simplified Workflow\";\n# Check the current order for transitions on any of the situations outlined in *Actual Behavior*;\n# Choose any two transitions from the workflow and set the {{opsbar-sequence}} property in a way the order is inverse to what is currently seen in the board;\n# Publish the workflow with changes applied;\n# Check that opening the issue through its direct link respects the order setup;\n# Go back to the Agile board to check the order of transitions or access the afore-mentioned REST method;\n# Notice the order of transitions is the same as on step 2, regardless of changes to the {{opsbar-sequence}} property.\n\nh3.

      "description": "{panel}Original description by reporter -- Currently, if any issues in Sprint A in one board (Board A) got moved to Sprint B in another board (Board B), Sprint B will show up in the Velocity Report for Board A. \n\nIt would be nice to limit sprints within a board in the Velocity Report. So no other sprints belonging to other boards should show up in the report. {panel}\n\nh3. Summary\n\nVelocity report include sprints from other boards. \n\nh3. Environment\n* 2016-01-18 Cloud, 2016-02-01 Cloud, 1000.383.2 Cloud\n* JIRA 7.x server\n\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\n\nBasically this might happen in the following scenario:\n* You have Board A with filter \"project = A\". You have Sprint 1 with issue A-1, A-2 inside it. The Sprint 1 has to be a future Sprint otherwise it correctly shows up in the report.\n* You have Board B with filter \"project = B\". You have Sprint 2 with issue B-1,B-2 inside it. The Sprint 2 has to be a future Sprint otherwise it correctly shows up in the report.\n\nIf issue A-1 is moved to Sprint B it means that Sprint B will contain 1 issue that match the filter of Board A, thus will make Sprint B APPEAR in board A. If that happen then the velocity report of board A will include Sprint B too. \n\nh3. Expected Results\n\nVelocity Report should only show sprints from other boards if the issues were moved between active sprints, not in planning phase (between future sprints).\nAs moving issues to-from sprints affects velocity (committed/completed), the report should show it accordingly.\n\nh3. Actual Results\n* The chart include Sprint outside the scope of the board, and Sprint might result empty. \n\n!velocity.png|thumbnail!\n \n\nh3.Workaround\n\nNo workaround. ",

      "description": "We have sprints with lots of issues and all of them have multiple subtasks. I have the healthy habit of collapsing all issues that are completely done, to keep an uncluttered overview of the work still to do. JIRA will remember which issues are closed and which are not. So far, so good.\n\nNow something changes in the order of the sprint, like moving an issue up in de order or adding a new issue at the top of the sprint. I know this is not supposed to happen in Scrum during a sprint, but of course it will from time to time. The collapsed / uncollapsed view is now messed up: some previously collapsed issues are now uncollapsed and vice-versa. Of course this is annoying, because I expect all collapsed issues to be done.\n\nI'm a developer myself and did some research to help find & fix the problem. I found that the localStorage entry gh.boardSettings.x has a collapsedSwimLanes property which is an array of numbers. I assume these are issue indices referring to the n'th issue at the sprint board. This would explain why the view gets messed up when you add issues somewhere else than at the bottom of the sprint cause the indices of all 'lower' issues will change.\n\nMy suggested solution is to use issue numbers, like JOC-142 instead of indices as entries in the collapsedSwimLanes array. These are unique per JIRA instance and not depending on any order.\n\nThanks for considering this fix and making an already happy JIRA user even more happy! :)\n\nP.S. I also see numbers higher than the amount of issues on my current sprint, so it seems these are not reset when a new sprint opens and also not during the sprint. When using issue numbers, maybe this should not happen anymore and the whole list should be refreshed every time a change occurs.",
