This is nice, but sometimes I need exact date to use it elsewhere. So:\n\nh1. It is nice to be able to see absolute dates as well as relative. Maybe, it should be a profile option (display absolute dates or relative or both, selectable for everywhere or section-wise)\nh1. While splitting \"Recent activity\" to \"Today\", \"Yesterday\", etc, what criterion do you use?.. If it&#x27;s just a 24-hour delta before current moment, then it may be nice to split days at midnights of user&#x27;s -local time. This may be an option of user his profile too.
