Once we re-index project manually changes are reflected.\r\n\r\nh4.Observations:\r\n- The issue is reproducible, even with the latest version version of Insight (9.0.2).\r\n- It seems to be due to the fact that the Second Read Only CF is being populated AFTER the issue is actually being indexed.\r\n- Read Only custom field value updates following an Issue Created/Updated event, but does not fire this event by itself. As a result:\r\n** The ISSUE_UPDATE event is fired.\r\n** The Insight Object CF is indexed.\r\n** The 1st Read Only CF is updating, and possibly indexed (not always!)\r\n** The 2nd Read Only CF is updated per changes in the 1st Read Only CF - but Issue indexing was performed already and hence it is not being indexed.\r\n\r\nh4. Suggestions:\r\n- It seems to be like a race conditions, when all these changed happen in quick time, so we need to have functionality to ensure that \"*Insight Read Only*\" custom field updates should trigger the issue indexing.

However, it is not possible to ignore the concatenator and not use any value (e.g. so that \"ABC\" and \"1234\" together become \"ABC1234\").\r\nh3. Suggested resolution\r\n\r\nAdd option to disable concatenator completely, so the values are concatenated without any character in between.\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n * Create the desired value right on the source side, example:\r\n ** If using database as a source, create a new column that contains concatenated values from other desired column values (without space), then use that new column as a datalocator.\r\n ** If using CSV as a source, open the file in Excel (or other spreadsheet editor) and use CONCATENATE function to generate a desired value in a new column, then use that generated column as a datalocator.\r\n * Use Insight Automation rule, that would execute a Groovy script which would find if there is a space in the object attribute and remove it.\r\n ** Community blog that provides an example Groovy script: [Groovy script to remove default concatenator after importing Insight objects |https://community.atlassian.com/t5/Jira-Service-Management-articles/Groovy-script-to-remove-default-concatenator-after-importing/ba-p/1782832]\r\n \u00a0",

For example:- User select an object type: Drop Box- Next user selects type of access: read/write (could be dynamic list)- Next user should only see objects within DropBox with selected access typeToday this type of multi level cascading support is not available it seems.

This works also for our accountig team, if they even use CSV-exports to Excel for doing more data evaluation.Now we would like to use our Insight-based asset management also for accounting and contract data management. In Insight we can input prices (i.e. floats) only with the point as decimal separator. So it is very inconvenient to change the pricing input depending on wether I work in Jira standard screens or in Insight.Also: If we export the data for further data analysis, prices will export like \"104.30\". In a german-locale version of Excel this is not even recognized as numbers and we will have to convert data parsing the CSV-file before we can start analysis.Is there perhaps a hack to use?Thanks for any help.",

View Object Graph works well until the service tree starts to be complicated or consists of too many objects. \u00ac\u2020Is there any way how to limit or filter visual representation of the service tree in more sophisticated level than just configuration of reference depth, number of inbound references or types of reference?\u00ac\u2020I would really appreciate if I could:\u00ac\u2211\u00ac\u2020\u00ac\u2020\u00ac\u2020\u00ac\u2020\u00ac\u2020\u00ac\u2020\u00ac\u2020 Collapse / hide particular branches of the service tree \u201a\u00c4\u00ec I can set reference depth to 1 and go down in the structure, but once I expand some branch (and realize I do not need it) I cannot collapse it anymore.\u00ac\u2211\u00ac\u2020\u00ac\u2020\u00ac\u2020\u00ac\u2020\u00ac\u2020\u00ac\u2020\u00ac\u2020 Show only references in the appropriate direction \u201a\u00c4\u00ec When I go down in the structure and expand an object, I can see all his directly related objects no matter what direction their relation is.\u00ac\u2211\u00ac\u2020\u00ac\u2020\u00ac\u2020\u00ac\u2020\u00ac\u2020\u00ac\u2020\u00ac\u2020 Show only objects of a specific types, e.g. I want to see only server objects related directly or indirectly (transitively) on a specific business service.\u00ac\u2020Is there any recommendation how to customize visualization of complex service trees for a human processing?\u00ac\u2020Thanks,\u00ac\u2020Michal\u00ac\u2020\u00ac\u2020||||!image001.png|thumbnail!|||| *{color:#41424e} *Michal Chocholac*{color}*{color:#41424e}Senior IT Manager{color}{color:#41424e}{color}{color:#41424e}+420 702 026 999{color}{color:#41424e} <tel:+420%20702%20026%20999> :{color} [{color:#41424e}{color}{color:#41424e}michal.chocholac@avast.com{color}{color:#41424e}{color}|mailto:michal.chocholac@avast.com]{color:#41424e} :{color} [{color:#41424e}{color}{color:#41424e}www.avast.com{color}{color:#41424e}{color}|https://www.avast.com]{color:#41424e}{color}{color:blue}{color} !image002.jpg|thumbnail!{color:blue}{color} <[https://www.linkedin.com/company/avast-software]>{color:blue}{color}!image003.jpg|thumbnail!{color:blue}{color} <[https://twitter.com/avast_antivirus]>{color:blue}{color}!image004.jpg|thumbnail!{color:blue}{color} <[https://www.facebook.com/avast]>{color:blue}{color}!image005.jpg|thumbnail!{color:blue}{color} <[https://blog.avast.com/]>|\u00ac\u2020\u00ac\u2020\u00ac\u2020",

      "description": "Hi,I'm currently evaluating Insight (along with JIRA Service Desk) as a possible replacement to our current ITSM solution and am very impressed so far about it's ease of use and flexibility :-).One thing I'm struggling with tough is that IQL is limited in its expressiveness (at least of what I can see at https://documentation.riada.se/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=13573623).Here are some concrete use cases I had during LDAP and CSV imports where I'd need some string manipulation possibilities:* LDAP import: Remove the first part of an LDAP distinguishedName (e.g. remove \"cn=someuser,\" from \"cn=someuser,ou=unit1,dc=example,dc=com\" so I can create a reference to the object represented by \"ou=unit1,dc=example,dc=com\")* CSV Import: object1 consists of 2 fields: name, path; object 2 consists of 2 fields: name, path; I'd like to create a reference from object2 to object1 using object2.path=object1.path + \"\\\" + object1.nameIn general I'd expect the following possibilities to be usable in IQL:* String concatenation* String splitting and joining using delimiter* Different ways to build substrings * See https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-lang/apidocs/org/apache/commons/lang3/StringUtils.html for inspiration* Substitution, RegEx matching, Search/Replace* Convert to lowercase/Uppercase/lowerCamelCase/UpperCamelCase/words-with-dashes/words_with_underscores* Replace special characters to generate safe words for URLs, filenames, ...* Encode/decode strings (e.g. urlencode/urldecode, HTML/XML, JSON, base64)* IP address and netmask matching and manipulation* Math functions (add, substract, multiply, divide, power, exponent)* More boolean expressions (NOT and OR)* Bitwise operators (AND, OR, XOR)* Maybe more I did not yet think of ;-)If the use cases I mentioned above are already possible in a way I had not seen, please let me know.Thanks,Andreas",

It is not a calendar per se but a resource view/app with which one can schedule jobs and the resources required to complete the work. We would be interested in getting in touch with your people to find out what Insight can provide on the API level and what functionalities we need to implement ourselves.For example, it would be great to be able to use IQL to search for \"all resources of type vehicle with diesel engine, available between yyyy-mm-dd and yyyy-mm-dd+2\".In this particular context, a calendar as such is not enough. Or \"calendar\" like the way Office365 calendars work. Resource calendar will work for some of their use cases, like when you need special equipment or vehicles to be available and reserved for a particular \"gig\". That is one type of resource lock, i.e. the resource is _locked_ for a time period and needs to be _released_ before it is available for further use. Maybe the resource (again, vehicle or equipment) could be attached to another Insight object (or JIRA issue) between two timestamps. Or something... My thinking around this is not too clear yet and you probably have a number of approaches in mind based on the feature requests received from the field.Anyway, if you end up having a functional scheduling method for, say, electricians, plumbers, vehicles or such, you will\u00ac\u2020have a lot of potential customers from the public sector and from companies (small to large).----I am interested in hearing about your plans related to calendaring, how much of the customer's requirements can be covered by your existing or future features, and how much we need to build on top of Insight's features ourselves.",

The history will over time grow a lot with this behavior.The actual history for the number of tickets attribute is really not interesting here and it should be cool if I could mark this attribute as excluded from the History.
