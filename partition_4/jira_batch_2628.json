Build Engineering reported this is a pain point for them, as these events occur so often that they pollute the logs.\r\nAs they are logged under a section called \"System Errors\" and repetitive, they are misleading to users.\r\n\r\nBamboo logs show:\r\n{noformat}\r\nERROR [11-BranchDetectionBackgroundThread:pool-19-thread-1] [BranchDetectionServiceImpl] Repository error while detecting branches for plan BUILD-PLAN\r\n{noformat}\r\n{noformat}\r\nINFO [10-BAM::PlanExec:pool-17-thread-1] [DefaultErrorHandler] Recording an error: Plan 'BUILD-X8' detected that the repository is invalid. The plan will be disabled. : BUILD-X8\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nThe message is generated even if the [Automatic Branch Management|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/BAMBOO/Using+plan+branches#Usingplanbranches-Automaticbranchmanagement] is set to delete Deleted Branches.\r\n\r\n*Note:*\r\nAs we will be improving the detection of branches deleted, the impact of this issue will be mitigated.\r\n\r\n*Proposed Solution:*\r\nAdd some filter in the system errors section.\r\n",

      "description": "After using Bamboo for a while now, the biggest pain point is the lack of options for displaying code coverage for projects OTHER than Java and Groovy with Atlassian's Clover product. All of our frontend applications use Karma testing that outputs JUnit results, and that's great because any tool that outputs JUnit results can be parsed for Bamboo. What I'm looking for is an option to open up and allow other coverage tools to display a coverage percentage, and Bamboo will parse that out of the logs.\r\n\r\nThe best example for this is GitLab CI. They don't have a defined coverage tool, they allow you to use whatever you want and have your tool output the coverage percentage to the logs. GitLab CI then parses that out based on a regular expression you can define. It then takes that and displays it. (See screenshot attached to show config interface)\r\n\r\nThis would make things so much easier so we don't have to check the logs on each build for the coverage percentage. We can then just use our Grunt plugin to run and output coverage percentage, then Bamboo would parse that based on our regular expression we define, then it could send that back in its integration with Stash. (1 Build Passed, 98.72% code coverage)",

Notes\r\n- The script can be run without failure if we run it manually from terminal or if using Jenkins\r\n- The _lha_ command seems to be stalled with waiting any input from 0 (standard input) when I run strace on the process\r\n{noformat}\r\n# ps auxww | grep lha\r\nroot      3106  0.0  0.0   4148   488 pts/0    S    13:22   0:00 /usr/bin/lha xfqw=/tmp /tmp/test.lzh\r\nroot      3112  0.0  0.0 103212   812 pts/0    S+   13:22   0:00 grep lha\r\n# strace -p 3106\r\nProcess 3106 attached - interrupt to quit\r\nread(0,\r\n{noformat}\r\n- It seems that Bamboo agent associates 0 (standard input) to pipe\r\n{noformat}\r\n# ls -l /proc/3106/fd\r\ntotal 0\r\nlr-x------ 1 root root 64 Jul 13 12:42 0 -> pipe:[28643]\r\nl-wx------ 1 root root 64 Jul 13 12:42 1 -> pipe:[28644]\r\nl-wx------ 1 root root 64 Jul 13 12:42 2 -> pipe:[28645]\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\n\r\nh3.Workaround\r\n- The command is not stalled if you change the last line of the script to this:\r\nbq. /usr/bin/lha xfqw=/tmp /tmp/test.lzh 0>/dev/random",

      "description": "Bulk edit plan permissions are failing when group name inherited from JIRA/Crowd has blank spaces.\r\n\r\nh5. Problem\r\n\r\nIt's currently not possible to create groups in Bamboo with blank spaces in the name (e.g. Atlassian Support Group). Thus we would have to create a group named _atlassian-support-group_ instead. However, this is not true for other applications like JIRA/Crowd, where it is possible to create groups with blank spaces in their names.\r\n\r\nProblem happens when you have Bamboo using JIRA/Crowd as a user repository: [Integrating Bamboo with Crowd|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/BAMBOO/Integrating+Bamboo+with+Crowd]. When you are connecting Bamboo to an external user management system, users and groups are no longer coming from Bamboo. Therefore, when Bamboo gets sync'ed with JIRA/Crowd it pulls the groups with blank spaces in their names.\r\n\r\nh5. Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n# Set up Bamboo to use *Users and groups from JIRA or Crowd*: [Integrating Bamboo with Crowd|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/BAMBOO/Integrating+Bamboo+with+Crowd].\r\n# Add a user to a group with blank spaces in its name (e.g. Atlassian Support Group).\r\n# Go to {{Bamboo administration >> Overview >> Bulk edit plan permissions}}.\r\n# Select a plan which you want to bulk edit permissions.\r\n# Set the *\"Grant permission to\"* field to *\"Group\"*.\r\n# Select the group with blank spaces in the name (e.g. Atlassian Support Group).\r\n# Give the group one of the available permissions (e.g. View, Edit, Build, Clone or Admin).\r\n# Hit the _Next_ button.\r\n# The following error will be displayed:\r\n!bulk-edit-plan-permissions.png!\r\n\r\nh5. Workaround\r\n\r\nInstead of going to the {{Bulk edit plan permissions}} page, access the {{Plan Configuration >> Permissions}} page of the plan you're trying to edit permissions, and manually add the group/permissions in that page. That does not trigger any errors and the group is added to the plan's permissions.",

      "description": "Currently the DB columns for passwords in Bamboo are VARCHAR(255). Given the encryption employed by Bamboo this limits password length to 183 characters. EX:\r\n\r\ninitial password (183 char): {code}ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789ABC{code}\r\n\r\nOnce this password is passed to Bamboo (via the IMSERVER table for this example) the hashed password looks like:\r\nhashed password in DB before import (248 char): {code}m2nxNxQVySj2pvrtpn4jHPiHbwFeoGjQBaKXPVvv1vWwgEmxA3JnUanHcKbsS+yG9OhczobOxEha2JP/aHaB7i1mbbJS0MVpm2nxNxQVySj2pvrtpn4jHPiHbwFeoGjQBaKXPVvv1vWwgEmxA3JnUanHcKbsS+yG9OhczobOxEha2JP/aHaB7i1mbbJS0MVpm2nxNxQVySj2pvrtpn4jHPiHbwFeoGjQBaKXPVvv1vVbn8p8EB/MtA=={code}\r\n\r\nNow this will work fine in Bamboo, but should you create a value that exceeds 183 characters the encryption will output a value that's 256 characters long and Bamboo will fail to store it in the DB, throwing this error:\r\n{code}\r\n2015-07-07 11:40:44,358 WARN [http-bio-8085-exec-9] [JDBCExceptionReporter] SQL Error: 0, SQLState: 22001\r\n2015-07-07 11:40:44,358 ERROR [http-bio-8085-exec-9] [JDBCExceptionReporter] ERROR: value too long for type character varying(255)\r\n{code}\r\n\r\n(!) This part can be worked around by manually updating the db schema such that this column is of type TEXT instead of VARCHAR\r\n\r\nHowever the fairly nasty part of this issue is when you try to export Bamboo with an overly long password value. Since the import process overwrites any schema changes the password will always be stored in a VARCHAR(255) type column. This causes problems because the import process further lengthens the password value. Here is the SAME password value as the first two from the error message of a failed import (344 char):\r\n{code}T0FKm+U2fAMYb8VhSS5LGqxZih3SVch9iw0V4J8aMVDtEkHGSwXY5SbXfPDg/xTsx3B5D3XiH2kZQdEaPTJicMQXMNE8zHLb6CyqoCUBiiEpn/ydxJ5w48+xQnbrGCZuT0FKm+U2fAMYb8VhSS5LGqxZih3SVch9iw0V4J8aMVDtEkHGSwXY5SbXfPDg/xTsx3B5D3XiH2kZQdEaPTJicMQXMNE8zHLb6CyqoCUBiiEpn/ydxJ5w48+xQnbrGCZuT0FKm+U2fAMYb8VhSS5LGqxZih3SVch9iw0V4J8aMVDtEkHGSwXY5RsxQbDXWjVxD6aLD5d9gh8uVZLjHOc3rA=={code}\r\n\r\nWith this situation the import will ALWAYS fail as the string is forced into a VARCHAR(255) type but will always exceed the character limit as the import process overwrites any DB schema changes.\r\n\r\nCurrently the only workarounds for this issue are to return to your original instance and remove the offending string or manually dig through your DB export and remove it, only to add it back after the import process is complete. This may not be feasible in all cases depending on the data.",

Steps to Reproduce:\r\n# Configure Bamboo to use a linked repository to Stash\r\n# In Stash, pull requests to require 1 approver and 1 successful build\r\n# Create a build plan in which the option \"Automatically manage branches\" is checked\r\n# Clone this build plan \r\n# Disable the cloned build plan.\r\n# Make a commit on a new branch\r\n\r\nBoth build plans get branch plans created for them, even the disabled on. The build on the disabled plan fails. Stash then sees both a passing build in the original plan and a failed build in the disabled cloned plan. Now Stash will not let the merge go process as it sees the failed build in the disabled plan as not meeting the requirement to allow the pull request to be merged as Stash seems to require a passing build in all plans where the branch build might occur.\r\n\r\nh4. Expected Behavior:\r\nThe desired behavior is that if the overall plan is disabled, it should not allow automatic branch plans to obtain the branch unless manually added.\r\n\r\nh4. Workaround:\r\nDisable all the individual branch plans or delete the disabled plan.",

      "description": "Both the build expiry and the \"Orphaned Result Deletion Job\" (a scheduled job\r\nthat runs every 120 seconds) perform very poorly on our large MySql Database. We have identified the culprit queries and managed to optimize those for mysql (See patch: [^speed_up_build_expiry_mysql.patch]).\r\n\r\nWithout the patch, queries like this one:\r\n{code}delete from VARIABLE_SUBSTITUTION where BUILDRESULTSUMMARY_ID in (\r\n       select BUILDRESULTSUMMARY_ID from BUILDRESULTSUMMARY\r\n       where BUILDRESULTSUMMARY.BUILD_KEY = \"BAM-1\");{code}\r\nrun over 120 Seconds, as they do a full table scan on VARIABLE_SUBSTITUTION\r\n(which is really large). To make things worse, the query locks\r\nBUILTRESULTSUMMARY, so that queries that try to write to it run into the lock\r\ntimeout. With some optimizations to the database (anything that is suggested\r\n[here|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/BAMKB/MySQL+-+Lock+wait+timeout+exceeded+-+try+restarting+transaction], and more), we were able to mitigate this a bit, but the issue still persists.\r\n\r\nThe patch uses MySql specific \"delete from join\" syntax, but only if the database is MySql. Using this, the equivalent delete queries execute in under a second (as they are able to use the indices).\r\n\r\nAlso see [this question|http://dba.stackexchange.com/questions/104416/mysql-delete-where-in-vs-delete-from-join-and-locked-tables-on-delete] I asked on dba.stackexchange.com.\r\n",

      "description": "When using the atlassian cloud (onDemand) bamboo, if you create an html file artifact in a bamboo plan, when you click on the artifact link, that serves the html file right in your browser. This is the behavior we have been relying on. For example, we have an artifact that is an html file \r\n\r\nhttps://jut-io.atlassian.net/builds/browse/CAM-RMT-1075/artifact/RMTD/s3-artifacts/artifacts.html\r\n\r\nand when you click on this html link in Bamboo's artifacts tab, it serves the html file in the browser so we can then access links in it which point to our test results stored in a private s3 bucket. \r\n\r\nHowever, with the new feature of externalizing storage of artifacts to Amazon S3 bucket, the resulting artifact is not served in the browser; instead, when you click on it, that downloads the html file. This behavior doesn't work for our use case, since we post an HTML test report as an artifact, and need to be able to click through to other files hosted in the S3 bucket. \r\n\r\nWe had a discussion on the support ticket https://support.atlassian.com/servicedesk/customer/portal/23/JST-144258 and the Atlassian side expressed conflicting thoughts:\r\n1) \"It's important to point out that the artifacts were not really made to serve as a web server, so this may well be an expected behavior.\"\r\n2) \"Actually, now I'm thinking that it may be considered a bug, though I'm not sure. I think we can create a bug report for that and see if it gets fixed.\"\r\n\r\nOur specific situation was resolved by not using Bamboo's S3 bucket feature for artifact storage (because this limitation made it a non-starter for our use case), and instead rolling our own independent solution of storing artifacts in S3. \r\n\r\nThis bug is for Atlassian to consider whether you want to keep the feature parity with S3-stored solution compared to Bamboo-stored. \r\n\r\nPlease note that we do fully rely on the ability to access the html artifact in the browser; if you were to decide that even for non-s3-stored artifacts, clicking on the html artifacts will result in downloading the html file instead of serving it, it would completely break our workflow and make Bamboo unsuitable for our needs.
