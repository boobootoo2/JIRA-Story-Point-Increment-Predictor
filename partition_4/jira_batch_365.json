      "description": "{panel}Original description by reporter -- Currently, if any issues in Sprint A in one board (Board A) got moved to Sprint B in another board (Board B), Sprint B will show up in the Velocity Report for Board A. \n\nIt would be nice to limit sprints within a board in the Velocity Report. So no other sprints belonging to other boards should show up in the report. {panel}\n\nh3. Summary\n\nVelocity report include sprints from other boards. \n\nh3. Environment\n* 2016-01-18 Cloud, 2016-02-01 Cloud\n\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\n\nBasically this might happen in the following scenario:\n* You have Board A with filter \"project = A\". You have Sprint 1 with issue A-1, A-2 inside it. The Sprint 1 has to be a future Sprint otherwise it correctly shows up in the report.\n* You have Board B with filter \"project = B\". You have Sprint 2 with issue B-1,B-2 inside it. The Sprint 2 has to be a future Sprint otherwise it correctly shows up in the report.\n\nIf issue A-1 is moved to Sprint B it means that Sprint B will contain 1 issue that match the filter of Board A, thus will make Sprint B APPEAR in board A. If that happen then the velocity report of board A will include Sprint B too. \n\nh3. Expected Results\n\nVelocity Report should only show sprints from other boards if the issues were moved between active sprints, not in planning phase (between future sprints).\nAs moving issues to-from sprints affects velocity (committed/completed), the report should show it accordingly.\n\nh3. Actual Results\n* The chart include Sprint outside the scope of the board, and Sprint might result empty. \n\n!velocity.png|thumbnail!\n \n\nh3.Workaround\n\nNo workaround. ",

      "description": "h3. Summary\n\nWhen importing from JIRA Server to Cloud, if the JIRA Server has Agile in version with build number previous to '#45', the import will finish, apparently correctly, but with failed 'Software' features and alerting errors.\nThe following message is displayed in JIRA:\n{quote}\nJIRA Software is currently unavailable. This might be because an upgrade task has failed to run or has not yet completed.\nPlease contact your system administrator if you continue to see this message.\n{quote}\n\nThe main concern is that for all the user knows, this import worked, as only errors in the logs are available, which are only accessible via Support. If the user misses or ignores the banner, they may insert new data and then a new import to fix this will make them lose the progress.\n\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\n# Have a JIRA Server with Agile in version previous to build '#45'\n# Do a full export and import in Cloud\n\nh3. Expected Results\nImporter warns that the import is not possible because the minimum version required for JIRA Agile is  6.7.12 as per [JIRA Agile 6.7 Upgrade Notes|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/AGILE/JIRA+Agile+6.7+Upgrade+Notes]\nImport process doesn't start\n\nh3. Actual Results\nImport process starts and fails. The site is locked.\nJIRA loads an Access Error in the UI and the logs show:\n{noformat}\nStoring import result with error type: FAILED_VALIDATION\n{noformat}\n\nA few other times it may also show when starting JIRA after importing:\n{noformat}\n2015-11-10 16:14:36.636365500 2015-11-10 16:14:36,631 localhost-startStop-1 ERROR      [c.a.s.core.upgrade.PluginUpgrader] Upgrade failed: This version of JIRA Agile requires a minimum build number of #45 in order to proceed.

      "description": "h3. Problem Definition\n\n    Per documentation at [Ending a Sprint|https://confluence.atlassian.com/agile/jira-agile-user-s-guide/working-with-sprints/ending-a-sprint] , when ending a sprint, any incomplete issues should be moved to the next planned sprint if available. Otherwise, the issues should be moved to the backlog.\n\n    However, when a project has multiple boards, and a sprint is completed from a board based on a JIRA issue filter, any incomplete issues not visible from that specific board are not moved to the next sprint, and are instead placed in the backlog. Only the incomplete issues visible to that specific board are moved into the next sprint.\n\n    To reproduce,\n#    Create a new project (e.g. TestProject)\n#     Add 4 issues to the project, and assign 2 of them with a Labels value of A, and the other 2 with a Labels value of B\n#     Add two sprints (e.g. Sprint #1, and Sprint #2), and place one issue with Labels = A and one issue with Labels = B in each.\n#     Create and save a new Issue filter (e.g. Filter A): project = TestProject AND labels = A\n#     Create a new board (e.g. Board A) in the project from an existing Saved Filter, using Filter A\n#     Start Sprint #1 from any board\n#     Complete Sprint #1 from Board A\n\n    Results: The incomplete issue visible in Board A was moved to Sprint #2. However, in the default board, we can see the hidden issue was moved into the Backlog instead of Sprint #2.\n\nh3. Suggested Solution\n\n    Move all incomplete issues in a sprint, even those not visible in the current Board, to the next sprint when completing the Sprint, assuming there exists a next planned sprint. This will allow for more consistent, predictable behavior.\n\n    For additional flexibility, provide the user a choice on where incomplete issues (visible and not visible to the current Board) should go. This is similar to the existing open suggestion: https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/GHS-6421\n\n    If this behavior is not currently documented, update the \"Ending a Sprint\" article to elaborate on this behavior.    \n\nh3. Workaround\n\n    Avoid completing sprints from a board where issues in the sprint are not visible.\n",

For example, if you have a swimlane for \"priority = High\" and other for \"priority = Low\", Jira could easily consider the lane as \"switchable\", because the only thing that it would need to do is to set the priority to Low or High depending on the swimlane. It could even detect ANDed conditions, like \"priority = Low and assignee = Peter\". Its obvious that for an issue to be there it has to meet both conditions, and it's obvious for Jira what to do (set priority to Low and assignee to Peter). \n\nDifferent are the cases where conditions are ORed or lists of values are used, but for many, many of the cases, this could be achieved quite easily.\n\nThanks.\nRegards.",

Summary\nWhen you use the Epic Link criteria in Basic search mode in the Issue Navigator and start typing in Epic names, the number of results that are returned in the suggestions are much more limited than what you would see of you were writing a JQL statement with the Epic Link field in the Advanced mode.  \n\n!EpicLinkSearching2.png|thumbnail!\n\n\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\n# Using Basic Search, select Epic Link and start typing the name of an Epic (you must have multiple epics already configured and stories assigned to those epics.  It helps to have the Epic Names have a shared letter in them like \"s\")\n# Note the number of epics that are returned in the search element's suggestions.\n\nh3. Expected Results\nThe customer expects that there would be the same number of suggestions returned as one would see if they were perfoming a search via JQL in Advanced Mode (ex Epic Link = \"epic name\")\n\nh3. Actual Results\nThe search critieria element only returns one suggestion\n \n\nh3.Workaround\nThere is no equivalent workaround.

I can\u2019t see any cases where a user would want this.\n\nThe work around:\nWhen needing to move a story from an active sprint on one agile board to an active sprint on another agile board, drag the issue from Board A\u2019s active sprint into Board A\u2019s backlog.\n\u2018Move\u2019 issue from Board A\u2019s backlog to Board B\u2019s backlog. \nThe drag the issue from Board B\u2019s backlog to Board B\u2019s active sprint. \nThis is the only correct way I know of for executing a \u201cmove\u201d of one issue in an active sprint on one Board to another Board without \"linking\" the boards and messing up reporting.\n\nThe \u201cFix\u201d if you have this issue:\nIf the 2 boards have already been \u201clinked\u201d, then you may have to try a few things to decouple them. I\u2019ve decoupled these multiple times and it seems that the specific sequence may depend on a few things. Generally you must move the offending tickets back to one of the board\u2019s backlog (you\u2019ll need a little trial and error to figure out which backlog to move them into), confirm that the boards are no longer linked, then move them back to where you ultimately need them.

When the parent and the subtask aren't in the same column, it displays a little stub at the top of the subtask to say which parent the subtask belongs to. This is great but it's still a bit tricky to visualise all the subtask that belong to a parent in this way when the board is busy.\n\nh5. Suggested Solution\nMy thought for an improvement was that when you hover your mouse over either a parent or a subtask then all the other subtasks/parent are highlighted in some way so you can scan across the screen and see which subtasks are in which column for that parent issue alone.\n\nThe highlighting could be a subtle outlining of the related subtasks and issues or a dimming of the unrelated subtask and issues.\n\nYou could even have a context option over each to \"Show only related subtasks\" that would provide a kind of dynamic Quick Filter which would just show that parent and subtasks.\n\n+note+ - this is not a problem when the rows are grouped per issue, but is when they're grouped per assignee.",

      "description": "The switch to Jira Software provides no way for users to create a new project and manually assign screens, schemes, and workflows as was possible in the previous version. Currently, users are forced to select a Jira Software or Jira Business option that will automatically create a new series of screens, schemes, and workflows for the project. This is problematic for users who have created their screens, schemes, and workflows ahead of time and simply wish to assign them to a new project. As it stands, the user can assign their custom screens, schemes, and workflows but must then go through extra steps to delete the unnecessary screens, schemes, and workflows that Jira Software automatically creates based on the options presented upon project creation.  \n\nWhile users can certainly edit the series of screens, schemes, and workflows automatically created for a new project, problems still exist with that approach. For example, since an active workflow cannot be renames, the process to simply rename the automatically created workflow becomes drawn out i.e. unassign, rename, reassign OR create and assign a new workflow.\n\nIn short, there should be an option to manually select the screens, schemes, and workflows for a new project and users should not be forced into automatically created options. If a user already has screens, schemes, and workflows made and configured the way they want, then what's the point of forcing them to use pre-made options that they're just going to delete anyway? Re-adding an option to manually assign screens, schemes, and workflows during project creation will go a long way toward catering to a wider range of users and maintains the flexibility that users come to depend on with Jira.",
