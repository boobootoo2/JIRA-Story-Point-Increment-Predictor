For example, if the max restriction on \"In-Progress\" has been set to 5, is there a feature that once 5 tasks have already been dropped into that column, another can't be dropped in there beyond the line above it turning red? \n\nFurthermore the max restriction seems to apply just tasks, is there a way to limit it to per user. For example, only 5 tasks can be moved to \"In-Progress\" per user vs 5 tasks max among 3-4 users? \n\nKindly let me know if anything is unclear, I look forward to hearing from you. \n\nThanks! \nKelsey ",

My first thought was to be able to add a flag-comment to the card layout but I think this will be hard since the card is quite limited in size and some comments are looooong.\n\nA better way to look at this would maybe be to add a pop-up with the latest flag-comment that emerges when you hover the flag-icon :-D\nThen you will get quick info about the impediment without having to open either the Issue Detailed View or the entire issue.\n\nWdyt?

      "description": "{panel:bgColor=#e7f4fa}\n  *NOTE:* This bug report is for *JIRA Software Cloud*. Using *JIRA Software Server*? [See the corresponding bug report|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSWSERVER-13632].\n  {panel}\n\nh3. Summary\n\n* When browsing to 'Manage Boards' it's possible the 1min Ajax timeout in JIRA kicks in, preventing the board from loading. This will result in a timeout as per the attached screenshot.\n* Additionally, when accessing the Rapid Boards for certain projects the page load times can be excessive.\n* Please note there is another more specific bug related to slow _All Boards_: [JIRA Software Viewing All Boards can timeout due to resolving project list for each loaded board - JSW-15295|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSW-15295]\n\nh3. Environment\n\nReproduced with the following instance size:\n\n{noformat}\n    ___ Database Statistics ____________________\n\n         Issues                                        : 330776\n         Projects                                      : 187\n         Custom Fields                                 : 180\n         Workflows                                     : 306\n         Users                                         : 3719\n         Groups                                        : 2060\n         Attachments                                   : 118585\n         Comments                                      : 265597\n{noformat}\n\nIt could be:\n* 52 Rapid Boards were using the {{issue in parent()}} function\n* Large number of boards and/or complex JQL used in the board filters.\n\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\n\n# Use a large instance, such as above.\n# Install a third-party plugin that provides additional functionality. This was reproduced with J-Tricks, using {{issue in parent()}}.\n# Access the Manage Boards page, or browse to projects.\n\nIt is important to note that this affected rapid boards which did *not* use that third-party JQL, as {{com.atlassian.greenhopper.web.sidebar.AgileBoardScopeFilterContextProvider.getContext}} (the JIRA Software code called from the JIRA Core sidebar) executes the same code to perform project lookups by analysing JQL queries (analysing, not executing). The problem is due to the way the third-party plugin is designed is that the operand executes when it's analysed. Specifically this is not conclusively caused by third-party plugins.\n\nh3. Expected Results\n\n* The Manage Boards page does not time out, and the project page loads within an acceptable time.\n* Viewing Rapid Boards responds in a reasonable time frame.\n\nh3. Actual Results\n\nThe ajax timeout kicks in and the page times out whilst waiting for {{rest/greenhopper/1.0/rapidviews/viewsData}} to return results, or the board can take > 1 minute to load.\n\nh3. Notes\n\nAccessing that endpoint outside of JIRA (and thus bypassing ajax) in this instance returned within 1.2mins.\n\nThis appears to be caused by {{QueryToProjectMapper.getProjectContextIdsForQuery}} which uses JIRA Core code to lookup the QueryContext. Due to the way the lookup occurs it's possible that JQL may be executed and this times out the board.\n\nA sample snapshot of the problem has been attached.\n\nh3. Verification\n\nThe problem occurs in multiple areas of JIRA Software - it's most evident in manage boards however can occur on the Rapid Boards. \n\nFor Manage Boards:\n# Call {{/rest/greenhopper/1.0/rapidviews/viewsData}} will be slow (40+ seconds, in some cases will not return anything as the AJAX timeout terminates the request).\n# Class {{com.atlassian.greenhopper.web.rapid.view.RapidViewListResource.getViewsAndConfigModel}} will be present in the stacktrace for long-running threads: \n{code:borderStyle=solid}\n\"http-nio-80-exec-45\" #8007 daemon prio=5 os_prio=0 tid=0x000000003cac0000 nid=0x19dc runnable [0x000000027765a000]\n...\n        at com.atlassian.greenhopper.web.rapid.view.RapidViewProjectHelper.getRapidViewProjectList(RapidViewProjectHelper.java:58)\n...\n        at com.atlassian.greenhopper.web.rapid.view.RapidViewListHelper.buildListAndConfigModel(RapidViewListHelper.java:105)\n...\n        at com.atlassian.greenhopper.web.rapid.view.RapidViewListResource.getViewsAndConfigModel(RapidViewListResource.java:74)\n...\n{code}\n\nFor Rapid Boards:\n# Many threads will be waiting on a response to {{AbstractFuture$Sync}} as per the attached screenshot. These threads are waiting on the populattion of the cache that {{FieldPossibleValues.getProjectIdsForQuery}} queries.\n# There will be one executing thread in {{QueryToProjectMapper$RapidViewCacheLoader.load}}, populating the cache.

      "description": "Our department has recently switched from another ticket system to using the JIRA ticket system software.\n\nFor the most part it is really good.  We are having lots of problems though with communication and notifications.\n\nThe biggest problem is the way that tickets are sent to people.  We are not JIRA Administrators so we cannot make global changes so we need to make changes as JIRA users.\n\nOn other systems, we could choose which ticket groups we wanted to get emails for, but it appears in JIRA we have to be watchers on a ticket in order to get emails.\n\nThe problem with this is we have to know about the ticket before we can become a watcher and then even if we know about the ticket we have to logon and do some clicks to become a watcher.\n\nSo we would like to be able to automatically be watchers of all new tickets in an Instance, but then be able to opt out of the emails for certain components.  So if an instance has components A,B,C, by default we would become auto-watchers of any tickets in the instance that are assigned to A,B, and C.  User 1 is fine with this because he watches all components.  User 2 though only needs all emails related to component C so they would like to opt out of components A and B.\n\nAnd we need the ability to set all this up from a User level and not have to bother Administrators or do any kind of extra workarounds and inventive schemes to make this happen.\n\nI would like to talk to somebody at Atlassian further about this issue and see what kind of suggestions can be made.  Or perhaps there is a different way to use the software to accomplish the same feature.",

Workaround \n\nThird-party add-on that add this functionality to JIRA here: https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.almworks.jira.structure/server/overview. Unfortunately, it is only available for JIRA Server.\n\nEnd user could as separate Feature 1, Feature 2 and Feature 3 their own separate projects. Then create a saved JQL filter to search for all Epics in project. Setup a JQL filter to search for all Epics in project Feature 1. Will not update systematically as JQL filter will need to be changed everything new Epic is added to Feature 1. \n\nAnother possible workaround would be for the end user to create a multi-project agile board governed by epic swimlanes. Create board title Feature 1 and manually configure the board filter to contains all 20 Epics in Feature 1. Will not automatically update when you create additional Epics for Feature 1 as the JQL board configuration will need to be adjusted",

Always generate backup of your database before making any changes to it via SQL. Any workaround requiring SQL changes carries inherent risk so a backup of your DB is essential to restore working conditions if there is a critical problem.
