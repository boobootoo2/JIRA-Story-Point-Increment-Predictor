This will force the board to the proper naming.\n\nAlso I suggest that when a Project Administrator creates a new board it should be \"Private\" by default which would mean that it should not show for all other Project Administrators unless it is shared to a specific group/role or project (just the same way as when creating a filter).\n\nWe had the same problem with stuctures created by anyone when we installed the Structure plugin.

We can't expect the users to manually refresh the page before they click on *start sprint*. Different teams might start their own sprints simultaneously.

Expected Results\nIssues are released and new *Version* is created.\n\n\nh3. Actual Results\nThe release takes a long time due to the number of issues and a time-out error is displayed.\n\nh3. Notes\nThe error is only at the UI level, though, and the operation continues in the back end. The new Version is created and released, and all issues are updated as expected.
