Steps to reproduce below uses the default custom fields to reproduce\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Create a Service Desk project\r\n# Create a custom field of type _Number Field_ and add the field to the appropriate Service Desk screen\r\n# Configure one of the request type for the Service Desk (/servicedesk/admin/<pkey>/request-types/group) and add the custom field to the request type\r\n# Verify that this field is visible when visiting the Customer Portal\r\n# Navigate to the *Manage add-ons* page, filter for _All add-ons_ and expand _Custom Field Types & Searchers_. Load all modules and *disable the _Number Field_ module* (Because we used _Number Field_ in step 2)\r\n#* This simulates a disabled add-on when a custom field from an add-on is used instead\r\n# Refresh the customer portal page where this field is visible in step #4\r\n#* Either that, or refresh the request type configuration page where you added this custom field (eg. /servicedesk/admin/<pkey>/request-types/request-type/\\{id})\r\n# Repeat step 5 but this time enable the _Number Field_ module instead\r\n# Refresh the page in step 7 again\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n# Once the module is enabled, the field will re-appear in the customer portal and the configuration page when they are refreshed\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n# The field doesn't re-appear and users will have to manually add the field again\r\n# When checking the {{AO_54307E_VIEWPORTFIELD}} table in the database, we can see that the relevant row is removed from the database after step 6 when the customer portal or configuration page is refreshed/loaded\r\n\r\nh3. Notes\r\n* If these pages aren't loaded/refreshed when the module/add-ons is disabled, the custom field configuration will remain\r\n* This is raised as a Suggestion because it is intended behaviour.

For example, a goal of _1w 6d 24h_ is showing as _1w 6d_, which gives Agents a wrong impression of the SLA goal. \r\n\r\nh3. Suggestion\r\n- Show the exact goal or up to 3 units of time\r\n- To render it in 24 Hour format rather than referring to the Working Hours. E.g. Taking the result of the Time from a REST Call below, it would show as \"2d 1h\" even though the working hours is not 24 hours per day:\r\n{code}\"remainingTime\": {\"friendly\": \"-49h 37m\",\"millis\": -178653955}{code}\r\n\r\nh3. Why is this important\r\nShowing only 2 units of time might not help Agents to have a clear picture of how much time they have. 'Due in' _1w 6d_ is very much different than 'due in' _1w 6d 24h_, instead of having to always hover over the remaining time to figure out when is the SLA due date and time, the readability and the accuracy of the goal display should be reliable. While for the 24 Hour format, it would be more friendly for the agents rather than have the need to check the working hours from the calendar which at the moment could be rendered like \"1d 25h\" wherein a day there should be only 24 hours.",

Problem\r\nAccording to Ehcache documentation http://www.ehcache.org/documentation/2.7/configuration/data-life.html#30343 elements can stay in the cache after expiration and actually expired element is evicted only when it is accessed or resource constraints are reached. As service desk doesn't set any size constraint for the cache, expired elements are not evicted during reindex, each element accessed only once.\r\n\r\nFor larger instances this can result in a massive amount of memory being consumed, causing indexing speeds to be slowed/impacted and maybe even fail.\r\n\r\nThis affects DC only. In Server environment different type of cache is used which behaves differently in this case.\r\n\r\nh5. Workaround\r\n\r\nOn each node find atlassian-jira/WEB-INF/classes/ehcache.xml file and add size limit for cache named \"com.atlassian.servicedesk.internal.sla.customfield.SLACFType.slaValueCache\", i.e.:\r\n{code}\r\n<cache name=\"com.atlassian.servicedesk.internal.sla.customfield.SLACFType.slaValueCache\" maxBytesLocalHeap=\"500m\"/>\r\n{code} \r\nRestart node after updating ehcache.xml to changes to have effect.\r\n\r\nh5. Fix\r\n\r\nFix sets default size limit for SLAValue global cache to 2 million elements and adds *system property* \"servicedesk.slavalue.global.cache.size.limit\" which can be used to change that limit.\r\nZero or negative value of this system property means unlimited cache size.",

Summary\r\nWhen no issues are opened during a reported time period, it is more useful to management(who is reading the report) to see that 100% of a goal was met rather than 0%.  With the current design of the '% Met' report options, it is impossible to tell whether a bunch of tickets have been raised and breached, or no tickets have been raised at all.\r\n\r\nh3. Environment\r\nService Desk 3.8.1\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Use the default SLA goal configuration in a pristine environment\r\n# Create a new test issue at the \"Highest\" severity\r\n# Immediately transition the issue to closed\r\n# Create a new custom report that displays 'Time to resolution - % Met'\r\n# Set the report to 'Past 48 hours'\r\n# Notice the spike from 0% to 100% in the last hour\r\n# Wait an hour without opening any other issues\r\n# Notice the last hour moves back to 0%\r\n\r\nThe same behavior happens when 'Time to first response - % Met' is selected.  \r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nDuring periods where 'No issues' are found, the goal of responding to or resolving zero tickets has essentially been achieved.  This should be reflected as 100% met.    \r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nPeriods where 'No issues' are found reflect as 0% met.  This information doesn't reflect whether issues are not being responded to or if no issues came in at all.\r\n\r\nh3.Workaround\r\nWhile it is possible to us the 'Time to first response - Breached' and 'Time to resolution - Breached' options to get similar information from the opposite direction, the '% met' reports contain totals for all of the incoming tickets.  This is potentially more useful because you might be able to extrapolate why issues are breaching(e.g., higher volume).",

Server customers will get it in the next server release (3.2.0) very very soon!\r\n\r\nTo find out more about this feature, check out our blog post and documentations here: https://confluence.atlassian.com/servicedeskcloud/blog/2016/06/more-transitions-fewer-notifications\r\n\r\nI want to thank everyone for all the feedback provided and hope you enjoy the feature \ud83d\ude03\r\n\r\n\u2014 JIRA Service Desk\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\n\r\n{panel:title=Update April 2016|bgColor=#f5f5f5}\r\nHello! Thank you for all your continuous feedback on this feature! \r\n\r\nFor those who wants to use this feature for approval purposes, we recently launched an approval feature in JSD. This approval feature allows more complex approval processes and will lock down the transitions properly for non-approvers. For more information please have a look at [our documentation |https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/SERVICEDESKCLOUD/Setting+up+approvals].\r\n\r\nFor the rest of you, we are in the implementation phase for the design shared earlier so it will be coming soon! :) \r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nVincent\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\n{panel:title=Update Feb 2016|bgColor=#f5f5f5}\r\nHi all!\r\n\r\nJust thought we will give you guys a sneak peak into what is coming. Since the last time we updated our design team have came up with some design for this feature! We want to hear your thoughts on them and here's a survey for you to give feedback: [a short survey| https://vincentwong.typeform.com/to/qJwDRW].\r\n \r\nI have attached some screenshots on this ticket with our designs.\r\n\r\n1. The first screen shows how the feature will be configured. You can select any transition on the workflow editor and make it transition-able by customers\r\n !JSD40_1.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\n2. The second screen show that the user can select the \u201cclose request\u201d transition which was set up previously\r\n !JSD40_2.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\n3. The third screen shows what happens after the user selected \u201cclose request\u201d, a dialog appears which allow the customer to leave an optional comment\r\n !JSD40_3.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\n4. The forth screen shows what happens after the user close the request, the request is transitioned and the comment is added\r\n  !JSD40_4.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\nWe love your feedback, so please fill out the survey! ;)\r\nCheers,\r\nVincent \r\n{panel}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs Reporter of the issue created from Customer Portal I want to have ability of Reopening my issue within my Request on portal, and not going to classic JIRA view of the issue to do so.\r\nThis is example of classic workflow, but there could be many of use cases when creator of request should hit some button rather than just sending a comment.",

The expectation is that the goal will not be changed with an additional holiday on a weekday.\r\n\r\nHowever, if there is a holiday defined in the calendar and if his holiday occurs *any day after the creation of an issue and before the SLA goal is reached*, an extra day will be added to the \"within\" and \"remaining\" time of the SLA panel.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to reproduce the issue\r\n # Configure the SLA calendar to have working hours from 9am to 6pm, Monday to Friday.\r\n # Configure the Time to resolution SLA to have a goal of 30 hours.\r\n # Create a ticket at 10.30am Monday.\r\n # Take note of the goal and display of the Time to resolution SLA of the ticket.\r\n # Edit the SLA calendar and add Tuesday (the next day) as a holiday and save it.\r\n # Check the same ticket for the goal of the Time to resolution SLA.\r\n # Remove the holiday from the calendar and repeat the previous step.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected result\r\n * The goal shouldn't change with Tuesday being a holiday, however, the due date & time should be one day later.\r\n ** *Before adding a holiday*: The goal of the Time to resolution SLA is 2d 12h.

Problem Definition\r\n\r\nThe documentation [Managing service desk notifications|https://confluence.atlassian.com/servicedeskserver036/managing-service-desk-notifications-921471702.html] needs some clarification about the situation where an Agent is assigned to a request shared with an organization, while being part of the organization.\r\n\r\nIn the documentation, it says:\r\n{quote}\r\nAgents don't receive notifications of their own changes when they act as a customer on issues with a set request type. Agents acting as a reporter, participant or approver on these issues are always treated as a customer, regardless of the settings in their project's JIRA notification scheme.\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nIn this paragraph, only the roles reporter, participant and approver are mentioned, but there is no mention of the case where the agent is part of an organization.\r\n\r\nA customer faced the situation where the agent was part of an organization, and the documentation was not clear enough about how the notifications should be sent to the agent.\r\n\r\nIn this situation, we should say that the Agent:\r\n- won't receive any email notification from the project's JIRA notification scheme (even if this Agent is the assignee of the ticket)\r\n- will only receive the customer notification saying \"XXXX shared this with your organization. View the request and select Get notifications to follow along.\"\r\n\r\nI was able to reproduce this behavior by following these steps:\r\n- I created a service desk project\r\n- I created the organization \"Organization 1\" that contains a customer and an agent\r\n- I filed a new request from the portal by using the customer account , and shared it with Organization 1 \r\n- The agent received a customer notification saying that a ticket was shared with my organization \r\n- I used an admin user in JIRA to assign the ticket to the agent \r\n- I added a comment to the ticket from the customer account\r\n- The agent didn't receive any notification\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Why this is important\r\n\r\nThe notification system in Service Desk is pretty complex, and there are lots of different scenarios that impact the way notifications are sent to customers or agents.\r\nFor this reason, our documentation should be as complete as possible.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nImprove the documentation to include the scenario where the Agent:\r\n- is part of an organization shared in a request\r\n- and is the assignee of the ticket",

Problem definition\r\n\r\nThe multilingual service desk is not implemented in Server, thus it's expected to see fields and some settings in English regardless of the customer's profile language. Nevertheless, for some languages like Japanese and German, all general settings are correctly translated. However, if a user uses Chinese as the profile language, everything remains in English.\r\n\r\nThis also affects Service Desk Screens in JIRA Administration, such as the \"JIRA Service Desk Configuration\" screen\r\nh3. Steps to reproduce the problem\r\n # Change the JIRA default language to Chinese.\r\n # Log in to the portal and verify the profile language as Chinese.\r\n # Go to the main portal page and observe the display language.\r\n # Change the language to Japanese.\r\n # Go to the main portal page and observe the display language.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected result\r\n\r\nMany settings/buttons/links are displayed in the language same as the profile language, for example, the page below shows some options in Japanese when using Japanese.\r\n !screenshot-1.png|thumbnail!\r\nh3.
