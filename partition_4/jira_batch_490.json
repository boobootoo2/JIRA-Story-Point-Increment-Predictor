Currently JIRA Service Desk supports all custom fields except Group pickers, Project pickers and Version pickers. The Project one is not relevant to the portal's users -- please let us know how you'd use it if it's relevant to you so that we can understand your use case. We haven't heard many customers asking for groups and versions and therefore they are not on our current roadmap. We'd like your use case for these ones, esp. the group field.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nIn terms of add-on fields from our partners, e.g. nFeed, this is something we would like to have in JSD in the future but are currently not on our short to medium term roadmap.\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u2014 JIRA Service Desk team{panel}{panel:title=Update as of 13 March 2015}\r\nHi everyone,\r\n\r\nThanks for your input!

I am happy to announce that as of JIRA Service Desk 2.0 launched last week, you can now purchase JIRA Service Desk based on the agents on your team. Each agent can serve unlimited customers. Whether you serve 100 or 100,000, customers are free.\r\n\r\nFor more details about the new pricing, please refer to our blog at: http://blogs.atlassian.com/2014/09/introducing-jira-service-desk-2-0/\r\n\r\nEdwin Wong\r\nGroup Product Manager, Service Desk\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\nIn a scenario where I have a team of 100 people, but around 500 customers, JIRA Service Desk is not exactly the best fit due to licensing policy as I would have to purchase sits for those 500 customers too.\r\n\r\nIt would be awesome having a licensing policy similar to Zendesk's. Where there are sits just for the customers, and you don't pay much more for those.\r\nOf course, those users would only be able to create issues and comment on it. \r\n",

Problem Definition\r\nThe old Service Desk beta used to have the ability to disable notifications.\r\nThat configuration seems to be gone now. We'd need to disable it and not confuse users with two types of email notifications.\r\n\r\nThe notifications seem to be tied closely with the workflows statuses. It's very difficult to manage this. If you have 20 buttons, and suddenly you modify the Project's workflow, you'll now need to dive in to all 20, and re-key in the status mappings.\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n- An option to adhere to the global settings or have a per project configuration\r\n- An option to set the configuration on a project level\r\n- A Per Service Desk configuration option, to toggle specific Service Desk Notifications\r\n- Tooling to help determine what specific notifications are configured (like the [JIRa Notification Helper|https://confluence.atlassian.com/jira/jira-admin-helper-376834956.html#JIRAAdminHelper-NotificationHelper]) for usability.\r\n \r\nh3. Workaround\r\nNo Workaround at this time has been determined. \r\n",

Therefore we think it is only fair to not keep this issue as open and close it as \"won't fix\".

To find out more about this feature, check out our documentation [here|https://confluence.atlassian.com/servicedesk/jira-service-desk-3-6-x-release-notes-915154145.html]\r\n\r\nOn behalf of the JSD team, I want to thank all of you for your patience.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\nVidhu Sharma\u00a0\r\nJIRA Service Desk - Product Manager\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n----\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nCurrently, the service level agreement (SLA) feature only allows the entry and display of SLAs in hours. Sometimes, an issue may take a few days to resolve, or lower priority issues could have a target resolution, for example, of 5 days (working days, hopefully - when the calendar feature is implemented).\r\n\r\nIt'd be great if these longer timeframes could be converted when displayed, into a more user-friendly time format. For example five days currently shows as 120 hours. Maybe this could be an option the admin sets, and the raw value (hours) displayed when you hover over the SLA?",

Thank you for all your continuous feedback on this feature! \r\n\r\nFor those who wants to use this feature for approval purposes, we recently launched an approval feature in JSD. This approval feature allows more complex approval processes and will lock down the transitions properly for non-approvers. For more information please have a look at [our documentation |https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/SERVICEDESKCLOUD/Setting+up+approvals].\r\n\r\nFor the rest of you, we are in the implementation phase for the design shared earlier so it will be coming soon! :) \r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nVincent\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\n{panel:title=Update Feb 2016|bgColor=#f5f5f5}\r\nHi all!\r\n\r\nJust thought we will give you guys a sneak peak into what is coming. Since the last time we updated our design team have came up with some design for this feature! We want to hear your thoughts on them and here's a survey for you to give feedback: [a short survey| https://vincentwong.typeform.com/to/qJwDRW].\r\n \r\nI have attached some screenshots on this ticket with our designs.\r\n\r\n1. The first screen shows how the feature will be configured. You can select any transition on the workflow editor and make it transition-able by customers\r\n !JSD40_1.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\n2. The second screen show that the user can select the \u201cclose request\u201d transition which was set up previously\r\n !JSD40_2.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\n3. The third screen shows what happens after the user selected \u201cclose request\u201d, a dialog appears which allow the customer to leave an optional comment\r\n !JSD40_3.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\n4. The forth screen shows what happens after the user close the request, the request is transitioned and the comment is added\r\n  !JSD40_4.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\nWe love your feedback, so please fill out the survey! ;)\r\nCheers,\r\nVincent \r\n{panel}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs Reporter of the issue created from Customer Portal I want to have ability of Reopening my issue within my Request on portal, and not going to classic JIRA view of the issue to do so.\r\nThis is example of classic workflow, but there could be many of use cases when creator of request should hit some button rather than just sending a comment.",

JIRA Service Desk 2.5 contains lots of other goodness and you can read the full release notes [here|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/SERVICEDESK/JIRA+Service+Desk+2.5+Release+Notes].\r\n\r\nAfter analysis of this issue we decided to move forward favoring ease of use by building an editor for the help center. The ability to add *custom html/css* is not something we can put on our short to mid term roadmap. Therefore we think it is only fair to not keep this issue as open and close it as \"won't fix\".\r\n\r\nWe have also created two separate tickets to keep tracks of your other customization needs. Please vote on the suggestion you'd like to see first:\r\n Help Center Footer Customization\r\n Help Center Body Customization\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n Joseph\r\n JIRA Service Desk Product Management\r\n{panel}",

Workaround\r\n\r\nIncrease the plugin start timeout from default 60 seconds to 300 seconds by specifying the startup parameter -Datlassian.plugins.enable.wait=300. For a better description please see Resolution #4 on following page: https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRAKB/JIRA+System+Plugin+Timeout+While+Waiting+for+Plugins+to+Enable\r\n\r\nRestarting JIRA without specifying this parameter has been known to workaround the problem. Please note though that if you don't specify the increased timeout you will likely run into the same problem when you try updating the plugin to a newer version in UPM.",
