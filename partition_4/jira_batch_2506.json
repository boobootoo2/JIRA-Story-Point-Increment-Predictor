If I am looking at a commit message in BitBucket and it has tags in it that link to specific issue(s) in JIRA, and I can get from JIRA to the relevant commits, merges, and branches in BitBucket, then why does a missing header matter?\n\nuse case:  Joe is a developer and begins work on this project by cloning the repo. He discovers a bug and wants to make sure that the lead developer is aware of it. He goes to the overview page in BitBucket, but does not see an \"issue tracker\" link in the header where one would appear if the project were using BitBucket&#x27;s internal issue tracker. Since he is new to this project, he has not viewed detailed commit messages from other developers that link back to specific issues in JIRA. He concludes that this project does not have an associated issue tracker so decides to abandon his interest in the project.\n\nplease see: https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/BITBUCKET/Set+up+a+Wiki+and+an+Issue+Tracker?focusedCommentId=585072784#comment-585072784\n\nI have the same basic issue linking between the Bitbucket repo and the associated page in Confleunce.",

      "description": "Relative urls in readme.md files only work half the time. (BB-7521)\\\\\nNick Zarczynski avatarNick Zarczynski created an issue 2013-02-10\\\\\nI have the following project structure:\\\\\ndoc/\\\\\ngetting_started.md\\\\\n...\\\\\nreadme.md\\\\\nIn my readme.md file, I link to the getting_started.md document like so:\\\\\n[Get started|doc/getting_started.md]\\\\\nWhen viewing the readme.md file in the source tab this link 404&#x27;s (it points to ../project/doc/contributing.md)\\\\\nBut when I click on the readme.md file and view it, the link works (correctly points to ../project/src/31...8e/doc/contributing.md)\\\\\nThere is a (possibly?) subtly different problem for relative links in sub-folders. Given the project structure of:\\\\\ndoc/\\\\\nstyle/\\\\\nmarkdown.md\\\\\nreadme.md\\\\\ntop_level_readme.md\\\\\nIn the readme.md file, if I have a link to style/markdown.md as follows:\\\\\n[Markdown Style Guide|style/markdown.md]\\\\\nIt will break in a similar manner to the above (50% of the time), but with the following urls:\\\\\nOverview page links to: ../project/src/31...8e/style/markdown.md\\\\\nWhile viewing readme.md links to: ../project/src/31...8e/doc/style/markdown.md\\\\\nComments (67)\\\\\nBrian Nguyen\\\\\nHi Nick,\\\\\nThanks for reporting.\\\\\nI&#x27;ve confirmed that the problem with relative links only works if the readme is rendered at a specific commit. If it is rendered generally (like on the overview page), then it will not work.\\\\\nI have added the issue to our backlog, and please watch this issue for further updates.\\\\\nCheers, Brian\\\\\n2013-02-13",

      "description": "It is common for a PR to be a feature, and to have a number of files added/remove/changed.\n\nOften the best way to walk through a review of such a feature is by walking through the changes in some logical order _that is best defined by the author of the PR_\n\nFor example, a recent Java PR I was reviewing had a couple of new enums, some domain classes, some DAOs for those classes, some services that use those DAOs/classes, a web interface on top of those services, and tests for all of those pieces.\n\nIt makes sense to review the code is something resembling that order. But the PR always presents the review in alphabetical order, which is only vaguely better than random.\n\nI&#x27;d like the author (or anyone with edit ability on the PR) to be able to reorder the list of files that have been changed, so that they can be presented in a logical order to make the review simpler.\n\nRight now it&#x27;s common for me to have 3 or more tabs open with the same PR so I can jump around more easily and try and get my head around what&#x27;s going on.",

      "description": "From BCLOUD-7402:\n\n\"The issue of not firing the hooks for a Merge or Sync from the BB Branch Tools (/branches) prevents a key scenario for my team (on Mercurial). We&#x27;d like to be able to enable testers to pull the latest DEV code into the TEST branch and thus receive a new build from our CI system (AppHarbor). If we could fire hooks from the Branches page on BB, this would be a one-stop shop for them, but as it is now, our testers have to either do the merge themselves locally or (more likely) have a developer do it. This is highly asymmetrical treatment of the remote push versus an internal push - oddly implemented to my thinking.\n\nAnd if this gets worked on, I&#x27;d like to suggest a button to \"Fire All Hooks\" or similar to force external CI listeners to rebuild/etc. This would be a nice-to-have as an effective way to force the rebuild/redeploy of software when making changes to hardware/settings/etc on an external CI provider or to force a rebuild in case of other failure. Not strictly BB&#x27;s problem, but like I said, making BB a one-stop provider only makes the offering stronger. It would also help hook testing.\n\nI&#x27;ve also submitted this through Attlassian support (BBS-7460) and they basically told me that I had an interesting idea.&#x27;",
