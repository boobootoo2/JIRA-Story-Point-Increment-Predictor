In its finest version, BB issue would be saved as OpenERP issue and bound to an OpenERP project.\n\nBut I think this is not possible with the data currently contained in the payload this broker would receive.

This accident can be easily avoided if I was aware that the other developer has done some work in his fork.\n\nI think the design of the new bitbucket webpage can be improved to make it such mistakes harder to happen: On the overview page of a repository, when user clicks \"Forks\", a pulldown menu will show up on the page to list the current forks. See the attached image for an example. The menu can be improved to show a bit more information. One essential part is the number commits that the forker has done within his fork. Bitbucket&#x27;s old webpage design has this information, and therefore I assume there&#x27;s no technical difficulty to add it back. This information is especially useful for developers of the original repo.\n\nPS. I am unsure which component this issue belongs to, but I chose \"toothpaste\" because this is the most interesting option in the list.",
