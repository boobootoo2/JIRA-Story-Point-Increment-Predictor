Issue Summary\r\n\r\nWhen linking a Confluence space to a Jira Service Desk project, an error appears saying that the Confluence application link is missing or invalid.\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Go to the project settings for a Jira Service Desk project.\r\n # Go to the 'Knowledge base' settings page.\r\n # Click on 'Link to a Confluence space'.\r\n # Observe the following error: \"*Can't connect to Confluence because the application link is missing or invalid. Check the Confluence settings in Application Links.*\"\r\n\r\nNote that this issue only occurs on Jira sites where there are two Confluence application links which are both marked as 'system' and 'primary', and one of them is invalid. This can be checked by going to the 'Application Links' page in Jira settings.\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nA Confluence space can be linked to the knowledge base for the project without any errors.\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nThe following error appears: \"*Can't connect to Confluence because the application link is missing or invalid. Check the Confluence settings in Application Links.*\"\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nThe error occurs because the invalid Confluence application link is marked as both 'system' and 'primary', meaning Jira tries to use it instead of the real 'System Confluence' application link. Since the invalid application link is marked as 'system' it cannot be deleted to fix the error. However, the following workaround can be used to remove the 'primary' status from it allowing a knowledge base to be linked:\r\n # On the Jira site, press the '.' key to open the quick navigation menu.\r\n # Type 'Application links' and navigate to the page.\r\n # Add a dummy Confluence application link. This can be done by doing the following:\r\n ## Enter a dummy URL into the textbox on the page, for example, 'https://test'.\r\n ## Click the 'Create new link' button.\r\n ## In the dialog that appears, ignore the warning and click 'Continue'.\r\n ## Enter a dummy application name, for example, 'Test'.\r\n ## For the application type, select 'Confluence'.\r\n ## Leave the other fields blank and click 'Continue'.\r\n # Once the dummy application link has been created, mark it as primary:\r\n ## Click the menu button (\u2022\u2022\u2022) under the 'Actions' column for the dummy application link that was just created.\r\n ## Click 'Make primary' in the dropdown menu that appears.\r\n # Delete the application link that was just created by clicking the menu button (\u2022\u2022\u2022) for the application link and choosing 'Delete'.\r\n # You should now be able to navigate to Project settings and create link a Confluence space to a knowledge base.",

Currently this is not possible. Since the data is being stored on a custom field, as soon as the customer changes their star rating, that value overwrites the previous data for that interaction.\r\n While the issue history in Jira does indicate the date/time of a satisfaction rating was provided, it does not track what that rating was.\r\n\r\nIn turn these original ratings are lost.\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nTrack the historical rating values in some manner. Either in the issue history, or when viewing the changelog of the issue via the API, this information would be useful to be able to store and retrieve.\r\nh3. Why this is important\r\n\r\nIt is possible for a customer to incorrectly update the wrong request, or worse update all their previous requests and change these values. This provides a very skewed CSAT values if done, and does not accurately reflect the original CSAT ratings given initial provided\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nNone",

Problem Definition\r\nA recent change to the details view triggering the notification banner\r\n{quote}\r\n\"We've collapsed your details and activities view to help you focus on work that matters most, Click Show... to expand\" \r\n{quote}\r\nContrary to the noted intent this causes disruption in the workflow for some use cases rather than increased focus to all, as it adds in additional click to see content before interacting which is critical to many users workflows\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\nThe Primary feedback point we have received is adding  in an option to choose the default value of Expanded or Collapsed by the administrator in place of a hard set option for the default configuration.\r\n\r\nSecondary suggestion is on a users first interaction and view of an issue, show the details expanded or collapsed per the administrators default choice noted above and ask user if they would like the details expanded or collapsed by default and set the value on a per user basis in the users profile \r\n\r\n",
