It would be nice if there is a way to allow modern browsers to use the CSS3 gradient, but have older browsers fall back on using the gradient image.\n\nIn webkit this is as easy as adding the following style to the {{{bundle.css}}} file:\\\\\n{{{\\\\\n#wiki table.wikitable th {\\\\\nbackground: -webkit-gradient(linear, 0% 0%, 0% 100%, from(#eee), to(#fff));\\\\\n}\\\\\n}}}",

I&#x27;m just not very adept with SSH - I&#x27;ve gone through your troubleshooting guides and I still can&#x27;t resolve the issue.\n\nI&#x27;m attempting to clone a git repository in a remote server, and I&#x27;m wondering if someone can help me troubleshoot. I&#x27;ve added my localhost rsa key to the remote host and to my bitbucket profile. when i run ssh git@bitbucket.org from my local machine it works fine.  Below is the verbose output from the remote host when I run ssh -v git@bitbucket.org on the web server:\n\n{{{\\\\\n#!python\n\nOpenSSH_4.3p2, OpenSSL 0.9.8e-fips-rhel5 01 Jul 2008\\\\\ndebug1: Reading configuration data /etc/ssh/ssh_config\\\\\ndebug1: Applying options for *\\\\\ndebug1: Connecting to bitbucket.org [207.223.240.181] port 22.\\\\\ndebug1: Connection established.\\\\\ndebug1: permanently_set_uid: 0/0\\\\\ndebug1: identity file /root/.ssh/identity type -1\\\\\ndebug1: identity file /root/.ssh/id_rsa type -1\\\\\ndebug1: identity file /root/.ssh/id_dsa type -1\\\\\ndebug1: loaded 3 keys\\\\\ndebug1: Remote protocol version 2.0, remote software version OpenSSH_5.3\\\\\ndebug1: match: OpenSSH_5.3 pat OpenSSH*\\\\\ndebug1: Enabling compatibility mode for protocol 2.0\\\\\ndebug1: Local version string SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_4.3\\\\\ndebug1: SSH2_MSG_KEXINIT sent\\\\\ndebug1: SSH2_MSG_KEXINIT received\\\\\ndebug1: kex: server->client aes128-ctr hmac-md5 none\\\\\ndebug1: kex: client->server aes128-ctr hmac-md5 none\\\\\ndebug1: SSH2_MSG_KEX_DH_GEX_REQUEST(1024<1024<8192) sent\\\\\ndebug1: expecting SSH2_MSG_KEX_DH_GEX_GROUP\\\\\ndebug1: SSH2_MSG_KEX_DH_GEX_INIT sent\\\\\ndebug1: expecting SSH2_MSG_KEX_DH_GEX_REPLY\\\\\ndebug1: Host &#x27;bitbucket.org&#x27; is known and matches the RSA host key.\\\\\ndebug1: Found key in /root/.ssh/known_hosts:3\\\\\ndebug1: ssh_rsa_verify: signature correct\\\\\ndebug1: SSH2_MSG_NEWKEYS sent\\\\\ndebug1: expecting SSH2_MSG_NEWKEYS\\\\\ndebug1: SSH2_MSG_NEWKEYS received\\\\\ndebug1: SSH2_MSG_SERVICE_REQUEST sent\\\\\ndebug1: SSH2_MSG_SERVICE_ACCEPT received\\\\\ndebug1: Authentications that can continue: publickey\\\\\ndebug1: Next authentication method: publickey\\\\\ndebug1: Trying private key: /root/.ssh/identity\\\\\ndebug1: Trying private key: /root/.ssh/id_rsa\\\\\ndebug1: Trying private key: /root/.ssh/id_dsa\\\\\ndebug1: No more authentication methods to try.\\\\\nPermission denied (publickey).\n\n}}}\n\nAny help with this would be greatly appreciated!\\\\\nRegards,\\\\\nPete Thompson",
