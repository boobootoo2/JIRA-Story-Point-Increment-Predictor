Summary\r\nAs a JIRA Service Desk Administrator, I would like to be able to set up my Service Desk to auto assign tickets in a Round Robin fashion. This would be extremely helpful if it offered several different ways to have auto-assignment handled \r\n\r\nh3. Environment\r\nCloud\r\nServer\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Enable\r\n# Open project settings\r\n# Click on a menu option in the left hand menu (perhaps Auto Assignment?)\r\n# Select the type of auto assignment you want to enable within the Service Desk project\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nCurrently there is no option to do this within Service Desk\r\n \r\nh3. Notes\r\nThis feature would add more value if it allowed at minimum these two types of round robin assignment:\r\n\r\n- Assignment based on number of issues each Service Desk Agent currently has\r\n- Assignment based on all Service Desk Agents that are part of the Service Desk queue (this would not take into consideration backlog per agent rather it would just simply go down the list and assign tickets)\t",

      "description": "h3. Summary\r\n\r\nWhen loading the 'SLA goals' page, it takes a very long time to load and in certain situations the AJAX timeout may kick in and prevent the page from properly loading. This appears as per the attached screenshot - no data is populated.\r\n\r\nh3. Environment\r\n\r\nThis was reproduced on Oracle 11g, however could also occur on MS SQL.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n# Setup a SLA with a decent number of goals - this was repro'd with 80.\r\n# Access the SLA tab.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nThe page loads quickly, retrieving the appropriate results.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nThe page takes a significant amount of time to load, and in some cases may fail to load altogether as the AJAX timeout kicks in (this is 1 minute).\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nIncreasing the timeout may allow the page to eventually load - this can be done with the following:\r\n\r\n# Open [Chrome Developer Tools|https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/docs/overview#access], select the console and enter the below (this sets a timeout of 10 minutes):\r\n{code}\r\njQuery.ajaxSetup({timeout:600000});\r\n{code}\r\n# Click on the SLA tab (open it in the same window, not a new one).\r\n# The page should eventually populate, after the SQL has finished executing and the results are returned.\r\n\r\n(i) This workaround will only apply to the window that argument is set in - there's not an easy way to apply it to the entire instance.\r\n\r\nh3. Notes\r\n\r\nThis is caused by a bug in the Active Objects library, which is tracked in [AO-565|https://ecosystem.atlassian.net/browse/AO-565]. Upgrading to JIRA 7 or higher will fix this problem, as it contains the fixed version of the Active Objects library.",

      "description": "h3. Summary\r\nThere are some warning message in log file regarding Service Desk Automation even if there is no automation rule was set. The error message is not good enough to narrow down to any root cause of the warning message.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Installed Service Desk.\r\n# Create a Service Desk project.\r\n# Delete all the automation rule.\r\n# Observe the atlassian-jira.log for the warning message with error message; \"ErrorMessage@b16ceeed\".\r\n# To check if there is any automation rule that is active, you can run the following SQL:\r\n{noformat}\r\nselect * from \"AO_9B2E3B_RULESET\";\r\n{noformat}\r\nSample output for no active automation rule:\r\n{noformat}\r\n-[ RECORD 1 ]------+--\r\nACTIVE_REVISION_ID |\r\nID                 | 1\r\n-[ RECORD 2 ]------+--\r\nACTIVE_REVISION_ID |\r\nID                 | 2\r\n{noformat}\r\nSample output for an active automation rule:\r\n{noformat}\r\n-[ RECORD 1 ]------+--\r\nACTIVE_REVISION_ID |\r\nID                 | 1\r\n-[ RECORD 2 ]------+--\r\nACTIVE_REVISION_ID |\r\nID                 | 2\r\n-[ RECORD 3 ]------+--\r\nACTIVE_REVISION_ID | 3\r\nID                 | 3\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n* No warning message regarding automation rule since there is no automation rules set in Service Desk. \r\n* Have a proper error message for the warning instead of \"ErrorMessage@b16ceeed\".\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nThe below exception is thrown in the atlassian-jira.log file:\r\n{noformat}\r\n2015-11-03 14:11:59,706 http-bio-8081-exec-19 WARN xxx 851x69978x1 xxxx xx.xxx.xx.xxx /rest/api/2/issue/13533/comment [execution.whenhandler.event.AllEventListenerEventWhenHandlerVisitor] Event when handler execution of com.atlassian.servicedesk.plugins.automation.servicedesk-automation-modules-plugin:servicedesk-commented-automation-rule-event-when-handler failed with error com.atlassian.pocketknife.api.commons.error.ErrorMessage@b16ceeed\r\n2015-11-03 14:20:43,426 http-bio-8081-exec-16 WARN xxx 860x70162x1 xxxx xx.xxx.xx.xxx /secure/CommentAssignIssue.jspa [execution.whenhandler.event.AllEventListenerEventWhenHandlerVisitor] Event when handler execution of com.atlassian.servicedesk.plugins.automation.servicedesk-automation-modules-plugin:servicedesk-commented-automation-rule-event-when-handler failed with error com.atlassian.pocketknife.api.commons.error.ErrorMessage@b16ceeed\r\n{noformat}\r\n \r\nh3.

This suggestion is to add a way for a customer with a JIRA license to navigate from the portal to the JIRA interface.\r\n* JIRA interface refers to JIRA Core, JIRA Software and JIRA Service Desk when viewing the project through the JIRA project view.\r\n\r\nh5. Example Use Case:\r\nAs a user of JIRA Software as well as JIRA Service Desk. I frequently find myself moving between these two applications. I would like an easy way to navigate between the customer portal and the JIRA interface.\r\n* Currently there is no navigation from the portal back to JIRA. I find myself going to the URL and removing the Service Desk portion so that I am taken back to JIRA. \r\n* When working in JIRA Software, I must enter the URL for the Service Desk portal in order to access the portal and create a request. There is no navigation I can use to access the portal. (A workaround is provided below)\r\n\r\nh5. Navigating from JIRA to Customer Portal\r\n* The Service Desk menu at the top of the JIRA can be used to navigate to the portal (Service Desk > Create Service Desk Request)\r\n* This menu was removed in JIRA 7. You can use [Application Navigator | https://confluence.atlassian.com/jira/creating-links-in-the-application-navigator-346948276.html] to link to the customer portal URL. JIRA users can then use the application navigator to reach the Service Desk portal.\r\n",
