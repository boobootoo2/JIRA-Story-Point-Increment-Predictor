I have good news! We've now increased the amount of time an API token stays valid to 1 year before it expires. New API tokens will now allow you to select an expiration date within 1 year from the day of creation. Your feedback is key to helping us prioritize features and learn more about how we can improve our products for you. \r\n\r\nThanks for your continued feedback and involvement,\r\n Rak Garg\r\n Product Manager, Atlassian\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\nThe Admin API requires a token API Key to work as highlighted here [https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/admin/organization/rest/]\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe only way to revoke the API key now is manually by going to the Admin API page. The preferred method would be to allow\u00a0a custom expiry length / date for this token or API Key.\u00a0",

The changes will allow admins to:\u00a0\r\n * see accounts with unverified emails on the Managed Accounts page\r\n * filter for unverified accounts on the Managed Accounts page\r\n * resend the verification email to any account that has not yet verified their email address.\u00a0\r\n\r\nOur [public-facing documentation|https://support.atlassian.com/user-management/docs/resend-a-verification-email-to-a-managed-account/] has been updated to reflect these changes ahead of the rollout.\u00a0\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nIlya Bagrak\r\n Principal Product Manager, Enterprise Cloud\r\n ibagrak (at) atlassian.com\r\n{panel}\r\n\u00a0\r\nh3. Issue Summary\r\n\r\nWhen a new email address is known to Atlassian either via account creation or email change, the email address needs to be verified so that our system will know that there is a valid mailbox for the email address. If the email address is not verified, the account will not be activated and will cause the following problems.\r\n - Email change will not proceed.\r\n - User cannot login using the unverified email address.\r\n\r\nFor managed accounts, only verified accounts will be listed. Org admins will not be able to identify that the account is unverified when their end user complains that they cannot login to Atlassian. Org admins may also consider the unverified email address as free to use for email address change when it's not.\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Set up an AA organization and claim a domain\r\n # Invite a new domain user to any Cloud site\r\n # Skip the verification email for the new domain user\r\n # Go to *Managed Accounts* in admin.atlassian.com\r\n\r\nInvitation pending user is not manageable via REST API as well:\r\n{code:bash}\r\nAPI_TOKEN=\"__YOUR_ORG_TOKEN__\"\r\nAAID=\"5e376c2d14836c0cc108afcd\"\r\ncurl --request GET \\\r\n  --user \"${USER}:${API_TOKEN}\" \\\r\n  --url \"https://api.atlassian.com/users/${AAID}/manage\" \\\r\n  --header \"Authorization: Bearer ${API_TOKEN}\" \\\r\n  --header \"Content-Type: application/json\"\r\n{code}\r\n{code:javascript}\r\n{\r\n  \"key\": \"forbidden\",\r\n  \"context\": \"Error: Caller must be an org admin of targeted account or be the targeted account\",\r\n  \"errorKey\": \"forbidden\",\r\n  \"errorDetail\": \"Error: Caller must be an org admin of targeted account or be the targeted account\"\r\n}\r\n{code}\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nThe unverified domain account should be listed as \"unverified\". The admin should then have the option to send a new verification email or a password reset email.\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nThe unverified domain accounts are unknown to the Org admins.\r\nh3. Notes\r\n\r\nA [password reset email|https://id.atlassian.com/login/resetpassword] can be used to initiate a verification in case the user missed the original verification email.\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nIf a domain account is existing in Atlassian Cloud but is not listed under the org's *Managed Accounts*, please contact [Atlassian Support|https://support.atlassian.com/] to check the status of the account.\r\n\r\nTo allow an unverified email address to appear under *Managed Accounts*\r\n\r\n!error taken.PNG|thumbnail!\r\n - Launch an incognito browser in Chrome and access [https://id.atlassian.com/login/resetpassword]\r\n - Send a password reset email to the domain email address\r\n - Request the user to access password reset email in the domain mail inbox. *Set a password*\r\n - The password reset will activate the account and it should start appearing under *Managed Accounts*\r\n\r\nh4. For Customers using SAML SSO, password resets cannot be sent/used as authentication is enforced through the Identity Provider\r\n * Use the [Export accounts|https://confluence.atlassian.com/cloud/export-managed-accounts-964968073.html] functionality to get the user Atlassian account id\r\n * With this ID, navigate to your Organization's Managed Accounts, Show the Details of a Managed Account, and replace the Atlassian account ID with the one gathered from above\r\n ** Direct link: [https://admin.atlassian.com/o/<orgID>/members/<AtlassianAccountID>|https://admin.atlassian.com/o/%3CorgID%3E/members/%3CAtlassianAccountID%3E]\r\n * Change the Email Address of the Unverified Account and revert the change and it'll appears in Managed Accounts\r\n\r\nKB [Unable to change user email with error saying it is already taken, but the other account is not visible in the organization|https://confluence.atlassian.com/cloudkb/unable-to-change-user-email-with-error-saying-it-is-already-taken-but-the-other-account-is-not-visible-in-the-organization-1005791991.html]\u00a0",

This fix negates the need for this feature.\r\n{panel}\r\nh3. Problem Definition\r\n\r\nThere are some cases where an email is changed (i.e. a@a.com to b@a.com) , however, the SAML Id on Atlassian side is still related to that old Account so when the user tries to log in he receives an error saying that:\r\n{code:java}\r\nlogin.forbidden.handle-linked-saml-users.update-linked-primary-user-email-failed-400.content\r\n{code}\r\nor _*user is blocked*_\r\n\r\nCurrently, the only way to resolve these issues is contact support to gather some details regarding the user such as:\r\n - The [SAML Response|https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirakb/how-to-view-a-saml-responses-in-your-browser-for-troubleshooting-872129244.html] from the user login attempt.\r\n - Check the old and new email address.\r\n - Check in what account the application historic is placed.\r\n - Check if that account has the correct email address and change it if it doesn't has.\r\n - Escalate the ticket to the dev team to clear the SAML link.\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solutions\r\n\r\nCreate a feature that allows the _Organization Administrators_ to clear the _SAML Id_ link from their managed accounts. That will reduce the number of escalations to the development team since the SAML link can be cleared by the Org Admins or the support team.\r\nh4.

My team and I have released a new and improved audit log that contains many of the activities mentioned on this ticket. The log currently covers the following activities:\u00a0\r\n * A user was added to a group\r\n * A group was created / deleted\r\n * A group\u2019s permissions were altered\r\n * And many more\r\n\r\nThis new log works across your entire organization, aggregating events from all of your Jira and Confluence sites into one place. Although it only contains user and group management activities today, we are working on expanding the set of events on an ongoing basis.\r\n\r\nTo use the log, you must have a valid Atlassian Access subscription or trial. The log can be accessed from: *Organization administration settings -> Security -> Audit log (Beta).* Please be aware that this is a beta version of the feature and you may encounter bugs. If this happens, please file a support ticket or comment on this issue so that we can continue to improve this feature.\r\n\r\nThanks for voting and commenting on this issue. Your feedback has been incredibly helpful to our team as we\u2019ve worked on bringing this information to you. We know how important audit logs can be to any organization, and sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused you.\r\n\r\nWe remain focused on bringing more activities to the audit log and would love to hear any feedback you have for us. Please feel free to email me directly at [rgarg@atlassian.com|mailto:rgarg@atlassian.com] if needed.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n Rak Garg\r\n [rgarg@atlassian.com|mailto:rgarg@atlassian.com]\r\n Product Manager, Atlassian\r\n{panel}\r\n\u00a0\r\n Have advanced audit features in User management where a site admin can view audit of user who\r\n * added new users\r\n * created new groups\r\n * assigned users to groups\r\n * revoked a user\u00a0\r\n * deleted a user\r\n * deleted a Group",

Problem Definition\r\n\r\nCurrently admin.atlassian.com does not show the verification status of Atlassian accounts in the UI or CSV export.\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nWould be great to have a feature to export all managed accounts that show their full names, email address, application linked with the account, status (enable or disable), verify status (verified or unverified).\r\nh3. Why this is important\r\n\r\nWith the unverified status account, the org admin can reverify the account by sending out the verification email. It's also good to know the exact number of the managed accounts so in the event of Server migration, the org admin would know how many users are they expecting not to be imported.",

I'm excited to announce that password policy management has been decoupled from Atlassian Access, and is now offered as a core platform feature for no additional cost! To enforce password policies for your users, you'll need to first create (or access) your organization at [admin.atlassian.com|http://admin.atlassian.com/]. From there, follow our instructions to [claim a domain|https://confluence.atlassian.com/cloud/verify-a-domain-for-your-organization-873871234.html].\r\n\r\nIf you've already taken ownership of a domain, then you can immediately start using password policy management for your managed accounts. Thank you for commenting and interacting with this ticket. It's hugely impactful to us as a product development team to understand how best to serve our customers, and we appreciate your time.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or concerns, please don\u2019t hesitate to email me at rgarg@atlassian.com\r\n\r\nBest, \r\n Rak Garg\r\n Atlassian Product Management\r\n{panel}\r\nAccording the documentation you must subscribe to Atlassian Access to enforce password policies.\u00a0 [https://confluence.atlassian.com/cloud/password-policies-938859739.html]\u00a0\r\n\r\nGiven the state of cyber-security, strong passwords should be a default platform feature for Jira Cloud and not something only available through an additional subscription.\u00a0\r\n\r\nI understand putting identity provider integration, 2FA, and additional value added password management options behind a subscription (custom expiration, custom rules) given the additional value they provide.\u00a0 Though I do not see why strong passwords (or at least the option for them) is not considered a default platform configuration.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if I'm misinformed about the default policy for Jira cloud passwords.\u00a0\u00a0",

Expected Results\r\n\r\nOrganization admin can search managed accounts in multi-byte characters. Or, make it searchable by username or email address, not only by display name (full name).\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nOrganization admin cannot search managed accounts in multi-byte characters.\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Note\r\n\r\nbq. From the Managed accounts page, you can search accounts by name and email address. When you enter search criteria that is more than 3 characters, we return results that match at least 3 continuous characters in your search criteria in addition to results that include the full string.\r\n\r\nAs documented at [Administer managed accounts for an organization|https://confluence.atlassian.com/cloud/administer-managed-accounts-for-an-organization-873871203.html], Atlassian Access has a 3-character restriction in search criteria; however, please consider not to apply this restriction to multibyte input because the vast majority of CJK names consists of 1 or 2 characters. For example, my last name \"Yamamoto\" is very common in Japan, and it is written in 2 characters \"\u5c71\u672c\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\n-The search form can handle a single multi-byte character. So try to search by 1-character such as \"\u3053\" out of \"\u3053\u3093\u306b\u3061\u306f\". This is a very poor workaround especially for large organizations, but better than nothing.-\r\n\r\nNone. The workaround introduced here is no longer available because of the 3-character restriction described above.\r\nConsider adding yourself as a watcher to be kept informed as to the state of the bug moving forward. With that way, if our development team updates the ticket, you'll be notified via email.\r\n",
