To enable the integration features, each application link must use 2-legged OAuth (without user impersonation) for both incoming and outgoing authentication. \n{quote}\nThis is not accurate because I was able to get it working, with or without User Impersonation. \n\n============================\n\n2. *User Authentication for OAuth* \nAccording to the documentation: https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/APPLINKS/Configuring+Authentication+for+an+Application+Link \n{quote}\nImpersonating authentication types make requests on behalf of the user who is currently logged in. People will see only the information that they have permission to see. This includes OAuth and Trusted Applications authentication.\n{quote}\nTake the following example: (I tested this with JIRA 6.2.6 and Confluence 5.4.4. Impersonation is *enabled* in Confluence's incoming OAuth authentication)\n# Lets say I am trying to link a Confluence page in a JIRA issue via the Link Confluence page option.\n# I have User_A in JIRA and User_B in Confluence.\n# As User_A, I click on the \"authenticate\" button in JIRA to authenticate with Confluence.\n# I log in as User_B. \n# Token is approved and I can now link the page without problems.\n\nIn this case, how does enabling Impersonation make any difference ? The docs say that we should be authenticating *as User_A*, because *that is the user that I am currently logged in as in JIRA*. User_A has no token in confluence because the token was approved for User_B anyway. \n\nAs a test, I disabled user impersonation again, and the behavior is *exactly* the same as having it enabled. I still can approve tokens for other users etc. ",

Detailed Explanation\n\nTested with JIRA 6.3.15, Stash 3.10.2 and Bamboo 5.9.3\n\nTo display builds JIRA uses the same definition that Stash does to display builds associated with a pull request.  From the Stash documentation, [Checks for merging pull requests|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/STASH/Checks+for+merging+pull+requests]:\n{quote}\nSelect this option to stop pull requests from being merged if they have any unsuccessful builds. _For a pull request, this checks builds that run against the latest commit on the source branch._ (emphasis added)\n{quote}\n\nThe number of builds shown in JIRA is builds of the last commit of that branch.  This makes sense in a pull request context because each commit is a different state of the code and only the final state of the code will be merged.  When a build is triggered these variant builds can be run in parallel, resulting in multiple successful builds of the same version of the code.\n\nIn the JIRA issue context the total number of builds referencing the JIRA issue would be more useful.  This gives a relative idea of how much activity has occurred for the issue.\n\nCheers,\nMorgan Knicely\nAtlassian Premier Support - Austin, TX\n",

Here's what I did, as far as I can remember:\n\n1. I had 3 issues with 3 BitBucket pull requests associated with them, visible through the Development panel on the Issue page.\n2. I accepted the pull requests into the {{develop}} branch. The Version page showed no warnings, as no issue was under review any longer.\n3. I created another pull request to merge {{develop}} into {{master}}. BitBucket detected the issues as being associated with the pull request.\n4. The Version page showed 3 warnings, saying that there are unmerged pull requests.\n\nAt this point, hovering over \"Under Review\" for each issue on the Version page showed a popup stating that there is 1 pull request. Clicking \"Under Review\" reveals 2 pull requests, one of which is the original pull request for the issue, and the other one is the one from {{develop}} into {{master}}. On the Issue page for any of the 3 issues, similar behaviour could be observed: the \"Development\" panel shows 1 pull request with status \"Open\". Clicking it reveals 2 pull requests, one of which is the {{develop -> master}} pull request with status \"Open\" and the other one is the original issue pull request with status \"Merged\".",

The old Commits tab, however, listed the branch name in the commit detail view. The new Development tab does not list the branch name along with the commit in the commits detail overlay. This was extremely valuable information, since not all of our branches follow the \"feature branch\" format (for example our \"prerelease\" and \"bugpatch\" branches). For those branches that are not tagged with the issue number, we now can no longer tell which branch the commits have been pushed to, since that information does not show up anywhere in the Development panel. As a side note, our QA department used the Commits tab in this manner: Click on it in one issue, go through the list of open stories for testing to see which branches things were on. Because the \"last selected\" tab was automatically selected when opening another issue, that allowed QA to flip through the issues with minimal interaction. That is now also not possible with the Development panel, as you must click on the commits link in every issue in order to view the information.\nA configurable flag to *also* show the Commits tab would be an acceptable improvement, but showing the branch identifier in the Commits detail list is really a better improvement (although more clicks, we have other ways to flip through the list)\n\n\n*JIRA Version v 6.1.7*\n !screenshot-1.png|thumbnail! \n\n*JIRA Version v 7.1.2*\n !screenshot-2.png|thumbnail! \n",

This contains related branches, commits, pull requests, builds, and deployments. [Learn more here|https://confluence.atlassian.com/jira/viewing-the-code-development-information-for-an-issue-445186939.html].\n\nFrom your comments we believe the best fix would be to allow for related development activity to add to the activity tab rather than bring back the source tab. If there are other details that you believe wouldn't be covered by that fix, please add your scenario in the comments below.\n \nThanks for your patience and we hope you appreciate our open approach to feature requests.\n \nCheers,\nMegan\nAtlassian Product Management\nmcook@atlassian.com\n{panel}\n\n*Original request description:*\n\nWhen this was removed, a lot of functionality was removed with it.

Summary\r\n\r\nIntermittently, an agile Kanban project with Backlog enabled doesn't display the \"Backlog\" section icon\u00a0in the sidebar menu or the \"Kanban board\" option.\u00a0Scrum boards don't show the \"Backlog\" and \"Active Sprints\" icons in the sidebar menu.\r\nh3. Environment\r\n * JIRA Software\r\n\r\nh3. Cause\r\n\r\nThe memory cache of the board doesn't contain a project ID, although the filter does, so the board is considered to be without a project and so it doesn't display the options. This cache is rebuilt every 30 minutes so the problem fades away.\r\nFor this reason, the problem doesn't affect all board but it does affect all users accessing the board.\r\n\r\n*The reason for the cache being incorrect is still unknown.*\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nWhile the problem is happening\r\n # Go to a board with the problem.\r\n\r\n*Somehow board cannot get the project ID* so Backlog is missing.\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nThe left bar would show \"Backlog\"\u00a0section icon.\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\n\"Backlog\" section icon\u00a0is\u00a0missing.\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nBackground Reindex JIRA\r\nThe problem may still happen again in the future and another reindex will be needed to refresh the memory cache.\r\nAlternatively navigate to the board using the Board menu. Backlog can be accessed by adding {{&view=planning}}\u00a0to the board URL.\r\nAlso, it's possible to try the new JIRA experience.

So, we don't have any plan mode on our boards.\nWhen all the work concerning 1 initiative comes to the end, I transit my epic to Closed status with Post-function on it \"Update Epic Status = Done\". My final status also has the property \"Jira.issue.editable = false\" set on it.\nNext time, when I go to my Epic, I will not be able to add Issues in epic (because my epic is now not editable). However, when I create new issue and start filling \"Epic Link\" field, i still can see my epic in dropdown list. Moreover, I can pick particular Epic, create issue within it and no system message/ error appears. Finally, when I look at my Closed Epic, I can see it's Issues in Epic field updated with the information about recently added issue.\n\nAs far as i'm concerned, the only way to eliminate my epic from Epic Link field's dropdown list is to mark it as done on my Scrum board. However, the way we work doesn't suppose running Scrum boards.\nSo, my question is:\nHow can I eliminate my closed Epic (with its cf\"Epic Status\" = Done) from Epic Link field's dropdown list?\n",
