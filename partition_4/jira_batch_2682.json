      "description": "Our Bamboo setup in the meantime manages more than 100 Plans (might grow to ~150 plans till the end of this year) grouped into about 15 Projects.\r\n\r\nTo manage these many plans it would be helpful to get some more features in the Dashboard to handle many plans.\r\n\r\nWhat we have now:\r\n- The \"current activity\" Tab is very helpful to see whats up in the moment.\r\n- The \"My Bamboo\" Tab in our setup does not help much (because most of our developers have to monitor many plans, and me the admin has to monitor all of them).\r\n- I can collaps projects to hide projects I'm not interested in. Unfortunately (at least when using the Chrome Browser) Bamboo does not remember this when I come back to the Dashboard.\r\n\r\nSome Ideas how to improve this:\r\n\r\n- Improve Bamboos ability to remember which projects where collapsed/expanded\r\n- Add an option/button to hide all inactive  plans\r\n- Add an option/button to hide all successful plans\r\n- Allow filtering of plans (i.e.: show only all plans with \"XXX\" in the Plan-Key/ ...)\r\n- Allow to store such combinations of options/filters for later use.\r\n\r\nWould be nice to get something similar to these ideas in one of the next Bamboo releases.
