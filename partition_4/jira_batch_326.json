Versions and Epic Panels are both available in next-gen backlog now. \r\n Please give it a try and let us know what you think! We are closing this ticket. If you feel this issue hasn\u2019t been fully addressed, kindly tell us more about your use case. \r\n Thank you,\r\n Emily Chan\r\n Product Manager, Atlassian.\r\n\r\n!image-2020-08-07-17-47-49-334.png|width=233,height=166!!image-2020-08-07-17-48-54-901.png|width=266,height=166!\r\n{panel}\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nRecently, versions and releases were added to JIRA next-gen.\r\n\r\nIn JIRA classic, there was a column in which issues could be added to an epic or version just by drag-and-drop a ticket (see screenshot). I'm convinced that this will be a highly appreciated feature.\r\n\r\n!Screenshot 2020-01-07_16-19-46-412.png!",

The prompt wouldn\u2019t show up if you are already moving all the child issues along with their respective epics at the same time.\r\n\r\nLikewise, if you are moving child issue(s) and they have a linked epic, then you will get a warning to tell you that the child issues will lose their epic link.\r\n\r\nExample screenshots:\r\n\r\n(when moving epics without their children issues)\r\n !screenshot-1.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\n(when moving children issues without their epic(s))\r\n !screenshot-2.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nWe are closing this ticket as resolved.

But, you'll lose the relationship between your epics and their child issues. The child issues themselves will sill exist, but the links between them won't.\r\n{quote}\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nThe process to convert between these projects should be able to maintain that relationship between epic and issues in that epic.\r\nh3.

Method 1\r\nWhen navigating in the backlog, you can click on an issue to open its detail view, which will show its fields, as well as its sub-tasks.\r\n\r\nWhen you click on a sub-task, it will open the sub-task, its detail view will open replacing the parent view.\r\n\r\nBut, if you click on the description of the sub-task, and navigate a little between the content before the whole content has been loaded into the screen, the following will happen:\r\n* The sub-task's key in the breadcrumb will be replaced by the parent key:\r\n !Screen Shot 2019-12-04 at 11.34.45.png|thumbnail! \r\n* If you save the description, the parent issue will inherit that content, losing its own.\r\n\r\nh5. Steps to Reproduce\r\n* Click on an issue that has sub-tasks in the backlog;\r\n* Click on the sub-task;\r\n* Before the content of the description/page is fully loaded, click on the description field of the sub-task, and start navigating on it.\r\n\r\nh5.

Actual Results\r\n\r\nThe key of the sub-task is changed in the breadcrumb, and saving its description will send that content to the parent issue.\r\n\r\n*Observations:* \r\n* It is easier to replicate if your environment is slow, or if the description has a huge amount of content to be loaded (e.g. images).

Method 2\r\nWhen opening an issue on the board, if you open an issue in the modal view, then opening the child issue from there, you can also reproduce the same behavior.\r\n\r\nh5. Steps to Reproduce\r\n* Click on an issue that has sub-tasks and open the parent issue on the board;\r\n* Click on one of the sub-tasks;\r\n* Write the description with text and a bullet-point list;\r\n* Scroll up and down in the issue screen;\r\n* Click in the description field to edit\r\nVideo: https://share.getcloudapp.com/d5uee12L\r\n\r\nh5.

Method 3\r\nWhen opening an issue on the board, if you open an issue in the modal view, then opening the child issue from there, and switching tabs in the browser can also cause this behavior.\r\n\r\nh5. Steps to Reproduce\r\n* Open two tabs in the browser, one being Jira, and the other can be any other page;\r\n* In Jira, click on an issue that has sub-tasks and open the parent issue on the board;\r\n* Click on one of the sub-tasks;\r\n* Write some text in the description;\r\n* Switch to the other tab, and return to Jira;\r\nVideo: https://share.getcloudapp.com/12uDD4Ee\r\n\r\nh5. Expected Results\r\n\r\nSame as of method 1 and 2.\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nFor method 1, you can avoid that problem by waiting for the page to fully load.\r\nFor method 2, there isn't any feasible workaround.\r\nFor method 3, you can avoid it by not switching tabs while editing the sub-task description.",

      "description": "h3. Issue Summary\r\n\r\nHi Team,\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nI have noticed an interesting behaviour I would like to report. I have created a next get jira board (main) that pulls the issues from multiple projects. What I have noticed is that if the issues have a Epic associated with it, it does not appear in the main project boards backlog. But If I remove the Epic, it appears in the backlog.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nMy main board: [https://hello.atlassian.net/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=3848&view=planning&selectedIssue=CSC-11]\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nQuerry: project in (PUR, A1C, CSC, MARVIN) AND resolution is EMPTY AND \"Commerce Teams\" = \"High Touch\" OR labels = HighTouch ORDER BY priority DESC, cf[17980] ASC\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nIn the CSC Projects which the main board pulls from, the issues have Epics associated with it. When I take out the Epic from for example, [https://hello.atlassian.net/browse/CSC-11], it appears in the backlog. But other issues which appear from the results of the query are not shown in the backlog, for example, [https://hello.atlassian.net/browse/CSC-12], as they have an Epic associated with it.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nWhat would be the best way to report this behaviour? Or has this been reported before?\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Go to the Filter query on this board\u00a0[https://hello.atlassian.net/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=3848&view=planning&selectedIssue=CSC-11]\r\n # Step 2: Notice that stories for CSC are appearing in the query, eg.g CSC-12\r\n # Go to the Backlog view on the project. Notice that the CSC-12 is not appearing on the backlog. This is because it still has an epic assciated with it on project board:\u00a0[https://hello.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/CSC/boards/3837]\r\n # Notice on the Backlog that CSC-11 is appearing on the backlog. This because it has not Epic associated with it on project\u00a0[https://hello.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/CSC/boards/3837]\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nThe issues types that appear in the Filter query should appear on the Backlog of the project\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nThe backlog does not have all the issues that appear in the Filter query\u00a0\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nCurrent work around is I take the Epics of the issue types I want to appear on the board\r\n\r\n\u00a0",
