For future releases we plan around epic-level estimation (the teams provide t-shirt sizes, which we convert to story points). The teams also aim to break the next two sprints-worth (4 weeks) of epics into user stories, each of which they then estimate. Occasionally plans change and these broken-down epics are pushed back to a later sprint. We therefore have a mix of estimated and unestimated epics and user stories on our product backlogs at any given time.\r\n\r\nWhen planning the roadmap using Portfolio, the current epic points summation behaviour (i.e. epic-level points + \u03a3(user story points)) means that the size of epics appears to increase as they are broken down into user stories. The only way to avoid this would be to delete the epic-level estimate once all its child user stories have been created and estimated. However, planning often happens mid-way through the break-down process, so this isn't very practical.\r\n\r\nI would like a solution that takes account of our refinement process without requiring manual intervention in Portfolio to \"massage\" the figures. Hence my suggestion of: MAX(epic-level points, \u03a3(user story points))",

Problem Definition\nCurrently we are have dependencies when the completion of Epic/Story it would start the other Epic/Story however we do not have a delay configuration for it, example:\n{quote}\nWe are planning a project, where we order from a 3rd party supplier (for example) an internet connection. We know from this point where we order the internet-connection till that one getting delivered it will take around 1 week. In this time-frame we don't need to reserve any resources or something, because we just need simply to wait. \n\nFor this I would like to say, that between these 2 stories in portfolio:  \n- \"Order an Internet-connection\" and \n- \"Delivery and testing of an Internet-Connection\"\nI want to put dependencies where I say that \"Delivery and testing of an Internet-Connection\" can only start when \"Order an Internet-connection\" has been finished 7 days ago. \n\nThis not only work for \"Internet connection\", could also be that we need to order any other 3rd party support. \n{quote}\n\nh3. Suggested Solution\nMaybe we can have a configuration to set the delay such as number of days before the start of another Epic/Story.\n",

The portfolio could still forecast capacities based on team member hours and skills.  \n\nIn the classic portfolio, I was able to accomplish this by creating a fake team member with the same number of hours available as the real team members combined.  I would then assign the \"unassigned\" user to all epics and stories that were still in the planning process.  I was effectively doubling my teams capacity in the eyes of Portfolio, so for the trick to work, I had to make sure to assign all issues manually to team members (real or unassigned) so I could maintain control over capacity.\n\nI would like to have the ability to manage my capacities, while not yet being certain which developers would do the work.  My biggest headache is having portfolio assign team members to issues, having my updates and improvements on those issues slam their dashboards and emails, and knowing that the issue may not actually be assigned to them.\n\n\n",

Problem\n\nJIRA Portfolio allows very fine-grained configuration and setup of plans, making sure that customers can adapt the tool to their complex planning requirements. However, this complexity leaves room for errors and often times it is difficult to figure out what may have been misconfigured.\n\nAs an example, there are a number of possible causes why a certain issue or issues do not show up in the plan. [This Atlassian Answers thread|https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/38390402/issues-not-showing-up-in-portfolio-live-plans] lists a number of them.\nh4. Suggestion\n\nFollowing the success of the [JIRA Admin Helper|https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiraserver071/jira-admin-helper-802593078.html], it would be very helpful to have a {{JIRA Portfolio Helper}} that could be used to determine the answers for the questions like (but not limited to):\n * Why does _X issue_ not show up in my Portfolio plan?\n * Why is my release _red_? (Suggestions on possible solutions)\n * What else would fit in this release with fixed release date?\n * Why does my capacity report show bottleneck?\n * What changes I need to make to my existing projects _X_ and _Y_ in order to see them on the same plan? (suggest on missing releases/fix versions, large delta between\u00a0teams' velocity, incompatible capacity measures)\n\n\u00a0\n\nThrough this feature, customers could self-help and adjust issue sources accordingly, determine the logic behind specific scheduling \"decisions\" by the algorithm.",
