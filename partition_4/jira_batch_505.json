Issue Summary\r\nWhen you have more than one next-gen project with field types dropdown/checkbox with the same name, the values cannot be different, otherwise Jira will thrown an error saying that the value X doesn't exist for that fields when using JQL on queues and SLA goals. E.g. Project A has the field Urgency with options 1/2 and project B has the field Urgency, but with values 4/5, when trying to create a queue with JQL Urgency = 1 on project A, Jira will thrown the following error \"The option '1' for field 'Urgency' does not exist\", even if the value 1 exists for the field Urgency on project A.\r\n !Screen Shot 2020-06-23 at 16.22.24.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\nh3.

Notes\r\nThis problem just happens to the field types dropdown and checkbox, which are the types that can have options.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n- Use different names for the fields;\r\n- Use the same values for the fields;\r\n- It is also possible to use the custom field id instead of the name.

Issue Summary\r\nWhen an issue is created on our SD project, if there is a Confluence space linked as a knowledge base, some suggested articles get mentioned in the issue. \r\nWith the article list, JIRA also grants you an option to create a new article based on a template. \r\nHowever, when the *Troubleshooting* template is disabled on Confluence, JIRA doesn't care about it and allows you to choose this template to create your page.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\nFirst of all, make sure to have Confluence space linked as a knowledge base on your JIRA SD project.\r\n*On Confluence*:\r\n# Create a page on Confluence called *ZZ Top rules* on your knowledge base space;\r\n# On this space, go to *Space Settings > Content Tools > Templates*;\r\n# Find the *Troubleshoot* template and disable it.\r\n\r\n*On JIRA*:\r\n# Go to your SD project and create an issue with a summary and description *ZZ Top rules* too;\r\n# The Confluence article should be suggested at the issue's sidebar - place your mouse cursor there and click over the arrow;\r\n# Click over the *+* button;\r\n# In the *Template* option, click to get the template you want.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nThe *Troubleshooting* template shouldn't be shown there, as it is disabled for that space.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nThe *Troubleshooting* template is shown.\r\n\r\n*Notes*:\r\n* it doesn't matter if you disable the template in the Global Templates or directly in the space, the template will be shown anyway.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\nCurrently there is no known workaround for this behavior. A workaround will be added here when available",
