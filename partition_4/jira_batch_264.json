This is confusing for users.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nRuchi",

(For example, via the \"Edit in JIRA\" action or the link with tooltip \"View this issue in JIRA\".)\r\n\r\nThere used to be an easy, single-click, obvious mechanism to exit the detail view, and return back to the prior context -- via a close button in an easy-to-find corner. No thinking was required.\r\n\r\nIn 4.4.1, that obvious, single-click mechanism for exiting the detail view seems to have been lost.\r\n\r\nWorkarounds:\r\n\r\n* Use the browser back button to step back until finding the planning or task board.\r\n* Find the \"Agile\" tab in the middle top, click it. This sends you back to the same board but the first page. Navigate back to the original page.\r\n* Find \"More Actions\" button in the vast middle, click it, look for \"Planning Board\" or \"Task Board, think about which one we were at before, click it.\r\n\r\nAm I missing something? Is there a setting to open the detail view in the old dialog-like manner?\r\n\r\n(By the way, I realize JIRA and GreenHopper began as separate products. However, it seems like integration should improve over time.)\r\n",

As a project manager or lead, it is useful to be able to easily see what work is assigned to who.\r\n\r\nInstead of a simple button, the user would be presented with a dropdown list or a text field.\r\n\r\nSwimlanes could be used for this, but I want to use swimlanes for other purposes while filtering by assignee.\r\n\r\nMore generally, it would be useful to be able to define quick filters with a variable parameter. That would solve this case and probably others.\r\n\r\n{panel:title=Please Note}\r\nThis issue refers specifically to having a select style quick filter where the options are a list of existing values, in this case the assignee\r\n\r\nThis issue is minor because most teams can achieve the same outcome today by using creating JQL quickfilters of the form \"assignee = <username>\"\r\n{panel}",
