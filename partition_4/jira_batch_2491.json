Every time I update an issue and return to the list, I&#x27;m constantly returned to the default filter of All, ordered by the Updated column and on page 1 of the results. In reality I *always* want to be on the Open filter and ordered by the Priority column, and so find myself constantly changing these 2 things all day long!\n\nPerhaps a default filter and default ordering column could be chosen as a preference in settings, or remembered in the database and refered to after identifying the logged-in user and session from the session cookie?\n\nThank you.",

I&#x27;d like to see the same for commits as well. Let me explain.\n\nMy team generally uses feature/issue branches and pull requests but for certain projects what team members do is so interconnected (because of the project being in its infancy, with many changes building the foundation) that it&#x27;s not practical to develop in separate branches (hence it would basically need that everybody frequently merges from everybody else&#x27;s branches to keep up to date with others&#x27; changes). Thus we review single commits and comment on them.\n\nIn our workflow once all feedback is covered that was given on a commit (in a later commit), that commit is approved. This works OK but of course has the same issues that are solved with PR tasks. Thus it would be great to also be able to build such a check list for commits as well.",
