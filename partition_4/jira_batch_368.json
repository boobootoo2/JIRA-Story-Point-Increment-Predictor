Actual Results\nDoes not include Cycle Time for status transitioning to itself ( In Progress -> In Progress )\n* !loop1.png|thumbnail!\n \nh3. Notes\nThis is actually an expected behavior according to the [Control Chart|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/AGILE/Viewing+the+Control+Chart] documentation :\n{quote}\nFor example, if you are using the JIRA Software Development workflow, you may consider work to have started on an issue when it transitions to 'In Progress' and work to have completed when it transitions out of 'In Review' (to 'Done'). You would show this on the Control Chart by selecting 'In Progress' and 'In Review' as the Columns, as that would show the time that issues have spent in those two statuses.\n\nTip 3: Exclude current work\nThe Control Chart shows data for issues that have been in a selected column but are no longer in a selected column. This gives the cycle time (total elapsed time) for the issues. However, by default this will include issues which are still moving across the board.\nTo view the data for completed work only in your Control Chart, create a Quick Filter with this JQL: status in (Resolved, Closed). Configure your Control Chart to use this Quick Filter.\n{quote}\n\nh3.Workaround\nDo not transition to the same status. Create a dummy status to transition to. \nFor example instead of In Progress -> In Progress , create another status in the workflow called In Progress 2. Then transition In Progress -> In Progress 2.

Then, I received an email from Shafinaz Elahi of Atlassian Support saying that I had once again opened it in the wrong place and gave me a link to a different place to open this, the link brought me here.  I hope this is the right place for this this time: \n\nThis is for \"Quick\nSubtasks for Jira\" plugin. \n\nWe have 6 types of Sub tasks in our jira instance. In the Quick Subtasks plugin, it is documented that you can set the issuetype for a task by appending \"/ issuetype:\"Bugfix Subtask\". But, when you go to add multiple subtasks, the dialog box has an issuetype drop-down\nand can only be set to one value. If the issuetype is set by appending it to the text, the drop-down value always overrides it.\n\nThis causes the user to have to separately add their subtasks based on the issuetype instead of being able to add all of them in one go regardless of issuetype. Is this the intended functionality and the documentation is wrong, or is this a bug? It would be very beneficial if specifying the issuetype would override the drop-down value.\n\nThanks!\n\nMary =)",

I could have issues assigned to me in either sprint, both of which run in parallel at the same time.\n\nI built a filter for \"Issues assigned to me\" which I use in one of the gadgets on my dashboard. It looks like this:\n\nassignee = currentUser() AND issuetype != Epic AND sprint in openSprints() AND resolution = Unresolved ORDER BY updatedDate DESC\n\nHowever, for each of my projects, it only returns issues that are in the first parallel sprint, but not in the second. Instead of  \"AND sprint in openSprints()\" I tried using \"AND sprint ~ JMP\" as well as \"AND sprint = JMP*\", but neither one works.\n\nIs the first mentioned problem a known bug?\n\nThanks,\nMartin",
