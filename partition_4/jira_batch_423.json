Issue Summary\r\n\r\nMake it obvious that 'Object Schema Users permissions for JSM customers' need to be enabled for Insight CF on CP create request form to be usable to customers.\r\n\r\nThis is not really a bug because by enabling the 'Object Schema Users permissions for JSM customers' option, customers will no longer be blocked. However, due to the non-obviousness of this option to project admins/schema admins, they might miss it and leading to the following symptom. And that non-obviousness is a problem that should be addressed.\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Create an Insight custom field and add it as a 'required' field to a JSM request type\r\n # Sign in as a user who is not an 'Object schema user' of the Insight object schema of which the custom field was related to\r\n # Try to create a request (of that specific request type) using the 'Create request' page on CP\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nUser should not be blocked from creating the request.\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nUser is blocked from creating the request due to them not having access to the object schema, thus unable to add a value to the 'required' custom field.\r\n\r\n!cp-form-with-insight-custom-field.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\n!browse-insight-objects-dialog-without-any-selectable-item.png|thumbnail!\r\nh3.

Workaround\r\n* Use a browser other than Safari, as it seems like this is the only affected browser, or;\r\n* In Confluence, edit the tables to change them from *Responsive* to *Fixed Width,* or;\r\n* The issue does not seem to occur in Jira Service Management 8.19.1, so upgrading to this version or above might also be an option.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
