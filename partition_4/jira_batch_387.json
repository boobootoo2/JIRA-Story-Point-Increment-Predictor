      "description": "Original summary: GreenHopper misuses the concepts of \"epics\" and \"themes\"\n--\n\nAn _epic_ is a placeholder for a collection of user stories that will eventually be defined (this has to happen before they're added to a sprint). Epics can be prioritized in the Product Backlog, along with all the other Product Backlog Items.\n\nA _theme_ is a coherent set of user stories -- Often the resulting user stories from an epic. You can't prioritize a theme per se, because its Product Backlog Items may not necessarily be in a consecutive order.\n\nGreenHopper is mixing the two concepts, leading to the following issues:\n# You can't prioritize an epic (the issue type) in the Product Backlog. They don't even show up in the Product Backlog.\n# The \"epic\" functionality is in some aspects confusing and cumbersome, because it mainly deals with themes, while also assuming that epic = theme. One consequence is having a redundant \"Epic Status\" field that users must somehow keep in sync with the \"Status\" field. \n# You get a separate pseudo backlog for \"epics\", which allows you to prioritize them. This doesn't mean anything in Scrum.\n\nOlder versions of JIRA/GreenHopper used to get these two things right, albeit with an interface that wasn't as helpful as the new Rapid Boards: Themes were a type of label and epics could be prioritized.",

      "description": "The following statement was made by a user comprehensively. Hence, I decide to put everything here so that the devs will have a look into it:\n\n{quote}\n I am really sorry I updated GreenHopper this time because I think Atlassian made a couple of really horrible UI changes. Amongst others:\n* The version and epic panels are panels which are opened and closed many times during grooming and planning - even in the day to day work of a PO or SM.\n** Electing to remove the button when it is pressed is bad enough but forcing users to then search *different* places on the screen (depending on the browser window size) to close them again is really really bad.\n** Placing the close 'X' right next to the \"create\" label is just a consequence of this bad design.\n** Why is there no keyboard shortcuts for these panels implemented at least? Question: How do I get keyboard shortcuts for this?\n** In general having to hover the mouse pointer in various places on the screen to get an insight of what the possibilities are is considered bad UI design by many. Try hovering on a tablet?? See also [http://ui-patterns.com/blog/User-Interface-AntiPatterns] about anti-patterns.\n\nWhat do I want:\n* I want to have the buttons that *filter* my issues act the same. They should all act like the quick filters which do not disappear. That would be consistent and useful.\n* I want to have keyboard shortcuts for these two important panels (and thanks for doing those in the first place btw.). ('p' and 'v' could be candidates)\n\nIt is evident that you are trying to make things look nice on a tablet - that is fine. But is is happening at the expense of where the tool is most often used: a browser on a PC with a proper keyboard and mouse. Please stop making things worse in the UI department.\n\nPlease see this as an opportunity to improve (fix UI mistakes) rather than a negative request to be ignored/archived. I have 100 users and we are working on scaling up to 500 on multiple sites so this is of some importance to my organisation that the UI is fast and usable.\n{quote}\n\nPerhaps someone can shed some light on the suggestions that the user has?",

All issues are required by our process to have subtasks so the actual planning order is respected despite the swimlanes.

So we would like to have such issue on top of the board instead of the bottom no matter whether they have subtasks or not. Optimally, we would have special swimlanes for such issues.\n\nSolution idea:\nAllow at least one JQL query that overrides the swimlane setting that will still be used for all non-matching issues.

We use Epics for the hierarchy, and Stories are only used at the bottom. After we have our WBS, we do the sprint planning. To do the sprint planning based on the WBS, I need the Structure to be integrated with GreenHopper. Today, there is a mini Structure window in the right hand-side panel, and it shows the hierarchical Structure path to the issue highlighted on the rapid board. Instead of this, I need to see the entire Structure on one side of the screen (left), and the rapid board in planning mode on the other side (right). I want to be able to drag items from the Structure and drop them in a sprint on the rapid board in sprint planning mode.\n\nNext, I will need the issues in the Structure to be visually annotated with the Sprint number they have been dragged into.

Admins can modify the workflow through JIRA, which will put it into a state that means Agile can no longer use it. However, Agile can still offer to simplify the workflow. This can result in confusion and also generates errors when trying to simplify it.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n# Create a project. Eg: TEST\r\n# Create multiple issues in project TEST\r\n# Create a board for this project and then change the workflow to Simplified Workflow Scheme in Agile\r\n# Edit the workflow \"Simplified Workflow Scheme\" for project TEST.\r\n# Edit the Draft and publish it. Eg: add new statuses and transition then, it appears as if the project TEST is not using Simplified Workflow Scheme in Agile\r\n# Go to the board again.\r\n# Click on the Simplified Workflow.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nThe workflow can be simplified, or it lists 'Agile Simplified Workflow unavailable'.\r\n\r\nh3.
