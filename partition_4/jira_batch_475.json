Problem Definition\r\nAt the moment, only comments made in the Customer Portal view are recognised as coming from the customer. This means, for example, that automation rules can only be triggered from there.\r\n\r\nThe Reporter may have access to the same issue in base JIRA view (if they have Collaborator permissions), but at an attempt to comment there, they'll see a warning:\r\n{quote}Your comment will only be visible to agents and collaborators{quote}  \r\n\r\n\r\n- This is in accordance with the Service Desk logic, but can be confusing: users wouldn't expect completely different behaviour when accessing the same ticket in two different parts of the application.\r\n- Teams that work with internal requesters don't always want to use the Customer Portal. For users that are used to JIRA views, this adds additional overhead of having navigate to Customer Portal in order to add a comment.\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\nIn the JIRA view, reporters should have an option to add a comment as a Service Desk customer.",

This can lead to confusion for service desk portal customers, as they might believe that they are able to log in using google credentials (which only service desk agents can use that option), and that will not work.\r\n\r\nh3.

You only need to create one status for each unique \"newvalue\"\r\n# Create the status in the JIRA Administration page\r\n# After creating the status, hover over the edit link for the new status to obtain the URL for this link. Copy down the ID that appears at the end of this URL.\r\n# Shut down JIRA\r\n# Update the issuestatus table so that the newly created status has the ID of the deleted status. \r\n** Run the following query. Replace the first ID with the ID you obtained from the URL when you added the status. Replace the second ID with the missing status ID that you obtained in the first SQL query.\r\n{noformat}\r\nUPDATE issuestatus SET id='10200' WHERE id='10610';\r\n{noformat}\r\n# Start JIRA",

However, my clients are independent companies and as such each want a quarterly SLA report based on how we did for their own issues. e.g. 45 clients whose metrics would fall into the SLA specs, while 5 having SLA violations that quarter.\r\n\r\nFor this I would need a way of easily grouping the individual customer-accounts into clients, so I could introduce a JQL for each of the reports filtering on the client (reporter in membersOf(\"client\"). Or a grouping on emaildomains could also fit the bill (reporter_email in (\"@client.com\", \"@client.co.uk\", \"@client.net\"))\r\n\r\nOur users are typically entered by ourselves (no self-registration).\r\n\r\nApparently users-groups have been switched off for SD customers as this did not match the licensing policy.",

Workaround\r\n*JIRA Cloud*\r\nThis doesn't seem to happen to every user, but you can still get to User admin even though there is a redirect loop by going to <instance>/admin.  Add the user to the Service Desk Agents group, and go back to JIRA.  The pages should load, now.  You can then remove the user from the Service Desk Agents group.\r\n\r\n*JIRA Server*\r\nApparently, this bug only affects users during their first login. \r\nIf this problem is affecting all users (including the JIRA System Administrator), follow the steps below:\r\n# Stop JIRA.\r\n# Remove the JIRA Service Desk OBR plugin file from the {{$JIRA_HOME/plugins/installed-plugins}} folder.\r\n# Start JIRA.\r\n# Login to JIRA and install the JIRA Service Desk plugin again.\r\n\r\nIf an administrator already has access to the instance, follow the steps below:\r\n# Login as a JIRA System Administrator.\r\n# Go to *Cog Icon > Add-ons > JIRA Service Desk*.\r\n# Expand the list of modules (e.g. * 244 of 244 modules enabled*).\r\n# Find the *sdOnboardingFlow* module and click on *Disable*.",

      "description": "{panel:bgColor=#e7f4fa}\n  *NOTE:* This suggestion is for *JIRA Service Desk Server*. Using *JIRA Service Desk Cloud*? [See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSDCLOUD-1855].\n  {panel}\n\nA customer needing support is often a member of a larger team, all of who need to be kept informed regarding progress of an issue. This could be supported by:\r\n\r\n* Maintaining a record of all email addresses which were on cc when the issue was created by an incoming email (from the known customer contact who has an account)\r\n* Any that already have accounts can be added as watchers, the remaining ones are recorded in the database.\r\n* If subsequent incoming emails on that issue have additional addresses added, the system notices this and adds them to the cc list\r\n* The Service Desk admin can see and edit the cc list to e.g. remove unwanted addresses.\r\n\r\nThis will work well for the customer, who is then able to use Outlook as their main method of communication with both the internal team and the external subcontractor.\r\n\r\nIt also avoids unnecessary work adding loads of extra registered users when they really just wanted to be on a cc list, or maintaining email aliases.\r\n\r\nI believe I am seeing requests that would be covered by this functionality in both https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSD-1593 and https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSD-960.\r\n\r\nIt looks like pretty simple functionality to me, so I hope it can soon be included.",

Also, some users create ServiceDesk mail handlers in JIRA core side which can cause issues.\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\nWe need to have all mail handlers including Service Desk in one page to have better view of incoming mail handlers.\r\nOtherwise to check for Service Desk mail handlers we need to check every Service Desk project Email Setting separately which makes troubleshooting difficult.\r\nHowever, since Service Desk mail handler is independent from JIRA core, it is good to JUST show the mail handler at Incoming Mail page, but user won't be able to edit SD mail handler or CREATE Service Desk mail handler which makes duplication and leave it as read only.",

This will let you use different channels for different request types, or just have more personalised email addresses for your customers.\r\n\r\nPlease refer to [this document|https://confluence.atlassian.com/jiracore/adding-multiple-email-channels-for-creating-requests-1063178702.html] for details on how to enable and setup this feature. We would also love your feedback, which you can share via [this survey|https://forms.gle/yiLzhsWEJm7Ks6Mq6].\r\n\r\nWe look forward to hearing how you go with the beta version of multiple email channel support for JSM!\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\n\r\nCharlie Marriott\r\n\r\nJira Service Management, Server & Data Center\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\nh3. Problem Definition\r\nCurrently, JIRA Service Desk supports only a single e-mail account and consequently a single Request Type to be created via e-mail (see [Setting up the email channel|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/SERVICEDESK/Setting+up+the+email+channel]).\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n* It would be great to support multiple e-mail accounts for a single service desk so that each account can be configured for a different request type.\r\n* Or maybe JIRA Mail Handler can identify email subject and set a different request type for the ticket upon creation.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround \r\nThere is currently no workaround for using multiple request types for the e-mail channel.",
