With this capability, you can order your epics by dragging and dropping epics around in the panel. The same order will be reflected in your roadmap and board.\r\n\r\nTo learn more and/or provide feedback about the epic panel, read [our community post here.|https://community.atlassian.com/t5/Next-gen-articles/Improved-Backlog-planning-in-next-gen-with-the-epic-panel/ba-p/1387675]\r\n\r\nThank you, \r\nEmily Chan\r\nProduct Manager, Atlassian.\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\nUsers should be able to sort the epic in the next-gen project.\r\nWhen the users have a long list of epic, it is difficult to scroll and find the required epic one by one.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nAlso a feature to be able to drag and drop the Epic fields would be helpful",

Summary\r\n\r\nJira Software Cloud users would like the ability to create *multiple boards* for each *team-managed* (formerly next-gen) project, just as they can with company-managed (formerly Classic) projects.\r\n\r\n*Workarounds:*\r\n # Use \u201cdummy\u201d inactive sprint containers in the team-managed backlog as placeholders for different types of work like \u201cdesign\u201d, \u201cQA\u201d, \u201ceng health\u201d and \u201cfeature work\u201d. Pull issues into active sprint container representing the board when the work is prioritised and ready for sprint.\r\n # Use different team-managed projects to represent different types of work, if the workstreams are totally distinct and separate, and doesn't require any form of \"syncing\".\r\n # Use company-managed projects (but you will have to deal with project schemes for project setups).\r\n\r\n{panel:title=Atlassian status as of May 2021|borderStyle=solid|borderColor=#b2d4ff|titleBGColor=#b2d4ff|bgColor=#eaf1fc}\r\nHi all,\r\n\r\nWe are kicking off the *product discovery phase* for *multiple boards per project* in the next few weeks.\r\n\r\nFrom the product perspective, our main focus right now is to enable the ability to *create multiple boards +within one team-managed project+*, which will be tracked on this Jira feature suggestion.\r\n\r\nFor example, this capability will enable teams to have separate boards representing functional/design vs. development sprints, Scrum vs. Kanban agile methodologies, feature work vs. bugs, web app vs. mobile.\r\n\r\nIf you want to help us understand the problem space better, please help us [answer this 3-minutes survey|https://forms.gle/PNUyCDXXf2PmRuva6].\r\n\r\nAs we continue our progress on this feature, we\u2019ll provide further updates. We\u2019ll also be reaching out to customers, as we refine our solution to ensure that we are addressing customer pain points.\r\n\r\nIn the short-term, when you need to have multiple boards in a single project, we recommend teams to use company-managed projects. We apologise for the inconvenience that this may cause you.\r\n\r\n*+Note:+*\r\n We\u2019ve gone through all the feedback specified in this Jira ticket and identified feedback which represent separate feature suggestions. You can vote for these other feature suggestions below:\r\n # *Cross-project roadmaps and boards:* Pull in epics or issues from other projects to display on your roadmap or board, in order to enable cross-team visibility for planning and tracking work:\r\n ** Cross-project roadmap:\u00a0\u00a0https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSWCLOUD-20703\r\n ** Cross-project board:\u00a0https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSWCLOUD-17444\r\n # *Multiple active sprints:* Manage 2 concurrent active sprints in the same backlog:\r\n ** https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSWCLOUD-17195\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n Ivan Teong\r\n Product Manager, Jira Software\r\n{panel}",

Enabling you to customise the fields you see on the cards in the Board and Backlog is something that will be available in team-managed projects, although it is not something that we will be focusing on in the next 6 months. We want to share this with you to ensure you can plan out your use of projects within Jira Software effectively.\r\n\r\nIn the short term, we recommend teams use company-managed projects when you need to customise your card layout. We apologise for the inconvenience this may cause you.\r\n\r\nPlease continue to vote and in particular please continue to add comments on how your teams find value when customising card layout. This contextual information of what you are doing and why you are doing is invaluable for us in providing you with a product that will satisfy your needs.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nMark Z\r\n Product Manager\r\n{panel}\r\nh3. Problem Definition\r\n\r\nAs a project admin, I want to be able to customise the fields shown on the card in the backlog and on the board for next-gen projects.\r\n\r\nAs of today, it is *only possible to show the due date, the priority field, and the estimation field*\u00a0when they are configured on an issue type.\r\n\r\nIf you are looking for the ticket related to card colour support, you can watch and vote on this ticket.",

We appreciate the huge amount of feedback, not just from customers who came directly to this ticket themselves, but also from customers who reached out to our support teams with questions or problems and were then directed to this ticket.\r\n\r\n\u201cBoard settings\u201d is a very broad problem to solve because, by itself, it doesn\u2019t tell us what exactly customers are trying to configure. Hence, we have read through all the comments here and from tickets raised through our support team. We\u2019ve found that there are several different, specific settings that customers would like to configure, but they have been all broadly amalgamated into the term \u201cboard settings\u201d. The settings that have been specifically requested from the comments are:\r\n * the ability to define working days in a project: JSWCLOUD-17773\r\n * the ability to find out how many days a card has been in a column: JSWCLOUD-20809\r\n * the ability to use colours to quickly identify cards: JSWCLOUD-17277\r\n * the ability to choose which labels appear on cards in the board/backlog: JSWCLOUD-17450\r\n * the ability to choose which fields appear on cards in the board/backlog: JSWCLOUD-17336\r\n * the ability to create Components in next-gen projects: JSWCLOUD-17601\r\n * the ability to have multiple boards in a next-gen project: JSWCLOUD-17371\r\n * the ability to have a board with issues from multiple projects (including issues from next-gen projects): JSWCLOUD-17444\r\n * the ability to create templates to be used when creating next-gen projects: JSWCLOUD-17982\r\n * the ability to create a new status without creating a column (coming really soon!):\u00a0JSWCLOUD-17434\r\n * the ability to set limits on the number of issues in a column (you can do this now)\r\n\r\nEach of these settings, except the last one, have an existing ticket associated with it. Kindly vote/watch/comment the specific settings that are relevant to you. If you feel the settings you are looking for aren\u2019t listed above, kindly tell us about it. Meanwhile, we will close this ticket.\r\n\r\nAgain, thank you for your feedback and patience.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n Emily Chan\r\n Atlassian.\r\n{panel}\r\nCurrently, due to the restrictions next-gen projects has, we can't change Working days, card colors, layout, columns issue limits, for example.\r\n It would be good if we could have the option to change these simple settings on next-gen projects.",
