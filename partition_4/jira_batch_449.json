This problem occurred due to the unbounded nature of threads before 4.4.0, which resulted in a high DB load on the instance.\r\n\r\nHowever - we have identified two other issues with the JSM async processing logic which we need to resolve, related to the problems reported in this bug ticket. These issues are tracked in their respective tickets -\r\n\r\n1. JSDSERVER-5730\r\n - This is related to deadlocking of threads when there are frequent actions on one request. A fix for this is released behind a dark feature in 4.9.0\r\n - The development team will be working on enabling this by default in future. More details on the fix -\r\n [https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirakb/deadlocking-in-jira-service-desk-when-frequently-updating-the-same-issue-979428323.html]\r\n\r\n2. JSDSERVER-8635\r\n - This is related to threads deadlocking when processing for one issue takes over 5 minutes. This ticket is currently gathering impact.\r\n\r\nPlease let us know if you have any further concerns with the above, please open a support ticket via [https://support.atlassian.com|https://support.atlassian.com/]\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nAlex\r\n{panel}\r\nh1. Description\u00a0\r\n\r\nJSD 3.9.0 attempts to address some of the friction between the SLA system and automation (JSDSERVER-4743) and poor issue creation performance by introducing a wrapper event type (inspired by [OnCommitEvent|https://docs.atlassian.com/software/jira/docs/api/7.6.0/com/atlassian/jira/event/commit/OnCommitEvent.html]) and an \u201cexpectation\u201d system.\r\n\r\nThe expectation system gives features that are interested in one or more eligible event types a way to explicitly define the work that should be done _before_ a wrapped event is dispatched, by submitting \u201cjobs\u201d that are executed in the strict cluster-wide order of their submission (no more than one job at a time for each issue) using a thread pool to avoid blocking any request threads (though we just use the submitting thread if it\u2019s not a request thread).\r\n\r\nThe wrapper event type does the same for the work that should be done _after_ what we refer to as \u201ccompletion\u201d, by defining [@EventListener|https://docs.atlassian.com/atlassian-event/3.1.3/apidocs/com/atlassian/event/api/EventListener.html] methods of type {{public void(ServiceDeskWrappedOnCompletionEvent)}}.\r\n\r\nAt least two recent support cases have involved severe performance degradation of a node in and/or the database for an instance that seems to have been caused or exacerbated by the expectation system, so we\u2019ll link potential causes to this issue as we find them.\r\nh1. Diagnosis\r\n * High CPU usage on DB server\r\n * Increased number of threads used by the Jira process\r\n * High number of SdOffThreadEventJobRunner threads on thread dumps connecting to the database\r\n\r\nh1. Possible workaround (JSD 3.9+)\r\n\r\nThese steps affect the expectation system such that jobs are always executed immediately on the submitting thread, without touching any OffThreadEventJobRunner or PSMQ code paths, as if the submitting threads are never request threads (JSDSERVER-5730).\r\n # Go to the dark feature settings page ({{<baseURL>/secure/SiteDarkFeatures!default.jspa}})\r\n # Remove the feature flag {{sd.internal.base.off.thread.on.completion.events.enabled}}, if it exists\r\n # Add the following feature flag: {{sd.internal.base.off.thread.on.completion.events.disabled}}\r\n # Restart JIRA\r\n\r\nSLA accuracy shouldn\u2019t be negatively affected, but issue creation might take longer as a result. WHEN issue created automation rules with SLA-related JQL should still work (JSDSERVER-4743).",

A workaround for this was released behind a dark feature in 4.9.0\r\n - The development team will be working on a permanent fix shortly.\r\n\r\nFor details on the workaround please see the related documentation -\u00a0\r\n * [https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirakb/deadlocking-in-jira-service-desk-when-frequently-updating-the-same-issue-979428323.html]\r\n\r\nWe hope to resolve this issue as soon as possible!\r\n\r\nIf you have further concerns with the above, please open a support ticket via [https://support.atlassian.com|https://support.atlassian.com/]\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nAlex\r\n{panel}\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe expectation system executes each job on the node that submitted it. When the submitting thread is a request thread, the system generates a unique identifier for each submission, enqueues it on a PSMQ for the issue to which the given event pertains, then the OffThreadEventJobRunner uses an unbounded ThreadPoolExecutor (JSDSERVER-5732) to spawn a thread that\u2019s equipped with that unique identifier.\r\n\r\nEach job execution thread locks the queue on which it expects to see its unique identifier (UPDATE QUEUE), locks the message at the head of the queue expecting that the message contains its unique identifier (BEGIN + UPDATE QUEUE + SELECT MESSAGE + UPDATE MESSAGE + UPDATE QUEUE + COMMIT), dequeues the message (BEGIN + UPDATE QUEUE + DELETE MESSAGE + UPDATE QUEUE + COMMIT), and finally executes the associated work.\r\n\r\nThere are many points at which this process can fail under contention. While most of the failure modes that PSMQ handles with immediate retries up to 10000 ms should be unlikely (fewer messages than readers; next message has expired; message dequeued by other reader between peek and dequeue), there are at least two failure modes that we handle by repeating the process after sleeping for 5 ms (queue locked by other reader; next message doesn\u2019t contain thread\u2019s unique identifier).\r\n\r\nThis approach is obviously inefficient, but I can see how it might be an appropriate choice under an assumption like \u201ccontention for a given queue should only occur rarely and randomly\u201d. That assumption, at the very least, doesn\u2019t seem to hold, given the reports that some bulk issue operation and ScriptRunner usage patterns can easily result in contention, and evidence from our initial investigation that actions as simple as posting a comment almost always result in contention.\r\n\r\nIn the case of posting a comment, the contention occurs because our EventListenerLauncher appears to submit one SLA cycle updater job for [each of the two commit-wrapped events|https://stash.atlassian.com/projects/SDSERVER/repos/servicedesk/browse/plugin/src/main/java/com/atlassian/servicedesk/bootstrap/listener/EventListenerLauncher.java?at=refs%2Ftags%2F3.9.0-REL-0001#155,157,168,170,331,345,371,377] that are [dispatched by JIRA|https://stash.atlassian.com/projects/JIRASERVER/repos/jira/browse/jira-components/jira-core/src/main/java/com/atlassian/jira/event/issue/IssueEventBundleFactoryImpl.java?at=refs%2Ftags%2F7.6.0#115]. The usual outcome is that we spawn two job execution threads in quick succession that contend for the same queue, and one of the threads issues at least ten unsuccessful UPDATE QUEUE queries under ideal conditions (no other activity, local database, empty instance, task management project, and the thread for the first job wins the race).",

Problem Definition\r\n\r\nIssues created from emails attach files such as marketing advertisment images or even text often included in singatures to an issue, which can clutter things for issue asignees in that they might not be able to filter out important attachments or will lose valuable time in manually deleting attached duplicate files from attachments. Additionally, administrators may want to restrict certain files from a source from being attached to new and existing issues.\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nImplement a file and text filter on a global (JIRA administrators) and/or project (Project administrators) levels to exclude selected attachments or text from email content for new issues as well as comments added to existing.\r\n\r\nIn orde to manage files exclusions, there would be a select drop-down options next to each attached file allowing to quickly exclude attached files from further inclusions using a combination its name and checksum for uniqueness.\r\n\r\nSelect drop-down example options:\r\n * 'Exclude' => keeps the original file but prevents further duplicate copies\r\n * 'Remove and exclude' => removes original file and prevents further duplicate copies\r\n\r\nA dedicated filters manager would then allow system admins or project managers to manage such exclusions (similar to lists for blocked users in IMs).\r\nh3.

Workaround\r\n* We can try to make the tables lighter manually. That should help with the audit job finishing in reasonable time.\r\nIf you *do not* use the SLA Audit log feature, you may delete all rows from these tables {{AO_54307E_SLAAUDITLOGDATA}} and {{AO_54307E_SLAAUDITLOG}}.\r\n* We can also make the SLA audit data get cleaned out sooner, preventing it from getting big enough to be problematic by applying the workaround in https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSDSERVER-5871",

Workaround (JSD 3.2+)\r\nh2. Switch the honeypot off\r\n\r\nSwitching the honeypot off will revert your instance to the old behaviour, where a CAPTCHA is imposed on the customer public signup form whenever it\u2019s imposed on the JIRA counterpart.\r\n # Switch the [CAPTCHA on signup|https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiraserver076/configuring-jira-application-options-945111787.html#ConfiguringJIRAapplicationoptions-settingsGeneralsettings] setting on for the instance\r\n # Go to the dark feature settings page ({{<context>/secure/SiteDarkFeatures!default.jspa}})\r\n # Add the following feature flag: {{sd.portal.help.center.customer.signup.secondary.email.disabled}}\r\n\r\nA fix that achieves this will be released with the next version of JSD 3.9 in accordance with our release schedule.\r\nh2. Switch to JIRA\u2019s public signup form\r\n\r\nIf your customers don\u2019t need to be able to raise their first request over email, and you can find a way to tell potential customers to use JIRA\u2019s signup form ({{<context>/secure/Signup!default.jspa}}), such as through the [name and logo of your help center|https://confluence.atlassian.com/servicedeskserver039/configuring-the-customer-portal-942846103.html#Configuringthecustomerportal-brandYourPortalBrandyourportal], you can effectively allow public signup with a CAPTCHA in three steps:\r\n # [Switch customer public signup off for all projects|https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiraserver076/enabling-public-signup-and-captcha-945110981.html#EnablingpublicsignupandCAPTCHA-EnablingpublicsignupforJIRAServiceDesk] in JSD\u2019s global configuration\r\n # On the *Applications* page, click *Set defaults for new users* and clear all of the boxes\r\n # Switch the [CAPTCHA on signup|https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiraserver076/configuring-jira-application-options-945111787.html#ConfiguringJIRAapplicationoptions-settingsGeneralsettings] and [traditional public signup|https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiraserver076/enabling-public-signup-and-captcha-945110981.html#EnablingpublicsignupandCAPTCHA-EnablingpublicsignupforJIRACoreandJIRASoftware] settings on for the instance\r\n\r\nConfiguring your instance not to give new users access to any of the JIRA applications is important, because users that have access to an application will consume a seat for that application (including JIRA Core seats, when access is given to it but no others). *Customers who only need to use the customer portal do not need to be given access to JIRA Service Desk.*\r\nh1. Workaround (JSD 3.10+)\r\n\r\nAffected instances that are on JSD 3.10 or newer can mitigate the attack by [switching the account verification email feature off|https://confluence.atlassian.com/servicedesk/jira-service-desk-3-10-x-release-notes-941610925.html#JIRAServiceDesk3.10.xreleasenotes-verificationAccountverificationnomore] (please note that the setting is only visible when public signup is [switched on at the project level|https://confluence.atlassian.com/servicedeskserver039/managing-access-to-your-service-desk-942846099.html#Managingaccesstoyourservicedesk-Choosewhocanraiserequests]). While this won\u2019t prevent the creation of spam accounts, doing so will no longer be enough to make the instance send mail to the given address.\r\nh1.

Normally, when the request type is missing from an issue in a Service Deks project, no Customer (SD) notifications are sent but, for some reason, adding a participant to the issue will trigger a Customer notification.\r\n\r\nh5. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Create an Issue in a service Desk project, from within Jira (not Customer Portal), and do not set any Request Type.\r\n # Add a participant to the issue created.\r\n\r\nh5. Expected Behavior\r\n * If there is no request type set in the issue, no Customer Notifications are triggered.\r\n\r\nh5. Actual Behavior\r\n * If there is no request type set in the issue, adding a user to the _Participants_ field will trigger customer notifications for this event.\r\n\r\nh5. Cause\r\n * Unknown.\r\n\r\nh5. Workaround\r\n * Do not create issues using the _Create_ button. You can also remove the *Service Desk agents* from the _Create issues_ permission in the Permission scheme of the project, to force them to create issues from the Customer Portal.\r\n * Follow the KB [Automatically set Customer Request Type When Issue is Created via JIRA|https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirakb/automatically-set-customer-request-type-when-issue-is-created-via-jira-859463969.html] to configure Jira to automatically set the request type when missed.\r\n\r\nh5. Notes:\r\n * This behavior can only be provoked from within Jira by Agents as Customers do not see the requests from the customer portal when the issue does not have a request type and once the request type has been set, it cannot be removed.\r\n * This notification leads to other issues, like the one registered in the bug ticket JSDSERVER-4378 JSD not setting requestURL on email notification when request type is empty and the _View request_ link not working: !screenshot-1.png|thumbnail!",

Workaround\r\n\r\nFrom the above articles, it is possible to modify the Windows Registry and increase the {{UrlSegmentMaxLength}} value to handle more characters:\r\n # Backup the Registry\r\n # With Regedit, browse to {{HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\services\\HTTP\\Parameters}}\r\n # Find the value for {{UrlSegmentMaxLength}} (or if it doesn't exist add a DWORD value), and change it to {{00001000}} (this is the hex for 4096)\r\n\r\nPowershell alternative:\r\n{code:java}\r\nSet-ItemProperty -Path HKLM:\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\HTTP\\Parameters -Name UrlSegmentMaxLength -Value 4096\r\n{code}\r\nAfter using either method to adjust the registry (Regedit or Powershell), you must restart Windows for the changes to take effect. This will necessitate downtime, please plan a maintenance window accordingly.",

Notes\r\nBasically what I think is happening is that the string 'Approbation par gestionnaire de modification/\u00e9valuation par les pairs' is too long for the field here (69 characters in length).  I think this is a status name in Jira.  These appear to be limited to a max of 60 characters for both mysql and postgres instances of Jira.   In English I believe this translates to 'Change Manager / Peer Review Approval' (only 37 characters).   It appears that Service Desk is trying to do a literal translation in regards to status values and in this case, that string is too long for French and the constraints of the database itself.\r\n\r\nh3.Workaround\r\n# Uninstall the Service Desk from Jira (Gear Icon -> Applications -> select the uninstall option for Service Desk)\r\n# Change the system language back to English\r\n# Reindexed\r\n# Reinstall JSD - Cog Icon -> Applications -> Try Service Desk link\r\n# In my case I had to restart in order to get JSD to load up properly.\r\n\r\nAt this point I was then able to create this project in Service Desk, however the status will be in English.  While you could convert the system back to French, I do not expect this to change the status names back into a French equivalent.   So this work-around is limited in its scope.",

      "description": "h5. Issue Summary\r\n * When migrating from Cloud to Server, the Request Type icons are different and cause a lot of errors\r\n\r\nh5. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Install Service Desk in Cloud\r\n # Create one or more Service Desk projects.\r\n # Create an XML Backup for Server\r\n # Restore the XML Backup on JIRA Server.\r\n # Go to the SD projects and see the Queues or the Request Types.\r\n\r\nh5. Expected Behavior\r\n * The icons for the request types are shown correctly.\r\n\r\nh5. Actual Behavior\r\n * There are several broken icons: !screenshot-1.png|thumbnail! !screenshot-2.png|thumbnail!\r\n * Each broken icon throws a logging error, flooding the log files pretty quickly with a File not found error:\r\n{code:java}\r\n2018-01-26 14:00:41,130 http-nio-8080-exec-22 ERROR      [c.a.j.web.servlet.InternalServerErrorServlet] {errorId=a375e86d-abab-4188-aa71-b262a5ddd0d2, interpretedMsg=, cause=java.io.IOException: File not found, stacktrace=java.io.IOException: File not found\r\n        at com.atlassian.jira.avatar.AvatarManagerImpl.getAvatarInputStream(AvatarManagerImpl.java:388) [classes/:?]\r\n        at com.atlassian.jira.avatar.AvatarManagerImpl.lambda$processAvatarData$0(AvatarManagerImpl.java:367) [classes/:?]{code}\r\n\r\nh5. Cause\r\n * There are system Request Type icons in Cloud that don't exist in Server (select * from avatar where avatartype = 'SD_REQTYPE') Difference [^Request types Cloud vs server.xlsx]. When an XML backup is generated, the references to the icons and the issues that use them are include in the data. There are about double the icons in Cloud than in Server. Even though the missing icons are considered 'avatars', the request type icons are not included in the 'avatars' directory, possibly because the files are actually inside the *jira-servicedesk-xx.yy.zz.jar* file (at least on Server side), in the directory img/request-type-icons (you can find them extracting the content of the jar file with a compression tool), so when generating the Export file from Cloud, the avatars/icons for the request types are not include din the 'avatars' directory.\r\n\r\nh5. Workaround\r\n * Use this SQL query to determine if any request types are using the incorrect icons:\r\n{code}\r\nSELECT p.pkey AS ProjectKey, p.pname AS ProjectName, vpf.\"NAME\" AS RequestName, a.filename as RequestTypeIcon\r\nFROM \"AO_54307E_VIEWPORTFORM\" vpf\r\nJOIN \"AO_54307E_VIEWPORT\" vp ON vpf.\"VIEWPORT_ID\" = vp.\"ID\"JOIN project p ON vp.\"PROJECT_ID\" = p.id\r\nJOIN avatar a ON vpf.\"ICON_ID\" = a.id\r\nWHERE vpf.\"ICON_ID\" IN (\r\n        SELECT id\r\n        FROM avatar\r\n        WHERE avatartype = 'SD_REQTYPE'\r\n        AND systemavatar = 1\r\n        AND filename LIKE '%-v1.svg'\r\n);\r\n{code}\r\n* If this query returns zero rows, that means the Icons from cloud are not in use. You can remove those queries with the following:\r\n{code}\r\nDELETE FROM avatar\r\nWHERE avatartype = 'SD_REQTYPE'\r\nAND systemavatar = 1\r\nAND filename LIKE '%-v1.svg'\r\n{code}\r\n* After running the query above, you will need to manually insert new icons to the Request Type for it to work again.\r\n\r\n(i) As always, ensure Jira has been shut down and that you have a full database backup before making changes to the database.",

      "description": "The release of JSD 3.10 has caused us considerable pain, especially for Project Configurator but the impact on ScriptRunner has been high too. Many of the classes we depend on changed for this release, and we cannot rely just on API classes because they do not give the functionality they need.\r\n\r\nProject Configurator (PC) is a key part of Atlassian's Data Portability strategy, with PC providing ways to migrate and promote configuration between instances. We currently have three implementations of the JSD integration for PC to support Jira 7.0 to 7.7 and at the current rate we will need to add as much as one per Jira release which will lead to an unmaintainable mess.\r\n\r\nWhat I'd like to do is start a conversation to get the functionality we need into an API with the same kinds of deprecation policies that other Atlassian APIs. If we don't have this then we will need to revisit support for JSD in the Data Portability strategy.\r\n\r\nAt App week we spoke to Lachlan Goodhew-Cook about this and we agreed that it would be a good thing to do. \r\n\r\nIt would be good to include  [~lgoodhewcook], [~vsharma@atlassian.com], and [~gkaszkur@atlassian.com] in this discussion.
