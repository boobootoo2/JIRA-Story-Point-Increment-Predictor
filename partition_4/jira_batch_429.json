That is, when creating a link between two objects, I want to be able to dynamically choose the reference type. In the attached example for instance, we could use this to specify how a contact in a CRM was related to an organization so that we could still get a cool visualization from the object graph (unlike just having a select list).What we've done instead is created multiple object type attributes, one for each reference type (e.g., Employee, Contractor, Consultant in the example), but this gets a little cumbersome the more reference types we add.Thanks, and let me know if you want any more information.",

It is not a calendar per se but a resource view/app with which one can schedule jobs and the resources required to complete the work. We would be interested in getting in touch with your people to find out what Insight can provide on the API level and what functionalities we need to implement ourselves.For example, it would be great to be able to use IQL to search for \"all resources of type vehicle with diesel engine, available between yyyy-mm-dd and yyyy-mm-dd+2\".In this particular context, a calendar as such is not enough. Or \"calendar\" like the way Office365 calendars work. Resource calendar will work for some of their use cases, like when you need special equipment or vehicles to be available and reserved for a particular \"gig\". That is one type of resource lock, i.e. the resource is _locked_ for a time period and needs to be _released_ before it is available for further use. Maybe the resource (again, vehicle or equipment) could be attached to another Insight object (or JIRA issue) between two timestamps. Or something... My thinking around this is not too clear yet and you probably have a number of approaches in mind based on the feature requests received from the field.Anyway, if you end up having a functional scheduling method for, say, electricians, plumbers, vehicles or such, you will\u00a0have a lot of potential customers from the public sector and from companies (small to large).----I am interested in hearing about your plans related to calendaring, how much of the customer's requirements can be covered by your existing or future features, and how much we need to build on top of Insight's features ourselves.",

E.g. select all assets of object type \"Virtual Server\" or \"Firewall\".If I open the popup window of the customfield for selecting these assets I have the possibility to select the object type in the hierarchy tree and then all assets of the selected object type are listed to the right. Or I have the possibility to use the search bar on the top to filter on assets. By now I have then to click on each individual asset to have it selected for the customfield.We would like to have the possibility to click on \"Select all\" to avoid clicking on each individial asset (see screenshot). I think you can imagine that this is very time consuming if you need to click on 100 assets one by one.We would be very appreciated if you could consider this feature request in one of your next releases.Thank you and best regards,Manuel Lindner",
