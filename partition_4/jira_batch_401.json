In order for our developers to get an idea of what they are doing they need to assign hours (up to a max of 4) to those tasks, eventually we are striving to leave out the hours, we're not there yet.\n\nThese hours are however not shown in the 'work' screen (agile board) on the cards. I noticed that they become visible when I change the 'Estimation Statistic' to 'Original time estimate'. I wonder if it's possible to show them in 'Story Points' mode as well.\n\nI have read about the issue with card configuration (that it might hinder redesign of the cards). But since it's already on the card in one mode, I was wondering if you could add a checkbox that would allow it to always be displayed on the cards?",

      "description": "{panel:bgColor=#e7f4fa}\n  *NOTE:* This bug report is for *JIRA Software Cloud*. Using *JIRA Software Server*? [See the corresponding bug report|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSWSERVER-6471].\n  {panel}\n\n In GreenHopper, it is possible for us to configure the a scrum board filter to include other projects, or only include certain issues of a project by attributes as needed. Because of this, there's a possibility that users may accidentally include a sub task to a Sprint while actually the parent task is excluded from the Sprint. When this scenario happen, the following error will be produced if we try to generate a Sprint Report:\n!scshot1.png!\n\nA simple steps to reproduce the problem:\n- Create a new project with 1 issue having 1 subtask\n- Create a scrum board for the project\n- Go to the Plan board and include the parent issue in a Sprint (subtask won't be displayed in the plan board). Start the Sprint\n- Modify the board filter (Configure > Filter > View in Issue Navigator), exclude the parent task from the filter. Save.\n- Back to the Scrum, try to generate Sprint Report and the problem is reproducible.\n\nIt'll be great if we have the feature to exclude a sub task if the parent issue is not included, or add a more meaningful message that may help customer to understand the root cause of the problem. \n\nh3. Workaround\nRemove the subtask without the parent from the JIRA Agile (formerly GreenHopper) board. Identifying the problematic issues is not a trivial process, and can be done with either of the following workarounds:\n\nh5. Using JQL\n\n# Identify the board which is causing the problems and copy the filter from it in *Board > Configure > Filter > Filter Query*. For example:\n{noformat}\nproject = \"Sample Scrum Project\" ORDER BY Rank ASC\n{noformat}\n# Add {{AND type not in subTaskIssueTypes()}} to it (see the below example) and then search for that filter in the Issue Navigator, so as to return all the parent issues.\n{noformat}\nproject = \"Sample Scrum Project\" AND type not in subTaskIssueTypes() ORDER BY Rank ASC\n{noformat}\n# Those issuekeys will need be collected and collated for comparison against a filter again. This can either by done by exporting the results to CSV and extracting them from there, or by using the Javascript in step 4 & 5.\n# Using Chrome, open the [Chrome Developer Tools|https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/docs/overview#access], select the console and add the following Javascript to it. Make sure to press enter after adding the Javascript.\n{code:javascript}\nAJS.$(document).ajaxSuccess(function(e, obj) { try{ console.log(JSON.parse(obj.responseText).issueTable.issueKeys.join(',')) } catch(e) {} })\n{code}\n(i) You should see the below appear after entering to confirm the JS went through:\n!Document.png!\n# Reload to filter and the issue keys will be put together in the console as below:\n!Issues.png!\n# Take those issue keys and add them into the JQL query from step 2, put them inside the {{and parent not in ()}} section and change the {{not in subTaskIssueTypes()}} to {{in subTaskIssueTypes()}}. See the below example:\n{noformat}\nproject = \"Sample Scrum Project\" AND type in subTaskIssueTypes() and parent not in (SSP-1,SSP-2,SSP-3,SSP-4,SSP-5,SSP-6,SSP-8,SSP-9,SSP-10,SSP-13,SSP-14,SSP-15,SSP-16,SSP-17,SSP-18,SSP-19,SSP-20,SSP-21,SSP-22,SSP-23) ORDER BY Rank ASC\n{noformat}\n(i) This will search for all parent issues that do not exist within the board.\n# Remove those subtasks from the board.\n\nh5. Using SQL\n\nIn order to find out all the subtasks without their parent, you may use the following queries: \n# Run the following query in the database and get the id of the subtask link: \n{code:sql}\nSELECT * \nFROM   issuelinktype \nWHERE  linkname LIKE '%subtask%'; \n{code}\n# After this run the following query in the database, substituting the value for 'Link Type Id' by the id derived from the above SQL:\n*Before JIRA 6.1:*\n{code:sql}\nSELECT ji2.pkey AS \"parent issue key\", \n       ji1.pkey AS \"child issue key\" \nFROM   issuelink il \n       JOIN jiraissue ji1 \n         ON ji1.id = il.destination \n       JOIN jiraissue ji2 \n         ON ji2.id = il.source \nWHERE  il.linktype = <Link Type Id>;\n{code}\n*After JIRA 6.1:*\n{code:sql}\nSELECT p.pkey AS \"parent project key\",\n    ji2.issuenum AS \"parent issue num\",\n    q.pkey AS \"child project key\", \n       ji1.issuenum AS \"child issue num\" \nFROM   issuelink il \n       JOIN jiraissue ji1 \n         ON ji1.id = il.destination \n       JOIN jiraissue ji2 \n         ON ji2.id = il.source \n       JOIN project p\n        ON ji1.project = p.id\n       JOIN project q\n        ON ji2.project = q.id \nWHERE  il.linktype = <Link Type Id>;\n{code}\n\n(i) This query will list all the sub task type of issues with their parents. You can now compare the subtasks from your filter query and verify if their parents are present on the board by looking up their parent id from the query results.",

Even only *one* sub-task is done and the others not yet.\n\nThis is also reproducible when a user divide a Board into two for the same project and workflow.
