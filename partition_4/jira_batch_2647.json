(Example: cp TestArtifact2 /Applications/Test)\r\n3. Run the plan and notice that the artifact gets generated and copied to /Applications/Test correctly.\r\n4. Now, delete the artifact definition in step 1, navigate to the location where the artifact generated in your last/current build is stored (Example: /Users/ssetayeshfar/Documents/bamboo-home-511/artifacts/SVNP-SVNPL/JOB1/build-00044) and manually delete the existing artifact. (You can also modify the script or have specific configurations that will not always generate an artifact in step 1).\r\n5.

Also selecting \"build and release\" in the instructions provided via the cogwheel provides the same error message.\r\n\r\nThat button makes customers really confused and users end up clicking on this button by mistake what provides an error message as you can see in the attached screenshot. \r\n\r\nCustomer from JIRA Hosted would like to either remove the \"release tab\" from the downloaded version and go only with the cogwheel, or make the release button do the same as the cogwheel for downloadable versions.",

      "description": "The automated Maven dependency management works great for detecting which plans are dependent on each other. This works very well.\r\n\r\nHowever, this feature is next to useless when using multiple agents - especially the Elastic Bamboo agents. This is because when the triggered projects go to build, they can't find their dependencies.\r\n\r\nAs a manual work around, you can:\r\n* publish the artefacts (build artifact and pom.xml) as Bamboo artefacts from the source project.\r\n* download the artefacts in the destination project\r\n* call 'mvn install:install-file' on the downloaded Maven artifacts so that they can be found during the build.\r\n\r\nAs a manual approach, this is very tedious, especially when setting up projects with several related dependencies.\r\n\r\nAll of this information is available to Bamboo, however, thanks to the Maven Dependencies Processor. That task needs a complement - a Maven Dependencies Artifact Downloader - which automates the steps described above.\r\n\r\n(Note that this shouldn't require changes to the pom - unlike the deprecated Bamboo Artifact Sharing Maven Plugin)",
