Below are several different ideas that may make programming against the API even easier while also moving it towards a more pure RESTful interface.\n\n==== Uniform Interface ====\\\\\nCurrently Deployment Keys, Likes, Repository Links, according to the documentation (https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/BITBUCKET/Using+the+bitbucket+REST+APIs), are all using what I assume is an older uri (i.e. https://bitbucket.org/!api/1.0/repositories/bitbucket/_) whereas all other resources are accessible via the more comprehensible https://api.bitbucket.org/1.0/_. I chalked this difference up to the API&#x27;s experimental nature but felt it deserved a mention. I think it is implicit how a uniform entry to the API lends it self to ease/quality of programmability.\n\n==== No Client State Tracking Yields Robustness ====\\\\\nTerrible title I know but regardless, much of the inspiration for this was taken from salesforce.com&#x27;s implementation of REST (http://www.salesforce.com/us/developer/docs/api_rest/).\n\nI shouldn&#x27;t have to code into the client the various uris that the API provides to me. This would break my application on every API change. Not only that, but I have no way on the client side of probing the interface for exposed resources. For example:\n\nbq. curl https://api.bitbucket.org/1.0\\\\\n{\\\\\n\"changesets\":\"/[uri]\",\\\\\n\"deployment_keys\":\"/[uri]\"\\\\\n...\\\\\n}\\\\\nThis way I can build the client around what is actually there not what the documentation said when I first started development. It&#x27;s easy to see how the client can react gracefully to api changes if the keys (&#x27;changeset&#x27; and &#x27;deployment_keys&#x27; in the above example) remain constant throughout a version.\n\n\nI believe what&#x27;s being done currenty with the repositories resource is exemplary and should be the model for all other resources.",

We are either currently copying the title in manually when accepting a pull request or developers have to look up a pull request using the id in the git log message.\n\nThis suggestion becomes powerful when combined with the JIRA DVCS connector and the upcoming smart commits feature. The pull requester places the JIRA key (Something we are already doing) into the pull request title along with the smart commit e.g. #closes .

Make a better 403.\n\n----\nIt&#x27;s pretty easy to generate the attached Django 403 error.\n\nI regularly do it by accident using Chrome.\n\nIf I have bitbucket open, say:\\\\\nhttps://bitbucket.org/elequ/elena/overview\n\nIf I then restart my browser session and the tab is automatically reopened to:\\\\\nhttps://bitbucket.org/account/signin/?next=/elequ/elena/overview\n\nThis causes the csrf token failure. Makes sense, no problem. This is good and right.\n\nThe issue is this page looks so out of sorts on such an otherwise awesome project and reveals corporate knowledge. I didn&#x27;t truly realise this project was Django, but now I do. Also it&#x27;s so easy to make error pages in the Django.\n\nJust heads up. Thanks!",
