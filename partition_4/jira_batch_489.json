We use Pareto charts to see where the most issues occur, so that if we solve that problem (software change, training, redundancy, etc.), then we get the biggest return on future call prevention.\r\n\r\nAs we discussed at the conference, it would be great to have JIRA Service Desk support Pareto charts.  \r\nIf a gadget were a Pareto chart, I would think that it would follow current gadget setup including:  Pick the filter you want to use and pick the field to use across the bottom of the chart (example:  System, location, root cause\u2026 etc.)\r\n\r\nThe black line is just the cumulative percent up to 100%, where Pareto 80-20 rule: which items together solve 80% of the problems.

Having the ability to link a single Jira Service Management project to these spaces would be better, since that would require less Space and Page re-arranging. Not changing the pre-existing Knowledge Base environment would be less troubling for Customers as well.\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nHave Jira Service Management\u00a0be able to connect to multiple Confluence Spaces.\r\nh5. Use cases\r\n - related knowledge is scattered among multiple Spaces;\r\n - a subset of knowledge needs to be shared among more Service Desks, but other topics are covered in specific Spaces.",

Issues have SLA information attached, queues of at-risk and breached issues are on hand, and reporting gives real time insight into the status of tasks at hand. \r\n\r\nLocalization provides its stakeholders a report that shows the average time to resolution for the month/quarter. Localization can also point to the SLA (named \u201cTime to Resolution\u201d) to see its percentage of success in the current week. Still, stakeholders ask for SLA success over time. \r\n\r\n*Opportunity*\r\n* New JQL function: SLA\r\n** Example: SLA = \u201cTime to Resolution\u201d and CreatedDate = startofmonth() and \u201cTime to Resolution\u201d != breached()\r\n* Modified Gadget\r\n** Using the SLA function several charts (Created vs Resolved, Pie Chart, Cumulative flow) could be modified to display breached and unbreached issues in a way that supports the report described above.\r\n* New Service Desk Report Series\r\n** Success Rate\r\n** Example: Time to Resolution - Success Rate\r\n** This series would allow for a report to show the success percentage over time in the same way that average time to resolution is shown.\r\n",

[See the corresponding bug report|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSDCLOUD-131].\n  {panel}\n\n(This is a cross-post from https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/229837/service-desk-email-format-links-on-issues-created-from-email-vs-customer-portal as I was advised to report this as a bug here based on the response by Brad Baker at Atlassian.)\r\n\r\nIn trying to create a consistent customer experience for our end-users who we're now supporting with Service Desk, I've noticed that emails sent by JIRA for issues created by the Email Handler use a different format than emails sent by JIRA for issues created via the Service Desk Customer Portal.\r\n\r\nExample #1: Email format for issue created by Email Handler:\r\nhttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/16273/Screenshots/email%20from%20issue%20creation%20via%20email.jpg\r\n\r\nExample #2: Email format for issue created by the Service Desk Customer Portal:\r\nhttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/16273/Screenshots/email%20from%20issue%20creation%20via%20customer%20portal.jpg\r\n\r\nI'm looking for how we can setup the email handler in Example #1 to match the email format (including links to the Service Desk Customer Portal) in Example #2. Right now, the customer experience is like we're using two separate systems for this. Links in Example #1 go to the default JIRA UI instead of going to the Service Desk UI for customers.\r\n\r\nIt's like we need the ability to create an email handler for a Service Desk -- but I see no way to do this in OnDemand. Is this working as designed or is there a bug with the code that Brad says \"tries to suppress the fact that the reporter gets both a SD email and a JIRA email?\"\r\n\r\nAs an additional note, issues created in JIRA via email handlers do NOT show up under the \"My Requests\" view from the customer portal in Service Desk. It's like our email handler is ignoring the fact that we have Service Desk enabled. I wanted to mention that here in case the two issues are related, however I can submit a separate bug report for this particular problem if need be. FWIW, we were a Service Desk Beta user in case that has any implications on our configuration.\r\n\r\nOur SEN # is: SEN-2196722\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\n-Eric",

See [comment below|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSD-107?focusedCommentId=853509&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-853509].*_\r\n\r\nAs outlined in this answer question https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/225223/does-jira-service-desk-have-a-public-rest-api# JIRA Servicve Desk does not currently have a public REST API.\r\n\r\nWe do have internal REST resources that we use in the agent view and we plan to expand that into the \"customer portal view\" soon but these do not have the strong API guarantee against change. They are there to support the \"dynamic browser front end\".\r\n\r\nService Desk is of course built on top of the JIRA platform so issue creation / retrieval REST APIs are available via standard JIRA facilities.\r\n\r\nhttps://docs.atlassian.com/jira/REST/latest/\r\n\r\nAs the JIRA Service Desk architect I am intrigued to learn more about about what type of REST APIs people would like and what use cases you are trying to satisfy and how they are more specific to JIRA Service Desk than the current JIRA public REST api.\r\n\r\nPlease use this improvement request on JAC (https://jira.atlassian.com/) or send me a direct email on brad.baker@atlassian.com to further discuss what you are after.",
