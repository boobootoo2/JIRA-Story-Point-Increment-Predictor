      "description": "I am using bitbucket for a couple of years and all that time I was doing some small projects stuff with 2-3 persons.\n\nBitbucket is getting better and in from my point of view (as a small team member) it could cover all aspects of the project. There are repo, wiki, issues, team management, downloads.\n\nI know that you are trying to keep issues tracker thin and I know that Jira should satisfy all need of advanced project management and project specific stuff. But there are a just very simple things that could make Bitbucket already self contained. I am about some visualisation tools like progress bar to milestone or version. It is not something very complex and it should not be, just small progress bar with configuration what issues are closed for particular milestone or version. At that is all. I believe many people will find that stuff useful.\n\nBefore writing that issues I tried to integrate Jira and it was not as perfect as I thought it should be. For example I could not find the way to import issues from Bitbucket to Jira if there were no specific labels in issue names and commits.\n\nHope there will be some positive feedback or ways to do it with plugins or smth.",

This marks the issue resolved as expected.\\\\\nHowever, now any time I push a new branch to bitbucket each issue that was &#x27;auto-marked&#x27; previously is auto marked again.\\\\\nHere is the workflow that reproduces this problem:\n\n\nbq. To summarize:\n\n\n# Create local branch X\n# Push branch X to origin\n# Alter branch X locally\n# Commit branch X locally with message that includes \"Fixed BCLOUD-1\" to mark issue 1 resolved.\n# Push branch X to origin *** At this point, issue BCLOUD-1 is automatically marked resolved.\n# Create and accept pull request to merge branch X with master\n# Locally, checkout master and pull from origin\n# Create new branch Y.\n# Push branch Y to origin *** At this point, issue BCLOUD-1 is commented on again automatically\\\\\nIt seems like the \"Fixed BCLOUD-1\" message is persisting somehow and each time I push a branch, it triggers another round of issue comments and emails.

      "description": "Before the upgrade to the newer, sexier BitBucket, when creating a pull request it would select sensible defaults. For example, let&#x27;s say we have:\n\nMainRepo, with 2 branches: default, stage\n\nthen I fork MainRepo as MyMainFork.\n\nI make changes in the default branch of MyMainFork, and push them to my fork on BitBucket.\n\nAt that point, I select \"Pull Request\" to issue one. In the old BitBucket, by default it selected the branch w/ changesets that were ahead of the common ancestor between MainRepo and MyMainFork, and it would choose the destination repository as MainRepo.\n\nIn the new BitBucket, it picks the default branch and MyMainFork as the defaults for the Pull Request destination. This doesn&#x27;t make any sense!! Why would I issue a Pull Request from MyMainFork to MyMainFork?\n\nI&#x27;ve done this by accident twice now, and was left wondering why nobody could see my Pull Request.",
