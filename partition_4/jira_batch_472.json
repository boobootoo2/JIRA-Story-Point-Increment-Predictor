We have several service desks at the office, and one of those we don't want it to be chatty towards the customers. What I would have liked to do was to disable the emails to the reporter, but leave everything else as-is.\r\n\r\nAfter much pondering I ended up keeping JSD notification set to ON globally, and setting the project-level notifications scheme to NONE. This solves some of the problem, but service desk agents won't get emails either when we assign to them. \r\n\r\nIt'd be nice if we had more control over this, such as turning OFF the service desk notification scheme at the project level, or use the project notification scheme to control when the emails are sent (but not their format).",

Before launching this new feature, our goal was to make service desk notification more conversational. We\u2019ve made a decision to move forward with helping agents save time with a friendly greeting and sign off with the agent name to make it more personal. We acknowledge that this functionality isn't for every agent and your desire to customize these responses.\r\nSo far we've added additional translation strings for German, French and Japanese. \r\nYou can also help us in translating for your language here if it is missing https://translations.atlassian.com/. \r\nThe string are:\r\n\r\n{noformat}\r\nsd.comment.prepopulated.default.greeting=Hi {0},\r\nsd.comment.prepopulated.default.anonymous.greeting=Hi,\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nThe ability to edit these responses will require a bit more thought, the immediate action for us is to provide an option for agents to turn this functionality off as they wish in the upcoming release. If you want to customise further, it's being tracked at https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSD-631.\r\n\r\nThanks for your patience and we hope you appreciate our open approach to feature requests.If you have further questions or comments, please feel free to contact me directly as well at jhuynh at atlassian dot com.\r\n\r\nBests,\r\nThe JIRA Service Desk team\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\n",

For SLAs, it is either running, unless completed or has matched a pause condition. When outside of working hours, it is essentially still running, just inactive.\r\n\r\nTherefore, we will address this requirement, by adding a new JQL function withinWorkingHours() that will allow you to combine JQL functions to see if an issue is running and in/out of working hours.\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Summary\r\nWhenever an issue is created outside the hours configured in the calendar attached to the first SLA rule in the Service Desk, the issue will not be findable using the != running() or = paused JQL functions.\r\n\r\nh3.

Expected Results\r\nThe issue created at step 4 shows up as a result to the JQL at step 5\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nThe issue created at step 4 does not shows up as a result to the JQL at step 5\r\n\r\nh3. Notes\r\nThe use case for this functionality, is to enable an automated comment on issues that have been created outside of configured SLA hours.\r\nThis will help set expectations to the reporters of these issues regarding the time before which their issues are not likely to get picked up.\r\nFor instance, if the first response SLA is set to run between 09:00 and 17:00, and an issue gets created at 23:00, the reporter should be notified of this",

When an issue is created by a customer using the portal, these sub-tasks are visible as requests in the portal. Notification emails are also sent for the sub-tasks, resulting in 3 email notifications per request. \r\n\r\nWe've tested the post functions with Bob Swift's Create on Transition plugin and Script Runner and believe this may be a bug in Service Desk. \r\n\r\nI've attached two screenshots.

Due to its screen scheme, issue type B has a \"Default\" screen and a screen for the \"Create Issue\" operation.\r\nField C is availble in the \"Default\" screen but is not removed from the \"Create Issue\" screen. Field \"C\" might, for example, be the field \"Fix Version/s\", which is not necessary when creating a new issue.\r\nHowever, I want field C to be visible for the customers inside the Sevice Desk customer portal. Therefore I want to add field C inside the Service Desk settings (Service Desk > Request type > Request type A > Edit fields > Add a field). But field C does not appear inside the selection. Apparently, only the fields configured for the \"Create issue\" screen appear here, even though the field selection for the request type is used for all operations inside the customer portal.\r\nIs this working as intended or a bug? If it is w.a.i., what is a possible workaround to not see field C when creating issue type B inside JIRA but to see field C inside the customer portal?\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nHe would like  the customer portal not to follow the JIRA specified screen scheme.",
