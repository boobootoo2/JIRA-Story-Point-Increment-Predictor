Steps to reproduce\n\n# Create a Software Project.\n# Create an issue.\n# Create a sub-task from the issue, set *original estimate* to 3w.\n# Observe the parent issue, the Time Tracking is showing 3w as original estimate and remaining if the option to include sub-tasks is selected.\n#  !parentIssue.png|thumbnail! \n# Create a board for this project.\n# Configure the board to estimate the issues in the Backlog using *Original Time Estimate* and *Track time against issues using JIRA's Remaining Estimate and Time Spent fields*\n# Go back to the board, choose to *show detail view*\n# Click on the parent issue\n\n\nh3. Expected result\n\nThe original estimate should show the total estimate for both the parent and sub task.\n\n\nh3. Actual result\n\nThe original estimate is showing _unestimated_.\n !unestimated.png|thumbnail! \n\n\nh3.

      "description": "Hello team,\n\nWe've discovered, after an user reported a performance issue, that some threads on GreenHopper aren't using a synchronized protection, which means that we can have data inconsistency or infinite loops caused by multiple threads accessing a share resource.\n\nOn a specific case, the customer was able to track that a thread of com.pyxis.greenhopper.GreenHopperImpl.put method was stuck. Also, as per his comments:\n\n{quote}\nTherefore, I conclude that the HashMap is being improperly accessed. I checked the code - and sure enough - if you track the stack backwards from the put() higher, I see no use of synchronization primitives. No thread safety. 18 threads are locked in a put() against a non-thread-safe data structure. Something is wrong.\n\nThe consequence of improper access are varied and random as they depend on the exact assumptions that each thread is making about cached data. One possible outcome can be a regular loop accessing the data structure turns into an infinite loop due to a \"circular\" reference, because of incorrect assumptions that the JVM is making about the data it is accessing.\n{quote}\n\nCould you please consider this and tell us if this is possible to implement a protection on running threads?\n\nThanks!

While their tool has a long way to go for Enterprise use, they've done a good job of making backlogs and sprints almost manage themselves.  The contents of sprints will change many times to adapt to changing requirements and circumstances, as reflected in a well-maintained backlog.  \n\nWith all GH's additional data and configurability, GH could automate sprint planning even better than Pivotal Tracker does, reducing the effort required to just maintaining a solid backlog.\n\nFurther, once there has been some progress down a backlog, it is possible for GreenHopper to calculate our velocity empirically, replacing our manual \"default\" velocity with a more justifiable, data-driven number.\n\nI had to write a Jira plugin to provide us with Velocity, Iteration Views, and Release prediction, but I'm not asking for any of that for now.  It just seems silly to have to manually drag stories around to \"create\" sprints.  \n\nSprints will occur in reality, whether we construct them in GreenHopper or not.  Let's make it so those sprints are both planned and tracked automatically, just by having a backlog and burning it down.  :)\n",

In other words, GH automatically classes them as \"new scope\". But if I'm creating all of the information after the fact, there's no way to actually know that. Making such critical decisions FOR the user based on a (frankly arbitrary) datum such as a record creation date is far too limiting. (Perhaps the ability to mark the task as either \"original\" or \"added\". This gets to the overall issue of scope management in GH, as GHS-1288 for example).\n\nBut if I try to create my demo project by creating versions/sprints, tasks and worklogs in the future, the burndown chart won't show this data, apparently because it \"hasn't happened yet.\" Again, IMO, a case of the tool trying to do too much based on whatever the current date happens to be.\n\nI think the tool needs to worry less about enforcing any particular view of how things \"should\" be, and simply reflect the way they ARE according to the data that's been entered.
