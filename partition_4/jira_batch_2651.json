Perhaps I've misunderstood the current permissions but I can't see how this can be done.\r\n\r\nWhat I would like is a new permission that I could give to users or groups that would allow them to inspect another projects configuration, but they cannot trigger manual builds or edit anything in the configuration.\r\n\r\nThanks and keep up the good work!",
