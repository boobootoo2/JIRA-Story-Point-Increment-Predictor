      "description": "h3. Summary\r\nWhen we right-click the tickets on the backlog of software project boards, the menu is sometimes displayed at the top of the page, instead of where you clicked it. It happens only in the new interface.\r\n\r\nWhen testing, we could see that the menu appears in the position defined in the style attribute 'top' of an HTML element with ID 'gh-ctx-menu-trigger_drop'. This is defined in pixels and this number decreases as the number of sprints and issues increases progressively, but almost invisibly for each new sprint or issue, but adds up as this number increases. \r\n\r\nSo, this bug is not reproducible on boards with only a few issues and sprints, but large backlogs, the 'top' element may even have a negative value, meaning it will show above the browser window, invisible to the user.\r\n\r\nAlso, the menu position is dependant on the position of the card on the board. The closest to the top the card is, the higher up the menu will appear, so if you right-click cards on the top, it's more likely that it will be hidden on the top of the screen.\r\n\r\nh3. Environment\r\nCloud - Jira d94605f9\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Create a board with many issues and sprints\r\n# Try to right-click on a ticket in the backlog of a software board.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nRight-click menu should be displayed where you click\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nThe menu is displayed at the top of the page.\r\n \r\nh3. Notes\r\n\r\nWe carried out some tests that clearly showed that the menu starts going up as the number of sprints increased. In all these tests, the only issue in the backlog was right-clicked:\r\n# This is a board with a single issue and no sprints:\r\n!no_sprints.png|thumbnail!\r\n# This has 7 sprints (still 1 issue), the 'top' style attribute is at '419px' here:\r\n!7_sprints.png|thumbnail!\r\n# Here, the board has 12 sprints (1 issue), the 'top' style attribute is at '272px'. We can see it's going up, it's not even aligned with the issue we clicked (the only one in the screenshot)\r\n!12_sprints.png|thumbnail!\r\n# With 20 sprints, it's almost reaching the top of the page, the 'top' attribute is at '53px':\r\n!20_sprints.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nIt may seem a long way to reach the top, but adding tickets also affects this behavior. Here is the same board still with 20 sprints, but with 15 tickets spread across the board, instead of 1:\r\n!20_sprints_15_issues.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nIn this case, 'top' attribute is already '23px'.\r\n\r\nh3.Workaround\r\n\r\nh4. Workaround 1\r\nUse drag and drop if you want to move to a different sprint\r\n\r\nh4. Workaround 2\r\n# Open your browsers JavaScript Console:\r\n#* https://webmasters.stackexchange.com/questions/8525/how-do-i-open-the-javascript-console-in-different-browsers\r\n# Right-click the card\r\n#* *Make sure not to click anything else in the browser*\r\n# Run this in JS Console:\r\n{code}\r\ndocument.querySelector(\"#gh-ctx-menu-trigger_drop\").style.top = \"500px\"\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nHere's a video showing workaround 2:\r\n[^JRACLOUD-67978.mp4]",
