The user can set the repository location to /project-a/trunk, and it will look for branches in /project-a/branches. However, users have been considering an alternate repository layout that looks like this:\r\n{code}\r\n/trunk/project-a\r\n/trunk/project-b\r\n/branches/<branch-name>/project-a\r\n/branches/<branch-name>/project-b\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nThis would allow him to create a branch that encompasses multiple related projects, all of which will be modified together in that branch, instead of creating separate but inter-dependent branches under each project's own trunk/branches/tags structure.\r\n\r\nHowever, this structure doesn't work well with Bamboo. The user can configure it to look for branches of project-a under /branches, but then Bamboo thinks /branches/<branch-name> is a branch of project-a. In reality, the branched version of project-a is one level deeper at /branches/<branch-name>/project-a.",

Workaround\r\nThe problem that is highlighted in this issue can be reduced to modifying effective configuration of multiple plans with a simple change in Bamboo configuration (editing global variable). \r\nWe believe that Bamboo allows for such behavior with use of [Bamboo Specs|https://confluence.atlassian.com/bamboo/bamboo-specs-894743906.html]. Moving configuration of Bamboo plans to code allows modifying configuration of multiple Plans at the same time and much more.",
