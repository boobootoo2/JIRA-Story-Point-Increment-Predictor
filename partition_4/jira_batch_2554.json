But downloading the file results in the previous file being served from the cloudfront CDN.\n\n=== Additional information ===\n\nWe have confirmed this behaviour on various pc&#x27;s, and we have ruled out local caching by uploading and downloading the file from different computers.\n\nWe noticed you are using amazon cloudfront to host the actual files uploaded to the project. All the machines we tested on are located in Buenos Aires, Argentina, South America. I don&#x27;t know if this has anything to do with cdn replication of the original file.\n\n=== Steps to reproduce ===\n\nh1. Create a text file containing a line \"First\"\nh1. Upload the text file to a public repository by going to the downloads page of the repository (for example, https://bitbucket.org/braintag/carbonlibrestapis/downloads)\nh1. Download the file by clicking on the file name on the page\nh1. Edit the original text file and add a line \"Second\"\nh1. Upload the text file again to the same repository\nh1.
