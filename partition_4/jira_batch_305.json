Expected Results\r\n\r\nWhether you're adding a *To Do* status from the Workflow or moving columns, the first position column should always retain the *To Do* category.\r\n\r\nh3.

Issue Summary\r\n\r\nIf a board has non-working days configured in it and a sprint is started from said board, if you select a pre-defined duration, say 2 weeks, the default end date doesn't take non-working days into consideration. Also, in the end date selection field the calendar doesn't show any indications of the days that have been configured as non-working days.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Configure a board to have non-working days\r\n# From the board's backlog create a sprint and go to the *Start* dialog\r\n# Select a duration for the sprint that includes the configured non-working day.\r\n# Open the calendar for the end date field.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nIt is expected that the sprint creation dialog takes into consideration non-working days and compensates for them.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nThere's no indication, warning or automatic compensation in the end date field for non-working days.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nThe end date can be manually configured to compensate for non-working days; however this requires an extra step of manually verifying the board settings every time a sprint is going to be started.",

We hear you that not being able to use global custom fields in team-managed projects is a barrier to adopting the project type more broadly.\r\n\r\nThe good news is that we are now laying the groundwork for Jira admins to add global custom fields to team-managed projects. I\u2019ll keep you updated with our estimated completion date.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, do add comments on how and why your teams would want to use custom fields in team-managed project so that we can build products that suit your needs.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n Carol Low\r\n Product Manager\r\n{panel}\r\nh3.
