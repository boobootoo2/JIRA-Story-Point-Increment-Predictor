On top of that, I'm displaying the results in Jira dashboard using \"Test Execution\" gadget (https://zephyrdocs.atlassian.net/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=589892#TestMetrics(Gadgets)-test_execution). \n\nA feature that I'd really want to be in this gadget is the option to display test cycles based on their names (simple filtering). This is extremely needed when I want to run different test suites - showing their results on a single chart is very confusing, regarding different number of test cases and so on. If I could show, for example, test executions, grouped by Cycle, filter by cycle name \"acceptance\" in one chart, filter by cycle name \"integration\" in second chart - that would be awesome. The X axis would then show how test cycles of suites of same type were changing over time (new test cycles are always appended to the right).\n\nLooking forward to your opinion.\n\nThanks!",

So, if I want to setup a filter to only show a parent story, I create a filter for standard Issue types. \n\nThis is great because it keep my team focused on the parent story and I am not searching around all of the subtasks. However, if there is a parent story I need to see more detail on, I now need to click into the detail screen because if I want to see it on the Issue Detail view, its blocked by the filter.\n\nAll in all, I feel this drives a cleaner more focused board, and allows us to get a good sense of any issues without having the leave the board screen.\n\nthanks!",

Currently:\nCurrent JIRA integration with Bitbucket (and I expect GitHub and/or other DVCSs) allows automatic linking of a JIRA issue with a git branch, provided the issue's key is included in the branch name. Commits are similarly linked if the commit message also includes the issue key, and the Development panel when viewing that issue provides direct links to those branches and/or commits. \n\nh3. Suggested:\nAs a user I would like to be able to *manually* link *one or more* arbitrarily-named branches (i.e. the branch does not need to have the issue key in its name) to an issue. This could occur in a way similar to linking JIRA issues, or an approach like Labels or Components.\n\nh3. Example Use Case:\nI tend to name branches with the issue key of an Epic or other large-effort issue. The related work may involve multiple JIRA issues, each of which should be linked to the branch. The reverse is also true -- a given Epic or other issue may pertain to (or at least have relevant information regarding) multiple branches, but those branches don't necessarily have _every_ related issue's key in their branch names.\n\nAs a workaround, I'm currently using a Custom Field to specify related branches on an issue, specifically a Labels field to try to minimize text discrepancies like typos. Duplicate values still do occur, however, since labels are case-sensitive (e.g. branch names \"myfeature-KEY-123\" and \"myfeature-key-123\" and \"MyFeature-Key-123\" are treated as distinct values). Possibly a drop-down selection (e.g. similar to Project Components) could be available for this field so that links are made to a pre-determined list of known existing branches, or some happy medium.\n",

The authorizing account should have administrative access on all the repositories to be linked. \n\nThis suggests that in order to link accounts using the DVCS Connector, as a JIRA admin, I also need to have admin rights to the (in this case) GitHub Enterprise repo? If the owner of the repo generates the client id and secret, isn't that supposed to give the DVCS connector the privileges it needs? I was assuming that the \"team or user\" account is the one that provides the client id and secret. Why does the linking process seem to want to use my GHE account privileges?",

We have measured periods in which we received 600 requests/second between our JIRA host and our Github Enterprise instance.\n\nBased on a support issue, we've set *jira.devstatus.applink.ratelimit* to 60, but we anecdotally observe that it seems to affect the rate on a per-organization basis. If there are pushes to multiple repositories in several different organizations at about the same time, the request rates will spike again.\n\nWe would like to be able to specify that our JIRA host should never exceed _N_ requests per second to our Github Enterprise instance for any reason.\n",
