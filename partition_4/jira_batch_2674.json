      "description": "*UPDATE: As of UPM 2.14.2+, this bug prevents users from installing plugins through UPM in addition to the previous \"anonymous\" audit log behavior. See the comments below for more information.*\r\n\r\nWhen upgrading UPM 2.0 tests to run against Bamboo 3.4 (instead of Bamboo 3.4-rc2), I noticed a test fail.  I tracked it down to Bamboo's SAL implementation of {{UserManager.getRemoteUsername()}} returning {{null}} when running in a transaction ({{TxTemplate}}) inside a {{Callable}} executed by an executor created by {{ThreadLocalDelegateExecutorFactory}}.  I spent some time trying to generate a minimal reproducer, but the simple case was working fine for me.\r\n\r\nWhat I can tell you is that this functionality was working OK with Bamboo 3.4-rc2 but broke in the Bamboo 3.4 release.  To reproduce, you can check out r132786 of [UPM|https://studio.atlassian.com/svn/UPM/trunk]. If you want to run Bamboo+UPM 2.0 from the UPM tree, build everything with {{mvn clean install -DskipTests}}, then run {{mvn amps:debug -Pbamboo34 -Dproduct=bamboo}} from the {{integration-tests}} directory.  \r\n\r\n*If you install a plugin via UPM UI and then check the Audit Log, you'll see that the log entry is attributed to \"anonymous\" but should be \"admin\" (or whoever the current user is).*\r\n\r\nThis issue corresponds to [UPM-1521|https://studio.atlassian.com/browse/UPM-1521].",

This happens intermittently but often, on every project built by the OSX agent. Perforce ticket expiration for the build account is a few days.\r\n\r\nThe problem used to occur prior to a build's first stage after long periods of inactivity (say, coming back to work Monday morning). Now, however, it's happening to seemingly random steps at anytime. Sometimes retrying failed jobs succeeds, only to have the next stage fail. This intermittency, paired with a complete lack of ANY Perforce problems on the system outside of those Bamboo is reporting, leads me to believe that the reported error is inaccurate.\r\n\r\nI would like to ask (a) for help debugging this problem, and (b) that this error message never appear unless there actually is a problem with Perforce client retrieval, and that any other error report a more appropriate message.",
