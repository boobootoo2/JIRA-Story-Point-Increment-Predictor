The configuration for this is currently implemented painfully in javascript, which dynamically adds new fields to the form for configuration.  Deleting assertions is particularly difficult because there is no way to remove a key out of the Bamboo configuration once it has been put in there.  There are a few possibilities that would make plugin developers lives a whole let easier:\r\n\r\n* Allow build processor plugins to control what gets stored, rather than just storing everything that comes in from the web request.  Other than for validation, plugins cannot intercept or manipulate the data that gets sent when the configuration screen is saved.\r\n* Allow build processor plugins to be configured in multiple steps, similar to the way notifications are configured.\r\n* Provide an interface for allowing generic web components to easily modify build configuration.  This would allow plugins to have an advanced configuration screen for doing more powerful things.",
