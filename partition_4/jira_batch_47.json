However, I find that the updated styling reduced the visual appeal substantially. Furthermore, it is my contention that the new styling increases my mental energy required to use the UI, because of the lower contrast on the icon set styling. The new style is monotonic in color, with very few distinctive features in the user interface to help one use the software.\r\n\r\nCompare that to the v1.7 styling that used colors very well to guide one's eye easily to important aspects of the UI. Attached are screenshots of the v1.7 and v1.8 styles. Note in the v1.7 styling how easy it is to distinguish between the working copy, folders, remote and local branches. The color in the icons serve a substantial purpose there. In the v1.8 styling all one has to go by is the monotonic icons with thin lines that require unnecessary mental energy to distinguish the UI elements.\r\n\r\nPlease consider restoring some sensible coloring to the UI elements, to allow for better contrast. Thanks.",

It becomes tedious. \r\n\r\nPlus it prevents the ability to create a subtree/submodule from an external -> internal source since it's unable to resolve the sources through the proxy and direct at the same time. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately the \"Add Configuration to Git/Mecurial\" seem to break connecting to internal servers, but necessary for external.\r\n\r\nTo make this less confusing, it may help to add the ignore for certain domains such as localhost & .mycompanydomain.com to work just like a \"no_proxy\" \r\n\r\nI tried the below with no luck\r\n\r\nhttps://answers.atlassian.com/questions/14932/using-proxies-with-sourcetree\r\n\r\nhttps://answers.atlassian.com/questions/12162658/ignoring-proxy-settings-for-internal-git-server\r\n\r\nI'm looking forward to seeing this implemented in a future version of SourceTree , as I don't see how to do it in the current without a lot of effort - thanks!",

A Removed & B Changed\r\n\r\nThis is problematic because each of these requires a different resolution step, for 1 you merge the file with an external tool.
