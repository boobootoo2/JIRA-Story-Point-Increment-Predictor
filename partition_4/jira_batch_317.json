Switching to \"open sprint\" shows the issue, but then all other previously completed issues disappear.\n\nI understand that there is a similar suggestion JPO-1405 already in the system and I will ask the customer to vote for it, but the original request is slightly different and can be phrased as this:\n\n\"When the starting date picked for the filter is before the start of the current sprint, those issues within the current sprint that don't have any resolution set but are in statuses with category 'Done' should be shown.\"\n\nAlso based on the definition of what is considered completed in a certain time period, it seems if an issue doesn't acquire a resolution after the sprint is closed - it won't show up at all, no matter what option is selected.\n\nIt seems what is really needed here is a configuration option to identify what date field to take to identify when an issue can be considered completed by a Portfolio plan.\n\nAdditionally, If something has been completed in the current sprint and the current sprint started AFTER the date chosen in the Completion filter any logical being would assume that a filter \"Completed since October 1st\" will catch the issue. Not so for Portfolio. This needs to be fixed.\n\nIf marking an issue with a status in \"Done\" category makes Portfolio treat it as \"completed\" then the date when the issue first entered this status must be picked up as the date for \"Completed since...\" filter.",

For example, in the scenario above, if during the Initial Investigation stage a new work package/story is identified and created under Epic A, you would want Portfolio to automatically schedule that alongside the other Stories under Epic A.",

Allows you to add additional estimates at the Epic level too\nHowever, it would be brilliant if it could:\n1. Show the Original Estimate and allow it to be added / removed on the column view\n2. Show the Work Logged and allow this field to be added / removed onthe column view\n3. Rename the existing Time Estimates column header to Remaining so it more clearly maps to the JIRA ticket information itself (took me a while to figure out what it was doing...)\n",

So there is no backend call involved. \r\nWhile the parent dropdown uses a JQL to load issues from the backend. This happens because issues can change frequently (being renamed, new issues are added, old ones deleted, for example) and it would provide a terrible UX if Portfolio only loaded that once;  you would miss out on most recent changes made to issues in Jira. \r\n\r\nh3. Improved behaviour\r\nImplement a dedicated endpoint for just loading parents that gets rid of all things not needed to show parents would improve performance to our customers here.",

This issue is being addressed as part of the all new Portfolio live plans, which feature an entirely overhauled and more seamless integration model with JIRA Software / Agile. Live plans are currently available as a labs feature for both Server* and Cloud, so you can start evaluating them without any risk of impacting existing Portfolio plans. They are not yet feature-complete, we're working on bringing all major capabilities of standard plans back into live plans on top of the new integration model before we graduate live plans out of labs and make them the new standard way of working. \nPlease check out this blog for a summary and short videos of how the top-voted suggestions are being addressed with live plans: [Top 10 suggestions addressed in live plans|http://blogs.atlassian.com/2016/03/10-user-suggestions-addressed-in-portfolio-for-jira/] and join our [Portfolio Pioneers LinkedIn group|https://www.linkedin.com/groups/7018171] to discuss feedback and best practices!\n \nThanks,\nMartin Suntinger\n[msuntinger@atlassian.com|mailto:msuntinger@atlassian.com]\nPrincipal Product Manager, Portfolio for JIRA\n \n^*The live plans labs feature is available with Portfolio for JIRA 1.12 or higher. It is compatible with JIRA Software 7.0.5 or higher, and JIRA 6.3 or higher, in association with JIRA Agile 6.7.12 or higher.^\n{panel}\n\nAs it is now, changes in Epic Links are not synchronized between the JIRA issues and epics and Portfolio Epics and Stories.\nWhen portfolio stories and their epics are linked to JIRA issues and epics, then the epic link relations should_ always be consistent_ between JIRA and portfolio.\n\n* When I change the epic link of a JIRA issue in JIRA, this should be reflected in the hierarchy in Portfolio\n* When I move a story to an Epic in Portfolio, this should be reflected in the Epic link in the JIRA issue.\n\nIdeally, the synchronization would be automatic and instant.\nHowever, being able to update the links using the manually activated \"update\" functionality could be an acceptable workaround.\n\nIn my opinion, this missing consistency is by far the most important missing piece of \"JIRA Agile integration.\" and deserves individual attention.\nWe are evaluating Portfolio right now and I can vividly imagine the nightmare it would be to keep the epic links in JIRA and Portfolio consistent by manually checking and fixing them every day.",

Common practise when you have multiple teams is to have a Teams common field which you then assign Stories to.  I can't do this with the Portfolio field.\nSecondly in an enterprise there will be a lot of Teams, and I don't really want the entire list available to all project.  I usually setup a field context applied to projects which then has options on which are the available teams who can work on those projects.  That way there is a restricted list available in each project and its very difficult to choose an incorrect team.\n\n",

Summary\n\nCurrently the scheduling algorithm uses the stack-ranking of epics to determine scheduling constraints. If an individual creates an initiative later that supersedes another intiative then they have to manually pull up all the epics in that initiative above the epics in another initiative to reflect this relative initiative prioritzation. It would be very helpful if in the scheduling configuration section if you could designate priority on an initiative basis as opposed to an epic basis.\n\nh2. Background\nOur organization is very initiative focused and we determine organizational priorities based on the initiatives. We recently had a late initiative come into place that superseded all other initiatives. As we began to build the plan, bucket work into epics and then stories, some of these high priority epics were seemingly started later than expected causing an unrealistic timeline. This caused a lot of manual work to change the epic prioritization to match the initiative priortization.",

This issue is being addressed as part of the all new Portfolio live plans, which feature an entirely overhauled and more seamless integration model with JIRA Software / Agile. Live plans are currently available as a labs feature for both Server* and Cloud, so you can start evaluating them without any risk of impacting existing Portfolio plans. They are not yet feature-complete, we're working on bringing all major capabilities of standard plans back into live plans on top of the new integration model before we graduate live plans out of labs and make them the new standard way of working. \nPlease check out this blog for a summary and short videos of how the top-voted suggestions are being addressed with live plans: [Top 10 suggestions addressed in live plans|http://blogs.atlassian.com/2016/03/10-user-suggestions-addressed-in-portfolio-for-jira/] and join our [Portfolio Pioneers LinkedIn group|https://www.linkedin.com/groups/7018171] to discuss feedback and best practices!\n \nThanks,\nMartin Suntinger\n[msuntinger@atlassian.com|mailto:msuntinger@atlassian.com]\nPrincipal Product Manager, Portfolio for JIRA\n \n^*The live plans labs feature is available with Portfolio for JIRA 1.12 or higher. It is compatible with JIRA Software 7.0.5 or higher, and JIRA 6.3 or higher, in association with JIRA Agile 6.7.12 or higher.^\n{panel}\n\nThe problem: if a linked issue is moved to a new project in JIRA, its key and status will no longer be displayed correctly in Portfolio. To work around the problem, the issue-link can simply be deleted and re-added from within Portfolio. It would however be nice if this step was not required.",
