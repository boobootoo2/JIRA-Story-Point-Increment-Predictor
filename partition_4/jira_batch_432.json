With the server version this is possible.This is big issue, because the power users, that create Insight Imports are mostly not the same as the IT Staff managing a Data Center Cluster. Power users will most likely not have access to an actual virtual machine to download the logs by themselves. This makes the support process for data center very complicated and long.Options could be: * Logs become again available in the Support ZIP * Dedicated Insight Log Download Option similar to the Support ZIP * Better In-App Error Reporting instead of downloading logsI would prefer the last option to be honest.Looking forward to your proposals and feedback.Andreas",

      "description": "h3. Problem Definition\r\nCurrently, when opening custom fields' Object picker, there is a Search bar where a user can search Objects based on keywords (e.g. part of name, Object Key, or some other field values). However, there is no way to do a precise search by using a full IQL search filter.\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Resolution\r\nImplement an IQL search filter on the custom field Object picker form.\r\n\r\nh3. Use case:\r\nOur shipper has shipped 25 of our 1000 widgets to Margaritaville. He set the Location attribute for each widget to Margaritaville, and set the Batch attribute to '2018-06a'. He also shipped 50 widgets to Narnia, which are part of the same Batch, '2018-06a'. In Jira, he has created an Issue to track the shipment to Margaritaville. He would now like to add those widgets to the Issue. Clicking the magnifying glass beside the Issue's 'Widgets' custom field, he is presented with the object picker. He wants to find objects in Margaritaville from batch 2018-06a, so being a clever user he pastes in the IQL for this search, 'Location=Margaritaville and Batch=2018-06a' but receives the messageh3. \"No objects found!No objects found! Try if possible to reduce filter scope!\"In fact, I can't figure out a way to make this work at all. Searching for the two strings separated by a space does not appear to work, either.h3. The request:It would assist us greatly if the same search filter that is available within Insight was also available in the object picker, perhaps as an 'Advanced Search' option.Thank you for your time and consideration and also for creating such a great tool!",

      "description": "*Use case:*We use Insight as an asset register, where an asset is created as an object. We maintain our assets within an object schema.*Problem description:*Mit der Zeit kann es vorkommen, dass Assets ausgeschieden werden. Ausgeschiedene Assets werden als solche mitteles eines Attributs gekennzeichnet, verbleiben zu Audit-Zwecken jedoch im Objekt Schema. Bei der t\u00e4glichen Arbeit ist es jedoch \u00e4rgerlich bei der Auswahl eines Objekttyps immer die gesamte Liste der Assets pr\u00e4sentiert zu bekommen, wenn man sich jedoch nur einen \u00dcberblick \u00fcber aktive Assets verschaffen m\u00f6chte.Over time, assets may be eliminated. Eliminated assets are flagged as such using an attribute, but remain in the object schema for audit purposes. In the daily work, however, it is annoying when selecting an object type to always get presented the entire list of assets, but only to get an overview of active assets.*Feature description:*It would be advantageous if it were possible to configure a default filter per object type, which would hide these inactive objects accordingly. This standard filter should be easy to de-activate or re-enable by option and generally apply to all users.In addition, it would also be useful if inbound and outbound references would also consider these standard filters, thus, e.g. only show references to active objects.",
