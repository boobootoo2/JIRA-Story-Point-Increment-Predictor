As we follow the Git Flow development model, we find ourselves rebasing our feature branches on the `develop` branch daily. The obsolete (and unreachable) commits still show on the Git integration section on the\u00a0issue. This is confusing, especially if the number of commits is large, and if the number of rebases is also large, as I end up seeing dozens and dozens of commits, instead of the real, \"reachable\" commits.\n\nI have used JIRA (on-premise) integrated with on-premise Stash, and I am quite sure that we never had this issue.\n\nThe support engineer I spoke with in the linked service desk issue adviced me to overcome this by forcing a complete syncing. This works, but this is merely a workaround, as I have to do this all the time.\n\nI would suggest\u00a0enhancing your Github integration by implementing the same behaviour you are already providing when integrating with Stash (and presumably Bitbucket as well).

Why this is important\r\n\r\nUsers with workflows that do not have \u2018Done\u2019 or \u2018Done\u2019 mapped to the last column will not be able to use reports for insights.\r\n{panel:title=Atlassian Status Update - 22nd March 2021}\r\nHi everyone,\r\n\r\nThanks for your feedback on this problem. We appreciate the time that you took to help us be better.\r\n\r\nThough not ideal in some cases, the behaviour in-product today is not a bug. Proposed improvements here are a feature request and have to be prioritized against other requests.\r\n\r\nThis is how reports and boards work in Jira:\r\n # *Reports and sprints are burning down issues based on the last column on the board.*\r\n # *Our current reports are not built to report issues being done based on an issue\u2019s entire lifecycle (done-done), but based on when each board\u2019s work is done (last column), and the reports belong only to one board.*\r\n\r\n*Expected Result*\r\n As a user, I update my board\u2019s workflow. I don\u2019t map the Done status to the last column on the board. What this means is:\r\n * The Done status category is no longer associated with the last column on the board.\r\n * The column with the Done status category is now in another position on the board (that\u2019s not the last column).\r\n * When using multiple boards, some boards intentionally don\u2019t have Done in the last column. One board could be a QA board and the issue is only considered complete when it reaches the Releases board.\r\n\r\nI expect the story points completed in the sprint will show as completed in reports.\r\n\r\n*Actual Result*\r\n The business logic in Jira defines issues that are in the last column as complete. Any issues that aren\u2019t in the last column on the board will be considered incomplete, irrespective of the status category mapped to that column.\r\n\r\nThis impacts the data that\u2019s pulled through to your reports.\r\n * The velocity report will show 0 completed story points.\r\n * The sprint report will convert previously completed issues with a Done status to their previous state such as To do or In progress.\r\n\r\nTo mitigate any problems, try this workaround:\r\n # Go to *Board* > *Manage workflow*.\r\n # Add the removed Done status to your workflow. Give the status the same name as previously used in your workflow and reports.\r\n # At this stage, avoid adding any incoming transitions.\r\n # Save and publish the workflow.\r\n # From your board, navigate to the More actions (*\u2022\u2022\u2022*) > *Board settings*.\r\n # In *Columns and statuses*, move the Done status to the rightmost column.\r\n # Hit save.\r\n # Your reports should behave as before. Add any incoming transitions to the status.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019re using bugs to track any issues that prevent our features from being used as intended.\r\n\r\nBut we also understand and appreciate this escalation, and have *converted this to a feature suggestion* instead. This feature request will *allow you to specify which status category is considered done on a board and in existing reports.*\r\n\r\nPlease watch this Jira issue for future updates as we continue to work on improving reports.\r\n\r\nThis feature request requires a large investment and will be prioritized against other high-priority feature requests. On behalf of the Atlassian team, we take your feedback seriously and understand both the frustration and the urgency.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you have any further questions about this ticket.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n Ivan Teong\r\n Product Manager, Jira Software Cloud\r\n{panel}",

In such a situation, the Board configuration must contain options so that the board designer can specify what needs to be shown.\n\u00a0\nAt the minimum the shortcut list must be configurable. Best also if the board dropdown list can be reused to link to other boards.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nExample: specialisation across development teams.\nAcross the JIRA projects a specific subtask can be used (eg \"infrastructure subtask\"); or issues can be labled with \"performance\"\u00a0.\nDevelopers with that specific skillset need to (also) work across the teams. Hence they want a board showing all issues that eg require such a specialist to work on.\n\u00a0\nFor such a board the releases link probably makes no sense as it would end up showing the\u00a0releases of the entire company. But the board can contain shortcuts to sites that are frequently used by performance devs.\n\u00a0\nExample 2: Make a board to have an overview for a business program with all showstoppers / with all ongoing stories.\nJQL: epic_link= \"my epic\" and type=bug and priority=Blocker\nJQL: epic_link = \"my epic\" and sprint in opensprints()\n\u00a0\nWhile the issues may be scattered across the enterprise, the 80/20 rule dictates that most are inside a few JIRA projects. So it makes sense that next to the icon/name of this blocker-board\u00a0there are links to the core-related\u00a0JIRA boards.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0",
