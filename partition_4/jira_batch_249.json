After having spent a significant amount of time double checking all permissions and comparing them with those of a Jira administration account (which could manage the sprints allright) it turned out to be the following:\r\n\r\nthe query used for the rapid board contained [OR Sprint != \"\"]. Apparently it is not allowed to show issues which already have been taken into Sprint (a GreenHopper Sprint Field). Once the user removed the condition from the query, he was again able to control Sprint lifecyle.\r\n\r\nIMHO, it's a very well hidden trap to fall into. I would add a big caveat in the documentation (which only mentions project administration privilege as a criteria for sprint management) or run a sanity check on the rapid board query to warn the user of possible unintended consequences.\r\n\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nEdoardo\r\n\r\n",

In order for our developers to get an idea of what they are doing they need to assign hours (up to a max of 4) to those tasks, eventually we are striving to leave out the hours, we're not there yet.\r\n\r\nThese hours are however not shown in the 'work' screen (agile board) on the cards. I noticed that they become visible when I change the 'Estimation Statistic' to 'Original time estimate'. I wonder if it's possible to show them in 'Story Points' mode as well.\r\n\r\nI have read about the issue with card configuration (that it might hinder redesign of the cards).

When a new user creates a Scrum Board using the default method as described, he can create issues, but none of his issues will display in the Scrum backlog. I think this is an error in the Scrum Board creation code, which is incorrectly creating a Scrum Board using the \"To do\" status instead of the \"Backlog\" status. The \"To do\" status does not exist in the default workflow for Scrum.\r\n\r\nThe work-around for this error is to go to the settings and fix this manually. But this should be correctly done in the code, because without issues showing it's impossible to use the board, and it's not obvious why no issues are being displayed, especially to new users.\r\n\r\nTo replicate just create a new Scrum Board with the GreenHopper Simplified Workflow, and create some issues. You will see none show up in the board, until you do the manual work-around fix I described.",
