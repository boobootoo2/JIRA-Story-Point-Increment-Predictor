      "description": "h3. Issue Summary\r\nWhen an email is firstly invited as a customer and then as an Atlassian Account, they will end up with duplicated accounts. Customers in that condition will be asked to \"Login with single sign-on\" because of the Atlassian Account. If the Atlassian account is then disabled, Jira will still ask the user to \"Login with single sign-on\" even if the only active account now is the portal only one, which authenticates directly in Jira with username and password.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Create a portal only account;\r\n# Invite the same email as an Atlassian Account;\r\n# Disable the Atlassian Account;\r\n# Try to log in to the customer portal.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nJira will present the password field since the Atlassian Account is disabled and the email is now a portal only account.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nJira still asks the customer to \"Login with single sign-on\", but since the Atlassian account is disabled, they won't be able to log into the portal.\r\n- https://share.getcloudapp.com/8Lu79ApN\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\nDelete the Atlassian Account at <instance>.atlassian.com/admin or migrate the customer account to Atlassian Account and remove all the application accesses.",
