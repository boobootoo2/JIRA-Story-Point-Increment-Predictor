      "description": "It is a critical need for our systems to have EC2 instances to startup, not with a randomly created Volume out of the provided snapshot ID, but instead with a specific volume which ID is known from us.\r\n\r\nThe scenario is the following.\r\nWhen we start a cloud instance and perform a builds on it, since instances memory is not persistent, we save all our changes to the attached EBS Volume. As you know the Volume is generated out of a provided snapshot ID but luckily not deleted from the AWS Management console of the Amazon user profile. That mean, changes are kept in the Volumes until they are manually deleted via the AWS Management console.\r\n\r\nHere comes the issue that, very often we would like to start an instance later with exactly the status of few days before that is actually the current content of a volume A previously created at that time.\r\n\r\nThe only way out for us right now, is to start a new instance based on the same configuration that the one of few days ago that we want to replicate. Based on the snapshot ID a new EBS volume is created but absolutely useless for us since we want to be able to get the status of the old attached volume, therefore preceed by:\r\n\r\n    * login the AWS Management console\r\n    * locate the running instance & the volume attached to that instance\r\n    * detach the newly created volume\r\n    * attach the old volume (which ID remained available in the AWS Management console)\r\n    * login via SSH in the cloud instance\r\n    * mount the attached old volume back to the /mnt/bamboo-ebs\r\n    * start the necessary tools on the instance manually\r\n\r\nAs you can see this is a great performance issue for us that can be easily solved if there were an option to bind a specific Volume ID in a give instance configuration. This way when starting that instance, that volume only available for that specific user account could be in an automated way attached to the instance and ready to use.\r\n\r\nThe feature request (to be able to specify a volume that should be mounted to an elastic instance) would go along with the requirement that this volume should be not be deleted when the  elastic instance is going to shutdown.",

We unnecessary create 2 transactions one when DefaultPlanManager.generateBuildNumber is called and then another one within the first transaction when PlanHibernateDao.generateBuildNumberNewTx. In situation when many threads enter the first transaction and wait for the connection for the second(inner) transaction we get a deadlock.\r\n2. To ensure the uniqueness of build number we need to use synchronization inside java code. However right now we synchronize from within transaction which is wrong. It can lead to the situation when one thread changed value and exited the synchronized block however has not yet committed the value. Another thread that entered the synchronized block will see a stale value.",

      "description": "I have a repository with a post-commit hook to trigger a release build on Bamboo 2.5.1.  The release build is set to a Trigger Build Strategy, and uses a Maven2 builder to run the following:\r\n\r\nmvn -B release:prepare release:perform\r\n\r\nThis will cause Bamboo to checkout from the repository, build, tag the release, and then commit the next development snapshot to the repository.  Once the build has finished, Bamboo starts in on another build, and will continue in this \"build, commit, build, commit\" loop until manually canceled.\r\n\r\nI thought at first this was the post-commit hook's fault, so I removed it, but left the build strategy as Trigger Build Strategy.  I then manually triggered the release build from within Bamboo.  Same result... an infinite build loop.\r\n\r\nTaking a look at the code, it seems like DetectChangesAfterBuildCompletedListener is the culprit, because it explicitly fires a ChangeDetectionRequiredEvent if the build strategy is TriggeredBuildStrategy.  There's probably a good reason for this, but for me, it's a blocker on integrating Bamboo any further into our build process.\r\n\r\nI verified this to be the case for both Git and Subversion repositories.",
