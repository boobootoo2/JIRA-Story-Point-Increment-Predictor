To avoid further confusion we will be closing this ticket and consolidating all feedback and updates under\u00a0JSWCLOUD-12539.\r\n\r\nTo summarise where we are at, earlier in September 2021 we released an implementation of this Suggestion to a cohort of users as an experiment. After overwhelming feedback on this ticket and through other channels we decided to roll back this implementation. While the feature alleviated pain for some customers, it unfortunately did not meet customer expectations.\r\n\r\nWe will be exploring different solutions and will keep you updated.
