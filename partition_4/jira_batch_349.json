Problem Definition\n\nCurrently, in JIRA Software if a status is removed from the workflow used by the board, the following will happen:\n\n# Status removed (Eg: Open)\n# Open status is used by issues when a Sprint is ended.\n# Admin updated the workflow to remove the Open and replace it with To Do status.\n# The issues with Open status when the Sprint was ended will not be shown in any of the report in the board.\n\nThis happens because JIRA Software checks whether the status which was set for the issues when the Sprint was completed. If the status is removed from workflow, JIRA unable the issues in the report due to missing dependencies (status).\n\n\nh3. Suggested Solution\n\nThere are few ways to improve the existing behaviour:\n\n# Show the data correctly regardless whether any of the status is removed from the workflow.\n# Inform users on workflow change/removal of status for JIRA Software associated projects. This will prompt user to update the workflow to include the status which was removed previously.\n# In reports, show users data that is not included in the sprint reports. Eg : Table of *Not belonging to any column* and its missing statuses.\n\n\nh3. Workaround \n\n# Update the workflow used by the affected issues to include the status which was set to the issues when the Sprint was completed.\n# The steps to add the status in the workflow is done to make sure that the status appears back in the board so the admin can map it. \n# Once it's mapped, the issues will be listed back in the report. If they do not want to have this status in their workflow, they can remove them back.\n# Even when the status is removed from the workflow, the statuses will still be listed in the column management page (with exclamation mark).",

But there was no way to track how it was deleted and also no record left which JIRA issues were included in it before so we had to rely on our rough memory to recover the sprint.\n\nI'd like to suggest a feature that will send a notification to (at least) the project and board admin users about status change of a sprint, just like the notification of issue status change. In the sprint deletion case it would be nice if a snapshot list of the included issues can be provided together.\n\nThrough this way we would be able to manage the sprints more securely and do a proper follow-up action quickly for such accidental case.\n\nThanks for your support in advance and hopefully this suggestion would be accepted soon.\n\n\u00a0\n\nBest regards,\n\n\u00a0\n\nOliver Cho",

However they all want their own customizations independent of the other teams (don't ask), and so I am now going through and pulling them off of the shared scheme stack; making per-project copies of all of the workflows and screens for each of the 30 projects, and then re-building all of the mappings back up into schemes. Cloning the schemes themselves doesn't do me much good, because the underlying workflows and screens also need to be separate.\n\nI could probably script this, but it would make sense to me that when I'm copying a scheme, I had the option to say \"not only make a copy of this, but make copies of all of the underlying workflows\\screens\".",

In a network setup where there is a Reverse Proxy requiring authentication, the reverse proxy is forcing the internal traffic from JIRA to the SSO and does not permit the unauthenticated traffic to go through.\n\nIN [JRA-63795|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRA-63795], we saw health checks failing because the requests from JIRA weren't permitted via the reverse-proxy based authentication. (In that scenario, however, the {{/rest}} endpoint was whitelisted, but it still produced an inconsistent result due to authentication at the reverse proxy level).\n\nWhile we have the ability to bypass a reverse proxy/SSL by means of a secondary connector, we cannot tell JIRA to use this for internal requests - the Base URL is always used.\n\nh4. How to reproduce\n\nThe overview of the customer architecture is that JIRA webserver sits behind a client firewall which uses SiteMinder via an Apache Reverse proxy for authentication. JIRA appears to be using a plugin to read the logged in user from a cookie.\n\nh4. Expected Result\n\nJIRA should be able to access itself locally and not go through the Reverse Proxy/external SSO.\n\nh4. Actual Result\n\nJIRA is accessing itself via its base URL and the SSO is not letting traffic through that is not authenticated.\u00a0\n\nh4.Workaround\nWorkarounds will depend on your specific architecture, security requirements and other constraints. However, options include:\n# Whitelist requests from JIRA to itself to allow anonymous requests\n# If your authentication system supports it, use a plugin inside JIRA (rather than handling requests at the reverse proxy level) Moving the authentication to JIRA will allow it to correctly handle anonymous requests from itself.",

Similar to what is currently available for user stories (once you open the user story). A drawback in adoption is Program Managers not having control of any modification on features after great deal of time investment in various rounds of discussions with stakeholders. This is why they still prefer to use spreadsheets, to keep the \" latest\" version saved. Hope this helps. Let me know if need more clarification.",
