[See the corresponding bug report|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSDCLOUD-4182].\n  {panel}\n\nh3. Summary\r\n\r\nThe 'resolution' field is not indexed by JIRA when hidden. This has two main consequences in Service Desk reports:\r\n# The 'resolved' series in reports, such as Created vs Resolved don't show issues in this case\r\n# If an issue is resolved while the resolution is hidden, if we change it to 'show', these issues are not shown in report as resolved, unless system is re-indexed\r\n\r\nh3. Environment\r\nVersion: 3.3.0-OD-1000.212.0\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Create an SD project\r\n# Make resolution hidden in Fields Configuration\r\n# Create tickets and resolve them\r\n# Check Created vs Resolved reports\r\n# Make resolution visible again \r\n# Check Created vs Resolved reports\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nThe resolve tickets show in report both in steps 4 and 6.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nBoth won't show any resolved issues. \r\n \r\nh3. Notes\r\nThere's a similar bug [here|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRA-38224]. \r\n\r\nNotice that you resolve a ticket *before hiding the field*, hide it and show it again, the ticket will show once the field is not hidden. That's probably because it was indexed by resolution, since it was visible when the ticket was resolved.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if you resolve the ticket *while the field is hidden*, it won't show unless you run a re-index.\r\n\r\nAlso, re-indexing while the field is hidden is useless and may just remove the existing indices for tickets created before it was hidden.\r\n\r\nh3.Workaround\r\nIf you need to see the field in reports:\r\n# Make it visible again\r\n# Lock JIRA and re-index\r\n# Keep it visible (otherwise, the problem will occur again)\r\n# If you don't want users to see/edit this field, simply remove it from screens (Created/View/Edit)",

However, this is not ideal as if forgotten or not done, then the issue is not viewable via the customer portal and so the issue could potentially be stuck waiting for customer but the customer has no visibility on it.\r\nh3.

Just as well each customer has different SLA and KPI and the JSD features are perfect for tracking this.  Therefore would like to know if JSD would consider separating SLA breach tracking into a separate module that can priced differently (perhaps similar to tempo plugins).\r\n\r\nI understand that I could purchase JSD and have all my engineers and the customers acting as agents, but the pricing for that is just too high.

Summary\r\n\r\nThe approver doesn't get any other notification than the one to approve the ticket even if they are\u00a0also set as the request assignee and are\u00a0watching the request as well.\r\n\r\nAlso after removing that user\u00a0as the approver, still no notifications are sent to them.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\nh3. Environment\r\n\r\nReproduced on JIRA Cloud version: 1000.245.1\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n*Case 1:*\r\n # In JIRA Service Desk create a service request that needs approval (e.g. purchase request)\r\n # Set the same user as approver, assignee and watcher\r\n # Add couple of comments to the request (internal and public)\r\n\r\n*Case 2:*\r\n # In JIRA Service Desk create a service request that needs approval (e.g. purchase request)\r\n # Set the same user as assignee and watcher\r\n # Add couple of comments and see that you get the notifications for those comments\r\n # Add the same user as the approver for the request\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nIn both cases the expected result is that the user get notifications for all the comments and status changes\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\n*Case 1:*\r\n - The user only receives the notification that the request needs approval\r\n\r\n*Case 2:*\r\n - The user receives the notifications up until step #3. Then, after getting the approval notification they\u00a0stop getting any other notification\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\nh3. Notes\r\n\r\nIf you approve the request, then removing the user as the approver does not fix the issue since the user is still set as the one that approved the request.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nNone at the moment.",

This is not acceptable as it creates duplicate issues and we will mess with time-tracking.\r\n\r\n*Desire outcome*\r\n\r\nExtend the Service Team Member permissions to include the following items:\r\n\r\n1.

Problem Definition\r\nAs a Service Desk Agent/Admin, sometimes it's important to notify the customer about a breached \"due date\" that can be specified on specific customer cases, differently from the SLA, which's a predefined value for all issues in a given SLA.\r\nCurrently, there isn't a way to manually customise the SLA for each issue created like one can do for the \"due date\" date field, as it would require an incredible amount of re-work.\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\nIt would be a good idea if the SLA fields could inherit, or be based on, other fields values which the user manually sets. \r\nProviding an option for the Agent/Admin to decide in which field he wants his SLA to be based on would be a good idea.\r\n \r\nh3. Workaround \r\nNot available for now.",

Current Situation\r\n\r\nWhen an image/attachments with the similar file name is being attached to a comment. The previous comment with inline image/attachments will be pointed to the latest updated image.\r\n\r\nh2. Use Case\r\n\r\nAt a support/helpdesk environment, user does not have control over the mail client that the customers use. Which in most of the case, image/attachments are pasted directly to the body of the mail. Causing the default file naming to be identical. \r\n\r\nThis has seriously crippled the usability of Service Desk as the old comments (with similar file name) no longer represents the state that it should be in. \r\n\r\nTo add to the pain, the incoming mail is being deleted upon creation. That removed the reference to track back and it causes confusion especially on a long running case where 4-5 inline image is added. They can only rely on the time recorded when the issue is added to reference it back.\r\n\r\nh2. Proposed Solution\r\n\r\nTo have the ability to configure the attachments to be appended with time stamp. There should be a toggle in project level so that user get to choose if this only applies to specific projects.\r\n\r\nAlso could consider wiki markup with a timestamp column, to place that information to point the attachment to the right one.",

Problem Definition\r\nAs an agent, I often need to reference different cases in my JIRA Service Desk issue to the customer. My general workflow is: \r\n# I have an 'original' issue with a customer, and want to link another.\r\n# Locate the issue though the JIRA issue navigator. \r\n# Identify the affected issue, open it up and get the customer portal URL. \r\n# Copy this link, and then paste this into the original issue.\r\n\r\nThis is is not a seamless experience for the agent. It would be easier to just copy the link from the issue navigator, and paste it in. \r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\nIdeally, it would be good if JIRA just understood what permissions a user had and then direct the user accordingly if they are already logged in as a customer, but don't have JIRA access.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround \r\nAs mentioned above additional steps to get the correct link. \r\nAnother workaround would involve using Text Expansion software that can automatically convert text in one format to another based on a script.",

Create a service desk project.\r\n3. Link a Confluence space to the SD project (e.g. use the Demonstration Space)\r\n4. Create an issue in the service desk project having a summary that matches a Confluence page name (as the summary is used by the KB panel to run a Confluence page search to find KB articles). The KB panel should show a related article (at least) being the Confluence page mentioned previously.\r\n5. Apply a label on the current issue that isn't on any Confluence page of the KB space, \"unexisting-label\" for example\r\n\r\nh3. Expected results\r\nJIRA issue labels shouldn't affect the Confluence pages returned in the KB panel, so applying any labels shouldn't affect the related articles list there (indeed, labels configured in the \"Auto-search on request forms\" section of the KB settings page should only restrict Confluence page search using the configured labels in the customer portal on request type form pages KB suggestions (and filtering out pages not having the configured labels) and nowhere else)\r\n\r\nh3. Actual results\r\nThe JIRA issue labels are used in the KB search and make the panel related articles list being empty, same for the the KB panel search feature.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\nTemporarily removing issue labels filtering out expected Confluence pages result should fix KB panel search.",

It will be desirable to have this feature implemented for both JEPP and JIRA Mail Handler, hence the creation of this feature request ticket.\r\n\r\nh2. Current Situation\r\n\r\nWhen an image/attachments with the similar file name is being attached to a comment. The previous comment with inline image/attachments will be pointed to the latest updated image.\r\n\r\nNotice - this applies also to attachments pasted directly from the clipboard (i.e. take a screen shot 1, then paste into the attachment area of the ticket, then take another screen shot and paste into the same area; while at first the thumbnails will look different, on hitting 'submit' button the thumbnails will change to show only 1 attachment)\r\n\r\nh2. Use Case\r\n\r\nAt a support/helpdesk environment, user does not have control over the mail client that the customers use. Which in most of the case, image/attachments are pasted directly to the body of the mail or in the ticket on the customer portal, causing the default file naming to be identical (image.png) and this causes that all the previous thumbnails added will change to the latest image added with that name.\r\n\r\nThis has seriously crippled the usability of JIRA as the old comments (with similar file name) no longer represents the state that it should be in. \r\n\r\nTo add to the pain, the incoming mail is being deleted upon creation. That removed the reference to track back and it causes confusion especially on a long running case where 4-5 inline image is added. They can only rely on the time recorded when the issue is added to reference it back.\r\n\r\nh2. Proposed Solution\r\n\r\nTo have the ability to configure the attachments to be appended with time stamp, there should be a toggle in project level so that user get to choose if this only applies to specific projects or to generate a random name for each image pasted.

For this to work, we do need the following information, which we are currently grabbing from private API's. This lead to some problems for cloud systems recently, so it'd be great if you could add this to the official API.\r\n\r\nWhat we use:\r\n- Groups of the RequestTypes. This is not exposed via the offical API yet. We currently use:\r\n/rest/servicedesk/1/servicedesk/<portalKey>/request-types (recently broke, throws 404)\r\n/rest/servicedesk/1/servicedesk/<portalKey>/groups\r\n/rest/servicedesk/1/servicedesk/<portalKey/groups/<groupId>/request-types\r\n\r\nIn addition to the groups, which are not exposed via the official call, the assigned issue type is also missing (which we need to render our form). Would be great if these two things could be added here:\r\n/rest/servicedeskapi/servicedesk/<serviceDeskId>/requesttype\r\n\r\nThanks!",

Alternatively, simply make it so that notifications to Agents in for Service Desk issues use the queue link when queues are defined.\r\n\r\nThe goal here being that when an agent clicks on a link in their email they see the issue in the Queue view, when appropriate, rather than the more generic Issue browsing view.\r\nh3.

Summary\r\nWhen the Application link between JIRA Service Desk and Confluence is configured to use OAuth (without impersonation) it makes all requests anonymously.

Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Link a JIRA Service Desk instance with a Confluence instance and configure the link to use OAuth (without impersonation).\r\n# Create a Service Desk project\r\n# Create a link under Project Settings > Knowledge Base to a space on the Confluence instance in step 1\r\n# Go to the issue view for any issue in the project\r\n# Click the \"create an article\" link from the KB Panel or the \"Create KB Article\" button to open the dialog.\r\n# Fill in the form and click \"Create\"\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nThe user is taken to the Confluence editor to create a page.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nThere is a 404 error and the page shows \"Page not found\".\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\nCreate the page in the space directly from Confluence using the Create button in the header.\r\n\r\nh3.

However, *if screenshots were included at full size*, then it becomes much easier to read the Description or Comments.\r\n\r\nThe only workaround we know of is having to edit the *Description* or *Comment*, in order to remove the {{\"}}{{|thumbnail!\"}} tag on\u00a0JIRA markup language. The more images a mail has, the more time consuming is this.\r\n\r\nWe want to force JIRA to display all images in issue description to always display at full size. At least, there should be a* global parameter* to set up such preference. I did not find any option in the admin screen for that.\u00a0\r\n\r\nHow do we achieve this ? Please help !",
