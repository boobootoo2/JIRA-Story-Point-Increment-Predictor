Problem Solution:\r\nAt the moment, when we run a GET REST API to get a request type details, the response will be shown like below:\r\n{code}GET /rest/servicedeskapi/servicedesk/{serviceDeskId}/requesttype{code}\r\n{code:xml}\r\n{\r\n  \"id\": \"18\",\r\n  \"_links\": {\r\n    \"self\": \"http://localhost:8731/rest/servicedeskapi/servicedesk/1/requesttype/18\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"name\": \"Monitor\",\r\n  \"description\": \"\",\r\n  \"helpText\": \"\",\r\n  \"serviceDeskId\": \"1\",\r\n  \"groupIds\": [\r\n    \"1\"\r\n  ],\r\n  \"icon\": {\r\n    \"id\": \"10532\",\r\n    \"_links\": {\r\n      \"iconUrls\": {\r\n        \"48x48\": \"http://localhost:8731/secure/viewavatar?avatarType=SD_REQTYPE&size=large&avatarId=10532\",\r\n        \"24x24\": \"http://localhost:8731/secure/viewavatar?avatarType=SD_REQTYPE&size=small&avatarId=10532\",\r\n        \"16x16\": \"http://localhost:8731/secure/viewavatar?avatarType=SD_REQTYPE&size=xsmall&avatarId=10532\",\r\n        \"32x32\": \"http://localhost:8731/secure/viewavatar?avatarType=SD_REQTYPE&size=medium&avatarId=10532\"\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n{code}\r\nFrom here, we could not actually find the key of the request type that is being used for JIRA when storing the Customer Request Type Custom field value in the database.\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution:\r\nTo include the key in the response or better adding the lowercase project key at the front as how it is in the {{customfieldvalue}} table.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\nSee below KB page:\r\n- [How to set Request Type when creating an issue via REST API using /rest/api/2/issue endpoint|https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirakb/how-to-set-request-type-when-creating-an-issue-via-rest-api-using-rest-api-2-issue-endpoint-938041214.html]\r\n",

Problem Definition\r\nStarting with Service Desk 3.3.0 the *Subject* of Service Desk notifications no longer appears to automatically vary with the action being notified about.\r\n\r\nFor example, in JSD 3.1.x, if an Agent resolved a ticket, the Customer would receive a notification with a Subject like this: {quote}[Prefix] Request resolved as \"Done\" #EXAMPLE-3: test request{quote}\r\n\r\nHowever in JSD 3.3.0 this behavior changed and the equivalent action results in a notification with a subject as follows, using the default template: {quote}EXAMPLE-3 test request{quote}\r\n\r\nFor reference the default template is: {code:borderStyle=solid}${issue.key} ${issue.summary}{code} \r\n\r\nThe only variables available for the *Subject* are: \r\n* Issue key\r\n* Issue summary\r\n* Portal name\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\nMake additional variables available to refer to the action being performed.\r\n\r\nThis may not be sufficient, however, as there are cases where multiple actions are placed into a single notification, in which case I'm not sure how that would work. \r\n\r\nh3. Why this is important\r\nFiltering notifications is much easier when notifications for different events carry different subjects. ",

You can read all about how to [set up a knowledge base with Confluence Cloud|https://confluence.atlassian.com/servicemanagementserver/set-up-a-knowledge-base-with-confluence-cloud-1018775526.html] in our documentation.\r\n\r\nPlease note that we're currently looking into a related configuration issue where Knowledge Base articles can't be opened in the customer portal if Confluence Cloud is not configured with anonymous access, which you can track at [JSDS-7175|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSDSERVER-7175].\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\n\r\nCharlie\r\n\r\nJira Service Management, Server & Data Center\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\n{panel:title=Response 15 March 2017}\r\nHi all,\r\n\r\nThanks for your responses.\r\n\r\nWe understand that this is a significant change for some of you. As part of making authentication and single sign-on easier across Atlassian products we have consolidated product access through Atlassian account ([https://confluence.atlassian.com/cloud/atlassian-account-for-users-873871199.html]). This means that access to our products outside the customer portal requires an Atlassian account.\r\n\r\nCustomers can still search for KB articles, view articles, bookmark articles and so on using the customer portal. This does not require an Atlassian account as it's done through the customer portal.\r\n\r\nIf you need your customers to\u00a0*directly*\u00a0access Confluence to browse through KB articles, you can either:\r\n # Make your space anonymous-accessible. This will mean that anyone will be able to browse your KB articles without needing to log in. If you are experiencing issues as described in\u00a0CONF-30161\u00a0then please make sure you have linked your space to a JIRA Service Desk project via Project Settings\u00a0\u2192 Knowledge Base as this fixes the problem.\r\n # If you do not want to make your space anonymous accessible, ie. you want customers to explicitly log in before they can see Confluence, then you must convert your customer user accounts to Atlassian accounts. You can convert them yourself using the instructions on\u00a0[https://confluence.atlassian.com/cloud/select-the-right-account-for-your-jira-service-desk-customers-873871210.html]\u00a0or you can file a support ticket and our support can bulk migrate your customer accounts to Atlassian accounts. Having an Atlassian account does not consume a license.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nJIRA Service Desk Team\r\n{panel}\r\nh3. \u00a0\r\n{panel:title=Response 13 March 2017}\r\nHi all,\r\n\r\nThis is expected behavior. Updating our accounts meant we had to shuffle things around a bit.\r\n\r\nYour agents have a single account for all your Cloud products. But, your customers are special. They may not recognize Atlassian and we don't want to confuse them.\r\n\r\nTo keep your organization's branding on your help desk articles, we recommend sharing knowledge base links to your customers via the customer portal. Your customers can search for and read help articles in the portal, without needing to learn Confluence, and they don't leave your help desk experience.\r\n\r\nYour agents can link customers to this view, and avoid linking them to Confluence. To provide a portal view of articles to your customers in an issue comment:\r\n * View the customer issue.\r\n * Under Related knowledge base articles, select the article to share or select Search knowledge base.\r\n * Preview the article and select Share as comment.\r\n\r\nIf you want your customers to browse all of your Confluence space, we recommend migrating them to Atlassian account. If you migrate them, they can log into your Confluence space, browse the page tree, and read articles. But, they will need to learn what Atlassian is and use our log in and account management screens. We don't recommend this for teams who serve external customers. [Learn how to migrate customers to Atlassian account|https://confluence.atlassian.com/cloud/select-the-right-account-for-your-jira-service-desk-customers-873871210.html].\r\n\r\nAnother potential workaround is to open your Confluence space for anonymous view access, this will allow any user to view your Confluence knowledge base space without logging in.\u00a0[Learn how to enable anonymous access to a Confluence space|https://confluence.atlassian.com/confkb/how-to-give-non-confluence-users-access-to-a-space-779166002.html].\r\n - JIRA Service Desk Team{panel}\r\nh3. Summary\r\n\r\nPortal users cannot access knowledge base on a cloud instance that authenticates via [https://id.atlassian.com|https://id.atlassian.com/].\r\nh3. Environment\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n - On an instance with SSO enabled (id.atlassian.com), create a service desk project linked with a Confluence knowledge base.\r\n - Enable unlicensed access : *Project Settings > Knowledge base > All active users and customers can access the knowledge base without a Confluence license.*\r\n - Create a portal only user via the Customers page in the Service Desk project.\r\n - Let the portal only user log in the portal.\r\n - Access the direct link to the knowledge base article (ie https://<instance>.atlassian.net/wiki/display/SK/KP_Page).\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nPortal only user should be able to open the page.\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nPortal only user will be requested to authentic via SSO (id.atlassian.com).

Problem Definition\r\n\r\n!test.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nA customer saw queues taking up to 20s to load (with 35 queues in a single projects). This was because the count issues method uses jql search using {{LuceneSearchProvider}} in JIRA core to count issues for any queue. Issues for all queues are counted at page load, queue update, add issue and the polling on the queues page, to show the issue count lozenge on the left hand panel.\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n # store the project specific setting using the {{GlobalPropertyDao}}\r\n # currently issue count is done by JQL search in JIRA core\r\n # QueueServiceImpl accepts a bool to shouldCount for queues\r\n # CustomQueuesItemProvider:getqueues provides a true value for shouldCount\r\n # QueueAssemblerImpl:getQueues provides a shouldCount value that is passed through API call and that is false by default.\r\n\r\nh3. New experimental settings\r\nAs of 3.4.2 there will be a new experimental admin REST api available to set whether the queue count should be included on the Queues page.\r\n\r\nA global setting that can be set by JIRA admin is available:\r\n{code}\r\nPUT <contextpath>/rest/servicedeskapi/admin/queues/include-count - true/false body - 200 response (default true)\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nThere is also a project level setting that can be set by either a JIRA or Project Admin.\r\n{code}\r\nPUT <contextpath>/rest/servicedeskapi/admin/queues/<projectkey>/include-count - true/false body - 200 response (default true)\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nNB: If the global setting is off, then queue count will not be enabled for any project, as it will take precedence.\r\n\r\n(!) This is an experimental api and therefore as it may be moved, or replaced in the future, until it becomes public, will require opt-in with the [Experimental-API|https://docs.atlassian.com/jira-servicedesk/REST/cloud/#special-headers] header\r\n\r\n\r\nh3.

Workaround \r\n\r\nFor Cloud, there is no current add-on nor plugin to achieve that.",

Jira Service Management notifications are currently not respecting the [global Jira setting for \u2018email from\u2019|https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiraserver/configuring-jira-application-options-938847824.html#ConfiguringJiraapplicationoptions-settingsGeneralsettings].\r\n\r\nWe understand that this issue can cause confusion for your customers and it is an issue we would like to resolve. Thank you for your votes and comments on this ticket, it has surfaced it for our attention.\r\n\r\nThe related public bug ticket ([JSDSERVER-3597|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSDSERVER-3597]) will be reopened and triaged accordingly - please follow progress on that ticket.\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\n\r\nCharlie\r\n\r\nJira Service Management, Server & Data Center{panel}\r\n\r\nh5. Issue Summary\r\n\r\nI am set *Email from*\u00a0setting to be without exact name, and be always the same (for example,\u00a0+MCC RU - IT SUPPORT+).\u00a0\r\n\r\nUsual notifications JIRA turned off in project. But customer notifications turned on (we like it for easy template editor)\r\n\r\nBut customer's notifications receiving with fullname of the\u00a0operator, who make action.\r\n\r\nHow can i hide operator name?\r\nJIRA SD 3.3.0\r\n\r\nh5. Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n# Create a Service Desk project.\r\n# Go to {{Admin > System > General Configuration}} page.\r\n# Click *Edit Settings*.\r\n# In the *Email from* field, change the option to something else e.g \r\n{code}\r\n{email}, {email.hostname}, (Some Text)\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nh5. Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nJIRA Service Desk would use this setting when it sends out notifications to customers.\r\n\r\nh5. Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nJIRA Service Desk seems to use the username of the person who performed the change whereas JIRA projects respect the change.\r\n\r\nh5. Observation\r\n\r\nAs JIRA Service Desk notification is different from the normal one used by JIRA, could this be because this is hard-coded and this is the expected behavior?",

      "description": "h3. Summary\r\nIf a Service Desk is configured for only \"Customers who are added to the project\" the *Customers* page will still display users as customers (and grant access to the Customer Portal) if the users has the following permissions for the Project:\r\n* Browse Projects\r\n* Create Issues\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Setup JIRA with at least one user besides an administrator\r\n# Create a Service Desk Project\r\n# Confirm that it is set to \"Customers who are added to the project\" for Customer permissions/Request security \r\n# Modify the Permissions scheme to grant Browse Project and Create Issues to the other user\r\n# View the *Customers* page for the Service Desk\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nThe other user is not listed as a Customer.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nThe other user is listed as a Customer, they can log in to the Customer Portal (though with limited functionality,) and this breaks other functionality such as Automation Rules that work based on whether the action was performed by a Customer instead of a collaborator.   Moreover, the Customer can't be removed from the list of Customers via Users and Roles as would normally be expected. \r\n \r\nh3. Notes\r\nI only tested with specific user permissions grants and \"Application Access - Any logged in user\", I also don't know why this doesn't appear to list the admin as a customer, since they obviously have those permissions and then some. Presumably it is overridden somehow by being in a role such as Agent or Administrator. \r\n\r\nh3.Workaround\r\nAdjust permissions not to grant these permissions, relying instead on setting up Agents, Customers, and Collaborators in the \"normal\" ways, detailed in [Setting up Service Desk users|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/SERVICEDESKSERVER033/Setting+up+service+desk+users]",
