No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?\" h5 Section 1.10.33 of \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\", written by Cicero in 45 BC \\n\\n \"At vero eos et accusamus et iusto odio dignissimos ducimus qui blanditiis praesentium voluptatum deleniti atque corrupti quos dolores et quas molestias excepturi sint occaecati cupiditate non provident, similique sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollitia animi, id est laborum et dolorum fuga. Et harum quidem rerum facilis est et expedita distinctio. Nam libero tempore, cum soluta nobis est eligendi optio cumque nihil impedit quo minus id quod maxime placeat facere possimus, omnis voluptas assumenda est, omnis dolor repellendus. Temporibus autem quibusdam et aut officiis debitis aut rerum necessitatibus saepe eveniet ut et voluptates repudiandae sint et molestiae non recusandae.

Rackham \\n\\n \"On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains.\"\u00a0\r\n{quote}\r\n# The above will trigger a notification to Slack which is an expected behavior. \r\n# Edit the title of the page, this will result on multiple notifications spamming Slack.\r\n\r\n \r\nh3.

      "description": "Hi,\r\n\r\nCreating this for an add-on developer:\r\n\r\nJIRA Cloud has the right idea; we can say goodbye to blowing up mailboxes with JIRA emails. The problem is that it's currently impossible to only receive messages I care about, making the integration far less useful than it could be.\r\n\r\nSo what do I want?\r\n\r\nI want to receive Slack messages for events which I care about, namely events on issues I'm watching and @mentions in issues I'm not watching. I also want to control whether all of those messages cause Slack notifications, or just @mentions.\r\n\r\nRight now, @jirabot can't be configured to only send messages for events I care about. If I connect @jirabot using direct messages, for example, I get a notification for EVERY event in a project. Yes, I can customize @jirabot to only send certain types of issues, but the type of issue has no bearing on whether I'm watching it. That's a non-starter.\r\n\r\nInstead of DM, I can create a Slack channel that receives all JIRA messages to avoid the flood of notifications, but that has the opposite problem. Nothing's ever a notification, even if I care about it, so events on the issues I watch never get noticed.\r\n\r\nI think the right solution here is to be able to configure JIRA Cloud to send me only messages that affect me from the get-go, instead of making Slack trying to figure out what to notify on and what not to notify on.\r\n\r\nSide note. One *stop-gap* solution I tried which didn't work was to send all JIRA messages to a single Slack channel, and try to get Slack to create notifications whenever my name appears using Slack highlight words. But this didn't work, even for explicit @mentions in JIRA issues. According to an email I got from Slack,\r\n\r\nOne thing to note: this highlight word limitation [not notifying] is for bot messages which originate from an incoming webhook. *Slack does recognize highlight words from a Bot User.* I'm not sure if you will be able to take advantage of Bot Users in your specific case, but it might be worth exploring. Here's some documentation about Bot Users ([https://api.slack.com/bot-users]) and you can add one to your team here: [https://my.slack.com/apps/A0F7YS25R-bots].\r\n\r\nEven though JIRA Cloud is a bot user, highlight words didn't trigger notifications. At any rate, this would have only been a stop-gap solution, since a highlight word (my name) wouldn't necessarily show up in every message for every issue I'm watching. The right solution is to configure @jirabot.",
