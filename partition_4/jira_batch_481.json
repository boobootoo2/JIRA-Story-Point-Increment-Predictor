I am just wondering what use cases do you guys fall into with this feature request:\r\n\r\n# The user is a JIRA user (not a JSD agent) but would like to raise request for a JSD project from the JIRA side\r\n# The user is a JSD agent and is raising the ticket on behalf of a customer in the JSD project\r\n# The user is a JSD agent is is raising a ticket for themselves.\r\n# Other use case: please specific\r\n\r\nI would love to hear about what use cases you guys have and see what solution we can do to best suit your needs.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nVincent - JSD Product Manager\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSince Service Desk 2.1 we can edit the Customer Request type, but the field is not visible on the Create or Edit screen. I added the field and when I go to Configure Fields, I can check the field. Something is happening (some white space is added where the field should be), but the field is not visible.\r\nI know we can raise a request for a customer throught the portal in his name, but, it should be visible on those screens.\r\n\r\nh3.

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSDCLOUD-1199].\n  {panel}\n\nIn many service desk workflows, a parent ticket is used to represent the underlying problem and once the parent ticket is resolved, the individual instances of the problem need to get updated.\r\n\r\nExamples:\r\n- *ITSM/ITIL*: Many Incident reports may occur when a system is unavailable. This handled by another team as a single Problem issue. When the underlying Problem is solved, the linked Incident tickets should automatically get a comment alerting the agent that they can close the issue - or even just automatically close the Incident issues on behalf of the agent.\r\n- *Developer/Application Support*: Many Support Requests may occur when users hit a certain problem, eg. they can't log in. This may be recorded in a Development project as a Bug. Once the Bug is fixed and the fix is deployed, the linked Support Requests should automatically get updated.\r\n\r\n{panel:title=Update as of 26 November 2015|bgColor=#f5f5f5}\r\nHi everyone,\r\n\r\nThe requested functionality is now available in Altassian Cloud. You can go to automation section and configure it for your needs \r\n(see https://confluence.atlassian.com/cloud/18-october-2015-to-24-october-2015-780870807.html for more details)\r\n\r\nThe pre-configured rule is coming soon, stay tuned to our release notes. \r\n\r\nOnce again, thanks for supporting JIRA Service Desk!\r\nGosha Nguyen\r\nJIRA Service Desk Product Management\r\n{panel}\r\n",

Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nAdd an option to allow the field to be editable by the customer or not. If the field is editable, it should appear in the Create Request screen \u2013 otherwise, it would be read-only.",

This allows Jira admins to select the columns that they would like to appear in their customer's requests list. It also allows customers to configure and order the columns.\r\n\r\nThe available fields are type, reference, summary, status, service project, requester, created date, updated date, due date, assignee and priority.\r\n\r\nPlease refer to our documentation to [learn how to configure the requests list|https://confluence.atlassian.com/servicemanagementserver/configuring-request-view-1095250690.html].\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\n\r\nCharlie Marriott\r\nJira Service Management, Data Center & Server\r\n{panel}\r\nCurrently, the view in the customer portal can be pretty limited, it only shows the summary of the ticket, the status, and the Request Type. It would be great if we could add more fields to that view (as well as operations), for example the assignee, the ability to add a comment, add attachments, and more.\r\n\r\nThere are a few reasons as to why this should be implemented :\r\n * user cant see initial response time and target resolution time in their requests\r\n * user cant see current assignee for escalation\r\n * user cant reopen resolved issue\r\n * user cant evaluate issue (when i have modified workflow with status close&evaluate)\r\n * priority of the issue should be visible if selected",

This is most relevant when they want their users to authenticate via Crowd SSO. Currently, they cannot do this and still benefit from agent based pricing. Crowd does not recognize Service Desk Customers as a distinct and separate group from regular JIRA users.\r\n\r\n{panel:title=Atlassian Status|borderColor=#ccc|titleBGColor=#cccccc|bgColor=#ebf2f9}\r\nAtlassian Crowd is a separate product and therefore if you wish to use Crowd for SSO, you will need to purchase a Crowd license that is large enough for your user base. Customers in JIRA Service Desk, while free in JIRA Service Desk, will consume a license in Crowd.\r\n\r\nA suggestion to to enable both remote Crowd and local authentication in JIRA has been created.

At the beginning of an agent's day, they should be able to see a list of all issues they ALREADY have planned for the day (barring any SLAs that begin and end within that same day). This will allow the agent to easily calculate the 'remaining estimate' and ensure it does not exceed their expected hours worked for the day. If the remaining estimate exceeds the individual's expected work hours, the agent will need to call on collaborators or other agents to ensure SLAs are not violated.\r\n\r\n2. JQL already allows searching for due dates by \"end of day\" and \"end of week\" (or start of day/week). SLAs as essentially due dates (more specifically, due times) so it would make sense that people would need to search by the same criteria.\r\n\r\n3. There is a psychological element for staff to seeing a static 'end point' for the day. This is why teams \"Standup\" - to envision the day before they attack tasks. Even if they continue working on additional items, they can at least hit a major mile marker knowing they've met the day's goals.\r\n\r\n4. Our team uses a combination of SLAs and Due Dates. We find that SLAs are either too limiting or too flexible in certain scenarios. For example - perhaps a service desk agent is tasked with \"Generate XYZ Report by Friday\" (either for a manager or a customer!) - an SLA is really sloppy for this. You're left with trying to calculate the number of hours before the report is due, and then creating an SLA rule to actually make the count down accurate. This isn't practical.\r\n\r\nThus, agents need to include items \"due today\" or \"due this week\" within the same search as SLAs that will expire today or this week as well. Adding \"SORT BY SLA DESC, Due ASC\" to the JQL statement tells agents \"complete today's SLAs, then work on issues _due_ today before moving on to tomorrow's tasks (the next queue).\r\n\r\nThe closest I've come up with is \"SLA <= remaining(8h)\" but this means throughout the day, the agent will continue seeing tomorrow's SLAs, and they will never get to issues \"due today\".\r\n\r\nIn short, I want to have a \"Today\" queue for staff (so they aren't overwhelmed with upcoming requests, projects and misc deadlines).",

This has been tested and confirmed to work in Confluence 5.4.3\r\nWe can however not guarantee this to provide a solution in all cases. As such, we do not support this method, and serves as an ultimate workaround in case upgrading Confluence is no option.

We'll typically review this request in about 12 months time, at which point we\u2019ll consider whether we need to alter its status.\r\n\r\nFor the nearest future we've decided to prioritise other areas of the Jira Service Management roadmap.\r\n\r\nWe hope that you appreciate our candid and transparent communication. You can read more about our [approach to highly voted suggestions here|https://community.atlassian.com/t5/Jira-articles/A-renewed-approach-to-highly-voted-Server-suggestions-for-Jira/ba-p/688117], and [how we prioritise what to implement here|https://confluence.atlassian.com/support/implementation-of-new-features-policy-201294576.html].\r\n\r\nTo learn more about our recent investments in Jira Service Management and Data Center, please check our [public roadmap|https://www.atlassian.com/roadmap/data-center?product=jiraService&status=shipped] and our two dashboards containing [recently resolved issues|https://jira.atlassian.com/secure/Dashboard.jspa?selectPageId=94990], and [current work and future plans|https://jira.atlassian.com/secure/Dashboard.jspa?selectPageId=94991].\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\n\r\nCharlie\r\n\r\nJira Service Management, Server & Data Center\r\n{panel}\r\n{panel:title=Update as of 29 March 2018}\r\nHi all,\r\n\r\nThank you everyone who has voted or commented on this suggestion. Apologies for allowing this issue to remain open for a period of time without a clear update.\r\n\r\nWe've assessed this request and how it may positively impact our broad enterprise customer base. After initial analysis we have decided that we may not include this in our short-medium term roadmap.\r\n\r\nHowever, we\u2019re not closing the ticket at this time in order to garner broader interest for this feature. I understand this may seem disappointing, but we believe it\u2019s important for us to be open, transparent and honest with our customers.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time we\u2019ve been busy and have recently released Priorities per project, Approval visibility, made improvements to automation and also addressed the #1 JAC issue of disabling account verification emails.\r\n\r\nWe will definitely post an update if we prioritize this feature earlier.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThank you for your understanding and support.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n Jira Service Desk Team\r\n{panel}\r\n{panel:title=Update as of 13 Dec 2016}\r\nHi all,\r\n\r\nThank you so much for your votes and comments on this suggestion. We have a few open questions around the design of this feature and would love to hear your feedback on it. We have created a quick survey to capture the feedback:\u00a0[https://vlj0f02d.optimalworkshop.com/optimalsort/p]\r\n\r\nThank you again for all your continuous feedback!\r\n\r\nJIRA Service Desk team\r\n{panel}\r\nh3. Problem Definition\r\n\r\nCurrently, the Help Center experience needs users to be logged in. This feels very counter-intuitive in external support Servicedesk world. We miss opportunity to help customers search our knowledge sources, provide them valuable links to the documentation and other information.\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nLet customers browse portals without an account (login-free portal) in similar fashion to [JSM Cloud's functionality|https://confluence.atlassian.com/servicedeskcloud/blog/2017/04/introducing-the-login-free-portal-for-jira-service-desk-cloud].\r\n\r\nWith a login-free portal, anonymous customers should be able to:\r\n * *Use search*: discover the portal and its help articles via search engines.\r\n\r\n * *Raise a request*: Fill out a request form and provide an email address to track the request.\r\n\r\n * *Receive & respond to email notifications*: The rest of the process works like email support: they get a confirmation email from your service desk, can correspond with agents over email, and get updates on the request status.\r\n\r\n * *Create an account*: They can still finish creating an account in the portal to track the request, but it's not necessary.",
