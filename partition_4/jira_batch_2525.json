Downloads of files through the web interface (from a repo&#x27;s downloads page) are fine.\n\nAs a test, I created a repo with about 250mb (https://bitbucket.org/scottcs/speedtest). When pushing the initial commit to bitbucket, it took only 7m6.44s. I then immediately cloned the repo to a new directory, and that took 34m32.52s. For some reason the download transfer speed tops off between 90-100 KB/s. I am experiencing this slowness on both osx and windows, both using ssh and https, and on more than one bitbucket repo.\n\nI had about 8 other people at my company clone my speedtest repo and they all had times between 2m-8m.\n\nI first noticed the problem when trying to clone our company&#x27;s repo (which is over 1GB in size). I&#x27;ve tried cloning from github, as well, and that is very fast.\n\nI&#x27;m not sure how to further troubleshoot the problem, so I&#x27;d appreciate any help. Thanks.",
