There, I implemented JIRA, training the people and others, so I'd say that I am an expert with JIRA. But now, I am helping another company (Ingelectra S.A.) they need a software for their projects, they need it as soon as posibble, and I talked to them about JIRA, however I do not work directly in this company, I have a meeting once per week and I see your trial is for 7 days. Is there any option to get more days? Is it possible 3 weeks?

In these cases, it's unwise to enable External User Management as customers with writable accounts can't reset passwords themselves. However, customers with read-only accounts, upon requesting a password reset, receive an email asking them to contact JIRA admins. This causes overhead to admin tasks.\r\n\r\nh4. +Suggestion+\r\nIt would be great if JIRA admins can customize the Forgot Password page in a way that:\r\n# customers with writable accounts can still request a password reset link via email\r\n# customers with read-only accounts:\r\n#* will be redirected to a relevant page (decided by JIRA admins) where they know how to proceed\r\n_OR_\r\n#* presented with a message including a link to that page\r\n_OR_\r\n#* the email content sent to them can be customized to include a link to that page",

To address this we have implemented the following changes:\r\n- Disabled invitation of new customers via email To/Cc fields, so only existing customers (i.e. those with an account on JIRA Service Desk) can be invited as a participant to a ticket.\r\n- Limited the invitation of new customers to 5 at one time via the \u201cAdd People\u201d option when customers add participants via the Help Center. There is no limit on the total number of participants that can be on a ticket.\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nIf an existing JSD customer CC a new customer, this new customer will *not* be added as a request participant. It requires manual work by manually adding the new customer in the list of JSD customer list.

Problem Definition\r\nIt is currently not possible to retrieve reports from a service desk project using the REST APIs for JIRA Service Desk. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\nWhen clicking on a report (e.g. customers' satisfaction), I can see (in the developers' tools console) that the endpoint \"/rest/servicedesk/SERVICEDESK-ID/projects/PROJECT-KEY/report/REPORT-NAME\" is called. \r\n\r\nE.g.:\r\n{noformat}\r\nhttps://HOSTNAME/rest/servicedesk/SERVICEDESK-ID/projects/PROJECT-KEY/report/REPORT-NAME?start=1&limit=20&jsonFilter=%7B%22timescaleId%22%3A2%7D&expand=overall&_=1464172480372 \r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nUsing the above url in the browser address bar displays the desired results. This endpoint should also be available to be consumed using REST calls. \r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\nYou can use curl and call (change the limit according to your needs):\r\n{noformat}\r\ncurl -D- -u USERNAME:PASSWORD -X GET -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \"https://HOSTNAME/rest/servicedesk/SERVICEDESK-ID/projects/PROJECT-KEY/report/REPORT-NAME?start=1&limit=100\" \r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\n\r\n*NOTE:* this is not an optimal solution since this is only used internally and it may change without notice.

The workflow is; A ticket is created and classified accordingly.  Impacted teams or department emails/distribution lists are added as requested participants.  The team then uses the \"share with customer\" comment to send out 'public' updates.  Anyone on the teams can submit feedback via the ticket.  \r\n\r\nThe functionality of the requested participant is working our really well for our teams,  however there have been requests to disable this initial email notifying a requested participant that they have been added.  Blasting large email lists with this email seems redundant in this case.  Seeing as we're blasting emails to such a large number of people the teams want to make sure the communication is tightly controlled so that it doesn't become noise.\r\n\r\nIn projects where requested participants are individuals and will probably be more active we'd like to keep the email settings as is.  Changes and outages are contained in their own project and we'd want the ability to only disable the email notification only on that project.",

What is the problem?\r\nUsers who are logged in to Service Desk are able to see KB search results through the Customer Portal, but are forced to log in to Confluence to see the full article.\r\nThis is counterintuitive to customers because they feel that if they can see the search results they are already authenticated.\r\nOnce customers sign in once with their credentials they are able to view articles.\r\n\r\nh2. Who experiences this problem?\r\nThis problem exists only in Server (Server/Server or Server/Cloud - if that is a thing).\r\nOne of the reporting customers is using JIRA User Directory for their shared user base which does not support SSO.\r\nThis is not a problem for Cloud/Cloud instances as they have a shared user base and SSO.\r\nThis is also not a problem if the customer is using Crowd and the JSD and Confluence instances have the same domain as this supports SSO.\r\n\r\nh2. Why does this happen?\r\nSearching and viewing use different auth contexts.\r\nSearch uses impersonation to fetch and return the search results from a Confluence endpoint.\r\nThis requires impersonation to be setup through the Applinks which is what the customer has done.\r\nViewing an article renders an iframe in the page from the Confluence domain which is why it requires further authentication (to get a Confluence session ID).\r\n\r\nh2.
