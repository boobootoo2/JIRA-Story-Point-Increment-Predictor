This increases billable users and bothers customers. Atlassian docs suggest deactivating or revoking access, to free up licenses and mark users non-billable.

Apply this solution to all Atlassian products including Atlassian Access, Jira, Conf, Jira Service Management, Trello, Bitbucket etc.\r\nh3.

Problem Definition\r\nThe SAML givenName and surName attributes are currently prioritized over the SCIM DisplayName Attribute and when a User SAML Authenticates, their Atlassian account Full Name is updated and overwritten with the SAML Value\r\n- https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/ACCESS-747\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\nUpdate the \"Atlassian Cloud\" OIN App in Okta so that the givenName/surName SAML Attribute mappings can be customized\r\n\r\nh3. Why this is important\r\nUsers may prefer their Nickname/DisplayName that is sent via SCIM instead of their givenName\r\n \r\nh3. Workaround \r\nThis may not be practical/viable as other Apps integrated with Okta use the same User Profile Details, update the User's Profile in Okta so that their Nickname is sent as their givenName/surName\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you can configure SAML in atlassian using a generic app in Okta in addition to the \"Atlassian Cloud\" app (for SCIM) by simply changing the SAML settings in Atlassian to point to the new generic app in Okta.\r\nThis trades-off the ability to have both a Jira and a Confluence button in Okta for the ability to disable the givenName/surName attributes in SAML.\r\nPlease note that the email address for the nameId needs to use the same user property as the SCIM configuration used by the \"Atlassian Cloud\" app.\r\n",
