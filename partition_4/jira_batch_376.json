[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSWSERVER-10720].\n  {panel}\n\nCreated due to [support suggestion|https://support.atlassian.com/servicedesk/customer/ghs/problem-report-11881] and [bug report ticket, redirected to support|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/GHS-10678]\n\nI've been investigating problems of interaction between our plugin and JAG, which occurs to a customer, who uses JIRA 5.1. \n\nSYNOPSIS:\nIn a nutshell, the problem is the following: if there is an add-on, which has a {code}\n<dependency>com.atlassian.auiplugin:ajs-underscorejs</dependency>\n{code} specified for context, applicable for JAG's own screens (like \"... /secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=1&view=planning\"), the JAG gets broken (can not render it's views, due to imported underscorejs priority over JAGs own underscorejs).\nThe issues root cause comes from the underscorejs version conflict (JAG expects underscorejs to be 1.4.4, but if there is plugin, imporing underscorejs from AUI, the imported underscorejs version might not be 1.4.4)\\*.\n\nFor me, as for a plugin developer there are such concerns:\n* If I would later on need to render my plugin's UI on a JAG's own page, I will have to either switch to my own no-conflict underscorejs (which would give an additional library to maintain), or to rely on the fact, that JAG uses underscorejs and thus do not import it (which is really a bad practice).\n* (warning: becoming grouchy here) AUI and ADG encourage library reuse\\*\\* throughout front-end applications. If this is a strongly advised principle, why should people make workarounds in order for another vendors plugin (read \"JAG\") to work properly. I mean, there would be a plugin, which needs it's dependencies throughout all the contexts (even for JAG's own pages, as JAG is a great plugin somewhat a standard for Agile project tracking). Should such a plugin's vendor diverge from the concepts and recommendations?\n* Any plugin with underscorejs dependency in the highlighted contexts block the JAG. I believe, that implies, that some plugin developers would stumble upon that incompatibility and would spend quite some time to dig to the issue root cause (this story might document the issue such that it would be searchable)\n\nSCENARIO:\n# run atlas-create-jira-plugin\n# ensure {code}\n<web-resource key=\"foo\" name=\"Bar\">\n        <dependency>com.atlassian.auiplugin:ajs-underscorejs</dependency>\n        <context>atl.general</context>\n        <context>atl.admin</context>\n</web-resource>\n{code} \nin the atlassian-plugin.xml\n# ensure the plugin is able to run on JIRA 5.1\n# run atlas-run against the new plugin\n# install the JAG\n# go to the JAG getting started page\n# configure a project for Agile\n# create an agile board\n# open the web browser debug console\n# go to that board,\n (!)

      "description": "Hi,\n\nWe have been using JIRA Agile / Greenhoper in Development for quite a long time and recently we have introduced JIRA Agile in some Operational Teams like Order Management and Accounting. Due to the nature of these departments and tasks, the estimation and tracking is both set up to be \"time\". The team estimates a task and then books hours against the task during the sprint. Goal is (amongst others) to create a fair workload balance across all agents. Tickets we talk about here have 1/2 day work as a minimum, but can easily be 20days of effort.\n\nThis all works brilliantly for us, but the Teamleaders have issues with Tasks that are estimated to take longer than one sprint (2weeks) and which are therefore carrying over to the next sprint after closure.\n\nIssue is: The remaining estimate is not used in plan mode, but the original estimate is. This leads to the following example: \nOriginal estimate: 10d\nTime spent: 8d\n\nIn plan mode for the new sprint this issue shows up with 10d, which makes it very hard to create a good next sprint, without checking each and every ticket  for the remaining time.\nWhen the sprint has been started, the issue is kind of resolved, because then the remaining time is being used. But this creates the need for scope changes...\n\nWhile fully understanding the approach on \"original estimate\", please provide an option to use \"remaining estimate\" in plan mode. The desired feature would be that the small dot with the original estimate in it (currently) is filled with the remaining estimate. If remaining estimate is not set, then original estimate shall be used.\n\nThis would enable us to plan fair sprints with good workload balance without having massive scope changes during the sprint. \n\nThanks,\nBernd\n\nNative Instruments GmbH\n+49 30 61 10 35 - 1251\n",

      "description": "We have multiple agile teams using Jira agile and we've been using it for a little over 2 years now. The view has greatly improved since GreenHopper days, but we have some a few significant issues that cause our team to have to work around Jira that I wanted to raise to you:\n\n1. Accounting for both hours and story points is challenging: Our team estimates our sprint and measures our sprint success by velocity and story points, but we use hours as a gut check during our planning to understand capacity this is a challenge for many reasons:\n- If we have hours enabled our burndown chart only burns down by hours we aren't tracking, not story points which we want. We need to have hours enabled in order to do detailed level tasking. This makes our burndown chart useless for us\n- On the plan view, when we select an individual on the team to see how their hours line up we can only see the tickets where they are assigned to the parent level ticket. This doesn't work for us as we have multiple team members assigned to subtasks on each ticket it, so we have to keep track on each person's hours on a separate spreadsheet during planning.\n\nSummary of team info on the \"Work\" view\n- Some of our teams are moving back to physical scrum boards during their standups because the \"work\" view is too busy as it's impossible to see what's in a sprint without scrolling down and we want to see if all on one screen.\n- There really isn't a good way to view stories & subtasks. We use the swimlane option of having parent stories across the view with the subtasks showing, the parent tickets always seem to get lost in that view. The ability to customize the work view more would be appreciated. We want to be able to easily toggle between sprint summary view and a detailed level view\n\nAccounting for Story Point Changes & Velocity Calculations\n- If you add / change story points to a story after a sprint has started or add a story with points to a sprint after it's started than the numbers aren't on the sprint report. This is really annoying as I have to click on each ticket that doesn't have a story point listed and do my own manual calculations.\n- Also, I have a whole separate spreadsheet for each sprint team that breaks down the the team's historical performance. This is how we determine the \"average velocity per person on the team per day\" and we used this to estimate the velocity during planning based on the team's availability. Having that as part of reporting would be awesome!",

      "description": "I regularly use the classic agile gadget on dashboards to evaluate the overall progress of large projects.  We typically avoid story points and instead look at solely at remaining hours (hours tab).  So we're looking at the classic agile gadget for a 12-18 month period.  When I look at the red line, it's automatically set to start with the amount of work remaining in hours on the start date set in the gadget's configuration and then is rendered in a straight line where 0 is at the end date as set in the configuration.  \n\nThis is nice for uses where the number of hours on the start date is equivalent to the capacity of your team given some velocity (I run a model for long projects that assumes N developers at M%utilization thereby giving me a capacity in terms of how much available scope measured in time that the team can handle at any date in the project); however, in reality our backlogs are never quite built so perfectly, so what I'd like to do is have the ability to add another line to the burndown gadget that represents the capacity of the team.  This would be in addition to the current red line.\n\nI would want to specify the following information:\n\n1. Start date\n2. Capacity on start date measured in hours\n3. End date\n4. Remaining amount of work left on end date.  It would probably be ok to set this to 0 and I could probably make do with not being able to configure this value.\n\nThen the software would render a line based on that information.  This would allow me to see how I've modeled effort and then as I'm monitoring the team's progress, the goal would be to make sure my green line stays near this model line.  It would also make it very clear if I had room in my model to add scope or if I had to start thinking about cutting scope.\n\nAdditionally it'd be nice to allow hiding of the currently implemented red line.\n\nOne additional problem that the current implementation of the red line in the gadget imposes is that you search for a date in time where the amount of work in the backlog approximates the team's capacity that you are trying to model and you are then not able to see anything prior to this.\n\nI know this may not be how folks intended the tool to be used in terms of long projects with burndown charts spanning many months, but the tool does a great job for this type of project except for the issue mentioned here.\n\nI'm running jira 6.0.8 and have been unable to find anything in the docs for future versions that suggest this is possible.",

Steps to Reproduce\n\n# Restore an instance with a problematic data set (one that has managed to get multiple Sprint fields onto one edit screen in different tabs).\n# Edit the issue and change the sprint field.\n# Attempt to save the changes.\n\nh3. Expected Results\n\nThe changes are successfully sent.\n\nh3. Actual Results\n\nThe changes fail to save and the attached error is presented to the user.\n\nh3. Notes\n\nThis is caused by multiple Sprint fields appearing on the edit screen in different tabs. This appears to be caused by an upgrade task. Additionally in earlier versions the spelling of \"acive\" was incorrect, and has since been updated to \"active\".\n\nh3. Workaround\n\nEdit the screen for that project and remove the Sprint field from one of the tabs as per [Defining a Screen|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Defining+a+Screen#DefiningaScreen-Editingascreen'sdetails]. This will prevent JIRA Agile from displaying this error.\n",
