That\u2019s a lot of developers right there!\r\n* Gradle is the official build tool for Spring.\r\n* Gradle is much more actively developed than Maven. In the last 2 years, Maven has had only 3 releases [1], but Gradle has had over 20 [2].\r\n* Gradle actually supports parallel builds and intelligent caching, resulting in HUGE performance wins.\r\n\r\nI could easily list more examples. I think it is safe to say that even those in the Maven camp would freely admit that Gradle stands with Maven as the two most popular build tools for Java developers. As such, it would be prudent for Bamboo to support Gradle. I, personally, would go further and say that Gradle is quickly leaving Maven behind.\r\n\r\n[1] http://maven.apache.org/docs/history.html\r\n[2] https://gradle.org/releases/",

      "description": "In our setup we are using jira/bitbucket and bamboo tightly together.\r\n !image-2017-10-31-09-58-38-692.png|thumbnail! \r\nWith bamboo 6.2 work have been done in order to make project setup easier with the new project level in bamboo.. However there are lot of work to do still I think.\r\n\r\nIn our setup we cannot share, by default, the projects/deployment projects/linked repositories with everyone. (which are the default settings when creating those, and which typically happens if you give the create permissions to everyone). We want the dedicated \"support team\" to create the \"bare\" setup then hand it over to the project teams with the correct permissions set so that data are only shared to the team. (If the team later on changes the permission, we can live with that, at least it should be correct from the beginning.\r\n\r\nIn our setup each project team will have there own dedicated remote agent running on their server, and we don\u00b4t have any local agents on the bamboo server itself...\r\n\r\nSo looking at the setup for bitbucket, the setup is quite straight forward:\r\n !image-2017-10-31-09-40-19-498.png!\r\n\r\nThe support team creates the project, does some inital settings and hands it over to the team, and the team can create their repositories as they want.\r\n\r\nHowever with bamboo the process gets quite complicated with lots of issues going back and forth between the support team and the project team:\r\n\r\n!image-2017-10-31-09-42-02-125.png!\r\n\r\nAlso if the team later on adds a new repository you would have to go through steps 3,5,6,7 again...\r\n\r\nSome suggestions to make the above process more simpler:\r\n# Add another level of linked repositories. The current one could be changed to global repositories and be kept as it is. Add another level of \"project\" repositories which by default are only visible if you have project permissions. By doing so, the project teams can create linked repositories by themselves without (by default) sharing it with other teams. If global repositories are needed (eg to be shared between projects, the support could create those.\r\n# Add another level in deployment project so that you have for example Deployment project -> deployment plan -> environment. By doing so the team can create new deployment plans (without the risk of sharing it to the world), and also the support team can dedicate the remote agent directly to the deployment project. \r\n\r\nBy doing the above changes, it won\u00b4t be nescessary to go through the support team when a new repository is created in bitbucket. The team would be able to create a linked repository themselves, and also add a new deployment plan. (and their dedicated agent would still be able to build and deploy it since its already been assigned to the project/deployment project.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

However, it would be nice to be able to dedicate agents more generally only for deployment or build plans, without defining specific plans.\r\n\r\n*Use-Case*\r\n\r\nWe are using a setup with several remote agents. We do not use local agents for build plans, because there can be very ressource intense builds that can consume too many resources of the host, which could bring down the Bamboo controller. However, when there are a lot of longer running builds going on, the build queue can be full and deployment jobs need to wait until they can run. This is especially annoying if there are urgent deployments to production required.\r\n\r\nDeployment jobs do not consume any significant resources, as they usually only copy deployment artefacts around and trigger remote deploy scripts. Therefore, such deployment plans could easily run on local agents on the Bamboo controllers. To ensure that only deployment plans can run on the local agents, it would be nice to be able to dedicate agents only for deployment plans in general, without having to modify every deployment plan or build plan with agent dedication or custom capabilities.\r\n\r\nThanks a lot for considering.",

Simply select the plans you want to edit and then Specify the permissions you wish to apply._\" from *Bulk edit plan permissions* located in {color:blue}Bamboo admininstration >> Overview >> Plans{color} section.\r\n\r\nIn Bamboo v6.2, *Changes to permissions* described by [Bamboo 6.2 Release Notes|https://confluence.atlassian.com/bamboo/bamboo-6-2-release-notes-938641951.html] introduces multiple changes to permissions to make permissions management more transparent. At the same time, a new set of REST API endpoint have being introduced (https://docs.atlassian.com/atlassian-bamboo/REST/6.2.1/) providing more flexibility to set permissions at Project, Plan, Deployment, Environment and Linked Repositories.\r\n\r\nHowever, some effort is required from users to build a script to gather the correct IDs (Project, Plan, Deployment, Environment and Linked Repositories) and to set the permission needed.\r\n\r\nBased on that, the feature *Bulk edit plan permissions* (still available in Bamboo above v6.2) could be extended to *Bulk edit Deployment permissions* reducing time and effort users have to expend in such customisation.\r\n\r\nh3. Suggestion\r\n*Bulk edit Deployment permissions*, having the option to select if permission(s) will be granted to:\r\n* Deployment project\r\n* Deployment environment\r\n\r\nDepending on the Deployment selected, present user with valid permissions to be picked from:\r\n* Deployment project (permission VIEW, EDIT)\r\n* Deployment environment (permission VIEW, EDIT, DEPLOY)\r\n\r\nh3.

The next time scheduled deletion occurs, it will often encounter the exact same error. If the problem goes undetected, this can result in a large backlog of undeleted plans which will never be removed until the root cause is resolved.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\nSimulating the problem with manual database updates:\r\n# Create a plan with a plan branch (PLAN1)\r\n# Mark the top level plan for deletion by updating the BUILD table, MARKED_FOR_DELETION = TRUE (manually through the database, root cause of this symptom is not yet identified)\r\n# Don't mark the plan branches for deletion.\r\n# Delete two other plans manually through the UI (PLAN2, PLAN3)\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nDeletion service identifies a problem performing background deletion of PLAN1 (healthcheck notification?) however continues to remove PLAN2 and PLAN3.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nDeletion service will fail to delete PLAN1 and will stop. PLAN2 and PLAN3 will also not be deleted due to the issues with PLAN1.\r\n\r\nOne example of an exception in the atlassian-bamboo.log that has caused issues with the deletion service:\r\n{noformat}\r\n2017-08-09 06:17:29,903 INFO [scheduler_Worker-9] [DeletionServiceImpl] Deleting 20 TopLevelPlan(s) and/or ChainBranch(es) marked for deletion\r\n2017-08-09 06:17:29,903 INFO [scheduler_Worker-9] [DeletionServiceImpl] Deleting PLAN1\r\n2017-08-09 06:17:29,960 ERROR [scheduler_Worker-9] [SqlExceptionHelper] Batch entry 0 delete from BUILD where BUILD_ID=16779486 was aborted.
