In the real world: expedite situations occur, teams have knowledge silos, and delivery decision-making is different from backlog refinement decision-making.\u00a0 Having independent sort order criteria for backlogs and boards helps teams meet many of these needs, and frees the product owner/champion to organize and select work based upon their own decisions.\r\n\r\n\u00a0",

When editing an issue, people tend to think in the order of their team's workflow.\u00a0 The current design appears to show status values in alphanumeric order, which may be very different from workflow order.\u00a0 When reporting on items with filters, ordering by status order would lead to a list much easier to understand and take action upon.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0",

With this capability, you can order your epics by dragging and dropping epics around in the panel. The same order will be reflected in your roadmap and board.\r\n\r\nTo learn more and/or provide feedback about the epic panel, read [our community post here.|https://community.atlassian.com/t5/Next-gen-articles/Improved-Backlog-planning-in-next-gen-with-the-epic-panel/ba-p/1387675]\r\n\r\nThank you, \r\nEmily Chan\r\nProduct Manager, Atlassian.\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\nWhen grouping by Epics on the next-gen board, there is no way to reorder the Epics.\u00a0 This makes it impossible for the dev teams to know which is the 'next Epic off the rank' when picking up new work.\r\n\r\nIf you could sort the Epics on the board, that would solve the problem.\r\n\r\nIdeally, there would be some link between the Roadmap and the Jira board.\u00a0 However, there are cases where roadmaps overlap, making the Epic sequencing unclear.\u00a0 Hence, the primary ask here is to allow the Epics to be at least manually movable on the Jira board.\r\n\r\n\u00a0",

The current client consumes too much resources for too little gain, is clunky and takes a while to render. In addition to that, clicking an issue link in the kanban board does not open it, but instead opens a sidebar that is very cramped. The WSYIWYG editor has its own format, instead of supporting a widely supported markdown. Modals over modals over modals create more headaches compared to a regular form filling out experience.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nFrankly I miss old Jira client.
