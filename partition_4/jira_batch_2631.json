      "description": "*Rationale*\r\nPython is a very popular language and it is expected that Bamboo treats it like a first class citizen, similar to the JDK. The current workaround is to manually configure executables.\r\n\r\n*Steps*\r\n\r\n* Install and Configure Bamboo\r\n* Install Windows Server 2012 R2 (win-agent-01)\r\n* Install and configure an Bamboo Agent on win-agent-01\r\n* Install Python 3.4 and Python 2.7\r\n* Visit the Bamboo website, select the agent and view its capabilities.\r\n\r\nNote than even through Python was installed on the agent, Bamboo does not detect it. \r\n\r\n*Expected*\r\nSince Python 2.x is different than Python 3.x and there are some compatibility issues, it is expected that Bamboo will detect Python as follows:\r\n\r\n* *Python 2.7* - C:\\Python27\\pyhton.exe\r\n* *Python 2.4* - C:\\Python34\\pyhton.exe\r\n\r\nIt is possible to install Python in other file paths.  The expectation is that Bamboo will detect python when installed on linux agents too. ",

      "description": "Consider a very large codebase, more than 10 years old. Currently supported versions consist of code written in Visual Studio 2010, Visual Studio 2012 and Visual Studio 2013. Chances are the next version is going to support Visual Studio 2015.\r\n\r\nNow consider that the repo has numerous branches, e.g. release-v4.5, release-v5.0, release-v5.1, release-v5.5, release-v6.0, release-v6.1, develop and master. Each branch has its own set of dependencies, in terms of Visual Studio, Platforms and Architectures (e.g. 32bit vs 64bit).  \r\n\r\nAlso consider that keeping this in Bamboo complicates configuration, is time consuming, error prone and doesn't allow for use of features (like build all branches).\r\n\r\nAllow for the plan configuration to be stored in the repo, so that it can be versioned with each branch. When the repo changes, read the plan configuration (aka capabilities, steps) from the repo in order to execute it.\r\n\r\nSo the net effect is that Bamboo can still use the right agent to build the system based on its capabilities, while easing configuration by being able to build \"all\" branches.  While the master branch may be using Visual Studio 2015, while release-v5.5 can still use Visual Studio 2012. \r\n",

      "description": "Currenty, Bamboo clones a local copy of each Mercurial repository. When that repository needs to get checked out as part of a job, Bamboo clones the cache repository to create the working directory, pulls changes in, then updates to the revision to be built.\r\n\r\nThe larger the repository, the longer this process takes. We have an 8.75GB repository, with a 3GB working directory. This clone/pull/update process takes an hour.\r\n\r\nMercurial's `share` extension allows multiple working directories to share the same .hg repository. Not only can this save a tremendous amount of disk space for large repositories, it is much faster. Instead of running `clone`/`update` commands, you run the `share` command, which is almost instantaneous, regardless of the size of a repository.\r\n\r\nYou can then run the `update` command on that working directory to update the revision that needs to be built, which even for our 3GB repo takes about five minutes on a clean working directory.\r\n\r\n",

trying to set up Bamboo against *MySQL v5.1* with the wrong storage engine.  MySQL provides multiple installed \"engines\": MyISAM and innoDB.  [MyISAM|http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/myisam-storage-engine.html] is not supported by Bamboo because it does not support transactions or foreign keys.  \r\n\r\nSee https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/BAMBOO/MySQL for options on how to specify innoDB.\r\n\r\nPlease, refer to [Supported platforms|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/BAMBOO/Supported+platforms] documentation for further information on supported databases.",

Or if you can restart and or have a look into it for me.\r\n\r\nFrom reading it could be a permissions issue on the server (although the server is the same one we have used continually. It could be repository permissions - again, we have not altered these.\r\n\r\nWe had a problem a long time ago with server memory, as we had put \",\" in our branch names and they where not expiring. But we have not done this since then, so am wondering if we have to many branches??\r\n\r\nIf you are able to assist that would be great thanks alot.\r\n\r\nAm not sure what version the On Demand is - guessing its the latest.\r\n\r\nAlso could you include stephen.power@wearenova.co.uk in any correspondance as he will be the one in charge of fixing the issue.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nAndy",
