Problem Definition\r\n\r\nBuild plans in Bamboo allows us to create branch plans within to branches in repository from the main branch associated with the main plan.\r\n\r\nWhenever we create a Branch Plan in Bamboo, this plan's repository setting can be:\r\n# Override the plan's default repository and use it's own repository\r\n# Don't override and use the default repository.\r\n\r\nThe current behavior when using option 2 is that all configuration is reused, including the repository branch configuration. The ultimate result is that the branch associated with the _branch plan_ is not used, but the one defined in the _main plan_ and the branch plan ends up behaving just like the parent. The branch associated with the branch plan is ignored.\r\n\r\nRegarding this configuration:\r\n# It's not clear in [the documentation|https://confluence.atlassian.com/bamboo/using-plan-branches-289276872.html] that the branch plan will use the branch from the main plan\r\n# [This documentation|https://confluence.atlassian.com/bamboo/using-plan-branches-289276872.html] says:\r\n{quote}\r\nPlan branches are used to represent a branch in your version control repository, with the plan branch using the same build configuration as your plan.\r\n{quote}\r\n#* This implies that you can use a different branch when creating a branch plan, but this currently can only be accomplished when overriding the repository settings.\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\nChange the documentation to make it clear that not overriding the repository settings will cause the branch plan to not use it's own branch, but the branch configured in the main plan.\r\n\r\nh3.

Problem Definition\r\n\r\nCurrently, the configuration of repositories in branch plans can be one of the following:\r\n# Override the plan's default repository\r\n# Use the plan's default\r\n\r\nOption 1 allows us to actually select a different branch for the branch plan from the plan's default, but it creates a new separate repository setting, which cannot be a Linked Repository setting. \r\n\r\nIf we, for example, change the password or the user, we must change the configuration of the plan's default and all branches that override the configuration.\r\n\r\nIn option 2, we cannot select a branch and the same branch is used in all cases, preventing the branch plan from running code in different branches.\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nI suggest:\r\n# Allow branch plans to connect to Linked Repositories\r\n# Allow a different branch from the one configured in the Linked Repository to be selected (requested [here|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/BAM-16101])\r\n\r\nThis way, we can use the same configuration, by overriding, but still only need to manage one.",

This would enable the user to see all of the Code Commits aka Fixes from the current build to say 4 builds ago for example.\r\n\r\nMore specifically, as a QA worker, say I wanted to review the Code Commits from  one build after the previous build I tested to the current build. Then an example would be: On Tuesday I tested build 764. On Wednesday I came in and saw that the recent build is 771. So now I would like to review the Fixes that occurred from 765 - 771 all on one page. This saves the headache & time of having to click through each build.\r\n\r\nFeel free to contact me if the above is not clear enough or you have some questions on the matter.\r\n\r\nCheers",

Problem Definition\r\n\r\nRight now most of the Bamboo log is present in the catalina.out since it seems to log the whole content from atlassian-bamboo.log plus the Tomcat logs. The atlassian-bamboo.log also logs the content from the access_log.<date> but in this case a bit trimmed. In other words, we have multiple files with repeated information consuming space and also cluttering the specific log content.\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n * The catalina.out should hold Tomcat specific logs (the default log4j configuration should be adjusted for this)\r\n * The atlassian-bamboo.log should hold only the product log (without the access logs, since they are present in a different file)\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround for catalina.out logging\r\n\r\nThe Log4j.properties can be configured to show only the relevant bamboo information in catalina.out",

      "description": "Greetings! There are issues centered around the old way of doing authentication for bamboo (as well as fisheye/crucible) in that it uses a single auth link instead of being able to add multiple directories (including local) similar to how jira, confluence, and bitbucket function. \r\n\r\nOne of the biggest issues is the lack of a local authentication directory. If the singular authentication directory goes down for whatever reason, it is impossible to login using a local account without changing XML and restarting bamboo, which is inconvenient and undesirable.  Also, when using mixed directories of incremental and full sync (normal connector vs \"delegated\" connector), they default to full sync when merged into a single crowd application link. Lastly, with multiple authentication sources we can run multiple crowd servers for redundancy.\r\n\r\nPlease investigate the modernization of the authentication system,  to make it more in line with the other apps. Uniformity really does count for something.",

If you're holding this thread with a post-build script and another job finish, Bamboo will not be able to move on to process the next build result.

These are the ones requested by Bamboo Elastic Instances configuration, in order to spin up EC2 instances on customer\u2019s accounts.\r\n\r\nThe thing is, right now, only user keys, that are static are supported. There\u2019s another method called \u201cAssume Role\u201d, in which every API call is made with a different, disposable key-secret pair. This is the method recommended by AWS, since it\u2019s way more secure and easy to manage.\r\n\r\nOther products that require AWS credentials from customer\u2019s accounts already use this method with great success, such as Datadog and Sumologic.\r\n\r\nThe main point here is: this does not require major changes on your side, only to the authentication part.\r\n\r\nMore information can be found here:\r\n\r\n* https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/delegating-api-access-to-aws-services-using-iam-roles/\r\n* http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/walkthru_cross-account-with-roles.html\r\n* http://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_AssumeRole.html\r\n* http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp.html\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nIt would be useful if the IAM Role could be specified when [Configuring Elastic Bamboo|https://confluence.atlassian.com/bamboo/configuring-elastic-bamboo-289277120.html].",

The Bamboo instance won't spin up an elastic agent that provides these requirements because it's already at its elastic agent limit. Idle elastic agents hang around for up to an hour, which means it can take a long time to get a suitable elastic agent spun up. In some cases, there have not been any agents that can build the job at all, in others there has been one agent but it's busy building other builds. \r\n\r\nThese builds often have 5 stages that take 1.5 hours each, so with one agent, the build can take over 7 hours. If you have 2 builds which require that same agent, obviously you wait a very long time.\r\n\r\nIt would be great if we could do some analysis of which builds need more agents, possibly to try to normalise the time-to-completion, eg if a build has only one agent but multiple stages and is going to take over one hour to complete, terminate some idle agents and spin up some more of the one that build requires.",
