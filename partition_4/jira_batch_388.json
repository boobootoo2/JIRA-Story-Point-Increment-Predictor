I've added estimates to the subtasks. In both the epic report as well as in the planning board, the original estimate values are not populating. I highly suspect this is because the Epic Link field is not being inherited by sub-tasks (as is done for the sprint field). The lack of inheritance is also a problem for reporting against an epic outside of Greenhopper.{quote}\n\nWhile this is explicitly not planned for Planning Mode per GHS-6084, we're wanting to determine if this could be changed for the reports.",

Dragging individual issues around lets me change this.\nHowever, when using filters, the plan mode does exactly the same - namely _showing_ 15 total filtered issues while there are _actually_ 40 issues. Dragging the bar down by 10 adds _at least_ 10 issues, and depending on the filter it may add up to 35 because the bar still adds them according to their order and not according to their *visible* order.\n\nAnd this is the main reason we cannot really use the Rapid Board, being stuck with the old Classic Boards.\n\nUsing the Epic or Version filter for example, we get the planned issues for the version and want to divide them into smaller sprints. Doing that however not only adds issue of the selected Version/Epic, but also ones that are merely hidden by the filter.",
