I would not call the absence of these groups a bug (I&#x27;d change this issue type if I could figure out how).\n\nA potential enhancement that could support the missing piece I describe above:\n\nh1. I create a group on my account.\nh1. By default, the group is not available for others to use and is not inheritable on forks.\nh1. I, as group owner, have the option to make the group &#x27;inheritable&#x27; for forks of repos on which it is used (turning off inheritability would not retroactively affect existing forks).\nh1. I, as group owner, have the option to &#x27;share&#x27; the group, which would make it available to anyone I&#x27;m in any group with (even if they aren&#x27;t in this particular group).\nh1. Clearly this would mean a lot more groups to choose from, so we might need some pollution controls - a user can remove groups shared with them from their view (and perhaps have a way to view those they&#x27;ve toggled off, in case they&#x27;d like to toggle them back on).\nSee BCLOUD-3807 for a related, but distinct bug related to groups.\n\nThe only groups documentation I can find does not discuss any of this functionality, so a lot of the above is based on assumptions for how you intended things to work.\n\nhttp://confluence.atlassian.com/display/BITBUCKET/Managing+the+user+groups+for+your+Repositories;jsessionid=18AB3DAA8C4DF9B22B5D99C856DB7484",

(Ctrl-)Home, (Ctrl-)End, PgUp/PgDn, Up/Down keys almost do not react anymore. Mostly no reaction at all; rarely a veeeery late reaction of the keystrokes. Moving the scrollbar with the mouse is the only option left (but not the fastest one). All other pages seem to behave normally. It&#x27;s not platform dependent, as I experienced it on Win7 and on Ubuntu, using Firefox. (On this page, where I&#x27;m registering this issue, all works well too.)\n\nAnyone any clue as to the cause or solution ?\n\nJohan",

This would have provided an attacker with clone/pull access to repositories with read permissions, and clone/pull/push access to repositories with write permissions. As of 5:53 PM UTC on Sunday, March 4th the vulnerability no longer exists.\n\nWhile no known malicious activity has been reported, we are taking additional precautions by forcing an audit of all existing SSH keys.\n\n=== Required Action ===\n\nSince you have one or more SSH keys associated with your GitHub account you must visit https://github.com/settings/ssh/audit to approve each valid SSH key.\n\nUntil you have approved your SSH keys, you will be unable to clone/pull/push your repositories over SSH.\n\n=== Status ===\n\nWe take security seriously and recognize this never should have happened. In addition to a full code audit, we have taken the following measures to enhance the security of your account:\n\n* We are forcing an audit of all existing SSH keys\n* Adding a new SSH key will now prompt for your password\n* We will now email you any time a new SSH key is added to your account\n* You now have access to a log of account changes in your Account Settings page\n\nSincerely, The GitHub Team\"",
