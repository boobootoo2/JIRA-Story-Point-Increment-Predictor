I was previously running version 1.6.14.\r\n\r\nI also was prompted about a security issue with the mercurial, so I allowed SourceTree to run the update to Mercurial 3.7.3.\r\n\r\nWe integrate with Stash repositories.  After the upgrade, Source Tree would still connect with Stash to indicate branch status in relation to the repository, but when trying to pull the latest updates to the branch, it would not connect correctly (Stash would disconnect for authentication failures that there was a problem with my PublicKey).\r\n\r\nI proceeded to test my connection from Source Tree on my laptop, which was still running the prior version (1.6.14) and it worked just fine.  So I tried refreshing my keys on my desktop with the copies from my laptop and my desktop still wouldn't successfully connect for a Pull.\r\n\r\nSo I tried generating new keys on my desktop and still no luck, meanwhile, my laptop still was working fine.  So I again tried reverting back to my original keys from my laptop and still no luck.\r\n\r\nThis morning, I uninstalled version 1.9.6.1 from my desktop, located the prior download installer for 1.6.14 and re-installed the old version to my desktop.  Without having to make any configuration changes to my desktop - I reattempted the pull and it successfully completed.  I also just checked and my desktop is still using the updated Mercurial as well (3.7.3).\r\n\r\nSo the new version 1.9.6.1 is somehow corrupting the publickey when passing it to Stash - either as a newly introduced problem in this version of the software (again, this is my first attempt at updating SourceTree) or there is a problem when upgrading from 1.6.14 directly to 1.9.6.1 that is corrupting the handling of the PublicKey.",

In the Mac version, however, the same menu entry is actually doing the same as the Actions menu's command: It launches the external diff viewer.\r\n\r\nSo, there's two things wrong here:\r\n1. Choosing the gear menu's \"External Diff\" command does not launch the external diff viewer as expected.\r\n2. It adds a checkbox to the menu, and selecting the command again does not uncheck it, which is also unusual.\r\n",
