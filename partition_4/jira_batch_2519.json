The latter is typically rendered in a monospace font, while the first is rendered in a application-specific way, typically monospace, italics or bold.\n\nIn the Python / Sphinx world, interpreted text is usually used for identifiers, where it is turned into a cross-reference link. This, too, is how I used it for a README.rst file (out of habit).\n\nHence I was a bit surprised to see it rendered using a {{<cite>}} tag, which again (via CSS) results in an mdash being inserted in front of the quoted text.\n\nAnyway, as mentioned, there is no rule as to how it should be rendered, so I guess I can&#x27;t really complain... :-) Nevertheless, I propose that you change it to something more reasonable, such as italics or monospace (and no dash).\n\nExample: https://bitbucket.org/kwi/py2-ipaddress/",

      "description": "I recently ran into difficulty adapting my Git workflow to Bitbucket. I&#x27;ve been using a particular SSH key for my work, but when I tried to import it into Bitbucket, I got an \"Invalid SSH key\" message. BCLOUD-4929 approaches this by asking for a better error description. However, I&#x27;m almost positive this one was a mistake on Bitbucket&#x27;s part, not a problem with my SSH key, and should be addressed at the source. I say this because I was able to use this key in GitHub, and import it from GitHub to Bitbucket, without problems!\n\nSteps to reproduce: Log into Bitbucket. Up in the top right, click on the popdown menu with my avatar icon, and select \"Manage account\". In the right-hand nav, select \"SSH keys\". Click on the button \"Add key\". In the \"Add SSH key\" dialog: under Label, enter: osmith@home. Under Key, copy the key from my id_dsa.pub and paste. Then click on the button \"Add key\".\n\nExpected behavior:\\\\\nBitbucket accepts the key, dismisses the dialog, and shows the newly entered key in the SSH keys list. Git clones on my account work with this new key.\n\nActual behavior:\\\\\nBitbucket takes a few seconds, and then displays an error message below the Key field: \"Invalid SSH key.\" No Git work can be done with the key.\n\nWorkaround:\\\\\nImport the key into GitHub (which succeeds), then return to Bitbucket, come back to the \"SSH keys\" page, and click on the button \"Import keys from GitHub.\" A message is displayed, \"1 key imported,\" and the new key is listed in my SSH keys. Git clones now work.\n\nData:\\\\\nSee user account ods94065 for the specific key that Bitbucket didn&#x27;t like. It is a DSA key, which I believe I created via openssh on a Mac by running &#x27;ssh-keygen -t dsa&#x27;. The key name is \"ods94065@hawk.arvixe.com\".",
