      "description": "The documentation state the following:\n{quote}A Cumulative Flow Diagram (CFD) is an area chart that shows *work-in-progress* for a product, version or sprint. The horizontal x-axis in a CFD indicates time, and the vertical y-axis indicates cards (issues). Each coloured area of the chart equates to a workflow status (i.e. a column on your board).{quote}\nFrom the above, it is understand that CFD should show the work-in-progress for a sprint whereby it should show the current sprint. However, in GreenHopper 6.1.0, it does not behave that way. The current behaviour for CFD is with the filter of {{Sprint is not EMPTY}}. Suprisingly, it is the same as what [\"Anonymous\" commented/requested|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/GH/Viewing+the+Cumulative+Flow+Chart?focusedCommentId=311034351#comment-311034351] to have the reports showing the entire relase and not only the current sprint.\n\nPlease update the documentation to the correct and expected behaviour for Cumulative Flow Diagram as this brings confusions to both sides.",

I think previous versions (with JIRA 4.3 if my memory serves me well) was more intuitive. Why Kanban doesn't have a burndown chart? Why can't I create new cards in Kanban board as freely as in classic one? SCRUM board may be good for SCRUM teams, but for others it's enforcing alien methodology. But only SCRUM board has burndown chart... I can't understand reasoning behind such decision.\n\nI use greenhopper for \"casual projects\" - projects with very limited spare resources. For \"casual project\" to stay alive the only thing is needed - steady progress. Classic boards allow me to plan ahead release of next version and tie it to exact date i.e. next meeting. There are always much more features out there than I can implement with what resources I have now. Burndown chart in classic boards of greenhopper helps me release new version within deadline with all features possible. As long as I'm comfortible with required burndown rate, I can freely plan new features.\nAttached is my typical burndown chart for \"casual project\".\n\nSo long story short, I want to have classic burndown chart in Kanban board.\n\"+ New card\" button in kanban board would be nice bonus too.",

[See the corresponding bug report|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSWSERVER-6927].\n  {panel}\n\nIf a user has deleted the original Epic issue type, and deleted all other issue types above Issue ID 6 and then creates a new Issue type (for example Sub Task) so that it has Issue ID 6, Greenhopper will use that new issuetype as the Epic issue type. \n\nThis causes all issues with Issue ID 6 (in the example: subtasks) to appear on the Epic listing on the left of the Scrum board. Even if the user has created a new Epic issue type.\n\nAdding the feature to select which Issue ID is associated with would help resolve this, as to at the moment an SQL query has to be run to change the epic Issue ID.\n\nh3. Workaround\n# Backup the instance to XML.\n# Install the XML into a test instance.\n# Add any missing Issue Types, such as the Epic, Story & Technical Task (this is actually a sub-task) through the browser GUI.\n# Execute the following SQL to identify their IDs in the database:\n{code:SQL}\nselect id, pname from issuetype where pname in ('Technical Task','Epic','Story');\n{code}\n(i) Keep track of these as we'll need them later.\n# Add a Story Points Custom Field (Number Field), ensuring to set the context to Epic and Story.\n# Add it to the appropriate screens (e.g.: default, however this depends upon JIRA's configuration).\n# Use the below SQL to identify the ID:\n{code:SQL}\nselect id from customfield where cfname = 'Story Points';\n{code}\n# Execute the following SQL to get your GreenHopper property map:\n{code:SQL}\nselect propertyvalue from propertytext where id = (select id from propertyentry where property_key ='SCRUM_DEFAULT_TEMPLATE_CONFIGURATION');\n{code}\n# Replace the map with the appropriate Story Points Custom Field and Epic, Story & Technical Task Issue Type. For example:\n{code:XML}\n<map>\n  <entry>\n    <string>gh.issue.storypoints</string>\n    <string>customfield_18008</string> <!-- Changed -->\n  </entry>\n  <entry>\n    <string>gh.issue.story</string>\n    <string>36</string> <!-- Changed -->\n  </entry>\n  <entry>\n    <string>gh.issue.rankingfield</string>\n    <string>customfield_10983</string>\n  </entry>\n  <entry>\n    <string>gh.issue.labelfield</string>\n    <string>customfield_10982</string>\n  </entry>\n  <entry>\n    <string>FIELDCONFIG_SCHEME_ID</string>\n    <long>11141</long>\n  </entry>\n  <entry>\n    <string>gh.issue.task</string>\n    <string>3</string> <!-- Changed -->\n  </entry>\n  <entry>\n    <string>gh.issue.epic</string>\n    <string>37</string> <!-- Changed -->\n  </entry>\n  <entry>\n    <string>gh.issue.businessvalues</string>\n    <string>customfield_10985</string>\n  </entry>\n  <entry>\n    <string>gh.issue.flaggingfield</string>\n    <string>customfield_10981</string>\n  </entry>\n</map>\n{code}\n(!)
