Acceptance Criteria\n* The supported setup is \n** a \"Scrum of Scrum\" Board with a filter query that can span multiple projects, and \n** a separate board for every team. \n** How the JQL could look to make the team-specific distinction is unclear. (currently, this could be done with a label; something more dedicated to a team would be nicer)\n* The rapid board (SoS and for every team) shows an active sprint as soon as its filter selects an issue that is currently in a sprint\n** _Note: this is currently working_\n* In the sprint planning, the teams can pull the stories that they think they can complete in that sprint. These stories will automatically be manipulated to match the JQL so that it will show up in the team's specific board.\n** _Note: Manually, this is also sorts of working. By pressing \"l\" I can quickly label an issue with \"team-alpha\", \"team-beta\", etc.); A more automated and/or team-oriented way would be nice_\n* Sub-tasks for the user stories that a team selected will show up in the team specific board (related to GHS-5301). \n** _Note: This is the only part that is currently lacking. The options I am currently aware of both involve extra plugins:_\n**# Auto-Inherit the labels from it's parent\n**# Extend the JQL so that I can query for parent issues. For example: ... OR parent(labels = team-alpha) ...\n\nThis Story is somewhat related to GHS-5542, but with a common Sprint defined for all teams, you gain a more concise reporting and task boards. (I hope...) Also GHS-5410 is similar to this request, as I understand GHS-5410 it is created under the assumption, that you create two different sprints in two different boards in the same project, while this user stores suggest to have a common sprint that works over several boards.\n\nh2. Sprint Planning Flow\n* Plan the new Sprint in the \"Scrum of Scrums\" Board\n** Select User Stories for all teams, include them in the next upcoming sprint\n** Assign the User Stories to a team (label them, or do whatever is necessary)\n* Do the second part of the Sprint Planning in the Team Specific board. Create Subtasks for all User-Stories\n* When all the Sprint Planning is done, start the Sprint in the SoS Board.\n",

This could be because of missing history entries due to changes occurring in workflows after the history is generated. In rare cases, it could be due to a bug in the time tracking in GreenHopper.\n\nI would like to have GreenHopper quickly identify any issue that currently has a remaining estimate that is not possible to reach with the history. I.E. Issue was created with 10h estimate, worked for 4, closed with the post function reducing it to zero. But there is no history marker for the reduction to zero. The issue's current value should be 0 and the history / GreenHopper's burndown data should tell us 6 hours remaining. Because of that difference, I want a red flag on the issue, or a way to find that issue quickly in order to diagnose charting issues.",

DISPLAY ACCEPTANCE TESTS - When you are on the Planning Board and you are looking at a story the story displays on the right hand side of the screen, it would be very beneficial to show the acceptance tests within that view. Oftentimes during our Sprint Planning sessions we review the stories with the teams and then read through the acceptance tests in order to develop an accurate estimate.\n2. CREATION OF STORIES - When creating a story on the Planning Board within the new rapid board it would be nice to easily rank the story that you are creating within the backlog immediately without having to add it and then having to drag and drop it from the bottom to where it's priority should be. Oftentimes, I already know the priority for the story when I am creating it and don't want it to always go to the bottom and then I have to rank it later.",
