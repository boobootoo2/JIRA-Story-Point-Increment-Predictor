      "description": "h3. Issue Summary\r\n\r\nBamboo pages such as the Build dashboard (allPlans.action), Build activity (currentActivity.action) and My Bamboo (myBamboo.action) are very slow to open for uses that don't have the *Admin* permission inside the _Bamboo administration > Overview > Security > Global permissions_ page.\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n{panel:title=Note 1|borderStyle=dashed|borderColor=#6a8eb3|titleBGColor=#f8f8f8|bgColor=#f8f8f8}\r\nIt's important to note that this usually only affects large deployments of Bamboo (e.g. Bamboo instances with thousands or dozens of thousands of plans). If this is not your case you're likely affected by some other issue and should consider contacting [Atlassian Support|https://support.atlassian.com/] to have it verified.\r\n{panel}\r\n{panel:title=Note 2|borderStyle=dashed|borderColor=#6a8eb3|titleBGColor=#f8f8f8|bgColor=#f8f8f8}\r\nThe most common symptom of this issue is that the act of logging in to Bamboo is very slow for regular (non-admin) users. It is important to note that in most cases it is not the authentication process itself that is slow but loading the Build dashboard (allPlans.action) which is the page users get redirected to by default when logging in. A good way to verify whether you're affected by the problem is to ask the user to attempt to log in *and* immediately after that try to access another page inside Bamboo, such as the Projects (allProjects.action) page. If this pages loads up quickly that's a good indication that it is the Build dashboard (allPlans.action) that is slow and not the authentication process.\r\n{panel}\r\n # As a regular (non-admin) user log in to Bamboo. This in itself (as explained in *Note 2*) will be slow already.\r\n # Once the Build dashboard (allPlans.action) comes up try to visit the Build activity (currentActivity.action) or My Bamboo (myBamboo.action) pages.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n * Pages mentioned in this report are loading fairly quickly (e.g. just a couple of seconds).\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n * Pages are very slow to open. This is happening because Bamboo is attempting to run permission checks for all of your plans before it can display the ones that the user trying to load the page has access to. It's hard to be precise as the time will vary depending on the amount of plans we have to run permission checks for but we have seen loading times ranging from 25 seconds all the way up to minutes.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nAt the moment there's only one workaround available:\r\n # Ask the affected users to open the Build dashboard (allPlans.action).\r\n # Once it finishes loading click the 'pencil' icon right next to the *Personal filter is on/off* button.\r\n # Select the option *Show only favourite plans*.\r\n # Click the \"Save and apply\" button.\r\n\r\nFrom this moment on the user will have to favourite the plans they want to see in the dashboard (otherwise it will be empty). Bamboo will stop running permission checks across all of your plans every time the user tries to load the Build dashboard (allPlans.action) or Build activity (currentActivity.action) pages. This should have a positive impact in the loading times for the pages mentioned in this report.",

Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Go to\u00a0[/rest/api/latest/deploy/project/578551811/versions?start-index=0&max-result=30|https://deployment-bamboo.internal.atlassian.com/rest/api/latest/deploy/project/578551811/versions?start-index=0&max-result=30]\r\n # try with different max-result values and the time to respond is always the same.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nResults contain 30 releases and responds in less than 10 seconds.\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nRequested versions are returned after 40 seconds\r\n{noformat}\r\n{ size:\u00a04091,\r\n  + versions:\u00a0[]\r\n...\r\n  start-index:\u00a00,\r\n  max-result:\u00a030\r\n}{noformat}\r\nh3. Notes\r\n\r\nEndpoint documentation doesn't say pagination is supported:\u00a0[https://docs.atlassian.com/atlassian-bamboo/REST/6.9.2/]\u00a0but the page [/deploy/viewDeploymentProjectVersions.action?id=578551811|https://deployment-bamboo.internal.atlassian.com/deploy/viewDeploymentProjectVersions.action?id=578551811]\u00a0tries to paginate with infinite scroll using the REST call\u00a0[/versions?start-index=0&max-result=30|https://deployment-bamboo.internal.atlassian.com/rest/api/latest/deploy/project/578551811/versions?start-index=0&max-result=30]\u00a0and that is probably the cause of taking 40 seconds to do each scroll.\r\n\r\nThe search/versions endpoint does pagination but still takes 40 seconds so it may be using the same unpaginated code in the back. e.g:\u00a0[/search/versions?searchTerm=JF-PROD&chronologicalOrder=true&deploymentProjectId=578551811&start-index=0&max-result=30|https://deployment-bamboo.internal.atlassian.com/rest/api/latest/search/versions?searchTerm=JF-PROD&chronologicalOrder=true&deploymentProjectId=578551811&start-index=0&max-result=30]\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nCurrently there is no known workaround for this behaviour. A workaround will be added here when available.",

Actual Results\r\n\r\nWhen terminating the setup of the Linked repository to AWS CodeCommitand pressing button \"Test connection\" on the end of this configuration page, connecting to the repository is not possible getting message pop-up saying \"Fatal: Unable to access and error 403.\r\n\r\nThis happens because Bamboo inserts\u00a0the username and '@' specified into the URL which AWS CodeCommit is apparently not accepting.\r\n\r\nThis is common Bamboo procedure and e.g. works perfectly like that for Bitbucket Cloud or GitHub.\r\nh3. Notes\r\n\r\nWhen running _git clone_ from command-line on the box hosting Bamboo Server, with the same username and password but without username and '@' before the AWS CodeCommit URL, things work fine. Please see below.\r\n{noformat}\r\nbamboo@ip-10-0-0-154:/tmp$ git clone https://git-codecommit.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/v1/repos/WTOP-Docker-build\r\n Cloning into 'WTOP-Docker-build'...\r\n Username for 'https://git-codecommit.us-east-1.amazonaws.com': bamboo-wtop-at-498104006619\r\n Password for 'https://bamboo-wtop-at-498104006619@git-codecommit.us-east-1.amazonaws.com': \r\n remote: Counting objects: 8527, done.\r\n Receiving objects: 100% (8527/8527), 38.21 MiB | 6.28 MiB/s, done.\r\n Resolving deltas: 100% (2048/2048), done.\r\n Checking connectivity... done.{noformat}\r\nInserting the username like Bamboo Server does and running the same git clone, re-prints the same error message and errro 403 as Bamboo does when setting up the\u00a0 Linked repository for AWS CodeCommit. So it fails as shown below.\r\n{noformat}\r\nbamboo@ip-10-0-0-154:/tmp$ git clone https://bamboo-wtop-at-498104006619@git-codecommit.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/v1/repos/WTOP-Docker-build/\r\n Cloning into 'WTOP-Docker-build'...\r\n fatal: unable to access 'https://bamboo-wtop-at-498104006619@git-codecommit.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/v1/repos/WTOP-Docker-build/': The requested URL returned error: 403{noformat}\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n # Use git commands from out of a Bamboo Script task and within those, only use the AWS CodeCommit URL, without username (as of the above note)\r\n # You might use the SSH protocol and credentials for setting up a Linked repository for AWS CodeCommit. THough to succeed, you need toto configure: ~/.ssh/config, according to \"SSH to codecommit: Step 3 #7\" as of\r\n [Setup Steps for SSH Connections to AWS CodeCommit Repositories on Linux, macOS, or Unix|https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codecommit/latest/userguide/setting-up-ssh-unixes.html]",

Workaround\r\n{panel:title=Workaround 1}\r\nYou could re-enable the remote trigger on the main plan configuration. The side effect will be that the main plan will trigger if there are changes on the branch it's pointed to at *Plan Configuration >> Repositories* whenever Bitbucket gets changes on a branch.\r\n{panel}\r\n{panel:title=Workaround 2}\r\nYou could *Disable* the main plan at *Plan Configuration >> Actions >> Disable plan*. This means that the main plan will be skipped in the change detection process, and only branches that inherit the remote trigger or override it to have a remote trigger will be checked.\r\n\r\nLimitations:\r\n* If you only want a limited number of branch plans to be checked you would need to override the trigger on the plans you *don't* want to be triggered and remove the trigger.\r\n* You can no longer build the main plan without re-enabling it. You could also create a branch plan that points to the same branch as the main plan if you wanted to build that.\r\n{panel}\r\n{panel:title=Workaround 3}\r\nYou could abandon the remote trigger and override the branch plan trigger to *Repository Polling* instead. Bamboo will then reach out and check for changes periodically/on a schedule and not rely on the inbound web hook.\r\n{panel}",

The following\u00a0 KB is explaining the situation: [\"Number of Tests\" report is blank|https://confluence.atlassian.com/bamkb/number-of-tests-report-is-blank-935564988.html], so at least it's clear why this is happening.\r\nh3.

My notes\r\n\r\n* The wording of the error message in the final stage's build logs is confusing. If the artifact was \"non required\", why did the build fail? \r\n* The \"Required\" checkbox for artifacts states that \"Build fails if the artifact cannot be published.\" However, the job that generates the artifact actually does fail? That's a mismatch of expectations :(\r\n\r\nBamboo seems to be torn between making builds fail loudly vs. allowing builds to continue when some data is absent. My expectation was that by unticking \"required\" on an artifact definition, any subsequent subscriptions to that artifact would work (as in, silently ignore the non-existence of it). It seems the Bamboo team's thinking does not match mine. I can appreciate that the intention is probably that builds fail if \"unexpected\" things happen, but this artifact is definitely optional as far as my build is concerned; it can cope just fine without it and I would expect the build to pass accordingly. \r\n\r\nI'd be interested in workarounds, but I'd also be keen to see the behaviour (or at least the wording) become less confusing.
