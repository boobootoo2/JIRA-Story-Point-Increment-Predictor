      "description": "h3. Issue Summary\r\n\r\nThe *Pause* condition of an SLA is not respected if the 3 following conditions are met:\r\n- the SLA is configured with \"status A\" as a pause condition\r\n- a ticket was transitioned from \"status A\" to the same \"status A\"\r\n- the SLA configuration has been updated by adding a new status \"status B\" as a pause condition\r\n\r\nIn such case, after the SLA recalculation has completed, the SLA will be ticking in that ticket instead of being paused.\r\n\r\nh3. Environment\r\n\r\nThis bug was replicated in JSD 4.13.0, and reported by a customer in JSD 4.14.1.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to replicate\r\n\r\n# Create a new JSD project\r\n# Edit the default workflow \"Service Request Fulfilment workflow for Jira Service Desk\", so that any status can be transitioned to the status \"Waiting for Support\"\r\n !Step1.png|thumbnail! \r\n# Configure the SLA \"Time to first Response\" to pause when a ticket enters the status \"Waiting for Support\"\r\n !Step2.png|thumbnail! \r\n# Create a new ticket of type \"Service Request\", and verify that the \"Time to first Response\" is paused (since the ticket entered right away the status \"Waiting for Support\")\r\n !Step3.png|thumbnail! \r\n# Wait for a few minutes\r\n# Transition the ticket from the status \"Waiting for Support\" to \"Waiting for Support\"\r\n# Verify that the SLA \"Time to first Response\" is still paused\r\n !Step4.png|thumbnail! \r\n# Update the SLA configuration by adding an additional status to the pause condition\r\n !Step5.png|thumbnail! \r\n# Wait for the SLA recalculation to complete, and go back to the ticket created earlier\r\n# Check the status of the SLA \"Time to first Response\"\r\n\r\nh3. Expected results\r\n\r\nThe SLA \"Time to first Response\" should still be paused\r\n\r\nh3. Actual results\r\n\r\nThe SLA \"Time to first Response\" is now ticking:\r\n !Step7.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\nChecking the SLA Audit logs for this ticket, we can see that the SLA should have been paused\u00a0since its creation time as per the logs:\r\n !Step6.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\nh3. Notes\r\n\r\nh4. Note 1\r\n\r\nAfter updating the SLA configuration, if the ticket is transitioned again to the same status \"Waiting for Support\", the SLA is paused, but the remaining time of the SLA is incorrect. The SLA assumes that times has passed and that the remaining time does not equal the goal set for this ticket. However, the ticket entered the status \"Waiting for Support\" since its creation, so the remaining time of the SLA should equal the goal (set to 8h in this example):\r\n !Step8.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\nChecking the SLA audit logs, we can now see 2 consecutive \"PAUSE\" events, and only the most recent one is being taken into consideration for the SLA remaining time:\r\n !Step9.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\nChecking the SLA JSON data for that particular ticket, we can see that only the most recent PAUSE event was taken into account, and that the earlier PAUSE events were ignored:\r\n{code}\r\n\"timeline\": {\r\n    \"events\": [\r\n        {\r\n            \"date\": 1613491378030,\r\n            \"dateString\": \"2021-02-16T16:02:58.030Z\",\r\n            \"types\": [\r\n                \"START\"\r\n            ]\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n            \"date\": 1613491790255,\r\n            \"dateString\": \"2021-02-16T16:09:50.255Z\",\r\n            \"types\": [\r\n                \"PAUSE\"\r\n            ]\r\n        }\r\n    ]\r\n},\r\n{code}\r\n\r\n\r\nh4. Note 2\r\n\r\nThis bug seems to be a \"cousin\" of the existing bug https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSDSERVER-6671\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nNo workaround known so far.\r\n\r\nEven the\u00a0SLA reconstruction API call from [this KB article|https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirakb/missing-or-corrupted-sla-data-in-jira-service-desk-828790603.html]\u00a0 won't fix the SLA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

However, if the transition verbiage is too long, the customer is unable to read the full messaging as the text runs off the screen.\r\nh2. Suggested Solution\r\n * On the customer transition screen, change the full transition text that runs off the screen to a basic 'Save' option. Since the text is already at the top of the transition screen, there's no real need for it to also be at the bottom of the screen. If this was updated to a basic 'Save' option, I think it might be a simple implementation while providing a much cleaner look and feel.\r\n\r\nh2.

Issue Summary\r\n\r\nOpen Request and Closed\u00a0Request count is \"0\" in 'Customers' page when switching user profile to a non English language, and if the \"Customer Request Type\" field has been manually translated for that language.\r\n\r\nh3. Note\r\n\r\nThis bug was replicated in Jira 8.13.0 (Service Desk 4.13.0), but it might also impact older versions too (Jira 7.x / Service Desk 3.x).\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to replicate\r\n\r\n- Install Jira 8.13.0 with Service Desk 4.13.0\r\n- Go to *\u2699 > Issues > Custom Fields*, and note that the *Customer Request Type* is \"locked\", which means that this field can't be translated\r\n- Follow the steps from the KB [Unlock a locked Jira Software custom field|https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirakb/unlock-a-locked-jira-software-custom-field-779158866.html] to temporarily unlock the *Customer Request Type* field in the database\r\n- Go back to *\u2699 > Issues > Custom Fields*, and note that the *Customer Request Type* is no longer \"locked\"\r\n- Click on *\u2699 > Translate* next to this field, and add a German translation to it\r\n- Create a new Service Desk project\r\n- Create a new customer account in this project\r\n- Create a new Service Desk request in this project and make sure that the Customer Request Type field is set\r\n- Go to the *Project > Customer List* page, and observe that there is 1 opened request for the customer:\r\n !IssueNotReplicated.png|thumbnail! \r\n- Now, change your own profile language to German\r\n- Go back to the *Project > Customer List* page\r\n\r\nh3. Expected results\r\n\r\nWe should see the right number of opened requests next to the customer name.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual results\r\n\r\nThe number of opened requests next to this customer is \"0\"\r\n !IssueReplicated.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\nh3. Explanation of the bug\r\n\r\nTo calculate the number of opened request for a specific customer, the following JQL query is executed in the backend:\r\n{code} \r\nreporter = \"<customer_user_name>\" AND resolution = Unresolved AND project = <PROJECT_KEY> AND \"Customer Request Type\" is not EMPTY\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nWith the example above, we can see that this query will return 1 result (shown under \"Opened Requests\"):\r\n !CorrectJQLQuery.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\nBecause of the bug, if the \"Customer Request Type\" was manually translated to \"bladibla\" for example, then the following incorrect JQL query is executed instead (the translated version of this field name is replaced in the JQL query):\r\n{code}\r\nreporter = \"<customer_user_name>\" AND resolution = Unresolved AND project = <PROJECT_KEY> AND \"bladibla\" is not EMPTY\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nSince this field name is incorrect (the non translated field name should be used instead), no result is returned by this query.\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nThe workaround consists in deleting from the Database all the translations of the \"Customer Request Type\" field:\r\n- Go to *\u2699 > Issues > Custom Fields*, and click on *\u2699 > View* next to the \"Customer Request Type\" field\r\n- Note the custom field ID at the end of the URL (secure/admin/ConfigureCustomField!default.jspa?customFieldId=XXXXX)\r\n- Run the following query in the Database to confirm that there is a translation for this field and for the German lang:\r\n{code}\r\nselect * from propertyentry where property_key like 'jira.translation.custom.fieldcustomfield%'\r\n{code}\r\n-- You should see a row that includes the custom field ID XXXXX and the corresponding locale (for example, de_DE for German). (!) Note the value from the id column. It will be needed for the DELETE query.\r\n{code}\r\n96602,CustomField,10001,jira.translation.custom.fieldcustomfield_10001.name.de_DE,5\r\n{code}\r\n- (!) *Backup your Jira Database*, so that you can revert changes made to the DB if anything goes wrong\r\n- Run the following query to delete the :\r\n{code}\r\ndelete from propertyentry where id = '<id_found_in_the_previous_steps>';\r\n{code}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

So even when we try to set the new password, it won't be accepted until the account is unlocked, which won't happen as the account continues to be locked.\r\n\r\nThe only option here is to either coordinate a time to manually unlock the mailbox and then update the password fast enough that Jira doesn't lock it again, or turn off the mail handler and set it back up after the mailbox auto-unlocks.\r\n\r\nThe problem with this workaround is that any messages received between the password expiration/change and when the new mail handler is created are ignored by Jira SD as it only looks at messages received after the mail handler was created.\r\n\r\nIn order for this to not continue to be a headache for us and our clients, one of the following solutions would be greatly appreciated:\r\n1. Allow disabling a mail handler, without removing it entirely (as the \"Turn off email requests\" button currently does).\r\n2. Allow us to control the \"start date\" that a SD mail handler processes for, so if we do have to recreate it at least we can capture older messages that are marked as Unread in the Inbox.\r\n3. Allow us to force a password change in the settings so that eventually when the account is unlocked, the connection will work with the new credentials.\r\n",

Steps to replicate\r\n\r\n- Install Jira 8.13.0 with JSD 4.13.0\r\n- Create a new Service Desk project\r\n- Configure a mail handler in the JSD project in *Project Settings > Email Requests*\r\n- Create a new request in the JSD project via the customer portal\r\n- Now, send a new email to the JSD Mail Handler by making sure:\r\n-- To include the issue key of the request created earlier in the subject (so that a new comment can be added to the existing request)\r\n-- That the sender of this email is the same as the reporter of the request created earlier (so that this user has the right to add a comment to this request)\r\n-- To include an attachment of size greater than 10 MB\r\n- Wait for about 5 minutes for the Mail Handler to process this email (due to the large size of the email)\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n- Go to the JSD Email Request Audit Log, and observe that the mail failed to be processed with the following error:\r\n !ErrorReproducedLocally.png|thumbnail! \r\n- Check the Jira incoming mail logs, and observe the following error:\r\n{code}\r\n2020-11-26 11:06:18,638+0100 ERROR [] Caesium-1-3 anonymous     Exception when MailHandlerWorker handles message: \r\njava.lang.RuntimeException: Unexpected error while running action as user 'julien'\r\n\tat com.atlassian.pocketknife.internal.util.runner.AuthenticationContextUtilImpl.runAs(AuthenticationContextUtilImpl.java:57) [?:?]\r\n\tat com.atlassian.servicedesk.internal.feature.emailchannel.IncomingEmailServiceImpl.inEmailContext(IncomingEmailServiceImpl.java:504) [?:?]\r\n\tat com.atlassian.servicedesk.internal.feature.emailchannel.IncomingEmailServiceImpl.lambda$doCreateNewOrCommentOnIssueWithMailChannel$15(IncomingEmailServiceImpl.java:185) [?:?]\r\n\t...\r\n\r\nCaused by: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Cannot format given Object as a Number\r\n\tat java.text.NumberFormat.format(NumberFormat.java:248) [?:1.8.0_121]\r\n\tat java.text.Format.format(Format.java:157) [?:1.8.0_121]\r\n\tat java.text.MessageFormat.subformat(MessageFormat.java:1262) [?:1.8.0_121]\r\n\tat java.text.MessageFormat.format(MessageFormat.java:865) [?:1.8.0_121]\r\n\tat java.text.Format.format(Format.java:157) [?:1.8.0_121]\r\n\tat com.atlassian.jira.i18n.BackingI18n.formatI18nMsg(BackingI18n.java:251) [classes/:?]\r\n\tat com.atlassian.jira.i18n.BackingI18n.getText(BackingI18n.java:159) [classes/:?]\r\n\tat com.atlassian.servicedesk.internal.comment.InternalServiceDeskCommentErrors.buildDisplayedAttachmentBlockWithParam(InternalServiceDeskCommentErrors.java:167) [?:?]\r\n\tat com.atlassian.servicedesk.internal.comment.InternalServiceDeskCommentErrors.getAttachmentFailedMessages(InternalServiceDeskCommentErrors.java:144) [?:?]\r\n\tat com.atlassian.servicedesk.internal.comment.AttachmentValidatorImpl.validateMailAttachmentsToAdd(AttachmentValidatorImpl.java:233) [?:?]\r\n{code}\r\n\r\n\r\nh3.

Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Create a \"Select List (Single Choice)\" custom field\u00a0\r\n # Associate it with a Service Desk project and all issues types\r\n # Add this field to a request type in that Service Desk project\r\n # Test loading the customer request form and see that it loads properly and includes your new field\r\n # Go to the custom field page and click *Configure*\r\n # Click *Edit Configuration*\r\n # Remove the issue type for the above request type from the \"Issue types\" list (i.e., select any random other issue type)\r\n # Again try to load your customer request form. If you load the URL directly, it will now be a blank page. If you load the portal for that project and click the link, it will appear to soft refresh but nothing will load.\r\n # This may also affect Custom Fields without any associated projects in the context, regardless of the associated request type\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nThe request page loads properly.\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nThe page fails to load. If you attempt to load the URL directly, you will get a blank screen.

Suggestions\r\n\r\n1. The system should give the user a warning or ask for confirmation before applying the modifications, in order to avoid accidental changes that could lead to this scenario.\r\n 2. The Jira Integrity Checker could find that and fix it, or at least point the need of fixing it to the Jira admins.",

Environment\r\n\r\nReproduced in JSD 4.4.2, 4.13.1, but this issue was probably there in older JSD versions (3.x).\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n- Install a new Jira application\r\n- Create a new Service Desk project\r\n- Configure the Service Desk project with *Public signup* enabled\r\n- Configure a mail handler in the Service Desk project via *Project Settings > Email Requests*\r\n- Configure an LDAP directory in *\u2699 > User Management > User Directories*, with *Read/Write*\r\n- Rank this LDAP Directory above Jira's Internal Directory\r\n- Make the LDAP server temporarily unavailable from Jira, for example by stop the LDAP Server\r\n- Try each the 3 actions below\r\n- *Action 1*\r\n-- Send an email to the Service Desk Mail handler from an email address which is not associated to any Jira user\r\n- *Action 2*\r\n-- Open the Service Desk customer portal (and don't sign in yet)\r\n-- Click the link *Sign up for an account*\r\n-- Try to create an account using an email address which is not associated to any Jira user\r\n-- Click the *sign up* button\r\n- *Action 3*\r\n-- Open Postman or any other API tool\r\n-- Try to create a new customer using an email address which is not associated to any Jira user\r\n{code}\r\nPOST: <JIRA_BASE_URL>/rest/servicedeskapi/customer\r\nbody:\r\n{\r\n    \"email\": \"test@test.com\",\r\n    \"fullName\": \"test@test.com\"\r\n}\r\n{code}\r\n\r\n\r\nh3.

Issue Summary\r\n\r\nMail correspondence not stripped by mail handler when creating new comment.\r\n\r\nThis cannot be consistently reproduced, but it is related to different email clients and the differences in how they format text being used to strip quotes (see Notes section).\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Set up a Outlook / Exchange mail address\r\n # Set up a Email request channel with the created mailbox\r\n # Start creating tickets through emails and responding to received notifications, in order to add new comments on those tickets.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nThe quoted correspondence is stripped and only the latest mail message is added to the comment.\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nPrevious mail correspondence is added to the comment, and this makes comments harder to read:\r\n !image-2020-11-11-14-32-16-197.png|thumbnail!\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nCurrently there is no known workaround for this behavior. A workaround will be added here when available.\r\nh3. Notes from developers\r\n\r\nThe root cause lays in sending an Outlook Application message trough some other client, probably an online one, including Gmail, but it seems to affect outlooks own client right now.\r\n\r\nThe difference is in the standard of encoding text formatting by either ways: Outlook uses an approach called Quoted-printable while Gmail uses some other format. The difference is that the same email sent from outlook in raw Message protocol format wold look like\r\n{code:java}\r\n=20\r\nFrom: Marko =20{code}\r\nWhile sent from Gmail client looks like:\r\n{code:java}\r\n*From:* Marko{code}\r\nWhich is basically the same thing said in different ways, but we work with the raw message line-by-line.\r\n So the problem will occur ONLY when sending an outlook thread from another client to JSD mailbox (assuming that other client is using Gmail approach).",

Workaround\r\n\r\nThe developers of the plugin that notified us of the bug could work around the problem with the following strategy:\r\n{quote}The workaround is to delete the javax.mail.Provider file, so the provider classes are no longer registered and those not instantiated. Instead, we use the old way of having a javamail.providers file in the Meta-Inf directory, which describes from where to load the store/transport classes directly, skipping the whole provider classes.\r\n{quote}",
