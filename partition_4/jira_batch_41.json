      "description": "I have been using Sourcetree on Windows 10 for several months now, and since I started using it it was mouch slower than on Windows 7. With each new version it became more slower and slower, and in the latest version is extremely slow and totally unusable.\r\nI have tried it on two different machines both using Windows 10, and it's extremely slow on both of them.\r\n\r\nThe machines I'm working on are powerfull enough to run very demanding applications (i7 processor, 16GB RAM, Samsung Evo SSD disk).\r\n\r\nHere are some of the actions that are very slow:\r\n\r\n* opening sourcetree - it takes around 2 minutes\r\n* changing to another repo tab\r\n* changing to another repo tab and switching back to the first one\r\n* clicking the commit message box so that I can write a commit message\r\n* changing branches\r\n* pulling and pusshing\r\n* opening a new repo tab\r\n* closing a repo tab\r\n* opening a repo of a submodule\r\n* opening the \"Clone/new\" dialog\r\n* sometimes it just becomes unresponsive without me taking any action\r\n* probably some other actions that I missed to mention\r\n\r\nEach of this actions takes a long time (1-2 min) and meanwhile Sourcetree becomes unresponsive.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time (but very rare) some of this actions work without any slowness.\r\nI have tried to uncheck this options in Tools -> Options:\r\n\r\n* Refresh automatically when files change\r\n* Check default remotes for updated every 10 minutes\r\n\r\nbut it didn't help, the slowness remained.\r\n\r\nI have also done a test of this actions. During this test I have shut down all other applications and antiviruses, and resident programs and services that I could shut down. I have tried all of the actions above and all of them were slow.\r\n\r\nDuring this test, I have watched the system status in task manager, and everything was normal, there was no increase in CPU and memory usage. The disk usage was most of the time on 0-1%, and it increased to 90% when I first changed a repo tab in Sourcetree. After that further changing of tabs didn't increase the disk usage, but were still very slow.\r\nDuring the test the options \"Refresh automatically when files change\" and \"Check default remotes for updated every 10 minutes\" were both unchecked.\r\n\r\nI have repeated the test with only two repos open which have a low number of commits (one has 2 commits, the other has 10) and no untracked files.\r\nEverything was still extremely slow.\r\n\r\nAll of my repos are on git (bitbucket) and I'm using the latest version of Git:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/download/v2.9.2.windows.1/Git-2.9.2-64-bit.exe\r\n\r\nwith default settings.\r\n\r\nThe repos are located on the local hard disk (SSD), and there's more than enought free disk space on it >20GB.\r\n\r\nAt the time of test I had 6 repositories opened. I have around 20 - 30 repositories bookmarked, but they were not open while I was doing this test.\r\n\r\nNone of the files in the repos were opened in an editor while I was doing the test.\r\n\"git status\" works OK on all of the repos.\r\nIn the list of files, the view I'm using is \"Flat list (single column)\", and the filter is \"Pending files, sorted by path\"\r\n\r\nI don't have a lot of untracked files. In fact, in the repos I have tested there were no untracked files.\r\n\r\nI'm running the latest Windows 10 (64-bit) with the latest updates.\r\n\r\nI'm attaching the sourcetree.log file.\r\n\r\nThe test was done few days ago, on 27/07/2016 with the latest version of sourcetree.\r\n\r\nUntil few months ago I have been using Sourcetree also on a Windows 7 machine and the slowness problem didn't occur there. I haven't tried the latest Sourcetree on Windows 7, but I believe this is a Windows 10 related problem. Few of my teammates have the same problem, also on Windows 10.\r\n\r\nIf you need any other info, feel free to contact me.\r\n\r\nIf you need it, I'm willing to repeat the test with a debug version of source tree that does more detailed logging. You can send me such a version and I will install it and repeat the test.",

      "description": "Ideally, you'd commit your changes as soon as you're done with the \"unit of work\" (feature/bug fix) you're working on. But for me, in practice often you'll find yourself working for a few hours and end up with a big pile of changes. While you were working on feature X, you ended up improving a part of your code base to help support feature X and in doing so you discovered a bug that you also fixed, but those changes don't really belong to feature X and you want to create a separate commit for them. And in general, I want to create my commits as small as possible with helpful messages for each commit. So if I have 30 changed files in my unstaged files list what happens is that I'll walk through them gathering the changes that belong to feature X and commit them, and then walk through the remaining files again to gather the files that belong to the general code base improvement and commit that, and so on until I've made all my commits. The time complexity of this is approximately N * M where N is the number of commits I'd like to make and M the number of changed files :P And usually after creating a commit I'll run into a file that actually belonged to a logical commit but I forgot to include it and I'll now have to make a second commit. \r\n\r\nWhat I would really like in SourceTree is a way to create multiple staging \"areas\". I'd create a staging area for every logical commit I want to make and walk through all my changes only once and add each change to the would-be commit it belongs to. So instead of one \"staged files\" you have multiple. This would make my commit process much more enjoyable. \r\n\r\nOf course, one problem I see with this feature request is that I don't think there's an underlying git/mercurial construct to back this feature. As far as I know, there's no way to stage a file in a different staging area than other files. But I'd like your opinion on this. ",

But I'm sure you've been aware of this for a long time.\r\n\r\nIf that wasn't infuriating enough - and this is the big on - if you accidentally drag to the right outside of the tree area and let go of the mouse button (because you just remembered that this isn't going to work anyway), the folder completely vanishes. Yes, it's gone. I doesn't end up in another folder or anywhere else. I have to create all those bookmarks again. Sometimes you can even do it by dragging an existing folder of bookmarks upwards and letting go of the mouse button.\r\n\r\nSo no I have to go and add all those working copies again.\r\n\r\nIt's 2016.
