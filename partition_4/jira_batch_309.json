This issue is being addressed as part of the all new Portfolio live plans, which feature an entirely overhauled and more seamless integration model with JIRA Software / Agile. Live plans are currently available as a labs feature for both Server* and Cloud, so you can start evaluating them without any risk of impacting existing Portfolio plans. They are not yet feature-complete, we're working on bringing all major capabilities of standard plans back into live plans on top of the new integration model before we graduate live plans out of labs and make them the new standard way of working. \nPlease check out this blog for a summary and short videos of how the top-voted suggestions are being addressed with live plans: [Top 10 suggestions addressed in live plans|http://blogs.atlassian.com/2016/03/10-user-suggestions-addressed-in-portfolio-for-jira/] and join our [Portfolio Pioneers LinkedIn group|https://www.linkedin.com/groups/7018171] to discuss feedback and best practices!\n \nThanks,\nMartin Suntinger\n[msuntinger@atlassian.com|mailto:msuntinger@atlassian.com]\nPrincipal Product Manager, Portfolio for JIRA\n \n^*The live plans labs feature is available with Portfolio for JIRA 1.12 or higher. It is compatible with JIRA Software 7.0.5 or higher, and JIRA 6.3 or higher, in association with JIRA Agile 6.7.12 or higher.^\n{panel}\n\nWhen releases are linked with versions in JIRA, and a different version is assigned to a JIRA issue, JIRA Portfolio should automatically suggest the new release when doing a \"Plan > Update from date\" operation",

The same goes for automatic two-way synchronization of summaries between JIRA and Portfolio. Changing either Epic name or summary in JIRA will propagate the new value to Portfolio. Changing the title in Portfolio will set Epic name and summary in JIRA.\n\n*Desired behaviour:*\nPortofolio provides a separate field for the Epic name (e.g., in the details page of a backlog item) and maps the title to the Epic summary. This way, the two fields could be synced independently and a change to the Epic title in Portfolio would then not unexpectedly overwrite the Epic name in JIRA.",

Summary\nThe current functionality of JIRA Portfolio allows for Sprint Dates And Release Dates to become out-of-sync, this can cause Stories to be scheduled outside the Release dates, into the 'Later' releases, having sprints with no Stories.\n\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\n# Create Releases that have Fixed End dates that do not correlate with the Sprint dates.\n# Recalculate\n# Select the \"Stories\" Icon. \n\nh3. Expected Results\nAn option to Sync up the Sprints would be nice, or some way to make it clear why there are empty Sprints. Alternatively, a default behaviour to start the release as early as possible to prevent empty sprints.\n\nh3. Actual Results\nIt's not clear how the releases affect the arrangement of Stories into Sprints.\n\nh3. Workaround\nAdjust Sprints to start earlier than the calculated date by using \"X Days _Before_\" the previous release date for the start dates of Sprints.\n",

We have about 20 Projects, which we enter as Initiatives. For these we enter epics and stories. All this is happening in the \"Initiatives\" view. We never even open the \"Epics\" view, because it's just a chaotic collection of epics without context. \nNow we prioritize by dragging up and down the initiatives and the release streams. \nWhat happens is: priority is not adjusted as we want, because the priority in the epics view (which we don't use) is overruling it.  \nFrom my perspective the priorities between initiatives (on the initiatives view) have no effect at all. Whats the concept behind this?\n\nThanks, Juri",

It would be great to see the estimates gathered from the \"teams\" which will implement this roadmap item.\n\nUse case: \n1. There is a high-level roadmap story of \"list all orders from the server and display on mobile apps\"\n\n2. The work to achieve this is split between server team, and 4 app teams (for iOS, Android, BB, and Windows).\n\n3. When defining a \"story\" in the roadmap, the stages, skills and estimates are gathered from linking the story to various teams. (For example: A story is created that just requires iOS and Server, links are created to 2xiOS and 1xServer stories, and the estimates are calculated).\n\n4. The roadmaps story can be linked to several stories in each of the 5 team's backlog\n\n5. Progress is shown by collating all of the estimates (days/hours/story points).\n\n6. Team/Stage/Skill capacity is calculated by checking the team's velocity from within Jira",
