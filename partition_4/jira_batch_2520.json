It allows remote attackers to do some clickjacking which can be used for adding arbitrary tasks in users&#x27; task list. Why? Almost all of your page has missing X-FRAME-OPTIONS header.\n\nWebsites are at risk of a clickjacking attack when they allow content to be embedded within a frame. An attacker may use this risk to invisibly load the target website into their own site and trick users into clicking on links which they never intended to. An \"X-Frame-Options\" header should be sent by the server to either deny framing of content, only allow it from the same origin or allow it from a trusted URIs.\n\nHere is an example PoC video done by Aditya Gupta, Subho Halder and Dev Kar for Google Plus: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0fTFHCxXBY (They got a hall of fame for this demo).\n\nVulnerability Reference: http://www.troyhunt.com/2013/05/clickjack-attack-hidden-threat-right-in.html\n\nGoogle and Facebook has patched this kind of simple exploit/vulnerability.\\\\\nSolution: Add a header to explicitly describe the acceptable framing practices (if any) for this site.\n\nFor example, here\u2019s what Facebook does:\n\n_X-Frame-Options: DENY_\n\nAnd that&#x27;s why you cannot include Facebook anymore in an iframe .\n\nAttached is my PoC screenshot too using the link https://bitbucket.org/repo/create.\n\nRegards,\n\nJay Turla",

      "description": "Hi,\n\nI noticed there are quite some posts on the subject already, but none seem to adequately describe my problem.\n\nWe, as an organisation, host the code of a couple of our projects here on bitbucket. For one of these projects, we have a Continuous Integration server, that pulls in the code on every commit. Since a month or two, suddenly all builds began to fail with the message: \"conq: repository access denied.\"\n\nLogging in to this machine, and trying stuff like \"git ls-remote\" to debug the problem, also issues this error. I (re)checked my ssh- and git configuration, like described by you guys in [this|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/BITBUCKET/Set%2Bup%2BSSH%2Bfor%2BGit] and [this|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/BITBUCKET/Troubleshoot%2BSSH%2BIssues] document, and everything seems in order.\n\nNow comes the weirdest part:\\\\\nOn the server I tried to clone the repo of the project in a temp folder. This failed with the same conq error again.\\\\\nThen I tried to clone the repo of another project we host here on bitbucket in the temp folder, and tada, that worked! This is quite strange, because I did not add the deployment key of the machine to that project at all.\n\nSo, somehow the server is able to successfully setup a ssh connection to bitbucket (it can clone repo&#x27;s), so the ssh settings on the machine are probably correct, but for some specific repo&#x27;s the connection fails. This conclusion seems correct, right?\n\nI&#x27;m quite puzzled now, so any ideas or suggestions are highly appreciated!",
