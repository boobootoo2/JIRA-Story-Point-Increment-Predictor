Summary\n\nThere are some cases where sprints imported into JPO do not match the dates with what is set into Agile. For instance, if you create a sprint with end date to some day after 10:00 PM, when in JPO, the end date will show up as the next day. \n\nh3.

Steps to Reproduce\n# Create a scrum project/board with a sprint set to start on _01/12 12:00 AM_ and end at _05/12 10:00 PM_\n# Create a live plan and import that board\n# View the sprint info on the timeline\n\nh3. Expected Results\nSprint info should show that start date is _01/12_ and end date is _05/12_\n\nh3. Actual Results\nSprint info is showing that start date is _01/12_ and end date is _06/12_\n \nh3. Notes\nThis shift only happens if the sprint end date is set to a time after 10:00 PM. The problem does not happen if you set 09:59 PM or any time earlier.\nTime may vary depending on the timezone.\n\nh3.Workaround\nChange the sprint end date to have a time earlier than 10:00 PM.",

That is, when you try to search for parents in JIRA's Create or Edit issue dialogs, this may lead to memory problems on larger instances. This problem is aggravated by the fact that every keystroke triggers a new search request.\nAnother problem is the related search for Portfolio child issues. This is triggered when opening issues above story level in Portfolio.\n\n*Workaround*\nTo stop this problem from re-occurring, remove the Portfolio parent link field from all screens in your JIRA instance to keep people from triggering the parent search which is the suspected source of trouble.\nThere is currently no workaround available to prevent the child issue search.\n\nWe are working on this issue with highest priority and should be able to provide a fix soon.

(lets say 4 hours)\n2. Refresh your Portfolio so that progress is updated\n3. Plan> Update From Date. -- Since work has been done on the issue, the estimate is reduced, (i.e. we are now looking at a remaining estimate) which makes sense. We have worked 4 out of the 25 total hours, i.e.16% and so that would be 1.6 out of the 10 original story points, so we now have a remaining estimate of  8.4 story points. Confirm the update\n4. Refresh the Issue, you will see that because the estimates are synced, the story points for that issue says 8.4.\n5. Plan >Update From Date-- even though no work has been logged on the issue, it is updating the remaining estimate. I.e. the story points say 8.4, you have completed 16% of work on the original estimate, so reduce 8.4 by 16% and now the remaining estimate is 7.056.\n6. Refresh the issue, story point estimate is now 7.056\n7. Plan > Update From Date-- even though no work has been logged it sees 7.056 and that 16% of the time based estimate is completed so reduces remaining estimate to 5.92\nAnd so on and so forth.\n\nIf no work has been logged since the last update, when I do a plan update it should not adjust/suggest this new estimate. Otherwise I have to remember if there has been progress since the last update and then accept/reject the suggested remaining estimate accordingly.",
