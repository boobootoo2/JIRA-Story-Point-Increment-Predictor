Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nThis feature request is to enable JIRA to set the notification subject based on what is set by customer in subsequent email replies (i.e. what is set at step 3 above)\r\n\r\nh3. Why this is important\r\n\r\nIt will allow better integrations with external systems\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround \r\n\r\nNot available",

      "description": "Make the Service Desk approval process \"FDA 21 CFR Part 11\" compliant\r\n\r\nh3. Problem Definition\r\n\r\nCurrently, Service Desk does not force the approver of a request to login when approving a request either by email or directly from the request, and if the user is already logged in.\r\n\r\nTo be Part11 compliant, it is necessary that the approver re-enters their credentials to approve the request, *even if they are already logged in*.\r\n\r\nHere is some links about the \"FDA 21 CFR Part 11\" compliant:\r\nhttps://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?CFRPart=11\r\nhttps://www.mastercontrol.com/ppc/21-cfr-part-11/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI2tCBt4D63gIV7R-tBh1sJQBpEAAYASAAEgJw2vD_BwE\r\n\r\nh3. Current behavior\r\n\r\nThere are currently 2 ways for an approver to approve a request:\r\n# By email: by clicking on the *Approve* button from the notification email sent to the approval\r\n!Screenshot1.png|thumbnail!\r\n# From the customer portal: by opening the request from the customer portal, and then clicking on the *Approve* button in the request\r\n!Screenshot4.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nFor either method, the approver *either needs to log into the Customer Portal, or to be already logged into the Portal*:\r\n- _For the method by email:_ when the approver clicks on the *Approve* button:\r\n-- the approver will be redirected to a page inviting them to login to be able to approve *if the approver is not already logged into the Customer Portal*:\r\n!Screenshot2.png|thumbnail!\r\n-- after the approver logs in, or *if the approver was already logged in* before clicking on the button from the email, the following screen will be displayed:\r\n!Screenshot3.png|thumbnail!\r\n- _For the method using the Customer Portal_: the approver will need to first open the request from the Customer Portal (by logging in if they are not already logged in), and then will be able to click on the *Approve* button.\r\n\r\n(!) The problem with either method is that is the Approver is already logged in in Service Desk, they will be able to use the \"Approve\" button (from the email or the customer portal) without being forced to re-enter their credentials.\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nWhenever an approver clicks on the Approver button (from the email or the customer portal), prompt them to re-enter their credentials, even if they are already logged in.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround \r\n\r\nNo workaround for users without a license.\r\n\r\nSome add-ons provide this type of feature, but they only work from the JIRA UI view, so for users who have application access via a license. Possible add-ons include:\r\n- [Electronic Signature Fields|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1211601/electronic-signature-fields?hosting=server&tab=overview]\r\n- Add-ons provided by Deviniti and cPrime\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n",

After comparing this bug request against the known bug report [JSDSERVER\\-5786: Service Desk customer sign up/password reset page does not indicate if the password does not meet the password policy requirements|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSDSERVER-5786] we realized that both are addressing the same scenario. We will be closing this request now and will ask you to cast your votes and add any additional feedback so we can have the impact of this issue gathered in one single request.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nAmirul\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\nh3. Summary\r\n\r\nService Desk password page does not indicate if the password does not meet the password policy requirements\r\nh3. Environment\r\n * Jira Service Desk 3.15.3 & Crowd 3.3.2\r\n * Jira Server has enabled password policy per /secure/admin/EditPasswordPolicy.jspa\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # As a Jira administrator, enable any password policy on /secure/admin/EditPasswordPolicy.jspa (default is disabled, for the sake of this test, let's try to use 'Secure' option which\r\n ** Requires passwords to be at least 3 characters long and use at least 3 character types including at least 1 special character.\r\n ** Rejects passwords that are even slightly similar to the previous password or the user's public information.\r\n # As a JSD project administrator, go to the project administration page\r\n # From the left sidebar, choose customers\r\n # Then click the Add customers button in the top right corner\r\n # Enter a new customer's email address to invite them to the JSD project\r\n # As the customer at the other end of that email address, click the link in the email to go to Jira to setup your account\r\n # Enter in a password that does not meet the password policy in place for Jira, example - previous password\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nThis page in Jira should tell the end user that their password does not meet the password policy currently in place for this Jira site. AND The page should indicate which specific element of the password policy was not met. (In this case previous password was entered)\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n * Nothing happens on the page.\r\n * The end user is not able to continue.\r\n * No visible error or warning appears in the browser\r\n * Only when looking at the browser console log can you see a HTTP 400 error (bad request) when trying to continue. Upon inspection of a HAR file of this even can we see a json response of\r\n{code:java}\r\n{\"errors\":[],\"reasonKey\":\"The password must satisfy the password policy\",\"reasonCode\":\"400\"} \r\n{code}\r\nHowever this response does not have any way currently to appear to the end user.\r\n\r\nh3. Notes\r\n\r\n!Selection_049.jpg|thumbnail!\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nIt used to work in Jira Service Desk 3.3:\r\n\r\n!Selection_048.jpg|thumbnail! \u00a0\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nThe Jira administrator either has to\r\n * Convey the password requirements ahead of time to the new user OR\r\n * temporarily disable the password policy",

Administrators do not need an agent license, but they will at least need a Jira license. There are certain aspects they can't access without an agent license and it is common for Jira Service Desk administrators to be agents, but an agent license is not required.\r\n\r\nProject administrators for your service desk can: \r\n- Access all features in Jira Service Desk\r\n- Manage users and roles in service desk projects\r\n- Set up customer portals, request types, queues, reports and SLAs\r\n- Perform all tasks that agents can\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nThis is very confusing as we are writing contradictory points:\r\n- we are saying on one hand that they are certain aspect that Project Administrator without a Service Desk (agent) license can't do, but we don't explicitly say what they can't do\r\n- on the other hand, we are saying that Project Administrators can perform a long list of actions such as \"Setting up customer portals, request types, queues, reports and SLAs\" and there is no mention that such actions can only be performed if the Project Admin has a Service Desk license\r\n\r\n*Suggested resolution*\r\n\r\nThe whole *Administrator* paragraph needs to be re-written and explain clearly what a project admin can and can't do:\r\n- with a JIRA Core/Software license\r\n- with a Service Desk license\r\n",

      "description": "h3. Summary\r\n* When the approval step of the workflow is re-triggered, JIRA is not sending a notification to approvers requesting for approval. \r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Create a workflow where the approval step (In Progress) has three outgoing options:\r\n#* Option 1, to approve\r\n#* Option 2, to decline\r\n#* Option 3, to return to an earlier status which can be transitioned back to the approval step.\r\n#* As an example,  [^screenshot-1.png]. Based on the example, \r\n#** Option 1 is In Progress -> Closed, \r\n#** Option 2 is In Progress -> Open\r\n#** Option 3 is In Progress -> Interim.\r\n# Create the issue.\r\n# Transition the issue from Interim -> In Progress. At this point, approval notifications are sent to approvers. Do nothing to the approval notification.\r\n# Transition the issue from In Progress -> Interim.\r\n# Transition the issue again from Interim -> In Progress.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n* Approval notifications are sent twice.\r\n** The first time in Step 3.\r\n** The second time in Step 5.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n* Approval notifications are sent once.\r\n** Approval email is sent in Step 3.\r\n** Approval email is not sent in Step 5.\r\n\r\nh3.Workaround\r\nNone.",
