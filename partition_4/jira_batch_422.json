Problem Definition\r\n\r\nAs a JSM administrator, there are possible situations when it might make sense to want to modify an SLA goal and have all corresponding issues recalculate (including issues that have already met the goal/non-ongoing SLAs). For instance: if the 'Time to first response' SLA goal was mistakenly typo'ed and a number of issues were opened and responded to (i.e., the goal hit a Stop condition) before the mistake was noticed and corrected.\r\n\r\nAccording to our documentation, [Setting up SLAs|https://confluence.atlassian.com/servicemanagementserver/setting-up-slas-939926373.html]:\r\n{quote}\r\nh5. Updating SLAs\r\n\r\nWhen you change the configuration of existing SLAs, we follow these rules:\r\n * We don\u2019t recalculate, or touch in any way, cycles that have already been completed. A cycle is completed when a request fulfills the Start and Stop conditions (depending on your configuration and events, another cycle of the same SLA might then be started).\r\n * We recalculate ongoing SLAs so they measure against your new configuration and metrics.\r\n\r\nIt might happen that ongoing SLAs will be completed or discarded entirely after changing the configuration. This can happen if you remove the previous Start or Stop conditions or change them to something else, which will trigger the completion. As mentioned earlier, ongoing SLAs will be recalculated to use your new configuration.\r\n{quote}\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nA configuration option to select whether non-ongoing SLAs are affected by SLA goal configuration changes should be added to allow Administrators the option of modifying historical SLA data.\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nCurrently there is no known workaround for this behavior. A workaround will be added here when available",

      "description": "h3. Problem Definition\r\n\r\nWhen importing objects using the AWS Insight Integration and setting the \"Missing Objects\" handling to \"Delete,\" the time taken to delete missing objects can sometimes increase the overall import time significantly. \r\n\r\nThis is due to the time taken to delete object references on related objects. Before proceeding with importing the next object, the integration waits until the delete operation has completed.\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nDelete missing objects asynchronously from the rest of the import. Allow new objects to be imported while the existing objects are deleted either at the end of the import process or in a separate process thread.\r\n\r\nh3. Why this is important\r\n\r\nWhen setting Duplicate Objects to Delete for an AWS import, if there are many hundreds of related objects, this can slow the import process down quite a lot. We have observed cases where the import takes 14x as long as when not deleting duplicate objects -- a 30 minute import takes 7 hours.  \r\n\r\nh3. Workaround \r\n\r\nYou can use a new attribute and automation to delete duplicate objects outside of the import:\r\n# Create a status attribute for each object type named \"Soft Delete\" with statuses (for example) \"Active\" and \"Deleted\"\r\n# In the object type import configuration, set Missing Objects to Update, and chose the attribute you created (Soft Delete). Set the Soft Delete status to Deleted.\r\n# You can later delete these objects manually by filtering for them and using a bulk delete. Alternately, you can schedule an automation rule to delete them on a set schedule.\r\n",

This is happening despite the fact the object has not been missing.\r\n\r\nThis is happening only for existing objects that have been updated (changed) by the import (for example, if some mapped attribute gets modified during the import).\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Make sure your Object has an attribute that will be used with \"Missing objects: Update\" Import rule\r\n # Create an import that will:\r\n ** Have \"Missing objects: Update\" rule configured\r\n ** Select your attribute in \"Attribute to edit\" field, and set \"New value of attribute to edit\" to the desired value.\r\n ** Set your desired threshold\r\n # On the external source, edit some value of a Data Locator, so that this change will get reflected on the Insight attribute after the sync\r\n # Run the import manually\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nThe modified data coming from Data Locators get synced to Insight attributes, and \"Attribute to edit\" will not change since the object is not missing (hence, no need to update the attribute).\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nThe modified data coming from Data Locators get synced to Insight attributes, but also, value of \"Attribute to edit\" gets cleared (current attribute value gets removed).\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n * We have \"Status\" attribute that becomes set as Active when a Person gets sync with LDAP import:\r\n!screenshot-2.png|thumbnail!\r\n * LDAP import configuration that will set \"Status\" to Inactive if the Person is missing after the threshold has been reached:\r\n!screenshot-1.png|thumbnail!\r\n * After the \"User principal name\" gets changed on the directory side, and after we sync the LDAP import, the \"User principal name\" Insight attribute gets changed, \"Status\" value also gets cleared, which is not expected:\r\n!screenshot-3.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nh3. Notes\r\n * Tested with CSV and LDAP import, possible that other import types are affected.\r\n * Affected attribute types are Status and Boolean, possible that other attribute types are affected.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nCreate an Automation rule that will restore the cleared value to its original value. This can be used only if existing objects have a predefined, known value for the attribute that is supposed to be changed by \"Missing objects: Update\" rule.\r\n\r\nFor example, this Automation rule will set cleared value for \"Status\" attribute to Active, which was the value that gets cleared by the import:\r\n!screenshot-4.png|thumbnail!",

The way the UI currently works makes it very easy to make a mistake.\r\n # Add a warning when removing a custom field from a project if that custom field is still configured on request types.\r\n # If a custom field is no longer present in a project, add a warning on the screen when editing the request type's fields to indicate that the field is not present in the project.\r\n\r\nh2. Note\r\n\r\nThis is not reproducible with all the custom fields' types. The behaviour was visible when using a DateTimePicker custom field but not with a simple text field.\r\n\r\n+Steps to reproduce:+\r\n\r\n1. Add a new custom field of type DateTimePicker to a Service Desk project.\r\n2. Add that field to an issue type.\r\n3. Create a new request type using the issue type, and add the new custom field to the request type.\r\n4. Try to create a new request using your browser. This should work.\r\n5. Remove the custom field from the project.\r\n6. Try to create a new request using your browser. Using Developer Tools in Chrome you'll see that one of the resources loaded returns a status 500 response and the HTTP request will return Null with 500 error.\r\n7. You can also try to create the request using the ServiceDesk API, and it too will return a status 500 response.",

Problem Definition\r\nCurrently, when opening custom fields' Object picker, there is a Search bar where a user can search Objects based on keywords (e.g. part of name, Object Key, or some other field values). However, there is no way to do more precise search based on possible Attribute values (similar to Jira's basic issue search that presents possible fields' values).\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Resolution\r\nAdd additional filter based on possible Attribute values to the custom field Object filter. For example, add a list of Attributes on the left-hand side to additionally filter the Objects on the list:\r\n !image-2021-11-19-15-47-04-693.png|thumbnail! ",
