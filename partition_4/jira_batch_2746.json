      "description": "{panel:title=Release update}\r\nHi All,\r\n\r\nWe are excited to announce that we have shipped the Authentication policies feature. Using this feature you can test SSO on a few accounts before enabling it across your organization ([https://www.atlassian.com/software/access/guide/elements/authentication-policies#why-apply-multiple-authentication-policies]). We are still in the last leg of the rollout. If your organization doesn\u2019t have the feature yet, file a support ticket ([https://support.atlassian.com/contact/#/]) and we will enable the feature for you.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nThe Atlassian Access team.\r\n{panel}\r\nEnabling SSO can be an iterative process and there are no proof of concept options.\r\n\r\nThe implications of enabling SAML can have wide spread negative consequences if not configured correctly and is complicated further if the Org Admin doesn't have a backup account to let them back to delete the SAML configuration or make SSO changes.\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nAllow Org Admins the ability to either simulate or test SSO settings without committing to make the cutover. In doing so, it would boost confidence and admins can better plan for the actual implementation/cutover. Also, allow Org Admins to test Atlassian Access REST API.\r\nh3. Workaround (Optional)\u00a0\r\n\r\nAdvise Org Admins to carefully review documentation and consider attempting to cutover to SSO during non peak hours which can include pre-communications to the user community and a follow up note to indicate go or no-go.",

Our current SAML setup has no way of incrementally testing a SAML config for a customer. It's all or nothing. \r\n\r\nh4.
