Recently I was in the Unity forum and opened a thread to discuss free version control apps. Many suggestions were given but when I checked all of them, I found out that only 2 free unlimited ones were available - this one - sourcetree, and github desktop. After spending a week with github desktop and posting questions, I was told in another forum that github desktop cannot handle complex branching issues.\u00a0Upon being forced to return to sourcetree, I found the same problem - no proper manuals for windows users. Whilst I have carefully played around and found how to use it, including how to configure sourcetree properly, I wish to ask the management why this persistent laziness exist so small time users like me have to waste more time playing around to learn how it works? Is this standard practise at the higher levels of the company?",

Unfortunately the only thing that I feel you missing is about Sourcetree for Linux. Alternatively I'm using Gitkraken. No one of my customers are using Windows, rarely they use Mac, because we work in Brazil and Mac is totally unaffordable here ($$). Backing to the goal, Gitkraken is alone in Linux environment. Would be great if you'd bring Sourcetree to Linux too (specially to Ubuntu). Thank you.",
