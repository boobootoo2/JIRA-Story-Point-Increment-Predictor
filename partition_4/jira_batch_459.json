Problem Definition\r\nThe current implementation of approvals either requires all of the approvers to provide their approval, or a fixed number out of a set of users.\r\nIn certain organisations, approval responsibility does not reside with individuals, but with groups (read, departments within the organisation).\r\nA requirement in such an organisation could be, that in order for an approval to go through, multiple groups are required to provide their approval.\r\nFrom within those groups, there are separate sets of users that can provide approval, though each group only requires to provide an \"x\" amount of approvals.\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\nAdd an additional option in the current approval feature.\r\nThe \"Get approvers from\" option should not only work off a multi user picker custom field, but also a multi group picker custom field.\r\nThe \"Consider approved after\" option should allow for a configuration where a number of approvers per group can be set, next to the \"all\" option as currently available.\r\nh3. Why this is important\r\nChange management can rely on multiple departments within an organisation prior to changes being allowed to get pushed through.\r\nThe current implementation of the approval feature does not allow for a differentiation of user groups, reflecting these different departments within the organisation.\u00a0\r\nh3. Workaround\u00a0\r\nInstead of having multiple groups required to approve a request in a single step, it is possible to make several statuses and approvals per status moving the approval process from one department to another.\r\nThis is a very linear approach, and could prove to cause (several) bottlenecks to occur within the change process when one department is quicker to approve than another.",

In this case, when accessing SD-1 via its Portal URL it says the request has been moved to a project which you have no access. This is because there's no Portal URL for NSD-2 to be redirected to.\r\n\r\nh4. +Suggestion+\r\nTheoretically this is a correct message. However, if NSD is open to Anonymous access, then it would be better if JIRA or SD could detect this and redirect SD-1 to the JIRA URL of NSD-2, which will be accessible by any Anonymous user.\r\n\r\nh4. +Note+\r\nWhen it comes to Anonymous, this should be tracked closely with JSD-4467.",

The reason for this diagram is just as valid in a SD world as in SW:\u00a0it is\u00a0useful for identifying bottlenecks (aka a backlog).\r\n\r\nConsider the simplest form of CFD: open to closed. JSD does provide an open/closed report as a line graph. The problem with a line graph is that it's harder to get a quick visual understanding of how those numbers\u00a0affect the queue size over time. Put the same open/close rates on a CFD and you can quickly see whether the queue size is growing, shrinking, or stable. In my experience, the backlog\u00a0trend is one of the best pieces of evidence for investment in more people or process improvement efforts.\r\n\r\nWhile there are other graphical forms for backlog trending, it seems like leveraging the CFD helps SW and SD people find common ground.",

Summary\r\n\r\nCurrently, the 'Organization' field in Service Desk can be set as a required field and added to the 'Create' screen for an issue. The problem with this is that the 'Organization' selection only shows up in the Customer Portal and will not appear as a visible field in the Create screen, thus making it impossible for an admin to require an organization to be chosen, and create a Service Desk ticket through JIRA rather than the Portal.\u00a0\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Set 'Organization' as a required field\r\n\r\n2. Add the field to the create screen in a Service Desk project\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nThe field should be visible and able to be set, or Service Desk should not allow you to set the field as required.\u00a0\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nThe field will only be visible in the Customer Portal and a user will not be able to create a ticket in that project through JIRA.\r\nh3. Notes\u00a0\r\n\r\nThis might be intended functionality (as Organization is primarily\u00a0a contact field and is meant as an option for customers to share a ticket with their org.), but allowing it to be set as required and put into a 'Create' screen causes confusion, as the ability implies that this field can be set through JIRA\u00a0during issue creation.",

      "description": "h4. +Summary+\r\nBy rights, free SD customers have no access to JIRA tickets which are not available on SD Customer Portal. In order to allow customers to view those tickets, the JIRA project must be open to Anyone i.e. [allowing anonymous access|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/AdminJIRAServer072/Allowing+anonymous+access+to+your+project].\r\n\r\nWhen this happens, customers may receive email notifications from the tickets. If they click the email links to view the tickets when logged in, however, they won't be able to view the tickets but will be redirected to Customer Portal instead (without knowing why). They will have to log out to view the tickets or open them in a different browser for anonymous access.\r\n\r\nh4. +Background+\r\nThis is indeed an expected behavior, as group Anyone is actually meant for anonymous access. It doesn't literally mean that anyone, regardless of logged-in or anonymous, can browse and view the tickets. What actually happens is:\r\n* If there's no user session (or anonymous), JIRA won't check user permissions but simply open the tickets for anonymous view\r\n* If there's a user session (user logged-in), JIRA will check user permissions and deny access from SD customers since they don't have application access to JIRA\r\n\r\nh4. +Suggestion+\r\nThis could be a bug or a suggestion, but there should be a better way to handle this situation to avoid bringing the customers the wrong impression that _they can't view the tickets_ or _they have to log out to view a ticket_. Some possible solutions are:\r\n# Replace Group (Anyone) with Anonymous Access in the JIRA schemes. This at least helps JIRA admins to beware that the permission is granted to anonymous users only, not logged-in users.\r\n# Don't redirect customers to Portal without telling them why. It's better to keep them in the same link and display a message telling them that they don't have the permission to view it, however they can view it anonymously if they log out.\r\n# Allow customers to view open tickets even when they're logged in, but still restrict them from accessing other functionalities.",

However, they fail to take account of when an organisation operates in a location with daylight saving time. \r\n\r\nFor instance a contract may specify 9am - 6pm for support. However the server time does not change to reflect daylight saving time. Therefore for part of the year the SLA calendar will not align with the contract hours.\r\n\r\nI discussed this at Summit 2016 with Vidhu, Lingbo and Adriana.  Please contact me direct for a PoC. \r\n\r\nA partial workaround is to use the created time to determine which SLA calendar to use and define summer and winter calendars.

There are scenarios where the customer wants to change the priority. Today they can only request this by submitting a comment and hoping that the agent acts on it.

If the agent doesn't act on, or does so in a delayed manner, then the notification does not occur or is delayed.\r\n\r\nThere may be a workaround here though ugly (I need to test this). Transitions could be created in the workflow for each priority level setting the transition from \"All\". Then expose each of these transitions on the portal. The customer could then click on the transitions, e.g.\r\n* Priority = Highest\r\n* Priority = High\r\n* Priority = Medium\r\n* Priority = Low\r\n* Priority = Lowest\r\n\r\nagain...yuck!",

Customers email through and get added to the customer list but we have to manually add them to an organisation. It would be ideal to have a rule in the organisation that can be turned off or on that includes a domain extension. If a customer emails through with the specified domain extension they are auto added to the organisation.\r\n\r\nAC:\r\n- Set a domain extension on the Organization\r\n- System reviews the emails sent through for a new customer and if the domain extension is matched to an organisation it adds the customer to that organisation\r\n",
      "summary": "Add email domain to Customer Organisation"
