The kind which usually means you will not spending your evening next to your girlfriend.\n\nSome quick googling on the error message did not lead to the actual answer.\n\nTurns out that after the designer accepted the invite, we went over 5 users and the repo became no longer writable for anyone.\n\nIf I, as I usually do, would not have been in the room anymore but would have been back on the road, the team would not have been able to push and deploy.\\\\\nWhich would have been unacceptable.\n\nI like Bitbucket, and like Atlassian (I have some friendly contacts over at your place and your office drinks in Amsterdam rock).\\\\\nNext to that I feel giving out free private repos is very generous.\n\nBut this is tricky and should never occur.\n\nHave a great evening.\n\nKlaas\n\nTweets which lead me here:\\\\\nhttps://twitter.com/spllr/status/261448212408307715\\\\\nhttps://twitter.com/marcusbertrand/status/261494883041308673",

Only after the script is reset, it would work just once again.\n\nI tried this with the current Release of the RLV Viewer to make sure it&#x27;s not Viewer related. I may still have done something wrong in my scripts, but i have been looking into the scripts for some time now and i don&#x27;t see how the scriptlet above would allow different behavior for other avatars than the wearer and after all the Listen event gets triggered and the message is the correct @getinvworn syntax only it doesn&#x27;t show the correct result.",

I would strongly prefer to see the \"raw\" git repo, e.g. as would be shown by gitk --all.\n\nFor a (contrived, and slightly messy) example, see https://bitbucket.org/mbc/test2/changesets. Branch b is not indicated at all, even though it exists in the repo, only because it is merged back into the \"Main branch\" (master). Similarly, commits of branch d before its merge into master are not indicated, but commits after the merge are. Branch f -- after master -- is indicated as I would expect.\n\nIn the above example, note especially the orphaned DAG consisting of c and e: these are visualized exactly how I would expect, and I would like the option to have master and branches touching it to be visualized in the same way.\n\nPersonally, I find the concept of a \"Main branch\" to be an unnecessary limitation, but I would be happy enough to have the option of just turning it off.",

If I know that the main fork of a project has problems (e.g. been abandoned), I&#x27;d like to be able to see at a glance what the forks of a project are doing.\n\nObviously BB should not just be a Github clone, but consider how much information is in a Github forking map, such as https://github.com/admackin/minidetector/network\n\nCompare this to https://bitbucket.org/tksoh/hgshelve#forks . That display tells me basically nothing except the name of fork owner. I can filter by this name, but this is not very much use to me if I just want to know what the various forks do.\n\nI think fork-browsing is important enough that it deserves its own page (although that dynamic JS mini-browser is fine for a few use cases, I&#x27;m sure). Most importantly, I should be able to see what the differences are of the fork without having to manually click through to 15 different pages (for this case, with 15 forks). Most simply, the hover text could display a summary of the fork - many people seem to update the description to reflect how it&#x27;s changed from the original project. Better still would be some dynamic display of the different changesets, although this doesn&#x27;t necessarily need to emulate the Github display.",

      "description": "We just recently switched from Github to Bitbucket. On Github, if I forked one of my team repositories, the permissions for the team were inherited without counting against my individual plan; however, Bitbucket does not work this way and to be honest it really doesn&#x27;t make any sense. Not only that, but if I manually remove those users from my individual account -- because they&#x27;re not actually working in my fork -- and then open a pull request from my fork to the main repository, the Team users are prevented from seeing the content of my code in the pull request.\n\nAt a very minimum, users of the main repository should be able to see the incoming code in the pull request so that they can approve it. I&#x27;m not so concerned about the fact that if they had permissions on the fork repository that it would count against my user count, because no one is actually working in my fork but me. It&#x27;s a crippling limitation though that they cannot even view the code when a pull request has been submitted. At that point, it makes no sense why the permissions wouldn&#x27;t be picked up from the original repository instead of the fork since that is where the code is being pulled into.\n\nThe suggested proposal of forking into the Team Account instead of my own account doesn&#x27;t really work for me. I intentionally want a private fork that I can work on a feature in and interactively rebase where I see fit without being concerned about someone else grabbing my branch before it&#x27;s ready.",
