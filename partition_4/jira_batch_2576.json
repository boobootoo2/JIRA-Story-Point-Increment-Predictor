Also if you change your email all old commits loss the link.  I&#x27;m proposing that bitbucket either:\n\n# Offer users the ability to have multiple emails registered for them where only one gets used for notifications/primary.\n# Bitbucket allows user accounts to be connected in someway or a single user account having the ability to have sub-accounts.\\\\\nI prefer the first.\\\\\nThe current implementation has been confusing and causes issues if the user changes there email address.  Personally I can just create two accounts one for work and one for personal but that is very hackish and they will not be deeply connected.",

It just makes so much sense to have them all \"close together\" in the same context.  While the current BB issue tracking is fine, I find the Wiki to be too basic and cumbersome, esp. if you have non-techies in the project.\n\nHave you taken a look at TeamBox yet?  http://teambox.com\\\\\nIt&#x27;s on RoR, so not a natural candidate for your pythonic setup, but still would be a fantastic addition to bitbucket. I&#x27;ve been using it with my team and we all love it!\n\nThe prices on teambox.com are quite steep though.  If you asked me, I  would be happy to pay BB an extra few bucks on top of my normal BB plan, for having the opensource Teambox nicely integrated into BB.\n\nWhat do you guys think?  How large is the effort to integrate it?\n\nCheers,\\\\\nNicklas",
