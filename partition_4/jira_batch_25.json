Part of the problem is that we don\u2019t actually know what causes SourceTree to stall and appear to sit there waiting.\r\n\r\nI recommend that we *add a window* which the user can bring up at will *which will list all the ongoing operations.* It should be a tabular list (GridView?) that shows the affected repo name, full path, and the operation (e.g. \u201cgit push\u201d, \u201cgit add <file> <file>\u201d, etc.).\r\n\r\nThis will allow users to get a better feel for what kinds of operations cause SourceTree to slow down and approximately how long until it will return to bearable operation. Further, it will allow you to better target what operations require improvement/optimization instead of guessing.",

But there is a big problem with the best GIT client (Sourcetree) we also want to use.\r\n\r\nSince version 1.8 an unattended installation of Sourcetree is not possible. For Installation it is necessary to have an Atlassian Account.\r\n\r\nIn such a big company like Volkswagen it is not acceptable to manually install software for a bigger group of users. Please, please, please change your Installation routine back like it was before 1.8. We really want to work with Sourcetree, but you make it impossible for many many people in a big company (and i think we are not the only one) to easily work with GIT / Bitbucket.\r\n\r\nRegards, Sven",

I think few improvements are critical to make our lives simpler:\r\n # add the ability to see a line clearly just by hoovering on it (it could go bold or change color)\r\n # add the ability to click a line in the graph and have it permanently use a different color (kind of a selected item color) - can only apply to one line in the graph\r\n # no one said line heights in the list must be the same. A junction like this with multiple lines crossing could use a higher line height to show the lines clearly\r\n # use a different algorithm for layout of the graph. one for example that uses horizontal lines and when multiple branches have the same parent, it does not put the lines on top of each other but lays them side by side (similar to an electronics diagram)\r\n\r\nThese would all make the usage simpler and free more time for me to do the thing I am actually payed to do which is write code and not analyze the commit graph just to trace something.\u00a0\r\n\r\nI know I can switch to the commit I want to trace and ask to see only that commit branch but sometimes I need to track multiple commits and see how commits relate from one branch to another",
