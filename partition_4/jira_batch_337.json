We appreciate your input and patience.\r\n\r\nRunning multiple sprints in parallel from a single backlog is something we will bring to team-managed projects. However, we have some other priorities ahead of it, we are currently not able to give a date, but I expect we will start to work on this in the coming months.\r\n\r\nIn the short term, we recommend teams use company-managed projects when they need to run parallel sprints. We apologise for the inconvenience this may cause you.\r\n\r\nPlease continue to vote, and in particular, please continue to add comments on how your teams find value when running multiple sprints in parallel from a single backlog. This contextual information of what you are doing and why you are doing it is invaluable for providing you with a product that fits your needs.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nMark Z\r\nProduct Manager\r\n{panel}\r\nh3. Problem Definition\r\n\r\nCurrently, we have the ability to enable Sprints in Next-gen projects.

This gives a pop-up that shows the Flag and a Comment box to enter a comment. (Check the image below)\r\n!screenshot-1.png|thumbnail! \r\nAfter we enter the comment and click {*}ADD{*}, this flags the issue as an impediment and automatically adds the Red Flag icon to the comments, or removes the impediment and automatically adds the White Flag\u00a0icon to the comments.\r\n\r\nThis feature, however, is not available on the New issue view screen.
