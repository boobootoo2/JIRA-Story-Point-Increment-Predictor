But quickly in words:\r\nIf users decide to show the labels and set them, and then at some point collapse it again, it deletes any selections they have made beforehand. Reason is that we want to make sure users have no doubt that when they hide the labels, they are no longer filtering anything.

The code in JIRA that handles the notification is in [BambooBuildNotificationsServlet|https://stash.atlassian.com/projects/JIRA/repos/jira/browse/jira-ondemand-project/jira-ondemand-plugins/jira-ondemand-theme-plugin/src/main/java/com/atlassian/studio/jira/workflow/BambooBuildNotificationsServlet.java].\r\n\r\nWhen JIRA recieves a notification, the workflow transition is skipped because userUtil.getUser(commit.getAuthor()) returns null. This is supposed to return the user who is the author of the commit, and is used as the \"logged in user\" who applies the workflow transition in JIRA. See [BambooBuildNotificationsServlet.java#150|https://stash.atlassian.com/projects/JIRA/repos/jira/browse/jira-ondemand-project/jira-ondemand-plugins/jira-ondemand-theme-plugin/src/main/java/com/atlassian/studio/jira/workflow/BambooBuildNotificationsServlet.java#150].\r\nThe problem is that commit.getAuthor() returns the full user name of the committer (e.g. \"Robin Fernandes\"), whereas {{userUtilImpl.getUser()} expects the short username of the user (e.g. \"rfernandes\").\r\n\r\nAs far as I can tell, the short username is not in the XML data posted from Bamboo to the JIRA servlet, so I suspect something will need to change on the Bamboo side to convey the required information.\r\n\r\nThis was originally identified in support case https://support.atlassian.com/browse/JST-53379.",

It seems that this is no longer the case and the only repositories I can select from the drop-down are the ones I created myself in Bitbucket. I have write access to all the repositories so permissions should definitely not be an issue (plus I assume bamboo needs read-only access anyways).\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n- in your bitbucket account, follow a few projects/repositories\r\n- try and change the source repositories in your bamboo on demand instance to a repo which you are following",
