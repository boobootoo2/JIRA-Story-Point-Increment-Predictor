Actual Behavior\r\nIn JIRA Core and Service Desk the due dates can be seen correctly 30 June 2015\r\nbut\r\nIn Customer portal, right after creating the issue the Due Date is one day earlier 29 June 2015\r\n",

Summary\r\nUsing a _relative_ URL for \"link.login.url\" in {{seraph-config.xml}} results in a HTTP 303 redirect to a location to a URL that incorrectly contains the Service Desk _request context_ in the middle, resulting in a request for a non-existing URL.\r\n\r\nIf parameter \"link.login.url\" in {{seraph-config.xml}} contains an _absolute_ URL the redirection works as expected.\r\n\r\nThis is broken. Jira should always work with relative URLs. \r\n\r\nh3. Environment\r\nJira Service Desk with SSO\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\nURLs in example:\r\n*Jira BaseUrl*: \"https://test-jira.example.com/tracker-test/\r\n*JSD portal URL*: \"https://test-jira.example.com/tracker-test/servicedesk/customer/portal/1\"\r\n\r\n* Set \"link.login.url\" in {{seraph-config.xml}} to a _relative_ URL, such as \"/test-login.jsp?pemissionViolation=true&redirectTo=${originalurl}\"\r\n* Go to https://test-jira.example.com/tracker-test without an active session\r\n* Jira redirects to a non-existent URL\r\n\r\nh3.

Notes\r\nIt has been identified that this happens becuase *Response.seeOther* is used to build the final URL. From [JavaDoc for Response.seeOther|https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/api/javax/ws/rs/core/Response.html#seeOther-java.net.URI-]\r\n\r\n{quote}\r\nIf a relative URI is supplied it will be converted into an absolute URI by resolving it relative to the base URI of the application (see UriInfo.getBaseUri()).\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nJSD has a wrapped version of *UriInfo* which is based on the _request context_, which in this case will have {{/rest/servicedesk/1/tracker-test}} in the path. As JSD is installed and handling this request, the *BaseUri* which *Response.seeOther* uses to make the redirect an absolute path now has {{/rest/servicedesk/1/tracker-test}} in it.\r\n\r\nWhen \"link.login.url\" in {{seraph-config.xml}} is set to a _absolute_ URL, such as \"https://test-jira-example.com/tracker-test/test-login.jsp?pemissionViolation=true&redirectTo=${originalurl}\", we do not run into this bug as *Response.seeOther* then does not use *baseUri* to modify the URL.\r\n\r\nh3.

Environment\r\n* Jira Core handler being used as channel to receive emails from Jira licensed user (who act as \"collaborators\" on a Service Desk project)\r\n* Service Desk Automation rule gets triggered on a new comment\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Configure Service Desk automation rule to get triggered by \"Comment added\" step\r\n# Set up Jira Core handler as an incoming mail channel that licensed Jira users will use in role of \"collaborator\"\r\n# Collaborator sends an email that contains attachments (or image in signature) to Jira Core handler address\r\n# The mail gets processed and an internal comment gets added to the ticket\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nThe Automation rule gets triggered based on the added comment.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nThe Automation rule doesn't get triggered at all.\r\n\r\nh3. Notes\r\nThe issue is caused by the attachments. The explanation for this is: the way JSD/Automation handle the events won't treat an e-mail comment with attachments as just a comment added, but as an issue event (the attachment is and update on the issue) and a comment added during an update.\r\nIn the end, the Issue Event listener will expect that the Comment Added listener would handle the event, and the Comment added listener expects that the Issue Event listener will do that. The result of this is that the rule is not getting triggered.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n* Avoid sending email with attachments (including the images in signature area)\r\n* Use Service Desk mail handler as an incoming channel for collaborator users",

We can go to the suggested functionality and filter for all automation that have a THEN clause for \"Comment added\", narrowing down the number of automations to check in a couple of clicks instead of going through each of them.",

Notes\r\n* When finding orphan automations, it seem that they are triggered by different events that might even be happening in other projects, and this causes an excessive logging (as all orphan automations will give one of these exceptions, having more than 50 will cause logs to be flodded pretty fast. The errors are like these: {code}2019-04-19 15:51:20,494 SdOffThreadEventJobRunner:thread-102 ERROR xxxx 951x38885x1 nr5e76 127.0.0.1 /secure/CommentAssignIssue.jspa [c.a.s.p.a.modules.rulewhen.ServiceDeskCommentCreatedEventWhenHandler] isApplicableProject failed\r\ncom.atlassian.servicedesk.api.BadRequestException: Error retrieving ProjectContext, project '17000' does not exist{code}\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\nThe workaround consists in disabling directly in the database all the automation rules which are associated to projects which no longer exist. \r\n(i) To identify orphan Automation rules, we can use this SQL:\r\n{noformat}\r\nselect rpc.\"PROJECT_ID\" as \"rpc.PROJECT_ID\", rr.\"ID\" as \"rr.ID\", rr.\"NAME\" as \"Rule Set Name\", rr.\"DESCRIPTION\" as \"Rule Set Description\", rr.\"RULE_SET_ID\" as \"rr.RULE_SET_ID\", rr.\"TRIGGER_FROM_OTHER_RULES\", rs.\"ID\" as \"rs.ID\", r.\"ID\" as \"r.ID\", r.\"RULESET_REVISION_ID\" as \"r.RULESET_REVISION_ID\", r.\"ENABLED\"\r\nfrom \"AO_9B2E3B_RSETREV_PROJ_CONTEXT\" rpc \r\njoin \"AO_9B2E3B_RULESET_REVISION\" rr on rr.\"ID\" = rpc.\"RULESET_REVISION_ID\"\r\njoin \"AO_9B2E3B_RULE\" r on r.\"RULESET_REVISION_ID\" = rr.\"ID\"\r\njoin \"AO_9B2E3B_RULESET\" rs on rs.\"ID\" = rr.\"RULE_SET_ID\"\r\nwhere rpc.\"PROJECT_ID\" not in (select id from project);\r\n{noformat}\r\nThe steps to disable the orphan automations are the following:\r\n- Stop JIRA\r\n- Backup the JIRA database\r\n- Run the following query in the JIRA database\r\n(!) Note that this query was tested on a PostgreSQL database and that it might need to be slightly changed depending on the database type\r\n{code}\r\n update \"AO_9B2E3B_RULE\" set \"ENABLED\"='false' where \"ID\" in ( select r.\"ID\" \r\n from \"AO_9B2E3B_RSETREV_PROJ_CONTEXT\" pc\r\n left join \"AO_9B2E3B_RULESET_REVISION\" rr on pc.\"RULESET_REVISION_ID\" = rr.\"ID\"\r\n left join \"AO_9B2E3B_RULE\" r on rr.\"ID\" = r.\"RULESET_REVISION_ID\"\r\n left join \"AO_9B2E3B_WHEN_HANDLER_CONFIG\" whc on r.\"ID\" = whc.\"RULE_ID\"\r\n where pc.\"PROJECT_ID\" not in (select id from project)); \r\n{code}\r\n- Start JIRA",

After making more transitions, the same transition may face the issue again.\r\n\r\nh3. Environment\r\nTested on Firefox 66.0.2 and 66.0.3\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Make any transition via Customer Portal using Firefox\r\n# Try to paste (via CTRL + V) in any URL Links in the Comment field\r\n# The URL Link will not be pasted in (Note: Issue occurs intermittently)\r\n** If the issue does not occur, try transitioning the ticket and try again\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nURL Link gets pasted in the Comment field\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nURL Link is not pasted in the Comment field. If you have highlighted a block of text, it will disappear as if being replaced but still no URL Link.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n# Right-click and paste (from the dropdown menu)\r\n# Press 'SHIFT' + 'INSERT' keys to paste\r\n# Use other Web Browsers",

Expected Result:\r\n - The linked ticket will be created.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Result:\r\n - An error message \"Invalid organization ids specified\" will be thrown\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n - Add the same Organization to SD Project B before creation.\r\n\r\nh3.
