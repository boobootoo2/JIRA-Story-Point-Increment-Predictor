Problem definition\r\nIt is important for all the organizations to greet the customer in best way when customers show up physically.\r\nWhy not having it on customer portal since we attend customers on the cyber space?\r\n\r\nIn addition to this, it would be great if users can easily see their username on every page they navigate to. Now they will have to click on their own profile to see their own user page\r\n\r\nh3. Solution\r\n* Having a simple greeting message, i.e. Hello [username] or Welcome [username] on the JIRA Service desk Customer Portal. \r\n* Also have a small greeting message at every page of the Customer Portal which clearly shows the username (eg. Something like Sysnexsys uses in [this example|https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/22655745/customer-portal-welcome-message])",

[See the corresponding bug report|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSDCLOUD-2152].\n  {panel}\n\nI was redirected here from the Developer Relations site (ecosystem). This isn't really a Bug or Suggestion, but we need support help with this question:\r\n\r\nOur scenario:\r\n* JIRA is available from the Internet though an Apache httpd web proxy\r\n* We have a multi-tenant JIRA instance. Each tenant has their own Service Desk\r\n* JIRA Service Desks are opened up to anyone (anyone can sign up) because the tenants don't know which of their users will access the Service Desk\r\n\r\nUsing Apache Allow/Deny directives, we tried to restrict certain Service Desks to specfic source networks (or redirect to another page). For example:\r\n{code}\r\n<Location /jira/servicedesk/customer/portal/1>\r\n  Order deny,allow\r\n  Deny from all\r\n  Allow from aaa.bbb.ccc\r\n</Location>\r\n\r\n<Location /jira/servicedesk/customer/portal/2>\r\n  Order deny,allow\r\n  Deny from all\r\n  Allow from xxx.yyy.zzz\r\n</Location>\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nHowever, this doesn't work because of the Single Page App nature of JIRA Service Desk. That is, if we type the URL directly into the address bar, the Apache web proxy will honor my Deny statements and block as appropriate. But if I link to those pages from directly within the app, the Single Page App bypasses the web server and the pages are not blocked.\r\n\r\nWe would like to know if there is some other way to restrict specific Service Desks to certain source networks.\r\n\r\nWe would also like to block or redirect the \"Help Center\" page from all users.\r\n\r\nThanks.",

They file a Payroll Help ticket using one of the many forms linked to that Issue Type. That issue type is linked to a special workflow my desk is using that fires off a \"Payroll Help Event Created\" event for listeners to consume. Then using the notifications settings, I have the Payroll Help SD Team project role get notified whenever that event is fired.\r\n\r\nI have this happening for about 4-5 different issue types for different aspects of the company (we do this one-desk solution so that our non-technical users aren't turned off using the system by having to go to multiple desks). I noticed the new automation feature allows you to send notifications based on issue type, but it's only on a per-user basis. I could conceivably add multiple users, condense my workflows and switch to using the automation feature while managing the user notifications on a per-user basis, but I prefer having the ability to manage all of my users via JIRA groups and/or project roles, as single-user management gets incredibly messy and hard to keep track of.

It'd be great if this would rather be the default language defined for that project/service desk.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the customer should have the chance to change the language setting. This is not possible at the moment and suggested workarounds are impractical (temporary assigning group jira-users, updating Jira's database directly).\r\n\r\nAnd to go even further, it'd be great if any email notifications that are sent out to the customer are sent in the customer's language - not the language of the current support team member who triggered the notification.",

When customers raise requests over email, the email body is added to the request\u2019s description. This often includes some unwanted media like marketing images, company logos, and everything else from the email\u2019s footer. With every new comment or update, these images get duplicated, making it difficult to find anything important. We\u2019ve heard your feedback and changed it\u2014Jira Service Desk will now detect and ignore any duplicates, leaving your requests nice and clean.\r\n\r\nPlease provide further details if there are additional use cases you would like us to consider in relation to image attachments.\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\n\r\nCharlie\r\n\r\nJira Service Management, Server & Data Center\r\n\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\nWhen you use the JSD with the email channel and someone with pictures in their signature sends in a issue.\r\n\r\nThen it will add the pictures as attachments and as a comment with the pictures.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to be able to remove signatures (including pictures) or be able to remove pictures in the body of the mail and only receive the pictures attached to the email",

Add an automation rule with the following setup:\r\n* *WHEN*: Issue created\r\n* *IF*: Issue matches - Issue Type is \"IT Help\"\r\n* *THEN*: Transition issue to {{Respond to customer}}\r\n\r\n3. Add the \"Attachment\" field to the IT Help type on the customer portal.\r\n4. Create two issues via Service Desk > Create a Service Desk Request, one with an attachment and one without (the attachment can be anything, I've been using a text file containing the word \"test\").\r\n\r\nh3. Expected results\r\nBoth issues will be transitioned to {{Waiting for customer}}.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual results\r\nThe issue with no attachment transitions correctly, but the issue with the attachment remains in {{Waiting for support}}.\r\n# The Customer Request view says \"Your request status changed to Requester action Needed\" but the status isn't updated to match: [^request.png] \r\n# In the database, the status actually shows that its in {{Waiting For Support}}, but the transitions on the issue shows that its in {{Waiting for Customer}}. See [^TransitionsAreIncorrect.png]\r\n# The transition seems to have activated for a second or less, before reverting back to {{Waiting For Support}}. If you have the JIRA Suite Utilities plugin installed, you can actually see the status *was* in {{Waiting for Customer}} for one second.

Workaround\r\nRemove the *Attachment* from the Visible Fields form so that users are forced to attach their files after the requests have been created.\r\nConsidering the same data from the *Steps to Reproduce* section, the workaround can be applied with the steps below:\r\n# Navigate to the desired Service Desk configuration screen.\r\n# Go to *Settings > Request Types*.\r\n# Select *IT Help > Edit fields*.\r\n# In the *Visible fields* section, remove the *Attachment* field.",

We couldnt pass PoC phase with jira cloud.\r\n\r\nAnother important think is you should manage service desk customers and users, when i deactive any jira user , i couldnt create any user and service desk issue  with same user name.  we started to think about jira service desk,  email handling is weekness side of jira cloud or we couldt look at the picture from true perspective. \r\n\r\nCould you please help us about this issue ? Thank you , kind regards.",
