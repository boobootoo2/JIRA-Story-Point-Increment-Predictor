      "description": "h5. Issue Summary\r\n\r\nWhen a user creates a workflow transition and adds the condition  *Hide transition from user*, JIRA Automation rules which use this transition would not be triggered.\r\n\r\n(i) _It is important that the transition is triggered by an automation because they want the issue to be closed if no updates after a while, however they must use a different transition from the one visible to users because the ones visible to users have required fields that prevent the transition from being used. _\r\n\r\nh5. Steps to Reproduce.\r\n\r\n# Create a JIRA project.\r\n# Edit the workflow reusing the transition that closes the issue, linking it between the first status the issue gets to upon creation (Waiting for Support) and Resolved Status.\r\n# Add a condition to the transition: *Hide transition from user*\r\n# Publish the Workflow.\r\n# Create a new Automation Rule:\r\n|*When*|Issue Created|\r\n|*IF*|Issue Matches: summary ~ 'test'|\r\n|*THEN*|Transition Issue:<_Your transition from the first status to Close_>|\r\n# Create an Issue.\r\n\r\nh5. Expected \r\n\r\nThe automation rule would be able to automatically close the ticket.\r\n\r\nh5. Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nThe automation rule would not be able to execute and close the ticket. This I suspect is because the automation rule is being run as a particular user.\r\n\r\n",
