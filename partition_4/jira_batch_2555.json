      "description": "Hello,\n\nI already posted a message about this issue on the forum the last week but I got no answer.\n\nI have a team account that contains 3 groups: one for admin permissions, one for read/write permissions and one for read permissions. However, the permissions for these groups and the users associated to these groups are not automatically propagated to all the repositories that are owned by the team account (although the checkbox that says \"Group name have write access to this account&#x27;s repositories\" is ticked).\n\nTo make it works, I have to go to the administration of each team repository; then access management and finally to add the team groups by specifying again the permission type (read/write/admin) whereas the team groups already have these information.\n\nIs it a bug? If not, the sentence \"have read/write/admin access to this account&#x27;s repositories\" is really embarrassing. Is there a page that explains group and team permissions in details?\n\nAlso, I have some team members that complain to receive emails each time I perform some tests with groups and permissions. Could you add a checkbox or something to disable notifications from the team administration?\n\nOne more question about permissions, if I give admin permission to a user through a team group does it also gives write access to team repositories?",

Type the exact same string : {{{Next Page}}}\nh1. When you then try to follow the link from the original page it takes you to {{{Next_Page}}} and gives you a 404 error since the create page&#x27;s URL used a space instead of an underscore\nh1. Now create page again with the name {{{Next_Page}}}\nh1. This link now works (linking to the second created page)\n=== Expected behavior ===\n\nBoth the contents of a wiki link and what is entered in the \"Create a new page\" UI should be considered the \"name of the page\".  Neither should be considered the URL (one of the jobs of a wiki is to keep the user from dealing with site implementation details, one of which is the mapping from page names to their URLs)\n\n==== Additional Note ====\\\\\nI would expect that if the user clicks on a link to a page and that page doesn&#x27;t exist yet, that they would be taken to the \"create page\" for that page name (which wouldn&#x27;t actually create the page until they click \"save\") instead of being taken to a 404 page.",

Which is bad --- because I don;t want to give someone who steals this key address to all my repositories (some of which hold sort of confidential code).\n\nI guess ideal would be to just allow .ssh keys to be limited to particular repositories. For now I circumvent this issue by creating artificial users and sharing  these private repos with them (which is OK since as an educational user I have unlimited repo plan) but this approach is kind of problematic since I have to obtain unique email address for each of these users. And it just doesn&#x27;t feel right to create multiple accounts.\n\nSo any means of resolving this problem would be OK.",
