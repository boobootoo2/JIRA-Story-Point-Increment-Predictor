Scenario\r\nUser has a hierarchy of versions in his GreenHopper instance:\r\n[PLANNING BOARD VIEW]\r\n* Version A (Released)\r\n** Version A.1 (Released)\r\n** Version A.2 (Released)\r\n* Version B \r\n** Version B.1 (Released)\r\n** Version B.2 (Released)\r\n** Version B.3\r\n\r\nHowever, upon releasing *Version B.1*, it seems to be stacked below *Version A* in the Released Board:\r\n[RELEASED BOARD VIEW]\r\n* Project Overview\r\n** Version B.2\r\n* Version A\r\n** Version A.1\r\n** Version A.2\r\n** Version B.1\r\n\r\nh4. Investigation\r\nUpon investigation and testing on a test instance, it seems that the order of the released sprints in the Released Board is related to the release dates of each sprint. Here's my testing phase:\r\n[PLANNING BOARD VIEW]\r\n* Version A (Release Date: 31/07/2012)\r\n** Version A.1 (Release Date: 15/07/2012)\r\n** Version A.2 (Release Date: 31/07/2012)\r\n* Version B (Release Date: 15/08/2012)\r\n** Version B.1 (Release Date: 15/07/2012)\r\n** Version B.2 (Release Date: 01/08/2012)\r\n** Version B.3 (Release Date: 15/08/2012)\r\n\r\nUpon releasing the sprints in accordance to the date, I achieved the same status as what the customer experienced. *Version B.1* was grouped together with sprints from *Version A*. Releasing *Version B.2* does not exhibit the same stacking.\r\n\r\n!Selection_049.png!\r\n_Image showing the unexpected grouping_\r\n\r\n!Selection_048.png!\r\n_Image showing the ungrouped, released child version._\r\n\r\nh4. Findings and Thoughts\r\nWhat I can conclude from this is that whenever the release date for a sprint (referring to *Version B.1*) is before or having the same release date as other sprints (referring to *Version A*), then it would be grouped together with that sprint; regardless of whether the sprint has a parent version (referring to *Version B*) with a date further than a parent version which is released (referring to *Version A*).\r\n\r\nh4. Assumptions\r\nTo be frank, I don't know whether to classify this as a bug or an expected behaviour; from what I see, the sprint *Version B.1* should not be grouped together with other sprints, as it is an independant sprint by itself. With versions in GreenHopper actioning differently than JIRA's methodology of handling versions (GreenHopper has parent-child versions, whereas JIRA treats all versions as independent ones), I see this as a minor defect in GreenHopper.",

I think this information would be handy to have in both Plan and Work modes. \r\n\r\n1) In the Plan mode, as I move the grey Sprint Maker up and down to determine the the amount of work to assign in the sprint I'm planning for, it would be useful to have the total amount of time available for the sprint shown somewhere on the screen, that way I can do the planning work more quickly and intuitively. Pretty much like what the Statistics bar lets us do in the Planning Board. \r\n\r\n2) Then in the Work mode, while each issue block has its original estimate shown, nowhere shown is the total amount of those estimate time nor the remaining time left within the current sprint. \r\n\r\nI know scrum resists midstream changes, but things do change for us anyway, so this will information facilitate us to respond quickly at least..\r\n",

While their tool has a long way to go for Enterprise use, they've done a good job of making backlogs and sprints almost manage themselves.  The contents of sprints will change many times to adapt to changing requirements and circumstances, as reflected in a well-maintained backlog.  \r\n\r\nWith all GH's additional data and configurability, GH could automate sprint planning even better than Pivotal Tracker does, reducing the effort required to just maintaining a solid backlog.\r\n\r\nFurther, once there has been some progress down a backlog, it is possible for GreenHopper to calculate our velocity empirically, replacing our manual \"default\" velocity with a more justifiable, data-driven number.\r\n\r\nI had to write a Jira plugin to provide us with Velocity, Iteration Views, and Release prediction, but I'm not asking for any of that for now.  It just seems silly to have to manually drag stories around to \"create\" sprints.  \r\n\r\nSprints will occur in reality, whether we construct them in GreenHopper or not.

In other words, GH automatically classes them as \"new scope\". But if I'm creating all of the information after the fact, there's no way to actually know that. Making such critical decisions FOR the user based on a (frankly arbitrary) datum such as a record creation date is far too limiting. (Perhaps the ability to mark the task as either \"original\" or \"added\". This gets to the overall issue of scope management in GH, as GHS-1288 for example).\r\n\r\nBut if I try to create my demo project by creating versions/sprints, tasks and worklogs in the future, the burndown chart won't show this data, apparently because it \"hasn't happened yet.\" Again, IMO, a case of the tool trying to do too much based on whatever the current date happens to be.\r\n\r\nI think the tool needs to worry less about enforcing any particular view of how things \"should\" be, and simply reflect the way they ARE according to the data that's been entered. Of course, where the data are ambiguous, the tool may need to ask for some additional info (like whether a task is \"original\" or \"added\").",
