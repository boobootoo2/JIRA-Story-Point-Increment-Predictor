They want to undo changes and baseline scenarios and come back later to compare with other scenarios.\nThe fact you have merged the commit to JIRA feature within the same process makes it very hazardous to use. Indeed, if I want to baseline a scenario without committing anything in JIRA, the existing dialog is not appropriate; for that reason, we are not able to recommend Live Plan and stick for now to Classic Plan.\nRegards.",

However, this filter relies on the issues having a resolution and a resolution date, because it is date-based (it shows all issues that were completed since the beginning of the active sprint / month / quarter etc.). Thus, issues that are _Done_ but don't have a resolution are not picked up by this filter.\n\n*Suggestion* \nTo address this problem, an \"All\" option should be added to this filter that will pick up all completed issues regardless of their resolution date.\n\n*Workaround*\nThe only way to work around this for now is to adapt the work-flow and treat statuses without a resolution not as _Done_ but still as _In Progress_, otherwise these issues will never show up in Live Plans",

That is, if there is a sprint ending on 15/Jun/16, 11:23:17, Portfolio will map its end date to 15/Jun/16, 23:59:59. Similar, sprint start dates are mapped to the beginning of the respective day. This is due to Portfolio scheduling on a day-granularity and hence timestamps have to be mapped to either the start or end of a day. As a consequence, the duration of that sprint might appear longer by one day than it actually is. For instance, a sprint running from 15/Jun/16, 11:23:17 - 16/Jun/16, 11:23:16 would have a duration of 2 days in Portfolio even though its actual duration is just one day. This leads to an inflated capacity for that sprint.\n\n*Expected behaviour*\nThe sprint duration should be accurate, however, due to Portfolio's day granularity, the sprint start/end timestamps cannot be matched, a better heuristic might help (mapping timestamps from the afternoon to end-of-day, mapping timestamps from before noon to beginning-of-day).",

Motivation\n\nAs a Product Owner I want to have more control over the Roadmap generated by JIRA Portfolio 2.0 to achieve the most useful and informative results for my stakeholders.\nh3. Background\n\nThe idea of generating data driven roadmaps via JIRA Portfolio 2.0 is awesome. Unfortunately the scheduler behaves \"too smart\" from time to time. Especially when it decides to prepone tickets that were prioritized lower for the sake of filling up sprints and to optimize capacity workload across sprints. The workaround of using dependencies is troublesome since you might end up chaining a lot of tickets to prevent JIRA Portfolio 2.0 to prepone some other tickets which is even lower in the backlog.\n\nAlso the automatic assignment of Teams to a Story or Epic is more often a burden than of\u00a0help.\n\nIt's ok, that these functionalities are there. But I would love them to be optional and use only the criteria that I need.",
