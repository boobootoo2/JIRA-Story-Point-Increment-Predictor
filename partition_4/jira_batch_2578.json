Consider the following scenario: there are a lot of recent updates that are visible and a few not-so-recent updates that are invisible. Even if not-so-recent updates will become visible I won&#x27;t see them on first pages so it&#x27;s easy to miss some updates. That&#x27;s why the newsfeed becomes less useful after the bitbucket infrastructure changes: one can&#x27;t rely on it to have recent information.
