I also have 1 team that is a mix of US and Cebu team members. To complicate the mix even more, I have a team member in Kansas (in central time). We are close to having a 24 hour development shop. We are making updates into GreenHopper at various times of day (and night). However, the supplied gadget for displaying the hourly burndown rate is currently only reflecting progress one time a day. Therefore, most of the time the data is outdated and inaccurate. \r\n\r\nThe gadget itself does imply that there are options to update every 15 minutes, 30 min, 1 hour or 2 hours. There is also a refresh menu selection which implies immediate update. These options are not currently functioning as labeled. As the Scrum of Scrum Master (and overall project manager) I need accurate and timely information to provide to my management team. My director is now looking at our dashboards and is expecting to be able to see how our teams are progressing at various point in time.\r\n\r\nIn addition, I see a big benefit to having a quick chart like this so teams can see the progress of their off/onshore counterparts. I understand there may be system overhead to run updates continually. Therefore, I would be able to accept routine updates every 2-4 hours as long as there is an option to do an immediate refresh. In addition, the refresh options in the gadget should be modified to reflect the correct options.\"\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nIan\r\n\r\n",

(See: http://jaibeermalik.wordpress.com/2010/07/22/using-greenhopper-to-manage-multiple-teams-in-agile/) This should not require custom setup to achieve. And it is frustrating our adoption. \r\n\r\nHaving separate project per team does not work either, as then there would have to be a separate \"bug project\" where issues could be reported but not associated with a team. Howver, then the coordination between what bug is in which project would be a nightmare. Enabling multiple teams within a single project, just like VersionOne and Rally is the right way to go.",

      "description": "We are in the process of moving a business with several mature products to JIRA.  Unfortunately they want to use a version hierarchy - but in a slightly different way that is currently implemented in GreenHopper.\r\n\r\nTo explain the method I will use a very standard version hierarchy below:\r\n\r\n* {color:red}Release 1.0 {color}\r\n** {color:red}Release 1.1 {color}\r\n** {color:red}Release 1.2 {color}\r\n*** {color:red}Release 1.2.1 {color}\r\n** {color:red}Release 1.3 {color}\r\n* Release 2.0\r\n** Release 2.1\r\n\r\n{color:red}Red{color}=Released versions\r\n\r\nAn issue is identified in Release 1.1 by a customer in the field.  \r\nThe decision is made to patch the issue in Release 1.1, 1.2.1 and 1.3 and to add the fix to unreleased versions 2.0 and 2.1.  \r\nTo track this work they will create the initial issue in Release 1.1 and will create clones for releases 1.2.1, 1.3, 2.0 and 2.1 to track the patches/fixes.\r\n\r\nAs a result the initial issue exists in Release 1.1, Clone 1 is created in Release 1.2.1 and Clone 2 in Release 1.3 and so on...\r\n\r\nWhen an issue is dragged into release 1.2.1 using GreenHopper the \"Fix Version\" will be set to \"Release 1.0, Release 1.1, Release 1.2, Release 1.2.1\".\r\n\r\nThis will result in the versions containing the following:\r\n\r\n|| Version || Contains Issues ||\r\n|Release 1.0 | Initial issue, Clone 1, Clone 2 |\r\n|Release 1.1 | Initial issue |\r\n|Release 1.2 | Clone 1 |\r\n|Release 1.2.1 | Clone 1 |\r\n|Release 1.3 | Clone 2 |\r\n\r\nWhat the users would like to see reported is:\r\n\r\n|| Version || Contains Issues ||\r\n|Release 1.0 | Nothing |\r\n|Release 1.1 | Initial issue |\r\n|Release 1.2 | Nothing |\r\n|Release 1.2.1 | Clone 1 |\r\n|Release 1.3 | Clone 2 |\r\n\r\nThis would be accomplished by adding an option to the GreenHopper configuration that would change the \"Fix Version method\" to set the Fix Version to the version the issue was dropped into and only the version the issue was dropped into... \r\n(i.e. Clone 1 would be set to \"Release 1.2.1\" as opposed to \"Release 1.0, Release 1.1, Release 1.2, Release 1.2.1\" in the example above).\r\n\r\nI have worked with several companies that use this approach (or similar) for issue tracking and I hope this would be an easy modification to Greenhopper which would allow it to be used by even more users in even more ways.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nJon",

In JIRA 3.x versions with compatible GreenHopper (3.8) you were able to move those issues between the parent-child version hierarchy. It seems to have changed now, so in latest versions you can only move left over issues to the child's parent version (1 level up).\r\n\r\nAssuming this hierarchy:\r\n\r\nSprint\r\n Child 1\r\n   Child of Child 1\r\n Child 2\r\n   Child of Child 2\r\n\r\nIf you attempt to release \"Child of Child 1\", you would like to move left over cases to \"Child of Child 2\", as they the same \"feature\". The bug is: you can only release to \"Child 1\" (the parent, 1 level above).\r\nI have tested this in a fresh new instance, with latest JIRA + GreenHopper (4.2.3 and 5.4.1). I also had a screenshare with the customer to clarify this issue.\r\n\r\nI'm attaching some screenshots for better comprehension",

But this is not really a feasible solution, because I could have \"Open\" subtasks under the \"In Dev (UI)\" column, too.

      "description": "GreenHopper is an insanely useful tool - to the point where I have used it for various management reporting and tracking tasks that are outside of its immedaite Agile remit.\r\n\r\nThe specific need I have is to have issues that belong to Released versions remain visible. I have currently worked around this by adding new \"virtual\" or \"logical\" versions (which are unreleased and ordered after all \"real\" versions) to the system and then use the standard JIRA Multi-Select field to add this special version to the issue in addition to other \"real\" versions and sprints.\r\n\r\nThis technically works quite well, and even had the added benefit of showing little green ticks when the issue is released in a \"real\" version. The list view still shows the \"real\" versions as in a multi-select scenario, GreenHopper shows the earliest version by version order.\r\n\r\nHowever, we have found that this approach breaks in a number of scenarios that have ultimately made the workaround unusable for us. The problems are:\r\na) The in-line editing has no idea about the multi-selects, and changing a fixVersion removes ALL other selected versions - so we had to stop using this;\r\nb) You can't tell the JIRA issue \"Bulk Edit\" feature not to touch certain version; reducing its functionality considerably; amd\r\nc) The subtleties of the workaround is beyond our general user community and is causing confusion and information loss.\r\n\r\nI can easily store the virtual \"version\" grouping information using many other techniques; however I am left with the problem of how to get the issues visible on the GreenHopper Planning (or Task) board.\r\n\r\nMy suggestion is to simply add a check-box to the \"Manage/Edit Context\" facility where you can select \"Releeased issues remain visible\"\r\n\r\nThis should default to OFF (the existing behaviour) and it is appropraite for the override to be available against specific Contexts that need it.\r\n\r\nNOTE: GHS-945 covers off a much more significant rework of how fixVersions work in GreenHopper. It is possible that some of the solution being developed there (apparently scheduled for GreenHopper 6.0) could solve this problems - but it possibly still may not. I am therefore adding this as a separate issue so that:\r\na) It doesn't totally feature-creep GHS-945, and\r\nb) It can possibly be implemented more simply and sooner as it has a much lower impact and development footprint.\r\n",

      "description": "Hi all,\r\n\r\nI am currently working with GreenHopper within JIRA Studio (2.3).\r\nI am working in a software company and we make software engineering and requirements engineering both with JIRA Studio.\r\nWe have one single JIRA Project for both kinds of work.\r\nThe developers work on the issue types Bug, New Feature, Development Task, Improvement and the requirements engineers work on the issue type Requirement.\r\nBoth roles have different workflows.\r\nNow due to the fact that both work on the same JIRA project there are some shortcomings when working with greenhopper.\r\nIt is not possible to easily switch between both modes (development and requirements).\r\nCurrently we solve the situation the following:\r\nThe Greenhopper Template contains all workflow steps (from both disciplines). The developers hide all steps that are for the requirements engineers and the requriements engineers hide all steps that are for the developers.\r\nFurther we created two contexts \"Development\" and \"Requirements\" that only show the issues types that belong to the users role.\r\nSo the problems are the following:\r\n* The hiding of the \"not needed\" fields must be done manually by each user\r\n* A user that has work to do in both roles (e.g. development lead of the project) has no chance to switch unless he/she adds the hidden fields again.\r\n* It is not possible to provide such settings globally. It must be configured per project per user\r\n\r\nWhat I suggest:\r\nA new setting maybe called \"view\" that allows the greenhopper admin to define multiple views on workflow basis. I imaging that I can set a template per workflow and in Greenhopper I can then choose what role I have and then I see my templates and my issues. People that have multiple roles can easily switch between those.\r\n\r\nI hope you find this meaningful.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nFlorian",

Basically:\r\n    * Go to Administration > Workflows\r\n    * Create a draft for the workflow\r\n    * Select View properties of the Closed step\r\n    * Remove the jira.issue.editable property configured there\r\n\r\nBug:\r\nThat works, however even with the default workflow selected it is possible to release from the planning board. I'm not sure what the planning board does differently compared to the task board, but for some reason it is able to perform the release.\r\n\r\nThe Release works fine in the Planning Board, but in the Task Board when using Kanban you are greeted with the Error message, so you are not able to perform the release.\r\n\r\n*Workaround*\r\n\r\nchange your workflow and Task Board Mapping to ensure the Done column is not \"Closed\" but simply \"Resolved\". That way you can use the Release mechanism.",

      "description": "Currently when ranking is enabled, if you create a new card on the Planning Board with a card selected, the newly-created card is inserted above the select card. On the Task Board this doesn't occur, however, (it shows at the bottom of the To Do list) and it's not really immediately obvious as to _why_.\r\n\r\nA customer raised this as a support issue, and gave a very well thought-out response as to why at least the option to put newly-created cards above the selected card (or at the very top of the list) should exist:\r\n\r\n{quote}\r\nThe scenario that our Scrum master is interested in is pretty constrained. Being able to add new bugs during a sprint is part of Scrum. Having them added to to top of the sprint backlog is how it's typically done (not just at our company \u2014 it's a common practice). I don't think that items need to be inserted directly into either the In Progress or Done columns. I don't think that sorting needs to be supported in the To Do column. Based on the scenario and Scrum practice, the only change needed is the ability to add a Bug to the top of the list (by selecting the top existing item in the list).\r\n\r\nFurther, Rank, which is a custom field, is kept invisible to the user. All the user is interested in is order of issues \u2014 the rank field is a way of supporting a sortable list, and the the specific values that it contains aren't of interest. That is, if four issues are given ranks values or 1, 2, 3, and 4, they will sort in the same order if they are instead given values of 2, 17, 22, and 48. The value doesn't matter.\r\n\r\nThe task view is showing the same issues as the planning view (for a given version, for example), but divided into three columns based on status. Does the rank value currently remain unchanged when issues are moved across the three columns? Or is it changing to reflect which items are moved across the columns first? (I actually have no idea, but it doesn't look like it's changing to me.)\r\n\r\nIf the rank value doesn't change when moving across columns (and this is a big \"if\"), then the rank value will preserve the list order regardless of which column an issue is in. That is, when a new issue is inserted at the top of the to do list, the rank values could be updated behind the scenes exactly as they are when a new issue is inserted at the top of the planning board list. The fact that I can insert a new issue at the top of the planning board list, switch to task board, and see the newly added item at the top of the To Do list suggests that this would be technically possible. That is, it appears that rank applies to all of the issues in a given version and is used to preserve the order. (FWIW, this suggests to me that the answer to your question is that yes, the rank of the cards in the other column should potentially change, but this is invisible to the user as it is done in a way that preserves the order of items in the list. As well, dragging the bug over to the In Progress column should behave the same way it would if it were a previously existing issue, or if it were one newly added in the Planning Board.)\r\n{quote}",
