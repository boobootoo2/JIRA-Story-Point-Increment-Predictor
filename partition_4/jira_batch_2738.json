We would ideally leave our actual PROD data untouched on your end 3) With regards to the first two questions, can you also please cover how we can re-authenticate our instances with your end if this is necessary? 4) Do you require any lead time before we start doing the migration?\u00a0\r\nh3.

Here is an example:\r\n\r\nPerson A) Assignee\r\n Person B) Watcher\r\n Person C) Watcher\r\n Person D) Watcher\r\n Person E) Edit for example a field\r\n\r\n--> Only person B) or C) gets in Slack a message that the issue field was updated.\r\n\r\n--> If the watcher (who gets the notifications) leaves the watching mode --> only the assignee gets the notification.\r\n\r\n--> Usually, I get only Slack direct notification if I am the only watcher.\r\nh3.
