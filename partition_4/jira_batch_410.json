Based on that the chart should give us the required story point burndown for each sprint. If a sprint is released the chart should show the how many story points we got in that sprint. I was not able to find that information within the release or chart board within GreenHopper. But this is a essential view for a Scrum project.\n\nEnclosed I have a example for you, see \"example.png\".\n\nThe only way I found with GreenHopper is the Statistic Burndown Chart with the Story Point field. But this uses days as perspective and not the sprints. therefore you are not able to see any relevant informations on it, see \"charts.png\".\n\nRegards,\nDirk\n\n=> The screenshots can be found in: https://support.atlassian.com/browse/GHS-4237 - I do not want to make them public.",

set its Start date to 02/03/2012 (you will see that it will actually change the saved date to 01/03/2012)\n- Select the Chart Board and the follow stacktrace will be displayed.\n\nI noticed that for Moscow the limit date is 25/26 of March that indicates that it is using the timezone database from 2007 that is the last year when the DST changed on this dates
