      "description": "More often then I would like, one or more of our build agents dies/croaks/barfs/quits for unknown or unexpected reasons.  When this occurs, our CI builds will remain green (or red) and display a spinning build icon, as opposed to a check mark.  After a bit of time (usually way longer than I'd like) someone notices that the builds have not recently completed, or done anything for that matter.  Only after you click on a build are you then notified that:\r\n\r\nNo agents can run this build.\r\n\r\nBut what?  I was just looking at a spinning icon, is Bamboo confused, or just trying to confuse users?\r\n\r\nI would suggest that if a build is in a state of \"No agents can run this build\" it gets a new icon, other than a spinning arrow, perhaps one which conveys some sense of urgency and concern.  Like a yellow triangle or similar.",
