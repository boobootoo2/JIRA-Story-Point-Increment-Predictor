Scenario:\r\n # Create a JIRA Service Desk, along with some Customers\r\n # Link the JIRA Service Desk to a Confluence Knowledge Base Space\r\n # In the space permissions, allow \"Unlicensed users to access this space\"\r\n # Set Confluence to talk to JIRA for user management\r\n\r\nh2. Use Case:\r\n # Your service desk provides service for multiple companies.\r\n # Each service desk is restricted to the customers for that company\r\n # You only want to ensure that users can access the knowledge for their company\r\n\r\nh2. The problem:\r\n\r\nWhen a customer (who exists in Confluence) views an article, Confluence will prompt that user to log in - which opens in a new window.\r\n\r\nWhile the customers cannot see the dashboard or other spaces in Confluence (because they do not have the \"Use Confluence\" permission), they can see other spaces with the \"Allow unlicensed users to access this space\" setting.\r\n\r\nThis can be problematic for customers who delegate Confluence to JIRA for user management and want to maintain confidential customer knowledge in a space - it's possible for other users to access those spaces (because Service Desk doesn't differentiate between if an unlicensed user could see the linked service desk.\r\nh2. Possible Solutions:\r\n * A mechanism to check if the user is able to access the Service Desk linked to that space (i.e, is this user a valid customer for that service desk?)\r\n\r\nh2. Workaround:\r\n # In JIRA, add your customers to groups - and then synchronise those groups to Confluence\r\n # At the top level page on the space, add a restriction to only allow \"Confluence Users\" (your staff members) and the name of your customer group to view and edit the pages in that space.\r\n\r\nThis will then stop any user not in those groups from viewing the pages in the space. The \"Edit Pages\" restriction doesn't allow customers to edit a page, as they're still unlicensed users.",

We would love to hear from you on what you\u2019d expect from this feature improvement. Understanding this helps us craft the right thing, that fits your needs.\r\n\r\nIf you would like to help out, please take 2 minutes to answer these questions - [https://jsd-explorations.typeform.com/to/XlzAoY]\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\n\u2014 JIRA Service Desk Team\u0003\u0003\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n----\r\nSo I love the relatively new approval feature for help desk workflows.\r\n\r\nSomething I wish I could do is add the Approval and Decline buttons into the notification email for the approver.\r\n\r\nI attempted to do this using the API ([https://docs.atlassian.com/jira-servicedesk/REST/3.8.1/#servicedeskapi/request/\\|https://docs.atlassian.com/jira-servicedesk/REST/3.8.1/#servicedeskapi/request/]\\{issueIdOrKey}/approval)\r\n\r\nbut found that it is still experimental and it can't be done with a simple link.\u00a0\r\n\r\nI could create a bunch of embedded html inline javascript into the email that would get the approval id for the request and approver and then create form buttons in the email, but outlook and other email clients would probably block it, and that seems a cumbersome workaround.\r\n\r\nWe just have some users that are likely going to not hit the View Request button.\r\n\r\nI suppose I could make an automation either with built in automation tools or the JIRA automation rules plugin that\u00a0allows them to reply the word approve or decline, maybe even make those buttons in the email that say reply approve and makes it so a email is written with the word approve for them to send.\r\n\r\nPoint is, I realize there are some possible workarounds to make this sort of happen, but a built in way to have a approving user hit a button in their request needs approval email would greatly help\u00a0simplify our users workflows and increase our service desk adoption.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPlease and thank you =)",

Summary of Issue\r\n\r\nWhen a single JIRA Action is completed satisfying both the START/STOP condition of a SLA Counter, the SLA Counter can result in being\u00a0started but not stopped.\r\nh4.

(/)\r\n # Scenario 2: *OPEN TICKET* \u2192 *RESOLVE TICKET*\r\n ** Ticket is in OPEN state.\r\n ** *Resolved* ticket and *set Assignee* and *Resolution Description*.\r\n ** *Time to Resolution SLA* started counting as ticket has moved from *Assignee from Unassigned* as per START CONDITION.\r\n ** The STOP CONDITION is also met as ticket is now in Resolved state but *Time to Resolution SLA* did not stop counting (x)\r\n\r\nh4. Expected Result\r\n\r\nScenario 1 above working correctly as expected.\r\n Scenario 2 above should start the Timer and *stop the Timer* since Start Condition is met and then Stop Condition is also met.\r\nh4. Actual Result\r\n\r\nScenario 1 above working correctly as expected. (/)\r\n Scenario 2 above should have a Stopped Timer but the Time To Resolution SLA is still counting (x)\r\n\r\nIt appears that JIRA Service Desk SLA is processing the SLA counter in the order JIRA is processing the action events. In this particular case, it looks like JIRA has processed the *Set Status to Resolution* and then *sets the Assignee* on the ticket. This explains why the counter is being Started and not Stopped.\r\nh3. *Expected Behaviour*\r\n\r\nExpecting JIRA to evaluate the Start/Pause/Stop SLA conditions after all the multiple events in a single action (e.g. Assign and set Resolved)\u00a0were done so that the order of how JIRA processes the individual events is not relevant.\r\nh4. Workaround\r\n\r\n*Option 1:* After *Resolving* and *Assigning the ticket* in one action, close the ticket so the SLA Stop condition is evaluated for *Enter State: Closed* to stop the Timer.\r\n\r\n*Option 2:* Alternatively, change the SLA Start/Pause/Stop Conditions so the Conditions are:\r\n # START: When ticket is created\r\n # PAUSE: When ticket is unassigned\r\n # STOP: When ticket is Resolved or Closed\r\n\r\nNote that this will Stop the Timer when the ticket once unassigned.\r\n\r\n*Option 3:* Change the workflow so that the Assignee must be set before a ticket can be Resolved",

Possible Workaround\r\n\r\nUsers could consider using a 24/7 calendar and pause the issue at a particular status you do not want it to count until work is being done on it in the next geolocation.",

Actual Results\r\nThe plain text version of the content is used for the issue description or added as a comment and an attachment containing the HTML version of the email body is attached to the ticket.\r\n\r\nFor Exchange servers, this attachment will typically be named _text.html_, while for Gmail is can be random.\r\n \r\nh3. Notes\r\nThis is an example email:\r\n [^Re- [JIRA] (TEST-8) Commented- I need help.eml] \r\n\r\nNote the content-type:\r\n{code:borderStyle=solid}\r\nContent-type: multipart/alternative;\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nScreenshot of ticket created from a gmail account with message sent from Mac Outlook:\r\n !Screen Shot 2017-08-24 at 3.37.15 PM.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\nh3.Workaround\r\nAccording to a similar ticket (JRASERVER-62023) for the JIRA Core mail handler, these are possible workarounds, but I have not been able to confirm their effectiveness:\r\n* Send email from MAC Outlook Client on plain TEXT format.\r\n* Send email from MAC Outlook Client on plain HTML format with the option 'Preferred encoding for new messages' unchecked in Outlook Composing Configuration.",

Suggested Solution\r\nBetter handling of outlook item attachment in JIRA so that it will not distort the original attachment.\r\n\r\nh3. Why this is important\r\nAs many organization is using outlook as their main email client due to security purposes it is important for JIRA to be handle outlook attachment correctly as an organization is not allowed to use google, yahoo or other free mail client due to security concern.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround \r\nCurrently, in outlook there is two option to attach email attachment as shown below:\r\n* Attach file \r\n* Attach Item\r\n\r\nThe behavior only happens if the user uses attach item feature, if they save the email locally to their computer and attach using *attach file* option the .eml attachment with more than 50 character works fine without any distortion.

These were\u00a0JRASERVER-64325 and\u00a0JSDSERVER-5273.\r\n\r\nTo prevent them to happen I have created a non-JIRA dashboard which queries the database directly and shows me troublesome database entries. This is sufficient for issues I am aware of, but if any new type of problem occurs, I will not\u00a0notice it until my customers report it to me.\r\n\r\n*The essence of this suggestion*\r\n\r\nI propose a\u00a0__\u00a0new feature of _JIRA Service Desk customer notification audit_*,*\u00a0 where admins could see the frequency of outgoing customer emails and maybe even, set alarm rules for situations when no customer notification is generated for the whole day.\r\n\r\nIf such alarms existed, any JIRA Service Desk manager would know about issues with customer emails after one day instead of three (or more).",
