      "description": "There are two variations encountered (see below for a different perspective):\r\n\r\n* Cloning an issue part of an already finished sprint yields the clone to be considered part of that finished sprint, i.e. the clone shows the originating sprint within _Completed Sprints_ in the _Agile_ panel, which is obviously rather irritating already.\r\n** (!) Furthermore it is included in the sprint retrospective report as well of course, which actually screws up reporting with wrong data, thus can be considered a major bug in this regard.\r\n\r\n* Cloning an issue part of an active sprint yields the clone to be considered part of that active sprint as well, i.e. the clone ends up in the _To Do_ column on the Rapid Board, which I consider not to be the proper default at least (see below).\r\n** (!) It is definitely a bug in the current GreenHopper version though, insofar I'm unable to edit the clone in this regard, i.e. it is impossible to remove an issue from a sprint (which would be a helpful option to have anyway of course, if only to fix accidental additions).\r\n\r\n(?) However, a different viewpoint and/or use case might ask for exactly this behavior, which would ask for a respective option 'Clone Sprint' similar to 'Clone Links'. Options are best avoided of course, as long as a reasonable default is provided; in this regard I 'd consider it more appropriate to not include the sprint in the clone operation, because it is pretty easy to move the issue into the sprint later on (usually there are several edits to be done anyway).",

This does not make much sense for us, as the JIRA/GreenHopper administration is not done by the Scrum team themselves, but they need to be able to manage their sprints on their own.\r\n\r\nTherefore, we need to specify which users/groups/project roles are allowed to start a sprint independently from the \"Administer Projects\" permission.\r\nTo be honest, the reliance of GreenHopper on JIRA permission feels often inadequate and I hope that you find a way to manage GreenHopper permissions independently (this relates to GHS-1787, GHS-3928).\r\nAs long as this is not possible, maybe there is a way to at least separate starting a sprint from the \"Administer Projects\" permission? E.g. by adding a \"Manage Projects\" permission in JIRA that allows some of the things included in the \"Administer Projects\" permission?",

Example:\r\npublic Set<IssueField> getSortFields(User user, ProjectConfiguration projectConfiguration)\r\n{\r\n  I18n2 i18n = i18nFactoryService.getI18n(user); \r\n  TreeSet<IssueField> sortFields = new TreeSet<IssueField>(new IssueFieldComparator(i18n));\r\n}\r\nFor the internally use treeset an IssueFieldComparator is used. This comparator compares the translated field names and in case the field names are equal compares the field ids. The comparator turned out to be costly. Because the returned collection is a set, the order of the issues should not be of importance. \r\n\r\n*One Alternative Implementation*: Therefore a faster comparator could be used:\u000bpublic Set<IssueField> getSortFields(User user, ProjectConfiguration projectConfiguration)\r\n{\r\n  Comparator<IssueField> comparator = new Comparator<IssueField> () {\r\n  public int compare(IssueField issueField, IssueField issueFieldToCompare) {\r\n  if (issueField == null && issueFieldToCompare == null) {\r\n   return 0;\r\n  } else if (issueField == null) {\r\n     return -1;\r\n   } else if (issueFieldToCompare == null) {\r\n            return 1;\r\n   }\r\n   return issueField.getId().compareTo(issueFieldToCompare.getId());\r\n}    \r\n    \r\n",

[See the corresponding bug report|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSWCLOUD-5022].\n  {panel}\n\nHi all,\r\n\r\nhere is the use case:\r\n- have a release with 2 sprints\r\n- at the end of sprint 1, 1 story over 2 is completed. When releasing sprint1, the 2nd one is moved to sprint 2. Story 2 is completed in Sprint 2. Velocity graph will count Story 2 in both Sprint 1 and Sprint 2\r\n\r\nFor that:\r\n- create a version hierarchy with\r\n- 1 parent version : Release 1\r\n- 2 child versions : Sprint 1, Sprint 2\r\n- Create 2 stories and assign them to Sprint 1:\r\n- Story1 estimated with 5 Story Points\r\n- Story2 estimated with 8 Story Points\r\n- Resolve Story 1\r\n- Release Sprint 1. GreenHopper will propose you to move story 2 in another version. Select Sprint 2\r\n- Resolve Story 2\r\n- Display the velocity graph : go to the chart board, select version \"Release 1\", Value chart, Story points by children.\r\n- you would expect: 5 points done (Story 1) in Sprint 1, 8 points done (Story 2) in Sprint 2.\r\n- you will see : 13 points done (Story 1 + Story 2) in Sprint 1, 8 points done (Story 2) in sprint 2\r\n\r\n\r\nthanks to help.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nRuchi",

      "description": "As a Rapid Board user I would like to be able to see sub-tasks of top level issue types if they are not included in the filter my rapid board is based on.\r\n\r\nThe main problem being addressed here is that it is not possible to have a filter which includes user stories, but not their tasks and still have the tasks shown on the rapid board.\r\nA actual example of when this is required is the following. A company has X number of development teams that each have a rapid board. Each user story has a 'team' field which is tagged with the team currently working on the user story. The filter the rapid board is based could look something like 'team = \"teamname\"'. This filter would result in X amount of user stories being listed. With the current solution it isn't possible to list the subtasks of those user stories.\r\n\r\nWith the planning board this was not an issue as it would filter on fixVersion, which would include the subtasks. \r\n\r\nA workaround for this would be to simply tag the subtasks with the same team as the parent. While this is entirely possible, the hierarchy would break as soon as the team is changed on the parent.\r\n\r\nAlternatively the JQL could be more advanced and support queries such as \"issuetype = Task AND parent.team='teamname'\"",

      "description": "Twice I've raised this issue as a bug. The last time Atlassian was able to reproduce it and suggested me to raise it as a change request (https://support.atlassian.com/browse/GHS-4325). \r\n\r\nI would like the dialog window for \"Copy sub-tasks\" that is shown to the user when an issue is moved from one version to another in Planning View. This give the user the possibility to move parent and child issues to the next version, or to only move parent and explicitly chosen sub-tasks. \r\n\r\nWhen I've done this using the Task Board as I sometimes do, only the actual issue I'm choosing is being moved, no matter if there are sub-tasks or not. This has several times left me in a position where I have moved the parent issue and forgot about the subtasks. Later on I've had to identify the sub-tasks and move them manually one by one. \r\n\r\nPlease consider for later release. ",
