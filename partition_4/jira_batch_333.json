We use this data as well as many other inputs to feed into our prioritisation process. \r\n\r\nAllowing teams to have required fields on issue creation is something that will be available in next-gen, although it is not something that we will be focusing on in the next 6 months. We want to share this with you to ensure you can plan out your use of projects within Jira Software effectively. In the short term we recommend teams use classic projects when you need to mark certain fields as mandatory on issue creation. \r\n\r\nWe understand this is highly requested and seems like it should be quite basic to deliver, however we have some groundwork to undertake around the issue create experience which is a dependency for this work. We are prioritising the performance and scalability of the issue create experience as a first, and we will then get to overhauling the user experience of the global issue create view. We apologise for the inconvenience this is causing you.\r\n\r\nIt is worth calling out that it is possible to use the \"Check an issue's field\" [workflow rule|https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirasoftwarecloud/add-or-remove-workflow-rules-in-next-gen-projects-1005805110.html] to ensure a field is populated on transition of an issue (e.g. from \"To Do\" to \"In Progress\"). This may be sufficient for some of you, although it doesn't cater for the scenario where you need this data captured when the issue is first created.\r\n\r\nPlease do continue to vote and in particular please continue to add comments on how your teams find value with having required fields on issues. This contextual information of what you are doing and why you are doing is invaluable for us in providing you with a product that will grow with your needs.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nEoin Ryan\r\nProduct Manager\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a user, I'd like to be able to set\u00a0fields and custom fields as required on my Next-Gen projects as it is possible in Classic Projects.",

      "description": "Yes, there is a way both in classic and next get projects to link issues with \"blocked by\" and \"blocks\" link types between issues in different projects, but that is very cumbersome to setup and therefore usually not being used (too much friction, steps to complete, switching between projects, etc). So, as a result various\u00a0 workarounds are used. One example (that we are using in classic projects) is to have 2 boards for each project : 1 board is \"traditional\" and filters in only the issues fro that project and 2nd board is \"cross team\" board that filters in issues like this:\u00a0\r\n\r\n*project = MYPRJ or labels = MYPRJ ORDER BY Rank ASC*\r\n\r\nSo, when other projects add a label to their issues that matches the project key of the project they depend on - their issue will show up on that \"cross team\" board. Very easy to use, but creates other problems as you can imagine, since this is technically a \"hack\" or workaround if you will.\r\n\r\nSo, the request here is to add a cross project issues dependencies functionality to next-gen projects that could combine the pros of traditional old school issue linking and the hacks/workaround as one described above and make it so it is easy to setup a scenario where an issue from one project depends on another project - either the same issue shared between both or a new one created in the other project and linked IN ONE STEP and from the same screen/page of the original issue that has a dependency. The key here is that it must be simple and accessible, therefore use case / acceptance criteria:\r\n # User John creates issue PRJA- in project PRJA\r\n # User John\u00a0 opens details page for the issue PRJA-1\r\n # In that screen user John adds a dependency on the PRJB\r\n # Either creating issue PRJB-1 directly in PRJB, but without leaving the screen of PRJA-1\r\n # Or somehow specifying PRJB project key as dependency\r\n\r\n\r\n # When user Bob looks at the board of PRJB they either\r\n # see PRJB-1 created and linked to PRJA-1\r\n # or somehow see that PRJA and specifically PRJA-1 issue has a dependency on PRJB\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nAs far as issue types - either story, task, bug or even a \"special\" issue type for such inter-dependencies - does not really matter as long as it is easy to setup without switching back and forth between screens of two projects/issues.",

Summary\r\n\r\nWe would like the ability to control who has access to create/edit versions within a project. It appears the only way to currently do this is to grant the user project administrator permissions.\r\n\r\nA way to control this in the permission schemes would work well.\r\n\r\nI've seen the plug-in 'Version Manager for Jira' but this is for server only.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nCheers.",

But if *Story* is quite complex there is a need to solve it in several sprints. But sub-tasks should be closed in one sprint, current sprint.\r\n\r\nNow it is impossible to set the _Sprint attribute_ for sub-task - it is always inherited from the parent task.\r\nThe idea is to implement setup of the _Sprint attribute_ for sub-tasks in Story and process it on the _Active sprints_ board. \r\nSo it would be possible to create one Story, add sub-tasks, solve them during the sprint A. After the end of the sprint, move the Story into the next sprint B, and add new sub-tasks for this sprint. \r\nSub-tasks from sprint A will now be shown on the _Active Sprints_ board for the sprint B.\r\n\r\nAnd also it would be more close to usual Scrum workflow, i guess: *Epics* (for multiple sprints) -> *Story* (for one sprint or for multiple sprints) -> *Task* (strictly for one sprint)",

Bringing Components into next-gen project/board is not something that we will be focusing on in the next year. We want to share this with you to ensure you can plan out your use of projects within Jira Software effectively.\r\n\r\nIn the short term we recommend teams use classic projects when you need to use Components. We apologise for the inconvenience this may cause you.\r\n\r\nPlease continue to vote and in particular please continue to add comments on how your teams find value when using Components. This contextual information of what you are doing and why you are doing is invaluable for us in providing you with a product that will grow with your needs.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n Bryan\r\n Product Manager\r\n{panel}\r\nh3.
