That's not helpful.  Its hard to follow.  I asked around work and no one really gets it.  I know all the git clients seem to add that, but it doesn't help :(\r\n\r\n* git clients don't seem to want to deal with the source tree.  I'm used to seeing a tree type view where I can see all the files in the repo.  What I'd really like is to be able to look at a certain folder and see all the changes that have happened in that folder (according to my branch).  Basically a visualization of git log but filtered for the currently selected folder (and maybe optionally subfolders). When I select a change/commit, I'd like to be able to see details about it: commit message, files involved, diffs of the change\r\n\r\n* A time lapse view would be nice too:  This is like blame but lets me walk \"back in time\".  Its a view of the file (basically blame) but at the top I can see a timeline of all the changes that have happened to this file.  I can drag a slider (or something) to let me go to a different version of the file.  Ideally, the scroll position doesn't change.  This lets me watch how the file has changed - like I said, like blame, but easier to move between versions. Here's perforce's version of this: https://www.perforce.com/support/tutorial-video-library/video/using-time-lapse-view\r\n\r\n* There are times when I come to a branch I had worked on a couple of days ago, and I just want to see what's changed on this branch.  I really just want to see the commits since I branched so I know what I've changed.  I *think* that branch swim lane thing shows me this, but I see a bunch of other stuff too - stuff that happened before I branched.  I don't need to see that here.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnyway... those are just some of the gripes we've been having around the office.  I assume if these things annoy us, they probably annoy others as well.  ",

Until I updated for some unknown reason and now I just can't confirm your new shiny design popups from a keyboard because it just closes popup without confirming an action when I press Enter. It's definitely an unwanted behaviour because I press Esc when I am unsure I did the right thing. I press Alt-F4 when I am sure I did wrong thing and I press Alt-F4 when I am sad about a UI program over an essential tool for my work and I just go typing commands in Terminal and then cry as a bitch about my unhappy fate. And I press Enter when I am sure I am doing the right thing. When I Ctrl+Shift+R I am sure I want to revert selected files and I press Enter to confirm my intention and Source Tree just decides that I should calm the fuck down and think if I really want to revert my files. And I should Ctrl-Shift-R again pick up the goddamn mouse and press tiny little button OK AM REALLY WANT TO REVERT MY FILES JUST GO AWAY FUCKING POPUP WINDOW.\r\n\r\nPlease make popup windows understand Enter key press as confirmation.\r\n\r\nThank you!",
