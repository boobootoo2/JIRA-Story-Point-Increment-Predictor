Since user B did not explicitly give user A access, your saying this:\n\n* A fork action can lead to a reduction in available users\n* If you have a free account, you can only fork max. 5 repos that force private forks.\n\nThat seems both unfair as well as illogical.

An example is [this pull request|https://bitbucket.org/dealini/dealini/pull-request/139] (this is a private repo, but I hope you can take a peek anyway).\n\nThe pull request has two commits and was created yesterday. Today I made several comments in the combined diff view. These comments are now marked with \"outdated\" even though no new commits were added to the pull request.\n\nThe files in question _have_ changed in the main repository, though.

This allows us to use the pull request as a gateway for code review, and we really like it.  It also allows us to better control our \"truth\" repository (limited access to master/dev branches, no dangling rotting feature branches, etc).   (this is no different from the standard open-source method for collaboration)\n\nThe problem is that our employees&#x27; private forks have a collaborator limit capped at 5.  If we&#x27;re paying for the service, our employees shouldn&#x27;t have to pay to collaborate with their teammates, even though it _happens to be_ in their account.\n\nWe thought we might work around this by creating repositories named <REPO>-<username> for each teammate, but then we couldn&#x27;t figure out how to submit pull requests because they weren&#x27;t true forks.\n\nIf possible, we wanted to avoid employees working out of the truth repo day-to-day.  And they shouldn&#x27;t have to pay money -- because we did.\n\nWhat do we do?",
