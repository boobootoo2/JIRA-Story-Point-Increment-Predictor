I commented on my own snippet to provide some sort of heads-up to what the snippet is about and how to get it working (it&#x27;s a C# code snippet as a BitBucket snippet. Maybe this will be a future change? Allow snippet publishers to add a small description about their snippet just like the ReadMe feature for repos).\n\nThe issue I noticed is that after posting the comment and showing up (without page refresh which I like) it did not refresh the comment counter. Seeing the comment I just posted and the counter being still set to zero is a bit odd. I know this is not a big deal (who looks at the counter anyway when there are dozens of comments?) but thought I should report it.\n\nAlso I will take this time to say thanks for the awesome features you provide! once again as you do a fantastic job!\n\nWith respect,\\\\\nAndrei",

      "description": "Bitbucket supports such features as *milestones* and *versions*, but essentially those are just labels/tags just like *components* as you can do little with them. That would be nice if *milestones* and *versions* could reflect their actual terms.\n\nI could see a version having at least two states:\n\n* Active / In Progress\n* Released\n\nand milestones having different states as well:\n\n* Active / In Progress\n* Reached\n* Missed / Delayed\n\nA milestone&#x27;s state could be even provided automatically if there was a connection between them and actual dates. I don&#x27;t really know how other people use milestones, but I myself typically name them like \"2015-10-15\" and consider it as a milestone&#x27;s deadline.\n\nAnother thing is that there is no need in two such entities. You can think about a milestone as a date of a release. Therefore, that would be enough if there was such a thing as *version* (*release*) and a specific date assigned to it. A version is not necessarily a production release that you deliver, say, once a quarter, but could be any internal release as well.\n\nThe problems that currently exist with milestones and versions how they are implemented in Bitbucket:\n\n* They are basically tags and nothing else\n* They are directly connected in real life, but there is no way to make that connection between them in Bitbucket\n* If you treat them as actual versions and milestones, you have to do a lot of manual work and can introduce inconsistency in your issue tracker as you can easily assign a version and a milestone to an issue which are disconnected and not supposed to come along\n\nThat would be enough to have the only entity in fact: *Version* (or *Release*), and make it able to assign some due date to it. And considering that date, Bitbucket could automatically show the current status of that version.\n\nPS I understand that you are trying to keep Bitbucket as simple as possible, and make customers to eventually migrate to Jira when Bitbucket functionality becomes insufficient might also be a final goal. However, to be fair, this particular issue brings sort of inconsistency to the system and probably even makes the user experience worse. Also, I personally would prefer paying to Bitbucket if I needed to introduce more than 5 users for a project instead of paying for Jira because Bitcucket&#x27;s UI is still neat whereas Jira is incredibly overwhelming to me. Please just consider these points as well.",
