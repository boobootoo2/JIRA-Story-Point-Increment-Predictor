One of the things we've found is that, in order to represent the\u00a0full lifecycle of a project (conception, development & test, user acceptance,\u00a0launch and on-boarding activity), we're creating more and more\u00a0Agile boards which each focus on a different \"stage\" in the process.\n\nLooking at\u00a0the division of \"Stages\" in Portfolio as an example, with Team or Project-focused planning, it would be _really_ useful to be able to setup and\u00a0configure a single agile-board which represents those different stages.\n\nAs an example, I currently have 3 agile boards for 1 project:\n # Ideation & Design\n ## Kanban board which is used to prioritise and track pre-development work, especially important when I'm pulling-in\u00a0ad-hoc\u00a0role, such as Designers and Architects for short-term engagements\n # Development & Test\n ## Scrum board which is used by the development\u00a0& test teams to develop features and functions following\u00a0User Stories and addressing Bugs\n # UAT & Launch\u00a0\n ## Kanban board which is used to track UAT and Launch activity following\u00a0completion of development milestones / checkpoints using external constituents\u00a0who aren't dedicated to the project or\u00a0long-tail activity such as customer on-boarding following software release\n\nI could envisage\u00a0a \"meta-board\" which, perhaps follows or mimics my Portfolio stage configuration, combines several Agile Boards into a single place/link/menu option, separating the different boards\u00a0using tabs, and includes\u00a0a good summary\u00a0tab empowering project overview, health and statistics.",

Summary\nSub-Task Estimation that is linked to a parent Story that is part of an active sprint is then moved to a new parent that is added to the sprint after start (Parent Story is a registered Scope Change event), the sub-tasks are also counted as scope change and the Estimate is doubled for each sub-task moved, as it does not ever Burn Down when removed from the original parent only burning up when it is added as a scope change event.\n\nh3. Environment\n* JIRA Software Server\n* JIRA Cloud Tested in v1000.773.2\n\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\n# Set Estimation Statistics to \"Story Points\"\n# Set Time Tracking to \"Remaining Estimate and Time Spent\"\n# Create Story with Subtasks that have estimation\n# Add this parent issue to a planed Sprint\n# Start the sprint\n# Add a new Story without Subtasks to the Sprint (This is an intentional Scope Change event)\n# Move a subtask from the Parent issue in the sprint at the time the sprint started to the new parent that is registered as a scope change event\n# View the *Burndown Chart*\n\nh3. Expected Results\nSame behavior as Moving a Subtask between two Parent Issues that existed in the sprint at the time the sprint started the Estimation is not effected and continues to burn down as issues are completed\n\nh3. Actual Results\nthe Sub-tasks are also treated as a scope change event and the estimation is doubled for every sub-task moved to the new parent issue, as they are not removed from the original estimation \n!Screen Shot 2017-02-21 at 5.37.07 PM.png|thumbnail! \n\nh3. Notes:\nIf the issues are already counted as burn up, Move them back to the original Parent, this will not trigger an additional burn up but the value will still be inflated.\n\nh3.Workaround\nIf adding in intentional scope change for a story, make sure to move any subtasks to the issue before adding it to the active sprint to trigger a burn down with the sub-tasks before triggering the burn up with the parent and the sub-tasks together",

Problem Definition\nCurrently the behavior for custom fields displaying in tabs in the view issue screen isn't clearly defined in documentation.\n\nSpecifically they do not properly display unless they meet the following criteria:\n \n- All of the tabs have custom fields on them (including the default Field Tab).\n- At least one of those custom field types must not be a Date or People type (as those will show up in their respective sections in the view issue screen).\n- At least one of those custom fields must have a value.\n\n\nh3. Suggested Solution\nClearly define the behavior in documentation and possibly add this to \"Where is my field\" admin helper.\n\nh3. Why this is important\n\u00a0It is hard to isolate the root cause without testing and causes unnecessary user friction to isolate the point of failure. \n\n\u00a0",

I've listened to their arguments. However, based on years of experience, I submit that the inability to have multiple backlogs for a single project is stifling progress.\n\nOnce created, the purists can select one backlog anyway.. either way they will be happy. But for the many of us who move in and out of the box, we're limited in our planning and deployment. Time is wasted when a backlog simply becomes too large, and takes too long to sift through for Sprint planning, and in the end, we end up using an external tool anyway. So, either way, we are going to use multiple backlogs, and it would be preferable to have them all in the one location.\u00a0",

The answers to their questions should be made into user attributes.\u00a0\n\n2) Place Drip Pixel (log in for Drip account sent to Philip) --> This pixel should be placed on every single page including every web flow page and every zoomer page. THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT! I will submit a ticket to Drip to see what advice they have for webflow.\u00a0\n\n3) Create user events --> Each subscriber should trigger an event for 1) Starting the form and 2) Submitting the form at a minimum. But I also want to know how many other pages they have viewed so that should be an attribute/event as well. Basically anything we consider an event in Mixpanel should also be one in drip.\u00a0\n\n4) Create User Attribute for custom tool URL --> I need to be able to include the subscriber's unique link to the plan they made with the tool in a lot of these email so please make sure that custom attribute is included.\u00a0\n\nLet me know if I can provide any guidance or clarification!\u00a0\n\nDrip Help Docs:\u00a0https://www.drip.co/docs",
