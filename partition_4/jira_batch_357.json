      "description": "h3. Problem Definition\n\n_For reference, see DCON-211, DCON-424, DCON-708 please_\n\nAfter the Github API rate limit resumes, the DVCS connector seems to start its sync algorithm from scratch. It always restarts with repo #1, and repo #2 thru #12 get continually starved.\n\nI can manually restart the sync process on each repo and often clear things up but it be better for the DVCS connector to handle that more gracefully.\n\nh3. Suggested Solution\n\nChange the order in which repos are synchronized at the start of a sync cycle.  If the sync algorithm just resumed syncing from the \"most stale repo\" (or even just a round-robin scheduled), then organizations like ours would remain \"eventually in sync\" without manual intervention.\n\nPerhaps a useful logic change might be to remember the repo that was last rate-limited and resume syncing with that repo once the quiet time has expired?\n\nThis sort of round-robin syncing might be a bit more robust. Another alternative would be to start syncing the repo with the oldest known successful sync time (ie. start with the repo known to be most out-of-date). Either behaviour would be preferable to how it currently works.\n\nDVCS orders its repos alphabetically, and luck has it that our most active repo happens to start with the letter \"A\" (\"App1\"). So it always gets synced first each hour. But my current team is working on a repo at the end of the alphabet (\"Web2\") and its JIRA integration is getting completely starved by this rate-limit-sync bug.",

Any pull requests newer than the oldest 30 that are not updated after the time that the full sync (or first adding the GitHub account into JIRA) will not be synchronized. Any pull requests that have been changed since the full sync, regardless of whether they are among of the oldest 30, will be synchronized during a subsequent soft sync.\n\n*Workaround* start a soft sync (just clicking on the sync icon). This would synchronize changes in the pull requests.",

I assume this happened because \"mx-4.5\" is a subset of \"MX-4\".\n\nIs it possible to apply some rules to restrict which issues are linked to JIRA? For example, would it be possible to have commit messages with only upper-case JIRA issue numbers to be synced with JIRA? And also, only commit messages where the JIRA Issue number is \"explicit\" (example: MX-4 would be picked-up and linked to the MX-4 JIRA Issue, but \"emx-4\" would not be linked to MX-4?\n\nThanks,",
