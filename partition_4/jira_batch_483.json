      "description": "I believe this might be a bug in the Service Desk Mail handler. If a user responds to a JIRA Service Desk email notification using Touchdown for Android that's connected through Exchange Active Sync (EAS), an exception will be recorded in the log files and the comment will not be added to the issue.\r\n\r\nNote: Touchdown is a common Android application for interfacing with Microsoft Exchange for email, calendar, and contacts.\r\n\r\nAs a result, the issue is not updated with the comment and the assignee does not know the user commented. As you might imagine, that could lead to operational issues in responding to user requests in a timely manner.\r\n\r\nTo reproduce the issue, do the following:\r\n1. Service Desk Customer submits a request through the customer portal\r\n2. Service Desk Team adds comment to request\r\n3. Service Desk Customer receives email notification containing comment and replies from an Android device using Touchdown that's connected through EAS\r\n4. Log file will contain error message indicating the mail handler \"failed due to binary incompatibilities\"\r\n\r\nI've included the error below. A non-trivial number of our users use Touchdown, so it's a significant issue for us. Our current workaround is to monitor all emails that come into the IMAP folder and verify that the comment was created in the issue.\r\n\r\n{noformat}\r\n2014-09-30 15:39:50,894

First, we want to thank you for your feedback. Secondly, since our last update there has been progress related to internationalization that we want to highlight:\r\n* *[JSD 3.3|https://confluence.atlassian.com/servicedesk/jira-service-desk-3-3-x-release-notes-861178652.html]:* customers can change their language preference in the portal by selecting Profile under their profile avatar, and then choosing to Edit their profile. This means the [portal and future notifications will be sent to them in their chosen language|https://confluence.atlassian.com/servicedeskserver/managing-service-desk-notifications-939926348.html].\r\n* *[JSD 3.9|https://confluence.atlassian.com/servicedesk/jira-service-desk-3-9-x-release-notes-939711776.html]:* we've added JIRA Service Desk support for all the languages supported by the JIRA platform, which now brings the total number of languages supported by JIRA Service Desk to 20. While JIRA admins can set the default language for your instance, users also can select their preferred language in their user profile. This helps JIRA Service Desk be more flexible for organizations with a diverse workforce.\r\n* *[JSD 3.14|https://confluence.atlassian.com/servicedesk/jira-service-desk-3-14-x-release-notes-952618829.html]:* added dutch to a growing list of languages available, out of the box.\r\n* *[JSD 4.11|https://confluence.atlassian.com/servicedesk/jira-service-desk-4-11-x-release-notes-1014669135.html]:* implemented a feature allowing project admins to [provide translations for customer portal in multiple languages|https://confluence.atlassian.com/servicedeskserver/providing-help-in-multiple-languages-1014679294.html]\r\n\r\nWith this being said, we've been analyzing this request and the comments in it, and we understand that there is interest in expanding upon the existing internationalization features, and although we have exciting ideas related to this, they are not compatible with our current roadmap. For now, we have decided to include the request in the list for Future consideration, meaning that we see this as a candidate for our longer term roadmap, but will not be working on it at the moment and will re-evaluate it in the near future.\r\n\r\nBest regards\r\nRene Chiquete - JAC Champion\r\n{panel}\r\n\u00a0\r\n----\r\nDuring my evaluation I discovered that JSD is not able to offer a \r\n customer helpdesk in diffrent languages for diffrent customers.\r\n\r\nIn fact it is not even able to offer a proper helpdesk in an other\r\n language as English, because of bugs in mailgeneration and a stating page\r\n (http://<JIRA-BASEURL>/servicedesk/customer/portals) \r\n which does not seem to care about language at all.\r\n\r\nRegarding the missing possibilty to select a language as customer I have\r\n to state that I'm not only dissapointed but quite shocked.\r\n\r\nThere are countries in the world where the customer (and sometimes\r\n also the law) expect support in the local language. If a company wants to \r\n sell its products there AND also international, you always have the need\r\n a helpdesk in diffrent languages.\r\n\r\nI simply cannot understand that JSD does not offer this. \r\n As Jira Users can choose the language you already have anything you need to implement this:\r\n - a framework and a process to deal with translations.\r\n - a software which is capable of dealing with diffrent languages\r\n - a user profile implementation which deals with a language setting",

Having to save a copy, then go and attach, is laborious and very archaic - the customer experience is disappointed that this simple fucntionality hasn't been provided. Can someone please look into this as it's a big problem with the way a lot of customers report issues through the Portal. Thanks\r\n Jp",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSDCLOUD-792].\n  {panel}\n\nh3. Problem Definition\r\n\r\nWe've setup a dedicated service desk project, so we can have the issue types, workflows and so forth setup to suit/match the service desk workflow.\r\n\r\nIf an issue gets pushed across to the developer team, we then have a choice: Do we move the issue (and lose the tracking, SLAs etc in the service desk) or clone it and then move it (which \"wastes\" an ID and leaves gaps in the issue numbering).\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to have a simple \"Send to Developers\" or \"Copy to Project\" workflow which creates a duplicate of the issue in the (specified) developer project, and automatically links the service desk project issue to the developer project issue.\r\n\r\nThat would mean you can have a single helpdesk project for triaging issues, and the development team the flexibility to play around with the issue without impacting the SD team and metrics.",
