If there's already an automatic branch configuration present, your repository is most likely containing a lot of branches adhering to this pattern. This means it's quite tedious to browse through the branches if the branch comes after these branches adhering to the pattern.\r\n\r\nE.g. in Confluence there are currently 1252 branches starting with issue/, meaning if you've got a branch name ninja you'd have to browse through all of these. Although this is a matter of housekeeping, like deleting branches that have been merged in one of the upstream branches, I believe having a search on that dialog is a valid use case (similar to the *g*oto *b*uild dialog).

I tried using Branch Updater so that Bamboo could automate this merging. However, doing so breaks my build.\r\n\r\nMy builds produce artifacts named using the git SHA of the HEAD revision being built. While Branch Updater does merge master into the branch during the Source Code Checkout task, it does so without creating a commit. Only at the end of the build does a commit get created and pushed.\r\n\r\nTherefore, during the build, despite the working copy and git index containing the merged files, because there is no commit \"git rev-parse HEAD\" still reports the SHA of the latest commit of the branch. As a result the artifacts I produce are labelled incorrectly (they are named as if they contain pre-merge content while they actually contain post-merge content).\r\n\r\nPlease change Bamboo to commit the merge at the end of the Source Code Checkout stage instead and push that commit at the end of the build (if successful of course). With this approach, not only would the local git repo more accurately represent what is happening in the build, but I could use Branch Updater and still name my artifacts appropriately.\r\n",

      "description": "Actual: Gatekeeper by default starts the build by merging the branch to master. This creates a merge commit in the history.\r\n\r\nThe Bamboo UI for the build page says something like:\r\nChecked out: branch a1b2c3d4\r\nMerged with: master f9e8d7c4\r\n\r\nDesired: We'd rather rebase the branch onto master at the start of our Gatekeeper builds and force push the branch, to avoid the merge commit. There would be a checkbox in the Gatekeeper option box on the Branches tab, \"Rebase branch instead of merging. (git only)\" \r\n\r\nThe Bamboo UI would then say something like:\r\n\r\nChecked out: branch -a1b2c3d4-\r\nRebased onto: master f9e8d7c4\r\nPushed: branch 8a6b4c2a\r\n\r\nThis requires a bit of justification. First, why do we want it? And second, how could this be safe?\r\n\r\nFor background, we only want to use Gatekeeper for short-term (often single-commit) bug branches. For long-lived branches, we'll prefer to use Branch Updater and merge back to master manually at the end of the branch, most likely after a pull request.\r\n\r\nWe want Gatekeeper to do rebases because doing a merge commit for a branch with just a single commit on it messes up the revision history, which has an impact when we use git-bisect. Here are a couple of blog posts talking about why it's a good idea to use rebase or merge --squash when you land small branches on master, instead of merging.\r\n\r\nhttps://sandofsky.com/blog/git-workflow.html\r\nhttp://blog.izs.me/post/37650663670/git-rebase\r\n\r\nYou may or may not be convinced by those articles, but I hope you can at least see why _someone_ would want to do it that way, even if you don't approve of it for yourself!\r\n\r\nFor reasons like this, at our organization we always do \"git pull --rebase\" when we do our pulls.\r\n\r\nYou may have heard that rebasing public branches is inherently unsafe. This is basically good advice, but it's overblown. The publicity of the branch isn't what really matters; it's whether people have committed work on top of rebased commits.\r\n\r\nRebasing history is dangerous if other people have made commits on top of commits that you're rebasing, because it will force them to rebase their commits (by hand!) on top of your new rebased head. One way you can be sure that it's safe to rebase is if the branch is completely private and has never left your machine. In that case, it's impossible for anyone else to do a commit based on your private branch. But there are other ways to have reasonable assurances of privacy while still pushing your code to Bitbucket.\r\n\r\nFor example, if you push a branch whose name is {{private-dgf-BAM-13032}}, it would be very unusual for anyone to decide to arbitrarily start committing in your private branch. It's not impossible, but in practice, it won't happen.\r\n\r\nOur goal is to use Gatekeeper only with \"private\" branches; this wouldn't be enforced in a security sense, but via naming standards and public norms. So in those cases, it's perfectly fine for Gatekeeper to rebase them; the only person who will be impacted when my private branch is rebased is me.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, as long as I pull Gatekeeper's rebase into my repository with \"git pull --rebase\", (which, again, is what we always do at our organization) git will automatically recover from Gatekeeper's upstream rebase, and all will be well.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion: using Gatekeeper to rebase branches is safe and even desirable if you take reasonable precautions; we'd love it if Gatekeeper would support our workflow.",
