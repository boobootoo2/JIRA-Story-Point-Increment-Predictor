In case only one letter is lowercase (which happens easily in the heat of the moment), there is no link to JIRA on bitbucket. Yet the commit appears in JIRA&#x27;s commits section.\\\\\nI guess it&#x27;s an easy thing for you to fix this. On the other hand, it would make bitbucket feel more consistent.\n\nThanks in advance!",

Our team is using Jira and Confluence OnDemand happily for over a year now.\n\nWe are currently in the process of evaluating changing over to Bitbucket from GitHub as your pricing policies make a lot more sense.\n\nI signed up for a free 5-user account. Then I invited some members from my team in order to get the 3 extra spots you so prominently advertise in the right hand column of the landing page. They signed up too, and I can see that (see attached screenshot).\n\nExcept, I can&#x27;t push anymore. I got an email telling me I have to upgrade. What on earth? Needless to say my feelings are a little mixed with the Bitbucket evaluation right now.\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nKind regards,\\\\\nBojan",
