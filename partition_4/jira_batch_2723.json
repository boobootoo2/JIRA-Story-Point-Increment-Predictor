      "description": "I've witnessed huge delays between hitting a \"manual build\" button and seeing the plan actually be listed in the build queue.  The time can range from nothing to hours, and it seems to primarily be caused by slow svn checkouts of large projects.  If a bunch of large projects are sitting in an svn queue (I'm assuming there is one), the manual build seems to effectively disappear until the large projects have been built.  In addition, there's no way to prioritize the manually built project in front of the large continuous integration projects - even if the CI projects are in a separate build queue, they're all waiting on SVN, so they're effectively in a single queue.\r\n\r\nTo reproduce this, create some build plans with large sets of source files (we have about 14k source files in our legacy projects), make them run in a continuous integration manner, then try to run some other projects using a manual build.  There's no feedback as to what is happening, and no way to get around it, which is frustrating our developers to no end.\r\n\r\nI'd be happy with either of these fixes:\r\n 1. Display projects that are scheduled for SVN polling in the build queue.  That way we'd know what's really waiting for an SVN checkout - but we'd also need projects in a separate build queue to not have wait for the SVN poll for a build in another queue to complete.\r\n 2. Display a SVN queue, showing which projects are waiting for an update\r\n\r\nEither way, manually built projects should jump to the front of the SVN queue.",

(Actually we have more, but two is enough to demonstrate the problem.)\r\n\r\nAdding a new plan to either project doesn't automatically get it assigned to a build queue, so its initial build doesn't happen until I go in and add the new plan to a queue in Administration.\r\n\r\nI can see a few possible solutions, in order of my preference:\r\n\r\n1. Let me pick the build queue when I create the plan.\r\n\r\n2. Allow projects to be assigned to queues, as well as plans. New plans in a project go to the queue for that project. (This would suit our stable/trunk breakdown.)\r\n\r\n3. The administrator could designate one queue as the one to be used for new plans. Any newly created plan would be added here when created.\r\n\r\n4. Bamboo could add new plans to the first build queue always. Not always what you'd want, but at least the plan would run and you could configure it later if it's the wrong one.\r\n",

This works great in bamboo, however this one view destroys the privacy of the projects. Error loggings name by detail the project which caused the error.\r\n\r\nPlease change this view, so that users can only see the error they should be allowed to see.\r\nThis issue is critical to us, because it prevents us from adapting bamboo for multiple projects",
