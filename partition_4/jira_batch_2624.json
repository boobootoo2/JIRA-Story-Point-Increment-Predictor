Problem Definition\r\n\r\nCurrently, when starting a build in Bamboo (either manually or through triggers), the build is automatically associated with the HEAD at the time the build is put in the queue, i.e. the build is executed with the latest version of the files in the repository at the time the build is triggered.\r\n\r\nOn busy systems, a long time may pass between the time a build is queued and when it is actually executed. This in turn means that there may be more commits to the repository before the build starts, however these commits are ignored since the version of the repository to build with was already determined when the build was first queued.\r\n\r\nWhile this may work in most situations, there are circumstances where this behaviour is not desirable and where it would be more efficient and sensible for a build to be run against the latest version of the repository at the time when the build is actually starting, regardless of which version was in the repository when the build was queued.\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nA configurable option should be provided (potentially on the plan level) to allow administrators to determine which policy to use (HEAD at time of queuing or HEAD at time of execution).\r\n \r\nh3.

Funny thing is on re-run, i.e, with out changing anything at all, the build will be a success.\u00a0Any idea why this is happening?\u00a0\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you require any more information from my part.\r\n\r\nWarm Regards,\r\n-Jewel",

I was floored to discover how much faster that was.\r\n\r\nFYI, the remote agents were connected to the local LAN, over (at least) 1Gb/s connections. Also, the artifact-download part of this task was very quick, < 20sec(?). The data clearly indicated it was the artifact-publish part that was the bottleneck.\r\n",

      "description": "Hi Guys,\r\n\r\nI need you to think with us, if you want to :-) Because we are facing a bit of a technical issue with the Elastic Bamboo feature.\r\nWe are hosting Bamboo on our internal Hyper-V platform at our office, already for months. But because Bamboo is growing (in number of projects) we need to get faster agents. So, we came across the Elastic feature, which is looking great and hooks into our long term vision because we are already working with Amazon EC2 and VPC. \r\nSo, we've turned it on, and then the confusion started. We don't really want to open up Bamboo to the outside world from within our office, there is a firewall in front blocking the traffic right now. So, we've booted up an Elastic agent with a public IP and added that to firewall to be able to access Bamboo, fine until here. But, when that agent is terminated and a new one is spawn, it gets another external IP.\r\nSo we switched our idea to the VPC with an Internet Gateway, but then you face the issue of NAT in your VPC. We need to run an instance to make it even possible to get traffic to the internet, that is not very handy.\r\n\r\nSo, now we are stuck. What can we do? Can we use a proxy when booting up the Elastic Agent? Can we use Elastic IP's (a pool of them)? Or is a VPN from the VPC to our office the only way?\r\n\r\nI hope you can help!\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n\r\nDennis",

The result is a set of artifacts to create a Release with for Deployment.\r\nThe deployment is split up in environments: Integration, Test, Acceptance, Production. The deployment happens with a set of tasks - irrelevant which they are. Now the issue is that Bamboo holds no concept of \"sites\" or \"application\". Unless I split up the deployment projects in \"Integration application A\", \"Integration appliciation B\", ... Of course we don't want that (we generally deploy everything in one go due to dependencies between de applications).\r\nAt the moment we wrote a plugin which lets us select \"applications\". It translates it into a variable and updates the variable of the Environnment when de deploy is started.\r\n\r\nh1. Proposed solution\r\nA Deployment Project (object), should be able to hold some simple metadata which defines the applications that live on this Environment. (At the moment we abuse a comma-seperated variable for this). When a Deployment is started and the applications are defined, you can select which \"applications\" are to deployed to this environment. Technically - Bamboo could reuse the concept of the VariableContext and create a special type of Variable for this. Generally also allowing a \"custom run\" if users which to specifiy other variable.\r\n\r\nh1. Integration with JIRA\r\nJIRA already integrates with Bamboo - and tells us which Environments have been deployed to. When transitioning issues - we could also query the list of Applications from Bamboo and \"check\" the applications. This can than be used at the end of spring to create a list of applications that need to deployment.\r\nThis is a common problem - where developers don't generally know what to deploy at the end of the release process (so people end up deploying everything).\r\nAt the end of the Agile sprint. When a version is released - the version will propose the list of the applications to be deployed - based on the checkboxes selected in all the jira issues of this sprint.\r\n(At the moment we abuse a custom field and a tagcloud to see which applications have to be deployed).\r\n\r\nh1.CI summary\r\n# I handle an issue in JIRA, when transitioning an issue and applications are defined in Bamboo environments, I can select them\r\n# When releasing a version in JIRA - I can see the list of applications impacted by all issues in the sprint\r\n# I can specify a list of applications (if they are defined in Bamboo) when I start a deploy - so a variable is passed to the Deployment where I can act on these applications.

I had lots of \"hanging\" java processes which I had to kill -15 manually.\r\n\r\nPlease consider the OS provided infrastructure for starting and stopping services.

However perhaps factoring this out into configuration in Bamboo which can be updated manually by users, or from a resource hosted on an Atlassian site which can be updated when AWS change their instance types. Upgrading Bamboo software versions seems a painful way to deal with this.\r\n\r\nPlease update the instance types available for elastic image configuration, and possibly consider a different approach for this configuration.",

      "description": "h3. Bamboo is special because of (kinda important to know / understand )\r\nFirst of all, i really like Bamboo and the most important *USP* compared to Hudson (any other) is the Release and Deploy Integration.\r\nNot only keeping track of what got released, comparing those and having proper artifacts, it also helps maintaining different environments and levels of deployment, e.g. before it reaches market A, customer EAP or just the whole public.\r\n\r\nWe do release our software (different ones, including a jira and conlfuence plugin, but also C++, JRuby, Ruby, PHP an more) using the release numbers in bamboo. This is a very important thing to us, since this reflects back in jira issues and tells everybody, when it has been released. Not only internally this is a very important thing to know, but also during customer support and questions like \u201cdo i already have this fix / feature?\u201d. Not to speak about the changelog feature we can simply generate.\r\nTherefore we do not use a different version-system for the software we ship to the customer, we use only the one in bamboo so we can talk about exactly the same releases in the public, in jira, in the support, in the docs, support and marketing - just everywhere.\r\n\r\nThis is an important fact to understand to actually see what we miss - and you actually offer by 90% ( and no other software ). \r\n\r\nh3. How we use Bamboo\r\nBuild and test in build0tasks by design - generating build-artifacts (jars, tars, whatever)\r\nThis happens on every commit, all day long - as it is supposed to be with CI\r\nWhen we decide to release a build, we\r\n# a) *important*: create a release-version in Bamboo for this build\r\n# b) *important*: We HACK the \u201cfirst environment\u201d to build a *release* artifact, lets say a 'maven based jar', based on the release-vesion, which is ONLY available in the deploy-task and thus in this missued environment \r\n# c) *important* : the PSEUDO artifact created in b) is checked in into a project-based \u201crelease artifact\u201d repo - a hack for every projet\r\n We use all other environments to deploy to actual environments using the release-repo\r\n\r\nAs you see, we can't use the build phase due to the absence of the \u201crelease version information\u201d, thus we cannot really create a special \u201crelease artifact\u201d in the build phase, lets say in a manual stage as supposed by Joshua\r\n\r\nBeing forced to move this into the deploy tasks (where the release version is available by design), lets you hack every single deploy task, it basically flanks your whole concept of artifacts. And even more important, there are no \u201cdeploy artifacts\u201d or say \u201crelease artifacts\u201d. So what i described for a-c happens for every single project, a hack by design.\r\n\r\nh3. A lot of potential to break\r\nSomebody does not run the pseudo first \u201cbuild the release task\u201d but rather hits the other releases first -> releases an old version out of the release repo. In addition, if you want to chain environments, you can really do that, since they have no order. So if you chain, it can happen, that the build-the-release-artificat environment runs later, with the issue described above.\r\n\r\nh3. But this is not even all of it\r\nrecreating the release artifact will lead to *huge* duplication of complex build tasks in every environment. This will make maintenance a nightmare in addition, recreating is a huge waste of ressources and basically no option\r\n\r\nWhat i ask for or what i would like to propose is, why we don\u2019t introduce \u201crelease artifacts\u201d and a release task for a deploy-project.\r\nFor each deploy project, you define a \u201crelease task\u201d which does all the re-building based on the release-version. This artifact is based on the build-artificat - at least with a changed version and maybe \u201cmore minimized, obfuscated, concatinated, cleand up, removed debug info\u2026\"\r\nduring the release-creating, this task is run and will create an release artifact\r\nthis artifact can then be used in all deploy-environments for whatever kind of deployments, wherever needed\r\n\r\nh3. Alternatives\r\nOn the summit, i got told by Joshua, that you inject a version in a manual stage of the build phase and create a special release artifact. Thus you have 2 different versions for a product.\r\n\r\nThis deletes a lot of other features you have and beside that, that is *the usp* compared to hudson, teamcity / whatever\r\nReleasing in Jira does just create an arbitrary release number nobody cares of. You cannot really talk with the customers about that or relate to that, since the software version (injected in the build phase) differs from the version show in jira (bamboo release version)\r\nreleasing from jira does not make any sense\r\n\u201cRelease\u201d does not make any sense at all in bamboo, if you flank it with your own versioning-metric which is invisible to bamboo - it should rather then be removed to have at least a clean concept\r\n\r\nh3. Too long but still..\r\nI am open to any suggestions or solutions, but as far as discussed with Joshua, this is basically not possible to work-arround. Since you introduced the importance of artifacts, you introduced the release linkage and comparision in jira and bamboo, you released huge new features based of versions in jira with jira-software, you should now really think about the importance of this version in bamboo and the consequences.\r\n\r\nI would really love to see this \u201cversions\u201d becoming that huge, as you implemented them in jira and artifacts as important as you did in bamboo .Thanks!",
