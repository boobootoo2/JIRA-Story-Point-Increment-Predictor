      "description": "I have an issue with a scp copy job copying artifacts to a remote system. It seems to work correctly (as in build stage creates a valid artifact, deploy stage references that artifact) but executes the actual copying of the artifact twice (one with the current version of the artifact, once with an older version of the artifact). This results in my freshly compiled and packaged application being replaced with a version from a previous build, which is a problem.)\r\n\r\nStrangely the artifact-link is correctly offered in the bamboo webapp, It also looks fine from the file structure view of the build-stage, just when the deploy-stage begins it seems to copy the current and an old version of the artifact to the working directory and then proceeds to scp both files to the remote location.\r\n\r\nHere is the relevant part of the log:\r\n\r\n{noformat}\r\nsimple\t24-Mar-2014 11:22:56\tStarting task 'Copy WAR File to Tomcat' of type 'com.atlassian.bamboo.plugins.bamboo-scp-plugin:scptask'\r\nsimple\t24-Mar-2014 11:22:56\tConnecting to host.domain.de on port: 22\r\nsimple\t24-Mar-2014 11:22:56\tUploading 'D:\\bamboo-home\\xml-data\\build-dir\\260997122\\PROJECT-TB-DEP\\SW-0.6.5-SNAPSHOT.war' to '/home/aemat/webapps/SW.war'...\r\nsimple\t24-Mar-2014 11:22:58\t'D:\\bamboo-home\\xml-data\\build-dir\\260997122\\PROJECT-TB-DEP\\SW-0.6.5-SNAPSHOT.war' was uploaded successfully.\r\nsimple\t24-Mar-2014 11:22:58\tUploading 'D:\\bamboo-home\\xml-data\\build-dir\\260997122\\PROJECT-TB-DEP\\SW-0.6.4-SNAPSHOT.war' to '/home/aemat/webapps/SW.war'...\r\nsimple\t24-Mar-2014 11:22:59\t'D:\\bamboo-home\\xml-data\\build-dir\\260997122\\PROJECT-TB-DEP\\SW-0.6.4-SNAPSHOT.war' was uploaded successfully.\r\nsimple\t24-Mar-2014 11:22:59\tFinished task 'Copy WAR File to Tomcat'\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nAs you can see there are two files beeing copied to the remote server: the first file is the current product of the build, the second one is the \"old\", deprecated file.\r\n\r\nplease advise, what can i do, where can i look?",

This is a new agent I am trying to add. The actual issue I have is that the publish artifact fails using this agent. I don't know whether the IP address discrepancy would resolve the original issue or not, but have a suspicion. We recycled the Bamboo server as well. Blew away the agent couple of times and recreated it. Tried putting the IP address in the hosts file on the Bamboo server. Nothing helped. By the way, it is a windows platform. \r\n\r\nCan you please help resolve this issues?\r\nThanks\r\nKailash\r\n",

Now the issue with SVN is that when we add a shared repo with a gloabl variable and have this overridden by plans, Bamboo still assumes the plans are using same repo.\r\n \r\n*Steps to replicate*\r\n# My repository is located in the URL: https://sultan-PC/svn/\r\n# So I created a shared repo with the URL: https://sultan-PC/svn/${bamboo.svnpath}\r\n!shared.png|thumbnail!\r\n# Configure a global variable svnpath that can point to any location.
