      "description": "As we talked recently at AtlasCamp (with James H.) we heavily use Javascript objects from GH realm to deliver functionality of our Agile Cards for JIRA plugin (as of 2.1 it can print issues: cards, columns, all, sprints from GH Boards).\n\nSo the things we would love to have (and currently need to hack) are:\n\n1) pluggable (web-item) Tools menu\n2) pluggable (web-item) operations on columns in the board\n3) pluggable (web-item) operations on the Sprint planning marker\n4) stable Javascript API for accessing cards (also currently selected) and the boards. See below for more details.\n\nBTW:\nwe had to deliver different fixes/workaround for _each_ new GH version between GH 6.0 and 6.0.3 (so 6.0.1 and 6.0.2 too) as in each of these minor versions JS changed slightly causing our plugin to blow off.\n\nWe use the following unofficial GH Javascript stuff (notes from our developer):\n\n{quote}\n\n// Spartez AgileCards 2.1.3 javaScript Grennhopper dependencies--\n\n//\n// DOM\n//\n\n// Board mode [plan/work/report]\nGH.RapidBoard.State.getMode();\n\n// Selected issue keys (array)\nGH.RapidBoard.State.getBoardSetting(null,'backlog.selectedIssues'); // plan mode\nGH.RapidBoard.State.getBoardSetting(null,'work.selectedIssues'); // work mode\n\n// User specified board name\nGH.PlanController.rapidViewData.name;\n\n// User specified sprint name by sprintId\nGH.BacklogModel.getOpenSprints(); // :-/ could be better - I must use foreach() to get correct name by id\n\n// Active sprint issue list (array)\nGH.BacklogModel.getIssueListForSprint(sprintId).data.visibleIssues; //GH 6.0.1-6.0.2\nGH.BacklogModel.getIssueListForSprint(sprintId).data.visibleIssueKeys.toArray(); //GH 6.0.3\n// It would be nice if there was a similar function for planned sprints\n\n// Rapid board work mode column name\nGH.RapidBoard.RapidListDataController.getColumnById(columnId).name; //GH 5.8.7\nGH.GridDataController.model.data.columns; // :-/ I want back GH 5.8.7 function\n\n// Issue keys by columnId\nGH.GridDataController.model.data.columnIssueMapping[columnId];\n\n\n//\n// Overriden functions to add UI elements (we call our functions after the following)\n// It would be nice if there was an events after refresh page content\n//\n\n// to add dropdown menu item\nGH.ViewActions.renderOnRapidBoard();\n\n// to add print active sprint icons\nGH.BacklogView.draw();\nGH.BacklogView.updateOpenSprint();\n\n// to add print planned sprint icons\nGH.BacklogView.renderBacklog();\nGH.BacklogView.updateSingleMarker();\n\n// to add print column icons in work mode\nGH.SwimlaneView.show();\nGH.RapidBoard.SwimlaneView.show();\n\n\n\n//\n// Used HTML objects\n//\n\n// dropdown menu\nAJS.$(\"#js-view-actions-list\");\n\n// Active sprints\nAJS.$(\".ghx-sprint-active\");\nAJS.$(\".ghx-sprint-active\").attr(\"data-sprint-id\");\n\t..(\".ghx-headline\").append(link);\n\n// Planned sprints\nAJS.$(\".ghx-planned-sprint-container\");\nAJS.$(\".ghx-planned-sprint-container\").attr(\"data-marker-id\");\n\t..(\".ghx-controls\").append(link);\n\n// Work columns\nAJS.$(\"#ghx-column-headers .ghx-column\");\nAJS.$(\"#ghx-column-headers .ghx-column\").attr(\"data-id\");\n\t..(\".ghx-column\").prepend(link);\n{quote}\n\nAny feedback on how to remove some of these unofficial calls or when it will be incorporated in UI would be much appreciated.",

Remember that he cannot even browse project ABC but he can edit the Sprint Field and add the sprint id (1, in this case):\n!8-alphacreatesissue.png!\n# ... so when he tries to view ABC-2 he cannot:\n!9-permissionviolation.png!\n# However, ABC-2 has been added to the sprint:\n!10-issueadded.png!\n\nShould this be possible?

      "description": "The new planning board is great and solves many of our cross project type of problems. Thank you very much! However when using the new view we divide out backlogs into sprints instead of dividing the backlog using different versions in the classic planning board. The new view is much more easy to work with especially the simplicity to do re-planning (change sprint velocity) just by dragging and dropping the bottom part of the sprint boxes. However we lost one very important thing moving from Fix-version to the new artifact \u201cSprint\u201d and that is the visibility of the future plan of a backlog items. \n\nProblem\nWhen requesting information about an Issue (User Story), the Agile Panel on the issue view page contains information regarding only the started or completed sprints in which the issue has been planned. For us and I do think for others as well it is crucial to know when an Issue (User Story) has been planned in the future.\n\nFeature request\nWe really need to be able to be able to find out the name of a sprint to which and Issue have been assign even though the sprint is not yet started. The information is needed both in the issue browser view and in the REST API.\n\nThank you,\nPetru\n",

At least five people in our company (two project managers, product manager, release manager and QA manager) have all independently complained to Atlassian or myself about this deficiency (the Agile board is coming along nicely, don't get us wrong!).\n\nNow with sprints decoupled from Fix Versions, there is no easy way to see on the Agile Plan, Work or Report tab which issues are designated for which release. The Classic pages had this as you could easily add Fix Version as data to each card as well as click between Fix Version buckets on the right to see what was going where. We do sprints and of course usually have a release at the end of the sprint, but most of the time there are a few releases during the sprint. Looking at the Work tab, you have zero idea which items are slated for which release. Also, now that Classic is deprecated, you have to cross reference with some JIRA filters and your Work tab to see which issues have an assigned Fix Version.\n\nI propose the ability to see the Fix Version on the Work tab, or have some type of Release tab so we can see which issues are slated for which Fix Versions easily. There's probably a better solution, but just looking for some visibility into Fix Version.\n\nShaun said we could use Card Colors to denote this, but that isn't going to work as\n# the colors will mean nothing to most people and we'll constantly have to look at the legend in the Configure tab to make any sense of them\n# we'll have to update the Fix Version filters for each card color after each release (thus making #1 even worse since colors will change)\n\nThoughts?",

However if it's already opened then it will refresh to the currently selected issue (same behaviour as work mode).\n* If a filter is applied and the selected issue is filtered out then issue detail is closed. \n* Multi-select - if issue detail is open, display the last selected issue. If it's closed, don't open it. \n\n\n(!)

If so, is there any collision with S + T?\nA: Shortcut will be T. ST should rank the issue without showing the issue detail if it's not open. If it is, ST selects the next issue that was below the one that moved so this would then appear in the detail view. \n\nQ: How performant is it with thousands of issues?\nA: (x) Not Answered No idea yet.",

[See the corresponding bug report|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSWSERVER-5914].\n  {panel}\n\nThis was found on http://ecosystem.atlassian.net by [~jgordinier].\n\nIt is reported that [certain issues|https://ecosystem.atlassian.net/secure/IssueNavigator.jspa?reset=true&jqlQuery=project+in+%28UPM%2C+AMKT%29+AND+issuetype+%21%3D+Approval+AND+issuetype+%21%3D+%22Approval+Subtask%22+AND+%28component+%21%3D+Approvals+OR+component+%3D+EMPTY%29+AND+status+%21%3D+Triage+AND+%22Bonfire+Browser%22+is+not+empty+and+sprint+is+empty+and+resolution+%3D+Unresolved+ORDER+BY+Rank+ASC], which were raised with Bonfire, are not appearing on the [SF Ecosystem Rapid Board|https://ecosystem.atlassian.net/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=23&view=planning].\n\nAn example of such an issue is UPM-2285. It appears in the search results when viewing the filter backing the board in Issue Navigator, but it does not appear on the board.\n\nI have checked the following common causes:\n* Status mapping - is *Open* status\n* Sprint and Rank field configurations - all normal\n* Empty Sprint field\n* No active filters\n\nWhat's interesting is that, when viewing the issue from View Issue page, if I choose the 'Go To Agile Board' operation, it attempts to go to the board, only to not find the issue (select it) once it gets there. Normally, when an issue does not appear on a board, the operation will fail.\n\nAnother interesting fact is that, once the issue is Ranked To Top/Bottom from View Issue page, it suddenly appears on the board. So you would think that it might be an indexing issue. But if I do a simple edit of the issue's description, this does not solve the problem. So it could be a problem with the rank index.\n\nI do not have access to the logs to check what's going on -- this will be my next port of call.\n\n*Workaround*\n\nBump the Query Result Limit on ecosystem.atlassian.net. You can safely bump it to 1500-2000; I imagine setting it to ~5000 wouldn't cause too much havoc;\n\nRefine your board filter (or create a new board) to reduce the number of issues that appear in your backlog. One could argue that having ~5,000 issues in a backlog is not very manageable.",
