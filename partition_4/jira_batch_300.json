The JQL search function promises great power in this area, but in practice I find it almost unusable. Why? My firm's Jira installation reports 414 field names, but the dropdown list only lets me see the first ten, from \"Additional RCA\" to \"Assigned Team\". And the \"Search\" box is no such thing. It lets me type the first few letters\u2013but if I don't know the first letters, I can't match on a string in the middle of the name. And I see no obvious way just to see the whole list of available fields, which would at least let me use the browser's Ctrl-F.\r\n\r\nI find it very difficult to effectively search the ticket database. This is a serious enough drawback that I would never willingly use Jira on a project if my employer did not require it.",

Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nAdd the _\"Closed sprint, ended by <user name>\"_\u00a0in the Sprint report for Team-Managed projects\r\nh3. Why This Is Important\r\n\r\nIt's important to track who has completed a Sprint.\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nCheck in the History section from the issues when/who changed the Sprint. But it will not always mean a \"Sprint completed\" event in case the user has just moved the issue from Sprint to another without completing it.\r\n\r\nAnother option is to create an Automation to be triggered when a Sprint is closed for the\u00a0Team-Managed project and add the following smart value:\r\n{code:java}\r\n{{rule.actor.displayName}}\r\n{code}\r\nAnd change the rule's actor to \"User who triggered the event\"",

      "description": "h3. Problem Definition\r\nWhen using a team managed (previously known as next-gen) kanban style project, the only way to move issues from the backlog and into the board is to either click and drag that issue into the board section, or right click/use the ellipsis (...) in order to select the 'Move to board' option.\r\n\r\nFurthermore when an issues is moved from backlog to board, no issue fields on the issue are uniquely changed here (aside from possibly Rank).  Whereas in Company managed Kanban, when an issues moves from backlog to board, the status of that issue changes.\r\n\r\nThere are no other locations in Jira where you can change what appears on that Team managed kanban board.\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\nIt would be great if there was some kind of flag that would appear on the issue data itself to help determine what issues are on the board vs which issues are in the backlog.  This could then be an issue field that Automation could set when certain conditions are met.  This could be a new custom field, or even if the backlog was a separate status that would then change when the issue is moved to appear on the board.\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Why this is important\r\nCustomers want to be able to automatically shift issues onto the board.  This is possible to do in Company managed projects because a status changes.  This is also possible in Team Managed Scrum, because these can use the sprint field in order to set a value in order to make sure it appears on the board.\r\nBut this is not currently possible to do in team managed kanban projects.\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround \r\nOne way to use automation to move issues from backlog to board is to enable the Sprints feature for this project.  This then gives each issues in that project a sprint field that can be set.  Automation can then be configured to Edit the issue and set a value for that sprint field.  When an issue gains a value to that field, this also makes it appear on the board instead of the backlog view only.",
