Deleting, renaming the status and messing up the epic?\nA: (/) Yes - the \"options\" are configurable from JIRA's Custom Field admin UI (Configure).

Clipping or ellipsis would not help much. We can fit 5 digit numbers before this occurs.\n\nQ: What happens when the nav items exceed the available space?\nA: (/) Unlikely with expected usage but possible as there's a plugin point there. After a point they would be clipped and unavailable to click.
