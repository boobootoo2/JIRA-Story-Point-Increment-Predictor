In other words which teams are needed to realize an epic en which features do they have to complete in order to do so.\nThe teams would like to see the features in the backlog under the epic link as the features are the big items they need to work on as a team. however Jira can only show EPICs, which basically means that all EPICS will be shown on every team backlog even if epics do not require effort from your team. Due to this limitation we now have changes all Epics to Features and all Features to Epics.\nNow the Epic list on the backlog of the teams only shows which the epics that are assigned to that specific team.\n\n3.\nEpic link: Why is the epic link nothing more then a label?\nIf I drag items from the backlog to the epic link the field epic link is filled with the epic however it is not a real link. as when I really want to link stories to epics I have to go the link option and choose realizes and search for the Epic I want to link the story to. Only this way it appears as an child of the EPIC on the structure board.\nWhy can it not directly make a real link.\n\n4.\nUnable to link items on creation.\nI now first need to create the issue and then edit the issue again and choose for link in the menu.\nWhy can I not link it directly without having to reopen the item again.\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nMaarten Uppelschoten\n\n",

After overwhelming feedback on this ticket and through other channels we decided to roll back this implementation. While the feature alleviated pain for some customers, it unfortunately did not meet customer expectations.\r\n\r\nWe will be exploring different solutions and will keep you updated. Thank you everyone for your ongoing feedback and patience.\r\n\r\nWe understand that some of you may still be interested in using the earlier implementation. As a result, for a limited time, we will be offering customers the ability to opt in and trial the initial implementation.\r\n\r\nBefore opting in please consider how this will impact you:\r\n * The experience will mirror that of Classic Projects in Jira Software Server - there is no configurability / toggle\r\n\r\n * Once active this will be enabled across your entire Jira Software site and will impact all users\r\n\r\n * Eventually this implementation will be replaced with an updated experience, so this opt-in will only be temporary, and the change of experience may occur without advanced notice\r\n\r\nIf you are a site admin and want to opt in, please submit your details on this [form|https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfHABAGahDbmEkmSclcscQHTp9Dawpxxz4AfOE964CCwvUQ1A/viewform]\r\n\r\nWe will only consider requests made by a site admin due to the impact it will have on all users.\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\n\r\nAndrew\r\n\r\nJira Software\r\n{panel}\r\nh4. Summary\r\n\r\nCurrently kanban columns are auto-sized to fit to screen and when using a small screen, the size of the columns makes them completely unusable.\r\nh4. Suggestion\r\n\r\nAs an agile project manager, it is desirable to have horizontal scrolling available on kanban boards. \r\n It would also be desirable to have some minimum width after which a scroll bar will appears to allow side scrolling.\r\n\r\nCreate a configuration to toggle this feature ON and OFF.",

      "description": "We use JIRA onDemand and have purchased the JIRA Agile add on - we love it but we do have one small niggle.\n\nWe understand that Scrum performs best when you have physical boards and co-located teams, we aren't in that position. We are globally distributed over multiple timezones and our team members perform their Daily Scrum via Skype or Google Hangouts etc and from experience it seems that many companies are doing the same thing - Scrum is going distributed.\n\nOne thing we  have realised is the importance of the team being able at a glance see how their Sprint is going - and if we had a physical board we would be able to easily tell how many \"stickies\" were either in progress, or to - do. \n\nNow with the Active Sprint view - it does give that information - but you have to scroll up and down for it, and it's hard to get that \"big but quick glance picture\".\n\nWe have experimented with other tools such as RealTimeBoard - that has a great zoom and  the teams felt that using that tool it bridged the gap between the virtual board and a physical board. However JIRA is better at managing a backlog than RealTimeBoard with all it's filters, searching, tagging, bug raising etc so we have stuck with it.\n\nI would love it if the Active Sprint view was effectively a canvas that you could scroll, pan, and zoom in/out on (though I appreciate that it's a biggy...:) .\n\nKeep it up.\n\nThanks\n\nDamien",

      "description": "Hi,\nI have observed a specific problem at several of my clients for which I think I have a functional solution and I would like to ask if it is possible that this feature would be implemented in a future version of JIRA Agile.\n\nNext to (user) stories (describing e.g. new functionality) many of the teams of my clients also add Issue Types such as \"Impediments\" or \"Improvements\" to their sprints. If the swimming lane is set to 'Stories\" these non-story type of Issues usually end up on the bottom of the board (as they have no subtasks). Quite often, I get the question of it is possible to make sure that certain issues types (for example the Impediments) are always on the top row.\n\nUsually we try then to base the swimming lanes on a JQL query. This works in a sense that we can choose to put the Impediments on the top (for example). However, the user stories and their subtasks end then up in one swimming lane, which can be a bit messy (some teams have many subtasks).\n\nSo what I am looking for is being able to combine the best of both worlds: base the swimming lanes on JQL queries AND within those swimming lanes group the user stories with their subtasks (for example by having small swimming lanes withing the JQL-swimming lanes). I think that this would be a great addition for many teams.\n\nWould you please consider this?\n\nThanks,\nJasper",
