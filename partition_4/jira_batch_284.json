      "description": "During each sprint we have both stories that are estimated with points and timebox activities.  The pointed stories do not have a limit as to the number of hours we can put towards finishing that story, however, the timebox stories have a cap for the number of hours we spend on it.  For now, we create an issue and give it an original estimate, which is the maximum number of hours we are willing to spend on that issue, and then add subtasks to document the specifics of what we worked on.  The problem comes when we try to account for our time spent on each subtask.  If we add timespent to the sub task, Greenhopper adds that to the original estimate and we essentially burnup instead of down.  So we have developers add their time spent to the parent issue and keep the subtask at zero time.  This works as far as burning down but it does not allow us to track the time spent in each sub task, or who spent the time since we have many developers contributing to the time spent on the parent task.  It would be nice if an issue could be marked as a timebox activity with an original estimate to the time and as time is spent on subtasks it gets burned down from the parent taks instead of acumulating the total allotted time.",

      "description": "After having used this version of the GreenHopper plugin with JIRA Professional 3.13.5 for some time (evaluation license), I purchased and installed the new licenses a couple of days ago.  Both JIRA and GreenHopper behaved properly after that.\r\n\r\nToday I tried to import issues into JIRA from our existing Mantis system.  Since I had previously removed the Improvement issue type, I hit issue JIRA-8949.  Based on the notes in that issue I created an Improvement type and then manually updated the issuetype.ID database field to 4 and then 2 so that the import would succeed.  After doing this and restarting JIRA the imports worked and everything appeared normal in JIRA.\r\n\r\nExcept this on the Home screen which shows the GreenHopper portlet for one of the projects:\r\n\r\nAn error occurred whilst rendering this message. Please contact the administrators, and inform them of this bug. Details: ------- org.apache.velocity.exception.MethodInvocationException: Invocation of method 'getSelectableChartTypes' in class com.pyxis.greenhopper.jira.configurations.UserBoardsPreferences threw exception class java.lang.NullPointerException : null at org.apache.velocity.runtime.parser.node.ASTIdentifier.execute(ASTIdentifier.java:193) at org.apache.velocity.runtime.parser.node.ASTReference.execute(ASTReference.java:175) at org.apache.velocity.runtime.parser.node.ASTReference.value(ASTReference.java:327) at org.apache.velocity.runtime.directive.Foreach.render(Foreach.java:131) at org.apache.velocity.runtime.parser.node.ASTDirective.render(ASTDirective.java:114) at org.apache.velocity.runtime.parser.node.ASTBlock.render(ASTBlock.java:55) at org.apache.velocity.runtime.parser.node.ASTIfStatement.render(ASTIfStatement.java:70) at org.apache.velocity.runtime.parser.node.ASTBlock.render(ASTBlock.java:55) at org.apache.velocity.runtime.parser.node.ASTIfStatement.render(ASTIfStatement.java:70) at org.apache.velocity.runtime.parser.node.ASTBlock.render(ASTBlock.java:55) at org.apache.velocity.runtime.parser.node.SimpleNode.render(SimpleNode.java:230) at org.apache.velocity.runtime.parser.node.ASTIfStatement.render(ASTIfStatement.java:89) at org.apache.velocity.runtime.parser.node.SimpleNode.render(SimpleNode.java:230) at org.apache.velocity.Template.merge(Template.java:256) at org.apache.velocity.app.VelocityEngine.mergeTemplate(VelocityEngine.java:450) at com.atlassian.velocity.DefaultVelocityManager.getEncodedBody(DefaultVelocityManager.java:77) at com.atlassian.jira.plugin.webwork.JiraPluginWebworkVelocityServlet.service(JiraPluginWebworkVelocityServlet.java:46) at\r\n...\r\n\r\nThis project was one I had been using with GreenHopper all along successfully, both before and after the new license.  Using the top-level GreenHopper menu item gives the same exception only in a less readable form.\r\n\r\nPresumably there is some sort of database integrity issue, but I ran the JIRA integrity checker which found no problems.\r\n\r\nSince GreenHopper is totally non-functional for us at this time I would appreciate some quick attention to this problem!\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nSean",

That should remain but the style of the chart can be changed slightly to replicate JIRA.\r\n\r\nThank You.",

However, the JOB will actually be doing nothing.\r\n\r\nThe overall result, your job is not going to being registered. If this is the case then you will have to do some extra checks in your registration code. I guess you can check that the job is registered and has the right class. For example, \r\n\r\n{code}\r\n   job = ManagerFactory.getScheduler().getJobDetail(....) \r\n   if (job != null && job.getGetJobClass() != GreenHopperRankingJob.class)\r\n   {\r\n       <unregister the current job>\r\n       job = null;\r\n     }\r\n   if (job = null)\r\n   {\r\n       <register the current job>\r\n   }\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nIt may be worth while to look if the job is non-volatile and always remove it to clean up the database.",
