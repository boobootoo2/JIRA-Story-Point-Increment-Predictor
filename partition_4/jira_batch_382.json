It can use this to give a proper prediction when the version is done, using the specified team capacity for the future, \n\nIf this functionality would be present, I could also use it to report the teams progress to the customer who only cares about the release date.\nI now manually make a report in excell, which takes time and is annoying.\n\nSituation: The customer wants a new version of the software in 21 weeks (approximately 5 months). So I created a version and assigned issues to it.\nWhen starting development of the new version, a big part of the team was on holiday, making the initial prediction way to pessimistic.

I thought (hoped) that \"Base swimlanes on\" - Stories would created a swimlane for each story (it does) and in this show every issue connected to that story (except epics) (it doesn't).\n\nI qwant to arrange swimlanes by story I can see at any time the state of every issue connected to a story.\nThis enables me to easily see exactly what work is left to do to complete each story, and therefore what are we likely/actually going to deliver this sprint.\n\nThis helps management to maintain stakeholder expectations.\n\nFor example:\n\nI have multiple stories in a sprint. Each story contains acceptance criteria & enough info for devs to do work. Some additional dev/qa tasks may be created and linked to the story (we don't use sub-tasks historically) with link type 'related to', or maybe even 'blocks')\n\nBugs for each story will be created during the sprint. These will be linked to the story (with link types being 'found while testing', or possibly, 'blocks').\n\nI want the bugs, tasks, sub-tasks etc. related to a story to be visible in the swimlane for that story.\n\nThe ability to do this in a lightweight manner important. Having to manually set up and maintain a bunch of JQL queries (one per story) in order to get this view is laborious if we have 15 stories every sprint, and prone to error since it's a tedious manual task.\n\nI was very happy to see Story apear in the Group By list, but disappointed that it seems to only recognise the story itself and sub-tasks as belonging to a story (and only if the story actually has sub-tasks - which ours don't). Everything else gets booted out into the big generic pile of everything else.\n\nCurrently we have to set up a query like this for each story:\n\nissuekey= StoryID1234 or ISSUE IN linkedIssues(\"StoryID1234\")\n\nIt would make life easier if the setting \"Base swimlanes on\" - Stories actually enabled this automagically.",

However, those were each fairly specific requests, so I wanted to create an issue that might cover both of those and more.\n\nSo, in addition to the desires stated under those other two issues, I would like to be able to constrain the version report to a filter in order to review \"what if\" scenarios. For example, if the release date of a version is looking to be in jeopardy, I would like to be able to quickly see what the graph would look like if we only included the remaining items of a particular priority and higher.  However, I think this additional filter would still need to be scoped to 1 or more versions, and need to only exclude work that remains in an open state.  Since I imagine the historical values of work completed would still need to include all items associated with the versions in order to have an accurate measure of velocity.  So, the UI design for this definitely isn't immediately obvious to me, unless it was a multi-select for the version list and the choice of \"Quick Filters\" that only applied to Open remaining work items.\n\nI guess in the mean time I can temporarily move stories between versions to play with \"what if's\", but that feels messy.",

      "description": "After moving an issue on the board the board is refreshed by calling {{xboard/work/allData.json}}. On our production instance this takes 6 seconds. Updating the issue is relatively quick, refreshing the board data is not.\n\nThis is down to {{com.atlassian.greenhopper.service.lucene.ChangeHistorySearchHelper#findChangeLogFilter}}. Specifically, computing the cross-references from two queries, one of which may contain up to half a million issues, is very slow. I'm sure there is a quicker way, even if it's just checking the permission for each issue retrieved from the change history index.\n\nAs a workaround I am just disabling loading the days in column data in {{com.atlassian.greenhopper.web.rapid.list.RapidIssueEntryQueryServiceImpl#collectWorkModeIssues}}, which makes things passably fast.\n\nh3. Areas of JIRA Agile Affected\n\n* Generating JIRA Agile charts - notably Burndown, Cumulative Flow Diagram & Control Chart.\n* Loading days in column for a list of issues (workaround to disable this in GHS-10520).\n\nh3. Workaround for Work Sub-Filter\n\nThis is fixed in JIRA 6.3.1 as tracked in JRA-38883, so this workaround will only apply for previous versions of JIRA.\n\nIt's possible that on larger instances the default work sub-filter may be causing performance issues of its own. This is not related to {{com.atlassian.greenhopper.service.lucene.ChangeHistorySearchHelper}} however does present with similar symptoms. Specifically, the [work sub-filter|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/AGILE/Configuring+Filters#ConfiguringFilters-AddingaSub-FilterforWorkmode] default is:\n\n{noformat}\nfixVersion in unreleasedVersions() OR fixVersion is EMPTY\n{noformat}\n\nThis {{unreleasedVersions()}} JQL may be slow for larger instances that process a large number of projects, as it goes through all of them to find out which versions are relevant. This can be sped up by specifying a list of projects _that are only relevant to the JIRA Agile board being used_. For example if we wanted to only return issues for projects GHS and JRA (because they are in the board filter), we would use the following:\n\n{noformat}\nfixVersion in unreleasedVersions(GHS,JRA) OR fixVersion is EMPTY\n{noformat}\n\nPlease make the above changes and verify if the boards are faster to render or not. If they are faster, it implies the {{unreleasedVersions()}} was slow to process due to the large number of projects. If it does not it would indicate that the {{com.atlassian.greenhopper.service.lucene.ChangeHistorySearchHelper}} is the cause of slowness.\n\nIt's possible that both {{unreleasedVersions()}} and {{com.atlassian.greenhopper.service.lucene.ChangeHistorySearchHelper}} are slow to process and this workaround only addresses one part of the problem.\n\nh3.

      "description": "I find that one of the most useful tools for our software development team is the Version Report chart.  Since the addition of this one chart, we're able to much more accurately forecast the completion of a release and extremely accurately communicate the effect of scope creep on our completion date.  We have been able to determine when it's necessary to add resources to a project and communicate to upper management exactly why they need to make a priority decision on all open projects due to release schedules.\n\nHowever, in order to do this, we currently create our own trend lines with a sheet of paper held up to the monitor or projector.  I've attached a screenshot that explains why this is necessary.\n\nFirst off, being able to annotate this graph as I've done in this screenshot would prove invaluable for project status reports as well as \"lessons learned\" post-project analysis.  I'm thinking GreenHopper stores as many points on the graph as is requested as well as an annotation for each.  These points are stored per version tracked in GreenHopper.\n\nI feel like the \"project start\" date should show the entire progression (graph) of a project.  However, there needs to be an option for a progression line start date separate from the project start date, as the June re-specification and reallocation of developers to the project requires a new velocity trend line.  I already did this in March, and have been considering doing it again, but if I do this, the new graph loses the historical nature as annotated in the screenshot.\n\nAnother cool idea is a \"scope creep trend line\".  I just noticed today that even back all the way until early mid-april, our scope creep has been extremely linear.  This, combined with current (recent) velocity could possibly create a \"true\" completion date where the two lines I drew intersect?\n\nOne thing I didn't show on the graph was the ability to speculate on an increased velocity over your current velocity.  This could have been used after the spec redesign in late June and the addition of more developers to the project.  I'm thinking a box on the right that says \"Speculate an additional X story points per week\".  This would cause the velocity trend line slope to increase starting today, causing an upward kink in the velocity trend line with an adjusted final completion date.\n\nI know this is a huge request, but I feel like this adds a significant amount of benefit to an already great feature.  These new features will hugely help us when communicating outside our group and committing to release dates.",
