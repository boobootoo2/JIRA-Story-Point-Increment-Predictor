Then do reporting by the release.\n\n-Label initiatives with a prefix (like Q1-Go to Moon) and then filter by that prefix.  \n\nBoth of these are really approximate as releases or initiatives bleed into Q2 from Q1.\n\nOr is there another way to do this?",

We could have more than 1 team on a product or share teams across products. We're currently using Team to represent Product for a product roadmap, but would love to use team as the actual scrum teams to take advantage of the capacity planning elements.\n* We also have a need to show roadmaps by Delivery Mechanism as we have goals of investing in some more than others.\n\nI'm sure as we use this, we'll think of more uses. The ultimate would be to allow us to customize which fields to group on and allow multiple Epic views to exist simultaneously with different groupings.\n\nThanks!\n\n[~aentler]",

Our process working with Epics and Stories via Portfolio goes as follows.\n\n1. Epics are defined in JIRA\n2. Epics are imported into Portfolio\n3. Epic estimates are entered into Portfolio representing the best guess per team to allow long-term planning.\n4. As each Epic is further defined and gets closer to the top of the plan, the teams created their stories (in JIRA) under the Epic\n5. The teams then estimate and allocate story points to the stories (in JIRA)\n6. Once all teams have created and pointed all stories for the Epic, they are imported into Portfolio, replacing all Epic estimates with the total of the story points.\n\nWe have discovered a problem between steps 4,5 and 6 above.  If we ask the teams to create stories and before step 6 is complete and Update plan is run, Portfolio will try to replace the Epic estimate with 0, which I presume is the total of all stories.\n\nFor example:\n*Epic impacts App and Server teams\n*Epic estimates are App(20), Server (30)\n*Server team add 3 stories under the Epic (no points)\n* Update plan is run and all Epic estimates are replaced with 0\n\nIs this expected behaviour (and therefore a problem with our process) or a bug?\n",

This issue is being addressed as part of the all new Portfolio live plans, which feature an entirely overhauled and more seamless integration model with JIRA Software / Agile. Live plans are currently available as a labs feature for both Server* and Cloud, so you can start evaluating them without any risk of impacting existing Portfolio plans. They are not yet feature-complete, we're working on bringing all major capabilities of standard plans back into live plans on top of the new integration model before we graduate live plans out of labs and make them the new standard way of working. \nPlease check out this blog for a summary and short videos of how the top-voted suggestions are being addressed with live plans: [Top 10 suggestions addressed in live plans|http://blogs.atlassian.com/2016/03/10-user-suggestions-addressed-in-portfolio-for-jira/] and join our [Portfolio Pioneers LinkedIn group|https://www.linkedin.com/groups/7018171] to discuss feedback and best practices!\n \nThanks,\nMartin Suntinger\n[msuntinger@atlassian.com|mailto:msuntinger@atlassian.com]\nPrincipal Product Manager, Portfolio for JIRA\n \n^*The live plans labs feature is available with Portfolio for JIRA 1.12 or higher. It is compatible with JIRA Software 7.0.5 or higher, and JIRA 6.3 or higher, in association with JIRA Agile 6.7.12 or higher.^\n{panel}\n\ni see we can now import releases from jira as of version 1.8.  however, if i can the start/end date in jira after a release is imported, the change is not reflected in jira portfolio",

This issue is being addressed as part of the all new Portfolio live plans, which feature an entirely overhauled and more seamless integration model with JIRA Software / Agile. Live plans are currently available as a labs feature for both Server* and Cloud, so you can start evaluating them without any risk of impacting existing Portfolio plans. They are not yet feature-complete, we're working on bringing all major capabilities of standard plans back into live plans on top of the new integration model before we graduate live plans out of labs and make them the new standard way of working. \nPlease check out this blog for a summary and short videos of how the top-voted suggestions are being addressed with live plans: [Top 10 suggestions addressed in live plans|http://blogs.atlassian.com/2016/03/10-user-suggestions-addressed-in-portfolio-for-jira/] and join our [Portfolio Pioneers LinkedIn group|https://www.linkedin.com/groups/7018171] to discuss feedback and best practices!\n \nThanks,\nMartin Suntinger\n[msuntinger@atlassian.com|mailto:msuntinger@atlassian.com]\nPrincipal Product Manager, Portfolio for JIRA\n \n^*The live plans labs feature is available with Portfolio for JIRA 1.12 or higher. It is compatible with JIRA Software 7.0.5 or higher, and JIRA 6.3 or higher, in association with JIRA Agile 6.7.12 or higher.^\n{panel}\n\nSub-tasks should be supported in Portfolio and should also be displayed in the backlog table as child elements of stories. This would allow for a better JIRA integration. At the moment, Portfolio does not really have a notion of sub-tasks, their estimates are considered in the 'Update from date...' estimate suggestions, but they are not respected when syncing estimates back to JIRA, which then potentially adds the sub-tasks estimates to the parent story.\n\nThus, it is desirable to manage sub-tasks of stories in the same way as stories are treated within epics.",

This issue is being addressed as part of the all new Portfolio live plans, which feature an entirely overhauled and more seamless integration model with JIRA Software / Agile. Live plans are currently available as a labs feature for both Server* and Cloud, so you can start evaluating them without any risk of impacting existing Portfolio plans. They are not yet feature-complete, we're working on bringing all major capabilities of standard plans back into live plans on top of the new integration model before we graduate live plans out of labs and make them the new standard way of working. \nPlease check out this blog for a summary and short videos of how the top-voted suggestions are being addressed with live plans: [Top 10 suggestions addressed in live plans|http://blogs.atlassian.com/2016/03/10-user-suggestions-addressed-in-portfolio-for-jira/] and join our [Portfolio Pioneers LinkedIn group|https://www.linkedin.com/groups/7018171] to discuss feedback and best practices!\n \nThanks,\nMartin Suntinger\n[msuntinger@atlassian.com|mailto:msuntinger@atlassian.com]\nPrincipal Product Manager, Portfolio for JIRA\n \n^*The live plans labs feature is available with Portfolio for JIRA 1.12 or higher. It is compatible with JIRA Software 7.0.5 or higher, and JIRA 6.3 or higher, in association with JIRA Agile 6.7.12 or higher.^\n{panel}\n\nCurrently there are quite a number of customer requesting integration between JIRA Portfolio and JIRA Agile.\n\nFor example, version created in JIRA Agile can be synchronise to JIRA Portfolio so that they won't need to create again.

This issue is being addressed as part of the all new Portfolio live plans, which feature an entirely overhauled and more seamless integration model with JIRA Software / Agile. Live plans are currently available as a labs feature for both Server* and Cloud, so you can start evaluating them without any risk of impacting existing Portfolio plans. They are not yet feature-complete, we're working on bringing all major capabilities of standard plans back into live plans on top of the new integration model before we graduate live plans out of labs and make them the new standard way of working. \nPlease check out this blog for a summary and short videos of how the top-voted suggestions are being addressed with live plans: [Top 10 suggestions addressed in live plans|http://blogs.atlassian.com/2016/03/10-user-suggestions-addressed-in-portfolio-for-jira/] and join our [Portfolio Pioneers LinkedIn group|https://www.linkedin.com/groups/7018171] to discuss feedback and best practices!\n \nThanks,\nMartin Suntinger\n[msuntinger@atlassian.com|mailto:msuntinger@atlassian.com]\nPrincipal Product Manager, Portfolio for JIRA\n \n^*The live plans labs feature is available with Portfolio for JIRA 1.12 or higher. It is compatible with JIRA Software 7.0.5 or higher, and JIRA 6.3 or higher, in association with JIRA Agile 6.7.12 or higher.^\n{panel}\n\nWhen I import issues in Jira Portfolio, I would like to import assignees that already exist on Jira tasks and user stories. \n\nSome fields are already filled when we \"Import issues\" : Parent epics and releases. It would be great to also have the assignee filled because very often, when we create tasks in Jira, we already know who will have to work on each task (but we don't know when). And the problem is that when you import dozens of tasks in Portfolio, that were already assigned in Jira, you have to reassign (to force the assignment) all these tasks manually in Portfolio (and so you have to make the assignment job twice).\n\nSo, the \"import issues\" panel could allow to have more columns such as \"Assignee\" and why not \"Sprint\" (because sometimes, when importing a task in Portfolio, we already know in which sprint we want to affect this task).\n\nThank you.",

(I still believe that it should not be necessary for the user to manually enter an appropriate start date to get around this system error.)\n\nI have noticed that since upgrading to Portfolio 1.9.4, when I enter an earliest start date, the dynamic release start date typically returns a date the same as the earliest start date - there seems to be little or no correlation between the calculated release start date and the number of epics (with corresponding time estimates) prioritised higher than the epic in question.\n\nDoes the prioritisation of epics actually do anything?\n\nPlease help!",
