That means, for any custom revision, the specs from the last \"Specs configuration update\" build is used.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n # Push new changes followed by another to YAML specs repository. This creates 2 new builds with 2 \"Specs configuration updated\"\r\n # Now, hit \"Run -> Run customised...\" and give\u00a0Revision number of the first revision.\r\n # The custom build will be executed, however, the Specs configuration update will still use the latest one.\u00a0\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nWhen a customized build is run with a custom revision (using *Run customised... option*), Bamboo should use the specs from exactly that revision, as the YAML specs definition content might differ.\r\n\r\nIn other words, when we\u00a0run a customized build and the repository is checked out at a specific revision, the expected behavior should be that if there is a specs file, it's current contents (from that revision) should be parsed and executed, and not the last \"saved state\".\r\nh3. Workaround (Optional)\u00a0\r\n\r\nThere is no workaround for now.",

      "description": "h3. Summary\r\n\r\nBamboo gets extremely slow after updating a task on a plan with multiple branches (e.g. hundreds or even thousands of branches). The more branches you add to your plan, the more time it takes to load pages that need to access plan cache information, because Bamboo invalidates the plan cache when editing a task.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Create two plans inside Bamboo.\r\n# Create a Script task inside the job from each plan with a simple *echo*.\r\n{noformat}\r\necho \"Hello world!\"\r\n{noformat}\r\n# Create a few plan branches inside the first plan.\r\n# Create ~1000 plan branches inside the second plan.\r\n# Open two different tabs in your browser and access the job configuration page for both plans.\r\n#* Inside the second plan open up the Script task and save it -- it's not even necessary to perform changes, just save the task.\r\n#* After that click something else, try to access another task if you have one or click the Job details or even Requirements tab.\r\n# Now back to the tab with the first plan open, click around as well (e.g. Job details tab, Requirements tab, Artifacts tab, and etc).\r\n# Open a third tab and access the Bamboo *Build Dashboard* page.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n* You are able to navigate and access all the information across all tabs with no problems and more importantly, with no delays.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n* Inside the tab with the first plan open you can actually navigate with no problems. It's a rather small plan with only a handful of branches. Furthermore since you're inside the plan, it is not necessary to load/access the cache from other plans.\r\n* For the tab with the second plan nothing happens, Bamboo just hangs and waits until it finishes updating the task you saved and rebuild the plan cache. Inside a plan with ~1000 plan branches this can take up to 5 minutes of waiting.\r\n* All other pages that attempt to access that plan cache information (e.g. Build Dashboard, Build activity, and etc) will also hang and it turn all other users have to wait until Bamboo is done updating the cache information because one user updated a task. This is a *huge* problem because one user, editing a single task, can halt Bamboo and prevent other users from accessing the application.\r\n** None of the administrative pages are affected because we're not accessing plan cache information there, so one would not even notice the problem while going through the Agents page, Server capabilities or even the Users and Groups page. None of the admin pages demonstrate slowness.\r\n\r\nh3.Workaround\r\n* Reduce the number of plan branches across all your plans to less than 100 plan branches or even less than that, if possible.\r\n* Use Specs to update the plan configuration as opposed to the UI. Split the plan into many plans, each having only a subset of (somehow logically-divided) plan branches. This way Specs would become beneficial and a good replacement for the UI in a few ways:\r\n** Even without limiting number of plan branches, updating of tasks will happen in the background, so users won't have to wait for each operation to finish to proceed.\r\n** It will make it easier to limit number of plan branches, because it will be easier to create multiple plans sharing similar logic (same code in Specs, just different key and name for each plan, mainly to ensure consistency), and each one of the plans could have just a small number of plan branches, not all of them at once.",

      "description": "h3. Summary\r\n\r\nBamboo reports some groups coming from Microsoft Active Directory with 0 user count when in fact they have a considerable amount of users (members).\r\n\r\n!viewGroups.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nIn this case both *BAMBOO* groups are coming from Microsoft Active Directory. The first one (BAMBOO-ENGR) has 15 users, but the second one (BAMBOO-USERS) has +1.500 users. The second group is showing up with 0 users inside Bamboo.\r\n\r\nh3. Environment\r\n* Bamboo connect to Microsoft Active Directory.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Connect Bamboo to Microsoft Active Directory using the following document: [Integrating Bamboo with LDAP|https://confluence.atlassian.com/bamboo/integrating-bamboo-with-ldap-289277210.html].\r\n# Create two groups inside AD:\r\n#* BAMBOO-USERS\r\nAdd more than 1.500 users to this group.\r\n#* BAMBOO-ENGR\r\nAdd just a few users to this group (e.g. 15 users).\r\n# To ensure that you're only loading users from those two groups we just created and that you're also just synchronizing those groups, configure Bamboo to:\r\n#* look for those groups inside your AD tree:\r\n{noformat}\r\n<groupSearchFilter>(&amp;(objectCategory=group)(|(cn=BAMBOO-ENGR)(cn=BAMBOO-USERS)))</groupSearchFilter>\r\n{noformat}\r\n#* filter users that only belong to those groups:\r\n{noformat}\r\n<userSearchFilter>(&amp;(objectCategory=Person)(sAMAccountName=*)(|(memberOf=CN=BAMBOO-ENGR,OU=bamboo,DC=atlassian,DC=local)(memberOf=CN=BAMBOO-USERS,OU=bamboo,DC=atlassian,DC=local)))</userSearchFilter>\r\n{noformat}\r\n#* use member as the membership attribute:\r\n{noformat}\r\n<membershipAttribute>member</membershipAttribute>\r\n{noformat}\r\n# Once everything has been configured correctly access the following pages inside Bamboo:\r\n#* Bamboo administration > Overview > Security > Users\r\n#* Bamboo administration > Overview > Security > Groups\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nThe first page, the *Users* page, will give you a list of all users and groups they belong to -- either BAMBOO-ENGR, BAMBOO-USERS or both. The second page, the *Groups* page, should report the correct number of users belonging to those two groups we created (e.g. BAMBOO-USERS with over 1.500 users and BAMBOO-ENGR with 15 users).\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nThe first page will give you all correct results but the *Groups* page on the other hand will display the user count as 0 for the BAMBOO-USERS group.\r\n\r\n!viewGroups.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nThis is happening because when we query Microsoft AD for the list of members inside that group we expect a list of users that has the following structure:\r\n\r\n{noformat:title=BAMBOO-ENGR}\r\n# BAMBOO-ENGR, bamboo, atlassian.local\r\ndn: CN=BAMBOO-ENGR,OU=bamboo,DC=atlassian,DC=local\r\nmember: CN=bamboo.user0014,OU=users,OU=howTo,DC=atlassian,DC=local\r\nmember: CN=bamboo.user0013,OU=users,OU=howTo,DC=atlassian,DC=local\r\nmember: CN=bamboo.user0012,OU=users,OU=howTo,DC=atlassian,DC=local\r\nmember: CN=bamboo.user0011,OU=users,OU=howTo,DC=atlassian,DC=local\r\nmember: CN=bamboo.user0010,OU=users,OU=howTo,DC=atlassian,DC=local\r\n...\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nHowever, the results from querying the other group looks like this:\r\n\r\n{noformat:title=BAMBOO-USERS}\r\n# BAMBOO-USERS, bamboo, atlassian.local\r\ndn: CN=BAMBOO-USERS,OU=bamboo,DC=atlassian,DC=local\r\nmember;range=0-1499: CN=bamboo.user1413,OU=users,OU=howTo,DC=atlassian,DC=local\r\nmember;range=0-1499: CN=bamboo.user1412,OU=users,OU=howTo,DC=atlassian,DC=local\r\nmember;range=0-1499: CN=bamboo.user1411,OU=users,OU=howTo,DC=atlassian,DC=local\r\nmember;range=0-1499: CN=bamboo.user1410,OU=users,OU=howTo,DC=atlassian,DC=local\r\nmember;range=0-1499: CN=bamboo.user1409,OU=users,OU=howTo,DC=atlassian,DC=local\r\n...\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nAll the results from the BAMBOO-USERS group have *member;range=0-1499:* \u2013 according to [Microsoft|https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/Aa367017], by default, only the first 1.500 members of a group are accessible through LDAP via an attribute called *member;range=0-1499* even if the group contains more than 1.500 members.\r\n\r\nBamboo is not able to parse/handle that range parameter and it's reporting that the group has 0 users.\r\n\r\nh3. Notes\r\n\r\nYou can test and check this using a very useful command called {{ldapsearch}}. If you want to know whether you're affected by this issue you can use your *atlassian-user.xml* file information to run the following command and look for the *range* attribute in the results:\r\n\r\n{code}\r\nldapsearch -D \"<securityPrincipal>\" \\\r\n           -w \"<securityCredential>\" \\\r\n           -p <port> \\\r\n           -h <host> \\\r\n           -b \"<baseContext>\" \\\r\n           \"<groupSearchFilter>\" \\\r\n           member\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nYou will find each one of the tags mentioned above inside your *atlassian-user.xml* file -- just replace the tags with the actual values so it looks similar to this:\r\n\r\n{code}\r\nldapsearch -D \"CN=administrator,CN=users,DC=atlassian,DC=local\" \\\r\n           -w \"password123\" \\\r\n           -p 389 \\\r\n           -h atlassian.local \\\r\n           -b \"DC=atlassian,DC=local\" \\\r\n           \"(&(objectCategory=group)(|(cn=BAMBOO-ENGR)(cn=BAMBOO-USERS)))\" \\\r\n           member\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nh3.Workaround\r\n\r\nThere are no known workarounds at this time. However please keep in mind that this shouldn't affect users ability to access the application or even admins to grant and manage user access and such. This only affects the user count inside the *Groups* page.",

This is most common to large Bamboo instances with hundreds of thousands of build results, and the impact is amplified if you're *not* using _Complete build & deployment results, build & release artifacts and all logs_. This means that only artifacts and logs are getting removed, but all of your builds still exist in the database, and since Bamboo runs quite a few (rather complex) SQL queries to find what results must be removed, the more results you have, the more time Bamboo will take to execute the SQL queries in the background.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nPlease consider using the _Complete build & deployment results, build & release artifacts and all logs_ option inside the *Expiry* configuration to completely remove builds & deployments from the database as well and not only artifact and logs -- which are mostly used to free up disk space.",
