Summary\r\nTrying to retrieve issues reported by a a +customer+ user using Jira Servicedesk\u00a0 REST api.\r\n It looks like its not possible to retrieve all issues using the REST api.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Find a customer user that has reported thousands of issues using customer portal\r\n# Run the REST call like this : {{<baseURL>/rest/servicedeskapi/request?start=0&limit=100}} {{<baseURL>/rest/servicedeskapi/request?start=0&limit=100}} {{<baseURL>/rest/servicedeskapi/request?start=100&limit=100}} {{<baseURL>/rest/servicedeskapi/request?start=200&limit=100}} {{<baseURL>/rest/servicedeskapi/request?start=300&limit=100}}\r\n# but the api is only returning few hundred issues, not all of them even when there are thousands of issues reported by the customer.\r\n\r\nh3. Notes\r\nSince the REST api has another known bug : https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSDSERVER-4187, as a workaround tried to run the REST call like this :\r\n# {{<baseURL>/rest/servicedeskapi/request?start=0&limit=100}} {{<baseURL>/rest/servicedeskapi/request?start=0&limit=100}} {{<baseURL>/rest/servicedeskapi/request?start=50&limit=100}} {{<baseURL>/rest/servicedeskapi/request?start=100&limit=100}} {{<baseURL>/rest/servicedeskapi/request?start=150&limit=100}}\r\n\r\nh3.

More agents result in more users being searched, causing a longer delay.\r\n * The check for application access retrieves group membership for the user, including nested group membership.\r\n ** The search of nested groups can cause the search to take longer than it would otherwise.\r\n\r\n*Steps to reproduce:*\r\n * Create JIRA Service Desk instance with 1000s of agents who are members of multiple nested groups\r\n * Attempt to load customers page\r\n ** Observe delay\r\n ** Compare with JSD 3.2 which did not perform this agent search when loading customer page.\r\n\r\nExample

Jira Service Management notifications are currently not respecting the [global Jira setting for \u2018email from\u2019|https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiraserver/configuring-jira-application-options-938847824.html#ConfiguringJiraapplicationoptions-settingsGeneralsettings].\r\n\r\nWe understand that this issue can cause confusion for your customers and it is an issue we would like to resolve. Thank you for your votes and comments on this ticket, it has surfaced it for our attention.\r\n\r\nThe related public bug ticket ([JSDSERVER-3597|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSDSERVER-3597]) will be reopened and triaged accordingly - please follow progress on that ticket.\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\n\r\nCharlie\r\n\r\nJira Service Management, Server & Data Center{panel}\r\n\r\nh3. Problem Definition\r\n\r\nCurrently, Jira service desk portal notification is using a different notification header that uses in Jira notification.\r\nh4. *Jira Service Desk Portal notification*\r\n\r\n!service desk notification email.jpg|thumbnail!\r\nh4. *Jira notification*\r\n!jira notification email.png|thumbnail!\u00a0\r\n\r\nJira notification email is using an *Email from* settings from Jira General configuration:\r\n !screenshot-1.png|thumbnail!\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nIt will be better if service desk notification will follow the same template settings while sending email notification.",

Problem definition\r\n\r\nSome customers want to integrate Service Desk with a Confluence knowledge base, and with the following configuration:\r\n - The Confluence Server is only reachable from an internal network\r\n - The Service Desk Server is publicly reachable from the internet\r\n\r\nWith such configuration:\r\n - if Service Desk is accessed from the internal network, KBs can be searched and their content can also be opened from Service Desk.\r\n - however, if Service Desk is accessed from outside the internal network, KBs can be searched but their content can't be loaded within Service Desk.\r\n\r\nThe reason why the KB search works fine in Service Desk regardless of where the customer is accessing Service Desk from is because, in case of the search results, JIRA prefetches the results of the query via API call made to a Confluence endpoint (server side). The browser just retrieves the results from JIRA not directly from confluence as with the Confluence page view.\r\n\r\nHowever, for the loading of the KB page, what happens is that JIRA doesn't fetch the page's content by API, it actually just loads the Confluence page by an HTML <iframe>. So in this scenario it's the location of the browser that matters and not the location of JIRA.\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nUse the API to pre-fetch the Confluence KB articles, rather than embed the actual confluence web doc/page directly in an iframe on the client side.\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nFor now the only workaround that we can suggest is to make the Confluence server publicly open to the internet, or if there is any confidential information, create 2 Confluence instances:\r\n - one instance that is used internally and that is only reachable from the internal network\r\n - one instance which is reachable from the internet, used to serve KBs in Service Desk",

Summary\r\nWhen searching for uses in the *Invite team* dialog, it is possible to cause high memory pressure inside the JVM, which can lead to outages and an {{OutOfMemoryError}}. This should only happen when there's a large number (10K+) of agents.\r\n\r\nh3. Environment\r\n* Jira Service Desk 3.9.6\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Create a large amount of users, for example, 10000 or more.\r\n# Create a Service Desk project.\r\n# Add all users to the project role *Service Desk Team*.\r\n# Click on *Invite team* and type several characters. For example, type 'user' then delete all characters, then type 'user' again. Repeat this operation a few times.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nJira does not allocate a large amount of memory and there are no performance issues.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nA large amount of memory, possibly related to user caches, is loaded in the heap (see JRASERVER-67502). Every keystroke makes an HTTP request, so there will be multiple HTTP threads allocating a large amount of memory. This can turn the instance unresponsive due to repeated full GC operations and can eventually lead to an {{OutOfMemoryError}}.\r\n\r\nh3.Workaround\r\nDisable the module responsible by the *Invite team* functionality, following these steps:\r\n# Go to *Administration > Add-ons > Manage add-ons*;\r\n# Select *All add-ons* on the right of the filter box just above the list of add-ons;\r\n# Type in \"service desk project\" in the filter;\r\n# Expand the view of the only plugin that should be displayed under the \"Application Components\" section, named *JIRA Service Desk Project Plugin*;\r\n# Click to expand its list of modules where it says \"75 of 75 modules enabled\";\r\n# Disable the following module:\r\n#* Invite team (sd-project-sidebar-invite-team)\r\n\r\nAdding agents is still possible by manually adding them to the *Service Desk Team* role under *Project settings > Users and roles*.",

      "description": "h3. Problem Definition\r\n\r\nIn Jira Service Desk Server 3.4.1 an SLA Audit Log was introduced for troubleshooting SLAs. This audit log can grow to huge sizes in the database, so a cleanup job was introduced(https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSDSERVER-5266). This cleanup job helps to keep the size of the database tables smaller, but can still allow the audit log to grow to large sizes and the job itself can become very resource intensive and long running. This leads to a performance impact due to the SQL query used and a stability impact because the query can become long running(over 30 hours has been seen) and can block other database calls.\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nProvide a dark feature, or other configurable parameter, to completely disable the SLA Audit Log.\r\nh3. Why this is important\r\n\r\nThe tradeoff between the benefits of the SLA Audit Log and the impact it can create is something that may vary from instance to instance and should be configurable to best fit the use case for that instance.\r\n This is important because admins should be given the choice of whether to use the audit log feature or not.\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n The closest thing to a workaround is to set a configuration setting in the database to reduce the number of days before an audit event is cleaned up. The default is 30 days and this can allow the tables to get too large, slowing down the cleanup job. If we reduce this to 1 day the tables will be kept much smaller and because they are smaller the cleanup job is able to complete much more quickly.\r\n\r\nThe database property is:\r\n sd.sla.audit.log.cleanup.days\r\n\r\nRun the SQL query to determine the ID of the property in the database:\r\n{code:java}\r\nSELECT * FROM propertyentry JOIN propertynumber ON propertyentry.ID=propertynumber.ID WHERE PROPERTY_KEY = \"sd.sla.audit.log.cleanup.days\";\r\n{code}\r\nThen to modify this parameter from 30 to 1:\r\n{code:java}\r\nUPDATE propertynumber SET propertyvalue=1 WHERE ID = <ID from above>;\r\n{code}\r\nRelated tickets:\r\n https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSDSERVER-5266\r\n https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSDSERVER-5719",

However, if you update the priority of the issue to P0 = 1hour SLA, nothing will happen to the SLA.\r\n\r\nI believe it is indeed very needed to enhance the start triggers to allow for condition 'Priority' changes and the appropriate follow-up options to update the SLA.\r\n\r\n\u00a0",
