      "description": "Hi, first of, we love SourceTree! We're a small team of six and it's become a can't function without tool. Thank you for all your hard work.\r\n\r\nWe really like seeing the git commands and responses during push/pull/commit etc (via 'Always display full console output'). Although some git operations we care less about and are not always interested in the console output. The idea is instead of interacting with the modal dialog for each command, it would be favorable to have an accompanying tabbed window 'Console' like File Status, Log / History and Search. \u00a0This tab would just show a rolling history of the git commands and the corresponding output output just as you would have from the command line. Perhaps a clear button too. In special cases, for example a merge conflict perhaps a dialog appears then (if possible). The modal dialog works but it's an extra click every time to Close. Most of us only wish to see output ~1/3 the time but it would more clicks to change the UI setting each time to view the git console output.\u00a0\r\n\r\nHope that makes sense and thanks for your consideration.\u00a0\r\n\r\nCheers!",

I start KDiff3 using the usual \"Resolve Conflict -> Use external diff tool\", the tools pops up, and then does it's magic.\r\n\r\nNow, for simple modifications (one line) or complex ones (lots of lines), the result is the same. I review the modification, select which branches, and when I am satisfied with the modification, save the file, and then close the KDiff3 app.\r\n\r\nUpon my return, Sourcetree has cleaned the compare files (I am refering to the \"*_BACKUP_SALT*\", \"*_BASE_SALT*\", \"*_LOCAL_SALT*\" and \"*_REMOTE_SALT*\" files that are generated during the call to the external diff app), as it should.\r\n\r\nBUT, the original file with conflict remains, as if nothing happened. Which means all my work for conflict resolution has been lost.\r\n\r\nWhen this happens, and because of this I know my handling of the external app is correct, I usually open the diff app, do THE EXACT SAME modification required (easy when only one line is conflicted), but instead of just closing the diff app, i refocus the sourcetree windows, return focus to the diff app, THEN close the diff app, and upon returning to the sourcetree app, all conflict files AND the conflicted file of the merge vanish from the \"Unstaged files\" windows.\r\n\r\nThing is, sometimes it happens, sometimes it does not, and my \"fix\" (if you can call it that) does not always prevent this behavior.\r\n\r\nIn light of this, is this a bug? If there a race condition where sourcetree blocks the correct handling of files by the external app, and then handles any error by just ignoring the modifications to the conflicted file? The is no error message whatsoever in either app, so it is quite difficult to see where things go bad.\r\n\r\nAny help on this matter is welcome.\r\n\r\nNOTE: I know sourcetree has issues when conflicts appears whenone of the file version is renamed or marked for deletion in the merge sequence: this is not this situation (which I handle by using the branches which deletes the files, usually).

Clicking the restore/maximise button has no effect, not even changing the status of the button. It is necessary to minimise the window before it will start to behave as expected\r\n * The line numbers in \"Blame\" are left-justified and butt up against the edge of the window, making them hard to read. Some more space (even two pixels!) would help enormously! They should also be right-justified, i.e. {color:#ff0000}*999*{color} should align with 1{color:#ff0000}*000*{color}, not with {color:#ff0000}*100*{color}0\r\n * In the \"Blame\" window, sometimes when double-clicking on the separator between the headings \"Line\" and \"Author\", it opens the log window. This does not happen every time and I don't know the exact trigger for it. Since it does not remember the column widths each time, this is something I do frequently",

This is just after trying it for a few minutes. I'm already really pissed off with what you have done to it. Besides, I'm not convinced you care. You have made it so hard to provide any feedback that I'm guessing you are actively discouraging it. It took me about 10 minutes of clicking around, following circular links, before I found somewhere I could send you any info. I didn't really want to open a JIRA ticket for this but you forced me to.
