Each click action took me 10s+ to process. After 2 days trying different solutions,, for example:\r\n * Tried this: [http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28105472/sourcetree-very-slow-with-many-repositories;]\r\n * Tried to change to beta version: Beta `2.0.12-beta-001`;\r\n * Reinstalled Sourcetree (both 1.10 and Beta);\r\n * Reinstalled Git (to the lastest version);\r\n\r\nBut what really solved my problem was disabling the Antivirus (mine is avast). Before 1.10 I used to use SourceTree with antivirus on everything worked fine. But since I updated, it's way too slow.\r\n\r\nDon't know if this is actually the problem, but since I disabled it, I had no more problems. Have been using it the whole day and it's normal.\r\n\r\nBy the way, since the start of the problem, even with just 1 and a new repository just for test, it was slow. So it had nothing to do with huge files, etc...\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nNote: Even when I tried to specify the path to my files to exclude from the antivirus, it had no effect, it was too slow. Only completely disabling the antivirus solve the problem.",
