QA verifies a subsequent build and marks it closed.\n\nWe want to visualize this flow with four columns in the kanban board.

      "description": "We have been using Jira Agile/Kanban for many years now. We recently decided that the Agile board should really be ordered first by priority, then rank within the priority. We also use swimlanes based on Epics, to organize our current features at the top.\n\nThis means that stakeholders priority tickets are pushed to the top of our Kanban board view, which helps us plan out the most important work.\nIn other words, the agile board shows tickets in the same order as stakeholder priority, and works well:\nproject in (MyPrac, PWS) ORDER BY priority DESC, Rank ASC\n\nCurrently Jira does not allow  \"Move to Top\" or drag and drop tickets vertically in the Agile view, even though it does allow \"Rank to Top\" on individual tickets. (When viewing the as in: \nhttps://issues.practichem.com/browse/MyPrac-1234)\nSteps to reproduce:\n# Set up a Kanban board with a filter containing: ORDER BY priority DESC, Rank ASC\n# In the view, attempt to drag and drop the ticket vertically to adjust rank.\n# Or, Click on the ticket, observe that the side panel shows more ticket information on the right, then click on ... for additional actions, and then click \"Move to Top\"\n# Observe that Jira does not adjust the rank, and that it displays an error:\n# Ranking is disabled, as the Filter Query for this board is not ordered by ascending Rank. Please check your filter configuration.\n# Expect that Jira moves the ticket to the top of the rank within the given priority. I'd be fine with a warning, if you want. \n\nThere isn't any real reason to block the re-rank completely, since this is a scenario where we are using \"atypical\" queries. When people do use these ordering schemes, Jira should still allow the adjustment, as much as possible.\n\nSince Rank is still relevant, and still part of the query (Rank ASC), I should be able to change the rank within a priority. (Rank to Top vs Move to Top). \nOf course, I don't expect that drag and drop or \"Move to Top\" should affect priority. Without this, organizing rank of tickets becomes quite tedious.",

That is to say, the *Stories* do not all need to be delivered together._\n\nThis can be achieved to an extent in JIRA using the labels field or a custom 'Theme' label field to record *Themes*. However it does not allow us to record any detail about the *Theme*.\n\nThis can also be achieved by using an *Epic* as though it were a *Theme*. But this prevents a *Story* from being in both a *Theme* and an *Epic* because the *Epic Link* only allows one *Theme*. The other problem is that a *Theme* isn't really an issue type, in that it would never want to be closed, you don't deliver a *Theme* but you do deliver an *Epic*.\n\nI believe *Themes* should be catered for in JIRA very differently to a normal Issue.

If it could be adjustable for each column on the board, so much the better.  Currently if I set the MAX constraint to \"N\" (Number of team members), assuming WIP for each user should be 1, then if a user has 2, but the value is still under \"N\", the constraint would not be violated, even though the intended constraint is being breached.  \n\nThere might also need to be some changes made on how that user shows up in the swimlanes/columns, so this may be more than just a simple change.\n\nI hope this is clear, but if not, please contact me at mark.galbraith@citrix.com for clarification.",

Summary\nAccording the documentation:\n* https://confluence.atlassian.com/cloud/blog/2015/12/jira-software-sprint-management-first-release\n{quote}\nAs previously blogged, we're now shipping the first release of the Manage Sprints permission changes on 6th December 2015. With the first release, the Manage Sprints permission will be created, and existing users with the Administer Project permission will be assigned the new permission for the same projects. The same sprint actions will check for the new permission, so it will be business as usual.\nThe following sprint-related actions will now be assigned to specific users in your team, thereby separating these from the actions that come with the Administer Project permission:\n* Creating sprints\n* Starting sprints\n* Completing sprints\n* Editing sprint information (sprint name and dates)\n* Reordering sprints  (currently only future sprints)\n* Deleting sprints (currently only future sprints)\n* Reopening sprints\n* Moving the sprint footer\n{quote}\n\nUsers should now be able to manage Sprints, this include Starting and completing sprints, by only having this new implemented permission: \"Manage Sprints\" permission.\nHowever, some users who have both \"Manage Sprints\" and \"Administer Projects\" are not being able to fulfil any of the actions above unless they are also *\"JIRA Administrators\"*, a permission that shouldn't be needed.\n\nh3. Environment\nJIRA Agile Cloud\n\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\n# Create a board and a new project;\n# Create a user with only Manage Sprints permission on this project;\n# Try to start the Sprint with this user.\n\nh3. Expected Results\nHaving the *Manage Sprints* permission should be enough to enable the user to complete the actions described above.\n\nh3. Actual Results\nEven with *Manage Sprints*, *Edit Issue*, *Schedule issue* and *Administer Projects* over all projects retrieved by the board's filter, the user can't start/complete\n\nh3. Workarounds\n\n*Suggested*\n* Provide user \"Manage Sprint\" permission across all permission schemes\n\n*Alternatives*\n* Create another temporary board without any sub query Eg: {{Project = TEST order by RANK ASC}}, create the sprint there. Use quick filter to filter the fields instead. \n* To start sprint, get administrator to initiate the sprint at this moment.\n* Provide a user \"JIRA Administrator\" Global Permission to Start/Stop any sprint\n\n",

      "description": "Currently, a person is allowed to manage a sprint (start/stop them, add/remove issues, etc.) if they have the required combination of project permissions in all projects \"visible\" to a sprint. While [#GHS-5035] will change how these permissions are structured, the permissions are still entirely governed by whether the user has permissions in a particular project or set of projects. This means there is no way for sprints/boards/teams that work on the same project(s) to be unable to manage sprints that are not from their board. This causes several problems:\n\n# Because only one sprint on a board can be open at a time, two teams working on the same project cannot work in separate sprints. I admit that this is not very \"Scrum\" but it is a *huge* problem for us. The current restrictions do not prevent work being done on the same project in different sprints anyway, you just need to have a second project on each board that differs between the two teams, i.e. Team 1 can work on Projects 1 and 2 while Team 2 work on Projects 2 and 3, but not if they both work only on Projects 1 and 2. N.B. There is a setting in JIRA Software Labs that can allow parallel sprints, please keep this feature!\n# Issues can easily be added to the wrong sprint, and users are presented with many sprints they should not have to see when choosing a sprint.\n# In our company we turn over a large number of small projects (one of the main reasons we have cross-functional teams that can collaborate on any specific project). Maintaining project-specific board filters for each board would be very complex and time consuming and very prone to issues getting \"lost\" if assigned to a user using a board that does not reference the relevant project, and nowhere near as elegant as an \"assignee in membersOf(...)\" type filter which is all that should be necessary for a team-centric board.\n\nMy argument is that Scrum boards and their associated sprints do not fundamentally map to a set of projects, they map to a particular team. In \"pure\" Scrum, a team works on a single project, and so there is an implied mapping from sprint to project which would mean project permissions would be sufficient to control who can manage a given set of sprints. However, JIRA Software is no longer called JIRA Agile and \"Scrum\" boards are based on any JQL query not on a list of projects, so I do not accept the notion that they are solely intended to be used with unique project mappings.\n\nHence, I believe there are two types of permission that need to be available:\n\n* Issue-based permissions that decide whether the user can add *that* issue to *any* sprint. These are the permissions that are currently in place.\n* Board-based permissions that decide whether the user can add *any* issue to *that* sprint. These are the permissions I would like to have implemented.\n\nSome solutions that would be fine for us:\n\n# Add a requirement that someone managing a sprint (starting/stopping/deleting/adding/removing/etc.) should not only have the project permissions already in place, but must also be an administrator on the \"origin board\" (see [#GHS-5035], [#comment-785773]) for that sprint. \n# Create a separate field on the board (\"Scrum Masters\" or \"Sprint Managers\"?) as opposed to using the existing Board Admin.\n\nWhat would *not* be workable is to do it based on who the board filter is shared with. We need many more people to be able to view a board than to be able to manage it (obviously).\n\nWhile planning, a user should only see sprints that they are able to manage, and they should be able to start that sprint even if other open sprints visible to the board but with a different origin board (that correspond to other teams working on the same project(s)) exist.",
