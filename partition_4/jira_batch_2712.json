I.e. on dashboard (and via remote API) I still got last build as successful. And although my build number (in above logs) was now greater than 1000, Bamboo claimed on dashboard and via API that the last build is e.g. 500 (which happened to be the last one before these problems started)\r\n* Cleaning working dir or full checkout did not help\r\n* I solved this problem by full clean and using anonymous SVN access or my private account. Only then Bamboo finally showed new build on dashboard (with number > 1000) and its real status.\r\n\r\nI suspect the problem may be also somehow connected to our SVN server which could have applied some security policies to avoid DOS attacks from Bamboo (Bamboo every 3 minutes - above 500 hundred times) was trying to checkout from svn the sources without success.\r\n",

The examples above don't cover all the possible failure modes because (conveniently) the prefix path \"/FE/\" coresponds to the name of the repository in the FishEye instance. (Also see BAM-2568)\r\n\r\nh3. Possible solutions\r\n\r\n* Add a *Web Repository Module Prefix* parameter, which is the prefix at which the FishEye repository is configured.\r\n* Allow a general regex mechanism for constructing link urls (BAM-1354)\r\n* Add a plugin point for generating SCM links (and for configuring said plugin in the Source Repository plan config page.
