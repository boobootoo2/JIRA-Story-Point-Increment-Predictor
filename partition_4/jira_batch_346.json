Our jobcosting system creates jobs for every new issue so time can be registered in a proper way.\r\n\r\nThe issue is that the webhook can't use alternative ports. Only 80 seems to be possible.\r\n\r\nSince we run loads of stuff on port 80 we can't also have the JIRA webhook listerner active there.\r\n\r\nWe have several webhooks from other systems running on alternative ports i hear from my developers, but JIRA is limited to port 80.\r\n\r\nTherefore the suggestion i'd like to make is to make it possible to use alternative portnumbers for webhooks.\r\n\r\nHope to see a positive feedback on my request!\r\n\r\nWishing all of you a nice day!\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nMark Pronk\r\n\r\nCEO / President\r\n\r\nModest Automatisering BV",

I can't believe this requirement here hasn't come up before this ticket. I wonder if this ticket is duplicative OR if there's already a solution.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n+Acceptance criteria:+ Only the allowable statuses highlight. Same statuses that appear as buttons on the issue screen appear as highlighted columns on drag/drop.\r\n\r\n+Long form:+\u00a0\r\n\r\nWhen using drag/drop on a Sprint Board, only those columns that the user is able to use should be highlighted. Those transitions which are unavailable due to workflow conditions should not be highlighted. This should match the buttons presented to the user on the issue screen, where the only buttons displayed are those that are available to the user.\r\n\r\nCurrently, all existing workflow transitions from the current status seem to be highlighting, including those which exist but which the user is prevented from using based on workflow conditions. That is, those transitions which DO NOT show as buttons on the issue screen DO show as highlighted columns on drag/drop.\u00a0\r\n\r\nWhen attempting to drop into one of these non-permitted statuses, the user is presented with an error message that does not match the actual error (screenshot attached).\r\n\r\nAn alternative short-term fix would be to clarify the error message when dropping to a non-permitted column. I am attaching a screengrab of the current error message, it's confusing to users as it does not indicate the reason for the error, rather it misleads the user.",
