With a normal link, or even epic link, it is possible to run JQL to find all linked issues where the parent issue meets certain criteria - for enterprise this is absolutely critical. \r\n* It's not possible to update the field via scripts, it's possible to do this for epic links\r\n* It's not possible to use add ons like Structure to build hierarchies as this isn't a real link type\r\n* It's not possible to use *basic search* for Parent Link field\r\n\r\nThis basically means the current implementation of the field/JQL is only useful if you want to find the epics linked to known parent initiatives, which only works if you have a small set of initiatives to work with - we have thousands, and cannot currently create a background link to use for searching when a \"parent link\" is created because we can't access the field value via scripts. \r\n\r\nPlease feel free to contact me if you would like more information about our use cases.",

If we use the earliest start date then this may become inaccurate if the preceding task's estimate changes.\n- We have an operational group that is doing work but don't reflect their work in JIRA - we would like to be able to render the work as a bar on the gantt chart but tracking status and allocating resources is a pain.

Problem\n\nCurrently there is no daily scheduling within Scrum sprints or hourly schedule within Kanban projects.\n\nPortfolio tries to solve a scheduling problem involving humans in a domain where stories are known to be difficult to estimate.\n When the story estimates are precise and stories are dependent on the results of previous stories in a sequential manner, Portfolio is not able to schedule accurately.\n\nIf on a Kanban project, short dependent stories that are meant to be sequential, they can be either scheduled concurrently (if resources are available) or on different days.\n In Scrum projects, dependent stories will either be scheduled concurrently (if resources are available) or on different sprints. There is no sub-sprint granularity.\n\nAs an scheduler, I'd like stories with dependencies to be scheduled after the completion of the blocking story but in the same sprint or day if resources permit.\nh2. Configuration Examples:\n\nWhen using Portfolio in Scrum mode:\n * With Dependent Story Constraint switched on, dependant stories can't be in the same sprint, even if they have a short duration.\n * With Dependant Story Constraint switched off, the blocked story won't start before the dependant story but stories may be scheduled concurrently, so the dependant stories may be scheduled by Portfolio before the dependant story is complete and can actually be worked on.\n\nWhen using Portfolio in Kanban mode:\n * With Dependent Story Constraint switched on, dependant stories are scheduled the next day, disregarding the estimates. 3 dependent stories of 1h are scheduled in 3 different days.\n * With Dependant Story Constraint switched off, dependent stories may be scheduled concurrently and 3 dependent stories of 6h scheduled in the same 8h day if resources allow.\n\nThe ON option doesn't allow for stories to be scheduled in a sequential manner with a granularity of hours.\n The OFF option is expected to ignore story completion dependency.\nh2. Suggestion:\n\nI'd like an option to enforce more granularity, so the schedule is done on an hourly basis for Kanban and daily basis for Scrum.\n Alternatively: a configurable timespan (week or sprint) to calculate at a higher granularity.\nh2. Notes:\n\nThe time granularity is a linear factor in the complexity of the scheduling algorithm and increases will cause slowness when calculating the schedule.\nh2. Use cases:\n * Sequential stories for operational Kanban teams. Some stories are done manually and others automated and normally short (1h). Estimates are precise.\n * Scrum teams that have well planned dependencies that form a chain of concurrent stories that may or may not fit the sprint.",

Problem Definition\nAll our Product Owners want to be able to plan Stories into releases/Fixed Version/s using the Back on the Agile board and then see a timeline view of this in a Portfolio Plan.\nHowever, when the Portfolio plan/timeline is generated, Stories that haven't had a release/Fixed Version/s assigned to them often end up being automatically scheduled into Releases (and have a blue Release assignment in the Scope section of the Portfolio Plan). This behaviour is never desired in the way our Product Owners want to use Portfolio and always results in a lot of confusion and questions as unexpected Stories end up being included in releases\n\nh3.

Typically, I'm clicking the bar to navigate between the various items to review estimates or team assignments ... not to read the summary or description. I would suggest changing the behavior to simply bring the scope item into view and highlight it ... then creating another mechanism to invoke the detail view.

When viewing the 'story' hierarchy level, epics normally don't show up at all unless there is an estimate set on the epic. This 'unstructured' part of the epic that is not represented by any of its stories will be visible in the timeline even when viewing the 'story' level.\n\n*Suggested Solution*\n\nRaise a documentation for Portfolio to explain the behaviour so user can understand it.\n\n*Workaround*\n\nNone.",
