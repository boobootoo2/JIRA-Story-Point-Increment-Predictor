Canned responses allow your teams to reuse saved responses, much like a template for your reply. This feature will save time and make your team more efficient in dealing with their customer's requests.\r\n\r\nTo find out more about this feature, check out our documentation here:\r\n [https://confluence.atlassian.com/servicedesk/jira-service-desk-3-7-x-release-notes-934718353.html]\r\n\r\nOn behalf of the JSD team, I want to thank all of you for contributing to this ticket. Your comments, feedback and inputs have shaped this feature.\r\n\r\n\u2014 JIRA Service Desk Team.\r\n{panel}\r\n{panel:title=Updated as of 6 Dec 2016}\r\nHi all,\r\n\r\nThank you so much for your votes and comments on this suggestion. We have a few open questions around the design of this feature and would love to hear your feedback on it. We have created a quick survey to capture the feedback: [https://jiraservicedesk.typeform.com/to/GSiRrM]\r\n\r\nThank you again for all your continuous feedback!\r\n\r\n\u2014 JIRA Service Desk team\r\n{panel}\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nIt would better if JIRA Service Desk can provide a canned response functionality to reply to customer tickets with a pre-made response/template.",

This means if it is changed it may not affect previous issues. For example:\r\n\r\n* JSP-1 and JSP-2 are raised.\r\n* The SLA is changed. JSP-1 does not appear to be updated.\r\n\r\nWhen the re-calculate SLA code runs after an SLA config change it sees that and deems JSP-1 as not ongoing and hence it does not \"re-invent\" that JSP-1 met SLA under the new rules.  Instead it clears that SLA was ever met.\r\n\r\nNow why does it do that?  \r\n\r\nWell its because the semantics of re-writing SLA history is complicated and invokes existential dilemmas that only the like of Emmanuelle Kant, Renee Descartes and [~miruflin] can answer. So instead of pretending that SLA where met or not met, SD decides they never existed. We could do a better job in informing the user of the impact of the SLA change at the time of the change and have raised issue JSD-494 for this.\r\n\r\nAt the minimum please enhance the product so that it warns users about this.",

We ran into a scenario where a workflow (that was shared by multiple departments) was altered in a way that ended up breaking other group's workflows.  The steps it took to recover everything were painful and long, a way to track and revert such alterations would really be helpful.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n-rob  ",

Preferably it could be configurable to add any of fields which are in the issue in JIRA itself.

For example all of our clients pay quarterly SLA fee for lets say 100h of support. Any extra time goes by time-and-material scheme and is invoices extra.
