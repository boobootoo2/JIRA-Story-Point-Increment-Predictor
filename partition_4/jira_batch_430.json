Make concatenator an optional configuration which may be empty2. Don't just extract the first regex group but extract all groups in the regex and join them together (without concatenator).The second approach would be the most flexible solution as it would allow me to simply use the regex \"+(\\d+) ((\\d+)) (\\d+)-?(\\d+)\" and it would extract the values as expected.If there already exists an alternative way I'm not aware of, please let me know\u00a0 !https://portal.riada.io/images/icons/emoticons/smile.png|width=16,height=16! .Regards,Andreas",

This feature would be great to have on the object attributes. For example, one can then show the key/id for the objects in the list, making it possible again to see the differense between objects with same name.Steps to reproduce: * Create a objectType, e.g. \"Tests\" * Create a attribute of the type \"Object\" with value \"Tests\". Name it e..g \"Object\" * Create multiple objects with the same name, e.g. \"Test\" * On the third create, click the dropdown for setting the \"Object\" attribute.One can then see one have multiple objects named \"Test\" in the dropdown list, but no way to differentiate it. See the attached screenshot.!image-2019-06-04-21-54-42-570.png|width=328,height=258!\u00a0Alternatively suggestion is to include the KEY of the object in the dropdown list, or any other way to identify which object is which.",

      "description": "Hey,IQL only supports double quotes when an object or attribute contain whitespaces. This is a bit inconsistent with how many other languages do this.This becomes quite clear when using the JQL function\u00a0_iqlFunction_.The function itself requires that the IQL is quoted (the outer quotes) and if the IQL contains objects/attributes containing whitespaces these need to be quoted as well (the inner quotes)This is a very common scenario.If I am only using double quotes I will need to escape all the inner quotes to make this work, e.g.\u00a0_\"My Domain(s)\" in iqlFunction(\"\\\"Parent OU\\\" IN (\\\"Accountable CEO\\\")\")_\u00a0This is really hard to read and trying to get users to understand this is almost impossible.I played around mixing double and single quotes here since this is a common way to get around this issue when you have outer and inner quotes present and found that the iqlFunction itself is happy with either single or double quotes and if I use this approach having single quotes as my outer quote the JQL will be a lot cleaner:\u00a0_\"My Domain(s)\" in iqlFunction('\"Parent OU\" IN (\"Accountable CEO\")')_However, if I try the other way around having double quotes as my outer quotes and single quotes in my IQL query, Insight is throwing an error:\u00a0*IQL in iqlFunction is not valid*The common practice in my opinion is that single and double quotes shall be possible to use independently meaning that they mean the same thing and shall be used when two sets of quotes are needed.I can refer to the similar JQL function,\u00a0_issuefunction_\u00a0provided by the Script Runner which handles these two variants independently.Also in most programming languages it is ok to use either single or double quotes when e.g. a string is defined. It is the based on the user's preference which to use.So please consider supporting single quotes as well in IQL so that the user can choose how to manage situations when you need two sets of quotes.",
