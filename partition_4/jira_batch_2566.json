It is a very useful feature, because you can have your personal/project blog and its source in your repository, and posting to it is as simple as adding a new text file (in markdown/textile).\n\nIn order for Bitbucket to host a user page (username.bitbucket.org), the file index.html has to be in the root directory of the repository. So if one wants to create a similar solution on Bitbucket, one has to generate the site with jekyll every time before posting, and even so, jekyll has to be modified, because the original version cannot manage a configuration where the jekyll source directory (eg. &#x27;/jekyll&#x27;) is inside the desination directory (where index.html will be, &#x27;/&#x27;).\n\nIt would be very nice if a simple solution could be used, just like in Github.",

When Bitbucket has functionality that I dislike, I am not free to implement suggestions for you. At best, I can beg and argue with you when you decide that my suggestion is not a good one. If Bitbucket were free, I could go and implement it and show you, \"see, this is how it could work, what do you think?\" I could have much more leverage with which to help Bitbucket be better if it were free.\n\nI was told that Bitbucket is not free because it is commercial. I do not understand why this is an explanation. Red Hat is free and commercial. Some of the best money I&#x27;ve ever spent. Gitorious is free and commercial despite more directly competing with a behemoth like github. From what we know of their finances, both of these are successful commercial ventures. And they are free.\n\nI am not asking you to give up your trademark, your savoir-faire, your brand image, your hosting, your servers. Ultimately, all of this is what you really sell, just like Red Hat sells support and Gitorious sells support and hosting. I only see you adding value to Bitbucket if you make it free.\n\nHell, I will *pay* for access to the source. As much as 50, no, 100 USD per month for a premium source access subscription. Make it so that only premium subscribers have read access to the master Bitbucket repository. I will *pay* for the privilege to collaborate with you instead of begging you to make changes and arguing with you when you decide WONTFIX, HOLD, LATER, NOTABUG, CANTREPRODUCE.\n\nMake it AGPL. If I or anyone else decides to run off with the source and make a knockoff site (which, btw, I haven&#x27;t seen happen with gitorious yet, perhaps you have?), your source won&#x27;t give us a competitive advantage, because we won&#x27;t have the service, hosting, trademark, brand name, and support you actually sell. Give me the opportunity to buy another product from you.\n\nAs it is stands right now, I am not happy with Bitbucket. I think it has potential, but I can&#x27;t fix it when it doesn&#x27;t work. Every user of this site is a developer. Every user is a potential collaborator, moreso than any other kind of software. We hackers also like to hack with our and *on* our tools. We are already writing code. We all give you our source. You don&#x27;t give us yours. We gave you Mercurial, Python, Pygments, Django. Please give us Bitbucket.\n\nCollaborate with us. Share source like we share it with you. Make it free.",

I can confirm that Konqueror parses the README.rst OK\n\nSorry\n\n----\nHello,\n\nI have a README.rst file in one repository of bitbucket and I can see that some text itemized with - are incorrectly parsed with bitbucket if it compared with rst2html tool. I attach two screenshots with the results of my README.rst parsed by bitbucket and by rst2html (with the options -g -t -s --language=es --no-compact-lists --no-compact-field-lists).\n\nAs you can see, with nested itemized sections, the bitbucket parser puts the text not in the same line as the item mark.\n\nIs it a bug?\n\nThanks",

My home & repository pages feel cluttered.\n* ** Easier access control**: Client projects and internal projects. Client projects always have the same set of permissions and same goes for internal projects, but they are different sets of permissions.\n* *Friendlier URLs*: I think that maybe it would be more natural to have something like account/clients/client-x/site and account/clients/client-x/store than account/client-x-site and account/client-x-store.\n* *Potential Automatic hgsub generation*: Maybe if, say, there is an account/foo repository, there would be a button that says \"Add Sub repo\", this would ask you the normal stuff to create the new repo and where you want to land it in the parent repo. If, perhaps, you wanted to use an existing one it would just ask you the URL (or Bitbucket path) and where you want to land it.",

This should be an easy thing to do and will give people more flexibility in how their repository looks.\n\nCheers,\\\\\nMatt",
