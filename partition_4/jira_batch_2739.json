Thus, notifying activities on all branches is impractical.\u00a0 but the notification on the major branches is necessary.\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nProvide an option where notifications can be restricted to certain branches.\u00a0This feature is available on your BitBucket Cloud Slack integration.

In contrast to the Slack app,\u00a0Confluence itself will NOT send an email notification in this case.\r\n\r\nWhen taking a look at the Confluence source code, a check for space level permissions and content level view permissions (page restrictions) is done before sending email notifications.
