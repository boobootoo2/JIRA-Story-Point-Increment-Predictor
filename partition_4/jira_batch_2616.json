Problem Definition\r\n\r\nIf a build containing several new commits fails, and then later on another build is performed containing additional commits, the \"Commits\" tab will only show the subset of commits since the last failed build. In some workflows this can be an issue, as we may want to see\u00a0everything new the build contains since the last successful build.\r\n\r\nFor example,\u00a0if generating a new release from build results we would want to see everything the new release \"contains\" - which is not possible if the commits tab only show minor commits about fixing a build failure, and not all the changes the previous build was intended to include.\r\nh3.

But your JIRA configuration wouldn't allow be to create a \"bug\" and told me to raise a support ticket, and your support staff told me to file an enhancement request.\r\n\r\nWhile the bamboo_buildPlanName and bamboo_planName contain the plan name, it can not be extracted with 100% reliably because the character sequence \" - \" used to delimit project and plan names are valid in project and plan names themselves.\r\n\r\nI filed BAM-17988 to request a new environment variable for the project name, but to be truly useful we also need a plan name environment variable that contains the plan name (it makes no sense to me why bamboo_shortPlanName does not).\r\n\r\nIn general, I find it more separate values more useful than composite or derived values. It's usually easy to paste two or more variables together; it's often much harder (or impossible) to extract individual values from a composite. \u00a0For example, I averaged 60 miles/hour on my commute this morning \u2013 how long did I\u00a0take to get to work?\r\n\r\nIdeally there wouldn't be\u00a0variables like bamboo_buildPlanName or bamboo_planName at all, as users that need a string with project name + plan name + branch name + job name could construct it out of component parts (Of course, now that these\u00a0exists they can't be removed, I'm just using this an example of the principle).",

Steps to reproduce:\r\n * Install [Automation with AWS (Bamboo)|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/net.utoolity.atlassian.bamboo.automation-with-aws-bamboo/server/overview]\r\n * Configure at least one System Scope connector under {{plugins/servlet/identity-federation-for-aws/configuration/aws-connector}} (this does not have to be based on real AWS credentials, a dummy entry will do for the repro case)\r\n * Add a Plan level notification using the \"Automate with AWS\" recipient type (again, any entries will do, e.g. selecting the dummy connector created above, an arbitrary action and an empty JSON \"\\{}\" for the Parameters field just to pass validation)\r\n * Disable the add-on\r\n * Enable the add-on\r\n * Try to edit the notification created above (or just refresh the Plan Notifications page) - _this will trigger the SPDE, logged to the main Bamboo log._\r\n\r\nh4. Partial workaround\r\n\r\nWe have not found a way to prevent this exception, but once the issue occurs, it can be fixed by adding/removing a dummy notification:\r\n * Add an arbitrary new dummy notification (for example, notify a User and select yourself).\r\n * The notification list should now surface your intended edit on the original notification.\r\n * Delete the dummy notification again.\r\n\r\nThis seems to trigger a complete refresh of the involved NotificationRecipient instances, thus fixing the issue.",

Suggested Solution\r\nA database migration wizard where the user sets target database connection string.

You will need to write out the Docker commands that you want to use.\r\n\r\nh3. External links\r\nThis issue was initially reported to Docker here:  https://github.com/docker/toolbox/issues/433\r\nBut the recommended fix doesn't work in this case.\r\n\r\nWe opened this ticket to follow-up:  https://github.com/docker/docker/issues/27592\r\n",

      "description": "h3. Summary\r\nWhen using custom revision to queue a build there is no lock placed on the git cache. Because there's no lock present, when two or more threads fetch on the same directory we encounter git's own protection against concurrent access. The second fetch will fail but then Bamboo detects that the fetch has failed and in an attempt to restore consistency, removes the cache. This causes the other builds to fail when the cache is removed.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Set the concurrent build limit to 6\r\n# Concurrent calls to {{/rest/api/latest/queue/PROJ-PLAN?customRevision=revisionhash}} to plans that share the same git cache (Key is defined by combination of repository URL & username) e.g. {code}seq 6 | parallel curl -u admin:password -X POST http://bamboo/rest/api/latest/queue/PROJ-PLAN?customRevision=52b8b228d81723b56be98c1c2ad299bd1b43baa0q!{code}\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nLock is placed on the cache so concurrent plans using the same cache with a custom revision don't fail.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nThe below exception is thrown in the atlassian-bamboo.log file:\r\n{noformat}\r\ncom.atlassian.bamboo.plugins.stash.repository.StashRepositoryException: com.atlassian.bamboo.repository.RepositoryException: : Cannot fetch branch 'refs/heads/*' from 'ssh://git@bitbucket:7999/proj/repo.git' to source directory '/var/bamboo-home/xml-data/build-dir/_git-repositories-cache/xxx'. fatal: FETCH_HEAD is empty after fetch.\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nMultiple plans using the same cache that are triggered using custom revision fail, while some succeed. The number of failing plans and which plans fail, is random.\r\n\r\nh3.Workaround\r\n# Use git repository with HTTP authentication and different usernames on each plan so that the cache is separate per build.\r\n# Use a script task to execute the source code checkout to bypass the git cache and fetch directly from the repository. Pass the revision in using a variable e.g. {code}POST http://bamboo/rest/api/latest/queue/PROJ-PLA?bamboo.variable.customCommit=52b8b228d81723b56be98c1c2ad299bd1b43baa0q{code}",

Context\r\n\r\nWhen adding a new repository as linked repository or straight to a plan the following option is checked by default: *Admin >> Linked Repositories >> (selected Repository) >> Use shallow clones*. This makes Bamboo to shallow clone the repository which is not cloned with the full history. This behavior is not desired when planning to push or merge to or from the referred repository.\r\n\r\nIn some cases this won't create any problems in others this could lead to unnecessary conflicts. This is what we see in git manual:\r\n{quote}\r\nA [shallow clone|https://git-scm.com/docs/user-manual/2.8.0#def_shallow_clone], with its truncated history, is useful when one is interested only in recent history of a project and getting full history from the upstream is expensive.\r\n\r\nA [shallow clone|https://git-scm.com/docs/user-manual/2.8.0#def_shallow_clone] is created by specifying the [git\\-fetch\\[1\\]|https://git-scm.com/docs/git-fetch] *\\-\\-depth* switch. The depth can later be changed with the [git\\-fetch\\[1\\]|https://git-scm.com/docs/git-fetch] *\\-\\-depth* switch, or full history restored with *\\-\\-unshallow*.\r\n\r\nMerging inside a [shallow clone|https://git-scm.com/docs/user-manual/2.8.0#def_shallow_clone] will work as long as a merge base is in the recent history. Otherwise, it will be like merging unrelated histories and may have to result in huge conflicts. This limitation may make such a repository unsuitable to be used in merge based workflows.\r\n{quote}\r\n^Reference: [How to get a Git repository with minimal history - Git \\- user\\-manual Documentation|https://git-scm.com/docs/user-manual.html]^\r\n\r\nThere are also some threads about this subject:\r\n* [git \\- Pushing to github after a shallow clone \\- Stack Overflow|http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11375070/pushing-to-github-after-a-shallow-clone]\r\n* [git \\- Why can't I push from a shallow clone? \\- Stack Overflow|http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6900103/why-cant-i-push-from-a-shallow-clone]\r\n\r\nh4.

Also the *use shallow clones* option is set by default in the advanced options depending on how a user creates the repository (please refer to *Notes* section bellow).\r\n\r\nh4. Suggestion\r\n\r\n# Add a validation to avoid using *shallow clones* when the *Automatic branch merge feature is used.\r\n# Do not check the *use shallow clones* option by default when setting any repository.\r\n\r\nh4.

      "description": "As an admin I would like to ask for an investigation about the oracle driver bundled with Bamboo since I'm facing problems when using the bundled version (ojdbc6-11.2.0.2.0.jar).\r\nWhen switching this version to (ojdbc6-11.2.0.4.0.jar) the problem is gone. \r\nAlso, according to [Oracle Database 11g Release 2 JDBC Driver Downloads|http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/apps-tech/jdbc-112010-090769.html] the bundled driver seems to be certified to *Classes for use with JDK 1.6* only and Bamboo is now using JDK 8.\r\n\r\nIt's also a good idea to evaluate a newer driver since Bamboo is now restricted to Oracle 12c.\r\n* [Oracle Database 12c Release 1 JDBC Driver Downloads|http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/features/jdbc/jdbc-drivers-12c-download-1958347.html]",

      "description": "h3. Summary\r\nWhen certain records contain ASCII NUL ( X'00' ) the Bamboo XML export will fail with *Invalid null character* as soon as it hits that record. \r\n\r\nThis error is not always visible in the UI, sometimes Bamboo reports that the export was successful despite the error. A separate bug report exists for this: [BAM-17957|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/BAM-17957]\r\n\r\nThe current columns where we've encountered this: \r\n* VARIABLE_VALUE and VARIABLE_KEY in table VARIABLE_CONTEXT (offending data appears to be loaded via Inject variables)\r\n* VARIABLE_VALUE and VARIABLE_KEY in table VARIABLE_DEFINITION (offending data appears to be loaded via Inject variables)\r\n* FAILURE_REASON in table MERGE_RESULT\r\n* CUSTOM_INFO_KEY and CUSTOM_INFO_VALUE in BUILDRESULTSUMMARY_CUSTOMDATA\r\n* MSG in AUDIT_LOG\r\n* KEY_IDENTIFIER and VALUE in CAPABILITY \r\n* NEW_VALUE in AUDIT_LOG\r\n\r\nWe have also experienced this in the past with data in AUTH_ATTEMPT_INFO which was fixed in 5.10: [BAM-15093 Exclude AUTH_ATTEMPT_INFO from Bamboo's backup|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/BAM-15093]\r\n\r\nh3. Environment\r\n* MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server or Oracle as the database engine\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Spin up a fresh instance connected to MySQL \r\n# Create a build plan\r\n# Add an inject variable task > Load the attached {{test.prop}} in with result scope\r\n# Build the plan\r\n# Bamboo Admin > Export (with results)\r\n\r\nAlternatively \r\n# Spin up a fresh instance connected to MySQL \r\n# Create a build plan\r\n# Add a plan variable through the UI\r\n# Build the plan\r\n# Update the VARIABLE_VALUE in VARIABLE_DEFINITION to contain the ASCII NUL via SQL\r\n# Bamboo Admin > Export \r\n\r\nNote: Builds on PostgreSQL fail to inject the variable.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nXML export would succeed, stripping the invalid null character\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nThe resulting export zip is incomplete. _projects.xml_ is truncated at point of failure.\r\nThe below exception is thrown in the atlassian-bamboo.log file:\r\n{code}\r\n2016-11-21

Suggested Solution\r\nCreate a \"Network Copy\" task in Bamboo to transfer file via network protocols like NFS or SMB. Potential parameters could be:\r\n* Target\r\n* Target directory\r\n* Exclude/include file pattern\r\n* Credentials\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\nUse a script task to copy the files to network storage",

Pre-bootstrap validation task 51111 completes successfully despite detecting the unsupported database version, the upgrade will then proceed to convert all column names to UPPER CASE and fail eventually on the schema upgrade with {{java.sql.SQLException: Invalid object name 'sys.sequences'.}} due to the unsupported database version e.g. MS SQL 2008. \r\n\r\nAt this point rollback cannot be achieved without rolling back the database, as the previous versions will be incompatible with the UPPER CASE column names.\r\n\r\nh3.

Problem Definition\r\n\r\nWe currently do not check error output for Build Tasks, but for tasks such as PHPUnit, which can be configured to output to stderr, we won't find the build result.\r\n\r\nThis can cause false negatives since the \"OK\" will not be found.\r\n\r\nIn a Support Ticket, we have the following report from a customer:\r\n{quote}\r\nIt is possible to make phpunit output the results on stderr instead of stdout (through configuration `stderr=\"true\"` or the `--stderr` flag).\r\n Currently, the PHPUnit task expects the string \"OK\" on stdout in order to determine that the task ran successfully. This is naive because obviously it could also appear on stderr.\r\n{quote}\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nAllow tasks to search for success markers in stderr as well as stdout.\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nUse stdout instead of stderr.",
