When using Bitbucket&#x27;s branch functionality, the empty branch commit is counted as a commit by JIRA. Therefore, it appears that there was code committed against an issue, when actually only a branch was created.\n\nWhen rebasing the branch, the rebase will fail unless the branch commit is marked as skip.\n\nThis branch functionality is different than the git command line tool and the normal way of doing git branching.

So the missing part of testing in cloud can also be added. We would like to partner with you and offer these features. We have done similar work for open source scm-manager.org. We developed the plug-ins for scm-manager.com. The applications are completely integrated and they sync with the development cycle continuously We would love to demonstrate Megam to you. Let us know if there is a interest in Bitbucket on this feature.\n\nOur developed code is available in here : https://github.com/indykish",
