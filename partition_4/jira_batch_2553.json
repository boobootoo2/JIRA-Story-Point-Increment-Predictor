      "description": "Currently, strikethrough is not supported in Markdown README files, or in wiki pages. This is for the obvious reason that the Markdown Syntax doesn&#x27;t support strike through. (Personally, it&#x27;s an annoying oversight.) Generally speaking, it&#x27;s useful to be able to have a todo list, and \"cross off\" items as you work on them.\n\nIn other markdown enabled sites, <del> or <s> can be used. That&#x27;s not possible, given Bitbucket&#x27;s policy.\n\nWhat I propose is extending Markdown&#x27;s syntax slightly:\n\n{{{\n\nh1. Todo:\n* Some Item\n* Some Other Item\n* ~Some Finished Item~\\\\\n}}}\n\nUsing {{~}} as the character to represent strike through is used in other syntax, and I think would make a decent amount of sense. Since Bitbucket is built ontop of django, it should be possible to implement this as a template filter in a fairly straightforward manner. (I might even be able to submit an example one once work dies down a bit.)\n\nIt may seem like a small issue, but I&#x27;ve run into it enough that I felt it&#x27;s worth devoting a ticket and some time towards. Let&#x27;s hope the devs agree.",

There is only one thing that concerns us: the overview.\n\nCurrently we have no way of grouping repositories together. The frontpage overview just lists all our repos, meshed together. This makes it almost impossible for us to cleanly distinguish between our different projects.\n\nEg.: We maintain our own Drupal tree together with all submodules.

Reassign or close issue, or maybe change the priority...\n... whoops!  you can&#x27;t do that now!\n\nWhen viewing an issue, I can comment on it or attach a file immediately, but what if I want to change the title, assignee, type, priority, or component?  Oh, wait, I think I see.  I have to click \"edit issue,\" at the very top?  And then I can also comment on it there... but I can ONLY see the original title and description, and NOT any of the subsequent comments, including the comment I just made?!\n\nIs this also a \"fix\" for something which confused people?  I admit, all those radio buttons were confusing.  The new set of drop-downs makes more sense--except the status drop-down--but I would suggest just put those drop-downs there from the get-go for anyone who has rights to edit the issue, without making the user click \"Edit Issue\" and hiding all the comments.\n\nRegarding the status drop-down, I think \"reopen\" and \"resolve\" are confusing as separate buttons.  It would make a lot more sense to just put \"open\" and \"resolved\" in the drop-down.  I also don&#x27;t think \"workflow\" is a good substitute for \"status,\" which is the correct name for the field.  I recommend making \"Status\" an additional drop-down, like the other items, to the side of every issue, and allow the commenter to change them directly and submit them with the comment as described above.",

      "description": "Hello Bitbucket team,\n\nWe&#x27;ve been having a major issue since we converted our account to a team account that we hadn&#x27;t had before. It is consistently timing out on us when we go to push up our changesets. Some of our projects contain large files and this issue is crippling to us. We would use ssh which seams to work a bit better, but our office is mostly non technical people (artists), so even just setting this up is not really much of an option for us.\n\nIs there a way we can set this up so https doesn&#x27;t time out after a few minutes, maybe like an hour or two?\n\nThanks,\\\\\nFour Story Creative",

You can browse the commit with a revision code, which isn&#x27;t simply 1-6 but some annoying hash. I sometimes need to browse the code so I look at the commits screen, and have to manually copy that code, go to the source tab, paste that code so I can finally browse it. Can we please get a SOURCE link on the commit screen (overview + detailed view)?",
