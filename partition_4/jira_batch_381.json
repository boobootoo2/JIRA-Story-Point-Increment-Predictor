Cause\n\nThe cause of this issue is that the *Epic Status* field is not configured correctly. Specifically, the field is expected to be configured with only one custom field context, which applies to issues in All Projects, with issue type Epic.\n\nIf the field is configured with one context which selects specific projects and issue type Epic, the upgrade task will fail.\n\nh3. Work around\n\nIf the Epic Status field is in this configured state, it should not be \"locked\" (as it is a non-standard configuration). Therefore it should be possible to amend the configuration as follows:\n\n# View all Custom Fields\n# Find Epic Status and choose Configure\n# Find the default custom field context (there should be only one) and Edit it\n# At the bottom of the screen, under projects, choose Global Projects instead of selecting specific projects.\n# Disable and re-enable the JIRA Agile plugin\n# Re-indexing the instance\n\nThe upgrade task should then succeed, and JIRA Agile functionality will be restored. This however may have the side effect of locking the Epic Status field from further updates. However, the initial configuration of the custom field context selecting specific projects is unsupported.",

However dates can be skipped as the sprint will basically never end, instead a normal kanban mode deploy is done from time to time, while people still continue to work on issues in progress.\n\n",

For example a project may have a front end JavaScript MVC application and a server side API as two distinct repositories. One may be released without the other and vice versa, so we created a board with two quick filters, one for each component. The problem is that when you view the board with a quick filter applied and they you hit the release link, the release modal opens and says that all of the tickets will be released, not just the ones currently on the board scoped by the quick filter. What I would expect is that when you release, you only release the tickets currently visible on the board. ",

      "description": "TL;DR: It can be non trivial to get a list of unique projects which are returned by a given JQL query. If we list these out, then admins will be better able to troubleshoot permissions issues.\n\nFrom a support ticket:\n\n{code}The Agile Board will not allow you to create a sprint if you don't have appropriate permissions for all the projects covered by the board's filter. Unfortunately people sometimes inadvertently include a project through using links as part of their query, or where someone has been assigned some small task in another project. There could be just a couple of tasks from that project in the filter of hundreds of issues and this can be hard to find.\n\nIt would be great if on the Agile Board->Configuration->Filter screen you could show the list of projects that are being picked up by the current filter.\n\nOften I get scrum masters asking me why the create sprint button is not working for them after they have created a new board or modified a filter. It was working before and now it isn't and they and I can't see why.\n\nAlso the Version Report can also have trouble when unexpected tasks appear in the filter (e.g. a task from another project but without its parent story).\n\nHaving a simple list of projects would be a very useful hint as to where there could be a problem. If there are any unexpected projects then that will be a great pointer.{code}\n",

Although Tuesday is technically the last day of the sprint, the developers still have all day to complete their work. Therefore, there should never be a count of zero days left as that implies it is the start of the next sprint.\n\nThe thought process behind the current behavior is that, technically at the end of Tuesday there is no time left in the sprint, so therefore there are zero days remaining then. \n\n+*Solution Suggested:*+\nTo avoid this, a potential fix could be updating the gadget to change to an hourly scale on the last day of the sprint. As time passes on the last day, devs will get a clear indication of how much time is left.",

Summary \nEarlier today I learned that non-working days is registered per board in Jira Agile instead of in one place as it was with Greenhopper (https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/212326/how-does-jira-agile-consider-non-working-days). \nWe have several boards, and this basically means that I have to register the same X number of non-working days on every board we have in Jira around new years every year. \nIt would be great to have the possibility to copy these days from one board to another (or perhaps have a general configuration for this that will be adopted for all boards by default), just to remove the work and the possibility of loosing out on one/picking the wrong one, etc.\n\nh4. Workaround\n(i) Tested in JIRA Agile 6.7.0\nUse the following REST call:\n{code}POST http://<jira-baseurl>/rest/greenhopper/1.0/rapidviewconfig/workingdays/nonworkingday/add{code}\nWith the following JSON data:\n{code}{\"rapidViewId\":2,\"iso8601Date\":\"2015-05-31\"}{code}\nWhere rapidViewId is the ID of the Scrum board, and iso8601Date is date to be added. \nTaken from [Paul's comment|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/GHS-9833?focusedCommentId=720812&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-720812].",

      "description": "Hello,\n\nI ran into an interesting situation which I do NOT have an explanation for. I had some co-workers setup a Rapid Board. They had two active sprints going on, one right after the other. (e.g. September 1 to September 7 for Sprint 1 and September 8 to September 15 for Sprint 2). What was going on was that they were trying to change the Sprint number on the issues from 2 to 1 or 1 to 2. Vise Versa and the Sprint field was marking on the issue \"Extended Sprint\". When they input the sprintid number (e.g. 73) they got it back to saying Sprint 2 otherwise just putting a two in put it back to Extended Sprint. They completed the first Sprint and these items still occurred.\n\nThe information I am trying to achieve is the following:\n\n1. What causes the issue to display in the Sprint Field \"EXTENDED SPRINT\"?\n2. Why would you need to put in the sprintid number (e.g. 73) to get the correct sprint number to display instead of just putting a 2 or 1 when your sprint is named \"Sprint 2 or Sprint 1\"?\n3. What are some pointers to avoid in the future to avoid this happening again?\n\nAnyways, any information on this would be much appreciated. Thank you",

I would love to have this feature as well. I really hope that you are going to implement it in the near future because it allows project manager to use the agile board even for the more \"classic\" project management which still many of our customers love. Even for the Agile Planning this feature would bring a lot of advantages.\n\nPlease don't hesitate to contact me for any questions. I would really love to see this feature!\n\nCheers\nBj\u00f6rn Frauen\n",
