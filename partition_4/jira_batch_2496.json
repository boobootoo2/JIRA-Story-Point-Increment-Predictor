But clearly the error is either wrong or should be a more explicit \"warning\" as the settings worked !? But also led to a failed attempt I cannot delete!\n\nan example using the SourceForge command line translating to fields would be good!! ie\n\n{code}\nsvn checkout svn://svn.code.sf.net/p/web-erp/code/trunk web-erp-code\n{code}\n\nshowing:\\\\\nProject name = web-erp (the FIRST bit after \"svn://svn.code.sf.net/p/\" )\\\\\nMount point  = code/trunk (the bit after the Project name without a leading \"\")\\\\\nwould have saved me loads of time and frustration !!\n\nHowever I now have a repository called \"web-erp\" that failed due to the wrong settings and cannot delete it !! any help on this?\n\nFor the other SourceForge Project I was able to import but with a \"No repository exists at that URL\" message, but it seemed to work and come across.\n\nthe sourceforge pull was\\\\\n{{hg clone http://hg.code.sf.net/p/frontaccounting/mercurial frontaccounting-mercurial}}\n\nIt appeared to work using:\\\\\nProject - frontaccounting\\\\\nMount - mercurial\\\\\nand using mercurial as the type\\\\\nbut not sure if this is going to fail later in life ?! How important is the error?\n\nBeing no pro at this, I&#x27;m a little disappointed by the lack of help, explanations or examples ... indeed the error itself is vastly unhelpful !!\n\nSadly, so much for simplicity, tried the above format for SuiteCRM\n\n{code}\ngit clone git://git.code.sf.net/p/suitecrm/code suitecrm-code\n{code}\n\nusing project \"suitecrm\"  Mount \"code\", but despite the HTTP looking just like the Sourceforge example it refused to find the project and ignoring the error created another dead and undeleteable project.\n\nUsed the GIT import and it worked fine ... apart from the project is showing as empty?!\n\nWhat am I doing wrong with the SuiteCRM import! help, frustrated!!\\\\\ncheers\\\\\nRichard",
