[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSWSERVER-20269].  {panel}\r\n\r\nh3. Problem Definition\r\nWhen you are on an active sprint page of a board, and you need to remove an item from that sprint, you can right-click on the card and see an option to \"Remove from Sprint\".   The problem here is that the user doesn't have any clear choice about where to place that issue, such as into the backlog, or select a specific upcoming sprint instead.\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\nIt would be great if the user was prompted to select an option such as\r\n* Backlog\r\n* future planed sprint #1\r\n* future planed sprint #2\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Why this is important\r\nGives scrum masters / sprint admins much more control over where issues end up.  Also it would help with the consistency in Jira Software. For example, when closing a sprint, you are prompted where to place those incomplete issues, a feature implemented by JSWCLOUD-6421\r\n\r\nh3. Note\r\nIf no future sprints exist at the time this issue is to be removed from the board, then the board will place that issue in the backlog.  ",

Summary\r\n\r\nCurrently, for Jira Software you have a predefined set of possible [Swimlanes|https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirasoftwarecloud/configuring-swimlanes-764478010.html] you can have on your Board.\r\n\r\nThis includes *Epics* and *Stories* which are both parents like fields with child issues. However, the *Parent Link* field which is only active by having Portfolio enabled, isn't part of this list.\r\n\r\nFor some users, the Epic or Story level isn't sufficient and custom levels higher above are used thanks to Portfolio's hierarchy configuration. Because the *Parent Link* isn't taking into account, *Swimlanes* can't be grouped on this level unless you make it query base which can be very manual work.\r\n\r\nh3.

Similarly, an issue is considered to be 'Done' when it is in a status that has been mapped to the right-most column of your board.{quote}\r\n\r\nThat means that it should consider on the report only those issues whose status is mapped in any of the active columns.

One thing that I absolutely despise while using it is the auto-rendering \"feature\" (giant quotes required) when using Wiki Markup or Markdown in a comment RTF field.\r\n\r\nPlease, please, please provide the following options when using a markup language in RTF fields:\r\n\r\n1. DO add a text mode for use with markup languages.\r\n2. DO allow text mode editing in a markup language when editing an existing comment.\r\n3. DO NOT auto-render any text in text mode until the editing session ends.\r\n\r\nI understand why some users like WYSIWYG fields, but plenty of users prefer to edit and compose in markup languages.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n",
