Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Setup your Azure AD to prevent users from providing consent to apps accessing company data on their behalf.\r\n # Only allow admins to approve the mailbox connection request using steps listed here: [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/configure-admin-consent-workflow]\r\n # Try to connect a mailbox that only has a mailbox license\r\n # Global admin gets the approval request that gets approved by the global admin\r\n # After approval try to connect the mailbox to Jira again\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nAfter the admin's approval, the mailbox can now be connected to Jira\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nThe user again received the same message to request permission to global admin to access the mailbox data\r\nh3. Notes\r\n\r\nThe only scenario where it works is when the mailbox you are connecting is a global admin who has the permission to approve these requests as well\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nSet up automatic forwarding from your Microsoft inbox to your Jira Service Management project's built-in email address, ending in {{@<site name>.atlassian.net}}.

E, com base em minha experi\u00eancia, pontuei uma necessidade de dia a dia utilizando a plataforma de voc\u00eas pela vis\u00e3o de Product Meneger. Espero que gostem e aproveitem para me ajudar com essa feature :) Obrigada!\r\nSegue:\r\n1. Purpose of document\r\n O documento a seguir aborda a inexist\u00eancia da m\u00e9trica de Story Points na feature Dashboard do produto Jira, como um problema de experi\u00eancia do cliente.Prop\u00f5e como solu\u00e7\u00e3o e melhoria, a inclus\u00e3o de um de/para no componente Story Points do card de atividades do usu\u00e1rio. Que possibilitar\u00e1 ao usu\u00e1rio a atribui\u00e7\u00e3o de escalas de complexidade para cada atividade, sendo posteriormente refletidas como dimens\u00f5es no Dashboard, como desejado.\r\n2. Tenets/guidelines/background\r\nO Jira \u00e9 uma software comercial que permite o monitoramento de tarefas e acompanhamento de projetos, garantindo o gerenciamento de diversas atividades de uma equipe em \u00fanico lugar. Essa ferramenta \u00e9 utilizada por um grande cliente, para a gest\u00e3o de atividades de seus times.Uma das funcionalidades do Jira, \u00e9 acomodar informa\u00e7\u00f5es relevantes de uma atividade em seus cards, como a informa\u00e7\u00e3o de Story Points.\u00a0O\u00a0 cliente utiliza Story Points para planejamento de atividades que ser\u00e3o inclu\u00eddas no roadmap da Sprint. Os pontos s\u00e3o atribu\u00eddos para mensurar a complexidade de atividades que est\u00e3o sendo realizadas em cada ciclo de trabalho.O Jira j\u00e1 oferece um campo texto em seus componentes para que o usu\u00e1rio atribua os Story Points em seus cards de atividades. Por\u00e9m, os Story Points n\u00e3o est\u00e3o contidos nas dimens\u00f5es disponibilizadas na feature de Dashboard do produto.A aus\u00eancia dessa dimens\u00e3o est\u00e1 prejudicando a experi\u00eancia do cliente para gerir a complexidade de atividades realizadas por seus times, de acordo com determinado espa\u00e7o de tempo.\r\n3. Details of the problem\r\n Na p\u00e1gina inicial do sistema Jira encontra-se a feature de Dashboard. A ferramenta possibilita a cria\u00e7\u00e3o de relat\u00f3rios de acompanhamento de atividades de usu\u00e1rios. A dimens\u00e3o Story Points ainda n\u00e3o se encontra habilitada como m\u00e9trica na ferramenta de Dashboard, impactando na usabilidade do cliente. \u00c9 importante mencionar que o componente Story Points \u00e9 um campo texto, que atualmente pode ser preenchido com caracteres alfanum\u00e9ricos.\u00a0O cliente tem relatado essa cr\u00edtica como um impeditivo de continuidade de usabilidade pela cia.\r\n4. Details of possible solutions Duas poss\u00edveis solu\u00e7\u00f5es foram mapeadas como iniciativas de melhoria para o sistema:*\u00a0 A inclus\u00e3o de uma flag no card de issues, que possibilite ao usu\u00e1rio selecionar se aquele Story Point deve ou n\u00e3o compor as m\u00e9tricas de acompanhamento. Caso positivo, o usu\u00e1rio necessariamente dever\u00e1 atribuir caracteres num\u00e9ricos.*\u00a0 A cria\u00e7\u00e3o de tabelas de de/para, onde os usu\u00e1rios atribuiriam pesos para cada Story Point informado. Possibilitando a inclus\u00e3o de todos os tipos de Story Points no Dashboard.\r\n\r\n5. Recommended solution\r\n A solu\u00e7\u00e3o recomendada \u00e9 a cria\u00e7\u00e3o de caixas de de/para, onde os usu\u00e1rios atribuir\u00e3o pesos para cada Story Point. Essa solu\u00e7\u00e3o atingir\u00e1 todos os clientes, possibilitando que seus Story Points sejam inseridos como m\u00e9tricas no Dashboard. Os clientes relataram que a fun\u00e7\u00e3o de de/para seria eficiente, pois possibilitaria a inser\u00e7\u00e3o da m\u00e9trica de Story Points em seus relat\u00f3rios com mensura\u00e7\u00e3o de complexidade de atividades. A solu\u00e7\u00e3o permitir\u00e1 que todos os clientes consigam mensurar a complexidade de atividades dos ciclos de trabalho de seus times. A primeira solu\u00e7\u00e3o n\u00e3o foi indicada, pois existem tamb\u00e9m conceitos alfanum\u00e9rico de atribui\u00e7\u00e3o de pesos \u00e0 atividades, n\u00e3o atendendo \u00e0 uma massa relevante de clientes que j\u00e1 utilizam o produto.\r\n6. Plan of action\r\nO plano de a\u00e7\u00e3o realizado nessa atividade foi:\r\nAlinhamento estrat\u00e9gico: Atribui\u00e7\u00e3o de objetivo e m\u00e9tricas de sucesso impactadas pelo contexto do problema.\u00a0\r\n\r\nLevantamento de oportunidades: Identifica\u00e7\u00e3o de demais dores dos usu\u00e1rios; Realiza\u00e7\u00e3o de entrevistas com stakeholders (tanto com o time de desenvolvimento, quanto com o cliente); realiza\u00e7\u00e3o de benchmarking para entender como est\u00e1 o mercado e as atuais necessidades desse tipo de cliente; valida\u00e7\u00e3o de persona e aplica\u00e7\u00e3o de t\u00e9cnica 5 Whys.\r\n\r\nPrioriza\u00e7\u00e3o de oportunidades: Medi\u00e7\u00e3o de impacto de cada oportunidade e prioriza\u00e7\u00e3o atrav\u00e9s do m\u00e9todo RICE; entrevista com o time de desenvolvimento para compreens\u00e3o de viabilidade e realiza\u00e7\u00e3o de an\u00e1lise de risco de cada solu\u00e7\u00e3o proposta.\u00a0\r\n\r\nLevantamento e valida\u00e7\u00e3o de solu\u00e7\u00f5es: Identifica\u00e7\u00e3o de poss\u00edveis solu\u00e7\u00f5es e valida\u00e7\u00e3o de hip\u00f3tese; prototipagem de solu\u00e7\u00f5es; teste de usabilidade e entrevista com grupo focal.",
