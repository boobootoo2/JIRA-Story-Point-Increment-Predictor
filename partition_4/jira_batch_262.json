It is important cause it influences the Burndown chart which is always in server timezone. \r\n\r\nRelated issue: https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/GHS-4872 \r\nInstead of introducing timezone selecting for Burndown chart (though it's better than nothing) I would strongly insist to just eliminate timezone for such charts and \"Log work\" feature because the March 29 is the same day for Japan, Europe or USA. And if someone worked for March 29 that means that everyone in the world should see that he/she worked for March 29. But now some people see work for March 28, some for March 29 and some for March 30 which is total absurd.\r\n\r\nAt least there should be an option to include feature such as \"Ignore timezones when logging work\". And therefore all charts should take into account such an option.\r\n\r\nI guess this issue could affect both Jira and Greenhopper",

Based on that the chart should give us the required story point burndown for each sprint. If a sprint is released the chart should show the how many story points we got in that sprint. I was not able to find that information within the release or chart board within GreenHopper. But this is a essential view for a Scrum project.\r\n\r\nEnclosed I have a example for you, see \"example.png\".\r\n\r\nThe only way I found with GreenHopper is the Statistic Burndown Chart with the Story Point field. But this uses days as perspective and not the sprints. therefore you are not able to see any relevant informations on it, see \"charts.png\".\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nDirk\r\n\r\n=> The screenshots can be found in: https://support.atlassian.com/browse/GHS-4237 - I do not want to make them public.",
