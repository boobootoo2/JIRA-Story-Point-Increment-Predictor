Steps to Reproduce\r\n * Create a Jira project (I used Kanban template for the reproduction)\r\n * Create about 10 issues in the backlog\r\n * From board settings, in the card layout config, add upto 3 fields to be displayed in the backlog issues\r\n * Go back to the backlog, drag and drop the last issue order to 1 or multiple issues up\r\n\r\nh3.

Actual Results\r\n\r\nThe screen scroll position is altered each time an issue is dragged and dropped in the project backlog.\r\nh3.

Setting up a condition on those transitions hides it from the issue view but not from the \"view workflow\" pop-up.\r\nSimilarly, one of my workflows has a \"pending\" status which allows all statuses to transition. It also features a backward transition to each 5 other statuses of the workflow, each one of them with a condition so that it is only accessible if the previous status was the one previous to \"pending\".\r\nAll those transitions are actually accessible to the users but you can agree that they cluter the view a lot and it will be all more clear if they were hidden from the view workflow.\r\n\r\nThanks for consideration.",

While Structure does a great job of preserving this, in their session, there is no way to save the column widths, either in a saved view or in the \"perspective view\", from the Share button. Our users would like to share these adjusted column widths with other members of their team.{color}\r\n\r\n{color:#292c33}{color:#292c33}The current justification against it is: \"because you can have different monitors and different window sizes, and Structure tries to autosize width for your window.\" {color}\r\n{color:#292c33}This is no longer valid. The reasons that this is not valid are outlined here: {color}\r\n{color:#292c33}The reason that column widths should be saved to views and perspectives is that structure's auto-widths are often not appropriate, and must be re-sized. Your previous justification *used* to be valid, because with no horizontal scrolling, Structure had to auto-size the widths for each window so that the user could always see all of the columns. {color}\r\n{color:#292c33}However, it is now possible to horizontally scroll, so for any window size, the user will always be able to scroll to see every column in the view. {color}\r\n{color:#292c33}The current result of the fact that column widths are not saveable is that every user, on their first time using a view in structure, and on their first time seeing a display of a structure in the view in Confluence, must be shown how to re-size column widths, and then re-size each column so that it is of the optimum width. Examples of width changes: {color}\r\n{color:#292c33}1) Making the Comments (Notes) column extra wide. {color}\r\n{color:#292c33}2) Making a column that is there so that an issue field is editable, but does not have to be seen, extra narrow. {color}\r\n{color:#292c33}3) Making certain columns narrower so that the information can still be seen, but the amount of horizontal scrolling a user has to do is minimised. {color}\r\n{color:#292c33}Extra steps such as this for *every user* make using Structure less favourable, leading employees to prefer other tools / methods. {color}\r\n{color:#292c33}Doing this once, then saving the widths to the view, would be fantastic \uf04a {color}\r\n{color:#292c33}Therefore, please implement this suggestion. Structure has many excellent features and I would like for other employees to come on-board! {color}{color}",
