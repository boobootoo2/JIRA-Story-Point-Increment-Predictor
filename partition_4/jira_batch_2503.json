What was good about Bitbucket, however, is that it was NOT that Atlasssian commercial issue tracker, and this was what most people liked. The previous layout with the project menu at the top, but not on the left, was perfect for navigation. Now what you basically did is made the user experience worse as now we (users) have to perform more actions to use that one, as well as there are now 3 menus (left, top and top right) which are located in different parts of the screen.\n\nI know that as you have already made this change, it would be pretty unlikely to get the previous UI back, however, please at least think about that, as what you have done simply sucks compared to what we had before.",

I am finding that about 1/3 of the time _both_ of the webhooks fail to trigger on commits to be repo.  It&#x27;s always either neither or both, never just one.\n\nIt never seems to fail twice in a row, but it rarely works twice in a row.  Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t provide any additional information; I obviously don&#x27;t have logs for either bitbucket or hipchat.  Since both are Atlassian products, hopefully it should be easy to verify and track down the problem.\n\nAn example commit would be b1d16af459092d0ee2428b8bc9680c7a40ec2dbb, which I pushed about 30m ago, and which never showed up in Hipchat or Codeship.  However 686c2d19a27656b0a4b6873b4a359330fb0929c7 from yesterday did work.\n\nUnfortunately, this issue is causing major issues as the hooks are major part of our deployment pipeline.",

      "description": "Smart commits is an excellent feature to link BitBucket commits - and the code changes - to JIRA issues. However, if a user forgets to add the issue key to the commit and then pushes upstream, it&#x27;s very hard (without breaking the git repo for others) to add the issue key to the commit message. It would therefore be very useful to be able to manually link an earlier commit - and its code - to an existing JIRA issue, as if the issue key had been included in the commit message.\n\nThe commit message doesn&#x27;t need to be changed, but the code changes and commit ID should be added to the issue.\n\nThis could be done with a separate UI to attach JIRA issues to an existing commit. When displaying JIRA issues, in addition to searching in the commit message, it would also search the new JIRA-issue-and-commit association configured via the new UI.\n\nThe same thing could be applied to branches. Pull requests might be fine, as we could easily update the pull request title to include the issue key.",

Dear Andreas,\n\nThanks for your interest in Zenodo. We do not currently have plans on integrating BitBucket, however it&#x27;s definitely something we are open for.\n\nBitBucket APIs is nevertheless missing some key features to make the integration as nice as with GitHub. First, BitBucket allows a user to manually add a hook, but does not have an API for adding hooks (note, hooks are the way Zenodo would get notified about new releases in BitBucket). This means that we can&#x27;t make a solution where a user signs in with their BitBucket account in Zenodo, and flip a switch to start preserving their repository. The user would manually have to add copy/paste a URL from Zenodo to BitBucket. Secondly, we only preserve \"releases\" in GitHub, and currently BitBucket does not have this concept (this is less of an issue though).\n\nBest regards,\\\\\nLars",
