Actual Results\r\nNotification for *Request Resolved* is not sent to the customer. Customer still receive the notification for *Customer-visible status changed*.\r\n\r\n(i) This happens only if the *Resolution* is the same as the default (in this case *Done*) set in post-function. If the *Resolution* in the screen is set to non-default (for example, *Won't Do*), the *Request Resolved* notification will be send to the customer. Another observation is that in this case, there will be no issue history that set the Resolution.\r\n\r\nh3.

Issue Summary\r\n\r\nWhen integrating Service Desk Server with a *Confluence Cloud Space* to serve customers with a knowledge base, the customers are required to be logged in to Confluence Cloud for the Integration to work seamlessly.\u00a0\r\n\r\nWhen the customer is not logged in, instead of displaying the KB article or the log in screen in the customer portal in an iFrame, the following will happen:\r\n - in Chrome, a grey page will show in the iFrame. There is a link available on the page which allows the user to open the page in a new window, so that they can log into Confluence Cloud. However, this link is very small and can be easily missed:\r\n{code:java}\r\nOpen Site in New Window\r\n{code}\r\n\r\n - in Firefox, the following message will appear in the iFrame:\r\n{code:java}\r\nFirefox can't open this page.\r\nOpen Site in New Window\r\n{code}\r\n\r\n - in Safari: The issue is not present, however Safari opens each KB article in a new tab instead of the iframe\r\n\r\nh3. Notes\r\n - This issue only impacts the integration between Service Desk Server and *Confluence Cloud*\r\n -- This issue does not impact the integration between Service Desk Server and *Confluence Server*\r\n - The integration between Service Desk Server and Confluence Cloud *is only available in Service Desk Server version 4.12.0* and above.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to replicate\r\n - Setup a Confluence Cloud without anonymous access on the whole instance (so that users have to login to access any Confluence page)\r\n - Create a space in Confluence Cloud, and will be used as a Knowledge Base space, and add at least one page to that space\r\n - Setup Service Desk Server on any version from 4.12.0 or above\r\n - Create a Service Desk project, and configure it with a Knowledge Base coming from Confluence Cloud, as per [Set up a knowledge base with Confluence Cloud|https://confluence.atlassian.com/servicemanagementserver/set-up-a-knowledge-base-with-confluence-cloud-1018775526.html]\r\n - Log into the Customer Portal, with a *user who is not already logged in into Confluence Cloud*\r\n - Search for a KB article from Confluence Cloud, in the Customer portal. You should be shown some result:\r\n !Bug_Step1.png|thumbnail!\r\n - Click on the KB article to open it in an iFrame\r\n\r\nh3. Expected results\r\n\r\nThe KB article or the log in screen should be displayed in an iFrame:\r\n !Bug_ExpectedResults.png|thumbnail!\r\nh3. Actual results\r\n - In Chrome, a grey page will show in the iFrame (along with a very small link at the bottom of the page that can be used to open the page in a new window). Also, the following error will be displayed in the browser console:\r\n{code:java}\r\nRefused to display 'https://id.atlassian.com/' in a frame because it set 'X-Frame-Options' to 'sameorigin'.\r\n{code}\r\n!Bug_Step2_Chrome.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\n - in Firefox, the following message will appear in the iFrame:\r\n{code:java}\r\nFirefox can't open this page.\r\nOpen Site in New Window\r\n{code}\r\n!Bug_Step2_Firefox.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nh3. Workarounds\r\nh4. Workaround 1\r\n\r\n*Firefox*: Click on the button displayed in the place of the article and log in to Confluence in another tab. Then you can go back to the Customer Portal and view all the articles you have access to.\r\n\r\n*Chrome*, *Firefox* and *other* browsers: Click on the \"View article in new window\" link that is displayed below where the article should be.\r\n\r\n!Bug_ExpectedResults_highlighted.png|width=519,height=254!\r\nh4. Workaround 2\r\n\r\nConfigure the Confluence Cloud instance with anonymous access, as per [Setting Up Public Access|https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/setting-up-public-access-156.html].\r\n !Workaround_Step1.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nIn addition to this, also configure the Confluence Cloud KB Space with anonymous access:\r\n !Workaround_Step2.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nWith such configuration, Service Desk customers will no longer have to be logged into Confluence Cloud to view any KB article, and the KB article will be displayed in the iFrame.\r\n\r\n*Please note*, that individual page trees and pages in Confluence can be configured to follow different permission restriction, and not be available to the anonymous users together with the KB articles that are.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\nh3. Suggestions for this feature request\r\n\r\nNote that this ticket is raised as a feature request, since the current behavior *is expected by design*, and is explained in the documentation\u00a0[Set up a knowledge base with Confluence Cloud|https://confluence.atlassian.com/servicemanagementserver/set-up-a-knowledge-base-with-confluence-cloud-1018775526.html]. \r\n However, this current behavior may cause a lot of confusion for the end user, since end users might not be aware that they are supposed to be logged into Confluence Cloud prior to opening any KB article.\r\n\r\nAlso, when using Chrome, all the user sees is a gray page with a very small link at the bottom, giving the option to open the page in a new window, which is not very user friendly.\r\n\r\nSome improvement suggestions are the following:\r\n - make the link \"Open Site in New Window\" bigger or more visible to the end user, so that it's more obvious to them that they need to open the page in a new window to log into Confluence?\r\n - or maybe add a big banner/warning telling the customers that they need to log into Confluence in a new window?",

Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Have an Object Type with a text attribute added to it, e.g. \"TestAtt\", and any other attribute (e.g. a User, Boolean etc)\r\n # Populate this Attribute across you objects in this object type\r\n # In the Object Type>Attributes Tab, set \"TestAtt\" as the Object Type's Label\r\n # Navigate to any Object Page, the \"Name\" is clearly showing in the Attributes Tab\r\n # Navigate to ObjectType>Configure>Configure page layout\r\n # In the Page Layout screen>Attributes Tab, see that \"Name\" is not showing in the List of Attributes to display.\r\n # Remove one Attribute from the list (e.g. the Boolean Attribute), or simply click to Clear All, then try to add the Name Attribute only.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nYou can find the Name Attribute from the Attribute Picker, and be able to select it to be displayed on the object page\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nThe Name Attribute cannot be selected here, and it will not show on the Object Page\r\n{noformat}\r\n...\r\n{noformat}\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nIn the Attribute Picker - click the option to Add All - in order to show ALL available attributes, including the one called Name (Key, Updated and Created will still be excluded as these will be displayed regardless on the object page itself)\r\n\r\nNote that unless you choose to Select All, you will not be able to see the Name Attribute, for example, click Select All, then remove one attribute from the list - the Name will no longer show on the page...\r\n\r\n\u00a0",

Issue Summary\r\n\r\nWe wish to import objects from CSV, and if the identifier is not matched - we expect the Import to create new objects in Insight.\r\n\r\nWe have identified a reproducible use case where the identified should miss and create new objects, but instead it updates an existing object\r\n\r\nInsight 8.7.4\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # create two object types: OTX and OTY\r\n # Configure Attributes so that OTX has two attributes (AttA, AttB), both are references to OTY (Cardinality 0-1) - you can add more attributes as you like.\r\n # Create two objects in OTY, call them OY1 and OY2\r\n # Create one object in OTX, call it OX1 and set the References: AttA=OY1 ; AttB=OY2\r\n # create a CSV with 3 columns, and the following values:\r\n Name,Col1,Col2\r\n OX1,OY1,OY1\r\n # Configure a CSV Import to with an OTX Object Type Map, map each Attribute accordingly, and +check all these 3 attributes to be identifiers+:\r\n Name>>>Name\r\n Col1>>>AttA\u00a0\u00a0 \u2014 IQL: Name=${Col1}\r\n Col2>>>AttB \u00a0 \u2014 IQL: Name=${Col2}\r\n # Synchronize the CSV import\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nAs the Identifier misses, there will be a new object created in OTX:\r\n Name: OX1\r\n AttA: ref to OY1\r\n\r\nAttB: ref to OY1\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nThe existing object gets updated\r\n\r\nThis behavior does not happen if Col1 != Col2\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nAs a possible workaround - you may create a Text Attribute (hidden) to which you can map all three Datalocators - and make this Attribute your identifier, as it will contain the unique combination of the 3 values, and will not use the Reference Attributes.\r\n\r\n\u00a0",
