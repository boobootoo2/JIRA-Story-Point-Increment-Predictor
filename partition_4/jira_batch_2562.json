B or even malaria are under control. This is particularly due to the fact the particular tumor comes in huge variety of forms and various cases are simply just slightly associated with the typical concept of the typical technique of out of control tissue development.\\\\\nThis variety of diverse cancer cases signifies that doctors should implement very different engineering any time treating various circumstances. The general number of distinct surgery methods as well as drugs carried out cure cancer is very considerable because of large number of strategies selected in various cases. Though the very basic idea of treatments identity very easy - to apply a number of treatment which will be in a position to remove destructive cells and make restricted damage to usual tissues. Amongst the some other techniques intended to implement this simple technique radiotherapy has particular location. Without a doubt this clearly boasts undeniable benefits within the chemotherapy and also surgery. In cases whenever therapy is not really theoretically achievable with surgical techniques or perhaps is going to be really harmful if chemo is actually applied radiotherapy might provide required results.In every single case of radiotherapy presently there is actually one single concern which establishes the actual way of treatment implementation towards the severe level. This really is risk associated with bad influence regarding radioactive emission on the affected person. This concern is framing a couple of innovative approaches carried out to cancer treatment. The first is classical radiotherapy that generally means exposing patient to centered beams associated with engine performance. This is at present implemented through advanced techniques meant to lessen the general direct exposure associated with healthy issues towards the emission. One of the most fascinating concepts utilized to get to the objective is developing a machine which emits strictly controlled levels of the radiation coming from various directions that enables rays to intersect on one hot spot providing awesome affect to that point and no associated damage to the particular healthy tissues. It is extremely evident that accurate focusing on and sophisticated treatments for the positioning of individual is crucial for efficient performing of this technique. For this reason the entire process is most commonly performed by large devices along with high tech control methods. The perfect illustration of this kind of will be Trubeam device intended for radiotherapy administering.\\\\\nAn additional method of dispensing exhaust towards the cancer location is based on managed insertion regarding restricted quantity of energetic capsule which contains some radioactive materials. This technique is called brachytherapy. Due that such elements are usually positioned specifically near the growth overall unfavorable impact on individual wellness is actually decreased to be able to minimum stage that allows achieving good results in short time. This particular advantage is quite essential since interpersonal effects of prolonged and harmful therapy is extremely severe and have negative effect on quality regarding patient\u2019s existence.

My problem is that I want to provide the reviewers a way to access a private repository on bitbucket, without making the repository public before publication and without knowing their identity.\n\nAll the scripts and datasets used in the analysis described in the paper are available as a hg repository on mercurial. Since it contains datasets that must remain private until the manuscript is accepted, the repository is private and its access is restricted. I plan to set the repository as public after publication; but if I cannot do it now, as I need to prove that the data submitted is novel.\n\nThe problem is that if I keep the repository private, the reviewers will not be able to check it. I can not grant them access to a private repo, because I can now know their names.\n\nSo, I am asking if there is an official way to provide a temporary access link to a private repo. I can create a new bitbucket account, provide it access to the repository, and provide the access information to the reviewers... but I am not sure if that would break your Terms of Usage.",

Now, we both cannot view my comment anymore in the web interface. In the commits overview, there is this little bubble indicating that a comment has been posted to the commit. After clicking on it, we both just get to the commit page and see\n\nComments\n\nAdd comment \u00bb\n\n-- my comment should appear inbetween these two lines, right? It is somehow gone.
