In order to keep these feature branches \"fresh\", we occasionally will do a pull request *from* the master branch into the feature branch.  In these cases we have sometimes observed that the DVCS auto-transition incorrectly transitions \"in progress\" issues that were noted in commits on *master* (and that we're previously merged in via PR, but still have additional work or merges in order to complete, hence they are still \"in progress\") to review, as well as any issue keys for commits on the feature branch, including from merge commits from master.\n\nAt the very least, it would be nice if in this scenario, the issue keys in the merge commits were ignored rather than auto transitioning all issues as it has caused some confusion among our developers.\n\nSome more specifics on what we observed can be found in [this service desk case|https://support.atlassian.com/servicedesk/customer/portal/23/JST-117861]\n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions or need more clarification about what we're looking for.\n\nThanks!",

Your feedback is key to helping us understand how you use JIRA so we can continue improving your experience. We have reviewed this issue over the last few days; and unfortunately at the moment there aren't any plans to implement this suggestion in the next 6 months. While we think this is a great suggestion is would require a complex technical solution that would be difficult for us to implement at this time.\n\nPlease remember that jira.atlassian.com is one of many inputs for the JIRA roadmap. You can [learn more about our process here|https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/110373/how-does-the-jira-team-use-jira-atlassian-com].\n\nI understand that our decision may be disappointing. Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.\n\nRegards,\nMegan Cook\nmcook@atlassian.com\nAtlassian Product Manager\n{panel}\n\n*Original request description:*\nSmart commits is an excellent feature to link BitBucket commits - and the code changes - to JIRA issues. However, if a user forgets to add the issue key to the commit and then pushes upstream, it's very hard (without breaking the git repo for others) to add the issue key to the commit message. It would therefore be very useful to be able to manually link an earlier commit - and its code - to an existing JIRA issue, as if the issue key had been included in the commit message.\n\nThe commit message doesn't need to be changed, but the code changes and commit ID should be added to the issue.",
