      "description": "As referenced in JSP-79461 and BAM-10379 , I have an automated script which retrieves artifacts from Bamboo via wget for use in other Bamboo plans.  This page-scraping script is a hacky kludge to get around Bamboo's lack of an RSS feed for a plan's artifacts.\r\n\r\nWith the release of 4.0.1, a change was introduced in the Bamboo plan artifact page which broke this script.  There is now a snippet of HTML code which reads:\r\n\r\n    <div id=\"sr-build\" class=\"Successful\">\r\n        <h2>\r\n<span class=\"icon icon-Successful\"></span>            <span class=\"assistive\">Build:</span>\r\n            <a href=\"/bamboo/browse/PROJECT-PLAN-1234\">#1234</a>\r\n            <span>was successful </span>\r\n        </h2>\r\n    </div>\r\n\r\nwget saves this as a regular file at 'bamboo/browse/PROJECT-PLAN-1234'\r\n\r\nLater in the page, the individual artifacts are referenced, eg:\r\n\r\n                        <td>\r\n<span class=\"icon icon-artifact-shared\"></span>                                <a href=\"/bamboo/browse/PROJECT-PLAN-1234/artifact/shared/share-name/artifact.file\">share-name</a>\r\n                        </td>\r\n\r\nwget attempts to create the directories 'bamboo/browse/PROJECT-PLAN-1234/artifact/shared/share-name', but fails due to a previously-created file matching one of the parent directories, 'bamboo/browse/PROJECT-PLAN-1234'.  This makes the fetch of the artifacts fail, stopping our other bamboo plans which depend on having the artifacts to play with.\r\n\r\nPlease restore the trailing '/' to the link beneath 'Build was successful' as per previous versions.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

( http://build.tdar.org/bamboo/allPlans.action )\r\n\r\nA proposed solution:\r\n - enable a configuration to list branches on the dashboard\r\n - leverage metadata about branches (open/closed status in tools like Mercurial, frequency of build, date of last checkin) to determine what branches to show and what branches to hide.\r\n\r\nI recognize that some projects have hundreds of branches, and tens of projects, but I think that our case is not uncommon.",
