Expected Results\r\n\r\nTab focus should consistently cycle through the issue screen options and browser control elements by pressing the 'tab' key the same number of times.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nTab focus disappears after \"Jira Service Desk\" logo goes in focus, and then seemingly disappears.\r\nI.e. user hits 'tab' - nothing happens, 'tab' again - nothing. And then after clicking 'tab' multiple times, the focus comes back.\r\n\r\nThe following HTML elements are added to the page HTML every time an action such as saving a comment is added:\r\n\r\n{code}\r\n<div class=\"attach-screenshot-paste-catcher\" contenteditable=\"true\"></div>\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nThis is the element where 'tab focus' goes to. Since the element is multipled every time a comment is made or action is done, next time user cycles through the option, it needs extra 'tab' to get the focus back.\r\nWhile the elements can't be seen on the screen, it's there in the HTML and is where the 'tab' focus goes.\r\n\r\nh3.

Issue Summary\r\nAs an Agent, when editing a Customer's comment, agent can click on 'Share with customer' to save the changes and make the comment Public, as it originally is. However, the saved comment will be saved as Internal, hence not visible in the Customer Portal.\r\n\r\nThis has been observed in JSD 4.7.0 & 4.7.1.\r\n*Bug started in 4.5.4 (8.5.4)*\r\n\r\n*Note:* This doesn't affect Agents' Public comments\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n(i) Use a Service Desk project with default Permission Scheme, specifically the *Browse project* permission\r\n# As a Customer, leave a comment in a Request via Customer Portal\r\n# As an Agent, access the Request via Jira\r\n# Edit the Customer's comment and click 'Share with customer'\r\n# The saved comment will be Internal, not Public\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nClicking 'Share with customer' will save the comment and share to Public\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nSaved comment is Internal\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\nGranting the Customers the *Browse projects* permission, (on top of the default 'Service desk customer - portal access'). This can be granted via single user, roles or groups. Once granted, Customers' comments can be edited and shared publicly by Agents as usual. \r\n{panel:borderStyle=solid|borderColor=#000000|bgColor=#FFF4D1}\r\n(!) Doing so will grant the Customers permissions to access the Project via Jira and see all the Issues should they have Application Access. If they don't, this Workaround should work similarly like Service Desk as expected.\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\nIf the Workaround is applied and the Customers have Application Access, it is possible to restrict the Tickets to only the Reporters and Assignee via Issue Security Scheme. Below are the suggested actions to take:\r\n{panel}\r\n# Go to *Administration > Issues > Issue Security Scheme*. Click 'Add issue security scheme'.\r\n# In the newly added Issue Security Scheme, click 'Security Levels'. Add a Security Level (e.g.: Level 1).\r\n# In the newly added Security Level, click 'Default'\r\n** This is to set this Security Level as the default when Requests are created in Projects using this Issue Security Scheme\r\n# Then click 'Add'. Add 'Reporter' and 'Project Role: Service Desk Team' into the Security Level.\r\n** This would mean only the Reporter and members of Service Desk Team Project Role would be able to access Requests restricted with this Security Level\r\n# Go to the Service Desk Project, *Project Settings > Issue Security*. Click 'Actions > Select a scheme', then choose the created Issue Security Level.\r\n\r\nNow newly created Requests would only be accessible by the Reporter and Service Desk Team Project Role (Agents) despite being shared to the Organization.\r\n{panel}",

There are at least a couple ways we can do this:\r\n * We could communicate this with more precise wording (e.g., \"Delete email requests\")\u00a0\r\n * We could provide additional information (e.g., in a pop-up) that alerts them to the fact that their settings will be unalterably removed\r\n * Additionally, this should be documented, so users can verify the behaviour before committing to deleting their settings.",

Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nOptions to create or not to create the space.\r\nh3. Why this is important\r\n\r\nSometimes the JIRA Service Desk not required to have a knowledge base , so creating a space is not required.\r\nh3.

You can refer to [*this documentation*|https://confluence.atlassian.com/applinks/oauth-security-for-application-links-774045732.html] on the differences between OAuth and OAuth Impersonation. Using the bug as a workaround will causing you unable to create new space in Confluence from JIRA. If the project admin is able to access to Confluence to create new space and update Service Desk Project KB configuration to space manually, then OAuth shall be workable in this scenario.",

Issue Summary\r\n\r\nCurrently, the customer lookup handling in Service Desk has the following constraints by design:\r\n * Customers can be only searchable in the Customer portal if they are members of the Customers list.\r\n * There are additional conditions that need to be fulfilled, based on the \"Customer permissions\" settings:\r\n ** A reporter will only be able to search for users who are members of the same organization, if \"Other customers in their organization\" is set.\r\n ** If you want to grant permission to a reporter to browse through all users who are on the customer list, you need to select \"Any customer or organization, by searching in this project\". (see attached screenshot)\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this feature request is to allow the customers to see other users from the portal (in User Picker fields for example) that are not necessarily customers and without modifying the permissions in the project's \"Customer permissions\".\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n * Created a custom field \"User Picker\" filtered for\u00a0jira-servicedesk-users group and added it to my IT help Request Type portal.\r\n !Screen Shot 2020-01-14 at 5.25.58 PM.png|width=137,height=100!\r\n\r\n * Created some users, only user2 is added to service desk customers group\r\n !Screen Shot 2020-01-14 at 5.28.51 PM.png|width=144,height=72!\r\n\r\n * Set the customer permission in my project to \"Customers who are added to the project\"\r\n !Screen Shot 2020-01-14 at 5.30.34 PM.png|width=132,height=65!\r\n\r\n * Added user1 manually to the list of customers in my project to have at least two customers:\r\n !Screen Shot 2020-01-14 at 5.31.56 PM.png|width=215,height=78!\r\n\r\n * Log in as user1, try to create a request and add users to the User Picker field.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nuser1 should be able to search for the other users from the portal regardless of the project's \"customer permissions\" i.g there should be an option to set who is visible from the portal.\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n * Tried to create a request as user1, in the user picker field, it only suggests user2 from the list of users (I am also able to search the admin, but not the other users)\r\n !Screen Shot 2020-01-14 at 5.32.34 PM.png|width=207,height=141!\r\n * Changed the permission in my project to allow Customers who have an account on this Jira site to open requests. Now I have the other users as customers in my project.

Workaround\r\n\r\nFor now, the workaround is to loosen the permission to enable \"Customers who have an account on this Jira site\" to raise requests so that they are considered as customers and will show in the User Picker field in the portal, and use third-party plugins to restrict the creation of the requests for a restricted group.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nh3.

Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n- Setup 2 Confluence instances\r\n-- The first one will be referred to as \"Confluence\"\r\n-- The second one will be referred to as \"Confluence 2\"\r\n- Create a new space in \"Confluence 2\", and create a page containing the word \"laptop\"\r\n- Setup 1 Jira instance\r\n- Configure 2 application links in Jira, 1 to each Confluence instance, with the application link to \"Confluence\" set to the primary one:\r\n !AppLink.png|thumbnail! \r\n- Create a Service Desk project in Jira, and configure there a knowledge base using the space coming from \"Confluence 2\"\r\n !KnowledgeBaseSetting.png|thumbnail! \r\n- Go to the customer portal, select a request type, and start creating a new request\r\n- From the request creation page, type \"laptop\" in the summary field. The KB search should suggest the KB page from \"Confluence 2\"\r\n- Click on the KB article from the search result\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nThe KB page is not open, and the following error is thrown:\r\n{code}\r\nThe knowledge base article could not be found.\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nNote that if the \"Confluence\" instance is not reachable from Jira or not running, the following error will be thrown instead:\r\n{code}\r\nWe can't link to Confluence because of a problem with the metadata.

Workaround\r\n\r\nSet the application link corresponding to the Confluence instance where the KB is coming from as \"Primary\".\r\n(!)

      "description": "h3. Issue Summary\r\nSLAs count are unreadable when the instance is set in Slovak language and exceed one day\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # In a JSD project with SLAs set switch the Jira language to Slovak\r\n # Observe that all the issues with an SLA count which exceed 1 day are wrongly displayed. Specific it seems that since the translation in Slovak for the \"Count of weeks\" or \"Count of days\" which are translated into \"Po\u010det t\u00fd...\" or \"Po\u010det d...\" are too long and the result is that the sentence which should contains the Count of days + the actual number only show the Count of days (Po\u010det d...).\r\n\r\nWe tested that this was not happening in JSD 4.1.0 but instead is reproducible in version 4.2.4 and 4.4.2 where the structure of JSD jar language packs seems to be changed.\r\n\r\nWe in fact observed that before the \"Count of weeks\" or \"Count of days\" were not translated at all.\r\n\r\nLooking at the slovek language pack we see the following line related to the SLAs count:\r\n\r\n{code:java}\r\nsd.sla.duration.days.short=Po\\u010det dn\\u00ed: {0}\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nThe string is too long to be displayed in the SLA field, therefore it gets cut off.\r\n\r\nThe suspicion is that this is also happening to many other languages pack.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nThe expected result is that the SLA numbers are correctly displayed together with the reference (days or weeks) like in English as per this screenshot:\r\n\r\n !Screen Shot 2019-12-19 at 9.51.04 AM.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nInstead the sentence is cut off only reporting the \"Count of weeks\" or \"Count of days\" without the numbers which are the real useful information here:\r\n\r\n !Screen Shot 2019-12-19 at 9.50.49 AM.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\n(!) Workaround tested on Service Desk 4.5.1\r\n\r\n# Navigate to the link below to download the compatible OBR file for the current your JIRA version\r\n-- [https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1213632/jira-service-desk/version-history]\r\n# After downloaded, change the {{.obr}} filetype to {{.zip}} so it can be extracted.\r\n# Inside it, there will be another JAR file called {{jira-servicedesk-application-4.5.1.jar}}. (!) *Note that the name might change slightly depending on the Service Desk version that you are using*\r\n# Change the filetype from JAR to ZIP as well to make it extractable.\r\n# Unzip the file into a new temporary folder\r\n# Open the file {{translation-single-i18n_sk_SK.properties}} from the extracted folder\r\n# Locate the 2 following rows:\r\n{code}\r\nsd.sla.duration.days.short=Po\\u010det dn\\u00ed: {0}\r\nsd.sla.duration.weeks.short=Po\\u010det t\\u00fd\\u017ed\\u0148ov: {0}\r\n{code}\r\n# Replace these 2 rows with the following. (!) Note that in this case, we chose the safest solution which is to simply use the English translation \"d\" (for days), and \"w\" (for weeks) as we know it fits in the SLA display. But feel free to chance it to a different translation that suits you:\r\n{code}\r\nsd.sla.duration.days.short={0}d\r\nsd.sla.duration.weeks.short={0}w\r\n{code}\r\n# Save the file\r\n# Using the terminal, navigate to the directory where all the files were extracted from the original jar file\r\n# From inside the directory, run the following command:\r\n{code:java}jar cf jira-servicedesk-application-4.5.1.jar *{code}\r\n# The new Jar file jira-servicedesk-application-4.5.1.jar will be created (in the extracted folder) including the fixed translation\r\n# Go to the page *\u2699 > Manage Apps > Manage Apps*, and upload the new jar file using the Upload App button\r\n# (!) After the new Jar file is updated, the changes will only take effect after the browser cache is cleared. Another way to check if the translation is working is to either open the browser in Incognito mode, or by using a different browser. The number of days and weeks will be shown as \"d\" and \"w\"\r\n !AfterApplyingTheFix.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\n",

Steps to reproduce\r\n - Create a an SLA in a Service Desk project called \"Test SLA\", using the following settings:\r\n -- with \"Issue Created\" as the start condition\r\n -- with \"Status: Waiting for customer\", \"Status: Waiting for support\" as the pause condition\r\n -- any configuration for the stop condition\r\n !Step1.png|thumbnail!\r\n - Create a new ticket, assign it to any user and note that the \"Test SLA\" is paused. This is expected, since the SLA started when the issue got created, and got paused right after because it entered the status \"Waiting for support\"\r\n !Step2.png|thumbnail!\r\n - Modify the configuration of the \"Test SLA\" by replacing the start condition from \"Issue Created\" to \"Assignee: From Unassigned\":\r\n !Step3.png|thumbnail!\r\n - Go back to the issue, and note that now \"Test SLA\" is now running (after the SLA recalculation completed):\r\n !Step4.png|thumbnail!\r\n - Run the SLA reconstruction API call from [this KB article|https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirakb/missing-or-corrupted-sla-data-in-jira-service-desk-828790603.html] to force the SLA to be recalculated against the whole issue history, and notice that the SLA is still shown as running (the API call did not help):\r\n - Make any change to the ticket (for example, change the priority), and note that \"Test SLA\" is now paused. (!) Note that the SLA shows as 1h55min and not at 2h, meaning that the pause event was purely caused by the Priority change event and not by the \"Status: Waiting for support\" event:\r\n !Step5.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nh3. Expected results\r\n\r\nAfter the start condition of the SLA was updated, the SLA should have been recalculated for the ticket and show the correct SLA status, which should be \"Paused\", since the condition \"Status: Waiting for customer\" is one of the SLA pause conditions.\r\nh3. Actual results\r\n\r\nThe SLA shows as \"Running\", and can only be paused if any update is made to this issue, for example if the priority field is changed.\r\n In addition to this, the timing of the SLA gets incorrect after it's paused, as it's using the timing when the priority field was changed, rather than the timing of the actual condition that should have paused the issue (\"Status: Waiting for customer\").\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nNo workaround known so far.\r\n\r\nEven the\u00a0SLA reconstruction API call from [this KB article|https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirakb/missing-or-corrupted-sla-data-in-jira-service-desk-828790603.html]\u00a0 won't fix the SLA.",
