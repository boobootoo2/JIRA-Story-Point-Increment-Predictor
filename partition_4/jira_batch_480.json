We tried to re-apply our current Zephyr plugin license, which is still valid and an unlimited license.  However, we got an error saying this is an invalid license and cannot be used and the plugin would not work.  For now we have applied a trial license of Zephyr and the plugin is working. \r\n\r\nThis may just be a matter of renewing our purchased Zephyr license (expiring February 8th), but, our old license should work until then.\r\n\r\nCould you please give some guidance to resolve this issue?

But guess what - you've hardcoded it onto the page so I cannot remove it.\r\nHELP!

Summary\r\nThere is no feature to bulk edit the \"Request Participants\" of a JIRA Service Desk Issue. Instead, when users attempt to edit the field using Bulk Edit, they experience an error stating \"Bulk editing is not supported for Service Desk Request participants.\". When users need to change the \"Request participants\" of multiple issues, they need to do it manually one by one. \r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Search for some Service Desk Issues\r\n# Attempt to use the Bulk Edit > Edit feature\r\n# Observe that there is no way to update the \"Request Participants\" as it is listed as an \"Unavailable Action\"\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nThe ability to update the \"Request Participants\" field should be possible.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nNo such functionality exists in the product.\r\n\r\nh3. Workarounds\r\nA possible workaround could be to use the REST API, or SQL directly on the JIRA Database. Note that Atlassian does not support customers performing direct data manipulation of application databases via queries such as INSERT, UPDATE or DELETE, as they can easily lead to data integrity problems. If Atlassian encounters manipulation or customisations at this level, we may ask customers to restore data from their last known working state, or to engage an Expert to help recover their instance to a supportable state. If you are confident your UPDATE or INSERT is safe and your change management system is reliable, refer to the specific product's database documentation.",

To do this, go to User management > User directories.\r\n* When configuring who can authenticate to JIRA via Crowd, if you have customers that do not belong to groups, make sure you select the setting that allows all users in the directory to authenticate. See [Mapping a Directory to an Application|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/CROWD/Mapping+a+Directory+to+an+Application].\r\n\r\nFor more information, please read: [Managing customers|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/SERVICEDESK/Managing+customers#Managingcustomers-NotesonusingAtlassianCrowdtomanagecustomers]\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\n{panel:title=Crowd Licensing|borderColor=#ccc|titleBGColor=#cccccc|bgColor=#ebf2f9}\r\nAtlassian Crowd is a separate product and therefore if you wish to use Crowd for SSO, you will need to purchase a Crowd license that is large enough for your user base. Customers in JIRA Service Desk, while free in JIRA Service Desk, will consume a license in Crowd.\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\nWhen you enable [Crowd SSO for JIRA|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/CROWD/Integrating+Crowd+with+Atlassian+JIRA#IntegratingCrowdwithAtlassianJIRA-2.2ConfigureJIRAtouseCrowd'sAuthenticatortoenableSSO(Optional)], you will only be able to authenticate as users from the Crowd server and users from the internal JIRA directory can\u2019t authenticate to access JIRA. This means both paid JIRA users, agents and free JIRA Service Desk customers need to be users in Crowd. \r\n\r\nIt\u2019d be useful to create a new authenticator that knows about JIRA Service Desk Customers in the internal JIRA directory and authenticate them differently from JIRA users. \r\n\r\nSuch a change would require changes to Crowd, JIRA and JIRA Service Desk. There are currently no plans to undertake this work in the next 6-12 months. If you are interested in this feature, please watch, vote and add a comment with your specific use case.",

Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n# Set up a Service Desk Environment with more than 20 Customers. \r\n# Attempt to show the complete list of customers. \r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nThere should be a method to show the complete list of Service Desk Customers, Functionally, this could work similar to the *User Browser* in JIRA with both:\r\n* Pagination\r\n* \"Customers Per Page\" dropdown option.\r\n\r\nh3.
