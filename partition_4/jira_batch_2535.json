Sure, it&#x27;s not difficult but a page in the docs would save X number of devs explaining it to Y number of non-coders.\n\nThinking about it, even just a \"Bitbucket for non-technical users\" guide would be a great help - it could be a subset of the current docs and just walk people through what the different terms mean, what they will be interested in and what they don&#x27;t need to worry about.\n\nI know that non-coders are not exactly Bitbucket&#x27;s target market, but making it easier for them would be very useful to people like myself and I&#x27;m sure many others.",

I have a section titled \"content\" in the README which gets the ID \"content\" when it&#x27;s rendered, but the page already has a CSS rule for the ID \"content\". So my README&#x27;s \"content\" DIV gets the wrong rule applied to it and a bad rendering happens.\n\nA simple fix might be to prefix all the rendered IDs with some constant not used anywhere else, like \"document-section-*\" or something.",

The idea behind this being that a POST request is issued alerting the remote server/user/whatever that a change has been made to the repository.\n\nFor example, when I have a \"development\" branch that I merge into the \"master\" branch I would like to get a POST request that alerts me to a modification of my repo so I can take the appropriate actions. Currently I am only alerted when code is pushed to the repo. If I&#x27;m working in a development branch I would never push that same code to the master branch, I would simple merge the development branch into the master via a pull request.\n\nJust a little enhancement that would go a long way.\n\nThanks guys, keep up the great work!",

      "description": "I believe this changed when support for Git was added: the generated URLs that reference changesets use the full 40 character hexadecimal node ID.\n\nI understand that it&#x27;s nice to provide the full IDs: that way you don&#x27;t need to implement logic to handle collisions any better than the underlying tools, i.e., you don&#x27;t need to handle them on the assumption that SHA-1 is a secure hash function.\n\nHowever,\n\n* The long links are cumbersome: instead of a handy short node ID (12 characters for Mercurial) that will fit into most search boxes without clipping, I&#x27;m giving a 40 character string. That string is way to big for me to handle as anything but an opaque blob of bytes.\n\nWith a short node ID I can glance at it in an email and quickly see if it looks like it&#x27;s the same as the one shown in my browsers address bar. I can copy a small node ID by hand in full \u2014 with a long ID I need to decide when to give up and when my prefix is long enough. I can paste a short ID into most tools without it overflowing the input field. Overall short IDs are more convenient and handy.\n* The long links are almost always longer than what I&#x27;m comfortable pasting into text. The fixed text ({{https://bitbucket.org/.../.../commits/}}) take up 30 characters, so with 40 characters for the node ID we&#x27;re already at 70 and then you need to add the username and repository.\n\nThe result is a 80+ character link which flows very badly in a text file or an email. I end up with lines longer than 80 characters which means that my diffs display badly in a standard width terminal.\n* The long links are mostly unnecessary. There are no collisions in the 275k changesets in the OpenOffice repository among the first 10 hexadecimal characters \u2014 there is a single collision among the first 9 characters.\n\nThis means that short links will work well in practice for almost all repositories.\n* You should actually handle collisions anyway: today I can shorten the Bitbucket URLs and they still work:\n\n** https://bitbucket.org/mirror/mercurial-crew/commits/9fbeb61b8ad2\n** https://bitbucket.org/mirror/mercurial-crew/commits/9fbeb61b8\n** https://bitbucket.org/mirror/mercurial-crew/commits/9fbeb6\n\nHowever, I get a \"404 Not Found\" if the prefix becomes ambiguous:\n\n** https://bitbucket.org/mirror/mercurial-crew/commits/9fb\n\nThat ought to be handled better: present the user with a list of matching changesets",
