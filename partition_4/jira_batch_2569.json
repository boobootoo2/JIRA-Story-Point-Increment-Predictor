After learning of that, it occurred to me that this would be a very handy feature for bitbucket to offer.  Basically, \"mirror\" some off-site repository, with periodic \"hg pull\" from that off-site repository.  One might also want some way to examine the status (output) of the most recent \"hg pull\", in case the upstream parent changes location or goes away, etc.\n\nThanks for the great service!",

Optional.\n* module_name - a directory inside the repository. If this is set then the Jenkins build is only triggered if a file within that directory was changed in one of the commits in the changeset. Optional.\n\nI couldn&#x27;t see any documentation on whether or not brokers are allowed to be stateful, so I&#x27;ve written it as stateless with state kept in a data transfer object.

And I&#x27;m pushing via SSH. My Mercurial version is 1.6.3.\n\nI believe I&#x27;m sending all data in UTF-8.\n\nAs I said, this is not happening on all pages, only on some (not sure if there is a rule - it varies). Currently there are some changesets which I see as \"????\"s on dashboard page, but when open the corresponding changeset page, the log message inside is just fine. Moreover, at some point (say day or two), the commit messages start to appear normally.\n\nIs there something I can setup here at bitbucket site, or on my computer in order to solve this problem?\n\nThank you.",

      "description": "When we first switched to Mercurial from SVN, one of the things that bothered the project managers was the flexibly of the username field.  In our subversion workflow the field used to securely track where code had entered the database from.  In mercurial on the other hand, it was possible to push a malicious change ( a back door or something like that ) and make it appear to come from a different employee.\n\nTo solve this problem, I wrote a quick pretxnchangegroup hook that would look at each changeset and reject the push if it contained any changes that had a username different then the username that was authenticated to the server.\n\nBecause in our workflow we rarely push or pull among our selves this works pretty well. [ In a situation where we did share some change sets, we just take turns pushing incrementally. ]\n\nIt would be great if this kind of check could be turned on as an option in bitbucket.  It&#x27;s the one thing that&#x27;s preventing me from making a strong recommendation to scrap our slow hg server and move to bitbucket.\n\nAttached is our internal hook.  We only push over HTTP, so it doesn&#x27;t do user lookups based on key or anything like that.",

I can also list all repositories the user has write access to, but that includes all forks of their own repositories (which they may not care about) and omits all the repositories they&#x27;re following but that they only have read access to.\n\nBasically, I&#x27;m looking for an equivalent of http://github.com/api/v2/json/repos/watched/USER\n\nIs this already available and undocumented?
