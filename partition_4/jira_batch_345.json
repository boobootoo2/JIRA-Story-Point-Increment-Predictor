Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n- Create a filter that includes multiple projects.  {{Project in (ProjA,ProjB,ProjC,ProjD)}}\r\n- Configure a board to use that filter.\r\n- Grant permission to a user on ProjA only\r\n- Set the location of the Board to ProjB\r\n- As the user, access the board.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nUser should be able to view the board containing only the issues for ProjA.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nThe board will load with a permission error. \r\n\r\n !board error.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\n{{Error : The requested board cannot be viewed because it either does not exist or you do not have permission to view it}}\r\n\r\nh3.Workaround\r\n\r\n*Option 1* : Ignore the error and the board should load but the user needs to access the URL manually to navigate between the Active Sprint and Backlog.\r\n\r\nBacklog : {{https://<cloud_instance>.atlassian.net/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=<BoardNumber>&view=planning.nodetail}}\r\nActive Sprints : {{https://<cloud_instance>.atlassian.net/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=<BoardNumber>}}\r\n\r\n*Option 2* : Grant *Browse Project* permission to the user for the project configured as the location of the board.\r\n",

It is not possible to hide the done column to reduce clutter.\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nEnable a feature to toggle the visibility of the Done Column in the Active sprint.\r\n\r\nh3. Why this is important\r\n \r\nThere are use cases where the visibility of the Done column is not required on the Active Sprints. ie. there are multiple columns in the board and developers are not really interested to see what is on the Done Column.\r\n\r\n",
