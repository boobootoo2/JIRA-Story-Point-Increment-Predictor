As such we would like a view that does excludes anything above the version drop down box line and anything below the columns (\"Powered by ...\" etc)\n\nAnything else that also increases the value of the available screen space by allowing more issues to be seen also falls under this screen, so this includes [List mode in TASK BOARD|GHS-456] for example. Other ideas include:\n\n* Compact the space between adjacent cards.\n* Reduce the minimum card height for a given row of cards based on how much summary text they have.

Specically if I am in planning board or task board and I need to click on the issue number to see it or edit it it seems:\n- Greenhopper takes a long time to display the issue - much longer than w/o the IFrame.  It is especially painful from remote desktop since the screen seems to repaint several times to dim the background items, then draw the frame and then fill in the frame with the issue.\n- Greenhopper takes a long time to close the issue once displayed.  Many seconds to dismiss an issue is really painful.  Once again a lot of painting of the screen occurs.\n\nIs there a better way?  We don't want to resort to using browser tabs.  Seems other web 2.0 apps can display pop ups much faster w/o repainting with some clever AJAX.  Maybe greenhopper can do something similar.  Thanks for considering :)   People are really complaining loudly about the painting performance and wind up using Jira's issue navigator and only using Greenhopper when they must (e.g. for ranking or graphs) - we hope to get a solution.",

So if a sprint starts with several issues that comprise 16 story points (their committment), and then halfway into the sprint, the team decides to add 1 issue w/4 story points from the backlog, GH will redraw the graph in a way that shows the original committment as 20 story points, which actually the graph should reflect that 4 story points were added 1/2 way into the sprint.  \n\nThis is misleading because id a team took on more they should get more credit for it or it can be used to help understand \"why did our plan change\" \n\nJeff Sutherland showed us how to do this in Scrum (which is also how some google teams do it) by showing a \"Change in Committment\" line to the story point Burndown chart.  The Committement line stays at 0 if there are no changes, but goes down (into negative territory) if story points get added, and goes up if story points are dropped.  GH would no longer redraw graphs with the line moving from 16 story points at the beginning to 20 points at the beginning if 4 points were added - rather GH would just draw the graph starting from the 16 points all the way down to -4 points.  This keeps the ideal line intact as well as the original committment.  See the I attached.\n\n\n\n",

Also, I don't really want to mark this Fix For version as released at the end of the failed sprint, but there seens to be no other possible resolution to close the version and finalise the chart.\n\nI was wondering whether you have any recommendations for this situation.\n\nCheers,\nSteven",

      "description": "Like many product owners, I need to see my backlog of work (bugs, stories, etc) prioritized from top to bottom for all unreleased versions.  I can't plan future releases by puttingt them into Jira versions because if I do, there is no way to see a single top to bottom rank across all unreleased versions in the GH planning board (you can only see the items within a particular version or parent version and the ranking across versions is not clear).  \n\nThe only way to do that today it seems is to have *all* backlog items assigned to the *unscheduled* version until they are committed to a sprint (in which case the team uses the planning board to drag as many items as they can from the top of the ranked *unscheduled* version to the appropriate version/sprint. \n\nThen in the planning board, shown in list view (which is wonderful!), what I do is create tasks that say \"Items shown above this task are for Version 1.5\" and farther down on the ranked list I create a task that says \"Items shown above this task are for Version 2.0\" , etc.  When I want to plan releases to another I simply drag one item higher or lower to than the special \"Version tasks\" in the ranking.  Another benefit is that I create a task that says \"Items shown below this task have to be reviewed\" to allow me to see at a glance all items that have come in that I need to consider dragging to a higher rank.\n\nWhat I'd like to see instead is that for every Jira unrelease version, that Greenhopper's planning board shows an item that represents the Jira unreleased version (e.g. Version 1.5) - so that I don't need to create the tasks that I described above.  With that I can see a top to bottom ranking, and by dragging an item above or below a Jira version item, I will be automatically setting the Jira Fix Version/s field.  This would be wonderful.  Items assigned to versions would not disspear from the view like they do now and I could see all items in 1 ranked view.  This would ALSO unifiy the rank field with the Fix Version/s field, which is great, since by definition, items in 1 earlier version should have a lower rank than items planned for later versions.\n\nMake sense?  BTW doing this would basically simulate www.ScrumWorks.com planning board, which i think is one of the best ones around....also it would simulate the best practices for maintaining product backlogs in a single spreadsheet ala what Scrum creators like Jeff Sutherland reccomend.\n\n",

It would be great if:\n\n1.  At a minimum, I could get access to the raw data that is used to draw the burn down / burn up graphs for both released and unreleased versions so I could draw my own consolidated \"master release\" graphs from all 10 projects.   Could you expose the data as XLS or CSV files in some directory on the Jira server or expose links so I can save them as needed to disk and then load them into excel and do a roll up graph?\n2.  Even better (but I'll settle for #1), could I tell Greenhopper the list of Jira projects it should consider when drawing a consolidated release charts?  I would name all of my versions the same across all projects so that the roll up can make sense of the data.\n\nThis would be very useful - without it the only release planning we can do is on a project by project basis, and not for a master project.",
