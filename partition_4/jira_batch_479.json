Currently, the support system have such ability which is to categorizing the Customer Portal by grouping it, but it is not possible for the current ServiceDesk as it is a customization.\r\nh3.

Just to categorized it using the standard JIRA Project Category would be enough.

To allow support for the various suggested functionality for email will require a major re-work of our email handler infrastructure. This is currently not on our immediate roadmap as we are looking to deliver more requested features such as email customisation. However, the simplification of our email and configurations is something we will look into in the future, and we will be working on aligning our email configuration and behaviour closer with JIRA\u2019s.\r\n\r\n\u2014 JIRA Service Desk Team\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\n\r\n*Steps to Reproduce*:\r\n# Navigate to the \"Priorities\" page and set \"Minor\" as the Default Priority.\r\n# Create a new Dummy ServiceDesk Project.\r\n# Configure the Email Settings of the Project.\r\n# Sent out an Email with High Importance(This is for Microsoft Outlook) to the ServiceDesk Email.\r\n# Wait until the issue is processed.\r\n\r\n*Expected Results*:\r\nLike the Standard JIRA Incoming Mail Handler, the Email priority would be higher than the Default Priorty.\r\n\r\n*Actual Results*:\r\nServiceDesk will follow the Default Priority regardless of the Email Priority.\r\n\r\n*Notes*:\r\n* Tested in JIRA and it works so far.\r\n* JIRA Incoming Mail handler [documentation|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Creating+Issues+and+Comments+from+Email#CreatingIssuesandCommentsfromEmail-issuecommentcreationIssue/commentcreation]\r\n* The Header of the test email:\r\n{noformat}\r\nFrom: \"xxxx\" <xxxx@gmail.com>\r\nTo: <xxxx@gmail.com>\r\nSubject: testing service desk priority\r\nDate: Tue, 20 Jan 2015 23:35:11 +0800\r\nMessage-ID: <001d01d034c6$cf1f2c40$6d5d84c0$@gmail.com>\r\nMIME-Version: 1.0\r\nContent-Type: multipart/alternative;\r\n\tboundary=\"----=_NextPart_000_001E_01D03509.DD430880\"\r\nX-Priority: 1 (Highest)\r\nX-MSMail-Priority: High\r\nX-Mailer: Microsoft Outlook 14.0\r\nImportance: High\r\nThread-Index: AdA0xqZ5ulBpecvDTB2UxWnXYaA5YQ==\r\nContent-Language: en-us\r\n{noformat}",

To find out more about this feature, check out our release notes [here.|https://confluence.atlassian.com/servicedesk/jira-service-desk-3-10-x-release-notes-941610925.html#JIRAServiceDesk3.10.xreleasenotes-ver]\r\n\r\nOn behalf of the JSD team, I want to thank all of you for patience.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nJira Service Desk Team\r\n----\r\nDue to the missing functionality of having \"Priority per project\" in JIRA (JRA-3821), the JIRA default priority is useless when you have more than the default priorites. Which is a need if you have a big JIRA instance and many projects.\r\n\r\nI think the main solution must be made in JIRA core rather than in Service Desk but respect the workaround from the linked issue will be a quick fix for the customer portal.\r\n\r\nAnd maybe the SD Team can give the linked issue some higher rank in the Backlog.",

Typically, the service desk ticket is then closed with a message that a feature request is made (with a link to it) and that we plan to deliver this feature then or then.\r\n\r\nAn anonymous user can - like expected - view the ticket. If that user then clicks on login, he can login using his service desk customer login, and can still see the ticket and navigate the public jira project. However, once he visits the service desk portal, he cannot return to the public jira project anymore, as he keeps being redirected to the service desk interface.\r\n\r\nHowever, we want all users (anonymous and service desk customers) to view and browse our public jira project.\r\n{panel}",
