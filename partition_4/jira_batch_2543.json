      "description": "The main two reasons I&#x27;ve switched from using GitHub to BitBucket are the more liberal private repository hosting policy and that I could created a nested repository directory structure (or so I thought).  Unfortunately, the \"slug\" git repository name mapping implemented on BitBucket interferes with my attempts to use a nested repository directory structure.\n\nFirst some background info.\n\nThe Boost C++ libraries project is currently experimenting with converting their Subversion repository to a set of git repositories:  a git repository named boost.git acting as a super-project and separate submodule git repositories for each C++ library and tool in Boost.  The experimental Boost C++ libraries are hosted under github.com/boost-lib.\\\\\nI currently have a local LAN server that has mirror cloned repositories of the official boost-lib repositories on github.com/boost-lib, pulling down the changes as desired.  These mirror cloned repositories are under ~scm/git/oss/tool/boost-lib on the LAN server and are identical to the github.com/boost-lib repositories.  I then again mirror cloned the ~scm/git/oss/tool/boost-lib repositories to reside under ~scm/git/bluezoo/tool/boost-lib, which are shared by my individual local projects .  These ~scm/git/bluezoo/tool/boost-lib mirror cloned repositories are identical to the github.com/boost-lib repositories except they contain a bluezoo/master branch that is identical to the original master branch except for modifications to the .gitmodules file (see attachment).  I modify the .gitmodules file to use a relative path instead of an absolute path to the github.com/boost-lib submodule repositories, e.g. all the url properties in the .gitmodules files are changed from the absolute http://github.com/boost-lib/foo.git to the relative ../foo.git.  This allows me to do a --recurse-submodules push to the LAN server repositories from my local project repositories and a --recurse-submodules pull from the LAN server repositories to my local project repositories.  I&#x27;d like to be able to push my LAN server repositories with their nested repository submodule structure to BitBucket, but because of the \"slug\" mapping my mhcox/bluezoo/tool/boost-lib/boost.git repository is mapped to bluezoo-tool-boost-lib-boost.git.\n\nSo can the \"slug\" mapping algorithm be modified to allow nested repository directory structures?",
