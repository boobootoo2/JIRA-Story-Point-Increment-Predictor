Like creating a combination of primary keys in database table. Currently the way\u00a0*Unique*\u00a0feature works is that if you enable it for an attribute, every value of that attribute will be unique in that object type. If one object has that attribute value of *abc*, then *abc* can't be set for that attribute in any other object of that object type.\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nThere should be an option to enable\u00a0*Unique*\u00a0feature for 2 or more attributes of an object type and those 2 or more attributes could be used in combination. Something similar to a combination of primary keys in database table.\r\nh3. Why This Is Important\r\n - For large environments having a single attribute limits the creation of a unique CI(Configuration Item). This in turn severely puts a limit on what all can be imported.\r\n - Helps in environments with multiple domains and assets where the same hostname/application name can exist multiple times. For example: The combination of a Software/Application asset with the combined key of Name + Environment (PROD/DEV/TEST/...). Here the application will exist multiple times but only once in combination with the environment.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nCurrently there is no known workaround for this behavior.

Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Create a schema with Parent OT, X with a Child OT, Y.\r\n # Create another Object Type, Z, with Attribute as Child OT, Y\r\n # Create an import configuration (can be any type, CSV/JSON/Discovery)\r\n # Create an import mapping of a Object Type, Z with attribute pointing to Y\r\n # Delete OT, X from schema (Y should be deleted too)\r\n # Refresh import configuration page and try expanding importing mapping created in 4\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nImport mapping should be displayed with mapping of OT Z's attribute that was previously pointed to Y being removed.\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nThe below two exceptions are thrown in the splunk and FE receives a 500:\r\n{noformat}\r\njava.lang.NullPointerException: null\r\n\tat com.riadalabs.jira.plugins.insight.services.validation.ValidateImportSourceImpl.objectTypeAttributeBelongsToObjectType(ValidateImportSourceImpl.java:864)\r\n\tat com.riadalabs.jira.plugins.insight.services.validation.ValidateImportSourceImpl.objectTypeAttributeBelongsToObjectType(ValidateImportSourceImpl.java:851)\r\n\tat com.riadalabs.jira.plugins.insight.services.validation.ValidateImportSourceImpl.validateObjectTypeAttributeBelongsToObjectType(ValidateImportSourceImpl.java:805)\r\n\tat com.riadalabs.jira.plugins.insight.services.validation.ValidateImportSourceImpl.validateAttributeConfigurations(ValidateImportSourceImpl.java:592)\r\n\tat com.riadalabs.jira.plugins.insight.services.validation.ValidateImportSourceImpl.validateNonConformingConfiguration(ValidateImportSourceImpl.java:563)\r\n\tat com.riadalabs.jira.plugins.insight.services.validation.ValidateImportSourceImpl.validateImportSourceOTForExecution(ValidateImportSourceImpl.java:154)\r\n\tat com.riadalabs.jira.plugins.insight.services.impl.ImportSourceConfigurationServiceImpl.invalidateImportSourceOTIfInvalid(ImportSourceConfigurationServiceImpl.java:1419)\r\n\tat com.riadalabs.jira.plugins.insight.services.impl.ImportSourceConfigurationServiceImpl.updateImportSourceStatus(ImportSourceConfigurationServiceImpl.java:1343)\r\n\tat com.riadalabs.jira.plugins.insight.services.impl.ImportSourceConfigurationServiceImpl.loadImportSourceWithPassword(ImportSourceConfigurationServiceImpl.java:234)\r\n\tat com.riadalabs.jira.plugins.insight.services.impl.ImportSourceConfigurationServiceImpl.loadImportSource(ImportSourceConfigurationServiceImpl.java:221)\r\n{noformat}\r\n{code:java}\r\ncom.riadalabs.jira.plugins.insight.common.exception.RuntimeInsightException: InsightRuntimeException: java.lang.NullPointerException; nested exception is: null\r\n\tat com.riadalabs.jira.plugins.insight.services.core.AbstractService.logAndConvertException(AbstractService.java:58)\r\n\tat com.riadalabs.jira.plugins.insight.services.impl.ImportSourceConfigurationServiceImpl.loadImportSourceWithPassword(ImportSourceConfigurationServiceImpl.java:237)\r\n\tat com.riadalabs.jira.plugins.insight.services.impl.ImportSourceConfigurationServiceImpl.loadImportSource(ImportSourceConfigurationServiceImpl.java:221)\r\n{code}\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nNo known workaround to recover the import configuration at this stage. Only way is to create new schema and/or import configuration and ensure to delete Children Object Type first when attempting to remove Object Types.\r\n\r\nA current task is being created to fix this bug in the next couple of weeks.",
