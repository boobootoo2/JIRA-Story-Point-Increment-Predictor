This has been seen with some customers high as 20 to 50 repos in a single plan.\r\n\r\nThe behaviour for the \"quiet period\", or timeout between the last commit and the start of the build, is incorporated in to the logic of the repo, so when there is a large number of repos this can delay the start of the build by a multiple of the quiet period for each repo.

Others are belonging to different REMOTE agents.\r\nWhen the plans start their execution (3 plans in parallel), there will be only 1 thread running at a time, meaning, Bamboo will \"jump\" between the 3 child plans, and execute 1 task at a time, for the stages/jobs that are sharing the same SERVER agent.\r\n\r\nIf the agent could execute multiple tasks in parallel, even when they are deployed in the same agent, we could make things work faster.\r\n\r\nKeep up with the great work!\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nRicardo Gato",

One job in Stage 1 creates a shared artifact, another job in Stage 2 downloads the artifact using the Artifact download task.\r\n\r\n2. Clone Plan A into Plan B. \r\n\r\n3. To make sure Stage 2 of Plan B uses artifacts from Plan B and not from Plan A, edit the artifacts downloaded by the Artifact download task. Change source plan from Plan A to Plan B. The contents of the Artifact name combo box stays the same (which kind of makes sense, because the plan is a clone), so just hit Save.\r\n\r\n4. Run Plan B. Stage 2 of Plan B does not start to execute displaying a message: \"Job has not yet been queued. Waiting for prior stages to complete\", while the previous stage has already completed. The build hangs. Stop the build to see an error saying \"Unable to find an artifact definition for name: <your artifact name here>\", while the artifact is clearly there, possible to download from Stage 1 job's Artifacts tab.\r\n\r\n5. Further builds of the plan also result in the same error.\r\n\r\nThe current workaround to fix Plan B definition is to first change the plan from which the artifact is to be downloaded, hit Save. Then again, edit the artifact download task parameteres and choose the actual artifact to download, hit Save. It looks like the artifact name combo box is not properly refreshed when changing the source plan.\r\n\r\nAnother possible issue with the Artifact name combo box not refreshing properly is that when one changes the source plan and hit Save, the downloader will get all the artifacts and not the one that was indicated in the combo box when hitting Save.",

When we build a maven WAR for example it is publish as *.war. so any *.war is shared and can be defined any access from the deployment project. This makes NO sense. \r\n\r\nIf you are building a WAR file it is a simple task for bamboo to locate the file name, e.g. wps-1.2.1-872ce1d-666.war and automatically link this name to the deployment project as a variable. Then when defining the deployment plan we can for example use the variable in the tomcat plugin deployment WAR specification.. \r\n\r\nIt seems to me to be no point in publishing *.WAR and then not being able to simply link this to the deployment project.\r\n\r\nYes there might be some hacks... things that can be done to work around this, but bamboo should be able to do this out of the box. \r\n",

While this is nice for long running branches not changing very often, it is a PITA for a heavy traffic plan where devs quickly create a branch build on their own for various reasons. Even if their issue branches would match the automatic branch expression, they are not cleaned up and all the artifacts stay on the server forever until a human bot runs through the list of branches and cleans them up manually.\r\n\r\nInstead I suggest to change the default of the flag the other way around: it is unchecked by default. So branches matching the branch expression are cleaned up properly after X days regardless whether they are created manually or picked up by the change detection. Using a branch name not matching the expression still would prevent the cleanup, even with the flag unchecked.",

We release a product that depends on the major version of this core dependency, thus \"releasing\" the 2.0.0 version of the dependency, creating a tag, \"dependency-2.0.0\".\r\n\r\nWe would now like to update our 'patch' branch to be version 2.0.0, since any of our products that are depending on the patch version should be using 2.0.0 also, instead of the 1.2.2 version. But, we also don't want to update our 'patch' branch to 2.0.1 yet, since if we quickly perform a patch release of our main product, we don't want to create an \"empty\" dependency-2.0.1 tag/release that has no changes. However, updating our patch branch to version 2.0.0 triggers a build, which is stopped by our maven plugin that detects the existence of tag dependency-2.0.0.",

Summary\r\n\r\nWhen you delete a plan, Bamboo actually marks it and its plan branches for deletion as opposed to performing the operation right away. A daily task is run to perform the removal of plans in that state later in the day.\r\n\r\nThis bug is about an inconsistency that happens in the database while marking \"Plans\" and its \"Plan Branches\" for deletion. The bug is that sometimes the \"Plan\" is marked for deletion but it children \"Plan Branches\" are not.\r\n\r\nWhen the daily tasks is run, Bamboo fails to remove that plan (or perhaps this could block deletion of other plans as well as the one with the inconsistency).\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\nThe problem happens intermittently and we don't have the steps to reproduce it.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nIt is expected that there is no inconsistency while marking plans for deletion.\r\n\r\nh3.

If you are unsure about how to do so, please refer to our documentation: [Exporting data for backup|https://confluence.atlassian.com/bamboo/exporting-data-for-backup-289277255.html]\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\nAfter [backing up your instance|https://confluence.atlassian.com/bamboo/exporting-data-for-backup-289277255.html], there are 2 approaches to solving this issue:\r\n\r\n*Approach 1*\r\nYou can undelete the conflicted Plans by running a SQL query. These plans will then show up in the UI. After that you can proceed to deleting them again using the Bamboo UI. To show these plans again in the UI, run the query below:\r\n{code}\r\nupdate build set marked_for_deletion = 'false' where build_id in (select master.build_id from build master, build child where master.marked_for_deletion = 'true' and child.marked_for_deletion = 'false' and child.master_id = master.build_id)\r\n{code}\r\n\r\n*Approach 2*\r\nAlternatively of course you can mark the conflicting plan branches as deletable with the following SQL query. We don't really prefer this option of marking things deletable through SQL statements:\r\n{code}\r\nupdate build set marked_for_deletion = 'true' where build_id in (select child.build_id from build master, build child where master.marked_for_deletion = 'true' and child.marked_for_deletion = 'false' and child.master_id = master.build_id)\r\n{code}\r\n\r\n*Side note: different DB servers might require different queries*\r\nNote that the above queries are for PostgreSQL and need to be adapted to MySQL. For example, this is the latest query that should be run in a MySQL DB:\r\n{code:SQL}update build \r\nset marked_for_deletion=true \r\nwhere build_id in (select child.build_id \r\nfrom (select * from build) as master, (select * from build) as child \r\nwhere master.marked_for_deletion=true and child.marked_for_deletion=false and child.master_id=master.build_id);{code}\r\n",
