Expected Behavior\nThe online editor should auto-detect the line endings, and save the file in the same format again. The behavior should match the one of typical programmers&#x27; IDEs or text editors, such as Eclipse, PyCharm, Notepad++, etc.\n\nOptionally, the online editor could offer an option (drop-down box) to select the intended line-endings for the file being edited. The value preselected in this drop-down box should be the one that the online editor auto-detects.\n\nh1.

God bless Bitbucket for making navigation so easy, because you&#x27;ve got that side bar and a nice \"Source\" icon that will take you right to what you&#x27;re looking for. Once you&#x27;re done looking at the code, you go back to that comment, so frantically look for that tab where you had typed in all that precious info... only to find that it&#x27;s now all gone. And it makes you just a little bit sadder that it&#x27;s going to be that much longer before you get to enjoy the California sunshine.... So please, for the love of God, notify me that I&#x27;m navigating away from a page in which I&#x27;ve typed a bunch of text, and ask me if I really want to kill all those bits.
