Uncheck Push changes.\r\n \u00a0\u00a0*\u00a0Click on Commit in the lower right.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n \u00a0\u00a0*\u00a0In the Submodule Check dialog click on the Open button for\u00a0`sub`.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n \u00a0\u00a0*\u00a0Add a comment in the comment field.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n \u00a0\u00a0*\u00a0Uncheck push and click Commit.\r\n \r\n I expect the commit to succeed or fail.\u00a0\u00a0Instead the dialog freezes.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n###Workaround\r\n\r\nThere is a workaround. \u00a0You can exit/kill Sourcetree and start again, and this time commit all changes in lower submodules before committing in upper modules. \u00a0Or maybe this very attractive feature works from the supermodule if the submodule tab was never opened in the session. \u00a0I didn't lose data or put the repos into a state that required time to analyze. \u00a0But I'm not sure whether some other scenarios with more levels of submodules would lose data.",

Selecting the main SourceTree window is possible, but everything is disabled, presumably because it thinks that the modal confirmation dialog is visible. I am able to dismiss the confirmation dialog (but cannot confirm the\u00a0discard operation) via closing it\u00a0directly from the taskbar, which enables the main SourceTree application again.\r\n\r\nThis problem does not occur when I have SourceTree running on the primary display.\r\n\r\nIt also does not occur in either configuration in SourceTree for Windows v1.9.10.0.\r\n\r\nObviously this behaviour is annoying as it forces a change in my workflow, but it is hardly the end of the world.",

In this particular case it was obvious because I knew that I had modified 2 files but it was only showing one of them, but I suspect that this could be much more serious at other times if lots of files were modified, and then you accidentally only commit a subset of them.\r\n\r\nRunning the 'git status' command correctly returns the two modified files, and running 'git diff' correctly shows the changes in both files. Consequently this appears to be an issue with how SourceTree views the\u00a0repository rather than with the repository itself. The repository in this case is quite small (2.3MB including the working copy).\r\n\r\nThe files in question were both modified several days ago, and I just opened SourceTree again this morning (i.e. in this case they were not modified while SourceTree was running).\r\n\r\nPressing Ctrl+R or F5 failed to refresh the view no matter where I set the focus prior to pressing those keys. However, using the View -> Refresh option from the menu did force the refresh to occur.\r\n\r\nI have seen this a couple of times previously using this beta, but never when using either the previous version of SourceTree on Windows, or the current version of SourceTree on Mac. However, I'm not sure what specific behaviour causes this to occur (but am happy to help if you have specific things that you would like me to try).\r\n\r\nThere's 4 errors listed in my\u00a0log file, but all appear to be dictionary related so it doesn't seem likely that they are related.",

      "description": "!constant_reconnect.png!\r\n\r\nI am getting TCP reconnect messages every few seconds with SourceTree open. Destination is the git repo I use for work, and the problem is there is a firewall rule that blocks an IP address for 10 minutes if there are too many requests from that IP within one minute. I'm not 100% sure this TCP reconnect is what is tripping the limit, but I'm trying to rule out all possible causes.\u00a0\r\n\r\nSo, is there some way in SourceTree to disable the constant TCP reconnect?",
