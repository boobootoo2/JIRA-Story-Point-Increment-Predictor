We update it via pull requests or directly by pushing new changes to it, and we synchronize those changes in remote servers by pulling from it.\n\nThis has been working like a charm for about a year, but now we are not able to pull changes from this repo to update a remote server:\n\n{code}\n#!bash\n\n$ git pull origin\nremote: Total 0 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)\nerror: unable to find dcdff3f40bfc450ec8d5326ff12bc03e160bde1f\nfatal: object dcdff3f40bfc450ec8d5326ff12bc03e160bde1f not found\n{code}\n\n*Even if I try to clone it the same error appears.* The commit exists, so the error make no sense: https://bitbucket.org/encore-lab/encore-framework/commits/dcdff3f40bfc450ec8d5326ff12bc03e160bde1f\n\nNonetheless, this object/commit is available from Bitbucket and also in my local machine (where I generated it and then pushed to the central repo).\n\nNo matters if I push more commits to the repository, when I try to pull the repo to get last commits it always shows me that the last commit doesn&#x27;t exist.\n\nI&#x27;ve tried other ways, for example (but none of them worked at the moment):\n\n{code}\n#!bash\n\n$ git gc\n$ git fsck --full\n$ git reflog expire --expire=0 --all\n{code}\n\nI also reset to the previous state of the repo and re-apply the changes again but it didn&#x27;t work either.\n\nSo I would like to know if there&#x27;s a problem with that repository in Bitbucket. I have just tried to fork it and the problem disappears with the forked repository - which has exactly the same commits as the primary repo.\n\nThe repository is this: https://bitbucket.org/encore-lab/encore-framework (it&#x27;s private, so I hope you -staff members- could access it).\n\nCan anyone help me out here?

The first problem, however, is that I am unable to even request a token so that the user can authenticate access to their BitBucket account. This is the url that I am attempting to browse to:\n\nhttps://bitbucket.org/api/1.0/oauth/request_token?oauth_version=1.0&oauth_nonce=d799ffdce7ffaa13f8239a406875e081&oauth_timestamp={timestamp}&oauth_consumer_key={key}&oauth_signature_method=HMAC-SHA1&oauth_signature={secret}&oauth_callback=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%2Ftest%2F\n\nThe url was generated using the testing site recommended on the BitBucket documentation page here: https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/BITBUCKET/OAuth+on+bitbucket\n\nIt&#x27;s also worth pointing out that the testing site recommended on the document listed above doesn&#x27;t allow requesting an initial request token, because it doesn&#x27;t send an oauth_callback parameter. Therefore, the BitBucket API just returns an error every time you attempt to use it.\n\nI have tried every permutation of the url above that I can think of, using PLAINTEXT, generating a new APP with new keys/secrets, generating new timestamps. Nothing has worked.\n\nMy goal with this plugin is to allow users to download tags as zip files from private and public repos. I&#x27;m thinking that I can do something like:\n\nhttps://bitbucket.org/{user}/{repo}/get/{branch,tag}.{zip,tar.gz,tar.bz}\n\nand pass the authentaicated OAuth token as a parameter to access the zip file.\n\nWe have been working on this integration for a few weeks, and we would like to get this plugin into the hands of our users as quickly as possible.\n\nThank you very much for the time.\n\nIf you need more information from me, please let me know.",
