In this scenario the user doesn't need to have a tag.\r\n\r\nThe below screenshot shows that behavior for both of these situations.\r\n * The {{creator}} has a large _Full Name_, but with spaces, there's no line break applied and the text overflows the sidebar.\r\n * Another user has a large _Full Name_ without any spaces and the same occurs.\r\n * There's another user with a large _Full Name_ on which a line break occurs, but that's because there's no {{tag}} associated to it.\r\n\r\n !screenshot-2.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\nh3.

Recently you have done some GUI changes. Sadly, to us, all of which are negative and are causing us delays in handling. Below are some bullet points of the main ones:\r\n * Placing the latest update in an incident on the very bottom of the ticket is very user unfriendly. Having to scroll as headless chickens to get to new update is very painful. Logical arrangement would of course be as before - newest update on top.\r\n * Removing the large icon of the ticket type and priority from the left top corner is making quick overview of the severity difficult. Having little icon hidden in the column menu on the right hand side is not very good. Especially if the priority is marked with the same color as the other text on those lines.\u00a0\r\n * Hiding advanced reports into a menu is one more click than what was needed. Again not very user friedly to prolong the customer journey.\r\n\r\nThank you for taking your time to read, pass on and consideration to change the above.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nPavel Huml\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0",

Expected results\r\n\r\nThe queue should not be saved, since the JQL query is invalid\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Actual results\r\n\r\nThe following happens:\r\n- the queue is saved\r\n- after that, it is impossible to view any queue from the UI\r\n !Picture3.png|thumbnail! \r\n- the only way to fix this issue is to follow the workaround from the KB article [JIRA Service Desk Queues return empty page|https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirakb/jira-service-desk-queues-return-empty-page-820117845.html]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested solution\r\n\r\nThe entire queue page should not be empty even if one queue contains an invalid JQL query, or at least there should be an explicit message in the UI to lead the user to the root cause of the issue.\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Note\r\n\r\nThis issue was only reproduced so far with the 3rd party add-on [Elements Connect|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/23337/elements-connect-formerly-nfeed?hosting=server&tab=overview].\r\n\r\nWe believe the reason why we can only reproduce with this add-on is because:\r\n- Jira assumes that any custom field is case insensitive, which is the case for Jira's out-of-the-box fields. For example, the JQL query below will work in both the issue search and the queue configuration page, even though the actual name of the custom field is \"Time to resolution\" and not \"Time to resolution\"\r\n{code}\r\nproject = BASICSD AND \"TIME to resolution\" = breached() \r\n{code}\r\n !Picture4.png|thumbnail! \r\n- However, it seems that the custom fields coming from the add-on [Elements Connect|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/23337/elements-connect-formerly-nfeed?hosting=server&tab=overview] are not case insensitive, therefore if any custom field is referred to with the incorrect case in a JQL query, the issue search will return an error, but the Service Desk queues will still be saved and then will show as empty\r\n\r\nFor this reason, we are moving the type of this ticket from a bug to a suggestion ticket, since the queues are working as expected when no 3rd party add-on is involved.\r\n",

Actual Results\r\nThe job can take several hours to finish on a MySQL database or may never complete at all leading to database errors and the Job failing.\r\n \r\nh3. Workaround\r\n* We can try to make the tables lighter manually. That should help with the audit job finishing in reasonable time.\r\nIf you *do not* use the SLA Audit log feature, you may delete all rows from these tables {{AO_54307E_SLAAUDITLOGDATA}} and {{AO_54307E_SLAAUDITLOG}}.\r\n* We can also make the SLA audit data get cleaned out sooner, preventing it from getting big enough to be problematic by applying the workaround in https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSDSERVER-5871",

Issue Summary\r\n\r\nIf you grant the *Manage Watchers* permission to a user (that has Jira Service Desk application access) without granting this user the *Jira Service Desk Agent* permission, the user will be unable to manage the watchers of an issue.\r\n\r\nh3. Environment\r\n\r\n * Any clean instance.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Grant application access and the browse project permission to a user in Jira Service Desk.\r\n # (Optional) Add him into a project role for a Jira Service Desk project.\r\n # Grant the *Manage Watchers* permission to this user.\r\n # Attempt to add or remove watchers from an issue.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nThe user should be able to manage the watchers of this issue.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nThe user is not able to manage the watchers. The permission helper tool indicates that the user needs to be a Service Desk Agent. However, the definition of the Service Desk Agent is *Allows users to interact with customers and access Service Desk features of a project.* The *Manage Watchers* permission is not related to Jira Service Desk. Therefore, a user should be able to manage watchers even if he/she is not part of the *Service Desk Team* role and does not have the Service Desk Agent permission.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nFor now, the workaround is granting the user the Service Desk Agent permission. Otherwise, there is no workaround available.\r\n",

However, if custom issue type is used, an additional step which is to change the option for editing issue type field is often required so that the associated request type will be available for the bulk edit.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to reproduce the issue\r\n# Create 3 new issue types --> ITA, ITB, ITC.\r\n# Create a new issue type scheme with the issue types above.\r\n# Associate the issue type scheme with a Service Desk project.\r\n# Remove all existing Request Types.\r\n# Create 3 new request types --> RTA to be associated with ITA, RTB to be associated with ITB, RTC to be associated with ITC.\r\n# Create a new issue from Jira for each issue type, leave the request type empty.\r\n# Using Issue navigator, search for the new issues and perform bulk edit.\r\n# Choose the issue with issue type ITC and edit issue to set the request type.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected result\r\nThe default option shown for request type is RTC.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual result\r\nThe default option shown for request type is RTA because the default option shown for issue type is ITA. Changing the option for issue type to ITB will allow the associated request type to be set via bulk edit.\r\n\r\nh3. Notes\r\n* This is only affecting custom issue types, this Bug is not reproducible with the default issue types created along with the Service Desk projects.\r\n* An example use case is that a bunch of issues created in Jira via CSV import and request type should be able to be set via bulk operations. This Bug might give the impression that it's not possible to bulk edit issues to set request type.",

This seems to work without issue, however some load balancers (EG Azure Application Gateway) will BLOCK the attachment requests with HTTP 400\r\n\r\n*(Issue 2)*\r\n* If UTF8 encoding is used as the Subject, Jira stores the attachment name verbatim without decoding it - for example {{=?utf-8?B?bG9sCg==?=.eml}}\r\n\r\nh3.
