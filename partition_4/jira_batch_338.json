Environment\r\n* Jira Software\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Create a new board with a filter that displays issues from all projects on the instance.

Issue Details:\r\nn the Kanaban backlog, if a story has subtasks, then you can't drag the story onto an epic to add that story to the epic. \r\n\r\nAfter you drag it, it comes up with the message \"you can't add sub-tasks to epics\" - note that I'm not dragging the subtasks, but the actual story.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround:\r\nThe workaround is to drag only the parent Story so that it will work.\r\n\r\ne.g., \r\nIn the below example, 'Story 2' has a sub-task and 'Story 3' with two sub-tasks in it.\r\n\r\nClick on the greater than symbol against the parent story so that it will display the sub-task in it.\r\n\r\n !Sub-task1.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\nNow, drag only the 'Story 2' to Epic panel so that it will be added to the epic.\r\n !Sub-task2.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\nh3. Suggestion:\r\nThe concern is that most of the normal users are not aware of this workaround and it would be helpful to display the UI error with specific details instead of generic error - \"you can't add sub-tasks to epics\".",

This policy states that on a specific ticket type, it must have a minimum number of votes before it can be approved. I was going to attempt to enforce this policy by adding a Post Function to check the number of votes before allowing the \"approved\" button to display. As the project lead, I am often informed that a ticket of this type needs to be created. As the reporter of the issue, my vote in cast as a yes. Whether or not that is my opinion.\u00a0 The current workaround for this is to create the ticket, go in to edit the ticket to change the reporter, then cast a vote.\u00a0\r\nI have a few issues with this.\u00a0\r\n # Automatically assuming the reporter of an issue is in favor is both unnecessary and adds no value to the functionality of the Jira software.\u00a0\r\n # Forcing the vast amount of users to complete an ad hoc workaround for a functionality that is within the software that our companies pay for with a simple explanation of \"We consider the initial report of an Issue to be an implicit vote; therefore, it would be redundant for a Reporter to vote up her own Issue.\" - John Garcia Aug 6,2014\u00a0[https://community.atlassian.com/t5/Questions/Why-can-t-some-users-VOTE-on-an-issue-when-others-can/qaq-p/31523]\r\n # This limits one of the biggest buying features of the Jira software which for my organization would the the vast customization and versatility of the Jira platform.
