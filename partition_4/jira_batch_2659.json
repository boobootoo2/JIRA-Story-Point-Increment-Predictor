      "description": "h3. Summary (Original content by the reporter)\r\nWhen checking out code, the 'Source Code Checkout' task has an option named 'Force Clean Build' to clean out the directory prior to checking out the code.  I've discovered that although this option is checked, the code directory is not being consistently cleaned out before fresh code is being checked out.\r\n\r\nFiles that have been deleted from the repository are still present in the per-plan directory on each agent that has run the plan, even after several manual runs of the plan have been run on the agents.  This causes confusion and delay to the builds as outdated information is used.\r\n\r\nPlease ensure that 'Force Clean Build' actually does what the documentation says it does, that is, remove the directory before running the build.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Install latest Bamboo v5.9.4 (OS does not matter)\r\n# Link to a Git repository\r\n# Create a plan with 2 stages:\r\n## Stage1: It has a single job with 'Source Code Checkout' task\r\n--- It checks out the source code from the linked Git repository\r\n--- It enables 'Force Clean Build'\r\n--- It shares every file as an artifact (i.e. copy pattern: {{\\*\\*/\\*}})\r\n## Stage2: It has a single job with 'Script' task\r\n--- It has a artifact dependency to be shared the artifact\r\n--- It executes {{$ find .}} to check the working copy of the repository\r\n# Execute the plan\r\n# Delete a file from the repository\r\n# Execute the plan again. The log of Stage2 tells that the deleted file is still accessible\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nThe deleted file is not accessible any more\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nThe deleted file is still accessible\r\n \r\nh3.Workaround\r\nDelete the working directory manually before the plan is run ({{<BAMBOO_HOME>/xml-data/build-dire/<PROJ>\\-<PLAN>\\-<JOB>}} directory). You may do it in another task which is executed prior to 'Source code checkout' task",

However, if I click the down arrow next to Advanced Options and scroll down, next to the File Pattern field, I see a red error message \"you must enter a regex expression\". I would think this should somehow have been displayed, and not hidden when the advanced options were hidden after clicking the Save Repository button.",

It would be nice if there was an ability to click the column header of one field and have the pages sorted by that column. A common use case for an audit log like this one is to examine all the occurrences where a field was changed regardless of date. In an audit log with dozens of pages it is not easy to do.",
