      "description": "h3. Problem Definition\n\nOn the Work board, when dragging an issue to a column with multiple statuses, the candidate statuses are shown when hovering over the column. This is good, because I know what will happen to this issue.\n\nUnfortunately, this breaks when the issue cannot be transitioned to some of the statuses of the column: If there is only one target status left, that status is no longer shown. In this case, it is incredibly hard to predict to which status the item will transition to. E.g. in our fairly normal workflow, it is for example not possible to stop progress on an item which you are not assigned to. \n\nThe customers would want to be able to transition the issues over the workflow using board without the need to have in mind a complex workflow.\n\nh3. Suggested Solution\nA workaround is to pick a workflow which allows all transitions (or even using the Jira Agile Simplified Workflow), but since our \"global issue tracking project\" is centrally managed, this is not something I can influence.\n\nSo, I'd expect that the target status is always shown when dragging items to a column with multiple statuses. Optionally, the target statuses could also simply always be shown. Another option would be to also show statues to which one cannot transition (e.g. in red) and display an explanation if someone should drop the item there. \n",

Suggestion for a new report\nFor sprint X which will be completing in next _40 hours_, the user should see allocated time for the team users & lets say user A has issues with original estimation time with more than _40 hours_ then that user must highlighted or some icon comes as RED stating this users is heavy allocated. So, the scrum master can move some of A user task to other available user.",

Click the \"...\" additional options menu at the top of the task view pane (on the right hand side)\n3. Click the \"Assign\" link from the menu\n4. Click \"Assign to me\" on the assignment modal (in the middle of the screen)\n5. Click the \"Assign\" button on the bottom of the assignment modal.\nAt this point, you then have to go back and re-find (eye-movement/scannning) the original issue you were dealing with.\n\nRequest/Recommended Solution.\nOn the agile card for a story/task that is unassigned, in the spot where an assigned task would display the assigned users's avatar, if the current user has permission to take assignment, place an arrow/checkmark or other graphical indicator with a title/help text of \"Take assignment\" (possibly displaying current user's avatar in the spot on long hover)  Clicking this icon should immediately modify the task/story to be assigned to the current user and the action icon should be replaced with the current user's avatar.

Our users are asking for the ability of Jira gadgets to support showing data in terms of story points instead of issue counts. For example, for whatever statistic type is chosen for a Pie Chart gadget, we would like the ability to show the total story points for each type instead of issue counts. Or for the Two Dimensional Filter Statistics gadget, there should be an option to show the data in terms of story points instead of issue counts. The idea is to show data in terms of a story point budget.\n\nIn Jira Agile, even if the estimation statistic for a board is set to Story Points, there's no agile report that can show the data we're looking for.

Background\nAs of now, the [Report mode|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/AGILE/Using+Report+Mode] in JIRA Agile shows the *Status Report* section (excluding Burndown Chart) as the following:\n* Completed Issues\n* Incomplete Issues\n\n!version_report.JPG|thumbnail!\n\nThis explains why the progress of the reports (Sprint. Version, and Epic) are tracked by the two options, either the issue is resolved / completed or it is not (not by the actual progress of the issue)\n\nUnlike Burndown Chart, it shows the complete progress of each issue that belongs the particular sprint, allowing users to track the changes in the Estimation:\n!burndown_chart.JPG|thumbnail!\n\nThe _Remaining Estimate and Time Spent_ in *Time Tracking* will only be taken into consideration for [Burndown Chart|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/AGILE/Viewing+the+Burndown+Chart] only.\n!estimation.JPG|thumbnail!\n\nh5. Expectation\nHow the reports should work is that:\n* The Version and Epic reports should reflect the _Remaining Estimate_. Why? Because the [estimated amount of work remaining|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/AGILE/Viewing+the+Version+Report] is directly provided in the Remaining Estimate.\n* The progress shown in the Version and Epic in the Plan mode reflects the _Remaining Estimate_ of the associated issues.\n* The Sprint report shows the _Remaining Estimate_ in addition to (or instead of) _Original Time Estimate_ in the Issues Not Completed section. The rationale behind knowing how much time the developer estimate remains is helpful to know when you are bumping issues from one sprint to another.\n\nThere is a current open request which is still *Open* but this is confined to Version Report only:\n* [Allow Version Report to show velocity based on Remaining time|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/GHS-8510]\n\nIn a nutshell, the *Remaining Time Estimate and Time Spent* should also be implemented as an option in other reports as well.",

All four board are differentiate by filters associated with them, they are extremely simple.  \nProject = VCI AND \u201cRelease Vehicle\u201d = <Release Vehicle> ORDER BY Rank ASC.\n\nWe have four expected values for \u201cRelease Vehicle\u201d\n\u2022\tUnallocated\n\u2022\tMajor Release\n\u2022\tTech Release\n\u2022\tHotfix\nAll new issues by default go to the Unallocated Release Vehicle and in turn to the Unallocated Agile Board/Backlog as configured by the JIRA team.  The Rank value is working properly (ranking to bottom of backlog) when the issue is created from the Unallocated Agile Board page or any JIRA page other than our other 3 Agile Boards.  When the issue is created while the user is viewing the VCI Major Release, Tech Release or Hotfix Agile Boards, the issue goes to the Unallocated Agile Board but has a rank value from the Agile Board the user is viewing.  This seems like a bug.  Also when issues are moved between boards, they are not ranked to the bottom of the new board, they maintain the rank from the previous board.  This is probably by design.\n\nTwo critical requests/questions to preserve integrity of Agile Boards backlog ranking for VCI project:\n* Can we configure the system such that if we are creating an issue for the VCI project while viewing an Agile Board other than VCI - Unallocated, it always gets ranked to the end of the VCI \u2013 Unallocated Agile Board (874)?\n* When we change the Release Vehicle of an issue, for example from Unallocated to Major Release, the issue carries over with the rank from the Unallocated (previous) Agile Board, causing it to be ranked inappropriately.  The desired behavior is for it to show up at the end of the backlog it\u2019s moved to.  In this example the issue may have had a rank of 222133 in the Unallocated Agile Board, and when moved to the Major Release Agile Board it will maintain rank 222133, when that rank places it towards the top of the Major Release Agile Board.\n \nRegards,\nAmit Singh",
