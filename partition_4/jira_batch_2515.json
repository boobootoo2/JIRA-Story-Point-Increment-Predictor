This involves importing SVG files into the repo.\n\nWe like the ability to have changes mailed to the team, but we got tired of the  large diffs detailing the changes to the SVG files. We decided to dump a .gitattributes file into our repo:\n\n{code}\n*.svg -diff\n{code}\n\nThis is enough for local git tools (like gitk) to consider the SVGs as binary, but bitbucket will still mail diffs against these files. I propose that it should not.\n\nThanks",

      "description": "The 2 options for Commit emails aren&#x27;t very useful. For example, if I&#x27;d like to notify a fellow coder of a change I made, I certainly would never send them this:\n\n1 new commit in MagicRepo:\n\nhttps://bitbucket.org/b9chris/magicrepo/commits/b360b69bbac6/\\\\\nChangeset:   b360b69bbac6\\\\\nBranch:      SupportUsChanges\\\\\nUser:        bramlage\\\\\nDate:        2013-10-05 05:52:03\\\\\nSummary:     Updated SupportUs/Index.cshtml Store, still waiting on full product views and paypal buttons for two new shirts\n\nAffected #:  6 files\n\nRepository URL: https://bitbucket.org/b9chris/magicrepo/\n\n--\n\nThis is a commit notification from bitbucket.org. You are receiving\\\\\nthis because you have the service enabled, addressing the recipient of\\\\\nthis email.\n\nThat&#x27;s a ton of chaff for the one thing that&#x27;s actually useful about that email:\n\nUpdated SupportUs/Index.cshtml Store, still waiting on full product views and paypal buttons for two new shirts\n\nExcept often the actual commit message I want to see is clipped.\n\nI assume some users are using this bad-for-humans email in systems automation, so would it be possible to add a third more usable email option? Happy to work with you on the format. Here&#x27;s an initial proposal:\n\nSubject:\n\nMagicRepo - 3 commits - b9chris - 2013-10-30\n\n(Date prevents Gmail from threading update emails infinitely)\n\nBody:\n\n(no summary of how many commits - that&#x27;s clear from the list of commits we&#x27;re about to iterate)\n\n*2013-10-05 05:52:03*\\\\\nUpdated SupportUs/Index.cshtml Store, still waiting on full product views and paypal buttons for two new shirts\n\nUpdate me when stills available.\n\nSupportUs/Index.cshtml +6, -3, *7\n\nbranch: SupportUsChanges\n\nSo, you get the full commit message, instead of presuming that just the first line is all that&#x27;s important. Most of the irrelevant stuff like a link to commit, the commit hash, etc is left out - all fine things to have but they can be found just fine on their own and aren&#x27;t relevant to a quick summary. Then a summary of changed files with number of lines added, removed, changed. Branch is at the end since it&#x27;s rarely a value you don&#x27;t already anticipate (whatever your workflow), but occasionally relevant.",
