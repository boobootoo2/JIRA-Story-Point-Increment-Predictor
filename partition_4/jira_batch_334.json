Where can you see all issues of a specific epic in a roadmap? Nowhere, so here's my suggestion:\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nWhen you click on an epic in your roadmap, the epics' overview opens on the right side of your screen. But why not split up or kind of open up the epic into its issues? It can still be possible to see the issues on the right side of the screen, but in my opinion that feature would really add to the roadmap - which I really enjoy working with, by the way. It would just make it look a bit more clear and it would be possible to have an overview of your whole epic, not just the epic itself.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nI would love to show what I mean by attaching a picture, but unfortunately I don't know how and if that is even possible.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nKind Regards\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nSabrina Holzer\u00a0",

      "description": "{panel:title=Atlassian Update - 21 April 2020}\r\nHi everyone,\r\n\r\nI am Ritesh Ranjan, Product Manager for Jira. We have been working hard to improve the way you manage projects in Jira. Your comments and feedback has been useful in shaping these features.\r\n\r\nToday I want to share a quick update on Project Archiving. We have been working on Project Archiving over the past few months, and at this point we are testing the feature. Post testing completion, we will be launching this feature in a gradual rollout to all Jira Software Premium customers. We also announced this feature in Summit 2020.\r\n\r\nOn a related note, we are also releasing \u201cTrash\u201d for Projects, which moves projects to trash bin before it gets permanently deleted. You can follow progress of that ticket at\u00a0https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-23498.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nRitesh Ranjan\r\nProduct Manager, JIRA Platform\r\n{panel}\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nIn next-gen Jira project, there is no option for hiding or archiving projects. It would be great to be able to archive a project that's no longer in use and refer to them in the future.\r\n\r\nAlso, as a next-gen user I want these archived projects available for viewing for the whole team but through a separate \"archived\" section.",

      "description": "h3.*Problem Definition*\r\nAt the moment, using the bulk change feature to move issues to team-managed (formerly next-gen) project. When a similar custom field with the same name exist on the Issue type custom field there's a prompt for data update. Likewise, if the field doesn't exist, there will be no prompt for data update.\r\nIn the above scenarios the data on those fields are removed and needs to be added manually. If the fields exist (In the team-managed (formerly next-gen) project), the data is still removed and still needs to be entered manually. However these fields data are actually hidden, by using the search button view all issues and select the columns to add the field name, the data is still there but if altered prior to the move, then the data changes.\r\n !fields.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\n\r\nh3.*Suggested Solution*\r\nAdd a feature that will automatically detect that those fields do not exist and prompt the user for a decision. If the fields that match exist, automatically match the fields to the team-managed (formerly next-gen) project retaining the data.\r\n\r\nh3.*Why this is important*\r\nAs the team-managed (formerly next-gen) project provides a Roadmap functionality, which tells a much larger part in Agile Project. it would be better if projects can be migrated successfully than going through the daunting task to re-creating projects from scratch and custom fields which is inefficient.\r\n\r\nh3.*Workaround*\r\nTo manually create a similar custom fields following the [*available custom fields in team-managed projects*|https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirasoftwarecloud/available-custom-fields-for-next-gen-projects-957511207.html] that mimics the same fields / have the same name on company-managed (formerly classic) project and manually update the data all over again on the team-managed (formerly next-gen) project or during the move.
