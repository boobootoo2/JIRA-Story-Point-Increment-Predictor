Example:\r\n * In 7.0.10, the content of Customer Request Type is simple:\r\n{code:java}\r\n\"customfield_10010\":\"asd/getithelp\"\r\n{code}\r\n\r\n * In 7.3.3, it's much more informative:\r\n{code:java}\r\n\"customfield_10001\":{  \r\n   \"_links\":{  \r\n\t  \"jiraRest\":\"http://10.60.2.10:8733/jira/rest/api/2/issue/11413\",\r\n\t  \"web\":\"http://10.60.2.10:8733/jira/servicedesk/customer/portal/3/ASD-14\",\r\n\t  \"self\":\"http://10.60.2.10:8733/jira/rest/servicedeskapi/request/11413\"\r\n   },\r\n   \"requestType\":{  \r\n\t  \"id\":\"35\",\r\n\t  \"_links\":{  \r\n\t\t \"self\":\"http://10.60.2.10:8733/jira/rest/servicedeskapi/servicedesk/3/requesttype/35\"\r\n\t  },\r\n\t  \"name\":\"Request a desk phone\",\r\n\t  \"description\":\"If you'd like to request a desk phone, get one here.\",\r\n\t  \"helpText\":\"\",\r\n\t  \"serviceDeskId\":\"3\",\r\n\t  \"groupIds\":[  \r\n\t\t \"7\"\r\n\t  ],\r\n\t  \"icon\":{  \r\n\t\t \"id\":\"10526\",\r\n\t\t \"_links\":{  \r\n\t\t\t\"iconUrls\":{  \r\n\t\t\t   \"48x48\":\"http://10.60.2.10:8733/jira/secure/viewavatar?avatarType=SD_REQTYPE&size=large&avatarId=10526\",\r\n\t\t\t   \"24x24\":\"http://10.60.2.10:8733/jira/secure/viewavatar?avatarType=SD_REQTYPE&size=small&avatarId=10526\",\r\n\t\t\t   \"16x16\":\"http://10.60.2.10:8733/jira/secure/viewavatar?avatarType=SD_REQTYPE&size=xsmall&avatarId=10526\",\r\n\t\t\t   \"32x32\":\"http://10.60.2.10:8733/jira/secure/viewavatar?avatarType=SD_REQTYPE&size=medium&avatarId=10526\"\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t }\r\n\t  }\r\n   },\r\n   \"currentStatus\":{  \r\n\t  \"status\":\"Waiting for support\",\r\n\t  \"statusDate\":{  \r\n\t\t \"iso8601\":\"2017-04-06T22:34:44+0800\",\r\n\t\t \"jira\":\"2017-04-06T22:34:44.000+0800\",\r\n\t\t \"friendly\":\"06/Apr/17 10:34 PM\",\r\n\t\t \"epochMillis\":1491489284000\r\n\t  }\r\n   }\r\n}\r\n{code}\r\n\r\n(!) Due to this, it's slower to retrieve the field and its related data in 7.1.0/3.1.0 and above, considering the content of the custom field and size of data. Example:\r\n * In 7.0.10, retrieving 14 issues takes 32.1ms, and the size is 467b\r\n * In 7.3.3, retrieving 14 issues takes 412.4ms, and the size is 1.7kb\r\n\r\n(i) The underlying cause is, JIRA needs to query the database to retrieve a lot of information, such as the issue, project, portal, etc. And a lot of this is *not cached*, so if loading many issues, the number of db calls would multiply.\r\nh4. +Suggestion+\r\n\r\nWe should use caching properly, and not retrieve the entire activity list to get the issue's currentStatus (current status of the issue).\r\nh5. Notes\r\n * The main benefit though from caching more data, is that repeated calls to get the same portal, request type for example, do not result in another database call, rather they use the previously returned value.\r\n * Unless we strip out the payload again to go back to returning only the key, rather than the actual customer request data, it won't be back to exactly how it was.",

Environment\r\n* Service Desk installed\r\n* User has My JIRA Home set to Service Desk\r\n* User has access to multiple Service Desk projects\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Open up Service Desk project A in a browser tab.\r\n# Open up a second browser tab/window and go to Service Desk project B\r\n# Close the tab/window with Service Desk project B open\r\n# Interact with issues in the queue of Service Desk project A (transition issues, comment, assign, etc)\r\n# Click the My JIRA Home link (logo top left)\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nYou are taken to the top queue in the list for Service Desk Project A.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nYou are taken to the top queue in the list for Service Desk Project B\r\n\r\nh3. Notes\r\nIt looks like the \"last service desk project\" is being set based on the page load and other interactions that are done via REST interactions in the queues do not update this value.  So it's possible to spend much of your day in a Service Desk project and then click the My JIRA Home link and be taken to a project you happened to have opened hours before. \r\n\r\nh3.Workaround\r\nA few options:\r\n* Work within one browser tab/window.\r\n* Refresh the page after you switch back to a Service Desk project from another window/tab with Service Desk open.\r\n",

Steps to Reproduce\r\n# On the Confluence side, go to Confluence Admin console > Further Configuration\r\n# Click Edit and deselect the Quick Navigation checkbox, then Save\r\n# On the JIRA side, go to a Service Desk administration page > Knowledge Base\r\n# Try to search for a Confluence space\r\n\r\nh2. Expected Behavior\r\nThe space appears in the search, auto-completing as the administrator types\r\n\r\nh2. Actual Behavior\r\nNo space appears in the search, even if exact space name or key are inputted\r\n\r\nh2. Additional technical notes for diagnosis\r\nIf using a browser's developer console during the KB space search, the following GET request will be issued:\r\n{code}\r\nhttps://jira.example.com/jira/rest/servicedesk/1/servicedesk/JSDKEY/kb/7846d0ab-681c-3fae-9102-c45968ac4464/space?query=C&_=1488484549051\r\n{code}\r\nAnd it will receive an HTTP 200 response, with the following:\r\n{code}\r\n{\"statusMessage\":\"Quick nav disabled.\",\"query\":\"SPACEKEY\",\"contentNameMatches\":[]}\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nh2. Workaround\r\nEnable Quick Navigation for the duration of the JSD > KB setup.",

Issue Summary\r\n\r\nWhen a user configures their Service Desk create request to contain a field help, the content of the help section will always appear on a single line failing to follow even HTML descriptions like the description section of fields found in JIRA.\r\n\r\nh5. Usage Scenario\r\n\r\nIf a user want to let customer know what each option represents in an orderly manner, the ability to have each entry on a separate line would be great similar to the below:\r\n{code}\r\nLevel 1 - For JIRA Outages, Critical Functions Broken.\r\nLevel 2 - For Major functions breaking or impacts a large number of people\r\nLevel 3 - Non-major functions breaking or impacts a small number of users\r\nLevel 4 - For learning about specific functions.\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nh5. Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n# Go to {{Your Project > Project Settings > Request Type}} page.\r\n# Select the Edit field link.\r\n# In the page that comes up, add the field *Priority*.\r\n# In the field help section, attempt to add a description with multiple lines.\r\n#- On pressing {{Shift+enter}}, instead of creating a new line the parameter is saved.\r\n# If you instead add an HTML script such as the below, it would still appear as a single line:\r\n{code}\r\nLevel 1 - This is a Level 1 </br>\r\nLevel 2 - This is a Level 2 </br>\r\nLevel 3 - This is a Level 3 </br>\r\nLevel 4 - This is a Level 4 </br>\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nh5. Expected Result\r\n\r\nService Desk would obey the above and show the entries on multiple lines.\r\n\r\nh5. Actual Result\r\n\r\nJIRA Service Desk would show all entries on a single line as seen below(server result vs Service Desk result)\r\n\r\n !image-2017-03-20-17-49-10-891.png|thumbnail!  vs  !image-2017-03-20-17-49-50-533.png|thumbnail!

Issue Summary\r\n\r\nWhen a service desk agent closes an issue, if they are using a customized workflow or field configuration that does not make the resolution field compulsory, when the issue is closed, not customer satisfaction survey is sent as JIRA still considers the issue as being unresolved which is the condition required to be met for surveys as stated [here|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/SERVICEDESKSERVER033/Collecting+customer+satisfaction+%28CSAT%29+feedback].\r\n\r\nh5. Usage Scenario\r\n\r\nIn a company that does not mark issues based on resolution and only worry about transitioning the ticket to the closed status, there is no way for them to send out a custom survey for the customer to fill since JIRA would in all scenarios consider the issue as resolved.\r\n\r\nh5. Feature Request\r\n\r\nAllow JIRA Service Desk to recognize the *closed* state as a point to trigger the CSAT survey rather than just the Resolve issue.\r\n\r\nThis would help ensure that teams can have notifications sent to their customers once the the issue issue is closed.\r\n\r\nh5. Existing\r\n\r\nJIRA checks if the resolution field is field when the issue is closed and then triggers the notification.\r\n\r\nh5. Workaround\r\n\r\nUsers can setup a generic resolution for their team when an issue has been resolved so that their issues would always be resolved to this generic resolution instead of having the field blank.",

Problem Definition\r\n\r\nAfter Service Desk 3.1 where there is no need for users to have a license in Confluence to be able to access the Confluence Knowledge Base through Service Desk, there's a few restrictions to accomplish that:\r\n # Have the same user base in both JSD & Confluence. You can accomplish this by using JIRA as a user directory for Confluence or by having JIRA Service Desk and Confluence use Crowd to share a user base.\r\n # Manually create a user in Confluence for every customer in JSD that will need access to the Knowledge Base. You can create a \"customer\" account in Confluence by not assigning it to a group. This will not count against your Confluence license.\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nAdd a specific permission on Confluence to allow Service Desk customers to search KB articles without a Confluence license.\r\nh3. Why this is important\r\n\r\nSince SDS can be fulfilled with new customers frequently, it can be a massive task to create customers account on the Confluence side just to provide them the ability to access KB articles through Service Desk",
