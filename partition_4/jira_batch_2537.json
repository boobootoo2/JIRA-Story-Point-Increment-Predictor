One thing that has always bothered me about your service(and one of the very few I might add) is the access management -> user/email address auto complete.  It&#x27;s very difficult to find the user because often I know the first name last name but not the actual username.  Typing in the users F L name does not auto complete the user correct or even come close.  This makes it difficult to add users to the repo access.\n\nPersonally I think the autocomplete should provide a dropdown of all users that are currently have access to any of your repos.  First Name/Last name search also needs to improve.  Or maybe just a page with a list of users along with their username for the account?  IDK, but I do know what you&#x27;ve got there doesn&#x27;t work too well.",

The action of that \"Edit\" button would be \"fork this repository\", so that you instantiate a fork-followed-by-edit on your fork.\n\nTo see how this is useful, have a look, for example, at the following document from UMich:\n\nhttps://khmer.readthedocs.org\n\n*Note* the yellow \"edit this document\" in the lower right. Click, and follow the top link (to the source for that particular page; works with any arbitrary page, linking back to the correct source page in the repository);\n\nNOTE: github.com has a UI element \"Edit\" - *hover* over it.\n\nNOW: Forking is up to the user who would like to make an edit / correction.  If a user doesn&#x27;t have a bitbucket account, a path to creating one would be provided.\n\nThis has the effect of facilitating a process, and encouraging community participation.\n\nI think this general \"EDIT\" on any given file, with such an associated action path would be most useful.\n\nThanks!",

Of note, this repo should be 100% private.\n\n# https://bitbucket.org/scgbitbucket/kernel-cfid3 is showing recent activity that has nothing to do with my private repo, and is quite far from &#x27;recent&#x27;. I am concerned about code privacy given strange users are showing up in my history.\n# The size of this repo shows as 580 bytes which is definitely wrong.\n# It is difficult to see the recent events when they show up below the readme file for a repo In the case of a kernel, the readme file is small. Perhaps this should show up below the comments, or be user configureable.\n# I have 2 other repos that have been doing an &#x27;import&#x27; since friday. There is no way to cancel the import since they seem to have stalled. If they are too big, please let me know.\\\\\nCould someone please take a look at these issues?",

      "description": "I couldn&#x27;t find an issue about this, so here goes, my first try at reporting anything :)\n\nh1. How it works currently\nThe folder name in a tag/branch tarball is $user-$repo-$node, for example.\n\nI understand that the node ID is unique and specifies very well what the tarball contains, but as SHA hashes are by definition unpredictable, it&#x27;s impossible to automate with them.  For example, in the distro I use and package for, there&#x27;s a simple script that fetches the source, and of course it&#x27;s a lot easier to specify a version string than something random.  Even other than automation, you extract something and get eg. xi-pyyaml-607628291e74/, how do you know later on, which of your xi-pyyaml-* directories is the one you want?\n\nh1. What would be nicer\nTo solve this, I guess it would be better if tag downloads would contain instead the tag name (eg. xi-pyyaml-3.10), and it might also be useful if the branch downloads contained the branch name somehow too, though I&#x27;m not exactly sure about its usefulness.\n\nMaybe for Hg repos where the local revision ID is defined (I know Git can&#x27;t do this), *if* you approach the download from the revid, get a revid into the download&#x27;s folder instead of the node.  Yes, it&#x27;s not unique and precise, but public repos shouldn&#x27;t be history edited anyway.  Still much more human-friendly than the random hash.",

That was very comfy, especially when you needed to create multiple issues in a row. Now i have to make more clicks - issues - create an issue, after creating an issue, i must go to issues one more time only to click \"create issue\" button.\n\nSuggestions:\\\\\na) create a dropdown menu on issues, that will enable user to go to \"create an issue\" page instantly from any page\\\\\nb) make a separate button for this in the menu\\\\\nc) make a button \"add another issue\" that appears on the page that shows up after an issue was created",
