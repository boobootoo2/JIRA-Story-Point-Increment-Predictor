Summary:\r\n\r\nIf we remove the \"Create Issue\" permission from the Project Permissions for \"Service Desk Customer - Portal Access\", it will make the Customers not able to view their previous requests, not just removing the ability to create request. Of course, it will be the same as well for other roles if we did remove the permission.\r\nh3. Steps to reproduce:\r\n # As a Customer, create several requests.\r\n # Login as an Agent and Admin of the SD project.\r\n # Move to the Project Administration.\r\n # Click on Permissions and Edit it.\r\n # Remove the \"Service Desk Customer - Portal Access\" from the \"Create Issue\" permission.\r\n # Login as the previous Customer and access the Portal.\r\n\r\nh3.

We typically have a major server release very 3-5 months and our last major server release (3.2) was in August so it should be available soon.\r\n\r\nThe feature will be identical to the one available on cloud right now and I will provide an update again when the server release is out.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n JIRA Service Desk team\r\n{panel}\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n---JSD-270--- introduced customer organizations to cloud.

If a sender of an email has TNEF enabled, the email sent (and received by the mail handler) will be TNEF-encoded\r\n\r\nQuoting from Outlooks KB: https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/290809\r\n{quote} A TNEF-encoded message contains a plain text version of the message, and a binary attachment that \"packages\" various other parts of the original message. In most cases, the binary attachment is named Winmail.dat, and may include the following information: \r\n* The formatted text version of the message (for example, font information and colors).\r\n* OLE objects (for example, embedded pictures and embedded Microsoft Office documents).\r\n* Special Outlook features (for example, custom forms, voting buttons, and meeting requests).\r\n* Regular file attachments that were added to the original message.{quote}\r\n\r\nThe following is quoted from the same article above as well\r\n{quote}*Sending and Receiving Concerns*\r\nWhen an e-mail client that does not understand TNEF receives a message that contains TNEF information, the following are the three common results:\r\n* The plain text version of the message is received and it contains an attachment named Winmail.dat. The Winmail.dat attachment does not contain any useful information when you open it because it is in the special TNEF format.\r\n* Note: Some users have reported receiving a Win.dat attachment.{quote}\r\n\r\nThis is exactly what is happening to JSD mail handler at the moment. If a user sends an email with attachment using Outlook with TNEF enabled, the message is added to the ticket just fine, but Winmail.dat will be attached to the ticket, instead of the original intended attachment\r\n\r\nh3. Suggestion\r\nHave the mail handler understand TNEF to decode Winmail.dat and attach the proper attachment",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSDCLOUD-4382].\r\n{panel}\r\nh3. Problem Definition\r\n\r\nWhen a customer is part of one single organization, any request created by this customer either from the UI, or by email will be automatically shared with this organization.\r\n\r\nIt can be a problem if the customer did not have any intention to share the request with the organization:\r\n - when creating the request from the UI, the organization is selected by default so the customer needs to be aware of that and manually set the request as private\r\n - however, when the issue is created by email, the situation is worse as the customer has absolutely no control over the fact that the request will be shared with the organization, so there is no workaround for this scenario\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution for this feature request\r\n # Completely turn off the Request Sharing within the user's Organization.\r\n # Or add a new setting allowing project admins to either:\r\n -- Set any request private by default\r\n -- Or to automatically share issues created via the UI or by email with the single organization the customer is part of\r\n\r\nh3. Release notes for solution implemented in 4.7.x\r\n\r\nPer [https://confluence.atlassian.com/servicedesk/jira-service-desk-4-7-x-release-notes-987143432.html#JiraServiceDesk4.7.xreleasenotes-private], the 2 following changes have been introduced in 4.7.x:\r\n - Customer portal: All new requests are private, regardless of how many organizations you\u2019re in. You can still easily share them by choosing your organization in the drop-down menu when raising a request\r\n - Email: If you\u2019re part of only one organization, new requests will still be shared by default. Don\u2019t like it? You can go to Administration > Applications > Jira Service Desk configuration, and make all requests private by default.\r\n\r\n(!)\u00a0Please note that it is possible to disable the new behavior introduced in the *Customer Portal* by following the steps below:\r\n - Navigate to the following page to access the Dark Features page:\r\n{code:java}\r\n<baseUrl>/secure/admin/SiteDarkFeatures!Default.jspa\r\n{code}\r\n - Enter *sd.customer.share.default.private.disabled* in the field *Enable dark feature*, click on the *Add* button, and verify that the dark feature *sd.customer.share.default.private.disabled* is listed in the page:\r\n !DarkFeature.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nAfter you followed these steps, if a customer is a member of exactly 1 organization, this organization will be automatically selected in the request creation form (as it used to be the case before JSD 4.7.x",

Expected Results\r\nOn the email notification, if clicking on the \"View Request\", user should be redirected to the issue in Service Desk.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nOn the email notification, if clicking on the \"View Request\", user is being redirected to the instance only.\r\n \r\nh3. Notes\r\nIt seems that when the request type is empty, JSD can no longer find the necessary info to fill out the _requestURL_ variable.\r\n\r\nh3.Workaround\r\nAdd a valid Request Type in the ticket. This can be done manually or using Automation rule as per [this KB article|https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirakb/automatically-set-customer-request-type-when-issue-is-created-via-jira-859463969.html].\r\n",

The idea is these alerts or notices can then be sent to service staff instead of one member having to forward the emails just to get lost in someones inbox.\r\nhowever as the appliances do not have incoming email and often don't even have real addresses (some send from servername@local.local) we would like to setup the project to never send emails (setup account, new issue, comments, resolved) to the \"customers\" instead just to accept the email and create an event. I tried changing notifications to none but it is still sending some. is there anyway at all to disable these? ",

Existing Behavior\r\n\r\nCurrently a JIRA Service Desk customer is able to add attachments through the portal but there is no option to delete attachments through the portal.\r\n\r\nAs an administrator I would like to give my customers the ability to delete their own attachments by clicking a link in the customer portal.\r\nh3. Suggested behavior:\r\n\r\nAdd delete attachment link to portal next to attachment name or provide some interface to manage attachments through customer portal.\r\nh3. Workaround:\r\n\r\nCustomers do have the permission to delete attachments and are able to do so. There is no link available, the customer would need to generate their own delete attachment link.\r\n* The permission comes from having \"Service Desk Customer - Portal Access\" listed under \"Delete own Attachments\" in the permission scheme attached to the project.  \r\n\r\nh6. Example:\r\n\r\nIn the portal the attachment link is {{BASE_URL/servicedesk/customershim/secure/attachment/10000/10000_atlassian-bonfire-plugin-2.9.13.jar?fromIssue=10003}}\r\n\r\nThe delete attachment link would be {{BASE_URL/servicedesk/customershim/secure/DeleteAttachment!default.jspa?id=10003&deleteAttachmentId=10000&from=issue}}",

It would be great to be able to individually export the rule and restore it locally.\r\n\r\nThis way plenty of time can be saved on troubleshooting customer issues and support does not need to ask whole XML backup as sometimes customers are not willing to share that.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Problem Definition\r\nCurrently JEPP stores all mails fetched from the mail server into AO_2C4E5C_MAILITEMCHUNK table and keeps them in the table for a period of time (*45 days by default,* *minimum 14 days*).\r\nThis causes the DB size to increase really quick.\r\n\r\nThis table's main purpose is to make sure Service Desk will process all mails fetched from the mail server and, in case of any problems, keep the email for reprocessing in the future so it isn't lost.\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\nWe should remove the mails successfully processed right after they are processed to avoid storing information that won't be needed.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround 1 (if not implemented already)\r\nReduce the mail retention interval from the default 45 days to 14 via JIRA -> Settings -> Global Mail - > DB Cleaner\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround 2\r\nThe retention period can be set via a direct database update. Please reach out to support for further guidance on this.\r\n\r\nNote: In case of performing Workaround 1 and Workaround 2, be mindful of a potential impact on the database server. In case of MS SQL for example, temb db and MS SQL will grow extremely quickly on cleaning up large tables, so best to perform both these workarounds in a controlled and staged manner",

Suggested Solution\r\nCurrently this is allowed, specifically you can do it with the following:\r\n\r\n# Restrict customer portal access to role-based.\r\n# Configure a role to have a certain group.\r\n# Add LDAP users to that group and sync.\r\n# Those users will now be treated as customers.\r\n\r\nIf we don't want them to consume licenses, they can be removed from the application access groups that are configured and only be a member of the appropriate JSD customer group.\r\n \r\nh3. Note\r\nThis is only for JIRA Server. If you are using JIRA On-Demand, then it's not possible and please refer to [JSD-1015|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSD-1015].",

Instead of Captcha, we implemented the honeypot technique to prevent spam bots from creating accounts on the customer portal.

Steps to reproduce\r\n # Go to JIRA Administration -> System -> General Configuration -> Edit Settings\r\n # Change Mode to Public and CAPTCHA on signup to ON\r\n # Go to JIRA Administration -> Applications -> JIRA SERVICE DESK -> Configuration -> Turn ON Public signup\r\n # Sign up a new account from JIRA and then from Customer Portal\r\n\r\nh4. Expected behavior\r\n\r\nCAPTCHA is displayed on both signup pages.\r\nh4. Actual behavior\r\n\r\nCAPTCHA is only displayed on JIRA signup page. It's not available on Customer Portal signup page:\r\n !sdsignup.png|thumbnail!\r\nh4.

Summary\r\nIt is possible to saved a broken filter to a queue when the JQL query returns an uncaught exception. This causes the Queues view to display no queues and prevent the creation of new queues.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Create a queue with a valid filter. e.g: {{resolution  =  Unresolved}}\r\n# Edit the queue\r\n# Change to  {{resolution  > Unresolved}}\r\n# Save queue\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nThe queue is not saved and a message is displayed indicating the the JQL filter is invalid.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nThe screen doesn't change as if the \"Save\" didn't work but the filter was saved in the background.\r\nLoading the queues again shows no queues.\r\n\r\nh3. Notes:\r\nThe problem is actually caused by an Uncaught exception returned by JIRA when searching {{resolution < unresolved}} but JIRA Service Desk could prevent the JQL to be saved in these scenarios. JSD correctly prevents the saving a JQL that is invalid if it doesn't error.\r\n\r\nh3.Workaround\r\nFind the queues on the project:\r\n{noformat}\r\nSELECT * from \"AO_54307E_QUEUE\" where \"PROJECT_ID\" in (select id from project where pkey = '<PKEY>');\r\n{noformat}\r\nFind the filter that is broken by searching JIRA using the same JQL\r\nUpdate the queue in the database to a working JQL.\r\n\r\n",
