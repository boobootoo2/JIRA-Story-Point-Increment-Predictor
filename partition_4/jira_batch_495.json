Summary\r\n\r\nWhen no issues are opened during a reported time period, it is more useful to management(who is reading the report) to see that 100% of a goal was met rather than 0%. With the current design of the '% Met' report options, it is impossible to tell whether a bunch of tickets have been raised and breached, or no tickets have been raised at all.\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Use the default SLA goal configuration in a pristine environment\r\n # Create a new test issue at the \"Highest\" severity\r\n # Immediately transition the issue to closed\r\n # Create a new custom report that displays 'Time to resolution - % Met'\r\n # Set the report to 'Past 48 hours'\r\n # Notice the spike from 0% to 100% in the last hour\r\n # Wait an hour without opening any other issues\r\n # Notice the last hour moves back to 0%\r\n\r\nThe same behavior happens when 'Time to first response - % Met' is selected.\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nDuring periods where 'No issues' are found, the goal of responding to or resolving zero tickets has essentially been achieved. This should be reflected as 100% met.\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nPeriods where 'No issues' are found reflect as 0% met. This information doesn't reflect whether issues are not being responded to or if no issues came in at all.\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nWhile it is possible to us the 'Time to first response - Breached' and 'Time to resolution - Breached' options to get similar information from the opposite direction, the '% met' reports contain totals for all of the incoming tickets. This is potentially more useful because you might be able to extrapolate why issues are breaching(e.g., higher volume).",

Expected Results\r\n\r\nThe Insight field value is rendered properly.\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nThe Insight field shows an error state on the queues.\r\n\r\nThe reason this happens is that when retrieving the Insight object details to display on the queues, the Insight backend performs an excessive amount of calls to fetch user details for Jira user accounts linked to the object via object attributes. When there are too many of these calls to fetch user details, the primary call to fetch the object details times out, leaving the frontend with incomplete object data, therefore displaying an error state.\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nBecause this problem is related to timeouts, it\u00a0_may_ be solved by a page refresh, although this is probably unlikely as the timeouts may happen quite consistently.\u00a0\r\n\r\nCurrently there is no known suitable workaround for this behavior.

Expected Results\r\n\r\nThe rule will execute all the actions on behalf of the Actor\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nThe rule executes the actions on behalf of the Actor until the *Approve/Decline request* action, then the next actions are executed on behalf of *Automation for Jira* user.\r\n\r\nThis happens because, at the moment. there is no way to run an *Approval/Decline* step using impersonation neither via REST API on JSM, this will return a 403 error behind the curtains. As a result of this, Automation incorrectly assumes this 403 happened because of an invalid bearer token and blocks the user from being an Actor for a period of time (24H).\r\n\r\nWhen the block happens *all the rules* that are configured to run on behalf of the user will be executed on behalf of the *Automation for Jira* user for the next 24 hours.\r\nh3.
