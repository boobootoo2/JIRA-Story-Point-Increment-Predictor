Steps to Reproduce:\nThere is a new issue which has come up which affects all issue collectors being served from https://jira.atlassian.com. Current analysis is the following.\n# User is logged in to https://support.atlassian.com or https://confluence.atlassian.com. This means that the new Unified Login for Atlassian (https://id.atlassian.com) knows the User.\n# User has never accessed https://jira.atlassian.com after the unified login process was introduced.\n# User opens *their JIRA instance* and accesses GreenHopper.\n# GreenHopper throws up a red banner saying Syntax Error for the script feedback.js.\n\nh3. Analysis\nThe feedback.js download request from GreenHopper goes to https://jira.atlassian.com and is intercepted by the Unified Login and taken to the 'Merge Accounts' page (so instead of the feedback.js the html content of the 'Merge Accounts' page is downloaded)\n\nh3. Workaround\nAccess https://jira.atlassian.com and complete the 'Merge Accounts' process. Once done, do a hard refresh of the GreenHopper window (CMD/CTRL+SHIFT+R)",

      "description": "Root problem:\nThe only way epics currently disappear in plan mode is by marking them as \"Done\" (Epic Status field). If a user closes an epic using workflow transitions beforehand though, the epic is made read-only, so marking an epic as \"Done\" after that will fail.\n\nWhy we are where we are:\nWhen we originally discussed how we wanted to mark epics as done, we decided to use a separate field so we we wouldn't have to handle workflows. A separate field gets around all these problems, so was a good solution for the problem. In case of the workflow option we would most likely have looked at the resolution field only. If there is a value => epic is done, if it is empty => epic isn't done yet. We could have set that field instead, but it would have been unclear which resolution to choose from, plus it possibly would have made the issue inconsistent with the workflow configured for it.\n\nProposed change:\nI still believe using epic status is a good solution, but we could improve the current functionality by *also* applying the logic mentioned above. So, if EITHER the epic status is \"Done\" OR the epic has a resolution then we regard an epic as done. Had we implemented this logic upfront we could even have gotten around the upgrade task that tried filling in epic status values for already resolved issues :)",

Any subissue is not shown in these charts at all.

Approach for JIRA 6.0\n\nJIRA code base:\n* Modify JIRA's {{version}} table to include a start date column\n* Make the above schema change on JIRA 5.2.x branch so that downgrades continue to work.\n* Augment the RESTful table in JIRA's Project Admin page for Versions to show this start date and allow editing of it\n* Augment the REST representation of versions to include start date\n* Add the start date field to the JIRA API for a Version object\n\nGH code base:\n* Make GH aware of the capability of storing start date in either JIRA or GH, depending on the JIRA version.\n* Migrate data stored in GH for start date to JIRA storage if available.\n\n(!) Development Notes (!)\n\nQ: How will adding a startDate to a previously released version affect the issues that apply to it?\nA: (/) If a previously released version has a release date, the new start date will be validated against the release date.\n\nQ: How will adding a startDate affect issues that have been Archived?\nA: (/) Changes to version data do not affect issues.\n\nQ: Which timezone setting will the startDate follow, user's or system's?\nA: (/) Start date and release date are both stored in the JVM system time zone.\n\nQ: Can you remove the startDate after adding it?\nA: (/) Yes.\n\nQ: What is one way to get the startDate to come after the releaseDate?\nA: (/) Not possible.\n\nQ: What happens when you add a startDate to a version that has been released but has no releaseDate?\nA: (/) Start date can be added without release date.\n\nQ: Is there a special place in the database this column/row will go? Depending on the database used, is there a way for this location to be already taken, and/or do we recycle a location/field ID? We need to protect against overwrites.\nA: (/) The field {{startdate}} did not exist in the table {{projectversion}} before now.\n\nQ: How is the data synchronised between GH AO tables and JIRA?\nA: (/) When the Version meta data is asked for in GH, it will check to see if it exists in JIRA as well.
