When I use keygen I tell it to store the key on my private drive rather than the default, then copy and paste that key into the SSH keys under my account, but then bitbucket can&#x27;t seem to locate that key to use it.  I can get it to recognize a key placed in the default location on the C drive of the computer (on the hard drive of the specific computer I&#x27;m using) but not on any other drive, making it necessary to generate then delete a new key every time I log onto any one of the hundreds of computers here...  I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s an easy solution, but I&#x27;m not familiar enough with all of this to see it...\n\nThe error I&#x27;m receiving (when trying to pull/push after storing the key to anything but the default location) is:\n\nPermission denied <publickey>.\\\\\nfatal: Could not read from remote repository.\\\\\nPlease make sure you have the correct access rights and the repository exists.\n\nSuggestions?\n\nThanks so much!",

I&#x27;m fairly quick with responses so I can help out in whatever debugging is neccessary (I can be available during China hours, since I&#x27;m located in EST, to help gather more debugging information).\n\nThanks,\\\\\n~Ravid",

      "description": "When you have a \"log\" entry in an issue which includes \"attached\" and a comment, such as https://bitbucket.org/zzzeek/alembic/issue/107#comment-4100590, the actual link to the attachment in that comment is not necessarily correct.  In the case of this specific comment, it appears that the attachment is actually stored under a path that matches a previous name for this issue tracker, \"alembic_git\".    The reason for this appears to be that the hard-coded path of an attachment comes out in an issue export as the \"changed_from\" field of a \"log\" entry (which also appears to be undocumented save for a subtle implication in the documentation&#x27;s example import, and also it makes no sense why \"changed_from\" would be used for this).   It&#x27;s also impossible (or at least, tedious) to predict what this link would be when making an import from an entirely different issue system like Trac, and if you can predict it, it still appears that the name of the target repo has to be hardwired in the link making the issue export file non-portable as far as links to attachments in comments are concerned.\n\nThe way this should work is, the Bitbucket issue itself knows the actual URL of the attachment, it has no problem listing it at the top of the the issue, so it shouldn&#x27;t need be expressed in literal form in the import or export at all, and the link within the comment should just work just as well as it does on the top of the issue display.\n\nSorry I know this is a bit picky but I&#x27;m considering giving up control of my Trac issues for the first time in 8 years ... :)",

But you cannot push. Thus I recommend extending deployment keys adding an option allowing the user to choose between read only (current behaviour, should be default) and (rw, opt-in) - for some special use cases like mine\n\nOf course I could create a new user and grant access to the repository. However I feel that&#x27;s overkill.\n\nI talked to Jesse Yowell (support) who suggested me creating a ticket (BBS-7401)\n\nMarc Weber",
