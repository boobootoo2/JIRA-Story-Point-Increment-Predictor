Problem Definition\r\n\r\nIn a JIRA Service Desk, whenever an End-User submits a Request within an instance\u2019s Customer Portal, if they miss a required field in the form, the error may not be visible on the screen.\r\n\r\nFor example, if I\u2019m creating a new Request in someone\u2019s Customer Portal, and I forget to fill in a Required field that isn\u2019t visible in my window anymore, there isn\u2019t any direct prompt that would warn me of the error. Unless I scroll back up and notice the error underneath the field itself, the Request page just looks like it lagged out and isn\u2019t accepting the request.\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Create request type with multiple fields, mark only the summary field required.\r\n # To make the form long, add field help with line breaks. The following repeated over and over will make the form long:\r\n ** \r\n{noformat}\r\n \\\\test \\\\test \\\\test \\\\test \\\\test \\\\test  \r\n\r\n\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\n # Create request in portal. Leave summary empty and scroll to where summary is no longer visible.\r\n # Attempt to submit request using create button\r\n ** Notice the form jumps slightly the first time you click create. This is the error appearing higher in the page. The error does not become visible on the screen.\r\n ** Clicking the create button again does nothing. The button itself appears to respond as it flashes when clicked. Nothing else happens.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nError becomes immediately visible to customer so that they are aware that an error was encountered.\r\nh3. Proposed Solutions:\r\n * List of the errors near the Create button\r\n * Help message next to the Create button, for example \"Errors above! Scroll up, fix, and try submitting again\"\r\n * Auto-Focus the window to the closest Error.\r\n * If multiple errors, auto focus or auto scroll to top-most error. The user would need to scroll down to create and would encounter the other errors that need to be fixed.",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSDCLOUD-4026].\n  {panel}\n\nh3. Problem Definition\r\nWhen a customer has a Service Desk issue linked to another issue. It would be good to be able to set up an automation so that when a linked issue changes to a different state, the Support issue is also transitioned so that the Agent can take any required actions on the case.\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\nAllow a customer to set up an Automation trigger that would fire when a linked issue changes status to a specific state.\r\n \r\nh3. Workaround \r\nUse a third party Automation to listen for relevant events such as the [JIRA Misc Workflow Extension|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.innovalog.jmwe.jira-misc-workflow-extensions/server/overview].

      "description": "h3. Summary\r\nIf you have a user that has been renamed and then create a new user with the same user name as the previously renamed user the new user will not be able to be queried by the workload report.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\nCreate a user with the username of 'test'\r\nNote app_user table should show user_key of 'test' and lower_user_name of 'test\r\nGo into user management and change the username of test to 'test1'\r\nCreate a new user with the username of 'test' as it's now available.\r\nCheck the app_user table, the new user will have a user_key similar to this format: \"ID10600\"\r\nGo into service desk and assign an issue to the newly created user\r\nGo to the workload report and click on the number in the 'issues in progress' column.\r\nQuery is launched with the following JQL: assignee = ID10600 AND resolution = Unresolved AND project = SD\r\nReceive an error message that says:  The value 'ID10600' does not exist for the field 'assignee'.\r\n\r\nBefore the original test user was renamed this functioned correctly and you could click on the numeric and get issue results.  The only way to get results on the new user is to manually modify the JQL to replace the ID with the lower user name value.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nClicking the numeric issues in progress should return results for users that were created with the same user name as a previously renamed user\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nUsers that have an 'IDxxxxxx' for user_key do not return results by clicking on the issues in progress number on the workload report.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nh3.Workaround\r\nManually change the JQL results to the lower_user_name value in the query.",

In the quick search field, type <Project Key> \"client abc\"\r\n2. Open normal JIRA search and filter Project=<KEY> AND text ~ \"Client abc\"\r\n\r\nThis then takes them to search results for normal JIRA issues, and not the JIRA Service Desk.

We understand some of you who use this feature regularly will be upset but based on our usage analytics only 0.05% of our comments made have used this feature. Rather then continue to add complexity to JIRA Service Desk by adding more controls to toggle this feature, we believe it is better to remove this feature completely.\r\n\r\nIf you really do want a similar functionality back I will recommend voting on the ticket: [JSD-631| https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSD-631] Auto reply template feature, where we will be able to model similar behaviour and experience with canned responses.\r\n\r\n-- JIRA Service Desk team\r\n\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\n\r\nh2.Summary\r\n\r\nService Desk pre-populated comments are missing.\r\n\r\n\r\n# The switch in user profile to enable pre-populated comments.\r\n# Pre-populated comments are gone.\r\n\r\nAffected instance seems to be running JIRA Service Desk {{3.2.0-OD-15-001-D20160604T051209}}.",

Summary\r\nWe should have a comparison document that shows the Pro's and Con's of using a JIRA Service Desk Mail Handler compared to a JIRA Mail Handler.\r\n\r\nSome areas that could be covered:\r\n- User Experience/Interface for JIRA Service Desk Mail Handler is tailored for JIRA Service Desk Experience\r\n- How The Mail handler reacts to an Unknown User E-mailing JIRA. \r\n- Service Desk Mail Handler does not delete E-mails, and the JIRA mail handler does.\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\nNo known documentation exists.\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nSomething that clearly explains the differences in the Mail Handler would help our customers make better use of the products.\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nCustomers Experience is to look at: \r\n- [Receiving requests by email|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/SERVICEDESK/Receiving+requests+by+email] \r\n- [Creating Issues and Comments from Email|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Creating+Issues+and+Comments+from+Email]\r\n\r\nAmongst other documentation to try to assemble a good understanding of the functionality.\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Notes\r\nIt would be also good to update the Documentation to be more explicit about the fact different 'Mail Handlers' Exist.",
