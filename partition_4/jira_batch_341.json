Problem Definition\r\n\r\n* Project permissions currently take precedence over Scrum/Kanban board(JQL filter) permissions\r\n* A JQL filter is used to display issues on Scrum/Kanban boards\r\n* Boards that are attached to projects are not accessible to those who do not have the appropriate permissions to view that project.  For Example:\r\n-* User 1 has access to both \"Scrum\" and \"Project X\" projects\r\n-* User 2 doesn't have access to the \"Scrum\" project\r\n-* User 2 has access to the \"Project X\" project\r\n-* The board filter displays issues from the \"Project X\" and \"Scrum\" projects\r\n-* User 2 needs to be able to access the \"Scrum\" board\r\n\r\n||Board settings||\r\n|!board_settings.png|thumbnail!|\r\n\r\n||Boards user 1 has access to||Boards user 2 has access to||\r\n| !user_1.png|thumbnail!  |  !user_2.png|thumbnail! |\r\n\r\n||Boards user 2 has access to after \"Scrum\" board location has been changed to a user||\r\n| !user_2_after location change.png|thumbnail! |\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n* Allow board(JQL filter) permissions to take precedence over project permissions\r\n* Project permissions should still apply, i.e. if a user doesn't have permission to view issues in a particular project, then issues from that particular project should still be hidden\r\n\r\nh3. Why this is important\r\n* In cases where the board filter displays issues from multiple projects, there is a requirement for a user to view a board that's attached to a project, but not have permissions on the project\r\n* Having to change the location of the board can confuse users on the project as it will seem like the board had disappeared from the project\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround \r\n* Change the location of the board from a project to a Jira user - {{board settings(...) > General > Location}} .  The board will no longer appear on the project but will be accessible by anyone with the appropriate board(JQL filter) permissions\r\n",

      "description": "Jira 7.1 introduced the requirement that the Jira server should be able to perform requests against itself on its base URL, i.e. the same URL that the user's browser uses to access Jira.\r\n\r\nThis behaviour has previously been filed as a bug in JRASERVER-59892 (resolved as \"Not a bug\") and the setup needed to allow Jira server loopback calls has been documented in [https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirakb/how-to-fix-gadget-titles-showing-as-__msg_gadget-813697086.html] (linked to from JRASERVER-59892)\r\n\r\nOur use case makes it impossible to implement the advice given in the above support page, and this issue contains a description of a workaround we have implemented as well as a suggested improvement to Jira allowing customers sharing our problem an easier way to configure their server.\r\n\r\n*Use case*\r\n\r\nOur Jira instance is available on two different domains: Users on the company internal network use [https://jira.company.net|https://jira.company.net/], whereas external users use [https://jira.f5.company.net|https://jira.f5.company.net/] (imaginary domains used to examplify). The latter is a reverse proxy with an additional layer of two factor authentication, required by our corporate security policy for access from external networks.\r\n\r\nWhen a user accesses a Jira dashboard through [https://jira.f5.company.net|https://jira.f5.company.net/] the Jira server attempts to do a number of GET /rest/gadget requests against the same base URL. Obviously these fail since the Jira server does not have the required reverse proxy session established. The result is that the user experiences the problems described in the above mentioned issue and support page.\r\n\r\n*Our workaround*\r\n\r\nWe have worked around this issue by making the Jira server call itself directly instead of through the reverse proxy. This was achieved by defining jira.f5.company.net as 127.0.0.1 in /etc/hosts on the Jira server and by adding the jira.f5.company.net SSL certificate to the server.\r\n\r\nAlthough things work as desired with this setup we consider it an ugly hack (especially since we have to copy a fairly sensitive SSL certificate to a server to which it doesn't really belong) and we would very much like to see Atlassian provide a configuration option allowing us to achieve the desired behaviour in a less hackish manner.\r\n\r\n*Suggested improvement*\r\n\r\nWe propose that you add a new configuration parameter to Jira containing the base URL that should be used for internal lookups. Using this parameter we can direct the Jira server to itself by using Jira configuration rather than hacking /etc/hosts. The parameter should by default not be set, and in this case Jira should exhibit its current behaviour.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0",
