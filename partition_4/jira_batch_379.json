Our sales team will have a different list of priorities to our support team for instance. In JIRA Agile Classic, we do this by given them access to a planning board for their issues and associate the context to a Ranking field (e.g. \"Sales Rank\", \"Support Rank\", etc.). This allows our stakeholders to drag and drop issues into the order that they find important. These lists are used as input to our sprint planning meeting. The independent ranking fields mean there is no accidental interference between the various stakeholders' lists when moving issues up or down in their own list.\n\nWith JIRA Agile, this is no longer possible (due to the fact that there is only one global rank field). We tried this once, but each time a stakeholder changes the ranking of an issue in their list, it has a side effect of changing the rank in other lists (due to the fact the ranking is global). This led to prioritisation chaos. \n\nThe lack of support for our use case(s) forces us to use JIRA Classic. Once JIRA Classic ceases to exist - the way we work will no longer be supported by JIRA at all. We are thus forced to stay on an older version of JIRA. \n\nWe would like to be able to configure a board to have a specific ranking field other than the global ranking field, just like you can in the current Agile Classic view.\n",
