E.g.:\n\nhttp://bitbucket.org/ned/coveragepy/src/ad548b94dda6/doc/index.rst\n\nGithub has better Python support that us? That&#x27;s so not cool...lol.

At this point, I will get a progress bar and it will tell me that my repo is being created. Once complete, the repo will be available again with my full history and everything.  I would say this probably happens almost every day on my first commit, though occasionally it won&#x27;t.\n\nI haven&#x27;t noticed it happening on my other repos, but I don&#x27;t push or pull them as frequently, so that may be why.  If it is unique to this repo, it may be because the name of the repo is &#x27;config&#x27;.  I have also noticed that on at least one occasion, the link from my dashboard pointed at &#x27;.config&#x27; rather than &#x27;config&#x27;, and I had to manually enter the URL to get the repo to recreate.\n\nI searched for this issue before reporting it, and found at least one more that might be related (#1841), but was marked as resolved.  I wasn&#x27;t sure if I should tag onto that one, so I made a new issue and you guys can link or mark as duplicate as appropriate.\n\nThank you.",
