I&#x27;d like to be able to provide a search parameter to only return records that have changed since a certain point.\n\nIt&#x27;s likely possible to get everything I need triggered with hooks (at least for commits and pull requests), but I didn&#x27;t see an endpoint to configure hooks on repositories.  Given a large number of private repositories, I&#x27;m not overly excited about the change management that would be needed to ensure each repository always gets the correct hooks enabled.\n\nThanks!",

This is especially bad on older issues which have hundreds of watchers.\n\nSee for example [here|https://bitbucket.org/site/master/issue/2874/ability-to-search-source-code-bb-39], and [here|https://bitbucket.org/site/master/issue/2323/create-a-way-to-group-repositories].\n\nI would suggest some automated moderation here.

The feature would satisfy the following requirements:\n\n# Deployment is either manual (i.e, I can manually deploy changes, and not automatically push them immediately as they become ready), or automatic (i.e., automatically push changes to the live production server whenever the central repo is updated). Manual vs. automatic choice is based on setup.\n# Pushing code results in updated changes, without a copy of the repo files (no .git or .hg directory). This is a security feature, no need to have full history in a live server\n# When in manual mode, be able to push a certain version (not necessarily the latest).\n# Be able to push via SSH.\n\nThis would help tremendously in deploying source code, and helps integrate production environment with Bitbucket.\n\nThanks.",

In the Quick Subtasks plugin, it is documented that you can set the issuetype for a task by appending \u201c/ issuetype:\u201dBugfix Subtask\u201d.  But, when you go to add multiple subtasks, the dialog box has an issuetype drop-down and can only be set to one value.  If the issuetype is set by appending it to the text, the drop-down value always overrides it.\n\nThis causes the user to have to separately add their subtasks based on the issuetype instead of being able to add all of them in one go regardless of issuetype.  Is this the intended functionality and the documentation is wrong, or is this a bug?  It would be very beneficial if specifying the issuetype would override the drop-down value.",

However, as noted [here|https://bitbucket.org/site/master/issue/6589/markdown-relative-link-to-image-and-other#comment-17834020], those issues address relative-linking from one file (e.g., a {{README}}) to another (e.g., an image) within a given project&#x27;s repository. That&#x27;s useful, but IMHO It Would Be Better to also to support relative links from a wikipage to a file in the project&#x27;s repository. E.g., suppose\n\n# One has a project with name={{project_name}} rooted @ {{.../project_name/}}\n# The project&#x27;s owner creates a readme visible as project overview at the canonical location={{.../project_name/README}}\n# The project&#x27;s owner creates a wiki at the canonical location={{.../project_name/wiki/}}\n# The project&#x27;s owner creates a folder/subdir @ {{.../project_name/images/}} and commits files to the project repo in that folder/subdir.\n\nCurrently (i.e., since the fix to [issue#=6315|https://bitbucket.org/site/master/issue/6315/relative-urls-in-readmemd-files-only-work] and its duplicates), the following relative-link syntaxes (doubtless et al) work (as demonstrated by my [project={{rst_link_test}}|https://bitbucket.org/tlroche/rst_link_test]:\n\n# from {{.../project_name/README}} to {{.../project_name/images/image_file}} with the following syntax:\n\n## {{/images/image_file}}\n## {{./images/image_file}}\n## {{images/image_file}}\n# from {{.../project_name/wiki/Home}} to an {{image_file}} in the project&#x27;s Downloads with the (sole) syntax {{../downloads/Jen_Sorensen_PandP-poster-ForWeb.png}} as demonstrated [here|https://bitbucket.org/tlroche/rst_link_test/wiki/Home#rst-header-an-image]\n\nI realize that [you currently intend to keep wiki repositories separate from their project&#x27;s repo|https://bitbucket.org/site/master/issue/7874/incorporate-wiki-in-source-repository-bb]. That being said, the [currently-supported behavior|https://bitbucket.org/tlroche/rst_link_test/wiki/Home#rst-header-id28] seems to demonstrate that there is no technical impediment to a wikipage relative-linking to a file in its project&#x27;s repo.",
