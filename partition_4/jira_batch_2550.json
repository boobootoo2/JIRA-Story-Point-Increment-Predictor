Cleaned that up though, and did a push --mirror. Smartgit shows the file diffs normally and cloning the repo from bitbucket to local destination also gets me everything in the right state.\n\nSo i&#x27;m not sure if this is just my fault or if there is a little bug in the bitbucket interface, as other interfaces do show the diffs.\n\nBest,\\\\\nDee",

It has an item \"Issues (count)\" that refers to page with a list of currently open issues (with \"new\" or \"open\" statuses).\n\nWorking for relatively long time on my project I mentioned that the count of open issues in menu item is not equal to the count of issues in page&#x27;s title (that is just above issues&#x27; list and represents a valid value). To be more precise, the count of open issues in menu item is less than the count in page&#x27;s title by one. E.g, when count of open issues is 14 I see \"Issues (13)\" in menu item.\n\nI&#x27;m not sure whether such behavior correct or wrong but probably there can be page&#x27;s caching issue.\n\nA problem becomes apparent on my private repo&#x27;s page: https://bitbucket.org/Arrenda/arrenda.ru/issues?status=new&status=open",

I have some issues with this view however:\n\n# its very liberal in its use of space and only shows ten repos,\n# this is especially annoying as there do not seem to be sorting options\n\nSo therefore I would hope something along the lines of the following enhancements would be considered:\n\n# condense the view, making the gravatar images optional/smaller and keeping all info on one line\n# have an option to set how many repos to show on one page, and increase the default from the current 10\n# have the option to sort repos at least on the following: 1. name of repo, 2. name of user/owner, 3. both 1 and 2, so as currently printed, 4. creation time, 5. last update time\n\nI thought its best to flag this as minor, though its kinda major for me as well, as it would greatly increase my use of the site. I have to go to dashboard now to get some kind of normal listing of repositories.\n\nThank you for considering,\\\\\nBest,\\\\\nDee",
