Summary\r\nSince this week's release (09/28/2015) artifact's folders are being published as links, not as folders (full path link until the file instead of links to each folder)\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Generate an artifact which file is within some folders\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nEach folder within the artifact should be a link to the next folder within the tree until the final file is reached. e.g.\r\n{code}--folder1\r\n      |_folder2\r\n             |_folder3\r\n                    |_file.ext{code}\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nThe first level within the artifact is a full link to the file directly. e.g.\r\n{code}folder1\\folder2\\folder3\\file.ext{code}\r\nh3. Notes\r\nI believe this is due to the back slashes in the path since we run a Linux environment on Cloud which considers forward slashes.\r\nThis seems to only impact Window instances.\r\nh3.Workaround\r\nNo Workaround yet.",

      "description": "h3. Summary\r\n\r\nSuppose you have Bamboo \"Build Plan\" set up to delete \"Plan Branches\" in case it detects that a branch has been removed from the remote repository after a certain period of time (say the default 7 days).\r\n\r\nIn case you remove the branch from the repository and Bamboo detects the branch removal, it will delete the \"Plan Branch\" after 7 days even if you recreate the Branch on the remote repository in between.\r\n\r\nh3. Details of a use case\r\nNotes from a Bamboo user:\r\n{quote}\r\nI had a branch plan that was disabled (as expected) after the underlying git branch was removed (merged to master). The next day I re-created the git branch and manually went and re-enabled the disabled branch plan and kicked off a new build with my new changes.\r\n\r\nAbout an hour later, my branch plan was just about to finish but then the page auto-refreshed and showed me a 'page not found' error. The branch plan had been deleted by the 3am scheduled clean-up. I confirmed this from the server logs:\r\n{noformat}\r\n2015-09-15 03:01:04,003 INFO [scheduler_Worker-8] [BranchExpiryJob] Deleting Plan Branch 'Puppet Continuous Deployment - Puppet CD - BUILDENG-9109-downloads-known-hosts' of Plan 'Puppet Continuous Deployment - Puppet CD' since the VCS branch was deleted 1 days ago.\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nAt this point in time, the branch and branch plan were not deleted or inactive, so it is expected that Bamboo should not have deleted it.\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Install Bamboo and Stash\r\n# Connect them via AppLinks\r\n# Create a \"Build Plan\" and link it to one of your repositories in Stash\r\n# Configure the [Automatic branch management section|https://confluence.atlassian.com/bamboo/using-plan-branches-289276872.html#Usingplanbranches-Automaticbranchmanagement] of your \"Build Plan\" to *Create plan branches for all new branches*. That will automatically set up the *Delete branches after a period of time* for 7 days.\r\n# Create a new branch on your repository [from within the Bitbucket server UI|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/BitbucketServer/Using+branches+in+Bitbucket+Server#UsingbranchesinBitbucketServer-Creatingbranches]\r\n# Notice that Bamboo will create a \"Plan Branch\"\r\n# Delete the \"Plan Branch\" from [the Bitbucket server UI|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/BitbucketServer/Using+branches+in+Bitbucket+Server#UsingbranchesinBitbucketServer-Managingallyourbranches]\r\n# Notice that your \"Plan Branch\" will be disabled by Bamboo as it detected the branch was removed\r\n# Recreate the branch [from within the Bitbucket server UI|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/BitbucketServer/Using+branches+in+Bitbucket+Server#UsingbranchesinBitbucketServer-Creatingbranches] before the expiry date for deleted branches (7 days in this specific example)\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n# The \"Plan branch\" should be reenabled by Bamboo\r\n# The \"Plan branch\" shouldn't be marked for deletion anymore\r\n# Bamboo deletes a \"Plan branch\" that *is enabled*\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n# The \"Plan branch\" is _not_ reenabled upon recreation on the remote repo\r\n# The branch is deleted according to the \"Plan Branch\" set up despite the fact it was recreated on the remote repo\r\n# Bamboo _shouldn't_ delete a \"Plan branch\" that is *enabled*\r\n \r\nh3.Workaround\r\n1. You could check which branch has been detected for deletion:\r\n{noformat}\r\nbamboo=# select * from vcs_branch;\r\n vcs_branch_id |          name           | detected_deletion_date  | chain_id \r\n---------------+-------------------------+-------------------------+----------\r\n       1867783 | bugfix/thirdnewbranch   |                         |  1474568\r\n       1867784 | bugfix/anewbranch       |                         |  1474568\r\n       1867785 | bugfix/branch           |                         |  1474568\r\n       1867786 | bugfix/athirdnewbranch  |                         |  1474568\r\n       1867787 | bugfix/asecondnewbranch |                         |  1474568\r\n       1867788 | master                  |                         |  1474568\r\n       1867789 | bugfix/branchtest       | 2015-10-08 10:22:52.241 |  1474568\r\n       1867790 | bugfix/branch           | 2015-10-08 10:31:44.442 |  1474568\r\n{noformat}\r\n2. Then you can set the {{detected_deletion_date}} to NULL:\r\n{noformat}\r\nupdate vcs_branch set detected_deletion_date=NULL where vcs_branch_id=1867790;\r\n{noformat}\r\n3. Check it again that the branch has not been marked for deletion:\r\n{noformat}\r\nbamboo=# select * from vcs_branch;\r\n vcs_branch_id |          name           | detected_deletion_date  | chain_id \r\n---------------+-------------------------+-------------------------+----------\r\n       1867783 | bugfix/thirdnewbranch   |                         |  1474568\r\n       1867784 | bugfix/anewbranch       |                         |  1474568\r\n       1867785 | bugfix/branch           |                         |  1474568\r\n       1867786 | bugfix/athirdnewbranch  |                         |  1474568\r\n       1867787 | bugfix/asecondnewbranch |                         |  1474568\r\n       1867788 | master                  |                         |  1474568\r\n       1867789 | bugfix/branchtest       | 2015-10-08 10:22:52.241 |  1474568\r\n       1867790 | bugfix/branch           |                         |  1474568\r\n{noformat}\r\n4.

      "description": "I often work with multiple teams. Occasionally other teams have different branch naming rules which means the branch that I create may not get picked up by automatic plan branch creation.\r\n\r\nWhen I manually create a plan branch my workflow is as such:\r\n\r\n1. Find build I'm interested in creating a plan branch for.\r\n2. Navigate to the \"view all branches\" via a drop down. (I have literally no idea what informs that drop down but it's almost never what I want. Maybe it's things I navigated to recently? I guess I want a mix of that and recently created/updated branches in the hope that mine will show up there after I commit)\r\n3. After I wait forever for the \"view all branches\" page to load, I ctrl-f for the branch I'm looking for. If it's not there I continue\u2026\r\n4. Click on Actions.\r\n5. Click on Configure Plan (which is a weird thing to do but I've figured it out from experience).\r\n6. Click branches.\r\n7. Click Create plan branch.\r\n8. Immediately scroll to the bottom because it'll never be at the top.\r\n9. Click More\u2026\r\n10. Scroll again and click More\u2026\r\n10. Scroll again and click More\u2026\r\n10. Scroll again and click More\u2026\r\n10. Scroll again and click More\u2026\r\n11. I do this a bunch of times so that I can use ctrl-f to look for what I actually want. I do this for several reasons. Scrolling and clicking more is a very repeatable action but scrolling, clicking and searching, not finding, then going back to scrolling is slower. I want a higher chance of finding when I search.\r\n12. Click on the checkbox for the branch that I want to create a plan branch for. If I happen to want to create more than one plan branch I never do it by using the check boxes because doing that creates them both but then I have to navigate back to the \"view all\" thing to enable them (I'm gonna complain about having to enable them more later\u2026).\r\n13. Wait for ages for the plan branch that I've just created to load. \r\n14. Enable the plan. (I have to enable the thing I just created \u2026is this real life?)\r\n15. Guess which thing I need to click in order to get to the page where I will see the plan running instead of a configuration screen. Seriously, some links that look and sound the same in bamboo go different places depending on whether your in configuration or not, it's weird.\r\n\r\nI'd like this process to be less painful.\r\n\r\nThanks.",

I am trusting that our tests don't break because of certain hardware problems between agents (smaller RAM, fewer CPU, smaller disk, different JRE or JDK versions, missing dependencies, etc).\r\n\r\nIn the Test Summary, we found that one of our tests usually failed when run on a certain agent. It's a crash in our application, probably from a memory leak, we're still not sure. Although there is a trend to have it trigger on a certain agent, it has crashed on a different one also.\r\n\r\nWhat I'm asking for, is that alongside the failing cases (on the bottom), that the corresponding Agent is also listed. This would provide valuable information about the source of the problem, in case it is a problem with the Agent.\r\n\r\nI do not believe that the agent needs to be linkable, like you would move into an administration point of view or whatev.

Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Set the hostname test.atlassian.com to Stash (can use /etc/hosts)\r\n# Create Application Link between Stash and Bamboo\r\n# Make sure that the repository is added successfully into Bamboo\r\n# Delete the hostname test.atlassian.com\r\n# Build a Plan in Bamboo that uses Stash repository\r\n# Wait for it to fail\r\n# Check open files with the commands \"lsof -p <BAMBOO_PID>\"\r\n# Repeat step 5-7 for a lot of time\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nThe open files that connect to Stash should be released after the failure\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nThe open files keep on increasing\r\n\r\nh3. Notes\r\nIf there are a lot of Repositories in Bamboo connecting to Stash, the open files will keep on increasing until it hit into \"Too many open files\" error\r\n\r\nh3.Workaround\r\n\r\nAssuming that the address reported in the {{UnresolvedAddressException}} is incorrect because you've migrated Bitbucket to a new address, you can replace the URL Bamboo is using to access Bitbucket using these steps:\r\n# Shutdown Bamboo\r\n# Backup database for rollback purposes\r\n# Run the following SQL to change the hostname:\r\n{code:sql}\r\nUPDATE VCS_LOCATION SET XML_DEFINITION_DATA=REPLACE(XML_DEFINITION_DATA,\"old_hostname\",\"new_hostname\");\r\n{code}\r\n# Restart Bamboo\r\n\r\nAlternatively, if the address is correct and still can't be resolved -- you'll need to investigate why your DNS infrastructure does not correctly resolve the address.",
