You did a very good job with it.\n\nHowever, I would not only like to view my files, but I would also like to be able to download a file I found interesting. Currently, I have to help myself creating a new file and copying the content, but this is not exactly great user experience.\\\\\nI guess this feature would be very easy for you to add since you already extract the file from the code repository to display it.\n\nThanks in advance!",

Alternatively, one can follow an entire repository and thus intrinsically follow all pull requests, issues, and wiki changes associated with that repository.\n\nWhat I would like is to be able to follow a repository so that I follow new PRs, issues, and so on by default, but I&#x27;d like the ability to \"unfollow\" individual pull requests and issues within that repository.\n\nThe reason I ask this, is that I&#x27;m involved in a very active development repository.  I want to be aware of new PRs and issues as they crop up.  However, many of the PRs and issues are not related to my work, and I don&#x27;t necessarily need to know everything associated with all of them.  When some of my co-developers get going, they can generate long and high-cadence comment streams discussing PRs and issues that end up flooding my mailbox.  As I said, I don&#x27;t mind if this is on an area of the code with which I&#x27;m interested, but if it is unrelated to my work, I&#x27;d just as soon ignore these emails.\n\nIs it possible to implement an \"unfollow\" button for individual PRs / issues inside of a repo that we&#x27;re following?",
