      "description": "h3. Summary\r\n\r\nWhen using Service Desk 2.5.9 with an Agent based license the application response time is severely impacted when there are more than 10k Agents and during LDAP syncs.  The worst affected views are from the REST APIs, {{rest/api/2/users}} and {{rest/api/2/groups}}.\r\n\r\nAfter upgrade, 99th percentile of all request times increased to 30 seconds when Active Directory user synchronization is running or when our jira-ilists group (17k users) is added to Service Desk Agent role. Otherwise, 99th% is ~2-5 sec. Monitoring 99th percentile execution time of all requests has had strong correlation with user complaints about performance in the past.\r\n\r\nWe have unlimited licenses for everything.  When we upgraded to JIRA 6.4 and JIRA Service Desk 2.5.9 we were issued an Agent-base license (unlimited Agents).  Previously all jira-users could access SD features we wanted without extensive intervention from JIRA admins.  Our users mainly want the simplified issue creation and SLAs.\r\n\r\nWith an Agent based license, only Agents that are members of the Service Desk Team role for a project can be assigned issues and this is a big obstacle for us.  To work around it we added the equivalent of our jira-users group to the Service Desk Agent group (jira-ilists, approx 17k users).  This triggered the performance problems.\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Environment\r\n* JIRA 6.4.12, Service Desk 2.5.9\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Install JIRA 6.4.12 with Service Desk 2.5.9\r\n# Generate 400 projects, each with a Service Desk.\r\n# Add a group with 10k members to the Service Desk Agent group.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n* Requests for {{rest/api/2/users}} and {{rest/api/2/groups}} should perform well during Active Directory sync and when using an Agent based license.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n* Requests for {{rest/api/2/users}} and {{rest/api/2/groups}} are dramatically slower when there are thousands of Agents with an Agent based license.\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Notes\r\n\r\nExtensive logs and data are available on the support case, [PS-3211|https://support.atlassian.com/browse/PS-3211].  This is only accessible by Atlassians.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\n* Only add users that require Agent features to the Service Desk Agents group rather than all users.\r\n",

For example, a request is logged but doesn't need to start until two weeks later, therefore we change the call status to 'On-Hold', but then specify the time and date when we would like the call status to automatically change to 'Open'.\r\n\r\nThis is an extremely important feature for us and would require this if we are to complete our migration.  Could I request that this feature is added at your earliest possible convenience please.  One possible way that I see this working in JIRA would be to add an Auto Status Change feature within a Workflow Transition.  However, I'm still fairly new to this so you may be able to advise of another solution.\r\n\r\nI look forward to hearing from you.\r\n\r\nMany thanks\r\nNathan\r\n\r\n",

However, this also gives access to all Confluence users.

Also cannot specify in Space Permissions who cannot view, only can.\r\n\r\nSo when you lock out everybody *except* admins, this will include also the SD customers.\r\n\r\nh3.

Expected Results\r\n* The link should take you to the issue navigator where the list of unresolved issues assigned to the agent is displayed\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n* Your're taking to the Issue Navigator, however, jql reports the following error:\r\n{code}The value '$old-username' does not exist for the field 'assignee'.{code}\r\n_note that $old-username would be the original username or user key of the renamed user_ \r\nh3. Notes\r\n* The problem is occurring because the jql query is still referring to the old username, which is no longer being recognized as a user in JIRA, as the name has been changed.\r\n* Issue is not reproducible in Service Desk 3.0.9, seems to be only an issue with JIRA Service Desk 2.5.x and JIRA 6.x",

It would be even more awesome if the agents working \"behind the stage\" could also directly benefit from that, specifically with known error or workaround articles.\r\nA practical example from our use case:\r\nWe`ve linked JIRA SD with a confluence space which we feed with how-to articles tagged \"public\" and \"internal\" - the public articles help our users to solve their issues or answer their questions in self-service fashion. It would be great if JIRA SD would provide the same search/suggestion for \"internal\" tagged articles when an issue was created, so that the agent has already a set of internal articles which might fit to solve the issue. This could be on the issue screen on the right side, compared to the \"We've found solutions that could save you time\" div in the customer portal.",

[See the corresponding bug report|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSDCLOUD-3296].\n  {panel}\n\n{panel:title=Update as of 2 February 2016|bgColor=#f5f5f5}\r\nThis issue was caused by Service Desk switching to preferring the html part of a mail message, over text, which was the previous default. The existing Html To Text converter produces a body that will cite links at the bottom.\r\n\r\nAn update has been made to the Service Desk Mail Handler, so that it will instead convert the HTML contained in an email into wiki markup.\r\n\r\nThis will work best in multipart mime messages that contain both a text and html part. Most modern clients will send multipart messages by default.\r\n\r\nThe change will be included in JSD 3.2.0-OD-02 but will not function immediately, as it also requires a change to JIRA that should be released in the next 2-3 weeks\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Summary\r\nWhen an e-mail request is sent in to the JIRA Service Desk project's mail handler, the mail handler parses the content of the e-mail. Any URL, Phone Number, or E-mail address within the body of the e-mail gets appended with a number in the front, and then referenced at the bottom of the ticket description. \r\n\r\nh3. Environment\r\n* JIRA Service Desk v3.1.0-OD-10\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Enable Email Requests on a JIRA Service Desk project\r\n# Send in an e-mail to the JSD mail handler that contains an E-mail address, URL, and Phone number in the body\r\n# Observe the change in format when the mail handler creates the ticket\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nIssue Description should be formatted in the same format as when it was sent in.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nIssue is converted to a different format, causing issues with accessing the links in some cases.\r\n \r\nh3. Notes\r\n- In some cases, the issue is only reproducible with one of the following: URL, E-mail address, Phone number.\r\n- Other formatting/styling issues such as omitted line breaks are symptoms of this bug\r\n\r\nh3.Workaround\r\nNo known workaround.",
