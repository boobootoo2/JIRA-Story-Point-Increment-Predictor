      "description": "I've been looking through the forums and have found similar questions, but not quite the exact thing I'm looking for. So I apologize in advance if this question has already been answered and I missed the post (I hate creating duplicates).\r\n\r\nI've been playing around with the built-in reports in JIRA, in particular the Workload Pie Chart report. I wanted to see if I could get a report of how many hours an individual in a project has logged across all the tasks he has logged work in. What I found was disappointing.\r\n\r\nI made a single test ticket in a brand new fix version (so it was the only ticket available in my query) and assigned it to myself (person A), and logged 5 hours on the task. I then assigned the ticket to a co-worker (person B), and he logged 10 hours on the task. When I ran the workload report by assignee and on time spent, the only person that appeared in the report was person B with a total log time of 15 hours (his hours plus my hours). What I was hoping I would get was person A having 5 hours and person B having 10 hours.\r\n\r\nThe problem is, person B was the last assignee for the task. And the task currently had 15 hours logged on it. So, the report says that person B has 15 hours logged. The report does not go into the task and extract the hours per individual -- just the total hours on the task and the last person assigned.\r\n\r\nSo, I think you know my question. How can I generate a time logged report per person regardless of if the task they were involved in was also worked on by other individuals?\r\n",

Please generate an API token [here|https://confluence.atlassian.com/cloud/api-tokens-938839638.html]\r\n{code:java}\r\ncurl --request PUT \\\r\n  --url 'https://<your-instance>.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/project/{projectId}' \\\r\n  --user 'email@address.com:API-TOKEN' \\\r\n  --header 'Accept: application/json' \\\r\n  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\r\n  --data '{\r\n   \"leadAccountId\": \"5d3b06xxxxxxxxx\",\r\n  \"projectTypeKey\": \"software\",\r\n  \"key\": \"ABC\"\r\n}'\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nYou will have to run this via a Terminal, enter the details of the new users by using the *accountId*, this can be gotten from https://<your-instance>.atlassian.net/people then search for the user to know the *accountId* which is in an alphanumeric String. Secondly insert the correct project id and project key on the Script prior to running it. This endpoint is gotten from our documentation for [*Update Project*|https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/v3/?utm_source=%2Fcloud%2Fjira%2Fplatform%2Frest%2F&utm_medium=302#api-rest-api-3-project-projectIdOrKey-put]\r\n\r\nAlternatively, if running curl is proving difficult especially towards Window users, you can download this Free software called [*Postman*|https://www.getpostman.com/] which is able to Perform HTTP request. Please do the following to easily change project lead of next-gen projects.\r\n\r\n*Step 1*: Make sure you have Administrator Project role on the next-gen Project\r\n *Step 2*: Get Postman, and do the below Settings as shown on the images.\r\n||A||B||C||\r\n|!change_project_lead1.png|thumbnail!|!change_project_lead2.png|thumbnail!|!change_project_lead3.png|thumbnail!|\r\n\r\n*Step 3*: On the Image A, Click on Authorization tab and select Basic Auth, enter your email address and API token following the guide from [here|https://confluence.atlassian.com/cloud/api-tokens-938839638.html]\r\n *Step 4*: On the Image B, Configure the headers as shown on the Image and change the HTTP request to *PUT*. Please indicate the URL as https://<your-instance>.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/project/ABC\r\n where ABC is your project key.\r\n *Step 5*: On the Image C, please make sure you add correctly this JSON post\r\n{code:java}\r\n{\r\n\"leadAccountId\": \"5d3b06xxxxxxxxx\",\r\n\"projectTypeKey\": \"software\",\r\n\"key\": \"ABC\"\r\n}\r\n{code}\r\nWhere *leadAccountId* is the accountId of the user you want to change to.

And I want to drag team members inside my board so that they can know the status of our projects but I also cannot find such function, it seems every function shown in tutorial has a big gap with mine, I am the one who suggest boss using this kind of software and my boss asked me to submit a schedule list to them in 2 days! What makes things worse is that no one else in my team know how to use Jira! I feel like I am dying soon! Can anyone come to help???",

We are formalizing an issue hierarchy in next-gen projects (where we will have parent/child relationships) rather than using epic links. This will facilitate some cool stuff in the future around reporting and roll up estimation. Unfortunately in the short term, it means when you move issues to next-gen projects you will need to manually assign these issues to the relevant epic.\r\n\r\nIt's important to note the epic link has not actually been removed in the background- it's just not visible and is not useful within the context of the next-gen project. If you were to move your issues back to a classic project, for example, you would not lose this linkage. Although the 'Epic Name' and 'Epic Colour' custom fields would be lost.\r\n\r\nIn the future, as we build out the next-gen projects, we will provide an automated mechanism to create the new parent/child relationship based on the epic link but it just isn't something we have got to yet. We apologize we didn't make this clear earlier. We have updated our docs in an attempt to clarify how epics behave when migrating projects. You can review the docs from this [page|https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirasoftwarecloud/migrate-from-an-next-gen-project-to-a-classic-project-957974933.html].\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nAtlassian\r\n{panel}\r\nh3. Summary\r\n\r\nWhen an epic from a non next-Gen project is moved to a next-Gen project, the association is removed. All issues associated with the epics will no longer be linked to the epic\r\nh3. Steps to reproduce\r\n # Have 2 projects (Next-gen and non next-gen)\r\n # Create an Epic from a non Next-gen project\r\n # Add a child issue to the epic\r\n # Move the epic to the next-gen project\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Result\r\n\r\nEpic link remains. The issues are still linked with the epic in the next-gen project even after the move.

Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Create a JIRA Core instance - https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/core/try\r\n# Create a Bitbucket account - https://bitbucket.org/account/signup/\r\n# Initiate the integration procedure from within Bitbucket, as detailed on this documentation page: [Connect Bitbucket Cloud to Jira Cloud applications|https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/connect-bitbucket-cloud-to-jira-cloud-applications-814190686.html]\r\n# The integration will fail and the following error message will be displayed: \r\n{quote}\r\nError\r\nThe add-on failed to be installed: Error calling uninstalled at URL https://yourinstance.atlassian.net/rest/aci/1.0/installation/jira-bitbucket-connector-plugin/uninstall: 401 Client Error: Unauthorized for url: https://yourinstance.atlassian.net/rest/aci/1.0/installation/jira-bitbucket-connector-plugin/uninstall\r\n{quote}\r\n# A link will be created on the application navigator of JIRA referencing to the Bitbucket account\r\n# Remove the link by accessing the Application Navigator page (https://yourinstance.atlassian.net/plugins/servlet/customize-application-navigator) will not be possible.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nThere are two possible results: \r\n# Prevent the link from being created after the failed attempt to integrate JIRA Core with Bitbucket\r\n# It should be possible to delete the link created on the application navigator\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nA link to the Bitbucket account will be created on the application navigator. This link can't be removed until JIRA Software is added on the affected instance. It's only possible to remove the link using the DVCS feature. \r\n\r\nh3.Workaround\r\nIt's only possible to *hide* the link by accessing the Application Navigator page (https://yourinstance.atlassian.net/plugins/servlet/customize-application-navigator) until a fix isn't deployed. The procedure to hide links listed on the application navigator is detailed on the following documentation page: \r\n\r\n* [Creating links in the application navigator|https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiracloud/creating-links-in-the-application-navigator-776636255.html]",
