While everything is fine and dandy when editing code, editing the wiki has been causing a lot of problems around here.\n\nSince our wiki is also used by non-technical users(archaeologists) to review requirements, they face a lot of problems when editing a wiki page that contains images. Because of this most users went back to using word documents.\n\nI would like to propose the following enhancements which:\n\n* Have an alternative way to upload images. Have something on the server side that can auto-commit to the wiki when an image is added through the browser.\n* Ability to attach files to the wiki pages.  This is important because if one wants to change the image and upload it, they should have the source (word file, powerpoint file etc..). (May be you can use a hidden issue for this.)\n* Ability to export a wiki page to word and pdf files.\n\nIf these issues are not fixed soon, you may loose us. I hate for to move out to a chaotic world just because I can&#x27;t upload an image to the wiki.\n\nThanks,\\\\\n-S-",

      "description": "A little related to <<issue 573>> except I don&#x27;t care about scrum and all the attendant complications.\n\nFirstly milestones are currently somewhat unusable because they are sorted into ascii order when dealing with a ticket.  Entering bugs in this project is a good demonstration.  There is also a desire for some sort of summary and a longer description - again note milestones for this project.  (The summary is a pain because if you use the milestone wiki macro then you also have to get that right, and correct on any wiki pages using it.)\n\nThe trac roadmap - http://trac.edgewall.org/roadmap - is nice and suitably simple.  Each milestone has a name, summary, description and target date.  Sorting can use target date and then ascii order (although understanding numbers within would also be good).  A report like that one (including completion statistics) is then trivial to generate and gives a good project management overview.  This is important to those of us with commercial projects.  (I have a hand written wiki page trying to approximate it, but it is a pain to maintain.)",
