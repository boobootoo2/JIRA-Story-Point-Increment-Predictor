Summary\r\nResolve/Close request transitions in a Service Desk instance do not trigger the appropriate notifications to Agents/JIRA Users according to the notification scheme.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Define users/groups under the Issue Resolved and/or Issue Closed notification settings of a Service Desk project's notification scheme.\r\n# Create a Service Desk request in the Service Desk of step 1\r\n# Resolve the request of step 2\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nThe users or members of the group as defined under step 1 should receive notifications of the request being resolved\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nThe members of the group or entities do not receive any notifications of the request resolution\r\n\r\nh3. Root cause\r\nIn the Service Desk default generated workflow, the transition that resolves requests fires a Generic Event in the transition post-functions.\r\nThe notification scheme however acts on the Issue Resolved event. Since this is not defined in the post-functions, no notifications will be send.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\nThere are 2 possible workarounds for this issue.\r\n# Add the users/groups in the notification scheme to the \"Generic Event\" instead of the \"Issue Resolved\" notification. This will however trigger notifications on all Generic Events within that project to the defined user/groups\r\n# In the relevant workflows, change the \"Fire a Generic event\" to \"Fire a Issue Resolved event\". Ensure you do this for all resolve issue transitions in all workflows, and do not forget to publish the workflows after the changes have been made in order for the changes to take effect",

MANDATORY: tickets shall be reopened, if the ticket is closed / resolved and the customers adds a new comment in the customer portal\r\n2.) would be good: customers should be able to close a ticket in the portal\r\n3.) IMPORTANT: We want to have prepared answers that we can use to anser tickets with prepared text tempates -- this is tracked via https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSD-631.\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you for your answer.\r\n\r\nI was looging e.g. for the answer for question 1 for many hours without success.\r\n\r\nWe have installed the latest version of jira service desk on our server.\r\n\r\n\r\nbr\r\nMarkus H\u00e4usler ",

After it is being pulled it will be set as Read and the emails is converted as Request in the JIRA ServiceDesk Project. As mentioned in the [documentation|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/SERVICEDESK/Setting+up+the+email+channel]:\r\n{code}\r\nAfter the email channel is set up, JIRA Service Desk will take note of when it connected to the email account for the first time. Any new messages sent to your inbox after that time will be pulled in as new requests or comments. Customers will receive email notifications about the details of their requests. For information about notifications, see Configuring JIRA Service Desk notifications. Messages that already exist in your email account are not processed. {code}\r\nBut, there is still possibility that one of the new email is already \"Read\" before JIRA ServiceDesk pull it making it is not being created as a Request. Hence, just like the Standard JIRA Mail Handler where it will scan the Mail Box as it is configured and it will created any emails as JIRA Issue if the issue is not exist yet, it would be great that JIRA ServiceDesk Email Settings(Mail Handler) have the same features like Standard JIRA Mail Handler.\r\n\r\nh4. Additional request:\r\nMake a way so that when a user is adding a Service Desk Channel, they are able to specify their own PULL_FROM_DATE rather than by default use the date that the Channel is created.\r\n",
