In addition, using the modal window isn't exactly fast...\n\nTo achieve the desired effect, if modal is enabled, I have to:\n- open the issue\n- wait...\n- middle-click the issue Id in the modal window (opens in a new tab)\n- wait\n- close the window\n- wait...\n\nThat's a lot more waiting that I want to have to do!\n\nEvery modern browser going nowadays supports tabbed browsing.  Using this would allow multiple issues to be opened concurrently for purposes of cross-referencing them, linking them, etc.  The speed gains would also be appreciated.\n\nThis is a very minor change that would make greenhopper just a bit more useable",

The queue/line of issues provided by greenhopper fulfill our needs except on one point, the initialization. \r\n\r\nWhen a new issue is created, currently the issue is put in the last position of the queue. However, it could be usefull is there is a rule on creation to help greenhopper putting the issue on the right position. \r\nFor example, in our company, we would like that the issue is put on the queue according to the following criteria :\r\n- the priority\r\n- the creation date if the priority are equals\r\n- if priority and date are equals, the last created on last position\r\n\r\nThis way, the first priorization is automatic and the managers just have to reorder the queue if needed but a huge part of the work is automatically made by the custom field. \r\n\r\nIs it possible to associate this kind of rules for the greenhopper ranking custom fields so that some fields could be used to calculate the initial order in the queue ?",

It does not have component and version field, because it does not need those. It is like checkbox.. \"remember -> done\".\r\n\r\nThis fights a little bit against scrum, but that works for us.\r\n\r\nHopefully Greenhopper respects JIRA field and screen schemes on future version.\r\n\r\nBR,\r\n-JP",

      "description": "Hi JC,\n\nWe have a burndown chart showing a burndown curve beginning at 121 hours. In the chart data (downloaded using the link on the chart board) the data shows the original estimate dropping from 40 to 16, but that change is not shown on the curve. On digging into the issue history we found that those 24 hours were spent in a previous sprint and so it makes sense that the chart doesn't show the drop, BUT the chart is using the original estimate of the issue (40 hours) in determining the start height of the burndown curve, instead of the estimate remaining at the start of the current sprint (16 hours).\n\nIs this a bug or are we missing something? This is at least unexpected.\n\nCheers,\n\nXimon",

When you create a backlog item you nearly always know the team it is meant for, and so you can use Quick Create to create them but then have to turn around and edit them all again to set the custom field Team we have.\n\nI still think the reason GH is great is because you folks know scrum and are building  a tool you use yourself.  But the problem is you are small, and don't exercise Scrum as a larger group would with multiple teams.  You don't need a Team concept...there is only one team.
