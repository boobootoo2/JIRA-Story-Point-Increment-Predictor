A more flexible implementation would allow us to use checkboxes when configuring our boards to indicate which column(s) are Not Started columns and which column(s) are Done columns.\n\nFor example, we use a four-step workflow for stories (Not Started->In Progress->In Review->Done). We also have the additional states of Blocked and Dropped which can be transitioned to from any state.\n\nI'd like to set my Scrum Board up with six columns in this order (Not Started, In Progress, In Review, Done, Blocked, Dropped). But Done and Dropped need to share the last column--otherwise we have problems closing Sprints with a mixture of done and dropped stories or sub-tasks. When Done and Dropped share the last column, there is no visual indication the story (or task) is Done or Dropped unless the details of the story (or task) are inspected. Even worse, we had to allow transition of stories to Done from any state to match the transition to Dropped from any state. Otherwise, a user might attempt to drag a story from In Progress to Done (skipping In Review) and JIRA Agile would silently put it in Dropped state (since there is no legal transition from In Progress to Done).\n\nOn the left-side of the board, if I put Blocked to the left of Not Started, JIRA Agile counts my Not Started stories as In Progress when looking at the story point accumulation, which is incorrect.",

But, since the issue will be gone in the Plan Mode if it is closed before Sprint is started, it could be hard to know that there is actually a closed ticket in the sprint. Hence, a notification or a simple behaviour to handle the closed ticket in a future sprint could be useful like:\n* A warning notification that will be pop-up before starting a sprint telling that a closed ticket is inside.\n* the closed ticket is removed from the sprint and the backlog.\n* to still shows closed ticket same as the behaviour of a closed ticket in a running sprint.",

I would be OK with Jira changing the visibility of the filter to project only after a popup asking for agreement.\n* When changing the filter for an existing board the same recommendations should occur.\n\nAlternatively:\nMaybe Agile should get a full-featured permission management where (independently of filter) the visibility and other permissions can be configured.

Because of this, sometimes parents have Fix Versions but subtasks do not (created without Fix Versions). This causes confusion to users who work on subtasks, and there's a chance that they will update subtasks with Fix Versions which do not follow parents'.\n\nSuggestion is to be able to easily hide subtasks' Fix Versions in Agile boards. Currently this can be done by using Field Configurations, but once the field is hidden, subtasks no longer appear in Kanban boards as the default Work Sub-filter will filter them out - Hidden is not treated as Empty.\n\nThe only feasible workaround is to manually adjust the Work Sub-filter to include subtasks.",

The workflow and issue type schemes are reused in other projects where issues do appear. I also switched the permission scheme to one that is shared and that did not help with the issues not appearing, so I don't think it's permissions.\n\nI can run a query and see a list of issues so I know they're hiding in the project somewhere, but I'd love for them to show up in the plan view so that I can adjust priority from there, etc.\n\nh2. Workaround:\n\nWhen you create a scrum project and only have one column in your Work view, it causes all issues to be hidden in the Plan view.

      "description": "h1. Introduction\nWe are happily using your Agile plugin for years now and it is always a perfect fit and of great help to our agile development process.\n\nThere is just one thing that we are not able to match with our development process and that is (in our opinion) not structured correctly in JIRA Agile. Currently epics are not displayed in the backlog, but in the left EPIC bar. We would prefer to change this so that epics are displayed in the product backlog and the left bar is called differently (ie. \"theme\" would suit better).\n\nh1. Why?\n# An epic should not contain user stories as it actually is a big user story. Later on the epic is replaced by several user stories.\n# An epic should be estimated to the same reference as a user story (if story x is 5 story points, than epic y is 100 story points)\n# An epic should be prioritised accurately, so in between story 3 and story 4 of theme 1, it should be possible to place epic 1 of theme 2. By prioritizing the epics seperately from the other PBI's you suggest that you first need to finish an epic (or what we would call theme) before you start another.\n\nh1. Solution\nWhat we would like to change is:\n# Add a new (default) issue type called \"Theme\"\n# Change the left bar from epic to theme, so that you can still group backlog items and easily filter them.\n# Put the actual epics back where they belong, in the backlog together with all other PBI's\n\nWe sincerely hope that you can help us out with this issue in some way as it concerns the foundations of how we structure our projects.\n\nThanks, also on behalf of our development teams,\n\nKai Stevens\n",

      "description": "Hi JIRA Agile team,\n\nThe new feature released is great. It helps us a lot. But it will helps us even better if you guys implement the possibility to configure card layout by issue type.\n\nWhy this is important for us... Cause we use KANBAN boards for specific teams over here. One for Project Team, one for Support Team, one for Product Team and another one for the DEV Team.\n\nAccording to our workflows one issue can pass from one KANBAN to other, due to its status or even its type.\n\nEach KANBAN has a different focus and we believe its issues should have different visible informations as well.\n\nAn issue type of *DEV Task*, for example, should expose the information below as its extra fields:\n- Due Date\n- Original Estimate\n- Time Spent.\n\nOn the other hand, an issue type of *Customer Request Support* should expose the information below as its extra fields:\n- Responsible Support Attendant\n- SLA related to Time to Respond\n\nHope your considerations. Regardless of all mentioned above. Congrats for the new feature, it's very useful! :)",

      "description": "Where I have a need for 3 separate quick filters, all variants on status, I have buttons for \"Resolved and Closed\" \"Closed\" and \"Resolved not Closed\" for instance.\nThese could far more logically be presented as a set of choices in a drop down, with the addition of \"Not applied\" or \"None\" etc. Each choice would simply be a different quick filter definition and description. This would also ensure the control was actually displaying the state being applied, rather than the current, somewhat confusing highlighting where the single description can lead to misinterpretation.\nBy extension the control would need a descriptive title as well.\nOne could envisage 3 customers being important for now, so a 'Customer' title control would have 'All', 'Cust1','Cust2','Cust5' for instance relating to 3 separate, very similar quick filter queries. \nThis would significantly reduce clutter, and would even help with single On Off type quick filters, where description would change.\nAn advantage of this approach is not having to link the quick filters to lookup selectors, and additionally, the drop down could even use very dissimilar quick filters at the same time if required.",
