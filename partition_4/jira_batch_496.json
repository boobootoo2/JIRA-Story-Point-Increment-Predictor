Those, in turn, are tied to Advanced Roadmaps which are not applicable to Service Desk.\r\n\r\nRemoving the above constraint in Service Desk would allow the \"Team\" field to be used in the tickets. At any given time it should either be empty or hold a single value for the Team that is currently handling it.\r\n\r\nJustification:\r\n\r\nIn a Service Desk, multiple teams can be involved in handling a ticket. The \"Team\" field would be helpful to hand off tickets from one team to another at a Team level. The new team can then assign it to a specific team member. It is very challenging in large organizations to track specific assignees whereas it is much easier to determine a team for the hand-off.\r\n\r\nThis change would also allow queues to be set up more easily by team, and track how long it takes for a specific team member to be assigned to an issue once it has been handed off to another team.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0",
