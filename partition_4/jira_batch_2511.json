      "description": "When Preview&#x27;ing an edit in the wiki or the issue tracker, the Cancel button just beside \"Create issue\" will throw all ones work away. This is not natural when in the Editor, since one intuitively expects this behaviour from the Cancel button (what else should it do?), but in the Preview&#x27;er, one can easily take Cancel to mean \"Cancel this Preview and return to editing\". Especially since the button is right next to Create issue.\n\nThis mistake has happened to myself and now also one of my colleagues.\n\nAdmittedly, this is a newbie error, but wouldn&#x27;t it be good usability to present a warning to the user in this case? After all, even expert users don&#x27;t write edits, previews and then directly trashes this edit all the time, so the extra confirmation shouldn&#x27;t annoy anyone.\n\nA more intrusive possible solution is to remove the Cancel button entirely when in Preview, and add another Edit button instead of it. If you really wanted to throw your work away based on its preview, you should be forced to go back to Edit for this.\n\nCheers",

We really shouldn&#x27;t have to roll our own with the Bitbucket API :(\n\nOur repo&#x27;s are almost always websites, so specifically, we would use this in conjunction with a &#x27;Submit an issue&#x27; link in a site&#x27;s footer. We do this currently, but when I receive an issue via email I then have to manually create the issue ticket in Bitbucket.\n\nI&#x27;ve heard the argument that this may open a repo&#x27;s issue tracking up to spam - well, leave that up to me and make it optional or something! I would rather have the feature and sometimes remove spam issues if we ever received them. Plus, we typically use an obfuscation script on sites to hide email address from bots and such by converting the plain text email address to encoded text.\n\nThanks!",
