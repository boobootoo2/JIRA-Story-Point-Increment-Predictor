If this workaround is feasible to you, please reach out to Support so we can assess the change.\r\n\r\nThere are also a small number of customers that we have not migrated to the 70k user provisioning sync limit due to being close to or above the 20k group size limit.

Such functionality allow them to:\r\n * Provision and de-provisiong these users' accounts through the SCIM integration.\r\n * Enable SSO for these users (in case they are from a verified domain).\r\n\r\nh4. Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nAdd capability of syncing more than 10k users for accounts that will be just accessing the JSM Portal (not licensed on the products).",
