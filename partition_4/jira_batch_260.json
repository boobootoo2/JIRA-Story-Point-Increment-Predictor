This is often necessary - say there is a critical bug that needs to be filed and added to the current sprint, it would be nice to do it in a single shot rather than having to create it, find it on the rapid board and drag it into the sprint.\r\n\r\nYou can add the Sprint field to the Default issue screen, which makes it appear when Editing the issue, but this shows a text field where you have to enter the ID of the sprint. Since this is a system-level value that no user would ever know, its less than useful to non-power users. \r\n\r\nThe ideal would be to enable the use of either a Select dropdown or an autocomplete-type editor a la fix for versions. I suspect this shouldn't be too hard to do, just allow the Autocomplete/Select renderer for the Sprint field.\r\n\r\nIf there is any workaround to get this working before it's released (say some sample plugin code) that could be posted this would be great.
