Granted, I have no inkling if an idea like this is even in the works right now within Atlassian but I figured I&#x27;d let you know. Github just introduced a GUI git client that lets you drag-and-drop repos into a handy-dandy little interface. It also links up to your github account and lets you do all of your repository management right within a tidy little desktop application.\n\nI think that something like this would be excellent for bitbucket as well! Bitbucket is a far superior service and as such should have at least the same types of tools available if not better ones. I&#x27;d go so far as to say I&#x27;d be willing to write this client myself with the REST API; however, I figured I&#x27;d ask if something like this was already in the works before I got started and to see if their was community interest. I&#x27;d probably start with the Mac OS version since, well... I use a Mac and am completely self-serving.\n\nCheers!",
