But can consistently reproduce it.   To reproduce stop the bamboo instance (with idea) directly after the import has complete (I do it as soon as i see the \"import complete\" message in the browser).  Import is kicked off from admin section.\r\n\r\nLooking into the database to see if anything else is going missing, the only thing i can be sure about is the shared capabilities are missing.\r\n\r\nTailing the defaultdb.log file during import shows that the capabilityset, capabilities, queues and permissions are all written to the database after the manual session flush (the one in the session factory) AND after the message goes back to the user telling them to restart. Though they do happen pretty much straight away after this. \r\n\r\nOther thoughts:\r\n\r\n* Both the permissions and the capabilities are saved using the respective dao's to save imported data rather than the session in the session factory.\r\n* Perhaps the dao is not flushing to the database straight away. \r\n* A manual flush of the session in the session factory is performed at the end of the import\r\n* I could not reproduce this on Postgres. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

When moving plans you also don't have the option to move into a \"New Project\" (creating it on the fly).\r\n\r\nTo workaround this, I had to create a new plan in a new project, move the to-be-moved plans to that new project, and delete the temporary plan.",

Re-deploy new Bamboo.\r\n4. Point it at new, empty database.\r\n5. Import the previously exported file.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the import is done, every build we have is put on the queue for an 'initial, clean' build. If I delete builds off the queue they come back on the next round of checks, so ultimately I have to wait out around 170 builds. I've tried restarting Bamboo a second time and the builds always find their way back to the queue.\r\n\r\nBamboo does, however, know (on some level) that it is not an initial, clean build because the previous latest build numbers are still in tact (they don't all reset to 1.)\r\n\r\nOf secondary, and probably related, concern is the fact that after the upgrade all our build artifacts seem to be gone. All the build results, logs, etc. are there but the artifacts are physically gone from the bamboo-home\\xml-data\\builds\\...\\download-data\\artifacts\\... directories. Of course, the initial, clean build artifacts are there. Our artifacts have a practical lifespan of exactly one build so no big deal for us but I thought you'd want to know.\r\n\r\nI suspect this is a product of importing to a new, clean database instead of converting/upgrading the previous one, but I always like to have a clean, simple rollback procedure in case something goes haywire (by no fault of Bamboo's, of course!)\r\n\r\nThis has happened for both our upgrades from 2.0 to 2.0.1 and from 2.0.1 to 2.0.2. Also, in helping test a snapshot build of 2.0.3 for fixes to the Perforce integration, it still does the same thing.\r\n\r\nThanks for listening!",

As it stands now, with arbitrary build queue ordering, multiple dependency paths will eventually resolve correctly, but may generate false build failures when some project builds out of order. Obviously, it would be best if that failure never happens, but an option that might work at my place would be to hold off sending out failure notifications for some X amount of time to see if an alternate dependency path will come around and rebuild the project successfully. This could cut down on a lot of the \"false positive\" build failures that get sent out where I work, leading a lot of people to start ignoring them.",

Relevant Visual Studio build options are for example /build,  /rebuild, /Debug, /Release.  I was thinking one could setup a list of standard and failure actions that the build must iterate through in order to pass.  ex:\r\n\r\nstandard actions:\r\n\r\n/build Debug\r\n/build Release\r\n\r\nfailure build actions:\r\n\r\n/rebuild Debug\r\n/rebuild Release\r\n\r\nCurrently to support a separate build configuration you must configure a separate plan.  This would eliminate creating two or more plans (one for each configuration) and chaining them together with Parent-Child dependencies with the children being a manual build only.  \r\n\r\nThe \"failure\" build option would help clear up a build breakage that can only be cleaned up by performing a /Rebuild, which does happen from time to time and currently requires manual intervention to resolve if a plan only builds a solution with the /build option.\r\n\r\n",
