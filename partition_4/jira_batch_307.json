The Company needs to be able to see what releases issues are in as a label like on issues in the backlog, like the epic. I have hundreds of issues having to click inside each issue to see the release is a massive waste of time, to the point that the whole release function in Next- Gen is useless. This also needs to show on issues on the board.\r\n\r\nI would love to get a reply to say this will be done soon. So many tickets on here take years to get done and it makes no sense that this functionality is not part of Next- gen. It makes life harder.\u00a0",

Problem Definition\n\nWhen using a touchscreen as an input device, touch/gesture responses are inconsistent and/or behave in an unexpected way when navigating Agile Boards.\n\n(i) The issue has best reproducibility and visibility on a largely populated board with many issues and columns which cause the board to not fit in browser view, necessitating scrolling to see the whole board.\n\n(off) Using a Windows 10 laptop with touchscreen capabilities, on Google Chrome 53.0.2785.116 m:\n\nRapidly swiping across the screen when starting the swipe in blank space will scroll the page, allowing the user to navigate to offscreen portions of the board. This is expected.\n\nRapidly swiping across the screen when starting the swipe on an issue will pick the issue up and proceed with moving it around the board, which is *unexpected*. The effect of this is that largely populated boards can become difficult and unintuitive to scroll through.\n\n(on) Using the same laptop on Firefox instead:\n\nRapidly swiping across the screen when starting the swipe in blank space will scroll the page, allowing the user to navigate to offscreen portions of the board. This is expected.\n\nRapidly swiping across the screen when starting the swipe on an issue will still scroll the page, allowing the user to navigate to offscreen portions of the board. This is expected.\n\nh3. Suggested Solution\n\nNormalize the behavior from within the application to match what is expected and happens in Firefox. It's desired that swipes scroll a page, and prolonged holds and then drags can perform a drag and drop instead. \n\nConsider revising JIRA's Supported Platforms documentations to be more explicit about using touchscreens as an input device, as well as Mobile versions of the standard supported browsers.\n\nh3. Workaround\u00a0\nConsider using a different browser, which may offer different behaviors when it comes to touchscreen behaviors.",

This presents a problem when the issue goes from a past iteration into a future iteration.\u00a0\r\n\r\n+_Issue in past sprint does not consume capacity:_+\r\n\r\n!Screen Shot 2020-08-14 at 10.25.35 am.png|width=529,height=127!\r\n\r\n+_Issue in past iteration week consume capacity:_+\r\n\r\n_!Screen Shot 2020-08-14 at 10.24.40 am.png|width=529,height=136!_\r\n\r\nThe complexity here is whether or not we are the user is reducing the estimate to account for latest estimates. When users log working hours the estimate will be reduced but the capacity is still removed from past sprints. This means that we effectively reduce the remaining capacity twice.\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Create a plan that uses hour based estimation\r\n # Create a Kanban team\r\n # Group the roadmap view by team and show capacity on the timeline\r\n # Create an issue and give it an estimate\u00a0\r\n # Set the start and end dates of the issue so that it is in a week that is in the past\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nCapacity should only be taken from the current and future weeks. The issue should not consume capacity from past weeks.\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nThe capacity of weeks in the past is consumed.\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nReduce the estimate to reflect the time assigned to past weeks (this is not an ideal solution).",
