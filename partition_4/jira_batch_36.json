The latter is empty.\r\n - The merge information dialog pops up, stating that you need to QUIT the merge tool to complete the merge process\r\n\r\n... and that's all.\r\n\r\nNo merge tool is launched, and no other message appears.\r\n\r\nI assume this may have something to do with the empty REMOTE revision.\r\n\r\nTo resolve it, I had to clean up by first aborting the ST merge dialog and removing the helper files in unstaged, and then notice that the file in question was gone on the incoming changes. Finally, I \"merged\" it by Removing (Ctrl-Del) it from unstaged, which supposedly recreated the situation on the other branch, and correctly ended up with a.\"deleted\" mark on the staged file.",

      "description": "The interactive rebase function in SourceTree is very confusing.\r\n\r\nFor starters, when using \"squash with previous\", the commit message that \"wins\" is the newest one. Typically, I have an older commit called \"Implement feature X\", and then a newer commit called \"Fixup feature X\". When I squash these two, I almost always want the *oldest* commit message, and not the newest as I get today. I can't even imagine a use case where the current behaviour is desired.\r\n\r\nSecondly, and the reason for this bug report is that when squashing multiple commits they very easily end up out of order, leading to a merge conflict and failed rebase. Consider this commit history.\r\n * Fifth commit\r\n * Fourth commit\r\n * Third commit\r\n * Second commit\r\n * First commit\r\n\r\nDoing interactive rebase on \"first commit\" here, and then selecting \"third commit\" and \"squash with previous\" gives this:\r\n * Fifth commit\r\n * Fourth commit\r\n * Third commit (+1 squashed commits)\r\n ** Third commit\r\n ** Second commit\r\n\r\nNow, selecting \"fourth commit\" and \"squash with previous\" gives this:\r\n * Fifth commit\r\n * Third commit (+2 squashed commits)\r\n ** Third commit\r\n ** Second commit\r\n ** Fourth commit\r\n\r\nAnd the same with \"fifth commit\":\r\n * Third commit (+3 squashed commits)\r\n ** Third commit\r\n ** Second commit\r\n ** Fourth commit\r\n ** Fifth commit\r\n\r\nThis leads to SourceTree starting with applying \"fifth commit\" to \"first commit\", which quite likely will fail with a merge conflict.\r\n\r\nHowever, squashing the commits in the opposite order does seem to work as expected (First \"fifth commit\", then \"fifth commit (+1 squashed commits)\", then \"fifth commit (+2 squashed commits)\"). However, given the workflow I use, this is not at all intuitive. I would squash the first (oldest) fixup into the main commit, then the second fixup, etc.\r\n\r\nIt seeems like this ties into the reversed sort order that SourceTree uses in interactive rebase (git rebase -i sorts the commit with the oldest first, while SourceTree interactive rebase sorts the newest commit first). I understand that it's intuitive to use the same order in the rebase window as in the main commit history, but squashing gets very unintuitive with this order. I would argue that sorting the commits in the order they will be applied (like git rebase -i does) is more intuitive both to people who are experienced with git rebase -i and to people who only use SourceTree (provided that the order of commits is explained in the rebase dialog).\r\n\r\nFinally, I just noticed that if you press \"cancel\" in the rebase dialog, you get an error message:\u00a0\r\n\r\ngit -c diff.mnemonicprefix=false -c core.quotepath=false -c \"sequence.editor='C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Atlassian\\SourceTree\\tools\\stree_gri'\" -c \"core.editor='C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Atlassian\\SourceTree\\tools\\stree_gri'\" rebase -i --autosquash 953b98728a420d0ff3f4ded5284eb8718d1fe2fa\r\nCould not execute editor\r\n\r\nCompleted with errors, see above.",

Summary\r\n\r\nWhen you clone a repository with LFS content in SourceTree, and select in the 'Clone' dialog to checkout the branch with the LFS content (different than master), then the LFS content is not downloaded.\r\nh3. Environment\r\n\r\nSourceTree for Windows 1.9.6.2, Embedded Git 2.8.1 + git-lfs v1.2.0\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Create a repo in Bitbucket Cloud with LFS content in a branch other than master, e.g. develop\r\n # Go to SourceTree, select {{Clone/New}}\r\n # Enter the URL of the repo (the issue has been reproduced with SSH cloning)\r\n # Expand {{Advanced Options}} of the dialog, and select as {{Checkout branch}} develop branch\r\n # When the clone completes, SourceTree prompts with the following: \u00a0 !Screen Shot 2016-11-23 at 15.36.58.png|thumbnail!\r\n # Select {{Yes}}\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nThe LFS content is downloaded\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nDownloading the LFS content is failing with the following output: \u00a0 !Screen Shot 2016-11-23 at 15.37.33.png|thumbnail!\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nClone the repository without selecting to check out the LFS branch in that dialog\r\n Afterwards, from the remote branches, select to check out the remote LFS branch\r\n This will download the LFS content",
