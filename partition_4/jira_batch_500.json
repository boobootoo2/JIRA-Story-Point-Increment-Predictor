Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Config a workflow that allows issue to transition to other status other then just approval/decline\r\n# Create an issue and transition it to the approval workflow\r\n# Transition the issue to other status other than approval/decline so it will leave a pending approval\r\n# Transition the issue back to waiting for approval status\r\n# Now complete the approval flow by approve the issue\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n# This new issue view should be shown as approved on the issue view(via comment)\r\n# Portal issue view should show the issue with only one completed approval\r\n# Portal request filter filter by `waiting for my approval` shouldn't return this ticket for people in the approver list\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n# New issue view behaves correctly by only showing the completed approval in comments\r\n# Portal issue view still show pending approval\r\n# Portal request filter filter by `waiting for my approval` still return the ticket even though the issue is not waiting for approval\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n Currently there is no known workaround for this behavior. A workaround will be added here when available",

If the alert was ack'ed in Opsgenie, a comment would be made to the ticket Service Desk containing the username of the ack'ing user. A Service Desk automation rule would then run to assign the ticket to the username mentioned in the comment. It could work, but it would still require our engineers to interact with alerts in Opsgenie. We currently only use Opsgenie to administer the on-call schedule, and we don't need the full-fledged alerts management functionality it provides.",

Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Step 1: Using a mail client that can send raw HTML (such as Thunderbird,Airmail etc. on Mac), send the following body to a service management project's email channel:\r\n\r\n{code:html}\r\n<html>\r\n<body>\r\n\t\t\t\t<table>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>\r\n* <br />\r\n###############################################################################<br />\r\na\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t\t\t</table>\r\n</body>\r\n</html>\r\n{code}\r\nh3.

Expected Results\r\n\r\nThe Opsgenie Outbound IP List should be added automatically when the IP Allowlist feature is enabled and all integration data should be sent from Opsgenie to JSM flawlessly.\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nThe Opsgenie OutBound IP List isn't on the allowlist, leading the JSM integration data is rejected with\u00a0the following response body from the JSM side.\r\n\r\n!image-2021-02-03-11-17-17-899.png|width=649,height=28!\r\nh3.
