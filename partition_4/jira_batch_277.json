      "description": "h4. Symptom\r\nSome project queries may mess up when there exist two projects in JIRA when the one's name equals to another one's key. for example: \r\nProjectA:\r\nName = IT Support\r\nKey = _SUPPORT_\r\n\r\nProjectB:\r\nName = _Support_\r\nKey = SPT\r\n\r\nThen there're the multiple places that may mess up in project queries:\r\n* Go to [Project Progress Gadget|http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/GH/Using+the+Project+Progress+Gadget|http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Browsing+a+Project%27s+Issues] for \"Support\", when clicking on the sum number, the navigation results show the project \"IT SUPPORT\"\r\n* Go to Planning Board for \"Support\", when clicking on the issue navigation on version panel, the navigation results show the project \"IT SUPPORT\"\r\n\r\nh4. Cause\r\nJIRA JQuery gives project key the higher priority in criteria matching, so when GH uses project name in JQuery - \"project=SUPPORT\", the project with key matched will be allocated.\r\n\r\nh4. Workaround\r\nSince project key can't be changed after project is created, user may adjust the project name to avoid this problem, i.e. change project \"SUPPORT\"(SPT) to \"General Support\"(SPT). \r\n\r\nh4. Resolution\r\nIt's better to check and make sure all project queries are based on project ID or Key instead of searching on name.",

The user would rearrange issues, JIRA Client calculates numeric values for the order, and then tries to upload them to the server (either via SOAP RPC, or through Edit Issue HTML forms).\n\nThis used to work with Greenhopper's Ranking field very nicely. As of version 5.1, 5.2 (probably 5.0 too), it stopped working. If I upload a new Ranking value, it is ignored.\n\nAs much as I could gather, you have changed the semantics of the new uploaded value. It used to be exactly the value of the field, as with other normal fields. Now it seems to be exactly the ranking value of another issue, which is desired to follow the one being changed. (Please confirm - is that correct?)\n\nIf I may suggest a way to fix this, could you please:\n1. Accept any numeric value X for ranking\n2. If X matches the ranking value of any issue, act exactly as you do now\n3. Otherwise, find the issue that has minimal ranking that is greater than X, and use it as the base issue similar to case 2.\n\nIn other words, instead of using \"Issue[Rank=X]\", use \"Issue[min(Rank>=X)]\" as the base issue for the change.\n\nThat way, the functionality would be more robust and compatible. (I understand the final value may be different from the uploaded one, but I think remote clients can cope with that. Also, you could take the exact uploaded value as a \"hint\" for the new value of the ranking field.)\n \nThanks!\nIgor",

For example, we have iteration SPRINT1 with stories S1 (tasks T11, T12), S2 (T21, T22), S3 (T13). This is initial view of the sprint. During sprint execution, S2 and S3 are DONE, but in S1 only T11 was resolved). So when iteration SPRINT2 is constructed, S1 is moved from SPRINT1 to SPRINT2 (only T12) and T13 is added. Which information is lost:\r\n- initial state of SPRINT1 (if I look at it S1 will be missing)\r\n- final state of SPRINT1 (I should see, that T11 was done already in SPRINT1)\r\n- where did T13 appear (was already present in SPRINT1 or was it added in SPRINT2\r\n\r\nI can construct all this by clicking each individual task but this is manual approach that takes alot of time.\r\n",

This sheet could be similar to an already existing JIRA Timesheet Plugin (https://studio.plugins.atlassian.com/wiki/display/TIME/JIRA+Timesheet+Plugin), but must be editable.\r\n\r\nWe have used this in our sprint backlog planning with Excel, because some of the people in the team are not available or partially available on some of the days during the sprint (because of day offs or any other reason) and this sheet just reflects that. With this information we are able to estimate more accurately and calculate the total amount of available time.\r\n\r\nFurthermore we are able to draw the ideal estimate line closer to the reality (see attachment), which shouldn't be just a straight line as it is currently in the GH. For example if you have a two week sprint and you know that half of the team is unavailable on the first week for any reason, then there's no way you can match the ideal line and also you don't know whether you are right on track or not. With the ideal line reflecting the exact amount of time available on particular day, you are able to keep track on the progress whether you are meeting the schedule or not.\r\n\r\nWe're certainly missing such functionality here and this prevents us (Blocker priority) from switching from Excel+Bugzilla to JIRA+Greenhopper.

One way to accomplish this would be by using the numbers from the burndown chart that show how many story points are being completed per sprint and then use that to project the number of story points that would be completed within the user defined number of sprints.\r\n\r\nFor example, if you are at the end of sprint 3 and have completed 105 story points (35 per sprint) and you enter 5 sprints then there would be a visual indication underneath the prioritized list of features/tasks/etc that shows the top 175 story points worth of work (35 per sprint * 5 sprints).

I would expect a widget similar to what is seen in JIRA alone.\r\n\r\nThis does not occur in JIRA if following the same transitions.\r\n\r\nAttached also is GHBug.png showing what it looks like from the perspective of 'Anonymous Administrator'. Lastly, attached is an XML dump (GHBug.zip) of a vanilla JIRA install with GreenHopper 5.0 (the problem exists in 5.1 too, from my tests).
