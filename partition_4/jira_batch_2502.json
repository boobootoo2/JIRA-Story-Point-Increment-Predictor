If you create a new empty repo there is no way to access the settings page unless you manually enter the URL (e.g. bitbucket.org/username/repo-name/admin). Once you have code in the repo, there is a share button in the top right corner of the overview page and through that you can find your way to the access management page by going to the \"Repository\" tab and clicking \"Manage this repository,\" which takes you to the access management page. This is very convoluted and not at all obvious, nor helpful when the repo is still empty.\n\nThere was a case recently where my colleague created a new empty repo and realised he had created it under his personal account instead of the company account and needed to transfer it before we could grant access to the right people. It took two of us 20 minutes to figure out how to simply access the settings page where the transfer option can be found.\n\nSeems to me there should be a \"Settings\" link under \"Navigation\" on the left - that makes the most sense to me.",

Guys, when you&#x27;re going to grow up?\n\nDo we (users) really have to tell you, that there is *an absolute need* for adding any kind of warning, that user is about to close browser / tab with unsaved changes in online editor? Is it to hard to figure out such basic, fundamental and obvious things yourself among dev team?\n\nI&#x27;ve just lost about an hour of my work, because I had open four online editors for my wiki in four separate tabs and accidentally closed entire browser window. Since you haven&#x27;t implemented yet any warning / security prompt, all unsaved changes were just lost.\n\nI was shocked and terrified to find out, that you have no such thing implemented. What is it, after all, a professional tool or a joke? How old a Bitbucket is, that it still hasn&#x27;t got something such obvious implemented? Grow up and give us *usable* tool!",

      "description": "In Java, projects often have directories with dig depths because of the name spacing in Java. For instance, if my project is called powerBucket and I created it, the namespace will be: de.matt3o12.powerBucket. Java requires me to put all my classes with that namespace into \"de/matt3o12/powerBucket\". So, the project hierarchy will look like this:\n\n{code}\nsrc/\n\tde/\n\t\tmatt3o12/\n\t\t\tpowerBucket/\n\t\t\t\tMyClass.java\n\t\t\t\t... other classes\n\t\n{code}\n\nNavigating to MyClass.java in bitbucket can really be a hassle. All folders (except powerBucket) are often empty or just contain some unimportant files.\n\nSince navigation to MyClass (especially with slow internet) is very time consuming, it would be nice if I could access the subdirectory powerBucket directly.\\\\\nJenkins provides a decent way to do so. When a folder contains a subfolder (and only one), it displays all subfolder next to the main folder. I attached 2 screenshots what it looks like in Jenkins and how it could look in bitbucket (I manipulated the HTML).",

There seems to be no pattern which items are given icons and which items are hidden under the wastebasket \"...\" menu.\n\n\"Press [ to expand menu\", is, I am serious, probably the *weirdest UX decision I have ever seen on a website\". The only kind of software I think anyone would consider that sensible in is a command-line curses app. This is a website.\n\nExpected behavior: Site navigation and actions should be accessible by labeled buttons or links which are visible at all times. Labels are more important than icons (because I know what \"Pull Requests\" means but I don&#x27;t know what a box with an arrow in it is). If putting the buttons on the left side of the screen forces you to shrink those buttons until they are just incomprehensible icons, then this means you should not have put the buttons on the left side of the screen.\n\nMarking \"major\" because if people who come to my site cannot find important verbs like \"clone\" or \"issues\" because they are hidden behind easy-to-overlook hieroglyphs, I will have to consider moving my files off Bitbucket.
