This use-case is more probable in environments where strong policies are enforced (like for example casual developer has no 'push' access to the mainline repo, nor the admin access to the Bamboo).\r\n\r\n{color:gray}note, that it should be possible to achieve the branch-by-fork workflow utilizing Bamboo 4.0 facilities, but it wouldn't be so straight out-of-the-box, and would force the casual developer has admin access to the Bamboo admin.

Not having the ability to specify more than one IP to trigger a build is a HUGE pain.\r\n\r\nBecause of this, we're forced to use frequent repository polling (which results in 100s of periodic \"Unable to connect to SVN repository\" errors), or do a bunch of Apache magic to proxy requests to come from one vserver.\r\n\r\n(...and thankfully we're using Apache, instead of something else where it may not be so easy to do that. Like, say, svn+ssh.)\r\n\r\nSorry guys, but the \"security\" excuse is wearing thin - seems easy enough to just whitelist - accept originating IP requests from whatever IPs we type in, and exclude all others.\r\n\r\n- It doesn't even have to accept globs or wildcards, but the field length should be plenty long enough to accept multiple (comma separated) server names.\r\n\r\n- It shouldn't matter whether it's an IP address or DNS entry, but for now it's easy enough for us to ping.\r\n\r\n- Especially since you support Git, having the ability to accept build triggers from multiple IPs should absolutely be included.",
