This is very useful, but for Epics and other parent issues that do not have a continuous schedule of implementing work underneath it, it can sometimes be misleading not being able to drill down to the child issues on the schedule view.\nFor example, an Epic may have one story in sprint 1 (a spike) and all it's remaining stories in sprints 20, 21 and 22, but the Epic schedule view will just show a single bar starting in sprint 1 and ending in sprint 22. It would be very useful if you could visualise the underlying work in some way, either by having the option to expand and view the child issues on the schedule, or by shading/adjusting the thickness of the issue bar to illustrate where the underlying work actually is.",

In some situations it would be desirable to keep the parent open in such a situation because the epic is not yet fully completed (there might be more stories to be added in the future or there is an estimate on the epic itself in JIRA that has not yet been broken down further).

With a normal link, or even epic link, it is possible to run JQL to find all linked issues where the parent issue meets certain criteria - for enterprise this is absolutely critical.\n * It's not possible to update the field via scripts, it's possible to do this for epic links\n * It's not possible to use add ons like Structure to build hierarchies as this isn't a real link type\n * It's not possible to use this field for any kind of reporting outside of JIRA as it doesn't extract the issue key\n\nThis basically means the current implementation of the field/JQL is only useful if you want to find the epics linked to known parent initiatives, which only works if you have a small set of initiatives to work with - we have thousands, and cannot currently create a background link to use for searching when a \"parent link\" is created because we can't access the field value via scripts.\n\nPlease feel free to contact me if you would like more information about our use cases.",

In this current situation, the employee that is in two teams, has an overload in capacity in project 1 while there is free capacity in project 2. Is JIRA Portfolio smart enough to give the suggestion to move some of the capacity from project 2 to project 1? Or is there an option to change the capacity of the employee for just 1 week (right now, this employee has 20 hours available for each of the projects. If i change this, it'll change up until the release date and not just for one week)?\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nIn the current situation, I still have the overview as we are talking about just two projects.

Summary\nThe current implementation of the permission handling can lead to some confusing scenarios where e.g. plan permissions get bypassed by global permissions.\n\nThe interaction of these two permission levels should be redesigned. \n\n\n\nh3. Scenario\n#     Create 2 groups - read-only and portfolio-editor.\n#     Grant read-only group with Portfolio Viewer permission in Portfolio global permission.\n#     Grant portfolio-editor group with Portfolio User permission in Portfolio global permission.\n#     Create 2 users - User A and User B.\n#     Put User A in read-only and User B in portfolio-editor.\n#     Create a Portfolio plan.\n#     Configure the plan's permission to give only User B for Viewers.\n#     Login with User A and try to access the plan. It is allowing this user to view it regardless of the plan's permission.\n#     Add portfolio-editor group to plan's permission Editors.\n#     Now, User A will be blocked from accessing the plan.\n\nh3.

However, most of that time is spent letting the hardware system run and accumulating data on instruments. Periodically throughout the test period the tester might change a setting on the device or re-position it. But the test itself only contains 8 hours worth of this type of work, and the device can be left unattended for the rest of the time.\r\n\r\nI would like to be able to configure a Portfolio issue so that there is a separate \"run time\" and estimate, where the estimate is counted against the team's capacity and the run time defines how long the issue will actually take to run to completion. This would allow me to accurately estimate schedules where there is little work and a whole lot of waiting, such as when we're waiting for long-term testing to complete and are thus free to work on other issues.\r\n\r\nThis would also be beneficial for teams which need to model long lead times on mechanical parts or tooling that needs to be assembled by an outside contractor. For example, if I want to have some prototype parts machined, I might know that it will take 5 days for the machining shop to finish, and 2 hours of my time to call them, send over the drawings, and schedule the work. But there might be software issues that are dependent on this work, and so knowing how long it will take informs when we can start dependent tasks.",

These teams are represented in Jira Portfolio.\n\nWe use the fixed sprints feature to create sprints with our current sprint numbers which the teams are familiar with, for example sprint 144.\n\nAt the moment we have to create all these sprints in each team individually, it would be really nice if we could just create the sprints once and have all teams pick them up in Portfolio.\n\nMany thanks\nPaul",
