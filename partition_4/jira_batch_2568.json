This exercise took around 20 minutes.\n\nI then re-synchronised with our repo which included around 20 changesets with 440 odd file changes. This pull and update occurred fairly quickly, around 20 - 30 seconds.\n\nI then went into the shelve option in the workbench, selected my shelve set and clicked to retrieve it. I have been sitting for 40 minutes waiting for the files to unshelve and it has yet to complete.\n\nWhen I look at the task manager the tortoise application is certainly busy.\n\nIs this a known issue? Surely it cannot take this long to unshelve files? Is there a setting that we may be missing on our side?\n\nThanks,\\\\\nAnton",
