Our group uses JIRA for tracking a variety of government decision-making tasks.  Things like the decision process for deciding whether a species should be listed as threatened or endangered.  These kind of processes have a lot of steps.  It hasn't seemed very useful to create workflows for the detailed steps of these processes... but, it is possible to use JQL queries to sift out the processes that are in similar stages, for example, those processes that are under legal review.  We would find it really useful to have a grid view of JIRA issues that we could configure with arbitrary JQL statements.  \n\nOf course we would want to be able to define multiple such views, with differing grid definitions.  And we would want to be able to display these grids via dashboard gadgets.\n\nThanks for considering our request!",

(In my case, ZTE T83 with the Firefox web browser.) Not only does the UI need lots of screen real-estate (a problem even on many laptops with 1366\u00d7768 pixel screens), but in the backlog, the (small!) elements respond to dragging events almost instantly.\n\nThis is exacerbated by having minimal space to stick ones finger that isn't a task entry. The end result being when tapping on tasks or attempting to scroll, the task is often moved to a wildly different position. Add some lag, and you've got a recipe for making a right dog's breakfast of the carefully curated ordering of tasks.\n\nThe tasks should be *fixed* in their position, unless the user explicitly tells JIRA that they wish to alter positions, indicated by a padlock icon or similar, at which point the old behaviour should be restored allowing re-arrangement of tasks. The same UI element should also make it possible to re-enable the lock.\n\n(Thanks to Nic Brough for pointing this JIRA instance out to me.)",

Problem Definition\nWhen JIRA is linked with Bitbucket Server, the user is able to create branches on Bitbucket from JIRA issues. \nOn the branch creation screen, JIRA suggests a branch name which contains the issue key, which is necessary for the link to be established. If the user removes the issue key from the name, the branch won't be linked to the JIRA issue. This may lead to some confusion, as some users may expect the branch to be linked, as it was created from the JIRA issue.\n\nh3. Suggested Solution\nSince the link between the branch and a JIRA issue is based on the issue key in the branch name, and the branch name is editable, my suggestion includes:\n* A warning to be shown on the branch creation popup when the user is creating a branch from a JIRA issue without including the issue key in the branch name. This warning could either show up as a red warning under the Branch Name field, updated in real time as the user removes the issue key from the branch name, or a message to be acknowledged when the user tries to create a branch without the issue key.\n* If opting by a message to be acknowledged, I also suggest the possibility to disable this feature, as some users may find it annoying.

Summary\nDrag and drop of issues on Kanban board is triggering a javascript error: Exception: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'top' of null\n\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\n# Create a sample project of Kanban type.\n# Visit the Kanban board for the first time, select any issue to Expand the Issue Details View in right sidebar.\n# Navigate away from the Kanban board and then return to the Kanban board by selecting it from the Board menu. The last viewed issue should still be active (selected), and Issue Details View should be expanded for this issue (Jira remembered this for us).\n# Try to DRAG any OTHER issue on the board by click and HOLD of the left mouse button. It is important to take this step right after opening the Kanban board, and not to left-click any issue beforehand on this screen.\n\nh3. Expected Results\nThe dragged issue should becomes selected in the Issue Detail view, and you can transition the issue by dragging it to another column.\n\nh3. Actual Results\nA Javascript error pops-up \nbq. \"Exception: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'top' of null\" \npops up, and the issue can't be moved.\n \nh3. Notes/Workaround\n# The error is triggered only when Issue Details View in right sidebar is already expanded when user visit the Board. If it's collapsed (hidden), the no error will be thrown.\n# The error is triggered only when user tries to Drag issues that aren't shown in the Issue Details View, i.e. all issues except the currently selected one. If user tries to Drag currently selected issue, no error is thrown.\n# The error is thrown only if no issue selection events took place on the Board since user opened it. If any issue where explicitly selected by the user and the contents of the Issue Details View where reloaded, then no error will be shown.",

But to do this, the sprints really need to have dates (at least planned/estimated dates).  This would make life SO much easier than having to both plan sprints, and then try to put appropriate start or due dates on individual issues.\n\nSo, my proposal is to, at least optionally, allow future sprints to be created with a planned start and stop date.\nMany teams work on standard 2 weeks sprints, so the planned start and end will almost always match the actual start and stop once the sprint is active.",
