If Bamboo attempts to poll Stash while it's backing up Bamboo will throw errors for each repository it attempts to poll. This causes unnecessary error logging during that time.\r\n\r\nIt would be great if there was a way to disable Bamboo polling for a specific time frame or if the polling was smart enough to know that Stash was backing up (it seems that this would require some Stash changes as well though).",

My ultimate goal is to easily be able to compare builds and get the data in a readable format and not specifcally all the commit info.  I have a basic workarond to provide what I need in that I can do a diff on the commit hash from the newest build and compare to the commit from the last build.  This is not very clean and feel this is something that should work right out of the box.  \r\n\r\nWe are only in evaluation mode at the moment and when comparing build tools against Jenkins etc - this would be something that doesn't score in Bamboo's favor since this is readily available in other tools.

(Here, I've used a changelist number, but a label is likely.\r\n\r\nWe allow Bamboo to manage the workspace because no other option is viable when we have more than one agent. (It's also using the workspace to detect changes because having a workspace with more than one View entry will yield incorrect change detection.)\r\n\r\nHowever, when the Bamboo server manages the agent, it removes the field from the client entirely. Here's the diff from before and after queuing a build using a plan which had the ChangeView block in place:\r\n\r\n{code}\r\n% p4 diff2 //Specs/client/bamboo::ps-dev-foo.p4s#4 //Specs/client/bamboo::ps-dev-foo.p4s#5\r\n==== //Specs/client/bamboo::ps-dev-foo.p4s#99 (ctext) - //Specs/client/bamboo::ps-dev-foo.p4s#100 (ctext) ==== content\r\n1c1\r\n< # The form data below was edited by john.doe\r\n---\r\n> # The form data below was edited by bamboo\r\n38c38\r\n< Update:\t2014/12/17 10:08:52\r\n---\r\n> Update:\t2014/12/17 12:32:29\r\n65,68d64\r\n< \r\n< ChangeView:\r\n< \t//Products/Reporting/development/Tahoe/...@1021498\r\n< \t//Products/ReportingSDK/development/Tahoe/...@1021498\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nBamboo should leave fields alone if it doesn't understand rather than removing them from scope.",

However, there seems to be no simple way of setting the activemq SSLContext such that a trustStore can be selected for the broker communication only.\r\n\r\nThe activemq library used does indeed have the possibility of setting a SSLContext for the broker communication, and one can thereby set the keyStore, trustStore, trustStorePassword, etc, only for the broker, without affecting other communication.  Setting the javax.net.ssl.trustStore on the VM is not a good idea, as it will invalidate the general https-traffic from the Bamboo server to e.g. atlassian (for updates/plugins, etc).\r\n\r\nAdding the possibility to set e.g. bamboo.jms.broker.ssl.keyStore, etc., would greatly enhance security by adding the possibility to limit connection only to build agents that hold a trusted certificate.",

Deploy #1 as rel-A. Realise that we need additional elements in the next version, so add Art_z to the current build and create #2. Release as rel-B. After release we realise there was a bug, and want to rollback to rel-A, but \"rollback\" will error and indicate that Art_z can't be located. This was not part of the rel-A deployment, but is now part of the latter build.  Workaround is to modify the expected artefacts to allow this to proceed.\r\n\r\nAn improvement to Bamboo will be to re-deploy based on the artifacts used at the point the original deployment.",

The problem is that while performing the rollback, the code ({{ArtifactUrlRedirectAction}}) tries to find the build result that created the artifacts in the first place (similar like clicking on one of the artifacts in the screenshot below). But this build result had been expired. So the query fails and the rollback as well. Nevertheless, the deployment artifacts are still existing on S3.\r\n\r\n!Screenshot - 231214.png!",
