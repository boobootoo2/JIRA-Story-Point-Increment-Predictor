The manage sprints permission introduces the \"origin board concept for sprint\". If the filter query for a sprint is complex (several clauses) it requires the filter either be simplified or the user must have the manage sprints permission for all projects in the instance not just associated projects with the filter. This can cause problems managing a sprint if it exist in several boards as there isn't an easy way via the UI to identify origin board the sprint was created on to resolve the issue. \r\n\r\nSee blog post [Updates on the planned second release of sprint management permission|https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirasoftwarecloud/blog/2016/02/updates-on-the-planned-second-release-of-sprint-management-permission] and  [Sprints shared between multiple boards|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRAKB/Sprints+shared+between+multiple+boards] for reference. \r\n\r\nh3.

Actual Results\nIt works slow (> 30 sec). \n\nh3. Notes\n\nh4. Cause\nCause is boards with many swimlanes and card colours.\n\nFor every card colour or swimlane that is defined using JQL, the entire board query is run again, with the additional JQL appended. So if no swimlanes or card colours are defined and the board opens in N seconds, each swimlane or card colour defined is guaranteed to increase the load time by at least another N seconds. Given 5 swimlanes + 2 card colours + the actual board query, this board will take at least 8*N seconds to open.\n\n2 Problems:\n# For the customer's instance: \"N\" is large (lucene is not performant)\n# We're running a lot of queries each time we display the board.\n\nh3.Workaround\nRemove swimlanes or card colours from the configuration.\nPlease check KB article: [Kanban board loading is slow - performance problems|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRAKB/Kanban+board+loading+is+slow+-+performance+problems]\n\n",

      "description": "Hello\n\nh3. Feature suggestion\nIt would be great to have the ability to switch between different swimlanes on the fly, rather than having it being a board setting.\n\nh3. Use case\nAs a scrummaster, I need to have a board where I can see the sprint with swimlanes based on stories, so I can quickly spot what subtasks remain for each story.\n\nHowever for the daily scrum I need another board where swimlanes are based upon assignee. I had to create two boards, and each time I introduce a configuration change in one board, I have to copy it over to the other one.\n\nh3. Conclusion\nOther people or situation might also shed light on the need for other swimlanes, based upon the same board. Basically, to me, the swimlane should not be a hard coded setting in the board, but a quick filter that you can change any time depending on your current and ever changing need.",

      "description": "I know you ask that I search before adding an issue. However, search is very liberal and not easily filtered and so my issues are rarely addressed by search returns. I am giving written feedback as a last ditch effort to get some help, and even finding this took upwards of 5 minutes (way too long for a feedback box).\n\nMy main issue is that documentation explains features from a development perspective, which doesn't serve me as I am a business user and would like features discussed more broadly so that I may relate them to my work.\n\nDocumentation is either very sparse or not tagged well because, like I said, searching hardly every addresses my needs. I am rarely able to use documentation to solve my problems, and the learning curve on this product is steep so I've spent several months just fumbling around trying to \"figure it out.\" This product is so full of features and functional that it (and those who created it) deserve better documentation to help customers actually use and work with it. As things are, I use it sparingly because I never really know where to find things on a board designed for developers when I am in a very different business field. The features are also named and labeled using industry terms like \"scrum,\" which means nothing to me and requires research before I can know to look for something else, which is often also not labeled in a straight-forward manner.\n\nAt the moment, I am trying to learn the differences between various project types (for about the 5th time; thought I understood, but somehow I am constantly finding new info that wasn't available before...) as well as how to delete or back up data, none of which simple searches have been able to explain.\n\nI may not be developer-style computer savvy but I am no Luddite either, and this should be way easier. One good start would be to include a text box in the page-specific feedback area (instead of the multiple choice of three vague options). You'll get better page-specific feedback that may allow your teams to address needs better than via a separate task or suggestion that is now removed from its context... Another good place to start would be to consider that development language does not always translate across industries, and when you claim to address regular business needs, your help language should reflect that.\n\nI'm sorry if this sounds harsh. I like the product overall; I'm just very frustrated that help is so hard to come by. I can't even call anyone...",

Additionally, if people create boards that span Projects which they may not be Admins in, they cannot create Releases in those Projects and thus get an error when they try to create a Release on their board.\n\nSo the current default sub-filter is sub-optimal for us and we'd like to change it to something like:\n\n{code}resolution is EMPTY OR (resolution is not EMPTY AND resolved > -7d){code}\n\nso as to have things drop off our Kanban board automatically after 7 days which is a more logical way to manage a Kanban board rather than having to constantly create Releases to clear it.

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSWSERVER-13138].\n  {panel}\n\nAs a Greenhopper Scrum product owner, I want story estimates to automatically total to the sum of the estimates for all sub-tasks IF and ONLY IF subtasks are entered (else I want story estimates to be manual entry) so that I can view on the scrum board the original estimate against the remaining time.\n\nDefinition of Done:\n1)  When no sub-tasks exist for a story, the estimate field for the story allows entry of a value manually\n2)  When one or more sub-tasks exist for a story, the estimate field for the story is calculated as the sum of the estimates for all sub-tasks for that story\n\nContext:\n\nI'm finding a feature in Greenhopper to NOT operate as I would have expected. The feature is in estimating where the estimation on the scrum board is configured for original time estimates. What I would like is: \n1) when no sub-tasks are created for a story, the estimation and remaining fields are editable within the story \n2) when sub-tasks have been created, the story estimate and remaining fields are calculated as the sum of the estimate and remaining fields for the sub-tasks \n\nWhat's currently happening is that the story estimate field is not calculated from the sum of the sub-tasks but the story remaining field is. Worse, if you enter a value in the story estimate field when sub-tasks have been added and estimated, the value entered into the story estimate field is added to the story remaining field, which already has the sum of the sub-tasks. Thus, if, as a work around, you try to manually enter a story estimate that equals the sum of the sub-task estimates, the story remaining field value doubles. There's no work around for this. This feature seems poorly defined. I understand what the product team was trying to accomplish... the ability to estimate and view remaining values for stories that have no sub-tasks or prior to sub-tasks being added. What they missed is that the field could serve both functions - manual entry when no sub-tasks exist and calculated value when sub-tasks do exist. I strongly urge the product team to consider this feature at their earliest opportunity as the inability to see from the scrum board the original estimate against the remaining value in plan and work mode is a problem. \n\nh5. Steps to reproduce\n# Configure Scrum board to use \"Original Time Estimate\" for Estimation Statistic\n# Configure Scrum board to use \"Remaining Estimate and Time Spent\" for Time Tracking\n# Create an issue with issue type Story, without specifying any Original Estimate and Remaining Estimate\n# Create 2 sub-tasks for this issue.\n#* Sub-task 1 has Remaining Estimate of 4 hours\n#* Sub-task 2 has Remaining Estimate of 2 hours\n# Checking parent of sub-tasks in Issue View, Original Estimate and Remaining Estimate is now shown as 6 hours\n# Navigate back to Scrum board, open Issue Detail View, and Original Estimate for parent issue is _Unestimated_",
