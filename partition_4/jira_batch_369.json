You would have to manually rank them twice, using each ranking UI individually. Meaning that you would first go in and rank them all in the Parent Issue view. And then rank all of the sub tasks again on the board. \n\nI would expect the behavior to function basically the way updating ranking works when filtering by Epic on a backlog. You can update the relative order in just that epic. Then when you clear the filter the order of other issues has not changed.

When managing a 500-task backlog and 30-task sprints, losing half my screen real estate is frustrating, especially since my 1920px-wide monitor already has vast unused extra space in the middle of the page. \n\nInstead, I'd like the option for fields I add to show up on the one-line backlog \"card\" instead of forcing a 2-line display. \n\nideally, I'd like to the backlog \"card\" layout to be customizable so that I could choose which columns are shown (for example, hide the priority column that we don't use) and where they should be shown. For example, placement options could include: \n* first line - left \n* first line - right\n* second line - left\n* second line - right\n\nAnd so on. I'm sure there are other ways to define placement. But this kind of customization is definitely a lower priority than fixing the 2-line thing.

Step to reproduce\n# Go to *Custom Field*\n# Refer to *Sprint* field\n# Click on *cog* icon > *view*\n# The error is thrown like in the screenshot below\n!ghsprint.png|thumbnail!\n\nh3. Additional Information\n* It affects JIRA 6.3.10 with JIRA Agile 6.6.13 and JIRA 6.3.15 and JIRA Agile 6.6.70\n* Happens in Clean installation (no changes were made) \n* I think it's related with bug [GHS-11399|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/GHS-11399], but in this case, the sprint field *was never UNLOCKED*\n\nh3. Notes\nThis issue is a *JIRA UI problem* in the Field Configuration only. It indicates that JIRA cannot display the Default Value of the field, it does not affect your boards or prevent issues from being shown. Please continue using the [Troubleshooting guide|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRAKB/Issues+are+not+appearing+in+Boards] to find the reason issues are missing.\n",

For example, the quick filter of {{filter = \"Some Other Filter\"}} will be accepted when configuring, but when viewed by another user that does not have access to \"Some Other Filter\", the board will be empty when the quick filter is applied.\n\nIssue also applies to card coloring by JQL. If there is an issue, no cards will be color, but no error will be shown to make it clear there is an issue with the JQL.",
