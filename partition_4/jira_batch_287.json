We are using several custom issue types and have task board mappings and card configurations specific to the issue types. It is too easy for a project admin to completely wipe out these mappings and configurations (reset back to the default), or to accidentally apply one cards viewpoint to all the others. When this happens there is no quick way to recover them. It is necessary to reapply each configuration manually, assuming the admin can remember what they all were.\n\nThese configurations are becoming encoded in our business processes - users expect to see certain data on the cards and the cards in certain columns based upon mappings. Unintended sudden changes are not good.\n\nPlease provide some way of protecting these configurations by allowing the admin to export/import configurations (perhaps as XML), or by allowing configurations to be versioned and revertable. \n\nIt would also be useful to decouple the greenhopper administration tasks from the project administraton role if possible. We have several lead developers who have project administration rights (in order to add versions, components, set dates etc) but who shouldn't be able to change greenhopper configurations.",
