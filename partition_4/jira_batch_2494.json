Longer version\nI have developed a new Rails (4.1.4) app in JRuby (1.7.10) and I have been deploying it with Capistrano v3 on a remote vps for sometime. Now all of a sudden the deployer script can&#x27;t access the repository at Bitbucket. The error looks like:\n\n{code}\nDEBUG[a45f3340] Running /usr/bin/env git ls-remote -h git@bitbucket.org:ACCNAME/APPNAME.git on APPNAME.cloudapp.net\nDEBUG[a45f3340] Command: ( GIT_ASKPASS=/bin/echo GIT_SSH=/tmp/USER/git-ssh.sh /usr/bin/env git ls-remote -h git@bitbucket.org:ACCNAME/APPNAME.git )\nDEBUG[a45f3340] \tconq: repository access denied.\nDEBUG[a45f3340] \t\nDEBUG[a45f3340] \tfatal: Could not read from remote repository.\nDEBUG[a45f3340] \t\nDEBUG[a45f3340] \t\nDEBUG[a45f3340] \tPlease make sure you have the correct access rights\nDEBUG[a45f3340] \t\nDEBUG[a45f3340] \tand the repository exists.\nDEBUG[a45f3340] \t\nDEBUG[a45f3340] Finished in 4.289 seconds with exit status 128 (failed).\n{code}\n\nAlthough when I log into the remote server and run the same command it successfully executes and connects Bitbucket repo.\n\nThis is how the Gemfile looks like:\n\n{code}\nsource &#x27;https://rubygems.org&#x27;\n\nruby &#x27;1.9.3&#x27;, :engine => &#x27;jruby&#x27;, :engine_version => &#x27;1.7.10&#x27;\n\ngem &#x27;rails&#x27;, &#x27;4.1.4&#x27;\ngem &#x27;sass-rails&#x27;, &#x27;~> 4.0.3&#x27;\ngem &#x27;uglifier&#x27;, &#x27;>= 1.3.0&#x27;\ngem &#x27;therubyrhino&#x27;\ngem &#x27;jquery-rails&#x27;\ngem &#x27;jbuilder&#x27;, &#x27;~> 2.0&#x27;\ngem &#x27;sdoc&#x27;, &#x27;~> 0.4.0&#x27;, group: :doc\ngem &#x27;activerecord-jdbcmysql-adapter&#x27;\ngem &#x27;devise&#x27;\ngem &#x27;devise_invitable&#x27;, :github => &#x27;scambra/devise_invitable&#x27;\ngem \"paperclip\"\ngem &#x27;acts_as_list&#x27;\ngem &#x27;pry-rails&#x27;, group: :development\ngem &#x27;rubyzip&#x27;\ngem &#x27;to_bool&#x27;, &#x27;~> 1.0.1&#x27;\ngem \"jquery-fileupload-rails\"\n\n# Use Capistrano for deployment\ngem &#x27;capistrano&#x27;, group: :development\ngem &#x27;capistrano-rvm&#x27;, group: :development\ngem &#x27;capistrano-bundler&#x27;, group: :development\ngem &#x27;capistrano-rails&#x27;, group: :development\ngem &#x27;trinidad&#x27;, require: false\ngem &#x27;rvm1-capistrano3&#x27;, require: false\n{code}\n\nCapfile:\n\n{code}\nrequire &#x27;capistrano/setup&#x27;\nrequire &#x27;capistrano/deploy&#x27;\nrequire &#x27;capistrano/rvm&#x27;\nrequire &#x27;capistrano/bundler&#x27;\nrequire &#x27;capistrano/rails&#x27;\nrequire &#x27;capistrano/rails/assets&#x27;\nrequire &#x27;capistrano/rails/migrations&#x27;\nrequire &#x27;rvm1/capistrano3&#x27;\n\nDir.glob(&#x27;lib/capistrano/tasks/*.rake&#x27;).each { |r| import r }\n{code}\n\ndeploy.rb:\n\n{code}\n# config valid only for Capistrano 3.1\nlock &#x27;3.2.1&#x27;\n\nset :bundle_flags, &#x27;--deployment&#x27; # tried removing switch deployment if installing as system gem helps\n\nset :deploy_user, \"deployer\"\nset :application, &#x27;APPNAME&#x27;\nset :repo_url, &#x27;git@bitbucket.org:user/repo.git&#x27;\nserver \"example.net\", user: &#x27;deployer&#x27;, roles: [:web, :app, :db]\n\nset :rvm_type, :user                   \nset :rvm1_ruby_version, &#x27;jruby-1.7.10&#x27;\n\nset :scm, :git\nset :pty, true\nset :deploy_to, \"/home/#{fetch(:deploy_user)}/apps/#{fetch(:application)}\"\nset :linked_files, %w{config/database.yml}\nset :linked_dirs, %w{bin log tmp/pids tmp/cache tmp/sockets vendor/bundle public/system}\nset :keep_releases, 5\nafter \"deploy\", \"deploy:cleanup\"\n\nnamespace :deploy do\n  desc &#x27;Restart application&#x27;\n  task :restart do\n    on roles(:app), in: :sequence, wait: 5 do\n      execute :touch, release_path.join(&#x27;tmp/restart.txt&#x27;)\n    end\n  end\n\n  after :publishing, :restart\n\n  after :restart, :clear_cache do\n    on roles(:web), in: :groups, limit: 3, wait: 10 do\n      # Here we can do anything such as:\n      # within release_path do\n        execute :rake, &#x27;cache:clear&#x27;\n      # end\n    end\n  end\nend\n\nnamespace :deploy do\n  desc \"Install everything onto the server\"\n  task :install do\n    on roles(:all), in: :sequence, wait: 1 do\n      execute &#x27;mkdir&#x27;, &#x27;-p&#x27;, fetch(:deploy_to)\n      execute :sudo, &#x27;apt-get&#x27;, &#x27;-y&#x27;, \"update\"\n      execute :sudo, &#x27;apt-get&#x27;, &#x27;-y&#x27;, \"install\", \"build-essential zlib1g-dev libssl-dev libreadline-gplv2-dev python-software-properties curl git-core openjdk-7-jdk jsvc\"\n    end\n  end\nend\n{code}\n\nOne thing to note here, I was constantly getting an warning from rvm\n\n{code}\nWarning!

But this is what I am assuming. I might be wrong. I tried to reinstall the rvm of the server by {{cap production rvm1:install:rvm}}, but that didn&#x27;t help.\n\nCan anybody suggest what went wrong?",
