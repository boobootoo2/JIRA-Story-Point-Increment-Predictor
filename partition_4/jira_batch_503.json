Issue Summary\r\n\r\nWhen a user having \"Swedish\" language as profile language uses basic search to find issues created between a date range and that involves month October, they get an error\r\nh3.

Workaround\r\n\r\nFor now, the workaround would be that either when you choose the date from October month, after choosing it, you change it to \"Okt\" from \"Oct\" or I would recommend you to use Advanced issue search by clicking on \"Byt till JQL\" and using the query as below:\r\n{code:java}\r\ncreated >= 2020-09-28 AND created <= 2020-10-02 order by created DESC{code}",

      "description": "Hi JSD Product Team,\r\n\r\nMy name is Ahmed and I manage the Support Team at Noggin. We have recently migrated to JSD from Zendesk and we found a few items that need to be addressed from your end to make our Support process a little smoother.\r\n\u00a0\r\n*1)*\u00a0*JSD creating duplicate tickets*: Noggin uses 2 email domains (Noggin.io and Noggin.com.au). Both domains are pointed to the same mailbox. When an internal staff raises a support request from the\u00a0[noggin.io|http://noggin.io/]\u00a0email domain and then\u00a0responds using\u00a0the\u00a0[noggin.com.au|http://noggin.com.au/]\u00a0email domain, JSD is currently considering this as a new ticket (as opposed to considering it as coming from the same sender). When the support analyst finds this response sitting in the new tickets queue, they will need to mark it as solved and copy-paste the response in the original ticket. This is quite a time consuming and inefficient process.\r\n\r\n*Solution:*\u00a0Update JSD to identify that\u00a0[noggin.io|http://noggin.io/]\u00a0and\u00a0[noggin.com.au|http://noggin.com.au/]\u00a0email domains are the\u00a0same and link back to the same ticket.\r\n\u00a0\r\n*2)*\u00a0*Unable to merge tickets in JSD*: Continuing from (1), Zendesk had merge functionality that would automatically copy all the data from a ticket, paste it in the new ticket, and notify the user that the ticket has been merged and close that ticket. Please advise if we can add similar functionality in JSD as well?\r\n\u00a0\r\n*3)*\u00a0*Marking tickets as SPAM*: We receive spam emails every now and then. We simply mark them as \"Cancelled\". However, this doesn't stop the same sender from sending spam again in the future. When you mark a ticket as Spam in Zendesk and next time when the same sender is sending a ticket again, it doesn't go straight to the support queue. Instead, it goes into the suspended tickets section where all the spam tickets are recorded. Please advise if JSD has a similar \"Mark as Spam\" option?\r\n\u00a0\r\nThanks,--\r\n\r\n|[!https://ci3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/AeAd4jWDSOZeWmIBS5Vs-7p_aed38uNVOnElXMCb4DQSTqVjjuE1UOg5tulDCB8kpeqIN6Aj2ytV4n4AibDiKkfO_GhL1Q=s0-d-e1-ft#http://sig0.ngcache.net/static/email/logo2018v2.png|width=90!|https://www.noggin.io/]|Ahmed Ali Mohammed|\r\n|_Support Services Lead, Noggin_|\r\n|\r\n|\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0t:|+61 (0)2 9054 2153|\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0m:|+61 (0)404 134 755|\r\n|\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0e:|[amohammed@noggin.io|mailto:amohammed@noggin.io]|\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0w:\u00a0|[www.noggin.io|https://www.noggin.io/]|\u00a0|\r\n|\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0a:\u00a0|Level 22, 175 Liverpool Street, Sydney, NSW, Australia, 2000|\r\n|",

In our old ticket system we had a column that would simply say OPEN in red if the ticket was new and hadn't responded to, ANSWERED in green once one of our reps responded to the ticket, and then from there if the customer responds back the status would display PENDING in yellow. Alternating between ANSWERED and PENDING until the ticket is closed out.\r\n\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0- This would be beneficial because we can quickly tell from our Dashboards if the tickets in our queue are awaiting a response from us or from the client.
