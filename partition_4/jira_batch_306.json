Issue Summary\r\n\r\nEpics should disappear from the epic panel when either:\r\n # the epic itself is not complete\r\n # OR there are visible issues belonging to the epic. \r\n(For example, let's say an epic is marked as done but the last incomplete issue of the epic is in the active sprint.\r\n ## Change the issue to be done. The epic will still be visible in the epic panel as the issue is still visible.\r\n ## Complete the sprint. This will make the last issue in the epic disappear. The epic should then disappear from the epic panel.\r\n\r\nFor some backlogs, we have a problem where the epic does not disappear from the epic panel when the epic has issues in multiple done statuses.\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Create at least 2 issues in the epic on your team-managed backlog in the active sprint.\r\n ## Create an epic using epic panel\r\n ## Select the epic using the epic panel\r\n ## Create 2 issues in an active sprint: Issue A and Issue B\r\n # Configure your board to have 2 statuses in the Done status category.\r\n ## Navigate to Project settings > Columns and statuses screen.\r\n ## Click \"Manage workflow\" button and then \"Edit workflow\" to open the Workflow editor.\r\n ## Create another Done status and name the new status \"Abandoned\". There should be 2 status in the done status category - \"DONE\" and \"ABANDONED\".\r\n ## Save your changes. Make sure the columns on your board view have \"ABANDONED\" as the right-most column.\r\n!image-2021-10-26-15-26-27-655.png!\r\n # Update Issue A and B to be in \"ABANDONED\" status, and the epic to be in \"DONE\" status.\r\n # Complete the Sprint to make Issue A and Issue B disappear.

Keep issue B to be in \"ABANDONED\" status.\r\n!image-2021-10-26-15-43-30-102.png!\r\n # Navigate back to the backlog and see the epic still in the epic panel, but Issue A and Issue B are not visible.\r\n\r\n!image-2021-10-26-15-45-20-714.png!\r\nh3.
