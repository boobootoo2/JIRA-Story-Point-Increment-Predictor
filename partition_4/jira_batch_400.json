Jira support asked that I give feedback to GH support since there is no individual burndown chart. There is much value in an individual burndown chart for the dev team and for the product team as well. It would give me a better gage of how much projected work per sprint is being accomplished per person and would allow me to make adjustments accordingly. Also many of the devs have been inquiring of seeing their own burndown chart to see how they are resolving tasks per sprint and what is not getting resolved when applicable. It looks like this was a past feature from reading in support forums but not one available with the new boards?\n\nIs there an alternate way to allow devs to view their progress each sprint that is not manual?\n\nThanks\n{quote}",

This is a good enough tool to plan releases, see the trend of burning rate, able to predict a release date.\n\nHowever, in the [GreenHopper Rapid Board|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/GH/Creating+a+Board], all work is organized in [Sprints|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/GH/Creating+a+Sprint], completely independent from the Project Version.\n\nThe current [workaround|https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/42933/release-planning-in-rapid-board] is to create independent Rapid Boards.
