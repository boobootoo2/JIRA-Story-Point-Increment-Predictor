The attribute naming across sources is inconsistent so we have some data that is difficult to track. For example, location data is very different from source to source. So we would like to implement an automation rule that will edit the location attribute of the object based on its IP Address. However, the only way to do this is to use the Object trigger and have the rule run every time an object is created/updated/deleted. For most of our use cases, this is unnecessary and the rules often fail due to throttling because there is no way to control what types of object the rule will trigger for. Allowing users to run a scheduled rule that use IQL to look for objects in a schema, would increase the capabilities of the tool and allow for users to solve use cases like this.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n!image-2021-06-22-09-24-30-940.png!\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n!image-2021-06-22-09-25-00-369.png!",

Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n # On a next-gen project, create a request type that has the exact workflow and field configuration with email request.\r\n # Change the request type by click on the Issue Type Icon beside the Issue Key from 'Email Request' to the new request type above\r\n # When selecting another Issue type it redirects to the Move issue screen.\r\n\r\nNote: This only occurs when the destination request type is a 'custom' one. Changing to a 'default' request type does not trigger the move screen, neither does changing from the custom request type to a 'default' request (or email request)\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nIf the request types have the same Workflow and field configurations, it has to change the Issue type directly without redirecting to the Move issue screen.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nIn spite of having the same workflow are field configurations, it still redirects to the Move issue screen whenever an issue is moved FROM the 'Email Request' request type\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nCurrently, there is no known workaround for this behaviour. A workaround will be added here when available",
