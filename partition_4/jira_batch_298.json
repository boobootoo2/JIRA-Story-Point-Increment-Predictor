Problem Definition\r\n\r\nInsights in a sprint's board shows completed issues as not yet *Done* if the *Done* status is not in the last (rightmost) column on the board.\r\n\r\nJira business logic defines issues that are in the last column as complete. Any issues that aren\u2019t in the last column on the board will be considered incomplete, irrespective of the status category mapped to that column.\r\n\r\nCurrently, we can edit the workflow to add multiple statuses in the\u00a0*Done\u00a0category* but Jira doesn't use this category to calculate the\u00a0*Done*\u00a0status in the Insights data. Instead, it calculates the rightmost column as\u00a0*Done*.\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nUpdate Jira's Insights logic where \u2018Done\u2019 is based on a status category or workflow and not column position.\r\nh3. Why this is important\r\n\r\nUsers with workflows that do not have \u2018Done\u2019 or \u2018Done\u2019 mapped to the last column will not be able to use reports for insights.\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nTo mitigate any problems, try this workaround:\r\n # Go to\u00a0*Board*\u00a0>\u00a0*Manage workflow*.\r\n # Add the removed Done status to your workflow. Give the status the same name as previously used in your workflow and reports.\r\n # At this stage, avoid adding any incoming transitions.\r\n # Save and publish the workflow.\r\n # From your board, navigate to the More actions (*\u2022\u2022\u2022*) >\u00a0*Board settings*.\r\n # In\u00a0*Columns and statuses*, move the Done status to the rightmost column.\r\n # Hit save.\r\n # Your reports should behave as before. Add any incoming transitions to the status.\r\n\r\n\u00a0h3. Other Notes\r\nThis is very similar to [JSWCLOUD-15106|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSWCLOUD-15106] except that this one is specific to Insights functionality in the board, while JSWCLOUD-15106 is focusing on the reports logic.",

Issue Summary\r\n\r\nThe new\u00a0{{Insights}}\u00a0Feature on the Scrum board shows the Estimation data based on the Estimate statistic set for the board (Either Story Points or Time).\r\n Currently seems like Insights only checks for Story Points on\u00a0{{Standard Issue}}\u00a0Types and doesn\u2019t calculate on the\u00a0{{sub-task}}\u00a0story point\u2026 So if a parent story has no story points and the Sub-tasks does, Insight doesn\u2019t show any progress on the progress bar (Right-hand side of the board).\r\n Currently, we do not have any ability, to sum up story points from sub-tasks and populate them to its Parent Estimation Field https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSWCLOUD-9167. So it is not possible to populate the Sum of Story Points in The Parent Issue's Story Points as of now.\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Enable the Insights Feature for your boards.\r\n # Create a Sprint and Create a Standard Issue Type with some Sub-Tasks. (For Testing add 2 sub-tasks)\r\n # Add the Standard Issue to the newly created Sprint and Start the Sprint.\r\n # Make sure the *Board Settings* > *Estimation* > *Estimation Statistic* is set to \"Story Points\"\r\n\r\n*Scenario 1:*\r\n * Add some Story Points to Sub-Tasks. Leave the Parent Story Points to Zero.\r\n * Go to the board and Move only one Sub-Task from \"To Do\" to \"In Progress\".\r\n * At this point Insights should show \"Not Started\" to be 50% and \"In Progress\" status to be 50% On Insights, as one sub-task is in \"To Do\" and the other in \"In Progress\"\r\n * Sub-Tasks Story Points are Ignored and Progress Bar Doesn't Update. It stays to be 100% for \"Not Started/To Do\" and also for \"In Progress\"\r\n !image-2021-08-08-01-15-35-145.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\n*Scenario 2:*\r\n * Add some Story Points to Sub-Tasks. Also Manually add the sum of sub-task Story points to the Parent Issue's Story Points.\r\n * Go to the board and Move the Parent Issue and only one of the sub-tasks from \"To Do\" to \"In Progress\".\r\n * At this point Insight should show \"Not Started\" to be 50% and \"In Progress\" status to be 50% as one sub-task is in \"To Do\" and the other in \"In Progress\" for the Parent Issue in the Sprint.\r\n * Sub-Task Story Points are Ignored and currently only Standard Issue Type Story Points are considered and hence the \"Not Started/To Do\" is 0% and \"In Progress\" is 100% in the Progress bar.\r\n !image-2021-08-08-01-18-57-525.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nWhen there are one or more Sub-Tasks under a Parent/Standard Issue Type, Calculate the Insight Statistics with the help of Sub-Task Story Points and not with the Standard Issue Story Points.\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nSub-Task Story Points are Ignored when calculating Insights Statistics... Only Parent/Standard Issue Type Story points are taken into account... Hence, when you move one of the 2 sub-task forward on the board, Insights still show no progress.\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n # No workaround at the moment for Standard Issue Types and Sub-Tasks.\r\n # *Insights is capable of calculating correctly when the relationship is between Epic and Standard Issue Types.*\r\n\r\nh4. {color:#4c9aff}Possible Workaround: (But not complete){color}\r\n * Create an Automation Rule that sums up all the Sub-Tasks Story Points and adds it to their Parent Story Points field. Add or subtract the parent story point accordingly, when a new sub-task is added or an existing sub-task is removed.\r\n * Create another automation rule that is when *ALL* the sub-task under a parent move from \"To Do\" to \"In Progress\", the parent automatically moves to \"In Progress\" so that the *Insights* shows 100% when all the Sub-Tasks reach a common Status on the board.",

The proposed \"solution\" is to make the display of the detail a USER PREFERENCE that can be enabled or disabled per board (either Kanban or Scrum)\n\nSimilar to GHS-10182 - however, that request wanted to make it an ADMIN function to disable the detail view per board, which does not fit with a sub-set of users.",
