Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n# Create a project in JIRA with Service Desk\r\n# Associate two groups (let's say group A and group B) with the Service Desk Team role\r\n# Grant the \"Assign Issue\" permission only to group A and \"Current Assignee\", and remove the Service Desk Team from this permission (be sure that group B is not included here)\r\n# Grant the \"Assignable user\" permission to the Service Desk Team (which will include the two groups)\r\n\r\nh3. Current behaviour\r\n\r\n- The user from group B won't be able to assign issues, neither reassign issues assigned to him as it should. If you test this same behaviour on any other JIRA project which doesn't use Service Desk, it will work fine.\r\n- Accessing Service Desk will result in an error screen. This screen is attached in this ticket.\r\n- Clicking on the \"Repair\" option of the error message will add the \"Service Desk Team\" project role to the permissions again.\r\n- Clicking on the \"Repair\" option will also display the list of \"wrong\" configurations in the permission scheme.\r\n\r\nh3. Why it would be useful to work like this?\r\n\r\nUsers may be agents and work in Service Desk tickets, but with restrictions. In this case, the users will be an agent, as he will work on the tickets but he will have restrictions, as he will only be able to work in tickets assigned to him.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected behaviour\r\n\r\nIf the user is already counting as an Agent (hence not going against the new license policy), allow the permission to be properly customised as in other JIRA projects which doesn't user Service Desk\r\n\r\nh3. Obs.\r\n\r\n- Please notice that this will occur for many other permissions as well, such as \"Edit Issues\", etc.\r\n- This is related to the new licensing, as these configurations worked as expected in Service Desk 1.2.7, as the \"Service Desk Team\" project role could be removed from any permission of the project.\r\n- The \"Repair\" message refers to some of the permissions as \"recommended\" when they are actually mandatory, maybe we should also adjust this message.",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSDCLOUD-1002].\n  {panel}\n\nHi guys/gals, thought I'd try and offer some suggestions from what I'm seeing in your ServiceDesk plugin.\r\n\r\nI'd raised a ticket with  yourselves about the SLA's not sorting and being all over the place. But your guy Yit Wei explained what was happening for me (https://support.atlassian.com/servicedesk/customer/portal/3/SDS-1941). While I get it and understand it, this still leaves me having to apologise to the ServiceDesk manager who now can't really show the data in the format that she wants in her month end reports. The only way round this is going to be Structure Plugin, that allows her to go and resort these as she likes.\r\n\r\nWhile I get that for a SD user, this is OK, If they're completed most of the SLAs will not be an issue. But for a month/year end report on tickets, you'd expect this to be achievable.\r\n\r\nSo while you have a complex field that renders the information on the screen, it's not that sortable. Though setting an SLA filter and a Subscription, allows you to get the data pretty well output to email, which you can then paste into excel. So that's the only option she has to manually sort it once it is spat out from JIRA.\r\n\r\nMy suggestion would be to have a separate field, that wouldn't necessarily  be viewable, that you could referance when doing your sort. I'm no programmer, but I would like to think that you could do something that would generate the figure in a natural number format that could be output and then sorted. Leaving the original SLA fields as is, since they are so handy to use and see what is live. But at least you'd be able to sort them on SLA, rather than just the live ones.\r\n\r\nAs to the existing method of sorting, I'd probably suggest that they would be sortable via a secondary \"order by\", if that is possible.\r\n\r\nAnyway am rambling now. Please let me know if you manage to update any of these.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nGraeme A",

The inability to assign issues to Collaborators or allow Collaborators to log work against the ticket is serious blocker to our adopting the product. Without a change in this functionality we cannot adopt Service Desk--as much as I like the offering.\r\n\r\nThe advice proposed in the documentation is to clone tickets into another project or to mention developers to get their attention.\r\n\r\nCloning or duplicating issues doesn't really work for us and is only applicable to an actual bug report where multiple support issues were raised on it. Most cases that can't be resolved by an agent are escalated to a developer or PM for 2nd/3rd level review. Simply mentioning a Jira user isn't accountable enough, it needs assignable and trackable without duplicating the tickets.\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration.",

      "description": "When running tests against Service Desk, I often get a 'Cannot scroll element into view' error, caused by an SD dialog that's too big for my browser window.\r\n\r\nUse case: Adding calendars in ServiceDesk in webdriver test. Running test on local machine with Firefox. Firefox defaults to a ~800x800 screen.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the calendars are added, the test will attempt to click closeButton. The button is off screen (see screenshot). Apparently there's an {{overflow: hidden}} or similar somewhere, preventing Selenium to scroll towards the button.\r\n\r\nI have seen this behaviour on multiple dialogs in ServiceDesk.\r\n\r\nMy workaround is to quickly go to Firefox and resize the screen before the tests are at the calendar dialog. This is annoying. \r\n\r\nWhile it might be a minor issue, I feel that this should be addressed.\r\n\r\nIs this a known issue?

Users with this role are banned from accessing JIRA functionality. That is for sure reasonable. The problem is that JIRA also deny request to the REST API's.\r\n\r\nAs add-on developers we would like the \"Customer\" role to have access to the plugins REST API's. If not, our [Insight add-on |https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.riadalabs.jira.plugins.insight] will be impossible to enable on the Customer Portal for the \"Customer\" role. We can of course have simple custom field rendered from the server side, but our more advanced Insight custom field acts from the user behaviour and wouldn't scale if doing this from the server side\r\n\r\nWe have been asked why we like to share information/content to ServiceDesk \"Customers\". There are several reasons for that, but one example is if you are a company renting out video cameras, you want the customers to report bugs on those assets via the ServiceDesk portal. The assets is of course within the Insight plugin.\r\n\r\nAs of right now, our add-on works perfectly for users that have the USE permission but it doesn't work for users of the Customer role. We have several customers that really needs the Insight Custom Field to work for the \"Customer\" role so we hope you will make the REST-API open for the plugin developers to decide who can access the plugin services or not. \r\n\r\nThe client request: https://domainname:port/rest/..  gets a HTTP 302. We cannot see any drawbacks by allowing access to the REST API's where you as today, are redirecting all requests. The authorization should be handled by the plugin developers as we do in any other case. \r\n\r\nLet me know if you have any questions or more information you need. This is very urgent for us.
