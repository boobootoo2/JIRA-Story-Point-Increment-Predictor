I request to change the text to \"View all branch plans\" with the following justification:\r\n\r\nI had an old PR whose branch plan had expired.  I wanted to re-enable or re-create the branch plan.  Not being familiar with how branch plan expiry works, I wasn't sure exactly how to do this, but I assumed it should be obvious enough how to do this.\r\n\r\nI got tripped up, however, by the \"View all branches\" link.  Assuming based on the name of the link that this would let me see all branches, and from there I could re-enable or re-create the branch plan, I was confused when the resulting page didn't have my branch listed.  I was going to file a bug report saying that somehow my branch had been lost from Bamboo, but first I got a more experienced Bamboo user to check my work.  At that point I realized that the \"View all branches\" link actually takes you to a list of branch *plans*, and then of course it made sense that my expired branch plan was not listed.\r\n\r\nIt's true that the linked page does have the text \"Plan branches\" in bold near the top, but it also has a tab title of just \"Branches\" and a URL ending in \"..../branches\".  More consistent naming would help with discovery for other novice users like me.\r\n\r\nAlso consider renaming the \"Branches\" tab to \"Branch Plans\", and possibly include text or a link to aid in discovery of the \"Actions => Configure Plan => Branches => Create plan branch\" button.\r\n\r\nThanks for considering!",

Workarounds\r\nh4. Workaround A: Upgrade + remote agents already connected via SSL\r\n\r\nUse this workaround if your goal is to upgrade to an affected version (e.g. 5.10.3 to 5.12.2.1) and you already have a remote agent connected to the Bamboo server using SSL.\r\n # Install the remote agent but note that this bug will prevent it from connecting. Refer to the [Bamboo remote agent installation guide|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/BAMBOO/Bamboo+remote+agent+installation+guide] for details.\r\n # Stop the remote agent.\r\n # Copy the keys (.ks & .ts) from a *working* remote agent to the newly installed agent. You'll find the keys here:\r\n ** {{BAMBOO_AGENT_HOME/xml-data/configuration/jmsclient.ks}}\r\n ** {{BAMBOO_AGENT_HOME/xml-data/configuration/jmsclient.ts}}\r\n # Start the remote agent.\r\n\r\nh4. Workaround B: Add secure remote agents for the first time\r\n\r\nUse this workaround if you are already running the affected version and for the first time you need to set up a secure remote agent.\r\n # Follow the instructions to create certificates manually. Refer to instructions on [How to secure your remote agent (Bamboo Server)|https://confluence.atlassian.com/bamkb/how-to-secure-your-remote-agent-bamboo-server-757465762.html] for details.\r\n # Add the newly created certificates to the Java truststore ({{cacerts}} is the default truststore). For example, this is how to import the manually created certificate \"bamboo.secure.server.crt\" into the Java truststore using Linux:\r\n{code:java}\r\nsudo keytool -import -trustcacerts -file /opt/atlassian/home/atlassian-bamboo-5.12.2.1/xml-data/configuration/bamboo.secure.server.crt -alias \"bamboo.secure.server\" -keystore $JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security/cacerts\r\n{code}\r\n\r\n # Configure both the Bamboo server and the agent(s) to not use the automatic certificates but the manually created ones instead by passing in the {{-Dbamboo.manage.jms.ssl=false}} JVM parameter on startup:\r\n ** Bamboo server\r\n{code:java|title=<bamboo-install>/bin/setenv.sh}\r\nJVM_SUPPORT_RECOMMENDED_ARGS=\"-Dbamboo.manage.jms.ssl=false -Djavax.net.ssl.keyStore=/opt/atlassian/home/atlassian-bamboo-5.12.2.1/xml-data/configuration/bamboo.secure.server.ks -Djavax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword=changeit -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_73.jdk/Contents/Home/jre/lib/security/cacerts -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword=changeit\"\r\n{code}\r\n\r\n ** Bamboo remote agent(s)\r\n{code:java|title=<bamboo-agent-home>/conf/wrapper.conf}\r\n# The Bamboo Agent home configuration file\r\nwrapper.java.additional.1=-Dbamboo.home=/opt/atlassian/agent/atlassian-bamboo-5.12.2.1\r\nwrapper.java.additional.2=-Dbamboo.agent.ignoreServerCertName=false\r\nwrapper.java.additional.3=-Dbamboo.manage.jms.ssl=false\r\nwrapper.java.additional.4=-Djavax.net.ssl.keyStore=/opt/atlassian/home/atlassian-bamboo-5.12.2.1/xml-data/configuration/bamboo.secure.client.ks\r\nwrapper.java.additional.5=-Djavax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword=changeit\r\nwrapper.java.additional.6=-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_73.jdk/Contents/Home/jre/lib/security/cacerts\r\n#wrapper.java.additional.3=-Dlog4j.configuration=\r\n#wrapper.java.additional.3=-agentlib:yjpagent\r\n\r\n# Application parameters.

Scenario C: Revert to use TCP instead of SSL until this issue is fixed.\r\n\r\nUse this workaround if securing your remote agents isn't required at this time.\r\n # Shut down the Bamboo server.\r\n # Shut down the agent(s).\r\n # Change the protocol of your *Broker URL* and *Broker client URL* in the {{bamboo.cfg.xml}} file to 'TCP'. _Do not_ change the address of this URL. For example, a final solution:\r\n{noformat}\r\n<property name=\"bamboo.jms.broker.uri\">tcp://0.0.0.0:myport</property>\r\n<property name=\"bamboo.jms.broker.client.uri\">failover:(tcp://myhost:myport)</property>\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\n # Start up the Bamboo server.\r\n # Start up the Bamboo agent(s).",

Workaround\r\nTo workaround this issue, users should configure LDAP specific caching as instructed in the below documentation:\r\nhttps://confluence.atlassian.com/bamboo/configuring-the-caching-of-your-ldap-repository-289277216.html\r\n\r\nh5. Suggestion\r\nUse non-eternal caching for LDAP by default so that elements have a timeout and refreshed accordingly.\r\n\r\n",

I recently re-performed the setup, intended to run as 'bamboo' instead of root.  I now also have it running as a service, and I added \"plymouthbuild\" to my /etc/hosts so that I don't have to refer to myself by an IP address.\r\n\r\nWhen the service was up and running I accessed the main page (http://plymouthbuild:8085) and I was prompted to enter my license key.  I re-entered the same key that I used when I did this the first time.  (I bought one of those $10 keys).\r\n\r\nThe page changed and said \"please wait while setting up bamboo...\" or something like that.  It never did finish.  It just sat there showing me that spinny-graphic and saying \"please wait\".\r\n\r\nI got bored and opened http://plymouthbuild:8085 again, only this time I was asked to setup the administrator account, so I did.

      "description": "Not only does Bamboo not have support for Git LFS, but the way in which Bamboo works conflicts with Git LFS in (at least) the following ways: \r\n\r\n1. The \"Source Code Checkout\" task utilizes a local cache which is not a full mirror of the remote repository, so it does not contain LFS objects. (Git LFS does not support the \"file:///\" protocol anyways.)\r\n2. Branch builds with merging enabled do not work with Git LFS because they leave the raw LFS files in a modified state, which causes Git LFS to ignore them when performing a pull or checkout. \r\n3. The saved credentials within Bamboo are unavailable to custom scripts/commands (such as a custom Git LFS script), so they have to be manually configured and separately maintained. \r\n\r\nI understand that BAM-17160 already covers Git LFS support, but I wanted to ensure that the specific issues that I've encountered are addressed when Git LFS support is added.

In this example we will call it *ATL*:\r\n\r\n# {noformat}sudo docker run --name=\"ATL\" -e HOME=/root/ -i -t atlassian/bamboo-java-agent:latest /bin/bash{noformat}\r\nOnce you run this command you'll get automatically logged in to the container.\r\n\r\nh5. Step 2: Install additional Ubuntu packages\r\n\r\nWe have to add some packages to Ubuntu so we can install Java through the command line:\r\n\r\n# {noformat}sudo apt-get install python-software-properties{noformat}\r\n# {noformat}sudo apt-get update{noformat}\r\n# {noformat}sudo apt-get install software-properties-common{noformat}\r\n\r\nh5. Step 3: Install Java\r\n\r\nIn this example we will download Java 8 from the [Webup8|http://www.webupd8.org/2012/09/install-oracle-java-8-in-ubuntu-via-ppa.html] repository. In this step you can use any repository you want to download Java 8 from. This is only one example of repository that you can use to download Java 8 from. Use this at your own risk.\r\n\r\n# {noformat}sudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/java{noformat}\r\n# {noformat}sudo apt-get update{noformat}\r\n# {noformat}sudo apt-get install oracle-java8-installer{noformat}\r\n\r\nNow we have to set up the Java 8 environment variables:\r\n\r\n# {noformat}sudo apt-get install oracle-java8-set-default{noformat}\r\n# {noformat}export JAVA_HOME=path/to/jdk/install{noformat}\r\n# {noformat}export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH{noformat}\r\n\r\nh5. Step 4: Building your own image\r\n\r\nHere you will create a new image from the container you've installed Java 8. Without closing the terminal window you're using to access the container, open a *new* terminal window and run:\r\n# {noformat}sudo docker commit ATL customized-bamboo-java-agent:1.0.0{noformat}\r\n\r\nh5. Step 5: Verify your custom image\r\n\r\nRun the following command from the terminal window to check your current docker images. You should see your customized image named {{customized-bamboo-java-agent}} in the list with TAG {{1.0.0}}.\r\n\r\n# {noformat}docker images{noformat}\r\n\r\nh5. Step 6: Start your customized Docker image\r\n\r\n# {noformat}sudo docker run -e HOME=/root/ -e BAMBOO_SERVER=http://hostname:port/bamboo -i -t customized-bamboo-java-agent:1.0.0{noformat}\r\n\r\n{panel}",

Problem Definition\r\nThe remote agent authentication tab does not display show any association between the authentication entry, agent UUID and the _real_ agent that this corresponds to. This make managing the authentication entries difficult with higher agent counts.\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\nImplement a link between Agent UUID and Agent ID. The Agent Authentication tab could display:\r\n* Existing agents (hostname) that the authentication entry applies to. If the authentication entry does not link to an existing agent, the UI should say as much.\r\n* For hosts with multiple agents, it'd be beneficial to also display the agent home directory location in the agent summary screen.\r\n* The agent summary should display linked UUIDs / approval. Being able to revoke authentication from this UI would also be beneficial.\r\n* BAM-18647: deletion of an agent should revoke the access as well (cleaning agent_authentication table for that agent only).\r\n \r\nh3. Workaround  1\r\nThe only way to map a Bamboo remote agent back to its UUID / Agent Authentication is via the filesystem on the remote agent. The details are stored in the *<bamboo-agent-home>/bamboo-agent.cfg.xml*. Example below:\r\n{code}\r\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\" standalone=\"no\"?>\r\n<configuration>\r\n<buildWorkingDirectory>/root/bamboo-agent-home/xml-data/build-dir</buildWorkingDirectory>\r\n<agentUuid>ff674641-a868-43ef-9e92-c2e67fbef71b</agentUuid>\r\n<agentDefinition>\r\n<id>70189058</id>\r\n<name>localhost</name>\r\n<description>Remote agent on host localhost</description>\r\n</agentDefinition>\r\n</configuration>\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nUsing the UUID and *name* of the agent, you can then track this back to the authentication entry. \r\n\r\nFurthermore you use the information from the *bamboo-agent.cfg.xml* to query the following database tables like in the below example (there is no link between agent ID and UUID in the database though):\r\n{code}\r\n// Using agentUuid from bamboo-agent.cfg.xml\r\nSELECT * FROM AGENT_AUTHENTICATION WHERE UUID = 'ff674641-a868-43ef-9e92-c2e67fbef71b';\r\n\r\n// Using id from bamboo-agent.cfg.xml\r\nSELECT * FROM QUEUE WHERE QUEUE_ID = 70189058;\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround 2\r\nEnable TRACE log level for class {{com.atlassian.bamboo.buildqueue.manager.RemoteAgentManagerImpl}} and in logs it will print agent id and UUID from heartbeat agent messages. Then follow steps from Workaround 1 to map agent id to agent name",

      "description": "h3. Summary\r\nThe API call Bamboo makes to Bitbucket Cloud after build completion to update the build status may occasionally fail for various reasons. It appears Bamboo makes no attempt to retry or reconcile these calls should they fail. Consequently, build status information in Bitbucket Cloud will be left incorrect or incomplete should these calls fail.\r\n\\\\\r\n\\\\\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\nIssue is intermittent in most cases but having two build plans that trigger on the same commit appears to be a reliable way to reproduce the behavior.\r\n# Configure Bamboo to use a Bitbucket Cloud repository\r\n# Create two build plans that build from that same repository\\branch\r\n# Configure plan triggers to execute plans on commit\r\n# Enable debug logging for the following packages in Bamboo\r\n{{com.atlassian.bamboo.plugins.bitbucket.api.BitbucketApiException}}\r\n{{com.atlassian.bamboo.plugins.bitbucket.api.BitbucketApiService}}\r\n# Make a commit in the Bitbucket Cloud repository in order to trigger the build plans\r\n\r\n\\\\\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nBamboo updates the build status on completion and the correct status for all builds executed is reflected in Bitbucket Cloud.\r\n\\\\\r\n\\\\\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nIf the post build status update fails, build status is either not present or incomplete in Bitbucket Cloud and will remain as such.\r\n\r\nLogs will contain varying levels of error detail depending on how the call failed. Below message is most common.\r\n{noformat}\r\n2016-04-19 02:26:20,549 INFO [AtlassianEvent::0-BAM::EVENTS:pool-2-thread-3] [BitbucketBuildStatusUpdater] Unable to sent build status update to Bitb\r\nucket\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nIn addition, Bitbucket Cloud may return an HTTP error code response that will cause the call to fail.\r\n\r\n{noformat}2016-04-19 00:31:42.430491500 com.atlassian.bamboo.plugins.bitbucket.api.BitbucketApiException: com.sun.jersey.api.client.UniformInterfaceException: POST https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/rgouldSE/testrepo/commit/a01e4577d962fa7b1904f90b29f122ea7daa7117/statuses/build returned a response status of 503 Service Unavailable\r\n2016-04-19 00:31:42.430492500 \tat com.atlassian.bamboo.plugins.bitbucket.impl.BitbucketApiServiceImpl.updateBuildStatus(BitbucketApiServiceImpl.java:167)\r\n2016-04-19 00:31:42.430507500 \tat com.atlassian.bamboo.plugins.bitbucket.events.BitbucketBuildStatusUpdater.lambda$buildStatusUpdater$2(BitbucketBuildStatusUpdater.java:114)\r\n2016-04-19 00:31:42.430508500 \tat com.atlassian.bamboo.plugins.bitbucket.events.BitbucketBuildStatusUpdater$$Lambda$171/19284880.accept(Unknown Source)\r\n2016-04-19 00:31:42.430508500 \tat java.util.stream.ForEachOps$ForEachOp$OfRef.accept(ForEachOps.java:184)\r\n2016-04-19 00:31:42.430510500 \tat java.util.stream.ReferencePipeline$2$1.accept(ReferencePipeline.java:175)\r\n2016-04-19 00:31:42.430511500 \tat java.util.Iterator.forEachRemaining(Iterator.java:116)\r\n2016-04-19 00:31:42.430514500 \tat java.util.Spliterators$IteratorSpliterator.forEachRemaining(Spliterators.java:1801)\r\n2016-04-19 00:31:42.430514500 \tat java.util.stream.AbstractPipeline.copyInto(AbstractPipeline.java:512)\r\n2016-04-19 00:31:42.430515500 \tat java.util.stream.AbstractPipeline.wrapAndCopyInto(AbstractPipeline.java:502)\r\n2016-04-19 00:31:42.430515500 \tat java.util.stream.ForEachOps$ForEachOp.evaluateSequential(ForEachOps.java:151)\r\n2016-04-19 00:31:42.430521500 \tat java.util.stream.ForEachOps$ForEachOp$OfRef.evaluateSequential(ForEachOps.java:174)\r\n2016-04-19 00:31:42.430522500 \tat java.util.stream.AbstractPipeline.evaluate(AbstractPipeline.java:234)\r\n2016-04-19 00:31:42.430522500 \tat java.util.stream.ReferencePipeline.forEach(ReferencePipeline.java:418)\r\n2016-04-19 00:31:42.430522500 \tat com.atlassian.bamboo.plugins.bitbucket.events.BitbucketBuildStatusUpdater.send(BitbucketBuildStatusUpdater.java:79)\r\n2016-04-19 00:31:42.430524500 \tat com.atlassian.bamboo.build.status.AbstractBuildStatusUpdater.handleEvent(AbstractBuildStatusUpdater.java:60)\r\n2016-04-19 00:31:42.430525500 \tat sun.reflect.GeneratedMethodAccessor3381.invoke(Unknown Source)\r\n2016-04-19 00:31:42.430525500 \tat sun.reflect.DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.java:43)\r\n2016-04-19 00:31:42.430525500 \tat java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Method.java:497)\r\n2016-04-19 00:31:42.430528500 \tat com.atlassian.event.internal.SingleParameterMethodListenerInvoker.invoke(SingleParameterMethodListenerInvoker.java:36)\r\n2016-04-19 00:31:42.430528500 \tat com.atlassian.event.internal.AsynchronousAbleEventDispatcher$1$1.run(AsynchronousAbleEventDispatcher.java:46)\r\n2016-04-19 00:31:42.430529500 \tat java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.runWorker(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:1142)\r\n2016-04-19 00:31:42.430529500 \tat java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor$Worker.run(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:617)\r\n2016-04-19 00:31:42.430530500 \tat com.atlassian.bamboo.utils.BambooRunnables$1.run(BambooRunnables.java:49)\r\n2016-04-19 00:31:42.430531500 \tat com.atlassian.bamboo.security.ImpersonationHelper.runWith(ImpersonationHelper.java:31)\r\n2016-04-19 00:31:42.430531500 \tat com.atlassian.bamboo.security.ImpersonationHelper.runWithSystemAuthority(ImpersonationHelper.java:20)\r\n2016-04-19 00:31:42.430532500 \tat com.atlassian.bamboo.security.ImpersonationHelper$1.run(ImpersonationHelper.java:52)\r\n2016-04-19 00:31:42.430533500 \tat java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:745)\r\n2016-04-19 00:31:42.430533500 Caused by: com.sun.jersey.api.client.UniformInterfaceException: POST https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/rgouldSE/testrepo/commit/a01e4577d962fa7b1904f90b29f122ea7daa7117/statuses/build returned a response status of 503 Service Unavailable\r\n2016-04-19 00:31:42.430537500 \tat com.sun.jersey.api.client.WebResource.voidHandle(WebResource.java:697)\r\n2016-04-19 00:31:42.430537500 \tat com.sun.jersey.api.client.WebResource.access$400(WebResource.java:74)\r\n2016-04-19 00:31:42.430538500 \tat com.sun.jersey.api.client.WebResource$Builder.post(WebResource.java:548)\r\n2016-04-19 00:31:42.430539500 \tat com.atlassian.bamboo.plugins.bitbucket.impl.BitbucketApiServiceImpl.updateBuildStatus(BitbucketApiServiceImpl.java:157)\r\n2016-04-19 00:31:42.430540500 \t... 26 more\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nh3.Workaround\r\nNo known workaround.",

This sometimes creates a trap for users switching from internal to external user directories, since they are not able to create groups in Bamboo to match the groups from the external directory (if they have spaces or upper-case characters) to give them the correct permissions before actually switching to the new directory.\r\n     \r\nh4. Suggested Solution\r\nAllow Bamboo to handle groups creation with upper-case, lower-case characters and spaces.\r\n \r\nh4.

After that you are able to add the groups from the external directory to the correct permissions (even when they have spaces or upper-case characters). ",

We plan to have parallel plans in the system and we might be running either the 25 remote agent or 100 remote agent level with many different test platforms attached and deployment processes too.\r\n\r\nwe're also integrating with the full atlassian suite (JIRA, bitbucket, confluence, hipchat)\r\n\r\nThe [best practices section|https://confluence.atlassian.com/bamboo/bamboo-best-practice-system-requirements-388401170.html] is vague.\r\n\r\nWe don't have an installation so there is nothing to be measured locally. It is shocking that there is no information like this from atlassian.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting that every other question I've asked has been answered quickly. This one is a run around. Searching forums you never know what you're going to get and you can't compare results because of system variances from person to person.\r\n\r\nIt is also surprising that there are no hardware tiers above 16 core, and the low amount of ram. I wonder what happens when you higher. I didn't see any hardware recommendations for remote agents either\r\n\r\nVery disappointed",
