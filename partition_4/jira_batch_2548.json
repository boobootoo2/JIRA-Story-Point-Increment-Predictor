Yes you can go and edit, but the post will have already been emailed to who knows who, and when you fix your comment they will get it all over again - that begins to feel spammy.\n\nSo an edit option to take you back into typing mode from the preview would do the trick.\n\nCheers\\\\\nAndrew",

Something has gone terribly wrong...\u201d on all three tabs (Diff/Commits/Activity).

The participants icons at the top right still show the involved people though, so I\u2019m hopeful that no data has been lost.\n\nThe problem appeared with the new site design, in the old design the discussion was visible.\n\nIt most likely has something to do with the fact that the source branch of this pull request was mistakenly deleted by its owner a while ago. I\u2019m also not sure why the pull request is marked \u201cdeclined\u201d (though that may not be Bitbucket\u2019s fault), as far as I am concerned it is open and will be accepted soon.\n\n(As as side note, I would also consider it a bug that the commits disappeared from the pull request when they were removed from the source repository. In my opinion, the pull request should keep a reference to them, no matter whether they are still present in the source repository. But that already happened in the old design and is not part of this bug report.)",

In our local repo, and in BitBucket, everything went well. The branch was removed as I&#x27;d expect.\n\nViewing the BB &#x27;News Feed&#x27; I see each of the 54 commits reported as removed (see image &#x27;1 - Branch deleted.jpeg&#x27;). Again, this is what I&#x27;d expect.\n\nHowever, when I now go to browse the commits on that repo I see something I wouldn&#x27;t expect. The whole first page (i.e. the first 30 commits) is blank. The second page shows only 6 commits instead of 30 (i.e. for a total of 54 &#x27;empty&#x27; lines). From page 3 onwards, everything looks as normal.\\\\\nSo, it looks like the branch we deleted and its commits are indeed gone but the browse commit is still counting them as being there (see images 2 and 3).\n\nJust to reiterate: the repo itself is perfectly ok and functional i.e. there is no corruption or anything else wrong, it is only the display.",
