The ability to set priorities on a top-level basis which then goes down to individual tasks scheduled.\r\nh3. Suggested Resolution\r\n\r\nThe Epic can have added functionality such as:\r\n * *Epic Description*: In addition to the General Summary, an expandable description to allow further details to be added\r\n * *Epic Priority*: A priority setting for the epics within the project\r\n * *Epic Goal Due Date*: A Due date set before a certain task able to mark with a choice of color to signify the difference\r\n * *Calendar Inclusion*: Able to include and Exclude Epic into a calendar setting. The calendar overview has colored lines over the Days in which it represents the epic's timeline span throughout a particular week. Each Epic will have a choice of color to distinguish from the day of different weeks. This is to organize the workload for all the tasks.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n*Picture Included to further illustrate the suggestion.*",
