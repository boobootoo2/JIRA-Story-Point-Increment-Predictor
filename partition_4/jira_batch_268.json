I'm also aware we have put a warning in the documentation for [changing project key pattern|http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Configuring+Project+Keys] in JIRA.\r\n\r\nIt would be best if Greenhopper would report to the user that the problem is that their project key does not work with Greenhopper and that they should change it. A simple warning/error message in the logs should prevent our customer to get confuse to find out what might be gone wrong with their GH features. \r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nVicky",

However, if you, instead of clicking the button, press \"e\" on the keyboard to enter the edit screen, you are taken correctly in the edit screen inside greenhopper. Strangest thing is, after pressing \"e\" for the first time, any other action (clicking the button, or pressing \"e\" again), takes you correctly to the edit issue screen inside Greenhopper.\r\n\r\nCheers.\r\n\r\nThiago Prisco",

I have tried to search within the administration to be able to customize the menu, but I did not find such configuration. An agile tab is accessible after clicking on a project, which is fine, although it takes one more click now, but the thing is, if I enable the RapidBoard under the greenhopper labs in the configuration, I cannot seem to see \"Rapid Board\" since I think it only adds the option within the main menu, which I cannot see!\r\n\r\n*Recommended Workaround*\r\nTo implement the workaround please follow the instructions below:\r\n1. Under Administration > Plugins > Plugins > Confirm that the GreenHopper Plugin is listed under User-Installed Plugins (See screenshot_one)\r\n- If the plugin is indeed listed here then proceed to Step 2. \r\n2. Uninstall GreenHopper if located under User-installed Plugins\r\n3. Shut Down JIRA\r\n3. Remove the following folders from your {{<jira-home>/plugins}} folder (these folders may be hidden and an ls -al may be necessary):\r\n** {{.bundled-plugins}}\r\n** {{.osgi-plugins}}\r\n4.

Restart JIRA\r\n6. Under Administration > Plugins > Plugins > Show System Plugins > GreenHopper > Enable (See screenshot_two)\r\n\r\nThe Agile Tab will now be visible.
