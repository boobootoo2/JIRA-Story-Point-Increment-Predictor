But we like to configure this as a per object type settings, so quick creation for computers is possible, but not for locations. So every object types attribute setting should have a \"quick creation\" option. The global setting should work a default setting for every newly created object type, but after the object type is created, the \"quick creation\" setting for this object type should be possible to enable/disable. This way it would be possible to define for which object types quick creation is possible and for which not.Kind regardsBerthold",

We had tried to achieve this with the filter scope (IQL) setting in the Insight custom field settings, but were unsuccessful, we even tried using Behaviors to script the custom fields, but have found out that Behaviors are not compatible with Insight custom filed types.\u00a0Do you maybe have a solution we could use?",

Sourced from our user management (part of the ERP system) I import data (incl. phone numbers, managers, cost center assignments, locations, etc) from a SQL database. B. We import the Jira user directory in order to have the user group memberships which can be used for auto-assignments of IT services.Unfortunately, both data sources have a different amount of user. A. consists of 3500 users; B. has about 4200 users; Both sources combined means 4800 users in the CMDB. Obviously, both importers add users to system although only the amount of users from datasource A. is relevant for this use case. Having some irrelevant users in the CMDB is not a big deal at this moment. But I like to ask two questions:Importer B. runs before A. via scheduler. A. removes the missing objects from the CMDB.\u00a0This will happen every night every day! One hour later the second importer will remove these users until we aligned both user sources.

Each object contains a Manager attribute and a Member attribute (0..n)We have sensitive tickets that is restricted to the team selected only (and a few other more static roles)Today we have a script that is run on create and update (only when the team field is updated) that grabs all users in the member attribute and add these to a regular User Picker Multi-Select field which in turn is added to the Issue Security Scheme. This works quite well but has one big caveat! When a new user is added to the team, i.e. the team attribute in Insight is updated this is\u00a0 not automatically reflected in the ticket. We could either poke the Team field to re-run the script or run a maintenance job every night verifying all open tickets. Or have an update of the object trigger a change of all related tickets. None of these solutions scale very well and it would be smooother if the information in the Issue Security scheme can be in real-time.My suggestion is therefore to add Insight capability to the Issue Security Scheme to be able to use e.g. some form of dot-notation for Insight Custom fields like:*\"My Team-field\".Members*Wdyt?

      "description": "We're having a situation where we are using an external system for creating new objects. On this system, we set up the initial location of the object, and then objects are imported to Insight. We would like to be able to change the location of the object in Insight, but the issue is that the next import job will return the initial value of the location from the source.Another problem is that we are unable to update the location from the Insight to that system.I think that option \"Existing objects\", like you have \"Missing objects\", in import configuration would solve this issue.Idea is that we're able to define what we want to do with the existing objects in the schema. In this case, I would define if there is an object that matches a specific identifier and if it does - do nothing (don't update any attribute).",
