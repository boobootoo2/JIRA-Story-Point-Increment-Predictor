Environment\r\n* JIRA Cloud v1000.203.1\r\n\r\nh3.

Expected Results\r\nWorkflow Transition trigger's as the Merge is initiated\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nDue to the development tools panel bug [JSW-14663 | https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSW-14663] the transition is never triggered unless an additional pull request is triggered on the repo which allows the development panel to refresh and register the mege, therefor the timestamp of the merge is deviated from the timestamp of the transition\r\n- i.e. could sit for days in the incorrect status waiting for a follow up pull request that causes the development tools panel to refresh, \r\n- once the pull is initiated the merge is registered with timestamp on bitbucket, but Transition is set with timestamp the transition occurs in JIRA\r\n\r\nh3.Workaround\r\nManually transition workflow steps that rely on merge triggers",
