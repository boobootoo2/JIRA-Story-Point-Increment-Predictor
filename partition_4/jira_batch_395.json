      "description": "This is to be calculated using -an average time spent per completed story point (or any other estimation statistic)- average story points per day in a given release so far, plus optimistic and pessimistic variants by adding or subtracting -one standard deviation- 10% from it. (note this was changed because we already return data for story points completed by date but not time per story, and a standard deviation was too big of a difference in most cases and didn't seem to make sense)\n\n# The projections must be displayed somewhere outside of the chart as well.\n# Released versions do not need to show projections.\n# Show the intended release date on the chart (midnight end of the date specified).\n# Do not show calculations of velocity in the page.\n# Take NWD into account with the calculation of mean and SD.\n# Tooltips for potential targets show \"type\" (optimistic, pessimistic) and date.\n# At least 10% of total estimated work for the Version must be completed before projections are shown.\n\n(!) Development Notes (!)\nQ: What if users are using negative story points?\nA: If the predicted release date is in the past, we shouldn't display a prediction at all.\n\nQ: What if any of the rates approach infinity?\nA: We probably need to discuss with [~jrogers] [~mjopson] [~tkotecki] what is a good point to cut off. At the moment, if the predicted date is infinity, we don't display a prediction. If the most pessimistic date is infinity, we display a flat line and cut the chart off after the predicted date. But as long as it's not infinity, we display it. \n\nQ: What distinguishes a rate that approaches vertical from the scope change events that ARE vertical?\nA: (x) Not Answered (Don't really understand this question)\n\nQ: What happens when users change the estimation of their board, or remove it completely?\nA: The board will reflect the current estimation. \n\nQ: What if the estimation uses time tracking? Will we calculate deviation in minutes, hours, days? How will this be reflected on the axis?\nA: We will calculate units (of estimation) completed per day and use this to project. The axis won't change from what is displayed now: X is time and Y is estimation units.\n\nQ: What if the user is tracking work with Logged Work? Should this rate also be displayed?\nA: (x) Not Answered (do you mean time tracking?)\n\nQ: What do we display if a projected line goes significantly into the future before it touches the scope line? Potentially this could be years into the future, but this isn't realistic to display.\nA: The chart expands to display the most pessimistic date, unless it's infinity, in which case it expands to show the middle prediction. It could be years. \n\nQ: What happens to the lines if the version has been released?\nA: If the version is marked as released or if total scope = total completed scope then we shouldn't display a prediction. \n\nQ: What happens to the lines if the \"predicted\" release date is moved to the past?\nA: This should never happen.\n\nQ: What happens if the release date is moved into the future?\nA: Marking a version as released is separate from displaying a release date. Regardless of whether a release date is assigned, we will try to predict a date if total scope > completed scope and the version is not marked as released in JIRA.\n\nQ: What if the release date is removed?\nA: See above.\n\nQ: What happens to the projected lines if issues are removed from the version (resulting in scope change) or deleted entirely (resulting in chart change without history)?\nA: The scope line stays horizontal so if scope is removed then it moves down and in theory the release date should move forward. If the story was completed before it was removed then it's used in the calculation of average points completed per day.",

      "description": "Today, a Scrum Master planning a sprint doesn't have a way of committing to completing sub-tasks from stories that they don't intend to close.  They either have to work on the sub-tasks from stories not in the current sprint and have the hour burndown appear to be ahead of the guideline, or they have to pull the stories and all of their tasks into the sprint in which case the hour burndown appears to be behind the guideline.\n\nThis was functionality that the classic boards supported (perhaps inadvertently), but it allowed the team to commit to a set of stories to complete and the tasks they could complete on stories that they know at the outset won't be closed.\n\nI will leave the design of a solution to this to the GH team since you've purposefully left sub-types off the planning board.  I will propose a straw man to get this started though:\n* Add a special \"drop zone\" at the bottom of the sprint that a story could be dragged to and which would trigger a dialog that would allow the user to select which tasks to include in that sprint. \n* Ideally the story would then appear in that sprint but with a visual designation (dimmed?) to indicate that the entire story wasn't committed.  \n* A story would still only be committed to a single sprint but could conceivably have tasks included in 'n' other sprints.\n* Zero story points from the story should be allocated to the sprints where a story has tasks included but where the story itself has not been committed.\n* The hour total for the planning view should be updated to include the tasks from the story that were selected for inclusion.\n* A task can only be in a single sprint\n* In work view, users should only see the tasks planned for that sprint and the story swimlane should have a similar visual indicator to what's seen on the planning board (dimmed?) to show that it won't be completed in the current sprint\n* The hour burndown report for the sprints should include only the tasks that were selected for inclusion in the sprint\n* The sprint report should show an additional class of stories which are denoted as having had work done, but which weren't part of the commit.\n* Issue search by sprint should show the stories and tasks that were committed to a sprint.  A story that had 3/10 tasks allocated to sprint 1, should not itself appear in a search for issues included in sprint 1.  But the three tasks included in sprint 1 should appear in the search results.\n",

      "description": "The rapid board adds some super nice planning features, and we love the ability to edit issues directly in the 'Work' component of the rapid board. But the tasks and stories are rather disorganized.\n\nThe task board presented a beautiful layout and hierarchy of parent to child. It was easy to visualize the entire sprint, each story was logically partitioned from another. Sure, the page is sometimes long, but people have multiple size views to choose from if that's a concern.\n\nThe rapid board (5.9.4) doesn't give nearly as crisp and clear a view of the sprint. Tasks are hardly distinguishable from stories, there really isn't much to distinguish between parent (story) and child (task). And most importantly, there's no clean way of partitioning between stories (i.e. like the Task board creates horizontal swim lanes per story).\n\nThe Task Board creates a *full picture* of the entire sprint. The Rapid Board is feeling a bit more jumbled together, less crisp, it doesn't paint a picture of the sprint as well.\n\nA concrete example to express the point: when a task is \"In Progress\" it only shows the parent ID \"TT-1\" for example. But nobody knows stories by their ID. \n\nFor example: if I have two tasks with similar names assigned to two different stories, as in the example below:\n\nStory: As a user I want a new page X\n   -> Task: Cut PSD into Images [12hrs]\n\nStory: As a user I want a new page Y\n   -> Task: Cut PSD into Images [12hrs]\n\nWe're in trouble! It will be devilishly hard to distinguish between these tasks in the Rapid Board, but in the task board, due to its good organization, this is a non-issue. \n\nThis is a real example from our current sprint. And it occurs many times over with simple task names such as \"test some feature\". With the rapid board, as is, we'll have to be much more vigilant about including identifying information in the task descriptions.\n\nA minimalist solution would at least be to include the parent \"description\" in the \"In Progress\" list rather than just ID. But I think I'm going to miss my horizontal swim lanes per story as we have in the Task Board. \n\nYour task board is good, don't abandon it in full.\n",
