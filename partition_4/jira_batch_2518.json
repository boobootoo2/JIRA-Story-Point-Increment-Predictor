Essentially, we want developers to be able to set up their own \"working\" branches that they can rebase or delete to their hearts&#x27; content, but have the default behavior be to protect branches.\n\nSince the new configuration only gives us the option to specify branches that are \"protected\", we can&#x27;t really do what we want without explicitly listing each \"protected\" branch.\n\nEssentially, I&#x27;d like to be able to say something like:\\\\\n\"Prevent rewrites on: _, except for: dev__\", or \"Prevent deletes on: _, except for: tmp__\", etc.\n\nI also realize that we could probably work around this to some extent by coming up with a different naming convention for our branches, but even then I still feel like there will be cases where specifying \"non-protected\" branches would be useful.",

These may be map tiles, vector images that can be interpreted in different contexts, sets of data that we have designed D3.js widgets for, and so on. For instance, we may have data that is in a typed array interpretable by Javascript as WebGL vertices.\n\nWe&#x27;d very much like to be able to deploy a mechanism to view this data in an external (or internal, although I am not familiar with the security implications of that) viewer very easily. Having the ability to design \"apps\" that display buttons or iframes for specific\\\\\nfiletypes would be incredibly useful, and I think would make BitBucket much more attractive for development and deployment of particular classes of applications.\n\nAs it stands, we absolutely love the inline display and diffing of images, but being able to develop, deploy and select \"apps\" that we enable on a per-repository basis (or even per-account basis) to view specific filetypes would be amazing and really quite transformative for online collaboration around code, products, and data. Being able\\\\\nto deploy, say, \"view in Sketchfab\" or \"view in [custom] D3\" would be revolutionary, especially if individuals were able to develop apps the way that hooks can be developed.

Maybe including the Vote link near the comment box to make it more obvious to those inclined to scroll down to add their support would do the trick. Alternatively, you could catch people who are posting \"+1\" as their entire comment who haven&#x27;t voted and ask them if they would like to vote on the issue, because \"Posting +1 is not as an effective way of alerting Atlassian of their clients requests as voting is\"",

Fantastic for code reviews etc.\n\nSomething seems to have changed a couple of weeks back and now I&#x27;m only getting line by line diffs.\n\nIn other words, if only one character changes in a line, I&#x27;m getting it showing as the old line was removed, and the new line was added - without any highlight of that single character change.\n\nIt doesn&#x27;t seem to be browser-specific.\n\nWas this a deliberate change?  I can&#x27;t find an option to turn it back on - sorry if I&#x27;m missing something! :)\n\nCheers",

(smile)\n\nOne silly problem I had was figuring out the commit button.\\\\\nSince there are two commit buttons; one at the top and one at the middle, I couldn&#x27;t push any changes until I found the second commit button in the middle and realised the one at the menu bar did not actually commit.\n\nPerhaps it would be better to rename the commit button \"Commit your changes\" and maybe make it red (or a colour that&#x27;s distinct and easy to see)?",

It would be nice if the Bamboo hook plan key field could support wildcarding the plan key so I can enable one hook for multiple Bamboo plans.\n\nAlternatively, since we need to provide our Bamboo URL (and it is part of our OnDemand instance), maybe providing the OnDemand URL might be sufficient to just enable the trigger for all build plans on that instance rather than having to specify a plan key at all?  (Though maybe that isn&#x27;t possible to implement, but it would definitely be nice!)",
