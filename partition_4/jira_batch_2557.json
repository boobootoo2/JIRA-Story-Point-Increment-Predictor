I don&#x27;t have much experience of using open source versioning and collaboration tools. From this newbie point of view, there are 2 navigational improvements that I would like to suggest:\n\n# Have an easier way to browse the directories of a repository. Currently if I want to see all the files in any directory, there seems to be no direct link on the repo home. One can go to commits, click on the name of any file, then see the directory structure broken down by path tokens and be able to click each token to see the files in that directory.\n# There is also no \"list\" or \"contents\" of wiki pages. If the assumption is that wiki owners should create the links to inner pages from the home wiki, then it&#x27;s okay but again, not obvious. One would expect to see a list of the wiki pages in the repository.\n\nAgain, thanks for the efforts.\n\nSiddhartha",

Imagine you work on a class diagram with some other people. Actually, you can only use formats not easy to alter, so, raster images (png, by example) or vector images (svg). You could also use dia files, but in any case, you will need a software to modify them.\\\\\nUsing DOT files will allow everyone to edit diagrams with a simple text editor, exactly like a wiki page.\n\nI know, we can actually send dot source file into wiki aside with an image, and the man who want to read can just view the the image.\\\\\nIf he want to edit, he can alter source and generate new the image, and then send both of them. But this is an heavy and not user friendly workaround.\n\nFor implementation of such a feature, I guess that using a script like the one actually used on the wiki could be ok. Just create a new checkbox \"DOT file\" when user click on \"New\" and replace the action taken by the \"preview\" button by a request to graphviz to generate an image from a command-line. (I think svg is the more interesting, because it is as lightweight as an html file and use client computer to render. Thanks of that, it can be sized automatically to the best size of client computer)",

Since we have so many repositories, it would be nice to be able to group certain repositories together, similar to folders, etc.\n\nEven if the groups are just for display and not reflected in the Url, the feature would be nice.\n\nA similar idea would be to Tag repositories, and thus we could use the Tags to filter the repositories page easily, displaying the tags on the repo page.",
