See the attached screenshot, where the \"352\" issue number overlaps the \"EMBCWD\" about half-way through the cee.\r\n\r\nHow about just displaying the issue key as normal text (e.g. \"EMBCWD-352\"), without positioning the project key and issue number separately?\r\n\r\nIf you really need to handle long project keys in this UI, a better looking alternative is some JavaScript which measures the length of the text and replaces a character at a time from the project key with ellipsis until the text fits. Like this:\r\n\r\n# EMBCWD-352 (calculate size - too long)\r\n# EMBCW...-352 (calculate size - too long)\r\n# EMBC...-352 (calcuate size - too long)\r\n# EMB...-352 (calculate size - all good!)\r\n\r\nHere's some sample JS with a regular expression which will do the replacement:\r\n\r\n{code}\r\nvar issueKey = $(el).text();\r\nwhile ($(el).width() > maxWidth) {\r\n    issueKey = issueKey.replace(/^(.*)[^\\u2026]\\u2026?(-\\d+)$/, \"$1\\u2026$2\");\r\n    $(el).text(issueKey);\r\n    if (issueKey.match(/^\\u2026/) {\r\n        break;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nNote: it isn't fully tested, and doesn't really produce great results if the issue number is too long to fit. Try it out and adapt as you see fit.\r\n\r\nIf you have potentially hundreds of these things on the screen, you could cache the result for a given project key and number of digits in the issue number, and reuse the same shortened project key. The fonts we use in our UI all have the same width for the digit glyphs.\r\n\r\nIn short -- no excuse for not making this better! :)\r\n",

On the side would be each project and then the list of issues you are assigned in each. Dragging issues could rank in a separate ranking field, something like \"personal priority\" could be used for private self organization. This would make it easy to decide on what someone should spend time and not effect how things are prioritized inside of each project.\r\n\r\nAlso a simple auto prioritize can be handled by managing a slider to show percent of time currently devoted to each project. This would just weigh each project issue's importance based on the percent time that project is allotted. Then the developer could go in and reorder things to their liking.\r\n\r\n",

      "description": "Jira natively supports multiple versions on a ticket however the Greenhopper Planning Board does not. This is a real issue for us as greenhopper reuses the jira version field for sprints.\r\n\r\nEssentially we maintain several versions of our products, and in one sprint we may be doing bugfixes/features on a couple different product versions. Thus nesting sprints under versions is not a good solution for us.\r\n\r\neg in one sprint we want to do feature development on version 2.0 and a couple bug fixes on version 1.1 of our product. The version 'Sprint x' cannot be a child of either of the two product versions. We are then forced to have sprint versions on the same level as product versions. This means in order to actually have the correct product version assigned to an issue, the developer has to manually edit the issue and add the version to it. \r\nHowever, moving an issue between versions/sprints in the Greenhopper Planning board will result in resetting all previous versions manually set on an issue, so despite manually editing the ticket versions, the version can quickly and easily be lost.\r\n\r\nA couple solutions we can think of are to:\r\n1. We feel that the core of the issue comes from Greenhopper re-purposing Jira's version field. So the solution here is to have Greenhopper not to use the jira version field for sprints. This seems the most sensible option (for us), but will obviously require a fair change in greenhopper.\r\n2. Allow CTRL + dragging in the planning board to ADD a version to an issue instead of replace the version. This would allow us to move all the issues we want to fix in version 2.0 to that version. Then when doing a sprint we would CTRL + drag the issue to the specific sprint. This would allow the issue to retain its original product version when adding it to a sprint on the same level as the product version. However, as this is an extra step, it could easily be forgotten, leaving us with the occasional bug with incorrect versioning. \r\n3. Set up another custom field in Jira to store the actual product version in. Then the Jira Version field can be used entirely for greenhopper sprints (kindof backwards I know). Developers will have to manually edit issues and set the new 'Really fixed in Version' field. Doing it this way we also loose other Jira functionality such as the roadmap and release notes features...\r\n4 other solutions welcome....?\r\n\r\nWe have a growing installation of Atlassian products company wide and this is the single biggest issue we have with being able to find a usable workflow.\r\n",

Hence, the logical assumption is that the dates shown here are release date of the version, not the end date for the burn down chart.\r\n* There is nowhere else, other than on the burn down chart, that lists the end date, so the user is left guessing as to why the date shown on the days remaining gadget is different to the release date.  Maybe adding the end date to the planning board version view, so the user can see that there are in fact two different dates configured, would help.",

Well, if you look at the colors of regular post-it notes, then you'll see that they only have 1 background color.\r\n\r\nLet us map this into Greenhopper 5. In greenhopper 5, all the cards have 2 colors. 1 small colorish vertical bar (that you can adjust) and then the other 90% of the card has a white/gray - look. This doesn't feel right and I'm loosing oversight of my cards. You really have to put your minds to it to make really see the difference between an epic / story or a sub-task (eg: select view as summaries in planning board).\r\n\r\nSo I'm asking to make it possible to change the background color of the entire card to whatever you want it to be.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nSven",

We want less information on printed cards than when creating a new card.\r\n\r\nBy using summary view, planning board and the pages, this was quite easy to get right in the previous version.
