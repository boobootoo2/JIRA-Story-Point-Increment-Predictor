The action I'm specifically interested in is pull.\r\n\r\nIf your application contains multiple repositories and/or you have branches in seperate directories, then currently you have to do them one by one. It would make things easier to be able to select multiple and then pull them all and have sourcetree do them one by one programmatically.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nTom",

      "description": "Sometimes it's hard to find commits in the graph view because the only way to find those commits is to keep scrolling until you see it. The Ancestor Order is very helpful in this regard, but it has some limitations. For example, finding the commit where a branch was branched from is not possible, even with Ancestor Order view. At the same time, there may be use cases where the user wants to\u00a0look at the Date Order view, but wants to navigate the commits only in the current branch. This is a common scenario when looking at multiple branches and trying to figure out when commits were made across multiple branches in relation to each other.\r\n\r\nI propose adding another keyboard shortcut, in addition to the current UP and DOWN buttons that would navigate commits *only in the current branch*, until it makes it to the point where the branch was first created, and then follow the parent branch commits.\r\n{code:java}\r\na---b---c  // branch child\r\n         \\\r\n--x---y---d---o---o---o---o // branch parent\r\n\r\n\r\n{code}\r\nIn this above repository, the graph would be able to walk commits\u00a0[ a, b, c, d, ... ], whereas currently it is only able to walk commits in the global order [ a, x, b, y, c, d, ... ].",
