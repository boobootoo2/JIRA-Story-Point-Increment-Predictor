The source system does not fill out a certain field when it is not needed - think of it as a flag.\r\n\r\nWhen this imports into Insight, Insight doesn't show the attribute's existence when it is empty. This mimics Jira's native functionality of hiding empty issue fields.\r\n\r\nThis has caused confusion with multiple clients. In Jira, hiding empty fields is seen as a feature to prevent bloat and unnecessary scrolling; however, when it comes to Insight, the clients overwhelmingly see this as an omission of critical data.\r\n\r\nI would like a way to:\r\n* on the attribute, set a flag to force it to always show the attribute.\r\n\r\nI'm sure this flag could be extended all the way up the chain (e.g. enable for entire schema), but I leave that up to you.\r\n\r\nFor numerical attributes, setting a default usually suffices; however, for many text fields, setting a default value would be redundant at best and confusing at worst.",

Problem\r\n\r\nUsers have complained a lot about the new issue view:\r\n * Comment header has the same size and style as normal comment body text\r\n * If comments use a lot of styles such as headers, bold/italic text, etc., it quickly becomes difficult for a user to visually distinguish where a single comment begins and ends\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n * First option: Change comment header size and/or style so that, on average, it is immediately visible where a new comment begins\r\n * Second option: Add possibilities for admins to change comment presentation to their liking, using an editor similar to the one used for editing notification templates\r\n\r\nh3. Why This Is Important\r\n * Users are having a hard time visually parsing the comments section of tickets they work with, and it takes them longer than necessary to find information they are looking for\r\n * With the suggested change, users should be able to visually parse the comments section faster to get to the info they are looking for\r\n\r\nh3.

Context\r\n\r\nWe use Insight to manage (among other things) our laptops, our users, and the relationship between the two. To visualize this, we have an object-referencing attribute on our \"Laptops\" object type called \"Owner\" linking to the \"User\" object type.\r\nh1. Problem\r\n * When viewing the \"User\" objects, all we see to indicate that there's a link to another object is the \"incoming reference\" count, which is minimally helpful.\r\n * Putting an object-referencing attribute on the \"User\" object type linking back to a \"Laptop\" gives me what I would expect to see (an attribute showing the laptops owned by the user), but this is an entirely different field, so there's the possibility that each side could be out of sync with the other.\r\n\r\nh1. Desired Behavior\r\n\r\nWhen I make an object-referencing attribute in one Object Type, I have the option to add \"the other side\" of the reference as an attribute on the referenced Object Type.\r\n\r\nThus a \"Owner\" attribute on the \"Laptop\" Object Type could be tied to a corresponding attribute (which ideally I could rename as I wished, in this case to something like \"Assigned Laptop(s)\") which would\\could only show the laptops assigned to the user.",

      "description": "h3. Issue Summary\r\n\r\nWhen using the Insight Discovery Import - multiple files may be exported from Discovery to Insight Cloud using the Discovery Import. \r\nHere are three scenarios: \r\n1. One Discovery Instance may have a few Scan Settings running one after the other.\r\n2. A few Discovery instances may run at the same time, using the same Cloud Import Token in their Export to Cloud.\r\n3. Several Discovery Instances are moving the scan results, to be picked up and exported by the Collector.\r\n\r\nAll three scenarios will result in:\r\nOne Scan Result file is being Exported/importing in Cloud, while another Scan Results file is attempting to export to the same Import Configuration - as it is using the exact same Token.\r\n\r\nAs the import engine is busy - it returns a 400 error, and the job is not being queued up. The failed to export files will remain in the Scans directory.\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Few options to test:\r\n- Configure 2 scan settings, each with one IP address and Export to Cloud. Make sure the 1st scan setting will return a lot of information (using many Patterns) and set the second Scan Setting to gather only basic information (Hostinfo patterns) from the Localhost running discovery. - Set export to a Cloud instance.\r\n- Configure 2 Discovery Instances, use the same Cloud Import Token in both, and execute a scan in each, time the scans so that one scan is finishing right after the other (e.g. 1st instance to have a long range of IPs, and the other to have only one... trigger the second instance to scan when the first is almost done...)\r\n- gather a few Scan Results files, into the Scans folder, configure Export to Cloud with a Valid token, execute Discovery.exe -z to trigger the file transport\r\n- gather a few Scan Results files, into the Import folder, configure a Collector to\u00a0 Export to Cloud with a Valid token, polling interval 1m, and install it as a service / trigger it manually.\r\n # Check the logs (Discovery / Collector) and revise the Schema in Insight Cloud\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nAll file are exported to Cloud, Scan/Import folder is empty, all the scanned info is imported and visible in Cloud.\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nOne file is Exported to cloud, all other files are kept in Scans, and log shows 400 response for each\r\n{noformat}\r\n08-Dec-2021 13:38:03 : Start package process for:

For example, JSM issues contain information about how they were created in the \"request.channel.type\" field; indeed, you can filter on this dimension in a JQL search. However this field is not available as a column in Issue Navigator, so you cannot easily export it into a file and use it for reporting.\r\n\r\n - Reporting in general, and historical and artifact reporting in particular, are weaknesses of JIRA.
