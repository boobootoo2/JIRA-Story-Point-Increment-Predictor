Well in an enterprise environment as a web developer you need to support the browser that is the number one browser at the company(IE7 in almost every case...).  So every time I want to create a bitbucket project I have to jump through hoops to either install another browser or create the project somewhere else.  I know you can provide better support for IE7 and I wish you would put the extra effort in to provide a few polyfills for the features you feel are necessary.\n\nThanks!\n\nJason",
