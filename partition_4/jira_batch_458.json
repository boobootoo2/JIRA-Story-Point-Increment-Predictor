I'd like to disable this.\u2028When we manually create an issue and set the reporter to one of our customers, the organization remains unset. We can manually set an organization, but I want to make this process automatic depending on the originator.

Problem Definition\r\nAbility to create multiple unique forms under an individual issue/request type\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\nCustomer can continue to create individual request types, but if they have a requirement to have 20-30 unique forms then customer is going to have 20-30 unique issue/request types which of course would become unmanageable over time.\r\n\r\nh3. Why this is important\r\nIt would be incredibly useful to have the ability to create multiple unique forms under an individual issue/request type so that you can capture the right information at the first point of contact from the customer. The best example for this would be Service Requests as they can come in all different flavors.\r\n\r\nPossible Service Requests that would need a unique form are as follows:\r\n\r\n* New employee request form\r\n* Employee leaving form\r\n* Database access request form\r\n* Hardware ordering form\r\n* Software ordering form\r\n* Basically anything that either needs to be approved or tracked.\r\n \r\nh3.

[See the corresponding bug report|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSDCLOUD-4632].\n  {panel}\n\nh3. Summary\r\nWhen a new Service Desk is created, JIRA Service Desk doesn't check for existing sub-task types with the same name as the default issue types created by JSD.\r\nThis will cause JSD to map valid request types to sub-tasks, which is not supported and hence throw an error when creating new requests.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Create sub-tasks with the same name as the JIRA Service Desk issue types (e.g. Incident / Problem / Service Request)\r\n# Create a Service Desk project that uses those issue types.\r\n# Navigate to the the *new project > Project Settings > Request Types*.\r\n# Double-check that the request is mapped to a sub-task, as the screenshot below:\r\n!incident.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nJIRA Service Desk should not create an inconsistent configuration - It should either:\r\n* Create a new issue type so that the mapping works properly.\r\n* Prompt users that the issue type is already mapped to a sub-task and hence one of the issue types will have to be renamed.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nWhen you try to create a request using this type, the following error is displayed in the screen:\r\n!error.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nThe stack trace below can be found in the {{atlassian-jira.log}}:\r\n{noformat}\r\n09-Jan-2017 11:46:44.817 WARNING [http-nio-8726-exec-15] com.sun.jersey.spi.container.servlet.WebComponent.filterFormParameters A servlet request, to the URI http://localhost:8726/jira726/rest/servicedesk/1/customer/pages/portal/4/create/22, contains form parameters in the request body but the request body has been consumed by the servlet or a servlet filter accessing the request parameters.

Problem Definition\r\nCurrently, using the Organisations in Jira Service Desk for customers, customers can share created issues within their organisation. \r\n\r\nThe customer would want a solution for sharing issues of specific issue type with a group of customers.\r\n\r\nFor example, the organization \"Employees\" can open issue in \"Computer\" Request Type to ask about keyboard and mouse. But organization \"Technical\" can open issue in \"Network\" Request Type to ask about network problem. Customers from the organisation \"Employees\" can only see issues from the \"Computer\" Request type. \r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\nAdd possibility for Request Type permission in Jira Service desk\r\n \r\nh3. Workaround \r\nCreate separate projects for issues with specific Request Type and add organisation for this specific project only",

Problem Definition\r\nJIRA Service Desk notifications for customer do not obey ordinary notification scheme, which is a good way to split notification sending and also is good to edit the e-mail content. However, you are only able to set up notification sending (to costumers) with the following options: Reporter or Customers Involved (request participants). This can limit some cases, like e.g: You have other 'User fields' for people like Stakeholders, who should receive some specific notifications. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\nBe able to add other entities for the 'To:' field in customer notifications, like Customer Field Value (as it has on notification schemes) or be able to add customers or customers within a custom field into notification scheme (which currently don't work as JIRA Notification schemes work only for internal users not customers)\r\n",

Summary\r\nWhen editing an external comment (for instance to correct the spelling of a comment) there are 2 options available:\r\n# Share with Customer\r\n# Add to issue only\r\nThe second option creates the impression that the edit of the comment will only result in the edit taking place, and no notification event to be triggered, whereas the share with customer option created the impression this will trigger a notification event towards the customer.\r\nInstead, when the add to issue only option is being used, the external comment will be set to internal upon saving\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Create a Service Desk\r\n# Raise a request on behalf of a customer\r\n# Add a comment to the request\r\n# Edit the comment from step 3 and choose \"add to issue only\"\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nThe comment gets edited, and no notification gets triggered. The comment remains visible for the customer.\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nThe comment gets edited, and no notification gets triggered. The comment changes from external to internal and as such will not be visible for the customer anymore",

Context\r\n\r\nSince [04 Jul 2016|https://confluence.atlassian.com/cloud/what-s-new-686863216.html#What'sNew-servicedesk], SD Agents can now always create customer accounts in all JIRA Service Desk Cloud instances:\r\n{quote}Agents can add new customers to a service desk regardless of how request permissions are configured. Agents can add new customers by inviting them from the Customers page, raising a request on their behalf, or adding them as request participants on an email request. Previously, agents could only add new customers to the service desk when the request security was set to 'anyone can create a customer account'.\r\n{quote}\r\nThis has been a great\u00a0feature.\r\nh3. Problem definition\r\n\r\nAccounts\u00a0created by Agents from the Customers page use the email as the value of:\r\n # customer's email\r\n # customer's username\r\n # customer's full name\r\n\r\nTherefore:\r\n * Agents frequently don't know their customer names because\u00a0they couldn't store the user's full name on issue creation.\r\n * Usernames are too long strings, so customers\u00a0cannot login with shorter credentials.\r\n * Customers cannot share tickets with\u00a0other users within their organization by typing their names.\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested solution\r\n\r\nBuild a way in which Agents can also set appropriate usernames & full names on account creation from the Customers page.\r\nh3. Related previous suggestion\r\n\r\nThere's already a previous similar suggestion,\u00a0created before 04 Jul 2016, on which the request of change had a much more limited context, as it only affected when the request security was set to 'anyone can create a customer account':\u00a0JSD-1197\r\n\r\nHowever, the scope change in the context makes JSD-1197\u00a0an obsolete request on Cloud instances, as now it forcibly applies to every Service Desk project in all Cloud instances.",
