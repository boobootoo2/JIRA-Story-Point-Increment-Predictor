Problem Definition:\r\nSince [JIRA Service Desk 3.2|https://confluence.atlassian.com/servicedesk/jira-service-desk-3-2-x-release-notes-830281732.html], we could configure a transition to be available from the Portal for Customers to perform it. But, there is still possibility that the transition could be misconfigured or having an issue that allows the Customer to not be able to trigger the transition. At such time, an error like below will be shown.\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution:\r\nIf the error could provide more information about how it fails, it will be great for the Admin. While Customers indeed does not need to know or shown the descriptive/technical error while using the portal, we could hide the error and make it expandable by click. To make it better, automate a creation of a request when such issue happens so the Admin could see it.\r\n\r\nh3.
