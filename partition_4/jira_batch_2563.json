This can be solved by aliasing that key to a user in the project repository, but that means I have to do it for every project and every user working on that project.  Is it possible not to even have the keys register?  The username is set with the remote git request so why isn&#x27;t just pulling from there.

This setting collides with the default \"in-page\" search available in various browsers.\n\nSince the functionality is completely different: \"/\" in browsers searches on the current page, in bitbucket it searches the whole service, I&#x27;d like to see the default left alone. It looks like a regression to me. Can we get the search hotkey back?",
