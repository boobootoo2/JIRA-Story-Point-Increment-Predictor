A particular file is included depending on repository's path.\r\n\r\nThe reason for that is that I'm sharing single machine for both my personal and work repositories and for each group I need to use a different user (name and e-mail). Before, I had global configuration for my personal repositories in {{.gitconfig}} and I had to set the proper user in every work repository's {{.git/config}} manually. It's not surprising I forgot many times and noticed it after it was pushed already and I cannot change it anymore.\r\n\r\nSo I have created a {{simple}} system\r\n\r\nMy {{~/.gitconfig}}:\r\n{code:java}\r\n[user]\r\n  name = Personal User\r\n  user = personal@user.com\r\n[includeIf \"gitdir/i:c:/work-repos/\"]\r\n  path = ~/.gitconfig-work\r\n{code}\r\nIncluded {{~/.gitconfig-work}}:\r\n{code:java}\r\n[user]\r\n  name = Work User\r\n  email = work@user.com\r\n{code}\r\nThis way, repositories under the directory {{c:\\work-repos}} (at any level) are using the _Work User_ from the config {{~/.gitconfig~}} while all other repositories located anywhere else are using the _Personal User_ from the main {{./gitconfig}}. I don't have to care about that anymore.\r\n\r\n*Now, ServiceTree:* it seems to be working in ServiceTree (commits have the right owner), there's just one small glitch - when I open the repository _Settings_, tab _Advanced_,\u00a0_User information_ is always showing the _Personal User_ on a repository under {{c:\\work-repos}} when _Use global user settings_ is checked out even though it should be showing the _Work User_.\r\n\r\nWhen I open _Terminal_ from SourceTree and execute {{git config --get user.email}}, it properly prints the {{Work User}}.",

Commit All now does nothing at all in staging mode.\r\n\r\nIt may be that you're thinking Commit All should only do something in non-staging mode. However it's\u00a0*extremely* useful to be able to commit everything in one go sometimes even if you do also want staging support. And keyboard shortcuts are key to productivity.\r\n\r\nI have actually fixed this behaviour myself before, a couple of years ago ;)\r\n\r\nIf you don't agree, then Commit All should be disabled in staging mode, since Commit Staged (Shift+Alt+C, which I also use when partially committing) works instead. Perhaps Commit All should become Stage All (there is no separate feature for this) instead. Otherwise there is no fast way any more to stage & commit everything from the keyboard, and that makes me sad. :(\r\n\r\n\u00a0",
