Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nThe URL is not encoded again, (since it is already encoded) thus still accessible.\r\n\r\nh4. Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nThe *href* of the URL is double encoded.

There is an open ticket regarding this here : https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-26208 \r\n\r\nAs the usage of this status property to prevent issue edit and sub-task creation on resolved ticket is very commonly used, it is important that the new issue view also follow the behavior of the old issue view for consistency. \r\n\r\n\r\nh3.Investigation Done\r\n\r\nBefore status properties is used.\r\n\r\n !screenshot-3.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\nAfter status properties 'jira.issue.editable' is used.

Description:\r\nWhen trying to search for an issuekey using Jira REST API and providing the issue key in lower case, it returns another issue.\r\n\r\nIt may return another issue if this issue was moved from another project and the original key was taken by another existing issue.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to reproduce:\r\n# Create a project A and an issue A-1, for example\r\n# Move the issue A-1 to another project B (key is change to B-1, but A-1 remains linked to that issue)\r\n# Delete the project A\r\n# Create a new project C with a different project key\r\n# Create an issue C-1 (it must have the same issue number as the other one)\r\n# Change the project key of project C to the same project key of the project A (now, that ticket becomes A-1, but that is also linked to B-1)\r\n# Use the REST API to search for the issue A-1 in upper case (A-1), a GET to {{/rest/api/latest/issue/A-1}}\r\n# Use the REST API to search for the issue A-1 in lower case (a-1), a GET to {{/rest/api/latest/issue/a-1}}\r\n\r\nh3. Expected results: \r\n * It is expected to return in both cases the same issue A-1\r\n \r\nh3. Actual results:\r\n * When searching for the issue in lower case it returns the first issue (current B-1) that was moved to the issue B because the REST API search by ID and Jira maintains the id in the database pointing to the first issue A moved to the project B.\r\n\r\nh4. Notes\r\nThis happens because the issue B-1 still has 'A-1' as key in the 'moved_issue_key' table in the database, while that is the current key of A-1, so both tickets resolve to A-1 and the behavior changes depending on the case (upper or lower).\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n* Search using just upper case.",

More details here -\u00a0[https://community.atlassian.com/t5/Jira-articles/Announcement-New-Issue-Create-modal-will-be-available-to-all/ba-p/1874003]\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThank you for your patience.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nArjoon Som\r\nSr. PM, Jira Cloud\r\n{panel}\r\nh3. Summary\r\n\r\nWhen creating an Issue in Jira, text Wiki renderable fields such as the *Description* field are displayed in text mode which does not format the markdown syntax. This happens because the *Create Issue* screen still uses the old view.\r\n\r\nThis means that on the Create screen, you're seeing a bunch of symbols (+,*,-,{) and need to rely on knowing the syntax and seeing the output after creating the issue or by changing the field to \"view\" mode.\r\n\r\n*bold*\r\n+italic+\r\n{color:#ff0000}colour{color}\r\n-strikethrough-\r\nh3. Suggestion\r\n\r\nApply the new Jira issue view in the *Create Issue* screen so the formatting of the Wiki markdown is clearly visible.",

Expected Results\r\nThey are rendered just as previously before the new notification platform, for example this is the subject line of a working notification:\r\nUmlaute \u00e4\u00f6\u00fc \u00c4\u00d6\u00dc Mail\r\n\r\n\r\nh3.

Notes\r\nI appreciate this also relates to the particular mail client encoding as it does not occur for example using Gmail, or it may even be language related.
