This basically means that the blocked issue virtually gets \"ranked\" below the blocking issue (unless the rank order already matches the dependency order, i.e., the blocked issue has a lower rank than the blocking one). In certain situations (like two teams working on de facto independent backlogs) this behaviour leads to unintuitive / unexpected outcomes.\r\n\r\n*Solution*\r\nIn order to allow scheduling to better adjust to the particular setup, an option to change this behaviour should be introduced.

Summary\r\nIn case there are certain fields required for specific issue types and this requirement condition is modelled with a [workflow validator|https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiracloud/advanced-workflow-configuration-776636620.html#Advancedworkflowconfiguration-validators], Portfolio won't bring up the _Create issue_ dialog when trying to commit an issue of this type to JIRA - or will not show that field in the screen - and hence the issue creation will fail.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Behavior\r\nFollow the configuration from JIRA's \"Create Issue\" screen, showing all of the fields that have been configured there also in the screen brought up by Portfolio.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Behavior\r\nIf there are required fields setup through the workflow, or if a workflow function require any fields that are not marked as \"Required\" in JIRA's field configuration, the issue creation through JPO will fail.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\nSet the field as \"Required\" via [field configurations and screens|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/AdminJIRACloud/Project+screens%2C+schemes+and+fields] and [specify the field behaviour|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/AdminJIRACloud/Specifying+field+behavior#Specifyingfieldbehavior-changingfieldsModifyingfieldbehavior] this way.",

Summary\r\n\r\nScheduling algorithm considers Rank first than any other values such as dependencies. When there are multiple backlogs and teams working on the same Plan, it may get an unexpected result.\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nHave Backlog A and Backlog B runs in parallel on two different backlogs with assigned to two different teams.\r\n\r\nBacklog A has the following backlog (rank in brackets):\r\n BACKLOGA-1 (1)\r\n BACKLOGA-2 (2)\r\n BACKLOGA-3 (3)\r\n BACKLOGA-4 (4)\r\n BACKLOGA-5 (5)\r\n\r\nBacklog B has the following backlog (rank in brackets)\r\n BACKLOGB-1 (6)\r\n BACKLOGB-2 (7)\r\n BACKLOGB-3 (8)\r\n BACKLOGB-4 (9)\r\n BACKLOGB-5 (10)\r\n\r\nIf BACKLOGA-1 has a dependency on BACKLOGB-2 it does not schedule it straight after BACKLOGB-2 completes (which it should, because it is first in the backlog and has the highest rank).\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nBACKLOGA-1 scheduled right after BACKLOGB-2\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nBACKLOGA-1 scheduled after BACKLOGA-5\r\nh3. Notes\r\n\r\nThis is because, in scheduling, Rank is considered first then other values such as dependency. It is an expected behaviour, JPO-1531 open to adding this in the documentation.",

When importing a board of the parent issues it becomes a large manual task to sync the sub-tasks types to the related skill column (eg 20+ issues with 4 sub-tasks each = 80 changes).\r\n\r\nHaving a configuration point in the portfolio store a default mapping to 'type to skill' will quickly solve this and allow the plan to accurately track the projected finish dates. This mapping should also apply upon creation of new sub tasks in the portfolio view, etc.\r\n\r\nAt the moment the portfolio can't be used by a large number of our teams due to this usability issue.",

Workaround\r\n\r\nBased on our investigations so far, this bug occurs when calculating the schedule (work assignments) for Agile sprints if the capacity of at least one of the people working on this sprint is exceeded.\r\nIn order to get the plan working again please adapt the scope of all imported Agile sprints manually by either removing issues from the sprint or adapting their estimates.\r\n\r\nWe are working on this and hope to provide fix soon.",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JPOCLOUD-1497].\n  {panel}\n\n*Problem*\r\nSprint end dates are mapped to the end of a day within Portfolio. That is, if there is a sprint ending on 15/Jun/16, 11:23:17, Portfolio will map its end date to 15/Jun/16, 23:59:59. Similar, sprint start dates are mapped to the beginning of the respective day. This is due to Portfolio scheduling on a day-granularity and hence timestamps have to be mapped to either the start or end of a day. As a consequence, the duration of that sprint might appear longer by one day than it actually is. For instance, a sprint running from 15/Jun/16, 11:23:17 - 16/Jun/16, 11:23:16 would have a duration of 2 days in Portfolio even though its actual duration is just one day. This leads to an inflated capacity for that sprint.\r\n\r\n*Expected behaviour*\r\nThe sprint duration should be accurate, however, due to Portfolio's day granularity, the sprint start/end timestamps cannot be matched, a better heuristic might help (mapping timestamps from the afternoon to end-of-day, mapping timestamps from before noon to beginning-of-day).",

Steps to reproduce\r\n# Create JIRA Software Scrum Software Development project, add sprint\r\n# Create issue and add to sprint, start sprint and then change issue status to \"Done\"\r\n# Create plan using scrum board as source (use default selections on releases, teams, and scope pages)\r\n#* On the \"Confirm what's in scope\" page, note no issues appear and \"0 selected\"\r\n# Expand \"Issues without parent Epic\" and note that the \"Done\" issue was included in plan.\r\n\r\nh5. Expected Behavior\r\nCreating a plan with \"0 selected\" on the Scope page should create a plan that contains no issues. \r\n* These \"Done\" issues should either not be included in the new plan or they should show up on the Scope page so that they can be selected or un-selected\r\n\r\nh5. Workaround\r\nAfter you create the plan you can exclude the \"Done\" issues. You can do this by checking the issue box and clicking \"Exclude from plan\".\r\n",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JPOCLOUD-1482].\r\n  {panel}\r\n\r\n*Problem:*\r\nThe epic issue type is hard-wired to the 2nd hierarchy level in Portfolio (one above the lowest standard issue types level and two above the sub-tasks level). This can be limiting in case more hierarchy levels are required under the epic issue type.\r\n\r\n*Workaround:*\r\nFor the time being, another issue type needs to be used to fulfil the purpose of the epic issue type. This type can then be mapped to any hierarchy level and thus will allow for more hierarchy levels below.\r\n\r\n*Solution:*\r\nAllow mapping the epic issue type to other hierarchy levels and also allow for the levels below to be changed too.
