Therefore we think it is only fair to not keep this issue as open and close it as \"won't fix\". We will take this feedback into account as we work on ongoing design and usability improvements to the view issue page.\n\n\nCheers,\nJason\nJIRA Product Management\njwong (at) atlassian (dot) com\n{panel}\n\n*Original description*\nWhen using JIRA, I often change the attachment sort order. I would really like to have a 'default sort order' so I don't have to do it as often.\n\nh3. Workaround:\n\nThis is an unsupported, and hacky workaround but hopefully it helps some people. You can use the following code in your announcement banner:\n{code}<script>var direction = \"asc\"; //Other option is \"desc\"\nvar sortBy = \"dateTime\"; //Other option is \"fileName\"\n\nvar origUrl = window.location.href;\nvar patt = /browse\\/[A-Z][A-Z]+-[0-9]+/;\nvar key = new RegExp(\"[A-Z][A-Z]+-[0-9]+\");\n\nvar sort = \"?attachmentSortBy=\"+sortBy+\"&attachmentOrder=\"+direction+\"#attachmentmodule\";\nif(patt.test(origUrl) && !JSON.parse(sessionStorage.getItem('hasReloaded' + key))){\n\tlocation.assign(origUrl + sort);\n\tsessionStorage.setItem('hasReloaded' + key, 'true');\n} else {\n    sessionStorage.setItem('hasReloaded' + key, 'false');\n}</script>{code}\n\nThis will automatically switch to sorting by Date Ascending. You can tweak it to suit your needs. \n(i) *This will only work for JIRA server installations. JIRA Cloud [does not support|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRA-27864] inserting custom code into the announcement banner.*\n\nIf you are on cloud, or are an individual user that wants to have this functionality without inserting it for everyone, you can use the user script: [^JIRA Order Attachments by Date.user.js] within [Tampermonkey|https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en] for Chrome, or [Greasemonkey|https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/] for Firefox.",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-9380].\r\n{panel}\r\n{panel:title=Atlassian Update \u2013 3 December 2020|borderStyle=solid|borderColor=#ebf2f9|titleBGColor=#ebf2f9|bgColor=#ffffff}\r\nHi all!\r\n\r\nMy name is Jonno and I\u2019m a PM on the editing experience in Jira Cloud (including Jira Software and Jira Service Management). Thanks for all this feedback. Given the level of interest we\u2019ve conducted some research to reassess the link click behaviour across Jira Cloud and our other products like Confluence Cloud that use our new editing experience.\r\n\r\n+*Decision:*+\r\n\r\nBased off our research,\u00a0*we will keep the existing default behaviour.*\r\n\r\nThis existing default behaviour is:\r\n * All links in the editor (i.e. the mode where you can see a toolbar and insert content) will open in a new tab by default.\r\n\r\n * All links in the renderer (i.e. the published/saved view of an issue description, comment, etc) will open in the same tab by default.\r\n\r\n+*Reasoning:*+\r\n\r\nWe assessed multiple approaches and landed on keeping the existing behaviour for the following reasons.\r\n\r\nFor users in the editor:\r\n * We don\u2019t want a user to be moved away from the current work they\u2019re doing so open the link in a new tab by default. This is common behaviour.\r\n\r\nFor users in the renderer:\r\n * Common link-click behaviour on the web is to open in the same tab.\r\n\r\n * If we open links in a new tab by default, it\u2019s impossible for a user to open the link in the same tab. For opening in same tab by default, however, there are common ways to open in a new tab, like cmd + click (Mac), ctrl + click (Windows & Linux), right click then select open link in new tab, or pressing the middle button on a mouse.\r\n\r\n * From an accessibility standpoint it is better to stick with the default browser behaviour and open links in the same tab. The main arguments for this are:\r\n ** Assistive technology users can become disoriented when a link opens a new tab or window. They cannot use the back button to return to their previous location. We want to minimize this as much as possible. We have a toolbar button for opening links in the editor to give those with accessibility needs guidance that a new tab is opening.\r\n ** People with mobility or dexterity issues who rely on a keyboard may find it difficult or painful to perform additional navigation tasks.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nFor both the renderer and editor:\r\n * We decided against giving user-level control of how their links open when clicked. Aside from the accessibility and other reasons mentioned above, we believe this could cause confusion to consumers of the content. This is because every link could hypothetically open in a different way. It wouldn\u2019t afford the consumer of the content a predictable experience when clicking on a link.\r\n\r\n*Next steps:*\r\n\r\nI know this won\u2019t be the decision a number of you are looking for, and I\u2019m sorry for that. It\u2019s what we believe is the best decision, for the majority of our user base, with the current information we have at our disposal.\r\n\r\nBased off this decision, I\u2019ll be closing this ticket and marking it as \u201cClosed\u201d.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019re always looking to reassess and improve our experiences. If new information comes to light that suggests we should iterate this approach, we\u2019ll definitely reconsider.\r\n\r\nThanks again for your feedback.\r\n\r\nJonno | PM, Atlassian Cloud Editor\r\n{panel}\r\nSome users need to have external links in Description / Comments to open in new browser window.\r\n Looks like this should be per-user configurable.\r\n\r\n*Workaround*\r\n Use the middle-click on your mouse if you have a three-button mouse, ctrl-click on Windows/Unix, or cmd-click on Mac.",

The concept of features is common in agile software development that Jira is missing. Having a product that has an epic categorization should have multiple features of which multiple PBIs (product backlog items) and sub-tasks can be many. A story is but one type of PBI.\r\n\r\nIf Atlassian would establish this hierarchy in Jira they could still use portfolio management with initiatives as a higher level.\r\n\r\nWe would like to be able to use Initiative/Epic/Feature/PBI (Story)/Sub-task as the standard hierarchy from which all data can be measured.",

      "description": "h3. Issue Summary\r\nUpon investigation of a performance case, we figured out with our developers that a combination of high number of the following elements can impact on page load throughout the bulk operation process potentially leading even to timeouts depending on the request time:\r\n* Number of custom fields\r\n* Number of issues\r\n* Number of issue types\r\n* Number of projects\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n(sample reproduction scenario looks like this)\r\n\r\n # Create 60 custom fields \r\n # Create 1000 issues (max limit for bulk move issues selection)\r\n # Bulk move 1000 issues from one project to another \r\n\r\nThe response time of page load for one destination project issue type page(in step 3 of bulk move), depends on the product of *number of issues selected* for that particular destination project issue type and the *average number of custom fields* present in those issues(issues selected can be of different source project and issue types with a varying number of custom fields).\r\n\r\nAs the timeout for the proxy to return the response of page load is 60s (and if assumed on average one method call takes 1ms), so in order to cross the 60s timeout, we require 60 custom fields(average) with 1000 issues (Max limit for issues selection in bulk move) and this is just for one of the method calls, if we also consider the execution time of other methods this will definitely cross the timeout threshold.\r\n\r\nThe number of issues and custom fields mentioned are for worst case scenario, in actual, there can be a case where the timeout can even occur for 40s calculated time(due to addition of other methods execution time) and for issues count *lesser than 1000* with a high number of custom fields (500). More information on other methods taking more execution time can be found on this [page|https://hello.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/JPCE/pages/1067709801/Investigating+slowness+in+Bulk+Operations]\r\n\r\nThe Number of project and issue types adds to the slowness of bulk move operation, as the number of page loads in step 3 of bulk move depends on the *number of distinct destination project and issue types selection*. eg. In a bulk move process, if the user has selected 15~20 different target projects and issue types combinations, they have to go through 15~20 screens of field and workflow mappings for the selected targets, which takes the bulk move experience more time to go through and complete.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nBulk operation should be loaded as usual without page timeouts.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nBulk operation is slow and eventually times out.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\nCurrently there is no known workaround for this behavior. A workaround will be added here when available",
