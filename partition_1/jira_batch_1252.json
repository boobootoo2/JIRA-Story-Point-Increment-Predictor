These transitions tend to exist for almost all of our statuses. This means I have to recreate each transition for each status instead of using the \"common transition\" available in the workflow designer.  As an example, I recently had to add 3 transition for each of our 8 different states.  Each transition involved complex conditions and post functions.  It took me about 5 VERY TEDIOUS hours to get this done.  I know it is possible to specify a '-1' for originating step directly in the xml, but it is simply impossible for us to deactivate and reactivate a workflow to accomplish this as we have over 100k issues that would have to transition to a new workflow; this would take many hours to run.  Adding \"originating step\" as a choice in the gui for the destination step would be a huge improvement.  If I had that functionality, it would have taken me only a short time to add the transitions.",

However, it can be quite tedious if the transitions are complex whereby validators, conditions, and post functions has been set for that function.\n\nImagine having to delete all of them and set them up again.

A current example is that I'm building out a request to use Jira for project tracking.  I've created a 'Project Tracking' issue type for that, and all enhancements/defects across projects will be linked to the issue type.  However, I would want to customize the display so in addition to the summary I could see the Status (not the tiny icon) and also other custom fields, such as 'Schedule' so I can see if the linked issue is behind/on/ahead of schedule, as well as the Fix Version for issues.  I'd also like to one click sort by the links instead of having to go into the back end and manipulate a file.  When having a large number of linked issues, being able to manipulate how we view the data would be hugely advantageous.",

I attached the screenshot from this issue I'm creating.  When I see the dropdown looking like this, my first thought is something is wrong with the current selection -- like the issue type \"Bug\" is no longer supported, so I need to choose a different issue type.  My other frustration with this is my company has the following priorities: Blocker, Critical, Major, Minor, Trivial.  So when something like Major is selected, and I want to check where it falls in order of priority, it's not immediately visible because Major does not appear in the list.  Then I often pick what I know to be the lowest priority, Trivial, to see where Major is ordered in the list.  It's just one more thing that makes adopting a new system more difficult.",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-30901].\n  {panel}\n\nA workflow we commonly use on our team is that issues transition through from \"open\" to \"done\" (with some steps in between) and if / when bugs are found with the change the issue is re-opened so it can be evaluated further. It would be nice to have a summary metric, say calculated per sprint / iteration, that showed the total number of DIs that entered each state per sprint.\n\nThe sample workflow would look something like this: issue is created, assessed and worked upon via one or more state transitions (e.g.: open->analysing->in progress) and it get re-assigned to another team member for final testing and validation (e.g.: by setting it to a \"testing\" state). A bug is found with the implementation and so the issue is re-opened. If a large number of issues fall into this category, say 50%, it indicates possible problems earlier in the workflow which may suggest possible workflow improvements (e.g.: perhaps the requirements were unclear or the implementation was not up to par). By being able to measure the total number of issues per-sprint that transitioned at some point to the \"re-opened\" state it allows leads to spot such issues much easier.\n\nAs mentioned on my somewhat related DI JIRA-30900, there may be some alternate means through which we can calculate such a metric (scripts, third-party plugins, etc.) but I have not found any yet. I am open to suggestions. However, ideally this would be an integrated feature in Jira not requiring any special configuration.",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-30900].\n  {panel}\n\nMy team works on a diverse set of issues and as such it proves difficult to isolate bottlenecks in our development pipeline. One thing that would help this analysis is if Jira had a report or some summary information available that showed the total amount of time each DI spends in a particular state.\n\nFor example, suppose you have 5 states in your workflow: TODO, Analysis, In Progress, Testing, and Done. Further, suppose it takes on average 2 days to complete each storypoint (e.g.: as a Kanban velocity metric) and you have a desire to increase your velocity by 50%. It would be nice to measure how long each issue spends in each state as this could provide an indicator of where the most time is spent in the workflow, and hence has the most potential for improvement. For example, if out of the 2 days issues on average spend 75% of their time in the \"testing\" state, then perhaps you should focus your efforts on improving your testing procedures.\n\nAt its simplest level, this information could be provided on a per-issue basis so if there are specific outliers on a sprint or iteration that need attention one could evaluate the metrics for those particular items. Conversely, it would be nice to have more elaborate reporting features that could amalgamate these metrics on a per-sprint / iteration basis as well. (e.g.: total time issues spent in analysis this sprint, etc.)\n\nPerhaps there is some way to write a script to calculate these metrics, or maybe a third party plugin or something, but I have yet to find a workable solution for this problem. Ideally it could be integrated into the standard functionality of Jira but I would be opened to alternative suggestions.",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-30883].\n  {panel}\n\nWe recently upgraded to Jira 5.1.8, and it's been working pretty well. However, in-line editing of simple fields such as labels or Version fields can be pretty slow. \nWhat's actually slow is the time taken to \"save\" the field. The reason I emphasize \"save\" is that Jira is not just saving the new data, but also receiving a lot of data back from the server as part of the response. I accept there's a certain amount of latency in our case between the client and server, but there's a distinct data issue which plays a much larger part in the perception of the speed of the save action\n\nHow much data depends on the individual Jira instance, and in our case it's approx. 600kb. Looking at the http response details with the Chrome developer tools shows that it's essentially getting a fresh copy of all of the fields (system & custom) and field values that are applicable to the issue in question.\n\nThis is hugely wasteful for a simple field update. There's a couple of options here:\n# Improve the response so the client is only retrieving the refreshed field values, and updating/appending the DOM accordingly\n# When the value is submitted, check to see if any of the other issue fields have been updated (by other users working on the same issue), and retrieve those updated/added values along with the field you're currently updating\n\nEither way, the goal is have only what is being updated being returned to the browser and possibly having a little more intelligence on the client side around inserting what is effectively a diff.\n\nFWIW, we're using GZIP compression, so the 600KB is the compressed size",
