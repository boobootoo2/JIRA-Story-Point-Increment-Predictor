As a small company we have more than 500 but less than 1,000 employees. Currently if we had to renew it would be a $4,000 increase from our last renewal which I've already been told is unacceptable.\n\nOther than IT projects we use Jira as a Help Desk ticketing system. Although a good majority of our 700 employees never log onto Jira, we use it to communicate automaticaly upon opening/closing a ticket or email them with further follow up. \n\nIt appears my only option is to remove these non-essential customers from the Jira Users Group which will result in our license limit to decrease, but will impact how we communicate to our in-house customers. \n\nUnless you have any other suggestions",

Especially in larger enterprise instances with hundreds of projects managing project roles seems to be a common task for project administrators.\n\n*Current behaviour*\nNow if an user tries to open an issue he/she does not have the permission to view he/she gets an permission violation screen. On this permission violation screen the only contacts currently named are the \"JIRA administrators\". \n\n*Improvement* \nBut if project role administration is mostly done by project administrators, it would be helpful to show the name/s of the project lead/project administrators for the current project on the permission violation screen as well. Users could than directly contact the project lead and in most cases would get faster access to the project/issue than by contacting global JIRA administrators.\nAs not every installation of JIRA would like to have this feature, e.g. public mode instances, showing the project leads/project administrators on the permission violation screen should be optional. This could be a global option or a per-project option. An additional option could be to show just the plain name or an e-mail link.",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-35086].\n  {panel}\n\nAccording to the [Global Permission|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Managing+Global+Permissions] article:\n{quote}\nPermission to log in to JIRA.\n(warning)  The number of users that count towards your JIRA license is the sum of all users (including users in groups) that \n{quote}\n\nUpon the description, we understand that JIRA license is calculate based on the JIRA User permission. However, this is my finding below in JIRA 6.x vanilla instance:\n* The user under *JIRA Users* and has *Active* condition will be count towards JIRA license.\n* The user under *JIRA Administrators* and has *Active* condition will be count towards JIRA license (without *JIRA Users*).\n* The user under *JIRA System Administrators* and has *Active* condition will be count towards JIRA license (without *JIRA Users* or *JIRA Administrators*).\n* The users under *JIRA Users*, *JIRA Administrators* and has *Active* condition will be count towards JIRA license.\n* The users under *JIRA Users*, *JIRA Administrators*, *JIRA System Administrators* and has *Active* condition will be count towards JIRA license.\n\nIn *summary*, if the user have any groups in Global Permission with *Active* condition, the user definitely count toward JIRA license and also able logged in JIRA. For example, comparing this two article:\n* [JIRA Global Permission|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Managing+Global+Permissions]\n* https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRAKB/How+to+Get+a+List+of+Active+Users+Counting+Towards+the+JIRA+License\n\nThe article could mislead our users in future about how user counts toward JIRA license.",

Other issue types have different prefixes. When I select 'Issue Type' in 'Create Issue' window I have plain list. It could be great if I suffix acts as parent of tree and the rest of issue type name acts as leaf. So I may choose from the following tree:\n\nSupport\n     \\-- Consulting\n     \\-- Techincal Issue\nDevelopment\n     \\-- User Interface\n\nand so on.\n\nBest regards,\nAlexander Afonyashin",
