      "description": "It would be nice to be able to customize some of the git settings that SourceTree uses - for example, the number of log entries to try and load, as well as how often to refresh the files on disk.  When loading a \"huge\" git repository (and likely an hg repository as well) - such as https://github.com/mozilla/gecko-dev, SourceTree seems to hang periodically when trying to load items in the log windows (the spinning wheel overlay just sits there).  Also - since a full refresh can take a while, it would be nice if that could be configured to happen manually (or at least less often...it appears to happen every 15 seconds or so).\r\n\r\nOptions like this might be more suitable for specific repositories - rather than system-wide...but even system-wide options to control max number of log lines, and refresh rates would be helpful.",

      "description": "I've been spending the past couple years doing a lot of UI development (building my own controls, gesture recognizers, etc).  Many of the commits that I put into my repository are to fix bugs or add enhancements to the UI.  I can spend 20 minutes a day writing commit messages, but invariably, when I go back through the logs, I'm often don't have enough information.  Sometimes this is because of context.  Trying to remember the big picture from 6 months ago is hard.\r\n\r\nWhen I do my testing, a lot of it is broken into small use cases.  I think it would be just about invaluable if I could go back and *watch* the use case that was being enabled or fixed.  Sure, I could go through the hassle of putting a bug report together for every checkin and then attaching the video to it, but that's a lot of noise, especially when a lot of work is done on branches.  Its also duplicative - and a pain to track down when I want to look at the logs.  I could also checkout an old copy of my repository (which I often do), but this is error prone (did I rerun the use case exactly?), and tedious.  \r\n\r\nIf a picture's worth a thousand words, wouldn't it be great to be able to include one (or a video) alongside some words.\r\n\r\nMy guess is that I would want this to be stored semi-detached from the rest of my repository.  I wouldn't want to *require* another user to take all of this multimedia content too - and considering that it isn't versioned, it might not even make sense in git.  On the other hand, if it could be stored maybe in an adjacent repository somehow, maybe that would be a good compromise.\r\n\r\nI realize that implementing something like this is all over the place - and one could argue that it should have either been in git/hg to begin w/ or not at all (though given that they're command line centric, this seems unlikely to be a super compelling need).  It seems like a front-end like SourceTree could really simplify it and unify a lot of logs/commit editors together to give a really great use case.  I really like using SourceTree and would love to be able to get more reliable histories while still being able to use it!\r\n\r\nIf you have another idea on how to easily integrate this sort of log enhancement, please advise, and I can follow up elsewhere.  Thx.",

Meanwhile, the sudden arrival of an old friend surprises Trubel; and in Vienna, Viktor meets with a completely broken Adalind.\"\r\nMake sure you tune in to NBC tonight at 9 PM (official ET/PT start time) to catch all of the Season 4, Episode 6 entertainment!\r\n\r\n\u00bb\u00bbWon't be able to catch Episode 6 of \"Grimm\" Season 4 on a TV? Well, we've got you covered with free online live stream links!\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00bb http://w.atch.me/cY5wic\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00bbhttp://w.atch.me/cY5wic\r\n\r\n\r\nCheck out a live stream of \"Grimm\" S04E06 on this NBC free live stream channel online - click here, here or here (one link may work over another due to region restrictions) to watch Episode 6 from your computer!\r\nWhat should we look forward to for tonight's episode and the rest of the new season? Warning: spoilers ahead!\r\n\r\nAs we previously reported, \"Juliette finally decides to help Nick get his powers back! Question is: will it work? Read on to find out what will happen in this Friday's \"Grimm\" season 4 episode! Last episode, Nick found out that Juliette has to sleep with him as Adalind for him to get his powers back. Although he refused to subject Juliette into the ordeal, he also admitted to Monroe he's \"pissed\" that he lost his powers because he did like being a Grimm. \r\n\r\nWith Monroe and Rosalee getting a new threat, however, Juliette decided to help him become a Grimm again, even if it means she has to look like Adalind while doing so. In the teaser clip for episode 6, \"Highway Of Tears,\" Juliette will do just that but it seems that the cure won't work. Will Nick ever get his powers back? It also seems that he will suffer another mind-numbing connection with Adalind in the middle of an investigation. Will it put him in danger?\r\n\r\nDavid Giuntoli, who plays Nick Burkhardt previously said in a past interview that he doesn't really know what his character and Adalind's \"magical, horrible\" connection is. He \"certainly can't say how this all ends.\" Claire Coffee (who plays Adalind), on the other hand, teased, \"[it] links them in a way that's going to be explosive come Episode 8.\r\n\r\n\" Will we have to wait until episode 8 to meet a newly re-Grimmed Nick? For now, viewers will have to watch Trubel defend him from wayward Wesens with her machete. According to the \"Grimm\" season 4 episode 6 synopsis, \"Nick and Hank will get called to a stretch of highway that acts as a staging area for a horrifying Wesen ritual.\" If his powers are still not back, Nick will surely be in danger in this Friday's episode. Meanwhile, after being subjected to a psychological torture, Adalind finally agrees to assist Viktor in looking for her daughter.\r\n\r\nWith Captain Renard's mother, Elizabeth, also set on finding Baby Diana, will they be meeting each other soon? The only remaining Grimm (that we know of) in Portland, Trubel, will reportedly get a surprise visit from \"an old friend.\" Whether that friend is the good or bad kind is still unknown.\"",

      "description": "It seems to be related to sourcetree being in foreground. Some operation that is doing automatic updates to the view seems to be crashing.\r\n\r\nIt mostly happens when it is behind other windows and then moved to foreground by clicking its icon on the Dock.\r\n\r\nTried uninstall/reinstall It did not have any effect.\r\n\r\nThe traceback seems to be really similar to a recently fixed ticket instead this crashes at a slightly different place in the code.\r\n\r\nNOTE: It doesn't crash this much for my colleagues so this may be a configuration issue or something related to a bad working copy of one of my repos. I have 13 repos registered with sourcetree(Hg and git as well) and I am usually working with a bigger one that has multiple git submodules.
