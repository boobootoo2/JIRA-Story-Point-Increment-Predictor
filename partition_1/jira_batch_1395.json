This is bad, because someone using FishEye to browse the repository will have no idea they are not there.\r\n\r\nIf I do not use the \"exclude\" feature, the index caches are HUGE. I have a relatively new repository that is, at present, 55MB in size on the server disk (just the Subversion directory), and most of that space is from binary files (PDFs + schematic files). With most binary files excluded, the FishEye cache is 1.6MB. Without any exclude entries, the FishEye cache is 58MB which is slightly larger than the repository itself. This is bad since it is needlessly wasted space for files that have no benefit from full-text indexing, and I expect the situation to get worse as my repository becomes larger (I'm only at revision 38 right now).\r\n\r\nRight now it's a lose-lose situation. Please fix and make it possible to view the basic properties of a file in Fisheye + see its history, while excluding it from full-text indexing, which is useless on binary files and on files that are not meant to be human-editable or have meaningful diffs.",

I am currently running in parallel to our production installation an evaluation license to index a large repository and to move the resource intensive indexing to a non production server. The problem occurs on our evaluation licensed server but is affecting the production environment since we use a shared account for different systems to access SVN.\r\n\r\nI was adding a new repository and had enable immediately checked. I entered the password with a typo (letter O confused with number 0). The problem is, that Fisheye seems to try to connect several times. Our authentication server locks the account after three failed log on attempts. Stopping the misconfigured repository did not help. Our Network operations group reported that the account was locked immediately again after unlocking it. I had to stop and start Fisheye to solve this issue.\r\n\r\nFor me I need to remember not to enable the repository immediately and first test the connection. It would be great if the initial screen would have a \"test connection\" function as well which is only available after the repository was added which is then too late if something goes wrong with the configuration.\r\n\r\nAndreas\r\n{quote}",
