      "description": "I dislike the term \"sprint\" a lot. If the team is always in a sprint, they're doing it wrong. On a daily basis there should not be a sense of desperation, or a need to put in overtime. I know the term \"sprint\" comes from scrum, and I'm more familiar with James Shore's version of Agile. I don't know if scrum intends the word to be inherently anxiety provoking, but regardless of intent, in reality it usually means overtime.\r\n\r\nSo I don't want to engage with the team in terms of a sprint. If we're not already using a tool that uses this term, I want to keep it that way.\r\n\r\nBut if I could create a private sprint to manage my goals and reach deadlines without a manager overseeing anything I don't explicitly report, it would be a lot easier to overlook the term and use the tool.\r\n\r\nSo I guess I'm asking to either put an option in the settings for our team to change the word that appears on the button to, perhaps, \"iteration,\" or allow me to create a sprint that is only visible to me.\r\n\r\n[http://www.jamesshore.com/Blog/Scrum-XP-Practices-Cross-Reference.html]",

Summary\r\nJIRA Service Desk does not load after migrating from JIRA Cloud to JIRA Server\r\nJIRA Cloud uses the jira.fixed.cdn.enabled dark feature to improve AWS performance. This dark feature comes along to JIRA Server when JIRA is migrated and causes JIRA Service Desk to not load successfully.\r\nJIRA Cloud needs to disable this feature during the export to Server process.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Export a JIRA Cloud instance\r\n# Restore the backup into JIRA Server\r\n# Open the Customer Notifications page (for example) in a Service Desk project\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nPage load successfully\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nPage displays spinning wheel forever\r\nBrowser console displays \"net::ERR_TOO_MANY_REDIRECTS\" error.\r\n\r\nh3.Workaround\r\nAs described on [this KB article|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRAKB/Service+Desk+is+stuck+at+loading+after+upgrade+to+version+3.3]\r\n# Navigate to jira-url/secure/SiteDarkFeatures!default.jspa\r\n# Locate jira.fixed.cdn.enabled and press Disable (this will remove it from the list of dark features)",
