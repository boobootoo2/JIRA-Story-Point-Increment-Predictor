Issue Summary\r\n\r\nWhen using a Checkboxes field, with many options (enough to need to scroll), then the options on the bottom will typically be cut off from the page if the page is not pre-scrolled to accommodate the pop-up.

Environment\r\nNew Issue View\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Create a \"CheckBoxes\" field and fill it with lots of options. Around 15 or so should work.\r\n# Open an issue in the board view (the pop-up modal) as this is a smaller screen and more likely to cause the issue.\r\n# Scroll such that you can see the list but leave it such that it is closer to the bottom of the screen when you click it.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nThe System detects that some options will not fit in the view and either resize the menu such that it fits on the screen or scrolls the page to improve the focus on the menu. \r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nThe dropdown menu only shows partially as it is cut off from the rest of the screen.\r\n \r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n- If you have a scroll wheel or equivalent, you can scroll the page manually to fit.\r\n- you can pre-scroll to ensure the most space for the popup.\r\n\r\nYou may need to ensure that the field layout places the checkboxes fields closer to the top to ensure that space is more likely to be available.",

This seems to have started to happen when the old issue view started to handle mentions as *\\[Full Name|~accountid:<id>\\]* instead of referencing the email address.\r\n\r\nCurrently, however, the \"commentMention\" event is *not* being fired upon a mention in the *old issue view*, causing email notifications to *not be sent* unless the user is configured as a recipient of the *Issue Commented* event.\r\n\r\nh3.

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-69400].\r\n{panel}\r\nh3. Problem Definition\r\n\r\nSeveral past cases have been reported of Jira admins trying to use a user custom field value or a group custom field value to set a project permissions such as 'Create Issue' or 'Browse Project'. The intention of the admin here is to only allow the possible users in that custom field options to have that specific permission. This does not work though for these specific permissions, because in order to evaluate these permissions the issue has to already be created in Jira. These custom fields would have to have a value set within them on an issue already created. The potential values of that field are not valid as a means to impose a permission grant on those specific permission options. In the case of creating issues, it can't possibly work because the issue is not created yet.\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nChange the way permission schemes work and edit the screens there in to prevent admins trying to set permissions that can never possibly be valid within Jira. This could be done by specifically removing 'user custom field value' and 'group custom field value' from the objects that cannot possibly honor their hypothetical values yet. We know this includes at least create issue and browse project, but there could be others in play here as well.\r\nh3. Why this is important\r\n\r\nLots of admins in Jira have attempted to configure this because Jira allows it, But can't possibly honor it. It causes high levels of frustration and angry users to have Jira let you do something that it has no expectation of being able to do.\r\n https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-26659\r\n https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-30783\r\n https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-66317\r\n https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-21613\r\n https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-30783\r\n [https://community.atlassian.com/t5/Jira-Software-questions/JIRA-Bug-with-Group-Custom-Field-Permission-Settings/qaq-p/734856]\r\nh3.

There are very few \"useful\" filters that are capable of displaying a static set of issues.\r\n\r\nWhat I would find extremely useful would be the ability to capture the results of a given filter in a static list. I would expect the this to be possible by capturing the issuekey for each item that exists in the current results and generating a new filter based exclusively on issuekey. Users would be given the option to name this query when it is created.\r\n\r\nI am aware that I can filter by issuekey in the advanced filter settings. But creating a query based on issuekey manually is not feasible because I may be looking at hundreds of issues I am trying to capture in a query that would deliver the same results every time I run it.\r\n\r\nIdeally, this could be a button that appears in line with the filter settings. \"Capture Results\" would be an ideal name for this button.",
