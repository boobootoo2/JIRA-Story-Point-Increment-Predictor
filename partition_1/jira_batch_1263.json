When editing - they have to switch back to view mode to see what person the field is referring to, and for email notifications they need to click into the issue to see issue in view mode to understand what person the field is referring to, which negates the values of the user field being in the email notification in the first place.\n\n\"Reporter\" and \"Assignee\" show the user's display name, so:\n\nTester: Mark Mielke\nResolution Prime: Mark Mielke\n\nWe want \"user\" custom fields to operate the same as \"Reporter\" and \"Assignee\" for \"Edit Screen\" and email notifications.\n\nWe recognize that our numeric usernames may make us somewhat unique - however, I would suggest that any company with thousands of users will eventually find that usernames conflict, and a scheme such as \"first letter of first name, followed by last name\" resulting in \"mmielke\" for myself, will eventually break down, leading to \"majohnso\" to represent \"Mark Johnson\", and the same problem as we have with numeric usernames exists with a formula based username.\n",

I can make a search, then View - Full content and then perform a browser find with the string \"attach\".\n\nIt would be better if there was a field in the Issue Navigator search area (to the left) where I could use a checkbox saying: \"Only with file(s) attached\" and even better - with a second field labelled: \"Attache file name pattern\", where I e.g. could write \"*.jpg\" to restrict files with jpg extension. (of course JQL must be extended accordingly)\n\nIt would also be nice to be able to show attatch fies in one navigator column. Subtasks can be displayed as a navigator column (even thoug it is not an attriubte exactly, so why not attatched files too). In my opinion the file name(s) of the attatched files need not to be displayed in the column, keep it narrow and just show one icon for a single file attachment (and possibly another for mutiple file attatchment) It clould also be nice to be able to click on the attache file icon(s) and see the file of course.",

What\u2019s the deal?\nI\u2019m pleased to say that we have completed the necessary additional functionality to include Active Objects data when importing projects. This means you can now carry over your JIRA Agile project data between instances.\n\nh5. What\u2019s included?\n*Sprint* and *Ranking* data are considered to be the most important types of data in JIRA Agile and was included in the Active Objects being imported.\n\nAs mentioned in our previous update, the solution doesn\u2019t include all data found in JIRA Agile. *Boards*, which harboured too much complexity to deliver in this solution within a reasonable timeframe, has been excluded from this implementation.\n\nh5. When can I use this?\nJIRA Server will need to wait until the next major release of JIRA to utilise this feature.\nDue to the internal changes necessary to provide this functionality, _both the +exporting+ and +importing+ JIRA instances need to be versions which have this new implementation_. This means Active Objects *_will not_* be imported when involving any instance that is not up-to-date with this functionality.\n\nOnce again, thank you for your patience and a *big thank you* to all the beta candidates that helped during our testing program for this feature.\n\nRegards,\nKerrod Williams\nJIRA Product Management\nkewilliams at atlassian dot com  \n{panel}\n\n\\\\\n\nIf you are looking for JIRA Agile specific data, we are tracking this separately here: https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/GHS-10577\n\n*Original description below*\nCurrently, when performing a project import, it does not restore any plugin data, including JIRA Agile (formerly GreenHopper).  This is an issue, as many customers do use both JIRA with GH integration.\n\nWith the more recent releases of plugins, information is stored within AO tables, which the project import also ignores.  Some sample information that should be included:\n* Ranking\n* Start/End/Release dates for versions",

This behavior is unwanted if you have users which can fix the filters but doesn't have the necessary grants to query the database.\nThis error message should display the name of the filter so the user knows which of their filters needs to be fixed/edited.\n\nSee attached screen capture.\n\nThanks,\n",

This would make it a lot easier to understand the context when looking at a sub-task.\n\nA solution might be to copy values from the parent to the sub-task, but I do not want to do that because my definitions of both are very different and they contain a different set of fields / the fields are used for different purposes.\n\nI attached a mockup of what I imagine it to look like.",

The parent issue is just used as a container to wrap all the sub-tasks. Our problem is that in terms of reporting and managing the work, one would almost certainly only want to look at the parent issue level (either directly at the issue or in a report) but the parent issue does not include any information from the sub-task.\n\nI imagine this should function like the \"Include Sub-tasks\" feature for Estimates, where you can either just show the values of the parent or the accumulated values of the sub-tasks. Thus the activity log would show for the parent:\n\nUser ABC commented on ABC-42 - foobar not working\nUser XYZ started progress on ABC-42 / ABC-23 - Initial Investigation\n...",

It's the same for PR2 project.\n\nAnd this is the same for notification (PR1-notification with PR1-dev and PR1-management group).\n\nSo, I've a lot of permission scheme, and a lot of notification scheme, and a lot of group.\n\nSO, I maybe, it should be good to have a general notification scheme for permission, notification and group and to be able to use a variable for name of permissions, notifications and group.\n\nFor exemple, a solution could be:\n- in general config, enable or not variable name for permission, notification and group name\n- some available variable should be \"project name\", \"key\", ....\n- in creation of group, notification scheme or permission scheme, we can use a variable name. For example, <ProjName> would be substituted by the name of the project.\n\nDon't hesitate to contact me for more explaination :)\n\nThanks\n\nMickael THIEVENT\nSILKAN",

This is achieved by having a salesforce a configured salesforce user in jira with \"Configured Columns\" for the search results).\n\nSo what happens when a developer is logged into JIRA using their own account, and then switch to salesforce and cause salesforce to perform a search, the search (with salesforce account info) logs out the developer from JIRA and logs in the salesforce account!!!\n\nThis then causes the developer to have to log out from JIRA and log back in as themselves....\n\nHow can we prevent the salesforce search from logging out logged in JIRA users? and also provide a known configured set of fields from the search request to the third party app...",

This is all correct.\n\nHowever, \"mention\" notification e-mails come from the user that executed the mention, which makes e-mail replies go directly back to that user, rather than back to JIRA. This is not desirable behaviour for us \u2013 we would rather that \"mention\" notification e-mails also come from jira@themis.atlassian.net, so that responses go back to the ticket rather than to the individual user.\n\nThanks.{quote}\n\nIn sum, I can easily see arguments for both sides of this (i.e. send from the executing user e-mail address vs. send from JIRA's system address).  What I am suggesting is an option that allows you to select one or the other according to your individual use case.\n\nIn our case, we very much want to keep all of the communication about an issue within JIRA, so that there is a central repository of all information about the issue -- rather than having it scattered around e-mail inboxes.\n\nObviously we can work around this by never replying to a \"mention\" e-mail, but it'd be much nicer if the \"mention\" e-mail could be replied to and the result was appended to the JIRA issue as a comment.\n\nThanks!",

The key difference between the two that I find really frustrating.\n\n\nConsider this scenario. I want to lower to priority of this field using a normal select list. Ordering matters (is critical, in fact) in this case. \n\nI click on the field.\n\n!https://img.skitch.com/20120621-k8nxyyjiec39qebkwhennxjhnq.png!\n\nFor a normal select list, it clearly shows where my current selection is (highlighted). I can easily select the item below or above it. Since the order matters, I also see where in the range of values my select is.\n\n!https://img.skitch.com/20120621-k51kuddfgmcnq2e5u2mgrm32b4.png!\n\nFor the Frotherized drop down, you don't see the selected value in the list. You don't know what's above or below the current select value and you need to already know where the value sits in the continuum. The _first_ item on that list is what's selected, which isn't really what you want. From a keytboard shortcut it also doesn't really work.\n\n\nh2. Thoughts on a solution\n\nThis is a big problem on fields / lists where order is critical (priority fields) and an annoyance on places where order is not critical (e.g. Rapid board drop down in GH, I know the board I care about all start with Bamboo, it'd be _nice_ if that area was highlighted).\n\n\nI understand the heritage of Frother as an auto-complete / type ahead and search replacement,, rather than a select list but if we're going to support having the down arrow on the right and ability to use it like a select list, it really needs to work like one when you click on it.\n\nI think it would work if:\n\n* When no text has entered in the input field, onclick or on down arrow, show all values (if the drop arrow mode enabled) with the current value highlighted\n* If you start typing in the field, the current behaviour is used. \n\nThis is a pattern that's starting to repeat itself in a lot of places, and I think we need to seriously look at it from a overall UX perspective.\n\nMaybe FEF or Design Trunk should look at this to get some consistency?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
