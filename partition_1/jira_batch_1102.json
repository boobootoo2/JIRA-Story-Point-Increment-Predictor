Perhaps the last two cases are not feasible as that pattern is pretty generic, but at least it should interpret and parse lowercase keys as well.",

Problem Definition\r\nRight now, the issue creation through HTML links mentioned in [this article|https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirakb/creating-issues-via-direct-html-links-159474.html] is meant to be used on Jira Server, and also the article says this feature is not a supported component in Jira applications:\r\n{quote}\r\nThe JIRA functionality described on this page is not maintained as a supported component of JIRA applications. Consequently Atlassian cannot guarantee to provide any assistance in configuring or implementing it.\r\n\r\nWe recommend using the JIRA REST API instead of following the steps on this page, as the content is now quite outdated. Please see our JIRA REST API Tutorials for further information.\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nThis feature is not mentioned in Cloud, but it works, if the correct parameters are set: https://<instancename>.atlassian.net/secure/CreateIssue!default.jspa?pid=<project id>\r\nHowever, some unexpected behavior may be noticed, since it's not formally supported.\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\nSupport this feature to create issues through an HTML link, and provide to the user a way to generate a link to this create issue modal with preset values, as it is stated in the previously mentioned article.\r\n\r\nIf the customer has a public project, the users still need to browse on the instance and navigate to the desired project to create issues.\r\n\r\nh3. Why this is important\r\nSome customers don't have knowledge on REST API, as it mentioned as a workaround in the article, therefore supporting this feature would be useful for the customer that wants to provide a direct link to create issues to internal or external users.\r\n \r\nh3. Workaround \r\nUse REST API to create issues.\r\n",

      "description": "{panel:title=Status Update|borderStyle=solid|borderColor=#ff7f7f|titleBGColor=#ff7f7f|bgColor=#e5e5e5}\r\nHi everyone,\r\n\r\nThere are at least two related but distinct themes on this issue, so it's important that we address both of them to avoid any misunderstanding. The first is regarding tables and emoji in the new issue view. Due to technical constraints, some of you currently won't be able to create tables and emoji in the new issue view. This effects anyone who doesn't yet have the new issue view for full-page issues. We expect to remedy this over the next few months so that anyone using the new view will be able to create tables and emoji. The method for creating these, though, will be via markdown. For those of you in this category, if you need to create tables or use emoji in the meantime, you can click through to the old issue view or turn off the new issue view for now by going to your avatar > Personal settings.\r\n\r\nFor anyone who already has the new issue view for full-page issues though, you can add tables and emoji to your content by clicking the table button in the UI, using the Shift + Option + T shortcut, or by pressing / (this is a handy shortcut to know) and starting to type \"table\". You can read more about markdown formatting in Jira Cloud in our [documentation|https://support.atlassian.com/jira-software-cloud/docs/markdown-and-keyboard-shortcuts/].\r\n\r\nThe second theme is wiki markup generally. To be transparent, we are closing this issue as we have no plans to support wiki markup in the new editor and new issue view. We're supporting markdown across Jira, Confluence, and Bitbucket Cloud to provide a more modern and consistent editing experience. For anyone using multiple Atlassian products, we believe this will provide the best editing experience. You can read more about the changes [here|https://community.developer.atlassian.com/t/jira-cloud-new-issue-view-editor-changes/29993].\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n Nehal Jain\r\n Jira Product Management\r\n{panel}\r\nh3. Summary\r\n\r\nWhen attempting to create a table in the Comment or Description field in the New Jira Issue View, the table is not rendering correctly.\r\nh3. Environment\r\n - Atlassian Cloud\r\n - New Jira Issue View\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Ensure that you have enabled the New Jira Issue View\r\n # Go to a board, click on an issue.\r\n # In the Comment or Description field, attempt to create a table.\r\n -- \r\n||header||\r\n|text|\r\n\r\n # This also affects tags which are using the curly brackets.\r\n -- \r\n{code:java}\r\n Text \\{code}\r\n -- {noformat} Text \\{noformat}\r\n -- {quote} Text \\{quote}\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n - In the field, you will see this table:\r\n||header||\r\n|text|\r\n\r\n - The text in between the Wiki Markup tags will also be formatted.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n - The table will not rendered. Instead, you will see the literal characters without any formatting.\r\n - The text in between the Wiki Markup tags will not be formatted.\r\n\r\nh3. Notes\r\n - After attempting to create a table through the New Jira Issue View, editing the Comment or Description field from the Old Issue View, we can see that the Vertical Bar character (pipe symbol) is escaped.\r\n{code:java}\r\n\\|\\|header\\|\\|\r\n\\|text\\|\r\n{code}\r\n\r\n - Similarly, all curly brackets will automatically be escaped.\r\n\r\nh3.

      "description": "h3. Summary\r\nWhen you read an issue property and get a 404 response there are two reasons for that. From the documentation:\r\n\r\n> Returned if the issue with given key or id does not exist, if the property with given key is not found, or if the user does not have permission to view the issue.\r\n\r\nSo there are two options:\r\n\r\n1. Issue with given id or key does not exist:\r\n\r\n{code}\r\n{\r\n    \"errorMessages\": [\r\n        \"Issue does not exist or you do not have permission to see it.\"\r\n    ],\r\n    \"errors\": {}\r\n}\r\n{code}\r\n\r\n2. Property with given key does not exist:\r\n\r\n{code}\r\n{\r\n    \"errorMessages\": [\r\n        \"The property foobar does not exist.\"\r\n    ],\r\n    \"errors\": {}\r\n}\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nJira should provide different HTTP error code for the two different cases or there should be an error code in the message that can be checked in code, independent of localization.\r\n\r\nh3. Background\r\nI have an app that stores data in an issue property. I would like to handle these two cases differently and thought I could just distinguish based on the error message. However, there is a problem here. I just noticed that the error message is localized, as in one of my customers has his Jira configured in Spanish and the message says: \"La propiedad foobar no existe.\"\r\n\r\nThis makes it practically impossible to distinguish the two cases unless you check for all possible languages that Jira offers.\r\n\r\nIs this something Atlassian would consider to fix?\r\n\r\nAs posted also here: https://community.developer.atlassian.com/t/issue-property-404-response-too-general/17151 ",

Environment\r\n\r\nJira Software Cloud.\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n * Creating the environment (the same as the one that affected the customer):\r\n\r\n # Create a screen with only the *Comment* field on it (create the screen and remove every field from it's configuration);\r\n # Create a *Field is required* validator in a transition and associate the screen previously created with it;\r\n\r\n * Executing:\r\n ** If you try the transition by directly changing the status in the issue detail view (Labs active), it won't let you type in the comment field:\r\n !Screen Shot 2018-01-24 at 5.20.29 PM.png!\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  !Screen Shot 2018-01-24 at 12.28.28.png!\r\n ** If you drag and drop the card in the board, it works correctly;\r\n ** If you go to the issue view page and try performing the transition from there, it works too.\r\n\r\nh3.
