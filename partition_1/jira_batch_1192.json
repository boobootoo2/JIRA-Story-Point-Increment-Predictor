[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-42116].\n  {panel}\n\n{panel:title=Atlassian Update 23 December 2015|borderStyle=solid|borderColor=#ebf2f9 | titleBGColor=#ebf2f9 | bgColor=#ffffff}\nHi everyone,\n\nThanks for your comments and feedback, we really appreciate your engagement. We've made the decision to close this issue because we want to send a clear message that this is not something JIRA is going to support.\n\nFirst, a few thoughts on this issue in particular.\n* JIRA permission schemes are already very granular and complex. There are several dozen individual permissions that an administrator needs to understand. If these different sets of permissions were mapped at the issue type level, this would multiply the complexity.\n* In our research, we already see major confusion between schemes that map configuration to issue types versus schemes that map configuration to projects.\n** Issue type schemes, permissions, notifications, and issue security are all associated directly to a *project*\n** Workflow schemes, field configuration schemes, and issue type screen schemes map configuration to *issue types*\n* If you were to change the behavior of permission schemes so that they mapped a permission configuration to issue types, you would need to introduce a second layer \u2013 a permission configuration per issue type, and then a permission scheme to associate that set of configurations to a project.\n* This is the exact opposite of the direction we want to go with JIRA. We are investing heavily in reducing complexity in JIRA administration to make it more accessible to more users.\n\nThis does not mean that the needs of JIRA admins are not important. Improving performance and simplifying project configuration are the top two priorities for the JIRA development team for the foreseeable future. However, when looking holistically at how we can improve the project configuration experience in JIRA, this request doesn't fit in to our vision.\n\nA note on requests on jira.atlassian.com:\n* We take the feedback and votes on feature requests on jira.atlassian.com seriously. Certainly the fact that there's 144 votes for this request and it's already been closed before doesn't go unnoticed.\n* When we make the decision to close an issue, our goal is to make a clear statement about which features we realistically expect to support in JIRA and which features we don't expect to implement, at least not in the way they have been described in the feature request. While it might be painful or frustrating in the short term, we strongly committed to communicating our intentions as openly as possible. Everyone is better off in the long run.\n* We have a detailed explanation of how we use jira.atlassian.com and how we develop our roadmap [here|https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/110373/how-does-the-jira-team-use-jira-atlassian-com].\n\nWe're currently in the midst of updating almost every feature request in the JRA project with a significant number of votes. Our hope is that the conclusion you draw is not that Atlassian doesn't care, but that we are trying to focus on the improvements that will the largest benefit for the most customers, and unfortunately this means that we simply cannot work on the vast majority of the hundreds of feature requests at once.\n\nFeel free to contact me at any time if you have feedback or questions. My email address is dmeyer@atlassian.com.\n\nThanks,\nDave Meyer\nProduct Manager, JIRA\n{panel}\n\nReopen JRA-5865 created 10 years ago. I understand the reason why you didn't implement this but there's a LOT or people and company wanting this feature. There's still a lot of activity on the issue comment.\n\nPlease reconsider implementing this feature.\n\nNow, when a group has the permission to create an issue, it could create EVERY types of issues available. It's a complement to project specific issues types. (http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRA-1602)\n\nFor example, If we have external client (like me right now :)) I would be interrested to limit his issue creation right to only bugs, features, external client requests (custom type).",

I don't need to receive a @mention notification (personal), i need to receive only notification according comment event. (i need to receive only 1 notification). Possible to deactivate the mention notifications, but the @ function must stay in comments exactly to choose users.\n\nIn third, i need to split comment event notification into 2,3 events, which sended to users setted with @ in comments. If user, which setted with @ in comments is already in my custom field (A) (user picker), i need to send the comment notification template A, or user which setted with @ in comments is already in my custom field (B) (user picker), i need to send the comment notification template B.

I just wanted to provide an update that in the near future we will be looking at these features and how we can improve them before bringing them to Next-gen projects. I will update this ticket when we start that body of work.\r\n\r\nPlease don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or feedback.\r\n\r\nRegards,\u2028\u2028\r\nNathan Sturgess\r\nnsturgess@atlassian.com\u2028\r\nProduct Manager, JIRA Platform\r\n\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\n*Original feature request:*\r\n\r\nThe on the fly creation makes it too easy to create unwanted items. This is especially true for components, which are typically created only rarely, so the extra steps are not a problem.

      "description": "{panel:bgColor=#e7f4fa}\n  *NOTE:* This bug report is for *JIRA Cloud*. Using *JIRA Server*? [See the corresponding bug report|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-42063].\n  {panel}\n\nHi,\n\nI am Atlassian Verified vendor and developer of a couple of JIRA add-ons.\nI am facing a strange error which bothers me and some of my customers more than a year. A customer raised a [support ticket|https://ecosystem.atlassian.net/browse/REL-6], and finally they told me to raise an issue here indicating the reproducing steps.\n\nCustomers are getting below exception when two plugins installed at the same time.\n{code}\nCaused by: org.springframework.beans.factory.NoSuchBeanDefinitionException: No unique bean of type [com.atlassian.jira.config.StatusManager] is defined: Unsatisfied dependency of type [interface com.atlassian.jira.config.StatusManager]: expected at least 1 matching bean\n{code}\n\nHere are the steps to reproduce problem :\n- Install JIRA\n- Install plugin  [Issue Alternative Assignee|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.iamhuy.jira.plugin.issue-alternative-assignee]\n- Install plugin [Time to SLA|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/plugin.tts]\n- Reboot JIRA\n- Create custom field \"Overdue Status\" which comes with Time to SLA\n- Go to configuration page of custom field (click actions icon, then select Configure in custom fields listing)\n- Click \"Edit Including SLAs\" link, Ooops 404, and the stack trace is attached at the bottom of this issue.\n\nFinally I found the root cause of the issue. Both plugins has class named {{EditConfiguration}} and they are both extending {{AbstractEditConfigurationItemAction}}\n\n{code}\nclass EditConfiguration extends AbstractEditConfigurationItemAction {\n ...\n}\n{code}\n\nWhen I change the class name to be any value except {{EditConfiguration}} it works.\n\nAs a work around I'm gonna change all class names, but I think it will be great to fix this problem in JIRA API because all tutorials are telling to use {{EditConfiguration}} class name :)\n\nHere is the whole stack trace:\n{code}\n[INFO] [talledLocalContainer] org.springframework.beans.factory.UnsatisfiedDependencyException: Error creating bean with name 'com.blahblah.EditConfiguration': Unsatisfied dependency expressed through constructor argument with index 1 of type [com.atlassian.jira.config.StatusManager]: : No unique bean of type [com.atlassian.jira.config.StatusManager] is defined: Unsatisfied dependency of type [interface

What I mean to suggest is, while writing either on a comment textbox or a description textbox, that my preferenced HEAD and FEET appears without having to write it by the user. \n\nSome Heads a user check as preferenced may be:\n- Morning,\n- Good morning,\n- Hi there,\n- Hi,\n- To whom it may concerns,\n\nAnd some Foot a user as preferenced may be:\n- Regards + my first name.\n- Best regards + my first name.\n\nSo, when a writer needs to communicate something he goes directly to what he wants to say. And the reader will just receive the communication in good mood.\n\nWhat do you think guys?\nPS: Both Heads and Feet should be written in accordance to user language.",

This makes it much easier to locate a branch, especially from a list of branches that share the same prefix (see screenshot \"Stash branch search\" from Stash 3.6.0). \n\nJIRA version search isn't similarly smart, so you must hit the search phrase from the very first character.
