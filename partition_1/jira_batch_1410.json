Even if the garbage collector does eventually run, FishEye doesn't fully recover, returning http 500 internal server errors.\r\n\r\nThe problem is documented in greater detail here:\r\n\r\nhttps://studio.atlassian.com/wiki/display/JST/FishEye+Performance+Issues\r\n\r\nWe will be trying JavaHL native libraries to see if we can solve some other performance issues, if that solves the file descriptor issue, then that will determine that it's an SVNKit problem.",
