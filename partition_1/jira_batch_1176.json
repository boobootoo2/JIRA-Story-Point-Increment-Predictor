If the image contained \"http\" within its base64 binary representation, JIRA would consider it a link and ignore it.\nOf course the chances of \"http\" appearing somewhere in the pasted image would go up when the image size goes up, and so this explains why this rarely occurred with smaller images.\n\nThank you for reporting this. Please let us know if you encounter more issues.\nCheers,\nMina\n{panel}\n\nh3. Summary\n\nNew attach screenshot CTRL +V keyboard shortcut doesn't work reliably in Firefox browser.\n\nh3.

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-45531].\n  {panel}\n\nUsing the workflow property \"jira.field.resolution.include\" (or \"jira.field.resolution.exclude\"), one can set up a transition that does not include the \"default resolution\" as defined at the system level.  This means whatever is first in the list shows up as the default selection.  For example, if a transition only includes \"Completed\", \"Abandoned\" and \"Duplicate\", we wind up with \"Duplicate\" as the pre-selected value.  For a system with \"Fixed\" as the system default, \"Completed\" would seem to be a more reasonable default selection.\n\nThere may be a workaround for some cases, but it would involve re-ordering the global list, which may be inappropriate or unwelcome in some environments.  It seems like, since we can restrict the list at the transition level, we should also be able to set the default at the same level... say, by adding \"jira.field.resolution.default\" as a property, with the expected value being the ID of one resolution.",

This is not consistent with the behavior of the simple Edit operation. When a a field is not part of the EDIT screen - it cannot be modified when the Edit button is clicked - it cannot be modified via the inline edit, but anything can be done via bulk. If a field is not part of the EDIT screen then it's because it's not supposed to be updated via any EDIT operation.\nJust to provide more detail: In certain Jira implementations, some fields are supposed to be modified only during particular transitions. These fields are not supposed to be edited via the edit operation. In order to accomplish this we add these fields in the VIEW screen (so anybody can see the content at any time), but we don't add the fields in the EDIT screen (so these fields cannot be update via the edit operation / inline edit). The fields are added only to screens that are displayed during the transitions when the fields are supposed to be modified.\nEverything works great but the problem is that if you perform a Bulk change (Edit Issues), everything can be modified, even the fields that were NOT supposed to be editable.\nIt would make sense to take into account the EDIT screen for all Edit operations, including Bulk Edit too.",

For example, if the field is multi-text then Enter key means new line, while if if it is a single-text field then it will submit the form. Similarly with single select list field Enter key means opening the drop down list, however with Label field it will submit the form. If the cursor is in the number field then it will submit the form same like in user picker.\n\nSince the behaviour of the key always changing depending on the field type, we are concerned that users will find it too confusing since they could inadvertently submit the form while trying to do something else. To make it more consistent can we take away the functionality to submit the form when pressing 'Enter' key in Edit/Transition screen?",

Sure, I can throw the URL of the confluence page in there, but I'd like my application link to be able to search confluence for the relevant doc.\n\nI'm sure I could perhaps also have a condition to check that there is a standard \"Linked Issue\" present but this field is likely to already be filled by links to IT & Infrastructure tickets.\n\nFor some context, this is an effort to improve IT/Infra documentation across our organisation. We have a JIRA Infrastructure Change Management project where risk assessments are written for IT/Infra changes which have various conditions and approval steps etc. We want it so that the last step is to create a Standard Operating Procedure document, without which, the JIRA task cannot be marked as resolved.\n\nThis could perhaps be done as an enhancement to the existing \"Multi Issue Selector\" custom field type, whereby there would be an additional context type of \"Confluence Link\".\n\nBob Swift would nail this in a flash, I'm sure.\n\n\n",
