How it is working right now\r\n\r\nIf I have a project called Angry Nerds with \"ANGRY\" as key, any commit message that has the word \"Angry\" will be brought up in the source tab for the project, even though there is no connection between them other then the word.\r\n\r\nAn example screenshot can be seen [here| https://confluence.atlassian.com/download/attachments/185729532/fisheye.png?version=2&modificationDate=1376304153908&api=v2]\r\n\r\nh5. Workaround\r\n\r\nAs a workaround you can set an entity link between the JIRA project and Fisheye repository/repositories, the project screen will only show commits from those projects then, this will allow content to be restricted to only 'approved' repositories.
