For more information - please check out our release notes at: http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/JIRA+4.3+Release+Notes.\r\n\r\nThanks for your patience, and feel free to contact us if you have feedback or questions for us.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nEdwin Wong\r\nJIRA Product Management\r\nedwin at atlassian dot com\r\n\r\n\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\nNOTE:  We have updated this description based upon our plans to improve the LDAP support in JIRA\r\n\r\nCurrently, JIRA's LDAP integration is limited to being able to check a user's password against that in a LDAP directory, as documented at\r\n\r\nhttp://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/docs/latest/ldap.html\r\n\r\nIf you're not aware, Confluence and Bamboo use atlassian-user, FishEye and Crucible have their own stack, and JIRA uses OSUser. Crowd's LDAP stack is different again. \r\n\r\nWe are going to put Crowd's LDAP stack into both JIRA and Confluence, and then into the rest of the products. This is a large amount of engineering, and in JIRA in particular, will affect a lot of the code. Much of the Crowd team will be helping out on this effort. The work will not be delivered in JIRA 4.0, but it will start as soon as 4.0 ships.  This issue has been assigned to the short term roadmap of JIRA to reflect this.",
