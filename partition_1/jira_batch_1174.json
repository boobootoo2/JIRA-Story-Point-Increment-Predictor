Problem Definition\n\tAs an admin I would like our users could reset the Filter Results gadget to its default filter ordering when the page is reloaded. Once we create this gadget and a user clicks to any column to sort, the default sort definded in the filter is gone and never comes back (since the user last columns sorting is saved).\n\nh3. Suggested Solution\n\tOptions to solve this problem:\n\t* A refresh of the gadgets page could reset the results in this gadget\n\t* A reset filter order option could be added to the gadget\n\t* The filter could have an option to block columns sorting\n \nh3. Workaround\n\tThe main field (used as the first field in the order by statement) used to order the filter results should always be presented as a column in the gadget. Once the user sorts the column with the correct field, the results will be sorted as defined in the filter.",

While some admins do this, some others might miss it and then only notice it when they run into issues.\n\n\nh3. Suggested Solution\nIf unsupported environment (example database) is being used, then JIRA installer should stop as soon as it detects that giving a clear message to the user something like :\n\"You are using an unsupported database.

Only if you use the \"edit\" window you can reduce the flood. This is not good for anybody.\n\nSuggestion:\n1. Provide an option for \"digest emails\" which is ON by default, as opposed to direct.\n2. Provide a few values for the delay: 1 and 10 minutes, and 1, 3, 6 and 12 hours.\n\nThe digest should be the \"diff\" between time 0 and 0+delay. Meaning: I change a bug assignee from Joe to myself, set it to In-Progress, and set back Joe as assignee ... the diff is from previous state to In-progress. It is not interesting to see the 3-step dance to be able to do that state change.\n\nThe digest should be per bug, not containing several bugs. If that is interesting it is another enhancement request, outside of the scope for this one.\n\nThe digest should probably not cover more than one user. Hence I guess the longer delays could be ignore and you only go for 1 and 10 minutes. Or even just 5 minutes.\n\nThe overall idea is to minimize the email flood for when updating one small things which must be done in several steps (such as when a non-assignee want to set a bug in-progress), or when updating a few small things, such as state, assignee, add-CC and maybe a comment, whereof all are logically just one batch.\n\nThanks in advance\nSimon\n",

The adminstrator should be able to acces the filter in the GUI and to share it.\n* People who leave the company do not delete their private filters and dashboards before they go. Over time, this relicts will pile up. Adminstrators should have the option to clear private filters and dashboards after a user has left.\n\nIt's not feasible to query the database to find out which private filters exist and who the owners are, and alter the database. \n\nFirst, functionalities in the GUI would be more convenient to use.\nSecond, you cannot assume that JIRA administrators have access to the database.

Also, inspection of our database reveals that the assignee and reporter are the same for 84% of our issues, i.e. 84% of the time it is better to automatically assign to the reporter than require them to manually assign to themselves. Clearly, the process that will best suit us is to have the reporter as the default assignee and allow users to assign to someone else if need be (which will be the minority of the time).\n\nCurrent workarounds:\n\n1) There is an \"assign to me\" button which is obviously pretty quick to press. However, the fact that the apparent solution also seems very straightforward means that this is something people find very frustrating. Additionally, it is open to people forgetting (we trust our team members but also accept that they make mistakes).\n\n2) A post function can be added to always assign to the current user. This is not great because it bulldozes over any actual selection the user makes (which will be very irritating 16% of the time for us) and is also not very visible/intuitive even when you do want it to happen (you have to leave the assignee field blank knowing that it is about to be assigned).\n\nProposal:\n\nAdd the option to make the reporter/current user the default assignee in a project.\n\nJustification:\n\nThis is a completely null change to anyone not making use of it, the only people who would even notice it would be project admins/leads, who would only be exposed to an extra option in a drop down if they decided to configure the default assignee (which they would probably only be doing if they want this feature!). Whereas people like myself will benefit 84% of the time that we are creating a JIRA issue.",

Summary\nIf permissions in the JIRA home / data directory isn't correct (i.e. belongs to root:root instead of js-jira:js-apps, in the case of Cloud), then the user won't be able to toggle Attachments on. Non system admins may not even see the Edit button, as you can see in this screenshot:\n\n!Screen Shot 2015-10-28 at 16.28.02.jpg|thumbnail!\n\nh3. Environment\n* JIRA 7.0.0-OD-08-002\n\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\n# Navigate to Attachment settings at {{domain.atlassian.net//secure/admin/ViewAttachmentSettings.jspa}}, and click *Edit Settings* and toggle off all attachment settings.\n# In the filesystem, break the permissions by recursively chowning the {{attachments/}} folder to root:root, for example. (Whatever would not give JIRA access to the files)\n\n{noformat}drwxr-xr-x  4 js-jira js-apps 4096 Jul 29 19:18 .\ndrwxr-xr-x 11 js-jira js-apps 4096 Oct 26 06:44 ..\ndrwxr-xr-x  4 root    root    4096 Oct  2 19:58 attachments\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 js-jira js-apps 4096 Oct 22 14:54 avatars{noformat}\n\nh3. Expected Results\n# In a proper save, the screen closes itself, and the changes are applied.\n# There should be some error saying the permissions are not correct, at least. Rather than not save.\n\nh3. Actual Results\n# Attempt to *Edit Settings* in the attachment settings again, this time enabling attachments. When you click *Update*, it will start to save, but return back to the same screen.\n# No errors in the JIRA log.\n\nh3. Workaround\nCorrect the permissions in both attachments and avatars folders recursively, so JIRA will have access to the files.\n\n*Cloud customers* please contact support to have this done.",

However, if the administrator has more tabs open (where he was logged with his admin account) and try to continue working as normal, he will get an error message instead of the pop-up window saying he's logged as a different user. The error says _\"An unknown error has occurred trying to contact our servers, please try again. If the issue persists please raise a ticket with support.\"_\n\nh3. Suggested Solution\nInstead of the error message, it would be nice to have some kind of warning message stating that you are logged in as another user and cannot perform your usual tasks, because you no longer have the same access.\n",

      "description": "{panel:bgColor=#e7f4fa}\n  *NOTE:* This bug report is for *JIRA Cloud*. Using *JIRA Server*? [See the corresponding bug report|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-45917].\n  {panel}\n\nh3. Summary\nAs part of JIRA Service Desk now, JIRA is storing the incoming mails in the database (done by the JEPP). Those are stored inside the *AO_2C4E5C_MAILITEMCHUNK* table.\n\nJIRA is, sometimes, silently failing to import or export the active objects part of the backup.\n\n\\\\\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\n# Install JIRA;\n# Import the backup linked on the private comments.\n# JIRA will stop importing once it reaches 90%. Restart JIRA.\n# Navigate to *Administration \u00bb System \u00bb Plugin Data Storage* and verify what has been imported.\n\n\\\\\nh3. Expected Results\nAll entries in the active objects table would have been imported/exported.\n\n\\\\\nh3. Actual Results\n* *Exporting:* JIRA creates the backup normally, but upon inspecting the {{activeobjects.xml}} file (using the grep below) not all entries are in the file.\n* *Importing:* JIRA fails to import the data once it reaches 90%, but after restarting JIRA it seems to have imported correctly. Inspecting the *Plugin Data Storage* shows most tables as empty, and inspecting the {{activeobjects}} file shows all data.\n\n(!) This seems to be happening because JIRA runs out of memory due to import, but fails to log any errors or warnings.\n\n\\\\\nh3. Notes\nTo verify the data inside the activeobjects.xml backup, run:\n{code}\ngrep -E  \"data tableName=|<row>\" activeobjects.xml | uniq -c\n{code}\nThis will show how many rows were exported for each table. For example, when JIRA failed to export correctly, this was shown:\n{noformat}\n      1   <data tableName=\"AO_21D670_WHITELIST_RULES\">\n      3     <row>\n      1   <data tableName=\"AO_2C4E5C_MAILCHANNEL\">\n      1     <row>\n      1   <data tableName=\"AO_2C4E5C_MAILCONNECTION\">\n      1     <row>\n      1   <data tableName=\"AO_2C4E5C_MAILGLOBALHANDLER\">\n      1   <data tableName=\"AO_2C4E5C_MAILHANDLER\">\n      5     <row>\n      1   <data tableName=\"AO_2C4E5C_MAILITEM\">\n   3625     <row>\n      1   <data tableName=\"AO_2C4E5C_MAILITEMAUDIT\">\n   3625     <row>\n      1   <data tableName=\"AO_2C4E5C_MAILITEMCHUNK\">\n    691     <row>\n{noformat}\nIt is possible to see what tables were (supposed to be) exported to the backup with:\n{noformat}\ngrep \"table name=\" activeobjects.xml\n{noformat}\n\n\\\\\nh3.Workaround\n\n*Follow our [Increasing JIRA Memory|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Increasing+JIRA+Memory] guide to increase the memory available to JIRA, restart JIRA and try to import/export the backup again.* If this doesn't work, please follow the instructions below:\n\n\\\\\n*For importing:*\nIt is possible to remove the affected lines from the backup with:\n# Run:\n{code}grep -En  \"data tableName=\" activeobjects.xml | grep -A1 \"MAILITEMCHUNK\" | cut -d\":\" -f1{code}\nThis will return two numbers.\n# use {{vim}} to open the activeobjects.xml and run:\n{code}\n:num1,num2s;<string>.*</string>;<string></string>;g\n{code}\nWhere num1 and num2 are the numbers returned in the first step. e.g.:\n{code}:45635,58649s;<string>.*</string>;<string></string>;g{code}\n# save and exit vim;\n# zip the backup again and import.\n\nThis will return the body of the emails that are stored.\n\n\\\\\n*To export:*\n# Turn off the Email Puller so that no new mail will be added to the database\n#* JIRA Administration > System > Global Mail Settings\n# Wait at least 5 minutes so that the mail processor is able to process mail that is already in the database\n# Stop JIRA;\n# Run the following update in the database to delete the mail items:\n#* Optional: backup this table using your database's native tools before running the update\n{code:SQL}\nUPDATE \"AO_2C4E5C_MAILITEMCHUNK\" SET \"MIME_MSG_CHUNK\" = NULL;\n{code}\n# Restart JIRA;\n# Export the data again.\n# Turn the Email Puller back on",

Summary\nThe @mention feature of JIRA is failing to find some users (mostly ones with names starting with the initial letter of the domain) because the javascript responsible for this feature performs a filter over the results of a query via a REST call which is limited to 10 results. The REST call returns users which match the query string (username parameter in the rest call) based on if it exists in EITHER the username, display name, or email address. Because normally the domain matches many users email address, searching for users starting with the initial letter of the domain, will be filtered out. \ne.g: mike@mydomain.com may be filtered out when searching for m if there are many more users with @mydomain.com email address and at least 10 users alphabetically before mike.\n\nh3. Environment\nAffected version: 7.0.0-OD-08\n\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\n# Create 11 users with the same domain email address. eg: @example.com\n# Name the first 10 users with Letters before e\n# Name the 11th user 'example'\n# Try to mention the user in a comment.\n\nh3. Expected Results\nIf you use the complete username, or display name, the user should always appear.\n\nh3. Actual Results\nUsing the complete username or display name, doesn't show the user because the rest api is returning 10 previous users (but not displaying them as options)\n\nh3. Notes\nWhen troubleshooting, take into consideration that you may need to refocus the comment box for the search to be done: [JRA-59304|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRA-59304]\n\nh3. Workaround\n*Partial workaround*\nTry with a different user value (if you tried with username, try display name, or last name). The last name value works particularly well as it is quite unique.\n\n*Confirmed workaround*\nTyping the first few characters of a user's name and hitting the {{TAB}} button will autocomplete and allow for the user to be mentioned (until you refresh the page) _e.g. John = Joh...{{TAB}}_",

Problem Definition\nAt the moment, upgrading JIRA using installer will perform the following:\n# Creating backup of the installation directory\n# Deleting the installation directory\n# Extracting the installer, and so on\n\nWhen extracting the installer, it will check the available memory space. If user does not have enough space, user is required to cancel the upgrading process half way. By doing so, the next time user tries to upgrade, he will lose the \"upgrade\" option, and will be presented with new installation instead, since the installation directory has been deleted during the initial attempt.\n\nh5. Suggested Solution\nJIRA should check the memory space available before proceeding with the upgrading process (deleting the installation directory, and so on)",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-45820].\n  {panel}\n\nAfter a recent issue with upgrading JIRA (where older Java version was not supported anymore), I was surprised that the JIRA installer did not check for prerequisites during installation (I am talking about Windows installer upgrading an existing installation). It's my fault completely for failing to read the supported platforms page at all, but nevertheless it would still be nice to prevent people from shooting themselves in the foot (and possibly reducing number of support requests in the long run).\n\nThere are at least two places I can think of where a \"fail fast\" approach would be of more help:\n\n1. JIRA Installer should check which Java version is installed and fail if it is not supported.\n2. Batch scripts for the JIRA service installation should *not* try to guess the JIRA path, but instead fail immediately if {{JRE_HOME}} and {{JAVA_HOME}} are not defined. Otherwise it's easy to get the incorrect Java instance running for the Tomcat service, even though there are no warnings during installation. Right now the script checks {{JRE_HOME}}, then {{JAVA_HOME}} and then defaults to a bundled JRE installation (and the resulting folder looks \"funny\" like described [here|https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/31662205/answers/31663637]).\n\nFinally, docs on configuring {{JAVA_HOME}} should be clarified to remove ambiguities. All over the Atlassian site, it's suggested to define {{JAVA_HOME}} to point to Java *JRE* folder. On the other hand, if you install Bamboo, it requires that {{JAVA_HOME}} is pointing to Java *JDK*. Even the batch script which installs JIRA as a service first checks if {{JRE_HOME}} is defined, instead of {{JAVA_HOME}}.\n\nIt seems a correct setup would be:\n- {{JAVA_HOME}} - points to JDK (needed for Bamboo, and not needed at all if you are only running JIRA),\n- {{JRE_HOME}} - points to JRE (also including the bundled JRE)\n- service scripts checks if they are indeed pointing to correct folders and fails as soon as one of these variables is configured incorrectly.",
