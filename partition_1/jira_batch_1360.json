Problem Definition\r\nWhen migrating to a new database, the migration fails because Fisheye tries to migrate all tables starting with {{cwd_}} and {{cru_}}.\r\n\r\nIn case a non expected tables exists in the schema (e.g. due to a previous failed migration), the migration fails with a database error.\r\nFor example, when using an Oracle database the following error is reported:\r\n{noformat}\r\nORA-00942: table or view does not exist\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nMigrating to a new database is commonly used in the attempt to move Fisheye to a database containing only and all the expected structure.\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n\r\n1. Database migration should migrate only the expected tables to the new database.\r\n2. Backup should dump only the expected tables to the new database.\r\n3. Add system startup health check - do not start Fisheye/Crucible if unknown cru_* and cwd_* tables are detected and print warning about it.\r\n4. Extend our upgrade guide - add section how not to make db restore to avoid this corruption.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n(!) Direct database modifications are not supported. \r\nReach out to the Atlassian Support prior to modifying the database for further details on how to proceed if you are facing this issue.",

Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n* Set up Crowd as follows\r\n** Add Fisheye/Crucible application\r\n** Add 'Crowd internal' directory\r\n*** Add 'fisheye-crucible-users' group\r\n*** Add 'user1' user, do not assign to the group above\r\n** On the 'Options' tab pick the 'fisheye-crucible-users' group to be automatically added to\r\n\r\n* Set up Fisheye/Crucible as follows\r\n** Add 'Atlassian Crowd' directory\r\n** On the 'Groups' page remove 'fisheye-users' and 'crucible-users' groups; you shall see the 'fisheye-crucible-users' listed\r\n** On the 'Global Permissions' page grant 'fisheye-crucible-users' group the 'Fisheye & Crucible access' \r\n** On the 'Users' page you shall see 'user1'; it has no group assigned and the 'no access' red label\r\n\r\n* Log out and log in as 'user1'\r\n** Login fails (!)\r\n\r\n* Log in as administrator\r\n** On the 'Users' page you shall see that 'user1' is now a member of 'fisheye-crucible-users' group, \r\n** but the label still shows 'no access' (!)\r\n\r\n\r\nh2.

It does not offer an option for upgrading an existing instance, such as Jira and Bitbucket Server installers do.\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\nThe installer should show two options in its first step:\r\n* one for installing a fresh instance\r\n* the other for upgrading an existing instance\r\n\r\nIf the option for upgrading an existing instance is chosen, the installer should:\r\n* uninstall the previous instance\r\n* uninstall its Windows / Linux service (if applicable) or update it because the installation directory might change\r\n* in one of the next steps it should ask the user to select the directory used as {{FISHEYE_INST}} by the old instance if it cannot be detected automatically from environment variables.\r\n\r\nh3.
