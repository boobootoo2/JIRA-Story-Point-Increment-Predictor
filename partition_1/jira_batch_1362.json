      "description": "FishEye/Crucible is unable to show a diff for binary files (even for images which it can otherwise properly display). Given this situation it is practically useless to have binary files in ones repositories. Especially if the repo contains many binary files, these may bloat the index files and it seems to me that FishEye creates an own copy of every version of every one of them, which can also be huge.\r\n\r\nSo my suggestion is to create an option for excluding all binary files from repositories. The best place for this in my opinion is the _Include/Exclude_ settings page.\r\n\r\nA workaround for this of course (and this is what we are doing) is to create a bunch of exclude rules like\r\n{code:java}\r\n/**/*.png\r\n/**/*.jpg\r\n{code}\r\netc. to exclude our binary files by extension. But it would be nice not to have some dozen of exclude rules but a simple checkbox instead.",

Problem Definition\r\n\r\nCurrently when indexing a partial repository (for example using a *Start Revision* for SVN) lines created in revisions prior to the first indexed commit are attributed to \"No author\". This causes the LOC reports and charts to be skewed when you are looking for metrics from the first indexed revision onward.\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nAdd a check box with the title \"Exclude 'No Author'\" which will filter out LOC attributed to \"no Author\". It would be a toggle so that the report builder would still be able to see the relative amounts of new commits versus those that came before the first indexed commit.\r\nh3. Workaround #1\r\n\r\nThere is an easy workaround to filter out \"No author\" committer from LoC charts:\r\n\r\nuse Author(s) filter to select multiple committers excluding \"No author\"\r\nSee screenshot for details:\r\n\r\n!screenshot-1.png|thumbnail!\r\nh3.

Investigation\r\nSeems like the problem is caused by project's default repository being disabled.  This problematic CR-CIP project seem to not have default repository set (project admin page https://fisheye.dev.internal.atlassian.com/admin/editProject.do?id=7 shows first available repository in default repository), FishEye content for this repository is empty as well https://fisheye.dev.internal.atlassian.com/admin/viewFisheyeProject.do?id=7.\r\nBut when I enable \"clov-svn-old\" repository (it was disabled before), apparently activity stream displays only its commits, as expected.   In project admin page I can see \"clov-svn-old\" repository as default one.\r\n\r\nh2. Diagnosis\r\nSeems like project activity page doesn't cope well with default project's repository being disabled.  Rather than falling down into showing activity of all FishEye repositories it should show no commits at all in such case.\r\nProject admin page should indicate default project repository is disabled.\r\n\r\nh2. note\r\nVery likely the same would happen when default project's repository is deleted, to be verified.",

Expected Results - 1\r\nThe value visible in JIRA in the custom field, e.g. \"Green\", is also visible in the modal window.\r\n !screenshot-1.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\nh3.

      "description": "h1. Asynchronous global permission cache loading\r\nh4. Loading cache in the\u00a0background\r\n\r\nIn the default setup, the global permission cache is created synchronously. i.e. all web requests are blocked until cache is rebuilt. As this operation might take minutes, we came up with a mechanism that keeps using the old cache while the new one is being loaded in the background and replaces the old one only once the new one is ready.\r\n\r\nFirst loading of the cache will still be blocking, because there's no old value to use.\r\nh4. Disadvantages\r\n\r\nBecause the old cache is still used after an invalidation event has come, it means that changes to permission settings (FishEye/Crucible access, \"can add repository\" permission) are delayed. The greatest disadvantage is that users whose access has been revoked can still access FishEye until the cache is rebuilt.\r\nh4. When to use\r\n\r\nThe asynchronous global permission cache loading should only be used when the application often becomes unresponsive due to long running global permission cache reloading.\r\nh4. Enabling global permission cache reloading\r\n\r\nSet [JVM system property|https://confluence.atlassian.com/fisheye/jvm-system-properties-298976942.html] to enable asynchronous global permission cache loading:\r\n{noformat}\r\nfisheye.use.async.global.permission.cache=true{noformat}\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n----\r\nh1. Original ticket description\r\nh3. Summary\r\n\r\nWhen the instance has huge user base, ie. 100,000 users, FishEye is unresponsive due to Global Permissions cache recreation.\r\n This may take couple minutes to finish, while any http request is not able to load (As they have\u00a0to wait for Global Permissions cache to be recreated).\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Connect FishEye to one or more directory with a significant number of users\r\n ## The synchronization of each directory will happen every hour\r\n ## After the synchronization of each directory, if there is at least one change, the Global Permissions cache will be recreated\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nThe recreation of the Global Permissions cache does not impact the FishEye performances and the user interface is always responsive.\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nWhen checking the time required for the creation of the global permission cache, high values are reported.\r\n In the following example, the recreation of the cache took {{202192}} milliseconds (~ 3 minutes):\r\n{noformat}\r\nDEBUG [qtp787122337-77080 ] fisheye Timer-output - -> Loading global permission cache mem_usage = 2655336032 heapsize = 3533176832 freemem = 877840800\r\nDEBUG [qtp787122337-77080 ] fisheye Timer-output - <- Loading global permission cache  time 202192 millis mem_usage = 2427321272 heapsize = 3300917248 freemem = 873595976\r\n{noformat}\r\nDuring this time all http requests will be be queued.\r\nh3. Notes\r\n\r\nThe number of users can be checked via the repository by running the following query on FishEye 4.0+:\r\n{noformat}\r\nselect directory_id, count(directory_id)\r\nfrom cwd_user\r\ngroup by directory_id\r\n{noformat}\r\nh2. Workaround\r\n\r\nAt the moment FishEye/Crucible will struggle to cope with such large user bases assuming all of them need access to FishEye/Crucible. \u00a0But\u00a0if you don't expect all those users to use FishEye/Crucible and can narrow them down, consider\u00a0following workaround:\r\n # create in remote directory group of set of groups that would together contain all the users\u00a0expected to have access to FishEye/Crucible, if such group(s) don't exist yet\r\n # if remote directory can be configured to return only subset of users (e.g. Atlassian Crowd), configure it so FishEye/Crucible will synchronise only those groups\r\n # or configure appropriate filters in User Directories administration of FishEye/Crucible to synchronise only those groups\r\n\r\n\u00a0",

      "description": "h3. Summary\r\nThis is a follow up to FE-6201.\r\n\r\nAccording to [this comment|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/FE-6201?focusedCommentId=832030&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-832030], the smart commit transition command is supposed to only work with the user's preferred language. For example, if JIRA language is set to Chinese language, users will need to use transition name in Chinese language in order for the smart commit to work. However, this does not work.\r\n\r\nIt is likely that the regex to filter out the smart commit commands never worked for special characters in the first place, so any languages that use non-English characters will cause the smart commit to fail.\r\n\r\nBasically, when JIRA is set to a language other than English and that language has special characters (such as Chinese), BOTH English/Chinese smart commit messages will not work.\r\n\r\nh3. Environment\r\nFishEye 3.9.0\r\nJIRA 7.1.9\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Create an Application Links from JIRA to FishEye.\r\n# Change to Chinese language via JIRA user profile/global configuration\r\n# Create a new ticket from JIRA ie: TES-1\r\n# Enable FishEye smart commits\r\n# Add a commit message, ie: \"TES-1 #\u5b8c\u6210 #COMMENT 026\" (\u5b8c\u6210 = Done)\r\n# The issue will not transition to \u5b8c\u6210, but the comment will still be added to the ticket.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nIssue should transition to \u5b8c\u6210 and comment is added.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nIssue does not transition to \u5b8c\u6210, but the comment is added.\r\n \r\nh3.

Either fix the regex, or give users an option to use English in smart commits regardless of what their preferred language is in JIRA.\r\n\r\nh3.Workaround\r\nNo workaround, unless JIRA admin manually removes the JIRA workflow transition translation from the language pack to allow users to commit in English.",
