And the same is true for \"Created By\" to \"Reporter\" But Jira assumes 3 things that are not correct!\n# usernames are simply the spaceless concatenation of real names (how many of your customers use \"employee IDs\" that have nothing to do with name?)\n# emails _always_ follow a LASTNAMEf@domain.com pattern where 'f' is the first initial of first name (what about first.last, or fLAST, or f.last ?)\n# if these assumptions don't line up, it must be a new user (but in reality our jira is connected to our enterprise ldap and knows _all_ users !)\n\nSO my suggestion pretty simple:\n\nPlease allow the import the option of *looking up users* based on imported username/real name/email, and select the field to search by.  I could then very easily tell Jira to lookup users by the \"User Name Contains\", \"Full Name Contains:\" or \"Email Contains\"  and pull back a valid user ID, Email, and Real name.\n\nI would much rather this then have to write a macro to update my csv file replacing \"last, first\" with \"employeeID\".",

Usage Scenario\n\nIf a development team would like to compare or measure how many fixes were released before the scheduled due date, it would be great to be able to create a report that compares using JQL:\n{code}\nreleasedate < \"due date\"\n{code}\n\nh5. Existing Behavior\n\nJIRA would throw an error if you attempt to use the JQL as defined above as it would expect you to use the duration or actual date as described in the summary section.\n\nh5.

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-64396].\n  {panel}\n\nh3. Problem Definition\n\nAccording to the [JIRA REST API|https://docs.atlassian.com/jira/REST/7.3.3] documentation, {{POST /rest/api/2/user}} can be used to create a new user, and that user will be created in the first writable directory in directory order for the application making the request. \n\nh3. Suggested Solution\n\nAs an improvement, we could allow the ability to specify a directory when adding users. This could make the process more transparent and give the administrator more control by taking out the element of chance, in the event the administrator is unaware of the directories mapped to an application and the order they're in.
