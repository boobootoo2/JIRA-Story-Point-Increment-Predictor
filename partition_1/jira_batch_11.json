      "description": "h2. My need\r\n\r\nI work on a very large project that uses more than 50 repositories.\r\n\r\nIt's not uncommon for us to have some large features that require making changes to 10+ repositories by the same developer. In such case, I find it easier to name the feature branch after the release that we are tracking in JIRA. In some other cases, I just a bug fix that requires changing several repos.\r\n\r\nSometimes, if many of these changes are - for instance - in PHP, I can attach the corresponding repos in a single workspace. But if the changes are spread across disparate technologies (PHP, the Java backend, the iOS and Android apps), then each one will be dealt with in a more suitable development environment.\r\n\r\nThe issues (human errors) start surfacing when it's time to merge everything and get ready for deployment. It's very easy to loose track of which repo has been changed. Especially if we have been working on a feature for weeks.\r\n\r\nA temporary solution I have found was to write a small single line Bash script that scans my projects base folder and shows the name of the repositories that have a branch that matches a search key that I provided. For instance, I could search for \"the-next-big-thing\". That, of course, needed to be a checked out branch, but I have adjusted it to find the branch even if it's not checked out. The result is a nice list of things that need to be deployed in relation with the project or the release called \"the-next-big-thing\".\r\nh2. The feature request\r\n\r\nI was thinking that it might be possible to use the search feature in SourceTree's\u00a0 \"Local repositories\" to find the same information. At the very least, it could be useful to find a using the repo's name, the current branch name, and the repo's path.\r\n\r\nI can provide the script I have created if it can show you a proof of concept.\r\n\r\nI have attached an screen capture of the screen I am referring to.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n!image-2019-04-24-14-50-47-831.png!",

(MergeBranch1.png, MergeBranch2.png)\r\n\r\nAs a followup, after this, any merges involving these branches, will forever also show that file as part of the merge.

      "description": "SourceTree's history view has a log view in the top half and a commit view and a file view in the bottom half. The vertical dividing line between the commit details view and the file details view can be easily moved by clicking and dragging. However, the horizontal dividing line between the log view on the upper half and the two views on the bottom half cannot be moved in some situations.\r\n\r\nWhen the SourceTree window is maximized and a file is selected in the commit view (and therefore shows up in the file view), you can try to click and drag the central horizontal dividing line but it won't move. It seems to be impossible in most cases to deselect a file, but it can be done if \"Uncommitted changes\" is the selected commit and you stage or unstage a file. Once the file is deselected you can resize the bottom panel. Then once you select another commit and a file automatically becomes selected then some more strange behavior can be observed.\r\n\r\nAfter the central horizontal dividing line has been moved with no files selected, then you can move it when a file is selected but it only moves down to a certain limit. It moves as though there's a limit to how small the bottom panel can get. If you drag past that limit then the panel snaps back to the size it was before you started resizing.\r\n\r\nRepro steps:\r\n # Open a repo with many commits and at least one uncommitted change in SourceTree\r\n # In the log view in the upper half, select a commit\r\n # Try to move the central horizontal dividing line between the upper half and the lower half\r\n # Observe faulty behavior #1 (the line will not move)\r\n # In the log view in the upper half, select \"Uncommitted changes\"\r\n # If a file is selected, stage or unstage it to deselect it\r\n # Click and drag the\u00a0central horizontal dividing line between the upper half and the lower half upwards so that the bottom panel becomes large\r\n # Select a commit\r\n # Try to move the central horizontal dividing line between the upper half and the lower half downwards so that the bottom panel becomes small\r\n # Observe faulty behavior #2 (the line will snap back into place when you drag down too far)",

The issue also happens if I have uncommited files and I select a commit in the history. It seems that attempting to show a git history diff hangs sourcetree. As far as I can tell, no git process is active in the background, the main UI thread uses 100% CPU usage and the callstack is deep into UI related code.\r\n\r\nI let it run for 20-30mins and it never appears to recover.
