Executing it on the jelly runner only produces the message that the script ran successfully.\n\nProblems that we identified:\n- the script does not add groups or users to the project roles;\n- it does not return any errors if the user, group or ID of the role does not exist;\n- trying to add a user which belongs only to the jira-users group to the JIRA Administrators project role does not add it (and checking in the roles in the UI does not show the user entered);\n- trying to add a user which belongs only to the jira-users group to the JIRA Users project role does not add the user when browsing via UI, but using the Jelly *GetDefaultRoleActors* returns correctly the user. Restarting the instance does not change this behaviour;\n- changing to DEBUG level the logging of *jelly* does not produces any errors in the logs;\n\nSo, is this jelly supposed to be working like this? Is there any hidden usage to it?\n\nBest Regards\nThiago Prisco\nAtlassian Support",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-26022].\n  {panel}\n\nI wanted to share some feedback on JIRA especially as it relates to how we're prioritizing work between the Business and our IS department. I've set up a filter that pulls a view together from multiple projects that each have many tasks.\n\nAmong those projects we have an overall business priority and it would be awesome if I could edit that business priority directly in the table view provided in the above filter. I'm looking for a process like 1) Click on a cell to edit, 2) Make changes and hit enter to save, and records re-order based on sorting set. \n\nRight now the process is more like 1) Ctrl+Click a task to open it in a new tab from the filter view, 2) Click the edit link on left, 3) Change business priority, 4) Hit save button, 5) Close new tab, 6) Continue editing the filter view or hit refresh to see changes.\n\nIt seems like this would be a much easier way to enter data across multiple projects.\n\nThanks much, -Matt\n",

The symptom is that the content does not get retrieved since _gadget.showView(true);_ in line 166 _ajs.gadget.factory.js_ (_com.atlassian.gadgets:atlassian-gadgets-publisher-plugin:3.1.9_) does not result in an invocation of the showView method being inherited from the Configured -> Standard constructor from _ajs.gadget.standard.js_ (same plugin) line 172. I do not understand why this is not happening, if I debug into that line showView references the function defined in the standard class, but if I step into it is not executed. The problem has to do with the check before, I just don't see why.\n\nAfter changing (_ajs.gadget.factory.js_ line 165-167)\n{code}\nif (gadget.getPrefs().getBool(\"isConfigured\")) {\n    gadget.showView(true);\n}\n{code}\nto\n{code}\nif (true) {\n    gadget.showView(true);\n}\n{code}\n\nshowView evaluates. Don't get me wrong here, _gadget.getPrefs().getBool(\"isConfigured\")_ evaluated to true before and I was on the _gadget.showView(true);_ line. \n\nAfter changing this I see a loading bar but no content is displayed. The content retrieval and insertion code from _assigned-to-me-gadget.xml_ (_com.atlassian.jira:jira-gadgets-plugin:4.4.1-studio-rc2_) is executed and the DOM is enriched with the content, but the problem is that the following style from ajs-gadgets.css line 85 (_com.atlassian.jira:jira-gadgets-plugin:4.4.1-studio-rc2_) moving the content out of the canvas (until some sort of \"ready for view\" state is reached I guess) is never removed.\n\n{code}\nbody.loading .gadget, body.config-active.loading .gadget, body.loading #config, body.config-active.loading #config {\n    left: -9999px;\n    position: absolute;\n    width: 100%;\n}\n{code}\n\nIf I remove the _left: -9999px;_ instruction I can see the content. This is not a Studio specific issue, I was able to reproduce the behaviour with a vanilla JIRA and Confluence instance of the same versions. All data indicates the problem originating in the jira-gadgets-plugin so far, also I'm unsure about why showView is not executed and if this could be a problem in the atlassian-gadgets-publisher-plugin. I've also tested the Introduction gadget which showed the same symptoms, so this might be an issue with all gadgets provided by the jira-gadgets-plugin.\n",

After clicking 'add' the view is returned back to 'edit permission scheme' screen, scroll position being at top of the page (a minor annoyance, it could return to same scroll position as when the 'add' was clicked). Then you need to do the cycle again for adding the permission for project lead, current assignee and once for all the 3 groups.\n\n\nCould it be possible to make an improvement, where you could use checkboxes (instead of radio buttons) in screen 'Permission Schemes' > 'Add New Permission' to be able to select multiple options at once.\n Also changing the single select menus (atleast the group menu) into a multi select menus would be helpful.\n\n(See the attachment)\n\nI understand there already is a similar request, but I thought I could provide a bit more information by creating a new one.\nJRA-1390 << The related issue",

This is consistent with the behavior we have seen here (those without the edit issue permission cannot add/edit/remove labels).\n\nThank you,\n\nCasey\n",

I have an LDAP user directory in both application that is linked to our Windows Domain Controller with Active Directory. Almost all of our user management is supported by Active Directory, but it is a clunky process to have to update Active Directory, and then go request a Synchronization in JIRA/Confluence.\n\nIs there a way to push a directory sync request from our Active Directory server to our JIRA/Confluence instances that are hosted on another server? Ideally, changes could be automatically pushed from active directory to JIRA/Confluence, but I realize that is a huge effort. So, a good alternative would be to have a command-line (or something of the sort) that I could run on our Active Directory server after I am done making changes, that would push an immediate sync request over to JIRA and Confluence. I looked through the XML RPC services for JIRA, but didn't find anything that I could use to request a directory synchronization.\n{quote}",

However, once you create them in the diretories, you cannot change this setting anymore. \n\nBy implementing this, the users can easily solve almost any problem that might've occured during an upgrade, as well giving them the oportunity to change this setting on runtime, instead of having to do the upgrade again, or via database hacks.\n\nCheers\nThiago Prisco",

Description\n\nOn the View Issue screen, the Workflow button is disabled unless the maximum number of workflow items has been exceeded.\n\nHowever, if the maximum is exceeded by one, the Workflow button only has one menu option.\n\nInstead of showing the Workflow button if there is only one option, just show the extra option.  \n\nI realize this has a few extra implications:\n\n* Should the Workflow button just be hidden instead of disabled when it is not in use?\n* What should the max actually represent?  Max buttons including the workflow button?\n\nh3. Example\n\n*In current scenario*, given transitions of Start, Resolve, Close, Confirm for a given status and a Max workflow buttons of 3, you would get:\n\n|Start|Resolve|Close|Workflow \\\\ Confirm|\n\n*In the suggested scenario*, given the transitions of Start, Resolve, Close, Confirm for a given status and a Max workflow buttons of 3 you would get:\n\n|Start|Resolve|Workflow \\\\ Close \\\\Confirm|\n\nbut a Max workflow buttons of 4 you would get:\n\n|Start|Resolve|Close|Confirm|\n\nh3. The Benefits\n\nThe benefits would be:\n* No wasted space when Workflow button not needed (because it would be hidden)\n* No extra click when only one menu item\n\nh3. Extrapolate\n\nThis obviously could be applied to Action buttons (though I don't know if I've ever seen the action list small enough to not need the \"More Actions\" button) and any other place this menu concept is used.\n",

The only workaround is to make the comment as a wiki comment, or encapsulate the comment (using \\{code} for instance).\n\nIs there any plans to make the automatic issue liking optional, and switcheable?\n\nCheers\n\nThiago Prisco",

      "description": "When using the agile functionality (Greenhopper) it is common to have versions for one or more backlogs which do not normally have a release date assigned to them. I have written up a small example below and will attach a screenshot of a current project.\n\n!backlog_version_example.jpg|align=right,thumbnail!\n* Product Backlog [No Date]\n** Approved Backlog [No Date]\n** Wishlist [No Date]\n\n* Sprint [Release Date]\n** Iteration [Release Date]\n** Iteration [Release Date]\n\nWhen using a JQL function like [earliestUnreleasedVersion()|http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Advanced+Searching#AdvancedSearching-earliestUnreleasedVersion] it pulls back the \"Product Backlog\" in my example. What I would like is to be able to either set a parameter in the current JQL function or add a new JQL function to limit it down where dates are defined. Examples would include:\n\n{code}\nearliestUnreleasedVersion(PROJECT,hasReleaseDate)\n{code}\n\nOR\n\n{code}\nfixVersion in earliestUnreleasedVersion(PROJECT) AND fixVersion in scheduledVersions()\n{code}\n\nOR \n\n{code}\nfixVersion in earliestScheduledUnreleasedVersion(PROJECT)\n{code}\n\nIf one of these options are possible then when running a JQL query for [wall boards|https://plugins.atlassian.com/plugin/details/23983] or Greenhopper [rapid boards|http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/GH/Using+the+Rapid+Board] it would pull the earliest version with a release date, removing any problems with Product Backlogs.\n\nNOTE: I have tried putting the release date way out in the future, but then the backlogs sort at the bottom of the lists. With the product owners being the least failure with JIRA, they tend to loose the backogs if they are not at the top of the versions in the planning board. \n\nSimilar functionality was requested in JRA-22549. I have also spent some time looking at the [Versions Functions|https://studio.plugins.atlassian.com/wiki/display/JQLT/Versions+Functions] of the [JQL Tricks Plugin|http://www.j-tricks.com/jql-tricks-plugin.html], but it does not have the functionality requested.

It's nice to have expand/collapse to save on scrolling, but it would be even nicer to see just a bit of the fields' contents as it's sometimes enough to get an idea what's in it.\nWhat do you think ?\n\nThanks,\nCristian",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-25898].\n  {panel}\n\nThis specifically applies to Customfield Type containing multiple fields.\n\nI've attached the Custom field plugin that helps user to store multiple addresses as part of Issue. Will take that as example to explain the problem. Please do use\n\n-> Each address is consists of Street, City and Zip code. All are three individual text fields. \n-> Using searcher (ExactAddressSearcher) available I can search on complete address. That's good till there.\n\nHere are couple of issues that will use as reference:\n\nIssue Number | Street | City | Zip Code\n--------------------------------------------------\nIssue 1 | Tasman | San Jose | 94533\nIssue 1 | Manning St. | Santa Clara | 34343\nIssue 2 | Cricket St  | Sydney | 11132\nIssue 2 | Brooks Blvd | Tasman | 22343\n\nNow if I search for \"San Jose\" I will get correct issue (issue 1).\n\nLet's say that I just want to search for all issues with with street name = \"Tasman\". Expectation is I should get only \"Issue 1\" in result. But I will get both issues in search result, this is because Tasman is available in both issues as part of Street or City name.\n\nAnd currently (as per my understanding) JIRA doesn't provide any way to do search on sub fields. \n\nCan you please add this functionality or help us to find out if there is any work around.\n\nthanks,\nRaju",

The only place it appears to be displayed in on the screen where you actually create the roles.\n\nIn JIRA 3, the role description was display with the role right on the assignment screen. This was extremely helpful since the description could include guidance on how to use that role. Individual project lead may well not remember the details of each role, so have the text to use as guidance was very helpful.  If space is an issue having it come up in as a mouse over balloon or something of that sort would be an acceptable option, as long as it was obvious that mouse over spot was their (many in jira are not obvious).",
