Summary\r\nSimilar to the behavior described in [JSWSERVER-19785|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSWSERVER-19785] where you are creating an issue in an epic the option for Epic is listed in the create dialogue but selecting the Epic fails as you cannot link an epic to an epic.   However in this scenario the initiative hierarchy levels (the level above an epic per portfolio hierarchy configurations) is also listed in the create dialogue as an option to be created as the level below the epic, but contrary to the Epic behavior the Initiative can be mapped to the Epic as the parent, in turn causing additional errors such as the BUG [JPOSERVER-2691|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JPOSERVER-2691] as a conflict occurs because the initiative cannot be both the parent and child of an Epic at the same time\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# make sure a hierarchical level above epic exists (initiative)\r\n# Navigate to an existing Epic\r\n# Use the \"Create issue in epic\" option\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nOnly standard issue types that are not mapped to an initiative hierarchy are listed in the issue type field. \r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nThe Initiative issue types are listed as avaliable issue types, along with Epic, and the Initiative can be selected and created as a child of the Epic\r\n \r\nh3. Notes\r\nAs the Initiative is considered a standard issue type but mapped to the higher hierarchy levels by portfolio the mappings would be possible if Portfolio was disabled, so an additional Expectation could be that a warning or error would occur when a initiative issue type is selected noting the issue types are invalid because of hierarchy configurations\r\n\r\nh3.Workaround\r\nYou can use the following JQL to identify issue in this state:\r\n{code}\r\nissuetype = \"initiative\"  AND \"Epic Link\" is not EMPTY \r\n{code}\r\nperform Bulk Update to remove the Epic link",

A Very Common Scenario: If a Program Manager has a pivot in their Tetris planning and decided they need to remove items from their Tetris board... they can then select one or more issues and perform \"Bulk action\" to \"Remove from plan\", then there should be an immediate triggered action to remove any values from the Target Start and Target End fields.\r\n\r\nThis is important because we will be running queries on existing Portfolio Plans based on filled in Target dates... this will be part of the various imports we will be used for scheduling and resource management. It is vital we are not pulling in issues into our queries that are not on Portfolio Plans but are showing up because they have fields filled for Target Start / End. The route of asking Program Managers to delete Target dates prior to removing them from Plans is less than ideal and would impact adoptability.",
