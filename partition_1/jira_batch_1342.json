Your feedback is key to helping us understand how you use JIRA so we can continue improving your experience. We have reviewed this issue over the last few days; however there are not currently any plans to implement this suggestion.\n\nWhen we released JIRA 6 with support for renaming users, we considered this feature as well as our team was focused on managing the issues with users in JIRA and external directories; however, we elected not to delay the release of JIRA 6 by implementing it. \n\nSince this request was first created, user management in JIRA has become much more complex. Many of our  customers use LDAP directories, integrate JIRA with Google Apps, and in the future will connect other SSO providers via SAML (ID-80). Therefore, we will need to re-evaluate the best way to support this at our next opportunity.\n\nPlease remember that jira.atlassian.com is one of many inputs for the JIRA roadmap. You can [learn more about our process here|https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/110373/how-does-the-jira-team-use-jira-atlassian-com].\n \nI understand that our decision may be disappointing. Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.\n \nRegards,\nDave Meyer\ndmeyer@atlassian.com\nProduct Manager, JIRA Platform\n{panel}\n\n*Original request description:*\n \nAs a JIRA administrator I am responsible for managing a large installation with multiple users and groups. Given the dynamic nature of my environment it is very difficult for me to create the correct user group name which can be used for many projects later on. I need to be able to rename the user groups, to reflect the changes my organisation undergoes.",

[See the corresponding bug report|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-61946].\n  {panel}\n\n*Background* \nThe JIRA username field has different valid characters than the email field. This creates an unfriendly situation when you add a customer in JSD. When you invite/add a new customer to JSD from the customers page, JSD creates the user using the email address as a username. If you invite/add the new customer from User Management, you can choose a different username.\n\n*Scenario*\n1. In JSD project Customers page, Agent invites/adds customer using an email address that contains characters that are not valid in the username field (e.g. &). JSD tries to use the email address as the username, and can't because the username field does not allow &.\n2. Dialog throws the following err: Email address contains characters that aren\u2019t valid in the username. Add the user, then use the username to add the user to the project. (Add the user is a CTA to User Management)\n3. User has to go to UM, add the user, then go back to the project & invite the user using the username instead of the email.\n\nThis is confusing & also a pain because you have to leave your task, to go UM, then go back to your task.\n\n",
