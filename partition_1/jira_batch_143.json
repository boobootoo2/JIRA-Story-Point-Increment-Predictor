When accepting a pull request from a forked branch, the branch is then closed which is correct. The problem is that the ref to the branch no longer exists, so pushing/pulling is just failing. We need some way of detecting whether the remote branch exists anymore and perhaps offer the option to the user to delete the branch and switch back to master?\r\n\r\nI assume this has been raised before. The easy solution is to just switch branches and delete the old branch, but it'd be nice if on a pull it gets deleted for the user automatically and giving some nice message to say the pull request was accepted and the branch was closed. We could do some API integrations to make this work, need to take a look into it though.",

So ideally I would like that these settings are somehow synchronised between machines (maybe using Dropbox?).

The merge commit is often unnecessary and a symptom of avoiding an \"unsafe\" rebase operation. However, the rebase is only \"unsafe\" if certain constraints can't be met, and these constraints can be checked programmatically.\r\n\r\nI think there is opportunity to remove a needless choice and complexity from the end-user here, and avoid unnecessary git history clutter in the process.\r\n\r\nThere's an extension to Git's command-line tools called \"[Git Smart|https://github.com/geelen/git-smart]\". It implements what I would call the \"safe and sensible\" version of git pull: {quote} In brief, it'll detect the best way to grab the changes from the server and update your local branch, using a git rebase -p if there's no easier way.
