As most of our users have LDAP accounts (with the same name as the username in the email) it would be nice to create accounts for them that can be used with the LDAP.  This could be done in two ways that I can think of: the easier (and one I would at some level prefer) is to have an ignore domain flag in the service options.  We would set ignore_domain=example.com and it would create new users with just the local part of their email addresses. \n\nThe other way would be to do some validation/checks on the backend data source, but that is going to be a great deal more complex.",

The problem of transition is fixed but  a  \"none\" option appears for this field value on the resolve screen.\n\nPlease help me\n\nThanks and Best regards,\n\nLerzan Sencer\n\n",

We've found that it is absolutely necessary to have that setting set to \"NO\" -- that is, users should NOT be notified of their own changes.  Otherwise, entirely too many notifications are sent out.  This creates an issue, however.  Our users are accustomed to receiving an acknowledgment that their support emails have been received.  We cannot figure out a way to have such an email sent out from Jira while the \"Notify users of their own changes?\" setting is set to \"NO\".",

While I understand the need to have a valid summary, in a helpdesk situation users often send quick support emails and forget to put in a subject line.  Right now, there's no automated feedback that curbs that behavior.  Furthermore, most users don't have very descriptive subjects for their support issues anyway.\n\nI would rather have to have our support techs edit a bunch of tickets that come in with \"(no subject)\" text as the summary than to have those tickets go into limbo.  We do have someone who gets the \"EMAIL HANDLER: Error\" emails (which is not well documented, btw), but that increases the time it takes to address an issue and does nothing to help us change users' behavior.\n\nUltimately, I'd rather have the handler accept the emails and use a standard (maybe even user-configurable) phrase such as \"(no subject)\" as the summary for those issues.  Having users get a failure notice (as mentioned in issue JRA-2456) would be an acceptable, although not as desired, alternative.  Having the ability to toggle between the two and possibly the current behavior would be ideal.\n\n",

Given the current jira interface our managers resort to excel...which is a great pity and undermines JIRA strengths.\n\nFor example: project managers who want to go thrue a list or issues and directly assign them to an iteration. Imagine an editable grid instead of going to each individual issues, with the task of having to try different combinations to balance the workload per iteration and user. \n\nI think this type of specialized view would be of great advantage to the product and I think very feasible given the javascript libraries (such as yahoo datagrid with inplace editing) available today.

For example, we need to know the Business Name, the Manager's name, the Franchisee's name, The phone number, and the fax number of the business reporting the problem. Obviously we don't want to make these Issue fields because we don't want to record the same information each time that business reports a bug!\n\nWe can add user properties to track the information - great. But the feature is actually quite useless because you can't make these fields available in the Issue screens!\n\nHow does any user of Jira track these properties of the users? Surely this lack of functionality is a glaring shortcoming of the whole system?\n\nPlease refer to my live chat session with one of your technicians below earlier....\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nYou are now chatting with Yuen Chi\nLeigh Morum: Hi and thanks for taking my call \n\nYuen Chi: Hi Leigh, how may I help you? \nLeigh Morum: We are evaluating Jira as we would like to use it to track issues. The problem we have is that after adding user properties - e.g. Company Name, Phone Number, Manager's name etc - we would like to make these new fields available to the help desk technicians. \n\nLeigh Morum: I can't find a way of adding these fields to the default screen to either display them to the technician - or to allow editing of the fields by the technician. \n\nYuen Chi: User properties? May I know what's the JIRA version you are using? \nLeigh Morum: It's 3.8.something \n\nLeigh Morum: The latest one I just downloaded a week ago. \n\nYuen Chi: Cool. \nYuen Chi: I'm sorry to tell you that, currently the user properties feature is reserved for admin use. \nYuen Chi: However, what I can suggest is, \nYuen Chi: You can write custom field to extract these values, then add them to the resolve issue screen. \nYuen Chi: May I know if you have any Java / JIRA API programmers at your side? \nLeigh Morum: OK that sounds promising! But I have no idea how to implement. I don't have any Java programmers this side so we're a bit wet behind the hears with this. \n\nYuen Chi: If that's the case, we can get one of our service partners to get in touch with you regarding this issue. \nLeigh Morum: please \n\nYuen Chi: If you have some techies at your side, you can get them to look at these pages:\n\nhttp://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/JIRA+Plugin+Guide\nhttp://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Custom+Field+Plugin+Module \nLeigh Morum: Can someone call me? \n\nLeigh Morum: +27824530754 \n\nLeigh Morum: or Skype username lmorum \n\nYuen Chi: Can I get them to get back to you on Monday? \nLeigh Morum: Sure no problem. \n\nLeigh Morum: Thanks for your help \n\nYuen Chi: Is lmorum@cosoft.co.za the point of contact? \nLeigh Morum: yes that e-mail is perfect \n\nYuen Chi: Do you mind to give me your company name? So that I can refer this back to my manager. \nLeigh Morum: Sure - it's Coherent Software Solutions (Pty) Ltd trading as Cosoft \n\nYuen Chi: Cool, thanks  \nLeigh Morum: ok thanks & cheers \n\nYuen Chi: Is there anything else that you'd like information on? \nLeigh Morum: One last thing \n\nLeigh Morum: Can I add a custom user field called Phone Number for example - to then be an available field for each user? i.e. without having to add the custom field to each and every user. \n\nYuen Chi: Based on my technical understanding, yes, this is do-able. \nLeigh Morum: Currently you have to go to each user and type in Custom field \"Telephone\" then the value. I want the new field \"Telephone\" to then e available for all users. \n\nYuen Chi: Oh I'm sorry, do you mean you want to apply the value through JIRA web interface on all users? \nLeigh Morum: You know how you currently go into edit a user - you just get the email address and the username. I want to get those two as well as the new \"Telephone\" field. i.e. Without having to add \"Telephone\" as a field property for each user record. \n\nLeigh Morum: You shouldn't have to type the word \"Telephone\" a thousand times if I have a thousand customer user \ns!\nLeigh Morum: You should be able to create a custom field called \"Telephone\" and then it's available as a property for all users - not just the one. \n\nYuen Chi: That's currently not possible in JIRA without customizing it. \nLeigh Morum: So it's really just a user property for a single user record? \n\nYuen Chi: \nYuen Chi: For time being and by default, yes. \nLeigh Morum: That's a great pity! The whole system looks perfect for our business - but we need to know more than just a username and password when tracking reported bugs or anything else. I would imagine other companies would be in a similar situation. \n\nLeigh Morum: Is there a way of getting around this issue? \n\nYuen Chi: Actually, our developers would like to hear from our customers about how this should be used. \n",

But the All tab includes all of the Change Log items which makes for a long and messy list of things. Most times, when I'm looking for information on an issue, I want to see just the Comments and the Work Logged to get the best feel of what happened with an issue. But I can't view them at the same time, so I have to view two separate \"conversations\" on an issue, which is disjointed at best.\n\nIt would be great if this interface was changed so that I could selectively add/remove tabs to my current view (i.e., let me click on Comments and then click on Work Log and it would leave the comments listed and add the Work Log to the list). I think this is a good improvement, especially as more plugins are added that would add additional tabs to this section of the issue viewer.",

I compiled the example and deployed it to our test server. The function itself works fine and closes the parent issue after executing (detail view of the issue is updated). When I had a look at the transitions of the issue, I saw that the transition is not available in the history list (transitions) of the issue and in the navigator, it still shows the status the issue had before executing the post function!!\n\nAfter having a look at the sourcecode I recognized that the variable 'store' (type WorkflowStore) is never used! Maybe the example is not complete at all?!? \n\nBTW, after re-indexing the database (Administration -> Indexing), the navigator shows the correct status! \n\nThanks in advance!\n\nRegards,\nChristian\n",

Improve the default look&feel of these tabs so that they better look like tabs, especially for the issue fields, instead of regular links\n. Offer the ability to customize the colors of such tabs (like done for other parts of the GUI), to let customers do some minimum color customization, in a standard way.\n\nI noticed that no explicit CSS style was used on that part of the interface. Using appropriate CSS tags would be a first step to help customization.\n\nThank you.",

I can understand that a person is not notified on the projects to which he doesn't have permissions, but he should at least be notified of the move - otherwise he doesn't even have a clue to what happened.\nCan something be done about that?\n\nKind Regards,\nAleksey",

There are a few problems with it at the moment:\n\n- As a non-admin, I can only configure a limited amount of email notifications myself, i.e. watches and scheduled filter reports. If I want to watch for all activity on a project (for example) I can't - the server admin has to.\n\n- Event based email notifications should ideally be more fine grained. As an example, say some users want to know about all new issues of a certain component as soon as they are created, but not the whole project. As far as I can tell, that's not possible right now - you either get notified of all new issues for a project or none at all.\n\nBasically, I think the ideal case is that users should be able to set up email events based on filters, i.e. like the scheduled email, but whenever there's a change, rather than after a schedule. And when this email is sent, it's the update, not the entire filter list.\n\nI'd be keen to see this go in so please feel free to throw ideas at me!",

Your feedback is key to helping us understand how you use JIRA so we can continue improving your experience. We have reviewed this issue over the last few days; unfortunately we don't have any plans to support this in JIRA for the foreseeable future.\n\nPlease remember that jira.atlassian.com is one of many inputs for the JIRA roadmap. You can [learn more about our process here|https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/110373/how-does-the-jira-team-use-jira-atlassian-com].\n \nI understand that our decision may be disappointing. Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.\n \nRegards,\nDave Meyer\ndmeyer@atlassian.com\nProduct Manager, JIRA Platform\n{panel}\n\nJIRA-1100 introduced editable comments.  This is great.  When our security officer reviewed the feature he wanted access to the change history, which would be important in the event of a security audit.  It appears that there is no way to view comment history.  I'm opening this improvement request to ask for the ability to view comment change history.  Ideally, this would be implemented such that a new permission was added 'View comment change history' so that its implementation could be configured at the site level.",

As one of JIRA strengths is it's ability to be integrated with other systems and or extended, the current backup scheme is troublesome when one wants to say, add new features to a 'production' JIRA as part of a development process.  \n\nFor example, a new release of a JIRA-based system involves the addition of a few custom fields.  Currently there's no automated way to develop/test those changes in a development copy then only apply the tested config changes to the production instance.  At the very least the ability to backup/restore config changes separately from issues would be a nice start.  Selectively adding these changes manually is tedious at best.",

Using the 'Assign to' link\n2. Setting the assignee while editing an issue, using 'Edit'\n3. Setting the assignee during a transition\n\nBecause the current assignee was not a recipient of 'Issue Updated' and 'Work Started on Issue' events, no email notifications were sent. \n\nI am requesting that all relevant events be triggered each time the event occurs. For example if an assignee and fix version is set while editing an issue, this should trigger both Issue Updated & Issue Assigned. If an assignee & fix version is set while transitioning to In Progress, this should trigger 'Work Started on Issue', 'Issue Updated', and 'Issue Assigned'.\n\nAll relevant events should be triggered, and the recipient should receive a single notification. In our particular application, we want the current assignee to receive a notification each time they are assigned, but only the watchers to receive notification when an issue is updated. Sending the current assignee emails every time an issue is updated by anybody (they are able to disable notifications for their own changes) is far too many notifications for our needs. Unfortunately, including Current assignee to the Issue Updated list is the only way to get them to receive AT LEAST the assignee emails. ",

Your input in the comments helps us understand how this affects you and what you're hoping to accomplish with JIRA.\n\nAt this time, this suggestion is not on the JIRA development roadmap; however, there are a number of third-party plugins mentioned in [this post from Atlassian Answers|https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/47652/jql-jira-filter-on-worklog] that can accomplish this.\n\nPlease remember that jira.atlassian.com is one of many inputs for the JIRA roadmap. You can [learn more about our process here|https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/110373/how-does-the-jira-team-use-jira-atlassian-com].\n\nI understand that our decision may be disappointing. Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.\n\nRegards,\nDave Meyer\n[dmeyer@atlassian.com|mailto:dmeyer@atlassian.com]\nProduct Manager, JIRA Platform\n{panel}\n\nI am looking for a way to search for all tasks that a specific user has been involved with.  \n\nFor example:\nTom creates a jira task and assigns it to Sally.\nSally logs work against the task and runs into a road block that only Jim can solve.\nSally assigns the task to Jim.\nJim logs work on the task and assigns it back to Sally.\nSally logs work and resolves the task.\nTom reviews and closes the task.\n\nThe task now shows Tom as the reporter and the Assignee.  There is no way to know that Sally and Jim worked on the task.  \n\nIt would be nice to have a search option to find out that  Sally (or Jim) contributed to the task.\n\nThis relates somewhat to JRA-6137",

It would be great if this knowledge would be accessible by search aggregation with an external client. And vice versa JIRA could be an aggregator itself to include search results from external systems. E.g. Alfresco and A9 supports OpenSearch (http://www.opensearch.org) to do exactly that.\nAnd given the support for open standards by atlassian this could be a no-brainer.",

Thus, it would be useful to _not_ also send out a notification to everyone that I made the typo in the first place. As I said [here|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRA-1100#action_73831], I was hoping Atlassian would have at least all the features in Philip's plugin, which has this feature.\n\nAlso, why is it that I cannot edit comment on issue in TST project (e.g. TST-9504) ? Are permissions set up there to disallow it?",
