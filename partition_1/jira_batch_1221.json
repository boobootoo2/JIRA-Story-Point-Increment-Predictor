In this scenario, one would want to set the Affects Version field to that archived version. However, archived versions cannot be selected in version picker fields. The workaround is to un-archive the version, add it to the Affects Version, and then re-archive the version. This adds seemingly unnecessary effort that could be avoided by slightly changing the requirements for archived versions.\n\nOne possible solution would be to add another section at the end of the Affects Version drop down list for \"Archived Versions\", similar to \"Released Versions\" and \"Unreleased Versions\". Putting this section at the bottom of the list helps keep it farther out of reach, but still allows one to select archived versions if necessary.\n\nAnother possible solution would be to allow manual entry of an archived version, without displaying it in the drop down list.\n\nAllowing project administrators to enable/disable selecting archived versions would be a plus.",

As quoted below:\n{quote}\nThe scenario where projects will be migrated is as follows:\n\n* Multiple Jira instances exist\n* A team using instance A want to move their project to instance B\n\nIn this scenario, we expect instance B to be the instance at risk and the instance that may require downtime or outages. We do not expect or accept that there should be any risk to instance A during this work.\n\nAll change introduces risk. Forcing us to make changes to project 1 in instance A so that project 2 can be imported into instance B is not acceptable. This introduces risk to:\n\n* Instance A\n* Instance B\n* Project 1\n* Project 2\n\nFurthermore, the stakeholders for project 1 and project 2 will be different. This puts us in a position where the stakeholders for project 1 can block project 2's migration. All of the time spent coordinating these groups and running tests before taking the action has a cost.\n\nIn terms of man-hours and billable support costs, this probably quadruples our cost to complete a project migration.\n\nI would understand a toggle solution where we can either limit validation to just the project that we are importing, or the entire instance.\n\nYour export / import solution is already very weak, given the amount of manual work we have to do to prepare an instance for import (custom fields, workflows, permission schemes, etc.) Adding this restriction on top of that does not resolve any issues for us as a customer, and in fact adds cost, complexity and risk to our environment.{quote}\n\nSupport has verified that JIRA indeed checking the userassociation for watcher and voter for all projects instead.

But an issue can only have one field that is a \"Comment\" field.\n\nI propose a new custom field type that behaves like the built-in comment field. We would use it to track check-in comment with our simple clearcase-integration, but I am sure that it will have many other uses where you want to add information, track who made the addition and when. The information should be shown as flow in a separate tab in the view issue screen, just as the comment field does.\n\nJust to be clear: Using the comment field is not an option in this use case - using the comment field would spam that field and make it hard to see normal comments.\n\nPlease also see JRA-24421 which unfortunately has been closed as \"answered\" despite that fact that that issue was a feature request and not a question regarding how to implement it as a plugin.",

After such a change, the Task list displays a small warning icon against the jira repository in the Task List View but this is not readily obvious to users.  Previously a dialog was automatically opened prompting for the credentials to be updated.\n\nThe consequences of not immediatly updating the password are that the failed attempts to logon to Jira result in too many retries and the user's SSO becomes invalidated.  User must then set another SSO password but can be unaware that Eclipse/Jira has caused invalidity through too many retries and issue can repeat.\n\nRegards, Danny Pearce (daniel.a.pearce@jpmorgan.com)",

Set to assign incoming mail to default reporter (in this case, Catapult Admin)\n5. Test the connection\n6. System responds with \"The Test Failed.

Please increase my memory, as documented here https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/96691/ondemand-performance-unbearably-slow or do whatever it takes to make our instance fast and smooth.\n\nSorry for creating a bug in here, but the forum comment said, just by creating a ticket, you could offer the solution. \n\nThanks for your great product and a fast reply,\nkeep up the good work!\n\nregards\nStephan Hoehne",

It is often not a subtask, but a related issue - maybe a child, maybe an issue that is blocked by an issue I am looking at, or maybe simply a related issue.  It would make my workflow much smoother if I could create a linked issue in the same way I can create a subtask or assign a label - by click on the \"More\" button from within an existing issue, or clicking on the \"Actions\" down-arrow next to an issue when it appears in a list, rather than clicking on create issue, and linking to the existing issue from within the new issue.\n\nThanks,\n\nDaniel.",
