This means that if you want to assign a value to the CustomField, you need to try to assign it and catch a ClassCastException exception, but there is no way to determine in advance if this assignment will succeed, before trying to assign the value to CustomField.\n\nThat being said, it might be a good idea to implement a method named something like getValueType() or getValueClass() which would allow us to do something like this:\n\nCustomField cf = ... ; // our custom field\nObject newValue = ... ; // provided new Value for the CustomField\nif (cf.getValueType().equals(newValue.getClass())\n// now we know we could assign the value to the custom field without an exception",

The \"comments\"-property includes always all available comments.

Notifications should use the default domain assigned to a project.\n\nWhy? Here is a use case.\n\nCompany A use a public Jira to give their client a way to report issues.\nThe company grow and purchase company B, company C and company D, each having their own Jira.\nCompany A want to consolidate Jira, as their teams have merged. It would be counter productive to manage 5 instances of Jira, to have their customer to create account on 2 or 3 instance of Jira to follow ticket and to quintuple the hardware and database.\n\nBy having multiple domain, the company could merge the 5 jira into one, consolidate all the user into 1 instance and keep the domains associated to the merged company.\n\nCustomer from jira.companyC.com will still be able to access their project, not seeing the project from jira.companyB.com unless they acces it through the proper domain.\n\nThe users handling the request can also kept track of the domain, or with proper permissions, access all project from any domain.\n\n\nTHIS feature would give Jira Enterprise true enterprise level.\n\nI hope this will remain open to allow people interested in this feature to vote for it.\nThanks",

Steps to Reproduce:\n# jira url:jira.com:8080, confluence url: wiki.com:8090\n# Configure the application links with trusted or OAuth\n# Add a confluence QuickNav gadget in JIRA with the following URL:\n{code}\nhttp://wiki.com:8090/rest/gadgets/1.0/g/com.atlassian.confluence.plugins.gadgets:gadget-search/gadgets/gadget-search.xml\n{code}\n# Add the gadget and configure spaces, pages\n# The gadget should review the pages correctly.\n# Proceed to Confluence and switch the base url to mywiki.com:8090\n\n\nh3. Actual Result:\n\nThe gadget in JIRA dashboard throws error when it unable to reach the old url.\n{code}\nRequests to http://wiki.com:8090/rest/gadget/1.0/pagegadget/getrenderedpage.json?pageId=917506 are not allowed. See your administrator about configuring a whitelist entry for this destination (http://confluence.atlassian.com/x/KQfCDQ ).\n{code}\n\nh3. Expected Result:\n\nIt seems to be intended behaviour which the gadget rely on the gadget url. However, there are chances that the url of the instance may be change and switch. \n\nIt's a painful process for customer to add the gadget again to their dashboard and the approach unable to edit the gadget for all users at one time.\n\nFor better customer experience, the following suggestion can be implemented:\n* Allow customer to modify the gadget url that added into JIRA through the gadget list so they don't have to add the gadget again. Otherwise, may possible to allow the gadget to work dynamically so it can detect the url of the instance automatically.\n* Create a better integration in terms of adding cross platform gadget. For instance, customer can authenticate first so he has the rights to select a application and add the gadgets into JIRA. The interface can be similar to issue linking interface.",

The problem\nThe problem is that there are others keystore types, such as *PKCS12* for example and when using JIRA configuration tool to insert the SSL configuration, it will always define keystore type as *JKS* into the {{server.xml}}.\n\nIf we want to define a different keystore type, the only option available is manually edit it into the {{server.xml}} file.

In the latter case, the context of their comment is often highly dependent on the action they are performing at a time. For example, in a comment made from a smart commit message, the comment is usually a description of the code commit being made. This breaks up the flow of the comments and often makes it difficult to unscramble what people are talking about.\n\nIt would be great if comments that were made in the context of other actions (such as reassigning issues, editing metadata, smart commits) were annotated in some way with an indication of the action. I believe that Bugzilla does this.\n\nI could use the Activity tab to see the context of a comment, but the comment text in this tab is too small for everyday use. A little annotation in the Comments tab would really help.\n\nThoughts?",

Especially because of the well integration between your products. It is easy to find relevant information and navigate between the systems. E.g I can navigate from Jira to a Bamboo build regarding the selected issue. Or I can see the build and test results of Bamboo in my build tab of the issue. Perfect!!\nI think the reason is, that the Atlassian strategy wants to make things easier.\n\nNo I found something which conflicts with your concept regarding Stash\n* I have an Issue and the regarding code changes in an Git Branch.\n* Now I have created a Pull Request in Stash and of course somebody should review my changes.\n* The review was successful and I have merged the branch into the master over Stash.\n\nPERFECT usability, but:\nFrom the Jira-Issue view:\n\n* Where can I see that the Pull request was approved?\n* Where is the \"green/red color\" which indicates the state?\n* How can I navigate directly to the relevant Pull request? The number is available, but not a link. I can navigate to everything (Project, Repository, Source, Commit) but not the important Pull-Request. It is possible to navigate from the Pull request to the issue but not from the issue to the Pull request.\n\nI can not believe that this is not implemented..... This follows not the Atlassian strategy \"Make things easier\"\n\nI hope this functionality will come soon. It is a must...\n",

Replace with actual images so as to permit users to choose their own fonts in their browser.\n\nThis applies to Confluence as well and is addressed by the [KB available here|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/CONFKB/Icons+on+Confluence+Top+Navigation+Bar+Rendered+as+Letters+in+Internet+Explorer].\n\nIf fonts are _forced_ by the browser to something not-Atlassian, your UI icons look terrible. For instance, on JIRA 6.1 (this site), the help icons have the \"E003\" UTF-like block rather than the nice, helpful question mark. To avoid this issue when persons choose their own fonts for display, I would like to see a return to images instead of leveraging \"unused characters\" in your custom font palette. ",
