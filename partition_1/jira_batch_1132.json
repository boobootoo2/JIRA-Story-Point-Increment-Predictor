      "description": "h3. Summary\r\n\r\nJIRA REST API has these two similar methods (in [this documentation|https://docs.atlassian.com/jira/REST/latest/#api/2/user-getUser]):\r\n# GET on api/2/user (return information about a user)\r\n# GET on api/2/user/search (information on one of more users)\r\n\r\nWhen using operation 2 for a user, it intermittently fails. Though we have a 200 success return, an empty set of data is returned, though the user has data and operation 1 returns correctly.\r\n\r\nThis is consistently failing for some users and consistently working for others.\r\n\r\nh3. Environment\r\n* Only tested in JIRA Cloud\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Have a clean JIRA Cloud instance\r\n# Create a user:\r\n#* Username: test\r\n# Make sure it belongs exactly to: \u2018confluence-users\u2019 and \u2018jira-software-users\u2019\r\n#* We were able to replicate it this way and since it\u2019s not happening to all users, group membership may play a role\r\n# Run this (replacing user, password and instance accordingly, 'otheruser' must have access to the users)\r\n{noformat}\r\ncurl -D- -u otheruser:password -X GET -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" https://myinstance.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=test\r\n{noformat}\r\n# Run this (there's a /search' in this one):\r\n{noformat}\r\ncurl -D- -u otheruser:password -X GET -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" https://myinstance.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user/search?username=test\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nBoth return a 'HTTP/1.1 200 OK' and user information.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nBoth return a 'HTTP/1.1 200 OK', showing the operation is accepted, the first operation shows the data from the user, but the second returns no data (returns \u2018[ ]\u2019).\r\n \r\nh3. Notes\r\nTestLink uses \u2018/rest/api/2/user/search\u2019 and may fail because of that, if the user selected is affected.\r\n\r\nIf you have access to TestLink code, we\u2019ve been able to fix it removing the \u2018/search\u2019 from the call.\r\n\r\nJust changed the file \"/var/www/testlink/third_party/fayp-jira-rest/Jira.php\", public function \"getUser\":\r\n - From: $this->request->openConnect($this->host . 'user/search/?username=' . $username, 'GET');\r\n - To: $this->request->openConnect($this->host . 'user?username=' . $username, 'GET');\r\n\r\nh3.Workaround\r\nIf you\u2019re searching data for one user, use \u2018/rest/api/2/user\u2019 instead.",

Hopefully this is just an oversight and it will be reinstated soon.\r\n\r\nIf the case is that this move was deliberate, then I am opposed to its removal.  Managing JIRA as an administrator, especially at the enterprise level, is complicated by the number of schemes in the JIRA instance.  Having separate workflows, issue type schemes, issue type screen schemes, screen schemes, and screens for every single JIRA project is unmanageable when dealing with a large number of projects.  This is why I have always used the JIRA Classic/Default template since the introduction of Project Templates, as it creates no new schemes.

Other issues are not affected.\r\nUPDATE: some issues with other attachments are also affected.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nWhen such issue is identified there is possible workaround by removing attachments from the affected issue and then removing issue.\r\nBut before doing that the deadlocked connections to database need to be terminated - as they block any changes on the affected issue. This can be done by executing pg_terminate_backend on database or by restarting the application.\r\n\r\nIt would not be easy to identify which are the issues that contain attachments when you are trying to delete a huge number of issues. A much simpler way to work this around is to create a temporary project that have the browse project permission restricted to only administrator and then move those issues into that project to keep it out of sight. You can then delete the whole project when the fix is released.\r\n\r\nh3. Technical details\r\n\r\nThe problem is that DefaultAttachmentManager#deleteAttachment calls attachmentStore.deleteAttachment which spawns new thread. When the thread processing is done then callback is executed in that new thread - and callback code executes attachmentIndexManager.removeAttachmentIndex which deletes DB entries (outside the main transaction(!)) that were already modified (in main transaction(!)) before the DefaultAttachmentManager#deleteAttachment call. \r\n\r\nDue to that we have deadlock:\r\n* Request thread waits (on .claim()) for background thread\r\n* Background thread waits for response from DB (it tries to remove row in DB)\r\n* DB is waiting for main transaction to finish (as this block the query done by background thread)\r\n\r\nThis issue does affect Cloud instances only (in BTF other code is used that doesn't spawn new thread).",

If you enter the real URL of an app that JIRA can not access (dropped packets, not rejected). The application links page becomes unusable. It appears the page is attempting to connect to each application listed (not sure why). Eventually there is a timeout and an error is displayed. Problem is, the existing application links ARE NOT SHOWN. This means you can't even delete or change the offending link.\r\n\r\nI was eventually able to get in and delete the link, but it took a very long time.
