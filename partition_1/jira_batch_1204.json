[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-39797].\n  {panel}\n\nThis jira describes two defects, and one usability improvement:\n\nDEFECT 1:\nWhen assigning a jira by the name of the assignee, you usually start typing the name of the assignee, and then select the assignee from the filtered list.\n\nWhen a user needs to re-assign a huge number of jiras to the same person, it is cumbersome to type the name over and over. Its easier to use the filtered list the first time, then copy the full name as provided in the list, and paste it into the assignee field for all other jiras you want to assign to that same person.\n\nThe issue is that when you paste that full name into an assignee field, you are forced to re-select that person from the auto-complete field (which results in the same name being set anyway). If you remove focus from the assignee field after pasting in the full name, and without selecting the user from the filtered list, then the assignment fails with: \"User '??????' does not exist.\" - even through it is the exact name of that user.\n\nThis happens in both the Assign Dialog, and the Assignee editable field (under people) on the jira page, however the error in the Assign dialog doesn't appear until you click the Assign button on the dialog.\n\nExact steps:\nLocate any editable existing jira, which is currently assigned to a user (lets say \"Bob Smith\").\nEdit the assignee field, and copy the exact full name (Bob Smith).\nDelete the text in the assignee field.\nPaste in the copied text (Bob Smith).\nThe filter will come up with the match for Bob Smith. Don't select this - just click outside of the text field (shift focus) to confirm your edit of Bob Smith.\nRed error message is displayed underneath saying \"User 'Bob Smith' does not exist.\"\n\nI'm guessing that the actual assignee being set in the background is not the name of the user, but his email address or user Id, and to prevent accidental incorrect assignment in the case of two users having the exact same full name... however even in large organisations that is not a very likely occurrence. For usability sake, if the user makes an edit to the assignee field and the field loses focus, you could do and ajax check for an exact, distinct match on the supplied name, and if so - assign that user Id/email transparently in the background, otherwise (if no match or non-distinct match) display the usual error.\nOnce you remove focus from the field, there is an ajax request and a busy-spinner is displayed while waiting - in that request you could supply the entered text, and look for a distinct match on name...\n\nDEFECT 2:\nIn the error scenario above, if you have pasted in the exact full name, shifted focus, and received the error message \"User 'Bob Smith' does not exist.\", and you attempt to fix it by opening the dropdown box on the assignee field (which is visible while the field is in edit mode) to reselect the user from the list; then the list opens, but filtering fails, and displays \"No Matches\", even though you have the exact full name of that user in the text edit field.\nYou are forced to once again delete the name form the field, and type it in again.\n\nThis happens in both the Assign Dialog, and the Assignee editable field (under people) on the jira page, however the error in the Assign dialog the \"No Matched\" on dropdown-click doesn't appear until after you've tried to click the Assign button on the dialog, and received the error message.\n\nUSABILITY:\nWhile assigning jiras and typing in the assignee name, the list of filtered users with a partial match of the entered text is displayed, however this filtered list is very slow (we use an Atlassian hosted Jira). Surely you could keep a list of most used users in a cookie / local storage in the browser, and use that as fast filtering then assigning?\n\nAlso, if you don't use the filtered list, but just click the dropdown, a list of \"Suggestions\" are displayed. This list is not populated very well. The users I assign jiras to most ofter are not in this list... instead its got names in of users I've not interacted with for a very long time, or very infrequently. This list of suggested users should be populated by users you most frequently interact with. Possibly filtered by Jira project.\n\n\nThis is noted on our Atlassian hosted Jira: Atlassian JIRA (v6.1.7#6163-sha1:94d557d), but might affect newer versions also.",

Which provides these features for Internal Users and seems almost deceptively geared towards them by using terms like \"Customer Support Desk\", \"Customer Portal\", and \"Customer Knowledge Base\", gives many people the impression of a External Support System such as Zendesk, Freshdesk, etc.\n\nHowever, it seems we would have many hurdles to jump around to utilized it in and close form of this fashion.\n\nWe currently have a support team of about 75 agents, which handle 15-30k tickets a month.\n\nThey have very specific needs. Customer Login & Ticket History, Chat, Knowledgebase, Screensharing / Video cast / recording, Phone support, etc.\n\nWhile a few of these can be solved via add-ons and expensive API development. The fundamental backend doesn't support this. Nor does licensing.\n\nOur company is ready to switch off Zendesk. and I'm pushing for JIRA so our 200 employees could collaborate with support, dev, and all around product releases and customer reported bugs etc. But there are many deal breakers here.\n\nMaybe I'm looking at it the wrong way, But as I understand it, We'd need a couple million user license to support this.\n\nAnd yes I'm aware of mail handlers, etc.\n\nTheres got to be another way?",

This has made for a poor experience for users accessing the documentation locally (from an export that has been imported into their Confluence instance). In addition, it provides a less-than-complete experience for our many customers that also use JIRA Agile, JIRA Service Desk, etc.\n\nWe will continue to provide PDF exports of the documentation for all major versions of JIRA.\n\nIf you have concerns or comments on this decision, please feel free to comment on this ticket.",

It causes a lot of confusion with our new (and old) employees who make not unreasonable assumptions, such as workflow transitions on an issue are applied to any issues that clone it.\n\nThe normal use case for the clone functionality is to speed up the creation of an issue that is substantially similar to another issue and then only have to edit the fields that differ, and the relationship between the issues is about something that happened historically.  It's still useful to maintain the information for hunting down issues that were unreasonably duplicated.\n\nI suggest that using past tense (\"cloned\" / \"was cloned by\") would be more appropriately descriptive.  I even find \"clone\" to be a misleading term for what it describes, and something like \"templated\" / \"was templated from\" might be even better.\n\nIt's not clear to me if administrators can even do this themselves.  (See JRA-13976 and JRA-11600)  In any event CLONES is clearly more difficult to change than the other link types and changing it yourself is not recommended.",

If that is not possible they would like a Quick Filter drop-down selection instead of the more.../less... that is currently available.

This happens when using the post function \u2018Copy Value From Other Field\u2019, available with the add-on \u2018JIRA Suite Utilities\u2019.\n\nAfter investigation, I notice that the problem only occurred if different parent options had the same child option values in the Select List custom field. For example:\n* Value 1\n** Value A\n* Value 2\n** Value A\n** Value B\n\nIf the parent issue holds the values (Value 2, Value A), since \u2018Value A\u2019 is also present in \u2018Value 1\u2019, the value copied is actually (Value 1, Value A), which is not the expected behaviour. It seems that it only takes account of the child options to choose the value. \n\nIf we choose the second parent option created in the list, it actually chooses the first one, though it is unclear if its chosen by order.\n\n*Steps to reproduce*\n* Install and enable \u2018JIRA Suite Utilities\u2019 add-on\n* Create a \u2018Select List (Cascating)\u2019 custom field\n* Add 2 options (e.g. Value 1 and Value 2) and, within each one, one child option with the same name in both (e.g Value A)\n** Pretty much like the example above (no need for Value B)\n* Create a project with Subtasks\n* Create a specific workflow for the subtasks\n* Add a \u2018Copy Value From Other Field\u2019 post function to the \u2018Create Issue\u2019 transition in this workflow\n** Select the created custom field for both source and destination\n** Select the option \u2018Copy from parent\u2019 option\n* Create an issue in the project with the second parent option and equivalent sub-option (e.g. Value 2, Value A)\n* Create a Subtask for this task\n* Its value for the field will be the first one (Value 1, Valeu A), when it should be the second (i.e. a simple copy).\n\n*Workarounds*\nNo workaround available.",

Feedback from customer:\n{panel}\n- I find that the documentation of the migration is thin. It should have expressly stated that the internal directory will not serve as a *Fallback*. \n- The migration script should have first performed a *check* on what users are missing in the AD directory and should give a report of what users are missing to the Admin performing the migration. It should provide the opportunity to cancel the migration. In our case, we have about 330 users and the migration failed for about 40, that we know of.\n- Similar to the previous point, JIRA should provide a report independent of a migration process on the JIRA users missing in the external directory. Only with the knowledge of which accounts are missing can we begin the process of applying for new AD accounts.  Related to that is an issue that I have experienced probably 20 times since the migration: We get a report from a user and the user says he or she cannot log in. As a JIRA admin and not an AD admin I have no way of knowing if the problem is because the user has forgotten his JIRA internal directory password or because the AD entry is missing altogether.\n{panel}",
