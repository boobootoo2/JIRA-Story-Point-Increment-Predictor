One item it seems to be missing, however, is how to link to another Jira issue.  I would add the \\[|key-nnn\\] notation to the first row of the Links help table along with \\[#anchor\\] and \\[^attachment\\].\n\nWhile I'm picking, your \\{panel\\} example in the Advanced formatting section is a bit sloppy.  Only the last example properly closes the section with another \\{panel\\} macro.

These users also have email addresses that would be invalid for LDAP authentication: they do not exist on this server. However, this dual system *does work* and offers us a very useful flexibility in managing JIRA: our JIRA admins are not the same as our IT sysadmins, who manage LDAP and other backend systems, and it is useful to set up demo accounts without bothering the sysadmins for additional accounts each time.\n\n{panel}However, we have run into a problem now, because we want to change some of the passwords for these \"internal\" users (the users that are not authenticated using LDAP). This seems to be impossible: on the \"Edit User\" screen in Administration it is not possible to change these passwords, even though they are passwords set by JIRA and not by the external system (LDAP).{panel}\n\nPlease advise if this is a bug or a feature and what the Atlassian policy is: if \"external password management\" *really* means external, then the password fields should *not* be shown on user creation, *nor* should it be possible to create a user with an email address that is invalid for the external authentication system (as noted above).\n\nWe do not think that the system should be so inflexible, however: we would very much like the flexibility of managing some blocks of users using JIRA and some using an external system. However, in this case, JIRA must be able to recognize which system is managing which password.",

Depending on which project template you choose, a fresh set of schemes will be created for you. These new schemes do not use the default issue type scheme.\n\nIf you would like to create a project that uses the same schemes as an existing project, we have introduced a new \"Created with shared configuration\" feature when creating projects. Simply select an existing project, and JIRA will create a new project that shares all the same schemes as the existing project. [Learn more here|https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiraserver070/defining-a-project-749382822.html].\n\nWhile we have kept the default issue type scheme for now, it is not used by default unless specifically selected and we expect to remove it in a future release.\nRegards,\nDave Meyer\nProduct Manager, JIRA Platform\n{panel}\n\nBy default, all newly created issue types are automatically added to the Default Issue Type Scheme.  However, we have some specific issue types for use with non-global projects that need not be shared amongst all other projects.  (Most of our projects are using the Default Issue Type Scheme for simplicity.)  It would be nice if either:\n\n1) the \"remove\" functionality was added to this scheme; or\n2) newly created issue types never even made it to the Default Scheme.",

Create two User Groups:\n - UserGroup1\n - UserGroup2\n2. Add User1 into UserGroup1, add User2 into UserGroup2\n3. add custom field \"BrowseProject\" (Group Picker type)\n4. configure this custom field with several Contexts acording to each project:\n  - \"UserGroup1\" value for Project1\n  - \"UserGroup2\" value for Project2\n5. Chage my Permission Scheme to:\n 5.1. Choose \"Browse Project\" permission.\n 5.2. Delete all Users/Groups from that \"Browse Project\" permission.\n 5.3. Add Group Selector permission with value \"BrowseProject\" into \"Browse Project\" permission\n6. login under user1 or user2.\n7.\n  Current behavior: both user1 and user2 see all projects. Both user1 and user2 can create new Issue for all projects.\n  Suspected behavior: user1 should see Project1 only; user2 see Project2 only\n  BUG: user1 should NOT know about Project2 at all; user2 should NOT know about Project1 at all.\n\nActually, I have several hundreds projects, that is why I need one unique way to manage users accessing to every project.

Easy-to-attach handler to JIRA events being happening are caught and processed.\n\nHowever, the power of these listeners are too little, they do not allow to cancel the action or interact with it anyhow, they are already called when the action is happened and there is no chance to cancel the operation.\n\nWhy listeners: easy and pretty way to catch events without the need of modifying JIRA sources, since if we will modify that, our administrators will have many problems with upgrading to newer JIRA versions, making it very difficult to support.\n\nWhy we need this: we are going to use listeners service to maintain link with our server which itself maintains links with MS Project server in order to join the project planning with tracking and reporting. All changes in all systems joined together should be tracked and recorded, so if some problem occures on external system we should be able to cancel JIRA action, since it will be out-of-sync otherwise.\n\nHow this should work: same as currently, just listener should be able to throw exception that is processed in the same cycle as the event thus the error message from the exception will go to the error messages to the end user as the result of the operation and it will be canceled like normaly in JIRA if error occures.\nMaybe some override function like requireInstantReply() should be added to listeners defaulting to false, thus only listeners that wish this instant processing (which takes time per each operation of course) will be executed in the same thread.\n\nHere is same post on boards: http://forums.atlassian.com/thread.jspa?threadID=12731&tstart=0",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-10916].\n  {panel}\n\nThis feature request is basically concerned with how email is handled when creating or commenting on a ticket - and almost all of it is replicated by other tickets. But there's been so little work done on email handling I wanted to start another ticket to renew the subject and give people a chance to comment.\n\nWhile one of the reasons I like JIRA is the clean interface and ease of working with tickets. The vast majority of our users are used to and want to continue interacting with our ticketing system via email. We can generally do this with JIRA - however a handful of features are lacking that require us to manually touch each ticket - usually to update information in it or 'file' it - either in a specific project or more commonly, a component.\n\nMy request is that Atlassian recognize the need for much more robust email handling capabilities - While I acknowledge it is kind of a pain to populate custom fields based on content of an email (though with the regex handler this should be at least almost doable), it is kind of nuts (IMHO) to support components and default leads for components, without allowing email created tickets to be placed in a component.  For example, one of our mailboxes receives mail sent to 'security', 'abuse', and 'copyright' - I've set up separate handlers for each of these - but since I can't file the ticket created by each into a separate component I either have to create separate projects for each or manually move each ticket into the proper component. If we put them into a common project, we can't even tell which handler touched them - there's no preserving of the email header information.\n\nWe also often send information via a ticket to groups of individuals - these groups are not maintained in our AD - they're local email distribution lists or listserves that are maintained by one of the >300 departments on campus. We're not going to set up separate bogus accounts for those lists in JIRA for each of these since there's no distributed group management function. What we really really need is the ability to allow the alternate notification type field (or some variant thereof) to permit either the ticket handler or the ticket submitter to enter a non JIRA account email address and then have that email address notified on change of status to the ticket. Similarly we really need a simple ability to click a link and have an entire ticket (comments and all) forwarded off to some random address we enter.\n\nOne concept you may want to consider - though it'll raise hell with your authorization architecture - allow the owner of a ticket to be able to create and email a tokenized URL that gives time delimited access to a specific ticket - to whomever has the URL. This would allow us to grant very temporary access to a ticket to someone not in JIRA or who might not normally need access. I have had times when I need to show a ticket to an attorney or a department head on a one time basis - being able to send them a tokenized link that allowed them in to see just that ticket for hours or days would be fantastic.\n\nThe other critical reason we need all this was also mentioned a while back in another ticket in this component. Our unit (not to mention the campus) has multiple ticketing systems. The ability to interact with them is critical - without that we can't justify having a separate ticketing system - and we really don't want to give up JIRA. Email is the ticketing lingua franca, and the ability to customize an outgoing email and consume incoming emails is the simplest way to do this. It would be very helpful if we could add a special notification type to the notification scheme - one where a highly custom formatted email was sent *in addition* to the normal notification email. For example, perhaps a project (or groups of projects) could send an email whose body was basically a custom XML format of the ticket (we'd set up the xml) to a specific address, e.g., a mailbox for our other ticketing system. The only real alternative for this is for us to have a programmer custom code a plug in to interact with, in our case, RT.\n\nOkay - I hope this gets the idea across. Many thanks.\nMC",

Currently JIRA will try to rip such mails apart, attempting to extract text from the HTML, and attaching other bits as attachments.\n\nThis is a problem because:\n\n- *No attempt is made to identify \"alternative\" parts which mean the same thing.* In the case where there is a text/plain part and a text/html part, JIRA will extract the text/plain part as the body of the message, but then as well attempt to attach the text/html part to the issue. This usually fails however, as text/html parts when inline in a message usually denote the HTML version of the plain text, and thus mail clients don't usually bother to attach a filename to the part. This causes a warning message to appear in the logs (see JRA-10825 for more info):\nbq. Cannot create attachment without a filename - inline content?\nWe need to come up with a way to identify these alternative parts, and ignore the redundant parts so that they are not attached to the JIRA issue.\n\n- *This may completely lose the meaning of the email.* For example, the position of inline images may have an impact on the meaning of the message.",

It is at the end the tab the users normally check for more while trying to understand what has to be downloaded, what has been done, ....\n\nOn the Release we would like to \"link\" two other informations:\n- the list of installation kits (full name) it is builf of\n- the list of sites where it runs\n\nThe first can be a simple \"attachment\" : a document where who has delivered the new Release reports the installation kits (RPMs for linux but any free text to be more general). \n\nThe list of sites can be helpfull as who i running a SW, with a version, might be interested in being logged such to be warned of new releases and, on the other side, the Configuration Control of the SW Company can always know whats running where. To have what I asled for you should also add the \"concept\" of \"site\" that can be a special user, with email configrured as any other user.  am only suggetsing a solution but I am sure there are more and more. I am interested in the Configuration Control honestly rather then in the email alert on new releases but this might be of interest of others.\n\nAny suggestion is welcome. DO you have plans in such direction i.e. \"expand Release concept\" ?\n\nThe \"attachment\" and \"sites pane\" can be two new links in the Release Tab I attach.\n\n",
