If you have hundreds, this gets daunting\n* It pollutes the fixversion field with multiple fixversion values. This isn't a big deal but it's a consequence of the workaround GH had to do. \n* Delegating this task to project admins isn't always possible due to the learning curve.

Most important feature for me is a configurable expiry date of a user account. We too have our customers access our JIRA. We have no control over their employment there and we need to provide an appropriate security behavior to disable accounts automatically based on conditions. In our case, our internal security guideline for user accounts requires us to disable each external account after 365 days until they are requested to be reinstated.\n\nI would like to request that Atlassian honors data and IT security requirments better ba adding these features to user management:\n* User account expiry by date or duration\n* Password expiry by date or duration\n* Feature to disable an account\n",

That is, you can call:\n\n{code}\nsetRetainExistingValuesWhenParameterNotProvided(boolean retainExistingValues, boolean onlyValidatePresentFields). \n{code}\n\nThis is *VERY* useful for cases where an admin may need to edit an issue (and has approval to do so), but can not provide the values for the required fields.  \n\nIn such a case the admin should still be able to edit the issue (the non-required fields).\n\nThis can now be done by writing a plugin, which could expose a REST API to scripts that an admin could use.\n\nHowever, JIRA has a REST API already, and this feature should simply be incorporated into JIRA's existing REST API.\n\nThat is, the JIRA REST method:\n\n{code}\n/rest/api/2/issue/{issueIdOrKey}\n{code}\n\nFor example a flag 'onlyValidatePresentFields' should be added to the PUT| request.\n\nShould be updated to include a parameter to allow the issue to be edited, even if the issue has required fields that are not filled in.\n\nThis is *required* in enterprise environment where JIRA is not the only tool in play, and we need to have batch scripts which integrate JIRA issues with other systems.  Such scripts typically need to fill in certain fields, and they can not be blocked simply because the issue has required fields.\n\nThis enhancement is critical to allowing JIRA to more effectively operate in enterprise environment where higher levels of automation and integration are required.\n\nTo do this level of automation currently we are forced to jump through many hoops:\n\n- don't make fields required in field configuraitons\n\n- make fields required in workflow transitions or behaviors (using third party plugins.\n\n- the third party plugins are not supported, so what's the point of buying enterprise support for JIRA?\n\n- yes we could spend a month developing and debugging a Java plugin, but again, this should be supported out of the box.  Its basic requirement for enterprise environments.\n\nThis feature is not a \"nice to have\" it is required for JIRA to effectively work in an enterprise environment where higher levels of automation and integration are required.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Please refer to JSP-122399.\n\nDuring the upgrade, indicate the plugins that are no longer compatible or out of date and deactivate them. You could also add an options to remove those plugins.\n\nYou should be able to select the folder/place where you want to install the application (not use the previous folder).\n\nGive the user (that performs the updates) an option to reconfigure the email settings\n\nRe-install the service service (I had to do that manually and it was a pain since I wasn't the original installer).\n\nAllow the use of multiple ports during the upgrade process instead of having to go through the xml file modification or use the JIRA web UI.\n",

In this case it would have to look into the .cur and .new subdirectories to find the mails.\nA further benefit of maildir support wouold be, that messages can be properly flagged as 'seen' or 'deleted' very much like on an IMAP connection.\n\nAnother nice to have feature would be to also allow \"forwarding\" of handled messages and error messages to sub-maildirs (e.g. 'handled' and 'error') of the import directory.\n\nThe JavaMaildir library could be used to provide a mailserver-like interface to maildirs: http://javamaildir.sourceforge.net/\n\nWe had implemented this as a plugin in JIRA 4.x, but with the massive changes in mail handling in JIRA 5 (no configuration of mail fetching services anymore) this no longer works.\n",

The prefered agile way in Scrum is to only track the remaining estimate and do not waste time in thinking about the question \"how much time should I log for ISSUE-4711\".\n\nIt would be nice if the GreenHopper project configuration allows to change the log work behaviour like:\n\n* use the classical \"Time Spent\" screen\n* use a custom screen (and that custom screen can only contain the field remaining estimate)\n\n\nRegards,\nRuchi",

Some fields, especially the project and environment are filled in already, which makes life of our testers a lot easier, because we collect a lot of environment information (plugin revision number, host software and version, operating system, machine specs, graphics card model and driver version, etc.) which is otherwise a pain to have ready always.\n\nAlso using the REST Api is a big issue, because we'd have to add http support, json processing, etc. to our plugins, while using OS calls to bring up a browser with these infos encoded in the url is really easy.\n\nSo this is great, the only thing that is a little bit of a nuisance is that for people having the \"change reporter\" permission, the reporter is set to nobody by default. Storing the Jira user name in our plugin just so we can put it into the url seems a little bit wasteful, but if we don't pass it, the user has to put it there manually, even though he just logged in.\n\nIf calling a URL directly without user name could default to the logged in user or if there were a magic number that sets the field to the currently logged in user, this would make our experience perfect. The Assignee field for example can be set to automatic by passing assignee=-1.",

Hence new projects get created regularly and users get added or removed regularly.\n\nThe desire is to have a common default dashboard, which reports the project status in the scope of the respective project, which does not require manual configuration. On project creation, this dashboard should be automatically made available based on a central template and should get pushed to all current and future project members.\n\nUsers would see dashboards for all the projects, they are assigned to after directly after login, without the need of manually adding/configuring a dashboard.\n\nh1.SCOPE OUTLINE\n- Create and maintain auto-dashboard templates per project type in the admin interface. Potentially multiple auto-dashboards (e.g. one with a general overview, one focused on defects)\n- Auto-Dashboard templates are based on the \"standard\" dashboard gadgets\n- The gadgets are based on filters, which ignore any project context.\n- If an auto-dashboard is added to the dashboards for a user, he context of the affected project is automatically added to the underlying filters\n- When a user gets added to a project, the auto-dashboard will be added to the favourite dashboards. If he gets removed, the auto-dashboard also gets removed\n- Users can opt-out of these dashboards.",

Please remember that jira.atlassian.com is one of many inputs for the JIRA roadmap. You can [learn more about our process here|https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/110373/how-does-the-jira-team-use-jira-atlassian-com].\n\nI understand that our decision may be disappointing. Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.\n\nRegards,\nDave Meyer\n[dmeyer@atlassian.com|mailto:dmeyer@atlassian.com]\nProduct Manager, JIRA Platform\n{panel}\n\nWe would like to add support for the \"search for issues based on their history\"-feature to our custom fields.\nAccording to [https://support.atlassian.com/browse/JSP-121642] this is currently not possible. Currently you only get {panel}History searches do not support the 'xyz' field.{panel}\n\nSo it would be nice if JIRA would support history based searches for custom fields and developers could add it to their custom fields as well.

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-27613].\r\n{panel}\r\n*Background*\r\nJIRA does not natively support the idea of field level security (JRA-1330), the most popular of which is the ability to the hide Time Tracking fields from customers (JRA-2364). We know that a lot of customers really want a way for JIRA to solve this kind of problem.\r\n\r\n*View Ports*\r\nInternally at Atlassian we have been throwing around the idea of what we call \"View Ports\". The idea behind this is that admins can configure an alternative view of the JIRA View Issue screen for different groups. One of the items that can be configured is the ability to choose what fields are shown in the View Port.\r\n\r\n*Example Scenario*\r\nYou have a company that specialises in custom development solutions and have 10 internal staff members with 200 external customers. You want to manage all your issues in one JIRA project but you do not want to expose the time tracking fields to your customers.\r\n\r\n*View Port Solution*\r\n1. Admin creates a JIRA group for all the 'external customers'. \r\n2. Admin then creates a View Port for this group only.\r\n3. Admin configures the View Port to show all fields except time tracking.\r\n\r\nWhen anyone in the 'external customers' group logs into a specific url, they are taken to this View Port. They will not be able to login into the normal JIRA system.\r\n\r\n*Comments Please*\r\nWe'd love to get your feedback in this solution and if it would work for your company.",

My thought on the matter is, if I am the one that made the modification, why should I have to be notified? Notifications make sense for when someone else has made a notification, not for when I make a notification. If I make a change to an issue in which I am not the creator/watching it I don't get notified, this practice seems correct. So the issue seems to be that if I created/watch the issue I get notified of every change regardless if I made the change or someone else did. I purpose that a change be made so that regardless of your notification settings, you do not get notified of changes made by yourself.",

Problem Definition\r\n\r\nThere is no way to search via JQL to get accurate results in regards to issues / comments were a user has been @Mentioned For example, users have noted that you can sometimes get results for an advanced JQL query such as\r\n{code:java}\r\ncomment ~ currentUser() \r\n{code}\r\nHowever the ~ operator is unsupported for use with that function per [Advanced searching - functions reference - Atlassian Documentation|https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirasoftwarecloud/advanced-searching-functions-reference-764478342.html#Advancedsearching-functionsreference-currentUsercurrentUser()].\r\n\r\nAlso trying to search with a more basic set of terms like \r\n{code:java}\r\ncomment ~ username\r\n{code}\r\ncan sometimes return results, but in the current state of Jira Cloud it is not providing consistent\u00a0 expected results (sometimes you see @ mentions here but not always), and given the recent changes to usernames in Atlassian Cloud, there does not appear to be a way to search via JQL for message content that includes @mentions\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nCreating a JQL function that can search for @ Mentions would be ideal\r\n Or extending the comment field to be searchable by user accounts mentioned within it\r\nh3. Why this is important\r\n\r\nIt would be very helpful to be able to search, filter, and generally organize issues where you have been mentioned directly.\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nNone\r\nh3.
