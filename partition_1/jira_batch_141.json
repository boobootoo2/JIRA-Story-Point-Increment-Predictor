We have around 70 repos and until yesterday had NEVER seen this message before. I've double and triple checked and made sure all local branches are tracking the remote branch correctly.\r\n\r\nTo replicate I just right click on the name of my local branch in the left and choose \"Pull origin/develop (tracked)\".\r\n\r\nAs you can imagine the popup message is becoming quite annoying. I don't want to tick the \"Don't ask again\" checkbox because I DO want to be notified when I'm pulling from a non-tracked branch \r\n\r\nHope you guys can help out here.\r\n\r\nThanks",

That would mean that my local repository is clean before I can finish a feature. In that case, I'd like to be prompted that I have local changes before the branch is closed and the merge is performed so that I can cancel the operation and revert my local changes or shelve them.

Right now, SourceTree presents the \"Show Full Output\" control when running a command, with the option in the prefs to \"Always display full console output\".   But there's two problems with this approach.  First, if the\"always display\" option isn't checked, then the \"Show full output\" control is almost useless - the popup window disappears as soon as the command is completed, and it's a race of one's mouse to click that button before the whole window disappears.  If the \"always display\" option is checked, then I get a modal dialogue window stuck open on every operation, even when I run an external command to open my editor, which is really annoying.\r\n\r\nWhat would be nicest would be a new window that is just a traditional \"running console\" of operations, which could be affixed as a pane within the window, such as on the lower left.   Then one could scroll through this to see everything that was happening as needed without the need to click open any windows or close any modal dialogues. ",

A conflict for these files was expected and happened on the command line but not in SourceTree.\r\n\r\nIt may be related to the fact that SourceTree uses a merge helper tool (merge-tools.sourcetreebulkmerge), this is to prevent hg from prompting to resolve conflicts for every file as the 'hg merge' runs, and instead to create the 'chevron' files which can be resolved later at the user's discretion.

The drop-down isn't the easiest to use, either, as if there are a lot of branches checked out, it will be cut off near the top of the screen and necessitate scrolling. Going back and forth from \"All Branches\" yields a lot of moving around the tree that isn't necessary.\r\n\r\nMy suggestion is that selecting a branch should force the filter to \"selected branch + current branch\". Selecting the current branch would bring it back to \"current branch only\".

      "description": "When cloning a git repo confusion can arise due to interaction between the destination path and bookmark name fields.\r\n\r\nWhen I add a git url and then select a destination path, the folder selected for destination is used as the bookmark name. This is contrary to native git behaviour where git clones the repo into a folder within the destination.\r\n\r\neg: cloning git@github.com:foo/foobar.git into /users/john/projects results in a local /users/my/projects/foobar\r\n\r\nWith the current SourceTree behaviour I need to manually append the bookmark name to the destination path. If I don't do this then what happens is: 'git@github.com:foo/foobar.git' is cloned as the name 'projects' in '/users/john' destination.\r\n\r\nThis behaviour has caught me out a few times. I've also seen a number of git novices using SourceTree have major confusion about where their projects have been cloned to.\r\n\r\nIt would be helpful if the application did the following:\r\n\r\n1. Default the bookmark name to the git repo name (e.g. foobar)\r\n2. Append the bookmark name to the destination path.\r\n\r\nAppending to the destination path might be problematic since we have to modify the path after each selection (and avoid duplicating the appended value). For a potential approach have a look at GitExtensions (Windows). They have the destination path field contain the parent folder. Then directly below they have a read-only field that displays the destination path with the bookmark name appended with some copy saying this is where the repo will be cloned to. Its a little ugly but its very clear what is going to happen - I can change the destination or the name and the impact is alway reflected back to me. \r\n\r\nI hope you are able to address this issue. Its the one difficulty I have with an otherwise excellent application.\r\n",
