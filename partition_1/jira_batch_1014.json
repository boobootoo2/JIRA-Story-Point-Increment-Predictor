I went back to the project settings, and assigned the \"Default Notification Scheme\" to the project, which has sufficient settings for our needs.\n\nAfter making this change, I can see new mail messages added to the queue when the events fire.\n\nHowever, the messages never clear from the queue.  If I click the \"Flush Mail Queue\" link, the messages never leave the queue.\n\nI can use the \"Send a Test Email\" message functionality successfully.\n\nAnother oddity: Only the notification generated messages refuse to send.  If I create a new account, I see the Account Created message go in the queue, and if I flush the queue, it gets sent fine, but the three \"Comment\" messages above it are ignored.\n\n\nI checked the \"catalina.out\" file and found a lot of error messages.  Here is a snippet:\n\nrecipients.size() = 0\njava.lang.NumberFormatException: null\n        at java.lang.Integer.parseInt(Integer.java:394)\n        at java.lang.Integer.parseInt(Integer.java:476)\n        at com.atlassian.jira.mail.IssueMailQueueItem.getIssueContextParams(IssueMailQueueItem.java:151)\n        at com.atlassian.jira.mail.IssueMailQueueItem.send(IssueMailQueueItem.java:104)\n        at com.atlassian.jira.mail.MailQueueImpl.sendBuffer(MailQueueImpl.java:52)\n        at com.atlassian.jira.web.action.admin.MailQueueAdmin.doExecute(MailQueueAdmin.java:24)\n        at webwork.action.ActionSupport.execute(ActionSupport.java:116)\n        at com.atlassian.jira.action.JiraActionSupport.execute(JiraActionSupport.java:44)\n        at webwork.dispatcher.GenericDispatcher.executeAction(GenericDispatcher.java:113)\n        at webwork.dispatcher.ServletDispatcher.service(ServletDispatcher.java:161)\n        at javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet.service(HttpServlet.java:853)\n        at org.apache.catalina.core.ApplicationFilterChain.internalDoFilter(ApplicationFilterChain.java:247)\n        at org.apache.catalina.core.ApplicationFilterChain.doFilter(ApplicationFilterChain.java:193)\n        at com.opensymphony.module.sitemesh.filter.PageFilter.parsePage(PageFilter.java:129)\n        at com.opensymphony.module.sitemesh.filter.PageFilter.doFilter(PageFilter.java:61)\n        at com.atlassian.jira.web.filters.SitemeshExcludePathFilter.doFilter(SitemeshExcludePathFilter.java:40)\n        at org.apache.catalina.core.ApplicationFilterChain.internalDoFilter(ApplicationFilterChain.java:213)\n        at org.apache.catalina.core.ApplicationFilterChain.doFilter(ApplicationFilterChain.java:193)\n        at com.atlassian.core.security.SecurityFilter.doFilter(SecurityFilter.java:170)\n        at org.apache.catalina.core.ApplicationFilterChain.internalDoFilter(ApplicationFilterChain.java:213)\n        at org.apache.catalina.core.ApplicationFilterChain.doFilter(ApplicationFilterChain.java:193)\n        at com.atlassian.core.security.LoginFilter.doFilter(LoginFilter.java:190)\n        at org.apache.catalina.core.ApplicationFilterChain.internalDoFilter(ApplicationFilterChain.java:213)\n        at org.apache.catalina.core.ApplicationFilterChain.doFilter(ApplicationFilterChain.java:193)\n        at com.atlassian.util.profiling.filters.ProfilingFilter.doFilter(ProfilingFilter.java:132)\n        at org.apache.catalina.core.ApplicationFilterChain.internalDoFilter(ApplicationFilterChain.java:213)\n        at org.apache.catalina.core.ApplicationFilterChain.doFilter(ApplicationFilterChain.java:193)\n        at com.atlassian.jira.web.filters.AppConsistencyFilter.doFilter(AppConsistencyFilter.java:112)\n        at org.apache.catalina.core.ApplicationFilterChain.internalDoFilter(ApplicationFilterChain.java:213)\n        at org.apache.catalina.core.ApplicationFilterChain.doFilter(ApplicationFilterChain.java:193)\n        at com.atlassian.jira.web.filters.EncodingFilter.doFilter(EncodingFilter.java:48)\n        at org.apache.catalina.core.ApplicationFilterChain.internalDoFilter(ApplicationFilterChain.java:213)\n        at org.apache.catalina.core.ApplicationFilterChain.doFilter(ApplicationFilterChain.java:193)\n        at org.apache.catalina.core.StandardWrapperValve.invoke(StandardWrapperValve.java:260)\n\n\nI'll add the full error message as an attachment (it's long).\n\n\n",

The \"Fix for Version\" field would have been extremely useful to display in this particular filter. It would also be helpful to be able to predefine a sort field for a filter, though this is easily corrected by clicking the field after the filter results display (it is a bit annoying to have to go through this extra step though).\n\nI was debating whether this was Major or Minor priority and finally decided on Major because not having selectable fields in the filters severely hampers the capability and usefulness of the filters, though they are still very helpful as is.",

      "description": "Previously, I used to jump directly to issues by entering the number in the search box at the top right of the screen.  This was particularly useful when checking through issues prior to a release to make sure e.g. the Fixed In version has been set properly (I had a list of ones to be checked).\n\nSince our (XDoclet's) JIRA recently got upgraded to 2.3, this no longer works.  Instead of jumping to the issue, it runs a query searching for the issue no. in summary & description fields.  This would be reasonable enough, except that the issue whose number I entered in the search field is rarely one of those listed...\n\nFor example, browse the XDoclet project at http://opensource.atlassian.com/projects/xdoclet/secure/Dashboard.jspa and try entering \"XDT-557\" in the search field.  This is a new issue (that I only created less than half an hour ago), so there should be no way anything else has referred to it yet.  However, 14 issues are returned in the list, none of which is XDT-557 itself!  At least if XDT-557 had been included, I could get to it with a single mouse click (not quite as streamlined as the old behaviour, but I could live with it).\n\nPerhaps the issue number could be added to the fields used by the Quick Search?",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-2018].\n  {panel}\n\nConcerning permission scheme administration, we've got a proposal to relieve some stress of a jira admin ;-)\r\n\r\nCurrently it's possible to copy an existing scheme. However, the new scheme is called \"copy of ...\" and contains the exact same groups as its ancestor (the original). Usually we want to copy a scheme but we want the same \"kind\" of groups in the new scheme but they have different names. An example.\r\n\r\nSuppose we've got a project called XXXX with its associated permission scheme XXXX.\r\n\r\nPermission scheme XXXX contains the following groups:\r\n-          XXXX-users\r\n-          XXXX-developers\r\n-          XXXX-administrators\r\n\r\nWe create a new project YYYY and want permission scheme YYYY. For this group YYYY we want the same groups as in scheme XXXX with different but analogous names.\r\n\r\nScheme YYYY\r\n-          YYYY-users\r\n-          YYYY-developers\r\n-          YYYY-administrators\r\n\r\nSo, actually, these were a lot of words to ask only for a possibility to do a \"find/replace\" when copying a permission scheme. Automatically creating the new groups of the new scheme if they don't exist yet is yet another small thing to make the life of an admin a little less painful :-)",
