Set up one as a subtree of the other ([example procedure|https://makingsoftware.wordpress.com/2013/02/16/using-git-subtrees-for-repository-separation/]).\r\n# Open the main project repository in SourceTree. You should see the subtree connection under the Subtrees heading.\r\n# Pull the subtree.

(You can try it with or without squashing commits but for me it crashes with a similar backtrace either way.)\r\n# The command-line tool crashes.
