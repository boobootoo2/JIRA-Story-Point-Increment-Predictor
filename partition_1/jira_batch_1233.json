We highly value your feedback in all forms, and through suggestions in jira.atlassian.com is not different. We use this channel often to learn the best we can with how customers use JIRA and how we can continue to improve the experience for as many users as possible.\n\nWe have revisited this issue again recently and wanted to reiterate that there are still currently no plans to implement this suggestion, and it is not currently on any JIRA team\u2019s roadmap at this stage. The overall experience of Importing/Exporting both singular and multiple projects is something we will be looking at in the future however, and we would love for you all to keep commenting and helping us make sure that when we do tackle this, we do so in the most focused way possible. \n\nPlease remember that jira.atlassian.com is one of many inputs for the JIRA roadmap. You can [learn more about our process here|https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/110373/how-does-the-jira-team-use-jira-atlassian-com].\n\nI understand that our decision may be disappointing. Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.\n\n\nRegards,\nKerrod Williams\nKerrod (dot) Williams (at) atlassian (dot) com\nProduct Manager, JIRA\n\n{panel}\n\nIn order to move a project between two different instances, an user must export a whole XML backup from the source instance, and will only import one project in the target. \n\nFor huge instances, where there are over 400 projects, exporting a full XML backup may result in performance issues during the time it takes for the backup to complete, and as exporting all 400 projects is not necessary to only import one project, it would be good if it was possible to export only one single project to be imported into another instance.",

This can be very handy especially if used in conjunction with a special handler.\n\nAn example:\n\n  @Option(name=\"--index\" , aliases=\"-i\" , usage=\"index bean                (index)\"  , metaVar=\"<index>\", defaults=\"index\", handler=OptionHandlerBean.class)\n  private Index index;\n\nThe OptionHandlerBean accesses an application context to receive an Index instance. If it is not specified, the OptionHandlerBean is invoked as if \"index\" would be given as an option. Of course you could give a default value for the index variable but this does not address a situation where the default value must be closed.\n\nAn other example is an OutputStream:\n\n  @Option(name=\"--out\", handler=OptionHandlerOutputStream.class)\n  private OutputStream outputStream = new FileOutputStream(\"fufu\");\n\nhere, the benefit of a default value becomes obvious: the OutputStream to \"fufu\" will not be closed once the option is defined.\n\n\nRight now, I am using a patched version of args4j to address this situation:\n\nOption.java:\n\n    /**\n     * Defines a default value that will be applied if this option was not set\n     * explicitely.\n     */\n    String[] defaults() default { };\n\nOptionDef.java:\n\nprivate final String[] defaults;\n\n  public OptionDef(Argument a, boolean forceMultiValued) {\n    this(a.usage(), a.metaVar(), a.required(), a.hidden(), a.handler(), a.multiValued() || forceMultiValued, null);//XXX overlay\n  }\n\n  protected OptionDef(String usage, String metaVar, boolean required,\n      boolean hidden, Class<? extends OptionHandler> handler,\n      boolean multiValued, String[] aDefaults) {\n    this.usage = usage;\n    this.metaVar = metaVar;\n    this.required = required;\n    this.hidden = hidden;\n    this.handler = handler;\n    this.multiValued = multiValued;\n    defaults = aDefaults;//XXX overlay\n  }\n\n  public String[] getDefaults() {\n    return Arrays.clone(defaults);\n  }\n\nNamedOptionDef.java:\n\n    public NamedOptionDef(Option o) {\n      super(o.usage(),o.metaVar(),o.required(),o.hidden(),o.handler(), false, o.defaults());\n...\n\nand I am using an extended CmdLineParser that handles the defaults values. Unfortunately I am forced to use Reflection to access the \"options\" value in CmdLineParser.java (since it is private).\n\nIf you are interested I can provide the full source of my patch.",

Linked with assignees and Jira keys. \nThis would make more efficient dialogue through Jira, and quicker responses. \n\nBackground: \nOur main goal for using Jira is to get a structured and efficient dialogue, where information becomes available in most convenient location for everyone. Comments can of course bring dialogue into Jira, but people might get lost in the not always structured flow of items here, and the questions are hidden for people not actively reading the issue.\n\nQuestions and Answers might improve communication in the following way\n- It will indicate a very clear request for a piece of information, that will be met with another defined piece that fills this need. \n- It may indicate that this can and should be handled quickly\n- Different questions can be addressed to different people, without having to reassign the entire issue.\n- It can be made visible in many different contexts, to get attention. Having five question listed on the dashboard can inspire a quick response for all of them. It's harder to get a response if five issues are added to an already long list of issues with the questions hidden somewhere within a lot of comments. \n\nUse case: \nIn an issue  I need different clarifications to move on. I trigger a question box and write [@user This is my question]. \nAfter finishing a question I can write another one, or close the box.\nThe addressed users can be noticed about a new question in many ways, easily being able to give a quick response or route the question to someone else.\nA new tab in the issue can give an overview over the questions asked along with responses. \n\nThe minor implementation is only Question and Answer items, which should make a fairly simple implementation but further functionality might be considered, at least when planning the architecture. \n- The responsible for the question could sign off the response with a value. (Something like OK | NotOk | NewQuestion)\n- Follow up questions could be put in context\n- There might be a description field for more thorough background information for the question itself, to make sure the main question is kept clear and simple.

This appears in the upper right under Dates - Created: as well as under the Activity tab. However, both Dates - Created: and Activity tab only shows relative time (e.g. \"1 hour ago\"), and is approximate. Furthermore, the times often differ (e.g. Dates - Created: says \"2 hours ago\" while Activity tab issue created at says \"1 hour ago\").\n\nWhat I'm looking for is a way to see the exact time (date + hour + minute) that the issue was created. This capability existed in Jira 4 (e.g. https://java.net/jira/browse/GLASSFISH-11389) but does not exist in the latest Jira.\n\nSee this post for on going discussion https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/194581/exact-time-a-jira-issue-was-created",
