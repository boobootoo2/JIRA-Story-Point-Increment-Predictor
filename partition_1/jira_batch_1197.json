The search text would be added to ALL of the searches used for that dashboard.  \n\nFor example, I could add the search text \"AND SomeField=SomeValue\".  This text would be added to the search text for each widget.  So if the first widget used the search text \"project=aa and Field1=bb\" then the modified search text would be \"project=aa and Field1=bb AND SomeField=SomeValue\"\n\nHere is my use case:\n\nI have about 6 dashboards that are all identical to each other except for one thing:  Each dashboard has a unique value for one attribute in the searches that are used for that dashboard.  \n\nTo make this happen I start by creating a set of searches which are used by my dashboard widgets.  Then I need to copy all of those searches and modify this one attribute in all of them.  Then I copy the dashboard and edit all of the gadgets to use the new searches.  It is a lot of work.  But worse, if I need to modify any of my searches then I need to modify all 6 copies.\n\n\n ",

It determines, for example, if a link to the issue should have a strikethrough or not.\n\nAlso, [the documentation|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Defining+Resolution+Field+Values] states that a user shouldn't create an 'Unresolved' resolutions, because JIRA will not handle the issue as 'Unresolved' when using this resolution.\n\nThis approach has a very problematic characteristic: the resolution field is mandatory, but it not being set has a meaning! It is unresolved.\n\nThis brings a few problems:\n* There is no flexibility. The users need to either use a post function and trigger a transition or change in the database in case they want to change a resolved issue to 'unresolved'\n* We cannot add the 'resolution' field to the 'Edit' Screen for an issue type in a project. If that is done, the user must always set the resolution when editing the issue, even if they wanted to change a completely different field\n\nMy suggestion is to add a 'Unresolved' resolution, rather than understanding it as unresolved when this field is not set. It would have the following characteristics:\n* This resolution cannot be deleted or modified\n* This is a _special_ resolution. When an issue has this resolution, JIRA considers it as unresolved (no strikethrough, etc.)\n* You need permission to set as unresolved (otherwise, only the other options will appear)\n* If the issue is set as unresolved, it can remain that way, no need to change it when editing an issue.\n\nI think this resolves a question:\nHow can a required field give a meaning to an unset value?",

Summary\nIn the notification scheme, no one is set to receive Issue Updated, but users are set to receive Issue Commented. When a comment is added via email, nobody gets notification. When a comment is added via UI, they get notification for Issue Commented.\n\nAfter some testing I found that commenting via email will trigger Issue Updated, that is the reason users don't receive notification even though they are supposed to receive for Issue Commented. By right commenting via email and UI should behave the same and trigger Issue Commented and users should get notification.\n\nh4. Steps to reproduce\n# Install JIRA\n# Configure Incoming Mail Handler (Create a new issue or add a comment to an existing issue) and Outgoing Mail\n# Remove everyone from *Issue Updated* event but make sure they receive notifications from *Issue Commented* event\n# Have a user add a comment to a particular issue via email\n\nh4. Expected Results\n# Comment added successfully\n# Designated users receive notification\n# Notification sent with *Issue Commented* event\n\nh4. Actual Results\n# Comment added successfully\n# No notification received by users who supposed to receive *Issue Commented* event\n\nh4. Notes\n* When the users are configured to receive notification from *Issue Updated* event, then commenting via email will send notifications to the designated users\n* Affecting with JIRA 6.3.10 and 6.3.12\n* With 6.2.7, notification will be of *Issue Commented* event (intended behavior)",

The field turns into an input so new text can be provided, but the input field behaves like a text area where only 1 line is visible at a time. That is, text is scrolled vertically. This makes it *very* difficult to edit a multi-line summary.\nFor example: Let's say a story has the summary: \"As a student, I can see my grades online so that I don't have to wait until I get to school to know whether I'm passing\" If I edit the summary then I see an input field that does not show the entire text. I see the text \"As a student, I can see my grades online so\" with the cursor at the beginning (window width determines how much text is visible). If I move the cursor to the end of the text field (hit end key) then the cursor is at 'so' and I have to hit the down or right key to be able to see the 2nd line of text.\n\nIdeally I would be able to see a multi-line input so I could clearly see what I'm editing, but I would settle at least for normal behavior of an input field where text is scrolled horizontally rather than vertically.\n",

After adding Group 1 to global permission *JIRA Administrators*, we add Group 1 to JIRA Users global permission and it works just fine.\n\nh6. Actual Behaviour\n\nWhen adding Grupo 1 to the global permission *JIRA Users*, after having added it to the group *JIRA Administrators*, the following error message is displayed and the group can't be added:\n\n{quote}\nThe group 'Grupo 1' is not allowed to be added to the permission 'JIRA Users'\n{quote}\n\n\nh6. Workaround\n\nInstead of adding the group to JIRA Administrators and then to JIRA Users, adding the group to JIRA Users and THEN JIRA Administrators works fine\n\n*Update* : The behaviour above (workaround) is actually a bug, this is being tracked at JRA-37733.",

I understand why this needed to be done but it's definitely a loss (see original issue for discussion on that). \n\nI could use the new Browse Projects view if the *table columns were sortable*. Then I'd just click the project category column to sort it and have something close to what I had before. Even better (but not critical) would be to have a \"printable\" view of this page that listed all projects using the current column sorting. \n\nSo I'm making this enhancement request. \n\nUse case is that I produce a weekly report for management listing current projects, grouped by category. I used the previous view to produce this but I can't easily produce it using the new view or any other workaround suggested by Support or Product Management.\n",

Every day we have our stand up and we look at the Task Board.  Sometimes the board looks exactly the same as it did the day before, and that is bad.  But it can be hard to tell exactly what has changed.  We use the burndown chart and I get emailed notifications when tickets are updated but it would still be nice to have a super easy way to see what the Task Board looked like the day before.  Maybe a report where you can select the Task Board for a given date and it would show you what the board looked like then.

I use Configuration Manager to make the snapshots and the deployment to the other instance.  So, the user should get his project and all associated elements, but not the dashboard(s) or his filters.  Can I move the dashboard independently for the user through other means?\n\nTeilor Soares [Atlassian]about 6 hours ago\nHi Chris!\nAt this moment is not possible to export or import a dashboard. The only way to export a dashboard would be export the entire instance.\n-Teilor\n CommentAccept answer\nPeter Benabout 6 hours ago\nTelior, do we have a JIRA ticket for this feature? Thanks\nTeilor Soares [Atlassian]about 4 hours ago\nNo, we do not. You can create a new feature request in jira.atlassian.com. \n\n============================================\nThank you for considering this feature suggestion.\n\nChris",
