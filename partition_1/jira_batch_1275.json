But we will use same crowd service for this JIRA instance before migrating projects. \n* I need to export all projects from JIRA 4.3, then import these projects into JIRA 4.4\n\nMy questions are:\n\n* Do you have any special documentation for migrating projects from JIRA 4.3 into JIRA 4.4? Is it same process in this article? http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Restoring+a+Project+from+Backup\n\n* As the users' account and groups are considered mandatory for importing projects. As both JIRA instances are connecting to CROWD (not configured at same time).So can users'account & groups from JIRA 4.3 still be found by JIRA 4.4 via CROWD?\n \n** If no, is it possible to export DB (userbase) from JIRA 4.3 (or from CROWD?), importing into JIRA 4.4 (or into same CROWD?) with remaining same users' password?\n** Do you have any other way to make this work?\n\nThanks. \n\nRegards\n\nSjedi",

Is the plugin present and enabled?\n{code}\n\nHere's the answer from Atlassian. For more details and a discussion around this issue, see JSP-94659. \n\n{quote}\nHi Peter,\n\nThe error is actually due to the process JIRA uses to load functions/plugins and is harmless. Basically JIRA first loads the system required bundled-plugins, then it is followed by user-installed plugins. The error occurs between this process, before the user-installed plugins are loaded.\n\nThe Charting plugin adds multiple functionalities to JIRA, this includes adding 2 custom field types: 'First Response Time' and 'Time in Status'. This means that it is necessary for the plugin classes to be loaded for these customfield types to work. So basically when you restart JIRA, it will load the system bundled plugins and detect the customfields. This is where JIRA sees these customfields, but cannot match it with an associated class. After this, the user-plugins loads, aka the Charting Plugin and its classes, and everything works fine.\n\nSo in short, the error is thrown due to the startup procedures taken by JIRA. This is a harmless error.\n\nRegards,\n\nDavid Chan\nAtlassian Support\n{quote}\n\nEven though the suggestion is to ignore it, it is still an error and proper care should be taken of this. Unfortunately, as long as errors are logged, they should be addressed -- and not ignored. ",

[See the corresponding bug report|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-26208].\n  {panel}\n\nh3. Summary\nThere is currently no method to prevent sub-task creation on a specific workflow status.\n\nThe following Workflow Properties have no effect on users being able to create sub-tasks.\n* {{jira.permission.create}}\n* {{jira.permission.subtasks.create}}\n\nAdministrators are unable prevent users from creating Sub-tasks with this current bug. When viewing an issue in the state where that permission _should_ be locked down, there is still an option for creating a sub-task.\n\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\nJIRA 6.3 was used to replicate this issue:\n\n# Open the Workflow Editor (\"Administration -> Projects -> <SELECTED-PROJECT> -> Workflow -> Edit)\n# Add the following Workflow Properties to one of the steps: \n* {{jira.permission.create}} and set to {{denied}}\n* {{jira.permission.subtasks.create}} and set to {{denied}}\n# Publish the edited workflow\n# Create a new issue for <SELECTED-PROJECT> and transition to the edited Step (Issue Status).\n# Attempt to create a new \"Sub-task\" for the issue. Observe that the user is able to do so.\n# Observe that this \"Sub-Task\" is created and linked to the issue.\n\nh3. Expected Results\nThe workflow property should have prevented the Sub-Task from being created.\n\nh3. Actual Results\nThe workflow property had no effect on the User's ability to create a new Sub-Task.\n\nh3. Notes\n* Attached Screenshots for all windows showing the settings applied when demonstrating this issue. (JIRA 4.4)\n* Specifically: One of the permissions is the Create permission, which was denied to everyone.\n* When viewing an issue in the state where that permission should be locked down, there is still the option for creating a sub-task.\n* User was able to click on \"Create Sub-Task\" and create a sub-task which looks fine and shows that it is a sub-task of the parent issue.  However, when you go back to the parent issue, you do not see any sub-tasks for that issue. (JIRA 4.4)\n* The last part of the parent not knowing of it's sub-tasks is not very important because the first part of a sub-task still being able to be created shouldn't even be available or allowed based on the permissions that i set in the state of the workflow. (JIRA 4.4)\n* [JRA-10077|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRA-10077] - Mentions a suggestion to refactor some of the permissions relating sub-task creation.\n\nh3. Workaround\nIn some circumstances users can prevent all edits to an issue at a specific workflow status:\n# Edit the project Workflow, as per: [Configuring Workflow|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA063/Configuring+Workflow]\n# Click \"View Properties\" for the targeted step.\n# Add a new property {{jira.issue.editable}} with value {{false}} (as per [Workflow properties|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA063/Workflow+properties])\n# Publish the edited workflow.\n\nThis will prevent *all* edits being made to an issue when at the defined state. The workaround can be used to prevent the user from creating sub-tasks on closed or resolved issues.",

I've checked briefly logs and there seems to be nothing strange.\n\nThe following 2 mails came and the link points to the second ticket (the one that came first):\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \nDelivered-To: syrovy.jiri@gmail.com\nReceived: by 10.236.136.163 with SMTP id w23cs105396yhi;\n        Mon, 7 Nov 2011 11:54:11 -0800 (PST)\nReceived: by 10.204.14.208 with SMTP id h16mr20949289bka.2.1320695649495;\n        Mon, 07 Nov 2011 11:54:09 -0800 (PST)\nReturn-Path: <podpora@hkfree.org>\nReceived: from mail.hkfree.org (relay.hkfree.org.

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-26175].\n  {panel}\n\n    Jira uses binary ordering for the project name instead of using better alphabetical order even if the database is set otherwise. For example in Oracle we set our database so that NLS_SORT is French. This causes the database to not make the difference between accentuated letters and non accentuated ones. This means that an \"\u00c9\" is like an \"E\".\n\n    This means that if you have the following project names : \"Assurance\", \"Cadre de gestion\", \"Engagement\", \"\u00c9valuation\" and \"Suivi des dossiers\", the order written before is the good one. But Jira will write \"\u00c9valuation\" as the last one. Since we have around 30 projects it's annoying that the \"\u00c9valuation\" project does not appear where it belongs in the alphabetical order.\n\n    This happens in all the place where projects are listed, i.e. the create issues screen, the project list page, in the project gadget, etc.\n\n    Jira should rely on the order set by the database or have a parameter to set the way Jira works.\n\n\n    I've contacted customer support, who told me to open an improvement request. If you want to see the support ticket it's JSP-95853.\n\n    I also included a screenshot that shows the top and the bottom of the project list. You will see the \"\u00c9valuation financi\u00e8re des conditions de travail\" project at the end of the list instead of before the \"Formulaire d'admissibilit\u00e9 44/48\" project.\n\n",

(The plugin just contains the atlassian-plugin.xml with system.preset.filters) \nOur problem is now, that we need to add the items for our custom field 'customer' by the plugin. \nAlternativly, we could create a custom field of the type 'select list' with our customers as items within the plugin.\nWe searched for this in the 'JIRA Plugin Guide' but couldn't find an plugin module which gives this possibility. \n(We found the 'Custom Field Plugin Module' and found there, how to create a new type of custom field, but not, how to create a custom field using an already existing type.) \nPlease, could you give us a reference to how to resolve this?",

Instead we want to only use the labels customfields.  Right now, in jira 4.2-4.4.3, we have to \"hide\" the Labels field in the field configurations so it does not appear on the screen.  Unfortunately, the Labels menu item is still appearing on the Actions menu and the Issue Navigator Action Cog even though we have \"hidden\" this field in the field configuration scheme.  This allows the users to still edit the Labels field, which causes unneeded issue updates that appear in the issue history and send updates to the users.

We recently implemented JRA-14369, which resolves several of the improvements described on this issue \u2013 specifically, you can now selectively add and remove values during a bulk edit operation for JIRA's system multi-select fields, including labels, components, affects versions, and fix versions.\n\nWe have decided to close this ticket because we have no plans to address the remaining requests around label management. Our intent is to ensure that there is a functional difference between Components and Labels. One is a lightweight \"tag\" that any user can create, one is a set of objects created by a project administrator. We would prefer to extend the capabilities of each of these features individually, rather than allow their functionality to overlap more than it already does.\n\nWe expect the new bulk edit functionality to make it substantially easier to correct cases where you need to \"merge\" labels. There is also a [free add-on on the Atlassian Marketplace|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/ca.uwo.jira.plugins.labelbot] to assist with this.\n\nPlease don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.\n\nRegards,\nDave Meyer\nProduct Manager, JIRA Platform\n{panel}\n\nWouldn't it be nice to have a way to manage Labels, maybe from the Project Administration screen? Currently there is not a way to mass manage Labels. Doing a Bulk Edit on a set of issues replaces (removes) all current Labels with only the new label for all issues, instead of adding the new label to the existing label set for each issue. This makes Bulk Editing Labels almost useless, since it is very uncommon to have issues with all existing Labels in common. Being able to Bulk Add/Remove/Rename a label, would be incredibly convenient. \n\nWouldn't it be nice to be able to merge Labels? Sometime users will create different Labels which essentially mean the same thing, management should be able to merge these Labels. For instance 'grey' + 'gray' >> 'grey'.\n\nWouldn't it be nice for management to be able to lock-down Labels? Sometimes users are just down right bad at creating appropriate Labels, and once a bad label is created, other users start using it as well. Maybe from Project Administration, administrators could create a set of Labels to be used in that project, and then users could only select from that set of Labels. If a user really feels like they need a new label it could always be requested.",

The requests go through the firewall because the baseURL variable is set to the NAT address of the instance. Of course it's possible to change the baseURL to localhost, but then links in e-mail subscriptions and notifications wouldn't work any longer. \n\nThat's why I think a seperation into an internal and external baseURL would be very helpful. External baseURL could be used in e-mail notifications. Internal baseURL could be used for operations/requests that don't leave the domain like the refresh of a gadget.\n\nI already had opened a support request https://support.atlassian.com/browse/JSP-95077. There I was pointed here.\n\nDo you need any additional information? If there's already a workaround or a another solution I really would appreciate to read about it.\n\nKind regards,\nFalk",

We handle this by having a single Jira account appear as default reporter when the email is imported.\n\nThe problem our customer service representatives have when working these tickets is that they have no idea who the email is from or who it was sent to (other than the Jira account). To resolve this, I created a patch for CreateIssueHandler.java that modifies the recordedFromAddressForAnon method. The modification expands on the \"[Created via email received from: ... ]\" tag line and adds another line below \"[Created via email sent to: ... ]\".\n\nI would like to request that this be incorporated into future versions of Jira.\n\nHere's the updated module code:\n\nprivate String recordFromAddressForAnon(User reporter, Message message, String description) throws MessagingException\n{\n// If the message has been created for an anonymous user add the senders e-mail address to the description.\nif (reporteruserName != null && reporteruserName.equals(reporter.getName()))\n{\ndescription += \"\\n[Created via e-mail \";\nif (message.getFrom() != null && message.getFrom().length > 0)\n\n{ description += \"received from: \" + message.getFrom()[0] + \"]\"; }\nelse\n\n{ description += \"but could not establish sender's address.]\"; }\ndescription += \"\\n[Created via email sent to: \";\nif(message.getAllRecipients() != null && message.getAllRecipients().length > 0)\n{\nAddress[] addresses = message.getAllRecipients();\nfor(int i=0; i < addresses.length; i++) { description += addresses[i] + \" \"; }\ndescription += \"]\";\n}\nelse\n{ description += \"but could not establish reciever's address(es).]\"; }\n} \nelse\n{\ndescription += \"\\n[Created via email sent to: \";\nif(message.getAllRecipients() != null && message.getAllRecipients().length > 0)\n{\nAddress[] addresses = message.getAllRecipients();\nfor(int i=0; i < addresses.length; i++) { description += addresses[i] + \" \"; }\t}\ndescription += \"]\";\n}\nelse\n\n{ description += \"but could not establish reciever's address(es).]\"; }\n}\nreturn description;\n}",

The info note on the JIRA close issue form even states \"Closing an issue indicates that there is no more work to be done on it, and that it has been verified as complete,\" which indicates to me that zeroing the remaining time is the expected behavior. This was partially mitigated when using GreenHopper as the close/resolve screens had the default option to zero the remaining time, but this useful feature has been removed from those GreenHopper screens.\n\nRequiring every user to manually add post functions is error-prone and places an undue burden on the end-user. I would prefer this action to be part of the default system workflow; however, it would be acceptable to provide a second system workflow or the option to add the zeroing behavior to the default.",

When we type any of the following options :\n\nsummary ~ \\\"copies\\\" \nsummary ~ \"copies\" \nsummary ~ copies\n\nJIRA still searches for all words like copy, copying, copy, copies etc.\n\nThere are also certain \"stop words\" that JIRA ignores while searching. SO if we search for  \"not working\", JIRA internally searches for \"working, work, worked\" etc.\n\nThis is not the desirable and caused un-expected behavior for the customers.\n\nRegards,\nRuchi",
