Since we use Crowd for web application SSO the timeout is set to few hours which is not enough for the desktop applications. Now we have to work around the problem by implementing a keep-alive thread that keeps each authentication token valid by refreshing it with Crowd. This creates unnecessary load and feels like a bad solution. A more elegant way would be to keep the expiration handling in Crowd.\r\n\r\nI created a new issue for this, since http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CWD-340 seems to request configurable application timeouts in SSO context. In this case there is no need for SSO because user can't switch for application to another.",

I also had complaints about users being logged in then kicked out and not being able to login in again.  When I looked at the logs I noticed that crowd was not able to connect to the database.  This problem seemed to fix it self with out me doing anything.  I also noticed a lot of deadlock errors.  We have since rolled back going live on crowd until we can get these issues resolved.  I'm including the crowd log file with the errors.\r\n\r\nAlso I will be out of the office until July 7th, so if you need any information from us please contact Jonah Lund at jlund@idsgrp.com.

So I created an OU containing only the groups I need. I used this OU as filter by referencing it in my base DN for groups in the connector configurator: ou=Extranet,ou=Groups.\r\n\r\nIn one way, this works. If I view the list of available groups in Crowd for that directory, it shows just what it should -- the 6 groups I care about. But if I bring up a user record and examine their groups, I see ALL the AD groups they're a part of, not just the filtered ones I care about. If I click into such a group, I do get an inspect/edit screen, but with a red warning bar. If I click from that group into a list of  its users, I see nothing.\r\n\r\nLikewise in Jira, which I integrated with Crowd, I get similar behavior in terms of seeing the additional groups, and being led to belive I can edit/inspect them, then getting warnings and failures.",
