It's great how Portfolio:\r\na. Calculates the remaining estimates and adds them to view at the Epic level and it \r\nb. Allows you to add additional estimates at the Epic level too\r\nHowever, it would be brilliant if it could:\r\n1. Show the Original Estimate and allow it to be added / removed on the column view\r\n2. Show the Work Logged and allow this field to be added / removed onthe column view\r\n3. Rename the existing Time Estimates column header to Remaining so it more clearly maps to the JIRA ticket information itself (took me a while to figure out what it was doing...)\r\n",

      "description": "Hello - I am having an issue with the sprints in my LivePlan being out of order from the Jira sprints. It is not clear how to determine what is causing this. I have entered this as a bug as I do not get an option to create a new support request though I am logged in and can only see historical support requests. \r\n\r\nWe are trying to determine why our releases appear overbooked and this may be part of the cause.The sprints are showing up as follows: S119, S121, S122, S120. They should be in numeric order. S119 is currently started, the rest are not. I have checked that the sprint reference is in sequential order as shown below.\r\n\r\nS119 = 9041\r\nS120 = 9042\r\nS121 = 10539\r\nS122 = 10540\r\n\r\nI have attached a shot of the agile board and the LivePlan showing the sprints. Is this a bug or what should I be doing to determine the cause?\r\n\r\nThank you for your insight on this challenge.",

Problem Summary\r\nWhen new sprints are forecasted by Portfolio, it uses the count of sprints on the plan as basis for the sprint numbering, not the total count or the number of the latest sprint. \r\n\r\nh3. Expected Behavior\r\nUse the same engine as Agile does when forecasting sprints, where it gets the number of the latest sprint.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Behavior\r\nBecause of this, it doesn't matter if I had 30 sprints completed in the past, if I only have 3 active or future sprints, JPO will start counting on Sprint 4.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Create a Scrum Board;\r\n# Create 2 sprints;\r\n# Complete 1 sprint;\r\n# Create a Portfolio plan and connect to the board;\r\n# Forecasted sprints will start on Sprint 2;\r\n\r\nh3.

After we complete planning for an initiative, we create the Epics and stories in Jira and then use the option \"Marking child items as complete\" to close the planning of the the initiative in portfolio and track the progress via Jira sprints and boards. We believe this option would just hide the items in the portfolio. We like this idea of this option because we want a way to indicate planning is done but we can still see what we had planned by selecting to show these items using the status filter. \r\n\r\nWhen I select the option \"Mark child items as complete\" portfolio I found it is resetting the estimate of the stories in Jira. Using this option resets any hours of work the team has logged for the stories setting it back to the original estimate. This causes a blip in the burndown and very sad engineers. \r\n\r\nMy expectation is that marking child items as complete in portfolio would not update anything in Jira.  \r\n\r\nTo repro:\r\nCreate a plan with the estimates set as hours. \r\nCreate one initiative, one epic and a few stories. Set estimates on the stories in portfolio\r\nUse the open to create and link new issues in jira\r\nOpen the new stories and log work for each one. \r\nReturn back to portfolio and select the option \"mark child items as complete\" at the Epic level \r\nReturn back to the stories and see the remaining estimate is set to the original estimate.\r\n\r\nIs this expected? Are there other things that the mark child items as complete does that I should be mindful of? Is using this option in the scenario I have articulated valid?",

Summary\r\n\r\nCurrently the scheduling algorithm uses the stack-ranking of epics to determine scheduling constraints. If an individual creates an initiative later that supersedes another intiative then they have to manually pull up all the epics in that initiative above the epics in another initiative to reflect this relative initiative prioritzation. It would be very helpful if in the scheduling configuration section if you could designate priority on an initiative basis as opposed to an epic basis.\r\n\r\nh2. Background\r\nOur organization is very initiative focused and we determine organizational priorities based on the initiatives. We recently had a late initiative come into place that superseded all other initiatives. As we began to build the plan, bucket work into epics and then stories, some of these high priority epics were seemingly started later than expected causing an unrealistic timeline. This caused a lot of manual work to change the epic prioritization to match the initiative priortization.",

Problem Definition\r\n\r\nAt the moment, the schedule and reports pages only display open tickets (open in the Portfolio-sense, that is decoupled from the actual JIRA issues status). This is due to the fact that the schedule was designed to show future data and requires the items to be displayed to have a calculated start and end date as well as assigned teams, releases, sprints, etc.\r\n\r\nHowever, having an option to show completed issues / historic data in the schedule and reports page would add a lot of value. This would require storing the last calculated values (including start and end dates) on the issue before closing it in Portfolio. It might also require additional filter capabilities b/c including all past issues, the timeline could get significantly longer and more difficult to read.\r\n\r\nh4.
