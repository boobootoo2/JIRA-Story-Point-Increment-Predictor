E.g. a sub-task with a different value in \"Affected Version/s\" than its parent makes no sense IMHO. Same goes for \"Fix Version/s\" if you use this field for both, the version when it got fixed and the version when it should get fixed (as long as it isn't resolved). By default it should also have the same Assignee as its parent, the same priority, and the same labels.\n\nSure, this is not always desirable for all fields to have equal values than the parent but then you can still customize any field in any way you like. I think it covers the >90% case and saves you a lot of typing work when creating sub-tasks. Having to enter everything for each sub-task, even though it's only a single field you want to be different per sub-task (other than the Summary, of course) is just a lot of unnecessary work, methinks.",

Stability and security are the problems that prevent you from allowing to install JIRA plugins into OnDemand.\n\nHowever, I also pretty well understand that it's possible to isolate environments in which different OnDemand instances run to make sure one client will not ruin the other client's systems. Virtualisation fully solves that. So it's possible to solve inter-environment stability and security issues.\n\nStability & security issues at user's own instance are just a matter of sending a clear message to OnDemand customers, saying - \"we carry no responsibility for thirdparty plugins problems\". As long as you allow to install plugins onto the downloaded solution - you are allowing users to ruin themselves in their own selfhosted instances. I don't see then why not allow same thing for Atlassian hosted environment, as long as this will not affect other customers. It will bring major benefit of plugins exchange to OnDemand users. \n\nThanks\nAlex\n\nPS: I've found no paticular project for OnDemand system, so posting to main JIRA project. Please lead me to OnDemand dedicated space, as I have more to post for it.",

While this is technically true, the unfortunate reality is that an error occurs on the creation of the issue as the user is not in the jira-users group. Users must be in jira-users before they can use JIRA.\n\nThe solution to this would be to detect the user is valid (done currently) and also test if they are in the group jira-users (not done). If not in jira-users then they should be auto added to the group - because they are now using jira.\n\nThe significance of this bug is that a user, not in LDAP, actually is better off then a user in LDAP.

On the Issue Navigator, through Tools > Configure Columns I added the \"Story Points\" column. It appears in the \"Re-order columns\" view and I can see populated values.\n\nWhen I click back to \"Issue Navigator\", the column is missing. But, if I filter on *all* issue types (i.e. ensure every issue type in the list is selected) - the story points column magically appears. If I search with just \"Any\" issue type selected however, the Story Points column vanishes again. As far as I can tell, the column is visible whenever I choose any issue type other than \"Any\" - so just choosing 'standard issue types' also makes the column visible.\n\nIn JQL:\nworks - I can see \"Story Points\" column with any of these examples:\n{code}\nissuetype in standardIssueTypes()\nissuetype in (\"New Feature\", epic)\n{code}\n\nA blank JQL query however (equivalent to \"Any\" issue type) does not work - I cannot see \"Story Points\" column.\n\nIt also seems to hide the column if my filter does not select any issue types (such as epic or story) that have stories. So for example, if I filter on \"New Feature\" or \"Bug\", it does not show the story points column. That seems reasonable. It _does_ show the column if my filter includes both \"New Feature\" and Epic (see second JQL above), i.e. one issue type that has story points and one that does not - which is also good. However if I choose \"Any\" issue type, that should include any Epics and Stories and show the associated story points. (it should certainly give the same results as when I individually select all of the possible issue types).\n\nAdditionally, this also affects the 'Export'>>'Excel (All fields)'.  The 'Story Points' field will not be exported if it is not displayed in the issue navigator.  If you adjust the JQL to {code}\"Story Points\" is not EMPTY{code} the export functionality will function as expected. \n\n\n",

If someone has a question after some years, e.g. if a particular bug already showed up during development, he/she can search for that in the stored project documentation and doesn't has to look for it in a lot of different places. Now JIRA bugs are still difficult to archive if you don't want to depend on a JIRA installation in future.\n\nTherefore it would be nice to have the possibility to export a whole JIRA project with all issues, comments and attachments. Exporting format should be HTML, so that it could be viewed offline and the content keeps easily accessible, especially attachments. \n\nThe Word export that already can be used to export a lot of issue data only shows the names of the attachments.

Problem Definition\r\n\r\nThe markdown renderer that Jira Cloud uses only recognizes HTTP-based URL's and URI's. Trying to embed links using other protocols, such as _smb_, _file_, or _doors_, Jira's markdown renderer fails to recognize them as legit hyperlinks.\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nSupport links to other resources that use non http/https protocols\r\nh3. Why this is important\r\n\r\nThis is particular important for teams that have existing internal network storage, and don't want to duplicate where those files are stored by copying them to Jira's attachments. In many cases it would be very helpful for end users that can see a Jira issue, or a JSD request to be able to see links to internal resources in some scenarios.\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nThere are no work-around for this in Jira Cloud at this time. Should one become available this section will be updated to reflect this.",

(This is a real example.)\n1. Type *david* - too many matches\n2. Type *smith* - too many matches\n3. Type *dsmith* - no hit, his username is dpsmith3\n4. Type *david.smith*, attempting an email match - no hit, this sometimes works for us but here his  mail address has been disambiguated to david.p.smith@xxx.  \n\nThis can also happen where there are variations of names, eg, deb/debra, or alternate spellings.  Using a broader target gives too may hits to pick the user but a narrow search misses altogether.\n\nSuggested fixes:\n1. Use a *dot* for an AND search, so _david.smith_ requires a match on _david_ and _smith_ (y)  \n2. Allow scrolling/paging of the full hit list.\n3. All the above.\n\nOption 1 is the snappiest from a usability point of view but paging is probably easier to understand.  A hint \"Displaying 20 of 237 matching users.

The fact that these issues must be closed before the version can be release ensures that no tasks are left behind, allowing an effective enforcement of Software Development Quality Processes.\n\nThe automatic issues to be created can be defined by the project lead (or an administrator), thus allowing JIRA to be tailored to each company's rules.\n\nTo avoid work repetition, one should be able to import automatic issues from one project to another, or to define global rules on JIRA that are inherited by all Projects. The inherited rules can then be tailored to the project's specific rules.",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-26297].\n  {panel}\n\nPlease polish the content I am providing below and include it in JIRA 4.4.4 release notes (or perhaps rather summarise it with a sentence or two and link to a separate page with more details).\n\nAs described in JRA-26239, we decided to break backward compatibility in JIRA 4.4.4 release with respect to a piece of the API related to mail handling (which, as far as we know, is not used often).\n\nh2. Incompatibilities\n\nJIRA 4.4.4 includes a dependency on {{atlassian-mail}} version {{1.25}} which is not 100% backward compatible with {{atlassian-mail 1.24}} included in previous releases of JIRA.\n\nJRIA 4.4.4 also ships with {{javamail 1.4.4}}, which we cannot guarantee is 100% compatible with {{javamail 1.4.1}} (shipped with previous releases of JIRA).\n\nHence, there are two significant points to note as a result of these changes:\n* The {{com.atlassian.mail.server.MailServer.getSession()}} method returns objects of the {{javax.mail.Session}} class rather than {{alt.javax.mail.Session}}\n* The classes from {{mockobjects-j1.3-j2ee1.3.jar}} are no longer exported (i.e. made available) to Atlassian version 2 plugins. This {{jar}} is no longer distributed with JIRA.\n\nh2. Potential Impact and Solution\n\n* We believe that very few (if any) 3rd party plugins will be affected by the two changes mentioned above and that such plugins will be broken as a result of these changes.\n\\\\\n** If your plugin uses the {{com.atlassian.mail.server.MailServer.getSession()}} method, doing either of the following should be sufficient to get it working with JIRA 4.4.4:\n*** Recompile your plugin against 4.4.4\n*** Use a higher level class like {{MailQueueItem}}.\n\\\\ \\\\\n** If your plugin depends on {{mockobjects-j1.3-j2ee1.3.jar}} (which is highly unlikely and could be considered questionable), we encourage you to either:\n*** Remove this dependency or\n*** If it is not possible to remove this dependency, bundle this {{jar}} with the plugin.\n\nAccording to the changelog for {{javamail}} (http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javaee/changes-220864.txt), we believe that these changes should not negatively impact current plugins. On the contrary, many bug fixes and compatibility improvements in this new version of {{javamail}} should make existing JIRA mail handlers more robust.\n\nh2. Rationale\n\nJIRA 4.4.4 comes with substantial mail logging improvements and capabilities, which should be valuable to customers and support personnel troubleshooting problems related to incoming and outgoing mail.\n\nPart of this feature work required the need to upgrade both the {{atlassian-mail}} and {{javamail}} libraries to the versions mentioned above. The anticipated small negative impact resulting from these upgraded libraries led us to believe that there was little or no business justification for supporting their older versions.",

But not very convenient for use if we need to take all fields excluding Comments and Description.\n\nWe don't need those fields cause they eat too much traffic, but excluding them create enourmous GET request.\n\nWould be nice to have opposite feature\nexcludefield=comment&excludefield=description - return all fields excluding Comments and Description.\n\nThx",
