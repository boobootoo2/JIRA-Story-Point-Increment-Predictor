On the whole we have found the API to be brittle and awkward to use (eg https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-76190), which means that we often encounter 4XX errors of one sort or another because we have sent somehow invalid input (eg, invalid ADF structure).\r\n\r\nIn the overwhelming majority of such cases, the response is an HTTP 400 with the body:\r\n\r\n{{{}}\r\n{{\u00a0\u00a0 \"errorMessages\": [}}\r\n{{\u00a0 \"We can't create this issue for you right now, it could be due to unsupported content you've entered into one or more of the issue fields. If this situation persists, contact your administrator as they'll be able to access more specific information in the log file.\"}}\r\n{{\u00a0\u00a0 ],}}\r\n{{\u00a0\u00a0 \"errors\": {}}}\r\n{{}}}\r\n\r\nThere are multiple problems with this:\r\n # This response is generated when input is well formed, ie, valid JSON, but does not conform to schema. That means that HTTP 400 is the wrong choice semantically - it should be a 422.\r\n # The message is uninformative. It may be the case that our IT team have access to this log file, but it is no use to them - _we_ need the error in the response because we, as developers, are the ones empowered to fix this. If you can write a meaningful error message to a file, then you can write it to a response stream.\r\n # If you _can't_ write it to a file and/or stream, then IMO that should be a 500 - the error is not being handled. And it should therefore be treated as a bug rather than 'normal' operation.",

Expected Results\r\n\r\nThe header of the issue will follow when you scroll down. No additional scroll bar should be put between the right side panel and the additional space created by collapsing the left sidebar.\r\nh3.

      "description": "{panel:title=Alt Text Editor\u00a0}\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nTeams,\r\n\r\nSince the implementation of the new editor into Jira and Confluence, we have been working to improve the experience.\r\n\r\nStarting today, the alt-text editor is available in all instances of Jira including the new experience. As we begin deprecating the old editor, customers will be able to migrate and retain their alt-text capability.\r\n\r\nThank you for your patience with this issue,\r\n\r\nJonathan Thurston,\r\n Head of Accessibility\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n{panel}\r\n\u00a0\r\nh3. Issue Summary\r\n\r\nThe editor in the new issue view does not have any way of providing alt-text to the images impacting accessibility.\u00a0\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n * Scenario 1:\r\n ** You\u2019re on the old editor, never migrated to new editor, never opened an issue in new editor:\r\n Your alt text is not changed, it\u2019s in wiki markup,\r\n It\u2019s stored in the the wiki markup editor, and recalled from the source\r\n It\u2019s in the view for view-issue. (rendered)\r\n\r\n * Scenario 2:\r\n ** You added alt-text in the old editor, migrated to the new editor - but you haven\u2019t edited any existing tickets/content that contains alt-text.\r\n Your alt text is still in the original wiki-markup editor, but it\u2019s not recalled from the source\r\n The migration to new editor does not pull alt-text across\r\n It can\u2019t be rendered as it doesn\u2019t exist in the new editor\r\n You can migrate back to wiki markup editor and retain alt-text.\r\n\r\n * Scenario 3:\r\n ** You added alt-text in old editor, you migrated to the new editor prior to the update - you edit content on some issues on the new editor, and switch to the old editor\r\n Any \u2018saved\u2019 or \u2018updated\u2019 content from the new editor is lost on alt-text because it wrote the data using new editor (without alt-text support)\r\n Migrating to old editor makes available unchanged wiki markup issues, but no new content.\r\n Alt-text not created by the new editor (while it was not available) was not saved.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nThe new issue view should have allowed a way to retain the alt-text. It should allow us a way to enter the alt-text to images to ensure accessibility.\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nThe editor allows the creation of alt-text, saves alt-text and displays alt-text as expected.",
