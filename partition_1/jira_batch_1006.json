I think this feed could be fed from the same information that drives the current dashboard view.

The state could be held in a cookie.\n\nAlternately, the \"Browse Project\" view could allow this brief/full switching.\n\nA more \"compact\" display form of the full would also be possible.

One the size of the file on disk, does not match the size recorded in the database.  This is probably due to line 125 in AbstractMessageHandler.\n\nfields.put(\"filesize\", new Long(part.getSize()));\n\nit's calling getSize on the Mime attachment and not the File that is just returned from the earlier line:\n\nFile file = getFileFromPart(part, issue);\n\nA fix should probably read as:\n\nfields.put(\"filesize\", new Long(file.length()));\n\nI hope to see a fix soon, so I can explain to my users that their files are there.\n\nThanks,\nNoah\n\n",

What Erwin suggested is one useful example.\r\nSimilarly it would be nice to notify assignees of dependent issues when an\r\nissue has been resolved, to propagate due dates in the dependency chain,\r\netc.\r\n\r\nSo the propagation of watch should perhaps be direction dependent for such use cases. \r\n",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-2918].\n  {panel}\n\nI would find the ability to create a new component or version while entering an issue very useful. Other bug systems i have used in the past have allowed this, and worked in simlar way tho this: \nIf the user has administrative rights, a link/button to create ie a new component is displayed next to the component list box. Click this, and a popup is displayed with an 'add new component' field. Then upon saving, popup closes, and can select the new component in your new issue without having to lose all the previously entered information.\n\nCurrently, while i'm adding issues, if the component doesnt exist, either have to save the issue, add the new component, then go back in and edit the issue, or cancel adding the issue to go and add the component.\n\n[apologies if this is duplicate - couldnt find a similar issue when doing a search]",
