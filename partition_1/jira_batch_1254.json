[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-30661].\n  {panel}\n\nI would like the ability to have global transitions that cross multiple workflows, and the ability to edit a transition and have it take place across multiple workflows.\n\nIt is inevitable that projects will have their own necessary workflow but what is common are the transitions that are used, whether it is a custom one, or one that is provided out of the box.  I would like the ability to use a true global transition that would allow me to define specific behavior no matter what workflow is used. Of course, I could retain the ability to have a localized transition for that workflow.\n\nExample:\n\nAfter running JIRA for nearly a year, we have had a new growth of users, projects, and workflows. It was requested, several times, that we zero out the remaining estimate when closing an issue. Since this change is global, I had to edit each customized workflow to include this post function. That was very time consuming.\n\nIn the future we plan to introduce software approvals via the workflow. Each customized workflow will have to have all the approval transitions and statuses added. If a change of any kind is needed, each customized workflow using those transitions must be modified.\n\nIn the above example, it would be great to set true global transitions so that I can add the \"Approved for Beta\" status on the design form, and drag the transition (which I have already set properties, conditions, validations, and post functions for) between my two preferred states. This way, if it was determined that we wanted a new post function to happen globally, I can go to one place, make my change, and have it become active across all workflows that use that true global transition.\n\nAnother great method is to have sub-workflows. Using the same software approval example; The approval process will start after the Resolved status and before Closed. I would like to add the \"Approval sub-workflow\" to start from the Resolved state. In the design view, I look at my available sub-workflows, select the Approval sub-workflow and drag it to the Resolved state. All the statuses and transitions the sub-workflow contains will be copied over. During the copy I will be prompted to choose to copy locally, or keep the sub-workflow linked globally (global means I modify the sub-workflow - all workflows and projects that use it is changed).  This method goes one step better than global transitions as an entire portion of the workflow can be added and I can maintain a 'change once, apply everywhere' mantra.\n\nIf there is currently a method to achieve what I want, please let me know.\n\nThanks!",

Load balancers and reverse proxy devices commonly use the \"x-forwarded-for\" [HTTP header|https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers] to enable logging of the actual visitory IP address rather than the proxy IP address.\n\n\nh3. Suggested Solution\n\nEnable configuration of JIRA to log the IP address from the \"x-forwarded-for\" header to the access logs.\n\n\nh3. Workaround\n\nCustomers have reported that modifying the log4j configuration of JIRA is not a viable workaround. Fortunately, this can be achieved using the access logs that are enabled by default in the Tomcat container that ships with JIRA.\n\n# Edit the file {{JIRA_INSTALL_DIR/conf/server.xml}}\n# Insert this line before the line with \"AccessLogValve\": {code}\n<Valve\n\tclassName=\"org.apache.catalina.valves.RemoteIpValve\"\n\tinternalProxies=\"PROXY_IP_ADDRESS\" />\n{code}\n#* (!) Escape the \".\" characters in PROXY_IP_ADDRESS with a backlash. Example: {{internalProxies=\"1\\.1\\.1\\.8\"}}\n# Configure AccessLogValve to accept the substituted IP from RemoteIpValve by adding the requestAttributesEnabled attribute to the AccessLogValve: {code}\n<Valve className=\"org.apache.catalina.valves.AccessLogValve\"\n    requestAttributesEnabled=\"true\"\n    ... EXISTING_ATTRIBUTES ...\n/>\n{code}\n\nFor full details see the Tomcat [RemoteIpValve documentation|https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-7.0-doc/api/org/apache/catalina/valves/RemoteIpValve.html].",

Summary: \n\nIf the default {{jira}} workflow is copied and a transition is cloned with a different name, the cloned name will appear in the issue view screen for the transition buttons.\nE.g when I clone a transition, and specify a new name, the new transition keeps the old transition's name, so I have two (for example) 'Start Progress' buttons.\n\nh3. Steps to Reproduce:\n\n# Copy the {{jira}} system workflow.\n# Edit it with the workflow designer.\n# Add a new transition, cloning the Start Progress Transition, providing it with a different name.\n# Create a new workflow scheme, assigning the new workflow to it and then assign it to a project.\n# View an issue in the appropriate status for that transition. The transition will not have the new name.\n\nh3. Expected Results:\n\nThe transition has the name as defined within the workflow designer.\n\nh3. Actual Results:\n\nThe new transition has the name of the cloned transition. This appears to be caused by cloning the following elements:\n{code:XML}\n          <meta name=\"opsbar-sequence\">20</meta>\n          <meta name=\"jira.i18n.title\">stopprogress.title</meta>\n{code}\n\nh3. Regression:\n\nNot a regression. This is not existant in the ViewWorkflowSteps.jspa editor as that functionality is not available. Tested back to 4.4.5 and this was present.\n\nh3. Notes:\n\nXML of a transition created from scratch:\n{code:XML}\n        <action id=\"731\" name=\"New Transition\">\n          <meta name=\"jira.description\"></meta>\n          <results>\n            <unconditional-result old-status=\"Not Done\" status=\"Done\" step=\"3\">\n              <post-functions>\n                <function type=\"class\">\n                  <arg name=\"class.name\">com.atlassian.jira.workflow.function.issue.UpdateIssueStatusFunction</arg>\n                </function>\n                <function type=\"class\">\n                  <arg name=\"class.name\">com.atlassian.jira.workflow.function.misc.CreateCommentFunction</arg>\n                </function>\n                <function type=\"class\">\n                  <arg name=\"class.name\">com.atlassian.jira.workflow.function.issue.GenerateChangeHistoryFunction</arg>\n                </function>\n                <function type=\"class\">\n                  <arg name=\"class.name\">com.atlassian.jira.workflow.function.issue.IssueReindexFunction</arg>\n                </function>\n                <function type=\"class\">\n                  <arg name=\"class.name\">com.atlassian.jira.workflow.function.event.FireIssueEventFunction</arg>\n                  <arg name=\"eventTypeId\">13</arg>\n                </function>\n              </post-functions>\n            </unconditional-result>\n          </results>\n        </action>\n{code}\n\nXML of a cloned transition:\n{code:XML}\n        <action id=\"711\" name=\"I HAS A DIFFERENT NAME\">\n          <meta name=\"opsbar-sequence\">20</meta>\n          <meta name=\"jira.i18n.title\">stopprogress.title</meta>\n          <meta name=\"jira.description\"></meta>\n          <restrict-to>\n            <conditions>\n              <condition type=\"class\">\n                <arg name=\"class.name\">com.atlassian.jira.workflow.condition.AllowOnlyAssignee</arg>\n              </condition>\n            </conditions>\n          </restrict-to>\n          <results>\n            <unconditional-result old-status=\"Not Done\" status=\"Done\" step=\"4\">\n              <post-functions>\n                <function type=\"class\">\n                  <arg name=\"class.name\">com.atlassian.jira.workflow.function.issue.UpdateIssueFieldFunction</arg>\n                  <arg name=\"field.value\"></arg>\n                  <arg name=\"field.name\">resolution</arg>\n                </function>\n                <function type=\"class\">\n                  <arg name=\"class.name\">com.atlassian.jira.workflow.function.issue.UpdateIssueStatusFunction</arg>\n                </function>\n                <function type=\"class\">\n                  <arg name=\"class.name\">com.atlassian.jira.workflow.function.misc.CreateCommentFunction</arg>\n                </function>\n                <function type=\"class\">\n                  <arg name=\"class.name\">com.atlassian.jira.workflow.function.issue.GenerateChangeHistoryFunction</arg>\n                </function>\n                <function type=\"class\">\n                  <arg name=\"class.name\">com.atlassian.jira.workflow.function.issue.IssueReindexFunction</arg>\n                </function>\n                <function type=\"class\">\n                  <arg name=\"class.name\">com.atlassian.jira.workflow.function.event.FireIssueEventFunction</arg>\n                  <arg name=\"eventTypeId\">12</arg>\n                </function>\n              </post-functions>\n            </unconditional-result>\n          </results>\n        </action>\n{code}\n\nh3. Workaround:\n\nTo update the title of the button, Please follow the steps below:\n\n# Choose Cog > Issues\n# Choose 'Workflows' under the WORKFLOWS section\n# Click the Edit link in the desired workflow\n# Click the link of the transition with the wrong title\n# Click View Properties\n# Delete the jira.i18n.title property from the transition.",

We stand by our original decision to remove this feature when we redesigned issue search several years ago.\n\nPlease remember that jira.atlassian.com is one of many inputs for the JIRA roadmap. You can [learn more about our process here|https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/110373/how-does-the-jira-team-use-jira-atlassian-com].\n\nI understand that our decision may be disappointing. Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.\n\nRegards,\nDave Meyer\n[dmeyer@atlassian.com|mailto:dmeyer@atlassian.com]\nProduct Manager, JIRA Platform\n{panel}\n\nOnce again, your short sightedness on what is useful has struck again.  This is a request to put back the JQL History mechanism.   Here are some comments from the 5.2 upgrade notes page.\n\n--------------------\nJQL history is immensely useful. I'm often looking at issues and just wish to perform transient searches...searches that *I do not want to save*. The JQL history serves as a convenient place that automatically saves these *drafts*.\n\nAnother use case, when I'm fine tuning searches, I need to jump back and forth between statements to see what they produced.\n\nIronically, Favorite Filters are the ones I use the least because like browser bookmarks, you eventually accumulate so much that the old stuff has no meaningful purpose to you anymore, and you don't have time to unfavorite them.\n--------------------\nI totally agree with the feedback given by Anonymous on November 14th:  the JQL History is (was) incredibly useful when developing a good query...  and that fiddling comes *before* it is saved as a Filter.  I do not want to have to save my experiments as Filters.  That would cause problems in itself...  many of the experiments would be failures and thus just create clutter that needs to be cleaned up manually later.\n--------------------",

This has to do with the implementation of com.atlassian.util.concurrent.LimitedExecutor to which it eventually delegates its completion service management. This has an internal \"overflow\" queue that is allowed to grow without bounds. If the LinkedBlockingQueue was given a bounds, then trying to queue up too many clients would throw an IllegalStateException, which could be caught and mapped to a busy message. \"Unable to load the activity stream at this time. This system is too busy.\" or something like that. It's ugly,but better than allowing so many clients to queue up that no http threads are available to process anything else.",

When the I18nBean tries to fetch the translation strings from it, it gets the familiar IllegalStateException for trying to access a disabled module. I would guess that this is some kind of race where the I18N cache is clearing and rebuilding before the plugins code has finished updating its active modules list, except that it seems to be a permanent failure once it has occurred. That is, there are later requests to trigger the cache rebuild that continue to try to use the disabled module.",

Apparently plugins and multitenancy disagree on the plugin state.  Plugins tells us it's there, but when we try to use it the multitenancy tells us that it isn't available.  The condition is apparently permanent.  It would be a good thing to figure out why this happens in the first place, but in the meantime the I18nBean should intercept the failures instead of letting them take out the cache entirely.  If the plug-in is gone, then us not getting its translations is the right answer anyway.\n\nI'm led to understand that this has been seen before and handled much the same way.  My guess is that this was triggered by the conversion to using Google caches, which wrap the IllegalStateException in an UncheckedExecutionException.  That's silly and unhelpful and is probably contributing to the problem.\n\n{noformat}\n2012-11-12 18:19:01,544 StreamsCompletionService::thread-9671 ERROR anonymous 957x5545060x9 - 78.47.84.21,172.16.3.44 /rest/activity-stream/1.0/config [atlassian.streams.\ncom.google.common.util.concurrent.UncheckedExecutionException: java.lang.IllegalStateException: Method invoked on module descriptor after it was destroyed.

I am developing a JIRA client for Android platform, and I have a few questions. \nDuring first launch my app caches some data in local DB (custom fields sets, value bundles for each custom field, assignee, priority etc)\nThere is a request in REST API - /rest/api/2/issue/{issueIdOrKey}/editmeta \nand I can get all available custom fields (with values) and operations from this request. And there is a question: is there any situation, when this request will return different data within one project? I mean different custom fields or different value bundles for two issues created in one project. And is there any way to get a Project scheme (custom fields, bundles, etc), but not a Issue scheme. \nThank you.",

The majority of use cases described are covered by JIRA Service Desk, which is a major investment by Atlassian to offer a great experience for serving customer requests, particularly the type created by emails. JIRA Service Desk offers email handlers to make this even easier.\n\nWhile I understand that JIRA Service Desk is a paid product and may not be viable for all customers, realistically this issue will not become a priority for core JIRA development for the foreseeable future.\n\nRemember that JIRA has an advanced plugin system and your license includes full access to JIRA source code, so if this is critical for you, it may be possible for you to modify your instance via other avenues.\n\nWe appreciate your understanding.\n\nRegards,\nDave Meyer\nProduct Manager, JIRA Platform\n{panel}\n\nWhen configuring an email handler, it is possible for us to specify the Default Reporter for creating issues from emails coming from an unknown sender. And at the moment, it is intended that the Default Reporter option will not be applied for emails coming from email addresses that has been registered in JIRA.\n\nHowever, it will be great if the mail handler is able to check if the email sender have the permission to create issue in JIRA, if the user has already existed in JIRA database. And if the sender do not have the Create Issue permission, then create an issue from the mail and use the specified Default Reporter as the issue reporter. \n\nSample use case: Sometimes JIRA is integrated with LDAP, and all LDAP users will be synchronized into JIRA. However, there may be a possibility that only half of the LDAP users is granted the permission to access JIRA, and the other half are not given the access to JIRA at all. And when the other half of the LDAP users is sending an email to create an issue, the emails will be rejected since the affected users do not have the appropriate permission in JIRA. \n\nCurrent workaround: Create a group in JIRA, and group the LDAP users that do not have the ability to login to JIRA, and grant the users (or the created group) the permission to Create Issue in the Permission Scheme - Does not work Post JIRA 7.

project in an ondeamnd instance which does not include FECRU, the Confluence space is not created\n\nThis affects jira-ondemand-jim-bridge-plugin-1.3\n\nThe OnDemandCreateProjectHandler should be checking for which other products exist in the ondemand instance, something like this:\n{code}\n\n        builder.id(project.getId()).homeUrl(project.getUrl())\n                .hasConfluence(appStatusService.isAppEnabled(Application.CONFLUENCE) && canCreateAssociatedEntityFor(Application.CONFLUENCE,getRemoteUser().getName()))\n                .hasFeCru(appStatusService.isAppEnabled(Application.FISHEYE)&& canCreateAssociatedEntityFor(Application.FISHEYE,getRemoteUser().getName()))\n                .hasBamboo(appStatusService.isAppEnabled(Application.BAMBOO) && canCreateAssociatedEntityFor(Application.BAMBOO,getRemoteUser().getName()));\n{code}\n\nBut instead it uses the default settings, which assume that FeCru exists.\n\nWhen Confluence is asked to create a project by JIRA, it looks at the project spec and fails to validate it, because FeCru is not actually there.\n\nStack trace of the creation of the project with the spurious true fecru flag:\n\nhttp-2990-8@19631 daemon, prio=5, in group 'main', status: 'RUNNING'\n\t  at

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-30462].\n  {panel}\n\nBig companies work differently than small companies.  If JIRA is to be effectively used by large, reliable, predictable, accountable companies, and not small ad hoc development teams \"where anything goes\", then JIRA must have support for business logic that goes beyond a required field here, or a workflow condition there.\n\nProper support for business logic means allowing the tool to have custom logic applied *before* any edit happens, so that changes to issues can be validated against business logic, appropriate for the enterprise JIRA is being used in.\n\nSome examples:\n\n- You might want fields to be valid in the context of values of other \n  fields.\n\n- You might want dynamic conditions.\n\n- You might want approval processes to be invoked, a certain role \n  may be able to lock/unlock certain fields, potentially at different\n  points in the lifecycle.\n\n- You may want fields to conform to certain formats for legal reasons.\n\n- etc.\n\nSupport business logic at the enterprise level comes down to allowing plugin authors to gate/stop edits before they are made to JIRA issues.  \n\nWe are not asking you to implement business logic in JIRA, we are asking you to make it possible for that class of problems to be addressed by plugins.\n\nJIRA must provide the ability to stop or alter *all* edits, not just provide notification that changes are happening.\n\nHow JIRA is failing to do this now:\n\nPlugins can listen to changes but not actually stop or alter them.  All edits (all of them) need to be preceded by a pending edit hook of some kind to give plugins a chance to gate the edit or alter it.\n\nThis can not be done right now.  The closest you can get is using the JIRA Behaviors plugin or writing something similar where you can control the edits being made in the browser via Javascript validation, and/or in combination with server side processing.\n\nThis *fails* to provide complete support though.  A user can easily subvert business logic enforced through JavaScript:\n\n1) do a bulk edit\n\n2) do inline editing (if the javascript doesn't handle inline editing)\n\n3) do edits through remote API\n\n4) do edits through plugins (like GreenHopper)\n\nSo while a plugin such as JIRA Behaviors (which is awesome by the way), works great, it can't possibly provide *true* business logic support, no plugin can.  There is no way to gate/stop edits to issues in a way that is consistent and guaranteed to always apply.\n\nSo, ideally JIRA should provide an internal hook to plugins, which allows plugins to gate/stop/alter edits *before* they are made. \n\nFor now though, you could solve 90% of the problem by providing a pre-edit hook inside Bulk edit.  JIRA Behaviors will likely add inline edit support, GH is using the built in edit screens now I think, and if they do remote editing...well we can tolerate that.  \n\nSo just adding a Bulk Edit pre-edit hook for plugins would solve most the problem.\n\nAgain, I want to be clear, this is absolutely necessary for enterprise customers.  Large companies focus on being predictable, reliable and accountable.  To do this, we have to enforce certain practices in JIRA, that can not be enforced simply by adding workflow conditions or configuring a few field screens.  We don't expect you to implement business logic, just that you make it possible for us to get it done, either by plugin providers or on our own.\n\nIf Atlassian is serious about addressing the enterprise market, this feature should be at the top of your queue.  Big companies work differently than small companies.\n\nEven if you don't believe the enterprise argument (which you should), then for Agile to be a mature and disciplined approach, you still need this. Otherwise I don't think you can claim Agile is maturing.\n\n\n",
