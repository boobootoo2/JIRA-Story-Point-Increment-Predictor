      "description": "There are some times in JIRA where we need to do a sync with all user directories (for example during an upgrade or in studio during tests). It would seem that we should call CrowdDirectoryService.synchroniseDirectory(..., false). However, as documented this throws an exception if the directory is already being synchronized. So you end up with:\r\n\r\n{code}\r\n        List<Directory> allDirectories = directoryService.findAllDirectories();\r\n        for (Directory directory : allDirectories)\r\n        {\r\n            Long id = directory.getId();\r\n            if (directory.isActive() && directoryService.isDirectorySynchronisable(id)\r\n                    && !directoryService.isDirectorySynchronising(id))\r\n            {\r\n                try\r\n                {\r\n                    directoryService.synchroniseDirectory(id, false);\r\n                }\r\n                catch (OperationFailedException e)\r\n                {\r\n                    log.error(format(\"Unable to synchronize directory %s [%s].\", directory.getName(), directory.getId()), e);\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nWe have to catch the exception because just checking directoryService.isDirectorySynchronising(id) does not guarantee that the call to directoryService.synchroniseDirectory(id, false) will not throw an exception because the directory is now synchronizing.\r\n\r\nTo make this method better to use here is what I think should happen:\r\n\r\n* If directoryService.synchroniseDirectory(id, false) is called when a sync is already happening: The method should wait for the current sync to finish and return false. If i am calling this method I really just want a sync to have happened once I return and I really don't care if I trigger it or someone else does. The return value can be used by the caller in a loop if they really really really want to force a sync.\r\n* If directoryService.synchroniseDirectory(id, false) is called when no sync is happening: Do the sync and return true.\r\n* If directoryService.synchroniseDirectory(id, true) is called when a sync is happening: Return immediately and return false. \r\n* If directoryService.synchroniseDirectory(id, true) is called when a sync is not happening: Return immediately and return true.\r\n\r\nAll this is possible to implement with a few extensions to the {{DirectoryLockManager}}.\r\n\r\nFor even more points: As a host app all I really want to do is either make sure all my users are synchronized or to start a synchronization programatically. It would be nice if there was a some simple methods:\r\n\r\n* CrowdDirectoryService.synchronizeAndWait(...): Synchronize all the directories waiting for the passed time for the operation to complete.\r\n* CrowdDirectoryService.startSynchronize(queueRequest, ...): Start the directories synchronizing and return immediately.",

As the issue hasn't collect votes, watchers, comments, or support cases from many customers during its lifetime, it's very low on our priority list, and will not be fixed in the foreseeable future. That's why we've decided to resolve it as *Timed Out*.\r\n\r\nAlthough we're aware the issue is still important to those of you who were involved in the conversations around it, we want to be clear in managing your expectations. The Crowd team is focusing on issues that have broad impact and high value, reflected by the number of comments, votes, support cases, and customers interested. Please consult the [Atlassian Bugfix Policy|https://confluence.atlassian.com/support/atlassian-server-bug-fix-policy-201294573.html] for more details.\r\n\r\nWe understand how disappointing this decision may be, but we hope you'll appreciate our transparent approach and communication.\r\n\r\nAtlassian will continue to watch this issue for further updates, so please feel free to share your thoughts in the comments.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nCrowd Team\r\n{panel}\r\n\u00a0\r\nIn my local dev instance, I spun up a fresh Crowd instance with an LDAP connector and no other modifications.  When trying to access the site using http://hostname:port/crowd as a local admin account, the login page would appear to refresh.  When accessing using localhost in place of my hostname, it worked as expected.\r\n\r\nAfter some debug logging on com.atlassian.crowd, it turns out that my username/password was accepted, but the crowd_token.key wasn't being respected when the 302 redirect to the Crowd landing page was sent.  Since the token wasn't respected, it sent me another 302 redirect to the login page, which gave the appearance of a page refresh with no error.\r\n\r\nLogging in using the localhost URL and disabling database token caching allowed me to login from the hostname URL.",

      "description": "From Scott McCulley,\r\n\r\n\r\nI ran in to some difficulties during the install of Crowd.  I thought I might bring them up to as something to address in your next release.\r\n\r\n1)  During the configuration of the default admin, the application attempts to resolve the hostname of the server.  If it fails, it reports error.  But before it does, it adds the user and group to the DB so it is impossible to re-use that admin user or create a new one, since the group already exists.\r\n\r\nQuestion:\r\n{noformat}\r\nIs it really necessary to attempt to resolve the hostname of the server?  What if (and I am) using a different name to access Crowd, and it isn't the name of the server??\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nSuggestion:\r\n{noformat}\r\n1)  Ask for the name of the server (actually, I think you do.)  Then use that server name instead of attempting to use the hostname.\r\n2)  Don't create the user if you intend to fail.  Or if you fail, drop the user from the DB, so it can be re-used later.\r\n3)  Same goes for the admin group as well...\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\n\r\nError log:\r\n\r\n{noformat}\r\n2011-09-18 19:34:20,050 http-8095-1 INFO [console.action.setup.SelectSetupStep] Current setup step is /console/setup/directoryinternalsetup.action\r\n2011-09-18 19:34:24,651 http-8095-1 INFO [console.action.setup.SelectSetupStep] Current setup step is /console/setup/defaultadministrator.action\r\n2011-09-18 19:34:46,700 http-8095-1 ERROR [console.action.setup.DefaultAdministrator] web3.cardboard-box.com: web3.cardboard-box.com\r\njava.net.UnknownHostException: web3.cardboard-box.com: web3.cardboard-box.com\r\n        at java.net.InetAddress.getLocalHost(InetAddress.java:1360)\r\n        at com.atlassian.crowd.console.action.setup.DefaultAdministrator.addCrowdApplication(DefaultAdministrator.java:213)\r\n        at com.atlassian.crowd.console.action.setup.DefaultAdministrator.doUpdate(DefaultAdministrator.java:112)\r\n        at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke0(Native Method)\r\n        at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(NativeMethodAccessorImpl.java:39)\r\n        at sun.reflect.DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.java:25)\r\n        at java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Method.java:597)\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\n\r\n",
