      "description": "h3. Issue Summary\r\nPermissions can be assigned directly to *users*. In Jira, user records have two different attributes, *user key* and *username*. The bug happens when a user has two different records, as exemplified below:\r\n||User Id||User Key||Username||\r\n|1|A|B|\r\n|2|B|C|\r\n\r\nWhen user *1* is referenced in a permission scheme, Jira will display user *2*'s display name. In case there is no record for user 2, Jira will display user 1's key.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Access a permission scheme\r\n# Grant a permission to a *single user*\r\n*   !Screen Shot 2019-01-23 at 4.44.55 PM.png|thumbnail! \r\n** Here, the problem will only occur if the user once had a record that was deactivated and is currently pointed as *Former user* or if there exists a user record that once \r\n\r\nh3.

Additional Information\r\nAlthough Jira displays the permission as being granted to a *Former User*, the permission is properly associated with the correct user in the database, so this behavior *does not represent a permission problem*.\r\n\r\nh3.
