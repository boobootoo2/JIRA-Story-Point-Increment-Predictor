Investigation Done\r\nIf you manually run a bulk move (e.g. from the result of JQL), the number of issues you can move in one operation is limited to 999 because of this memory limitation. If you do something that indirectly triggers a bulk migration (like changing the issue type scheme), this 999 limit is not checked (because you cannot partially migrate to a new issue type scheme) and so the migration may fail.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n* Backup your Jira data and save it in a safe place.\r\n* Create a new project with a similar configuration to the current one, but already having the required issue type scheme.\r\n* Move issues from the old project to the new one in batches of 999.\r\n\r\nIf it is OK to have all the issues in the new project, then you are done. If the project must be kept the same, then:\r\n* Change the old project issue type scheme as required.

      "description": "*Customers Ask:*\r\n\r\n\r\nHi,\\\\ \\\\ I often use Jira advanced search to find issues, some of which were created quite some time ago, so I don't fully remember their summary. I only remember some words that might occur in any text fields, in summary or in description. And today I realized that Jira has a defect in text search, which makes it significantly harder to find an old issue. \\(I've set impact to Level 3 because this is a use case which I do really often, and sometimes I have to spend more time searching for issues than I would expect to spend using a good search engine\\). Below is a description of a defect:\\\\ \\\\ Imagine there is an issue with the word \"A\" in summary and word \"B\" in description \\(word \"A\" doesn't occur in description and word \"B\" doesn't occur in summary\\). But the following advanced search query doesn't return me anything:\\\\ \\\\ text \\~ \"A B\"\\\\ \\\\ however the documentation says that \"text\" field is a \"master-field\" that allows you to search all text fields including summary and description. I find this behaviour to be poor because I really expect \"text\" field to search across all text fields.\\\\ \\\\ After some investigations and experiments I came to conclusion that Jira probably find only those tickets where both words \"A\" and \"B\" occur in the same text field, so it will find only tickets where both \"A\" anb \"B\" occur in summary or in description. Then I tried to find a workaround for this behaviour: I tried another advanced search query:\\\\ \\\\ text \\~ \"A\" and text \\~ \"B\"\\\\ \\\\ but this query gave me nothing again. And this looks really like a bug, because when I issue any of these subqueries separately Jira gives me my ticket as a result. I mean, query \\{\\{\\{{text \\~ \"A\"}}}} shows me my ticket in search results, and query \\{\\{\\{{text \\~ \"B\"}}}} shows me my ticket in results. So if my ticket satisfies both \\{\\{\\{{text \\~ \"A\"}}}} and \\{\\{\\{{text \\~ \"B\"}}}}, then I don't understand why it doesn't satisfy \\{\\{\\{{text \\~ \"A\" and text \\~ \"B\"}}}}\\?\\\\ \\\\ It looks like the only way to find my ticket by two words is to manually enumerate all possible combinations of text fields issuing multiple queries like:\\\\ \\\\ summary \\~ \"A\" and description \\~ \"B\"\\\\ \\\\ I hope you will be able to fix these problem, so that:\\\\ \\- \"text\" master field will actually use \\*all\\* text fields for searching,\\\\ \\- and that if issue satisfies both \\{\\{\\{{text \\~ \"A\"}}}} and \\{\\{\\{{text \\~ \"B\"}}}} then it will be found by \\{\\{\\{{text \\~ \"A\" and text \\~ \"B\"}}}} \\(and by \\{\\{\\{{text \\~ \"A B\"}}}}\\) too.",
