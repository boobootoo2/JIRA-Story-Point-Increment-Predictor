Issue Summary\r\n * Over the past ~60 days we have seen our DB CPU performance increase each week, and yesterday it pegged at 99% and caused performance issues in the system, mostly related to automation rules, eg rules taking ~30 minutes to apply\r\n !Screen Shot 2020-05-18 at 10.43.28 AM.png!\r\n * In thread dumps we saw occasional blocked threads, eg *automation-rule-executor* thread blocking\u00a0*automation-event-serializer* threads. These blocked threads were not long running between individual dumps, but it's not common for us to see those threads blocked in that way.\r\n * We observed a high number of the below (parameterized) query running in parallel on the DB:\r\n{code:sql}\r\nselect count(*) from \"public\".\"AO_589059_RULE_STAT\" \"AO_589059_RULE_STAT\" where \"AO_589059_RULE_STAT\".\"RULE_ID\" = $1 and \"AO_589059_RULE_STAT\".\"EVENT_HASH\" = $2\r\n{code}\r\n\r\n * This table maintains audit logging on\u00a0*Automation for Jira*\u00a0rules\r\n * When we ran an explain on this query, we could see that the query planner executed a full table scan for each of these; while individually they aren't\u00a0_overly_\u00a0expensive this really increases CPU overhead when we have multiple queries running in parallel:\r\n !Screen Shot 2020-05-26 at 12.50.13 PM.png|width=704,height=373!\r\n * The query is using two columns in its WHERE predicate; and we found that there isn't a composite index that covers both conditionals:\r\n{code:none}\r\nIndexes:\r\n    \"AO_589059_RULE_STAT_pkey\" PRIMARY KEY, btree (\"ID\")\r\n    \"u_ao_589059_rule_stat_audit_id\" UNIQUE CONSTRAINT, btree (\"AUDIT_ID\")\r\n    \"index_ao_589059_rul1515611263\" btree (\"CREATED\")\r\n    \"index_ao_589059_rul74196096\" btree (\"RULE_ID\", \"CREATED\")\r\n    \"index_ao_589059_rul995506729\" btree (\"RULE_ID\")\r\n{code}\r\n\r\n * We added a new covering index for this and observed an immediate CPU drop on the cluster:\r\n{code:sql}\r\nCREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY \"index_ao_589059_rule_id_event_hash\" ON \"public\".\"AO_589059_RULE_STAT\"(\"RULE_ID\",\"EVENT_HASH\");{code}\r\n(We created the index concurrently to prevent a full write lock on the table, though it only took ~10s)\r\n\r\n * Running the same explain query showed a dramatic decrease in execution time:\r\n !Screen Shot 2020-05-26 at 1.19.30 PM.png|width=849,height=244!\r\n * DB CPU went immediately back down to normal:\r\n!Screen Shot 2020-05-27 at 4.00.55 PM.png|width=480,height=204!\r\n * When Node 3 was added back to the cluster the index disappeared and CPU spiked again. The composite index isn't included as part of the Automation for Jira plugin; at startup any indexes not explicitly defined by the plugin are dropped. The indexes themselves are compiled into Java class\r\n {{automation-for-jira-7.1.7/com/codebarrel/jira/plugin/automation/ao/RuleStat.class}}\r\n\r\n * We've re-added the index and CPU dropped back to expected levels once more\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nThis is difficult to reproduce artificially. To do so you would need an instance with ~3 million rows in AO_589059_RULE_STAT and lots of traffic that triggers concurrent rule execution.\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nThe queries are performant and do not impact the service\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nThe queries were non performant and caused system impact\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n * Ensure all nodes are running\r\n * Add the index to the DB manually:\r\n\r\n{code:sql}\r\nCREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY \"index_ao_589059_rule_id_event_hash\" ON \"public\".\"AO_589059_RULE_STAT\"(\"RULE_ID\",\"EVENT_HASH\");{code}\r\n * If any node needs to be restarted, be prepared to manually re-add the index, as the plugin startup will remove it",

This would simplify configuration of (the many) individual rules.\r\n\r\nAlso, a Project Group can be updated \u2013 for example to add a new Project. This would enable all the appropriate Rules for that new Project, greatly simplifying rule administration.\r\n\r\nOur Jira instance, for example, currently has 11 automation rules that are configured for the same set of 8 Projects. More Rules, and more Projects, will certainly be added over time. Maintaining the exact same set of Projects across all these Rules is becoming quite burdensome. Our Jira instance is admittedly much smaller than many instances.\r\n\r\nA different approach would be to instead implement *Rule Groups*. This would allow leveraging common configuration beyond just the Projects for a Rule. Config elements like \"Notify on Error\", \"Owner\" and \"Actor\" could be part of the Rule Group. A concern with this approach is that not all Rule Groups will want identical config element settings, possibly leading to a need for exceptions (further complicating this approach). The smaller scope of Project Groups is likely an advantage that eliminates the need for exception case handling.",
