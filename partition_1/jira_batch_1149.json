Summary\r\n\r\nUsing [this configuration|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/AdminJIRAServer072/Creating+issues+and+comments+from+email#Creatingissuesandcommentsfromemail-handytips] to allow non-JIRA users to create or comment on issues by email, JIRA only accepts the user to add comment on existing issues by adding the _Issue Key_ in the subject of the message. When trying to raise a new ticket by email, the message is rejected with the following entries in _atlassian-jira-incoming-mail.log_:\r\n{noformat}Cannot create issue due to invalid license: [Sorry, you can't create any issues right now, as you need to have access to a JIRA application to be able to create issues. To gain application access you need to be a member of a group assigned to an application.]{noformat}\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Allow anonymous access to your project per [this KB|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/AdminJIRAServer070/Allowing+anonymous+access+to+your+project]\r\n # Configure your mail handler as [this|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/AdminJIRAServer072/Creating+issues+and+comments+from+email#Creatingissuesandcommentsfromemail-handytips]\r\n # Send an email out to JIRA's mail handler\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nThe issue is created with the _default reporter_ according to the mail handler configurations\r\nh3. Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nNo issue is created and the following entries appear in _atlassian-jira-incoming-mail.log_:\r\n{noformat}Cannot create issue due to invalid license: [Sorry, you can't create any issues right now, as you need to have access to a JIRA application to be able to create issues. To gain application access you need to be a member of a group assigned to an application.]{noformat}\r\nh3. Notes\r\n\r\nThis issue is not reproducible when the user is adding a new comment to an issue by specifying the Issue Key in the message's subject. That is, the message is added as a comment on the issue.\r\n\r\nh3. *Workaround*\r\n\r\nAfter some tests, I've noticed that this won't affect mail handlers that use the instance's default mail server.\r\n\r\nSo, as a workaround, you can create mail handlers that use the instance's default mail server, with a catch email address set when you need to use multiple mail handlers (to different projects).\r\n\r\nBut in some cases, it is not feasible to force all external users to send the e-mails to the Jira instance's e-mail address, and to the e-mail set as *Catch email address* CCed.\r\n\r\nI've made this workaround to apply this without forcing the need of sending the e-mails meant to create issues to the instance's e-mail address. Instead, you will be able to use the desired mailbox as the source of the new issues, and have the e-mail routing automated by setting a forwarding rule in the mailbox that is meant to receive the e-mails that will create new issues.\r\nIn this example, I've used a *Gmail* mailbox as my source:\r\n\r\n*1.* Create a mail handler that uses the instance's default mail server:\r\n* Jira home -> *Jira settings* -> *System* -> *Incoming Mail*;\r\n* Click on *Add incoming mail handler*;\r\n* Select the *Default Cloud Mail Server* as the Server -> select *Create a new issue or add a comment to an existing issue* as the Handler -> *Next*:\r\n !Screen Shot 2019-01-11 at 10.54.58.png|thumbnail! \r\n* Select the target project -> the default issue type -> the mailbox where you receive the e-mails as the *Catch e-mail address* -> select a *Default reporter* (a user with permission to create issues in the target project) -> *Add*:\r\n !Screen Shot 2019-01-11 at 10.59.06.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\n*2.* In Gmail, a confirmation code is sent to the e-mail address that you want to set as the forwarding target. So in this case, we will need to create a mail handler that is able to catch the e-mail with the confirmation code, and create that as an issue:\r\n* Jira home -> *Jira settings* -> *System* -> *Incoming Mail*;\r\n* Click on *Add incoming mail handler*;\r\n* Select the *Default Cloud Mail Server* as the Server -> select *Create a new issue or add a comment to an existing issue* as the Handler -> *Next*;\r\n* Select the target project -> the default issue type -> select a *Default reporter* (a user with permission to create issues in the target project) -> *Add*:\r\n !confirmation code mail handler.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\n*3.* Configuring the forwarding in Gmail:\r\n* Click on the cog icon -> *Settings*:\r\n !Gmail settings.png|thumbnail! \r\n* Click on the *Forwarding and POP/IMAP* tab -> *Add a forwarding address*:\r\n !Forwarding tab.png|thumbnail! \r\n* Type your instance's default mail server -> *Next*:\r\n !forwarding address.png|thumbnail! \r\n* Confirm the forwarding e-mail address -> *Proceed*:\r\n !confirm forwarding address.png|thumbnail! \r\n* The confirmation code notification will be displayed -> *OK*:\r\n !confirmation code sent.png|thumbnail! \r\n* The mail handler created in the step *2* should process the e-mail sent by Gmail, and create an issue in the target project. Here's an example of the issue created, where you can see the confirmation code:\r\n !confirmation code.png|thumbnail! \r\n* Type the confirmation code in Gmail -> *Verify*:\r\n !verify.png|thumbnail! \r\n* Check *Forward a copy of incoming mail to...* -> *Save Changes*:\r\n !apply.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\nAt this point, you can delete the mail handler created in the step *2*.\r\n\r\nWith that setup, Jira will match the *Catch email address* with the source of the forwarded e-mail (it will be present in the header of the forwarded e-mail). Jira will then process that e-mail, creating an issue with the default reporter.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

I add all of them to a certain screen and want to configure the visible fields via the Edit Issue dialog's _Configure Fields > Show Fields: Custom_ tab. There, only one entry is listed for the respective Custom Field name (e.g., there are three custom fields called 'Team' but in that drop-down I only see one entry called 'Team') which is randomly mapped to just one of the multiple Custom Fields having that name. It is thus not possible to specifically select the custom field to be shown.\nh3. Environment\n\nJIRA Cloud 1000.552.1\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\n # Have\u00a0at least two custom fields with the exact same name in your JIRA instance\n # Add all of these custom fields to the\u00a0edit\u00a0issue screen of your project (can be any screen, basically)\n # Edit an issue using that screen\n # Try to select just one of your previously added custom fields via _Configure Fields > Show Fields: Custom_\n\nh3. Expected Results\n\nThere is an entry for each of my custom fields and I can toggle their visibility\u00a0individually\nh3. Actual Results\n\nThere is only one entry for all of my custom fields which toggles the visibility of the first custom field having that name.\nh3. Notes\n\nThere is\u00a0a short video illustrating the problem attached to this issue\nh3. Workaround\n\nIt is possible to at least show _all_ custom fields of that name by switching to _Configure Fields > Show Fields: All_; however, that is not \u00a0exactly what you want since\u00a0you'd actually like to only add one specific custom field to the screen. Alternatively, you can go to the screen configuration in the admin section and hide the fields\u00a0you do not want from there. This won't work for users without admin permissions, though.",

The expectation is that this should show unresolved issues.\n\nIn looking at the Jira issues, I've found JRA-13611, which indicates this is expected. I disagree and feel this is incorrect behavior.\n\nThe Time Tracking report is supposed to be able to provide a view of work remaining on a project. There are 2 options to show issues on this report:\n\"All\" - This results in a mess and we have to look at things that are already done or we've decided not to even do.\n\n\"Incomplete issues only\" - This option seems like it should be exactly what we want in showing unresolved issues. Unfortunately it very unhelpfully hides all issues without time estimates. This makes it difficult to know how much work is left as there isn't a clean way to see which issues don't have time estimates at all.\n\nI understand from the comments on JRA-13611 that the way this was designed was to show anything that has \"Remaining time\" > 0. Perhaps this is useful to someone, so alternately, please add a new filter such as \"Unresolved.\"",

As an example:\n{quote}\nThe custom field 'Environment' requires option 'Staging' for the import but it does not exist in the current JIRA instance.\n{quote}\n\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\n# Have a source instance that has a Single-select custom field with multiple contexts. (Eg. Environment)\n# Set up target instance to have the same contexts and custom field options\n# Perform Project Import from the XML backup\n# The project import can fail in certain cases\n\nh3. Expected Results\nEvery project import will go fine\n\nh3. Actual Results\nOn certain project import, it can fail in certain cases. The below can be seen in the UI under custom field section:\n{noformat}\nThe custom field 'Environment' requires option 'Staging' for the import but it does not exist in the current JIRA instance.\n{noformat}\n \nh3. Notes\nOne of the trigger is when {{customfieldoption.customfieldconfig}} does not match {{fieldconfigscheme.id}} but the relation relies on {{fieldconfigschemeissuetype}} table between {{fieldconfiguration}} and its {{fieldconfigscheme}}.\n\nh3.

Your feedback is key to helping us understand how you use JIRA so we can continue improving your experience. We have reviewed this issue over the last few days; unfortunately we don't have any plans to support this in JIRA for the foreseeable future.\n\nPlease remember that jira.atlassian.com is one of many inputs for the JIRA roadmap. You can [learn more about our process here|https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/110373/how-does-the-jira-team-use-jira-atlassian-com].\n \nI understand that our decision may be disappointing. Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.\n \nRegards,\nDave Meyer\ndmeyer@atlassian.com\nProduct Manager, JIRA Platform\n{panel}\n\nSome tasks are allways the same, thej have same summary and description, components...like tasks for deploy. Now I solve this with tasks thet are never closed and when I need souch task I clone IT. This works fine, except that there are allways some open tasks. \n\nIt wold be nice to have something like templates in confluence, where you can define template page..",

This is the first step towards bringing dark mode to Jira Cloud.\r\n\r\nOur next step will be to ready the solution for the [developer ecosystem|https://developer.atlassian.com/], so that apps can support themes too.\r\n\r\nWhile the Design System work is in progress, we don\u2019t yet have a timeline to share for bringing dark theme for Jira Cloud, that's why the status of this issue is still \"Under Consideration\". Rest assured that we understand how important this is, and I\u2019ll share another update here in Q1 of the new year to keep you posted of our progress.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, I wish you all happy holidays!\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nRutger\r\n\r\nHead of Product, Atlassian UI Platform.",
