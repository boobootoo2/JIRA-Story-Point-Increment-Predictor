Currently this can only be reached by setting the value of \"Notify own changes\" to True.\nAs a company that works much with Jira this is no option as many people would spam theirselfes.\nSo nearly everybode has set this option to False.\n\nThis results in writing an email to an account with configured mail handler and getting no notification. So nobody knows that a jira ticket was created until some action takes place in the ticket. And even if one knows that a Jira Ticket is created, one doesn't know the ticket ID for an additional info or question.\n\nThe suggestion is to make an additional checkbox for configuring the mail handler with name \"Notify Reporter on Creation\" with the meaning of new tickets that are created will trigger a notification to the reporter no matter what setting \"Notify own changes\" is made.",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-40815].\n  {panel}\n\nHello,\n\nI'd like to outline the workflow I use for upgrading JIRA on Windows and the frustrations I have with it for hopeful improvement.  I'm running the x64 installer on Windows Server 2012 R2.\n\n1) Registration settings get removed during every upgrade yet Confluence persists them.  I have to set manual min and max memory and add a plug-in delay line to the java options.  I have to do this with every single JIRA upgrade but again, not with Confluence, it persists my values\n\n2) You have a checkbox at the end of the JIRA install \"Launch JIRA\" which is not checked but the service IS started.  I don't want the service to start automatically when the JIRA update is complete as I have to go into the registry to and set the values again and also copy in my custom config file with my server alias, url, port, etc. \n\n3) If you detect a custom config file move it to a temp location, do the install, then rename the original .new and put my config file back in place so I don't have to do it every time.\n\nWith a little effort the upgrade process can be more seamless.  Leave the registry settings intact, don't start the service if I don't have the \"Launch JIRA\" checkbox checked on the last install wizard screen, and keep my customizations by putting them back after upgrade.\n\nThank you.",

In existing dashboard, pick a gadget and try to change the filter to *AA_1.6_Unresolved*\n3. typing in *AA_1.6* yields nothing. Nor does *1.6_Unresolved*. In fact, no matter what combination you try, you won't be able to select *AA_1.6_Unresolved* from the drop down menu. \n\nCustomer Feedback: \n{quote}\nPlease reinstate the ability to select the filter in dashboard gadgets via a pop-up window! Recent updates made it impossible for me to select new filters, so I'm totally stuck right now!\n{quote}\n\nThere are two issues in play:\n#  Multiple filters that contain the name *Unresolved* doesn't show all available filters in autocomplete. \n# If a filter contains a dash followed by a number it won't be available in autocomplete. For example, the following filter name will cause an issue: {code}Filter-6{code} but {code}Filter - 6{code} and/or {code}Filter-Six{code} are perfectly fine. \n\nIdeally we can manually escape the characters as a workaround until this is fully resolved.  \n",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-40789].\n  {panel}\n\nHello, \n\nSome feedback was recieved recently on the Worked Time Chart Gadget:\n\n-We did 2 charts on our dashboard : one for a 2 weeks span and one for a 8 weeks span. However, the Gadget doesn\u2019t display the time span information so it\u2019s hard to distinguish between the two gadgets (unless we check the configuration of the gadget or guess that the highest total time corresponds to the 8 week span gadget)\n-If we click on \u201cDetails\u201d we get only the information for the last week (5Nov to 11 Nov) by default, even though we selected a larger span in the gadget options (e.g. 2 week or 8 weeks span). \n-When choosing a 3 weeks span, the graph doesn\u2019t render (see second image below)\n-In Chrome, with 100% Zoom, the chart displays with scrolling bars at the bottom instead of adjusting to the desired zoom level. (With a dashboard layout of 3 columns) \n\nThank you very much, ",

However you can also define different description texts in each field configuration and this will override the original field description text.\n\nFor example if a custom field \"My Field\" is defined with a description of \"This is my field\" and no field configuration changes are made, then the displayed text will be \"This is my field\" as expected. If field configurations are used and a description \"This is my excellent field\" is set for the custom field in the field description, then the displayed text will be \"This is my excellent field\". \n{quote}\n\n",

Is this expected behavior?  If so, this is a problem when we have a number of cases that we planned to fix for one version and need to bulk change them to fix for a different version.\n\nIdeally, there should be a \"retain original values\" checkbox to allow the semantics to be either additive or replacement.\n\nThanks, Irwin\n",

I want to display a pie chart showing the number of Jira records that match each of the labels in the filter. The pie chart gadget does this just fine BUT the pie chart segment labels are wrong. Instead of showing the Jira label that matched to count that Jira record in that pie slice the pie slice is labeled with an apparently arbitrary label from the Jira record (or more likely the first in the list of applied labels).",

Issue Summary\r\n\r\nYou can restrict the scope of custom field so they aren't available in all issues. You can do that per issue type, for example:\r\n !Screen Shot 2020-01-21 at 11.36.30.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\nBut, currently, the *Basic search* cannot perform searches using the restricted field as criteria even though the search matches with the scope that field is restricted to:\r\n !Screen Shot 2020-01-21 at 11.37.06.png|thumbnail!  !Screen Shot 2020-01-21 at 11.37.43.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\nIn that case, although I had selected the correct issue type the field was restricted to, I couldn't get its options. I was able to perform an advanced search and select the value, but when switching back, the value was not supported.\r\n\r\nh3.

It would be convenient if JIRA also trigged webhooks on events related to users: for example, \"user created\", \"user added to group\", \"user removed from group\", \"user deleted\", etc.\n\nFor my specific use case, my company has a public-facing JIRA installation with Self Sign Up enabled, and no restrictions on domain. However, we want to automatically place users in JIRA groups based on the domain of the email address they use to sign up. (When employees of the company sign up, they should have more access and permissions than when non-employees sign up.) It would be very helpful to have an \"issue created\" webhook, so that the webhook handler could inspect the newly-created user via the REST API, and assign that user to the correct group based on the domain of their email address.",

They may need to add comments, modify fields not present on \"Create Issue\" screen and even change status in a csv file that the project leader could import into JIRA\n\nUnder these circumstances, it would be useful if the CSV Importer have the ability to map to fields which are not defined in the *Create Issue* screen",

Those are all your products, you cannot fill all of that for us instead of making us guess and go through your confluence pages (like this broken one for example from the latest version of JIRA https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/CRUCIBLE035/Configuring+Trusted+Applications+Authentication+for+an+Application+Link) to find list of URL patterns that are not even consistent.\nWhy does it take more than 1 click to link 2 atlassian products?\n\nSo, please, can you auto-fill all the answers for application links when linking atlassian products with each other? (or even don't even show them)\n\nthanks\n",

It is annoying that users have to repeat the operation many times.\n-----\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1) Filter issues with different workflows\n2) Start bulk change wizard\n3) Select the workflow transition\n--> screenshot\n\nSome issues are in workflow \"Fehlerprozess\" and some in \"Aufgabenprozess V2\". I would like to select for both the transition \"Close issue\" but I can only select one radio button of the displayed four. (They are in one \"radio button group\")\n\nSuggestion: I think there should be two \"radio button groups\". One for each workflow.\n\nWorkaround: Run the bulk change multiple times. Once for each workflow.\n\nThanks!",
