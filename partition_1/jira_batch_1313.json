I\u2019d like to give you a quick update on this feature improvement.\u00a0We\u2019re continuously investigating solutions to improve performance, but loading & viewing a very large amount of issues at once is complex.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe issue & project limits most likely won't be extended in the next few months. The Reason is that we chose to invest most of our effort in simplifying the UI with a brand new design, details can be found\u00a0[here|https://community.atlassian.com/t5/Portfolio-for-Jira-articles/Introducing-a-new-planning-experience-in-Portfolio-for-Jira/ba-p/944996].\u00a0\r\n\r\nWe know that this is a major issue for some of you and longer term ( 12-18 months ) we will\u00a0 increase our efforts to extend these limits in a way that won\u2019t lower performance.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, I would advise customers to split their work streams into different plans. You could use the\u00a0[Programs feature|https://confluence.atlassian.com/jiraportfolioserver/programs-931037964.html]\u00a0to get an aggregated view of multiple plans, for basic reporting functionality. \u00a0\r\n\r\nRoi Fine | Product Manager\u00a0\r\n{panel}",

Steps to Reproduce\r\nh4. Scenario 1:\r\n\r\n(x)\u00a0Unable to reproduce at our end.\r\n # Log into a plan as a user who is not the current or original assignee for any issue in the plan\r\n # Create or modify a Release, Cross-Project Release, or Team. Don't change any issues.\r\n # Review the changes (_Only the newly created release or with some other uncommitted changes from other users_)\r\n # Select \"All\" Changed by Filter\r\n\r\nh4. Scenario 2\r\n\r\n(/)\u00a0Reproducible.\r\n # Login as UserA and make changes to a plan (do not commit changes)\r\n # Disable UserA in Jira User Management page\r\n # Login as UserB, open the same plan and click \"Review Changes\"\r\n # Select \"All\" Changed by Filter\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nList the user ID's of those who has added/modified changes in the plan to choose only their changes to be reviewed before commit it.\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nClicking the Filter throws an Error as above.\r\n\r\n(x) There is no error or exception in the Jira log.\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\n(flag) For the \u201cChanged by\u201d filter, Jira populating the list of users using data from a piece of the frontend state called *\u201cassigneeList\u201d*. When the app first loads, this state is populated with users who have issues assigned to them.\r\n\r\nIn this case, there is a user who has made a change, who is not in the assigneeList and then the app tries to get their details (name, avatar etc.) from assigneeList, doesn\u2019t find them, and crashes with the error as \"Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property *'jiraUsername'* of undefined\"\r\n\r\n(on) A possible workaround is to temporarily assign an issue to whichever user made the change, which will cause them to be added to assigneeList and It will fix the problem. (If it\u2019s known which user that is\u2026)\r\n\r\nAnother way is, just opening the assignee selector for an issue might fix it as this causes a list of users to be fetched and added to assigneeList but not sure if opening the assignee dropdown is guaranteed to fix it, because, If there is a large number of users it only fetches a certain number of them for performance reasons.",

Issue Summary\r\nTransitioning a scrum issue spanning multiple sprints to Done status, makes is disappear from the last sprint in the Plan view\r\nAs long as the issue is still in the \"ToDo\" or \"In Progress\" status, everything is shown as expected in the Plan view.\r\nThe timeline spans the issues covering the timeframe of all involved sprints. \r\nThe sprint overview in Portfolio also shows all sprints the issue was part of.\r\n\r\nAfter closing the issue (transition it into a \"Done\" status) the latest (current) sprint does not appear as part of the issue anymore and the timeline doesn't cover the current sprint anymore. \r\nIn addition, the capacity overview of the sprint shows, that less team capacity is used.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Install Jira and Advanced Roadmaps plugin\r\n # Create a scrum software project and create 1 Epic with multiple stories.\r\n # Create 2 sprints, and ensure 1 issue is not going to be finished in that sprint.\r\n # Create a plan based on the scrum project board.\r\n !screenshot_590.png|thumbnail! \r\n # Ensure that 1 issue is moved from sprint 1 to sprint 2 after sprint 1 is finished.\r\n # Start sprint 2 and ensure that issue coming from sprint 1 is showing 2 sprints in the JPO Plan view.\r\n !screenshot_591.png|thumbnail! \r\n # While sprint 2 is still running, transition the issue coming from sprint 1 to Done status.\r\n\r\nh3.

Workaround\r\nNo workaround is found for this issue issue at the moment.\r\n\r\n*Note:*\r\n* Once the last sprint is finished, the Plan view would show the issue again as part of the last sprint (sprint 2 in the above scenario), this is still not a workaround as the Plan view reporting is wrong during the last sprint runtime.\r\n !screenshot_593.png|thumbnail! \r\n",
