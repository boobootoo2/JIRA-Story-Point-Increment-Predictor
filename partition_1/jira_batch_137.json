This pops up twice, and then the commit history view is blank. If I switch to \"All Branches\" view, I see commit history again.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. In the left-hand nav, click on the currently-checked out branch.\r\n2. Make sure the View segmented control at top left is set to Log (the middle one).\r\n3. In the branch filter drop-down, select \"Current Branch.\"\r\n4. Choose a previous revision in the commit list, and double-click on it to detach the working copy head.\r\n5. Click OK on the warning that pops up.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:\r\nNo error comes up. The branch filter is automatically switched to \"All Branches\" since the \"Current Branch\" filter is no longer applicable (I believe). Perhaps there's an alert telling the user about this (or some text could be added to the warning in step 5 above).\r\n\r\nActual Results:\r\nAn error pops up with the title/message listed in Summary above, and then the Current Branch filter remains in place.

      "description": "It appears that sourcetree checks all of its bookmarked repositories when pushing a commit to a remote repository. Because of this eager polling of the bookmarks our security team is having a hard time distinguishing our sourcetree traffic from bruit force scanners because of the high volume of connections it tries to make in a short time period.  The security team sees a our developers commit/push from sourcetree as 3+(Number of Bookmarks) connection attempts within a few seconds, which does seem suspicious to them. \r\n\r\nOur work around is to not have more than 10 bookmarks in source tree, but that seems rather limiting. An idea to prevent false positive security threats on the network would be to spread out the background polling of bookmarked repos so that they don't all run at the same time, possibly offset by a random value between 10 to 60 seconds.  A default threshold for brute force attacks on several security scanners is 20 connections in a 60 second interval. Even a configuration option to adjust the aggressiveness of the polling would be nice. \r\n\r\nIn an office setting, these kinds of security systems are common and I think the default setting should not make source tree appear as a security threat just because of the number of bookmarks a user has.

It may also suggest to checkout local branch and pull that local branch then.\r\n\r\nDetailed description:\r\nLet's say we have a `develop` local branch and `origin/develop` that is ahead of `develop` by 2 commits. Local branch `develop` tracks `origin/develop`.\r\nConsider the following scenario: \r\n\r\nstep 1) When you double-click on a latest commit on `origin/develop` default action is performed: SrcTree tries to checkout the branch. Running that action ends up in an error that informs of local branch `develop` that already exist. Now there's no way to go forward in that case. \r\n\r\nIn my opinion that's not the most common thing users want to do if remote branch is tracked. In my case that would be just to checkout local branch and have it up-to-date.\r\n\r\nstep 2) The only thing possible after \"step1\" is to (a) dismiss the error pop-up, (b) checkout local `develop` branch manually, (c) pull this branch. Then it's up to date with `remote/develop`.\r\n\r\nWhat I'd like to see is for SrcTree to suggest me to perform \"step 2\" automatically (for example by adding a button to the error message shown in \"step 1\") if it detects there's a local branch that tracks remote branch `origin/develop`.\r\nAt least sub-steps 2a and 2b should be automated and pull dialog should be shown for me to choose if I want to rebase for example.",
