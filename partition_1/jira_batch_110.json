Also when in full screen if I do a cmd+0 to bring up the repo browser, it would be nice if it supported a split screen popup, rather than opening a separate full screen window. To see an example of what I\u00a0mean, open the native MacOS mail client in full screen mode. Then click compose new message button in the top right. It will enter split screen mode.\r\n\r\nit is worth noting that if you manually setup split screen mode with the repo browser on the right and the main window on the left, when opening a new window from the repo browser, mac OS already directly opens it as a new tab.",

This becomes a problem when using SourceTree in conjunction with a Jenkins multi branch pipeline. The latter one automatically creates and deletes a Jenkins job per branch as git branches appear or disappear. This means, when finishing a git-flow release using SourceTree, then the related Jenkins release job automatically gets deleted including the created artifacts, build logs and test reports. This destroyed our last software release, since the changed git-flow behavior was unexpected.\r\n\r\nSourceTree should at least provide an option, which is equivalent to the git-flow-ahv command line parameter\u00a0_--keepremote_.",

Next I opened a pull request and got it approved as all the changes were what was needed(Bit Bucket). I then conferred with my coworkers about the file that was off.

There was a significant mismatch between the two versions. The problem is that the diff only recognized the changes that I had implemented. and ignored everything else that changed.

However in a large enterprise, with thousands of projects and thousands of users, you can overwhelm even a multi-node Data Center instance with the number of REST API requests that are made.\r\n\r\nh2. Steps to Duplicate\r\n# Configure SourceTree to connect to a remote Bitbucket Server or Data Center instance that has a significant number of projects.\r\n# On the Bitbucket Server tail the atlassian-bitbucket.log\r\n# Enable Debug Logging in Bitbucket server\r\n# In SourceTree visit the Show Repository Browser page and then click Remote\r\n\r\nh3. Result:\r\nYou will see at least one and maybe two mentions of the REST API pre project that is being called\r\n{noformat}\r\n/rest/api/1.0/projects/{PROJKEY}/repos\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nFor a small or even medium sized instance this may not be noticed.  However is a large enterprise with up to 10,000 users and thousands of projects, when more than a few users are accessing the Repository Browser simultaneously the  number of REST API requests that are happening simultaneously can negatively impact the performance of Bitbucket Server.\r\n\r\nWhen you further complicate this with using Delegated LDAP for authentication, each of these REST API calls causes a validation to LDAP.  This can also cause thousands of SQL Update commands to be fired off updating the cwd_user table row for the user that is connecting to Bitbucket.\r\n\r\nh2. Desired Behavior\r\nA list of possible options not necessarily in any particular order:\r\n- Use a different REST API that returns all the users repositories they have access to with one call\r\n- Have the Repository Browser be paged so that only 10 or 15 projects are queried at a time\r\n- Change the UI so that you get a list of projects first (1 REST API call), and the display is updated with the repositories in the selected project (1 REST API call for every 25 repositories in the project)\r\n- Make browsing the available repositories optional, provide the ability to paste a clone URL without having to query every project",

      "description": "SourceTree is great - it's the best GUI git client I've used.\r\n\r\nBut the repo browser could be better.\u00a0 One of the problems I have is that I have lots of repos I save from github - I save interesting projects as I find them.\u00a0 Later, I want to organize them but I It's hard with only a vertical drag/scroll.\u00a0 It would be nice if there was some kind of tree view with repository groups on the left and repos on the right. If I want to move something from one group to another - I can drag to the group on the left.\r\n\r\nAnother common pain point would be able to see the files or at least the readme from the repo browser.\u00a0 I have repo called \"natural\" - what is that?\u00a0 NLP, Natural fit algo, etc.\u00a0 Now I have to open the repo and see - which is friction.\r\n\r\nAnother similar point point is that I would like to add a description and tags to repos.\u00a0 Eg.\u00a0 I might have 5 repos that are doing similar things and I want to keep them because each does something I like more - I would like to be able to write a comment to help me remember that.\u00a0 It would also be nice to have tags to group products in the way I want.\u00a0 Eg, all the projects that use a certain library (reactjs, scikit) or language (python, php, etc.)\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nI think these points could be solved without much difficulty and would make the client much more useful.",

      "description": "After upgrading to SourceTree Version 2.7 (152) today I'm seeing high CPU usage when SourceTree is running with one of my repositories open. I see sustained CPU usage from 90-100% (of one core) for around 30 seconds, which then reduces to 30-40%. It seems to spike back up to near 100% when the SourceTree window is in the background without focus (e.g. it's doing that as I write this report while SourceTree is behind my web browser).\r\n\r\nHigh CPU usage continues even after I close the repository window, until I quit and restart SourceTree. I have seen it drop back down to ~1-2% as well but when I first noticed the issue, SourceTree was hovering at high CPU usage even after I hadn't interacted with it for a while.\r\n\r\nI am seeing this with multiple private Git repositories from my company's Bitbucket account, but not with every repository.\u00a0Unfortunately I haven't found an open source repository that I can reproduce this problem with yet. I realize this would be a much better bug report with a repro against a publicly available repository \u2013 I don't have time to do more searching for one today but let me know if that is critical and I will try to get a better repro when I can.\r\n\r\nI did not see this problem prior to upgrading to 2.7 today.",
