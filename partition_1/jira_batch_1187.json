Suggested Solution\nAdd a \"Disable Outgoing Communication\" button to the *General Administration*, which would disable all outgoing feedback or subscription related messages/forms.\n \nh3. Workaround(s)\nh5. For the New Project Navigator feedback:\n# Stop JIRA;\n# Update the database with the following:\n{code:SQL|title=To disable the \"disable new project navigation\" link in the User Profile menu| borderStyle=solid| borderColor=#6A8EB3 |bgColor=#F8F8F8}\ninsert into pluginstate values ('com.atlassian.jira.jira-projects-plugin:enable-project-centric-navigation-user-option','false');\n{code}\n{code:SQL|title=To disable the Project Feedback Button| borderStyle=solid| borderColor=#6A8EB3 |bgColor=#F8F8F8}\ninsert into pluginstate values ('com.atlassian.jira.jira-projects-plugin:projects-feedback-web-panel','false');\ninsert into pluginstate values ('com.atlassian.jira.jira-projects-plugin:feedback-issue-collector','false');\n{code}\n# Restart JIRA.\n(i) Users will not be able to disable the new Project layout (as the link in their user profile menu to disable it brings up a feedback form). \n\nh5.

This prevents other projects from using the old project key as the key is still being occupied by other projects. All records of the project key should be removed so that other projects can use this specific key.\n\nh3.Workaround\nFor now users will have to remove the project entirely so that the records of all the project keys under the project will be removed. While this works for newly created projects; this is obviously not suitable workaround if the project already contains a lot of issues.",

Background\nIn support of our common Agile (weekly) release workflow, we affix a \"fixVersion\" to any jira ticket branch merged to our common {{develop}} branch. To facilitate effective, manual regression testing (our system tests already completed on {{develop}} as a nightly process), we branch weekly from {{develop}} (Release-YYYYMMDD) and release weekly. Any test fail is either reverted, fixed, temporarily tolerated for immediate follow-up \"next-day\" fix, release-noted, or rolled back to last \"clean\" label on develop (last option... \"baby with the bathwater\"). Lastly, if changes are currently passing manual regression, we release to master on release day (all tickets transitioned to {{released}} state)\n\nh2. The Problem: \"Automatability\" of Setting \"fix version\"\nWe want to leverage Jira and Stash to do a couple of things:\n# After each pull request merge, we want to affix a (new or existing) \"fix version\" to the tickets being merged to {{develop}}. We've installed [JJupin|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.keplerrominfo.jira.plugins.jjupin] but the \"destination branch\" in the Jira automated transition is not visible to our post function. The transition logic is as follows: \"If a pull request is merged and the destination branch is {{develop} then add \"YYYYMMDD\" (the \"develop\" scheduled release date) fix version to the ticket.\n# When a pull request is reverted (please implement STASH-3218?), remove any YYYYMMDD fix version from the ticket and reopen the jira ticket.\n\nh2. What we need?\n# Add more \"pull request\" data to the automated Jira transitions triggered by stash PRs such as \"source branch\", \"destination branch\" etc and make them visible to Jira post function actions. Greater PR data visibility allows for better, more customized decisions in the jira ticket workflow.",

Upon further investigation, using the [email logging feature|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Logging+email+protocol+details], we found that these invite emails were triggering a 554 email exception from SES because the From email address is not verified. Surely enough, the invite emails are being marked with the From address of the user sending the invite, which could, on top of this, lead to issues where mail clients think that JIRA is spoofing the From address due to failing authentication checks.\n\nCan you please either change the behavior of the invite feature to send the invites from the system address instead, to match the behavior for email notifications for issue changes (even by specific people), or make it a preference to enable this behavior?

Problem\n\nUsing a webhook triggered from a transition returns incomplete data specifically the {{to_status)) returns null. \n\nh3. Reason\n\nThe {{transition}} object that is being returned in the JSON contains the {{from_status}} and {{to_status}} attributes. From testing with a fresh workflow, and testing with your workflow, you'll notice that in the JSON object, {{from_status}} is always being returned correctly (even if it's {{null}} in the descriptor), whereas {{to_status}} is always returning the value of {{status}} from the workflow descriptor XML. This is apparent when examining the code in the jira-webhooks-plugin that populates the values for the JSON. The\n{{to_status}} is always going to be the status of the {{createdStep}}, which is populated from the database. Whereas {{from_status}} is actually being looked up in the jira workflow.\n\nh3. Workaround\n\nExport the XML of the workflow that you want to use the webhooks on, edit the {{status}} manually to something that makes sense, import the edited workflow, and continue to use the webhooks. You should only need to edit the {{status}} as it's the only attribute not being return correctly in the webhooks. \n",

Steps to Reproduce\n# Apply Issue level security to a large project containg ~>400 issues\n\nh3.Expected\nOperation completes successfully\n\nh3.Actual\nAfter ~60 seconds the page will timeout\n\nIf One of the following functions is initiated it can cause Other Errors to occur and the Instance Stops the progress of the Bulk operation and will leave some issues assigned to the scheme and others are not:\n- the Page is Refreshed before the XRSF token Error\n- Re-index is run\n- Attempt to run a second issue security association to the project\n\nThe above operations can lead to locking out all users From accessing the Tickets additional steps are needed if this occurs there are additional steps needed to fix detailed in this Knowledge-Base Article\n- https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRAKB/Issue+Security+Levels+Locks+Issues+From+All+Users\n\nh2.Workaround:\n1. open two tabs first tab issue security for the project and the other issue navigator with the Query {{project = <DESIRED_PROJECT> AND level is EMPTY}}\n2. Apply a Issue Security Scheme that causes a timeout at 60 seconds\nDO NOT RUN ANY OF THESE OPERATIONS until it completes the bulk assignment:\n- Running a re-index\n- Reloading the page after the timeout occurs\n- Attempting to run a new issue security association.\n\n3. Even though the timeout occurs in the UI the operation continues in the background\n- to track the progress use following JQL query In Issue Navigator after adding the security column to the issue navigator view.  (Note that the security level is noted by the JQL {{LEVEL}}):\n{code}\nproject = <Desired Project> AND level is EMPTY\n{code}\n\n4. once it no longer reruns results the operation is complete.\n- You can also run the following to confirm all issues associated properly:\n{{project = <Desired Project> AND level is not EMPTY}}\n\n5. When it completes run a full lock and re-index of the system to clear out all erroneous caching caused by the timeout. as the association will only display 50% of the time in the Issue security scheme unless the index is rebuilt.",

The only workaround provided by Atlassian is to use the bulk operation and remove the sprint id. But this is just a workaround and needs to be handled with care.\n\nPlease improve the clone operation and offer an option to purge the sprint field, similiar to the option to include attachments or links.

Problem Definition\n\nIdeally we would like the ability to prevent time tracking and logging work on our parent issue and have all done at the subtask level. \n\nh3. Suggested Solution\n\nSeems like Splitting the Time Tracking permissions in the Permission scheme could accomplish this for us. \n\nHaving the ability to add or remove log work on issues should be separate in project and issue level, for example like this: \n* Ability to Add Log Work on Parent Issues \n* Ability to Add Log Work on Subtask Issues. \n* Ability to Remove Log Work on Parent Issues \n* Ability to Remove Log Work on Subtask Issues. \n ",
