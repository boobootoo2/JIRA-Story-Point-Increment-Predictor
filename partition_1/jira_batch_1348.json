I could indirectly do this via the Atlassian OnDemand Google Apps SSO support. This would be an expensive route since my company does not currently use or plan to use Google Apps. Offering an on-premise or hosted CROWD to Atlassian OnDemand CROWD connection would be a better solution. A logical alternative might be a CROWD Directory Sync plugin to Atlassian OnDemand (similar in concept to the Google Apps Directory Sync - GADS)built by Atlassian or a 3rd party using the new/beta plugin framework. Unfortunately, I see no evidence of an existing, planned or requested plugin. This improvement suggestion is similar to AOD-3397",

The logout from Atlassian OnDemand is \"local\", i.e. the user is not logged out of Google on selecting the logout from the JIRA interface. That means google (gmail, calendar and, erm, JIRA) can still be accessed unchallenged after successfully logging out from Atlassian (assuming the same browser session). In this case I believe that the onus is on the service (JIRA) to inform the end user of the situation, and provide appropriate links to logout of the identity provider (Google). It would be trivial; a simple link to https://accounts.google.com/Logout. This is especially important for users on shared computers.",

      "description": "I originally submitted this item to Support.\r\nReference: https://support.atlassian.com/servicedesk/customer/jst/problem-report-96177\r\n\r\nThe resolution to my support ticket was to log a feature request for review by the engineering team. Please review the support items for all details but this is the summary, as reported by one of our user. \r\n\r\n1. Basically cookies can have a set life to live (remember me) before you need to renew them (even their webpage says - that it\u2019s set to 30 days). (...) Even though I have the cookie in my cookie list their web site ignores it when I browse with access to cookies turned off. I use this method with other sites, and they work, they just need renewing once in a while which I don\u2019t mind doing. (...) They must be trying to set the cookie or can\u2019t identify the fact that it exists.\r\n\r\nTo recap:\r\n1). The cookie file exists:\r\n2). I prefer to browse with nobody adding or updating current cookies - which works fine with other sites:\r\n3) Maybe it's related to them setting a google cookie as well (I always delete google cookies). \r\n\r\nNote: In this particular case, we were asked by your support department  to confirm if keeping the Google cookies made a difference - It did not. \r\n\r\nThe support reply read:Thanks for confirming!  The behavior is different because we are a different website. Our security model requires cookies for verification.\r\n\r\nMy response was: Thanks for the reply. However, this is a serious concern for us - especially for some of your consultants that are mindful of data access and tracking. I can see that if the users want to make some big changes to the account, then you'll need to update the cookie. Cookies are definitely good for security, but why do you require to have them turned on all the time to just read a page? Is it not possible to keeping settings in a database on your end? Or are you putting all the info into cookies and so that you need constant access to them on the user computer?\r\n\r\nYour comments would be greatly appreciated. ",

The API is an implementation of the [SCIM specification|http://www.simplecloud.info/] and is intended to be used to sync users and groups from an identity provider to an [Atlassian organization|https://confluence.atlassian.com/cloud/set-up-an-atlassian-organization-938859734.html]. Once you have linked an Atlassian Cloud site (like example.atlassian.net) to your organization, users and groups will be synced to your site and you can use them to control access to Jira and Confluence Cloud as well as permissions within those products. [Learn more about how automatic user provisioning works with Atlassian Cloud|https://confluence.atlassian.com/cloud/user-provisioning-959305316.html].\r\n\r\nThere are several key benefits to automating user provisioning for Atlassian Cloud:\r\n * It saves you time as an administrator by automating the process of creating and removing Atlassian accounts for your users\r\n * It improves security by reducing errors in the provisioning/deprovisioning process\r\n * It can help reduce costs by ensuring you are not billed for users who are no longer active\r\n\r\nThe SCIM API is intended for customers who are not already using one of our supported identity providers. [We currently support *Okta*|https://confluence.atlassian.com/cloud/configure-user-provisioning-with-okta-957492956.html] and are actively working on support for *Azure Active Directory* and *Onelogin*. If you are using one of these identity providers, we recommend using the supported Atlassian app for these identity providers as this will simplify the configuration process.\r\n\r\nWe're actively working in this area and will share another update when support for additional identity providers is available.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n Dave Meyer\r\n Atlassian Access Product Management\r\n{panel}\r\n\u00a0\u00a0",

      "description": "{panel:title=Atlassian Status as of 19 Nov 2014|borderStyle=solid|borderColor=#3c78b5|titleBGColor=#3c78b5|bgColor=#e7f4fa}\r\nHi everyone,\r\n\r\nThank you for providing your feedback here. It's obvious that our recent changes to simplify the experience for user creation has created problems for some of you.\r\n\r\nWe have been reviewing all the feedback that's come through. The primary issues so far are:\r\n # Admins are unable to explicitly set a username during new user account creation\r\n # Admins are unable to control if emails are sent to new users about their account\r\n\r\nWe are looking to address this feedback by essentially bringing back a version of the old create user screen that would allow admins to explicitly create a user, specify username at the same time and have the option to control email send.\r\n\r\nWhile we are working on this, we wanted to draw your attention to a new feature that we've just released that should help in the interim and has also been an existing feature request. *You are now able to change usernames for users.* This is available right now for all instances (excluding currently those that are integrated with Google Apps). You can do this on a per user basis via the \u2018edit\u2019 button on a user\u2019s page. You may need to refresh your page if you don't see that you can do it immediately. This can be used as a temporary measure to change the usernames for newly created users until we have the create user experience fixed.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, there is no straightforward workaround to stop the sending of an email to new users in the interim. \r\nA way to get around this: use an email address that you have access to (it cannot be currently used in your OnDemand site), in order to intercept the email sent. When you receive the email, click on the link to set the password to complete the account setup and then change the email address to the correct one.\r\n\r\nSome of you mentioned that there was a lack of communication about this change. We followed our standard pre-release communication process here and mentioned this before the release came about. We publish pre-release upgrade notes every week before a release is planned to go out - [this was last week\u2019s|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/AOD/2014/11/13/Upcoming+Atlassian+OnDemand+upgrade+for+week+starting+on+16+November+2014]. If you\u2019re not doing so already, I recommend that you \u2018watch\u2019 [all blog posts|https://confluence.atlassian.com/pages/viewrecentblogposts.action?key=AOD] in the AOD space to receive these updates in your inbox.\r\n\r\nThanks again for your feedback,\r\nHelen Hung\r\nProduct Manager\r\n{panel}\r\nA new update for user management in Atlassian OnDemand has been released and customers are unable to customise the username for new users.\r\n\r\n[https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/AOD/16+November+2014+to+21+November+2014]\r\n{quote}In addition to this change, we've also combined the \"Create user\" and \"Invite user\" functionality. To add a new user, click the Create users button and enter the email addresses of the users for which you'd like to create an account. Usernames will automatically be generated based on users' email addresses. New users will be sent an email to set their password.\r\n\r\nNote: The license count is updated when you create the user (not when the user logs in), so creating users takes a license for each application you give them access to.\r\n A new update for user management in Atlassian OnDemand has been released and it removed the option to create users manually.\r\n{quote}",

Basic Idea\r\n\r\nIt would be fantastic if, should a user not exist in the system, I could just invite them from wherever I happened to be in such a way that they would have permission to access whatever resource that I invited them to see.\r\n\r\nHopefully I would see something like this:\r\n\r\n!Screen Shot 2014-09-10 at 1.44.54 pm.png!\r\n\r\nh2. Requirements\r\n\r\n* Every product in the Atlassian suite would work this way with harmonious UI.\r\n* Non-admins would be able to use this feature too (with an approval flow).\r\n* Works with all places in which I see a list of users. Mentions, JIRA Fields etc.\r\n\r\nh3. Optional Extras\r\n\r\n* Users are granted access to see whatever they are mentioned on when invited. (Or, I will be told that the invited user will not be able to see the system when invited)",
