In fact, if we edited any of the fields showing this problem, the edition box was showing the correct values.\n\nAfter switching back to the original Project key pattern, this problem disappeared. \n\nWe would like to know if this behaviour would be reproduced in the newest Jira versions. \n\nThanks in advance for your help. \nMarc",

It might be reflected in JIRA as specific version, like \"v2\", or \"next\". Issues related to that version should by default go to the person who is doing those changes (version lead), not current maintainers of previous version components.\n\nSo my proposal is to add support for version-based default assignee. To avoid conflicts with component-based default assignee it should be also possible to set priorities between those. So for v1 issues would go to component lead, and for v2 it would be version lead who gets the issues by default.",

I'm pretty sure I'm instead seeing the \"original estimate\" minus the \"time spent\" field. \n\nI've attached a picture showing the burndown for tasks assigned to one of my users and the difference this can make. On the left, the chart filters out any closed tasks (which have their remaining estimates at 0, since no work effort remains) and only sums the remaining estimates of open or in-progress tasks. On the right, the filter is simply assignee=KB, and it shows over 100 additional hours. \n\n_(By way of explanation, this user was assigned a few tasks that were overflow when others needed to adjust their sprint commitments due to scope creep. These may have had large original estimates but the remaining effort was much less, as you can see in the charts.)_\n\nWithout getting into discussions about how we use the remaining estimate field and whether or not to update it, the issue is that in the Agile board's configuration settings, I'm lead to believe that the red \"Remaining Values\" line represents the sum of the \"remaining estimates\" field, which it is not, and should be.",

In the attached example, the x axis shows the age and the y axis shows the qty of issues. Issue status is showed by different colors. The number in the colored histogram is the issue qty of each status, and with a total qty above the histogram for the calculated time base. We would like to know if you can develop such kind of report chart in JIRA. If feasible, how long do you need to have it ready? Because we need to report the feasibility and the timing needed to senior management by this Thursday. So could you please send us a detailed feedback by end of this Wednesday (June 25th)?

In order to be able to, on the one hand, keep traceability as to what issue (Story, Bug, Improvement) is developed and released in what version, and, on the other hand be able to prepare and manage a single backlog of features that need implementation in, possibly, multiple artefacts (add shoppingcart on web, android, ios for example),.... I think it would be a great improvement if JIRA would support the concept of a \"Product\" and let that take the role of the Project. Product would then be used to manage versions, components and be tied to a VCS. Project on the other hand, would then be used to manage....eh....projects, like big things with a start- and end-date that aim to specifically create a BIG piece of added functionality. ",

However, this should only be used as a last resort and only in the event that decreasing the value of *Time Between Eviction Runs* has not reduced or prevented problems with database connections closing.\n\n*Default value*\nfalse\n(when not specified in dbconfig.xml)\n{quote}\n\nHowever, looking into the [Apache DBCP Documentation|http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-dbcp/configuration.html], we can see that the default value for this option is *true*:\n{quote}\n|| Parameter || Default || Description ||\n| (...) | (...) | (...) |\n| testOnBorrow | true | The indication of whether objects will be validated before being borrowed from the pool. If the object fails to validate, it will be dropped from the pool, and we will attempt to borrow another.|\n{quote}\n\nThis means that the validation query is executed *every time a connection is borrowed from the pool*.\n\nI have confirmed this behaviour by enabling SQL logging on PostgreSQL and confirming the validation query was executed every time a query was triggered from JIRA. \n\nWe should review our documents which provide a sample {{dbconfig.xml}} with a validation query, as this parameter (<pool-test-on-borrow>) should be explicitly declared as *false* in those examples:\n- https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Connecting+JIRA+to+PostgreSQL\n- https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Connecting+JIRA+to+SQL+Server+2008\n- https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Connecting+JIRA+to+Oracle\n- https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Connecting+JIRA+to+MySQL\n- https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Surviving+Connection+Closures\n\nI will also update the [Tuning Database Connections|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Tuning+Database+Connections] document to correct parameter value there.",
