Previously they were able to do this - as from the [Answers|https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/33842/jira-creates-new-users-when-importing-issues-from-csv] thread:\n\n{quote}\nJIRA Importers Plugin bundled with JIRA 4.4.x does not allow anymore to skip creation of the users. We decided to remove this option as the import would have failed for these rows from CVS which indicate missing usernames. That in our opinion did not make sense and we wanted to simplify the import wizard.\n\nImporter expects a username in CSV file, not Display Name. There is no easy work-around for it at them moment. You could either pre-process your CSV file by replacing all \"Display Name\" cells with corresponding users, or you could hack JIRA Importer Plugin on your own - its source it available for all JIRA commercial license holders.\n{quote}\n\nCan you please update the the following docs to have something about that in there?\n\nhttp://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA044/Importing+Data+from+CSV\nhttp://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Importing+Data+from+CSV\n\nThanks!",

This could be very useful if it e-mailed the list of issues, in the same way that a filter subscription already does.  As it stands, the Share feature only sends a link to the issue...but there's already the long-standing \"permalink\" button just to the left of Share that gives me that URL already.  So, as it exists today, the Share button only saves me pasting the permalink into an e-mail, and provides almost no additional value.\n\nWhen Sharing an individual issue, most of what I've said above is true (in that case, I don't even need to click permalink, I can just use the issue's URL), but the e-mail has a little more relevant data, especially in the Text version.\n\nNote that knowing the velocity templates used by these functions (i.e. which could be customized for a JIRA instance) would be an acceptable workaround for this problem (provided the velocity template for Sharing filter results could be modified to include the results themselves).",

This, and my lack of experience in setting up workflows, screens, etc, may well be the cause of the issue. However this sort of error should preferably not occur due to user error.\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n\nIn IE9: \n- Restore attached data\n- Create an issue in the QA project\n- Transition the newly created issue to \"In Progress\" by clicking Workflow -> Start Progress\n- Click \"QA Time\"\n- Enter a tester name and submit the form.\n-- Please note that sometimes the transition buttons under the Ops Bar do not update. If this occurs then it's certain that there's going to be an SQL error. In this case click Workflows -> Back to In Development\n- If no error occurs transition \"Back to Development\"\n- Repeat the above steps alternating tester value from admin to fred and back until an SQL error is displayed as follows:\n\n{quote}\nCould not move to history step for #12694: root cause: while inserting: [GenericEntity:OSHistoryStep][id,13052][caller,admin][startDate,2012-04-17 16:19:08.781][status,Not Done][owner,][finishDate,2012-04-17 16:19:32.143][actionId,791][stepId,3][dueDate,null][entryId,12694] (SQL Exception while executing the following:INSERT INTO PUBLIC.OS_HISTORYSTEP (ID, ENTRY_ID, STEP_ID, ACTION_ID, OWNER, START_DATE, DUE_DATE, FINISH_DATE, STATUS, CALLER) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?)

For example: \n\nAn outage will be taken on the system in 5:00 minutes. The outage is expected to last for 30:00 minutes. During this time, you will not have access to the system. Please wrap up your current activities. If you have questions or concerns regarding this outage, please contact a JIRA Administrator. \n\nThe 5:00 minutes in this example would countdown. \nJIRA Administrator would be linked to the default JIRA Administrators contact page. \nThe two times would be configurable by the Admin.

We fixed this vulnerability by only allowing plain text or [wiki markup|https://jira.atlassian.com/secure/WikiRendererHelpAction.jspa?section=all] in the project description.\n\nWe would like to come up with a compromise if possible that still allows customers to accomplish what they were previously using the project description for in a secure way. In order for that to happen we would like to know how you were using the project description. Please comment on this issue to let us know how you have been using HTML in the project description.\n\nRegards,\n\nRoy Krishna\nJIRA OnDemand Product Manager",
