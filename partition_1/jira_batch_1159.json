It appears that the only way to support this is by adding additional project administrators.  Unfortunately that also grants other powers, like updating project user/role assignments.  This then grants more people to temporarily give and remove project roles for themselves and others that they know may give other powers, i.e. delete all comments, edit all comments, which do not have a History audit trail.\n\nThe ability to suppress a bulk change e-mail should be it's own standalone permission on the permission screen.  (really, bulk changes should be a project permission and not a global permission, so if you want to solve both of those, that'd be great).",

This looks like a major step backwards. (The pie chart changed, so did the horizontal bar chart, and the Created vs Resolved chart.)\n* The softer color palette (that was there yesterday) was modern and clean... these new Vivid bright primary colors - hard colors - looks like someone designed this in the mid-1990s. \n\nSorry guys, but this looks terrible. It looks like it was designed by a 60-year old with a copy of Office 98. For the love of God, change it back\n\nYou guys took a magical UI and stepped backwards more than a decade.\n\n----\n(edit) \nMore problems I noticed:\n1. You changed the font size and made it smaller. Change it back\n2. The data in the pie charts is now missing. It was replaced with cartoonish leader lines that make it much more difficult to determine where the data is pointing. You basically rendered the pie chart useless.\n3. The donut chart was perfect... its still listed in the Gadgets under pie chart, but if you try to add the donut chart back, you cant. Augh\n\nThis is really frustrating. We took a lot of time to set up these dashboards - and now they look totally different. I would be embarrassed to show this to a potential client.\n",

This does not tell administrator if the mail queue is currently stuck or what is the reason of it being stuck.\n\nh3. Suggested Solution\nAdd a checker to check the current status of the mail queue, for example:\n* To check if the mail queue is actually sending mail or populating mail by filter subscription\n* Provide information of the last time a notification mail was delivered\n* Show a portion of the error from the log indicating what causing outgoing mail failure\n \nh3.

Actual Results\nMail queue is stuck, no outgoing mail is send. Manually flushing mail queue does not work.\n \nh3. Notes\nFilter Subscription that will generate the mails for each users will obtain a lock on the Mail queue on MailQueueImpl#addItem. The mail sender couldn't take lock for MailQueueImpl#sendBuffer to send those mails that already in the Mail queue due to it being locked by Filter subscription.\n\nh3.Workaround\nDepending on use-case:\n# Set Group Filter Subscription to use a group that has a smaller user count <200 users.\n# Create a mailing list in Mail Server to be configured for the Filter Subscription. Create a dummy user in JIRA to be assign with the mailing list and the user will be the one subscribing to the Filter Subscription. Users who should be receiving mail subscription needs to be part of the mailing list.\n\n",

For example, on my team John may be the person on my team to set up their phone but Jim is the person to set up their computer. I need the original ticket to kick-off tasks that automatically go out to my team.\nThe purpose of the new hire request ticket is to gather all of the information we need to set up a new employee. Then, using the information entered, new tasks should be assigned to the team members which I have pre-configured. For example, John will always be the person to set up phones and Jim will always be the person to set up computers.\n\nh3.

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-61439].\n  {panel}\n\nOK, so you've seen this one before. I believe JRA-36670 contains the most thorough discussion of the issue.\n\nI'm raising this as a bug because that is exactly how the behavior feels to the end user.\n\nLet me be clear. I get that the UX books say that every element should be aligned to the user's expectation, and that behavior should be consistent throughout the system. That's well and good, and to Krzysztof Piwowar's point in the above-mentioned ticket. \n\nIn this case, your feature (quickly back out of a text box or close modal by pressing escape, without any confirm prompt) clearly and painfully violates the following user expectations:\n* That data (changes) will not be lost. This is a completely reasonable expectation.\n** To cite a clear example of this...If I'm using MS Outlook and I click to write a new email, a new window pops up. If I have made no changes, pressing 'esc' will quickly close the window.\n** However, if I have made any changes, I am PROMPTED whether I want to close the window or not.\n* A feature should not frustrate users or unnecessarily cause them additional time and effort.\n** Judging by the number of bug tickets raised for this issue, and my own experiences, it's clear that this feature is causing frustration and additional investment of time.\n\nI type quickly, and sometimes, things happen that break my flow. For example:\n* If I bring up a right-click menu, I may instinctively press escape to close it out. Instead, I lose all my work. In fact, I just did this before deciding to write this ticket.\n* Behavior is not consistent between the \"create ticket\" modal and the edit ticket page.\n** ie if I click out of the edit box on the edit ticket page, my work is saved. However, if I click out of a text box in the create ticket modal, my work is NOT saved. Sometimes, while working quickly, I forget that the behavior is not the same.\n** Thus, if for any reason I press escape while the modal is active, I lose all my work.\n* If another app pops up while I'm writing, I may tap 'esc' a few times (again, instinctively :) ). This will cause me to lose all my unsaved work in the ticket.\n\nSo, either:\na) This is a bad feature that should be removed.\nor, more likely,\nb) JIRA is missing a feature to check for changes, and prompt the user to confirm changes if they have been made.\n\nThe latter would take all the pain away, while presenting the user with a predictable and efficient experience.\n\nI sincerely hope that this feedback can help your product team improve the feature set. JIRA is an incredible piece of software that I use for most of my day. I can't imagine life without it. However, I'm one lost chunk of work away from doing all of my writing in Word or a 3rd party editor, and only copying it to the ticket once it's complete. This would be a pain, but far better than losing my work on a semi-regular basis.",

The remaining 50% are still active in LDAP but are highly unlikely to use JIRA.  In fact most only have an account because at some point they reported, commented or updated a JIRA issue from an instance that has now been consolidated/migrated.  I would like to be able to deactivate these users to save license costs and I am aware of existing tooling (the user deactivator tool, for example) to do just this.\n\nThe problem is that if I deactivate a user who subsequently tries to login they will fail and this will result in a support request to reactivate.\n\nSo my request is that accounts can be automatically reactivated on login.\n\nRoy",

This is not properly highlighted in the documentation. This is the documentation on the permission query.\n\n* https://docs.atlassian.com/jira/REST/latest/#api/2/user-findUsersWithAllPermissions\n\nThe above link didn't really specify that there global and project level permissions. Not knowing this, users sometimes try to search for global permissions on project level. \n\n*Doesn't Work* - {{https://testinstance.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user/permission/search?permissions=SYSTEM_ADMIN&projectKey=<PROJECT_KEY>}}\n\n*Works* - {{https://testinstance.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user/permission/search?permissions=SYSTEM_ADMIN}}\n\nThe reason the first one doesn't work is because sysadmin is a global permission; finding a global permission on project level will fail. This is expected but wasn't highlighted in the documentation. Perhaps global and project permissions should be highlighted at {{https://developer.atlassian.com/static/javadoc/jira/6.0/reference/com/atlassian/jira/security/Permissions.Permission.html?_ga=1.110401797.183676958.1465802124}} ?",

Summary\nWhen trying to quick create an issue in a JIRA backlog with many issues, the issue type cannot be rendered on the screen because the types are cut off by the bottom of the browser window. Note: this only occurs when the number of issues in the backlog consumes the majority of the screen.\n\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\n# Create a JIRA Scrum project\n# Create a large number of issues for your backlog\n# Depending on the size of your screen, the number required to trigger the bug will vary. Essentially you will need the backlog to reach the bottom fourth of the screen.\n# Try creating a new issue and changing the issue type for the backlog by clicking the down arrow next to *What needs to be done?* \n\nh3. Expected Results\nThe pop up box displays the full list of issue types as shown below:\n!expected_view.png|thumbnail!\nh3. Actual Results\nThe full list of issue types is not displayed because the pop-up window is cut off by the bottom of the browser window, as shown below:\n!backlog_create_issue.png|thumbnail!\n\n\nh3.Workaround\nIf you adjust the size of the browser window by dragging right corner of the browser window to make it smaller and then scroll down, the issue type pop-up will become fully visible.

Summary\nAfter JIRA is started up or its cache is cleared, loading a project will execute a {{findAll()}} method to cache all components that exist in the instance. In large installations, this causes the loading of projects for the first time to take a long time (easily more than 30 seconds).\n\nh3. Expected Behavior\nWhile caching all components should reduce processing in subsequent project loads, it causes a bad experience in cold caching.\n\nWe should be caching components in a per-project basis.\n\nh3. Actual Behavior\nJIRA builds a cache of all components for all projects upon the loading of any project. This causes severe slowness in cold cache situations.\n\nThe below stack can be seen in thread dumps, if took at the time any project is being loaded for the first time after JIRA's startup.\n\n{noformat}\nat com.atlassian.jira.bc.project.component.CachingProjectComponentStore.findAll(CachingProjectComponentStore.java:280)\n\tat com.atlassian.jira.bc.project.component.CachingProjectComponentStore.findByComponentNameCaseInSensitive(CachingProjectComponentStore.java:145)\n\tat com.atlassian.jira.bc.project.component.DefaultProjectComponentManager.findByComponentNameCaseInSensitive(DefaultProjectComponentManager.java:364)\n\tat com.atlassian.jira.jql.resolver.ComponentResolver.getIdsFromName(ComponentResolver.java:28)\n{noformat}\n\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\n* Create a large number of components, around 3000 should be enough;\n* Restart JIRA;\n* Upon startup, load any project in the instance. Notice the time it takes for the page to load and compare it with subsequent loads of any other project;\n\nh3. Workaround\nAt this point, there is no known workaround for this. However, the slowness is only noticed at the first time any issue update happens, until a restart of JIRA.",

[See the corresponding bug report|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-61382].\n  {panel}\n\nh3. Summary\nFieldValidationException on URL custom field with no default value after having a default value.\n\nh3. Environment\n* Jira 7.1\n* Jira 6.4.7 and 6.4.13\n\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\n# Install JIRA 7.1.x using default values.\n# Create a new custom field of type URL field.\n# Populate the custom field with a default value: https://support.atlassian.com but any link will work.\n# Remove the default value by clicking \"Edit Default Value, removing the text and then clicking the \"Set Default\" button.\n# Then see this exception in the atlassian-jira.log.\n# Click create an issue and see two exceptions in the atlassian-jira.log.\n# Finish creating an issue and see two simular exceptions as above in the atlassian-jira.log.\n\nBefore adding a default value, there are no rows in genericconfiguration.  After adding the value then deleting it, there is a row in my test instance:\n{code:sql}\n10500 | DefaultValue | 10903   | <string></string>\n{code} \n\nI have confirmed that these steps work to reproduce the issue in JIRA 6.4.7 and 6.4.13 as listed in [JRA-35222|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRA-35222].  The missing step to reproduce this issue in JRA-35222 was to have a value set and then deleted.\n\nThis issue has no known issues that it creates.  The only affect known at this time is the logs.\n\nh3. Expected Results\nI would not expect to have these logs.\n\nh3.

It's _almost_ [ISO 8601|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601] compliant, but slightly different:\n* It demands time zone offsets in the form \\[\\+\\-\\]hhmm instead of the ISO format, \\[\\+\\-\\]hh:mm.\n* It fails to parse if there is no fractional seconds, even if that fraction is 0 (e.g. {{2016-06-08T23:44:57+0000}} is not accepted while {{2016-06-08T23:44:57.00+0000}} is).\n\nThese differences, while subtle,  break compatibility with standard date/time libraries, requiring the user to \"fix up\" library-provided strings before POSTing them to JIRA. Even worse, instead of returning HTTP 400 and indicating the error as some message (as the API docs say JIRA should), POSTs to {{/rest/api/2/issue/\\{issueIdOrKey\\}/worklog}} (and possibly other endpoints) return HTTP 500 if JIRA is unsatisfied with the date, giving no indication of what went wrong.\n\n*To Reproduce:*\nPOST to {{/rest/api/2/issue/\\{issueIdOrKey\\}/worklog}} to a \"started\" value of some ISO 8601 date and time, e.g. {{2016-06-08T23:44:57+00:00}}\n\n*Desired Fixes:*\n# The JIRA API should accept date and time strings in standard ISO 8601 formats.\n# When times cannot be parsed, HTTP 400 should be returned instead of a HTTP 500 \"Internal Server Error\"",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-61376].\n  {panel}\n\nh3. Problem Definition\nCurrently in JIRA, users can create duplicate custom fields. This is a problem because if a user creates a custom field with the same name as a default JIRA field and adds it to screens, it can make reporting in JIRA and in Portfolio inaccurate. An example field is *Story Points*. A user could create any number of *Story Points* fields and associate them with screens, but Portfolio will only read the field with the default field ID and thus, Story Points will not populate in Portfolio.\n\nDuplicate fields can also cause other issues and confusion for site administrators. \n\nh3. Suggested Solution\n Prevent users from creating duplicate custom fields or at the very least display warning messages about custom fields being created with the same name as default JIRA fields. \n\nAn issue could arise where this solution would prevent users from importing projects because their projects have the same field name as a field already in existence in the destination instance. This could be worked around by renaming those fields in the source instance. \n",

Migration from Cloud to Server fails because there are data that exceeds 255 character. \n\nh2.Steps to Replicate\n\nThis happens because the table has a limit of 255 characters and when Oracle imports the data it thinks that it has more characters. This happens cause the column is not configured correctly when imported.\nTo reproduce this just create comments in issues of more than 255 characters and then try to export the data to an Oracle DB\n\nh2.Workaround\n\n*Solution 1*\nBefore importing the data you can change the size of the column in the DB to more than 255 characters.\n\n*Solution 2*\n1) Before importing (make sure that the Database is empty) edit the activeobjects.xml \n2) find the table and change the precision to more than 255.\nThis is how it looks:\n{code}\n<table name=\"AO_ED979B_EVENTPROPERTY\">\n<column name=\"EVENT_ID\" primaryKey=\"false\" autoIncrement=\"false\" sqlType=\"4\" precision=\"10\"/>\n<column name=\"ID\" primaryKey=\"true\" autoIncrement=\"true\" sqlType=\"4\" precision=\"10\"/>\n<column name=\"KEY\" primaryKey=\"false\" autoIncrement=\"false\" sqlType=\"12\" precision=\"255\"/>\n<column name=\"VALUE\" primaryKey=\"false\" autoIncrement=\"false\" sqlType=\"12\" precision=\"255\"/>\n</table>\n{code}\nYou should change this line to something like this:\n{code}\n<column name=\"VALUE\" primaryKey=\"false\" autoIncrement=\"false\" sqlType=\"12\" precision=\"512\"/>\n{code}",
