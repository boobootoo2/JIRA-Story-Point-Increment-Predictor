      "description": "Crucible currently (4.8) cannot anchor a patch for a file with revision \"nonexistent\" which is a new file which has not been committed yet. It can, however anchor patches when the revision number is revision 0. \r\n\r\nSince there seems to have been a change in the way SVN (or Tortoise SVN) handles patches in newer SVN versions 1.9+ which are supported in modern versions of Crucible, we should be able to handle this case. ([tortoisesvn \\- Unable to parse diff revision header &#39;non existent&#39; in tortoise svn? \\- Stack Overflow|https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32434108/unable-to-parse-diff-revision-header-non-existent-in-tortoise-svn]\r\n\r\nh4. More details\r\n In SVN 1.7 (and reportedly 1.8) such new files were delineated in the patch as below, being a diff with respect to revision 0, essentially:\r\n\r\nIndex: path/to/file.ts\r\n===================================================================\r\n--- path/to/file.ts (revision 0)\r\n+++ path/to/file.ts (working copy)\r\n\r\nWhile on newer SVN versions the generated patch instead marks the file as nonexistent in the working copy, and Crucible is unable to draw an equivalence between this new notation and the previous revision 0 reference\r\n\r\nIndex: path/to/file.ts\r\n===================================================================\r\n--- path/to/file.ts (nonexistent)\r\n+++ path/to/file.ts (working copy)\r\n\r\nh4. Clarifications\r\nNote, that it should only be able to anchor new files when the patch *also* contains diffs from existing files. A patch containing only new files will not be anchored.\r\n\r\nWhen trying to anchor a file, Crucible will search for matches in the files in its database. Crucible will analyze all the paths in the patch, find the branches containing all those paths, then anchor the patch to the trunk or the branch with the most recent commit activity - so the path needs to have already been committed.\r\n\r\nh4. Workaround\r\nManually replace _nonexistent_ with _revision 0_ before uploading the patch, for example\r\n{noformat}\r\n sed s/nonexistent/revision 0/\r\n{noformat}",

A Git branch is not showed in the {{Browse Changesets}} option in Crucible when adding content to a review. \r\n\r\nh3. Environment\r\nGit repository added to a Crucible instance.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Download the attached [^git-micro.zip] test repository.\r\n# Add the repository to Crucible.\r\n# Create a review in Crucible, click {{Add content}}. Next click on {{Browse Changesets}}.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nCrucible showing all the branches present in the Git repository.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nCrucible shows only the 'dev' and 'new-branch-3' branches in the 'Browse changesets' dialog:\r\n\r\n !git-micro-add-changesets.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\nThe 'Add branches' dialog shows all six branches:\r\n\r\n !git-micro-add-branches.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\nAll of the 'feature', 'dev' and 'master' branches point to different commits (unlike in CRUC-6955). Both 'dev' and 'master' branches contain own (merge) commits:\r\n !git-micro-commit-graph.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\nh3. Notes\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround #1\r\n\r\nUse the 'Add branches' dialog. You may also remove changesets or files one-by-one after adding a branch (using the edit mode).\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround #2\r\n\r\nInstall the attached [^baserevisioncache-findbranches-use-lucene.btm] Byteman script ([how to install the script|https://confluence.atlassian.com/fishkb/enable-byteman-for-additional-logging-in-fisheye-and-crucible-943956769.html] ).

Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n # Repository indexing must be in progress\r\n # Create a code review with few recently committed files\r\n # Open files in a code review to mark them as read\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nReview progress should increase up to 100%\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nReview progress stays at 0% (or at some arbitrary percentage) and does not increase. \r\n\r\nPage reload does not help.\r\n\r\nh3. Notes\r\n\r\nWhenever user adds a file to a code review, Crucible fetches necessary data from Fisheye's repository index and stores it in the SQL database. Whenever Crucible needs the data, it is being read from the SQL database. It happens that also a number of lines added and removed in given file revision is persisted in the DB. You can find this data in the cru_fr_detail table - the cru_name column contains linesAdded or linesRemoved properties and cru_value column stores the value of a property.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, when Subversion repository is being indexed, LOC calculation is calculated in a later phase. It can happen that when user adds a file to a code review, its added/removed lines are 0 and this is persisted in the DB. As a result, even if indexing is finished, old value remains in the code review. As a result, review progress can get stuck at 0% (or another percentage, if some of the files in a code review had LOC available).\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nPlease follow steps below to reindex the data on repository start. It happens only if an undocumented 'rescan.crucible.revisions' repository property is set to 'true'. \r\n\r\n\r\n1. Download the [^byteman_resccan_crucible_revisions.btm] file to your Fisheye server. Edit the fie and replace REPOSITORY_NAME with name of repository you want to refresh.\r\n\r\n[Install the Byteman rule|https://confluence.atlassian.com/fishkb/enable-byteman-for-additional-logging-in-fisheye-and-crucible-943956769.html]. Example commands:\r\n\r\n{noformat}\r\n$ export FISHEYE_LOAD_BYTEMAN=1\r\n\r\n$ ./bin/start.sh\r\n(wait until Crucible starts)\r\n\r\n$ ./tools/byteman/list-rules.sh\r\nno rules installed\r\n\r\n$ ./tools/byteman/load-rules.sh byteman_resccan_crucible_revisions.btm\r\ninstall rule RepositoryPropertyManager_rescan_crucible_revisions\r\n\r\n$ ./tools/byteman/list-rules.sh \r\n# File byteman_resccan_crucible_revisions.btm line 5\r\nRULE RepositoryPropertyManager_rescan_crucible_revisions\r\nCLASS com.atlassian.fecru.properties.RepositoryPropertyManagerImpl\r\nMETHOD loadProperty\r\nAT EXIT\r\nIF \"REPOSITORY_NAME\".equals($1) && \"rescan.crucible.revisions\".equals($2)\r\nDO\r\norg.slf4j.LoggerFactory.getLogger(\"Byteman\").info(\"RepositoryPropertyManagerImpl#loadProperty({}, {}) returning true\", new Object[] \\{$0, $1});\r\nreturn \"true\"\r\nENDRULE\r\nTransformed in:\r\nloader: com.cenqua.fisheye.FishEyeClassLoader@1be6f5c3\r\ntrigger method: com.atlassian.fecru.properties.RepositoryPropertyManagerImpl.loadProperty(java.lang.String,java.lang.String) java.lang.String\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\n3. Go to Administration > Server. Turn debugging on.\r\n\r\n4. Go to Administration > Repositories > REPOSITORY_NAME > Summary tab. Click 'Stop' and next 'Start'.\r\n\r\n5. Check logs that Crucible reindex has started and completed for this repository.

      "description": "h3. Issue Summary\r\n\r\nIn Crucible, when attempting to \"add revisions\" to a review, only revisions which exist in the same physical path can be added as a single file (showing a diff), making revisions from previous branches (different physical paths for SVN & P4) appear as different files when added.\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nSetup:\r\n # Create trunk branch\r\n # Commit revs 1, 2, 3 to trunk on file \"test.txt\"\r\n # Create branch-A as a copy of trunk to a new location\r\n # Branch-A - commit revs 4, 5, 6 on file \"test.txt\"\r\n\r\nResults based on starting a review with only rev 5 added:\r\n * Adding rev 1, 2, or 3 will cause \"test.txt\" to appear as a separate file from rev 5.\r\n * Adding rev 4 will allow revs 1,2,3 from trunk to be added and displayed as a proper diff of rev 5.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nCrucible should calculate the ancestry of a revision/file despite the change in physical path changes. All historical revisions of a specific file should be available.\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nOnly revisions from the current branch (physical path) can be added ad a proper diff. To add other branches, an intermediate revision is required.\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nAdding the intermediate revision, specifically the first revision from the newly created branch, allows the previous branch's revisions to become available.",

      "description": "h4. Problem\r\nIn pre-commit reviews, automatic patch anchoring can take a long time for repositories with many branches, trying to find the relevant context/latest branch.\r\n\r\nAs a user, I would like the option to be able to select the branch where patch should be anchored.\r\n\r\nh4. Suggested functionality\r\n1) Open \"Add content to Review\" screen\r\n2) Click on \"Pre-commit\" option\r\n3) After clicking on pre-commit option there should be new or additional popup screen with the (non required) option of choosing a specific branch for patch.\r\n\r\nIf a branch is not selected, it can default to automatic anchoring.
