Problem:\nThe 'Resolution' field can not retain original value during Bulk Close issue, when performing the bulk transitions from issue navigator. This is only happen when the 'close issue' transition is using the same screen with 'Resolve issue' transition, which screen contains 'Resolution' filed.\n\nh3. Steps to reproduce:\n# Use the same screen for 'close issue'(in Resolved status) and 'Resolve issue' transition, make sure the screen contain 'Resolution' value.\n# Search for 3 issue in one project which have different 'Assingee', 'Reporter' and 'Resolution', but same status 'Resolved'. As showing below:\n!Capture.JPG|thumbnail!\n# Bulk Transition this 3 issues, choose 'close issue', click on next, it will show:\n!Capture2.JPG|thumbnail!\n\nWhich will force to change the resolution, unlike the 'Change Assignee' can uncheck and keep the same Assignee, even the 3 tickets are having the different 'Assignee'. In this case, if I change the resolution in this step, all the issues will be changed with same Resolution, as shown below:\n!Capture3.JPG|thumbnail!\n\nh3. Workaround\nBefore doing the bulk edit, remove the *Resolution* field from the Screen. Alternatively, create a draft of the workflow, make the *Close* transition use a different screen, and publish the draft. Only then try to bulk transition the issues.",

It could be a file called {{atlassian-jira-sysinfo.log}}. \nSometimes you want to retrieve this information, but it's hard to track if you have tons of JIRA logs and need to search for the last restart. This could be also very useful in case of an instance being down and System Information is not available through JIRA UI.\n\nPlease let me know if this is possible to implement.\nThanks!",
