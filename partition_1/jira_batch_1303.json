[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-7948].\n  {panel}\n\nThis is somewhat related to JRA-2581. This is our most pressing problem regarding JIRA right now.  We have a number of projects which depend on a rather large set of common libraries.  When issues are reported they are reported against a given product even though the bug may be down in the common libraries affecting a number of products.  Many times it is not obvious if the issue is at the application level or down in the common library when it is first reported, but the issues are always reported against the product, not the libaries.  What we need is a way to easily report the same issue against multiple projects and to track them separate if need be, but also to apply changes to this issue across all the projects it is reported against.  \n\nBasically, I'd like to see a feature that allows me to clone an issue to multiple projects and versions in one step.  This would be available at the Create, Edit , or Resolve issue stage.  Once an issue was cloned then anytime a change was made, other than to the Version or Component, it  could be applied to zero or more of the linked (of type clone) issues.   This would give us the ability track issues separately if need be or to report them against multiple products and resolve them in multiple projects (for tracking purposes) easily without having to clone/move-clone/move-clone/move for each project.\n\nPerhaps a UI where I could check a box saying to 'Apply to multiple projects' and then Add Project/Versions to a list.  If it was a new issue it would automatically create the clones and move them to the specified projects and if it was an existing issue you could select which project to apply changes to and/or add/delete projects from the list.\n\nWe've tried to use the Cloning feature currently available to address this issue, but we're finding it is just to cumbersome to create, clone/move, clone/move, clone/move, etc to be practical.  Also, if you apply a change to one issue such as a comment, this is not propogated to the other cloned issues.  You can still get to it via the links, but it is easy for people to miss relevant information if they don't review the linked issues.  ",

In my case I import issues from our previous system with jelly scripts and I have a pb since they are no jelly tags for Votes. A new tag will enable me to add the votes relative to the issue when I create it. Of course the tag should include the name of the voter. I hope this new feature is not too tricky to be implemented ... Thank you very much in advance for your help !\n\nRegards,\n\nC\u00e9cile Gorin\n\nPS: Perhaps could you give me a workaround ? I know the way to insert votes directly into the database but I would prefer to avoid doing that...Thanks !",

People will often make a lot of sequential changes to a bug, and depending on whether or not the workflow screens directly support doing all those changes at once, subscribers to change notifications may get blasted with emails that are all related to the same bug.\n\nExample: someone writes up a bug, goes back and edits a custom field that wasn't on the bug creation screen, attaches a screen shot, then assigns it to someone.

Almost every tracking system has problems with this level of detail, because you often want the single issue to remain a single issue (ie no cloning) but somehow to be fixed for different versions / branches at different times.\n\nMy suggestion to solve this effectively and simply is as follows:\n- a custom field which can be applied to different projects where you want this ability\n- an advanced searcher for the above field\n\nThe custom field would display checkboxes for each version in the fix versions field (ie derived data), with each checkbox indicating whether or not the issue had been fixed in that version. \n\nThe searcher would then allow you to query 3 things:\n- find issues which HAVE been fixed in versions x, y, z (ie have the checkbox checked and a fix version set for those versions)\n- find issues which HAVEN'T been fixed in versions x, y, z but are scheduled (ie checkbox is not checked but fix version is set)\n- find issues with ALL/ANY/NO unfixed versions (ie issues with all/any/no unchecked checkboxes)\n\nThings to think about: how the custom field gets the values from the fix version field - most likely some sort of funky Javascript.",

This configuration would occur in the Administration UI.\n\nAnother possible point to consider is logging across a cluster. If it ever appears the auditer might be leveraged to let admin.s administer federated logging.\n\n*NOTE* - the clustering comment applies to current thinking for Confluence, not JIRA.\n\nFurthermore, it would be nice if the auditer could work across both Confluence and JIRA - both product customers probably have a need for this level of logging. I'm creating this issue under Confluence for the timebeing but it is a relevant consideration for JIRA also.\n\n ",

If this note was shown within the issue navigator (e.g. as a tooltip - and just for the user who created it) it could be re-identified quickly on the first glimpse, and thus save the time of opening issues again, when one has forgotten what the matter was with a specific issue.",

I know this sounds crazy at first but it's actually not. :)\n\nFor example, if Jira is used for Helpdesk-type operations where issues being fixed often affect more than user and the problem is reported multiple times, it would be useful if duplicates would be closed off and the people who reported the duplicates were added as additional reporters of the original issue (with fix history). UI vise this could be implemented by adding a new issue ID field to \"Close Issue\" workflow transition, so that if an issue was closed as duplicate and the ID was given, the issues could be linked automatically and the reporter of the duplicate added as an additional reporter of the original issue.\n\nObviously this would then grant add the reporters the privileges which are granted to reporters.",

The upcoming release of JIRA 6.2 (planned for the first quarter of calendar year 2014) will introduce the \"limited user picker\" functionality for single user pickers based on custom fields. The limiting will be configurable based on rules, each rule defining a project role or group from which the users will be displayed. In case of multiple rules, the final list will be the union of lists as defined by individual rules. Rules will be defined within the context of the custom field configuration: therefore they will be separate for each combination of project and issue type.\nAs mentioned above, the rules definition will be ap\nplicable to all user picker custom fields, and as a consequence will currently *not* cover the scenarios for:\n* the user picker for system fields of reporter and assignee (JRA-36896)\n* the multiple user picker (JRA-36833)\n\nThanks for your patience and we hope you appreciate our open approach to feature requests.\n\nCheers,\nBartek\nJIRA Product Management\nbartek (at) atlassian (dot) com\n{panel}\n*Original request description*\n\nAs JIRA user and administrator I want to be able to use a user picker field in such a way that only users from selected groups or roles ale allowed for selection. This way I will be able to limit the choice (which is important in large scale deployments), but also assure that only users who are expected to provide actionable follow up are selected (for instance in case of bugs, these should be only developers and QA, and not sales engineers).",

While this feature is something we want to add to JIRA, it is not on the list of priorities for the next 12 months.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, please check out these plugins:\r\n * [Configuration Manager from Botron Software|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.botronsoft.jira.configurationmanager]\r\n * [Project Configurator from Awnaba Software|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.awnaba.projectconfigurator.projectconfigurator]\r\n\r\non our Atlassian marketplace. Both of these plugins are available for the downloaded instances of JIRA and solve the use cases outlined in this requirement.\r\n\r\nThere's also another solution emerging from an Atlassian Exper Catworkx.de. You can check out the [factsheet here|https://www.catworkx.de/produkte/catWorkX%20Produkte/configuration-importer/Configuration_Importer_for_JIRA_fact_sheet.pdf]\r\n\r\nThanks for your patience and we hope you appreciate our open and honest approach to feature requests.\r\n\r\nChur,\r\n Otto Ruettinger\r\n JIRA Principal Product Manager\r\n oruettinger (at) atlassian (dot) com\r\n{panel}\r\n*Original request description*\r\n\r\nNeeded features:\r\n - Import / export a project's structure (incl. workflow, related issue types, related groups, permissions, screens, fields, field configurations, etc.), but not its issues or history. This is useful to copy from the test installation of jira into the productive one.\r\n - Delete all issues and history of a project, but not its structure. Delete all closed issues of a project and their history, but not it's structure. This is useful for test purposes and for cleaning purposes in case of changes that make the old issues not required to read but useful to archive (e.g. for legal needs).\r\n - Import / export / delete a complete project, structure and issues. This is useful for backup flexibility and data cleanup (each dept. of the concern keeps its own data; When Maintenance have made a mistake and need to restore their backed-up data, we don't want to restore Development's data as well).\r\n\r\nAs a workaround for the lack of these features, we happen to use several installations for test purposes. But our managers definitely won't allocate any money for the corresponding licences, since juggling with several instances of a program is neither efficient nor convenient.\r\n\r\nMoreover, for now we end up with either databases full of unneeded, outdated test data, or with hours of click-click-click-copying a project's structure from the test system into the productive environment.

We can do this in several ways:\n- alllow to cofnigure field defualts per screen\n- introduce a new plugin type that is called before each screen initialisation\n- allow to supply javascript that runs on screen load\n\nFor a sample use case see JRA-7456",

Version x ships and is eventually archived.\n  3. A month later, bug is reopened on a new version - it's a regression.\n  4. Test lead wants to update the version in the issue to point at the new version - it doesn't work!\n\nHere's what happens: editing \"Affects Version\" simply adds the new version, but there is no ability to remove the old version. The only workaround is to temporarily unarchive that version so it shows up in the listbox, then edit again, deselect and save, then archive the version again.\n\nI'm not sure what a good solution is. It's nice not having those archived versions showing up in the listbox. And if we pick a new version some people may want the archived version removed (as I do), whereas others may think it should be added.",

We highly value your feedback in all forms, and through suggestions in jira.atlassian.com is not different. We use this channel often to learn the best we can with how customers use JIRA and how we can continue to improve the experience for as many users as possible.\n\nWe have revisited this issue again recently and wanted to reiterate that there are still currently no plans to implement this suggestion, and it is not currently on any JIRA team\u2019s roadmap at this stage.\n\nPlease remember that jira.atlassian.com is one of many inputs for the JIRA roadmap. You can [learn more about our process here|https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/110373/how-does-the-jira-team-use-jira-atlassian-com].\n\nI understand that our decision may be disappointing. Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.\n\n\nRegards,\nKerrod Williams\nKerrod (dot) Williams (at) atlassian (dot) com\nProduct Manager, JIRA\n\n{panel}\nIt would be useful if the backup service had an option to delete backups older than X days.

It is vital that I am able to print out just the right detail of information for product planning purposes. Here are my problems:\n\n1. I am unable to create multiple saved column customizations. For instance, when printing I often want more detail displayed than when I'm simply reviewing the bugs online. Also, some meetings require certain columns, such as reporter, while others don't. I want to be able to easily switch between configurations of displayed columns.\n\n2. It's often difficult to display enough information about a issue on a single row of output. This is especially true when printing. My ideal preference is to be able to display two or three rows of data per issue. This is detailed enough to be useful, but small enough to have the issue list be useful as a summary (printing a full page per issue is way too much paper to get a high level overview).\n\n3. An alternative to #2 would be landscape mode printing, instead of portrait mode. Even if I set my browser to use landscape mode, the page has already been unescessarily limited when viewing the \"Printable\" format. This alternative, while perhaps easier for you guys to implement, would not be as useful to me as #2.\n\n3. Formatting for \"Printable\" should be better. First, there is already too much wasted space. The header consists of about 20% of the first page, and is almost entirely useless. A simple concise summary of the filter used should be provided, and would only take of 1% of the page. Additionally, PDF output should be supported. I love PDF output in Confluence, why doesn't JIRA have it?",

      "description": "JIRA allows you to enter comments in several situations that aren't just commenting on an issue:\n\n- when editing the issue\n- when linking one issue to another\n- in a workflow transition screen, like when resolving an issue.\n\nThese three cases are different to a normal comment on the issue that adds more information, but these comments are shown in the normal stream. The UI around comments should be improved so that edit comments are shown near the information about the edit, for example. \n\nGiven the current tabbed UI, that would mean edit comments, workflow comments and link comments appear in the Change History tab next to the change, not on the Comments tab.\n\nAs an example, consider the situation when you're linking several bugs to one bug. Perhaps they're all related. I just did this myself with about six bugs that are all related to a similar component in the system. I link each bug with the same comment:\n\n\"i believe this is a similar issue to LH-1901. not our problem, but needs confirmation from sean and by trying on a previous build.\"\n\nThis works fine for the linked bugs, but if I go to the \"master\" bug that everything is linked to, I see a long list of comments, each identical, that make no sense whatsoever because there's no *context*. Sure I can go to the All tab and puzzle out what all the field changes mean and see how all the comments are interleaved...\n\nIt would be soooo much more useful if all the context was on the same page. Example. Instead of:\n\n     Comment by Scott Bilas [07/13/05 09:48 PM]  [ Permlink ]\n     i believe this is a similar issue to LH-1901. not our problem, but needs confirmation from sean and by trying on a previous build.\n\n     Comment by Scott Bilas [07/13/05 09:49 PM]  [ Permlink ]\n     i believe this is a similar issue to LH-1901. not our problem, but needs confirmation from sean and by trying on a previous build.\n\n     ....\n\nwe would have this:\n\n     Linked to LH-1774 as Related by Scott Bilas [07/13/05 09:48 PM]  [ Permlink ]\n     i believe this is a similar issue to LH-1901. not our problem, but needs confirmation from sean and by trying on a previous build.\n\n     Linked to LH-1971 as Related by Scott Bilas [07/13/05 09:49 PM]  [ Permlink ]\n     i believe this is a similar issue to LH-1901. not our problem, but needs confirmation from sean and by trying on a previous build.\n",

Your input in the comments helps us understand how this affects you and what you're hoping to accomplish with JIRA.\r\n\r\nAt this time, this suggestion is not on the JIRA development roadmap. We suggest the workaround described below.\r\n\r\n Please remember that jira.atlassian.com is one of many inputs for the JIRA roadmap. You can [learn more about our process here|https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/110373/how-does-the-jira-team-use-jira-atlassian-com].\r\n\r\nI understand that our decision may be disappointing. Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nDave Meyer\r\n[dmeyer@atlassian.com|mailto:dmeyer@atlassian.com]\r\nProduct Manager, JIRA Platform\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\nA user asks:\r\n\r\n> Is there a quick way of bulk changing the resolution of issues in a\r\n> project? I basically forgot to include the \"Resolve issue\" screen from\r\n> our project's \"Resolved\" transition in the workflow, and there are\r\n> thus no resolutions for the recently resolved issues...\r\n\r\nAssuming that the user has the 'Resolve' and 'Edit' permissions, I can't see why the resolution shouldn't be editable.\r\n\r\n{panel:title=Workaround}Please try the workaround listed here: [HowTo: Bulk Edit Resolution|https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirakb/bulk-edit-resolutions-in-jira-server-321857142.html]{panel}",
