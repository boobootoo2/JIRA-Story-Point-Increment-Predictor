It would be nice to retain or derive a link somehow so that useful features could be provided from within the repository window for remotes, such as:\r\n\r\n* Open project on [insert host]\r\n* View commit on [insert host]\r\n\r\nWe don't want to simply derive this by taking the details from the hosted projects window and copying them on clone, because the user might change the remote details later, or may have set up the repository from outside hosted projects (e.g. command line clone imported to SourceTree). Also you can have multiple remotes, so each of the above should probably be scoped with the remote name in the case that there are multiple remotes.\r\n\r\nWe can derive this linkage from a remote URL quite easily in the case of Bitbucket and GitHub, since the URLs are recognisable. In the case of hosts where the URL can be customised by the user, such as Stash and Kiln, this is more difficult; we would need some indicator against the remote which told us what type of hosting service it is. The difficult thing there is to keep this in sync with separate remote changes.\r\n\r\nSo initially, just supporting Bitbucket and GitHub would be best (and perhaps Kiln hosted at a kilnhg.com subdomain). \r\n",

I was going to use such an approach to link the SHA to an external service like Bitbucket or GitHub.\r\n\r\nAn alternative would be to bind the repo to the external service and/or realize this per remotes and all the Commit: sha in the log message to act as the link.  \r\n",

      "description": "If multiple commits are created with the same timestamp, either via 'git-svn dcommit' when there is more than one commit outstanding, or when using 'git rebase -i' to rewrite multiple changesets, if one of those commits is given a tag (or possibly a branch), git log is prone to reporting them out of order. Because the SourceTree log relies on a child commit being reported before its parent, this can cause incorrect graph rendering. \r\n\r\nA workaround for this is simply to select 'Ancestor Order' in the log options. This option is slower than the date order though, which is why it is not the default.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to be able to detect this case and auto-enable the Ancestor Order option, although this will require the log to be completely refreshed. You can't actually tell that it's happened until you see a case where a parent commit has already been encountered by the time the child commit referring to it appears. Therefore we'd need to keep a running record of all the SHAs encountered so far. All these things have a performance impact which will need to be assessed, given that this doesn't happen very often and that the user can easily work around it with the Ancestor Order option already.\r\n\r\nThe other option might be to find a set of git log options which doesn't use --topo-order all the time but also doesn't report the commits out of order in this case. This will need to be carefully examined since the current commands issued already cope with a number of edge cases. ",

      "description": "There is some confusion around the default behaviour of pushing a branch in git, compared to the pull tracking behaviour.\r\n\r\nTracking a remote branch in Git actually just means where you pull from. When pushing that branch with no specifics, it is assumed to be pushed to a branch of the same name on the remote, unless you configure 'remote.origin.push' to be something else (this is common for people who push via code review systems or deployment systems). \r\n\r\nSome people, especially those new to git might expect that if they chose to track a different branch, push would go back to that branch too (it doesn't). We can't change this default globally because it would be unexpected to git veterans. However, there should be some way we can make this more obvious or controllable. Options might include:\r\n\r\n# When tracking a branch, if it's not the same name ask if the push option should be set too. However since push can be different per remote rather than just a single entry like pull tracking, this might be oversimplified.\r\n# Have an extra section in the remote configuration where you specify the push behaviour. \r\n\r\nGit themselves may be changing the default behaviour: http://lwn.net/Articles/487131/ It is worth seeing what the outcome of this is before implementing any changes in SourceTree.",

I tried to rebase my branch onto the new SVN tip, which seemed to cause a merge conflict for every commit when there was no actual conflict.\r\n\r\nI tried to select all remaining commits that had not been pushed to SVN, then right clicked and selected \"cherry pick\". The dialogue seemed to be talking about check picking a single commit, even though I had selected several. After I confirmed I wanted to go ahead, there were a tonne of merge conflicts.\r\n\r\nFinally I tried cherry picking each individual commit in sequence, and that worked. Then I was able to push to the SVN remote without any further errors.\r\n\r\nNot sure why SourceTree (or Git) couldn't just rebase after the other developers commit and keep pushing, especially when his commit didn't even touch any of the files in any of my commits? The error says there were unstaged changes, but there were none when I started my push (SourceTree wouldn't let me push to SVN if I had unstaged changes).\r\n\r\nOr why I couldn't \"continue\" the rebase, or start a new rebase operation without generating merge conflicts?\r\n\r\nOr why I couldn't select a range of commits to cherry pick without generating merge conflicts, even though I could cherry pick each one manually?\r\n\r\nIs this just the way Git is? When I start a push, it does a mixed reset to the SVN tip, stages changes for each commit in sequence? So when the remote had a different commit, it couldn't rebase? Couldn't Git (or SourceTree) just hard reset my working copy back to my branch automatically and start the rebase again?\r\n\r\nWhat is the recommended way to recover from this situation?\r\n\r\nCheers.\r\n",

However, I can only either few the history of the currently checked out branch or of all local branches (or of all branches). Just seing all the local branches in an overkill already, since I usually have multiple actively maintained branches (3 for Sinatra, 5 for Rack at the moment).\r\n\r\nSo it would be handy to be able to filter what branches should be displayed independently from the currently checked out branch.\r\n\r\nIt would also be handy to somehow make it easier to see a difference between merge commits and normal commits, esp. when scanning long, complex commit histories (say, either not list merge commits or use grey text instead of black or something similar).\r\n\r\nI know this would probably be only useful to power users like me, but this is one of the few places where I really see an advantage of a UI like SourceTree over using the command line client.",
