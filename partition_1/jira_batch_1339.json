Because of this, you may have used your G\u00a0Suite email address to create a\u00a0_conflicting account_. A conflicting account is a personal Google Account that was created using the email address of a G\u00a0Suite account. For this reason, any G\u00a0Suite user could have two accounts with the same email address.\r\n\r\n*Here's a common scenario*\r\n # Jane decides to go to www.google.com/photos and creates a Google Account with her corporate email address 'Jane@altostrat.com.'\r\n # Jane's company, Altostrat, upgrades to G\u00a0Suite \u2013 which means each employee's email address is now that employee's username for a corporate Google Account.\r\n # Jane now has two Google Accounts \u2013 one G\u00a0Suite account, and one Google Account, that share the same primary email address, but are completely unrelated.The most common reason that you may have a conflicting account is that you used Google Reader, Google Voice, or Picasa Web Albums with your\u00a0*@my-domain.com*\u00a0email.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Having a Google Account created with the corporate email address prior to having G Suite on the company, login to Atlassian using social login.\r\n # (System) A link is now created using the Google ID of this account into the Atlassian account.\r\n # Company now has a SAML integration, the end user logs in by company SSO, creating the SAML ID link with the Atlassian account.\r\n # Company now has G Suite in place. (Not integrated with Atlassian)\r\n # (System) Google now changes the pre-G Suite Google Account email to @gtempaccount.com\r\n # End user uses social login again with Atlassian with an existing session for the pre-G Suite Google Account.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nWith SAML SSO in place, the Google ID should have been cleared from the account, so no profile changes are propagated from Google anymore through social link.\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nThe Atlassian account gets updated from Google to [name%domain@gtempaccount.com|mailto:name%domain@gtempaccount.com]\r\nh3. Notes\r\n\r\nThe issue can reoccur if the end user uses social login again.\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nIf the new gtempaccount.com email address is still accessible, perform an email change back to the original one, if another Atlassian account is already using it, access the new duplicated account and change its email to an alias such as name+alias@domain.com, then perform the change on the original account.\r\n * [https://confluence.atlassian.com/cloudkb/changing-atlassian-account-email-addresses-969508513.html]\r\n\r\nIf you are not able to perform the steps above, please engage our Atlassian support by raising a ticket on our support.atlassian.com portal.",

Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Impersonate a user\r\n # A pop-up will appear to switch back to your user.

Workaround\r\n\r\nA manual workaround is to have the admin to navigate to\u00a0{{<siteurl>/impersonate}}, which will reset the impersonate function. e.g. [acme.atlassian.net/impersonate|http://acme.atlassian.net/impersonate]",

Once we schedule the session, you will receive a calendar invite to a Zoom conference.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019ll start with a general discussion to get to know you.

Lastly, we will share a prototype with you to get your feedback.\r\n\r\nIf you\u2019re interested in taking part, please email me at\u00a0[jwu3@atlassian.com|mailto:jwu3@atlassian.com], and I will contact you to schedule a time to meet.\r\n\r\nWe look forward to hearing from you.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n Jesse Wu\r\n Designer for Atlassian Administration, Access and Security\r\n{panel}\r\n*Problem*\r\n It's not possible to force users to log out in the *Session duration* tab on the admin page. The workaround is the *Reset password* feature in the *Org* > *Security* > *Password management* tab. That button has two different outcomes beyond ending the managed accounts' session depending on having SAML SSO or not:\r\nh3. Scenario 1: SAML SSO is enabled\r\n - The users will have their Atlassian Account session terminated and when they try to log in, they will be redirected to the Identity Provider authentication page. The users *won't* be asked to create a new password, *nor* receive any notification.\r\n\r\nh3. Scenario 2: SAML SSO is *not* enabled\r\n - The users will have their Atlassian Account session terminated and when they try to log in, after entering their current credentials, they will be prompt to create a new password. This new password must respect the Organization's [password policies].\r\n\r\n*Suggestion*\r\n Notify your users about when the logout will happen so they can avoid losing their current work. If you do changes to the session duration it might be worth it to let them know as well.",
