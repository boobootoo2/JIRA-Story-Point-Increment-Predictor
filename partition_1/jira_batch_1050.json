Summary\r\n\r\nA project may be created without any Standard Issue Types, causing all sorts of severe symptoms:\r\n# Creating tickets in the project fail \r\n# When we see the 'create screen' when trying to create an issue, it shows several Issue Types repeatedly under ID numbers (very strange behavior)\r\n# Also, if we click the 'Create' button on the top, it fails to open a pop-up window (we can only open in another tab), so we can't even choose the project in this case\r\n\r\nWhenever we create a project, JIRA uses a specific set of Issue Types and creates a new Issue Type scheme by default with those (provided we don't create project with shared configuration). To select the Issue Types to add to the new Issue Type Scheme, it actually uses their names, depending on the system language.\r\n\r\nFor example, in English, any Business project will be created with the issue types that in the system have the names 'Task' and 'Sub-Task', even if those are not the original ones. \r\n\r\nIn that example, if we delete the 'Task' Issue Type and create a new Issue Type in category 'Sub-task', but with name 'Task', it will be used for any new Business project. Since the 'Sub-Task' Issue Type is also a 'Sub-Task type', the projects will be created with 2 Sub-Task types and no Standard Type, causing all the symptoms mentioned above.\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Create a Business project, to make sure you have Issue Types with names Task and a Sub-Task (or equivalent names, depending on system language)\r\n# Delete the 'Task' Issue type\r\n# Create a new Issue Type, with name 'Task' again, but using the Sub-Task category\r\n# Create a new Business Project\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nSome Standard Issue Type is added to the second project and it works.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nSecond project created doesn't have a Standard Issue Type and it doesn't work.\r\n\r\n\r\nh3.Workaround\r\nh4. Fixing existing project\r\nAdd a Standard Issue Type to the 'broken' projects\r\n\r\nh4. Prevent future problems\r\nRename the 'Task' issue type to something else.

Issue Summary\r\nSome [Jira Expressions|https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions/], when used on the 'Create' transition in, say, validators or conditions in a workflow are unable to find fields when they are not set.\r\n\r\nThis is strangely not happening when tickets are created, only when cloned.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\nThis  happens when using Jira expressions on Create transition.\r\nFor example, if a validator is created with an expression that looks like this:\r\n{quote}\r\n(issue.customfield_10000 && issue.customfield_10000.length > 0)||(issue.customfield_10001 && issue.customfield_10001.length > 0))\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nThat expression is used to verify if at least one of the customer fields with ID 10000 and 10001 is set. This works as expected when running this on creation. However, when cloning an existing issue, which also triggers this validator, it fails if first custom field is not set.\r\n\r\nIt tries to get issue.customfield_10000 and fails with an NPE. Strangely enough, this does not seem to happen with second custom field. Because of that, the rest of the expression is never processed.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nThe Jira expression has the same behavior in creation and when cloning, passing if either of the fields are set.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n- It works as expected on creation, but fails when cloning.\r\n- This actually triggers 2 errors in logs, one is an NPE:\r\n ** Message1: Error when transforming object to bean\r\n ** Message2: Issue clone failed. Could not create issue\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\nCurrently, there is no known workaround for this behavior. A workaround will be added here when available",
