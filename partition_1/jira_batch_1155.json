Summary\n\nUpdating of FieldLayouts is expensive because whenever any change to FieldLayout happens there has to be a synchronized opperation done that removes all FieldLayoutItems for that FieldLayout and creates them all again (This is an order of magnitude of a number of custom fields so for large instances with thousands of custom fields editing FieldLayouts can become a major problem). Even if we change description of only a single FieldLayoutItem all items need to be recreated..\n\nh3. Environment\n* Large number of custom fields: 1500+\n* Large number fieldlayout (Field Configuration): \n{code:borderStyle=solid}\nSQL> select count(1) from fieldlayout; \n576 \n\nSQL> select count(1) from fieldlayoutitem; \n1355666\n{code}\n\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\nUsing a very large instance, edit a field configuration.\n\nh3. Expected Results\nJIRA does not remove all FieldLayoutItems for that FieldLayout and creates them all again.\n\nh3. Actual Results\nJIRA executes a very high amount of SQL, as it removes all FieldLayoutItems for that FieldLayout and creates them all again. SQL similar to:\n{code:borderStyle=solid}\nINSERT INTO public.fieldlayoutitem (ID, FIELDLAYOUT, FIELDIDENTIFIER, DESCRIPTION, VERTICALPOSITION, ISHIDDEN, ISREQUIRED, RENDERERTYPE) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?)\n{code}",

Workaround \n\nOne sample workaround would be to script this, for example:\n\n# Create another database and copy the data from the existing one.\n# Download the standalone installer.\n# Install it with the pre-answered responses.\n# Stop the instance.\n# Edit the {{server.xml}} as appropriate.\n# Update {{dbconfig.xml}} with the new database.\n# Populate {{$JIRA_HOME/plugins/installed-plugins}} with the required plugins.\n# Start up the instance, which will then upgrade the data (or simply start with it), and enable the plugins.",

Steps to Reproduce\n* Create a new issue ticket where the field is visible\n* Add a value to the field via REST API:\n{code}\ncurl -D- -u admin:admin -X PUT --data '{\"fields\":{\"customfield_10200\":\"something for something\"}}' -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" http://localhost:8080/rest/api/2/issue/SSP-24\n{code}\n** in my case, the field id is 10200 and the ticket that I'm modifying is SSP-24\n* Verify that the new value exists by accessing the ticket via web browser\n* Now attempt to clear the field. For example these work for other text fields (single line and multi-line):\n{code}\ncurl -D- -u admin:admin -X PUT --data '{\"fields\":{\"customfield_10200\":null}}' -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" http://localhost:8080/rest/api/2/issue/SSP-24\n\ncurl -D- -u admin:admin -X PUT --data '{\"fields\":{\"customfield_10200\":\"\"}}' -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" http://localhost:8080/rest/api/2/issue/SSP-24\n{code}\n* Reload the issue ticket and the ticket still has a value in it\n\n\nh4. Workaround: updating the field to only contain a space:\n{code}\ncurl -D- -u admin:admin -X PUT --data '{\"fields\":{\"customfield_10200\":\" \"}}' -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" http://localhost:8080/rest/api/2/issue/SSP-24\n{code}\n* Looks like you need to have some sort of data, so it requires that extra (space) within the \" \"\n* The downside to this workaround is if there are JQL attempting to filter for this field as EMPTY",

Summary\n\nThe\u00a0\"Recently Created Chart\" Gadget on a JIRA Dashboard shows Issues that were created in the current month shifted back into the previous month if the User's Profile has a Timezone Offset later than the Server's Default Timezone.\n\nThis causes confusion\u00a0for users in other regions where their Time Zones differe from the Server who are using these Gadgets\nh3. Environment\n * JIRA\u00a01000.217.1\n\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\n # Edit dashboard and include a \"Recently Created Chart\" gadget\n ** Set a Project/Filter and a Period of 'Monthly'\n # Create Issues in the Same Project used by the gadget\n # Change your Profile\u00a0Time Zone so that it is at least -1 hour to the Server's Default; ie if Chicago, set Time Zone to Denver; if Default is New York, set to Chicago/Mexico City, \u00a0etc.\n # Refresh the Dashboard\n\nh3. Expected Results\n\nGadget shows issues created in Current Month in the Column for the Current Month\n\n!1.ServerDefaultOffset-ChicagoGMT-6.png|thumbnail!\nh3. Actual Results\n\nTesting in the current month of August and setting Time Zone to Denver (rather than my Server's Default of Chicago(GMT-6)) ,\u00a0issues created today are shown in the Gadget to be created in July:\n\n!2.Manual-Denver_GMT-7.png|thumbnail!\nh3. Notes\n\nIn a Customer's instance, this is also affecting the 'Daily' period where issues created Today appear on Yesterday's Date\u00a0\n\nFound that if a GMT Offset was used that is the same as the Server's Offset; Chicago\u00a0is GMT-6, if manually selecting GMT-6, the Gadget does not display correctly:\n !5.Manual-GMT-6.png|thumbnail!\n\nHowever a Manual Offset of GMT-5 or going to +1 hour (or more) to the Server's Default Time Zone, the Gadget displays correctly:\n Manually set Time Zone to GMT-5\n !6.Manual-GMT-5.png|thumbnail!\n\nManually set Time Zone to New York:\n !3.Manual-NY_GMT-5.png|thumbnail!\n\n\u00a0\nh3.

[See the corresponding bug report|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-62122].\n  {panel}\n\nh3. Summary\n\nDue to the removal of certain plugins within JIRA Cloud, such as the JIRA Misc Workflow Extensions, certain parts of the code have been moved into JIRA Cloud. This is detailed further in [JIRA Miscellaneous Workflow Extensions (JMWE) removal from JIRA Cloud|https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirakb/jira-miscellaneous-workflow-extensions-jmwe-removal-from-jira-cloud-815262011.html]. However, some of the code changes have not made it into JIRA Server, so when migrating from Cloud to Server the workflows will be broken as they reference classes that do not exist.\n\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\n # Setup a workflow with JMWE 'Fields Required' validator or the 'set issue security from role'\u00a0post-function.\n # Export the instance to Server.\n # Install JMWE plugin.\n # Try to use the workflow.\n\nh3. Expected Results\n\nThe workflow proceeds as normal.\nh3. Actual Results\n\nThe workflow fails to transition with the below error:\n{noformat}\n[c.a.jira.workflow.DefaultOSWorkflowConfigurator] Could not load class 'com.atlassian.jira.workflow.validator.FieldRequiredValidator'\n{noformat}\nOr\n{noformat}\n2016-10-23 15:54:58,073 ProjectImport: CreateIssues:thread-3 ERROR sysadmin 954x14300x1 v23cek 10.0.0.2 /secure/admin/ProjectImportSummary.jspa [c.a.jira.workflow.DefaultOSWorkflowConfigurator] Could not load class 'com.atlassian.jira.workflow.function.issue.SetIssueSecurityFromRoleFunction'\n{noformat}\n\nh3. Workaround\n\nThis can be worked around by renaming the new class names back to the old class names. For example renaming {{com.atlassian.jira.workflow.validator.FieldRequiredValidator}} to {{com.innovalog.jmwe.plugins.validators.FieldRequiredValidator}} in the workflows will fix the problem.\n\nh3. Notes\n\nReviewing the XML backups before and after the change shows the problem is obvious - the class name has changed:\n{code:java|title=After}\n\t\t\t<validator name=\"\" type=\"class\">\n              <arg name=\"contextHandling\"></arg>\n              <arg name=\"hidFieldsList\">customfield_13600</arg>\n              <arg name=\"errorMessage\"></arg>\n              <arg name=\"class.name\">com.atlassian.jira.workflow.validator.FieldRequiredValidator</arg>\n            </validator>\n            <validator name=\"\" type=\"class\">\n              <arg name=\"contextHandling\"></arg>\n              <arg name=\"hidFieldsList\">customfield_12719</arg>\n              <arg name=\"errorMessage\">.</arg>\n              <arg name=\"class.name\">com.atlassian.jira.workflow.validator.FieldRequiredValidator</arg>\n            </validator>\n{code}\n{code:java|title=Before}\n\t\t\t<validator name=\"\" type=\"class\">\n\t\t\t\n              <arg name=\"fieldKey\">customfield_13600</arg>\n              <arg name=\"errorMessage\"></arg>\n              <arg name=\"class.name\">com.innovalog.jmwe.plugins.validators.FieldRequiredValidator</arg>\n            </validator>\n            <validator name=\"\" type=\"class\">\n\t\t\t\n              <arg name=\"fieldKey\">customfield_12719</arg>\n              <arg name=\"errorMessage\"></arg>\n              <arg name=\"class.name\">com.innovalog.jmwe.plugins.validators.FieldRequiredValidator</arg>\n            </validator>\n{code}\nThe below contains a summary of changes:\n\n||From||To||\n|{{com.atlassian.jira.workflow.validator.FieldRequiredValidator}}|{{com.innovalog.jmwe.plugins.validators.FieldRequiredValidator}}|\n|{{com.atlassian.jira.workflow.function.issue.SetIssueSecurityFromRoleFunction}}|{{com.innovalog.jmwe.plugins.functions.SetIssueSecurityFromRoleFunction}}|",

As the search result will provide a vast, inaccurate result.\n\nh3. Suggested Solution\n* Currently, in our upgrade notes, there is already a section for [known issue|https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirasoftware/jira-software-7-2-x-upgrade-notes-834230197.html#JIRASoftware7.2.xupgradenotes-Informationforadministrators].\n* I would suggest that we link Admins to this section instead rather than to the Knowlege Base\n* Improve the 'Known Issue' section as well to be up to date to ensure a list of known issue to be retrieved from JAC \n \nh3.

Your feedback is key to helping us understand how you use JIRA so we can continue improving your experience.\n\nThere are two main use cases that we have observed amongst our users that concern this functionality:\n 1. Exporting / importing issues\n 2. Data Reporting\n\nThe CSV Export that was introduced in the 7.2 release addresses the first use case.\n The second one used to be addressed by the Excel (HTML) export functionality however, as you know, we decided to remove it and observed it had negative impact on our users who took advantage of the Excel (HTML) form, where CSV Export did not solve their needs (please refer to https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRA-61891 for background).\n\nTo address this challenge we're considering bringing back the Excel (HTML) functionality as HTML Export (so with .html extension and not the .xls). We see the following benefits of such solution:\n * Mitigating the dependecy on Microsoft's requirements related to downloading and opening an HTML file with .xls extension\n * Ability to use the rich HTML table for immediate reporting purposes (the only difference is that if you wanted to open it in Excel you would need to change the downloaded file extension to .xls or right click on the downloaded file and select Open with > Excel or open the file from MS Excel)\n * Ability to use the well-know table format including hyperlinks and attachments\n\nNote: By default the file would be opened in a web browser after it's downloaded.\n\nOn top of it we will keep addressing the outstanding shortcomings of CSV Export.\n\nWe would like to find out if that approach would solve majority of your concerns related to removal of the old Excel (HTML) export option.\n\nThanks again for your help and feedback!\n Jakub Lazinski\n Product Manager, JIRA\n{panel}\n\u00a0\n\n*Original request description*\n\nSince exporting to *Excel (HTML)* will be disabled soon, we would like customers to share their feedbacks on the export to *Excel (CSV)*.\n\nExporting to *Excel (HTML)* will be removed because of:\n - --JRA-61891--",
