I think every time it crashes when I reopen it, it doesn't crash again, at least not that I remember, so it's just the first time I try to open it. Its there any info that I can send you that could be useful to you to track this problem down? Thanks!\r\n\r\n*manolo*",

I now would like to open another repository using the Repository Browser. To achieve that, I have to perform the following steps at the moment: (1)\u00a0click on the SourceTree icon, which shows\u00a0one of the minimized windows, (2) pressing \"Cmd + 0\", (3) minimizing the \"wrong\" window again, and finally (4) open the repository I was looking for using the Repository Browser. If the Dock Menu would contain an item \"Show Repository Browser\", I could easily achieve the same result without having to perform the steps (1) and (3).

If the user previously selected multiple commits, this multi-selection should probably be restored as well.\r\n\r\nJust like we already have \"Parents: ...\" links for each commit, it may also be helpful to have \"Children: ...\" links for each commit.

      "description": "Hello,\r\n\r\nI recently generated a new pair of keys to be used with my Yubikey for SSH logins. I successfully added the ssh public key to Bitbucket and it is correctly installed on my system (ie visible from ssh-add).\r\n\r\nWhen I use the git command line everything works fine: for every remote git command to Bitbucket (even from a terminal launched from Sourcetree), macOS asks me the pin to properly unlock my Yubikey (where the private key is securely stored) and the git command ends with success.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, when I try the very same remote command through Sourcetree GUI, it fails. From the log I see that Sourcetree\\git is trying to directly unlock the private key without asking for the pin (in fact, macOS's pin dialog is never shown).\r\n\r\nI suspect this error occurs with every external token card for SSH.\r\nCould you please investigate this issue and make sure that Sourcetree properly works with an external token card?\r\n\r\nThanks for your help.\r\n\r\nBest Regards,\r\n\r\nNicholas\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n[http://florin.myip.org/blog/easy-multifactor-authentication-ssh-using-yubikey-neo-tokens]\r\n[https://www.isi.edu/~calvin/yubikeyssh.htm]\r\n\r\n_Note: initially\u00a0reported to Atalssian Service Desk (code:\u00a0STSP-5478)._",

It's unacceptable and make SourceTree look cheap and buggy.",
