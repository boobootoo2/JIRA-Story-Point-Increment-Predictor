Steps to Reproduce\r\n # In time tracking menu (<sitname>/secure/admin/TimeTrackingAdmin.jspa) set the config for \"Time display format\" to \"Days\" and the \"Default unit for time tracking\" to minutes.\r\n # Pick an issue in the site and set the remaining time estimate on it to 29min or 0.06d\r\n # Ensure that the workflow for this ticket has a status transition with a screen which includes the time tracking field\r\n # Attempt to transition the relevant issue, setting a \"time logged\" to 1m\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nIt's expected that when logging time to an issue, you should be able to transition the ticket without any issues, even if the user is using time remaining format in Days.\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nJira returns a 500 error once you transition the issue.\r\nAs a result there are error logs in the Back-end saying: \"Error occurred while converting time estimates:Durations must be in whole minutes\"\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\n1. The workaround is to switch the site's formatting to \"Pretty\" in\u00a0<sitname>/secure/admin/TimeTrackingAdmin.jspa\r\n OR\u00a0\r\n 2. ensure the remaining time estimate when rendered as a fraction of a day always converts evenly to whole minutes (so 0.1d instead of 0.06)",

Why this is important\r\n\r\nMaking team-managed fields visible across the instance isn't a good user experience as:\r\n * Team Managed projects are simple and all its settings should be kept inside it\r\n * In case a field from a TM project has the same name as a global one, it'd be hard to identify which one the search is referring to.",

Team-managed projects cannot share resources with other projects, specially when it come to fields.\r\n\r\nYou can end up having a field in a Team-managed project with the same name of a global field (used by Company-managed projects). Currently, that seems to cause inconsitencies in the search results.\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nConsider the following scenario:\r\n\r\n* Create a field called *Select list*\r\n !Screen Shot 2021-10-07 at 10.54.55.png|thumbnail! \r\n* Create a field of the same type and name in a team-managed project\r\n !Screen Shot 2021-10-07 at 10.56.21.png|thumbnail! \r\n* Create an issue *RU-113* in a Company-managed project, and populate the field *Select list*\r\n* Move that issue to a Team-managed project, but do not populate any value for the field *Select list* that belongs to that project:\r\n !Screen Shot 2021-10-07 at 11.09.39.png|thumbnail! \r\n** The new key of that issue in my case is *N1-93*\r\n\r\n*Scenario 1* Now, let's check the search results:\r\n* Create an issue in that same Team-managed project, populating the field *Select list* present on it\r\n* The UI suggests only one field named after *Select list*\r\n* Search for both the issue you moved to the Team-managed project and the one you have created\r\n* Add the column *Select list* (only one is offered) in the search results\r\n\r\n*Scenario 2:*\r\n* Perform a REST API call with the search endpoint, expanding both fields in the results\r\n* In my case, the global field's ID is *10143*, and the Team-managed one is *10225*\r\n{code}\r\nhttps://unlimitedjiraworks.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/search?jql=key%20%3D%20N1-93&fields=customfield_10143,%20customfield_10225\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\n*Scenario 1:*\r\n* Only the issue you have created along with a value for the field in the project should display a value in the colum *Select list*\r\n\r\n*Scenario 2:*\r\n* Only the field with ID *10225* should be considered for the results since that's in the project's scope\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\n*Scenario 1*:\r\n* Both issues display a value for the field *Select list*. The problem is that in this case the issue that was moved to the project (N1-93) is pointing to the value it had in the global field *Select list* (that's because the value is still stored in the database)\r\n !Screen Shot 2021-10-07 at 11.39.50.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\n*Scenario 2:*\r\n* You are able to expand both fields, and a value from the global field will be returned in the issue from a team-managed project (again, because that value is in the database):\r\n{code}\r\n{\"expand\":\"names,schema\",\"startAt\":0,\"maxResults\":50,\"total\":1,\"issues\":[{\"expand\":\"operations,versionedRepresentations,editmeta,changelog,renderedFields\",\"id\":\"57361\",\"self\":\"https://unlimitedjiraworks.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/57361\",\"key\":\"N1-93\",\"fields\":{\"customfield_10225\":null,\"customfield_10143\":{\"self\":\"https://unlimitedjiraworks.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/customFieldOption/10346\",\"value\":\"A\",\"id\":\"10346\"}}}]}\r\n{code}\r\n* That's a problem if customers need to fill in information in reports and end up adding values that don't really belong to the issues anymore\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nIf you need to use REST API and are receiving misleading results from the calls, you will need to make it so you perform calls using the specific IDs of each field.\r\n\r\nAlso, something that might help identifying the correct fields is by using the [Get fields|https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/v3/api-group-issue-fields/#api-rest-api-3-field-get] endpoint.

And say we choose to move issues to next sprint, it will only move Issue B (which was visible on it) to next sprint. Issue A which was visible on board A will be moved back to backlog.\u00a0",

Expected Results\r\n\r\nRegardless of the setting being *ON* or *OFF* the precedence 'Bulk' is always set in the outgoing emails from JIRA.\r\nh3.

Workaround\r\n * As per recent updates, we have found that changing the \"Email Notification Format\" to *TEXT* from the Personal Settings page *URL:* secure/ViewPersonalSettings.jspa can avoid the discrepancy in the email header. However, if it's set to HTML the precedence set under General Setting is not obeyed by the Notification Platform.\r\n\r\nThere has been recent planning and development happening on this where the product team has decided to move to a different notification platform. This BUG would be fixed as part of our current development plan where we are going to migrate from the notification platform to Atlassian Mail.\r\n\r\nWe do not have a defined ETA for this, but we will update this ticket when we have more information on the same.",

Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Create a next-gen project with statuses \"To Do\", \"In Progress\" and \"Done\".\r\n # Create some issues, and transition some of them around.\r\n # Run the query: {{project = PROJECT_NAME AND (status CHANGED FROM \"To Do\" OR status = \"To Do\")}}\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n * All issues in that project should be returned.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n * Only some are returned.\r\n\r\nh3. Notes\r\n\r\nWe primarily see this happening in these scenarios:\r\n* The search doesn't work with team-managed projects\r\n* The search doesn't work well in company-managed projects when there has been a workflow change\r\n\r\nIn both scenarios, using the status_id instead of the status_name works. This also affects searches performed via the Jira APIs.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround(s)\r\n\r\nThere are different possibilities:\r\n # Currently, this bug is affecting the default statuses from the Next-Gen project. So, if you use custom statuses, the search is expected to work.\r\n # Renaming the columns to something different than the default value returns the issues from the search.\r\n # Another workaround from\u00a0[https://community.atlassian.com/t5/Jira-Software-questions/BUG-JQL-Unable-to-query-next-gen-project-s-issues-with-status/qaq-p/1319216#M67818]\r\n{quote}There is a workaround mentioned on this bug to search via Status ID rather than name - I've tried it and it seems to work - to do this:\r\n\r\nLocate your Next-Gen project's ID:\r\n # Go to https://<your instance name>.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/project\r\n # Locate your Project - use your browser search (Ctrl+F or Cmnd+F) to search via Key or Name\r\n # Copy your Project's ID\r\n\r\nNext locate your status' ID:\r\n # Go to https://<your instance name>.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/status\r\n # Search for your Project ID - next to it there will be the statuses with their status IDs. These are usually five digits in length and should start with 10, 100 or similar (depending how many custom statuses are on your instance).\r\n # Copy the relevant Status ID\r\n\r\nYou can now search using the ID - eg. \"Status was 101323\".\r\n{quote}",

      "description": "As of the time of this writing, Custom fields at the system level and Next Gen custom fields have an extreme level of collision with each-other. Search is unable to clearly understand which custom field is intended unless you use the extremely ambiguous cf_id format in JQL searching. This causes the JQL searches to be extremely ugly, or requires teams to coordinate on their use of custom fields.\r\n\r\nIn order to resolve these issues, I would like to propose the use of Namespaces for custom fields. The idea would be to allow users to refer to custom fields with the following syntax:\r\n\r\nprojectkey:customfieldname\r\n\r\nAn example would be like:\r\nABC:EstimatedCost\r\nor\r\n\"BAR:Story Points\"\r\nThis would allow you to specify from which project you want to get the custom field, and would allow macros and other systems to identify custom fields from Next Gen projects more clearly.\r\n\r\nFor the globally defined custom fields for Classic projects, you can denote them specifically with this syntax:\r\n:EstimatedCost\r\nor\r\n\":Story Points\"\r\n\r\nThis would allow you to specifically refer to the classic custom fields without potentially clashing with the namespace of any projects by key. This also opens the door to the third option of not using the namespace \":\" designator.\r\n\r\nBy using the syntax of today, you could potentially implement \"smart masking\" where only values that are NOT NULL/ NOT EMPTY are returned allowing for values to be combined into a single column on reports for when the name is the same.\r\n\r\nThis would make the returned information from searches and other systems (such as Confluence Jira Issue Macro) more intuitive and intelligent while also providing more specificity and not requiring a fundamental restructure of the database systems.",
