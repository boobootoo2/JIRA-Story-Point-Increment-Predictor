Workaround\r\n * It's a bit of a shitty work-around, but the only thing one can do is to re-fetch the issue JSON after the issue:created event in the hope that all links have been established. But depending on the number of links being created or timing issues, that might still not be all issue links.\r\n * In Automation for Jira you can insert a 're-fetch issue data' action immediately after the trigger to do the above.\u00a0 But as I mentioned it's not always a workaround.",

      "description": "{panel:title=Update from Atlassian - 1 July 2021|borderStyle=solid|borderColor=#2684ff|titleBGColor=#2684ff|bgColor=#ffffff}\r\nHi all, \r\n\r\nMy name is Venkatesh and I\u2019m a product manager on the Jira cloud team. Thank you for leaving feedback on this ticket. Given the level of interest in this ticket we\u2019ve researched and assessed supporting more than 120 attachments in the new issue view.\r\n\r\n*Decision*\r\n\r\nBased off our research, *we won\u2019t be supporting more than 120 attachments for now*\r\n\r\n*Reasoning*\r\n\r\nWe assessed different use-cases for having more than 120 attachments and decided to keep this limit because\r\n * Having more than 120 attachments contributes to slower performance, larger amount of bugs and decreases the usability of Jira. Our team\u2019s focus is primarily on making Jira easier and efficient to use, and supporting this feature detracts from this goal.\r\n\r\n * Upgrading our service to support more than 120 attachments poses a security risk for our customers. At Atlassian, security is one of our companies highest priorities for our customers and we wouldn\u2019t want to jeopardise our customers' security.\r\n\r\n*Next Steps*\r\n\r\nI am going to convert this to a feature request so that we can continue to gather feedback. I know this won\u2019t be the decision a number of you are looking for, and I\u2019m sorry for that. We believe this is the best decision for most users, with the information we have right now.\r\n\r\nIf you would like to connect to talk about why you require more than 120 attachments, please feel free to email me at [vvasudevan@atlassian.com|mailto:vvasudevan@atlassian.com] so we can discuss your use-case in more detail.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019re always looking to reassess and improve our experiences. If new information comes to light that suggests we should iterate this approach, we\u2019ll definitely reconsider. Please remember that [jira.atlassian.com|http://jira.atlassian.com/] is one of many inputs for the Jira roadmap. You can\u00a0[learn more about our process here|https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/110373/how-does-the-jira-team-use-jira-atlassian-com].\r\n\r\nThanks again for your feedback.\r\n\r\nVenkatesh, \r\nProduct Manager,\r\nJira Cloud\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*Old Update*\r\nThis issue was formerly tracked by: https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-72355\r\n\r\nAs part of tracking the previous ticket we rolled out an improvement that doubled the number of attachments an issue could hold prior to failing from 60 to 120. This ticket represents the continuation of this work and the seperate issue of handling more than 120 attachments on an issue.\r\n{panel}\r\nh3. Summary\r\n\r\nIf you attach a large number of attachments on an issue the new issue view fails to load them.\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Attach more than 150 attachments on an issue.\r\n # Try to view the attachments on issue view.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nAttachments load and the thumbnails of attachments are visible on the issue view.\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nAttachments show \"Failed to load\" error.\u00a0\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nThere is no current workaround",

Suggested Solution\r\nAllow admin to bulk update user profile or set default values.\r\n\r\nh3. Why this is important\r\nThis is important when there are lots of users inside a company, it's difficult for admin to guide the user to update it from id.atlassian.com. It's best if this can be done by the administrator.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\nNo workaround",
