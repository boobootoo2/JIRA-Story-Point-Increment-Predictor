Nothing to say here, easy to select each commit you want and click OK\r\n2/ There is the biggest problem: the sheet disappears and.... \"then what?\". As a noob to intermediate git user, I don't know what to do next!!!! I'm pretty sure most noobs are lost there because they think the interactive rebase process is over!\r\nNote that, as most users, I did not open/expand the \"direct git output\" in the previous sheet, that clearly explains what we should do next: abort rebase, continue rebase and another command I forgot.\r\nSo I strongly suggest displaying some sort of \" thick colored status bar\" at the top of the window (just below the NSToolbar) stating \"you're currently in an interactive git rebase process. Do the following actions to continue:\", with either the name of the action you can find in the \"Actions\" menu, or even better, with some buttons (in the thick bar) to actually do the rebase abort, rebase continue.... I would tremendously help users understand that the interactive rebase process is not over! they would immediately understand that they have actions to make (abort, continue....) to return in a \"normal\" state.\r\nThanks for listening.\r\nBTW, SourceTree is great. I can't imagine using Git without it now. Except for interactive rebase which is more \"managed\" and has more indications on what's next using the CLI!",
