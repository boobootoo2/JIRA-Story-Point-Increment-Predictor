We need a way we can add/store those dates somewhere in the board or project or admin panel so that user can only select those dates as start and end dates of the sprint.\r\n\r\nh3. Description\r\nBasically, whenever we start a sprint in a scrum board, we have to enter sprint start and end dates. We would like to have an ability to store those dates and use them while starting a sprint. Currently, a user can select his own sprint start and end dates via calendar. These dates can also be updated anytime. We would like to restrict this feature and allow user to select sprint schedules as planned by the enterprise. This will allow users to select sprint start and end dates from the list of dates defined by the enterprise only and hence remove the random selection of dates.\r\n\r\n",

      "description": "Request:\r\n * When opening help from the software, automatically pre-fill product and version - it is much easier to clear the filter or navigate to documentation start than to fill these fields correctly\r\n * Improve \"About Jira\" so users can easily tell apart what software they are using, i.e. product name, licensed/active components, and versions of product & components (new/old issue view)\r\n * Here, in [https://jira.atlassian.com/]\u00a0add a category users can obviously relate to meta information like documentation, manual, support, about etc. I chose \"Onboarding\" but that term does not at all match for questions of people using a software for years, but maybe in lower intensity. That this is not yet done shows how much Atlassian relies on \"our products are reliable and simple to understand\" and how little it emphasizes with the needs of users actually facing issues (also very visible when looking at issue comments).\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nBackground:\r\n\r\nAs a user, when I click question mark icon and then \"read help articles\", I expect the documentation on the software I use. Instead, _I need to choose_ out of several things with \"Jira\" in their name - but as average user,\u00a0 I\u00a0\"simply use\" something everyone just calls \"Jira\", so I face difficulties to choose the correct product. Several users may not even know whether product category \"Cloud\" or \"Data Center and Server\" applies, while others may be able to exclude some products by category and name, but several remain:\u00a0 !image-2021-07-02-11-00-10-876.png!\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nIf I do not select a product here but simply use the prominent search, I get a huge amount of results and many do not apply to the software I use. So, I need to filter, and hit again the products selection:\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n!image-2021-07-02-11-08-49-401.png!\r\n\r\nA very similar situation when I try to find, report, vote for issues I face, or hope to find workarounds:\r\n\r\n!image-2021-07-02-11-13-50-091.png!\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nTo make things even more difficult, there are several variations of the same component, so I need to know whether I have that \"new issue view\" Atlassian talks about in e.g.\u00a0https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-70555\u00a0or the \"old issue view\". BTW, these names will produce fun in 10 years when \"new\" is old and about to be transitioned to something else - probably called next generation or new technology.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nTo solve the quest to choose the correct product, as a slightly experienced user, I will click question mark icon and then\u00a0\"About Jira\" - which only shows the \"brand name\" Jira but nothing matching the product names in the documentation, no information on used components, no information whether \"old\" or \"new\" view is used.\r\n\r\n!image-2021-07-01-09-49-42-517.png!\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0",
