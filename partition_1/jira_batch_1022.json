So, I investigate further into the persistent layer....\n\n\nI looked at the exported DB XML and found the following relevant pieces:\n\n<OSUser id=\"10091\" name=\"hello\" passwordHash=\"m3HSJL1i83hdltRq0+o9czGb+8KJDKra4t/3JRlnPKcjI8PZm6XBHXx6zG4UuMXaDEZjR1wuXDre9G9zvN7AQw==\"/>\n  \n<OSPropertyString id=\"10163\" value=\"Hello World\"/>\n<OSPropertyString id=\"10162\" value=\"hello@xxx.com\"/>\n\n<OSPropertyEntry entityId=\"10090\" entityName=\"OSUser\" id=\"10163\"\n    propertyKey=\"fullName\" type=\"5\"/>\n<OSPropertyEntry entityId=\"10090\" entityName=\"OSUser\" id=\"10162\"\n    propertyKey=\"email\" type=\"5\"/>\n\nApparently, when I first created the user 'hello', the OSUser id was '10090'.  The 'fullName' and the 'email' attributes were still mapping to the deleted 'hello' user.  Also, note that there is no entry of <OSUser id=\"10090\" ..... > found anywhere in the DB XML.\n\n\nso, I did a step-by-step sequence and export the DB @ each step:\n\nafter first creation: above entries were all created and consistent:\nafter first delete: above entries were all gone and consistent:\nafter 2nd creation: The <OSPropertyEntry entityId=\"10090\" ....> entries somehow remembers that 'hello' used to be OSUser id 10090!!??\n\nOf course, this can be an OSUser problem, maybe because of its way of doing some caching or something when doing user-id lookup.\n\nThanks.\n\n-alvin\n",

I then enter a comment.\n\nWhen I click resolve, I get a red form error box with a BLANK bullet.  There is no additional text.  I check that the \"None\" field is clicked, which it is.  I really make no changes to the form.  I then click RESOLVE, and the issue seems to successfully resolve.\n\nMy workflow on the form now says \"Assign Issue\" and \"Reopen Issue\".  However, the status on the top left of the issue still says \"Assigned\", indicating that the issue has NOT been resolved.\n\nMy comment is NOT added to the issue, but my workflow indiciates it has changed.  If I view the workflow tab I see the following:\n\nAdam Harvey [ Start: Today 09:35 AM End: Today 12:06 PM ]  \nStatus: Finished\nAction Name (from WF): (id: 1)\nStep Name (from WF): (id: 3)\n \nAdam Harvey [ Start: Today 09:35 AM End: Today 09:35 AM ]  \nStatus: Finished\nAction Name (from WF): (id: 201)\nStep Name (from WF): (id: 2) \n\nAt this point, the issue is quite messed up, as no one can resolve the issue.

Meaning Project A has one developer, one pm, and one user. And Project B has a different developer, pm, and user. This means i have to create 9 groups to effectively isolate and manage permissions. If the number of projects i create grows to 10, i now have 30 groups, 20users. 20 projs, 60 groups, 60users. This is growing quickly.\n\nWhat if for each project i created series of roles ( developer, pm, user). These roles could be shared across projects.  And for each project, i assigned users to a role. and with those roles i controlled permissions for the individual projects.\n\nNow, continuing my example from above, in the case of 20 projects i have 3 roles, 60 users.\n\nIam interested in your opion on this.",
