Users would like option to schedule the Mail Handler so each of them get active at specific time.\n\nFor example lets say there are 3 Mail Handler:\n\nMail Handler 1 get active and deactivated after 1 minutes.\nMail Handler 2 get active after Mail Handler 1 is deactivated.\nMail Handler 3 get active after Mail Handler 2 is deactivated.\nMail Handler 1 get active after Mail Handler 3 is deactivated.\nThe cycles continues while JIRA is running.\n\nIn a way, each Mail Handler works periodically for 1 minutes while having specific time delay.\n\nAlso user would like option to set maximum number of IMAP connections in Mail Handler.\n\n*Suggested Solution*\nCurrently in JIRA setting specific time delay still makes all the Mail Handler to be activated all the time. User would like option in Mail Handler to schedule how long each Mail Handler is active \n\n*Workaround*\nCurrently there are no workaround for this.",

Summary\nIn previous versions of JIRA, the most recent selected tab when editing a transition would be remembered upon re-opening the transition or opening new browser tabs to edit other transitions while in the same session. Currently, when clicking on a transition to edit it, the Triggers tab is automatically selected regardless of previous selection. When performing an action on a different tab, the page is then refreshed and is back on the Triggers tab. This causes inconvenience when performing changes to multiple transitions, or performing multiple changes on a different tab.\n\nh3. Environment\n* v7.1.0-OD-02-030\n\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\n# Edit a Workflow\n# Click on a transition to Edit it\n# Select a different tab on this page, for example Conditions\n# Navigate back to the Edit Workflow page\n# Attempt to re-open the same Transition to edit it, or open a new Transition to Edit\n# Each time a new transition is opened up, the Triggers tab is selected by default\n\nh3. Expected Results\nThe most recent selected tab should be remembered when navigating to other transitions or re-opening transitions. This should work similar to the way tabs are remembered on a JIRA Issue.\n\nh3. Actual Results\nThe Triggers tab is selected each time, forcing to re-navigate to the correct tab.\n\nh3.Workaround\nManually navigate to the desired tab when editing a transition.",

It would be very helpful if this description were also displayed when roles are managed since it helps the administrators to identify were users should go,\n\nWe need additional roles but want to limit the number of them by naming then in a generic way (e.g. \"Custom Role 1\") and instead use some more explanatory text in the description.\nSince there is still no possibility to define project specific roles we think this is a good way to go in a large environment with almost 1000 projects.\n\nRegards,\nDieter",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-47628].\n  {panel}\n\nWe have a Team in our organization that has a use case for managing permissions at a sub-project level (the term sub-project is being used loosely here - for their purposes it could be a component or a version, etc.).\n\nSupposing there are user bases UB1 and UB2 (a set of users/groups/project roles), and sub-projects SB1 and SB2, and a hypothetical mapping that we have such that UB1 maps to SB1 and UB2 maps to SB2 - is it possible for us to set up permissions at the sub-project level such that users in UB1 would only see issues that correspond to SB1 and users in UB2 only see issues that correspond to SB2?\n\nWe would then want to extrapolate this such that one user base could map to multiple sub-projects and one sub-project could be accessible (i.e., the issues that correspond to the sub-project would be accessible) to multiple user bases and so on.\n\n----\nWe have investigated the possibility of achieving this by using issue-level security in conjunction with JJUPIN scripts and have found that too complex and hard to maintain, especially with respect to scale. We have also investigated the [Issue Type Filter plugin|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/net.youngaweb.jira.issue-type-ui-filter/server/overview], but found that it does not suit our purposes since our objective is not to limit a user base to a particular issue type, rather to create any issue type, but limit other users from seeing the created issues.\n----\nThus, we were wondering if JIRA offered any way for us to have permission management at a component (sub-project) level such that visibility/management of issues could be controlled at that level as opposed to at a Project level. Or would the official recommendation in this case be to just create separate Projects for each of our sub-projects?\n\nThank you.\n\n",

If Project Admin then assign him 80 hours, it should be possible to easily see that Project Admin have given him too much work without having to manually add up the time.\n\nAnd if Project Admin assign him 30 hours, he can see that Project Admin can give him more to do. And another member on the team works 8 hours a day, Project Admin would see that 200 hours is too much and 130 is too little.\n\n*Workaround*\nCurrently there are no workaround for this.",
