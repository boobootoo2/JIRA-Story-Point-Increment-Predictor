We also should remember people have multiple repo-windows open at once on different desktops and switch between them, so there's a number of obstacles that would need to be discussed on this one. The following would need to be addressed:\r\n\r\n1) Tabs would need to be above the toolbar, because the toolbar is context-dependent. This in itself would mean a few problems (tabs being at the very top of the screen so difficult to see perhaps)\r\n2) The ability to have separate windows rather than tabs because people have multiple windows open at once on different desktops. There would need to be an option to switch them on or off, or the user should be able to pull windows apart (like browsers allow you to do \"Open in New Window\" or \"Open in New Tab\")",

The currently opened windows in the \"Window\" menu shows open Git repositories named without the differentiation, identifying them ambiguously. See the other attachment illustrating the identically named windows. The impact is I don't know which menu element to click on to view the project, and I switch between them a lot, so I'm guessing, currently.\r\n\r\nI expect for SourceTree's existing differentiation code to be reused for the Window menu from the Open Recent menu.\r\n\r\nE.g. two projects named \"engine\", differing by parent folder name \"A01\" or \"A02\". You see {\"engine-A01\", \"engine-A02\"} in \"Open Recent\" which is great, and {\"engine\", \"engine\"} in \"Window\" which is ambiguous.\r\n\r\nThanks!",

With the \"Pull\" modal dialog still up, I see the list of commits populate with the remote umerged commits.\r\n4. I click \"OK\" and ST goes all the way back to the remote repo, and pulls (another fetch and a merge,) failing if it can't fast forward. If I need to fix my commits so that a fast forward works, if I pull again, it again fetches from the remote.\r\n\r\nI would like to see those extra fetches done away with. Either have ST not do a remote fetch if I'm about to do a pull. Or, alternatively, de-emphasize 'pull' and instead make ST fetch as normal (that is, on a schedule or if the user presses the button to do so) and have an easy way to say \"try to merge up to the latest remote commit I have locally.\" Right now, if I fetch and need to merge, even if it's a fast forward merge, I have to select my latest local commit, open the merge dialog, select the latest remote, and hit \"OK\".",

Eventually the problem passes into history and extended characters start working again for recent log entries, but it can mess up the display for a while.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that the FoundationKit methods for converting NSData to NSString simply abort the entire conversion when a badly encoded character is encountered. Right now we just fall back on other encodings so we can at least display something, but really what we'd like to do is identify where the decoding failed, decode up to that point, decode the problem character some other way, then decode the rest as UTF. Or, force the interpretation as UTF anyway and leave that one character garbled. I haven't found a way to do either on FoundationKit yet, but since this can cause issues that don't appear on some other tools that use other more tolerant decoders (like Java), it deserves another look. Perhaps there is another third party NSData -> NSString decoder we can use instead.",

Check out \"develop\" in that repository in SourceTree. Make sure you have no other local branches.\r\n3. Check out AB/button-alignment. Look at the left pane. You'll now see the AB folder as expected in your local branch list, and you are actually currently on a branch thats in that folder. However, the folder hasn't been expanded for you, so its hard to tell where you are at all. Notice that none of the branches in the list are now bold (the one thats bold is hidden), so it looks like you are \"nowhere\" in terms of your repository checkout.\r\n\r\nExpected:\r\nWhen checking out a branch that will be in a newly created folder in the source list, SourceTree should automatically expand that folder, so its clear where you are.",
