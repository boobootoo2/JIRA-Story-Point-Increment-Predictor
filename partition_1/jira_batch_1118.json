[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-45690].\n  {panel}\n\nAll my JIRA projects use Kanban boards as a primary user interface for all users. I see no use cases where I would want to set up JIRA without Kanban boards. The Kanban method and Kanban boards are just as useful for business projects as for software development projects. Kanban boards for business projects should preferably be free from any software jargon and hard-coded software-specific behavior. With the announcement of JIRA 7 Software, it seems that JIRA Agile boards may become even more software-specific in future releases.\n\nHaving to go for the full JIRA Software license just to get Kanban boards available in business projects is far from ideal. Higher cost is just one reason. Added complexity for users from seeing irrelevant software features and terminology is more important.\n\nAlong with many others, I have previously requested more flexible configuration options for JIRA Agile boards, in particular more dynamic filters.\n\nPlease consider adding a generic, flexible Kanban board as part of JIRA Core, or at least as an add-on.",

Summary\r\n\r\nGranting *Current Assignee* to the *Administer Project* permissions will allow users to see *ALL*\u00a0Projects that are assigned to that\u00a0Permission Scheme. You can see the projects even if the user does not have any\u00a0assigned issues in the project or even if the user is not listed as site-admin.\u00a0This is a security issue since it will allow users access to view Project Setting as well as Edit\u00a0some Project fields\r\nh3. Environment\r\n * JIRA Cloud: 1000.1162.0\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nIsolate test user to only have JIRA application access on instance and no\u00a0other Project Permissions:\r\n # Create sample user. (You can use any user that does not have any issue created or assigned)\r\n # Creating new group: test-group\r\n # Add group to user\r\n # Removing all other groups from user so that the only group is test-group\r\n # Add JIRA Application Access to group-test: https://<example>.atlassian.net/admin/accessconfig (just can sign in, no\u00a0admin permission)\r\n # Login in as user\r\n # Cog Wheel is *NOT*\u00a0be present in top right for JIRA Administration> This is good news and is intended\r\n # User Browse Project page: https://<example>.atlassian.net/secure/BrowseProjects.jspa?selectedCategory=all&selectedProjectType=all > Should only see the project they have access too. In this test, only project using *Any Logged in User* permission. This is right\r\n # Paste the Admin Project Page (Page which the example user cannot navigate to via the UI) > https://<example>.atlassian.net/secure/project/ViewProjects.jspa\r\n # Cannot see a list of project, this is good and right > error:\r\n{code:java}\r\nYou do not have the permissions to administer any projects, or there are none created.\r\n{code}\r\n\r\n+Create Bug+: Add *Current Assignee* to the *Administer Project* permissions for a Test Permission scheme\r\n # Adding *Current Assignee* to *Administer project* permission for sample Permission Scheme\r\n # Make sure Permission scheme has attached a few Projects\r\n # Log in as test user\r\n # Now you can see the cog wheel top right to Administer JIRA. Only selection in drop down is *Projects*\r\n # Clicking Project\u00a0will take you to the Project Admin page > https://<example>.atlassian.net/secure/project/ViewProjects.jspa\r\n # You\u00a0can see *All*\u00a0projects that have the test permission scheme attached. Even if the user never had access to view these project\u00a0or if they are not a site-admin. Users\u00a0also can make changes to certain fields\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n * For users to only be able Administer Project which they have Assigned tickets\r\n * For user to only be able to view and access project that they have Assigned tickets\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n - End users are able to view ALL Projects attached to the permission scheme with Current Assignee listed for Administer Project permission\r\n - User is also able to make changes to these project :(\r\n - The list of Projects attached to Permission scheme are\u00a0visible by all users, including non-admins.

Problem Definition\r\n\r\n* Issue change logs don't contain the fieldId of the field that was changed, but simply the field's translated name in the locale of the user who edited the issue. \r\n\r\nThis makes it incredibly hard for us to implement a field value changed trigger where we want to check if a specific field changed. Depending on the locale of the user who triggered the event and the (potentially differing locale) of the user that configured the field value changed trigger the field names may be translated differently.\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nIdeally the changelog would contain the field id (e.g. 'customfield_123453' or 'summary') in both cloud and server. I understand that these ids can change over time (in the case of custom fields), so you don't have to store them in the db with an issue's change log entries, but it would still be *very* useful information for us to pass them along in the event/webhook.\r\n",

      "description": "[This page should be updated|https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiracloud/importing-data-from-bitbucket-803604051.html] to clarify that the Bitbucket importer is no longer supported and that users need to use the JSON importer instead. It should also describe the changes necessary in order to make sure the file is imported into JIRA successfully:\r\n\r\n1. The Bitbucket \"issues\" attribute, i.e.\r\n{code:java}\r\n\"issues\": [\r\n\t    {\r\n\t      \"status\": \"new\",\r\n\t      \"priority\": \"major\",\r\n\t      \"kind\": \"bug\",\r\n\t      \"content_updated_on\": null,\r\n\t      \"voters\": [],\r\n\t      \"title\": \"A title for the issue\",\r\n\t      \"reporter\": \"dmeyer\",\r\n\t      \"component\": null,\r\n\t      \"watchers\": [\r\n\t        \"dmeyer\"\r\n\t      ],\r\n\t      \"content\": \"A description of the issue\",\r\n\t      \"assignee\": null,\r\n\t      \"created_on\": \"2017-08-01T20:24:43.481898+00:00\",\r\n\t      \"version\": null,\r\n\t      \"edited_on\": null,\r\n\t      \"milestone\": null,\r\n\t      \"updated_on\": \"2017-08-01T20:24:43.481898+00:00\",\r\n\t      \"id\": 2\r\n\t    }\r\n\t   ]\r\n{code}\r\nThis needs to be wrapped inside of a {{\"project\"}} object in order for JIRA to successfully create project. So the above example needs to look something like this:\r\n{code:java}\r\n\"projects\": [\r\n        {\r\n            \"name\": \"A Sample Project\",\r\n            \"key\": \"ASM\",\r\n            \"description\": \"A description of the project\",\r\n            \"type\": \"software\",\r\n            \"template\":\"com.pyxis.greenhopper.jira:gh-scrum-template\",\r\n\t\t  \"issues\": [\r\n\t\t    {\r\n\t\t      \"status\": \"To Do\",\r\n\t\t      \"priority\": \"major\",\r\n\t\t      \"kind\": \"bug\",\r\n\t\t      \"content_updated_on\": null,\r\n\t\t      \"voters\": [],\r\n\t\t      \"title\": \"My first issue!\",\r\n\t\t      \"reporter\": \"dmeyer\",\r\n\t\t      \"component\": null,\r\n\t\t      \"watchers\": [\r\n\t\t        \"dmeyer\"\r\n\t\t      ],\r\n\t\t      \"summary\": \"issue from bitbucket\",\r\n\t\t      \"assignee\": \"dmeyer\",\r\n\t\t      \"created_on\": \"2016-11-03T06:31:17.395256+00:00\",\r\n\t\t      \"version\": null,\r\n\t\t      \"edited_on\": null,\r\n\t\t      \"milestone\": null,\r\n\t\t      \"updated_on\": \"2016-11-03T06:31:17.395256+00:00\",\r\n\t\t      \"id\": 1\r\n\t\t    }\r\n\t\t   ]\r\n\t\t}\r\n  ]\r\n{code}\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n2. The project object, in addition to a name, key and description, requires a {{\"type\"}} field that can be \"business\", \"software\", or \"service-desk\", and a {{\"template\"}} field that should be supplied if \"software\" is selected. For a SCRUM project the template should be \"com.pyxis.greenhopper.jira:gh-scrum-template\" and for a KANBAN project the template should be \"com.pyxis.greenhopper.jira:gh-kanban-template\". The full list of templates available can be obtained from this private API {{[https://{{yourjirasite}}.atlassan.net/rest/project-templates/1.0/templates|https://yourjirastie.atlassan.net/rest/project-templates/1.0/templates]}}.\r\n\r\n3. Several fields need to be renamed in order to be mapped correctly to JIRA fields. A full list is already on the documentation page but this needs to be done manually in the JSON file\u00a0and won't be handled in a wizard. Specifically:\r\n||In Bitbucket Export||Rename to import to JIRA||\r\n|title|summary|\r\n|kind|issuetype|\r\n|content|description|\r\n\r\n4. You must verify that the statuses and issue types that your Bitbucket issues will map to have already been created in JIRA.",

This is in contrast to how things used to be before this system was overhauled back in May. Before that, it was possible to keep multiple accounts active in different tabs of the same browser.\r\n\r\nSuggestion\r\n1. Restore the status quo - preferred option. Perhaps, make it an option to trade security for convenience.\r\n\r\n2. Make it less awkward to switch between accounts (without full log out and log in). For example, make it similar to how we can change projects within the same organization.",

Customers are experiencing this and the problem is also visible on our {{tempo-io}} instance. The thing is that we publish team and account options and use them on issues, however the JQL search are not consistent when searching with them.\r\n\r\nFor example, we have one team linked to one project for which there are multiple issues with this team option. When we search issues with jql `team = \"myteam\"` it does not find all issues having this team option. I tried re-publishing the options with no luck.\r\n\r\nAn example of this it `PLAT-564`. This issue has the team option `2`, which has value \u201cPlatform Engineering\u201d. However, JQL search with `team=\u201cPlatform Engineering\u201d does not return it. But many others issues using the same option are returned as expected. Could you have a quick look and indicate me what could be wrong? Thanks!\r\n\r\nwhen I get the issue, it has this field:\r\n{code:java}\r\n \"customfield_10305\": {\r\n      \"id\": 2,\r\n      \"value\": \"Platform Engineering\"\r\n    },\r\n{code}\r\nthen this options is (stripped because long, kept relevant parts):\r\n{code:java}\r\n \"projects2\": [\r\n        {\r\n          \"attributes\": [],\r\n          \"id\": 10301\r\n        },\r\n ],\r\n \"id\": 2,\r\n \"value\": \"Platform Engineering\"\r\n{code}\r\nnote that it has alot more projects in `projects2`, all others being\r\n{code:java}\r\n\"attributes\": [\r\n            \"notSelectable\"\r\n          ],\r\n         \"id\": ...\r\n{code}\r\nthis is a case with teams, customer reported `account` problems as well.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\nh2. Workaround\r\n\r\nUntil we solve this issue, there is a workaround available for\u00a0instances exhibiting the issue. Instead of using option value, we can use id of the option. for e.g.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n{code:java}\r\naccount = aaa{code}\r\ncan be changed to\r\n{code:java}\r\naccount.id = 2{code}\r\nWhere 2 is the id of the option.\u00a0\r\n\r\nId of the option can be retrieved either with REST API query, e.g.\u00a0[https://docs.atlassian.com/jira/REST/cloud/#api/2/field/\\|https://docs.atlassian.com/jira/REST/cloud/#api/2/field/]\\{fieldKey}/option-getAllOptions\r\n\r\n\u00a0or it's in the url of the option configuration screen. For example, on Account configuration screen it's here:\u00a0\r\n!option_id.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\n\u00a0",

      "description": "{panel:title=Update - July 13, 2021}\r\nThank you everyone for your patience in waiting for this ticket to be resolved. We wanted to share an update that our Engineering teams have taken note of the number of customers impacted by this ticket and we are working on a plan to drive it toward resolution. Our goal is to inform administrators when an email address is put onto the suppression list, and then ultimately provide a way to remove them from the list. This improvement will take a coordinated effort across a number of back end and front end teams, and so we are unable to provide an exact timeframe for when the improvements will be in place at this stage, but we'll ensure we keep this ticket updated with any news.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor now, we are also shifting this issue over to become a suggestion, as while the experience of dropping emails is far from ideal, it is intended behaviour for email addresses to go onto the suppression list if they aren't responding, so that we can assure delivery for other emails. We are making this change for internal workflow reasons, but it does not change the priority that we are applying to resolving this ticket.\r\n\r\n\r\nKind Regards,\r\nMatt Hunter\r\n_Senior Manager, Cloud Service Enablement_\r\n{panel}\r\nh3. \u00a0\r\nh3. Summary\r\n\r\nFor whatever reason that a JIRA notification email bounces back to Atlassian Cloud's mail server, the recipient's email address will be blocked in the system. At this state, no further notification emails can be sent out to the blocked email address. Furthermore, there are no indications in JIRA cloud that an email address is in this state.\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n - Send out an email notification to an email address with a full mailbox.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n - An error message should be indicated somewhere that the email bounced back and that the email address is blocked. There should be a threshold for bounces before adding the email address into the drop list.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n - The email address will be blocked in the mail server and the JIRA users has no indication that the email address is in this current state.\r\n\r\nh3. Notes\r\n\r\nAtlassian Support can trace these notification emails and unblock the email addresses but there are no indicators in JIRA that can warn users of the current state of the email address. The email address will remain in this state until they reach out to Atlassian support to troubleshoot missing notification emails.\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nPlease contact Atlassian Support to check if the missing notification emails is related to this issue.",
