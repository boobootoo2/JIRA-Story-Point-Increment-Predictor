Anytime you are mentioned in an issue, or in a comment, you will immediately receive an email stating you have been mentioned (it won't come as part of the new email batches, thus won't be time delayed).\r\n\r\nBest Regards,\r\n\r\nJosh Devenny, PM, Atlassian\r\n{panel}\r\nI have configured my Jira account to send emails. When someone mentions me in a comment or description, usually the email contains the text \"x commented on\", and only sometimes does it contain the text \"x mentioned you\".\r\n\r\nI rely on the \"x mentioned you\" to filter incoming email using inbox rules. If it doesn't contain that phrase, it skips my inbox.\r\n\r\nThe behavior described above means that email updates for most comments where I am mentioned by name skip my inbox. Can it be fixed that such emails always contain \"x mentioned you\"?\r\n\r\nEven more usefull would be if emails from Jira contain tags that can be used for inbox rules.\r\n\r\nThank you for considering!",

The default should only be applied if the field is empty upon the transition starting.\n\nCurrently I am achieving this using some ajax and javascript code, but it doesn't always work.\n\nI have investigated transition post-functions but they're not ideal, because I want a user to see that they have been set as the value for the field, while also having the option to change it to another value. Using a post-function either over-writes their value, or even if it doesn't, it looks odd to the user to leave a field blank and then have it automatically populated with their name when they click save - better to auto-populate it with their name when the form first loads so there is no confusion about what's happening.",

For example, you may have configured a project to use a status In QA Review in its workflow. If you select this project and status in your search, then change the search to filter for a project that doesn't use n QA Review, the status will be invalid and ignored in the search.\nIf I also select explicitly the project name in the search criteria, then Component does appear and can be selected.\nThe question is why is it necessary to select also the project name in this case? The above reasoning does not apply.\nPlease note also that if I switch to Advanced Search and just type Component = xxx, it does work fine.\nI believe this is a bug. Could you please try to reproduce it?\n\nPS. The above problem happens also with other system fileds, such as Fix Version for example which also appears greyed out.\n\nThanks,\nIoannis\n",

Summary\n\nThe issue navigator leaks memory in the client-side when browsing through the issue results in an issue search. This happens in both list view and details view, and has been tested in google chrome\n\nh3. Environment\n(Optional - If Applicable)\n* Google Chrome.\n\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\n# Execute a JQL Query with a significant number of total results (for example, 1000).\n# Open Developer Tools --> Timeline - Check memory and Start Recording.\n# Start browsing through the issues in the list (use j/k in list view / using the up-down arrows should be enough in details view).\n# After you have done this for a number of issues (for example, 20), stop recording in the Timeline.\n# *BUG* Notice the graph on memory consumption and how it keeps creeping up without memory being reclaimed.\n\nh3. Expected Results\n\nMemory usage does not keep increasing as you browse through issues. The allocated memory used when you go from one issue to another is reclaimed.\n\nh3. Actual Results\nMemory usage keeps increasing as you browse through all the issues in your results potentially leading to slugginess in the client.\n\nh3.Workaround\n\nClose the tab / Chrome and navigate to the page again in a new tab.\n\nh3. Original Description\n\n{quote}When leaving JIRA open in Chrome for an extended period of time, Chrome will eventually grow to consume a large percentage of the RAM on my machine. As much as 50% of available RAM will be set for that process in Chrome (not the only chrome process).\n\nEnding this chrome task will close out only JIRA tabs, indicating that JIRA is causing the memory leak.\n{quote}",
