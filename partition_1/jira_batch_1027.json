[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-634].\n  {panel}\n\nHi,\n\nNot sure if this is outside the scope of the project but here's an idea.  We now have the perfect issue-resolution work flow with Jira, where users report an issue, we resolve it, then they close it once they've tested the resolution.  (Just to clarify, our 'users' give us a spec for the applications that we develop and so are internal, not Joe Public...)\n\nIt would be a great extension of this workflow to apply it to versions of projects as well as to individual bugs.  This would mean that our users can 'sign-off' a version as being complete and ready for deployment to production.\n\nWould anyone else find this useful?  Currently we do all our great work in Jira then have to go to Lotus Notes for sign-off (!)  Linking to Jira's roadmap of course ;)  Which almost works...! (JRA-633)\n\n  Mike",
