Character conversion is the translation from one character set (e.g., UTF-16) to another character set (e.g., UTF-8).\r\nThe figure http://docs.oracle.com/cd/B19306_01/server.102/b14225/ch2charset.htm#i1007338 illustrates a case where the database is using one character set, and the clients are using various other character sets with character conversion done somewhere along the way between the clients and the server.\r\nI was wondering if such translation was possible with FishEye, so that FishEye would work even when the database is not using UTF-8. \r\n",
