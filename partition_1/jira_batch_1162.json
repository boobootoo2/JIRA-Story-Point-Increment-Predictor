If you type a correctly formatted issue key into any text field in JIRA, whether it uses wiki markup or not, it will present as a link to that issue.

Problem Definition\n\nCurrently our Documentation provides the following guidance for upgrading JIRA and Supported plugins.  \n\n{quote}\nIf you have installed JIRA plugins (i.e. not included with JIRA), verify that they will be compatible with the version of JIRA you are upgrading to. You can find a plugin's compatibility information from the plugin's home page on the Atlassian Plugin Exchange.\n{quote}\n\nh3. Suggested Solution\n\nThe Universal Plugin Manager is able to check Plugin versions against newer releases. This simpler approach should be taken for customers to check their compatibility when upgrading a running Instance.

Problem Definition\n\nCurrently, the Resolution Time Gadget's Y Axis is set to measure *Days*, and this cannot be configured. If an issue is created and resolved in less than a full day, it will be represented on this gadget with a resolution time that is rounded down to 0 days. \n\nIf the following situation occurs:\n\n# An issue is created and resolved in less than the span of a full day\n# There are no other issues resolved on that day to raise the average of all issues to *at least* 1 day \n\nA confusing scenario will result where the chart shows no visible measurement for the day. You cannot discern if either no issues were resolved that day, or if there are issues but they average < 1 day. For example, in the screenshot below:\n\n !Resolution_Time_Gadget.png|thumbnail! \n\nWithout expanding the gadget to view the data table, you cannot see that issues were resolved on 4/20/16 and 4/21/16.\n\nh3. Suggested Solution\n \nThis could be addressed by allowing the Y axis measurement to be configured for more granularity; for example, by the *Hour* rather than by the *Day*.\n\nh3. Workaround \nNone; expand the data table to view specific data.",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-60752].\n  {panel}\n\nHi JIRA team,\n\nLet me introduce our problem:\n\nWe would like to take advantage of \"Road map\" feature in project. Found out that it is interconnected with \"Fix Version/s\" field.\n\nWe started to use \"Fix Version/s\" for marking build number (e.g. \"6.1.23.0\") to which the issues is fixed.\nAtlassian help says this field should be used for marking mentioned, or future version to which we plan to fix this issue.\n\nThere are several build before a release is released. We may call the planned release something general like \"Service Release 1 (SR1)\". We plan to release SR1 let's say in Q3/2016.\n \nThis is where the problem lies. When we would like to take advantage of \"Road Map\", all \"unreleased\" versions are part of the roadmap. The roadmap will look as follows\n* 6.1.23.0\n* 6.1.24.0\n* 6.1.25.0\n* 6.1.26.0\n* 6.1.27.0\n* 6.1.28.0\n* Service Release 1 (SR1)\n* 6.1.29.0\n* 6.1.30.0\n* 6.1.31.0\n* 6.1.32.0\n* Service Release 2 (SR2)\n\nBasically, we would like to be able to filter build numbers so roadmap looks as follows:\n* Service Release 1 (SR1)\n* Service Release 2 (SR2)\n\nThe released build for SR1 will be \"6.1.28.0\" (but we obviously do not know the build number upfront, we call it SR1)\nThe released build for SR2 will be \"6.1.32.0\"(but we obviously do not know the build number upfront, we call it SR1)\n\nWe understand, that we may be able to set build numbers \"Release flag\" and they will not be shown in \"Road Map\". But this is not true and we do not want to do that. These build numbers are just interim builds for testing that will never be released.\n\nWe also understand that we may \"Archive\" the version. But we do not want to do that as well as archived versions cannot be searched for using Basic filter in JIRA. It is still available using JQL in advanced filter, but not all users are capable of creating their own advanced filter.\n\nI hope the problem is described clearly. If not, let me know and I will provide more information.\nMaybe there is another way we may achieve our goal which may be articulated as follows:\n\n* We would like to map issues to future larger releases like \"Service Release (SR1)\" and see \"Road Map\" with number of planned issues vs fixed issues. as follows:\n** Service Release 1 (SR1)\n** Service Release 2 (SR2)\n\nThank you very much in advance",

Currently, there is no warning from JIRA when you don't have the Isolation Level configured correctly.\n\nh3. Suggested Solution\nAdd a healthcheck function that checks that the correct isolation level is set, and gives a warning if it isn't.

Problem Definition\nIn JIRA 6.4 and above, it is currently possible to use the following entity properties in JQL searches to return issues that have associated pull requests.\n\n{noformat}issue.property[development].prs\nissue.property[development].openprs{noformat}\n\nHowever, it is not currently possible to return issues based on the status of the associated pull request. Leveraging the above properties in the manner below will still return pull requests that were declined, which in many cases can be undesirable.\n\n{noformat}issue.property[development].prs > 0 and issue.property[development].openprs = 0{noformat}\n\nh3. Suggested Solution\n\nAn additional entity property representing the pull request status would allow for more flexibility in JQL searches with pull request related conditions. A prsstatus property that would expose the current state of the associated pull request would allow for this.",

Problem Definition\n\nThe \"permission\" column is showing NULL values from the \"schemepermissions\" table. This column seems to be normally NULL for any permission scheme apart from Default Permission Scheme or Global Permissions. Although, the table is used to track both Global and Project permissions, the permission column used to only be applicable to the global, default or inbuilt permission schemes.\n\nh3.

Because the javascript file I was embedding it in was in strict mode it failed. (my build system uses webpack to bundle all my js). The problem was the the script downloaded to my page referenced a variable called \"hideDialog\" and this variable is not prefixed by the \"var\" keyword which failed strict mode.\n\nI fixed it locally by manually downloading the javascript referred to in the embeddable snippet ie \n[https://avocadoconsulting.atlassian.net/s/e8998266a22de47600f7a8650aafb214-T/hdpdpv/72002/b6b48b2829824b869586ac216d119363/2.0.13/_/download/batch/com.atlassian.jira.collector.plugin.jira-issue-collector-plugin:issuecollector-embededjs/com.atlassian.jira.collector.plugin.jira-issue-collector-plugin:issuecollector-embededjs.js?locale=en-UK&collectorId=f4742d98]\n\nI added the \"var\" keyword in front of the \"hideDialog\" variable at that URL where it is defining a function, it at the declaration of \"hideDialog\" not at its usages.\n\nI then modified the \"url\" reference in the JQuery ajax call given in the embeddable JavaScript (see below) to call my file rather than your URL... it then worked fine\n\nI assume that the fix for you is to place \"use strict;\" in your source file and put \"var\" in front of \"hideDialog\" in its declaration.\n\nCheers\n\nKarl Roberts\nkarl.roberts@owtelse.com\nkarl.roberts@avocadoconsulting.com.au\n\nFYI the embedded javascript code I received from Jira's issue collector page is below.\n\n// Requires jQuery!\njQuery.ajax({\n    url: \"https://avocadoconsulting.atlassian.net/s/e8998266a22de47600f7a8650aafb214-T/hdpdpv/72002/b6b48b2829824b869586ac216d119363/2.0.13/_/download/batch/com.atlassian.jira.collector.plugin.jira-issue-collector-plugin:issuecollector-embededjs/com.atlassian.jira.collector.plugin.jira-issue-collector-plugin:issuecollector-embededjs.js?locale=en-UK&collectorId=f4742d98\",\n    type: \"get\",\n    cache: true,\n    dataType: \"script\"\n});\n\n window.ATL_JQ_PAGE_PROPS =  {\n\t\"triggerFunction\": function(showCollectorDialog) {\n\t\t//Requires that jQuery is available! \n\t\tjQuery(\"#myCustomTrigger\").click(function(e) {\n\t\t\te.preventDefault();\n\t\t\tshowCollectorDialog();\n\t\t});\n\t}};\n",

Workaround \nUsing the the JIRA Suite Utilities plugin it's possible to use the Copy Value From Other Field Post-Function, allowing JIRA to be setup in the following manner:\n\n    Remove the Issue Type field from the default screen scheme, disabling users ability to edit an issue type normally.\n    Add a workflow step to change the issue type.\n    This step will use the JIRA Suite Utilities post-function to set the old Issue Type in the Custom Field.\n",
