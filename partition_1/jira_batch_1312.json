      "description": "h3. Issue Summary\r\nWhen a view is being used by a user, but is then deleted by another user, the view gets renamed for the users using it as \"Untitled (Draft)\". The user who deleted it will not see the view show up in their list, but others will see it as \"Untitled (Draft)\". However, if other users did not have it selected as their current view, it will just be removed. This behaviour can be observed regardless of making the view default for all users.\r\n\r\nThe [documentation on draft views|https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirasoftwareserver/modify-a-view-1044784239.html] doesn't appear to cover this behaviour. Instead, it states:\r\n{quote}\r\nYou may also see an *Untitled [Draft]* view while accessing plans in your instance. This happens when you\u2019re accessing an existing plan with issue filters and view settings that were previously configured but not saved. You can finalize this draft by saving it as a new view.\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Create three users who have access to a newly created plan.\r\n # Set up the new plan environment:\r\n #* User 1 creates a new view called \"My New View\". No specific changes are required to reproduce the problem. Just so long as the new view is created.\r\n #* User 2 selects \"My New View\" as their current view.\r\n #* User 3 keeps \"Basic\" as their current view, but can see \"My New View\" as an option in their drop-down list of views.\r\n # Delete the view:\r\n #* User 1 deletes the view. \"My New View\" is no longer in their drop-down list of views.\r\n #* User 2 has the name of the view renamed to \"Untitled (Draft)\" and the settings of the view remain. Additionally, the view will remain in their list of available views after switching to a new view, and even logging out and back in.\r\n #* User 3 can no longer see \"My New View\" as an option in their drop-down list of views. Nor can they see \"Untitled (Draft)\" in the list either.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nIf a view is deleted from the plan, it should be removed for all users.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n # As mentioned above, if a user had the plan which was deleted selected as their view at the time, it will be renamed to \"Untitled (Draft)\" instead of just removed. All other users will have it removed from their view drop-down list.\r\n # There are no relevant entries generated in the logs for this issue.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\nThe only real work around here is to advise users that if they see \"Untitled (Draft)\" in their list of views that it is possibly due to the view they were working on being removed and they should select another view, or delete it.\r\n\r\n(i) This bug may also affect versions below Jira 8.16.",

Like in the JQL, I am thinking I will need to list the names of all members of the team (i.e., Assignee IN ('assignee1', 'assignee2', etc)) then on the Action update the Team field accordingly.\r\n\r\nIs there a way we can instead refer to the members defined in Shared Teams in Advanced Roadmaps and retrieve the corresponding Team from there?

Issue Summary\r\n\r\nIn Roadmaps, if the view is saved with grouping by a component, where one of the component groups includes a component that was deleted after the view is saved, Roadmaps will still operate that group like nothing happened, and does not tell the user there is a problem. It can also produce visual artifacts (like a blank mutliselect items) and still submit non-existing component IDs for new issues created in a plan.\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Configure grouping by components in the view.\r\n # For one of the groups, select multiple components.\r\n # Save the view.\r\n # In Jira delete one of the components mentioned in the component group in that roadmaps view.\r\n # Open the plan again, and observe that Portfolio does not detect the fact that the component is not available anymore.\r\n # Select the saved views, and try to add a new issue to the plan. Portfolio will prepopulate the components in new issues with those from the group, including the non-existing one.\r\n # Observe that Portfolio creates multiselect items with blank names, since it cannot resolve the component name that was deleted, but still carries its ID in views.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nPortfolio should explicitly tell the user that something is wrong, since one of the components names cannot be resolved.\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nPortfolio just carries on like nothing happened, producing visual artifacts.\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nEither drop and recreate a component groups (if you know which group contains deleted component IDs), or just re-create the saved view to remove references to the deleted components.",

For example:\r\n- Full re-index the system.\r\n- Let DVCS indexing happen.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe issue must be reindexed (either via a direct update to the issue, project, or instance) in order for the Team value to be restored.

Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Begin with a stock instance of Jira, as necessary\r\n# Set up a DVCS account integration, such as with Github.\r\n# Install Advanced Roadmaps\r\n# Create a Plan, and associate an existing issue with a Team\r\n# Create a subtask underneath the issue, which will cause the subtask to inherit the Team.

      "description": "h3. Summary\r\nWhen a subtask gets created after the parent issue gets associated with Team, the plan will not show the subtask has inherited Team value from its Parent. This is reproducible intermittently.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to reproduce\r\n# Create parent issue ABC-1 > associate with Team value\r\n# Create subtask under ABC 1, lets say issue key = ABC-2\r\n# Refresh the plan\r\n\r\nh3. Expected result\r\nThe plan will show ABC-2 (subtask) has Team field value same as its parent's team field value\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Result\r\n* The plan shows blank Team for ABC-2 (subtask)\r\n!planteam.png|thumbnail!\r\n* The JQL result will be inconsistent as well.\r\n!jqlteam.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nh4. Workaround 1\r\n\r\nSeems to be breaking the index, so user can:\r\n* Run project reindexing, OR\r\n* Remove and readd the team value for parent issue ABC-1 on the plan, then apply the changes back to Jira via *Review changes*\r\n\r\nh4. Workaround 2\r\n# Add this system property to disable filtering indexers by value ( [Setting properties and options on startup|https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiraserver/setting-properties-and-options-on-startup-938847831.html] )\r\n{code}\r\n-Djira.cfv.driven.indexing.disabled=true\r\n{code}\r\n(i) You can learn more about this property from  [Optimizing custom fields |https://confluence.atlassian.com/enterprise/optimizing-custom-fields-1005343684.html#Optimizingcustomfields-HowdoIdisablethisfeature]\r\n# Restart Jira\r\n# Perform a full re-index.
