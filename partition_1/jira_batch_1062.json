This particular feature appears to be a hold-over from Jira server where administrators have an expectation to know the filepath of the icon images they would want to use. However Cloud site-admins do not have this ability, and in turn they are unable to select from the available existing icons.\r\n\r\nIf an admin should ever delete an existing priority, say Low or Medium, then when they try to create a new replacement priority they don't actually see those as options either.\u00a0 Even though these are default icons that are included in every Jira Cloud site today.\r\n \u00a0\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # As a Jira admin go to the priorities .atlassian.net/secure/admin/ViewPriorities.jspa\r\n # Go to Add a new priority section\r\n # Click the 'select image' link there a popup will appear\r\n\r\nh3.

This list of sprints includes all sprints the ticket was part of until the sprint was closed (the inactive sprints) and the current active sprint it is part of.\r\n\r\nFor example, if a ticket was part of _Sprint A_, _Sprint B_ (inactive) and is part of _Sprint C_ (active) and is removed from Sprint C while it's active, history will show:\r\n* Sprint A, Sprint B, Sprint C -> Sprint A, Sprint B\r\n\r\n{panel}\r\n_Note that this is when changing sprints while the sprint is active. If the ticket is moved to backlog or another sprint upon the sprint's closure, it won't show any history items for it, as the ticket remains in the sprint_\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\nThis may be misleading to users, as it does not clearly shows what sprint is active or inactive in the history item. Someone looking at the history may mistakenly think the issue was added to Sprint B in this operation, while it was only removed from Sprint C.\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nShow sprint history by separating the closed sprint list from the active sprint in history items with square brackets or parentheses. The example above would be, for example:\r\n* [ Sprint A, Sprint B ], Sprint C -> [ Sprint A, Sprint B ]\r\n\r\nWe can clearly see the Sprint C was the active one and it was removed. \r\n \r\nh3. Workaround \r\n\r\nThere is no workaround, but the easiest way to avoid misinterpretations of the history is to:\r\n* Always check for what changed from the old to the new values (in that example, Sprint A and Sprint B are in both old and new values, so they didn't change)\r\n* Know that only the active sprint will actually change, so pay attention to the last sprint in the list.",

Issue Summary\r\n\r\nWhen creating a mail handler, you can select a default reporter that will create issues on behalf of users that don't have a Jira account or permissions within the project.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the behaviour seems inconsistent. Specially for existing users that don't have permissions within the target project. \r\nJira will use the default reporter to create the issue for those users, but not the attachments.\r\n\r\nHere are the scenarios I tested, along with their results:\r\n{panel}\r\n * When sending an email from a non-Jira user:\r\n ** Issue was created by the default reporter with attachment (/).\r\n * Jira user created, but has no permissions in the project:\r\n ** Issue created by default reporter without attachment (i);\r\n * Deactivated user (neither product access nor site access):\r\n ** Issue created by default reporter with attachment (/).\r\n * Site access toggled on but no product access:\r\n ** Issue created by default reporter, without attachment (i).\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n* Create a mail handler pointing to a project;\r\n** Set a default reporter on that mail handler (make sure the default reporter has all the necessary permissions within the project).\r\n* Have a Jira user with product access to Jira, but make sure it has no permissions within the project pointed by the mail handler;\r\n* Send an email with attachment to Jira from the email address that belongs to the user created in the previous step.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nJira will look into the default reporter to create the issue along with its attachments.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nJira creates the issue, but won't create the attachment.\r\n\r\nThe following message may be added as a comment in the new issue:\r\n{noformat}\r\nReporter (<username>) does not have permission to create attachments in project <project key>. Following attachments found in the email have been discarded:\r\n* attachment.extension\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nh3.
