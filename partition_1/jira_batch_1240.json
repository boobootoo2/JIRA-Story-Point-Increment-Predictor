The current model only allows that to be done on a fixed date basis.  It would be nice to add the following two functions to JQL to make this easier to accomplish:\nstartOfLastMonth()\nstartOfLastWeek()\n\nMaybe even the following as well:\nstartOfLastYear()\n\nThat way users can write queries like:\n.... and created >= startOfLastMonth() and created < startOfMonth()\n\nThese would be very useful when doing metrics, and I would think would be very simple to implement.\n\nPlease consider adding these functions.\n\nThanks.",

Obviously any jira administrator will tell that this is wrong, as it will create problems, like:\n\n* keeping project configuration updated, components, versions, roles or permission will always be unsynced.\n* inability to properly create hierarhic dependencies in GH (you can have epic > story > task only inside the same project)... and in our case we ca CP issues that do have CA ones as subtasks (we use issue links instead, as this is not possible).\n\nNow, the main blocked here is that people do want to be able to knwo what kind of issue type is based on the issue-key.\n\nI do have to confess that I fully understand them, it's quite important to be able to distinguish between them, you cannot always imagine that people do know the meaning of each number.\n\nFrom the implementation point of view this could be achieved by having some kind of aliases for the project keys like CA=CP=CR=... \n\nAs a note, there is no need to have separate numbering for the issues, it is perfectly OK to share a single sequence numbering. Basically it would not matter if someone writes CA-1234 or CP-1234, it will go to the same issue.\n\nAs a note: still when you see an issue, you should see it listed using its own key ( assuming that you have CP-1234 and you search for it using CA-1234, jira should return CP-1234). This seems to be something that could be implemented using current redirection (used when you move issues between projects).\n\nUpdate: an alternative to this would be to have something like, PROJ-XX-1234 or PROJ-YY-1234 that would allow people to distinguish between different issue types, without having to read/specify the description.",

Is there a way currently that I can add a issue  from another issue type?\nExample: I want to add a bug from test case while I execute my testcase and the linking should happen automatically once I create the bug, so that its easy for the traciability \nIf this is going to be a new feature, could you guys please advise costing details as well as the time frame required....\n 2. Inline editing for a filter search , there is settings Icon to edit, but can we edit inline itself, so that I dont need to go to one more screen to update stauses\n\nplease let me know if the above are clear to you... else you can contact me over phone - 02 93587871 for further information",

The 3 statuses are: has value you want, doesn't have the value you want, empty. This causes a break in logic when performing queries such as:\n\n{code}component != ABC{code}\n\nbecause issues with no component are not returned. Smarter people than me included some formal logic on this:\n\n!universal-quantification.png!\n\nIf we do not want to fix this in the JQL logic due to wanting to stay SQL like, or a high time cost, or too much impact on existing queries, then simply adding some suggestion logic in the Issue Navigator is a pretty acceptable workaround.\n\nFor example, search for:\n{code}component != ABC{code}\nAnd then have JIRA say:\n{code}Did you mean:\ncomponent != ABC OR component is EMPTY{code}",

Aside from this, Linked Issues appears to be a core piece of functionality in Jira, therefore being able to apply this transition seems logical.\n\nFor Example:\n\nSupport-1 is relates by Issue-2, Issue-3, Issue-4.  I would expect to add a Condition on the Moving to \"Retest\" on Support-1 that will not allow it to move unless all Issues Linked with the \"relates to\" link are at \"Resolved\" or \"Closed\".  I then add a \"Transition Linked Issue\" Post Function to the Workflow of Issue-2,3,4 that will fire that Transition.\n\nThe use case is that the Support teams who are also using the Jira system will get a notification that they need to verify that the support ticket can be closed based on the new work.\n\nWe do have various other use-cases for this same functionality, in terms of getting round the fixed hierarchy of issue types (e.g. creating an Issue-type that groups \"Story\" issues together under an \"Epic\" in Greenhopper).",

When the same field is associated to multiple screens, the real estate associated with that list minimizes the number of fields that you can see.  (see attachment of what I can see on my computer screen that is at 1024x768)\n\nProvide ability to multi-select show and hide.  Currently, each selection refreshes the screen and you have to navigate back down to show/hide, as necessary.  This is very beneficial when cleaning up existing field configuration screens since new fields are automatically added to all and often we want to hide them. \n\n",

Filtering for active and inactive users has been available in Atlassian Cloud for some time.\n\nUnfortunately, JIRA Server does not share the same user management system and we have not been able to implement this feature in JIRA Server; however we will continue to consider it for the future.\n\nI understand that our decision may be disappointing. Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.\n \nRegards,\nDave Meyer\ndmeyer@atlassian.com\nProduct Manager, JIRA Platform\n{panel}\n\nAdd a filter option in the User Browser to filter specifically for inactive users",

In our case, this is usually any multiline text field such as Description or other custom field we've generated. It would be great if we could activate inline edit for this fields only when the Edit icon is clicked. I am picturing an option like so:\n\nDefault: Inline Edit enabled for all fields.\nEdit Icon: List of fields for which Inline Edit is activated only when Edit Icon is clicked\nDisabled: List of field for which Inline Edit is disabled.\n\n--\nPer user option (JRA-29091) would be nice but is not required for our needs.",
