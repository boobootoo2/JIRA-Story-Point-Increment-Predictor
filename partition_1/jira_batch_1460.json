      "description": "h3. Summary\r\n\r\nWhen a Crucible Project is created and there's no repository to be set as the default, either because there's no repository yet in FishEye or all of them are stopped/disabled, Crucible does not add a default repository. The problem with that is, Crucible needs the default repository to be able to create hyperlinks to the repositories inside the activity page for that project. Since there's no default, there's no hyperlink, no matter how many repositories you add to the project.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n# Go to {{Administration >> Repository Settings >> Repositories}} and make sure there's currently no active FishEye repository.\r\n# Go to {{Administration >> Project Settings >> Projects}} and create a Crucible project (e.g. Testing Project).\r\n!create_project_no_repo.png|thumbnail!\r\n(i) Note that under *Content* there will be no _Default Repository_ selected (i.e. blank field).\r\n# Go back to {{Administration >> Repository Settings >> Repositories}} and turn the repositories back on.\r\n# Go to the {{Administration >> Project Settings >> Projects}} page, locate the Testing Project and under *Actions* click the Fisheye content option.\r\n# Add one of your repositories to the project (e.g. Github).\r\n!add_project_to_repo.png|thumbnail!\r\n# From the top navigation bar, click {{Project >> All projects}}.\r\n!project_no_default_repo.png|thumbnail!\r\n(i) From the list of Projects you'll see there's no *Repository* for the Project you just created (e.g. Testing Project).\r\n# Access the Project.\r\n!repo_without_hyperlink.png|thumbnail!\r\n(i) Unlike the reviews, the repositories are greyed out.\r\n# Go to the {{Administration >> Project Settings >> Projects}} page and access the project (e.g. Testing Project).\r\n# You'll see there's a _Default Repository_ now, even though you never selected one. This is misleading because, in fact, there's no default repository for that Project. Since there isn't a _None_ option for that field, Crucible displays the first repository in the list of active repositories. Now select one of the repositories from that list and *Save* the page.\r\n!edit_crucible_project.png|thumbnail!\r\n# From the top navigation bar, click {{Project >> All projects}}.\r\n!project_with_default_repo.png|thumbnail!\r\n(i) From the list of Projects you'll see that your Project (e.g. Testing Project) does have a *Repository* now.\r\n# Access the Project, you'll see that all of the repositories associated to this Project are now hyperlinked.\r\n!repo_with_hyperlink.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nh3.

All of the repositories associated to your Project will now be hyperlinked.",

Summary\r\nIn CRUC-7262 we made a change that only the first line of a commit message is used as review title when review is created for a changeset.\r\n\r\nFor some use cases, e.g. for clients using SVN [bugtraq|https://tortoisesvn.net/docs/release/TortoiseSVN_en/tsvn-dug-bugtracker.html] issue tracking hooks, this might be non ideal, as the first line of a commit message contains only the issue key, and no meaningful text.\r\n\r\nh4. Have your say\r\nIt is yet unclear what solution we should apply.\r\nPlease vote on this issue if you'd like a change to the review title extraction mechanism. \r\nPlease comment on your specific use case.\r\n\r\nh4. Custom solution\r\nAs there might be no solution that would satisfy every use case, it might be feasible for users to write their own commit hook plugin to extend the off the shelf [Smart Commits|https://confluence.atlassian.com/fisheye/using-smart-commits-298976812.html].\r\nTo see an example of a plugin, see [Smart Commit Tutorial|https://developer.atlassian.com/fecrudev/tutorials/fisheye-smart-commit-tutorial].\r\nUse [ReviewService|https://docs.atlassian.com/fisheye-crucible/latest/javadoc/com/atlassian/crucible/spi/services/ReviewService.html] to create a review.\r\nIf you experience a difficulty writing your plugin, it's best to use [Atlassian Answers|https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/topics/754116/crucible-development] to post your question.",

      "description": "From discussion in CRUC-98:\r\n\r\n{quote}\r\nMichael Armstrong added a comment\r\nSo the implementation in version 4.2 seems to be lacking a state.  If Al make a comment and marks it as needing resolution.  Then Betty implements it and marks it as resolved.  When Al comes back in, if he doesn't like the resolution, he can reopen it, but what happens if he likes the resolution.  How does he indicate that he reviewed the change and likes it? Does he have to make a new comment?  Seems like another state of approved or verified or reviewed or some such would be useful.  \r\n\r\nMarek Parfianowicz added a comment \r\nHi Michael, thanks for your feedback.\r\nLet me ask a question:\r\nwhy Al can't just leave the comment as is (i.e. in the resolved state) if he likes the resolution?\r\nI'm asking because:\r\nnew commits added to a review are marked as unread, so you can easily find new content added\r\nnew comments as well as changes in the resolution state are marked as unread, so you can easily find them too\r\nSo:\r\n\"resolved\" + \"unread\" = fix waiting a review\r\n\"resolved\" + \"read\" = fix is approved\r\n\"resolved\" -switch to-> \"needs resolution\" = fix is rejected\r\n\r\nMichael Armstrong added a comment\r\nMaybe some of this is my background.  We are a company coming from a much more formal review processes, so I'm used to having a very positive action that lets a reviewer accept or reject an implementation.  \r\nThis issue I have with relying on the read or unread state of the comment is that the implementer can't see the reviewer's read/unread status.  The implementer has no way to know if the reviewer hasn't seen the implementation yet or saw it an approved it.  \r\n{quote}",

Summary\r\n\r\nThe \"Allowed review participants\" option in the project settings isn't restricting the scope for groups when searching for reviewers to be added to a review, therefore all the groups are listed, even the ones not included as allowed groups.\r\nh3. Environment\r\n * Tested on Crucible 4.2.0\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Have a few groups added to Crucible (e.g. *group1* and *group2*).\r\n # Edit the project settings, selecting only *group1* under *Allowed review participants*, then save the configuration.\r\n # Create a review and click in *Edit Details*.\r\n # Click on the *Reviewers* field.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n * Only group1 and its members will be shown.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n * Both group1 and group2 are listed.\r\n * The scope restriction still works for users. They also apply when only a specific group is set as an allowed reviewer, i.e. even though group1 and group2 are listed, only users from group1 are listed below the groups list.",
