When creating a new project, simply click the \"Create with shared configuration\" link in the bottom-left corner of the dialog, choose an existing project, and a new project will be creating that shares the same workflow scheme (and other schemes) of the existing project. [More documentation is available here|https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiraserver070/defining-a-project-749382822.html#Definingaproject-createCreatingaproject].\n\nWe recognize that this is not exactly the same as setting a workflow scheme as \"default\". Simplifying project setup, configuration, and maintenance is one of the JIRA team's top priorities right now. We are in the early stages of a big investment in making it easier to get started with a JIRA project and maintain a large number of projects at scale.\n\nWe will continue to work in this area and intend to provide more comprehensive support for this in the future.\n\nIt's important to understand that we rarely try to implement individual features from jira.atlassian.com, but instead take a holistic look at the problem and use feedback from the comments here and a [dozen other sources|https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/110373/how-does-the-jira-team-use-jira-atlassian-com] of customer input to solve the core problems.\n\nPlease don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or feedback.\n \nRegards,\nDave Meyer\ndmeyer@atlassian.com\nProduct Manager, JIRA Platform\n{panel}\n\nWe have set up a custom workflow scheme that we'd like to use on all new projects.\nWe need to specify that this custom scheme should be used by default for new projects -- without explicitly specifying it on Administer Project page.\n\nAlternative solution would be to have Workflow Scheme selector right at the Create Project screen, so that admins have a reminder that it should be specified in some way.\n",

This style is not WS-1 supported. A more popular style that is supported by many frameworks is the document/literal wrapped style WSDL. The only issue that may exist for us is that the document/literal wrapped style WSDL does not natively support overloaded methods, of which we use a ton. It may be the case that Axis handles this when generating the stubs, we need to find out. We also need to find out how, if at all, this will effect existing SOAP clients.

(todays date > due date). For this reason a new feature should be implemented:\n\n1a. Create a Switch in \"user preferences\" called \"highlight overdue issues\"\n1b. Create a switch on the search issue page, where you can dynamically switch highlighting on and off.\n2. Highlight every row in a filter result in \"light red\" , where the due date is yesterday or older\n3. Highlight every row in a filter result in \"yellow\", where the due date is today.\n4. Do not highlight anything else.\n\nWould be great to easily see, which tasks are overdue, and which tasks are still in time.\n\nMy guess: about 1-2 days of effort. What do you think?",

I'd rather just have them fill in the version as a string in a replacement var, and then be able to insert that into the jiraissues url path.  (If URI encoding is an issue, let it be an issue.

We highly value your feedback in all forms, and through suggestions in jira.atlassian.com is not different. We use this channel often to learn the best we can with how customers use JIRA and how we can continue to improve the experience for as many users as possible.\n\nWe have revisited this issue again recently and wanted to reiterate that there are still currently no plans to implement this suggestion, and it is not currently on any JIRA team\u2019s roadmap at this stage.\n\nPlease remember that jira.atlassian.com is one of many inputs for the JIRA roadmap. You can [learn more about our process here|https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/110373/how-does-the-jira-team-use-jira-atlassian-com].\n\nI understand that our decision may be disappointing. Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.\n\n\nRegards,\nKerrod Williams\nKerrod (dot) Williams (at) atlassian (dot) com\nProduct Manager, JIRA\n\n{panel}\n\n*Original request description*\n \nEnable a default value for the \"Comment Viewable By\" field.

I would like the permission model supports \"Reporter's Group\".  See the following examples will explain the reason why it is very helpful:\n\n1) We have several products, e.g Product1, Product2 ....\n     Each product has its own component, version & release note\n2) We support several dealers worldwide, e.g. Dealer1, Dealer2, ....\n    Each dealer is a \"User Group\" associating with a set of logins\n4) We have a central support team for all dealers\n5) However, it is critical that dealer should see ONLY his issues but not other dealers' issues\n\nSo, I will setup project like\n   Product 1 Support Area    (with all component, version, release note setup properly)\n   Product 2 Support Area\n   ....\n   However, the above cannot be achieved because there is no \"Reporter's Group\" permission for viewing the project \n\nBecause of the limitation, I need to create many project like:\n    Product 1 Support Area for Dealer 1\n    Product 1 Support Area for Dealer 2\n    ....\n    Product 2 Support Area for Dealer 1\n    Product 2 Support Area for Dealer 2\n    ....\n\nAnd I need to duplicate all component, version & release note info into many projects.  Also, the issue finder will be more difficult to use.\n\nIn fact, most IT companies have the similar workflow that they have several products & dealers .... but because of the sensivity of sales issues (some business deals cannot be seen by other dealers), all issues should be private to dealer group only.  I wish Jira will support this.  Many many thks.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The best that you can do (if you are an admin user) is call getUsers(Group) where group is the jira-users group.  It would be really handy if there were a service to get a list of all users in the system.  With this information it would be possible for remote clients to provide user lookup facilities and mappings between user id's and real names.\n\nHowever, I do understand that adding such a service opens the system up to abuse.  It would be trivial to write a client that could harvest a list of valid email addresses from the system.  Requiring the user to login before calling the service may help this a bit.\n\nHere is the RPC service code:\n\n{code:title=UserServiceImpl.java}\n    public RemoteUser[] getAllUsers()\n    {\n    \tCollection usersCollection = UserUtils.getAllUsers();\n    \tRemoteUser[] users = new RemoteUser[usersCollection.size()];\n    \t\n    \tint i = 0;\n    \tfor (Iterator iUsers = usersCollection.iterator(); iUsers.hasNext(); i++) {\n    \t\tusers[i] = new RemoteUser((User) iUsers.next());\n    \t}\n        return users;\n    }\n{code}",

It would seem logical (to me anyway, might just be my odd thoughts) that if you were closing the parent task, the sub tasks (hopefully) have been completed. It would therefore be useful to not have to then go through the rigmoral of closing each sub task manually afterwards.\n\nIf there's a way to do this through the workflow then that's great, but I didn't recall anything doing anything in as much detail as I'm looking for.\n\nThanks in advance, appologies if it's a dupe.",

Changes to the underlying scheme would take effect in all 'extending' schemes immediately.\n\n> More important, however, whould be the possibility to let a project \"inherit\" the permission scheme of its super project (if there is a super project) and to let a super project inherit the permission scheme of a project group (if there is such a group). So, we're actually looking for permission scheme inheritance in the project group/super project/subproject hierarchy.

Voting provides a useful way to capture quantitative feedback when your issues are public; however, it is not intended as a way for small development teams to prioritize their work.\n\n*We recognize that everyone uses JIRA differently*, and that not having this feature makes it more difficult for teams to implement a strict prioritization-by-voting process with JIRA. However, *our current focus* is on improving the usability and performance for teams planning using components, versions, backlogs and boards. In short, additional functionality for voting is not a priority for us for the foreseeable future.\n\nIf you have any questions, please email me. dmeyer@atlassian.com\n\nThanks,\nDave Meyer\nProdct Manager, JIRA Platform\n{panel}\n\nCurrently, it is not possible for a reporter to vote for their own issue. It would be nice to allow reporters to vote for their issue - perhaps make this optional.\n\nA use case would be:\n\n\"QA manager may log bugs but also be part of the committee that chooses bugs to be fixed via voting.\"",

Then I would have created a custom field called *\"Transition Time\"* and had it set to current date/time automatically during all transitions which I could easily perform a search on.

(You can see a number of improvements in JIRA 5.2 with screen editing). We have received a large amount of feedback on the need for simplification of the current project configuration in JIRA including the current screen editor, and we are focused on making the existing capabilities of managing fields and screens easier for new and existing customers to manage.\n\nGiven the large number of votes and compelling comments, we did not make this decision lightly or without taking all your comments into consideration. The decision to close a highly voted feature request is never an easy one.\n\nThanks for your patience and we hope you appreciate our open approach, even when we do not plan to solve a highly voted feature request.\n\nCheers,\n\nBryan\nJIRA Product Management\nbrollins at atlassian dot com\n\n{panel}\n\n*Original Description*\nthe user is JIRA-developer group which can have permission to schedule issue, check the assign issue screen that has due date with more other fileds. when assign an existed issue, only see 'Assign To', 'Update comment' and 'Comment viewable by', I don't see 'Due date'.",

However, I've found that within IE very little of the text changes size when changing from \"View>Text Size>Largest\" to \"View>Text Size>Smallest\". In particular, we like to use the printable view as it is the most compact, so it would be really great if that could resize cleanly.\n\nI believe that the problem is that the style sheet uses explicit pixel sizes such as: \"font-size: 11px\" in some situations. The JIRA design seems like it would scale up and down in font size very nicely so it really should use relative font sizes.\n\nI know that I can go tweak the stylesheets myself (although it is trickier than I'd hoped due to the dynamic style sheets defined in JSP). However, I think it would be a nice out-of-the-box feature to have this just work.",

Assign to reporter\n2. Create comment\n3. Update Issue Field\n\nWe would like to see \"Add sub-task\" added to this list.

If that is the case, it seems like it would be more appropriate to have a default read-only workflow scheme, that assigns all issues to the default workflow. Then instead of 'none' you would have a choice of 'Default System Workflow Scheme' and the other custom schemes. Otherwise it's confusing because workflows can't be assigned to projects, only workflow schemes can be assigned to projects.\n\nThe BIG problem here is that if I select 'none' for a project. The project doesn't show up on the 'Workflow Schemes' page. So I'm not aware that a workflow scheme has not been assigned. So either a default workflow scheme needs to be created, or projects with no workflow scheme should appear on the 'Workflow Schemes' page some other way.",

(could be specified in the service)\n# They can log on to Jira (they should be blocked)  I.e. They should have *Use* permisions but not *Log on* permissions.\n# They should receive Notifications without links back to the web pages. (Internal Users should still get the normal ones)\n# By default these users will receive Notifications made by themselves.  The default should be set to False.\n\n(That is all I can think of for now.....)",
