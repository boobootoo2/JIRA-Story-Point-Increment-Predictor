Problem Definition\r\nWhen you look at an issue's details in the mac app, estimations such as \"Time estimate\" and \"Original estimate\" are shown using different measures.  For example, if the issue was estimated in the backlog to take 1 hour (1h), the Time estimate will show exactly that.  However the 'Original Estimate' will instead just show 3600 (presumably the number of seconds in an hour).  However because there is no units show here, it isn't always as clear what 3600 value is supposed to be.\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\nStandardize these units of times across both fields.  If these values need to all be in seconds, then let's clarify that 3600 is the number of seconds estimated.\r\n\r\nh3. Why this is important\r\nConsistency and clarity in understanding.\r\n\r\nh3.

      "description": "Background:\r\n\r\nWe had Jira users working in our organization that used personal accounts to access our Jira because they were using other Jira's from other companies too.\r\n\r\nWe had domain verification in our Jira to validate who are our members and I think the domain verification was also related to some Bitbucket integration.\r\n\r\nWhat started to happen was that the none company email users were considered as not part of the managed organization. And because of that, there were some avatar issues.\u00a0\r\n\r\nSo there is at least one and potentially other difficulties for users who are part of an organization in Jira who have domain verification.\r\n\r\nThe current workarounds were to create a new Jira account with the company domain which makes users part of the organization, but that is not a solution for people who use different Jiras.\u00a0 Another workaround was specifically for avatars for organization members to make them public so that non-member with different emails can see it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSuggestion:\r\n\r\nBesides automatically managed members in a managed organization that is based on domain verification please add a way to manually add members as part of the organization. This is even useful when a company has multiple domains and it's really silyl requirement that all have emails from the same domain.\r\n\r\nI created a support ticket where we looked into this issue and where I was left with workarounds and so I'm creating a suggestion in the hope this becomes a new feature someday. The support ticket was\u00a0JST-565921 if it helps.",

Currently there are over 1,000 fields to choose from in the dropdown, many with the exact same name, and they are not listed in any discernible order (such as alphabetical).\r\nHere are my proposed solution options:\r\n1. PREFERRED - Add a prefix to each field in the list then sort them alphabetically.\r\n * If the field is not a custom field it could be prefixed with \"All Projects\" (example if the field is called \"Program\" it would display \"All Projects - Program\").\r\n\r\n * If the field is a custom field the prefix would be the originating project (example if the field is called \"Program\" and it was created in the \"VoltronPRJ\" project it would display as \"VoltronPRJ - Program\").\r\n2. If #1 is too complicated it would be helpful to at least have the entire list be sorted alphabetically. That way I can easily try each duplicate field, 1 by 1, until I get to the one I need.\r\nPlease let me know if you have any questions. Thanks!\r\n\r\n\u00a0",

If you try to click on the component just added, it shows an error, even if you have already saved the Rule's details configuration.\r\n\r\nThe problem happens when you try to create a new rule as also when you try to add a new component to an existing rule; editing an already existing component of an already existing rule seems to be working fine.\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Click on \"Create rule\" button - by default, it should redirect you to the trigger configuration, but now it shows the rule's detail screen\r\n # Add a title to your rule and click on \"Save and select trigger\"\r\n # Choose a trigger - you'll be again redirected to the rule's details instead of trigger's configuration\r\n\r\nh3.
