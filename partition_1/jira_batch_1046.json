While comparing we use a lowercase representation of both values. So we need to lowercase user input and value in the Database. We use different methods to do it due to which at times JQL gives different results. As a result, the JQL search thinks those are different options and returns incorrect results.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n*Replication* -\r\n * Create a custom field that contains an option like \"\u03a4\u039f\u039c\u0395\u0391\u03a3 Word1 Word2\"\r\n * Add this field and value to an issue\r\n * Apply basic search for this field and you will notice that looking for\u00a0\u03a4\u039f\u039c\u0395\u0391\u03a3 will not give any issues in return.\r\n * As soon as we remove the word from the value itself, the search starts working fine\r\n\r\nIn this example, the backend gives different results ({{\u03c4\u03bf\u03bc\u03b5\u03b1\u03c2}}\u00a0vs\u00a0{{\u03c4\u03bf\u03bc\u03b5\u03b1\u03c3}}).\r\n\r\n*Workaround* -\r\n\r\nNo workaround available\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0",

We have read your comments and recognise the problem this has caused.\r\nToday we have started rolling out the fix and we are planning to progressively roll it to the whole production with urgency.\u00a0\r\n \u00a0\r\nThanks for your patience and understanding.\r\n\r\nKamil Grinholc\r\nJIRA JQL Search team\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\nh3. Issue Summary\r\n\r\nSearching for some project scoped fields with IS EMPTY operator gives inaccurate results.\u00a0\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Have at least two custom fields with the same name (e.g. _Component_) and scope to different projects or between global and project scope (e.g. custom field 10000 scoped to project A and custom field 10001 scoped to project B)\r\n # Try to find issues from project A that don't have _Component_ field set\r\n\r\n{code:java}\r\nproject = A AND Component IS EMPTY\r\n{code}\r\nOR\r\n The issue is also experienced when only one custom field is present but a context is applied to limit the custom field to certain projects.\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nSearch checks value only of _Component_ field scoped to given issue (project).\r\n\r\nIn our example search should return issues from project A that don't have value in _Component_ field that is scoped to project A (custom field 10000). Issues from project A that don't have value in _Component_ field 10001 should be ignored as that custom field is scoped to project B.\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nSearch checks checks all _Component_ fields (ignores that some of them are not in project scope).\r\n\r\nIn our example search currently returns all issues from project A as they don't have value in _Component_ field that is scoped to project B (10001).\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nRefer in your JQL search to the custom field by id, ie:\r\n{code:java}\r\nproject = A AND cf[10000] IS EMPTY\r\n{code}\r\ninstead of\r\n{code:java}\r\nproject = A AND Component IS EMPTY\r\n{code}\r\nTo find id of custom field scoped to given project use\u00a0[GET /rest/api/3/field resource|https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/v3/api-group-issue-fields/#api-rest-api-3-field-get].",
