It's a request to fully rethink the keyboard shortcuts.\r\n\r\n*As a SourceTree user, I want to use simple-to-remember-and-trigger keyboard shortcuts so that I can work more quickly.*\r\n\r\nSince there are very few areas within SourceTree where you actually type text, why not go with simple single-key keyboard shortcuts for everyday actions? Less frequently used action can be hidden behind key combos.\r\n\r\nThese aren't fully baked but here's a subset of ideas mostly just to illustrate the concept.\r\n\r\n*Unstaged/stage files pane:*\r\n A = Add to index (or remove if in staged list \u2014 like SPACE now)\r\n R = Revert\r\n O = Open file\r\n D = External Diff\r\n I = Ignore\r\n U = Unstage?\r\n\r\n*Diff pane:*\r\n J = Previous Hunk\r\n K = Next Hunk\r\n A = Stage Hunk (or selected lines)\r\n D = Discard Hunk\r\n Or, better:\r\n R = Revert Hunk (and the button would be renamed)\r\n Which leaves D for External Diff. :)\r\n\r\n*Branch pane:*\r\n / = search for next (enable the current key based jumping. Bonus if it allowed longer strings like regular search)\r\n R = Rebase\r\n I = Interactive Rebase\r\n B = Create a new branch\r\n P = Push (with branch selected)\r\n M = Merge\r\n\r\n*Everywhere?*\r\n CTRL+arrow = switch panes (or alt or whatevs)\r\n C = Commit\r\n F = Fetch\r\n M = Merge\r\n P = Push\r\n CMD+P = Pull?\r\n S = Stash\r\n V = View in finder/explorer/...\r\n T = Open Terminal\r\n SPACE = Quicklook (on OSX anyway). Would include staging panes, etc.\r\n\r\nAgain, not married to the specific shortcuts\u2014only meant to illustrate the concept.

But i have to do this every time i launch this dialog. Even if i close and immediately open it again. I've compared this with my other MacBook and a MacBook of my colleague. Both installed SourceTree, having (almost) the same git-config. They do not have this problem. I removed and reinstalled SourceTree (even deleting files under ~/Library/Application Support) and it didn't solve the problem. After pressing 'refresh' remote branches are available for this moment. I also can see a loading spinner icon in the drop down menu when i open the pull dialog but there are not any results. Only after manually refreshing them.\r\n\r\nThe only difference between this Mac I'm having this issue and my second one is that I installed a plain SourceTree app on this one while I had the AppStore version installed on the second one before.\r\n\r\nThe last update didn't fix this issue. The issue occurs in every repository every time. It doesn't occur on the other Macs where the same repositories are used.\r\n\r\nIf necessary I can provide further details.",

It seems to be constantly hanging while talking to git and refreshing.\r\n\r\nOur repo is reasonably unique but I have seen this with other repositories in the past and it's an ongoing issue with sourcetree. More and more I'm returning to the command line to do stuff. e.g. stashing - It's just SO slow with sourcetree to stash, switch branch and then pop.\r\n\r\nI would love to see Sourcetree double down on becoming a lightning fast experience that is comparable to the command line, especially in complex situations which is where I need it most!\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nA bit about the current repo I am dealing with:We store a lot of pngs in the repo (for ui verification) but we chose not to bloat git itself with binaries, so we opted to use git-lfs for the storage of these. We store a number of other binaries that rarely change in the repository in the same way.
