JIRA should intelligently group changes made to an issue over a short period of time into a single notification.\n\nIdeally JIRA would attempt to notice when a user has left a page and know that it is safe to send those notifications immediately.  Otherwise a time limit would likely have to be used to determine when the user is \"done.\"  The time limit should be carefully balanced so as not to incur significant unnecessary delays in delivering the notification message.

This data causes the entire View Issue page not to load (and creates many exceptions in the logs).\n\nI think this could be resolved by putting a timeout on the renderer and, if it does time out, wrap the entire content of the issue in noformat tags and then ask the User to try the description again.\n\nOr something similar, at any rate the Renderer should not just run until it crashes.",

When importing the issues, the issue created will correctly be using the issue key specified in the CSV file, however this unfortunately will break the pcounter value in the project database. Hence as an outcome on this, the next issue created may be using the older value for issue key.\n\nSample steps to reproduce the problem:\n- Create a CSV file:\n{noformat}\nIssue Type, Issue Key, Summary, Description, Assignee, Reporter\nBug,PCSV-14,Subject1, Description 1, admin, admin\nBug,PCSV-31,Subject2, Description 2, admin, admin\nBug, PCSV-45, Subject 3, Description 3, admin, admin\nBug, PCSV-60, Subject 4, Description 4, admin, admin\n{noformat}\n- Import the CSV file to a new project\n- The import will run successfully, and issues created will be using the issue key specified (eg: PCSV-14, PCSV-31, etc)\n- However when we try to create a new issue, the issue key will be assigned to PCSV-5, which is incorrect. The expected next issue key should be PCSV-61. To check the pcounter value in database:\n{code:sql}\nselect pname, pkey, pcounter from project where pname=\"project name\";\n{code}\n\nWorkaround:\nupdate the pcounter value from the database:\n{code:sql}\nupdate project set pcounter=x where pname=\"project name\";\n{code}\n(i) where x is a new value for pcounter",

Having to open up each issue in my browser to determine its state is a huge waste of time (and leaves me with like 200 tabs open, cause I'm terrible at closing them).\n\nAlso, the label diffing is really confusing at times, because it's doing a text-based diff, and this diff can run across multiple labels.

Summary\n\nIf a clone operation fails during the create transition (such as when a validator on the Create transition stops the issue creation), JIRA adds a self-referencing link to the original issue (only if the Cloners link type is specified, of course).\n\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\n\n# Create a validator such as Required Field(s) using [JIRA Suite Utilities|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.googlecode.jira-suite-utilities] on the Create Issue Transition.\n# Setup an issue so that it does not have those requirements. For example, set the requirement to affects version, then remove the affects version from the issue.\n# Attempt to clone the issue.\n\nh3. Expected Results\n\nThe issue does not create a clone and notifies the user why.\n\nh3. Actual Results\n\nThe issue is not cloned, however an issue link is created to itself. Nothing notifies the user of failure.\n\nh3. Workaround\n\nFix the validator for that issue and then clone it. Using the above example that would mean adding an affects version.\n\nh3. Notes\nAfter some investigation, this appears to be caused by the following code in the _doExecute()_ method of the *CloneIssueDetails* class:\n\n{code:java}\n// Create link between the cloned issue and the original - sequence on links does not matter.\nfinal IssueLinkType cloneIssueLinkType = getCloneIssueLinkType();\nif (cloneIssueLinkType != null)\n{\n    issueLinkManager.createIssueLink(getOriginalIssue().getId(), getIssue().getLong(\"id\"), cloneIssueLinkType.getLong(\"id\"), null, getLoggedInUser());\n}\n{code}\n\nBy simply calling the _getOriginalIssue()_ and _getIssue()_ methods, there is a built-in assumption that the clone creation succeeded.  However, if the creation failed, these two methods will return the same issue (originalIssue is first set using the _getIssue()_ result).\n\nPlease add a check here that the clone creation actually succeeded, or at least that _getOriginalIssue()_ and _getIssue()_ are resulting in different and valid issues.",

Our customers are not very keen on browsing several release notes, when all they know is that their system was just upgraded from v1.1 to v1.2.5. They only want to read up on the delta change, which in this case would be a compilation of release 1.2, 1.2.1, 1.2.2, 1.2.3, 1.2.4 and 1.2.5.\n\nWell... for you to consider!\n\nCheers,\n--peter",

The new Link Issue functionality does not include this feature, nor the capability to use a JQL with the order-by argument.\n\n{quote}today I was paid a visit by a rather irate development manager. When linking issues, the \"Issue Selector\" screen is gone. When we linked issues in 4.3, there was a \"+\" sign next to the issues box, and this would take you to an \"Issue Selector\" screen. From there you could choose a filter. We had filters specifically set up for this, and used it frequently - we have a certain project that makes very heavy use of issue links.\nNow in 5.1, the \"+\" sign is gone and is replaced by a \"search for an issue\" link. It does not appear possible to simply specify a filter as it was in the past. This is problematic. The entry of a search is cumbersome and error prone. \nAll in all, something that used to be pretty easy turned into something that prompted a visit from an irate manager. I'm disappointed in a loss of functionality from one version to the next. {quote}",
