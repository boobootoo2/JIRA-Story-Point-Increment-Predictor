Problem Definition\nThe idea behind it is that for large enterprise with many different types of projects and workflows, I would like to avoid long lists of roles on the project administration page many of which are irrelevant for the project. The business reason behind this request is to better support large enterprise -wide Jira instances with many projects of different characteristics and workflows.\n\nh3. Suggested Solution\nRoles can be checked as 'global' to be visible in all projects, or unchecked as 'global' to be visible only in projects associated with schemes that use the role.\n\nDetailed steps:\nWhen adding or editing a Project role,\n!1_1.png|thumbnail!\nit should be possible to mark a role as \u2018Global\u2019 or not. When \u2018Global\u2019 is checked, the current Jira behavior is used: the role is listed on the Administration > Roles page of all projects on the Jira instance\n!2_2.png|thumbnail!\nWhen \u2019Global\u2019 is unchecked, the role is listed only on the Administration > Roles page of projects associated with the schemes that use the role, as viewable by the \u2018 View Usage\u2019 function.\n!3_3.png|thumbnail!",

Problem Definition\nWhen using JIRA's built-in reports, only Project Pivot Report has the ability to choose from \"additional fields\", a custom field that is a text field (single line).\n\nFor example, in the Pie Chart Report, we are limited to a certain type of field under Statistic Type. See https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRA-42249. \n\nh3. Suggested Solution\nAre there plans to expand the built-in reports to include more reports that have the opportunity to use a custom text field?\n\nIn our work flow, we create fill-in forms in SharePoint that passes the field\u2019s information through to JIRA. The SharePoint field is a drop down selection, control in SharePoint. It passes the text through to a JIRA text Field (single line).\n\nWe would like to include custom fields of all types in reporting options. Project Pivot Report is the only report we can find that does this. We know that we can create a filter and export to excel. To the average user, the built-in reports are very handy and visually pleasing to use. We also know that these fields will limitations, depending upon how the field is used in a report and what\u2019s in the field.",

Atlassian Connect 1.0 [was released in March 2014|http://blogs.atlassian.com/2014/03/introducing-atlassian-connect-1-0/], and you can already get access to [more than 50 public add-ons today built using the platform|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/search?application=&category=&cost=&hosting=cloud&marketingLabel=].\n \nDue to stability and scalability reasons, we will not bundle additional third party add-ons with our Cloud offerings. But you should feel free to contact the vendors of your favourite add-ons to let them know that you would like them to create a Cloud version of the add-on! We will do our best to work together with the vendor to satisfy this request.\n \nSince we have no plans to bundle additional add-ons in Cloud, we are closing this issue.\n \nCheers,\nBartek\nJIRA Product Management\nbartek (at) atlassian (dot) com\n{panel}\n \n \n*Original request description:*\nCustomers need the following plugin install to make their tasks easier:\n\nhttps://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.wittified.jira.project-creator\n\n",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-44817].\n  {panel}\n\nDave Meyer asked us to file the following suggestion regarding a new feature that was added to JIRA 7 EAP:\n\nIn the list of JIRA 7 EAP [platform changes|https://developer.atlassian.com/jiradev/latest-updates/preparing-for-jira-7-0/jira-7-0-platform-changes], the docs suggest that we will need to use a new BundleContext class in JIRA 7 onward.\n\nI have a question and a suggestion:\n\na) Is this change already published in JIRA 7.0.0-m01b? Our add-on is seemingly working on that version of JIRA without making any changes (and using the old BundleContext).\n\nb) Is there any way that JIRA 7 could continue to ship an shim interface corresponding to the old BundleContext (org.osgi.framework.BundleContext), and have that shimmed interface simply extend the new Eclipse BundleContext? It seems like this would permit add-ons to continue to list the old interface without any further difficulties.\n\nThis otherwise presents a significant binary compatibility problem for add-ons between JIRA 6 and 7. The current method used to get a BundleContext requires us to mark our own classes as implementors of the above interface\u2026but if we list the new class in our JAR, it won\u2019t load on JIRA 6 because the class doesn\u2019t exist. If we continue to list the old class, but JIRA 7 removes it, then our JAR won\u2019t load in JIRA 7. Although I haven\u2019t thought through all of the classloader specifics, I think the above solution would make this very easy on everybody.\n\nWe\u2019ve been able to resolve most issues like this through reflection, but we don\u2019t have that option here because it\u2019s related to the class inheritance, and it happens before our add-on gets control. Is there anything you can do?",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-44816].\n  {panel}\n\nDave Meyer asked us to file the following suggestion regarding a new feature that was added to JIRA 7 EAP:\n\nWhen our add-on (Dataplane) is running reports, JIRA regularly generates log warnings of the following format:\n\n{code}\n2015-08-12 16:38:50,758 http-nio-8087-exec-13 WARN scott 998x816x1 d3gpxw 0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1 /rest/dataplane/latest/report/15a9d22d-ff74-4af8-b20c-ecf5fd6c5d20/config.json [c.a.jira.ofbiz.ConnectionPoolHealthSqlInterceptor] Dangerous use of multiple connections: taken => count=3; marks=[3-3]; pool=3/20\n{code}\n\nThis new code appears to be issuing log statements whenever a single thread has more than a single database connection open. By its very nature, Dataplane needs to do this.\n\nIs there any way to make the warning threshold adjustable by us? We recognize that the warnings are there to alert the JIRA administrator that something may be going wrong and to prevent deadlocks, but in our case, we are using multiple connections deliberately.\n\nFor example, Dataplane takes great pains to be a careful user of JIRA database connections. Although a single Dataplane thread can certainly use multiple database connections, we never query the same tables that are used in other connections, and we also maintain our own \u201csub-pool\u201d of database connections to ensure that we never starve JIRA core of needed resources. (For example, Dataplane has its own internal high-water limit that prevents it from trying to use more than 1/3rd of the total JIRA dB connection pool at any time.)\n\nCould we get some sort of plugin-wide (or even ThreadLocal) setting that allows us to configure the warning threshold to a higher value to eliminate these warnings for our deliberate use? Although I see a way to increase the connection limit by +1 through some sort of strict-mode setting, one will not always be sufficient, and we also don\u2019t want to have to ask the user to make a JIRA properties change to make it work.",

Summary\nOn JIRA 7 when using the jira-misc-workflow-extensions 'Transition Parent issue', some transitions will fail if the parent transition cannot be completed\nh3. Environment\nJIRA 7\nPlugin: [JIRA Misc Workflow Extensions|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.innovalog.jmwe.jira-misc-workflow-extensions]\n\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\n# Create a workflow with the following post function: On Open to In Progress: \"Transition Parent with ID X\" (transition parent issue from open to in progress for example)\n# Create a Task and put it to the 'In Progress' Status\n# Create a subtask and transition it from Open to In Progress (the transition where you've configured the post function in step 1)\n\nh3. Expected Results\nIn JIRA 6.X the Sub Task transitions normally, an error will be logged but the transition completes.\n\nh3. Actual Results\nIn JIRA 7, the Parent Task can't be transition using the ID because that transition only applies to the Open status.\nSince the Parent Task can't be transitioned, the Sub Task now also fails to transition.\n{noformat}\n2015-08-04 10:31:09,435 ajp-nio-127.0.0.104-8009-exec-177 ERROR n06963 631x33611x2 27g572 160.67.51.136,131.103.27.33 /secure/WorkflowUIDispatcher.jspa [c.a.jira.workflow.OSWorkflowManager] Caught exception while attempting to perform action 4 from workflow 111781 on issue 'EX-1'\n@4000000055c078571a3be394 com.opensymphony.workflow.InvalidActionException: Action 4 is invalid\n@4000000055c078571a3be394       at com.opensymphony.workflow.AbstractWorkflow.doAction(AbstractWorkflow.java:559)\n@4000000055c078571a3c0aa4       at com.atlassian.jira.workflow.OSWorkflowManager.doWorkflowActionInsideTxn(OSWorkflowManager.java:995)\n@4000000055c078571a3c0e8c       at com.atlassian.jira.workflow.OSWorkflowManager.doWorkflowAction(OSWorkflowManager.java:947)\n@4000000055c078571a3c0e8c       at com.atlassian.jira.workflow.WorkflowTransitionUtilImpl.progress(WorkflowTransitionUtilImpl.java:417)\n@4000000055c078571a3c1274       at com.innovalog.jmwe.plugins.functions.TransitionParentIssueFunction.executeFunction(TransitionParentIssueFunction.java:78)\n@4000000055c078571a3c1a44       at com.innovalog.jmwe.plugins.functions.AbstractPreserveChangesPostFunction.execute(AbstractPreserveChangesPostFunction.java:123)\n@4000000055c078571a3c1a44       at com.opensymphony.workflow.AbstractWorkflow.executeFunction(AbstractWorkflow.java:1050)\n@4000000055c078571a3c29e4       at com.opensymphony.workflow.AbstractWorkflow.transitionWorkflow(AbstractWorkflow.java:1446)\n@4000000055c078571a3c29e4       at com.opensymphony.workflow.AbstractWorkflow.doAction(AbstractWorkflow.java:564)\n@4000000055c078571a3c2dcc       at com.atlassian.jira.workflow.OSWorkflowManager.doWorkflowActionInsideTxn(OSWorkflowManager.java:995)\n@4000000055c078571a3c31b4       at com.atlassian.jira.workflow.OSWorkflowManager.doWorkflowAction(OSWorkflowManager.java:947)\n@4000000055c078571a3c359c       at com.atlassian.jira.bc.issue.DefaultIssueService.transition(DefaultIssueService.java:500)\n@4000000055c078571a3c3984       at com.atlassian.jira.web.action.workflow.SimpleWorkflowAction.doExecute(SimpleWorkflowAction.java:32)\n@4000000055c078571a3c3984       ... 1 filtered\n@4000000055c078571a3c3d6c       at com.atlassian.jira.action.JiraActionSupport.execute(JiraActionSupport.java:67)\n@4000000055c078571a3c4154       ... 7 filtered\n@4000000055c078571a3c4154       at javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet.service(HttpServlet.java:725)\n@4000000055c078571a3c453c       ... 50 filtered\n...\n@4000000055c078572c0d90a4 2015-08-04 10:31:09,729 ajp-nio-127.0.0.104-8009-exec-177 ERROR n06963 631x33611x2 27g572 160.67.51.136,131.103.27.33 /secure/WorkflowUIDispatcher.jspa [c.a.jira.transaction.TransactionSupportImpl] Unable to commit transaction : Commit failed, rollback previously requested by nested transaction.\n@4000000055c078572c0da044 org.ofbiz.core.entity.GenericTransactionException: Commit failed, rollback previously requested by nested transaction.\n@4000000055c078572c0da42c       at org.ofbiz.core.entity.TransactionUtil.commitLocalTransaction(TransactionUtil.java:342)\n@4000000055c078572c0dc754       at com.atlassian.core.ofbiz.util.CoreTransactionUtil.commit(CoreTransactionUtil.java:46)\n@4000000055c078572c0dcb3c       at com.atlassian.jira.transaction.TransactionSupportImpl$TransactionImpl.commit(TransactionSupportImpl.java:94)\n@4000000055c078572c0dd30c       at com.atlassian.jira.workflow.OSWorkflowManager.doWorkflowActionInsideTxn(OSWorkflowManager.java:1012)\n@4000000055c078572c0dd6f4       at com.atlassian.jira.workflow.OSWorkflowManager.doWorkflowAction(OSWorkflowManager.java:947)\n@4000000055c078572c0df634       at com.atlassian.jira.bc.issue.DefaultIssueService.transition(DefaultIssueService.java:500)\n@4000000055c078572c0dfa1c       at com.atlassian.jira.web.action.workflow.SimpleWorkflowAction.doExecute(SimpleWorkflowAction.java:32)\n@4000000055c078572c0e0da4       ... 1 filtered\n@4000000055c078572c0e118c       at com.atlassian.jira.action.JiraActionSupport.execute(JiraActionSupport.java:67)\n@4000000055c078572c0e1574       ... 7 filtered\n@4000000055c078572c0e1574       at javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet\n{noformat}\n \nh3.
