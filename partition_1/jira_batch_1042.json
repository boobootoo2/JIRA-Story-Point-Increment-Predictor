The following sort options could be available to you, based on your specific project setup:\r\n * Created (most recent first)\r\n\r\n * Key (alphabetically then numerically)\r\n\r\n * Priority (same order specified in the global admin - only available when the \u201cparent issue\u201d also has the priority field visible)\r\n\r\n * Status (first by status category - to do, in progress, then done - and then alphabetically\r\n\r\n * Assignee (alphabetically then unassigned)\r\n\r\n * Default (current order, \u201cranking\u201d - for example, what was set in a board)\r\n\r\n*Atlassian Product Team*\r\n{panel}\r\n{panel:bgColor=#e7f4fa}\r\n*NOTE:* This suggestion is for *JIRA Cloud*. Using *JIRA Server*? [See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-40929].\r\n{panel}\r\nToday we don't have the ability to reorder the Issues in Epic when viewing a ticket.\r\n It would be great if we can rank them like we do with the Sub-Tasks (see attached).\r\n\r\nAlso, it would be helpful to have a header column to the \"Issues in this epic\" section of an epic where the users could sort by issue key, ID, or summary",

If the permission has roles or groups in it, then you need to go and look at each role (People's section of Project settings) and group (User management, only available for site admins). \r\n\r\nAdditional to this, you can go and check a permission scheme, and see permission by permission, but it is not possible to search for permissions related to a specific group, role or user.\r\n\r\nFor Team managed projects, since they are self contained, the only way to see about access is to look in the project itself.\r\n\r\nThe request is to provide a product level report where a Jira administrator can see all the information needed for an administrator to have a full view of what is the current permission status, showing information like:\r\nProject, Type of project, Permission, User, How they get this permission (directly, through a group, a role, etc.). \r\n\r\nThe idea is to be able to generate the report with different combinations:\r\n* For all projects/a specific project\r\n* For a specific group (which would bring all the users that have permission through that group)/ specific role/specific user .\r\n\r\nThis would bring all the visibility an admin would require to know exactly who has access and to what, as well as being useful for audits in addition to be really helpful now that the Permission helper is not available in the new issue view.\r\n\r\nOne last thing is that ideally this information should be exportable as well.",

      "description": "h3. Issue Summary\r\n\r\nThe edit meta cache used by automation rules to edit fields in an issue is not invalidated (even with re-fetch action) causing automation rule to fail (in some cases).\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Create a custom field \"Field A\" with field context limited to \"Issue type A\"\r\n# Create an automation rule wherein issue was initially in \"Issue type B\" and was changed to \"Issue type A\" via Edit issue action. \r\n# Then using another Edit issue action, try to edit the field \"Field A\". Note that \"Field A\" has context set only to \"Issue type A\" and not \"Issue type B\".\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nField A is correctly updated  (the edit meta cache is invalidated with Re-fetch action component) \r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nAn error message is returned, saying that \"Field A\" is not in the Issue Edit screen for \"Issue Type A\", even if it actually is. \r\n\r\nThis is because, even though the issue type was changed from B to A and the \"Re-fetch issue\" action component is used, the edit issue action still relies on the data returned when running by /rest/api/2/issue/<issuekey>/editmeta to determine fields that are editable against \"Issue Type B\". The edit meta cache is not invalidated when changing issue type, and hence the attempt to update the field fails.\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\nCurrently there is no known workaround for this behavior. A workaround will be added here when available",
