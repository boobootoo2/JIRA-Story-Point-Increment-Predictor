      "description": "h3. Description\r\nWhen importing issues to a *classic project* using CSV files, Jira may add an invalid issue type to the issue type scheme if *next-gen projects* exist\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to reproduce\r\n# Create a classic project\r\n# Create a Next-Gen project\r\n** *I.E.* the *Epic* issue type exists in both the Classic and Next-Gen projects. One of them, however, is only applicable for the *next-gen* project\r\n# Create a simple CSV file that defines issues and their issue types, as exemplified below\r\n{quote}\r\nsummary,issuetype\r\nTeste Epic Bug,Epic\r\nTeste Story,Story\r\n{quote}\r\n# Go to *Jira Settings > System > External System Import*\r\n# Select CSV\r\n# Upload the file, select a *Classic project* as the destination project and follow the prompts\r\n\r\nh3. Expected result:\r\nIssues are imported using the correct issue types\r\n\r\nh3. Actual results:\r\nA Next-Gen *Epic* issue type is added to the issue type scheme, causing the following message to be presented:\r\n !Screen Shot 2019-02-26 at 4.52.08 PM.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\nThis may cause issues to be imported using the wrong issue type.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround:\r\nAn existing workaround is to import the CSV file using the issue type's *IDs* instead of their \"Names\". This can be gathered by going to *Jira Settings > Issues > Issue Types* and click *Edit* next to the issue type. The ID will be displayed on the *URL*\r\n * Example : https://<instance>.atlassian.net/secure/admin/EditIssueType!default.jspa?id=<ID>\r\n\r\nh3. (!) Fixing the problem:\r\nIf a CSV file *has already been imported* and the problem represented by the image below exists, please contact [Atlassian support|https://support.atlassian.com/contact]\r\n*  !Screen Shot 2019-02-26 at 4.52.08 PM.png|thumbnail!
