This behaviour is intentional and we\u2019ll be closing this ticket, but let me give additional context.\r\n\r\nNote we have two different versions of the Jira API:\r\n * *Version 3:* This is the latest version but is in\u00a0{*}beta{*}.\u00a0[Version 2|https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/v2/]\u00a0and [version 3|https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/v3/intro/] of the API offer the same collection of operations. However, version 3 provides support for the\u00a0[Atlassian Document Format|https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/apis/document/structure/]\u00a0(ADF) for rich text fields.\r\n\r\n * {*}Version 2{*}: This API supports _wikimarkup_ for text formatting and can be found [here|https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/v2/]. This version of the API continues to be supported and offers the full functionality of v3, simply the syntax for text formatting differs.\r\n\r\n * While we do support on the fly conversion of markdown in the Jira user interface, neither API supports _markdown_ via the REST API.\r\n\r\nYour options:\r\n * You may continue to use [v2 of the API|https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/v2/api-group-issue-comments/#api-rest-api-2-issue-issueidorkey-comment-post] along with [wikimarkup syntax|https://jira.atlassian.com/secure/WikiRendererHelpAction.jspa?section=all].\r\n\r\n * If you\u2019d like to use v3 along with ADF, we offer the following tools to help:\r\n\r\n ** Documentation for the [ADF format|https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/apis/document/structure/].\r\n\r\n ** The [ADF Schema|http://go.atlassian.com/adf-json-schema] can be can be used to validate ADF documents.\r\n\r\n ** The [ADF Builder|https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/apis/document/playground/] which provides an editor which shows the corresponding ADF.\r\n\r\n ** [ADF Utils|https://atlaskit.atlassian.com/packages/editor/adf-utils] is an {{npm}} module which provides a set of utilities to traverse, modify and create ADF documents.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019ve created a ticket to track adding support for wikimarkup/ADF in the v3 api which you can follow here: [https://ecosystem.atlassian.net/browse/ACJIRA-2499].\r\n\r\n\u2014 Phil Oye, Group Product Manager, Atlassian\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\nh3.

      "description": "|*Atlassian Update - 27 May 2021*|\r\n|Hi everyone,\r\n This has now been fixed for message custom fields (for view) - these now appear as read only in the new issue view and reflect markdown input. As noted in this ticket, there is no longer an edit screen in the new issue view, so the message custom field (for edit) is no longer available on this screen.\u00a0\r\n \u00a0\r\n Thanks,\r\n The Atlassian Cloud team|\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\nh3. Summary\r\n\r\nWhen using the read-only\u00a0*Message Custom Field (for edit)* and the *Message Custom Field (for view)* fields provided by the *JIRA Toolkit Plugin* which are designed to only display on either the view or edit screens and allow markdown inputs via the fields by default, and you switch to the new issue view the fields both become visible, and editable in the layout configurations and no longer render correctly as view and edit screens are now combined and the view uses a new editor not compatible with the markdown. however while the fields become editable the modifications are temporary and the fields will reset to the default values on a page reload if changed.\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # With new issue view disabled\r\n # Add *Message Custom Field (for edit)* and the *Message Custom Field (for view)* to a screen used by both view issue and edit issue screens per the projects screen scheme\r\n # Set defaults for the fields and add markdown to the text\r\n # View the issue Note only *Message Custom Field (for view)* is visible markdown is rendered correctly\r\n # Edit the issue Note that only *Message Custom Field (for edit)* is visible markdown is rendered correctly\r\n # enable new issue view\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nWhen viewing the issue only *Message Custom Field (for view)* is visible and markdown is rendered correctly, and *Message Custom Field (for edit)* is no longer available as there is no longer an edit screen\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nBoth fields are visible and markdown is rendered as plain text, the read-only values can be edited\r\nh3. Notes\r\n\r\nWhile the fields are editable in the new view the changes will reset to the default value on page refresh causing confusion as to why the value is changing\r\n It has been mentioned that the new issue view does not support Markup but supports markdown. After testing Markdown, this does not work either in this type of field.\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nThere is no current work around",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-69326].\r\n  {panel}\r\n\r\nh3. Problem\r\n\r\nWhen working in Jira, a project avatar is one common way that admins will customize to help users quickly sort through to identify what project they are working in. When you then have to switch applications to Confluence or alike, there is no means to automatically use the same custom avatar icon for that linked space. This can cause confusion or delays until users can be sure they are working in the correct space/project\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nIt would be awesome if when you link a Jira Project to a Confluence space, if Jira would prompt you to sync the avatar between these two. Granted, it would be understood that the user creating this link would need to have admin rights in both applications likely, and there might be a question of which avatar to use when initiating the sync. However to be able to do this automatically for admins would be really helpful in making it very clear to end users which content is linked to what other content.\r\nh3. Note:\r\n\r\nThis suggestion does not seek to sync avatars of user objects.\u00a0 Just that between spaces and projects.",

Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Create an integrated system that operates in Jira \r\n# Do several work logs operations such as adding work logs to the same issue\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nThe time spent of the issue (shown as logged in time tracking panel) equals the sum of all existing work logs.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nBecause the time spent is stored separately and there isn't a control of parallel changes in that, it may not be equal to the sum of work logged.\r\n \r\nh3. Notes\r\nWe carried out 2 tests:\r\n# A script run twice sequentially (waiting for first run to finish to start another one) where we add 60 seconds of work logs 100 times\r\n# Same as above, but both are run at the same time in parallel\r\n\r\nIn both cases we expected 12000 seconds of time spent on that issue and that is what we got in the first test, but we got 9840 on the second as in some cases, the creation of a work log interfered with another running at the same time.\r\n\r\nh3.Workaround\r\nNo perfect workaround, but avoiding running 2 work logs operations in the same issue prevents this problem.",
