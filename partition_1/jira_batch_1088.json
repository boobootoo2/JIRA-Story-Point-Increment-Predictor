      "description": "{panel:title=Atlassian Update on June 11th}\r\nHi everyone, thanks again for the interest on this ticket. We\u2019re marking this ticket as closed now because a workaround has been released to solve the issue of \"users always being forced into the American format of mm/dd/yyyy\" by allowing each user to format their dates and times on the new issue view based on their language preferences. For many of you, this workaround solved the problem.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n*Cross-post May 24th update on workaround*\r\n * Users can now change the\u00a0*{color:#00875a}default edit and display of both date and date/time fields{color}*,{color:#00875a}\u00a0*using their language/locale setup (i.e. \"en_AUS\" or \"Dutch\")*{color}\u00a0instead of being forced into the American month/day/year display only. Here\u2019s how to setup yours:\u00a0[https://support.atlassian.com/atlassian-account/docs/manage-your-language-preferences/].\r\n * For those using language not supported (i.e. Greek). We suggest you choose UK English as your preference to get the desired display of day/month/year.\r\n\r\nFor those customers that still face challenges with this solution we have opened a new ticket where we will gather interest specifically on when the user level language based settings is not a viable solution.

To better adapt our product to this, we\u2019ll progressively roll-out the following changes in upcoming days.\r\n * Users can now change the\u00a0*default edit and display of both date and date/time fields*,\u00a0*using their language/locale setup (i.e. \"en_AUS\" or \"Dutch\")*\u00a0instead of being forced into the American month/day/year display only. Here\u2019s how to setup yours:\u00a0[https://support.atlassian.com/atlassian-account/docs/manage-your-language-preferences/]. For those using language not supported (i.e. Greek). We suggest you choose UK English as your preference to get the desired display of day/month/year.\r\n\r\n * As part of shifting such setting to the user level, in long term, we\u2019ll remove the advanced admin setting of custom date/time format (which currently can be found under: System->User Interface->Look and feel->Date/time format). In the interim, warning message of \u201cadvanced date picker settings will no longer be supported\u201d will appear.{panel}\r\nh3. \u00a0\r\nh3. Summary\r\n\r\nWhen a custom date/time format has been configured and Jira is configured to use the new issue view, the custom date/time format is ignored and Jira displays the default date/time format.\r\nh3. Environment\r\n * Jira Core\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Configure a custom date/time format as shown [here|https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiracloud/configuring-the-look-and-feel-of-your-jira-applications-780861527.html]\r\n # Navigate to an issue or select an issue from a board\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n * Custom date/time formats are displayed in the board/full issue views\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n * The default Jira date/time format is still displayed\r\n * Look and feel settings:\r\n\r\n||Old view||New view||\r\n|!Screen Shot 2019-01-03 at 01.25.19.png|thumbnail!|!Screen Shot 2019-01-03 at 01.26.06.png|thumbnail!|\r\nh3. Notes\r\n * This issue doesn't occur in the old/existing issue view/board view\r\n * On Jira Core(Business) projects, there isn't an option to turn off the new issue view\r\n\r\nh3.

Workaround\r\nIn order for the import to succeed we can't have any next-gen project on the source Jira. One would need to create a new classic project and move the issues from the next-gen project to the classic project and then delete the next-gen project and generate a new backup. There are options to do so in the Backup Manager page for generating a backup for Jira Server, and we can use those and then generate a backup for Cloud.\r\n* [Migrate between next\\-gen and classic projects|https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirasoftwarecloud/migrate-from-an-agility-project-to-a-classic-project-957974933.html]",
