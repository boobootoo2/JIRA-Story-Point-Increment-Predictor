Notes ([~iragudo])\r\n * In the Jira issue view the sprint information for sub-task is displayed (see sub-task.png), but in REST API response there isn't this information (sub-task.json). For the parent issue, the sprint information is returned in REST API (parent.json)\r\n * Expanding {{versionedRepresentations}} in a Get issue call for erroneous sub-tasks shows that item 1 is null and item 2 is correct.\r\n * So far this is consistent in some instances only. I've tried in a newer instance and I cannot replicate the issue.\r\n * Using the JSW Cloud's Get issue REST API also behaves the same i.e. null value for sprint custom field which makes me think that the error happens when the sprint information is being inherited by the sub-tasks.\r\n * -This JSW Cloud issue seems related JSWCLOUD-15530-",
