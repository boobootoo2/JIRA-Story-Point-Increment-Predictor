In simple diff tools, these changes are frequently annotated as deletes and adds (or confoundingly with the intervening code marked up as added and deleted), but they can be shown as moved-from and moved-to instead. Showing them with this extra info would help reviewers ignore the code (if they trust the existing code), or to find where it got to (if they've found an existing bug and are checking if it got fixed). In the browser, these code motion annotations could be hyperlink anchors within the file to make it easy to jump to and from the old and new locations.\n\nImplementing this in the surrounding tools such as blame would also help track down the code long after any refactoring happened.",

      "description": "I'm trying to get UPM working in Fisheye and running into some roadblocks.  When starting up Fisheye 2.3.2 everything seemed to be going fine, but Fisheye appeared to \"hang\" on startup.  It still appeared to be active, so there weren't any deadlocks.  I then cranked up the debugging and found these messages when UPM is being enabled.\r\n\r\n{code}\r\n2010-06-10 11:04:36,104 DEBUG [main] felix.FelixOsgiContainerManager FelixLoggerBridge-doLog - Constraint violation for 48.0 detected; module can see javax.xml.bind.annotation from [0] and javax.xml.bind.annotation from [0]\r\n2010-06-10 11:04:36,106 DEBUG [main] felix.FelixOsgiContainerManager FelixLoggerBridge-doLog - Constraint violation for 48.0 detected; module can see javax.xml.bind.annotation from [0] and javax.xml.bind.annotation from [0]\r\n2010-06-10 11:04:36,108 DEBUG [main] felix.FelixOsgiContainerManager FelixLoggerBridge-doLog - Constraint violation for 48.0 detected; module can see javax.xml.bind.annotation from [0] and javax.xml.bind.annotation from [0]\r\n2010-06-10 11:04:36,111 DEBUG [main] felix.FelixOsgiContainerManager FelixLoggerBridge-doLog - Constraint violation for 48.0 detected; module can see javax.xml.bind.annotation from [0] and javax.xml.bind.annotation from [0]\r\n2010-06-10 11:04:36,113 DEBUG [main] felix.FelixOsgiContainerManager FelixLoggerBridge-doLog - Constraint violation for 48.0 detected; module can see com.atlassian.sal.api.message from [33.0] and com.atlassian.sal.api.message from [13.0]\r\n2010-06-10 11:04:36,115 DEBUG [main] felix.FelixOsgiContainerManager FelixLoggerBridge-doLog - Constraint violation for 48.0 detected; module can see com.atlassian.sal.api.message from [33.0] and com.atlassian.sal.api.message from [13.0]\r\n2010-06-10 11:04:36,117 DEBUG [main] felix.FelixOsgiContainerManager FelixLoggerBridge-doLog - Constraint violation for 48.0 detected; module can see com.atlassian.sal.api.message from [33.0] and com.atlassian.sal.api.message from [13.0]\r\n2010-06-10 11:04:36,119 DEBUG [main] felix.FelixOsgiContainerManager FelixLoggerBridge-doLog - Constraint violation for 48.0 detected; module can see com.atlassian.sal.api.message from [33.0] and com.atlassian.sal.api.message from [13.0]\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nThat repeats over and over in an infinite loop until Fisheye is killed.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure wtf is going on with the javax.xml.bind.annotation violation.  I do see in FisheyePluginManagerFactory that you export javax.* from the system classloader, but that should be fine afaik.  Why it's complaining that it's finding the same package exported from the same bundle - the system bundle, in this case - I really don't understand.  Unless that is conflicting with something hardcoded in the plugins system.\r\n\r\nThe second set of messages, about com.atlassian.sal.api.message being available from 2 bundles is more disturbing.  I did some looking and the sal-api packages do, in fact, appear in 2 places in Fisheye: 1) the sal-api jar is a bundled plugin, and 2) the sal-api jar is bundled in the META-INF/lib directory of the sal-fisheye-plugin.  The first packaging, as a bundled plugin, is correct.  The second one will cause all kinds of problems as the implementation in the sal-fisheye-plugin will use it's internal packages.  To avoid this problem, it appears the sal-fisheye-plugin also exports the sal-api packages, but it does this without any versioning.  I think this is the cause of the problem that I am seeing.\r\n\r\nI would recommend one of 2 approaches here: 1) Don't package the sal-api jar in the sal-fisheye-plugin, or 2) if you want to bundle the sal-api jar in the sal-fisheye-plugin to avoid the extra bundle, get rid of the sal-api jar as a bundled plugin and make sure to fix the sal-fisheye-plugin manifest to export the sal-api packages with proper versioning.\r\n",

I have tried setting up the repository so I put the include in after the branch is created however even if I restart the repository Fisheye will not pick up this new branch. The only way it seems to work is that if I create the include first, then restart and then branch. However the latter does not give us any benefit.\n\nWe would like to branch the code in Perforce, then setup the include during off hours and run the index for just that one branch.  Currently it seems like when you rescan changelists it only does the metadata and not the content.

      "description": "We're using Studio and have been trialling the Fisheye integration to browse SVN repositories. There are a few issues we've run into (I've already raised these as support questions). I'm not really sure if these are Fisheye or just specifically Studio issues.\r\n\r\n\r\n*1. Single repository*\r\nAll of the projects in studio are in a single repository, which causes various weird things to occur, such as version numbers that jump around (the head version is for the last checkin of any project, rather than the project you are working on). I'm also not sure if you can do a partial dump (of directories rather than version numbers) - if you can't it would also mean that it is pretty hard to get any svn data back out once it is in. Which would suck.\r\n\r\n*2. External repos*\r\nAnother issue has been an inability to have external repos (again - this might be just studio). It would be really nice to allow an external SVN. The actual Contegix hosting of studio has been great, but the SVN part is not so great:\r\n* any changes or imports need to get done remotely, and these take about a day to actually get done\r\n* the speed is very slow - our developers access our SVN now at 800-1000k/s, while the Contegix SVN is typically 100k/s. Webdav is even slower at about 5-10k/s\r\n\r\n\r\nPerhaps these items were left out in order to ship Studio, but it would be much appreciated if we could get them added in.",
