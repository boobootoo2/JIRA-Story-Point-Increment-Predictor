The user can create an issue and fill in the authors, title, abstract, license of the academic article and submit the supplementary data to us using JIRA. The JIRA issue is used to track the changes and workflows of the data submission. Often this information can be partly prepopulated on issue creation from e.g. an article citation, library catalogues,... This is especially relevant for invoking CreateIssue.jspa from a library catalogue and just wants to add data to the article at our place. In this case, lots of information on the Create Issue page can be pre-populated, but the user should be able to modify and complete the information.\n\nWe have seen the confluence page about creating an issue with all fields filled out, but in that case we want to probvide the user the standard create issue form (where he can edit/enter the details) before creating the issue. Just a few fields should be prepopulated.\n\nThis should be easily possible by modifying the JSP page to simply pre-populate the value=\"\" of the <input> fields based on the URL parameters.",

This will give a window to recover if projects were accidentally deleted. Projects can also be permanently deleted manually before the 60-day window expires.\r\n\r\nYou can learn more about the feature at\u00a0[https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiracloud/trash-for-jira-software-and-jira-core-projects-1001820064.html]\u00a0\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n Ritesh Ranjan\r\n Product Manager, JIRA Platform\r\n\u00a0\r\n{panel}\r\nWhen users inadvertently delete issue(s), getting them back is a royal PITA. Ie database restore, import into new instance etc, copy across somehow.\r\n\r\nWould be nice if deleted issues could be moved to a per-project recycle bin, as per confluence. That way if you needed to get them out they'd still have the same ID.\r\n\r\nBTW - I am aware of workarounds involving a Delete workflow action and issue security schemes, but I don't think that cuts it.",

Therefore the \"Subject:\" email header line will be split in such a way that the data section will start prematurely.\n\nHere is a script to create a sample issue:\n\n{code:none}\n#!/usr/bin/env ruby\nrequire 'rubygems'\ngem 'soap4r'\nrequire 'soap/wsdlDriver'\n\nsoap = SOAP::WSDLDriverFactory.new('http://localhost:8080/rpc/soap/jirasoapservice-v2?wsdl').create_rpc_driver\ntoken = soap.login('admin', 'password')\nissue_map = {\n  :type => \"1\",\n  :project => \"TST\",\n  :summary => \"This test issue has a newline\\nafter the first occurrence of the word 'newline'\",\n  :description => \"This is the description.\",\n  :assignee => \"admin\"\n  };\nissue = soap.createIssue(token, issue_map);\n{code}\n\nThe resulting email has the subject \"[JIRA] Created: (TST-4) This test issue has a newline\" and the body looks like:\n\n{noformat}\nafter the\nfirst occurrence of the word 'newline'\nMIME-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nPrecedence: bulk\nAuto-Submitted: auto-generated\nX-JIRA-FingerPrint: dee9d5d26e4e05c908d4fd9475e805a2\n\n<html>\n<head>\n   <!--\n   You are receiving this email because you have chosen HTML as your email preference.\n   ...\n{noformat}\n\nThis is because the headers contain the following:\n\n{noformat}From: \"Admin (JIRA)\" <mknight@atlassian.com>\nTo: mknight@atlassian.com\nMessage-ID: <2135917781.11.1295508323968.JavaMail.mknight@kitt.sydney.atlassian.com>\nSubject: [JIRA] Created: (TST-4) This test issue has a newline\n\nafter the\n first occurrence of the word 'newline'\nMIME-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nPrecedence: bulk\nAuto-Submitted: auto-generated\nX-JIRA-FingerPrint: dee9d5d26e4e05c908d4fd9475e805a2\n\n<html>\n<head>\n    <!--\n    You are receiving this email because you have chosen HTML as your email preference.\n    ...\n{noformat}\n\nThe example here shows HTML emails, which are significantly affected because the HTML will not be rendered.

Summary\nEmail Filter Subscriptions are still sent after an user is marked as deactivated.\n\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\n# Create an user belonging to jira-users group\n# Deactivate the user\n# Create a filter and subscribed to jira-users group\n#* Filter used: issuekey in issueHistory() ORDER BY lastViewed DESC\n#* Ticked the option to still send an email even there's no issue found.\n\n\nh3. Expected Results\nJIRA would send subscriptions only to active users.\n\nh3. Actual Results\nAll users belonging to the jira-users group receive the filter subscription email, regardless of being deactivated.\n\nh3. Notes\nThis happens both when deactivating the user by unchecking the 'Active' checkbox in the user edit screen, or removing the user from all groups.\n\nh3.

Each link is put together by combining a path fragment with a prefix and suffix. The utility class allows for exactly one prefix+suffix pair. This means we can't use it in Studio, because we need to point users to entirely different sites depending on whether they are in Studio mode vs JIRA Standalone mode.\n\nWould it be possible to make this more flexible? I think a simple solution could be to make defaultHelpPath and helpPaths instance fields rather than static, so that multiple instances of HelpUtil can be created for different .properties files (I can't see why those fields need to be static).",

We did this by doing the following:  As an admin user, bring up the Jira GUI and go to Administration -> Global Settings -> General Configuration, and edit the \"Email from\" field. Give it the value: JIRA (${fullname}) .\n\nThis works great on Outlook 2007 that I run on my Windows XP host and in the native mail tool on my Mac OS 10.6 machine. However, with Mac Outlook 2011 on Mac OS 10.6, I only see \"JIRA\" in the From: field without the Jira user name. Those are getting stripped out.\n\nWould be great to find a way to fix this. Really painful to go through the Jira emails without the Jira user name being displayed.\n",

The story is that since XML file is big, parsing XML may spend quite a while, and because getting attachment path depends on XML parse, when the \"choose path\" query is responsed, the client web connection may have been cut off by proxy timeout, then \"choose path\" query will never be able to send to client side, and it makes restore get to a dead end.",

One with key TST-1 and one with key CONF-1747. You use a query like this:\n\n{code}\nissuekey in (TST-1, CONF-1747)\n{code}\n\nLet's say that TST-1 does not exist. Instead of only returning CONF-1747, the search screen displays an error. This is unintuitive behavior. Consider the query in a different form. \n\n{code}\nissuekey IN TST-1 OR issuekey IN CONF-1747\n{code}\n\nThere is an issue that matches the above criteria but the JQL engine returns an error because there is no TST-1 key. \n\nThe particular use case is the {{jiraissues}} macro in Confluence. In Confluence 3.5, users will be able to use it to display info for single issue keys. I want to create a single JQL query  request for all issues on a page. However, if a user mistypes a single key, it will derail the entire search request to JIRA and no information will be returned. ",

Fundamentally, the situation as reported on this suggestion is intended functionality. Sharing a filter or dashboard with \"Everyone\" is intended as a way to allow users who may not have accounts in your JIRA instance the ability to see certain dashboards or filters, assuming they contain issue data that has also been shared with anonymous users. There are a number of use cases for this and we know that many customers are using JIRA this way today.\n\nThat said, we are also very aware that the wording \"Everyone\" can cause significant confusion, where users do not realize the \"Everyone\" option means that the dashboard or filter will be visible to unauthenticated users. In certain situations, this can become a security concern. Therefore, we have recently introduced some changes in to mitigate this issue.\nh4. New global setting\n\nJIRA administrators can now disable the ability to share dashboards and filters publicly via a new global setting \"Public sharing\". This setting is available from JIRA Admin > System > General Configuration > Edit Settings. _Please note that this will not affect existing filters and dashboards. If you change this setting, you will still need to update existing filters and dashboards if they have already been shared with \"Everyone.\"_\n !Cursor_and_Edit_JIRA_Configuration_-_JIRA.png|thumbnail!\nh4. \"Everyone\" is now \"Public\"\n\nIn order to more clearly emphasize the outcome of sharing a dashboard or filter will allow unauthenticated users to see it, we have renamed the \"Everyone\" setting to \"Public\" and updated the wording in the UI to be more explicity.\nh4. New \"All logged-in users\" option\n\nWe know the intent of many users who selected the \"Everyone\" option previously was to share the filter with everyone in their organization. We've added a new option \"All logged-in users\" that is a more understandable way to share a dashboard or filter with _all users who have a JIRA account_.\nh4. Sharing options have been reordered\n\nIn order to reduce the likelihood that a user would accidentally choose the \"Everyone\"/\"Public\" option without understanding the consequences, we have reordered the sharing options so that \"Groups\" are the first sharing option in the dropdown menu.\n\n!Screen_Shot_2016-08-02_at_12_26_32_PM.png|thumbnail!\n\nThese changes were released to JIRA Cloud in August 2016 and in JIRA Server 7.2.2\u00a0to address the concerns laid out in this issue; therefore, we are going to mark it as resolved.\n\nThanks for your patience.\n\nDave Meyer\n Senior Product Manager, JIRA\n{panel}\nWe received complaints from one of our (external) customers saying that his name was found on the Internet via googling for his name. The hit was found via a JIRA-link on our internal JIRA-system.\n When investigating, we found that it was caused by the fact that he had shared filters with restriction \"Anyone\".\n\nThis is not a logical behaviour from JIRA: we don't allow anonymous access to our JIRA, so we assume that nothing is exposed to the Internet. People may for example put information in the title of the filter that should not be exposed to others. As an administrator we don't have the possibility to block this. We can't even change the filters created by others.\n The best solution in my opinion, is to modify the \"Global Permission\":\n * Either create a new global permission called e.g. \"Browse Filters\" that an Administrator can use to block all filters.\n * Or use the JIRA-Users permissions to block such Filters.\n\nThis issue is related to -JRA-22207-, -JRA-17221-, but these requests do not completely reduce the risk.\nh4.

Your feedback is key to helping us understand how you use JIRA so we can continue improving your experience. We have reviewed this issue over the last few days; however there are not currently any plans to implement this suggestion.\n\nPlease remember that jira.atlassian.com is one of many inputs for the JIRA roadmap. You can [learn more about our process here|https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/110373/how-does-the-jira-team-use-jira-atlassian-com].\n\nI understand that our decision may be disappointing. Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.\n\nRegards,\nOtto Ruettinger\nPrincipal Product Manager, JIRA\noruettinger (at) atlassian (dot) com\n{panel}\n\n\n\n*Original Description*\n\n[Some users have indicated|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRA-1962?focusedCommentId=217829&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-217829] that they would like automated failover if an LDAP server becomes unreachable.\n\nSome details on how LDAP connectivity will work in JIRA ATM:\nWhen you add an LDAP directory, JIRA will \"synchronise\" with that LDAP server.\nThat is, it will cache all the Users, Groups and memberships in its local DB.\nThe only thing we don't keep a local copy of is passwords (for security reasons).\n\nThis means that when a user from LDAP logs into JIRA, they will authenticate against LDAP but all following read operations are done locally.\n(If you have Read/Write LDAP then obviously we need to talk to the server for write operations).\n\nSo, if an LDAP user is already logged into JIRA and the LDAP server goes offline, that user will still be able to use JIRA normally including \"seeing\" all users from that LDAP server.\nIn addition, users in other directories will still be able to log in and use JIRA.\nSo, firstly, an offline LDAP server is not as catastrophic as some may imagine.\n\nSecondly, this implies the following (manual) workaround for failover:\nIf you add an LDAP directory, then you should still keep your internal directory.\nIn the internal directory you ought to have at least one admin account.\nIf the LDAP server goes offline, the local admin can log in and manually change the LDAP hostname.\nAlternatively, you could set up 2 LDAP directories with the two hostnames. If the first LDAP goes down, the local admin can simply swap the order of the directories so that the \"slave\" directory has precendence.\n",

Here it goes.\n\nTo be able to join Worklog and Issue tables in the JIRA database we now need to use OfBiz directly, build up an OfBiz condidion, selecting all the worklogs by daterange and then filtering the worklogs with an issuelist we get with JQL.\n\nIf we had a WORKLOG-ISSUE view entity in the JIRA entity model we could join these two tables more efficiently.  This should be a small change in JIRA but would make a big difference to Tempo ;)\n\nCheers\nKrist\u00edn",

Without getting into our system architecture too far we are proxying traffic into Jira.\n\nHowever some external systems that integrate Jira content through RSS feeds are forced to access the application directly, without going through the front-controller.\n\nThis results in RSS feed link with an incorrect host name and port. \n\nI've read through other issues and I fully understand the use of ProxyPreserveHost but this is a scenario where we're avoiding going through Apache due to authentication restrictions.
