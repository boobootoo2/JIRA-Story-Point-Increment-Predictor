In 1.8.4 this behaviour appears to be present through the \"Import Issues\" button and as such is Resolved; unless I have misunderstood?\r\n\r\nAs Epics can be added through JIRA Agile but they don't appear until a manual \"Import Issues\" is performed, in my opinion I believe there is a significant opportunity for Epics to be missed. \r\n\r\nIdeally, the regular \"Update from date...\" operation would also identify new Epics in the Project(s) and suggest importing them into the plan. This provides a cue for a Product Owner to:\r\n* Review the validity of those Epics\r\n* Question the origin of those Epics (E.g. in organisations where project input should be funnelled through the PO).\r\n* Identify the priority of those new Epics and re-plan accordingly.\r\n\r\nApologies if I have misunderstood Portfolio or it's behaviour.\r\n\r\nMany Thanks,\r\nAlex",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JPOCLOUD-198].\n  {panel}\n\nWe are now using Portfolio to plan a cross-team roadmap and have discovered an issue with importing stories into an Epic.\r\n\r\nWe use Epics to describe each Feature (and grouped into higher Initiatives) and the Epic can be worked on by one or more teams.  Our process working with Epics and Stories via Portfolio goes as follows.\r\n\r\n1. Epics are defined in JIRA\r\n2. Epics are imported into Portfolio\r\n3. Epic estimates are entered into Portfolio representing the best guess per team to allow long-term planning.\r\n4. As each Epic is further defined and gets closer to the top of the plan, the teams created their stories (in JIRA) under the Epic\r\n5. The teams then estimate and allocate story points to the stories (in JIRA)\r\n6. Once all teams have created and pointed all stories for the Epic, they are imported into Portfolio, replacing all Epic estimates with the total of the story points.\r\n\r\nWe have discovered a problem between steps 4,5 and 6 above.  If we ask the teams to create stories and before step 6 is complete and Update plan is run, Portfolio will try to replace the Epic estimate with 0, which I presume is the total of all stories.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n*Epic impacts App and Server teams\r\n*Epic estimates are App(20), Server (30)\r\n*Server team add 3 stories under the Epic (no points)\r\n* Update plan is run and all Epic estimates are replaced with 0\r\n\r\nIs this expected behaviour (and therefore a problem with our process) or a bug?\r\n",

At the same time, the card showed Free Capacities of Back End Dev, which doesn't make sense.\r\n\r\nAtlassian suggested that rather than having separate stages for work type, eg, one stage for Design, another stage for Back End Dev, and another for Technical Lead etc, the calculation would probably work better if all work types were set up as different skills within one stage.

Our priority Epics are in one (blue) release and are estimated across several teams, but as the screenshot shows, on one team the Epic is not scheduled until Sprint 6-7.\r\n\r\nI have checked all settings in the plan, set minimum load of story points to 0 (for epics) and even reduced the large Epic estimate (36) to a low number, and the Epic always remains \"stuck\" in Sprint 6.\r\n\r\nCould you please advise the logic used for the Schedule and why this is happening?

This issue is being addressed as part of the all new Portfolio live plans, which feature an entirely overhauled and more seamless integration model with JIRA Software / Agile. Live plans are currently available as a labs feature for both Server* and Cloud, so you can start evaluating them without any risk of impacting existing Portfolio plans. They are not yet feature-complete, we're working on bringing all major capabilities of standard plans back into live plans on top of the new integration model before we graduate live plans out of labs and make them the new standard way of working. \r\nPlease check out this blog for a summary and short videos of how the top-voted suggestions are being addressed with live plans: [Top 10 suggestions addressed in live plans|http://blogs.atlassian.com/2016/03/10-user-suggestions-addressed-in-portfolio-for-jira/] and join our [Portfolio Pioneers LinkedIn group|https://www.linkedin.com/groups/7018171] to discuss feedback and best practices!\r\n \r\nThanks,\r\nMartin Suntinger\r\n[msuntinger@atlassian.com|mailto:msuntinger@atlassian.com]\r\nPrincipal Product Manager, Portfolio for JIRA\r\n \r\n^*The live plans labs feature is available with Portfolio for JIRA 1.12 or higher. It is compatible with JIRA Software 7.0.5 or higher, and JIRA 6.3 or higher, in association with JIRA Agile 6.7.12 or higher.^\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\ni created a team in my plan and added a few members.\r\nthen, i tried importing some issues; these tickets were already assigned to jira users who were added as the team member.  after the tickets are imported, the members fields are empty.  is assignee imported as part of the issue import?",

This issue is being addressed as part of the all new Portfolio live plans, which feature an entirely overhauled and more seamless integration model with JIRA Software / Agile. Live plans are currently available as a labs feature for both Server* and Cloud, so you can start evaluating them without any risk of impacting existing Portfolio plans. They are not yet feature-complete, we're working on bringing all major capabilities of standard plans back into live plans on top of the new integration model before we graduate live plans out of labs and make them the new standard way of working. \r\nPlease check out this blog for a summary and short videos of how the top-voted suggestions are being addressed with live plans: [Top 10 suggestions addressed in live plans|http://blogs.atlassian.com/2016/03/10-user-suggestions-addressed-in-portfolio-for-jira/] and join our [Portfolio Pioneers LinkedIn group|https://www.linkedin.com/groups/7018171] to discuss feedback and best practices!\r\n \r\nThanks,\r\nMartin Suntinger\r\n[msuntinger@atlassian.com|mailto:msuntinger@atlassian.com]\r\nPrincipal Product Manager, Portfolio for JIRA\r\n \r\n^*The live plans labs feature is available with Portfolio for JIRA 1.12 or higher. It is compatible with JIRA Software 7.0.5 or higher, and JIRA 6.3 or higher, in association with JIRA Agile 6.7.12 or higher.^\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\ni see we can now import releases from jira as of version 1.8.  however, if i can the start/end date in jira after a release is imported, the change is not reflected in jira portfolio",

It would be great to see the estimates gathered from the \"teams\" which will implement this roadmap item.\r\n\r\nUse case: \r\n1. There is a high-level roadmap story of \"list all orders from the server and display on mobile apps\"\r\n\r\n2. The work to achieve this is split between server team, and 4 app teams (for iOS, Android, BB, and Windows).\r\n\r\n3. When defining a \"story\" in the roadmap, the stages, skills and estimates are gathered from linking the story to various teams. (For example: A story is created that just requires iOS and Server, links are created to 2xiOS and 1xServer stories, and the estimates are calculated).\r\n\r\n4. The roadmaps story can be linked to several stories in each of the 5 team's backlog\r\n\r\n5. Progress is shown by collating all of the estimates (days/hours/story points).\r\n\r\n6. Team/Stage/Skill capacity is calculated by checking the team's velocity from within Jira",
