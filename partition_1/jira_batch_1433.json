      "description": "There's a scenario where default Crowd group memberships will not sync over to Confluence/JIRA during initial login. If Confluence/JIRA has synced with Crowd _prior_ to the user logging in to Confluence/JIRA, the user will be placed into the correct groups in Crowd but not in Confluence/JIRA.\r\n\r\nh4. Steps to reproduce\r\n# Inside Crowd: create an internal Crowd directory. In the 'Options' tab, set it to add users to some default groups upon initial authentication\r\n# Inside Crowd: create a user in the internal directory but do not place him in groups\r\n# Inside Confluence or JIRA: create a Crowd Server directory, and trigger a synchronization from Crowd\r\n# Inside Confluence or JIRA: log in using the Crowd user\r\n\r\nh4. Expected result\r\n* User is added to default groups in Crowd\r\n* User is added to the same default groups in Confluence\r\n\r\nh4. Actual result\r\n* User is added to default groups in Crowd (/)\r\n* User is NOT added to any groups in Confluence (x)\r\n\r\nThis is alleviated during the next FULL sync from Confluence/JIRA, whether automatic or triggered manually. However, incremental syncs will NOT sync the membership info over, thus creating a discrepancy between Crowd and Confluence/JIRA.\r\n\r\nh4. Workaround\r\n* Restart Confluence/JIRA. This will trigger a full sync from Crowd on application startup\r\n* Or, if the Crowd Server user directory is set to use full sync (the incremental sync option is unchecked), you can trigger a sync manually to get the memberships over",

Passwords only in Crowd when using an internal directory.\r\n* Group membership is in LDAP with connector, Crowd with delegated. When using delegated, no group information is inherited from LDAP at all.\r\n* Application permissions (space access, project permissions) always in application\r\n* Most attributes in LDAP aren't brought into Crowd/JIRA.
