Therefore it won't be able to automatically pull repositories for the secondary account as it will always default to the default account and SSH keys will fail.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThat means:\u00a0\r\n * ST is correctly able to perform OAuth authentication for all account and generate and configure SSH-keys (including {{ssh-add}} and {{.ssh/config}} file).\u00a0\r\n * At this point (after having added the key in your Bitbucket account) projects get correctly get and shown on ST.\r\n * The moment a git clone is started from the user interface, the clone process fails due to key error.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe reason for this behavior is that because the project SSH URL has been retrieved via HTTP, it is in the standard format git@bitbucket.org, thus SSH will default to use first SSH credential stored instead of using the Host (e.g. alex-Bitbucket) alias set up by SC during the key generation process.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nA possible workaround is to manually substitute the SSH alias so that SSH will start working properly, i.e. will use the correct key. But in doing so, repo link feature in UX will no longer work. And having to replace all URL before a pull is not nice.",

      "description": "In older versions of SourceTree (or, perhaps, on older versions of MacOS, because I only started seeing this issue after installing SourceTree on a new Mac with OSX Catalina) I could select text from a commit and copy it to the clipboard, then paste it into another app. I would often use this to copy a git SHA I was interested in.\r\n\r\nWith SourceTree 4.0.1 (234) on MacOS Catalina, however, I can no longer copy selected text. I can select text, but the selection is ignored. Whenever I copy (cmd+c), regardless of what text is selected, what is put into the clipboard is a useless one-line commit summary that contains\r\n * the first line of the git commit\r\n * the abbreviated git commit SHA\r\n * the author and author email\r\n * the commit date\r\n\r\nWhile this information might be useful to someone, it satisfies only one use case and prevents any other usage of the clipboard. And while the clipboard contains the SHA that is most-often what I am looking for, the SHA is buried amongst a lot of other information that I don't need, which prevents me from pasting the SHA into other tools.\r\n\r\nI understand there is a menu item \"Copy SHA-1 to Clipboard\" that allows me to copy the git SHA for any commit. That is nice, but there is no keyboard shortcut for it which means it is not nearly as useful as the simple, ergonomic, and idiomatic, cmd+c action. Plus, sometimes I want to copy text other than the git SHA - for example sometimes I might want to copy some text from a commit log message. So this menu item exists, but is no substitute for cmd+c.\r\n\r\nIt is frustrating that SourceTree does not let me copy what I want. It is even more frustrating because SourceTree lets me SELECT text that I want to copy, but then does not copy it - what a cruel mistress you are, SourceTree, to let me think I can copy text like that.\r\n\r\nWhat is the design purpose of preventing users from selecting and copying text? By not allowing cooy/paste, SourceTree is dramatically less useful to me. So please:\r\n * Restore the copy behavior that copies selected text to the clipboard.\r\n * If you must, if this is really a dominant use case of the tool, you can copy the one-line commit summary to the clipboard if no other text is selected.\r\n * And, if you want it to be useful, please add a keyboard shortcut to the \"Copy SHA-1 to Clipboard\" menu item.\r\n\r\nThanks, and thanks for providing SourceTree to the community.",

So this is ours to figure it out at our own risks.\r\n\r\nWhen pushing to repository, Sourcetree displays the checkbox \"Force push\". As this is not a git command line, it is impossible to say how the push is forced. Is it with lease or not?\r\n\r\nThis is critical as code may be lost depending on the end users understanding of that checkbox, as the usual way of force pushing is becoming force-with-lease.",
