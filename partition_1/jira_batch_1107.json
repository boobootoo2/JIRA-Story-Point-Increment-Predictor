      "description": "h3. Summary\r\n\r\nWhen we have a specific set of characters in summary in some issues, it breaks saved filter results containing these issues, showing a blank page when it should show the issue quick view. *These characters are invisible when viewing the summary*\r\n\r\nStrangely enough, *it doesn't happen when we do a regular JQL search*, even using the same JQL search as the affected filter, only when opening a saved filter.\r\n\r\nFilters using affected filters (using filter=\"affected filter\") are also affected.\r\n\r\nThe characters in summary were decoded to hex and are the following: {{e2}}, {{80}} and {{a8}} together.\r\n\r\nHere's a file with the characters followed by a capital C:\r\n[^characters]\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Create an issue with a summary containing the characters:\r\n#* To make it easier, here's a JSON file, formatted to create an issue via REST containing the character.\r\n[^create_issue.json]\r\n#* Notice that there's a space in 'summary' field. Those are the characters causing problem\r\n#* Update project and issue type ID in JSON file to match an existing project and an issue type that's part of that project's Issue Type Scheme\r\n#* Use this to create an example of issue:\r\n{code}\r\ncurl -D- -u user:password -X POST --data @create_issue.json -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" https://instance.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue\r\n{code}\r\n# Create a filter containing the issue and save it (must be saved to replicate)\r\n# Open filter in 'Detail View' (you won't replicate otherwise)\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nThe filter opens correct.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nPage shows blank:\r\n!blank_filter.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nThis shows in JS Console:\r\n{noformat}\r\nUncaught TypeError: Cannot set property 'table' of undefined\r\n    at Object.JIRA.Issues.GlobalIssueNavCreator.readInitialData (batch.js?agile_global_admin_condition=true&devsummary=true&jag=true&jaguser=true&locale=en-US&nps-not-opted-out=true&sd_operational=true&simplifiedUxOptinAvailable=true:9306)\r\n    at HTMLDocument.<anonymous> (batch.js?agile_global_admin_condition=true&devsummary=true&jag=true&jaguser=true&locale=en-US&nps-not-opted-out=true&sd_operational=true&simplifiedUxOptinAvailable=true:11816)\r\n    at j (batch.js?locale=en-US:76)\r\n    at Object.fireWith (batch.js?locale=en-US:77)\r\n    at Function.ready (batch.js?locale=en\r\n{noformat}\r\n \r\nh3. Notes\r\nRunning 'xxd' in a file containing the affected characters followed by a C character (copied from an affected summary), we can see this:\r\n{code}\r\nxxd test6\r\n00000000: e280 a843 0a                             ...C.\r\n{code}\r\n\r\n0x43 (67 in decimal) is C in ascii table and 0A (10 in decimal) is line feed (so a new line), so {{e280 a8}} are the invisible characters. In fact, if you create a file with 'C' alone, it shows everything but those 3 characters:\r\n{code}\r\n00000000: 430a                                     C.\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nThere's some public knowledge about it:\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/10556875/list-of-unicode-characters-that-should-be-filtered-in-output\r\n\r\nYou may be able to find summaries with non-ASCII characters (including those), using this:\r\n{code:sql}\r\nselect id, summary from jiraissue where not summary ~ ( '^('||\r\n $$[\\09\\0A\\0D\\x20-\\x7F]|$$||               -- ASCII\r\n $$[\\09\\0A\\0D\\xA1-\\xFF]|$$||               -- ASCII ext\r\n ')*$' );\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nh3.Workaround\r\nEdit all affected issues, by removing the characters.",

We have notified Slack of this issue with comment notifications for customers using this app with Jira Cloud and will collaborate with them to ensure it is updated. However, the fastest (and recommended) way to address the issue is to install the official [Jira Cloud app for Slack,|https://slack.com/apps/A2RPP3NFR-jira-cloud] as a replacement.\r\n\r\nThanks for your patience while we investigated this issue.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nDave Meyer\r\nJira Product Management\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\nh3. Summary\r\n\r\nWhen a comment is made on a JIRA issue, the [Jira Cloud for Slack (Official)|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.atlassian.jira.slack/cloud/overview] integration isn't generating a new notification on Slack channels. \r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Connect a project to a Slack channel \r\n# On the section *Send a message to the channel when*, mark the *Someone leaves a comment* checkbox: \r\n**  !someone leaves a comment.png|thumbnail! \r\n** Leave a comment on any JIRA issue registered on the connected project\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nA new notification should show up on the Slack channel:\r\n\r\n !comment added.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nSlack will not receive any notification regarding the comment being registered on the JIRA issue. \r\n\r\nh3. Notes\r\n\r\nWhen inspecting the JSON payload that is sent when a comment is made (using the [Connect inspector|https://connect-inspector.prod.public.atl-paas.net]), the comment body is registered on the {{comment_created}} and {{jira:issue_updated}} events correctly. \r\n\r\n",
