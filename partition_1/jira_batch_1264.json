In our JIRA044, JIRA050, JIRA051 or JIRA docs:\n\n# They follow the [create a keystore file|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Running+JIRA+over+SSL+or+HTTPS#RunningJIRAoverSSLorHTTPS-1.\u00a0CreatetheKeystoreFile] and generate a CSR.\n# We ask them to [export the certificate|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Running+JIRA+over+SSL+or+HTTPS#RunningJIRAoverSSLorHTTPS-2.ExporttheCertificate] from their keystore.\n# We then ask them to [import the certificate into the cacerts trustStore|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Running+JIRA+over+SSL+or+HTTPS#RunningJIRAoverSSLorHTTPS-ImportCertificateIntoTheTruststore]. The truststore is designed for certificate authority (CA) certs (e.g.: godaddy/rapidssl/verisign certs) and should mostly have all of the default CA certs. The only time they would need to do this is if the CA is not already loaded or the CA cert is self-signed. Step 1 gets them to sign a standard certificate, not a CA.\n\nWe don't need to ask them to do steps 2 & 3 as when the CSR is generated in step 1, it gets automatically imported and by default when Tomcat starts up it will use the keystore generated in step 1 (provided they did it as the correct user). You could remove the section in the attached screenshot as steps 2 and 3 aren't necessary.\n\nWe also don't warn the user that when using the keytool, it will default to the user's home directory that is running that command - this could lead to problems if they run it as a user that doesn't execute Tomcat. For example:\n\n# The bundled Linux installer sets up JIRA as the {{jira}} user.\n# Tomcat defaults to the {{~jira/.keystore}} file for the user that executes it.\n# If a customer generates the keytool as a user other than {{jira}}, it will not put it in {{~jira/.keystore}}, so Tomcat will not have the correct keystore.\n\nCould you please add something in like the below for step 1:\n\n(i) On Linux, please ensure this command is run as the user that Tomcat runs on. By default, this is {{jira}} when using the bundled installer.\n\nAnd also change \"2. Import certificate into the trust store\" so that we're clear that the user only needs to do this step if they have a CA certificate that is not already in cacerts.\n\nPlease let me know if you need clarification or anything - thanks! :)",

The smaller groups have the latitude to use different development life cycle methods.  For instance, one organization uses a waterfall methodology, while another uses scrum.  \n\nDespite having these various methodologies, we wish to have a single issue tracking system because we have a single overarching CM and QA organization.  While this may not seem ideal, it fits us well because we have different delivery models (some are customer oriented and necessitate a waterfall, others are product oriented and can successfully use scrum).  \n\nOur request is to allow JIRA and GreenHopper to have different licenses counts.  It's frustrating (and a waste of money) to us to have to license GreenHopper at the same level as JIRA, when only a percentage of the GreenHopper licenses will actually be used.  \n\nIt's a testament to how we like JIRA as a bug tracker that we are considering making the move to it organizationally.  However, because the perception is that we are wasting money on GreenHopper licenses, it may sway our decision making otherwise (at least in the form of deciding on a scrum product).",

We were unable to put this into a minor release or point release because it included changes to our stable API. Our rule is that breakages to APIs can only be done in major releases.\n\n\nCheers everyone,\n\nRoy Krishna\nJIRA Product Management\n{panel}",

Wherever possible, we should stop recommending people edit files within that directory, if there is an alternative. Each edit you make within that directory is an edit you have to re-apply each time you upgrade.\n\nA better alternative is to get the admin to set an environment variable before starting JIRA.

This is problematic especially when using JIRA's autocomplete function for filters.  If the results returned does not show the intended filter within the dropdown, then JIRA will not recognize the filter.\n\nh5. The problem:\n* Field searches that use autocomplete only recognizes a filter if it shows up in the dropdown. Specifying a full filter name, does not work if it is not in dropdown list\n* JIRA's searchService returns results based on individual string searches and not by phrase, thus causing the first point i made above.\n\nMy full analysis is found within a customer's support ticket here:\nhttps://support.atlassian.com/browse/JSP-128804?focusedCommentId=2646691&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-2646691\n\nAs it contained some potentially private information in the screenshots, I'll not be posting it over here.

However, it is still possible to crash JIRA by adding many comments to an issue (or when the limit is disabled, which is the default).\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n* Create a huge issue by adding lots of large comments or a large number of comments\n* open the issue in the browser, clicking \"Refresh\" a few times so that it's being loaded in several parallel requests\n* JIRA will crash with OutOfMemoryException\n\nWe need to be able to handle large issues like this. Some options for fixing that come to mind:\n* only rendering the first N comments (where N may vary depending on the comment limit)\n* calculate the size of the comments before loading them into memory, and do something different depending on whether they are above or below a certain threshold\n\nThose are just 2 of many possible options. The important thing is that JIRA doesn't crash, and that we handle both dimensions (comment size and number of comments).\n\nh3. Resolution - JIRA 6.4 and above\n\nh4. For JIRA 6.4.x customers\n\nAll the code changes to support the limit throughout JIRA will be included in JIRA 6.4.1. \n\nHowever, the limit is still off by default, customers wishing to enforce the limit can manually set the {{jira.text.field.character.limit}} advanced setting. We recommend to set the value to 32767 which will be new default from JIRA 7.0 and onwards.\n\nh4. For JIRA 7.0 and Cloud customers\n\nAll the code changes to support the limit throughout JIRA will be included in the next Cloud release and JIRA 7.0\n\n{{jira.text.field.character.limit}} *will be set to 32767 by default* unless you have explicitly changed this setting to a different value.\n\nh3. Workaround\n\nExtract large comments and set jira.text.field.character.limit.\nPlease see our [OutOfMemoryError Caused by Large Comments or Descriptions in an Issue|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRAKB/OutOfMemoryError+Caused+by+Large+Comments+or+Descriptions+in+an+Issue] KB for further information on this.",

The custom field is available for at least one of the projects\n\nThe project \"Project_A\" has 9 issue types, 7 of which are standard issue type (those that have the custom field \"Custom_A\"), and 2 that are sub-tasks.\n\nWhen I do a search in the issue navigator, if I select the project \"Project_A\" and select some or all of the standard issue types and search, under Custom Fields there is a drop down box for \"Custom_A\".\n\nHowever, if I select the project \"Project_A\" and \"Standard Issue Types\" the field \"Custom_A\" is not available. It seems that the \"Standard Issue Types\" option is not parsed correctly. I would expect it would \"check\" all standard issue types for this project. Instead it makes a check on all standard issue types on global server, causing the custom field to not pop-up as an search option.\n\n\n\nAs a work-around I've selected the custom field to be used by all issue types. Still this looks like something that needs to be resolved.",
