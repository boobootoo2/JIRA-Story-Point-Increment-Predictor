This is very useful when bulk changing many tickets, but I tend to also use bulk change for 2-3 tickets at a time.  The time it takes to bulk change a small number of tickets is longer with the progress bar, as I have to wait for the first poll of the progress bar which is longer than the time it takes to bulk change my tickets.  Is there a way to improve this?  Perhaps with having the first poll of the progress bar occurring sooner?  Or not using a progress bar when there are a small number of tickets?",

This should resolve the problem originally described in this issue.\n\nAs I mentioned in my previous update, improving events and email notifications is part of the current JIRA roadmap. A number of you have indicated that there are existing challenges you face with JIRA email notifications beyond this issue. We would love to hear your feedback and suggestions \u2013 feel free to contact me directly.\n\nThanks,\nDave\nProduct Manager - JIRA Platform\n{panel}\n\nh4. Steps to reproduce\n# Remove all log work notification\n!1.png|thumbnail!\n#* This is verified by the Notification Helper\n!2.png|thumbnail!\n# Have the user create an issue (PROA-4 in my test)\n# As an admin, log work on the issue\n\nh4. Expected Results\n* No email notification received by reporter\n\nh4. Actual Results\n* Email is sent to reporter\n!3.png|thumbnail!\n\nh4.

Expected Behavior\nPool LDAP connections over SSL (LDAPS) as performed when connecting over plain LDAP.\n\nh3. Actual Behavior\nLDAPS connections are not pooled, requiring JIRA to renegotiate the connection every time. This leads to poor performance and could cause synchronization failures, as described on [this KB article|https://confluence.atlassian.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=763004137].\n\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\n# Setup any directory server with a considerable amount of users and groups (no limit pattern has been detected up until now);\n# Enable SSL for the connection;\n# Synchronize;\n\nh3. Workaround for pooling connections over SSL\nAdd the below argument to JIRA's [startup options|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Setting+Properties+and+Options+on+Startup].\n{noformat}\n-Dcom.sun.jndi.ldap.connect.pool.protocol='plain ssl'\n{noformat}\n\nh3. Workaround for improving synchronization time\nAlbeit this won't resolve the pooling connections problem, it can significantly improve the synchronization time:\n# Edit the LDAP directory:\n# On _Use the User Membership Attribute_, under *Membership Schema Settings*:\n## Uncheck \"When finding the members of a group\";\n## Check \"When finding the user\u2019s group membership\";\n# Save the configuration and synchronize the directory;",

Also the font size is little bit larger. Please check the attached ScreenShot-1 \n\nIssue2: This is a major issue which causes lot of problems to our 2 dimensional filters in the dash board.

Importing is not the same as bulk editing.\n\nImporting via .CSV can easily go wrong spawning tons of errors, especially for those who have little experience formatting them.  This can cause all types of problems throughout the entire JIRA instance.  And while most users would like the ability to import issues as it is an easier way for them to enter issues, most either will not take the time to correctly format their import, read how to do so or pre-test the import before they do so.  This can be very, very bad.\n\nSo personally, as my companies system administrator, I have to make the choice of taking the risk to allow them this function (since they require the \"Create Issue\" ability in their own projects and they use Bulk Editing, turn off bulk editing which they have used for 2 1/2 years, or not upgrade above the 6.1.x series.  At present, only the latter is a viable solution.\n\nPlease add additional abilities for system administrators to limit the use of bulk importing (like it's own global permission setting)",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-40933].\n  {panel}\n\nAs JIRA becomes used for many purposes within an enterprise, one common problem is that many similar custom fields are created. This is because each JIRA project may have very specific needs about what a field is named, e.g. \"Account Owner\" vs \"Device Owner\" in two different projects. The current best approach is to use a single field named \"Owner\" and change the field description in each project. But sometimes the project owner *really* wants a specific custom field name and then a new field is created.\n\nI think that https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/ENTERPRISE/Scaling+JIRA suggests that performance degrades above 600 custom fields. I've personally noted that the Lucene index size grows as the number of custom fields increased, which also impacts JIRA issue update and comment performance.\n\nMy suggestion is to allow the names of custom fields to differ in each project, probably controlled via a field configuration. This would allow reuse of custom fields and improve the long-term performance of JIRA",
