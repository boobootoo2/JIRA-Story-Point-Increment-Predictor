I used to use this feature often, and since it no longer works after upgrading to 2.2, I have reverted back to 2.1. \r\n\r\nReproduction Steps:\r\n* Open any repo with multiple commits \r\n* View the repo history\r\n* Right click on a previous commit (something other than the most recent) and choose the  \"Reset Development to this commit\" option in the right click menu\r\n* A dialog box \"are you sure you want to move the branch pointer\" displays, and requires you to specify a mode.\r\n* Select the \"Hard Mode\" & Click \"OK\"\r\n* A new dialog box displays \"Warning: destructive operation\"\r\n* clicking \"OK\" on this \"warning\" dialog simply returns you to the previous dialog box *without performing the operation*  (it's as if the \"OK\" button has the same function as the \"Cancel\" button.)\r\n* Thus, there is no way to use the SourceTree to \"reset to a previous commit\"\r\n\r\nIt's nice that you have cleaner up the UI in SourceTree - but breaking a key GIT feature while doing it is un-excusable.",
