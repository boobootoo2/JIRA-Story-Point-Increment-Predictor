While this help speed up editing for many users, it can be an annoyance for other due to accidental editing.\n\nSome of our users have experiences fields (mostly big description fields) becoming editable when scrolling the issue and accidentally clicking. Due for them already typing, the data is replaced and saved when the move finish leaving the field.\n\nBecause of those people, we would like to be able to disable the Save-On-Blur feature, thus forcing people to press the check arrow button in order to save, or the cancel button if it was an error.

Your input in the comments helps us understand how this affects you and what you're hoping to accomplish with JIRA.\n\nThe ability to take action on behalf of another user via the REST API is a priority for the JIRA Ecosystem team. We are currently working with the Atlassian Connect team to identify a strategy for implementing this. I encourage you to follow [AC-1080|https://ecosystem.atlassian.net/browse/AC-1080], which is slightly larger in scope and will cover this.\n\nRegards,\nDave Meyer\n[dmeyer@atlassian.com|mailto:dmeyer@atlassian.com]\nProduct Manager, JIRA Platform\n{panel}\n\nAt the moment, there is no option to log work on an issue for a given user. This would be really helpful if we can have the option to log work for any user using EST api.",

This can often add another step for the customer to both enable GC logging and then wait for the problem to replicate itself. Sometimes this can take days, and meanwhile the customers instance is not in the best state. If they had GC logs enabled by default, when submitting that ZIP we'd have them straight away and can analyse them immediately. This would be a huge win for helping us make our customers awesome.\n\nThe current {{setenv.sh}} & {{setenv.bat}} files have the below arguments set in them:\n{noformat}\nJVM_EXTRA_ARGS=\"-XX:+PrintGCDateStamps\"\n{noformat}\n\nHowever this by itself will not provide helpful logs, we really need the following as well, as in the [Garbage Collection Performance Problems|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRAKB/Garbage+Collection+Performance+Problems] KB:\n\n{noformat}\n-XX:+PrintGCDateStamps -XX:+PrintGCTimeStamps -verbose:gc -Xloggc:/var/atlassian/application-data/jira/log/atlassian-jira-gc.log\n{noformat}\n\nThat directory will vary depending on where JIRA has been installed as well, ideally if we could set it with an environment variable or hardcode it based on the installed / changes to {{$JIRA_HOME}}, that would be amazing.\n\nIf you could add log rotation to those logs as well that would be *AWESOME*.\n\nThanks :)\n\nJDK 7 includes automatic GC log rotation options.

You can find a plugin's compatibility information from the the plugin's home page on the Atlassian Plugin Exchange. Once you have confirmed the availability of compatible versions, you should upgrade your plugins after successfully upgrading JIRA. This can be done via the 'Plugin Repository' in your Administration Console.\n{quote}\n\nHowever, in Atlassian Support we still get a lot of upgrade issues coming from incompatible plugins when our friends go for an upgrade. Some of them can be resolved by Atlassian Support, others need to be deflected to the plugin developers as, even though we want to help our friends, it is not possible for us to provide support for a third-party plugin we have no control on.\n\nIn that direction, could we perhaps edit the upgrade pages so that the following two points are mentioned:\n* *Before* an upgrade, the JIRA administrators should use the JIRA Update Check (_Administration > Plugins > JIRA Update Check_) in order to see if some plugins are compatible with the target version or not. (We should make that more obvious as it seems to be missed).\n* Regarding the third-party plugins (the ones that are not supported by Atlassian-this should be mentioned in the Atlassian Marketplace) the plugin developers should be contacted instead of Atlassian Support.\n\nThe results of this could be two-fold:\n# Customers' time would be saved in the sense that plugins would be checked before the upgrade (sparing them the frustration of things not working)\n# Customers' time would be saved also in the sense of contacting the right person (plugin developers) instead of coming to Atlassian Support and us trying to help, then redirecting them to the third-party plugin developers.\n\nWe are here to help our friends in every step of the way. However, perhaps changing our documentation a bit could make more sense and spare them some time.\n\nIt seems we actually have everything in [this page|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/UPM/Checking+Add-on+Compatibility+with+Application+Updates] but it is difficult to find and I don't know how many people would look for it when upgrading.",

This is typically due to a mistyped email address in the admin Gui, a message from an autoreply or other automata to JIRA.\n\nJIRA then replies to that email with a notification that the user is not in the system.  When this reply notification hits the On Demand external MX servers, a delivery attempt is made and this fails (eg, if the message was from postmaster@ and the demote system is misconfigured and does not accept postmaster email).  This email then bounces and JIRA does not deal with the bounce, leaving it in the mailbox, or worse it generates another notification causing a mail loop.\n\nSuggested Resolutions:\n\n* Have JIRA only email an invalid address once\n* Have JIRA set a hashed reply to address to monitor the source of bounces and use it to tie it back to the sent email and disable the user/notify the admin.\n** Note, this will require work from Hosted Infrastructure in order to support\n\n\n",

Test Case Execution Metrics would be the major one, to give all stakeholders an view to what stage QA are at with a particular release\nb. Overall Defect Distribution by Status Metric - very important chart also\nc. Test Case Distribution by Phase - also important\n \nHow would you quantify the return on the work involved in setting this up?\n \nIn my organisation Zephyr was only purchased for the QA team and was carefully chosen for it's integration with JIRA which will be used by other stakeholders in the organisation that would not have the where withall, nor the interest to (nor would be allowed to) login to the QA Testing Framework to get access to these metrics. It was therefore a requirement to be able to export metrics to JIRA for this purpose. It has been stated that \"Zephyr offers comprehensive and unique 2-way integration with both JIRA 4.x/5.x\", if this is the case would it not be very little effort to create a gadget to display these metrics?\n \nIn my case there would be no loss to the viewing of the Zephyr Dashboard because these stakeholders would not have access to it, in fact I thibnk it would be a gain to Zephyr to be a viewable gadget on JIRAs dashboard and would expose Zephyr to alot of people that would not have heard of it before.\n",

This needs to be set up.\n\nWhen this email handler is not set up, JIRA will scan the inbox and process any email that it can and leave the rest in the pop box.  This causes an issue in On Demand (and I believe in Enterprise) because there are a number of emails which will end up in the POP mailbox that JIRA will not process.  This count of emails grows and it sucks up resources because JIRA pop's its email once every 60 seconds, scanning this whole list every 60 seconds.\n\nExamples of these include:\n\n* Auto Replies\n* Bounces\n* Spam\n\nTo resolve this issue, I suggest setting up a default handler in JIRA which deletes any messages that JIRA does not know how to process from the mailbox so that it doesn't grow over time.",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-30099].\n  {panel}\n\nThe tasks I have (actually via Rest API currently) in a project containing issues for version branches 1.x.x and 2.x.x:\n\n* _Find all issues in the latest released version 1.x.x of project ABC_\n* _Find all bugs in versions 1.x.x which are unresolved (known issues filter)_\n* _Find all issues fixed in version 1.x.x_\n\nAs both branches are continuously released the version management in Jira resembles to this:\n\n* 2.0.3-SNAPSHOT (next 2.0 release)\n* 1.0.13-SNAPSHOT (next 1.0 release)\n* 2.0.2 (latest release)\n* 2.0.1\n* 1.0.12 (latest 1.0 release)\n* 1.0.11\n* 2.0.0\n* ...\n\nMy only idea: JQL should support fuzzy matching for versions. Examples for the three examples above:\n\n* _Find all issues in the latest released version 1.x.x of project ABC_\n{code}\nproject=ABC\n  AND fixVersion in latestReleasedVersion(\"ABC\",\"~1.\")\n  AND resolution = Fixed\n{code}\nI think it makes most sense here to extend the JQL function {{latestReleasedVersion}}. If the fuzzy operator should be part of the string I don't know. I think the assumption is totally valid that all strings specified here are for fuzzy matching so the prefix could be skipped. Unclear: How to extend latestReleasedVersion to find all released 1.0 versions across all projects? Perhaps: {{latestReleasedVersion(\"*\",\"~1.\")}}\n* _Find all bugs in versions 1.x.x which are unresolved (known issues filter)_\n{code}\nproject=ABC\n  AND type=Bug\n  AND (affectedVersion in releasedVersions(\"ABC\",\"~1.\")\n    OR affectedVersion is empty)\n  AND resolution = Unresolved\n{code}\n* _Find all issues fixed in version 1.x.x_\n{code}\nproject=ABC\n  AND fixVersion ~ \"~1.\"\n  AND fixVersion in releasedVersions(\"ABC\")\n  AND resolution = Fixed\n{code}\nalternatively:\n{code}\nproject=ABC\n  AND fixVersion in releasedVersions(\"ABC\",\"~1.\")\n  AND resolution = Fixed\n{code}\n\nAs you can see most of the time (for my use cases) it is sufficient to extend the JQL functions {{releasedVersions()}} and {{latestReleasedVersion()}}.\n\nIf it is easier to implement a new JQL function than you could introduce: {{matchesVersion(\"ABC\", \"1.\"}}. So for example the last JQL query would look like this:\n{code}\nproject=ABC\n  AND fixVersion in releasedVersion(\"ABC\")\n  AND fixVersion in matchesVersion(\"ABC\", \"1.x\")\n  ...\n{code}\n\nBut I think this approach will not work nicely for to find the latest released version.",
