We have a large amount of issues in our jira installation.  Most of those issues are unverified, possibly unscheduled and are generally crud.  I only really care about the scheduled issues that are in the current or the next releease or two out.  So statistics for the whole project get skewed by this amount of old/unscheduled/unverified issues.  \n\nIt would be nice to be able to filter a stats portlet by version.  So it basically displays the same way but only calculates stats for a specific version.  Of course, it would be nice to see that version in the portlet header or something.  Also for different ways I configure the portlet (Summary,Components,Assignee) it would be nice to specify whether I want to filter on Affects or Fix version.  ",

Given a particular version,\n> list all the time assigned to different developers? How does the calendar\n> date part work?\n\nThe idea is this: I want to know how much buffer time we have until\na version is due. And a version is due on a release date, which is given\nby calendar date, not by the expression \"in 45 work days\".\n\nSo I have a developer and sum up her current work load in days and hours,\nbased on all issues assigned to her. (Minus the time worked on the issues,\nof course. And across all projects.) That is the first report I described.\n\nNow I give a calendar date, and the system should figure out how many\ndays the developer will be in the office. How many times will the sun\nrise, minus all Saturdays and Sundays. That's how many days she has left\nto complete her work load. The difference is the buffer time for her.\nAs you already have popups in date input fields that show the month,\nformatted by weeks, I imagine calculating the office days would not be\ntoo hard.\nLet's ignore July 4 or any other holidays for now.\n\nIdeally, one would like to see this for all developers in an overview page\n(Or maybe for all developers that are assigned to a project? ) But a start\nwould be to show this on the start page for every developer.\n\nThe question is how this \"release date\" would be stored. Ideally, I would\nlike to set one project as being the reference in the global Administration\nsettings somewhere. Then, the system would get that project, get the next\nupcoming version, and retrieve its \"release date\" value, which I have set\nappropriately.\n\nThe fast version of implementing this would probably be to just set a\n\"release date\" somewhere in the Administration settings and use that value.\n\nThere is a slight mismatch, as you might have noticed: I want the workload\nof a developer gathered across all projects, but one project should be\nused to determine how much time is left. But that's how we work ... we'd\nlike to set up one project \"Holidays\", one project \"Fairs + Exhibitions\",\nand everyone would log issues there. This way we know: \"Person A has two\ndays off, is one day at a conference, and has 14 days worth of issues,\nthat gives him two days left until day X, and that's ok\".",

That is, towards being able to use email as a primary JIRA interface -- ideally, not even be aware that JIRA is involved.\n\nThe biggest use-case I have is public opensource projects.  All communication happens over email, and there is very little distinction between an email and an issue, neither conceptually nor physically (the tracker is configured to send emails for new issues/comments). Frequently, long conversations are held via comments in an issue [1]\n\nFor established projects, a significant proportion (~40%) of non-cvs emails are generated by the issue tracker.  It would be a _massive_ timesaver if developers didn't need to run off to a web interface to comment on issues.\n\nJIRA has some rudimentary support for this (CreateOrCommentHandler), but JIRA-generated emails:\n - do not support threading (JRA-1113)\n - are IMHO pretty ugly and not easy to scan quickly compared to Bugzilla's. (JRA-3719)\n - do not customize the From: address to indicate who the commenter is. (JRA-2315)\n\nSo I think getting decent email support would be a fantastic way of capturing the lucrative open-source market.  More than any other feature, it would leapfrog JIRA over its competitors.\n\n----\n\nIf JIRA's email support was enhanced sufficiently, it could also be used as a support system backend, tracking support requests, not least here at Atlassian.  This is a whole new market, probably justifying a new product stream, but I think the enhancements mentioned above would give us an 80:20 solution.\n\n\n--Jeff\n\n\n[1] For example, see some of Mozilla's longer threads, like http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=97284 .",

This is primarily for the benefit of our QA department.  Anyway I included a sample pic of what the email looks like (basically mimics JIRA).  The class also updates a custom field that we use for the build number.\n\nThere is some stuff that is specific to the way my company works so you would need to make some changes before using this.  I did try to\nexternalize most parameters into a props file, at least to make it\nuseable by multiple projects without recompiling, but there is still\nstuff that needs changing (like the base JIRA url) in the code.\n\nAnyway, if nothing else I figure its starting point for anyone else that might have the same kind of automatted processes.\n\n-Chris\n\nPs.  You'll also need to grab the MailMessage class from\nwww.servlets.com.",

The previous comment with inline image/attachments will be pointed to the latest updated image.\n\nh2. Use Case\n\nAt a support/helpdesk environment, user does not have control over the mail client that the customers use. Which in most of the case, image/attachments are pasted directly to the body of the mail. Causing the default file naming to be identical. \n\nThis has seriously crippled the usability of JIRA as the old comments (with similar file name) no longer represents the state that it should be in. \n\nTo add to the pain, the incoming mail is being deleted upon creation. That removed the reference to track back and it causes confusion especially on a long running case where 4-5 inline image is added. They can only rely on the time recorded when the issue is added to reference it back.\n\nh2. Proposed Solution\n\nTo have the ability to configure the attachments to be appended with time stamp. There should be a toggle in project level so that user get to choose if this only applies to specific projects.\n\nAlso could consider wiki markup with a timestamp column, to place that information to point the attachment to the right one.\n\n\nOriginal Description:\n\n{quote}\nFrequently, we have users who upload images or project requirement Word docs to a JIRA project and when the project changes they upload an updated version of the document again. This ends up in showing the same file name twice.\n\nFew possibilities:\n1) Provide the user the ability to overwrite (update) an attachment they have already uploaded. (Even if they don't have manage attachments? Or only if they do? Not sure.)\n2) When a user uploads a file with a filename that has already been uploaded, change the visible filename to myfile.gif (2) or something similar.\n{quote}",

We are a small company with 2 people (also software engineers) doing the bulk of the support work.  So when I think of a support tracker for our use, I imagine it having, as you say, a pretty simple feature set:\n\n- Ability to receive external e-mail, create a ticket, and have \n  certain comments (correspondence) sent back to the originator/\n  requestee.\n- Status per ticket\n- Owner per ticket\n- Attachment handling is nice also.\n\nWe don't really deal with any notions of priority and/or escalation of\nsupport tickets here, as there is usually only a small amount of traffic.  I should add that I would like these support tickets to be\n'interchangable' with normal issues in JIRA.  They might be created in a default project, but could be moved to other projects and still maintain the requestee, etc.\n\nIn the future I can imagine us exposing JIRA to our customers and\nimporting a customer username/password database already in use, but for now we are mostly interested in e-mail support management.\n",

This list can be custom generated, eg. One can choose to have a list of all projects, one or more project groups and /or one or more projects.

However, the new scheme is called \"copy of ...\" and contains the exact same groups as its ancestor (the original). Usually we want to copy a scheme but we want the same \"kind\" of groups in the new scheme but they have different names. An example.\n\nSuppose we've got a project called XXXX with its associated permission scheme XXXX.\n\nPermission scheme XXXX contains the following groups:\n-          XXXX-users\n-          XXXX-developers\n-          XXXX-administrators\n\nWe create a new project YYYY and want permission scheme YYYY. For this group YYYY we want the same groups as in scheme XXXX with different but analogous names.\n\nScheme YYYY\n-          YYYY-users\n-          YYYY-developers\n-          YYYY-administrators\n\nSo, actually, these were a lot of words to ask only for a possibility to do a \"find/replace\" when copying a permission scheme. Automatically creating the new groups of the new scheme if they don't exist yet is yet another small thing to make the life of an admin a little less painful :-)",

We highly value your feedback in all forms, and through suggestions in jira.atlassian.com is not different. We use this channel often to learn the best we can with how customers use JIRA and how we can continue to improve the experience for as many users as possible.\n\nWe have revisited this issue again recently and wanted to reiterate that there are still currently no plans to implement this suggestion, and it is not currently on any JIRA team\u2019s roadmap at this stage.\n\nThere are several third party add-ons that solve many of the use cases mentioned below:\n* [Profields|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.deiser.jira.profields]\n* [JIRA Metadata Plugin|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.osoboo.jira-metadata-plugin]\n* [JIRA Project Specific Select Field|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/jira.plugin.projectspecificselectfield.jpssf].\n\nPlease note that these add-ons are for Server only at this stage. We're looking to improve our JIRA Connect capabilities in the future to enable developers to provide this kind of capacity to Cloud customers, but there are no concrete dates at this stage for the release of these capabilities.\n\nPlease remember that jira.atlassian.com is one of many inputs for the JIRA roadmap. You can [learn more about our process here|https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/110373/how-does-the-jira-team-use-jira-atlassian-com].\n\nI understand that our decision may be disappointing.

Allows just about limitless flexibility when customizing who gets sent notifications.\n\nBut, you can't customize *what* gets sent.  The same template gets used in all cases.\n\nIt's quite possible that for a given project (or set of projects) I want a completely different sort of email sent.  Maybe I have some boilerplate text that I want included only for those projects.  Or I want to limit the fields that get sent.\n\nOne way of doing this would be to extend the NotificationType interface to include a way of giving the template for a given event type.  So, in addition to having\n\n List getRecipients( ..)\n\nyou'd have something like\n\n String getTemplate(String action) { .... }\n\nThen I could write my own notification scheme that did what I wanted.\n",

Especially how you can scope them to 'global, per project or per issue type'.\n \nWe can also customize issue types, priorities and resolutions.\n \nI was wondering if it's crazy to dream of a day when JIRA might allow 'scoping' of these built-in fields as well?\n \nIt would be very handy.  We could open up our JIRA install to serve external customers that only wanted to have one issue type (IE: a complaint!)\n \nI think with many end-customers, having to select amongst bug, task, inprovement, new feature is daunting.\n \nAnd hey... while we're at it... the fields that appear on \"the next page\" like version, environment, assigned to, etc...   Could those be configurable as well\n \nDoes it sound like I'm wanting JIRA to morph into a CRM-like application?   ;)\n \n",

We highly value your feedback in all forms, and through suggestions in jira.atlassian.com is not different. We use this channel often to learn the best we can with how customers use JIRA and how we can continue to improve the experience for as many users as possible.\n\nWe have revisited this issue again recently and will state that there are no plans to currently implement this suggestion. There are already a number of existing add-ons in the [marketplace|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/] that handle this use-case, and I recommend utilising them for your instance to add types or attributes the work in Log Work.\n\nPlease remember that jira.atlassian.com is one of many inputs for the JIRA roadmap. You can [learn more about our process here|https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/110373/how-does-the-jira-team-use-jira-atlassian-com].\n\nI understand that our decision may be disappointing. Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.\n\n\nRegards,\nKerrod Williams\nKerrod (dot) Williams (at) atlassian (dot) com\nProduct Manager, JIRA\n\n{panel}\n\n///\n\nFor each task we need a little IMPLEMENTATION, ANALAYSIS, PROJECT MANAGMENT, TESTING, DOCUMENTATION...I wouldn't like to split one task into several tasks just to know how much time was spent on different types of work.\n\nIt would be great if user could specify what type of work was he doing in Log Work.\n\n\n",

The PM assigne the detailed business requirement specificatoin to a process manager, when it's resolved it goes to a predefined deveopment team ( Multiple assignement ), when it's solved automatically goes in 3 parallel phases ( test & implementation & documentation ) when all 3 issues are solved it goes to the Q & A.  We have done it at this moment trough a listener, added a java class and manipulating everytime manually a file property. An idea could be manage the file property with an XML file, create this file trough a xml workflow designer ( like reactor studio )and let it read by Jira.",

JIRA EmailHandler listens to this box and creates comments from incoming email.\n\nAn internal helpdesk project could then be created that sends out emails as helpdesk@domain.com. JIRA EmailHandler could listen to this box and create comments from incoming email. \n\nCreateIssueHandler would then be easier to configure since both projects have totally separate email addresses.

We have the project manager get notified for assigns, edits, resolved, closes, etc. Everything basically. They want to have all these notifications, because they need to know when status changes, but they don't want all of the e-mails.\n\nWhat about a way to batch the changes, PRIOR to batching the sending of the e-mails.  For example, say an issue is edited (component and fix for version set), then assigned to a developer with a comment, and then the developer adds another comment, all in under one minute.  This would result in three e-mails, all sent out one minute from now.  Why not batch the changes, and every minute poll the \"notification batch\", generate ONE e-mail that lists the changes made to the issue.  This would significantly reduce e-mails, while still giving a project manager/lead the ability to keep up to speed on the issue.  Just a thought.",

As you can see from the history, this issue has been open for almost 12 years, yet I do not expect it to be on the JIRA team's roadmap in the foreseeable future. It is unlikely we will resolve it as described in the original request.\r\n\r\nThe easiest way to view issues that you have looked at recently is to use the [issueHistory() function|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Advanced+Searching+Functions#AdvancedSearchingFunctions-issueHistory()]. This is easily accessible by clicking \"More...\" under the \"Recent Issues\" section of the Issues menu.\r\n\r\nIf you find yourself needing to frequently track issues you have commented on, we recommend [enabling the \"autowatch\" preference|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Commenting+on+an+Issue].\r\n\r\nAlternatively, this function has been implemented in a number of JIRA add-ons:\r\n * [JQL Pro|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/jql-pro]\r\n * [Your JQL & Workflow Tools|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/pt.lt.lfcribeiro.jira.jqlLTFunctions]\r\n * [AM Utils|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/ru.andreymarkelov.atlas.plugins.utils]\r\n * [JQL Tricks Plugin|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.j-tricks.jql-plugin]\r\n\r\nAs is the case with all issues on jira.atlassian.com, closing this issue does not mean this functionality will never be a part of JIRA by default. However, the JIRA product management team is making an effort to make jira.atlassian.com a more valuable tracking tool by closing the issues that we do not expect to work on in the reasonably foreseeable future.\r\n\r\nAs always, please do not hesitate to contact me directly with questions.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nDave Meyer\r\nJIRA Product Manager\r\n{panel}\r\n*Original request description:*\r\n\r\nHi,\r\n\r\nOur users would like to search on issues he has added comments to. It would be a handy way to choose issues to be watched.\r\n\r\nWe can currently search on text within comments, but not filter on comment-authors.\r\n\r\nIn the filter page, perhaps as one of the attribute fields, there could be a field for \"Includes Comment By\".\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nSteve\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nStephen Butler, Software Logistics Dept.\r\nSOLINET GmbH Solutions for Innovative Networks\r\nMittlerer Pfad 26, 70499 Stuttgart, Germany\r\nTel +49 711 1398 1357, Fax +49 711 866 1240",

So, many times, we'll have an issue description like:\n\n\"Blah blah blah doesn't work. See SMA-102.cs and SMA-102.xml for bug reproduction.\"\n\nJIRA seems to automatically hotlink the SMA-102 to the actual issue inside JIRA. This is really cool, actually, but it would be nice if it were smart enough to look for more text and not link if it existed. So, putting SMA-102 by itself, surrounded by spaces, would be cause a hot link, but putting SMA-102anythingelsehere would not.\n\n",

Your feedback is key to helping us understand how you use JIRA so we can continue improving your experience. We have reviewed this issue over the last few days.\n\nSimplifying project setup, configuration, and maintenance is one of the JIRA team's top priorities right now. We are in the early stages of a big investment in making it easier to get started with a JIRA project and maintain a large number of projects at scale.\n\nIt's important to understand that we rarely try to implement individual features from jira.atlassian.com, but instead take a holistic look at the problem and use feedback from the comments here and a [dozen other sources|https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/110373/how-does-the-jira-team-use-jira-atlassian-com] of customer input to solve the core problems.\n\nThe ability to create new projects without full JIRA administrator permission is one of the initial areas we will investigate, so this is a high priority for our team. While we cannot provide any information on a planned solution or release date, we will update this issue as we progress.\n\nPlease don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or feedback.\n \nRegards,\nDave Meyer\ndmeyer@atlassian.com\nProduct Manager, JIRA Platform\n{panel}\n\n*Original request description:*\n \nCurrently, I need to give my project manager the jira-administor permission in order for him to create new projects. Unfortunately, this opens up the possibly of him doing other stuff, like changing the mail server. Not that he would, but when you give permissions...\nSuggestion: Make Create New Project a separate global level permission.",

Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.\n\nRegards,\nDaniel Franz\ndfranz@atlassian.com\nPrincipal Product Manager, JIRA Platform\n{panel}\n  \n\nWhilst experimenting with the issue linking functionality, we came up with the idea that as well as just linking, it would be great if we could add a dependancy on another issue.  So we can setup a work-flow that says \"before IS-334 can be done, IS-331 and IS-332 must be compleated.\"\n",

Then every period the outstanding notifcations are proccessed and sent. To notifcation service should combine all updates for a single issue made by the same jira user into one email. This would reduce the volume of email notification. It is a real pain when you make 3 quick changes to a jia issue and this generates 3 emails. Thie more redundant emails jira sends the less likely people will read all of them.\r\n # Jira still sends emails to me when I have made the change. Surely this should be able to turned of at least under my profile settings. (eg. \"Don't notify me of change I make\" ).",
