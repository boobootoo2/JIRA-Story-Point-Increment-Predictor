All users should now see the same favicon as they did before the experiment had started.\r\n We really appreciate all the feedback that you have provided over this period. They give valuable insights which will help inform our next steps with this feature.\r\n Please feel free to continue to let us know what you think here. Thanks again for your interest!\r\n{panel}\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe favicon (browser tab icon) of Jira pages have recently been changed to use the project avatar. Previously, the product logo was used.\r\n\r\nIt could be good to have the ability to decide which gets used as the tab icon.\r\n\r\n\u00a0",
