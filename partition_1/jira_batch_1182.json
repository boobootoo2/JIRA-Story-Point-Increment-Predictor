Problem Definition\nIn a few aspects of JIRA e.g. User Profile menu (my JIRA home, logout menu items), the atl_token is appended to the URL and propagated using GET method.\n\n_Sensitive information such as token will travel as part of URL when using GET. This information will be stored in browser cache and server logs. This information will be available for unauthorized disclosure through various methods such as shoulder surfing, shared machines or accessing server logs. Additionally, URLs information can get leaked out using referrer header when an external link is accessed via the application._\n\nh3. Suggested Solution\nPOST method can be used instead, since it doesn't store the token as part of the URL and perhaps appears to expose less.",

Often these tasks relate directly to a JIRA ticket.  It would be very convenient to have an easy way to view all Confluence tasks that relate to this or that JIRA ticket within said ticket (rather than creating a link manually in the Confluence document, and then clicking on the resulting link in JIRA to see if there were any tasks that relate to the JIRA ticket).\n\nMaybe this could involve a specialized Confluence Macro, identifying a JIRA ticket that will display all the tasks in the Confluence page (with the ability to check said tasks in the JIRA ticket), as well as link type in JIRA that would identify individual Confluence records whose tasks will be brought into the JIRA ticket.\n\nFinally, it would be good to have a separate area for Confluence tasks within the JIRA ticket - maybe something like the areas for the lists of linked tickets and sub-tasks that are currently found in JIRA tickets.\n\nI created a ticket in the Confluence project for this functionality -  [https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONF-38209] for this functionality.\n\nThanks,\n\nDaniel.\n\n",

I would like to request that we can filter the tasks if a string in the sub-task title matches the filter.\n\nFor example, where I work, I work on tickets for fixing website bugs. This part of the QA process. There's a master ticket labelled \"Client Name QA\", and then there are sub-tasks for each QA bug.\n\nThe sub tasks are named with their relevant department, and the issue, like so:\n\nPM - blah blah\nCSS - Blah blah\nDev - Blah Blah\n\nMe, handling tasks for CSS, would only like to see the ones relevant to me, so I think it would be beneficial that I could only show subtasks which have CSS in the title.\n\nSo the logical way of seeing it would be something like: If 'title' contains 'CSS', display, else hide. I know it's not that simple, but that's where I'm getting at!\n\nThanks in advance guys,\nAsh",

Summary\nThe field in the Assign Issue dialog allows for either typing to immediately select somebody, or clicking on the down arrow to scroll through a list of all the users on an instance. If you have enough users on your instance that the dropdown list has a scrollbar, if you scroll to the bottom JIRA appears to query itself for the list of assignable users multiple times, and you end up with duplicate users appearing at the bottom of the list.\n\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\n# Create 15-20 users in JIRA 6.5-OD-07, ensure all of them are able to be assigned issues (you need enough users to cause the user list in the Assign Issue dialog to have to scroll).\n# Create a new JIRA issue.\n# Click Assign, then hit the dropdown arrow in the Assignee field.\n# Scroll down (using the keyboard or trackpad/mouse, it doesn't matter) to the bottom of the list.\n\nh3. Expected Results\nYou reach the bottom of the user list and there's no duplicates.\n\nh3. Actual Results\nAs you get to the bottom of the user list, you'll notice the scrollbar will jump and you'll have a couple of duplicate users appearing at the bottom. This will repeat two or three more times.\n \nh3. Notes\nYou can see the XHRs appearing in the web inspector each time the scrollbar jump happens. The very first XHR when you click the down arrow in the Assignee field will contain all the users with no duplicates, but the subsequent ones will have only one or two users in them, which are the duplicates that appear at the bottom of the list upon scrolling down.\n\nThis isn't browser-specific (I can replicate it in Firefox, Chrome, and Safari).\n\nh3.Workaround\nCurrently there's no workaround, but this issue is purely cosmetic.",

This feature is to avoid loop and loop detection so we do not recommend to enable it, unless we get Atlassian Development Team idea about it.\n\n(!)

If you don't click on it fast enough, you have to then search for your ticket, just to add the watchers.\n\nAs a developer of systems myself, it would appear to be trivial to collect the watcher ids in a form, post together with the new ticket data, and map the watchers after the ticket is created.\n\nEven more trivially, just redirect to the newly created ticket. This is the standard pattern for any CRUD system, and you're completely breaking it. I read that support teams want this so they can create a ticket without changing their current screen.\n\nOK. then add a checkbox at the bottom of the create ticket screen that defaults to 'Open ticket after creation'. 1 new element, 2 lines of code, 1 extra test.\n\nI also see that there are a lot of complaints about this spanning the last 2 years (really!?) such that there is even a JS plugin hack to get around this unintuitive behaviour.\n\nHow hard can that be? About 15 minutes of work?\n\nC'mon guys!\n",
