However, the [documentation|https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiraserver072/configuring-jira-application-options-828788218.html] still writes the following\n{quote}When turned ON, you will no longer be able to create, edit or delete users/groups from within JIRA (or via email or import); but you can still assign users/groups to project roles, and create/edit/delete user properties. Additionally, JIRA will not display options for users to change their password, or edit their profile.Generally you would only turn this ON if you are managing all your users from outside JIRA (e.g. using Crowd, Microsoft Active Directory, or another LDAP directory) Default: OFF {quote}\n\nThis still says that admins won't be able to create users/groups when turned ON\n\nh3.

See \nhttps://confluence.atlassian.com/display/AdminJIRAServer071/Supported+platforms for reference. \n\nh3. Suggested Solution\nRemove the information regarding the 64 JDK: \"You cannot run JIRA as a service on a 64-bit operating system if you require allocating more than 1.5GB of memory, due to 32-bit JDK memory limitations and 64-bit JDK/Tomcat service issues.\"\nh3.

Problem Definition\nThe JIRA Admin Helper can help admins diagnose why a user can or cannot perform some actions on a certain issue based on Project Permissions. However, it is not helpful when trying to find out project-based permissions:\n\n# What projects do I have Administer Projects permission on and what grants me that access (e.g. role X/group Z)?\n# What projects does user X have Administer Projects permission on and what grants them that access (e.g. role X/group Z)?\n# What projects is user X a project lead in so that we can replace them if needed?\n\nYou may be able to use:\n\n1)  The following [advanced JQL functions|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRACORESERVER072/Advanced+searching+-+functions+reference] which let you search based on roles or permissions, but the output is issue based and not easily represents the projects you have access to. \n\n{code:borderStyle=solid}project in projectsWhereUserHasPermission(\"Administer Projects\") or project in projectsWhereUserHasRole(\"Administrators\") ORDER BY project{code}\n\n2) The [getPermissions|https://docs.atlassian.com/jira/REST/7.2.3/#api/2/-getPermissions] REST call, but you would need to script it out to feed it all projects and clean the data somehow.\n\n3) SQL queries to capture the projects you have admin permissions in.\n\nThere is no user-friendly method to get this from JIRA even though this information is critical to manage an enterprise-sized instance.\n\nh3.

This works fine for me.\n\nSo since I quite rarely use sprints - allthough I know exactly what it is, it doesn't really fit my requirements - I have to transition quite often Issues to \"Start Progress\", \"Stop Progress\" or \"Resolve\"... This is possible, but only thourgh the \"...\" Menu -> More Actions, where I can find the transitions....\n\nI would be nice to integrate these transitions steps directly in the popup menu when clicking on \"...\" Menu button.I can already Edit, Assign, Log Work, Attach Files and more.... But simple transition is some more clicks away....\n\nI know.... I could/or should use sprints, since Backlogs are not really there for transition... But it really depends... At least for me, this would support me in my manner of work.",

Problem Definition:\n\nFor\u00a0long established JIRA Servers, over time many projects may no longer be necessary. Knowing when they were created, who owned them, when they were last updated, number of issues, etc. would be a good addition to regular JIRA Server Administration so that unnecessary or old Projects can be pruned on a regular basis.\nh3. Suggested Solution:\n\nThere should be a tool for native project analysis/archival/mgmt workflow that allows administrators to\u00a0View\u00a0_all_\u00a0project characteristics, such as: project create date, last updated date, total # of issues, project owners/admins in the Administration are of the product.\nh3. Why this is needed:\n\nReducing the size of a large JIRA Server is good for performance, and makes the server easier to manage.",

We highly value your feedback in all forms, and through suggestions in jira.atlassian.com is not different. We use this channel often to learn the best we can with how customers use JIRA and how we can continue to improve the experience for as many users as possible.\n\nWe have revisited this issue again recently and will state that there are no plans to currently implement this suggestion. There are already a number of existing add-ons in the [marketplace|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/] that handle this use-case, and I recommend utilising them for your instance to add types or attributes the work in Log Work.\n\nPlease remember that jira.atlassian.com is one of many inputs for the JIRA roadmap. You can [learn more about our process here|https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/110373/how-does-the-jira-team-use-jira-atlassian-com].\n\nI understand that our decision may be disappointing. Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.\n\n\nRegards,\nKerrod Williams\nKerrod (dot) Williams (at) atlassian (dot) com\nProduct Manager, JIRA\n\n{panel}\n\n///\n\nFor each task we need a little IMPLEMENTATION, ANALAYSIS, PROJECT MANAGMENT, TESTING, DOCUMENTATION...I wouldn't like to split one task into several tasks just to know how much time was spent on different types of work.\n\nIt would be great if user could specify what type of work was he doing in Log Work.\n\n\n",

Problem Definition\n\nJIRA has experimental REST API operations to change and fetch issue properties:\n{code}/rest/api/2/issue/{issueIdOrKey}/properties/{propertyKey}{code}\n\nThis is available in [JIRA REST API documentation|https://docs.atlassian.com/jira/REST/cloud/#api/2/issue/\\{issueIdOrKey\\}/properties].\n\nThe 'set property' operation (a PUT operation) seems to require a request payload to actually set the property. Something like the response from the 'get property' operation:\n{code}\n{\n    \"key\": \"issue.support\",\n    \"value\": {\n        \"hipchat.room.id\": \"support-123\",\n        \"support.time\": \"1m\"\n    }\n}\n{code}\n\nHowever, this is not described in the documentation and may be confusing.\n\nh3. Suggested Solution\n\nLike in the [create issue|https://docs.atlassian.com/jira/REST/cloud/#api/2/issue-createIssue] documentation, add a 'request example' to 'set property'. The data above may be used.",

You need to send a POST Call for {{rest/auth/1/session}} and\r\nIt should return the \"Name\" and \"Value\" for Tokens, like the response below. \r\n\r\n{code}\r\n{\r\n    \"session\":\r\n        {\r\n            \"name\":\"JSESSIONID\",\r\n            \"value\":\"6E3487971234567896704A9EB4AE501F\"\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nHowever while testing this in a Cloud Environment Instance.

Firstly, we would like to assure you that we are still working on this feature and remain committed to releasing OAuth support as soon as possible. \r\n\r\nAs part of our endeavor to improve the security of our incoming email service, along with the release of OAuth support, we plan to move from IMAP/POP to Gmail APIs/MS Graph APIs to retrieve emails. The team is working to bring this smarter, more performant, and more secure service very soon but would like to take a moment to get some feedback from customers in this regard.\r\n\r\nIf you have any concerns about the service moving to APIs, we'd like to hear about them and understand the details. Please reach out to me at asom at atlassian dot com.\r\n\r\nThanks and regards,\r\nArjoon Som\r\nSr. PM, Jira Cloud\r\n{panel}\r\n\u00a0",

Problem Definition\nIn the Rich Text Editor Documentation for JIRA 7.2:\n- https://confluence.atlassian.com/jiracoreserver072/visual-editing-838542506.html\n\nThe Notation states:\n{quote}\nVisual editing is part of a Labs feature in JIRA platform 7.2. Labs features can be turned off by your administrator, so if you don't have access to visual editing, that's probably why.\n{quote}\n\nBUT Labs functionality changed in 7.2 and the only documentation for enabling labs features is for 7.0:\n- https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRASOFTWARESERVER070/JIRA+Software+Labs\n-- this document notes the labs features are under >> Administration > Applications > JIRA software Labs\n\nThis LABS sub menu no longer exists as of jira 7.2 and the *Rich Text Editor* Labs Feature was given its own Sub Menu under:\n- Administration >> System >> USER INTERFACE >> Rich Text Editor\n- OR >> G+G \"Rich Text Editor\"\n\nh3. Suggested Solution\nUpdate the 7.2 and newer Visual editor Documentation to Include locations of the rich text editor menu:\n- https://confluence.atlassian.com/jiracoreserver072/visual-editing-838542506.html\n{quote}\nVisual editing is part of a Labs feature in JIRA platform 7.2.

Summary\n\nThe current warning about data overwrite for users performing import is rather insufficient. The warning should state that the import will overwrite all JIRA data including the current userbase which will affect other application in the same subscription e.g. Confluence.\n\nCurrent message:\n{noformat}\nPlease note that this process will delete all existing JIRA data in your site and replace it with data from the selected file. If you only want to import specific content (such as attachments, avatars, or logos) without deleting all site data, you must make sure that you upload a file with those entities only.\n{noformat}\n\nThe message seems to be focusing on JIRA only and it doesn't mention about userbase overwrite which can affect other running applications.\n\nh3. Suggestion\n\nAll critical information that are related to data overwrite should be warned specifically in the first step of import process as this can be destructive. Further details can be further communicated in documentation.",

Summary\n\nUnable to remove group from default member of project role when group was added using different case than actual group name.\n\u00a0\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\n\nExample 1:\n # Create a local mixed case group, example: {{abCd}}\n # Go to Administration > System > Project roles\n # Choose any of the project roles, then click on _Manage Default Members_\n # Under _Default Groups_ click on Edit\n # Add the group by typing the group name {{abcd}} in the text field\n # Try to remove the group\n\nExample 2:\n # Create a lower case group, example: {{testgroup}}\n # Go to Administration > System > Project roles\n # Choose any of the project roles, then click on _Manage Default Members_\n # Under _Default Groups_ click on Edit\n # Add the group by typing the group name in the text field. Type group name using upper case or mixed case.\n # Try to remove the group\n\nh3. Expected Results\n\nGroup will be removed\nh3. Actual Results\n\nGroup cannot be removed. Attempting to remove group causes page to refresh, group does not get removed.\nh3. Notes\n * The Bug does not affect mixed case groups alone. It affects all groups (jira-software-users is affected if you enter Jira-Software-Users)\n * The problem occurs when the case of the group name entered into the text field does not exactly match the name of the group\n ** Group name foo; you enter foo (/)\n ** Group name foo; you enter Foo (x)\n ** Group name Foo; you enter Foo (/)\n\nh3. Workaround\n\n*To prevent this issue, add the group via the group picker instead of typing name.*\n\nTo remove groups that cannot be removed in the UI: (Server only)\n # Obtain ID of role that needs to be edited\n ** On the page where you remove the group, look at the URL and note \"projectRoleId\" that appears\n # [Back up your data |https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/adminjiraserver073/Backing+Up+Data]\n # Shutdown JIRA\n # In database, {{SELECT * FROM projectroleactor WHERE pid IS NULL and projectroleid = <projectRoleId>;}}\n ** Replace <projectRoleId> with the ID obtained in step 1.\n ** This will return the entries for that project role.\n # For each entry that needs to be removed:\n ** {{DELETE FROM projectroleactor WHERE id = <id of row>;}}\n ** Replace <id of row> with the ID of the row that contains the group name that needs to be removed.\n # Start JIRA\n # Navigate to default project role members page and confirm appropriate groups appear.\n\nCloud customers should contact support to have the group(s) removed.",
