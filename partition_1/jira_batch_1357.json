This plugin widely used by users to correct translation bugs while waiting for Atlassian Translation Bug Fix team to fix the translation bug in next release. Hence, this plugin was really important.\r\n\r\nPlugin is currently an [Atlassian Labs  | https://marketplace.atlassian.com/vendors/33202/atlassian-labs] feature and only available for JIRA Server 7.0.0 - 7.9.2 although it was being tested by some users in JIRA 7.13.0 working fine.\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\nUpdate InProduct Translation to support JIRA 8.0 onwards.\r\n \r\nh3. Workaround\r\nThere is a workaround which is to manually unzips the language pack jar file and re-correct the language. However, this is not a good workaround as it is time-consuming, too technical for users and required downtime to apply the JAR file.\r\n\r\n",
