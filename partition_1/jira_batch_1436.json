As the issue hasn't collect votes, watchers, comments, or support cases from many customers during its lifetime, it's very low on our priority list, and will not be fixed in the foreseeable future. That's why we've decided to resolve it as *Timed Out*.\r\n\r\nAlthough we're aware the issue is still important to those of you who were involved in the conversations around it, we want to be clear in managing your expectations. The Crowd team is focusing on issues that have broad impact and high value, reflected by the number of comments, votes, support cases, and customers interested. Please consult the [Atlassian Bugfix Policy|https://confluence.atlassian.com/support/atlassian-server-bug-fix-policy-201294573.html] for more details.\r\n\r\nWe understand how disappointing this decision may be, but we hope you'll appreciate our transparent approach and communication.\r\n\r\nAtlassian will continue to watch this issue for further updates, so please feel free to share your thoughts in the comments.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nCrowd Team\r\n{panel}\r\n\u00a0\r\n- Create a Delegated LDAP and a normal LDAP directory pointing to the same LDAP server\r\n- Setup Delegated LDAP directory as \"Synchronize Group Memberships\"\r\n- Create a group with description in LDAP directory\r\n- Create a user and add it to group in LDAP directory\r\n- Setup an application that uses the delegated LDAP directory for authentication\r\n- Run authentication test for new user\r\n\r\n*Expected*: User, group and membership to be synced locally.

They start with an internal directory and create users in all lowercase, e.g. jsmith. Life is good then they decide to use AD with Crowd. They create a new Crowd directory and it has the same users with some in a different case e.g. JSmith\r\n\r\nNow when the user logs into JIRA they don't see issues that were assigned to them or reported by them or their own dashboards (very annoying that). The solution is to enable \"force lowercase\" in the Crowd Application for JIRA, restart JIRA and reindex JIRA.\r\n\r\nSince JIRA expects lowercase users in many different places in its source, why not enable \"force lowercase\" by default. Or at least clearly document the consequences of leaving it disabled.",

Unfortunately, this attribute does not exist on ADAM.

It would be very convenient if this plugin would be rewritten to use the new REST API.\r\nAccording to the original author of this plugin, there are no plans to rewrite this plugin:\r\nhttps://github.com/justinedelson/nexus-crowd-plugin/issues/2\r\n\r\nSo it may be in Atlassian's interest to support the integration of nexus by rewriting this plugin in-house. I think that a crowd plugin for nexus would fit nicely into many, many development environments.",

IE: I need to add 2,000+ users to a group and I have no efficient way to do that in Crowd, as its interface allows only 100 users to be returned at a go. I am relegated to using the Windows UAC tool.\r\n\r\nHere's another example: imagine I only have 30 users to add to a group, but their names are all very different. The search function allows me to find them, but when I checked/select a user name and do another search, my selection is forgotten. Alright, I'll just click the Add Users button and carry on. Wait a minute, that just closed the add users dialogue and I have to go through the process of bringing up the dialogue, selecting the search box and typing it all up again.\r\n\r\nMy point is, it would be excellent to have a much improved experience when it comes to managing many users through Crowd. Even the simple addition of AJAX to the Add Users screen, from the Groups tab, so that it doesn't close the dialogue and perform a full post to the page would be helpful. However I'm sure that if you put your minds to it, you can come up with a brilliant interface.\r\n\r\nThanks.",

from build JST-JST-303|https://bamboo.extranet.atlassian.com/artifact/JST-JST/GAPPSIMPLE/build-303/Application-logs/crowd.log], at line ~184341. We have not been able to re-create the failure outside of the build.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll upgrade tasks operate within a single transaction, as dictated by SAL's {{DefaultPluginUpgradeManager}}. Note the {{delete from cwd_token}} at the very top, before the commit, and the subsequent {{update cwd_token}} just before the failure. The logs suggest that the *delete from cwd_token happens immediately*, before the transaction is committed - even though the delete is on an upgrade tasks's codepath, and appears to use the same hibernate session as other upgrade task operations. The *update to cwd_token happens later*, resulting in the {{StaleStateException}}.\r\n\r\nThe origin of the {{update cwd_token}} statement is currently unclear. It could be caused by another upgrade task, but could also be a direct consequence of the HTTP request into the upgrade servlet. An interesting experiment would be to implement a dummy upgrade task that explicitly updates the {{cwd_token}} table and then switches to the in-memory token store, and see whether the db operations are still mis-ordered in that case.",
