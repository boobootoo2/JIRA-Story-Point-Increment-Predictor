While you can create and share a filter, it seems that you have to rely upon the individual user to select columns.

Problem Definition\n\nMigration from JIRA Server to Cloud has currently this bug:\nhttps://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRA-60588\n\nBasically, if the user migrate from JIRA Server to Cloud and the System timezone is different, this will cause a serious problem where dates are actually changed on migration.\n\nThis can be prevented is the user, for example, creates a Cloud instance in the same timezone as the Server. However, this can only be prevented, as we don't have a good and safe way to fix this problem after the migration is done.\n\nLetting the customers know in advance about this problem may prevent many users with the same problem.\n\nh3. Suggested Solution\nAdd a warning to [this documentation|https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirakb/migrating-from-jira-server-to-jira-cloud-779160826.html] warning the customer to this bug and asking them to make sure the timezones match.\n\nSuggested message:\n{quote}\nJIRA Server to Cloud migration is current affected by the JRA-60588 bug, which may incorrectly migrate some dates.. To prevent this problem, please make sure to migrate to a JIRA Cloud using the same timezone as the source JIRA Server.\n{quote}",

We are using this method in a custom plugin that recently upgraded for 7.x and don't want to copy all custom field values as this not always make sense.

Problem Definition\n# As per the [Sharing an issue|https://confluence.atlassian.com/jira/emailing-an-issue-269981237.html] documentation, after typing a name/email into the \"User name or email\" field, a drop-down list of users/emails will be displayed. \n# If you close the drop-down list without selecting a user/email, it will state \"The value xxx is invalid.\" where xxx is the name you have inputted. \n# This is an expected behavior because there potentially could have more than 1 results such as if you have 3 users named after typing \"Adam\" into the field, all 3 users are displayed. \n# When you close the dropdown list without selecting anyone, it will display \"The value Adam is invalid.\" because JIRA is not sure which user is meant to receive the email.\n# The error message will also display even if there is only one user in the drop-down list of if you typed in a non-registered user email and did not select the user/email from the drop-down list.\n# This can be be confusing for some users because when they fully typed in the non-registered user email and then close the drop-down list, it will display that the email is invalid.\n\nh3. Suggested Solution\n# The UI should instead point out to the user that they have to select that the user has to select the user/email from the drop-down list. \n# JIRA should proceed to send the email anyway if there is only one result and it is valid.\n",

Wiki technology allows this so far perfectly for text, simple bitmaps and hyperlinks. But there is no way to handle layered graphics as usual in PowerPoint slides adequately in an article. Workarounds with FlashPlayer and attached office files make things worse. This development may be stopped as soon as layered graphic content can be uploaded into articles with no effort for the user.\nPlease put this issue into the adequate project. I'm sure this would be the ultimate promotion for Confluence, because we are facing this point as major obstacle for user acceptance.",

I tried IE11 and finally switched to chrome. You claim to support IE11, but this has more issues than solutions. Even the configuration is far to complicated for new admins like me.

JIRA correctly found me in the instance ( !Screen Shot 2016-04-12 at 22.52.17.png|thumbnail! ) and when I clicked save the following error occurred \"The user gary.bates@phe.gov.uk does not exist\" (see screenshot  !Screen Shot 2016-04-12 at 22.52.29.png|thumbnail! )\n\nHowever, I definitely exist in the instance with that email address! And you can see that JIRA has found my profile picture against my name too.\n\nI believe this is highly likely to be a similar issue to JPO-1381 (the fact we have changed our user logins across our instance from <firstname>.<lastname> to email address).\n\n",

Problem Definition\n\nTomcat has no automatic way of reporting if there's long running / stuck threads. When troubleshooting performance it can be a lot harder to know what's going on without generating thread dumps. We'd like to automatically get some more information about this.\n\nh3. Suggested Solution\n\nAdding this parameter to the server.xml will log stuck threads in the catalina.out:\n{code}<Valve className=\"org.apache.catalina.valves.StuckThreadDetectionValve\" threshold=\"60\" />\n{code}\n\nThis will log any request thread (eg http thread) that has been processing for more than 60 seconds. This will not log background threads, eg scheduled jobs or any long running operation that processes in the background, like import/export, reindex etc.\nIf you are expecting to see something in these logs that you do not, that does not mean it is not running for more than 60s. It likely just means it is not running in a request thread. Thread dumps over time are still the best way to diagnose long running threads.",

Summary\n\nThe {{DefaultUserPickerSearchService}} builds a query that is very slow to run on instances with many users. It seems to run faster for searches on short usernames compared to searches on long usernames (e.g. a search for \"b\" runs much faster than a search for \"bhas\").\n\nThis causes features such as mentions to perform poorly on instances with many users (e.g. JAC).\n\nh3. Environment\n\nThis performance problem is more evident on instances with many users, such as JAC. For local testing, you can use the JIRA Data Generator Plugin to create many users (about 50,000 is necessary to start seeing a significant problem).\n\nh3. Steps to reproduce\n\n# Hit an endpoint which uses the user search service e.g. https://jira.atlassian.com/rest/api/2/user/viewissue/search?username=bhas&issueKey=JRA-59658\n\nh3. Expected result\n\nResponse comes back in less than 100ms.\n\nh3. Actual result\n\nResponse comes back in ~2.5s\n\nh3. Notes\n\n{{DefaultUserPickerSearchService}} ends up creating the following query:\n\n{code}SELECT ID, directory_id, user_name, lower_user_name, active, created_date, updated_date, first_name, lower_first_name, last_name, lower_last_name, display_name, lower_display_name, email_address, lower_email_address, CREDENTIAL, deleted_externally, EXTERNAL_ID FROM PUBLIC.cwd_user WHERE (((lower_user_name LIKE\u2002\u2002? ) OR (lower_user_name LIKE\u2002\u2002? ) OR (lower_user_name LIKE\u2002\u2002? ) OR (lower_user_name LIKE\u2002\u2002? ) OR (lower_user_name LIKE\u2002\u2002? ) OR (lower_user_name LIKE\u2002\u2002? ) OR (lower_user_name LIKE\u2002\u2002? ) OR (lower_user_name LIKE\u2002\u2002? ) OR (lower_user_name LIKE\u2002\u2002? ) OR (lower_display_name LIKE\u2002\u2002? ) OR (lower_display_name LIKE\u2002\u2002? ) OR (lower_display_name LIKE\u2002\u2002? ) OR (lower_display_name LIKE\u2002\u2002? ) OR (lower_display_name LIKE\u2002\u2002? ) OR (lower_display_name LIKE\u2002\u2002? ) OR (lower_display_name LIKE\u2002\u2002? ) OR (lower_display_name LIKE\u2002\u2002? ) OR (lower_display_name LIKE\u2002\u2002? )) AND (active =\u2002\u2002? )) AND (directory_id =\u2002\u2002? ) ORDER BY lower_user_name LIMIT 100{code}\n\nWhere each LIKE is prepending a separator to the search query e.g. if you search for \"Broo\" it will create a LIKE for: \" Broo\", \"-Broo\", \"(Broo\" etc. This is so a search for \"Broo\" will return a user like \"Mike Cannon-Brookes\". The query above can be even worse if the search is also including results for users whose email address matches, as it will add another 8 LIKE clauses to the above query.\n\nh3.

I like the look of the Projects gadget. However, i need to see more than just if there is an open ticket.  I would like to see if there is an open ticket and a number beside it showing how many there are and also how many were closed for a period of time i pick (monthly, quarterly, etc..).  Also,  have tried using the _recently created_ chart with filters to show how many tickets were opened and closed for a time period.  However, when a month is over it doesn't stop reporting for that time.  For instance, when a ticket is opened in March and closed in April, the closing of the ticket gets reported in March!  There should be a way to see this happened in March, now that it's april you have this many tickets open from last month, this many tickets that have been opened this month and when a ticket is closed report it closed in the correct month.  I added 2 screen shots so you can see what i currently have and hopefully this will help in understanding what i am looking for.  So, far the reporting i have been able to find useful is barely useful.  I really hope you can enhance this.",
