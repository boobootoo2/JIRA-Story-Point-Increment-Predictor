The latest JIRA 4.4.x version is recommended for this process. The following resources in the JIRA 4.4.x documentation are good places to start for upgrading to the latest JIRA 4.4.x release:\n{quote}\n\nCan you please update the above docs so it doesn't give the impression JIRA 5.0 can be upgraded from a version prior to 4?\n\nThanks!",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-27289].\n  {panel}\n\nHey,\n\nThe [Integrating JIRA with Apache using SSL|http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Integrating+JIRA+with+Apache+using+SSL] documentation shows how to set up JIRA to run on https://localhost:8443/jira, whereas the default configuration is to run JIRA on http://localhost/ (the difference being the jira subdirectory). There's some conflicting documentation on this, as below:\n\n[Step 1|http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Integrating+JIRA+with+Apache+using+SSL#IntegratingJIRAwithApacheusingSSL-Step1InhttpdensureSSLProxyEngineison] has the following:\n\n{code}\nProxyPass           /jira       https://localhost:8443/jira\nProxyPassReverse    /jira       https://localhost:8443/jira\n{code}\n\nAnd in the [alternative configuration|http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Integrating+JIRA+with+Apache+using+SSL#IntegratingJIRAwithApacheusingSSL-NoteAlternativeconfigurationifHTTPSisterminatedontheproxyserver]:\n\n{code}\nProxyPass              /jira       http://localhost:8080/jira\nProxyPassReverse       /jira       http://localhost:8080/jira\n{code}\n\nWhereas [Configuring Apache Reverse Proxy Using the AJP Protocol|http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Configuring+Apache+Reverse+Proxy+Using+the+AJP+Protocol] has the following:\n\n{code}\nProxyPass        / ajp://JIRA_HOST_NAME:AJP_CONNECTOR_PORT/\nProxyPassReverse / ajp://JIRA_HOST_NAME:AJP_CONNECTOR_PORT/\n{code}\n\n[Integrating JIRA with Apache|http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Integrating+JIRA+with+Apache] has both:\n\n{code}\nProxyPass           /jira       http://localhost:8080/jira\nProxyPassReverse    /jira       http://localhost:8080/jira\n{code}\n\nand:\n\n{code}\nProxyPass / http://localhost:8080/\nProxyPassReverse / http://localhost:8080/\n{code}\n\nThe problem seems to be some varied differences between 3 pieces of documentation.\n\n{{/jira}} will work if the following is set in {{server.xml}}, as per the example below. The problem is that the default {{server.xml}} has the path set to \"\".\n\n{code}\n<Context path=\"/jira\" docBase=\"${catalina.home}/atlassian-jira\" reloadable=\"false\">\n{code}\n\nThis is the default:\n{code}\n<Context path=\"\" docBase=\"${catalina.home}/atlassian-jira\" reloadable=\"false\">\n{code}\n\nIf the path value is not set to \"{{/jira}}\" and ProxyPass[Reverse] is directed to \"{{/jira}}\" it will cause errors. It also means the client needs to access their JIRA instance differently, as above.\n\nI realise this is unsupported, however is there any chance the docs could be changed to either be {{/}} instead of {{/jira}}, (like the second example in [Integrating JIRA with Apache|http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Integrating+JIRA+with+Apache] docs) or include the {{server.xml}} changes as above?",

It is not on the appropriate screen, or unknown.\",\"description\":\"Field 'description' cannot be set. It is not on the appropriate screen, or unknown.\"}}\n{code}\n* The documentation link on this page https://developer.atlassian.com/display/JIRADEV/JIRA+REST+APIs for 'Reference' links to an apache directory listing http://docs.atlassian.com/jira/REST/ which makes you think something is broken there. Can we not set a link to 'latest' ?",

A better approach would be to use separate \"Global Fix Version\" attribute(s) but such version attributs would be a conceptual new thing in JIRA. \n\nThese things influence the way we should map JIRA projects over sections of our product structure so it is really important.\n\nRegards,\nRuchi",

Therefore, I believe there should be a configuration whereby an issue can be moved regardless of the reporter's create issue permission.  The move procedures can only be done by a JIRA administration.\n\nAs a scenario:\n\"I guess I think of it like this: Imagine if you guys created a project for \"Issues raised by important customers\" - and defined the permissions so that people like me couldn't create issues directly in this project, but a responsible atlassian administrator could move an issue that I raised into this project if I was discovered to be an important customer. Mr Atlassian Admin is carrying out his weekly review and moves 60 issues into this new project - and JIRA requests that he choose a new reporter for all 60 issues.

The new version exports packages required by A, but the dependencies for A has already been resolved. Plugin A still does not interact with B, although it could. Furthermore, JIRA administrator may not know the reason why plugin A does not work with plugin B, if that's something they expect.\n\nDisabling and then enabling plugin A does not help - the bundle is not re-resolved. The only things that help are: a) JIRA restart; b) Uninstallation/installtion of plugin B.\n\nI suggest to add manual button in the UPM that will force plugin into disabled state, re-resolve the bundle, and enable plugin back.\n\nAlso the questionable dependencies can be detected automatically and the system could suggest the admin to re-resolve plugin A after upgrade of plugin B.",

Since the screenshots also illustrate the example description (which is part of the introductory blurb about configuring field tabs), I thought it best to leave them where they were. I agree though (i.e. in reference to the other doc pages in this issue) that it's better to move tables of reference information below their step-by-step instructions, as their content is too specific and do not form part of the introductory material.\n\nhttp://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Managing+Project+Permissions\n\nhttp://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Labelling+an+Issue\n\nhttp://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Logging+Work+on+an+Issue\n\nhttp://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Modifying+Multiple+%28%27Bulk%27%29+Issues\n* Update outdated screenshots on this page too.\n\nCheers\n\nGeoff",

      "description": "{panel:bgColor=#e7f4fa}\n  *NOTE:* This suggestion is for *JIRA Cloud*. Using *JIRA Server*? [See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-27122].\n  {panel}\n\nIt seems there are two options for when JIRA gets an email at a monitored mailbox from an unrecognized address: create a new user, or report through a default issue creator user.\n\nWe were hoping to to use JIRA for external support as well as internal bug tracking, but we now see it's not really possible.\n\nWith the first option, lots and lots of users get created. Our 5-person company has hundreds of customers. We simply cannot justify an $8000, unlimited license when in reality, only 5 people will be using JIRA on a regular basis, and the rest of the external customers will probably only once use it or twice when they have issues with our software.\n\nWe had some hope that, when we exceed our license limit, the users are still created, but without 'jira-users' and can't login or get notifications unless the entire project is public with browser permission, etc. This is also unacceptable, since a user could view another user's support request simply by playing with the issue number!\n\nWith the second option, it's impossible to correspond with the reporting users through JIRA. (We see that JIRA5rc3 now adds a line indicating the address the issue was recved from even if it was created by anonymous). This is useful info. But it's impossible to communicate with them over JIRA and have a record of the support ticket in this case because the notifications only go to the default issue creator, not the reporter.\n\nIf you are going to advertise the dual use of JIRA, you should have a permissions scheme that reflects this so that my 5-person company doesn't need to buy an unlimited license to use it as support. (There are MUCH CHEAPER support tools out there, but we were attracted by the concept of using a single product for both support and bug tracking).\n\nHow about splitting it up so that you have a jira-staff permission, and a jira-customer permission? With a n-person license, you can have up to n jira-staff (who can log in, send and recv notifications, create and update any issue, etc), and unlimited jira-customers (who can log in, but only view and comment on issues they have created, etc).\n\nThis would make JIRA so much better, would make your marketing less misleading, and make the licensing model better match this use case.",
