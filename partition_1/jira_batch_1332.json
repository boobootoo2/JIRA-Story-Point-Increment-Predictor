Static does the same the current implementation, i.e., allowing to specify weekly hours statically allocated to this team in a certain timeframe, dynamic means that the person can be allocated up to the total available time to a team, but across all teams not more than the total weekly hours. Additionally, it should be possible to specify a range, e.g. \"can be allocated up to 50% of her time to this team\"\r\nThe scheduling algorithm, when scheduling by priority order, allocates these flexible capacities greedily to the most important items, i.e. to get something with high priority done first, the according team will get the person allocated by as much as possible. \r\nThis means, people could switch from sprint to sprint flexibly between teams, in Kanban mode even from day to day, working for team A on one day, and team B on another day.

This issue is being addressed as part of the all new Portfolio live plans, which feature an entirely overhauled and more seamless integration model with JIRA Software / Agile. Live plans are currently available as a labs feature for both Server* and Cloud, so you can start evaluating them without any risk of impacting existing Portfolio plans. They are not yet feature-complete, we're working on bringing all major capabilities of standard plans back into live plans on top of the new integration model before we graduate live plans out of labs and make them the new standard way of working. \r\nPlease check out this blog for a summary and short videos of how the top-voted suggestions are being addressed with live plans: [Top 10 suggestions addressed in live plans|http://blogs.atlassian.com/2016/03/10-user-suggestions-addressed-in-portfolio-for-jira/] and join our [Portfolio Pioneers LinkedIn group|https://www.linkedin.com/groups/7018171] to discuss feedback and best practices!\r\n \r\nThanks,\r\nMartin Suntinger\r\n[msuntinger@atlassian.com|mailto:msuntinger@atlassian.com]\r\nPrincipal Product Manager, Portfolio for JIRA\r\n \r\n^*The live plans labs feature is available with Portfolio for JIRA 1.12 or higher. It is compatible with JIRA Software 7.0.5 or higher, and JIRA 6.3 or higher, in association with JIRA Agile 6.7.12 or higher.^\r\n{panel}",

This issue is being addressed as part of the all new Portfolio live plans, which feature an entirely overhauled and more seamless integration model with JIRA Software / Agile. Live plans are currently available as a labs feature for both Server* and Cloud, so you can start evaluating them without any risk of impacting existing Portfolio plans. They are not yet feature-complete, we're working on bringing all major capabilities of standard plans back into live plans on top of the new integration model before we graduate live plans out of labs and make them the new standard way of working. \r\nPlease check out this blog for a summary and short videos of how the top-voted suggestions are being addressed with live plans: [Top 10 suggestions addressed in live plans|http://blogs.atlassian.com/2016/03/10-user-suggestions-addressed-in-portfolio-for-jira/] and join our [Portfolio Pioneers LinkedIn group|https://www.linkedin.com/groups/7018171] to discuss feedback and best practices!\r\n \r\nThanks,\r\nMartin Suntinger\r\n[msuntinger@atlassian.com|mailto:msuntinger@atlassian.com]\r\nPrincipal Product Manager, Portfolio for JIRA\r\n \r\n^*The live plans labs feature is available with Portfolio for JIRA 1.12 or higher. It is compatible with JIRA Software 7.0.5 or higher, and JIRA 6.3 or higher, in association with JIRA Agile 6.7.12 or higher.^\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\nCurrently, resources cannot be shared between plans. As the doc explains:\r\n\r\n\"plans are completely logically separate and do not consider in any way data from other plans. This means, that the same user could be booked in parallel plans for the same time slot.\"\r\n\r\nHere are some unfortunate consequences:\r\n\r\n* JPO could not be used by an organization of any size for global resource planning.\r\n* If one is trying to use JPO for an area with a number of independent projects and shared resources, there is no good solution:\r\n** If you throw everything into one big plan, you make \"plan updates\" problematic, since the results affect the entire plan and may need to be coordinated with many different people who are supposed to be working independently of each other - probably impractical. Furthermore, by mixing independent projects into one plan, you make the plan too \"big\" for comfort. (But it is true that JPO offers features like release streams and initiatives that help here. However, it looks like JPO might provide sub-plan objects like release streams to work around the problem that plans have to be bigger than they naturally would be, due to the fact that resource sharing is not possible. ).\r\n** If you create separate plans, you have problems allocating resources. You have to be careful to look at how a person is allocated in each plan to make sure the allocation doesn't exceed his total available hours. And you have make arrangements for him not being overbooked for a given period of time. All this without JPO support.\r\n\r\nI think the solution is to move the \"People\" feature out of the plan and into a bigger object - e.g. \"Organization\". Here one would specify people and allocate them for given periods of time to plans. The plans would then have to work with the resource constraints handed down from the organization.\r\n",

Right now my only choice to get up and running with Portfolio is to add each one of these to the project. This would be tedious but simple if I could filter on project and status (e.g. everything in the FOO project that is open or in progress) but unless I personally create that filter, I can't use a basic filter that is native to Jira.

This issue is being addressed as part of the all new Portfolio live plans, which feature an entirely overhauled and more seamless integration model with JIRA Software / Agile. Live plans are currently available as a labs feature for both Server* and Cloud, so you can start evaluating them without any risk of impacting existing Portfolio plans. They are not yet feature-complete, we're working on bringing all major capabilities of standard plans back into live plans on top of the new integration model before we graduate live plans out of labs and make them the new standard way of working. \r\nPlease check out this blog for a summary and short videos of how the top-voted suggestions are being addressed with live plans: [Top 10 suggestions addressed in live plans|http://blogs.atlassian.com/2016/03/10-user-suggestions-addressed-in-portfolio-for-jira/] and join our [Portfolio Pioneers LinkedIn group|https://www.linkedin.com/groups/7018171] to discuss feedback and best practices!\r\n \r\nThanks,\r\nMartin Suntinger\r\n[msuntinger@atlassian.com|mailto:msuntinger@atlassian.com]\r\nPrincipal Product Manager, Portfolio for JIRA\r\n \r\n^*The live plans labs feature is available with Portfolio for JIRA 1.12 or higher. It is compatible with JIRA Software 7.0.5 or higher, and JIRA 6.3 or higher, in association with JIRA Agile 6.7.12 or higher.^\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\nCurrently there are quite a number of customer requesting integration between JIRA Portfolio and JIRA Agile.\r\n\r\nFor example, version created in JIRA Agile can be synchronise to JIRA Portfolio so that they won't need to create again.
