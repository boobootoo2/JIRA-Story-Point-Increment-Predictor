      "description": "This issue was discovered while investigating an issue where Confluence 4.1.2 (using a Crowd 2.3.2/Embedded Crowd 1.3.3 stack) would fail to synchronize properly with a standalone Crowd 2.4.0.\r\n\r\nThe standalone Crowd server had multiple LDAP directories. Some usernames were found in more than one directory. This, in itself, was fine. However, some usernames used different capitalizations in different directories (i.e. one directory having a user with a username of \"foo.bar\", and another directory having a user with a username of \"Foo.Bar\").\r\n\r\nThe effect of this, was that these users would be synchronized *every* time Confluence and Crowd synchronized. It would work every second time, and fail every second time. The failure manifested as logged exceptions caused by uniqueness constraint violations in the database bubbled up through Hibernate to the app. The user-visible effect was that the synchronization failed silently every second time.\r\n\r\nIt seems some parts of the Crowd stack use case-insensitive comparison for usernames, and some use case-sensitive.",

And most of users in both directories are the same persons.\r\nAnd here I've got a problem. I have a lot of issues in JIRA and pages in Confluence which were created by users from JIRA directory. And now I want to make accounts from AD and JIRA to be merged for most of the users to keep history/backlog of all the issues/pages.\r\nSo for example issue KEY-123 was created by user gogalev@me.com (from JIRA/CROWD directory). But this user has an account in my AD - Grigoriy Lev. And my goal is to let user Grigoriy Lev become a pair to user gogalev@me.com and login to JIRA/Confluence under AD account and see issue KEY-123 as my own.\r\n\r\nPlease put in on your scheduler.",

I can do this, but it is a bummer, and took me a long time to figure out how to handle this.  The following code at the end of an execute method in an action can accomplish this (I wish this were in a guide, it would have saved me well over an hour of digging):\r\n\r\n{code}\r\n        ActionContext context = ActionContext.getContext();\r\n        context.put(\"templateSuffix\", \"ftl\");\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nSo just to conclude, the reason this is a major problem for a Crowd developer is there currently is NO way to distribute a .jar plugin that contains xwork actions and view templates that re-uses existing Crowd styles.  Freemarker is broken for the reasons I listed above, the Velocity result also prints out a laundry list of exceptions if you try to use it, and there is no way for me to package and deploy JSP files.",
