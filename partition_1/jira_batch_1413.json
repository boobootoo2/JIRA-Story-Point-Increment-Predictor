So the code would have to say something like:\r\n** Look for my help-links file locally.\r\n** If not found, look for my help-links file on Atlassian servers.\r\n** Having found my help-links file, look to see if there is a help link for my field (e.g. by field ID).\r\n** If no help link found, do not display help icon.\r\n** If help link found, collect the corresponding URL and display the help icon.\r\n\r\nThis way, we can dynamically add the help links as we build the documentation pages. And we can also allow our customers to supply their own help-links file e.g. if they have downloaded our docs and installed the docs on their own Confluence server (e.g. within a firewall).\r\n\r\nNOTE: At each major product release (1.1, 1.2, etc), the doc space on CAC is archived. The online help links will need to take the archiving process into account, because URLs will change. ",

Details\r\nAs per the [following documentation|https://confluence.atlassian.com/crowd041/configuring-caching-for-an-ldap-directory-1026041457.html] database caching for directories is preconfigured for 10,000 users and advises not to cache if you have more than that.\r\n{quote}\r\n*Be aware of the optimal number of users.* We have optimized the database caching for directories containing approximately 10 000 (ten thousand) users. If your directory is significantly larger, the new caching may not be as beneficial. For really large user bases, we recommend that you leave the caching disabled.\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nh4. Notes\r\n* For example with local groups enabled, it's not possible to disable caching so if you have more than 10,000 users you suffer extreme performance issues.\r\n** Eg; 80,000 users in a directory will synch up to 10,000 within minutes or an hr. The remaining 70,000, whilst eventually successful can take a full week to complete.\r\n\r\nThis makes it very hard to update user attributes such as usernames without a week long task or completely recreating their entire LDAP structure which is complicated with many directories and filers.\r\n\r\n* Please consider adding an option to adjust the default 10,000 user database cache especially when local groups are also enabled.",
