Problem\r\n\r\nJIRA Portfolio allows very fine-grained configuration and setup of plans, making sure that customers can adapt the tool to their complex planning requirements. However, this complexity leaves room for errors and often times it is difficult to figure out what may have been misconfigured.\r\n\r\nAs an example, there are a number of possible causes why a certain issue or issues do not show up in the plan. [This Atlassian Answers thread|https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/38390402/issues-not-showing-up-in-portfolio-live-plans] lists a number of them.\r\nh4. Suggestion\r\n\r\nFollowing the success of the [JIRA Admin Helper|https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiraserver071/jira-admin-helper-802593078.html], it would be very helpful to have a {{JIRA Portfolio Helper}} that could be used to determine the answers for the questions like (but not limited to):\r\n * Why does _X issue_ not show up in my Portfolio plan?\r\n * Why is my release _red_? (Suggestions on possible solutions)\r\n * What else would fit in this release with fixed release date?\r\n * Why does my capacity report show bottleneck?\r\n * What changes I need to make to my existing projects _X_ and _Y_ in order to see them on the same plan? (suggest on missing releases/fix versions, large delta between\u00a0teams' velocity, incompatible capacity measures)\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThrough this feature, customers could self-help and adjust issue sources accordingly, determine the logic behind specific scheduling \"decisions\" by the algorithm.",

Steps to Reproduce \r\n# Create a custom field such as a number field (Make sure it is not available on create, edit and view screens for your given project, but it is available for all projects (Project context: Global (all issues))\r\n# Add the custom field to your plan by going to Configure > Custom Fields > Add Custom Field\r\n# Update the custom field with a value and commit your changes\r\n# The issue in JIRA is now updated with a value for the custom field (visible in change history), even though the custom field is not available on view and update screen for issue. \r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results  \r\nPortfolio would not even show custom fields that are not associated with the project/filter\r\n\r\nh3.

Common practise when you have multiple teams is to have a Teams common field which you then assign Stories to.  I can't do this with the Portfolio field.\r\nSecondly in an enterprise there will be a lot of Teams, and I don't really want the entire list available to all project.  I usually setup a field context applied to projects which then has options on which are the available teams who can work on those projects.  That way there is a restricted list available in each project and its very difficult to choose an incorrect team.\r\n\r\n",

Problem Definition\r\n\r\nCurrently, there is an upper limit of 50 teams, 100 Projects and 5000 open issues per plan due to performance restriction.\u00a0\r\n\r\n!image-2016-10-14-14-16-33-277.png!\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nWe want to make this more scalable and allowing more project and issues per plan to support larger clients.\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nNone.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n{panel:title=Atlassian Update - 7 January 2018}\r\nHi All,\r\n\r\nThank you for commenting on this issue with your feedback. I\u2019d like to give you a quick update on this feature improvement.\u00a0We\u2019re continuously investigating solutions to improve performance, but loading & viewing a very large amount of issues at once is complex.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe issue & project limits most likely won't be extended in the next few months. The Reason is that we chose to invest most of our effort in simplifying the UI with a brand new design, details can be found\u00a0[here|https://community.atlassian.com/t5/Portfolio-for-Jira-articles/Introducing-a-new-planning-experience-in-Portfolio-for-Jira/ba-p/944996].\u00a0\r\n\r\nWe know that this is a major issue for some of you and longer term ( 12-18 months ) we will\u00a0 increase our efforts to extend these limits in a way that won\u2019t lower performance.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, I would advise customers to split their work streams into different plans. You could use the\u00a0[Programs feature|https://confluence.atlassian.com/jiraportfolioserver/programs-931037964.html]\u00a0to get an aggregated view of multiple plans, for basic reporting functionality. \u00a0\r\n\r\nRoi Fine | Product Manager\u00a0\r\n{panel}",

Most of the tasks were not assigned to releases when I created the plan. It would take ~18 months to complete all the existing work. I'm most concerned with sorting out our priorities for the next three months. It's frustrating that the only way to view the next three months on the timeline has the side-effect of hiding from the scope view those epics which Portfolio says I won't be touching in those three months. It makes it very hard to adjust the releases and dependencies for issues so that the plan tells my team what to work on first.",

With a normal link, or even epic link, it is possible to run JQL to find all linked issues where the parent issue meets certain criteria - for enterprise this is absolutely critical.\r\n * It's not possible to update the field via scripts, it's possible to do this for epic links\r\n * It's not possible to use add ons like Structure to build hierarchies as this isn't a real link type\r\n * It's not possible to use this field for any kind of reporting outside of JIRA as it doesn't extract the issue key\r\n\r\nThis basically means the current implementation of the field/JQL is only useful if you want to find the epics linked to known parent initiatives, which only works if you have a small set of initiatives to work with - we have thousands, and cannot currently create a background link to use for searching when a \"parent link\" is created because we can't access the field value via scripts.\r\n\r\nPlease feel free to contact me if you would like more information about our use cases.",

Therefore although they may have a sprint associated in JIRA side, the sprint information will not be recognized by Portfolio unless a team is assigned to the issue.

That is, when you try to search for parents in JIRA's Create or Edit issue dialogs, this may lead to memory problems on larger instances. This problem is aggravated by the fact that every keystroke triggers a new search request.\r\nAnother problem is the related search for Portfolio child issues. This is triggered when opening issues above story level in Portfolio.\r\n\r\n*Workaround*\r\nTo stop this problem from re-occurring, remove the Portfolio parent link field from all screens in your JIRA instance to keep people from triggering the parent search which is the suspected source of trouble.\r\nThere is currently no workaround available to prevent the child issue search.\r\n\r\nWe are working on this issue with highest priority and should be able to provide a fix soon.

This is very useful, but for Epics and other parent issues that do not have a continuous schedule of implementing work underneath it, it can sometimes be misleading not being able to drill down to the child issues on the schedule view.\r\nFor example, an Epic may have one story in sprint 1 (a spike) and all it's remaining stories in sprints 20, 21 and 22, but the Epic schedule view will just show a single bar starting in sprint 1 and ending in sprint 22. It would be very useful if you could visualise the underlying work in some way, either by having the option to expand and view the child issues on the schedule, or by shading/adjusting the thickness of the issue bar to illustrate where the underlying work actually is.",

Motivation\r\n\r\nAs a Product Owner I want to have more control over the Roadmap generated by JIRA Portfolio 2.0 to achieve the most useful and informative results for my stakeholders.\r\nh3. Background\r\n\r\nThe idea of generating data driven roadmaps via JIRA Portfolio 2.0 is awesome. Unfortunately the scheduler behaves \"too smart\" from time to time. Especially when it decides to prepone tickets that were prioritized lower for the sake of filling up sprints and to optimize capacity workload across sprints. The workaround of using dependencies is troublesome since you might end up chaining a lot of tickets to prevent JIRA Portfolio 2.0 to prepone some other tickets which is even lower in the backlog.\r\n\r\nAlso the automatic assignment of Teams to a Story or Epic is more often a burden than of\u00a0help.\r\n\r\nIt's ok, that these functionalities are there. But I would love them to be optional and use only the criteria that I need.",

Problem\r\n\r\nCurrently there is no daily scheduling within Scrum sprints or hourly schedule within Kanban projects.\r\n\r\nPortfolio tries to solve a scheduling problem involving humans in a domain where stories are known to be difficult to estimate.\r\n When the story estimates are precise and stories are dependent on the results of previous stories in a sequential manner, Portfolio is not able to schedule accurately.\r\n\r\nIf on a Kanban project, short dependent stories that are meant to be sequential, they can be either scheduled concurrently (if resources are available) or on different days.\r\n In Scrum projects, dependent stories will either be scheduled concurrently (if resources are available) or on different sprints. There is no sub-sprint granularity.\r\n\r\nAs an scheduler, I'd like stories with dependencies to be scheduled after the completion of the blocking story but in the same sprint or day if resources permit.\r\nh2. Configuration Examples:\r\n\r\nWhen using Portfolio in Scrum mode:\r\n * With Dependent Story Constraint switched on, dependant stories can't be in the same sprint, even if they have a short duration.\r\n * With Dependant Story Constraint switched off, the blocked story won't start before the dependant story but stories may be scheduled concurrently, so the dependant stories may be scheduled by Portfolio before the dependant story is complete and can actually be worked on.\r\n\r\nWhen using Portfolio in Kanban mode:\r\n * With Dependent Story Constraint switched on, dependant stories are scheduled the next day, disregarding the estimates. 3 dependent stories of 1h are scheduled in 3 different days.\r\n * With Dependant Story Constraint switched off, dependent stories may be scheduled concurrently and 3 dependent stories of 6h scheduled in the same 8h day if resources allow.\r\n\r\nThe ON option doesn't allow for stories to be scheduled in a sequential manner with a granularity of hours.\r\n The OFF option is expected to ignore story completion dependency.\r\nh2. Suggestion:\r\n\r\nI'd like an option to enforce more granularity, so the schedule is done on an hourly basis for Kanban and daily basis for Scrum.\r\n Alternatively: a configurable timespan (week or sprint) to calculate at a higher granularity.\r\nh2. Notes:\r\n\r\nThe time granularity is a linear factor in the complexity of the scheduling algorithm and increases will cause slowness when calculating the schedule.\r\nh2. Use cases:\r\n * Sequential stories for operational Kanban teams. Some stories are done manually and others automated and normally short (1h). Estimates are precise.\r\n * Scrum teams that have well planned dependencies that form a chain of concurrent stories that may or may not fit the sprint.",

Summary\r\n\r\nWhen a JIRA Portfolio Plan is connected to an existing project where, in order to create an issue, the following fields are *Required* under that Project's Field Configuration:\r\n\r\n* *Description* field\r\n* Another field, such as a test custom field\r\n\r\nWhen committing a change, such as a new Epic/Story/etc., the Set Required Fields Screen will be brought up so that the user may populate that other required field. In the process, the *Description* field is also brought up but it does not retain the description that may have been added in Portfolio.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe issue cannot be created without the user repopulating the Description again since it is a required field.\r\n\r\nh3. Environment\r\n* JIRA 7.1.6\r\n* Portfolio 2.0.6\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n# Create a new project\r\n# Create a new custom field (e.g. \"Test\", which is a Single Line Text Field)\r\n# Configure the project's field configuration so that *Description* and *Test* are +Required+\r\n# Create a new plan and associate it with this project\r\n# Create a new Epic and give it a description in Portfolio\r\n# Commit the change\r\n\r\nAt this point, you will find that the issue isn't automatically created since the user needs to populate *Test*. *Description* will be blank. Cannot proceed with creating the issue until *Description* is populated again.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nDescription should be retained from Portfolio into the Set Required Fields screen during the commit. Completing the commit should create the issue with the Description.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nDescription is not retained in the Set Required Fields screen during the commit.\r\n \r\nh3.Workaround\r\nEither:\r\n\r\n1. Repopulate the description at the Set Required Fields screen\r\nor\r\n2. Set Description to be Optional in the project's field configuration, which will prevent it from coming up during the Set Required Fields screen. The description is retained at the time of issue creation this way.",
