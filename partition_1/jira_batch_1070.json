It also won't warn admin from which Epic they belong to, making the process confusing. The video below better demonstrates the problem:\r\n\r\n [^JRACLOUD-73590.mp4] \r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n# Have a Next-gen project with 2 Epics (Epic 1 and Epic 2) and 2 child issues from the same issue type, one belonging to each Epic (Task 1 belongs to Epic 1 and Task 2 belongs to Epic 2, for example);\r\n# start the process of bulk moving all issues from the Next-gen project to another one;\r\n# Reach the screen to select which issue goes to which project.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nJira will either group the issue type in just a single line or will inform admins to which Epic that issue belongs to.\r\nGiven that, at this moment, the loss of Epic <> child relationship will happen in this process (of moving issues from the Next-gen project to the classic one), it would be better if Jira simply groups all issue types in a single line. According to our [Migrate between next-gen and classic projects|https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirasoftwarecloud/migrate-between-next-gen-and-classic-projects-957974933.html]:\r\n{quote}\r\n*Jira moves your epics across if you map them to an epic issue type in your new project. But, you'll lose the relationship between your epics and their child issues. The child issues themselves will sill exist, but the links between them won't.*\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nJira shows multiple lines for the same issue type, making the process confuse.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\nThere is no workaround for this scenario. Despite no data will be loss, this just confuses admins.",

      "description": "h3. Issue Summary\r\nMany times when using JQL users want to sort issues in a specific way.  While the Order By operators will allow users to sort all the results in either ascending or descending order, it forces all issues with null values on the order field to be placed at the end or beginning depending on the direction.   It would be very helpful to instead have some kind of hierarchical sorting method to order the first set of issues, and then a second order by to then arrange the other sets of issues that might have null values for the first search.\r\n\r\nThere is a great example of this problem that might help explain it better.  Let's say you want a single JQL query to return all Epics, and all issues in those Epics, and you want JQL to order these in a manner such as:\r\n\r\n{code:borderStyle=solid}\r\nEpic 1\r\n- Task 1\r\n- Task 2\r\nEpic 2\r\n- Task 3\r\nEpic 3\r\n- Task 4 \r\n{code}\r\n\r\nThere lies a problem in trying to do this.  You can return all these issues in one query such as\r\ntype=epic or \"Epic Link\" is not empty Order by \"Epic Link\"\r\n\r\nThis returns those issues, but since Epics themselves don't actually have an epic link value for that field, they are always getting sorted to the bottom.  You could alternatively try to order by \"Epic Name\", but since the other issues in the query don't actually have an Epic Name value for themselves, you can't order them by that either.  \r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\nIt would be helpful if there was either a group by function like sql has, or perhaps some other means to first order the first set of issues (epics), and then order by the second set while ignoring null values in the first order statement.\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Why this is a problem\r\nWould be a helpful means to organize information.\r\n",

Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n# Add an inline image in the Description field of an issue on the old issue view, using wiki markup such as {noformat}!image.png!{noformat} Make sure the image file is not currently attached to the issue. The description will be rendered as \"Unable to render embedded object: File (image.png) not found\".\r\n\r\n# Attach the missing image file to the issue and refresh the old issue view. The inline image should be displayed correctly. \r\n\r\n# Switch to the new issue view. The attachment will not display correctly:\r\n !Attachment.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\nThis is a problem because when you create an issue using the REST API, you cannot pass attachments to the POST /rest/api/2/issue endpoint, so you first pass the Description as a wiki-markup string, and only after can you add the related attachments. Which means inline attachments will show just fine on the newly created issue under the old issue view, but not under the new issue view.\r\nSame thing of course if you set the Description field using the PUT API. You'd need to first make sure to copy all the required attachments, which is not intuitive.\r\n\r\nh3.

Issue Summary\r\nIn some supported browsers, across OS platforms, the left side project navigation menu in Jira Cloud can have a tendency to clip some text along the bottom.

Steps to Reproduce\r\nWhile this can be more visible when using a browsers zoom function, it is not exclusively seen when changing zoom.
