When I click the \"commit\" button, I want to look over my changes and come up with an appropriate commit message. But instead of seeing the changes staged for the commit, by default SourceTree shows me the _unstaged_ changes in the right-hand panel.\r\n\r\nThis is very confusing, as many times a day I mistakenly believe that I am about to commit the wrong changes!\r\n\r\nI might humbly suggest that clicking the Commit button should default the right panel to displaying the _staged_ changes. What do you think?\r\n\r\nThis would make my life a tiny bit better, and I think other SourceTree users as well.\r\n\r\nCheers! Best,\r\n\r\nBrian Christian",
