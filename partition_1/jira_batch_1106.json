There is an open [Feature Request|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-1450] that directs admins to [this workaround|https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiraserver073/archiving-a-project-861253768.html], which consists of removing all permissions from everyone. In the previous UI, a hidden project would only be accessible to admins when they access JIRA's settings (Cog icon -> projects), but wouldn't be accessible through trivial navigation (non settings screens). With the new UI, admins who have the \"Administer JIRA\" global permission can view a \"hidden\" project through non settings screens. This is misleading because when an admin click on the hidden's project name, they are greeted with a \"Project not found\" screen.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Archive a project;\r\n# Click on JIRA's icon on the sidebar (top left corner);\r\n# Click on the archived project.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n* As the admin is not on a setting screen, the archived project should not be visible.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n* The archived project is visible on a trivial navigation screen.\r\n\r\n !Hidden project showing on normal navigation.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\n !Project not found screen.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\n* The archived project should only be viewable on a setting screen.\r\n\r\n !Project settings.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\nh3.

Suggested Solution\r\nRemove the ability to rearrange the \"issue type\" field when configuring a create screen or, at least, place a banner warning admins that the position of this field won't be changed when configuring a create screen.\r\n\r\nh3. Why this is important\r\nEnhance the user experience.

So, I have to click to close the notification before I can make the next change. It is\u00a0*very* annoying.\r\n\r\n!JIRA.png!\r\n\r\nMy suggestion would be to move it to the center of the page, where there are no buttons that can be covered. Or even move it further up from where it currently is, so that it sits at the very top (even at the top edge) of the page and not further down, where it covers the buttons.\r\n\r\nAlso, it can be a lot quicker. After all, people don't read it. You just see something green quickly pop up and disappear\u00a0which means \"yay! no error. change saved\". The current notification is painfully slow to come in and go away.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I wouldn't be opposed to getting rid of it completely.\u00a0\r\n\r\nPlease! I beg you.

This was something that you could do in ADG2.\r\nWhile you can sort by favorite, name, owner, or popularity, these are only then sorted alphabetically either ascending or descending.  There is no option to create a customized order as to how these appear on the list of dashboards.\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\nAllow users to custom sort these by bringing back the up/down buttons.   I imagine there could be some unseen ordered number list that corresponds to each dashboard entry that would updated when changing these.  This could be thought of as an additional column called something like 'custom order'.   Since the new ADG3 seems to offer more, but different ways to sort, we obviously don't want to lose the new features in the process of implementing this one, but by the same token, we would want to be able to sort in a custom method as well.\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Why this is important\r\nThis is something that ADG2 had.  As you can see from the buttons, there are up/down buttons that could be used to change the order of the dashboards.   When you have a lot of dashboards, it becomes really important to have different ways to sort these in order to be able to organize your information and navigate to it quickly.  I realize my example here only shows 2 dashboard entries, but imagine this with several dozen dashboards instead. \r\n\r\n*ADG2 dashboard:*\r\n !dashboardorder.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\n*ADG3 dashboard*\r\n !dashnewUI.png|thumbnail! \r\n",
