Problem: Excel (at least the german version) does know know how to sum \"2 days\" and \"5 days\" because those are Strings, not numbers.\n\nFor the Created and Updated columns it might be sufficient to do the i18n correctly. Right now I get a mix of german words and english notation: \"8/Mai/03\". If I change that to the correct german notation \"8.

But we discovered that if, for instance, you estimate that a task will take 1 day, and then log 4 hours, it says you have 20 hours of work remaining.  Who works 24 hours a day?\n\nSo, we decided to ignore days, and work strictly in hours.  By now, we had realized that 6 hours of actual programming time per day is more realistic than 8.  So, instead of estimating that a task would take 2 days, we said it would take 12 hours.  So far, so good.  But then we entered a large task which we estimated would take 30 hours (5 days).  The next time we looked at the issue, it had a time estimate of 1 day, 6 hours.\n\nOur next try is to start using minutes to track hours, since we can go up to 60 before it starts recalculating on us.  But now when we make printouts or link with other project teams, it looks like we have a whole bunch of tasks that we're expecting to finish in 6 minutes each.\n\nIdeally, it would be nice to be able to configure how many hours are in an ideal work day.  It would suffice to be able to turn off the units and work with raw numbers.\n\nThanks.",

As you can see from the history, this issue has been open for almost 12 years, yet I do not expect it to be on the JIRA team's roadmap in the foreseeable future. It is unlikely we will resolve it as described in the original request.\r\n\r\nThe easiest way to view issues that you have looked at recently is to use the [issueHistory() function|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Advanced+Searching+Functions#AdvancedSearchingFunctions-issueHistory()]. This is easily accessible by clicking \"More...\" under the \"Recent Issues\" section of the Issues menu.\r\n\r\nIf you find yourself needing to frequently track issues you have commented on, we recommend [enabling the \"autowatch\" preference|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Commenting+on+an+Issue].\r\n\r\nAlternatively, this function has been implemented in a number of JIRA add-ons:\r\n\r\n* [JQL Pro|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/jql-pro]\r\n* [Your JQL & Workflow Tools|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/pt.lt.lfcribeiro.jira.jqlLTFunctions]\r\n* [AM Utils|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/ru.andreymarkelov.atlas.plugins.utils]\r\n* [JQL Tricks Plugin|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.j-tricks.jql-plugin]\r\n\r\nAs is the case with all issues on jira.atlassian.com, closing this issue does not mean this functionality will never be a part of JIRA by default. However, the JIRA product management team is making an effort to make jira.atlassian.com a more valuable tracking tool by closing the issues that we do not expect to work on in the reasonably foreseeable future.\r\n\r\nAs always, please do not hesitate to contact me directly with questions.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nDave Meyer\r\nJIRA Product Manager\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\n*Original request description:*\r\n\r\nHi,\r\n\r\nOur users would like to search on issues he has added comments to.  It would be a handy way to choose issues to be watched.\r\n\r\nWe can currently search on text within comments, but not filter on comment-authors.\r\n\r\nIn the filter page, perhaps as one of the attribute fields, there could be a field for \"Includes Comment By\".\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nSteve\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nStephen Butler, Software Logistics Dept.\r\nSOLINET GmbH Solutions for Innovative Networks\r\nMittlerer Pfad 26, 70499 Stuttgart, Germany\r\nTel +49 711 1398 1357, Fax +49 711 866 1240 ",

It's important to see at a glance which issues are New Features, Improvements, Tasks, and so on.  Likewise, we need to be able to tell the relationships between issues, as indicated by Issue Links.\n\nThe most obvious solution is to set up an appropriate filter and go to Full Content to print them out.  However, this is only useful if Full Content can be configured to display Issue Type and Issue Links.\n\nOtherwise, we have to print the detail page for each issue separately, which is extremely tedious when we have dozens of issues, not to mention wasteful.\n\n(BTW, I think JIRA is a great product, and well suited for our needs - especially if we can get a few things tweaked, like this one.)",

In this project we use JIRA as a task list for the individual project members.  We create issues of type Task and assign them to the person in charge.  Usually we want to associate a \"due date\" with the task.\n\nAt first we solved this by adding a custom field \"Due Date\".  This was not quite satisfactory as we can't filter using this custom field.  Instead we now schedule the tasks with specific project versions.  The problem with this approach, however, is that a future version can't have a scheduled release date (which would be the due date for the issues fixed by that version).\n\nI think it would be reasonable to have a way to specify a scheduled release date for a project's unreleased versions.",
