It is hilarous to me how difficult it is for a user to find where the description of each project is displayed. It would be perfect if it came up when hovering over the project name anywhere in the GUI, but especially in the Projects gadget.\n\nI understand that using tips this way may provide a challenge for screen readers and other accessibility mechanisms. If this is the case, you could make it a per-user preference to select whether tips were used simply for help or much more usefully for contextual information.\n\nThis is related to a similar suggestion I made in JRA-21299.",

Your feedback is key to helping us understand how you use JIRA so we can continue improving your experience. We have reviewed this issue over the last few days.\n\nWhile we don't have any plans to introduce generic support for renaming any system field, we are very sensitive to the feedback that much of the terminology in JIRA is unfriendly to non-technical users. We're actively exploring ways to alleviate this in the future.\n\nIt's important to understand that we rarely try to implement individual features from jira.atlassian.com, but instead take a holistic look at the problem and use feedback from the comments here and a [dozen other sources|https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/110373/how-does-the-jira-team-use-jira-atlassian-com] of customer input to solve the core problems.\n\nPlease don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or feedback.\n \nRegards,\nDave Meyer\ndmeyer@atlassian.com\nProduct Manager, JIRA Platform\n{panel}\n\nThis also includes renaming 'Priority' to 'Severity' as some customers prefer to use severity.\n",

It results in a call to UserUtilImpl.getGroup with a null group (which I guess, but am not sure is supposed to represent the Anyone group). This in turn may throw an exception, depending on what is backing it.\n\nLuckily it is unusual for people to grant admin access to Anyone, so this is unlikely to affect too many customers.\n\nThe workaround is to replace the Anyone group where it is used in the permissions scheme with a group containing all users.\n\n\n\nAn example stack trace that occurs in this situation is (though I doubt

On the issue detail screen, you shouldn't have to click ellipses to see the whole values - this should be the screen to see it all. I saw this specifically with the components and cc fields; I'm not sure where else it collapses in that way, and an extra click is required to see the information.\n\n2. When on a subtask's issue detail screen, the way the parent ticket name, parent key, and the subtask's issue key is displayed, they are hard to read, because of the size, spacing and punctuation. It ends up not being easy to tell what those different bits mean the way it's laid out right now.\n\n3. This is more general, but I have found that for many of our tickets, in the new look you now have to scroll or scroll farther to see all the information before the comments/tabbed area begins.\n3a.

Your feedback is key to helping us understand how you use JIRA so we can continue improving your experience. We have reviewed this issue over the last few days; unfortunately we don't have any plans to support this in JIRA for the foreseeable future.\n\nHere at Atlassian, in situations where we need reports with more complex layouts, we either use Confluence pages or [Atlasboard|http://atlasboard.bitbucket.org/] (for wallboards).\n\nPlease remember that jira.atlassian.com is one of many inputs for the JIRA roadmap. You can [learn more about our process here|https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/110373/how-does-the-jira-team-use-jira-atlassian-com].\n \nI understand that our decision may be disappointing. Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.\n \nRegards,\nDave Meyer\ndmeyer@atlassian.com\nProduct Manager, JIRA Platform\n{panel}\n\nIt would be great that the dashboard layout would be more flexible or more types. In the actual version, it is only columns, but it would be great that it allowed like an upper a lower row, that would extend acrross all the dashboard. Some gadgets look better all acrros the webpage and other work better on single columns (it allows us to make comparisons). A mix of those would be great",

In short a custom field that does not contain any input at all, just a snip of text where i might insert HTML or simple instructions about the issue the user is about to create. \n\nWhat would be the best practice for this?

As soon as jfreechart has sent it out to someone it deletes it. This causes problems in IE6 which seems to have a bug(?) where it sometimes requests the same image twice in a row. This results in the second request getting a 404 (since jfreechart already deleted it).\n\njfreechart also supports \"per-session\" images. We just need to pass in the HttpSession instead of null and jfreechart will keep the image around for the session.\n\nAndreas thinks this change was supposed to have happened in 4.0.x but it appears to have fallen through the cracks.

I have a good idea of what I'd like the system to do but would like a bit more reference/procedural material to help me set it up correctly from the start.\n \nThe page http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/EHOSTING/JIRA+Hosted+101 is superb - I love how you've made it possible to scan down the page using expandable links and I think the \"Why would I do this?\" question is a fantastic device! \n \nMy request is for more information (though not necessarily for hosted services customers only):\n \n1. General recommendations for setup - Include an overall workflow for new customers. Perhaps a flow diagram as well?\nwhat you need to do and in what order. i.e. create project first, adopt or redesign issues? add users first? design project roles first?  What not to do before another task.\n \n2. Personally, I have to set up this situation on a hosted system so I was looking for some more complex scenario documentation than that currently available.\n\n    *\n      e.g. For example when allocating 6 users to 3 different projects but giving them different roles in each project. Some users work in all three, some in just two. Two projects need to allow cross-project linking.\n    *\n      My PM wants to be able to export some issue data to export into another database - what do I need to do to facilitate this?\n\n \n3. What are schemes really designed for? What should I watch out for when setting one up? Why does the system display both the default and the customised scheme within a given project?\n \n4. Give a breakdown of a small part of a workflow and explain a typical design - what's mandatory, purpose is served by a transition,   \n \n5. If I delete a default issue etc, how can I retrieve it?\n \n6. The whole area of the default settings and how they can be customised is a bit confused especially as a given project is displayed as using a \"default...\" as well as a  \".<customised> scheme\". I cannot distinguish which settings are coming from each source and would like to understand how the customised bits work... superimposed over template default?  how the default plays into a project nevertheless?. \n \n   default groups needs more clarification - for example:\n\n    *\n      a detailed table about what each of the default groups can do.\n    *\n      for instance why don't my new users receive a username/password email?\n    *\n      When I click jira-developers in the default browser, I see that there are \"no permisssions/notifications/issue security or saved filters associated with this group\"  yet members of that group do receive notifications. How is that explained?\n    *\n      what are the advantages of setting up my own groups and what should I watch out for\n\n \nHope this makes sense.\n \nHaving said that, I think JIRA is remarkably well designed. It has such a great, simple and consistent interface. And it's got extensive help! - I love the fact I can communicate feedback to the author! \nBut am trying to get the hang of organising the system to suit our needs and struggling a bit.\n \nThanks, Celia \n",

The iframe would contain a page in JIRA. The victim would believe he was clicking on the other site but would actually be clicking in JIRA and performing actions he didn't intend.\n\nIt enables attackers to perform many actions in our apps, provided that:\n    * The victim has an active session or \"remember me\" is set, and\n    * The victim can be tricked into clicking or typing into an innocent-looking page element on a third-party site.\n\nIt requires no XSS vulnerability in JIRA in order to exploit.\n\nTwitter's solution to this was to include a line of JavaScript at the top of every page to break out of frames. This might not work as a broad-scale solution for us (GreenHopper and gadgets both use iframes legitimately) but could be used for administration pages at least.\n\nThis threat could be partially mitigated by requiring two clicks for any major administration action. e.g. Currently you can go directly to the project deletion confirmation page and delete a project in one click. If the confirmation page was also XSRF-protected (not just the deletion action itself), it would behave the same for an end-user but would be harder for an attacker to exploit.\n\n-----------\n\nExample attack: This button on some random website gives no indication of malice:\n\n!Clickjack1.png!\n\nBut clicking on it actually deletes a project in JIRA:\n\n!Clickjack2.png!\n\nThe example HTML for this attack is attached; just insert the ID of the project you want to delete into the iframe URL, and use with caution!",

Your input in the comments helps us understand how this affects you and what you're hoping to accomplish with JIRA.\n\nAt this time, this suggestion is not on the JIRA development roadmap, but there's always the possibility an engineer will pick this up for a ShipIt project. Additionally, if you are using JIRA Server, we recommend the [JIRA Syntax Highlighter Plugin|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/jira.plugin.syntaxhighlighter.macro.syntaxplugin]. We are working with the developer of that plugin to support macros in Atlassian Connect, which will allow him to bring it to JIRA Cloud.\n\nPlease remember that jira.atlassian.com is one of many inputs for the JIRA roadmap. You can [learn more about our process here|https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/110373/how-does-the-jira-team-use-jira-atlassian-com].\n\nI understand that our decision may be disappointing. Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.\n\nRegards,\nDave Meyer\n[dmeyer@atlassian.com|mailto:dmeyer@atlassian.com]\nProduct Manager, JIRA Platform\n{panel}\n\nSupport for the C, C++, C#, and Visual Basic languages would be particularly useful.",

This requires the user to have a token that will generate the one-time passwords. However, several software tokens now run on cell phones, so this is less of a burden these days. This also requires an ability to configure JIRA with the token's secret hex key, which amounts to adding a new field in the edit user page.\n\nInstead of using only their password to login, the user would enter their password followed by the one-time password generated by the token. The JIRA authentication code would compute the same one-time password to verify. The algorithm is simple and open source versions exist.\n\nExamples of software out there using the OATH algorithm (these happen to be written by me):\n* [OATH Token|http://oathtoken.googlecode.com/] for iPhone\n* [mod_authn_otp|http://mod-authn-otp.googlecode.com/] Apache authentication module.\n\n",

And when you look at the documentation for the object, com.atlassian.jira.project.ProjectManager, it says that most of the functionality has been deprecated in V4.0 and that you should use com.atlassian.jira.bc.project.component.ProjectComponentManager instead.

I am not sure about the other two.\n\nAre there tools to do that. Basically if one group creates an issue in Quality Center, it should automatically be routed to the developer in JIRA.

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-20702].\n  {panel}\n\nMy team is currently working on an interface between a Lotus Notes application and JIRA. The Notes application will create remote JIRA tickets, and we'd like to know if there's a way to retrieve the list of options for selectable fields (Select List, Multi Select and Components) through the RPC API. I've been browsing through the Atlassian forums and the web, but haven't had luck with finding any info so far.\n\nAny input will be greatly appreciated. I set the Priority to 'Critical' because we really need to sort this out in order to successfully implement our interface.\n\nThanks in advance!!!",

As far as I\u2019ve seen they are not available through the API\nyet.\n\nCould you please add them? I need them very urgently and I guess it makes no\nsense to create a new plugin just for retrieving these elementary fields.\nProbably it\u2019s just adding the getters to the class and extending the columns\nof the select.\n\nIn case you cannot add them, could you please provide me a hint if you know\nsomebody who can build a plugin for me or where I could download e.g. the\ncurrent plugin source to extend it?\n \nThanks a lot! (I need to retrieve these 3 fields very urgently.)\n\n \n\nMit freundlichen Gr\u00fc\u00dfen / Best Regards\n\nMichael Kubert, Dipl.-Inform.\n\n\n \n\n",
