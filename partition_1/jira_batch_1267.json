[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-27972].\n  {panel}\n\nWhen debugging a suspected GreenHopper performance issue in OnDemand, I did some profiling on an instance to get to the root of the problem. It looks as though the Flowdock for JIRA plugin is doing some very expensive PropertySet creation in an IssueEventListener. This might not have been picked up on in regular JIRA usage, as most of the time IssueEvents are fired for only a single issue (create, update, etc). However GreenHopper updates multiple issues at a single time in a loop, and the slowdown caused by this extra code is very noticeable.\n\nOnDemand instances bundle the Flowdock for JIRA plugin by default. Thus this could be a big problem for a lot of customers. Note that I tried to disable the plugin to see if the problem went away, but it still persisted.\n\nHere is the thread profile from New Relic:\n\n{noformat}\n    100.0%  - java.lang.Thread.run\n        152 Collapsed methods (show)\n            97.0%  -

[See the corresponding bug report|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-27971].\n  {panel}\n\nWhilst working on JRADEV-10913 I encountered a bug which I could reproduce only in IE9 (didn't try IE8 yet).\n\nAttached is a dataset which is based on JIRA5.0_QAData.zip in which I created a simple qa-like workflow to help me reproduce the the bug in JRADEV-10913. This, and my lack of experience in setting up workflows, screens, etc, may well be the cause of the issue. However this sort of error should preferably not occur due to user error.\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n\nIn IE9: \n- Restore attached data\n- Create an issue in the QA project\n- Transition the newly created issue to \"In Progress\" by clicking Workflow -> Start Progress\n- Click \"QA Time\"\n- Enter a tester name and submit the form.\n-- Please note that sometimes the transition buttons under the Ops Bar do not update.

Most users assume the comment will be associated and displayed with the attachment, like a caption on a picture.\n\nHowever, in the Comment tab panel (which is the default, in our installation at least), the comments and the attachments are displayed separately - there is no way to tell from a comment which attachment it refers to, nor even that it refers to any attachment! And conversely there is no way to see, from the list of attachments, the comment that was entered with each.\n\nIt also means that you have comments that don't make sense (e.g. \"stacktrace\") because they were written as if they were a label for the attachment rather than a stand-alone comment.\n\nAttached screenshots on this issue show the orphaned comments and attachments.\n\nThe \"Activity\" tab panel now shows the association between comments and attachments. But who, faced with the above situation, would guess that they needed to click on \"Activity\" in order to solve the problem?\n\nRequested fixes, in order of preference:\n\n1) In Comments tab panel, for each attachment show the associated comment (possibly a collapsed, expandable summary); and for each comment that has an attachment, show the filename as a link to the attachment. OR,\n\n2) For each attachment comment and attachment in the Comments tab panel, show some indicator of an association (e.g. an icon), a tooltip that tells the user there is an associated comment/attachment, and a clear instruction on how to find out what the associated comment/attachment is (e.g. click on the Activity tab at the top of the Activity section of the page). OR,\n\n3) When asking the user to enter a comment, notify them prominently that there will be no association displayed (in the default panel) between their comment and the thing they're commenting on, so they need to make the association explicit in the comment (e.g., \"Attaching foo.txt, the error log from bar.exe\").\n",

This figures above were obtained by running the re-index 5 times with and without the query cache enabled.\n\nWhile our testing involved disabling the MySQL query cache completely in the server, I believe the same effect can obtained by having Jira pre-fix all indexing {{SELECT}} queries to the DB with \"{{SQL_NO_CACHE}}\"\n[http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/query-cache-in-select.html]\n\nThe Jira re-indexing process can detect the fact that MySQL is being used via JDBC, and use the \"{{SQL_NO_CACHE}}\" prefix accordingly.\n\nPlease note our testing was done on MySQL 5.1, so I can't speak to the benefits of this change on 5.5/5.6\nAlso in case it's not obvious, this fix will only benefit those users who already have the MySQL query cache enabled.\n\nFWIW, the same principle above may apply to other DB-intensive scenarios where little to no queries will be the same. So it's possible bulk operations and the integrity checker may benefit from this change also.\n\nAll testing performed on Jira 4.4.4 ",

Your feedback is key to helping us understand how you use JIRA so we can continue improving your experience. We have reviewed this issue over the last few days; unfortunately we don't have any plans to support this in JIRA for the foreseeable future.\n\nPlease remember that jira.atlassian.com is one of many inputs for the JIRA roadmap. You can [learn more about our process here|https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/110373/how-does-the-jira-team-use-jira-atlassian-com].\n \nI understand that our decision may be disappointing. Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.\n \nRegards,\nDave Meyer\ndmeyer@atlassian.com\nProduct Manager, JIRA Platform\n{panel}\n\n\n*Original issue description:*\n\n\nThis ticket is a carryover from JRA-24213. In the related ticket, we were able to analyse and implemented the following features in JIRA 5.0.3:\n\n{quote}\n1. Migrating whole directories:\n1.1 Internal to Internal with Delegated Auth\n1.2 Internal with Delegated Auth to Internal\n{quote}\n\nHowever it did not cover the following migration features:\n{quote}\n2. Migrating users from one directory to another:\n2.1 Individually\n2.2 All users in a directory\n{quote}\nIt is an essential feature to some of our customer who use  user directories other than Delegated Auth and the resolution in JRA-24213 doesn't solve their problem.\n\nh3.

Problem is that the JiraActionFactory does this\n\n\n            final String actionSimpleName = actionClass.getSimpleName();\n            final AutowireCapableWebworkActionRegistry autowireCapableWebworkActionRegistry = getAutowireCapableWebworkActionRegistry();\n            if (autowireCapableWebworkActionRegistry.containsAction(actionSimpleName))\n            {\n                    action = autowireCapableWebworkActionRegistry.getPlugin(actionSimpleName).autowire(actionClass);\n\n\nI am not sure why this is done.  I think there is a real reason for shortening a perfectly good fully qualified name into a short name.  So much so that Andreas said this on checkin\n\nJRA-16120 & CR-JRA-49: AutowireCapableRegistry now registers by classname only and no longer takes packages into consideration. This means we can get rid of the WebworkPackageResolver.\n\nSo I think we have a name space problem in JIRa where plugin actions can not ONLY share the same command name but they cannot shared the same simple class name.\n",

However, \\{noformat\\} also strips out text wrapping, which can make text blocks very difficult to read.\n\nIn my opinion, \"wrap\" is not entirely a format, it's more of a display constraint. I believe the only time you want to avoid wrapping is when the content includes some space-formatted lines that need vertical alignment as well as horizontal (e.g. a space-formatted table).  In my experience, that's definitely not the majority use case.\n\nPlease implement text wrapping as the default behaviour for \\{noformat\\} blocks, and perhaps add *{{wrap=false}}* as a configurable option for those rare cases when wrapping is not desired.",

However, when editing, the values are sorted by Username instead. This causes problems in systems where the usernames are significantly different than full names. There's no easy way to determine which username matches which full name. Because the sorting is not consistent, you can't simply note the position of the full name on the view screen and then remove that username on the edit screen because the users are not guaranteed to be in the same order.\n\nAn example of this would be three users:\n\n||Full Name||Username\n|Brian Curnow|bcurnow\n|Just Some User|auser\n|Test User 1|testuser1\n\nIf you add these users to the Multi User custom field, in view they will be sorted in the following order:\n\n* Brian Curnow\n* Just Some User\n* Test User 1\n\nHowever, if you edit the issue, the values will be sorted in the following order:\n\n* auser\n* bcurnow\n* testuser1\n\nThe sorting should be consistent in all views, either always sort by username or always sort by full name.\n\nAn alternative, and I can open an additional issue if necessary, is to change the rendering of the edit view so it works like component. Where each value is rendered as a bubble containing the full name with a X in the corner that will remove the value.",

We have an issue with comments saying \"Comment One\" and another saying \"Comment Two\". When trying to exclude that from a search, we can say \"Do not include issues where the comment has 'Comment One' in it\" using the !~ option, but the second comment does not match this so the issue is not excluded. Ideally we'd want a \"comments\" JQL option that searches all the comments and treats them as one block.\n\nOriginally logged as a bug, here's the steps to reproduce this behaviour:\n\n- Create a new project;\n- Create one issue with the summary \"Issue One\";\n-- Create a comment in this new issue with the content \"Comment One\";\n- Create one issue with the summary \"Issue Two\";\n-- Create a comment in this new issue with the content \"Comment Two\";\n- Create one issue with the summary \"Issue Three\";\n-- Create two comments in this new issue. One with the content \"Comment One\" and one with the content \"Comment Two\";\n\nNow go to the Issue Navigator using the advanced search and do the following JQL's:\n\n\n{code}\ncomment !~ \"\\\"Comment One\\\"\" AND comment !~ \"\\\"Comment Two\\\"\"\n{code}\nThis should return zero results, but it brings the _Issue Three_!\n\n\n{code}\ncomment !~ \"\\\"Comment One\\\"\"\n{code}\nThis should return the _Issue Two_, but it brings the _Issue Two_ and the _Issue Three_!\n\n\n{code}\ncomment !~ \"\\\"Comment Two\\\"\"\n{code}\nThis should return the _Issue One_, but it brings the _Issue One_ and the _Issue Three_!\n",

When the issue order toggle control is used to change the action order in the UI (to descending), and the issue is subsequently updated, the action order reverts back to ascending.  This behavior (I believe) is a departure from previous versions, where the selected issue action order would persist, at least for the session.\n\nIt would be nice if the issue action order selected by the user would persist, at least for the session. Ideally, it would be swell if control of this behavior could be delegated to individual users, via a preference setting.\n\nFurther, when issue activities are collapsed, they appear expanded if a new activity is added. It would be great if this setting could be made to stick, i.e if a user collapses activities, they stay that way until the user expands them.\n\nThanks for your consideration.\n\nChris",

Some APIs are worse than others. Lets use a simple REST API as an example of the problem. Voting api - http://docs.atlassian.com/jira/REST/latest/#id162079.\n\nbq. 404: Returned if the user cannot vote for any reason. (The user is the reporter, the user does not have permission to vote, voting is disabled in the instance, the issue does not exist, etc.)\n\nSo what is the reason?\n# user is reporter - I suppose the API user can get the issue and see if the current user is the reporter\n# user does not have permission (to the issue?  or no permission to vote?) - I suppose in this case, trying to get the issue will answer the first question. Not sure about how to find out if the the user has permission to vote\n# voting is disabled - how could one figure that out\n# issue does not exist - get issue API again would answer that\n# user has already voted - not listed in the documentation text, but also gives 404 \n\nAlso, why would one expect a *404 - not found* like exception for some of the reasons listed?\n\nThe bottom line is the API user has to go through various other actions to figure out what the problem is and sometimes cannot even narrow it down.

There is a collection of projects where the developers use to link an issue to several issues at the same time. But they do it manually, so there is an Issue-A and they create Issue-B, Issue-C and Issue-D in different projects and then they link these issues to Issue-A.\n\nIs the Create and link plugin able to link an issue to more than 1 issues at the same time?\n\nBest regards,\n\nRumi\n",

If you have queries based on a project and you then change the project name all existing queries are now broken.\n\nFor example, I had a project called \"roadmap\" and had queries built for it (i.e. \"project=roadmap AND ...\") to be used within confluence pages. We needed to add another project called \"X roadmap\". After noticing my lack of forethought on the naming of \"roadmap\" I changed the project name to \"Y roadmap\" which in turn broke all existing confluence pages.\n\nJust think it would be easy to translate project names to keys in the tool itself.\n\nThanks.
