Summary\r\n\r\nWhen clicking on the create issue button and opening that in a new tab or new window the JPO custom fields configured for that screen are not properly shown as their respective text box with drop down list is not shown; only the title of the field is shown.  However if instead of opening a new tab or window the pop up create issue is used the custom fields are correctly shown in the create issue screen.\r\nThis issue was reported for two custom fields \"Team\" and \"Parent Link\".\r\n\r\nh2. Environment\r\n\r\n* JIRA 7.2.6\r\n* JPO 2.2.4\r\n\r\n\r\nh2. Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n# Install JIRA 7.2.6\r\n# Install JPO 2.2.4\r\n# Configure the \"Team\" and \"Parent Link\" custom fields to be shown in the create issue screen\r\n## Goto Custom Fields\r\n## Find the \"Team\" custom fiel and click on Screens\r\n## Tick the checkboxes for  \"Scrum Bug Screen\" and \"Scrum Default Issue Screen\"\r\n## Click on the Update button\r\n## Repeat the same steps for the \"Parent Link\" custom field\r\n# Right click on the create issue button and open it in a new tab (or open it in a new window)\r\n# Select the project, issue type and click on the next button\r\n\r\n\r\nh2. Expected Results\r\n\r\nThe \"Team\" and \"Parent Link\" custom fields are shown with their respective text boxes and drop down lists (as it happens if just clicking on the create issue button)\r\n\r\n\r\nh2. Actual Results\r\n\r\nThe text boxes and drop down lists for the \"Team\" and \"Parent Link\" custom fields are not shown.\r\n\r\n\r\nh2. Workaround\r\n\r\nThe workaround is to use the Create Issue button instead of opening that in a new tab or window.\r\n\r\n\r\nh2. Additional Information\r\n\r\n* This problem cab be easily reproduced in a JIRA vanilla deployment.\r\n\r\n* There are three different screen shots uploaded to this bug which are:\r\n\r\n# JPO_CreateIssue : it shows when the fields are properly shown (when clicking on the Create Issue button)\r\n# JPO_CreateIssue_onnewtab : it shows when the text box and drop down list are not shown (when opening a new tab)\r\n# JPO_CreateIssue_onnewwin : it shows when the text box and drop down list are not shown (when opening a new window)\r\n\r\n* The issue was reproduced using the following browsers:\r\nChrome 57.0.2987.133 (Official Build) (64-bit)\r\nFirefox 52.0.2\r\n\r\n* Using the Developer Tools on Chrome there is a difference between the one that properly shows the fields and those that they do not (please see the screenshots attached).  \r\nThe screens that do not properly show the fields have in the \"Styles\" tab the following \r\n\"Inherited from div.aui-page-panel-inner\".",

Suggested Solution \r\n\r\n It would be a sensible improvement suggestion to be able to (with some care) let a user rank all issues without epic at the bottom from the epic view.\r\n\r\nh2. Workaround\r\n\r\nFrom the agile board (as it lets you group select and drag-drop) to re-rank those issues without epic actually below those with an epic\r\n\r\nHaving a JQL with all the stories without epic (and only those) should be an easy one\r\nthen can attribute them to a 'later' or 'triage' or just temporary epic\r\nthen in the portfolio epic view if you drag&drop that epic at the bottom it will re-rank all stories below the other\r\nother solution would be to add those stories to a release and set it in the far future / after everything else",

Steps to reproduce\r\n# Enter a value into Original Estimate in Portfolio live plan (lets say 10h)\r\n# Refresh the plan (Original estimate = 10h, Estimate = _null_)\r\n# Open the issue view page\r\n# Log work (lets say 2 hours time spent)\r\n# Refresh portfolio plan\r\n\r\nh4. Expected result:\r\nIssue view page should show\r\nOriginal Estimate = 10h\r\nRemaining Estimate = 8h\r\nLog work = 2h\r\n\r\nPortfolio plan should show\r\nOriginal Estimate = 10h\r\nEstimate (referring to remaining estimate) = 8h\r\n\r\nh4.

Let me give you an example.\r\n\r\nWe have an Epic (e.g. New website), this includes a lot of tasks that are completely under our control (prepare texts, code HTML template) but also contains some tasks that are managed outside our team (e.g. check legal with lawyers, get design from external freelancer).\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe problem here is that we know how long this typically\u00a0takes (e.g. lawyer check = 2-3 weeks, UX design 2-3 weeks), but we are struggling with modeling this in a Portfolio plan.\r\n\r\nHere are some hacks we tried and got almost there.\r\n # Created an External team with Lawyer & Designer virtual team members.\r\n # Added 3 skills (Core, Legal, Design) with 100%, 0%, 0% default setup.\r\n # Setup our internal team for Core skill and External team (Laywer = Legal, Designer = Design)\r\n\r\nThis works pretty well.\r\n # Portfolio will not try to recalculate plan and assign tasks to External team if you dont explicitly estimate some work for Legal/Design skill.\r\n # You can make an upper limit capacity for your external suppliers (handy since you don't want to overload them when you need them on multiple projects simultaneously.\r\n\r\nHowever. There is one minor glitch. If you actually don't care about capacity of the third party or you don't want to create a team member for every external supplier you are stuck.\r\n\r\n*Suggestion:*\r\n\r\nHow about adding a special wait time estimate to tasks? You just say - this task will take about 20hours from an external source (skill) and i dont care about capacity planning. Everything else will just work as is.\r\n\r\nIs there any other better way to model this in Portfolio?\r\n\r\n\u00a0",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JPOCLOUD-1820].\n  {panel}\n\nh2. Problem Definition\r\nJIRA has setup with components. Each component represent components in the enterprise systems.  When issue (story/task) is created first in JIRA first, during the initial analysis phase the component is assigned to the issue in JIRA.\r\nLater during the planning phase, where PMO is creating a plan through Portfolio issues are imported on the portfolio plan. In the portfolio teams and skill sets are defined so that portfolio can suggest resource allocation. The component field is also visible on portfolio now. But currently there is no direct association between component and either team or skill sets. So when portfolio suggests resource allocation (or when PMO 'calculates' for the schedule) the resources picked up are from random teams - without any consideration on the skill set/teams. So the development tasks/stories will get QA or BA resource getting assigned.  The only option is to go individually on all the issues and change the resource allocation manually.  When there are 100 - 200 different epics (with average 5-10 tasks/stories under each epic)  under development for different releases, it becomes extremely tedious job. \r\n\r\n\r\nh2. Suggested Solution\r\nI think we can have feature/option to link JIRA component with Portfolio skill set or project teams. \r\nOne can associate/link component with teams created in portfolio. \r\nFor example:\r\nComponent \"Pricing engine\" can be mapped to \"Pricing team\". Similarly component \"XYZ adapter\" can be mapped to \"XYZ adapter team\". \r\n\r\nFor someone skills are more helpful to plan. In that case one can associate component with skills and this can be many to many relationship. \r\nFor example:\r\nComponent \"Pricing engine\" can have multiple skill set associated with it.  Other component \"XYZ adapter\" may have other skill sets, but can share some skill set from \"Pricing engine\" component.\r\n\r\nOne can create this association while creating a plan from JIRA issues or from the \"Configure\" plan option.\r\n\r\nOnce the link between component and teams/skills is established, portfolio can use it while suggesting resource allocation on a schedule or calculating capacity.  Portfolio can now suggests resources which are at least meaningful (based on the teams/skill set).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAgain, this link can be kept optional. so only those who require to use can use. Those who do not need it can continue with current behavior. \r\n",

The violation should not be there, but does not make a difference from a scheduling point-of-view.\r\n\r\nh2. Work-around\r\nRemove the explicit estimate of 0 on the issue (which will cause the issue to be unestimated, unless it receives an estimate via estimate conversion set up for its issue source.
