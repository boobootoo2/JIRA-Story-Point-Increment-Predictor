Issue Summary\r\n\r\nWhen a site has the [product access|https://support.atlassian.com/user-management/docs/update-product-access-settings/]\u00a0configuration with the \"New users have access to this product\" toggle enabled and the [site access configuration|https://support.atlassian.com/user-management/docs/specify-how-users-get-site-access/]\u00a0allowing users from a specific domain to automatically join the site, it allows users to have automatic product access as soon as they try to access the instance.\r\n\r\nIf a user gets\u00a0Jira access based on this configuration, it will not automatically add the user to Confluence and vice-versa. If this Jira\u00a0user tries to access a page (via a link, for example), it will not prompt the user to join Confluence.\r\n\r\nInstead, the user faces a \"Too many redirects\" which after some time, redirects the user to a page so they can try again but, it also fails:\r\n\r\n!redirects.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\n!almost_there.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n# Have a site with both\u00a0Jira and Confluence.\r\n# As an administrator, [update the product access|https://support.atlassian.com/user-management/docs/update-product-access-settings/]\u00a0to have the \"New users have access to this product\" toggle enabled.\r\n# Under the [Site access configuration|https://support.atlassian.com/user-management/docs/specify-how-users-get-site-access/], select the *Approve the following domains* option and add a specific domain.\r\n# Have the user from this domain accessing Jira to have the access granted to it, which will not add the user with Confluence access.\r\n# Have this user accessing a page link from Confluence.\r\n\r\n(i) During this test, the [landing product|https://support.atlassian.com/organization-administration/docs/set-your-sites-landing-product/] was configured to Jira.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nThe user should see the option to join Confluence, like the example from this  test site below:\r\n\r\n!welcome_message.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nThe is not able to join the site, even after tapping the *Try again* button:\r\n\r\n!redirects.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\n!almost_there.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nTo have the product access enabled for the account:\r\n\r\n* Have the user manually access the link for Confluence's home (https://site.atlassian.net/wiki)\r\n* Grant site access to the user by accessing the profile under the *User management* tab (found via Confluence's administration/cog icon at the top right > *User management*)\r\n* Have the user accessing Confluence via the application navigator.",

Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. On inviting a user via email we default to the username provided in the email address. Ex: Sending an invite to\u00a0[user.test@example.com|mailto:user.test@example.com]\u00a0will set the username as the user.test\r\n 2. User receives a link to join the site and on clicking the invite link, the user is provided with the option to set user name/ full name.\r\n 3. If the user skips step 2 and logs in to the Atlassian site directly via social login \"Continue with Google\", we don't provide the option to change the user name in this login flow. Here the user name will be the *user.test*\r\n 4. Option now is org admin changes user name under the managed account or user changes this on his profile at\u00a0[id.atlassian.com|http://id.atlassian.com/]\r\nh3.
