This is not the case with the Edit Screens.\r\nFurthermore, due to the context is not updated dynamically, it has exposed to potential to bypass a required field. \r\n \r\nh3. Step to reproduce:\r\n# Create a separate screen (eg, bug screen) to be associated with the screen scheme\r\n# Create a custom field (Eg, important field)\r\n# Configure the custom field to only apply to bug issue type\r\n# Set this custom field *required* in the field configuration\r\n# Only associate this custom field with the Bug Screen\r\n# Associate this screen to the issue type screen scheme for issue type Bug\r\n# Create an issue as Story\r\n# Change the issue's issue type value to bug \r\n\r\n(i) Note both issue type configured should share the same workflow for this to work\r\n\r\nh3. Expected result:\r\n- The Edit screen form should be updated dynamically to display the Screen associated (Bug Screen) when changing issue type\r\n- Then the custom field showed up as required\r\nOR\r\n- Jira detects there is a required field on different issue type, not allowing to edit the issue type (Similar to how it works for issue type with different workflow)\r\n\r\nh3. Actual result:\r\nWe can update the issue type from the Edit screen form if they were using same workflow, hence effectively *bypassing the need to fill in the required field* allowing Bug issue without the required value in the custom field.\r\n\r\nThe required custom field will only show up in the edit screen once the update button is clicked and click on the edit again, where the edit screen switched the context to Bug issue type. \r\n\r\nIssue Type Screen Scheme:\r\n !Screen Shot 2018-09-13 at 16.39.43.png|thumbnail!  !Screen Shot 2018-09-13 at 16.40.42.png|thumbnail!  \r\nStory Edit Screen:\r\n!Screen Shot 2018-09-13 at 16.41.29.png|thumbnail! \r\nSelecting Bug as the new issue type but no change on the Edit form:\r\n !Screen Shot 2018-09-13 at 16.41.37.png|thumbnail! \r\nAfter the Update, we have access to the Bug Edit Screen but we have to edit a 2nd time:\r\n !Screen Shot 2018-09-13 at 16.41.51.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\nChanging the issue type value via the Edit screen can result in discrepancies if fields are different, required or if contexts are defined for an issue types that we can update to via the Edit screen. For example, updating an existing Task to a Bug can result in a Bug created without its specificities (required fields, context). We have to go through the Edit Screen a 2nd time to see the expected Edit Screen form defined by the Issue Type Screen Scheme. \r\n\r\nh3. Workaround:\r\nUse inline editing to change the issue's type from the View issue screen and instead of the Edit screen forms. \r\n",

Problem Definition\r\nAt this moment, when creating a date comparison condition in a workflow, admins can only use a fixed date.\r\n\r\nWhen we need a condition where the transition is only available if the \"Date Picker\" custom field is set to less than 6 months from now in the future. Examples:\r\n\r\n* Today is 09-12-2018. If the \"Date Picker\" is set to 11-12-2018, then the transition is *available*;\r\n* Today is 09-12-2018.

Why this is important\r\nThis should enhance greatly the user experience.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\u00a0\r\n(*Please note*: At this moment, this workaround can be done only by Jira admins!)\r\nWe can add a *Date Compare Validator*, which has broader options for date comparisons.

Upload a file as an attachment to an issue.\r\n2. Create a comment on that issue and try to include a the attachment in the comment itself.\r\n\r\n *Expected Results*\r\n The attachment would be in the list of files under recent uploads when clicking the 'Files and Images' button, or a text shortcut similar to the old method could be used to add a thumbnail in the comment.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Actual Results*\r\n The file must be drag & dropped into the comment again as a seperate upload.\r\n\r\n*Workaround*\r\n Disable the new issue view.

Now, if you go back to a project, the last accessed page of that project is opened.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nJira product management team\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\nh3. Summary\r\n\r\nUpon opening a Jira project, you're automatically redirected to the last page you accessed in that project. However, accessing any page under 'Issues and Filters' breaks this feature, in a way what you're always redirected to the page previous to that access. \r\n\r\nOnce that happens, the feature stops working until we access a board page (Backlog, Active Sprints, etc.). For example, this shows the page accessed and to what page you're returned upon closing the project and re-opening it:\r\n# Backlog: backlog\r\n# Components: components\r\n# Pages: pages\r\n# Versions: versions\r\n# 'All my issues' (under 'Issue and Filters'): versions (last page before this one)\r\n# Components: versions\r\n# Pages: versions\r\n# Backlog: backlog\r\n# Components: components\r\n\r\nAccessing 5 breaks the feature until we access 8.\r\n\r\nThis was tested in Software and Business projects.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Create a project and access a non-board page, like components\r\n#* Noticed that closing the project and re-opening it redirects you to that page\r\n# Open the project and access a page under 'Issues and Filters'\r\n# Close project and re-open it\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nYou're redirected to the page you access under 'Issues and Filters'\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nYou're actually redirected to the previous page (say components) and this redirection persists even if you access other pages, unless that page is a board page, when this is reset.\r\n \r\nh3. Notes\r\nWe can see in the database that the property 'last-visited-item.<project ID>'  remains with the previous value when accessing 'Issues and Filters'\r\n\r\nh3.Workaround\r\nAccess a board page to reset this behaviour.\r\n",
