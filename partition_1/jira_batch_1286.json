For someone who migrates from 4.0.2 the changes still don't feel natural.\n\n\nThe idea to keep action buttons and workflow actions on the screen while scrolling is nice! \nthat scrolling mechanism has some drawbacks. in some cases the scrollbar appears that sort of kills the mouse-wheel\n(see screenshot). to reproduce: scroll down on issue http://feedback.onjira.com/browse/BOX-1\nand click on a lower sub-task menu (number 4 for ex). The view jumps and the additional scrollbar does not go away.\n\n\nI dont like the buttons on top for actions and workflow. There is one rule I would recommend to follow: *make same things look the same!*\nIf some workflow actions are buttons and some are memnu-points, how do they differ? well they dont but one could think so.\n\n\nThere is also some white space below the work logs. I understand it is difficult to fill it. So I got a suggestion.\n\n\nMove the work log inside the issue area (marked in green on the screenshot).\nThen the width could be used in full for starting with the description. \nAlso it might be an idea to make that area flippable, so it could be vertical or horizontal.\n\nThe vertical way would be more for people like me\nThe horizontal would be more for modern fashioned folks.\n\n\nThere are other things as well:\n* you cheat the fix versions, affects versions and components information (marked in magenta) by cutting it\n* marked in blue is more what i would like to see together (type, priority, assignee, status, as most important ones)\n* comments are hovered on mouseover but one cannot click on them. coloring comments odd / even with a background would make a calmer layout and would avaoid additional lines to distinguish comments\n* the breadcrumb navigation on top lacks the issue / sub-issue structure.",

Since the Field configuration and Screens are related to a project, the Field Configuration should only show the screens that are related to that particular Configuration.\n\nTo clarify this a little more:\nThe field Affected Version/s is on almost every create issue Screen. We have several projects that have different Screen Schemes en Screens attached. The projects also have different Field Configurations related to them. If I choose the Field Configuration of one of the projects, all screens are shown that Affected Version/s is on. I'd like to see only the Screens related to the project here. It looks to me that the query used for creating the View Configuration Page should be altered for this. Please consider implementing this change.\n\nKind regards,\n\nJohan-Kees Vliek\nPinkRoccade Healthcare",

But to do so, we have to duplicate that custom .vm file about 15 times, once for each notification type.\n\nIt would be much more admin friendly to implement a single default .vm -- e.g. subject/default.vm -- that applies to all notification types unless a more specific .vm file is present overriding the default for a specific notification type.\n\ni.e. only need 1 file -- subject/default.vm -- if that works for all your email notifications.

Your feedback is key to helping us understand how you use JIRA so we can continue improving your experience. We have reviewed this issue over the last few days; however there are not currently any plans to implement this suggestion.\n\nPlease remember that jira.atlassian.com is one of many inputs for the JIRA roadmap. You can [learn more about our process here|https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/110373/how-does-the-jira-team-use-jira-atlassian-com].\n\nI understand that our decision may be disappointing. Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.\n\nRegards,\nOtto Ruettinger\nPrincipal Product Manager, JIRA\noruettinger (at) atlassian (dot) com\n{panel}\n*Original Description*\nWhy is it REQUIRED that I enter an email prefix when configuring an SMTP Server for JIRA? Rather presumptuous that all users want this.\n\nFor filtering in the email client, all my emails from JIRA are differentiated by the From address. I don't need (JIRA) or anything else prepended to every subject line. And furthermore, now that I can config custom subject lines per email notification type, I could always prepend whatever I want to each subject line in those Velocity templates including \"(JIRA)\" if I so wanted.\n\nPlease remove this requirement from defining the SMTP server.\n\nThe problem needs fixing in:\n - MailServerActionSupport.java doValidation() \u2013 remove check for isBlank(prefix)\n - remove \"<ui:param name=\"'mandatory'\">true</ui:param>\" from updatesmtpmailserver.jsp",

At the same stage I can even create a user allocation report for the future, knowing th enumber of hours that he various users have allocated in the future.\nTo the number of users allocate to a user in th original estimate is would be good also to specify the timeframe such that I can cross check almost dail whether \"user a\" is working on the issue during the time I have planned him to work on.

The delimiter is a comma so it thinks you are adding multiple groups to the Project Role.\n\nFor example, I have a group named \"appdev-team1,5,6\". When I add this to a Project Role it thinks I am assigning group \"appdev-team1\" and \"5\" and \"6\" to the project role (see screenshot)",

JIRA's XSRF protection kicks in, and I get to a page where I have to resubmit the comment. It's quite an irritating interruption -- mainly because it's easily and completely preventable.\n\nIn Confluence, we have an AJAX \"heartbeat\" that keeps the session open while your browser is viewing a page. All you need to do is basically this:\n\n{code}\nwindow.setInterval(function () {\n    jQuery.get(AJS.contextPath + \"/noop.jsp\");\n}, 300000);\n{code}\n\nThis sends a request to the server every 5 minutes (300000 ms) in order to keep the session open. The interval needs to be short enough that it is less than the session timeout, but long enough that it won't overload the server with heartbeat requests.\n\nIf you want, you could also add additional information to the heartbeat response, like who else is viewing the issue at the moment. This is how Confluence does concurrent editing notifications in the editor.\n",

I get exited when I hear Mike Cannon-Brookes speak about doing things for all us customers, and granted, I am a satisfied customer. However, when I see what's on the roadmap, I see a lot of new features, but not a lot of attention to issues that are already in the support site for a long time, and they just don't seem to get any love anymore from Jira product management.\nI have heard that you seem to be driven by Votes, but even that is not a good approach for reviewing the long open issues, some of which add functionality we all need, but now need to hack the system for to get working. If we can hack the system to make it work, how difficult would it be for some \"catch-up developers\" to add some of the long open feature/improvement requests we've already submitted?\nI want to plead for an effort in Atlassian when the great new things have their roadmap, but where there is also a catch-up development team who will add features we've submitted and which haven't had much love lately (like sometimes years!).\nJira Product Management, what say you?",

This approach would provide some level of filter/dash sharing privileges to all users:\n\n* Share with project (ALL) - restricted to project admins (or controlled by new permission in the permission schemes) (anyone with global permission also can share at this level)\n* Share with project (by role) AND Share with group - user allowed to only share with roles to which they belong (implicit permission - no special permission, but add system parameter to turn feature on/off) (anyone with global permission also can share at this level)\n* Share with everyone - restricted to global permission only\n\nThis approach would allow administrators of larger implementations to have more granular control over how users share filters without restricting users to not be able to collaborate.  All the while, the current behavior can still be achieved by using the global permission.  Whereas, today, it's an all-or-none approach.\n\nThis item dovetails with JRA-9997 and JRA-19780.",

I see much prior discussion, but no prior issue focused on one specific aspect: the fixed-at-top issue title and operations bar. On screens with more spare width than height -- and many laptop widescreens fall into this category -- this behavior severely cramps the interesting discussion log. \n\nIn particular, the fixed-area can take up more than half the viewport (!), with just a few assumptions (which happen to apply on my 13\" MacBook, and probably others' laptops as well). Fonts may be generously sized for the small screen -- making a long issue title wrap to 3-4 lines, and the operations tabs wrap to 2 lines  -- and other toolbars/menubars/docks/tab-bars/search-footers further cramp the viewport from top and bottom. This makes very few lines of comment logs visible. \n\nThe old layout used horizontal space more effectively, such that the entire vertical viewport could be used to view the comment-log. \n\nAt least in the current generations of Firefox (3.x) and Safari (5.x), fixating the issue title inside the page is largely redundant, because it already appears in the window title bar. (Further, this info does not need to be repeatedly consulted while browsing an issue's history.) Easy access to operations (especially the most-used 'comment' button) could be provided at top and bottom without impairing the reading of long issue histories. \n\nI know you don't want to provide an 'old look' toggle; however, simply allowing a toggle (or CSS customization) to disabl the fixed-float of the title/operations-bar would fix 90%+ of this problem on small/wide screens.

I wanted the two-dimensional gadget of Status and Priority. I have a filter that has two projects. One of the projects has status types: Open, Resolved. The other project has status types: DEV: Open, DEV: Resolved. When created the two-dimensional filter gadget, it categorized the status Open as DEV: Open and Resolved as DEV: Resolved. Thus, the first project's status did not show up on the dimension.\n\nSeems like if the status is like another type of status, it combines them to one. This is not the desirable outcome.",

Your input in the comments helps us understand how this affects you and what you're hoping to accomplish with Jira.\r\n\r\nAt this time, this suggestion is not on the Jira cloud development roadmap.\r\n\r\nPlease remember that jira.atlassian.com is one of many inputs for the Jira Cloud roadmap. You can [learn more about our process here|https://community.atlassian.com/t5/Answers-Developer-Questions/How-does-the-JIRA-team-use-jira-atlassian-com/qaq-p/475688].\r\n\r\nI understand that our decision may be disappointing. Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nDave Meyer\r\n[dmeyer@atlassian.com|mailto:dmeyer@atlassian.com]\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\nCurrently it's not possible to perform a bulk operation on a bunch of sub-tasks to move them to a new parent. This is rather annoying when splitting subtasks off from one task to another (e.g. from a \"miscellaneous\" task to a specific task once a set of sub-tasks gets large).\r\n\r\nIt would be great to be able to change the parents of any sub-tasks in a group when a move operation is specified. This seems to make sense anyways and would also allow moving subtasks (along with regular tasks!) to a new project if the new parent task was in the new project.",
