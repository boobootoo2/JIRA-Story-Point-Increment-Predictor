Expected Results\r\n\r\nBecause the directory is read-only, the password cannot be reset. A message similar to the following would be helpful:\r\n{quote}\r\nYour account is managed by <application name>, and cannot be updated at Confluence. Please visit <application url> to make changes to your account. If you're having trouble, please consult your system administrators.\r\n{quote}\r\nThis lets the user know their account cannot be changed at the current application, and where to go for managing it.\r\n * We know the directory is read-only\r\n * We also know which directory a user logs in through\r\n * We're also aware of where that directory is located (since we have this configuration as a part of the directory)\r\n\r\nh5. Actual Results\r\nThe update fails, and the following message appears:\r\n{quote}\r\nAn internal error occured\u00a0when trying to change your password.\r\n{quote}\r\nUsers must contact the administrator, rather than being able to self-service.\r\nh5. Workaround\r\n\r\nSetting the directory Read/Write allows users to reset their passwords in Crowd and JIRA from a downstream application such as Confluence. However, there are some cases where this may not be desirable - Confluence should fail gracefully, and guide the user to a location where they can change their password.",

This will cause users who don't have the attribute to be inadvertently filtered out, and removed from Crowd.\r\n\r\nh4. Steps to Reproduce\r\n * Setup Crowd and add AD user directory;\r\n ** For the port, input 3268 for the Global Catalog;\r\n ** Ensure\u00a0*Filter out expired users*;\r\n * Save and sync;\r\n\r\nh4. Expected behavior\r\n\r\nNon-expired users are synchronized and appear in Crowd correctly.\r\nh4.

Investigation\r\n\r\n(Reference: https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-64099)\r\n * When using INCREMENTAL sync with \"Filter out expired users\", Crowd's ldapsearch includes a check for {{accountExpires}};\r\n * {{accountExpires}} is not stored with Global Catalog (port 3268):\u00a0[https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms675098(v=vs.85).aspx];\r\n * This causes the search to return no results, causing Crowd to believe no users exist;\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nh4. Workaround\r\n * Disable\u00a0\"Filter out expired users\"; or\r\n * Connect to port 389, instead of\u00a03268;\r\n\r\n (i) In Crowd versions older than 2.12, this issue only impacts Incremental sync, so disabling incremental sync is a possible workaround for those versions.\r\n",

      "description": "h3. Summary\r\nCrowd Embedded is _following referrals_ of the LDAP users even though the _Follow Referrals_ flag is disabled.\r\n\r\nBasically, this is the scenario: There are a few LDAP directories that are children of the LDAP *atlassian.local* (Parent LDAP). One of the children is the *child.atlassian.local*, which is the one I'll refer to as \"Child LDAP\" in the steps to replicate.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that a user from the Child LDAP is a member of a group from the Parent LDAP (cross-domain membership). Crowd (it happens with Confluence too, I tested using Confluence) is connected to the Child LDAP, so if the user making the bind connection does not have permissions to read/modify the group from the Parent LDAP, the user from the Child LDAP won't be able to log in due to this error:\r\n{code}\r\nremaining name 'cn=myuser,cn=users,dc=example,dc=com'\r\ncom.atlassian.crowd.exception.OperationFailedException: org.springframework.ldap.NoPermissionException: [LDAP: error code 50 - 00002098: SecErr: DSID-03150BB9, problem 4003 (INSUFF_ACCESS_RIGHTS), data 0\r\n{code} \r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Have a Parent Domain and a Child Domain LDAP - Active Directory\r\n#* in my example, the Parent Domain is called *atlassian.local* and the Child Domain is called *child.atlassian.local*\r\n# Create a user in the Child LDAP (child.atlassian.local) and a Universal Group in the Parent LDAP (atlassian.local)\r\n# Set the proper permissions for the new group in the Parent LDAP so that the administrator of the Child LDAP can add a user in this group (cross-domain).\r\n#* To do it you need to go in the properties of the group in the Parent LDAP, select the Security tab and add the Administrator (or the user you're logged in with in the other Windows Server that has the Child LDAP) in the permissions, making sure to give this user all the permissions.\r\n# Add the child user in the parent group.\r\n#* In my example: *santos__camila* (from child.atlassian.local) was added to *grupocamis* (from atlassian.local)\r\n# Add the Child LDAP in Confluence and use the administrator account (or the one you've given permissions in the Parent group) as the Bind\r\n## Disable the follow referrals and perform a sync\r\n## You'll be able to log in with this user (make sure to map a proper group in the global permissions in connie)\r\n# Change the user that is doing the Bind to another regular user, just like santos__camila. In my case I created another regular user called *child1*.\r\n# Sync and try to log into Confluence with *santos__camila*.\r\n#* (!) As the Bind user does not have the permission in the security tab of the group called *grupocamis* (my example) from the Parent LDAP (*atlassian.local*), you'll face an *error code 50 data 0* due to insufficient permissions to read that group. In my case, I got a problem with the DNS, so this is the error for me: {code}\r\ncaused by: javax.naming.PartialResultException: [LDAP: error code 10 - 0000202B: RefErr: DSID-03100781, data 0, 1 access points\r\n    ref 1: 'atlassian.local'\r\n]; remaining name 'cn=grupocamis,cn=users,dc=atlassian,dc=local'\r\nat com.sun.jndi.ldap.LdapCtx.processReturnCode(LdapCtx.java:2971)\r\n{code}\r\n\r\n(i) See that because my bind user doesn't have the permission to read/modify this group in the Parent LDAP, the user will not be able to log in.\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n* The user with the cross-domain membership should be able to log into the application when Follow Referrals is disabled.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n* The application tries to follow the membership in the other domain even though the follow referrals is disabled, which prevents the user with cross-domain membership to log in.\r\n\r\nThe below exception is thrown in the xxxxxxx.log file:\r\n{noformat}\r\n2017-03-31 10:33:19,927 WARN [http-nio-8090-exec-9] [confluence.impl.hibernate.ConfluenceHibernateTransactionManager] doRollback Performing rollback.
