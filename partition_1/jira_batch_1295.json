Sometime it would create a task and sometimes it wouldn't, and the log files didn't give us enough info to point us in the right direction. The problem was a typo in the \"handler parameters.\" We had \"reportusername\" instead of \"reporterusername\" and we had lots of difficulty discovering this.\n\nThis enhancement request is, first, to make all handler parameters into either select lists, radio buttons, or text boxes, etc. This way the parameter name and syntax doesn't have to be \"known\" by the user and doesn't have to be looked up in the documentation. Currently, the \"Handler,\" \"Uses SSL,\" and \"Server\" parameters are select lists, so please continue that format for all other parameters. Thus, it will be much more user friendly and less error prone.\n\nBy the way, the \"Uses SSL\" could be a radio button, since there are only two options. How about \"SSL: Yes    No\".\n\nNext, check each parameter value with JavaScript (or the like), so that invalid values aren't stored. In other words, the \"delay\" is already checked to make sure that it's numeric. Other values should be the same. It could be that if all other values are controlled, then there won't be any checking necessary.\n\nThe implementation of this will almost make a service bullet and fool proof. Thanks!\n",

Shame it doesn't completely work after that...\n\nLong version:\n\nLike many people, we're currently using Jira over HTTPS. This means (as you guys have already blogged) that all JS files are loaded sequentially *and* not cached. The vast majority of JS files referenced are in the <head> of the page, which means it can't even start to render the body until they're all loaded. This is particularly bad for us because not only are we using a remotely-hosted Jira (and so each JS file load seems to take at least 100ms, often much more) but we've installed the Jira Labels plugin, which adds 10-15 more JS files to most pages. Hence, 12 seconds before render.\n\nI took the <script> tags from /includes/decorators/header.jsp and created a new javascript.jsp. (I also moved the webResourceManager.includeResources(out) call) Then I added an include of this file to footer.jsp, right before the </body>. The page was then able to render completely before most of the JS had been loaded.\n\nIdeally, everything should work fine after this. Unfortunately, it's not always the case - several parts of the page template use inline JS which execute as soon as they're loaded. In some cases, e.g. the auto-completing user picker, the code is referencing YUI functions which haven't been loaded yet. What the code *should* be doing is deferring until the page is either fully loaded (by onLoad) or, even better, the DOM is ready (see: http://dean.edwards.name/weblog/2005/09/busted/ and follow-ons).\n\nThe speed of Jira is a major issue for us (Linden Lab); making these tweaks would be of significant value.\n",

This feature currently doesn't work for plugins, so plugin authors could be creating insecure administrative actions without knowing it.\n\nThe problem is in how the roles-required attribute is read.  Only the Atlassian Seraph filter (specifically WebworkService) reads this attribute and only by manually parsing the 'actions.xml' file.  Obviously plugins' webwork configuration won't be there, so the attribute is never read.  Ideally, this WebworkService would use loaded action configuration data from Configuration, which would include the plugin actions.  Unfortunately, the 'roles-required' attribute isn't stored in the Webwork configuration, so this isn't currently possible, and Webwork 1 has no way to read in additional action configuration automatically (WebWork 2 has a <param> element for actions where static values can be injected into the action class or read by an interested interceptor).\n\nThe workaround I've found involves overriding the execute() method for the Action class, as this method is called whether a command (someaction!somecommand) has been specified or not.  Borrowing code from Seraph, it looks like this:\n\n{code}\npublic String execute() throws Exception\n{\n    if (hasRole(request.getUserPrincipal(), request, \"admin\"))\n        return super.execute();\n    else\n    {\n        HttpServletResponse response = ServletActionContext.getResponse();\n        response.sendRedirect(RedirectUtils.getLoginUrl(request));\n        return null;\n    }\n}\n\nprotected boolean hasRole(Principal user, HttpServletRequest request, String role)\n{\n    final int permissionType = Permissions.getType(role);\n    if (permissionType == -1)\n    {\n        throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Unknown role '\" + role + \"'\");\n    }\n    return ManagerFactory.getPermissionManager().hasPermission(permissionType, (User) user);\n}\n{code}\n\nNotice I'm using the literal \"admin\", since there is no current way to access the value specified in 'roles-required'.  The RedirectUtils class is actually a Seraph class, and handles the proper creation of the login url, including the destination value.",

Your feedback is key to helping us understand how you use JIRA so we can continue improving your experience. We have reviewed this issue over the last few days; however there are no immediate plans to put this suggestion on our near term roadmap.\n\nI'd recommend to take a look at [Portfolio for JIRA|https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/portfolio]'s features to evaluate if that could help you manage and schedule your issues as described here.\n\nI understand that our decision may be disappointing. Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.\n\nRegards,\nDaniel Franz\ndfranz@atlassian.com\nPrincipal Product Manager, JIRA Platform\n{panel}\n  \n\nThe following (if feasible) would allow issue dependencies to be created, ranging from just two issues up to potentially all issues in a given version of a project.\n\nThis would allow Gantt charts to be created.\n\n********************************\n\nAdd two fields to JIRA issues: \n- ScheduleType (single-select list) -- required.\n- StartDate (time/date) -- requiredness depends on the value of ScheduleType as itemised below.\n\nAdd one field to JIRA project versions:\n- VersionStartDate (time/date) -- required.\n\nMake the following existing field required:\n- VersionDueDate (time/date) -- required.\n\n\nEnhance the global configuration of Link Types so that one Link Type must be nominated as the 'Master' (this Link Type will be used to control actual dependencies between issues).\n\n********************************\n\nScheduleType has 7 possible values: \n\n1. 'Issue Start Date'\n2. 'Issue Due Date'\n3. 'Start After Linked Issues Finish'\n4. 'Finish Before Linked Issues Start'\n5. 'Version Start Date'\n6. 'Version Due Date'\n7. 'None'\n\nDepending on which value the user selects, the following will occur: \n\n(1). If ScheduleType = 'Issue Start Date', then:\n- OriginalEstimate is required.\n- StartDate is required.\n- DueDate (non-editable) is automatically set to StartDate plus OriginalEstimate (or, if work has already commenced, to StartDate plus RemainingEstimate).\n\n(2). If ScheduleType = 'Issue Due Date', then:\n- OriginalEstimate is required.\n- StartDate (non-editable) is automatically set to DueDate minus OriginalEstimate.\n- DueDate is required.\n\n(3). If ScheduleType = 'Version Start Date', then:\n- OriginalEstimate is required.\n- StartDate (non-editable) is automatically set to the VersionStartDate.\n- DueDate (non-editable) is automatically set to StartDate plus OriginalEstimate (or, if work has already commenced, to StartDate plus RemainingEstimate).\n\n(4). If ScheduleType = 'Version Finish Date', then:\n- OriginalEstimate is required.\n- DueDate (non-editable) is automatically set to the VersionDueDate.\n- StartDate (non-editable) is automatically set to DueDate minus OriginalEstimate.\n\n(5). If ScheduleType = 'Start After Linked Issues Finish', then:\n- OriginalEstimate is required.\n- StartDate (non-editable) is automatically set to the latest DueDate of all linked issues where the Link Type matches the specified 'Master' Link Type and the current issue contains the Outgoing Link; or if no such links exist, to the VersionStartDate.\n- DueDate (non-editable) is automatically set to StartDate plus OriginalEstimate (or, if work has already commenced, to StartDate plus RemainingEstimate).\n\n(6). If ScheduleType = 'Finish Before Linked Issues Start', then:\n- OriginalEstimate is required.\n- DueDate (non-editable) is automatically set to the earliest StartDate of all linked issues where the Link Type matches the specified 'Master' Link Type and the current issue contains the Incoming Link; or if no such links exist, to the VersionDueDate.\n- StartDate (non-editable) is automatically set to DueDate minus OriginalEstimate.\n\n\n(7). If ScheduleType = 'None', then:\n- StartDate is editable (and optional); but cannot be set to empty if any Outgoing links of the 'Master' Link Type exist.\n- DueDate is editable (and optional); but cannot be set to empty if any Incoming links of the 'Master' Link Type exist.\n\n********************************\n\nNOTES: \n(i). The system 'Time Tracking' values (i.e. 'Hours per day' and 'Days per week') would need to be taken into account in the above calculations. \n(ii). Whenever there is a change to an issue's StartDate, DueDate, OriginalEstimate or RemainingEstimate, any linked issues (where the 'Master' Link Type is used) would need to be updated as per (5) and (6) above.\n(iii). Whenever a link between two issues is created, using the 'Master' Link Type, it would need to be validated to ensure that no circular dependencies are created; and any dependent issues would need to be updated as per (5) and (6) above.\n(iv). Whenever a link between two issues, of the 'Master' Link Type, is deleted, any linked issues would need to be updated as per (5) and (6) above.\n(v). Whenever there is a change to a version's VersionStartDate or VersionDueDate, any dependent issues would need to be updated as per (3), (4), (5) and (6) above.\n(vi). StartDate should not be used to constrain the 'Start Date' that appears on the 'Log Work' popup -- this would just get too messy.",

However, this is a really useful feature in our installation for at least two reasons:\n\n1. We use voting as a peer review mechanism, and highlight high vote issues come review time. This creates a bad incentive to leave votes open longer than they should\n2. In our public JIRA install, we'd like to still collect votes on issues we marked \"resolve/wont fix\", so that we can reconsider should there be a popular groundswell.\nh3.

The standalone Jira should at least use a different shutdown string in server.xml (e.g. \"SHUTDOWN-JIRA\") to avoid conflict with other potential instances of Tomcat on the same server.\n\nAnother solution is to document this in the installation instructions, and warn system adminstrators that they should configure different ports if they are running other instances of Tomcat.

This was fixed in in 3.10.1 - JRA-13042.\n\nWhile we were not able to reproduce the OutOfMemory errors for the Issue Statuses page, that page does run slowly. On version 3.10.1 it takes 75 seconds to display the Issue Statuses page for the customer's data. The customer does have 46 issues and 206 issue statuses, so I acknowledge that this is perhaps pathological data. However I thought I should still log it as an issue, in case you want to investigate it further, to see if it is worth trying to improve the performance of this page.\n\n{panel:title=Atlassian Status as of 07/07/2010|borderStyle=solid|borderColor=#3C78B5| titleBGColor=#3C78B5| bgColor=#E7F4FA}\nThanks for everyone's input.

We are otherwise satisfied with our purchase except that the XML, HTML and Word issue views lack a feature that is critical from our point of view: the worklog. Currently the XML, HTML and Word issue views in JIRA 3.10 contains only comments in addition to the basic issue fields. Therefore we request that worklogs if not all possible issue information is included to the issue views. This would make getting formal and good looking reports out of JIRA easy.\n\nWe think that the possibility to see worklog information in all issue views is a feature that should be a standard in JIRA instead of being accessible only by the means of plug-ins.

(see attachment)\nWhen creating an issue, if you know the name of the component, why scroll down, when you can type in the first letters and pinpoint it out right away? It would be valuable timesaver for our customers and save some time for our developers as well. \n\nThanks in advance!\nP.O\n",

Therefore, if we wanted to filter or order by these fields we would have to calculate it at run time for all issues in the database.\nAs these fields are calculated by running another Lucene search, a system with 30K issues in would run 30001 Lucene queries for every search done.\n\nAnother way to solve this problem is to build a report which would take in a saved filter and the aggregate fields to sort by and do the expensive operation.  Not the perfect solution, but it may satisfy the needs of some.\n\nFor the time being, you will need to export your results to Excel and then do a sort/filter in there.\n\nIf you are voting for this issue, please let us know if you would be happy with the report.",

This home page uses NTLM/IWA to authenticate users, so I get a username but not a password. If I could connect to JIRA as a known, single account (e.g. \"intranet\") and then call JiraSoapServiceService.impersonate(\"joe.bloggs\") then I'd be able to be logged in as joe.bloggs without actually needing his password. Naturally the \"intranet\" account would need to have some kind of \"can impersonate\" permission set up on it.\n\nLooking at the RPC code it seems that it might just be as simple as adding an \"impersonate\" method to the tokenManager that does something like:\n{quote}\n{{public void impersonate(String token, String username) throws RemoteAuthenticationException, RemotePermissionException}}\n{\n  {{User currentUser = retrieveUser(token);}}\n  {{if(!permissionManager.hasPermission(Permissions.IMPERSONATE, currentUser)) throw new RemotePermissionException(\"No permission to perform operation\");}}\n  {{User newUser = UserUtils.getUser(username);}}\n  {{synchronized(tokens)}} {\n    {{tokens.put(token, newUser);}}\n  }\n}\n{quote}\nand then adding the relevant code to the interface itself to expose this method.",

Let's call it 'config'. The structure of that folder will have to follow the package arborescence implemented in Jira.\n\n. when we want to customize a property of a property file, then we place a properties file with the same name and arborescence of the original one, but containing only the customized property, not the unchanged ones\n\nWhen the JIra engine is loading properties/resources, it proceeds as usual, and, finally, loads the ones from that 'config' folder, then overriding the system properties.\n\nThe benefits are:\n. Customization are localized in the 'config' folder, not mixed with default settings\n. When upgrading, this folder is not overwritten, and we can easily use it on other installations.\n\nThat technic could also be used for templates, where only the complete file would be overriden.\n",

Your feedback is key to helping us understand how you use JIRA so we can continue improving your experience. We have reviewed this issue over the last few days; unfortunately we don't have any plans to support this in JIRA for the foreseeable future.\n\nPlease remember that jira.atlassian.com is one of many inputs for the JIRA roadmap. You can [learn more about our process here|https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/110373/how-does-the-jira-team-use-jira-atlassian-com].\n \nI understand that our decision may be disappointing. Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.\n \nRegards,\nDave Meyer\ndmeyer@atlassian.com\nProduct Manager, JIRA Platform\n{panel}\n\n*Original request description*\n\nI would like an option where the Priority is set to 'empty' by default and then the user has to select one of the options in the drop down list (this should be mandatory).\nThis functionality already exists when adding a custom field.\nIt is quite important that the priority should be undefined and that the user has to pick one of the options. Otherwise people might overlook the priority and just leave it automatically on the default value.\n",

He confirmed that we do not have such a document yet. He also said that a while back he started to write a script using TCP Wrappers (on all Linux boxes) that would listen for requests to port 8080 (or whatever), and fire up a JIRA if there was not one listening on port 8080. Perhaps we need to spend some time on this as well.\n\nKind regards,\nIan",

So it does that. \n\nHowever, if Modify Reporter privilege is set, there are two options:\n1. the current logged in user\n2. an anonymous reporter\n\nJIRA currently doesn't have the means of distinguishing between the two, so we fail with an error message.\n\nCan we please improve this? For example, could we not have an extra attribute on the CreateIssue tag that indicated specifically that we wanted an anonymous reporter?\n\nIn the meantime, the [documentation|http://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/docs/latest/jelly.html#CreateIssue] needs improving as all it says it that the default value for reporter is the currently logged in user. I will create a separate issue for this documentation task.\n\nCheers,\nIan",
