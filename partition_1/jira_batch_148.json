The folder doesn't actually appear in any .gitignore file. Where are svn:ignore properties tracked and enforced in my Git repository, if they are not converted to a .gitignore file?\r\n\r\nLike I said, I don't think SVN has anything to do with the primary issue here. I tested by adding another folder to my .gitignore, modifying some files in that folder and attempting to stage them to the index.\r\n",

Also perhaps make the index area automatically adapt to the vertical size needed, so that it doesn't take up much space most of the time (say max 50% after which it begins to scroll). Minimum size would be one line high to support drag/drop behaviour, or possibly auto-expand on drag (but intuitiveness of the availability of the drop zone could be tricky in that case, so review with prototypes).\r\n\r\nOriginal issue:\r\nWhen viewing \"uncommitted changes\" in the \"log view\", I can \"add\" untracked files, but I can't \"add\" a tracked file with changes or \"add\" a deleted file to the index. I need to change to the working copy view instead or bring up the commit dialogue and \"add\" changes or deletions to the index from there.\r\n\r\nNot a huge deal, but it is an interruption to my workflow as I spend a lot of time in the log view, and it just seems strange. If I can \"add\" untracked files, it seems logical that I should be able to \"add\" changes, too. I'm not sure why \"add\" is greyed out for most changes but works for untracked files, while \"remove\" and \"add/remove\" are not greyed out.\r\n\r\nThe \"stage file\", \"stage hunk\" and \"stage selected lines\" options are also not present from the diff view of modified files in the uncommitted changes view.

However if this can be ambiguous, e.g. multiple user names on a domain or a mistake in the log in window when first used, this can fail and keep prompting the user for credentials. \r\n\r\nThe most reliable way to solve this is to add the username to the URL, as in https://username@host.com/path/to/repo. However this is not necessarily intuitive to a user, and is not the default in Kiln Hosted Projects.\r\n\r\nTo solve this, it would be better to make the defaulting more effective - taking into account more of the URL in order to clarify ambiguous cases, and overwriting the setting with the last successful use in all cases so it doesn't get out of date.",

In other words, he expected the index to be retained for that file and for the file status in the working copy to returned to the index state.\r\n\r\nIn fact Discard File resets all changes to the file, including changes in the index. This could be deemed unintuitive because in the context, a user could reasonably expect the 'Discard File' to equate to the same effect as clicking 'Discard Hunk' on all hunks in the diff pane.\r\n\r\n'git reset' doesn't actually have a mode which resets the working copy while keeping the index intact, only the opposite (--mixed). To return to the index state you use 'git checkout <files>'. So this is probably what should be done when discarding a file in the unstaged area.\r\n",

So in practice, you can't just use the folder as a proxy in a lot of cases, and it would be dangerous / unintuitive to do so except perhaps in the single case of 'Add' when there is no search filter in force.

I'm wondering if they've completely changed the way that submodules are referenced, moving the .git repo itself into another location. See this comment in the release notes:\r\n\r\n\r\n{quote}\r\nWhen populating a new submodule directory with \"git submodule init\",\r\n   the $GIT_DIR metainformation directory for submodules is created inside\r\n   $GIT_DIR/modules/<name>/ directory of the superproject and referenced\r\n   via the gitfile mechanism. This is to make it possible to switch\r\n   between commits in the superproject that has and does not have the\r\n   submodule in the tree without re-cloning.\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nChecking this out.
