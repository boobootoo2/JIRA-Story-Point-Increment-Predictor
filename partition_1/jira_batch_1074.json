Environment\r\nJira Cloud\r\nFor Jira Server See corresponding BUG: https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-70108\r\n\r\nh3.

Notes\r\nThe \"Edited\" notation is class \"filter-edited-object\"\r\n\r\nh3.

In my experience, anytime a users is logging time against an issue in Jira, it is always a rough subjective estimate of how long the user was working on the issue.\r\n * The reality of the situation is users aren't keeping a notepad or excel sheet on how long they are working on a current issue, especially if users are switching between multiple issues to complete a certain tasks. Time tracking can get quite fuzzy when trying to accurately log time between multiple issues.\u00a0\r\n * For the organizations using the time tracking feature, it can be very difficult to do the following points with the current time tracking in jira v.s. a semi-automatic time tracking feature:\r\n ** Resource allocation and capacity planning within agile or other methodologies\u00a0\r\n ** Accurate time tracking against specific issue types\r\n ** Accurate reporting on where teams are spending a majority of their time based on the issue or task.\r\n ** Accurate time tracking for billable hours.\r\n ** Time and budget planning for current and future projects.\r\n\r\nh3. +Current Challenges:+\r\n * Users not accurately tracking time against issues.\r\n * Logging time after the issue has been completed.\r\n * Unable to track or monitor what the user actually did against an issue when tracking time.\r\n * Users sometimes forget to track time on issues\u00a0_*(Training problem, but it can be improved with a better user experience).*_\r\n * **Users don't like to waste time manually logging time on an issues, especially when users are juggling multiple issues\u00a0\r\n\r\nh3. +Suggestion User Stories:+\r\n * As a Developer switching between multiple Jira issues, I would like to be able to start. pause, and end a timer that tracks my time against an issue, so I do not have to manually track my time each time I am switching between issues.\r\n * As a Project Manager, I would like to have more accurate time tracking for project issues, so I can more accurately plan and estimate the duration of a future projects with similar tasks.\u00a0\r\n * As a Team Manager, I would like to more accurate time tracking for my team, so I can accurately measure where my team is spending their time.\r\n * As a Billing Manager, I would like to have more precise time tracking feature, so I can accurately bill our customers for the work our teams have completed.\r\n\r\nh3. +Suggested Functionality:+\r\n * Ability for users to start a timer on an issue.\r\n * Ability for users to pause a timer on an issue.\r\n * Ability for users to end a timer and log time against an issue.\r\n ** Ability for users to edit the timer duration before logging time against an issue.\r\n * Ability for users to cancel or reset a timer.\r\n * Ability for users to log internal notes or a summary of what was completed during the duration of the logged time.\r\n * Ability for users to configure the feature's fields based on specific user groups or issue types.\r\n * Ability for users to turn the feature on or off based on their preference for project, tasks, etc.\u00a0\r\n * Ability for users to leave the page, return to the page, and still see the unlogged paused time on the issue that still needs submitted.\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nh3. +Other Notes:+\r\n * I've seen other requests like this suggestion in the JRASERVER , but I was unable to find anything that fulfills this need for team-managed (formerly next-gen) besides manual time entry.\r\n ** JRASERVER-1946\r\n ** JRASERVER-14907\r\n * I've seen 3rd party tools that organizations can purchase and utilize in the marketplace, but they either require a purchase or it takes some manually configure the tool to work seamlessly into your reporting.\r\n * Time tracking has the potential to be a powerful and insightful tool if implemented correctly. I believe the community wants to have better tools to manage projects and their teams inside jira. I believe this suggestion can be very beneficial for a wide variety of users utilizing Jira as the main project management platform and for that reason, I believe this suggestion should be apart of Jira's core product.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0",

Issue Summary\r\nUnder /secure/admin/ViewPriorities.jspa# we have a field named as *Priority Color* when creating a new priority. \r\nThis field has a button that allows users to select the intended color to use. Yet, it also allows users to input any String to it. \r\n\r\nThe problem is if the String inserted is not a color hash, it breaks board views if their card colors are based on *Priorities*.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Access /secure/admin/ViewPriorities.jspa# \r\n # Add a new Priority and instead of selecting a color for the field *Priority Color*, type the name of the color e.g.: Yellow.\r\n # Add the priority\r\n # Access any board\r\n # Access the board settings\r\n # Click on *Card colors* on the board settings menu \r\n # Make the field \"Colors based on\" field as *Priorities*\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nWhen inserting the priority color, there should be a validation if the input is a valid color hash string and if not, it shouldn't allow the user to save it.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nSystem allows any String to be input in the priority color field leading to problems such as the one described on the \"Steps to Reproduce\" section.\r\n\r\nI've reproduced it with the String \"Purple\" and the error that is triggered in the board settings page is the following: \r\n !screenshot-1.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\nYou might as well see an error on the board itself stating \"Failed to execute search\" error.\" and not allowing you to see the board content at all.\r\n\r\nh3.

Summary\r\nCurrently when trying to search JQL and using the [project field|https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirasoftwarecloud/advanced-searching-fields-reference-764478339.html#Advancedsearching-fieldsreference-ProjectProject], the only supported operators are \r\nbq. = , !=, IS , IS NOT, IN , NOT IN\r\n\r\nIt does not currently support the use of the WAS or WAS NOT operators.\r\n\r\nh3. Why this would be helpful\r\nExtending tracking to an issue's project history here would be very useful in order to try to search for issues that were not initially created in the current project, but rather were moved from another project.  Right now, JQL does not have a native way to search for issues that have been moved from another project.\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\nIt seems to be something that 3rd party plugins have tried to solve, such as described in https://community.atlassian.com/t5/Jira-questions/View-issues-that-have-been-moved-from-one-project-to-another/qaq-p/790346\r\nHowever to have Jira be able to do this natively would be preferred.",

      "description": "Hi there,\r\n\r\nI have been to the Atlassian Open conference, and it was really great. I very much liked the idea of the team playbook and would like to give it a go.\r\n\r\nHowever, I think it can't work for us. We are a very large team of about 25 and work on multiple projects simultaneously, so most of the time people work on more than 1 project at the time or team members are shuffled between projects, depending on priority changes.\r\n\r\nDon't get me wrong, we are extremely agile and practice continuous deployments that way, with deployment schedules driven by the dev team rather than product owners or stake holders, it's really cutting edge.\r\n\r\nThis is where the problem lies. The 'Project team' for Atlassian Team Playbook is all focused around projects, rather than the actual team or the product. I think that is a key value that's really missing from this new tool.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading and considering. Happy to assist in more detail on how our team operates.\r\n\r\nCarolina\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPS: There was no option in the drop-down for Team Playbook, so I dropped this under Jira Cloud.\u00a0",

Thus, we\u2019ve made additional changes to the \u201ccomment section\u201d which will be rolled out in the upcoming days. The Atlassian team would like to thank you again for the patience and apologies again for the frustration and inconvenience such delay has caused.\r\n\r\nTLDR: the comment section should largely resemble display/collapse behaviour in the old issue view which is \u201clatest 5 comments always shown\u201d and \u201coldest comments always collapsed/hidden\u201d.\r\n * This means when you select \u201coldest first\u201d instead of displaying the oldest 5 comments and collapsing most recent ones, you\u2019ll see the most recent 5 comment displayed oldest to newest with the older comments always collapsed. The reason for this change is because (1) we found having oldest comments always displayed isn\u2019t useful for majority of our users (2) many users value/miss the ability to quickly/efficiently navigate to the latest comment in the same vertical space (i.e. bottom of the page) regardless of which issue they\u2019re looking at\r\n\r\n * When you select \u201cnewest first\u201d the behaviour stays how it is today. In particular, the \u201cadd comment\u201d field will always sticked above the comments, to make sure the latest comment is always close/in-view while you type in new comments, regardless of your sort order. This is different than in the old view, which when sorted \u201cnewest first\u201d the comment box would stick to the bottom of the page, further away from the latest comment\r\n\r\n * In addition, we\u2019ve also made it more efficient by reducing the number of clicks needed to switch sort order, by changing it to a button rather than a drop down. \r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the \u201cworklog\u201d and \u201chistory\u201d view display will stay as it is today.\r\n{panel}\r\n\u00a0\r\n{panel:title=Atlassian Update - 14 October 2020|borderStyle=solid|borderColor=#2684ff|titleBGColor=#2684ff|bgColor=#ffffff}\r\nHi everyone, thank you for your interest surrounding this ticket. Before we begin [transitioning all users to the new issue view|https://community.atlassian.com/t5/Jira-articles/Transitioning-all-Jira-Cloud-users-to-the-new-issue-view/ba-p/1494104] on 31 March, 2021, we\u2019ll be solving this problem. Watch this ticket for updates as we progress and please add a comment for any questions you may have.\r\n{panel}\r\nh3. Problem Definition\r\n\r\nIn the old issue view, it was possible to order/re-order the following issue tabs:\r\n * History\r\n * Work log\r\n * Transition\r\n * Comments\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n * Allow users to toggle between viewing these tabs/sections using ascending or descending order\r\n\r\nh3. Why this is important\r\n * Some users prefer an ascending list - or the option to toggle between the different ordering(newest to oldest vs. oldest to newest)\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n * No known workarounds",

Upon clicking the Create button in the top of the window it seems that Jira detects this somehow and shows another kind of pop-up. But the situation with and without adblock has a subtle difference:\r\n # without pop-up block the new-user-story window is modal. Also the Create button at the top of the screen is disabled.\r\n # with pop-up block the new-user-story window is *almost* modal: the create button at the top is enabled.\r\n\r\nIn the situation with pop-up blocker the create button looks like the create button at the bottom and users can be confused and use the top button when they want to commit their changes. But the button at the top will always display a new and empty pop-up, where the user looses the just entered information.\r\n\r\nSome more remarks:\r\n # Upon clicking the upper Create button twice there are actually multiple popups created, overlaying each other. The user did actually not loose any information and just needed to close the accidental duplicate overlaying popup.\r\n # the button Create is displayed twice. There might be UI design rules about this but the confusion might be less big if the buttons had different names.\r\n\r\n\u00a0",

Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Create a Project with some issues on it.\r\n # Go to the workflow *Project Settings > Workflow*\r\n # Edit it and add a Validator to a Transition with some fields that would be required.\r\n # Add a Screen as well and populate it with those fields.
