Steps to Reproduce\n# Run a filter similar to the below;\n{noformat}\nassignee != admin\n{noformat}\n# Un-assign one of the issues returned by the filter;\n# Re-run the search;\n\nNotice the unassigned issue will be now be missing.\n\nh2. Workaround\nCreate a filter for issues which have a positive match for the value you are trying to exclude.\n\nh4. Example\n# Create a new filter with the below query and give it a name (e.g. Admin's Issues)\n{noformat}\nassignee = admin\n{noformat}\n# Run a search with the below query;\n{noformat}\nfilter != \"Admin's Issues\"\n{noformat}\n\nh2. Testing Notes\nUsing [Luke|https://code.google.com/p/luke/] to query the Lucene index directly and searching for {{-color:red}} you get 70 issues on the use-case presented above (in \"Example #1\", under \"Actual Behavior\").",

Please remember that jira.atlassian.com is one of many inputs for the JIRA roadmap. You can [learn more about our process here|https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/110373/how-does-the-jira-team-use-jira-atlassian-com].\n\nI understand that our decision may be disappointing. Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.\n\nRegards,\nDave Meyer\n[dmeyer@atlassian.com|mailto:dmeyer@atlassian.com]\nProduct Manager, JIRA Platform\n{panel}\n\nThe application of the auto-complete renderer to the fix/affected versions field and components field is a welcome addition to Jira.\nWhat would be even more useful is if the auto-complete renderer could also be applied to any multi-select and/or multi-checkboxes custom field.\nWe've got one particularly large multi-checkboxes custom field that has options added to it at a rate of 1 or 2 options a week. As it stands it causes major screen real estate problems when using \"simple\" searching. \nThe \"advanced\" searching JQL auto-complete actually already offers auto-complete for the field in question, but for our less advanced users, we'd love to see something closer to the components/versions/labels auto-completion style in the simple searching (and general issue editing/moving) views.\n",

This seems like a rather harsh way of telling the users that the security scheme of this project have changed.\n\nWorst case scenario, with a project with thousands of issues, this process takes quite a while to complete. And, in this whole time the process is taking place, the users get a 'Permission Violation' exception, where there should be a message much like the reindex message (when a user tries to do any action while the reindexing is taking place, he doesn't get a 'ugly' message, but instead a nice \"the reindexing is taking place, please wait\".\n\nBased on the ticket:\n\nhttps://support.atlassian.com/browse/JSP-67441\n\nCheers \nThiago Prisco\nAtlassian Support\n",

Editing the custom field description will work in a simple JIRA configuration (i.e. one project with one field configuration) but at some point this behaviour changed on me (I think it may have been as soon as other projects/field configurations were added). An update to the custom field description through the View Custom Field page no longer had any effect outside this page.  At this point you must edit the custom field description in all appropriate Field Configurations (System > Issue Fields > Field Configurations and open the proper field configuration)\nWhat I find frustrating is that there is no indication of this change and I spent a lot of time trying to understand why what worked before was no longer working.\n\nI have no issue with updating the custom field description in the appropriate Field Configurations because this provides great flexibility (although could mean a lot of work if you have a complex environment). What I am hoping you can do is something to reduce the confusion when it stops working the way it initially did.\n\nI would suggest:\n* Providing an *option* to propagate the description - allowing you to select which field configurations would be overwritten\n* A warning that the change will have no effect on existing field configurations (and therefore screens).\n\nMy preference would be the first suggestion as I believe it would greatly improve the user experience.\n\nI hope I have explained this clearly.\nRegards,\nJon",

This might be useful when you want separate groups of users using JIRA, and want only one group (your employees, for instance) to count towards your crowd license and have SSO, while other users exist inside JIRA's database and can only login JIRA.

David's description here is in line with the JIRA PM team's current thinking about subtasks. We want to strike a balance between more flexible parent-child hierarchies and the reasoning in Scott's original comment that having separate issue types allows for different sets of fields in the subtask.\n\nNevertheless, I don't expect us to address this for quite a while. We will update this issue as soon as we can confidently project a release.\n\nPlease remember that jira.atlassian.com is one of many inputs for the JIRA roadmap. You can [learn more about our process here|https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/110373/how-does-the-jira-team-use-jira-atlassian-com].\n\nI understand that our decision may be disappointing. Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.\n\nRegards,\nDave Meyer\n[dmeyer@atlassian.com|mailto:dmeyer@atlassian.com]\nProduct Manager, JIRA Platform\n{panel}\n\nTo create what should be a simple parent-child relationship between 2 issues in JIRA, you need to define a UNIQUE sub-issue type for every single type of child issue you might want.\n\nSo lets say I have existing issue types Dev Task, Ops Task, Future Planning, QA Task, Documentation.  And I want to create a parent Documentation issue that has sub-issues for each of my depts that will be contributing:  Dev Task, Ops Task, QA Task.  I now have to create a whole new sub-issue (\"sub-task\") type for each of these just so I can create a proper parent child relationship between my parent issue and sub-issues.  And for each sub-issue, I have to duplicate all my previous work on the main issue types with similar names and assign all the right field configs/screens/etc, and when searching for Eng Tasks, I now have to search for both Eng Tasks and Eng Sub-Tasks.\n\nLets get rid of the concept of \"sub-tasks\" entirely, and express parent-child relationships between issues as just that -- defining a relationship -- not entirely new issue types.",

In 4.2, the size of the Comment window is quite small making it difficult to enter longer comments.\n\nFrom http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRA-22046, I understand that this change in behavior was intentional. However, it is not appreciated. Our users typically add long comments and it is annoying to have to scroll all the way to the bottom of the issue to get an auto-sized comment window. The is especially true in our installation, where we have the comments sorted in descending order. The newest comment is not at the bottom of the window. It is closer to the top.\n\nIn the future, can you allow the behavior of the comment window to be a user-selectable/customizable setting? Failing that, how 'bout allowing adminstratrators to set the behavior? Or, perhaps, put a buttion next to the comment window which allows the user to allow the window to expand if they so desire?",

In the attachments section, when clicked JIRA pops up a full size version of the image but clicking a thumbnail in the comments prompts me to download the image. I expect them both to act in exactly the same way (the first way).\n \nOne more thing is that when right clicking to open an image in a new tab I am always prompted to download the image. I am unable to preview in the browser (as I was able to before 4.0).\"\n\n\nIs this something we can address and if so do we need to create diagrams or mock-ups to explain the solution?\n\nMy take is that the new attachments functionality has introduced some inconsistencies within the View Issue page and also with previous versions of JIRA. Ideally we need to make the behaviours consistent and have right mouse click and open in new tab working as expected.\n\nPlease come and chat if you need more info.\n\n!viewing_attachments.png|thumbnail!",

We highly value your feedback in all forms, and through suggestions in jira.atlassian.com is not different. We use this channel often to learn the best we can with how customers use JIRA and how we can continue to improve the experience for as many users as possible.\n\nWe have revisited this issue again recently and wanted to reiterate that there are still currently no plans to implement this suggestion, and it is not currently on any JIRA team\u2019s roadmap at this stage. That said, there are several add-ons on the [marketplace|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/] which should solve some customers' use-cases for this suggestion.\n\nPlease remember that jira.atlassian.com is one of many inputs for the JIRA roadmap. You can [learn more about our process here|https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/110373/how-does-the-jira-team-use-jira-atlassian-com].\n\nI understand that our decision may be disappointing. Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.\n\n\nRegards,\nKerrod Williams\nKerrod (dot) Williams (at) atlassian (dot) com\nProduct Manager, JIRA\n\n{panel}\n\nOn the Issues Search page, there are fields for filtering by Created, Updated, Due, and Resolved dates. It would be extremely useful if I could filter by the Fix Version release date.\n\nEach Version in a JIRA project has an optional Release Date field. If that release date is set, I'd like to be able to filter on it. So, like the Updated Date fields in Issues Search allows for explicit or relative date values, I'd like to be able to create a query based on a Fix Version's release date.\n\nSo instead of saying \"Updated After\" below, it would say \"Fix Version Release Date After\" or something.\n\nExample:\nOur developers work on multiple projects that each have their own version release dates. I would like to create a filter for my developers where it shows all issues that have a Fix Version release date between now and 1 month in the future.",

However, in SAC we observe customers who for some reason modify the hash file, which prevent correct diagnose of reported problems. \n\nDue to misleading output of modz detector, the reported problems are misdiagnosed causing delays and customer frustrations. Also, those support requests Support needs do spend a lot of time on analysing the source code and often look for assistance from developers.\n\nWe could improve the current implementation by either:\n- signing the hash file,\n- downloading its hash value or even the file directly from Atlassian.\n\n\n",

This has been raised 'but dismissed' in JSP-66660.\n\nBasically we have a large amount (10TB+) of attachments currently stored on an external RAID array, whilst the installation of JIRA is on a relatively small SSD in our server. The change implemented in JRA-21232 will force us (in new JIRA instances) to put all the attachments in the home directory, aka on the SSD. \n\nClearly this does not suit how we use JIRA and looks like a major regression in functionality. My i recommend that for private JIRA's like ours we should be able to use the admin GUI to put attachments, log files etc on any UNC path we want.\n\n",

It is on Solaris running tomcat.\nIf we use Jira internationally-in that, we have offices around the world and people go between offices, we have an issue if users have logins that exist to do this in multiple domains. The passwords may or may not be the same. The question is is it possible for the authentication to not exit on the first domain it finds with user if authentication fails and instead have it work in a findall manner from the top of the tree through all OUs? For example, if you have a user EUROPE\\eurcew and CARYNT\\eurcew because the user goes from the United States to Europe, and he is configured to require search all domains under Administration->Browse Users, it will attempt to authenticate him against EUROPE and CARYNT domain. If a positive comes back for either, he is authenticated. I suppose you could have three options: Default, All Domains, and a textbox where you can specify a domain as well, which would be even better. ",

But in order to send JIRA logs to a syslog server, you currently have to modify a lot of files.\nAnd I let JIRA developpers imagine the mess admins have to deal with when upgrading JIRA...
