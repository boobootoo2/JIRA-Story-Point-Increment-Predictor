It would be nice if I could build a list of Persona's that are relevant to my project (or refine for an Epic?) so I can flesh out their details/traits/perspective of them (could be mostly free text description, a name, title and graphic), and then tie the available persona(s) to my user stories. This way when developers are completing the work related to the story they can have a solid understanding of the individual trying to do this task. To assist with project planning, it could be useful to narrow down the work that is going to be performed by focusing on a specific set of user persona's (and thus related tasks), and gradually re-introduce the other persona's in later releases of the product. This could be delivered in a method similar to the Agile \"Columns\"",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-40014].\n  {panel}\n\nWe are using ServiceRocket's SF & JIRA Cloud connector that links SF cases to JIRA issues (objects). Since the JIRA value limit for the custom field value holds maximum of 255 characters, the unique IDs generated from the linkage sums up to about 13 linkages max total. However, there are instances where there are more than 13 SF cases linked/associated to 1 JIRA ticket, this creates problems. One of the problem being that the latter links replace the older ones. Also, only actively linked SF cases to that 1 JIRA ticket get automatically synched. This causes the other inactive linked SF cases to reflect the wrong status or data - causing reporting and metric inefficiencies and inaccuracies.\n\nHere is what was suggested instructions by the Servicerocket Support rep:\n\"The Remote System Reference is using Salesforce Object ID and stored in JIRA database (STRINGVALUE column in CUSTOMFIELDVALUE table). The STRINGVALUE is 'VARCHAR2(255 CHAR)' so it only can store up to 13 Salesforce Object Id. \"\n",

(Seems like it's happened at least once to multiple people we know.) After it happened to me last week, I resolved to report this as a usability problem.\n\nYou can reproduce this by imagining you've gathered a load of disparate information in the \"Create Issue\" Dialog (or actually do it) and accidentally click the \"Cancel\" link, or tap the Escape key. Bam! (dialog closes) Re-open. All your work's gone. Was there a prompt? Nope. (If there were a way to get it all back, that'd be great too!)\n\nMoreover, this behavior creates the need for the arcane \"write-up your bug in and editor and then copy+paste\" workflow, which is awfully painful. Please add a quick confirmation dialog! (or something equally small) Thanks!",

Either JIRA has to show linked pages in the issue filter area or Confluence has to improve the JIRA reporting to include the ability to choose to display or hide ALL linked types of items.\n\nThe tools are nice and easy to use, but it's hard to \"prove\" we have covered our requirements and addressed everything if we have to do this manually.\n\nThank you.\n\nP.S.

However, this checkbox is only available if you edit the workflow or in the draft mode. It would be nice if this option is available even when just viewing the workflow.\n\nAlso, some transition labels tend to overlap each other.

I love using the quick menus, but I find it frustrating that no matter what I do, it always navigates away from the current tab.  \n\nAs an administrator, I often find myself finding issues with our deployment, and wanting to jump to the administration side of things, but keep the context of the problem.  We've recently upped from JIRA 5, where I believe this was possible.\n\nIdeally, if a quick menu's option results in navigation to a url, I'd like:\n# Shift + (Left-Click OR Enter) = Open a new window to the url\n# Ctrl + (Left-Click OR Enter)  = Open a new tab to the url\n\n\n",

However, they have a larger user base of customers who only have access to browse, create issues and comment on a specific Bug tracking project. The situation currently is such that they are paying for licenses for JIRA, JIRA Agile and other development related plugins based on the number of entire JIRA users (majority of which are customers who only require the most basic features of raising a bug, and commenting on it), rather than the actual size of their development team.\n\nThe suggestion raised is to allow a 'Customer' group permission (perhaps a global permission) which restricts member's privilleges to only viewing, raising and commenting on unrestricted issues and which is excluded from the license count. \n* The requirement is not a Service Desk kind of Customer Portal per se as the customer in this case is not able to raise restricted issues/comments.\n\n",

We use the agile way of working but also the waterfall way of working. It is hard for project leads (who aren't technical) to determine which role the have to fill in. (also because we have some workflows which have role based transactions,)\n\nalso for test management we use this and have therefor also created different roles. Now everyone sees there all project roles. That isn't quite fancy and usefull. Can you help with this.\n\nThanks in advance.\n\n\n",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-39838].\n  {panel}\n\nAs a user working in our JIRA instances for several years, \nWhen I do a search, \nI do not want to be inundated with hundreds or a thousand records meeting my search. \n\nIn this case, we have very few technical, power users; we have hundreds of non technical users who do searches to try and locate what they need.  Therefore, they are not going to remember how to use various functions to locate the information.   We want to be able to not allow our search to search across issues in archived versions so that they are searching more recent information.    We do not want to move issues from one project to another archived project because: \n1) You have to setup all the versions, components, issue types, screens, in the archived project to be able to support the move of thousands of issues from one project to another\n2) You would have to create another field to populate (which, if closed, you would need to modify the workflows to be able to edit) so that you can indicate the original project for reporting purposes - especially for financial audits relating to sw capitalization that we have to show the stories/features that were worked on that have associated time and they all need to tie together. \n3) You would have to go back and edit versions to make them unique to avoid conflicts. \n\nThus, keeping such issues in the original project is beneficial when its needed; but, the majority of individuals only want to deal with current work and backlogs - not issues that were closed 5-7 years ago.  \n\nYou may already have this suggestion logged; but, I have the same issue when trying to search your own db's - I get so many results, I give up looking and log what I need - that is the same thing that happens to us and creates unnecessary noise and confusion.
