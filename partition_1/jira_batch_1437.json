Your voice means a lot to us.\r\n\r\nWe're excited to announce that we've shipped an experimental plugin (Atlassian Labs) for Crowd that is able to do delegated directory user pruning.\r\n\r\nThis [plugin|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/1218630]\u00a0allows to optimize your license usage by periodically cleaning inactive users from your delegated directories. After configuring pruning for a delegated directory the plugin will periodically check if the directory contains any users who have been deactivated or removed from the remote directory.\r\n\r\nBy default such users will be deactivated in Crowd. It is also possible to enable \"hard delete\" mode, in which users who have been deleted in the remote directory will also be deleted in Crowd.\r\n\r\nThis plugin can be downloaded from Atlassian Marketplace [here|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/1218630].\r\n \u00a0\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nAtlassian Crowd Team\r\n{panel}\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nWhen a user is being deleted in the AD, it will not be able to login to Crowd's Applications anymore.\r\n But as the user still exisits in the LDAP Delegate, it will count against the license limits (of Crowd, Confluence, JIRA, whatever).\r\n Support (CWDSUP-4973) told me to deactivate the user in Crowd manually in such cases.\r\n This leads to a double maintenance (delete in AD, deactivate in Crowd). In addition the AD admins might not be Crowd admins.\r\n\r\nCrowd could regularly (once per day?) check if the users in their Delegate Directories are still present/active in the AD and then deactivate them if they are not.",

The AD controller then tells Jira 4.3.3 that there's a referral (but we really don't care because we know it's in the global domain), and while other apps we have using ldap simply ignore the referral and continue, Jira decides to throw an exception instead of a warning. \r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nSeems to make sense.

      "description": "Following the instructions for using Jira with Crowd, we migrated our users to Crowd. Once migrated, we noticed a number of users did not make it. 20 users out of 407 to be precise. \r\nThe cwd_user table appears to be completely moved. The missing users are in userbase. \r\nI don't know why/how these tables are used. It is my understanding that userbase is no longer used. When using Jira without Crowd, the users can log in and do their work. When using Jira with Crowd, those users don't exist. Some process must move the users across to cwd_user?\r\nCan you enlighten me?",

Most problems have been solved, but I have one major problem left before I can confidently say that a Crowd based solution is possible, namely creating aliases automatically.\r\n\r\nWe already have about 2,000 Subversion users, but the naming standard has been inconsistent (we even have duplicate user names), so we need to start using a unique identifier instead. All employees have a user identity (UID) that we will have to use from now on. The problem is that a number may be good for uniqueness, but when it's displayed as the user identity, it's not very unintuitive.\r\n\r\nWe also have the problem with the existing identities in the Subversion repositories. We can go in and change these with some scripting, but we'd really prefer to not do this if possible.\r\n\r\nThe alias functionality in Crowd is perfect, as I can say that in the Subversion application, I want 123456 to use the alias Daniel Petzen. The CSV import is also perfect, as it allows me to import all our users quite easily.\r\n\r\nNow, the problem is that it's not workable to manually add an alias for almost 2,000 users, so I was very disappointed when I saw that here wasn't an alias field in the CSV import. That would have been perfect.\r\n\r\nIs there any way that I can:\r\n\r\n    * Import the alias together with the rest of the user data?\r\n    * Automatically add aliases for existing users?\r\n{quote}",
