That would of course mean that a user would always need to enter the captcha, but an unautorized attack would not be able to determine existing usernames.\n\nI would be excited to hear your opinion on that issue.\n\nThanks\nTom\n",

As such the default queries in the Issues page are partly broken from a user experience perspective.  Sure we can edit the templates but that is system wide and that is ugly. Can we get a per-project queries editor in the project configuration?\n\nRelated Q+A:\nhttps://answers.atlassian.com/questions/304765/changing-default-queries-in-the-issue-navigatoron-the-issue-panel",

I am not even sure if the feature request has already been created somewhere else or not.Forgive me if it already exists somewhere :)\n\nBasically, we wanted to request to see if there is a way we can make Custom Fields Required or Optional based on a project and not across the entire JIRA platform.\n\nThanks\nAdhip",

Examples\n\n# find all issues that are duplicates of issue JRA-25640 (one direction, issue specified)\n# find all issues that are blocking issue JRA-25640 or that JRA-25640 blocks (bidirectional, issue specified)\n# find all issues that are duplicates of any issue, or which duplicate any issue (bidirectional, no issue specified)\n# find all issues that are blocked (one direction, no issue specified)\n\nh4. Implementation Notes\n\n* The JQL function that exists must continue to work exactly as it does. If it is possible to overload the JQL function based on arity and this makes a consistent API, then this would be preferred. Otherwise, there may need to be a new function name which provides vararg behaviour as described above.\n* The link index entries added in 4.4 (I think) provide enough to build performant lucene queries for the above use cases. What's missing is the JQL function plumbing.",

Specifically, we run into instances where other business teams require information about software versions that we release into production.  \n\nPeople frequently want to know what issues (tickets) were in a Version (this info is already provided in the Versions tab), whether each ticket was a bug fix or a new feature, who worked on each ticket, and how much time they spent on each ticket.  It would be great if all this information would be readily available to download as a .csv or .xls as well so we could pass this information along to other business teams easily.\n\nThank you,\n\nAndrew T",

Description:\n\nWhat happens currently when editing a description is that your edits are discarded if the Escape key is pressed.\n\nThere are many reasons why the Escape key can be pressed by mistake in today's browser use and varied workflows, and so users end up losing their unsaved descriptions.  \n\nFurthermore, Jira [itself|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Using+Keyboard+Shortcuts?continue=https%3A%2F%2Fconfluence.atlassian.com%2Fdisplay%2FJIRA%2FUsing%2BKeyboard%2BShortcuts&application=cac] encourages the use of the Escape key to clear the focus of the current fields.\n\nIf you click away from a description edit box to lose focus, your work is saved.  However, if you use the Escape key to lose focus, your work is discarded.  This is inconsistent behavior.\n\nThe above behavior is in contrast to how editing comments behaves.  When editing comments, navigating away whether by click, escape key, or page refresh, will popup an alert for the user to confirm their action (when there are changes to the comment).  \n\nI'm not sure why editing comments is given so much more importance than editing issue descriptions, but both edit operations should behave consistent with eachother, as it is confusing for the user to have separate behaviors depending on what you edit.\n\nh2. What should happen:\n\n1. Make editing issue descriptions behave the same way as when editing comments.\n* Alert box will show when there is risk of losing changes.\n\n2. As a way of allowing users to preserve current behavior with mininal disruption, provide users a way to configure the behavior of the ESC key in description boxes.  Possible (but not exaustive) list of choices:\n\n* Escape to discard changes, no confirmation (Current behavior, should be default for existing accounts)\n* Escape to discard changes, require confirmation (Can be default for new accounts)\n* Escape to save changes, no confirmation (Alternatively, can be default for new accounts)\n* Escape only to lose focus but leaving text area in edit mode\n* Do nothing\n\nSee: my [previous comments|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRA-36670?focusedCommentId=692922&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-692922] for a longer rant on this topic.",

What I'm looking for is the ability to pre-define a comment as a post-function and then have this comment added to the ticket as it passes through the transition.
