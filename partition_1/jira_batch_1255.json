This way, it would be nice if you could have an option for upgrading JIRA on the fly (or in background) with no restart required. \n\nThis improvement doesn't ask for a upgrade button as requested in JRA-26054. We could deploy a new installation JAR in Tomcat, or un-compress the JIRA standalone tarball into a new directory, or even use an \"update\" option from the Linux/Windows installer.

It took me 30 minutes to find it in the new AOD/JIRA UI design. That's just a search for a heading, what about when I can't remember which screen an obscure but critical parameter is on? In these cases, I end up googling it, sifting through 2 or 3 old articles, finding the \"where to find this\" and then remapping this back to my own config. A little index of the screens plus some autocomplete would save a ton of work.\n\nI have ranked this as \"major\" given that every time I set about making changes in any part of my atlassian config(s), it generally loses 0.5-2 hours of my day. This in itself isn't the cure, but it would save about 25%.\n\nApplies equally to Standalone and self-hosted.\n\nThis request would be similar to apple osx settings panel.",

If you are a JIRA Server customer, simply go to the \"Whitelist\" section of JIRA Administration and add the domains you wish to request resources from. *Note:* You must have the System Administrator global permission to access this section of JIRA administration.\n\nUnfortunately, this domain whitelist is not available in JIRA Cloud for security reasons. We haven't yet been able to spend time developing a pattern for supporting this in JIRA Cloud, but we do intend to work on this at some point in the future.\n\nI have updated the issue summary to more accurately reflect the current status of this feature.\n\nRegards,\n\nDave Meyer\n [dmeyer@atlassian.com|mailto:dmeyer@atlassian.com]\n Product Manager, JIRA Platform\n{panel}\nJIRA REST API documentation ([http://docs.atlassian.com/jira/REST/latest/#authentication]) says: ... if you are using JIRA in a browser you can call REST from Javascript on the page and rely on the authentication that the browser has established.\n\nHowever it does not work, see my example [http://jsfiddle.net/avalez/nCcq9/2/] and others complains: [https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/69356/cross-origin-resource-sharing-with-jira-rest-api-and-javascript]\n\nLooks like Access-Control-Allow-Origin response header is missing.\n\nCAUTION, to make it really work for remote clients, it's necessary to respond with exact match for host name in Access-Control-Allow-Origin header, see related AMKT-3342 ([https://ecosystem.atlassian.net/browse/AMKT-3342]).",

If so, it makes sense to access JIRA directly (e.g. through port 8080) and try again.\n* Check in $JIRA_HOME/export in case the Support Zip is created there anyway and they just get an error in the UI.\n\nI know these two steps are not a _fix_ but, when there is an issue we usually look for a way to bypass this to get to the logs and help with the actual case.",

Requiring an email has resulted in email spamming and looping when you have email via comments setup. \n\nFirst issue. \nSince you cannot remove a user that is associated with any item, you have to replace the email with something  If they are invalid and someone puts a comment on a page, and notification services are utilized for notifying people involved - then it sends an email to this invalid user.  This results in a reply that you have sent to an invalid user which is added as a comment on the issue since it replied back to JIRA and includes the JIRA issue in the subject.  Since this invalid email comment is added to this issue, it sends another email out....thus, a loop of emails that is never ending\n\nSecond issue. \nWe have set up some generic users to identify roles.  For example, we setup users for roles of implementation manager, integration engineer, developer, etc.  This identifies who is responsible for the issue and indicates whose role it is in queue for. Then, as in KanBan model, you pick up from the top of what is available and assign it to yourself.  Thus, you can always see what is ready for that role and assigned/not assigned; these are also often used when we set up template issues/subtasks.  Then, once cloned, they will make the specific assignments. \n\nAgain, these generic role users require a user ID.  We set them up with a valid email that is aliased. However, whomever it is aliased to must now manage that inbox to delete the emails as they are really invalid emails. \n\nThe preference is 1) either make the email address an option for an admin to identify as required or not or 2) not make it required as all. \n\nEither way, it puts the option into the hands of the customer administrator to understand what happens if they don't input an email (e.g. that person doesn't receive email notifications) which, in my opinion, is pretty clear and self-explanatory.  However, by not requiring it, you avoid all of the email spam and additional management. ",

The purpose of the Business Sign-Off is to have a record of validation that the Business Units are aware and consent to the changes IMT is implementing. \n\nThe problem is for most situations the business does not want to \"Approve\" each issue separately since they tend to not understand each technical change listed under each issue.  \n\nTherefore It would be nice if we were able to have an approval happen on the Version from a group/user instead of having it done on each ticket.  \n\nThanks \n\n",
