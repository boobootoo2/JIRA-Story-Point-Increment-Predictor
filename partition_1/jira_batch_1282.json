You can setup name:value pairs to be used in builds, etc.\n\nIn JIRA, we house multiple projects that follow the same release timeline.  Currently, we need to manually keep all of the versions in sync across projects.  There is already a JIRA ticket in place to address that (JRA-2698).\n\nThis ticket is nearly identical to the \"Global Variables\" request in Confluence (CONF-3999).  In our business, we setup a custom dashboard for each version of our software that keys on various filters (Unresolved, All, Released, Priority, etc.).  When we start on a new release, we have to go into each of the dozens of filters and manually change the fixVersion in the query.\n\nIf we had a simple way to declare a global variable (e.g. $currentFixVersion), we would no longer need to update all of the filters each time we had a release.",

(In fact it will do it only for the last name after the last ',') So we have to add users 1 by 1, which is not nice when we have many users to refer to.\n\n\n(I have created support issue for this, told me to create an issue on jira: https://support.atlassian.com/browse/JSP-76789) ",

Migrating whole directories:\n1.1 Internal to Internal with Delegated Auth\n1.2 Internal with Delegated Auth to Internal\n\nand \n\n2. Migrating users from one directory to another:\n2.1 Individually\n2.2 All users in a directory\n\nWe have started working on a fix for 1.1 and 1.2 and we believe this will solve most the of the problems outlined in our research thus far. We hope to finish up this fix in the next few weeks and release it in 5.0.x.\n\nWe'll continue to update this issue as more information comes to hand.\n\nRegards,\n\nRoy Krishna\nJIRA Product Management\n{panel}\n\\\\\n\nOnce a user created in 1 directory, there is no way to migrate the user to other directory.

What kind of notification scheme is being used? Which workflow scheme is it using? Which users have what set of project roles?\n\nCurrently there's no way for a user to see this kind of information (at least I can't find anything in jira.atlassian.com, neither in 3.13.5 I am using.).\n\nThe only ones who can see this information are jira-(system)-administrators.\n\nIt would be great is users could see this information. Currently what happens is one of the following:\n\n- Users come to me and ask me to explain (over and over again)\n- I might buy confluence and explain everything in some confluence space/page.\n- People are confused about the projects settings and stop to care about them, leaving issues in incorrect states, etc. (\"Don't make me think\", Steve Krug)\n\nBy adding an extra tab to the browse project page could help out a lot!\n\nA nice example of a similar solution, but for workflow conditions is the [Conditions Validator plugin|https://plugins.atlassian.com/plugin/details/39261]\n\n",

This solution does not scale well with large directories.\n\nOut-of-the-box JIRA crashed with OutOfMemory error after 15 minutes.  After tripling the memory (512min/768max) JIRA got further:\n{noformat}\n[atlassian.crowd.directory.DbCachingRemoteDirectoryCache] synchronised [ 24241 ] users in [ 4713513ms ]\n[directory.ldap.cache.UsnChangedCacheRefresher] found [ 57440 ] remote groups in [ 6665358ms ]\n{noformat}\n...but then crashed again with another OOM error 3 hours after that last log entry while still processing groups.\n(I was trying to wait to open this issue until I had a completely successful synchronization process to be able to report final timings, but to double the memory again requires adding more physical memory to the machine which will take some time...I thought I would get this issue opened now and report back any additional findings later.)\n\nProposed solution:  Create users in the local database \"only when first needed\" rather than up-front.    Subsequent synchronization tasks should only be performed on existing users in the database.\nI'm also using the term \"only when first needed\" to be intentionally vague.  This would most likely mean when the user first logs on.  But, there could also be other scenarios when a user should be created in the local db as well.  (An admin is setting up security and needs to be able to search for and locate specific users, but since the users haven't logged in they don't exist in the db.  Users should not be required to logon as the only means to get a user created in the db; instead, there should also be a way to cause a specific user to get created \"on demand\".)",

We highly value your feedback in all forms, and through suggestions in jira.atlassian.com is not different. We use this channel often to learn the best we can with how customers use JIRA and how we can continue to improve the experience for as many users as possible.\r\n\r\nWe're glad to announce that we shipped a wildcard search for version fields.\r\n\r\nUntil now version searches supported only exact matches, e.g.\u00a0{{fixVersion = \u201c9.0\u201d}}\r\n\r\nWith the wildcard version search it is also possible to search for partial matches. E.g. to find issues fixed in any version starting with \u201c9.\u201d, one can use the search\u00a0{{fixVersion ~ \u201c9.*\u201d}}\r\n\r\nVersion fields are:\r\n * Affected version\r\n * Fix version\r\n * Custom fields that use the \"Version Picker\".\r\n\r\nSoon you'll be able to read more about it in the article about Advanced search\u00a0[here|https://support.atlassian.com/jira-software-cloud/docs/advanced-search-reference-jql-fields/].\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\n\u0141ukasz Jarzembowski\r\n\r\nJira Cloud\u00a0\r\n{panel}\r\nWith the release of JIRA 4.3, users can now specify a fix or affects version with a wildcard symbol in the Quick Search box (eg ff:4.*).

Over this time, components (and their default assignees) have changed substantially from what existed in prior versions, making the list of components increasingly stagnant and useless.  Some degree of separation between major versions is essential yet it would still be nice to be able to apply an issue to more than one major version, while listing the components affected in each major version (which may differ somewhat between major versions).\n\nThe only solution we have is to create a new project for every major version, but this has many downsides.\n\nWhat would work much better is to have a new field \"Major Version\" which defines a separate category of components and versions.  In other words, each major version (\"6.x\", \"7.x\", etc.) would contain a version set (\"6.1.0\", \"6.1.1\", etc.) as well as its own set of components.\n\nPlease give this issue some consideration - I know that this type of issue has been raised before (in a different form e.g. subcomponents) but hopefully this solution is somewhat more viable.",

Each country has its own projects so as you can expect the list of projects is very long and quite scary for a normal user\n\nWhat we want to do is have the projects listed related to the country so only users in FR can see FR Projects, this is obviously very easily accomplished with a group and the browse projects permissions BUT what we want to do is to also allow users to see the project from the other country if they are CC'ed or assigned to any of the bugs\n\nScenario:\n\nFR bug opened by FR user in FR project\nFR project and bug is hidden to UK User\nFR user now adds the UK user as a CC\nUK user can now see the relevant FR project for the bug they have been CC'ed on\n\nAt the moment if you add in \"Current Assignee\" + \"Custom Field (CC)\" into the browse permission the user cannot see the bugs themselves (unless they are the assignee or CC) BUT they see the project listed which it shouldn't be\n\nAny way around this?\n\nThanks in advance,\n\nJoe",

Everything is great so far and I'm ready to test my draft workflow but my only option is to publish it which will update the live workflow. It does provide an option to backup the current one, which is good, but ususlly is not possible to test workflow on the live system. \n\nThere is a workaround for this but it could be better. Here's my only way to do it so far:\n1) Modify the workflow (creating a draft)\n2) Copy the draft into a new workflow\n3) Create a dummy project to test it\n\nIf there are no issues with the workflow is just a matter of publishing the draft. The issue comes if there are problems in the workflow draft and you need to modify it. You have the option of deleting the copy and repeating the above process or modify the copy until you are sattiesfied and carefully make the draft match the copy.\n\nThis is probably a feature request or enhancement.\n\n",

Jira doesn't actually choke on the query, but it gets hammered trying to read the DB, convert and then feed the XML results back to Confluence.\n\nI was going to suggest just appending the result size to the end of each of the slow query entries, but I thought there's quite a strong chance that the query itself might not take that long. It's the time taken to feed up the XML results that kill us. So it may be better to log all queries that return great than a set threshold of results (like 10,000 for example)\n\nI think this problem+enhancement applies to all situations where Jira is not paging a result set. So I'm guessing XML, RSS, Excel, Word, Full Content, and Printable views get hit with this kind of issue. \n\n",

Your feedback is key to helping us understand how you use JIRA so we can continue improving your experience. We have reviewed this issue over the last few days; unfortunately we don't have any plans to support this in JIRA for the foreseeable future.\n\nPlease remember that jira.atlassian.com is one of many inputs for the JIRA roadmap. You can [learn more about our process here|https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/110373/how-does-the-jira-team-use-jira-atlassian-com].\n \nI understand that our decision may be disappointing. Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.\n \nRegards,\nDave Meyer\ndmeyer@atlassian.com\nProduct Manager, JIRA Platform\n{panel}\n\nFrom the Administration User Browser screen, have an \"Export List\" button/link that exports all the users that match the current filter into a .CSV or Excel file. The columns exported would match the columns currently displayed: Username, Email, Full Name, Login Details, Groups. No formatting needed, just dump the text as displayed in each table cell into a single field (including carriage returns for multi line entries like Login Details).\n\nThis would be much simpler than having to run queries to do this as described at http://confluence.atlassian.com/x/FYJyCw\n\nThe end goal is a simple way to monitor who is logging in most often (need to contact the top 50 users), who has had many recent login failures, who belongs to one group but not another, etc.",

This can make life very difficult for them, when they try to Manage Filters (Issues > Manage Filters).  A given filter may only take a few seconds to update, but with so many filters the page overall can take 6-8 minutes to refresh.  \n\nIf the user is trying to work just a few filters, for example to share with other users, then they still have to take the performance hit for the whole list, despite only being focused on a few filters.\n\nWe would like to request that the Manage Filters page be paginated, and show only a few filters (or a configurable bound) per page.  Or allow a user to configure which sub-set of filters is actively visible.  \n\nNote that the key feature is that the page needs to show the filter and the number of matches for the filter.  We did try and use:\n\nhttps://studio.plugins.atlassian.com/wiki/display/JOUT/Filter+List+Plugin\n\nBut it does not meet this key requirement, and its buggy/difficult to use :( \n\nHowever if pagination can be added to the Manage Filters page, it should resolve the resolve the performance issue in a reasonable way.\n\n",
