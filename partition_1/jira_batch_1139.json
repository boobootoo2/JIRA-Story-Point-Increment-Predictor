Why this is important\nAs many users are using JIRA it is not possible for them to remember the exact word for each of their search hence a suggestion while they are tying the words would be very helpful for the customer. \n \nh3. Workaround \nThe search Bar still works but it do not provide a search suggestion or Layout as shown in JIRA Cloud",

In addition, this form of customization is also unsupported as per the [Atlassian Support Offerings |https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/Support/Atlassian+Support+Offerings].\n\nh3. Suggested Solution\nProvide the users with the ability to edit those files through the GUI or provide an alternative simpler method.  \n\nh3.

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-64883].\n  {panel}\n\nWe use email as a method for adding comments to JIRA issues. \u00a0This is an excellent method for tracking issue history, especially in \"business\" projects that are big on communications. \u00a0User can send emails and CC a JIRA email address to add it to a comment. Sweet. Regular users have an embedded code in their signatures and we use the \"Add a comment before a specified marker\" handler to truncate the user signature and message history from the saved JIRA comment.\n\nThis generally works well but it a problem with some users eg external consultants and occasional users who don't who don't use the truncation code. \u00a0An email may have one or often several images plugged into their signature, like a company logo, a facebook logo, a think-before-printing message, etc. \u00a0With an email history, they may be adding a bunch of both their and others logos in one easy/nasty hit.\n\nIn these cases, a large number of attachments can build up via an email exchange making the \"real\"\u00a0issue content hard to see. \u00a0*These are a ***** grind to delete*. \u00a0To delete, the user must click the _bin_\u00a0icon, then wait for the confirmation screen, then click ok. \u00a0That's not a problem one-off but extremely slow and frustrating for deleting 20 attachments.\n\nSolution 1: (quick) Allow attachments to be checked and bulk deleted on the attachments page.\n\nSolution 2 (much better!) : Use a hash to detect duplicate attachments and only display the latest on the main issue page. \u00a0Duplicates are displayed in the attachments window and a single \"Delete duplicates\" button click kills all but the most recent version.\n\nSolution 3 (even better!) \u00a0In addition to detecting and displaying only the latest attachment as above, allow attachments to be marked as junk.\n\nOnce marked as junk:\n # They are not displayed on the main issue page at all, significantly reducing clutter. :)\n # Only a single copy is kept, and this is shown in a new \"junk\" section/link on the attachments page. \u00a0(Marked: \"These attachments are never displayed or retained\")\n # It should be possible to unjunk an attachment to allow it to be displayed from then on.\n\n_To work really nicely, the junk attachments list\u00a0would be be global across the project._\u00a0 If this is an issue, maybe a switch could control it? \u00a0(Allowing junk declarations across the whole instance would be quite spiffy\u00a0for those pesky facebook icons but might\u00a0be considered a bit of a bit of a risk and generate an authorisation problem...)\n\nAutomatic removals could be logged for audit purposes if this doesn't clutter the activity log. \u00a0And the _don't delete anything that is not in the junk library_\u00a0rule means that there is always a copy available if it is actually\u00a0required. \u00a0 \u00a0",

Summary\n\nThe lucene index files location health check fails for BTRFS and probably other sub-volume file system mounts.\nh3. Environment\n * Linux server\n * BTRFS sub-volume mounted\n\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\n # Mount a BTRFS sub-volume\n # Configure JIRA to store index files on BTRFS volume mount\n # Run health check\n\nh3. Expected Results\n\nHealth check is able to resolve the volume and validate conditions are met to pass the check, or fails based on conditions.\nh3. Actual Results\n\nThe below exception is thrown displayed in the health check:\n{noformat}\nException during check invocation: java.lang.RuntimeException: java.lang.RuntimeException: java.io.IOException: Mount point not found\n{noformat}\nh3. Notes\n\nIt looks like there is an issue with Java and sub-volume mounts in linux which BTRFS supports. Here's an open issue describing the problem for OpenJDK:\n * [JDK-8165852 - (fs) Mount point not found for a file which is present in overlayfs - Java Bug System|https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8165852]\n\nWhile OpenJDK is not supported by Atlassian, it appears that the Oracle Java impelmentation has the same issue as noted in this thread by Elasticsearch users seeing the same issue with BTRFS:\n * [unable to start elasticsearch on btrfs subvolume \u00b7 Issue #14337 \u00b7 elastic/elasticsearch \u00b7 GitHub|https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/14337]\n\nThe call that throws the exception is:\n{code:java}\nFiles.getFileStore()\n{code}\nh3. Workaround\n\nMove the JIRA home directory to a non sub-volume mounted file system.\n\nThere is also a BTRFS specific workaround mentioned in the Elasticsearch issue, but it is specific to their configuration and linux version.",

For example I just tried an import with \"issuetype\" (where JIM requires \"issueType\"). Instead of just getting an error in the administration page I get a stack trace on the console (see https://paste.atlassian.com/view/7945) and the import process halts. I can't stop it using the \"Stop Import\" button, it's basically broken and I have to reload the plugin to move forward. \n\nCould we improve this please?",

interrupted or torn down during the large attachment transfer. This causes the entire import to fail.\n\nh3.Workaround\nExport the repository directly to a file via Bitbucket import\\export function. The archive will contain both the attachments and the JSON issue data export. Identify the largest attachments after extracting the archive and cross reference the JSON issue export using the attachment file names. You can then identify the specific issues in the repository that contain the large attachments. These can then either be deleted from the Bitbucket repository or downloaded and then deleted from the repository so that the import can proceed. The attachments can then be manually re-added to the corresponding imported JIRA issue.",
