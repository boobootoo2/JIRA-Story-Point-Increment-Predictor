Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Create a custom field type with \"Text field(read only)\" and use it in your screens.\r\n # Enter values in numbers like (1 to 100) for this custom field in issues.\r\n # Try to use JQL in the card layout to display all these issues to be highlighted in a specific colour if it ranges from 1 to 25(example).\r\n # The JQL would be of below format and you will get an error stating as expected as it is a text field itself - *_\"The operator '>' is not supported by the 'JQL(readonly)PCS-39933[Short text]' field.\"_*\r\n{code:java}\r\n\"JQL(readonly)field[Short text]\" > 1 AND \"JQL(readonly)field[Short text]\" <= 25\r\n{code}\r\n\r\n # If you use the number custom field then the same query will return results as expected.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n - It would be good to have a field in read-only mode for numbers so the customer can use them to highlight these issues in their boards.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n - As the number custom field is editable, they cannot use this field and if they try to use an alternative with a Short text type, then it gives an error as it does not support number values.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nCurrently there is no known workaround for this behavior. A workaround will be added here when available",

Issue Summary\r\n\r\nWhen using the REST API endpoint:\r\n[https://YOUT_INSTANCE.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/notificationscheme|https://yout_instance.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/notificationscheme] it will retrieve all notification schemes even from projects which are in the trash. The problem here is that there is no way to distinguish the next gen notification schemes from the normal ones because after moving next gen project to the trash the end point will remove the scope property from the response.\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n*Before moving next-gen project to the trash:*\r\n{code:java}\r\n{{\r\n   \"maxResults\":50,\r\n   \"startAt\":0,\r\n   \"total\":2,\r\n   \"isLast\":true,\r\n   \"values\":[\r\n      {\r\n         \"expand\":\"notificationSchemeEvents,user,group,projectRole,field,all\",\r\n         \"id\":10000,\r\n         \"self\":\"https://YOUT_INSTANCE.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/notificationscheme/10000\",\r\n         \"name\":\"Default Notification Scheme\"\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n         \"expand\":\"notificationSchemeEvents,user,group,projectRole,field,all\",\r\n         \"id\":10293,\r\n         \"self\":\"YOUT_INSTANCE.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/notificationscheme/10293\",\r\n         \"name\":\"NGP: Simplified Notification Scheme\",\r\n         \"scope\":{\r\n            \"type\":\"PROJECT\",\r\n            \"project\":{\r\n               \"id\":\"10360\"\r\n            }\r\n         }\r\n      }\r\n   ]\r\n}\r\n{code}\r\n*After moving next-gen project to the trash***\r\n{code:java}\r\n{\r\n   \"maxResults\":50,\r\n   \"startAt\":0,\r\n   \"total\":2,\r\n   \"isLast\":true,\r\n   \"values\":[\r\n      {\r\n         \"expand\":\"notificationSchemeEvents,user,group,projectRole,field,all\",\r\n         \"id\":10000,\r\n         \"self\":\"https://YOUT_INSTANCE.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/notificationscheme/10000\",\r\n         \"name\":\"Default Notification Scheme\"\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n         \"expand\":\"notificationSchemeEvents,user,group,projectRole,field,all\",\r\n         \"id\":10293,\r\n         \"self\":\"https://YOUT_INSTANCEatlassian.net/rest/api/3/notificationscheme/10293\",\r\n         \"name\":\"NGP: Simplified Notification Scheme\"\r\n      }\r\n   ]\r\n}{code}\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nThe response payload should not contain the notification schemes from next gen projects which are moved to the trash. This is the behavior for workflows and issue types for next gen projects it would be awesome to have the same behavior here as well.\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nThe response contains scoped notification schemes for next-gen projects that are trashed.\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nFor the moment there is no way to distinguish Notification scheme from next-gen project in the trash and normal notifcation scheme so there is no known workaround.",
