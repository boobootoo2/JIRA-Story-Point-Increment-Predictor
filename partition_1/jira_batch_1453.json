If I enter one of the subgroups located in the OU=Planit Security Groups to the users DN, it will return all the users listed in this group. This would be OK if all the users are contained in the same groups, but they are split between an ou=Sydney and an ou=Mlebourne where they are listed as\" members of\" the OU.\r\n\r\nDoes Crowd perform a recursive search through the tree structure search for the object class = \"user\" starting from the specified DN which in out case is \"OU=PLanit SecurityGroups \" as the baseDN = DC=planit,DC=local\".\r\n\r\n\r\nIs there a work around for this or how do I tell Crowd to search the sub tree for user objects. I dfon't want to have to create 2 additional directory connectors just to deal with users located into different OU's. The reason we have split users into geographical locations is that their logins and accounts are managed by their replicated accounts on a local server.\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you for your assistance\r\n\r\nRegards\r\n\r\nShane Parkinson",

We have two options (from what I can see to implement this feature):\r\n# Provide a configuration item to the jiraportlet marco to tell it to grab the Crowd authentication token from the users session (cookie) and use that (assuming that we are on the same domain).\r\n# Re-write the plugin as an 'ajax-based' macro so the browser makes the request and not Confluence, this would then simply use the currently authenticated Confluence user for the request on JIRA.\r\n",

Whilst this is something we would like to implement some day, it is not at the forefront of our upcoming backlog.\r\n\r\nWe will be focussing on improving the integration of Crowd within our Atlassian suite of products, as well as simplifying and improving the overall user management and administrative experience.\r\n\r\nIf our backlog changes and this feature request becomes a priority, this ticket will be updated. If you'd like to better understand how we make roadmap decisions, have a read of : https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DEV/Implementation+of+New+Features+Policy\r\n\r\nCheers, Helen Hung\r\nAtlassian Product Management\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\nIt would be useful to have support for Kerberos-based authentication",

Therefore  the api to access the authentication token using  request object is failing. Crowd must introduce another api with HttpAuthenticator to retrieve authentication token from response object\r\n\r\n",

In particular, the hibernate mapping file at the root of the jar (which is unnecessary in making a client) gets picked up by Grails when included in a Grails project and Grails tries to create Hibernate domain objects for the listed mappings. Removing the hibernate mapping file from the jar works, but I think it would be nice to have a seperate, slimmed down Crowd-client.jar which only has what is required to get a client running.\r\n\r\nMore work, I know, but it would be nice...\r\n\r\nAlso, requirements for client integration are sparse, but that is addressed elsewhere.\r\n",
