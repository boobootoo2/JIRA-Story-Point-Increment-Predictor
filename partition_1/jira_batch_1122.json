Problem Definition\r\n * \u00a0 User wants to create tickets from Cisco Spark using a bot, which would set the person requesting the creation of this ticket as the *reporter*. What happens is that the bot is being set as the reporter instead of the person who requested the issue. In order to change the Create Issue fields, the bot *must* have Project level permissions. In instances where there are too many projects, this can be a bit laborous.\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n * Create a new Global permission that would allow scripting the bot so that it would be able to change field data regardless of project\u00a0\r\n\r\nh3. Why this is important\r\n * \u00a0Facilitating issue creation when using\u00a0bots\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n # Manually add permissions for the bot for each project desired.\r\n\r\n\u00a0",

      "description": "This was discovered by a customer through their add-on Automation for JIRA, but basically there's timing related race-conditions in JIRA, which can cause issue transitions to fail, if the transition happens in an issue created event listener.\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Someone creates an issue (sub-tasks are even worse - see below)\r\n # Implement a custom issue event listener in an add-on that listens for the issue created event\r\n # In this event handler attempt to retrieve available transitions and try to transition the issue that was just created\r\n # Run JIRA with an external database (preferably with quite a bit of network latency). Even so it will only happen sometimes due to timing issues and execution order.\r\n\r\n2 things will happen:\r\n 1. \u00a0IssueWorkflowManager.getSortedAvailableActions() will sometimes return an empty list. This is due to the fact that OSWorkflow has not initialised the workflow state in the database yet (the issue created event can fire before this has finished!)\r\n\r\n2. If the issue is a sub-task, the transition validation may fail due to the fact that the issue link between parent & sub-task issue hasn't been created yet. The operation will fail with a \"Issue type is a sub-task but parent issue key or id not specified.\" validation error. The underlying cause here is that the parent -> sub-task link is created *after* the sub-task is created and *after* the issue event fires\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\nh3. Notes\r\n\r\nIt's a hard to re-produce problem since it's related to timing. Adding network latency between JIRA & the database makes the problem more likely to occur!\r\n\r\nActual Affected Version -\u00a01000.892.2\r\nh3.

Summary\r\nWhen add or remove an Epic Link from an issue and check in the history of the issue you can see that this one action (add Epic Link or remove Epic Link) is being shown twice in the issue history (All tab).

Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Create an Epic issue\r\n# Create a non-Epic issue (Story or Task)\r\n# Go to this non-Epic issue and add the Epic to its Epic Link (Later you can also remove the Epic Link)\r\n# Check the history of the issue\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nThe addition of the Epic Link (or its removal later) would be displayed once.\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nThe addition of the Epic Link (or its removal) will be displayed twice.\r\n \r\nh3. Notes\r\nAdditionally you can set a webhook to a request bin and verify that because of this it sends 2 almost identical webhooks, which only difference is the changelog id, each one corresponding to one of the duplicate history itens.\r\n\r\nh3.Workaround\r\nNone.",
