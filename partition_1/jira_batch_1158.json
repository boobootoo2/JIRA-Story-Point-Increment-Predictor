Overview\n\nSimply put, the Fix Versions field is contentious and sought after, specifically on a Scrum Board as a third tier hierarchy for things like:\n\n- Good packaging and release management (ever accelerating with CI)\n- Tracking the release of an overall product\n- Tracking the progress of a milestone\n- Tracking a mega-epic\n- Tracking related work between two teams in the same project when their epics might be too focused\n\nThe Version Report in the Scrum Board is simply too good to only have teams make logical groupings of code releases with, especially as releases happen in smaller and smaller chunks as teams migrate to CI.\n\nIt is known that an issue can have multiple fix versions, but the Scrum Boards do not support this well (single version enforcement on drag and drop) and the push to use these strategically is doubling up on the desired usage of this field.\n\nI run into this conflict over and over! It's such a useful field, and I'm hoping to have more ways to extend the grouping and reporting without that conflict.\n\nh2. My Request (happy to chat about it):\n\n- Please keep fix versions as the are today, with reporting intact.\n- Introduce a new field (perhaps \"Milestones\") with similar:\n-- Interactions on the Scrum Board (drag and drop)\n-- Parameters for Start / End Dates\n-- Reporting similar to that of fix versions\n- Option on the Scrum Board to either show Fix Versions or Milestones as the primary drag and drop bucket (labs?).  The other would just be an editable field per issue, to not bloat the interface.\n\n",

Recomended spacing would be equal to half the height of a status label. This would then work with the existing snapping to the top, bottom, and center of other status labels.\n\nIssue:\nCurrently, the centers or sides of statuses will snap to the center or sides other existing statuses (and display the relevant guide) for the sake of lining them up in straight lines. However there's nothing to help with spacing. This, together with the fact that you can't move the transition lines or labels (JRA-35712) adds a lot of time to the Workflow design process in order to make a complex workflow neat and clear.\n\nTo Reproduce the issue:\nTo reproduce the issue and demonstrate the need for a grid, grab any status label in the workflow designer and move it in any direction AWAY from other status labels. There are no guides to help ensure that spacing is clear or equidistant from other status labels, only guides that show whether a status label is in line with other status labels.",

The recent works well for this purpose, except if halfway through the day we need to jump to a project we don't normally go to. It then pushes 1 or more desired projects off the recent list then we have to go through the process of listing and selecting the projects all over again.\n\nSame goes with filters although it's not as prevalent because of dashboards.\n\nIt would be very helpful! \n\nThanks!",

PROBLEM:\n\n{quote}\nIf an email message contains an issue key in its subject line and that issue key exists in your JIRA installation, the handler will add the email message content as a comment on the issue, regardless of which project the issue is in.\n{quote}\n\nThe above quoted information doesn't seem to be working as expected. When adding a comment to an issue key from other project within JIRA, it doesn't seem to add a comment despite specifying the issue key on the subject line but rather creating a new issue on the project defined in the mail handler configuration with the issue key as the issue summary. \n\nh4. STEPS to REPRODUCE\n\n# Create a mail handler and select \"Create a new issue from each email message\"\n# Send an email to the mailbox with an existing issue key (from a different project) within JIRA and a random email body\n\nh4. EXPECTED RESULT\n- From this [page|https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiraserver071/creating-issues-and-comments-from-email-802592933.html], it is supposed to add a comment to an existing issue key within JIRA regardless of which project the issue is in.\n\nh4.

However its missing a very critical piece of information.\n\nCurrently we only specify this as far as field behavior regarding the gadget:\n- If choosing a custom field, please note that the following types of custom fields are supported by this gadget out-of-the-box: 'Group picker', 'Multi select', 'User picker', 'Select list' and 'Version picker'.\n- What fields should/are selectable for the gadget and what the logic is in what is selectable.\n\nFrom what I tell it applies all fields that is supports on the instance regardless of wether its relevant to the filter. The field itself needs to be \"statable\" that is to say fields the fields must be \"fixed length lists\" for system fields. However there a number feature request that should be documented in the documentation link such as: \n\n- [JRA-35903|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRA-35903] *Two dimensional filter gadget should include estimate fields*\n- [JRA-37964|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRA-37964] - *Add the custom field type \"Text Field\" for the Two Dimensional Filter Statistics gadget*\n- [JRA-41573|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRA-41573] *'Raised in Versions' field selection to 'Affects Version/s' in Two Dimensional Filter*\n- [JRA-36720|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRA-36720] *Two Dimensional Filter Statistics gadget should allow sorting of values as configured in select list custom field*\n- [JSW-10424|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSW-10424] *Allow gadgets to show statistics using story points instead of issue counts*\n- [JRA-40193|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRA-40193] *Add the custom field type \"Date Field\" for the two dimensional filter statistics gadget*\n\n\nh3.

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-61621].\r\n\r\nOur team manages deployments for all our cloud customers. As such, I'm marking this request for improved platform support as invalid.\r\n\r\nWe have a related Jira Server ticket for this issue, see linked issues and watch that for updates on our [Jira Server and Data Center products here|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-61621].\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nSteve King\r\nProduct Manager\r\n  {panel}\r\n\r\nh3. Summary\r\nJIRA relies on Microsoft SQL Server to have the configuration 'READ_COMMITTED_SNAPSHOT'. This trips up many customers as it's not an out-of-the-box configuration for a SQL Server. This is currently documented in the [Connecting to SQL Server Config Guides|https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiraserver071/connecting-jira-applications-to-sql-server-2014-808761244.html]\r\n\r\nWithout this value, there are parts of JIRA that deadlock, which results in a poor experience for our customers. With the deadlock, the JIRA instance hangs/crashes, typically with a high number of active database connections.  \r\n\r\nh3. Environment\r\nJIRA + Microsoft SQL Server\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nVarious bugs and Documentation request on this such as: \r\n- [JRA-60928|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRA-60928]\r\n- [JRA-27019|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRA-27019] \r\n- [JRA-23622|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRA-23622]\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd KB: [Deadlocks During Operation with MS-SQL|https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirakb/deadlocks-during-operation-with-ms-sql-264045011.html]\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n- JIRA Should warn the customer of this requirement at some point in the event it is not correctly configured and is a requirement. Making this misconfiguration more obvious will prevent customers from running into a common scenario.\r\n- JIRA could avoid using database transactions in such a way which lead to the requirement to have shared locks on database objects. \r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nCustomers that use Microsoft SQL Server are currently required to enable this configuration due to behaviours in JIRA that result in 'competitive' queries in the database. \r\n\r\nThe recommendation to include this in our documentation came from: [JRA-33439|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRA-33439]\r\n\r\nGiven that other databases have some form of transaction isolation on by default, it's perhaps likely that we want to stick with the current requirement to enable it. For example, Oracle's transaction isolation is read committed data only. \r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\nFollow the documentation to set this value as part of setting up the JIRA Database. ",

Summary\nIf you update the issue type scheme while removing an issue type you can get into a state where there is an option in the optionset that doesn't exist. This database corruption was the cause of JRA-45161. Fixing this would be removing another way to get into this state. \n\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\n# Get an instance with an Issue Type Scheme with a set of Issue Types\n# Current Option Set: [1, 2, 3], In the UI I change it to [1, 4, 2, 3]. Where these numbers represent Issue Types.\n# During this processing, delete one of the Issue Types\n# Check the database table optionconfiguration and there could be a possible row with an optionid that no longer exists.\n# Until JRA-45161 is fixed this results in NPE in the UI. \n\nh3. Expected Results\nCan create Issues like usual and the database table optionconfiguration should only have valid options.\nh3. Actual Results\nCannot create Issues or view workflows because of NPE and the database table optionconfiguration contains invalid options. \n\nh3. Workaround\nThis can be fixed by following the workaround in [NullPointerException when creating issue, editing issue, move issue, accessing the Screen tab from the Project|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRAKB/NullPointerException+when+creating+issue,+editing+issue,+move+issue,+accessing+the+Screen+tab+from+the+Project].\n",

Summary\nAttempting to view a report configured for a project that does not exist causes the server to 500. The expected behaviour is to redirect back to the configure report form with an error message (as is the case if you try to view a restricted project as an anonymous user). This shouldn't occur when users navigate to a report through the configure screen, but may occur when users navigate to reports through bookmarks or shared links that go directly to the result.\n\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\n# Configure an Average Age report for an existing project and navigate to the formatted report (substitute Average Age report for any report that has a project picker).\n# Manually change the \"projectOrFilterId\" URL parameter to a project id that does not exist on the instance (e.g projectOrFilterId=project-99999).\n !change-project-id-to-invalid.png|thumbnail! \n\nh3.
