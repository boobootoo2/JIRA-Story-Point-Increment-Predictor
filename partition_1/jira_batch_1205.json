[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-39557].\n  {panel}\n\nDear Atlassian,\n\nMe and my company (www.bedag.ch) have been using the Atlassian products for quite some time and we have noticed the effort you have put in the quality and the user-friendliness of your products in the recent years. Nowadays it's mostly a joy to use Jira and most of the other tools.\n\nHowever there are still some parts where the work is painful especially on the administration side. We are in the process of setting up Jira projects for a big swiss customer, and they seem to be very happy it. They want more and more of their business processes and departments (that have nothing to do with SW development!) to be supported by Jira. We already have setup many projects with many custom fields and field configurations for them, we currently have about 100 custom fields (~10 pages). Since almost each project is different, we need to setup a different field configuration for each, and in this process we must a hide a lot of the fields. When clicking hide/show for a field, the whole page gets reloaded, and the page jumps to the top. One must scroll down again several times and then exactly find, where the actually changed field was and then continue from there. A setup process that could be as simple as a few minutes (when streamlined) can take now half an hour or so, with much concentration needed as well.\n\nSo here is my suggestion: *Could you please change the Show/Hide function on the Field Configuration Admin Page to work via AJAX, so that the whole page doesn't get refreshed and doesn't jump back to the top?* (Pretty many of the other Admin screens could also benefit from AJAXification, but this page would be the most important, I think.)\n\nActually the whole Field and Screen configuration is in my opinion more complex than it really should be, and nowadays I think this is the least \"user\"-friendly part of Jira.\n\nI really hope that even in the short term we can experience some \"admin\"-friendly updates to Jira, so that setting up a project gets almost as easy as using it thereafter.\n\nThanks and best regards:\nSzabolcs",

This is not acceptable for our company. We understand and appreciate the value in preserving comment history. However, we would like the ability to shift comments to different users altogether. We have issues with duplicate user accounts under different name formats:\nExample: Account Holder= John Doe\nUsername 1: jdoe\nUsername 2: johnd\n\nSince the user is actually the same person, we want the option of bulk editing all comments under one username and then changing the commenter to the other. \n\nDeactivating one account to preserve user history is simply not an acceptable option in this case. The day could come where we need to use one of the duplicate user names for a completely different person. \n",

It considers one day before the end date.\n\nh4. Steps to replicate:\nh6. Example 1:\n- Create one issue today (let's say today is Aug 9th);\n- Create a JQL (basic or advanced, doesn't matter) to search issues from Aug 7th to Aug 9th (_created >= 2014-08-07 AND created <= 2014-08-09_);\n- The issue will not appear in the results.\n\nh6. Example 2:\n- Create one issue today (let's say today is Aug 9th);\n- Create a JQL (basic or advanced, doesn't matter) to search issues from Aug 7th to Aug 10th (_created >= 2014-08-07 AND created <= 2014-08-10_);\n- The issue will appear in the results.\n\nh6. Example 3:\n- Create one issue today (let's say today is Aug 9th);\n- Create a JQL (basic or advanced, doesn't matter) to search issues from Aug 9th to Aug 10th (_created >= 2014-08-09 AND created <= 2014-08-10_);\n- The issue will appear in the results.\n\nh4. Expected behavior:\nThis should work in any of the scenarios above, including up to 23:59 on the date created. According to bugmaster in JRA-39465: {quote}created <= 2014-08-09 gets translated to 2014-08-09 at 00:00:00 (midnight) so any issues created after midnight will not be included.{quote}\n\nh4. Recommended behavior\nInclude through 23:59:59 that day. This seems more intuitive.\n\nOriginal text:\n{quote}I saw this created as a bug on [JRA-39645|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRA-39465] and as it was confirmed as a \"by design\" behavior, I think we could improve the code to make this more intuitive for our users.\n\nSo the expected new behavior should be like this:\n* Create one issue today (12th August)\n* Create a JQL (basic or advanced, doesn't matter) to search issues from Aug 7th to Aug 12th (_created >= 2014-08-07 AND created <= 2014-08-12);\n* This issue should appear here.\n\nI really think that this is pretty much more intuitive as the customer will use the last day that it needs to see its issues.\n\nBest regards.\nDiego Zarpelon\nAtlassian JIRA Support Engineer{quote}\n",

So what I want to do is emphasize the important comments or even the summary and the way I usually do it is something like \"h1. Ignore all comments before my comment on _some date_\" which is pretty hacky.\n\nWhat would be great is to be able to star, check, or promote (or whatever verb you want) comments on a thread. Maybe in the set of icons on the right (where the link and edit icons are). Then when other people open the case, only the starred comments are expanded and the rest are collapsed. That way we can present a concise thread to a developer of how we arrived at the case.\n\nWhat do you guys think?",

[See the corresponding bug report|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-39420].\r\n{panel}\r\nh2. Bug Description\r\n\r\nWhen performing Bulk Change, Jira will refer to the *most recent*\u00a0search result as the list of issues to execute the bulk operation. The expected behavior is to use the filter/search result where the bulk\u00a0change was initiated.\r\n\r\nApart on search result, the bulk change progress dialogue also indicates different count of issues than the one being executed. To visualize this better, refer to the steps to replicate below.\r\nh2. Steps to Replicate\r\n # Query filter 1 and got xx issues.\r\n # Opened a new browser tab and query filter 2 and get yy issues listed.\r\n # Go back to the first browser tab and choose Tools/Bulk Change. It shows xx issues.\r\n # Click on \"all xx issue(s)\"\r\n # The Bulk Change process presents you with the issues from the second filter with yy number of issues.\r\n\r\nNote: It also affects navigating to project panel's issues tab, as it is a pre-defined filter and it shares the behavior of search as well. Meaning that if you query filter 1 and navigate to the project's issues panel (see screenshot below). The bulk operation that you toggle will potential shows up as the result from the issue panel.\r\n\r\n!ProjectIssue.PNG|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nh2. Expected Behavior \r\nSince the bulk change is started from filter 1, it should use the result of filter 1 for the bulk operation\r\nAnd the progress on the step 3 above on the Steps to Replicate should be consistent with the numbers of issue for the operation.\r\n\r\nh2. Actual Behavior\r\nIt uses the search result of filter 2 for bulk operation\r\n\r\n\u00a0",

Unfortunately some instances needs to be public and we're seeing some bots causing spam on those instances.\n\nYou may refer the instances below as example:\nhttps://jira.spring.io/browse/ROO-3402\nhttp://jira.phoenixviewer.com/browse/FIRE-12502\nhttp://www.crosswire.org/tracker/browse/BCS-69\nhttps://issues.jasig.org/browse/CAS-1447\n\nFurthermore if you google for \"Search Engine xrk3tw9o fantastic\" you'll find more than 100 results of SPAM caused by a bot.\n\nThank you!\nLuciano Fagundes",

For example, in our SCRUM as we are reviewing issues, we may decide that an issue needs to be reassigned (typically for testing, to a QA dev). When we assign the issue to another user, the board \"jumps\" down to the swimline of the User to whom the issue has been assigned. We then need to scroll back up to the Dev we were working with originally. It is difficult to continually have to scroll back to the user's swimlane where you began, every time.",
