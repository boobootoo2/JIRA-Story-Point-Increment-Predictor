Issue Summary\r\nSometimes, when a user uploads a file into the \"file uploader manager\" (screen-shot below) to post it into a comment/description of an issue using the new editor (New Issue View), the file is displayed as grey, with no name and the Save button is greyed out as well. Only after waiting for a long time the save button will be enabled and the file content will be loaded regardless of the file size. \r\n !screenshot-1.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\nWe suppose that this feature (file uploader manager) has been released with the purpose of making things simpler and easier for users to access their pre-uploaded files and manage them. Yet, this is actually doing the opposite for this particular scenario, if we consider that a simple drag and drop of a file into the comment section actually makes it upload it almost instantly.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Upload a file into an issue, comment section or description section using the file upload manager tool\r\n # Select the file to be added to the issue section\r\n # Insert it\r\n_Note: this is an intermittent behavior so you might not be able to reproduce it at first_\r\n\r\nh3.

In particular, we would need:\r\n * Email handler name\r\n * Count - the number of times the handler was processed during the log period\r\n * Last issue processed time stamp\r\n\r\nI understand that you only keep a few weeks to a month of data in the log. Even a period that short could be useful if we could just run a report ourselves periodically.\r\n\r\nThe goal here is to retire email handlers that are not being used. When there are lots of handlers, and we use the default 1 minute period for checking them, we discovered that some of them can take a long time to process. I had to increase the interval time for all of them to make sure that they all were processed in an acceptable amount of time. Cleaning out unused email handlers would mean I could cut down the interval again.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThanks,\u00a0\r\n\r\nJohn Wilson",

Summary\r\nThis behavior looks similar to a previous bug that was closed as not reproducible at the time of initial investigation:\r\n- https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-70029\r\n\r\nThe behavior occurs In Google Chrome on 1080P monitor when browser zoom is set to 110% in this case opposed to 100% zoom in the previous case this appears to be hardware dependent as well as this cannot be reproduced on a retina display, additional details in Notes section below.\r\n\r\nh3.

Actual Results\r\nText is blurry and distorted\r\n \r\nh3. Notes\r\nThis appears to be hardware dependent for reproduction steps,  I cannot reproduce on a retina display but using the same system with a external monitor model U2414H at 1080p 1920 x 1080 at 60 Hz the blurry text occurs at 110% zoom.\r\n\r\nPrevious case was not able to reproduce which could possibly be related monitor hardware where the tested was performed, and a pixel smoothing architecture to half pixel transform opperations on text scaling as described [here|https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/23590] Which would be impacted by monitor specs, so the error will vary by zoom level Between different monitor hardware used, affected by resolution scaling for higher and lower pixel density.\r\n\r\nh3.Workaround\r\nThere is not workaround at the faulting zoom level so Zooming in or out until the text is clear is the only current option",
