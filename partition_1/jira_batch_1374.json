      "description": "As per the [JIRA Fisheye integration guide|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/FISHEYE/JIRA+Integration+in+FishEye], the following steps are required for a successful linking between JIRA issue keys and Fisheye changesets:\r\n\r\n{noformat}\r\n- JIRA requires FishEye to manually refresh repository cache when repository changes are made \u2014 When a repository is removed, or when there has been any change in FishEye repositories, JIRA does not update the FishEye repository list cache automatically. You must manually refresh the repository list cache. This is done in JIRA: 'Administration' > 'FishEye Configuration' > 'Refresh Cache' link (next to 'Repository List Cache')\r\n- FishEye doesn't check for invalid JIRA issue keys \u2013 FishEye doesn't check for invalid issue keys, such as UTF-8. An error will result if FishEye tries to connect to an issue that doesn't exist.\r\n- FishEye doesn't recognise custom JIRA issue key formats \u2013 FishEye assumes that JIRA issue keys are of the default format for JIRA 5.0 and later: that is, up to 10 letters, followed by a hyphen and the issue number (i.e. [a-zA-Z]{10}-[0-9]+), for example FishEye-123. \r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nBut it also seems like custom JIRA issue key patterns are supported by Fisheye afterall, as the commits with these issue keys are being linked successfully to JIRA issue and displayed under the \"Source\" tab in JIRA.\r\nThere is however an issue with how these JIRA issue keys are linked/rendered in Fisheye in the activity stream:\r\n- A JIRA project key such as \"ABC_DE\", for example: ABC_DE-1 is being rendered as a linked URL in Fisheye activity stream and when clicked takes the user to the related JIRA issue.\r\n- A JIRA project key such as \"ABCD100_EF\", for example: ABCD100_EF-1 is not being rendered as a linked URL in Fisheye activity stream and hence cannot take the user to the linked JIRA issue. \r\n- The linked commit for both keys however is successfully listed under the \"Source\" tab in JIRA.\r\n\r\nJIRA [has announced|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/End+of+Support+Announcements+for+JIRA#EndofSupportAnnouncementsforJIRA-Endofsupportforprojectkeyformatconfiguration%2822November2012%29] end of support for custom keys other than those with digit, underscore and numbers in the keys and the above examples belong to the \"supported\" format. If Fisheye does not supported custom JIRA issue keys, then none of the above two should be linked in JIRA or Fisheye. If they are however supported, then we need to revise the above document and have a consistent behaviour for all custom JIRA issue keys.\r\n",

We have Fisheye indexing about 90 of our git repos and while I've found some success with hyphen deliminated pathing in Fisheye, the usability of Fisheye is rapidly breaking down as the volume of repositories indexed by Fisheye goes up and up. \r\n\r\nWe have two different Git servers; gitosis (which allows unlimited nesting) and Stash (which only allows one level of nesting). \r\nFor Gitosis, this is common:\r\nhttp://gitosis.host.name/git/toplevel/nextlevel/bottomlevel/finally.git\r\nWhich in Fisheye I setup as:\r\nToplevel-Nextlevel-Bottomlevel-Finally\r\nWhich helps users find what they are looking for, given they are used to the many-level nesting. \r\nFor Stash repos, I use the project key, hyphen, repo name.\r\nAssuming the project in Stash is called \"Project\" and the key is \"PROJ\", so something like:\r\nhttp://stash.host.name/scm/proj/project.git\r\nIn Fisheye I setup as:\r\nPROJ-Project\r\nI've gotten positive feedback from users on this method, as it helps people find what they are looking for quickly and easily, relatively. But as the number of repositories indexed by Fisheye increases, the huge pull-down list is not friendly to the average user, and having to flip-flip-flip page after page to look for your repo in other areas of the UI is turning into a negative user experience. So three requests, biggest to smallest:\r\n1) Given how Jira & Stash have projects and Confluence has Spaces, can Fisheye repos be organized at least by a simple single-level folder structure?\r\n2) Can a user set (or an admin set globally, I don't care) how many repos are shown on each page? \r\n3) Can an admin sort/filter on if a repository is erroring? Right now, I go to Adminstration, and watch the \"Location\" column. If there's an error (say, a remote git server went down, or something is taking so long the timeout is being reached before the git operation returns) it shows up in a big red box, but I have to flip through each page of repos looking for \"big red boxes\" do to a health check on Fisheye. \r\n4) Can there be admin email notifications on Fisheye errors? See #3 - it would be nice if Fisheye emailed me when a repo disappeared/was unreachable, not when a user opens up a Jira issue asking why none of the commits are being processed or showing up in Jira. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
