Your feedback is key to helping us understand how you use JIRA so we can continue improving your experience. We have reviewed this issue over the last few days; unfortunately we don't have any plans to support this in JIRA for the foreseeable future.\n\nThere is [add-on for JIRA Server available on the Atlassian Marketplace|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.redmoon.jira.documentvault/server/overview] that may help resolve this request. However, for fine-grained security for files, we recommend keeping attachments in a dedicated document or file management application.\n\nPlease remember that jira.atlassian.com is one of many inputs for the JIRA roadmap. You can [learn more about our process here|https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/110373/how-does-the-jira-team-use-jira-atlassian-com].\n \nI understand that our decision may be disappointing. Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.\n \nRegards,\nDave Meyer\ndmeyer@atlassian.com\nProduct Manager, JIRA Platform\n{panel}\n\nWould like to be able to limit access to attachments to a certain group -- similarly to limited access for a particular comment added.\n\nBefore this is implemented, I'd suggest an expicit warning on AttachFile page saying CommentViewableBy does not affect visibility of the attachment created with that comment.",

Currently, only a fixed group can be added, but it's not relative  to the actual reporter or assignee.\n\nFor example: User A and B are member of G1, User C is member of G2. If the above permission scheme is possible, then User B could view issues created by User A, but not by User C. \n\nThis is extremely helpful if the groups represent different entities, i.e. company divisions and there should be a level of privacy between the entities or groups.\n\nI can't see that this is currently possible, or anyone else asked for this?!\n\nThanks.",

Perhaps it is there, and I've just missed it.  I find no documentation on setting up an environment in which JIRA can be used effectively.  Such a document should include things like \"search the bug list before submitting a new one\", etc. etc.  All the typical procedures that all your customers will have to put into place.  \n\nWriting this stuff, and making it available (perhaps with a license: you may use this documentation if you have a license for JIRA), would make even more managers want to buy your product - it makes our lives easier.  Of course, we will want to adapt the documentation, but these kinds of guidelines are pretty general and embraced by most that use this kind of product.  I am a strong believer in reuse.

I\u2019m Nathan a Product Manager at Atlassian that is working on project configuration for\u00a0[next-gen projects|https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirasoftwarecloud/working-with-next-gen-software-projects-945104895.html].\r\n\r\nWe have been working hard on simplifying project setup and configuration, as one of the Jira team's top priorities right now. We are making a big investment to make project configuration in Jira so intuitive, that anyone can do it. This is no small feat, given that we need to retain the power and configurability that our users expect.\r\n\r\nTo do this we have been iteratively working on next-gen projects (formally known as Agility projects), starting with a simple experience and adding more powerful features as we go. I have been eagerly watching top voted feature request tickets like this for sometime and waiting for the opportunity to work on this feature. I wanted to update everyone to say that my team is actively envisioning what priorities and resolutions +per project+ will look like in\u00a0next-gen projects. \r\n\r\nPlease don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or feedback.\r\n\r\nRegards,\u2028\u2028\r\nNathan Sturgess\r\nnsturgess@atlassian.com\u2028\r\nProduct Manager, JIRA Platform\r\n\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\n*Original request description:*\r\n\r\nAs a JIRA Administrator I need more granular configuration for my projects:\r\n# I want to be able to specify different priorities for different projects instead of having a global priority list. The current global priority can be used as a default, but I would like to be able to change them per project. \r\n# Depending on the issue type, the resolution may be different. For example: in case of bugs, the resolution may be set to \"fixed\", but in case of improvements there is nothing to fix and the resolution should rather be \"implemented\". I need to be able to specify the default resolution separately per each issue type.\r\n\r\n*Potential Workarounds:*\r\nThere are some workarounds that can provide some solutions to this issue:\r\n* [Custom fields|https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiracloud/configure-a-custom-field-991923771.html] for priorities and resolutions can be used on a per-project basis.",

You or the project lead have to relate issues and close any duplicates and so on.\n\nA logical issue checker (LIC) can improve the life of this person. The LIC can perform a lot of checks which can not be provided by the common filter functionality. The following checks are possible:\n\n1) Issues with Status = Closed and Resolution = Duplicate\na) These issues should have a linked \"duplicates\" issue. => Otherwise the resolution \"Duplicate\" doesn't make sense.\nb) The Fix Version field should be empty. => Otherwise a lot of same issues would be appear in a release note which makes no sense. Or different \"Fix Versions\" in several duplicated issues would mismatch the road map.\n\n2) Issues with Status = Closed and Resolution = Fixed\na) The \"Fix Version\" should be set with a specific release version otherwise no one knows in which release the issue was closed. Sometimes a \"Fix Version\" will never be set (e.g. using JIRA as a ticketing system), so this check should be optional.\nb) Linked issues of type \"incorporates\" or \"is part of\" should have the same \"Fix Version\"s or at least one same \"Fix Version\". Otherwise why could this issue be fixed, while incorporated issues aren't fixed or not in the same release (\"Fix Version\").\n\n3) Further ideas are welcome.\n\n\nThese checks maybe very project specific hence everybody has to decide to enable them or only enable some of the checks in his project.\n\nThe \"Logical Issue Checker\" should be a new \"Permission Type\", which is associated to the \"JIRA Administrators\" by default. I think the \"Logical Issue Checker\" is an enhanced filter functionality which is not covered by common filter in the \"Find Issue\" menu. The enhanced filter functionality should have the same benefits like the common filters, e.g. bulk edit. The functionality should be extendable by a new JiraService (e.g. LICService), so that any person can implement its own checks. Furthermore the project administrators can enable and disable the different check services, because not each service is relevant for a project.\n",

We can refine each requirement using comments.\nThe problem is that when the requirement has been understood and validated by everybody, anybody can continue to add comments. At the end, it can be difficult to know what will be developed exactly.\n\nConsequently, it would be great to add a feature to freeze an issue and the associated Road Map. The following features should be added :\n- Nobody can add a comment to a frozen issue \n- Nobody can change a field of a frozen issue\n- An additional \"Freeze Issue\" permission should be added\n- The \"Freeze Issue\" permission should allow to freeze or unfreeze issues\n\n",

We do hope to address JIRA's notification system with more customizable notifications, but the improvements we are seeking to make are more accurately described in JRA-2565. We have no plans to introduce additional scripting capabilities.\n\nAs always, please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.\n\nThanks\nDave Meyer\nProduct Manager, JIRA Platform\n{panel}\n\nthe notification scheme stuff is very cool, but could be better.\n\non several occasions now, I've wanted something where a notification would be sent in certain situations, but I'm unable to express the situations using a scheme.  in particular, although I can trigger a notification on issue create, I can't say \"trigger on issue create, if the issue is in component X, and was not created by user Y\".\n\nit's hard to see a simple way of enabling this from the GUI.\n\nhere's one possibility.  allow the list of notification triggers to be edited.  instead of having a single \"issue created\" trigger, with some number of notifications attached to it, allow any number of \"issue created\" triggers.  each trigger could have an optional attribute, which is  a boolean valued expression in some simple language.  the notifications for the trigger would fire if the expression evaluated to true in the context of the issue in question.\n\nso, for example, you could have some number of primitive operators:\n\n component C  <-- true if the current issue is in component C\n reporter R <-- etc.\n beforetime T <-- true if the issue was created before time T\n \nand some boolean connectives, and you're done.  when an issue is created, JIRA looks for all \"issue created\" triggers, executes their condition expressions in the context of the current issue, and fires the notifications if the condition is true.  or better, the \"issue created\" trigger type could just be incorportated into the expression.\n\nthere are probably other places in JIRA that could use this sort of thing.  listeners, for example, could be configured to fire only for a certain project.\n",

But it would again take time to reassign the required groups.  just by disabling the user i can avoid some time spend on reassigning.  This will be further difficult if the user is assigned to too many projects at different levels.\n\nAlso i would like you to ask is there any work around for deleting the user permanently having the issues assigned to him earlier.

With the introduction of a field that is hideable, not required and not requireable - it would seem beneficial to separate the HideableField interface from the RequireableField interface.

[Custom fields|https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiracloud/issue-custom-fields-844500792.html] allow issues to hold distinct values, often with many restrictions and conditions that exist both inside the Jira application and externally via our Atlassian Connect framework. Considering custom fields introduces many complex use cases that must be considered before commencing work on this kind of feature.\r\n\r\nMerging issues would be a significant investment from the Jira team which would require it to be explicitly set on a roadmap. It is currently not on any Jira team\u2019s roadmap. Any updates on this will be promptly reflected in this feature request.\r\n\r\nPlease remember that jira.atlassian.com is one of many inputs for the Jira roadmap. You can [learn more about our process here|https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/110373/how-does-the-jira-team-use-jira-atlassian-com].\r\n\r\nI understand that some many not agree with our current decision, so please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n Kerrod Williams\r\n Kerrod (dot) Williams (at) atlassian (dot) com\r\n Product Manager, Jira\r\n{panel}\r\n*Original request description:*\r\n\r\nSometimes it is necessary to delete certain issues that are part of another issue without loosing the comments and attachments.\r\n\r\nTherefore it would be helpful to merge these issues in such a way that description and comments are merged with the comments of the 'target' issue attachments are added to the 'target' issue",

However the ones where folks submit a patch too - should be higher priority since someone else has already gone to the trouble of fixing your issue :)\n\nA simple way of doing it is to allow a new field on the filter screen allowing attachments to be filtered out. Or adding a new column 'attachments y/n' to the tabular view of issues.\n\nUnless there's a clever way to do this now already?",

We will update this request when we plan to include it in our roadmap.\n\nFor those that are unaware, JIRA allows for the default assignee to be the project lead or unassigned. Other than that you can use the component leads to auto-assign issues.\n\nFor any concerns please contact me directly. Otherwise let's keep the comments on track by indicating your use cases for this feature.\n\nRegards,\n\nRoy Krishna\nJIRA Product Management\nroy at atlassian dot com\n{panel}\n\n\\\\\n\nI cannot change the default assignee in projects from the administration console.\nAssignable users are defined in the permission scheme, but JIRA does not allow me to modify the default assignee, which is defined as the Project Lead by JIRA. I think this is a bug, because by reading some previously submitted issues, it seams that JIRA allows to change the default assignee and select a specific user.\n",

One could create an issue, or comment on one, and use a known username. JIRA then not only adds a link to that user (not so useful) but also generates and sends an e-mail to that user notifying of this issue's change, possibly inviting him/her to watch it. \n\nEx:\nComment \"This is something I need j.doe for.\" would result in the actual comment \"This is something that I need John Doe for.\" and an e-mail to j.doe@blah.com with a notification.",

I would like to see something much more useful. \n\nPart of this is because I expect to modify the workflows to encapsulate our business processes to the greatest extent possible by JIRA and what I can con our \"Powers That Be\" into letting me do. \n\nI would like to be able to assign different work flows to different types of issues. \n\nFor instance, our feature requests have to be prioritized by a specific committee (at least major feature requests) so the workflow for feature requests will need to go through a workflow that takes it through that committee processes where it will be prioritized and scheduled and so on before being sent to development. \n\nIn addition each issue type needs to have a diferent set of information. A good example of this is with the current setup. I think that for the most part the environment is not meaningful for new features. If I'm going to have different workflows for each issue type, I'm going to need different data to run those workflows.\n\nI would also like to have different priority sets for each type of issue. \n\nI think it would also be useful to establish who can create which types of issue (as a member of the public, I should never be able to create a task, for instance) and also which priorities they are able to set. It possible that I only want certain people to set the priority to certain values (for instance the \"Oh no! Fix this now or the whole company is going into the toilet\" priority should probably only be set by Managers). ",

Your feedback is key to helping us understand how you use JIRA so we can continue improving your experience. We have reviewed this issue over the last few days; however there are not currently any plans to implement this suggestion.\n\nThis request is in a simlar position to JRA-846: We absolutely understand many the logic behind many of the requests for versioned components, but we strongly believe that our focus should be on making JIRA simpler and easier to use. Simply put, versions for components is likely to add complexity on a conceptual level, at a technical level (more bugs and slower performance) and will lead to a more confusing UI.\n\nPlease remember that jira.atlassian.com is one of many inputs for the JIRA roadmap. You can [learn more about our process here|https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/110373/how-does-the-jira-team-use-jira-atlassian-com].\n \nI understand that our decision may be disappointing. Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.\n \nRegards,\nDave Meyer\ndmeyer@atlassian.com\nProduct Manager, JIRA Platform\n{panel}\n\n*Original request description:*\n\nI am a JIRA Administrator responsible for configuring it for complex development environment. Just like the entire project, the components also have their version number. Many times we have projects made up of multiple smaller applications, DLLs or modules. Each component in JIRA should have a list of versions just like the project. That way will be able to release and schedule versions of components.",

Currently, the only reports are the time tracking report and the developer workload report.\n\nThose two reports have a very specific filter which cannot be configured.\n\nWouldn't it be a good idea, easy enough, to use the current filtering system in JIRA, and extend it with a \"time tracking view\" option, so only the selected items in the filter are used in the time tracking report?\n\nSo if I want to do a time tracking report of issues for version 3.0 in the \"UI\" component, i can first do a search for those isssues, and then click on a \"time tracking view\" button/link.\n\nOf course, this ideally should be complemented by the ability to use the time tracking fields on a search (see JRA-961).\n\n",

This is because the CVS commit logs are mailed to the developer's mailing list, and the other messages on the list aren't processed by the CVS Log (or any other) MessageHandler.  However, the mailbox in question has a 20 Meg limit, and at some point in the future it will start bouncing messages if nothing is done to delete the extra messages.  It would be nice, therefore, if there was a MessageHandler which deleted all the messages older than a specified number of days, so I could set up a service to clear out the surplus ones.\n",

It is quite common to find a case where a particular issue involves more than one steps. These steps are too small and not independent, so they cannot be issues.\n\nIf, given an issue, I could maintain a list of TODO items (that I can add, delete, check and uncheck) then it would be easy to keep track on progress, changes on scope, etc...\n\nI found that most engineers, even those that use JIRA intensively, also keep a TODO list on a text file, Outlook Tasks or a piece of paper. It'd be great to integrate these two kinds of granularity in JIRA.\n\nI'd really love to see this one implemented.\n\nCheers,\nPaco\n",

But because I'm using 8 \"Project\" portlets I'm not seeing any project category.\n\nIt would be nice if the project category feature also would display when using the \"Project\" portlets.\n\nOf cause I can imagine that some people would not like this feature.

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-3286].\n  {panel}\n\nThe feature \"timetracking\", which activated the 'developer workload report' is already a nice feature for basic logging of work.\n\nThe estimation of work could be used for project management to check estimated workload of developer, re-assign tasks/improvements for future versions to reduce over-all time needed to finish a future version etc.\nCurrently it's very difficult to check the man-power resources and there workload.\n\nI'd like to suggest some enhancements to make this more usable for the project management:\n\n1. Allow ProjectManager to check estimated Workload of all developer\n\nDevelopers sometimes work for more than one project simultaneously.\nThe developer workload report already takes this into account by reporting the workload of the developer over all projects.  From the point of a developer, the \"workload report\" is fine, but from the point of a project manager it's difficult because she needs to generate the report for every developer.\nWould be much easier when report is created for all project and for all developer.  This could be a bit tricky with permissions, well, right.  But for project manager it would be perfect to get a table like this (JRA and OTHER are projects):\n\nDeveloper       Workload-JRA  Workload-OTHER\n--------------------------------------------\nMartin Skopp              8h        1w 2d 3h\nScott Farquhar          120h             20h\nOwen Fellows             48h             35h\n\nSee also JRA-3111 for another idea how to improve the report.\n\n\n2. Adding \"Versions\" for Workload report\nAddtionally to 1., I would appreciate to get a Workload for single project over all developers and versions, e.g.\n\nWorkload report for Project JIRA (JRA):\nDeveloper              2.6.1             2.7\n--------------------------------------------\nMartin Skopp              8h        1w 2d 3h (x)\nScott Farquhar          120h (y)         20h\nOwen Fellows            4,5d (z)         35h\n\nOptionally, it would be nice to allow the user to select the unit for the work, e.g. standard, like (x) or in hours (y) or in days (z).\n\n\n3. Add date/time field to Log Work on issues \nSometimes, I forget to log my work on a issue and want to log my work the next day.  No problem, this is possible, but the date of the worklog entry is created by JIRA.  I would appreciate that the reporter can soecify a start date of the worklog.  This would allow the forgetful developers like me to create more accurate worklog entries.\n\n\n4. The worklog entries could be used by project management to monitor progress within a new version.\nThe problem is that there are no reports available for project management to check which work has been done e.g. during the last week or days.  Yeah, one can filter all issues which changed within the last days, but a real \"worklog report\" or filtering on worklog entries would be very nice.\nE.g.:\nFilter properties: \nProject = JRA\nVersion = 2.6.1\nWorklogs = -1w to 0 (=relative date one week ago up to today)\n\nResult: all worklog entries (not the issues!) which match.\n\n\n5. Worklog entries do not appear in filter results!  This makes it really difficult for project management to monitor work logs (well it's possible via notification, right).\nSo it would be great if optionally display of worklog entries could be enabled in a filter result somehow.\nMaybe this is obsoleted by 4. already...\n\n\nSo that's it!  The basic feature request is \"make it more easy for project manager to check estimated workload and development success\".\nFor any more questions etc. please do not hesitate to contact me.\nThanks for reading this long issue.\n\nP.S.: I really love JIRA, really.\n\nMartin Skopp\nskopp@riege.com",
