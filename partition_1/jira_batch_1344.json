This will allow you to easily switch your account in these products without having to log out, or use a different browser.\r\n # Support the ability to be logged into different domains (including different Jira and Confluence sites) with different accounts. With this, you'll be able to be logged into Bitbucket with account A, acme.atlassian.net with account B, and space.atlassian.net with account C.\r\n\r\nTo help make sure we've addressed the main use cases for multiple accounts/switching accounts, I'd love your help with\u00a0[answering this short survey|https://forms.gle/B9VmLrriyQ9iDDVB7].

This change will then reflect in JIRA.\u00a0\r\n\r\n*Note* - You will need to logout and log back into id.atlassian.com and then JIRA to see the updated name\r\n{panel:title=Changes to what site administrators can and can't do}\r\nThe Atlassian Cloud Identity Platform has recently undergone significant changes to enable users to seamlessly move across Atlassian Cloud products (specifically Jira, Confluence, Bitbucket, and Stride). As a result, Site Administrators will experience changes in the level of control they have over cloud users. We understand these changes can be difficult, below I'll provide additional details to help you through this transition. Our ultimate goal is to make it easier for users to move between systems and collaborate together.\r\n\r\nThe following is now true for all cloud sites and users:\r\n * *Cloud users own their own accounts*\r\n * Cloud Atlassian accounts are global, allowing users access to all Atlassian Cloud products including Bitbucket, Stride, Jira, and Confluence\r\n * User account information (including full name and avatar) should\u00a0*now be global and consistent*\u00a0on all cloud sites and products, ensuring any\u00a0changes to user account information will be reflected in all sites and products that users can access\r\n\r\nFor the reasons stated above, we\u2019re implementing changes to what Site Administrators can and can\u2019t do:\r\n * Site Administrators can\u00a0_invite_\u00a0any user to contribute to their site or revoke user access to their content\r\n\r\n * Invited users who do not already have an Atlassian account are prompted to create their account\r\n * Site Administrators can no longer create,\u00a0manage, or edit\u00a0accounts\r\n\r\nTo support\u00a0customers with specific security requirements you can now [claim an email domain|https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiracloud/configuring-domains-868983095.html] and manage all the accounts with an email address belonging to that domain. Claiming an email domain creates an _*Organization*_\u00a0(available in the upcoming Identity Manager release) comprising all accounts who belong to that claimed domain.\r\n\r\nOrganization administrators\u00a0_can_:\r\n * Change a managed account's full name\r\n * Change a managed account's avatar\r\n * Update a managed account's email address\r\n * Enforce a password policy on managed accounts\r\n * Apply a SAML login policy to all managed accounts across cloud sites and products\r\n * Delete a managed account\r\n\r\nAn organization administrator _can't:_\r\n * control a managed user's access to a site or product \u2014\u00a0that is done by the owner / site administrator of each individual site\r\n\r\n*Next steps:*\r\n\r\nIf you need the ability to manage your organization's user accounts, we encourage you to [verify your domain and set up an Organization|https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiracloud/configuring-domains-868983095.html] within the Atlassian Cloud identity platform. As an organization administrator, you\u2019ll have the ability to manage all user accounts within your organization and any changes you make will apply across all Atlassian Cloud sites and products.\r\n\r\nIf you have users accessing your cloud content from other organizations, you should encourage those organizations to claim and manage their staff's accounts to apply any policies they feel are important to them. You can manage any accounts' access to your content if you're still concerned about the policy applying to those accounts.\r\n\r\n*Feature requests we're considering that relate to this change* *(please vote and watch those that are relevant to you):*\u00a0\r\n * ID-6448 - Show the name of an accounts' organisation next to the account name in Site Admin\r\n * ID-6447 - Show the type of authentication enabled on an Atlassian account within Site Admin\r\n * ID-6443 - Allow site admin to suggest profile field changes on a Personal Atlassian account\r\n * ID-6237 - Allow admin of managed account to change users avatar\r\n * ID-6457 - Allow a site-specific name for an account\r\n{panel}",

Customer Impact\r\nCases like this though infrequent, when it happens it causes a lot of pain and take a lot of time from the customers and from support. Customers are not able to login and there is no easy way for support to recover. Of Course we can recreate the users, this is fine with smaller instances but with bigger instances (1000+ users) we are talking about hours and hours of lost productivity for the Customers and hours taken away from the support engineer to handle 1 issue. \r\n\r\nWith Unicorn (pre-idplat) - We can actually take the data from the daily backup and dump them back in Crowd but with the combination of Vertigo and Idplat, (users are not stored in the local instance database and restoring vertigo is not recommended) it makes the bad import workflow even worst. \r\n\r\n\r\nh3.

My team has released a last_active field for managed accounts in the [Organization API|https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/admin/organization/rest/]. The get users in an org [endpoint|https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/admin/organization/rest/#api-orgs-orgId-users-get] provides further documentation of this process.\r\n\r\nThis API will provide last active date information for managed accounts, which means you must have an organization and a verified domain. An \"organization\" is a unified view of the sites and products that your company is using. You can check if you have an organization already by visiting [admin.atlassian.com|http://admin.atlassian.com/]. You should see a list of your organizations under \"Organizations.\"\r\n\r\nIf you don't have an organization, you can create one by following the directions on [this doc|https://confluence.atlassian.com/cloud/set-up-an-atlassian-organization-938859734.html].\r\n\r\nOnce you have an organization created, you'll need to claim a domain, which can be done by following the instructions [here|https://confluence.atlassian.com/cloud/verify-a-domain-for-your-organization-873871234.html].\r\n\r\nAfter claiming a domain, you should be able to follow the directions on the Organization API [documentation|https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/admin/organization/rest/] to get last_active data for your managed accounts.\r\n\r\nI hope this is helpful. Please let me know if these directions are unclear or if any additional questions arrive. Thank you for voting and commenting on this issue, and we remain committed to improving the functionality of our REST APIs.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n Rak Garg\r\n [rgarg@atlassian.com|mailto:rgarg@atlassian.com]\r\n Product Manager, Atlassian\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\nh3.
