I have to project manage a particular client where we have deployed a number of consultants. Each consultant is a subtask and I would then like to have each of their concerns as a subtask of that subtask (and if you really wanted to go crazy, make the notes on that subtask a subtask of a subtask of a subtask). For now I just use comments but then I can't track the progress you see?\r\n\r\nYes, I could make a project for Project Management and all of my other concerns but then I don't get the advantage of tracking all of my concerns centrally and placing my immediate focus in \"In Progress\", whilst peripheral focus projects remain in \"To Do\" and I don't completely forget about them over time. This way of working is extremely useful for re-prioritizing as priorities shift and following up on long-burn projects.
