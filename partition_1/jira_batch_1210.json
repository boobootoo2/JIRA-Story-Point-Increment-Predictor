Introduction\n*How user picker works*\n* It figures out the group via Project -> Role -> Group (i.e. determines that the assignable users for project X are the users in the role Y, and therefore the users in the group Z).\n* Uses the configured User Directories (AD, Crowd...) to get a list of users that belong to group Z.\n* Matches the entered characters with the user name, the email address and display name.\n\n*Can you change the interval*\nUnfortunately no. It will do a request 75 millisecond after entering a character. If the user enters another character in that 75ms period, it will restart the timer. In other words, if the user types the name really fast, it won't do a search until the full name has been entered. A hacky way to force that behaviour is to write the username somewhere else, copy and paste it into the field: that will result in just one REST call.\n\n*Will it cause performance issue*\nYes, It could cause performance problems. At least, there are a two potential problems:\n* If the user has multiple User Directories, searching for the members of a group could be slow. Solution: reduce the number of User Directories and/or move the User Directory that will contain the requested group at the top of the chain.\n* If the project has a very broad assignable group, (eg: all the users in JIRA are potentially assignable, but only a bunch of them are actually assigned), retrieving the list of users and matching the characters could be expensive. Solution: create a smaller assignable group, it is better to add users when needed, than to add lots of JIRA users that never get an issue assigned.\n\nh5. Suggestion\nIt would be great if JIRA administrators can configure User Picker, for example the REST interval. ",

It would be even better if Jira natively supported Gitlab (Hosted or The Users Own Servers) just like it supports Stash/BitBucket/Github.\r\n\r\nGitlab is growing in terms of its user base and is definitely a source repository that should be supported out of the box.\r\nh3.

Please notice that\u00a0*it is now possible to also use the free app to integrate with self-hosted Gitlab*, as documented in:\u00a0[Install the GitLab.com for Jira Cloud app for self-managed instances|https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/integration/jira/connect-app.html#install-the-gitlabcom-for-jira-cloud-app-for-self-managed-instances]\r\n\r\n * Follow the instructions in [https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/integrations/jira.html]\r\n * Use any of the other app (free or paid) available on our marketplace:\u00a0[https://marketplace.atlassian.com/search?hosting=cloud&product=jira&query=gitlab]",

Maybe you'd like a button \"reset to default\" or the like, but I don't consider that as hard requirement, as users can always display or hide any field with the existing toggle mechanism.\n\nYes, this is a kind of \"implicit\" user specific customization of basic search, and because it's implicit I do not consider it as new feature, as no additional GUI, documentation, etc is required.

I think this is an issue with jira & needs to be rectify.\n\nJira System should able to update name at each & every place in system, as its not possible for user to go & check/change in each and every board that used old project name.\n\nJIRA Agile (v6.3.13.1)\nReference: JSP-193610\n\nRegards,\n- Vishal",

And when we start creating Jira issues, we only reference certain placeholders or similar on a specific Confluence page.

Unfortunately admin console gives access to everything and I recently had to undo something someone a project someone had started to build in there that they didn't actually need. In most cases most project leads just need access to basic stuff like see who has access to their project and be able to create new users and manage them onto their project not other admin functions...\n\nThanks!\n\nLouise\n\n",

Summary\n\nWhen users attempt to submit information through an issue collector, it can randomly display 'Oops! Something went wrong...'. There is no specific information about what that error is.\n\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\n\n# Setup an issue collector.\n# Set the session timeout to 1 minute as per [Changing the default session timeout|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA062/Changing+the+default+session+timeout].\n# Open up the issue collector.\n# Wait for the user session to timeout.\n# Attempt to submit the form.\n\nh3. Expected Results\n\nThe collector displays a specific error about how the user's session has timed out.\n\nh3. Actual Results\n\nThe 'Oops! Something went wrong...' error appears.\n\nh3. Workaround\n\nIncrease the session timeout as per [Changing the default session timeout|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA062/Changing+the+default+session+timeout].\n\nh3. Notes\n\nThere are at least two ways to trigger this problem. Let's imagine the session timeout is 10 minutes.\n* Scenario A\n** T=0m: The user opens the feedback collector\n** T=0m: A new anonymous session is created (i.e. the user receives a JSESSIONID)\n** T=11m: The user submits the form. The JSESSIONID has timed out and it triggers the 401 response.\n\n* Scenario B\n** T=0m: The user opens the feedback collector and receives an anonymous session (for example, JSESSIONID=123)\n** T=1m: The user submits the feedback. Everything is ok at this point. The JSESSIONID=123 is still valid\n** T=9m: The user opens the feedback collector again. As they still have a valid JSESSIONID, no new session is created\n** T=11m: They submit the feedback using JSESSIONID=123. This session is now timed out, so they receive the 401.\n",
