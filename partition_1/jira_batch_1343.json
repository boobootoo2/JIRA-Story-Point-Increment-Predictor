Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nIf compliant to the GDPR law implement an access level on the REST API calls which will recognize the user making the calls as a site-admin and thus return the user email or full name history for better identification.\r\n\r\nh3. Current state\r\n\r\nThe privacy changes have been [rolled out|https://confluence.atlassian.com/cloud/blog/2019/05/upcoming-changes-to-atlassian-account-profiles] and at the current state, site-admins can only see the email information from all users regardless of their privacy settings through the UI.\r\n\r\nThis means that through the user-related rest endpoints site-admins won't be able to see the email address of users depending on their privacy settings.\r\nIf the email address fetched from Atlassian is being used by any integrations please refer to the below documentation to get your integration migrated into a connect app or to use 3LO and thus get access to the specific endpoint to get user email addresses:\r\n* [Guidelines for requesting access to email address \\- Announcements \\- The Atlassian Developer Community|https://community.developer.atlassian.com/t/guidelines-for-requesting-access-to-email-address/27603]\r\n* [Integrating with Jira Cloud|https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/integrating-with-jira-cloud/]\r\n\r\n",

      "description": "{panel:title=Atlassian status as of 31 Jan 2019|borderStyle=solid|borderColor=#3c78b5|titleBGColor=#4C9AFF|bgColor=#DEEBFF}\r\nHi everyone,\r\n\r\nToday we released documentation for new APIs that allow organization administrators to edit accounts that are [managed by their organization|https://confluence.atlassian.com/cloud/set-up-an-atlassian-organization-938859734.html]. Once you have created an organization and [verified your domain|https://confluence.atlassian.com/cloud/verify-a-domain-for-your-organization-873871234.html], you can use the following APIs to manage accounts:\r\n * [The Organizations API|https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/admin/organization/rest/] is available to list all the managed accounts in your organization. You can use this to enumerate the unique _Atlassian account ID_ for each users.\r\n * [The User management API|https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/admin/user-management/rest/] is available to edit individual users. \r\n** You can use this API to edit attributes for a given Atlassian account ID using the {{PATCH /users/ \\{account_id\\}/manage/profile}} method.\r\n** You can use the {{POST /users/\\{account_id\\}/manage/lifecycle/disable}} and {{enable}} methods to disable or enable accounts in bulk.\r\n\r\nThe types of changes you can make with this API include:\r\n * Enabling/disabling the Atlassian account\r\n * Changing user email addresses or departments\r\n\r\nFor other bulk user management changes, we recommend using the User provisioning (SCIM) API to sync users and groups from an external system. [The documentation for the SCIM API|https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/admin/user-provisioning/rest/] is also now available.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nDave Meyer\r\nAtlassian Access Product Management\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\nh3. Problem Definition\r\nAt the moment, there's no public documented API on Atlassian Access\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\nA REST API allowing org admin to easily manage a huge amount of users.\r\n\r\nProviding a supported API provides the ability for the org admin to perform the atlassian access feature in a bulk.\r\n\r\nAn example would be if there are a lot of managed accounts in the organization, to disable a certain number of accounts would take a lot of time OR if there are a lot of accounts that need to be updated, for example when there's a domain changed, to update the email address for all account would take a huge amount of time. \r\n\r\nWith REST API, this task would be much easier to manage and with less time to spend.",

      "description": "h3. Problem Definition\r\n\r\nIt is quite normal that a user could have created an Atlassian Account via any service and forgot about it. At the moment, if the user is existing in Atlassian Account, they will only be notified that they were invited on JIRA/Confluence cloud. If they are not aware that they have an existing Atlassian Account, they will most likely contact the cloud administrator for a password reset. \r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nAdd the option in the invitation email to specify that they have an existing Atlassian Account and if they have forgotten the password, use the password reset link to reset their password.\r\n\r\nh3. Why this is important\r\n \r\nThis could eliminate additional work from the cloud administrators to educate their users about Atlassian Account and resetting the password. \r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround \r\n\r\nAdd a customized invite email message when inviting users from JIRA/Confluence cloud. \r\n\r\n{quote}\r\nHi,\r\n\r\nYou have been invited to https://cloud_instance.atlassian.net. If you have an existing account in Atlassian and forgot your password, please generate a password reset email via https://id.atlassian.com/login/resetpassword. Access the password reset email to set a new password and you can use this new password together with your email address to login to https://cloud_instance.atlassian.net\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nRamon\r\n{quote}\r\n",

      "description": "h3. Problem Definition\r\n\r\nThere's a bit of a feature disparity between domains controlled through the domain verification and g suite controlled domains;\r\n\r\nOne advantage seen by verifying your domain (through Organization) is that you can see a complete list of verified email addresses and users registered on your domain across whole Atlassian Account.\r\n\r\nThis way you get a clear indication of all currently active Atlassian users from within your domain, whereas when you use the G Suite integration you will only see the accounts currently being synced through your groups, any manually created users with email addresses on your domain will not show up.\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nAs such, the G Suite integration in itself could also have good use of the User Management page from the organization management section, for the domain claimed using the G suite integration.\r\n\r\nh3. Why this is important\r\n \r\nVerifying a domain that has been claimed in G Suite is not allowed in Organization, and performing it will override the G Suite domain claim. This way, we are not able to check the Managed Accounts under our domain anymore.",
