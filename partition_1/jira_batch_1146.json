Environment:\n * JIRA, listening on a context path of {{https://base-url/jira/}}\n * A SAML/SSO product responding to {{https://base-url/saml/}}\n\nh5.Diagnosis\nPerforming a cURL to the base URL shows a redirect loop (extraneous headers stripped for clarity):\n{code:java}\n% curl -I -L https://base-url/jira\n\nHTTP/1.1 302 Found\nDate: Mon, 09 Jan 2017 08:52:28 GMT\nServer: Apache\nLocation: https://base-url/saml\n\nHTTP/1.1 302 Moved Temporarily\nCache-Control: private\nDate: Mon, 09 Jan 2017 08:52:28 GMT\nLocation: https://base-url/jira\n\nHTTP/1.1 302 Found\nDate: Mon, 09 Jan 2017 08:52:28 GMT\nServer: Apache\nLocation: https://base-url/saml\n\nHTTP/1.1 302 Moved Temporarily\nCache-Control: private\nDate: Mon, 09 Jan 2017 08:52:28 GMT\nLocation: https://base-url/jira\n\nHTTP/1.1 302 Found\nDate: Mon, 09 Jan 2017 08:52:28 GMT\nServer: Apache\nLocation: https://base-url/saml\n\nHTTP/1.1 302 Moved Temporarily\nCache-Control: private\nDate: Mon, 09 Jan 2017 08:52:28 GMT\nLocation: https://base-url/jira\n{code}\nIn the scenario this issue is derived from, the customer had whitelisted calls to the REST API to not go through the SAML/SSO configuration. This means that while gadgets worked correctly, the Health Check failed due to the circular reference.\n\nh3. Suggested Solution\n\nUpdate the check to query the gadget spec URL instead of the base URL, and rename it appropriately.\n\nAlternatively for customers who are not able to make the modifications to exclude all requests from JIRA, it'd be great to either allow or just test an extra URL, either in addition to or instead of the current URL for testing which is the base URL.\n\nBeing able to detect circular redirects or too many redirects would also be a really good improvement to this health check.\n\nh3. Workaround\nFor customers who do not wish to see or be alerted by the failing health check, you can take the following steps:\n # Go to Manage Add-ons\n # Select All add-ons and search for \"Instance Health Plugin\"\n # Expand the plugin and then expand the modules\n # Disable {{jira.healthcheck.baseurl.name}}",

The report is based on the date selected in the field. The current language means the date that the field was changed.\n- Let's say that today, 14/Dec/16 I set a field to 09/Jan/17, \"the date that the field was set\" is 14/Dec/16. The report uses the value of the field, 09/Jan/17.\n\nh3.

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-63773].\n  {panel}\n\nWe've recently introduced a transition condition that ensures an issue cannot be resolved if it has an open review.\n\nThis often causes confusion because an issue with an open review does not provide any information as to why the resolve button is missing (or the drop target on an agile board). This means users are often confused as to why the button isn't present.\n\nIt would be very useful if the button were to be visible but greyed out in some way, with additional details on hover (for example) to describe what conditions are not met so a user can see what they need to do before they can advance in the workflow.\n\nOn an agile board, the drop target could be shown in a different colour for a transition with an unmet condition, and a dialogue explaining the unmet condition could show when a user attempts to drag an issue to a drop target.\n\nPermission based conditions could probably be exempt from this, as it may lead to more confusion. Alternatively, an administrator could be given an option when adding a workflow condition to show the transition in a disabled state with a reason rather than hiding the transition completly.",

Suggested Solution\nHave JIRA check if the new application is compatible before the installation, and if it is not, display a warning to the admin notifing him of this.\n\nh3. Why this is important\nIf an admin mistankingly uploads a .obr file for a application not compatible with the current JIRA Core version, this will make it so that application stops functioning.

The current list of such characters is:\n{code:java}\n+ - & | ! ( ) { } [ ] ^ ~ * ? \\ :\n{code}\n{quote}\n\nHowever, it is not working as expected. Searching like summary !~ \"*\\\\]\" fails with error \"The text query '*\\]' for field 'summary' is not valid: the '*' and '?' are not allowed as first character in wildcard query\" and summary !~ \"\\\\]\" returns all the issues. \n\nI came across to this [bug report|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRA-40790] which was eventually not closed as *Answered*. \n{quote}\nTo do this we use Lucene's ClassicTokenizer which:\n# Splits words at punctuation characters, removing punctuation. However, a dot that's not followed by whitespace is considered part of a token.\n# Splits words at hyphens, unless there's a number in the token, in which case the whole token is interpreted as a product number and is not split.\n# Recognizes email addresses and internet hostnames as one token.\n\nAs a result the \"[\" and \"]\" characters are neither added to the index or retained in the phrase query.\n{quote}\n\nThere were comments about documentation update to avoid confusion but there was no follow up whether a ticket has been created for that or not. So here it is. \n\n\n\n",

Summary\n\nUsers in JIRA are not notified of issues or comments created via email, even if they should. Same users are notified of issues or comments to issues if they are created in UI. We've been able to replicate this consistently in clean instances.\n\nh3. Environment\n\nJIRA Cloud, version: 1000.656.2 (not available in Affects Version/s field)\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\n # Create a ticket via email using User A (with access) - make sure User B is notified for 'Issue Created'\n # Add User B as watcher to the ticket - make sure that watcher are notified for 'Comment created'\n ** This is an example, we could also replicate this by assigning the ticket to User B, instead\n # Add a comment to the ticket via UI (comment 1)\n # As User A send a comment to this ticket via email (comment 2). You can use the notification from comment 1.\n\nh3. Expected Results\n\nUser B is notified for\u00a0issue creation and both comment 1 and comment 2.\nh3. Actual Results\n\nUser B is only notified on comment 1.\nh3. Notes\n\nThis is very similar to this bug:\n https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRA-63582\n\nHowever, that one is for JIRA Server and for Outlook, so I'm not sure if they are related.\nh3. Workaround\n\nFrom [~jtillett916844748]:\n\n{quote}\na workaround would be to create a filter to look at issues created in the past 15 minutes and create a subscription to fire every 15 minutes. Dirty, but it's something. \n{quote}\n\nOriginal comment [HERE|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRA-63694?focusedCommentId=1006194&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-1006194]",
