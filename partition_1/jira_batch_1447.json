Whilst this is something we would like to implement some day, it is not at the forefront of our upcoming backlog.\r\n \r\nWe will be focussing on improving the integration of Crowd within our Atlassian suite of products, as well as simplifying and improving the overall user management and a unified administrative experience.\r\n \r\nIf our backlog changes and this improvement request becomes a priority, this ticket will be updated. If you'd like to better understand how we make roadmap decisions, have a read of : https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DEV/Implementation+of+New+Features+Policy\r\n \r\nCheers, \r\nHelen Hung\r\nAtlassian Product Management\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\nAt present, Crowd displays very basic user attributes for LDAP directories.

As the issue hasn't collect votes, watchers, comments, or support cases from many customers during its lifetime, it's very low on our priority list, and will not be fixed in the foreseeable future. That's why we've decided to resolve it as *Timed Out*.\r\n\r\nAlthough we're aware the issue is still important to those of you who were involved in the conversations around it, we want to be clear in managing your expectations. The Crowd team is focusing on issues that have broad impact and high value, reflected by the number of comments, votes, support cases, and customers interested. Please consult the [Atlassian Bugfix Policy|https://confluence.atlassian.com/support/atlassian-server-bug-fix-policy-201294573.html] for more details.\r\n\r\nWe understand how disappointing this decision may be, but we hope you'll appreciate our transparent approach and communication.\r\n\r\nAtlassian will continue to watch this issue for further updates, so please feel free to share your thoughts in the comments.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nCrowd Team\r\n{panel}\r\nCurrently, the crowd.home property specified in crowd-init.properties can't support system property substitution. I would like the ability to say:\r\ncrowd.home=${log.directory}/crowd-home\r\n\r\nas the WAR file may be deployed in multiple environments, each with a distinct base directory in which the crowd home directory would need to be environment-specific.",

However, subsequently, if you add an user to the group, it will create another uniqueMember instead of writing to the first blank one. So the end result is for a group with only one valid user, there will be two counts of uniqueMember in it.\r\n\r\nThis is causing problem on scripts that's expecting a value on the first uniqueMember, and affecting the total count as well. All in all, Crowd doesn't seem to have enough checks to ensure the integrity of the LDAP database, e.g. CWD-1184.\r\n\r\nThanks,",
