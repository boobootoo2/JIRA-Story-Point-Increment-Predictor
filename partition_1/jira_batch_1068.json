      "description": "h3. Problem Definition\r\n\r\nDerived from previous JRACLOUD-34423 - There are times when a Jira admin might need to create a large number of issues and choose to use the REST API as a means to do this. However you don't always want to send out notifications to all the users in the notification scheme when this takes place. It would be very helpful if the issue create endpoint api/2/issue had a means to do this, much like the edit issue endpoint (api/2/issue/\\{issueIdOrKey} endpoint) has the notifyUsers query parameter.\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nImplement the notifyUsers query parameter on the issue create endpoint as well.\r\nh3. Why this is important\r\n\r\nEnd users are easily annoyed by bulk issue creation. Many users have complained about Jira being overly chatty when it comes to email. This suggested solution would provide Jira admins a quick means to create issues without flooding the inbox of everyone on your team. This implementation method would still log issue histories and trigger other events/listeners just like notifyUsers currently works on api/2/issue/\\{issueIdOrKey} endpoint.\u00a0\u00a0 The workaround can provide a solution, but it's not ideal because it is not granular enough to only limit notifications for this REST API call, it's overkill to completely change the notification scheme for this single issue creation event, and likely to leave the admin to forget to change it back.\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nIt is possible for Jira admin to temporarily modify the notification scheme in use for that project so that no users are sent out notifications for such events as Issue Created, issue assigned, etc. However this work-around is not ideal as it prevents all such notifications for any project using that scheme.",

Your feedback is key to helping us understand how you use JIRA so we can continue improving your experience. We have reviewed this issue over the last few days; however there are no immediate plans to put this suggestion on our near term roadmap.\n\nPlease remember that jira.atlassian.com is one of many inputs for the JIRA roadmap. You can [learn more about our process here|https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/110373/how-does-the-jira-team-use-jira-atlassian-com].\n\nI understand that our decision may be disappointing. Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.\n\nRegards,\nDaniel Franz\ndfranz at atlassian dot com\nPrincipal Product Manager, JIRA Platform\n{panel}\n  \n\nCurrent Custom Fields do not allow CF to be individually configured.
