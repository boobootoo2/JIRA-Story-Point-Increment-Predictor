There are only 3 valid returns here; To Do, In Progress, Done.\r\n\r\n!Status Categories.png|width=217,height=146!\r\n\r\nAs 'New' is not a valid Status Category the coded JQL should not return this value.\u00a0 It should be 'To Do'.\u00a0\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Access any Project main page\r\n # Click on 'My Open Issues' or 'Open Issues' quick filter\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nWe would assume the coded JQL would have 'To Do' instead of 'New'.\u00a0 'New' is not a valid search variable that therefore will not return valid results.\u00a0\r\n\r\nWhen leveraging the API, the *status.statusCategory.name* field presents the following values:\r\n{code:java}\r\n    public static String UNDEFINED = \"undefined\";\r\n    public static String TO_DO = \"To Do\";\r\n    public static String IN_PROGRESS = \"indeterminate\";\r\n    public static String COMPLETE = \"Complete\";{code}\r\nWe can further verify this by attempting to alter the filter.

Actual Results\r\n\r\nInstead of returning the correct value in the filter, we get the erroneous statusCategory value of 'New'.\r\n\r\nThis is similar to the findings in\u00a0JRACLOUD-68855.\r\n\r\nThe\u00a0*status.statusCategory.name*\u00a0will show incorrect values. From a preliminary analysis, it seems that this is occurring because the interface StatusCategory.java is referencing the following values:\r\n{code:java}\r\n    public static String UNDEFINED = \"undefined\";\r\n    public static String TO_DO = \"new\";\r\n    public static String IN_PROGRESS = \"indeterminate\";\r\n    public static String COMPLETE = \"done\";{code}\r\nAdditionally, it appears this may present as the value is a [coded Constant|https://docs.atlassian.com/DAC/javadoc/jira/reference/com/atlassian/jira/issue/status/category/StatusCategory.html].\r\n\r\n*_public static final String TO_DO_*\r\n*_Constant Value: \"new\"_*\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nCurrently, as a workaround you can manually alter the JQL after clicking the quick filter link in order to set the correct statusCategory.\u00a0\r\n\r\n!Open Issues.png|width=1023,height=179!",

Issue Summary\r\n\r\nMake smart commit errors available on a page within the Jira cloud or send smart commit errors in a batch rather than sending individual emails for each error processing smart commits.\r\n\r\nThis could be annoying for users because Multiple Jira cloud instances can be registered to a Bitbucket cloud workspace. When a Jira key is issued to a commit, it can match with any one of the Jira instances. But Jira sends individual emails \"error processing smart commits\" from all the Jira instances where the issued Jira key in the commit doesn't match with them.\u00a0\r\n\r\nExample: If a customer registers 5 Jira instances to their Bitbucket workspace. every time they issue a Jira key to a commit, it will be intended only for a Jira instance. But the customer will receive 4 \"error processing smart commits\" emails due to the fact that the Jira Key did not match with 4 other Jira instances. If a customer performs more commits, let's say on an average of 10 commits a day, they will get around 40 \"error processing smart commits\" emails. Also, these emails wouldn't be requiring any action from the users.\r\nh3.

Their color set is exactly the same: a dark blue icon on the black background (I am not sure if you can influence the background color). I have to look for a longer moment to realize which is which. In contrast Google is doing it much better. I use their Gmail and Calendar pinned as well. Thanks to different colors used for different services it is immediately clear which pinned tab belongs to which product.

Issue Summary\r\n\r\nWhen using issue type in an _Issue Fields_ condition for a rule restricted to one team-managed project and one company-managed project, the options shown in drop-down menu consider only company-managed projects options, so they won't work for team-managed projects.\u00a0\r\n\r\nBesides that, if you first create the rule restricted to a team-managed project, the rule will only consider the options available for this specific team-managed project. If you change the rule's scope to multiple projects, the rule will still consider only the issue types available in the first project.\r\n\r\nThat's because in the backend issue type id is considered, not issue type name.\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Create an automation rule that uses issue fields condition with issue type as, for example, issue type equals Bug\r\n # Restrict the rule scope to multiple projects, one being a team-managed and other a company-managed project\r\n # Use a team-managed project issue as trigger\r\n # You can see that even though the issue has Bug as issue type, the condition won't match\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nThe drop-down menu should list all the possible \"Tasks\"/ \"Bugs\" issue types ids, including the ones created in team-managed projects. This could be done by adding besides the issue type name the team-managed project name.\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nBy now, id is used as reference in the backend, and when using multiple projects in one automation rule, this fails since the rule will consider only id from one specific project or from company-managed projects.\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nIf you're using a multiple projects rule, you can use a JQL condition with a query similar to the one below, which will include all possible ids for a issue type like, for example, \"Task\":\r\n{code:java}\r\nissuetype in (10001, 10345){code}\r\nTo find out the id of the target issue types, you can use [https://[site].atlassian.net/rest/api/3/issuetype], by replacing [site] by the name of your site.",

Issue Summary\r\nDragging over one field inside a Company-Managed Project screen's Issue layout ends up sending over a different one instead and some fields when you drag them over, don't move at all.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Access a Company-Managed Project screen's Issue layout\r\n# Try moving any custom fields, either to Hidden or up/down\r\n# The field that you are moving is not the one that you select to move. Instead, a different field is moved to Hidden or to the new place (up/down).\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nThe custom field index should be taken into consideration and that field should be moved.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nBased on a customer's instance:\r\n\r\n1. Let's say we want to move the \"Strategic Theme\" field to the Hidden fields, which internally has an index of 8:\r\n !image-2021-11-24-20-10-49-020.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\n2. We should expect that the field (with a source index of 8) will be moved to the hidden fields, but for some reason the content items selector includes items with the \"TAB\" type which causes the order to bungle up:\r\n !image-2021-11-24-20-11-03-349.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\n3. If we check which field became the \"8th\" item, it's a different one\r\n !image-2021-11-24-20-11-12-293.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\n4. Which results in a different field being added\r\n !image-2021-11-24-20-11-20-596.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\nHere's a gif showing this behavior:\r\n\r\n !Issue layout - Jira.gif! \r\n\r\nh3.
