While adding additional Jira-specific events to the Jira audit log is not on our roadmap, we will keep this ticket open to announce if new events are added in the future.\r\n\r\nFor our cloud products broadly, we are working to add a richer set of audit logs to [for Atlassian cloud administration and Atlassian Access features|https://support.atlassian.com/organization-administration/docs/track-organization-activities-from-the-audit-log/] in order to provide better visibility into administration activities across all of our cloud products. We are focused on addressing ACCESS-577, and then expanding into additional insights into Atlassian account changes, app installations, site and billing changes across all the products in use at your organization.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n Dave Meyer\r\n Atlassian Product Management\r\n{panel}\r\n*Original request description*\r\n\r\nWe have many Jira Administrators - at least one per project.\r\n In a way, this is due to a missing level of administration (JRA-3156) - but regardless of that fact, its necessary to know which administrator did what & when - we need to have an audit trail of Administrator actions. In some cases, we need to have notifications - or have additional information in existing notifications detail who the administrator was that performed this action.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the problems we have experienced are:\r\n # A user is created, but we dont know by who. Sometimes, we see a user that isnt meant to exist e.g. \"testUser\" - but we dont know who to contact to get rid of it.\r\n Sometimes the user themselves have a problem logging on, getting access to their project etc - and it would be useful for them to contact the administrator that created their account rather - therefore it would be useful to have this info in an audit trail, so we can find out who it is - or better still, have this information in the email sent out (JRA-2555)\r\n # A default notification scheme is changed - affecting all projects - and we dont know who did it (we want to know who did it so we can ask them not to do that again) (/) (done)\r\n # A global custom field is added (usually by mistake) - affecting all projects - and we dont know who did it (We want to know who did it so we can remove it - and ask them not to do that again) (/) (done)\r\n # A new issue type is added - affecting all projects - and we dont know who did it (we want to know who did it so we can discuss using an existing issue type - or discuss the addition of a new type so that it makes sense to more projects)\r\n # A user we dont know about is given jira-administrator priveledges. Given the fact that this new user may not know very much about how to administer Jira - and they can go on to do the things mentioned above, then we need to know about this. We need to contact the administrator who did it and ask them not to do it again. We need to contact the new jira-administrator and make sure they know what they are doing! (/) (done)\r\n # Someone turns unnassigned issues \"on\" and all of a sudden Project Leads stop getting notifications for new issues on their project. We need to know who did it, so we can break their legs .\r\n # Currently, in the audit logs of JIRA, it does not cover changes done in the screen scheme section, or screens in JIRA Administration. We are then unable to find out who performed changes there.\r\n # Currently, the Audit Logs of Jira doesn't cover \"Time Tracking\" Global Settings changes. Such as Site-Admin changes the format from Hours to Days. This is not recorded in the Audit logs and all of a sudden the Jira Issue's Time Tracking fields change the way they show Original Estimates, Time Tracking, etc.\r\n # There is no Audit log for the changes to Default \"Priority\" on the Global Priority Settings. An Admin can change the Default Priority from Medium to Low and the next created Issues take that priority by default.\r\n# Audit log doesn't capture \"Issue Collectors\" that are deleted from JIRA Projects\r\n\r\nThese have been the main ones that have bitten us.",

I\u2019m Nathan an Atlassian Product Manager working on our next-gen project settings experiences.\r\n\r\nSimplifying how you set up projects is one of our top priorities right now. We're investing hugely to make Jira's project configuration so intuitive that anybody can do it, fast. This ambition and your feedback guided our decision to allow anyone to create and administer a next-gen project.\r\n\r\nIf you want to share some of your administration load, you can give groups the *Create next-gen projects* global permission, and they can administer their own next-gen projects. This might be exactly what you're looking for. [You can read more about next-gen projects here.|https://community.atlassian.com/t5/Next-gen-articles/Everything-you-want-to-know-about-next-gen-projects-in-Jira/ba-p/894773]\r\n\r\nWe know that next-gen projects currently lack some of the power our users expect after using our classic projects and this can be frustrating. We want to keep our newest experiences easy and straightforward, thoughtfully designed and performance built. We're looking at classic feature usage and customer feedback as to help us prioritize what features we build next. This takes time and we appreciate your patience.\r\n\r\nPlease don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or feedback.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nNathan Sturgess\r\nProduct Manager, JIRA Platform\r\nnsturgess at atlassian.com\r\n{panel}\r\n*Original request description:*\r\n\r\nAs a JIRA Administrator I find it more difficult to manage JIRA configuration as my organisation grows. I need to be able to share some of my administrative powers with other people, but I do not want to give them all the management rights, because I am afraid they are going to break things. Each of the projects run in JIRA has its own manager and it would be best if I could give the configuration permissions related to the projects to the respective project managers.",

This couples the database contents with the application server, which violates encapsulation -- the database now has a reverse dependency on the configuration details of the application server. This has the very practical implications that moving to a new machine or deployment directory for the application server requires some [afaik undocumented] monkeying around with the paths stored in the database.\n\n(a) If the information pertains to the paths into which the application server is deployed, it should be in the XML configuration descriptors in the webapp.\n\n(b) Attachments are pretty important information anyway, so they should really be in the database. See issue JRA-806.\n\n(c) It would be lovely if the indexes were also stored in the database. (This is possible using Lucene, right?)

Trying to force users to use the system properly through handbooks and other rules not enforced by the system becomes a burden to engineers (engineers unhappy).\n\nIntegrating a couple of restrictions and rules in the system, nothing very complex would make things much better.\n\nFor example, I've found a couple of already logged requests (JRA-1993, JRA-1744, JRA-868...) that seem quite reasonable to me, and would make things easier for users\n\n- Force people to log work when resolving issues - at least present them with the dialog\n- When resolving an issue, reset the \"time left\" field to 0\n\nI also logged :\n\n- JRA-3009 : Track time on tasks&subtasks\n- JRA-3010 : Restriction on who/when work can be logged\n\nSolving all these issues would make time tracking features in JIRA much more attractive, since they would be less of a burden for the developer (less room for mistakes), and much more reliable for managers.\n\nMy $.02",

      "description": "{panel:title=Atlassian Update: 30 April 2021|titleBGColor=#3c78b5|bgColor=#e7f4fa}\r\nHi everyone,\r\n\r\nThank you for taking the time to leave feedback on this ticket. As you know, the new issue view enables Project admins to configure each custom field to either hide when empty or always be displayed. This is available in the new issue view for all Jira Cloud products (Jira Software, Jira Service Desk, Jira Core). \r\n[Learn more about configuring issue layouts|https://support.atlassian.com/jira-software-cloud/docs/configure-field-layout-in-the-issue-view/]\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n Jira Cloud team\r\n{panel}\r\n{panel:title=Atlassian Update: 28th February 2019|titleBGColor=#3c78b5|bgColor=#e7f4fa}\r\nHi everyone,\r\n\r\nFirst off, thank you for continuing to provide feedback and sharing that you would like this feature to be implemented. Although it may take time to act on certain issues raised and we may decide to not implement something in favour of other features , we are constantly using JRACLOUD issues to look for the best opportunities to improve Jira!\r\n\r\nWith that being said, I have an exciting product update re: this feature.\r\n\r\nAs part of the new Jira issue view rollout (see [blog post|https://www.atlassian.com/blog/jira-software/a-sneak-peek-into-the-future-of-jira-cloud-issues] and [documentation page|https://confluence.atlassian.com/jiracorecloud/the-new-jira-issue-view-938040503.html] to follow along.) we have updated how you can configure the layout of fields.\r\n\r\n*This includes the ability to always display a custom field, whether it has a value or not. Or, always hide that custom field* This new configuration logic can be applied on a specific issue type within a specific project, across both the new [next-gen projects|https://www.atlassian.com/blog/jira-software/the-new-jira-begins-now] and Classic projects (e.g. the existing Scrum and Kanban projects).\r\n\r\nThe new issue view can be enabled/disabled on a per-user basis by simply going to your avatar in the bottom right of the navigation and selecting 'Personal Settings'. From there, scroll down and see the Labs toggle to turn the new issue view on/off. Please note, this is only available for Jira Software and Jira Core projects, with Jira Service Desk coming in the future.\r\n\r\nOk, let's dive into how this works!\r\n\r\n*Classic Projects*\r\n The new issue view has a different overall design and information architecture, so the existing global screen configs, schemes, and field configurations were hard to map 1:1 because of a lot of existing custom logic. SO, we decided to take the fields you specified from the global screen configs and applied to an issue type within a project then let you arrange the ordering of those fields within each project!\r\n\r\nSee the [Configure field layout in the issue view|https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirasoftwarecloud/configure-field-layout-in-the-issue-view-961798059.html] documentation page for how this is done. Note: You must be a Project or Site admin to 'configure' the fields on the new issue view AND the new issue view must be enabled for you.\r\n\r\n*Next-gen Projects*\r\n By default the [new next-gen projects|https://www.atlassian.com/blog/jira-software/the-new-jira-begins-now] come with all the latest, awesome stuff we have built all wrapped within a project type. This includes the new configuration options and the new issue view. You cannot disable these things within next-gen projects, as they are tied together.\r\n\r\nSee the [Working with next-gen software projects|https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirasoftwarecloud/working-with-next-gen-software-projects-945104895.html] documentation page for more detailed information.\r\n\r\nIn these projects, the functionality is quite similar in that you have the ability to always display a custom field, whether it has a value or not. Or remove it from being seeing entirely.\r\n\r\n*Config layout logic recap - TL;DR*\r\n # You must have the new issue view enabled from your 'Personal Settings' to specify hiding/showing custom fields. If you are using a next-gen project, you don't need to worry about that as it comes with the new issue view by default.\r\n # From the new configuration screen, you can specify how you display fields. There are 3 'buckets' to put fields into, depending on your needs for a *specific project > issue type*.\r\n ## Always show --> this displays the field whether or not it has a value. aka 'Primary Fields'\r\n ## Show when it has a value --> If the field has a value, it will display above the 'show more' on the issue detail view, because it has important information people should see. Otherwise, keep the field under 'show more' so people can see get to the field and add a value if they want. aka 'Secondary Fields'\r\n ## Hidden fields --> This hides the field completely from the issue detail view. For next-gen projects, you just simply remove the field.\r\n\r\nSorry for the long update, but wanted to give as much context and detail as I could. As I'm sure you are all aware, Jira's configuration capabilities can be quite complex. *We hope you enjoy this feature, let us know how we did and/or how can we improve it!*\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n Taylor Pechacek - Jira Cloud PM\r\n{panel}\r\nAs stated in JRA-1678, custom fields are automatically hidden when they are empty.\r\n\r\n(** see my comment in JRA-1678 **)\r\n\r\nThe best solution is to provide the ability to choose whether or not to hide a field (standard or custom) when it's empty.\r\n\r\nSo it would be nice to have a flag for each field indicating if this field has to be hidden in issue views.",

It has the ability to subscribe to a published calendar (via HTTP).  This published calendar appears as a separate calendar entity within iCal and is a read-only view of the data.  iCal seems to support both events (including alarms) and tasks (todos; along with due dates) from a subscribed calendar.\n\nI envision JIRA providing a calendar feed that I could subscribe to that would show tasks that I need to attend to (bugs, issues, tasks, etc.) as well as upcoming due dates, like releases.  I think this feed could be fed from the same information that drives the current dashboard view.

The brief version is more usable in this respect, but then the project summary graph is not reachable any more for all projects at one.\n\nIt would be an advantage to allow switching between the brief and full\nforms via some tab-like controls (like the Filter:View|Edit|New|Manage   selection of the issue navigator) - maybe placed on the bottom of the portlet. The state could be held in a cookie.\n\nAlternately, the \"Browse Project\" view could allow this brief/full switching.\n\nA more \"compact\" display form of the full would also be possible. I experimeted with some variations and can send the result as an attachment if desirable.\n\nThanx,\nChristoph",

Other bug systems i have used in the past have allowed this, and worked in simlar way tho this: \nIf the user has administrative rights, a link/button to create ie a new component is displayed next to the component list box. Click this, and a popup is displayed with an 'add new component' field. Then upon saving, popup closes, and can select the new component in your new issue without having to lose all the previously entered information.\n\nCurrently, while i'm adding issues, if the component doesnt exist, either have to save the issue, add the new component, then go back in and edit the issue, or cancel adding the issue to go and add the component.\n\n[apologies if this is duplicate - couldnt find a similar issue when doing a search]",

Your feedback is key to helping us understand how you use JIRA so we can continue improving your experience. We have reviewed this issue over the last few days.\n\nWe're investigating the feasibility of supporting this feature as part of a larger theme of work to improve setting up and maintaining projects. Unfortunately we can't definitively commit to if or when this feature will be released.\n\nIt's important to understand that we rarely try to implement individual features from jira.atlassian.com, but instead take a holistic look at the problem and use feedback from the comments here and a [dozen other sources|https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/110373/how-does-the-jira-team-use-jira-atlassian-com] of customer input to solve the core problems.\n\nPlease don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or feedback.\n \nRegards,\nDave Meyer\ndmeyer@atlassian.com\nProduct Manager, JIRA Platform\n{panel}\n\nIt would be useful to be able to specify the Time Tracking options per project.\n\nWe have projects with 7.5 hours per day and other projects with 8.0 hours per day depending on the customer.\nThis also includes the ability to turn on/off Time Tracking per project.",

For example:\nIf the workflow defines a custom action \"Promote Issue to Test\" then there should be an associated permission called \"Promote Issues to Test\" so that only users with the appropriate permission can execute the action.  Currewently the interim workaround is to allow only the current assignee to exceute any custom actions.",

After consideration, we are closing this issue because we do not expect to address it in the foreseeable future. As is clear from the examples below, the ideal propagated action depends on the type of issue link and varies depending on your use case. Considering issue links can be arbitrarily defined, this would require adding logic in JIRA to handle certain types of links differently from others. Alternatively, we would need to add settings to configure propagated actions based on the issue links.\n\nOur belief is that the value doees not justify the expected increase in UI complexity or maintenance burden.\n\nAs always, please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.\n\nThanks\nDave Meyer\nProduct Manager, JIRA Platform\n{panel}\n\n\nWhen an issue is linked as solved by or set as duplicate do a cascading update when resolving the issue that solves the duplicate.",

From JIRA 6.1 we are only going to support customised project keys that meet all of the conditions specified below:\n# The first character is a letter from the [Modern Roman Alphabet|http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_alphabet#Modern_alphabet]\n# The first and all consecutive letter characters are in upper case\n# Only letters, numbers or the underscore character is used\n\nWe understand that some customers may be in the position where their current project keys do not meet the above requirements. We want to help these customers migrate to a supported format. To do this, we will implement this highly-voted feature request to allow the editing of project keys. We have started work on this and we aim to complete it for the JIRA 6.1 release. Given that it is very early in the release cycle we can not guarantee this and we will keep everyone updated via this issue.\n\nFor customers that cannot wait until the 6.1 release, the current recommended workaround is to create a new project and use Bulk Move to transfer issues over from the old project to the new project. This has the additional benefit of providing redirection from the old issue key to the new issue key if anyone has an external reference to it. We realize that there is still manual work involved with moving components and versions and other project configuration.\n\nThanks for your patience and we hope you appreciate our open approach to feature requests.\n\nCheers,\nBartek\nJIRA Product Management\nbartek (at) atlassian (dot) com\n{panel}\n*Original request description:*\n\nI had cause to rename a whole series of projects recently, however I could see no way to modify the key for a project, so the issue-numbers now make little sense compared to the name.\n\nWould be nice to change the key to a non-used key and see them all updated.",

We highly value your feedback in all forms, and through suggestions in jira.atlassian.com is not different. We use this channel often to learn the best we can with how customers use JIRA and how we can continue to improve the experience for as many users as possible.\n\nWe have revisited this issue again recently and wanted to reiterate that there are still currently no plans to implement this suggestion, and it is not currently on any JIRA team\u2019s roadmap at this stage.\n\nIn the meantime, you might be interested in checking out the following solutions available on our Marketplace:\n* [\"Version Sync for JIRA\"|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/net.collabsoft.plugins.jira.jira-version-sync] available for Server deployments has essentially implemented this feature. Please also check its sibling [\"Component Sync for JIRA\"|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/net.collabsoft.plugins.jira.jira-component-sync].\n* [\"Releasedog\"|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.abdhiware.releasedog] available for Server deployment, which addresses a similar use case.\n\nPlease remember that jira.atlassian.com is one of many inputs for the JIRA roadmap. You can [learn more about our process here|https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/110373/how-does-the-jira-team-use-jira-atlassian-com].\n\nI understand that our decision may be disappointing.

Basically it's to have a shopping basket for issues to allow a list of issues [much like that shown in find-issues] to be created.\n\nIt would be stored under the find-issues tab later on, so really it's two pieces of code:\n\n1) Add to shopping basket\n2) Filter to show what's in shopping basket",

This is not currently the case.\n\nSay I've created a Notification/Permission/IssueField scheme, and now want to associate a project with it.  There is a 'projects' column sitting there waiting to be filled in, but there's no \"Add\" button that would let me quickly add the project.  I have to go \"Projects\" in the left-hand menu, find the project(s), and associate the scheme with them.  This is annoying, considering that schemes are typically created *after* projects.\n\n\n\n",

People here want to be able to do similar but at a higher level - be the execption to the scheme's rule.\n\nFor example:\n\nI set groupA to be notified whenever an issue is created in projectA. This is fine, however [without admin intervention (adding them to groupA or singularly), but with \"overriding approval\" (eg: 'tick here to allow users to override notifications on this project')] I would like to be able to have a user decide him/herself if they get the notifications for issue creation.\n\nThe same applies to all the various issue notification options (eg: issue closing, assigning, work logging etc).\n\nThis idea is extensible and leads to create a scalable (overridable) notification scheme which is managed by the end users (if the option is enabled) rather than needing and administration team to get involved in notifications when they should be focused on security and auditing.",

We hope to address JIRA's notification system with more customizable notifications, but we do not currently have a timeframe of when this effort will begin. Please continue to pass along your suggestions for notifications.\n\nAs always, please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.\n\nThanks\nDave Meyer\nProduct Manager, JIRA Platform\n{panel}\n\nCurrently, the notification schemes are pretty good - and cover what most people want.\n\nHowever, what would be very useful is to be able to define some rules for more complex notification schemes.\n\nFor example, you may want to notify a particular group on a particular event based on some data in the issue - predicatable data like version, component, value of some custom field.\n\nSomething like:\n\nCustomField.Location=\"London\"\nComponent=\"Workflow\"\n\n-Nick",

Inevitably also, managers cannot resist tinkering with their organisations, with teams often moving around within the company.\n\nTherefore, at some point we will want to move projects from one installation to another.  Whilst it's easy to split a large JIRA into smaller JIRAs, merging two is not so easy.\n\nSo, wouldn't it be great to be able to point one JIRA instance at another and move projects / permission schemes / users etc between them using SOAP or similar?  Our need for this is not immediate, but the time will come very soon when this could become a bit of a problem.",

In order to have this feature implemented we plan to first focus on REST API (backend) for the solution, and only after the backend is exposed to Atlassian Connect developers the GUI might follow.\r\n\r\nHaving said the above we currently do not have the detailed plans for the GUI to be implemented in the next 12 months.\r\n\r\nThanks for your patience and we hope you appreciate our open approach to feature requests.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nBartek\r\n JIRA Product Management\r\n bartek (at) atlassian (dot) com\r\n{panel}\r\n*Original request description (original description was blank, so let's use one of the duplicates' description for clarity):*\r\n\r\nIt would be handy to have the possibility to bulk change the type of one, more or all issue links when viewing the \"link administration\" of a certain issue. E.g. when one wants to change all \"subissues\" to \"related issues\".

We do plan to continue investing in improving support for external directory configurations in JIRA, however we want to focus on improving our support for the current set of configurations.\n\nRegards,\nDave Meyer\ndmeyer@atlassian.com\nProduct Manager, JIRA Platform\n{panel}\n\n*Original request description:*\n\nSupport NTLM authentication instead of password login when appropriate. This is attractive, even more as Mozilla 1.4 supports it.\n\n*Workaround:*\n\nCustomers have reported in past comments like [this one|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRA-2398?focusedCommentId=522893&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-522893] or [this one|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/UPM/Problems+Connecting+to+the+Atlassian+Marketplace] that they were successful once they installed [Cntlm Authentication Proxy|http://cntlm.sourceforge.net/] locally to their JIRA server, [configured and tested it|http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9181637/how-to-fill-proxy-information-in-cntlm-config-file] to make sure \"Cntlm\" works with their corporate NTLM and then used the parameters documented in [How to Configure an Outbound HTTP and HTTPS Proxy for JIRA|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRAKB/How+to+Configure+an+Outbound+HTTP+and+HTTPS+Proxy+for+JIRA] to point to the \"Cntlm\" proxy instead - and that one will do the job to talk to NTLM.\n\nMore detailed steps can be found on [How to Configure an Outbound HTTP and HTTPS Proxy for JIRA|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRAKB/How+to+Configure+an+Outbound+HTTP+and+HTTPS+Proxy+for+JIRA].",
