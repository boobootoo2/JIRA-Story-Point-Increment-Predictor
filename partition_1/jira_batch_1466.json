      "description": "The [content share function|https://docs.atlassian.com/fisheye-crucible/latest/wadl/fecru.html#rest-service-fecru:share-content-v1:share] present in FeCru Rest API allows users to share changesets, repositories, files and reviews via email with other users.\r\n\r\nThe documentation currently covers the changeset share scenario, providing a sample representation for it. The suggestion is to improve this documentation, providing sample representations for the other cases. For instance, the representation to share a review would be like (JSON example):\r\n{noformat}\r\n{\r\n  \"url\" : \"http://localhost:8060/cru/CR-15\",\r\n  \"note\" : \"The message from the user\",\r\n  \"entity1\" : \"10\",\r\n  \"entity2\" : \"\",\r\n  \"type\" : \"review\",\r\n  \"users\" : [ \"user1, user2\" ],\r\n  \"emails\" : [ \"email1@company.com\", \"email1@company.com\" ]\r\n}\r\n{noformat}\r\nNotice that, for the review case, in entity1 you must pass the actual numeric ID for the review (which is the ID for this review in the database), not the perm ID (which is the one you see in the UI). To check for the actual ID of a review based on the perm ID (project key + number) in the database, execute the following query:\r\n{code:sql}\r\nselect cru_review_id from cru_revpermaid where cru_proj_key='<proj_key>' and cru_number=<number>\r\n{code}\r\nIn the query above replace *<proj_key>* by the project key and *<number>* by the review number",

This works as expected.\r\n\r\nBut if the project has restriction of users/groups allowed, it behaves wrongly.\r\n 1. if users with given prefix are found as allowed reviewers (either allowed users or members of allowed groups), only those users are listed in the Reviewers input.  This seems fine\r\n 2. but if such users are found, the Reviewers input shows all group and users with the given prefix, regardless whether they are allowed as reviewers or not on this project.

For source code control we are using PlasticSCM since it's the best state of the art tool for that. We have experiences with git, subversion, cvs and mercuical but all of them are not a patch on PlasticSCM. Unfortunately non of the Atlassian products supports PlasticSCM directly.\r\n\r\nCurrently we are using the PlasticSCM plugins provides by Codice. But most of the time there are not as nice integrated as the repositories which are directly supported by Atlassian. \r\n\r\nWe think it is necessary for Atlassian to support PlasticSCM natively, since it's the best SCM system on the market, at least in our opinion. The native support would add value to all Atlassian products.\r\n\r\nEspecially Fisheye would benefit of a PlasticSCM support, since there isn't a plugin available yet. If you would integrate PlasticSCM support to Fisheye, we would immediatly buy a License for our Company. And I am sure others will do the same!",

Summary\r\nIn FishEye/Crucible, if a user is managed externally (i.e. JIRA/Crowd/LDAP), and local editing of email address and display name is disabled, it is not possible to enable or disable Crucible access for that user.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Integrate Crucible with JIRA for user management.\r\n#* For *When synchronisation happens* set *Copy new users and changes to existing users (local editing of email address and display name is disabled).*\r\n# Synchronize the users.\r\n# Within Crucible edit a user, uncheck the box *Crucible user* and click in *Apply*. It will fail because the user is managed externally so no changes can be applied. See screenshot below\r\n!crucible_user_error.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nCrucible access for the user should be editable, as this is not managed externally.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nCrucible access cannot be edited if the user is managed externally, and local editing of email address and display name is disabled.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround 1 - Bulk Edit\r\n# Under {{Administration >> User Settings >> Users}} select the checkbox for the users that you would like to enable/disable Crucible for\r\n# At the bottom of the page, select \"Enable Crucible\" or \"Disable Crucible\" in the Bulk actions dropdown menu and select \"GO\"\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround 2\r\n# Go to {{Crucible Administration > Authentication > JIRA/Crowd Authentication}}, edit its setting and set *When synchronisation happens* to *Copy only new users (local editing of email address and display name is enabled)* temporarily. Proceed with the groups configuration and Save.\r\n# Within Crucible edit the user, checking/unchecking the *Crucible user* box. It will work now as for now it is possible to edit users locally.\r\n# Go back to {{Crucible Administration > Authentication > JIRA/Crowd Authentication}} and edit the settings to set *When synchronisation happens* back to the previous setting.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround 3 - REST API\r\nAn example of how you could enable a user for Crucible access is as follows:\r\n{noformat}\r\ncurl -u <ADMIN USER> -v -X PUT -d \"{\\\"crucible\\\":true}\" -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" <URL>:<PORT>/rest-service-fecru/admin/users/<USERNAME>\r\n{noformat} ",

For this reason we are currently using customised mullite script but... :-)\r\n\r\nAnother useful feature would be to make it possible to disable auto-adding the \"Created by autoreview plugin\" message being added to the reviews.\r\n\r\nHope that makes sense, thanks.\r\n",
