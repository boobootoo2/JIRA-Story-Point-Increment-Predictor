I then import the data from the running JIRA and test it out before making the switch. The problem is that an import seems to include the index directory, which then sets the second JIRA instance to index in the old directory, which corrupts the index of the running JIRA. There should be an option on import to exclude the settings for the index/attachements/backups directories.",

We highly value your feedback in all forms, and through suggestions in jira.atlassian.com is not different. We use this channel often to learn the best we can with how customers use JIRA and how we can continue to improve the experience for as many users as possible.\n\nWe have revisited this issue again recently and wanted to reiterate that there are still currently no plans to implement this suggestion, and it is not currently on any JIRA team\u2019s roadmap at this stage.\n\nPlease remember that jira.atlassian.com is one of many inputs for the JIRA roadmap. You can [learn more about our process here|https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/110373/how-does-the-jira-team-use-jira-atlassian-com].\n\nI understand that our decision may be disappointing. Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.\n\n\nRegards,\nKerrod Williams\nKerrod (dot) Williams (at) atlassian (dot) com\nProduct Manager, JIRA\n\n{panel}\n\n\\\\\n\nIt would be nice if a component could be shared between projects. This way it would be possible to search for issues across projects and specify a component and produce stats cross project that are easier to read.",

We are currently discussing the possibilities and analysing the use cases outlined by our customers. Please be vocal in the comments section below - this will help us enormously. And stay tuned for the changes related to navigation.\n\nUnfortunately at this point in time we are not able to share any planned delivery dates.\n\nThanks for your patience and we hope you appreciate our open approach to feature requests.\n\nCheers,\nBartek\nJIRA Product Management\nbartek (at) atlassian (dot) com\n{panel}\n*Original request description:*\n\nAbility to customize \"Browse Project\" page same as Home page... especially for adding \"Assigned to Me\", \"In Progress\", \"Project Statistics\" and user-definable filters.\n\\\\\n\nSome ideas from the linked duplicate issues:\n\n*JRA-9269*\nThe dashboard can quickly get cluttered up when there are several projects going on, everyone want their graphs and charts, tables etc. on the dashboard. While some of the \"multiple-dashboards\" proposals address this more or less (e.g. by allowing saving/loading/sharing of dashboards), I think a project-specific dashboard, controlled by the project lead and viewable by anyone whose permissions allow them to view the project, would be helpful. It would show up as a tab in the 'browse project' set. There may be filters that the particular group likes to use, just for their project, graphs they want to see, handy portlets for the project processes, etc. without losing the view of the 'main' dashboard(s).\n\nExample: The 'preset filters' on the current page are somewhat limited, and there is no way to tweak them and have the tweaked version show up in the project page. So they end up in the big global filter bucket on the main dashboard, where other project members who don't need them are forced to deal with them.\n\nExample: A project lead wants the team to see a burndown chart, time-tracking, or one of the new jfreechart created/resolved charts on the project page.\nThe ability to customize/add portlets to the existing 'open issues' tab would be useful as well.\n\n*JRA-11604*\nSince JIRA 3.7 it is possible to add preset filters on the Browse Project page by creating a Web Fragment plugin.\nIt would be great if this was also possible just by using JIRA's UI\n\n*JRA-13191*\n*Problem*\nWe need an ease way to change \"Preset Filters\" on the Browse Project page.\nWe also need to be able to change what columns to show, the order of the columns and the sorting of the issues.\n\n*Current \"solution\"*\nWe know it is possible to change \"Preset Filters\" with Web Fragment plugins. *But* it is a lot of work - it requires a java programmer - and it is not possible to select/reorder columns.\n\n*Suggested solution*\nUnder \"Share Current Filter\" it should be possible to select \"Show in Preset Filters for Browse Project\". \nCurrent \"Preset Filters\" should also be shown here, so it is possible to customise them.\n\n*Other suggestions*\nWhen searching/filtering, it should be possible to search for \"current project\" (if a project is currently chosen) - just as you can search for \"current user\" - it would make reuse of filters much simpler.\n\n*Additional benefits*\nWith this solution it would be possible to use \"Preset filers\" in \"Single Level Group By Report\" as requested in JRA-12440 and JRA-8811.\n\n*Other related issues*\nJRA-8375 Allow Global saved filters to be used as a preset filter on the Browse Project page\nJRA-1639 Merge saved/global filters with \"preset filters\"\nJRA-11604 Allow to create/modify/remove preset filters on the Browse Project page through the web\nJRA-10942 Allow 'Preset Filters' in 'browse project' and 'project portlets' to have pluggable\n\n*JRA-22237*\nWhen browsing a project, users are currently presented with a default set of filters on each of the project tabs. For example, on the Summary tab, there are Issues Due, Issues 30 Day Summary, Activity Stream, Issues Updated Recently, etc.; and on the Issues tab, there are Unresolved by Priority, Unresolved by Assignee, Status Summary, etc. These filters are the defaults, as programmed by Atlassian, and can't easily be changed.\n\nI think it would be a very useful improvement to allow either the JIRA administrator or the individual project administrator to choose which filters to display and which filters to hide on each of the project panel tabs. They should be able to choose from a list of standard filters, but should also be able to easily create new filters to include (for example) custom fields. It should not require a programmer to do this.\n\nExample A: the JIRA admin might configure the system so that on ALL projects, the Summary tab will display Issues Closed Recently instead of Issues Updated Recently.\nExample B: on one particular project, the project admin might configure it so that the Issues tab will show Unresolved Issues by Type instead of Unresolved by Component, and Unresolved Issues by Severity (a custom field).",

I was thinking last night about this (hey shouldn't it be just\nthe Jira developers who dream about it?!) and was reminded of a simple\nsolution I've thought of before:\n\nAdd a notification event for \"Linked Issue Resolved\", and a new\nnotification target grouping \"Assignees of all linked issues\"\n\nThis event would be triggered when any issue that is inwardly linked\n(linked TO by other issues) is resolved, and notifications, if setup\nusign the new notification grouping, would be sent to all Assignees of\nthe inwardly linking issues. Hey presto you find out when issues you\ndepend on are fixed.\n\nThis is loosely related to some of the ideas in:\n\nhttp://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRA-2678\n{quote}",

You can create create webhooks for:\r\n * {{issuelink_created}}\r\n * {{issuelink_deleted}}\r\n\r\nas you would any other webhook. Please check out [the JIRA Cloud developer documentation|https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/webhooks]\u00a0for more information on using webhooks. This feature will be rolling out to all JIRA Cloud sites over the next 24 hours.\r\n\r\nSince JIRA Cloud does not support internal \"events\" and webhooks are the supported alternative, we are marking this feature request as resolved. We will work to provide an update on the status and priority of this feature for JIRA Server and post it on JRASERVER-8505 as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nDave Meyer\r\nSenior Product Manager, JIRA\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\nh3. Problem Definition\r\nCreating or removing a JIRA issue link doesn't trigger any events. This means that the operation can't be used to trigger notifications or Webhook posts.\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\nA new event type that occurs when an issue is linked to another issue would be useful - for example to notify the assignee of the other issue that there is a link or to update an external service with a Webhook. \r\nIt should also be possible to configure an email notification when this event is triggered (JRA-14618).

How will it work?\n\nFunctionally, if you're *focussed* on a Wiki enabled text area, pressing Alt+P will flip the area to a preview. Another Alt+P will toggle it back to the text area and focus in on it. Once you leave the wiki enabled field, Alt+P should do nothing. \n\nOnce you focus in on a wiki field again, the whole cycle also begins again.\n\nThis will only work for the last previewed field, so it won't work for the seconf last field if you have two fields being simultaneously previewed.\n\nh4. The pseudocode\n\nhave a {{onfocus}} handler that adds an accesskey=P on the preview link and and {{onblur}} that removes it. That might be the easiest solution if it works. You will have to track the \"lastPreviewed\" field but other than that, it should be okay.\n\nh4. Wil this actually work?\n\nI have no idea :) Adding dynamic accesskey property works in theory but I've never tried it.  If the dynamic accesskey doesn't work, then we can add key listeners (we already do this for textareas anyway) to make this work. ",

I'm looking at a screen with 5 or 6 different fields on it and a user can fill in the fields, click add and add more if needed. Probably the best example within Jira I see of this is the View Screen Schemes page where you can add as many schemes as you want. Is it possible to add such functionality for an issue?\n\nI don't think this is possible OOB and will require custom code, but wanted to ask the JIRA community about it.\n\nThanks\n-Jeff",

Something like: if the email subject contains a Jira project key\nthen look at the content and delete anything below the first email header that contains that key.\n\nWe use Jira to track field issues and provide field support. \n1. Field staffer creates a Jira issue (either directly or via email). \n2. Support staff in head office make a comment in Jira. \n3. Field staffer receives a notification email containing the comment. \n5. Field staffer then typically replies \"with history\". \n6. Their reply with all of its history is added as one Jira comment, but that same history is already tracked (in a much nicer way) through individual Jira comments. This adds accumulated redundant information for each emailed reply \"with history\". After only a few replies such a Jira issue is very difficult to read, to the point of being counter-productive.\n\nField staff prefer email over Jira web access because they travel alot and don't always have access to the internet. But they do have access to a local replica of their email database on their laptops. This means they can work offline and respond to our questions straight after leaving a customer site (on a plane or train) while vital new information is fresh.\n\nWe have asked field staff to reply \"without history\" but this never works. They want to see what they're replying to and they always want to cc other staff in regional offices who have more access to internet and can \"watch\" issues.",

I would vote that they are made standard links which every installation has (and are undeletable).\n\nIf that was the case, you would be able to more easily build standard functionality on them. Some of this functionality might include:\n- Gantt charts, displaying dependencies between issues.\n- Dependency change notification (I'll elaborate on that).\n\nI think this is a natural progression in the direction the application is already moving in. It feels like 90% of the work for this kind of stuff is done and the application could soon start creating some of those really awesome bonus features (like Gantt charts).\n\nDependency change notification: If an issue is marked as \"depending\" on another, you could set up a default \"watch\" action. If the issue which was the prerequisite had a status change, JIRA could then send an email to the person assigned to that issue.",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-8090].\n  {panel}\n\nThe getIssuesFromFilter() function returns entire bugs with all history, comments, etc. This is fine on a LAN but over the internet doing simple things like getting a list of the summaries for all bugs assigned to Joe is very slow and bandwidth-consuming.\n\nMy suggestion is to modify the function, or provide an overload or new function that lets me customize what will get returned. Perhaps a simple array of field names to return would work. Then I could ignore fields that I don't need anyway that are large to transfer in SOAP.\n\nThe brass ring would be to add a \"cursor\" feature that lets me do a query then iterate through the issues in chunks, rather than getting them all at once in a big pile (similar to how the issue navigator lets me go a page at a time).\n\n\nOriginal email conversation follows:\n\nHi Scott,\n\n > I admit the \"count\" feature is something that is too specific to be\n > useful to a lot of people. So instead of returning counts, what about\n > accepting more arguments in getIssuesFromFilter() that let us choose\n > which fields are returned? Returning them all as it does now is very\n > painful when using Jira from remote.\n\nI can see that this will be useful.

We highly value your feedback in all forms, and through suggestions in jira.atlassian.com is not different. We use this channel often to learn the best we can with how customers use JIRA and how we can continue to improve the experience for as many users as possible.\n\nAt this time, this suggestion is not on the JIRA development roadmap. There a couple add-ons on the Atlassian Marketplace that can support this, such as [Configuration Manager for JIRA|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.botronsoft.jira.configurationmanager]. Alternatively, this is very easy to do with a simple GET of the component you want to copy and a POST of the components JSON representation to the JIRA REST API, simply change the project key and id in the rep.\n\nPlease remember that jira.atlassian.com is one of many inputs for the JIRA roadmap. You can [learn more about our process here|https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/110373/how-does-the-jira-team-use-jira-atlassian-com].\n\nI understand that our decision may be disappointing. Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.\n\n\nRegards,\nKerrod Williams\nKerrod (dot) Williams (at) atlassian (dot) com\nProduct Manager, JIRA\n\n{panel}\n\nThis issue is related to JRE-501 (Shared Components) and JRE-6999 (Add ability to export/import projects):\n\nWe need a way to copy components from one project to another. This is because the projects have _nearly_ the same components.\n\nThere are several ways how this issue might be solved from my point of view:\n\n1. There might be an ex- and import of project-components.\n2. There might be a button in the Projects-Administration to copy a project.\n3. Upon creation of a new project you are asked if to take components from an existing project (and perhaps other settings, too)\n\nNow the reason why we require this:\n\nIn contrast to perhaps the normal application-development we had to create projects for each release-version of the same application. This is because after a version is released it will go into maintenance-mode thus the version is never really finished. See for example a release history like this:\n\nJanuary V 1.0 build 1 Final-Release (Components: A, B, C)\nFebruary V 1.1 build 1 Final-Release (Components: A, C)\nMarch V 1.0 build 2 Bugfix-Release\nApril V2.0 build 1 Final-Release  (Components: A, C, D)\nMay V1.1 build 2 Bugfix-Release\n\nand so on. Therefore virtually we have a new project/product with every Final-Release. It's rather hard to mirror this pre-existing handling of versions inside JIRA as the \"normal\" version-concept included into JIRA does not fit. So the application-versions are now projects while the JIRA-version-field is related to the build-numbers.\n\nTo use our workaround we now have to copy all components from one project to another. Resolving this issue would ease to handle this workaround.",

The customer receives 10 e-mails. This is annoying.\n\nIf i could check a \"minor change, no notifications will be sent\" field when\n\n- executing a workflow action\n- edition an issue\n- creating an attachment\n- adding a comment\n\nthat would be a great feature.\n\nOf course, there should be a permission allowing this fuctionality.
