Expected Results:\nThe gadget's window would resize automatically to adjust to the size of the summaries returned.\n\nh3.

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-33642].\n  {panel}\n\nHi,\n\nDue to some unexplained cause, we have found that our JIRA Charting plugin was not recording average time in status (ATIS) data and date of first response (DOFR) because the necessary custom fields were never active on the system.  Others have mentioned this issue in answers.atlassian; I don't think that it's been officially addressed; however, we've made the necessary additions for these charts to _start_ generating data.\n\nThe problem, then, is that our existing projects have no historical data to work with in order to populate these charts.\n\nThe formats of these custom fields are simple maps of durations or transition times between states.  As such, it would _seem_ as if it should be simple to make a utility that would do the following:\n\n* Expose a function that allows an administrator to re-generate the custom field data for a project:\n** Based on the recorded activity of the issue, which exists in the database\n** The admin can by default choose not to include issues where that data exists\n* Ideally, it would be nice for this not to cause X notifications of changes.",

And due to this, this actually opens the possibility for customer to configure a long String as an option for a custom field.\n\nHowever when configuring a long String as an option for a custom field (eg: Select List custom field), the custom field value is truncated in the Issue Navigator (Basic Search). Please see the following sample screenshot for more details of this behavior:\n!scshot.png!\n\nThis behavior basically affects the usability of the Issue Navigator Basic Search, especially if we have more than one long options for a custom field.\n\nIt will be great if we can format the custom field option 'popup' so that a long custom field option is displayed properly in the Issue Navigator Basic Search.\n\nThis behavior is tested in JIRA 5.2.6 and JIRA 6.0.1.",

However the tomcat version that come bundled with it (7.0.29) is still exposed to security vulnerabilities as stated on the follow documentation from tomcat:\n\n* http://tomcat.apache.org/security-7.html#Fixed_in_Apache_Tomcat_7.0.30\n\n{quote}\n*Important: Denial of service* CVE-2012-3544\nWhen processing a request submitted using the chunked transfer encoding, Tomcat ignored but did not limit any extensions that were included. This allows a client to perform a limited DOS by streaming an unlimited amount of data to the server.\n\nThis was fixed in revisions 1378702 and 1378921.\n\nThis issue was reported to the Tomcat security team on 10 November 2011 and made public on 10 May 2013.\n\nAffects: 7.0.0-7.0.29\n\n*Moderate: DIGEST authentication weakness* CVE-2012-3439\nThree weaknesses in Tomcat's implementation of DIGEST authentication were identified and resolved:\n\n# Tomcat tracked client rather than server nonces and nonce count.\n# When a session ID was present, authentication was bypassed.\n# The user name and password were not checked before when indicating that a nonce was stale.\n\nThese issues reduced the security of DIGEST authentication making replay attacks possible in some circumstances.\n\nThis was fixed in revision 1377807.\n\nThe first issue was reported by Tilmann Kuhn to the Tomcat security team on 19 July 2012. The second and third issues were discovered by the Tomcat security team during the resulting code review. All three issues were made public on 5 November 2012.\n\nAffects: 7.0.0-7.0.29\n\n*Important: Bypass of security constraints* CVE-2012-3546\n\nWhen using FORM authentication it was possible to bypass the security constraint checks in the FORM authenticator by appending /j_security_check to the end of the URL if some other component (such as the Single-Sign-On valve) had called request.setUserPrincipal() before the call to FormAuthenticator#authenticate().\n\nThis was fixed in revision 1377892.\n\nThis issue was identified by the Tomcat security team on 13 July 2012 and made public on 4 December 2012.\n\nAffects: 7.0.0-7.0.29\n{quote}\n\nCustomer requested this information to be conveyed here and to change the future bundled version to a later version to avoid on the security vulnerabilities stated.\n\nCurrently the only way to bypass this security threat is by deploying WAR installation with later version of tomcat.

The example is selecting all status codes except for closed and on hold status codes.\n\n1)  It is very frustrating trying to select multiple when the number of items is larger than the dropdown list since the list keeps reorganizing and you lose your position where you left when trying to select multiple items..\n\n2) You need to keep scrolling back to select your next status value.\n\nI attached a mp4 video showing the issue.\n\nMy personal suggestions are\n1) Do not move the selection to the top of the list until the next time the dropdown list is opened.    The user continues selecting until either the user moves the user outside the dropdown area (for a long enough period of time or clicks outside the dropdown window.\n\n2) or open the selection area showing all the status codes so no scrolling will be necessary\n\n1) Provide an reverse selection similar to the clear selection to minimize the number of items that needs to be selected.\nThis is not an advanced item when you want to see all issues not closed.\n\n",

This edit profile dialog should allow administrators to associate multiple email addresses with a JIRA account.\n\nReasoning:\nWhat would be the purpose of this?\n\nhttps://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Creating+Issues+and+Comments+from+Email\n\nI have developers that have multiple email addresses for support reasons. If they try to raise an issue via email or add a comment to an issue via email and are signed into an email account not registered with JIRA - then JIRA doesn't know what to do with the email that it received (if you have create new users via email disabled - which we do). JIRA not knowing what to do with the unrecognizable email address is understandable. \n\nHowever we should be able to associate multiple email addresses with one JIRA user, so then JIRA will correctly be able to raise Issues or add comments to existing issues.\n\nIt is really irritating that JIRA does not support this. This means all developers need to inconveniently log out of their email and log into another email account OR mess with their email account settings and temporarily change their \"sent from\" setting to show the email address registered with JIRA. Sometimes switching \"sent from\" or email accounts means we can't do a simple cc / bcc: to our JIRA system as the email we need to send for support reasons needs to show up as sent from an email that is not registered with the JIRA user. So then it is a bunch more work to copy / paste stuff around and switch out the accounts to the correct email account registered with JIRA.\n\nThis is incredibly inconvenient and wastes a lot of time.
