So we had a lot of overdue issues. Therefore we had the idea that it would be nice if in the issue navigator, where you have the summary of your issues, issues could be marked (e.g. color coded) which are overdue (e.g. red marked) or nearly over due (e.g yellow marked).\nThank you",

I am keeping this ticket as \"Gathering Interest\" so that you votes and comments can help us gather more information.\u00a0\r\n\r\nYou can learn more about Trash for Projects at\u00a0[https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiracloud/trash-for-jira-software-and-jira-core-projects-1001820064.html]\u00a0\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nRitesh Ranjan\r\nProduct Manager, JIRA Platform\r\n{panel}\r\nSometimes, users will accidentally delete issues, and the steps to restore those issues usually involves restoring backups, which would take quite a lot of time and effort.\r\n\r\nAs such, it would be great if JIRA had some sort of Recycle Bin or Trash (like in Confluence) so that users would be able to restore any accidentally deleted issues easily.",

When using Basic Search, the \"Status\" drop-down displays all Status values --- out-of-the-box as well as those we've added.\n\nh4. Usability Challenge\nAfter filtering on Issue Type, the \"Status\" drop-down still shows all Status values, many of which don't apply to the selected Issue Type.  _That is, by virtue of the associated Workflow(s), an Issue of the selected Type could never transition to certain Statuses._\n\nLet's say we define a \"Business Requirement\" Issue Type, and associate it with a new Workflow that allows Issues to have the following Status values:\n\n* In Progress\n* Ready for Customer Review\n* Customer Approved\n* Customer Rejected\n\nIf a user searches for \"Business Requirement\" Issues that have a Status of \"Closed\", there would be no matches.\n\nh4. Suggestion\nBecause criteria for Basic Search are applied with AND --- not OR --- it makes sense to use \"progressive disclosure\" in the drop-downs.  So if there are any values specified in the \"Type\" drop-down, the options available in the \"Status\" drop-down would be determined by:\n\n{code}select * from status\nleft join workflow on (status is defined in workflow)\nleft join issuetype on (issuetype is assigned to workflow){code}\n\nSimilarly, the \"Type\" drop-down options could be limited based on the value(s) selected for the \"Project\" drop-down.\n\nAlso, since this functionality might degrade response time, allow an Administrator to enable/disable it.\n\n(!) {color:red} *Devil's advocate says:*\nWhat happens when a user filters on two Issue Types, and then selects a Status value that applies only to the first, and _another_ Status value that applies only to the second?{color}\nThis scenario can be tested even without the suggested functionality.  It doesn't appear to be a problem...\n\nh4. Alternative Considerations\nIt occurred to me that a more appropriate approach might be for my team to create a Custom Field for \"Business Requirement Status\" instead of piggybacking onto the out-of-the-box Status field.  But given that we _are_ allowed to add our own values to the Status field, there is still a case for the suggested functionality.",

The only way to provide conditions is to define multiple transitions separated by conditions. This would lead to an exponentially growing number of alternate transitions as number of post-functions (and conditions) grow. \n\nIt would be useful if we could define condition(s) for individual post-functions of a single transition. Something like:\n1-Run post-function A\n2-Run post-function B if user is in group X.\n3-Run post-function C if (mycustomfield = Y and user is in role Z)\n\nThere are some add-ons in the market that introduce post-functions that have conditions. But those conditions apply only to those specific post-functions. If JIRA supports conditions then all post-functions, both system and add-on, can become conditional.\n\nThe same mechanism and library for transition conditions can be used. This way any new transition condition functions introduced by an add-on could also be used for post-function conditions.\n\nI don't know the inner workings of JIRA of course but I believe this could be implemented without breaking anything else and would give much more power and flexibility to the already powerful JIRA workflow engine.",

However, we are to compare JIRA 6.1.5 and Bamboo 5.3 (both latest) we can see huge differences. Eg:\n* JIRA supporting only OracleJDK 1.7, Bamboo does support OpenJDK 1.7 and OracleJDK 1.6 and 1.7\n* JIRA only support Tomcat 7 , Bamboo does support Tomcat 5,6,7\n* JIRA support Postgresql 8.3, 8.4 and 9.0 , meanwhile Bamboo supporting only 8.2+ (can't be sure if this mean PostgreSQL version 8.2 and above)\n\nIf we are to add FishEye 3.2 to this equation:\n\n* FishEye support Postgresql 8.2 , 8.3 and 8.4 .\n\nEven though, some of the versions does match for the applications , it does not allow the customer to have a consistent versions of platform that they should use. Upgrading platforms like database is a challenge as we do not have a specific page for users with multiple product running. We should at least has a central page to recommend customer what environment is the best for every major release as this is when we evaluate the Supported Platform. ",

Some of those comments are:\n{quote}\nIf you get 400 Bad Request exceptions from your JIRA installation when running behind IIS try adding a web.config to the JIRA IIS folder with the following:\n\n<system.webServer>\n<httpErrors errorMode=\"Detailed\" />\n</system.webServer>\n{quote}\n\nAnd:\n{quote}\nPlease note that if the IIS 7 role/feature \"HTTP Errors\" is installed, IIS does not forward the \"custom\" error pages from JIRA / Confluence and instead displays its own error page, e.g. on 401 (unauthorized) or 404 (not found) errors. This is a problem in particular when those custom errors are being processed by JavaScript (e.g. after clicking a button on a page), since the actual error reason is then obviously \"being lost by IIS\".\n\nTo cut it short: If you don't need it for anything else, remove the \"HTTP Errors\" on IIS 7.\n{quote}\n\nIt will make it much easier for the users to troubleshoot their integration if some of those comments were included in the document.

The problem is that the domain that was added by this config is one of 2 that we use, \"cbc.ca\".  We also use domain \"radio-canada.ca\", therefore those that have an adresse at radio-canada.ca cannot log into our Jira OnDemand.\n\nIt seems that this tool uses OpenID instead of OAuth.  Is there another tool or config we could use to provide OAuth Google authentication for all users working at CBC/Radio-Canada?  We use JIRA v6.2-OD-05-4.\n\nThank you.",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-36275].\n  {panel}\n\nHi!\n\nWe use the Jira for project management and we adopt Category as \"Customer\".\nNow I need migrate our defects management from Bugzilla to Jira.\n\nIn our process, components and versions are attributes of \"products\" (products are the systems resulting from our projects). In other words, we execute several projects to improve the same product!\n\nI think that we should not duplicate all the versions and components configurations for each new project of the same product...\n\nThe subcomponents solution have the same problem... all structure (components/subcomponents) are exclusive to one unique project...\n\nI think that if the Jira had projects hierarchy, we can use the level 1 as product and project level 1.1 as project, with components reuse (as the Mantis tool can do). Or something like it.\n\nWhat's your current position about this issue JRA-12241?\nhttps://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRA-12241\n\nWhat solution do you indicate to my need?\n\nThanks a lot!\n",

S3 storage may be accessed using AWS IAM credentials which can be highly restricted, basically having only write access to only one subfolder in one bucket, which is much safer than the current option to give JIRA Cloud administrative credentials to a script to pull the backup from Atlassian.",

Your input in the comments helps us understand how your teams work and what you're hoping to accomplish with JIRA.\r\n\r\nWe have decided to close this specific request for _additional status categories_ as Won't Fix. The finite set of status categories allows us to build useful features on top of them, like completion progress indicators for Epics and Versions.\r\n\r\nWe recognize that for many teams, most of the steps in a workflow are \"In Progress\" and that it can be difficult to distinguish them. Here are some strategies:\r\n * Add additional columns to your board for different workflow states. You can have several \"In Progress\" columns to represent concepts like \"In Development\" or \"Under Review\".\r\n * Use the card colors based on JQL queries feature ([documentation|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/AGILE/Customising+Cards#CustomisingCards-colours]) to define your own colors for workflow states. I've created this suggestion in the JIRA Agile project to improve this in the future: GHS-11666\r\n * Use JIRA Agile card layouts (new in JIRA Agile 6.6) to show the workflow state on the card ([documentation|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/AGILE/Customising+Cards#CustomisingCards-fields])\r\n * To customize the display of issues within the JIRA issue navigator, consider the free third-party [icnavigator add-on|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/de.iconcept.icnavigator.jira-icnavigator] from Interconcept GmbH.\r\n\r\nWe do not plan to support arbitrary colors for status categories. The mapping of blue, yellow, and green to \"To Do\", \"In Progress\", and \"Done\" is part of [Atlassian's overall visual system|https://design.atlassian.com/latest/product/components/lozenges/]. Our intent is to improve how we use this pattern to communicate information in JIRA; however, we use the combination of colors and lozenges to represent concepts not only in JIRA, but across Atlassian's product suite.\r\n\r\nFinally, there were specific requests for a \"Red\" status color. The main use case here was situations where an issue had progressed to the end of a workflow, but the resolution was negative (e.g. \"Failed\" instead of \"Done\"). In JIRA's structure, this connects the final workflow state (i.e. \"Resolved\") with the type of resolution. While there's certainly merit in this request, it has the potential to significantly increase JIRA's complexity.\r\n\r\nI understand that our decision may be disappointing. Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nDave Meyer\r\nJIRA Product Manager\r\n{panel}\r\nThe new status colors in JIRA provides initial set of pre-defined statues. It would also be beneficial to add the ability for users to add more categories to it",
