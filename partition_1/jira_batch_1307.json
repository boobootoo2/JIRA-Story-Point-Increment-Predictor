We highly value your feedback in all forms, and through suggestions in jira.atlassian.com is not different. We use this channel often to learn the best we can with how customers use JIRA and how we can continue to improve the experience for as many users as possible.\n\nWe have revisited this issue again recently and wanted to reiterate that there are still currently no plans to implement this suggestion, and it is not currently on any JIRA team\u2019s roadmap at this stage.\n\nPlease remember that jira.atlassian.com is one of many inputs for the JIRA roadmap. You can [learn more about our process here|https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/110373/how-does-the-jira-team-use-jira-atlassian-com].\n\nI understand that our decision may be disappointing. Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.\n\n\nRegards,\nKerrod Williams\nKerrod (dot) Williams (at) atlassian (dot) com\nProduct Manager, JIRA\n\n{panel}\n\nUsers may choose to watch individual issues. Some users however would like to receive notifications whenever anything is added or modified within a specific project. In order to set this up, currently, a new group and notification scheme needs to be created for each project, and users must be added by an administrator. Instead, there should be a watch/stop watching option available on every project summary page.",

Then we do the following steps:\n1. Create a group named \"X-Project\"\n2. Create users\n3. Click every single user into the group (boooring)\n4. Create a Permission Scheme from a template Scheme through copy\n4b. Rename the Scheme to \"X-Project\"\n4c. Add the \"X-Project\"-group to the right permissions\n5. Create a Layout-Scheme from a template Scheme through copy\n5b. Rename the Scheme to \"X-Project\"\n6. Create a Notification Scheme from a template Scheme through copy\n6b. Rename the Scheme to \"X-Project\"\n7. FINALLY! Create a Project !!! And Assign all Schemes to it !!!\n\nOK, this was just to show you how much time and effort it takes to setup projects like this. \n\nTHIS is, what i think would improve this SOMEWHAT:\n\nTHE ALL NEW CREATE PROJECT PAGE !\nHere is what it looks like:\n   - Like today: Name, Project Lead, etc.\n\n   - For each scheme (Notification, Permission, Layout, Security) you either select an existing\n     one (like today) of you select one and also activate a checkbox which reads (create from  \n     template)\n   - if the \"create from template\" checkbox is activated for a selected scheme, this scheme \n     gets copied and renamed to the name of the project after you click the Create Button\n   - There is another checkbox : Create \"Project Group\". If this checkbox is activated a \n     group will be created, which is named exactly like the project\n   - Click \"Create\"\n   - Everything gets created\n   - You are asked, which users to add to the new project group (if you created such a group) and \n     you can select them from a listbox (with multi-select) and click on add. These users are then      added to the new group\n   - Done - you get navigated to the newly created project administration page\n\nThe only thing left to do would be editing the new schemes. Or has anyone good ideas how to get the scheme editing neatly into this process?\n\n",

We understand this has been a long running request. We also understand this has caused a lot of frustration so I don't want to ignore that fact, but I do hope to strike a chord of optimism with this update.\r\n\r\nA recap of the current workarounds:\r\n\r\n*(1) Utilising team-managed projects*\r\n # From your project sidebar, go to {*}Project settings > Issue types{*}.\r\n\r\n # Select *Description* and update the default description you want to see when you\u2019re creating an issue.\r\n\r\n*(2) Add Description text for a field*\r\n\r\nNote: Before you begin, you\u2019ll need to [set up a field configuration scheme for your issue types in your project|https://support.atlassian.com/jira-cloud-administration/docs/configure-a-field-configuration-scheme/].\r\n\r\nTo update the description for the *Description* field:\r\n # Go to *Settings*\u00a0{*}> Issues > Field configuration{*}.\r\n\r\n # Select {*}Field configuration{*}.\r\n\r\n # Under {*}Actions{*}, select {*}Configure{*}.\r\n\r\n # Find the *Description* field, and select {*}Edit{*}.\r\n\r\n # Update the description for the field 'Description' in the text box.\r\n\r\nThe description you add will come up when you create an issue of a certain issue type if it has been associated with the screen. [Learn more about associating fields with screens|https://support.atlassian.com/jira-cloud-administration/docs/change-a-field-configuration/].\r\n\r\n*(3) Configure automation rules for your system fields.*\r\n\r\nThere\u2019s some suggested workflows from other community members in [[Default text for Description field on Jira Cloud|https://community.atlassian.com/t5/Jira-questions/Default-text-for-Description-field-on-Jira-Cloud/qaq-p/785597]]\r\n\r\n[Learn more about automation rules in Jira cloud|https://support.atlassian.com/jira-software-cloud/docs/create-and-edit-rules/].\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nAs for building the feature to add default values to system fields in company-managed projects, it is still on our radar.\r\n\r\nFor transparency, there\u2019s a number of foundational pieces we are working on in order to unblock this feature. At this stage we hope to be able to start work on this in 12 months - we understand it\u2019s a long time and we ask for your continued patience as we work through the implementation.\r\n\r\nPlease continue to vote and in particular please continue to add comments on how your teams find value when using default values for system fields. This feedback on your specific needs and use cases is invaluable for us as we continue to evolve Jira Cloud.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nRegards,\u2028\r\nCarol Low\r\nProduct Manager, Jira Cloud\r\n{panel}\r\n*Original request description*\r\n\r\nI would like to provide default values not only for custom, but also for *system* fields.\r\n\r\nAn example:\r\nDepending on the issue type, I would like to provide different default values for the field \"Description\" which help users to fill in e.g. the details of a bug issue.",

The backup leader then has to setup a few filters to search accross the relevant projects for activity.

Your feedback is key to helping us understand how you use JIRA so we can continue improving your experience. We have reviewed this issue over the last few days.\n\nImproving notifications in JIRA is a key area that we intend to address as soon as possible. It's important to us that we not only improve JIRA notifications, but also work towards more consistency between JIRA and other Atlassian applications like Confluence and Bitbucket.\n\nWhile we can't provide a concrete timeline, rest assured that this is something we are actively thinking about this across Atlassian and plan to invest in as soon as it's feasible.\n\nIt's important to understand that we rarely try to implement individual features from jira.atlassian.com, but instead take a holistic look at the problem and use feedback from the comments here and a [dozen other sources|https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/110373/how-does-the-jira-team-use-jira-atlassian-com] of customer input to solve the core problems.\n\nPlease don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or feedback.\n \nRegards,\nDave Meyer\ndmeyer@atlassian.com\nProduct Manager, JIRA Platform\n{panel}\n\nBeing able to create notication groups based by \"Issue Type\".\n\nlet's say for example I would like to create an issue type \"Business Feature\", and have a group of people \"Business Feature Group\", so when any issue related to \"Business Feature\" type is created etc... notification is sent to the group \"Business Feature Group\".\nand so on...",

We highly value your feedback in all forms, and through suggestions in jira.atlassian.com is not different. We use this channel often to learn the best we can with how customers use JIRA and how we can continue to improve the experience for as many users as possible.\r\n\r\nWe have revisited this issue again recently and wanted to highlight that there are still currently no plans to implement this suggestion, and it is not currently on any JIRA team\u2019s roadmap at this stage. We'll be reworking notifications entirely in the future, but as this is not marked to begin in the next 12 months we feel it isn't the right thing to do to commit to any timeline.\r\n\r\nPlease remember that jira.atlassian.com is one of many inputs for the JIRA roadmap. You can [learn more about our process here|https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/110373/how-does-the-jira-team-use-jira-atlassian-com].\r\n\r\nI understand that our decision may be disappointing. Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n Kerrod Williams\r\n Kerrod (dot) Williams (at) atlassian (dot) com\r\n Product Manager, JIRA\r\n{panel}\r\nCurrently, custom fields are not displayed in emails.

This would allow the user to modify the report params without having to constantly switch back and forth between pages.\n\nExample 1:\n\n+---\n| #Config section\n| Report for group [Atlassian Developers|V]\n| [X] Show Workload of individual product versions\n+----\n| # Report Data (remaining workload in days per developer per version)\n|            |             | Mike        | Scott | ...\n| -----------+-------------+-------------+-------+--------\n| Jira       | Version 3.0 | 14          | 5\n|            | Version 3.1 | 6           | 23\n+------------+-------------+------ ...\n| Confluence | Version 1.2 | 26\n\nExample 2 (Version splitting turned off):\n\n+---\n| #Config section\n| Report for group [Atlassian Developers|V]\n| [ ] Show Workload of individual product versions\n+----\n| # Report Data (remaining workload in days per developer)\n|            | Mike        | Scott | ...\n| -----------+-------------+-------+-------+--------\n| Jira       | 20          | 28\n+------------+-------------+------ ...\n| Confluence | 26\n\n\nIt is today possible to implement this (see forum thread mentioned above), but it's clumsy, involves duplicating original Jira code, and each plugin developer has do do this for each plugin.\n\nA declarative solution would be much easier for the plugin developer, e.g.:\n\n<resource type=\"velocity\" name=\"view\"\n    location=\"templates/plugins/jira/reports/time-tracking-report.vm\">\n\n    <!-- default would be false -->\n    <property name=\"allowInlineConfiguration\" value=\"true\"/>\n</resource>\n\nJira would do all the plumbing for the plugin developer (include fields, generate form submission code, etc.).\n\nA further improvement suggested by Owen: Might be worth allowing each property to be inlineConfigurable so you can just have some filter that are refined.",

Your feedback is key to helping us understand how you use JIRA so we can continue improving your experience. We have reviewed this issue over the last few days; however there are not currently any plans to implement this suggestion.\n\nWhile we absolutely understand many the logic behind many of the requests for more extensive issue hierarchies in JIRA, we strongly believe that our focus should be on making JIRA simpler and easier to use. Simply put, additional levels of hierarchy will add complexity on a conceptual level, at a technical level (more bugs and slower performance) and will lead to a more confusing UI.\n\nIn the mean time there is a commercial third party plugin available, [Structure|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.almworks.jira.structure] that provides the ability to create a hierarchy of issues for JIRA Server customers.\n\nPlease remember that jira.atlassian.com is one of many inputs for the JIRA roadmap.

Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.\n \nRegards,\nDave Meyer\ndmeyer@atlassian.com\nProduct Manager, JIRA Platform\n{panel}\n\n*Original request description:*\n\nAs a JIRA user I need more hierarchical organisation of tasks. As of today JIRA offers only a two-level hierarchy (if installed without plugins): stories and subtasks. But in reality the process of resolving issues can be much more complicated. During the process of analysis a simple story can be broken into a number of sub-tasks. And then each of the sub-tasks may be consequently broken into a set of even more granular entities. JIRA does not support an easy way of handling multiple levels of hierarchy in a natural way and the available workarounds require additional steps which render the solution suboptimal.",

This is quite a common need, as project leaders often need to delegate certain tasks.  An example is delegation of \"defect management\" for a project.  Ordinarily, on the assignee, reporter and project lead can edit or re-assign an issue.  However the defect manager needs to be able to do this for any issue in the project. \n\nBasically what is needed is a built-in per-project group called \"Project Admins\" or similar.  It would be different for each project (like the project lead is), but could be assigned permissions globally within a scheme.  \n\nAlternatively, you could allow permissions to be assigned to the group of Component Leads (implicitely per-project).

Your feedback is key to helping us understand how you use JIRA so we can continue improving your experience. We have reviewed this issue over the last few days; however there are not currently any plans to implement this suggestion.\n\nIn the meantime, please check out these plugins:\n* [Configuration Manager from Botron Software|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.botronsoft.jira.configurationmanager] \n* [Project Configurator from Awnaba Software|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.awnaba.projectconfigurator.projectconfigurator]\n\non our Atlassian marketplace. Both of these plugins are available for the downloaded instances of JIRA and solve the use cases outlined in this requirement.\n\n\nThere's also another solution emerging from an Atlassian Exper Catworkx.de. You can check out the [factsheet here|https://www.catworkx.de/produkte/catWorkX%20Produkte/configuration-importer/Configuration_Importer_for_JIRA_fact_sheet.pdf]\n\n\nPlease remember that jira.atlassian.com is one of many inputs for the JIRA roadmap. You can [learn more about our process here|https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/110373/how-does-the-jira-team-use-jira-atlassian-com].\n\nI understand that our decision may be disappointing.

This should be single step. Maybe by selecting the before/after existing version when adding. (Often we are adding versions to our production branch, but the development branch version has already been created and should remain the last version.\n\nWell, if version were richer in semantics, the above would be a non-issue. Often we have version like:\n\n10.0\n10.1\n10.2\n11.0\n11.1\n\nBut jira sees these as only text strings. The ability to treat version hierarchically would be very helpful:\n\n10     (where this represents a major version)\n.10.0  (these reprent minor versions, or patches)\n.10.1\n.10.2\n\nIf this semantic was part of the model, reordering would not be required. Of course, this semantic would need to be configurable as I'm sure some users really do want just text values. But I suspect most really use numbers as above.\n\nThe concept of released/non-released seems only to be manifest in the selection lists when selecting versions. We would like to place restrictions on what affects-versions can be assigned to a [new] issue. For example, in our process, it never makes sense for a non-developer (eg, group jira-developer) to assing a version to a non-released version. Our users/tests are always assigning issues non-sensical versions (ie, a bug against a version that has not been deployed). \n\nExtending the released/non-released to versions in development/test/production would be very helpful. Of course, this is just one example of assinging meta-data to the version. Others will want other values for the, say, version state. Some will want other meta-data, like comments associated with a version. But mainly we are looking for the ability to control the workflow based on the version meta-data.\n\nThe simple stringness of version makes it difficult to create a ant-task that can bounce version numbers are part of a deployment. I've looked into the code, and yes, it would not be too hard manipulate the versions. But it would require parsing and such. If version had first-class semantics, statements such as: \"Create the next version the v10 line\". If v10.4 was the current last version, v10.5 would be created. And if v11.x already existed, v10.5. would be scheduled prior to any v11's. \n\nAgain, this makes assumptions about the meaning of version. I know you wanted to leave much flexibility. Maybe some kind of plugin framework that allows for incorporating version semantics...",
