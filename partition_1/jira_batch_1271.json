You will only be able to make changes to the layout.\"\n\nI had to browse through several Jira issues to end up at JRA-7661, where I then learned that this message is simply not true. Apparently, you can edit them, you just have to jump through stupid hoops for no reason: click 'create draft' at the top and then publish it. (Note also that you can't _not_ publish it!)\n\nSo, I see several issues:\n- at the very very least, the message should say that you can make draft/publish\n- if it's possible via the the make draft/publish, it's possible and I shouldn't be forced to go through that. Let me edit, if you want to 'make draft' and 'publish' behind the scenes, do whatever you need\n- for working on a big change, the draft can be useful, but then at least I should be able to drop (aka cancel/clear/revert or whatever you want to call it) the draft!\n- from the docs I see the editing a draft of an active workflow still has some limitations, so maybe these should get a message in blue too.",

There is nothing to show that a transition from the current status is not currently possible.  It would help if the viewer clearly indicated the difference between valid and invalid transitions.  Perhaps by use of colour, or a dashed line instead of solid?\n\nSimple example:  Create a condition for the Resolve Issue Transition \"All sub-tasks must have one of the following statuses to allow parent issue transitions: Resolved or Closed.\",  Users have problems with this in that the Resolve or Close actions are sometimes available and sometimes not (dependent on the sub-tasks).  When the actions are not available and they click on \"View Workflow\" it tells them contradictory information...  it seems to indicate that they should be able to Resolve/Close.  This causes confusion and leads to support calls.",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-26942].\n  {panel}\n\nI just wanted to checkup on our database documentation for JIRA.  As you know, JIRA 4.4+ has the database setup within the Setup Wizard.  This is already noted here:\n\nhttp://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Connecting+JIRA+to+a+Database\nbq. If you are setting up a completely new JIRA installation, the JIRA Setup Wizard will configure a database connection for you to either JIRA's internal HSQL database or an external database.\n\nThe problem is if a customer only checks their specific database sections:\n\nhttp://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Connecting+JIRA+to+MySQL\nhttp://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Connecting+JIRA+to+SQL+Server+2005\nhttp://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Connecting+JIRA+to+SQL+Server+2008\nhttp://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Connecting+JIRA+to+HSQLDB\nhttp://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Connecting+JIRA+to+PostgreSQL\n\nThe titles are called 'Connecting JIRA to ____', but in none of these documentations tell a reader that the connection can be setup via JIRA's initial Setup Wizard.\n\nHow does a customer get directly to the 'Connecting to ____' pages?\nGoogle is one example.  If you simply type in \"jira mysql\" into Google, the first few results go directly to 'Connecting JIRA to MySQL'.\n\nI just wanted to bring this to your attention and see if this is something that we should change.",
