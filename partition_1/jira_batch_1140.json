However, this poses a problem when the user is importing a project on a production system and is not looking carefully at the data.\n\nFor example, assume that I've prepared a configuration file that corresponds to a particular type of CSV template. I've tested and verified that the mapping works.\n\nLater, I get a new CSV file from a user that conforms to my previously-generated template, but it contains an incorrect value for one of the field values (say, an incorrect Resolution value). When I go to process the CSV file with JIM, it will go ahead and happily create a new Resolution (which applies to the entire JIRA instance), even if this resolution was just a typo that was meant to be another real resolution. This happens silently, which can lead to other non-localized problems (such as users entering the incorrect resolution values in entirely unrelated projects).\n\nBefore beginning the final import process, JIM should warn the user that it is about to create field value 'xxx' for custom field 'yyy', which would eliminate this problem.",

This means that all imported data by JSON has Security Level set to 'None'. This issue also concerns importing - user cannot specify Security informations\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n\n1. Make sure you have a project with defined Security Levels (e.g. 'None' and 'abc-staff').\n2. Create Issue A which is only visible for abc-staff\n3. Create Issue B which is visible for everyone\n4. Add comment to Issue B which will be visible only for abc-staff\n5. List Both issues on Search screen\n6. Export Issues to JSON (make sure that user who performs the export has abc-staff permissions)\n7. Import exported data in step 6. to other project / other JIRA instance\n\nExpected Version 1: Imported data in step 7. has the same security Levels that had the source issues.\nExpected Version 2: Exproted data in step 6. has skipped secured Informations so they are not imported in step 7.\n\nActual: There is none Security-Level informations is JSON, Step 6. exports all data that is visible for the user who performs the export.

Once very nice thing with this is that the configuration file in the earlier steps remembers the mappings I created. So if I run through this for one of our projects we can use mostly the same configuration file for other projects. Also, since the configuration file is text I can write a script to do the user name mapping rather than having to fill in 400+ username ids :).\n\n*Screen 5 - Links*\nThis shows that the server adds two more link import options. The critical one for us is the duplicate case mapping. See also is nice but we don't actually intentionally use that much.\n{quote}",

Problem Definition\nWhen importing from an external system such as Bitbucket, basically the importer is able to map usernames to JIRA usernames correctly, and create new JIRA accounts when there is no username match in JIRA. However, sometimes usernames from the external system don't match usernames of the same users in JIRA, or on the other hand, usernames in the external system coincidentally match usernames of entirely different users in JIRA (disastrous), and there is no simple way to choose to map with other attributes.\n\nThis would probably apply to all External System Import. However, the context in the support case that led to this is Bitbucket to JIRA import. More details in the internal comment.\n\nh3. Suggested Solution\nPerform the by-username/by-whatever-it-is-the-importer-uses mapping, as it is being done now, but before the importer moves on to the next stage, allow the user to review and change the mappings manually (while validating consistency of user input, of course - no double mapping), then write the changes to the target directory.",

In our use case, I want to import issues only. Users, issue types etc are already set up in JIRA.\n\nTo my surprise, new issue types, users and other items are created automatically without any warning upon import. As we already have a fully configured JIRA environment with everything setup, I don't want the importer to create anything new. If it needs to, it is because I've made a mistake in the csv file or the mapping.\n\nThe importer should be able to issue a warning before adding new users, issue types or anything else belonging to the JIRA configuration.",

So they are there.\n\nI believe, this is a bug in the design!\nNever should an enry be recorded under a wrong user, a user who was not the author/actor of it. That makes the whole imported project useless, if you cannot rely on its correctness. Please let the importing user decide how and if to record such an entry.\nI would rather like to reassign open issues to active users after importing, than manually fixing the issues one by one (if possible at all).\n\nBtw. i dont understand when importing partial historical data, why a user needs to exist. Can Jira not store entries from deleted users and still show their names?\n\nEdit: This might be important:\nThe server runs with a 10 user license only, because we have less than 10 active users at the moment. The bugzilla importer filled the jira_users group up to its limit (10). I think, it should not add active or inactive users to roles/groups, unless told by the importing user.",
