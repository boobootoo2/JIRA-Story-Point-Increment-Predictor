      "description": "I think it'd be nice to have the ability to see exactly what Git CLI command is being executed when performing a GUI operation. Sometimes when I check a couple boxes during a merge for example. It'd be great to see the Git command equivalent of what action I'm going to be performing. For example, if I've checked options that equal the {{-no-ff}} option during a merge, it'd be nice to see that explicitly so I don't have to decipher whether the check box options are equivalent or not. It might be a great way for people who are used to CLI Git commands to double-check their operations.\r\n\r\nHope you find this suggestion useful.",
