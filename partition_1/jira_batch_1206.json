However, in an agile Git workflow, we create a branch for every story/bug/... and we solve subtasks in one or a few commits within that branch. As such, the parent issue usually displays 1 branch and a number of merge commits, and the subtasks display no branches (and of course the commits related to them).\n\nI would suggest that the parent issue should display the branches related to it, and the commits related to itself + the commits related to its subtasks. The subtasks could display the branches related to themselves + the branches related to their parent, and only the commits related to themselves.\n\nThis way, while viewing a subtask you could get straight to the branch related to it even if that branch is linked to the parent issue, and while viewing the parent issue you would get a proper overview of the commits that have been done to resolve it even if those commits are linked to subtasks.\n\nAlso, while viewing a subtask you should not see commits related to the parent issue or sibling subtasks (unless they're also related to the subtask at hand, of course), since at that point you would expect a more specific/detailed view, and while viewing a parent issue you should not see branches of subtasks because you should view the subtasks themselves to get to their branches anyway.",

Since JIRA can link a project to Bitbucket, this shouldn't be hard to simply add a link for it.\n\nTo be even more powerful, it would be cool if JIRA could show the Git log for all commits since the last JIRA Version, assuming both versions have a link to the tag/commit (in other words, automatically set the git log length, based on the previous Version tag).\n\nAnd one step further, be able to have tag/commit links to multiple repos, since a single project version may draw from libraries in separate git repositories.  \n\nAnd if all this could be set via an HTTP API, then we could script it to create all these links from a Maven build (or from Bamboo, etc) to automatically setup all this links for us, and then have a complete Git Log of all the changes in our non-third-party code from multiple libraries.",

I selected 'dont send email' which stopped JIRA driven notifications.  I had a registered external cloudservice consuming webhook notifications that has been otherwise able to consume all events.  On this occasion, JIRA seemed to encounter a timeout of somekind, reporting a session expiry, all the issues were deleted in this case, and from what I can tell, webhook data was successfully sent, but, the point of this issue is that from the users perspective 'something went wrong', whatever caused this timeout or other, for a bulk delete needs to be more flexible, to take into account of delays talking to external systems.  \n\nThis only happened with one addon and ~250 issues.  I would imagine multiple addons and many more issues would result in the same, and (possibly?) also result in lost webhook notifications.\n\nA suggestion would be to provide regular user on-screen feedback on numbers of issues 'dealt with' out of the total.  \n",

Steps to reproduce\n\n# Using JIRA 6.3.1, connect it to a Confluence instance\n# Try to link a JIRA ticket to a Confluence page, using the 'Search for a page' functionality\n# It will fail/get stuck (no errors in the GUI), but if the development tools are used, this can be seen :\n\n!applink.png|thumbnail!\n\nh3. Additional info :\n\n* If the user links the page directly via the URL of the Confluence page, it will work with no problem\n* Other applink functionalities (such as JIRA Issue Macro) seems to be working fine\n* This appears to only happen in JIRA 6.3.1. During the test, it was connected with Confluence 5.5.3 \n\nh3. Workaround\n\nFor now, I would recommend that the links from JIRA issue to Confluence page be done directly via the URL of the page",

I had this happen accidentally this morning when I created a copy of an existing workflow and ran through the above. When it was brought to my attention, I went to fix the original workflow, only to discover that in the Administration -> Workflows view, the original workflow still looked fine and matched what was expected. Through that view, it had not been edited. The timestamp of the last edit had also not been updated. When viewing the original workflow through the project to which it was attached, however, the changes were visible. This despite no changes having been published to any workflow, including the copy.\n\nYou cannot directly edit a workflow through a Project -> Administration view, but I got to it through the workflow scheme and reverted the changes on the original workflow. I  then checked my copy and saw that the copied workflow had the statuses changed, but the additional status I'd created, as well as the transitions I'd modified, were still there.\n\nIt looks like a copied workflow continues to reference the same database rows/columns for statuses despite referencing new/different rows/columns for transitions.

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-39195].\n  {panel}\n\nA change log / version gadget showing an overview over the already released versions of projects would be quite handy. Visually I'm imagining basically something like the roadmap gadget but for already released versions.\n\nYou can already somehow achieve something like this with the two-dimensional filter statistics (see: attached screenshot), but that has two main drawbacks:\na) clicking on the versionnumber I'd like to be presented the release notes report of the project instead of the issue list for that version as it does atm (or some other means to access the release notes directly from within that gadget view)\nb) visually it's not quite appealing (the style of the roadmap gadget would be much more preferable for a change log / version gadget).\n\nWas also already suggested/discussed here: https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/37129/released-versions-change-log-gadget",
