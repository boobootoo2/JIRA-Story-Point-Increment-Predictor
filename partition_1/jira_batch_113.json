This happens literally\u00a0**\u00a0*every* time I update Sourcetree and it's driving me completely nuts! \r\n\r\nI have it set up to use ssh keys and it worked just fine in the minutes before the update. Now it asks me to 'connect' button and go through the sign-in. Which makes no difference at all. No error messages onscreen that I can see. Just silent failure.\r\n\r\nI'm really not exaggerating when I say this happens every time I update. And I have to confess that I just properly lost my cool when it happened again. Authentication with Bitbucket is the _only_ consistent weak point I have had with Sourcetree for years and it's incredibly frustrating. Otherwise it's a great app and I love it enormously. Can you PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE stop this from happening again and again.\r\n\r\nAnd now, I tried it again to get a screen capture and it says 'too many failed login attempts'.\r\n\r\nMan, this is frustrating! I've attached some static screenshots I took earlier. You can see the lack of any kind of errors.\r\n\r\n\u00a0",

      "description": "When using SourceTree to clone a git repository, SourceTree displays a dialog with a full progress bar and a few lines of text, but then no feedback on the progress (or lack thereof) of the operation.\r\n\r\nSample text:\r\n{code}git -c filter.lfs.smudge= -c filter.lfs.required=false -c diff.mnemonicprefix=false -c core.quotepath=false -c credential.helper=sourcetree clone --branch master <source URI> <checkout path>\r\nCloning into '<checkout path>'...\r\nwarning: templates not found /usr/local/git/share/git-core/templates\r\n<no feedback>{code}\r\n\r\nI just had a co-worker, who normally uses another source control tool, make a fresh clone of the repository. We started the clone, then sat there staring at the dialog, unsure if there was a problem contacting the server (maybe it failed to display the error?), if the operation was in progress (how far? or did it start and then fail?), if the operation had succeeded, or what. We did look in the target directory, but found no files, not even a .git directory, so we thought something had gone wrong and tried it again. The second time, we let it sit for several minutes and it did complete.\r\n\r\nThe expected behavior would be to have _some_ sort of progress indicator. The best would be to have a single progress bar that fills up once. (The dialog currently contains a progress bar, but it fills up immediately, long before the operation completes.) IIRC git can tell you the size of the repo and can report the amount of data transferred, so that could be part of the progress, and then any post-transfer work would fill it up the rest of the way. If that\u2019s too hard, it would be useful to at least have a text field that gets updated with the current step of the operation (i.e. \u201cgit: downloading hunk 2349cb\u2026\u201d). The changing text would give the user visual feedback that something is still happening. If you can\u2019t do those, an indefinite progress indicator would be better than nothing. In any case, the indicator should be tied to the activity of the operation.\r\n\r\nThe key phrase there is \u201ctied to the activity\u201d\u2014I don\u2019t want an indicator that updates completely independently of the operation. In other words, if the operation doesn\u2019t make progress (the DNS lookup is taking several seconds, git is connected to the server but data transfer is super-slow, etc.), the indicator should stop updating. If you spawn off git as another process and that process crashes, SourceTree should recognize that and display an error message. It should be clear that an operation is still active so that the user knows  that it hasn\u2019t ended, either cleanly or due to an error.",

Finally, some users may actually want to input their Atlassian password and not their Google password, in which case we should let them use the email method although they have a Gmail address.\r\n\r\nI don't know if non Gmail users had the same issue with the email method.

After he or she finishes, closes the window. Much cleaner workflow, and lacks the need of opening and closing the Repository Browser manually.\r\n\r\nTo be clear: I think you should integrate the Repository Browser's contents into the main (repository) windows, and let the user select some save repo then change the window content to reflect the repo window.",
