Summary\n\nIn [Configuring attachment settings|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/AdminJIRAServer071/Configuring+file+attachments] screen in the product, there is the description saying \"The total upload size limit of attachments.\" in *Attachment Size* field.\n !configure-attachment-size.png|thumbnail! \n\nFirst we think \"The total upload size\" means the total size limit of attachments per issue literally. But this is actually for setting max file size per attachment. This description is really misleading.\n\nh3. Environment\n(Optional - If Applicable)\n* Any environment as this appears as application message in product UI\n\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\n# Choose the cog icon in header,  then choose \"System\" under \"JIRA ADMINISTRATION \"\n# Choose \"Attachements\" in the left-hand panel.\n# You can see the description \"The total upload size limit of attachments.\" in \"Attachment Size\" field, and the default value is set as 10.00 MB.\n# When upload attachement files in a issue, I can upload many files with size 5MB, 6MB, 9.9MB. But I cannot upload a file over 10.00MB. So it's not right what \"The total upload size\" at 3. \n\nh3. Expected Results\n\nThe description at 3 should be corrected like \"The upload size limit of an attachment.\" \nOr JIRA user should be able to upload attachments  files up to 10MB per issue. \n\nh3.

Problem Definition\nThe \"connecting JIRA to SQL Server\" documentations do not mention the autoCommit parameter in the JDBC URLs. This parameter is needed to prevent deadlocks as per https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirakb/deadlock-when-running-jira-with-sql-server-283640022.html and so it should be a required configuration in JIRA's dbconfig.xml.\n\nh3. Suggested Solution\nModify the documentation to include {{autoCommit=false}} parameter by default:\nhttps://confluence.atlassian.com/jira063/connecting-jira-to-sql-server-2012-683541742.html\nhttps://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA064/Connecting+JIRA+to+SQL+Server+2008",

Summary\nJIRA can get into a state where most gadgets in the \"Add a gadget\" dialog on dashboards never load and JIRA displays a message saying \"Some gadgets failed to load\". Clicking the \"Try again\" link may or may not work.\n\nh3. Workaround\nJIRA Cloud customers should raise a support request at [support.atlassian.com|https://support.atlassian.com] and reference this bug, and the support team will restart JIRA and increase the maximum amount of memory available to it as a temporary workaround until the bug itself is fixed.\n\nh3. Technical notes\n*Current Situation*\n\nThe dashboard fetches gadgets in a two-step operation:\n# Upon clicking \"add gadget\" the dashboard directory is loaded and filled with the contents of the call to /rest/config/1.0/directoryitems/local.json. If this call times out (60secs) a retry is available to attempt it again. This is current design and behaviour, if the timeout is reached the \"Broken Pipe\" exception will be logged, this is again expected behaviour.\n# Also, the dashboard will attempt to fetch external gadgets at this time via a background request to /rest/config/1.0/directoryitems/external.json and will notify this to the end user via the \"Not all gadgets have loaded\" information box on the dashboard. This is not an error, it's normal behaviour. Having said that, getting this timeout frequently in a specific instance might be indicative of some problem in it that would need to be troubleshooted for that customer.\n\nIf the aforementioned request to fetch external gadgets times out (60 secs), then you will get the \"Some gadgets failed to load\" message and a prompt to try again. This is also expected behaviour from JIRA. Having said that, getting this timeout frequently in a specific instance might be indicative of some problem in it that would need to be troubleshooted for that customer. For instance, they might have too many applinks, connectivity to applinked \ninstances of JIRA and Confluence might be too slow / etc...\n\n*What can be done now?*\n* We can consider bumping the Nginx timeout for these requests.\n* We can / probably should consider improving the messaging in the UI, so that what is actually happening is more clear to the end-user and support. I can even spot a spelling mistake in one of the messages \n\n*What can be done in the longer term?*\nThe current fetching / retry mechanism is quite naive as it tries to fetch everything in two one-shot requests and completely fails over to retrieve anything if the request(s) fail over. This is specially hurtful when it comes to remote specs. The number of remote specs is proportional to the amount of applinked instances and it will eventually not scale and timeout more and more frequently (this is exacerbated by the overhead of fetching the data from a remote host).\nWe can redesign the fetching mechanism such that specs are retrieved via a \"paging\" sort of mechanism (say 5 specs at a time for example) to achieve scalability and reduce the incidence of time-outs.\n\nWe can profile the fetching algorithm for a given spec to understand what performance improvements can be done for this operation such that we reduce the calculation time if possible.\n\nFurthermore, as part of other work being undertaken, we are replacing/removing the global cache that holds these gadget specs. I believe that re-architecting these fetching mechanism and the profiling described is a pre-requisite to be able to kill this cache so we need these three things to be done together at the same time.",

Each of these projects has issues associated with it\u2019s specific code base, but they are related.   Each has a different engineer working on it.  We also have other projects and different teams. So I have a board associated with Project X Firmwre and Project X software, call it board X, and a board that associates Projects X,Y,Z, call it Board XYZ.   When we do our sprint wrap ups we use the Board XYZ.  When we have discussions in day to day activities we might want to just discuss Project X firmware or Project X Software, or both (which we  use a Board X view for).  If I select Project X, I get Board X,  I get either a Board I created that is a mirror of the project Project Firmware X, or that has Project X Firmware and Project X software issues on it, depending on which I selected last from the \"view all boards\".    .  It seems to me there is really no purpose in selecting project views the way it is.  But a project view is more intuitive if you just want to look at views related to the project.\n \nNow that I understand how it works we certainly can find work arounds using filters.  But I think it would be more useful if Projects just gave the list of issues associated with that project and the same Backlog -> Sprint-> Chart  selections on the left.\n \n",

Steps to Reproduce\n# Create 2 projects in JIRA: project A and project B\n# Project A is using default permission scheme, where Link Issues permission is set to Any Logged In user\n# Project B is using a modified permission scheme where no role has the permissions to Link Issues\n# Find an Issue in Project A, and link it to any issue in project B\n\nh3. Expected Results\nEither result would be expected here:\n* JIRA creates the link on issue A, which is allowed per the permissions above, but does not create a link on issue in project B.\n* Or JIRA warns user that a reciprocal link can't be created on Issue B due to permissions (either way when we look at Issue B, we should not see any links)\n\nh3. Actual Results\nJIRA creates the link on both issues, despite project B's permission scheme that does not allow any user to link issues\n \nh3. Notes\n\n\nh3.Workaround\nnone\n\n\nh3.Original Description\n{quote}\nThis happened in a single-server setup, I had two projects, Project A and Project B. My user only had the Link Issues permission in Project A.\n\nI then tried to create an issue link from an issue in Project A to one in Project B which worked fine. I expected the issue link operation to fail b/c I just created an issue link on an issue of a project where I don't have the Link Issues permission. That just feels like breaking the permission restrictions.\n{quote}",

Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Create a user and a group and add the user to the group\r\n# Log in as this user\r\n# Create any filter or dashboard as this user\r\n# Share the filter/dashboard with the created group\r\n# Remove user from the group or delete the group in User Management\r\n# Find the filter in \u2018My Filters\u2019 or the dashboard in 'Manage Dashboards' and click it\r\n# Edit its JQL and carry out the search again\r\n# Click \u2018Save\u2019\r\n# Or try to edit the Dashboard and click on 'Update'\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nThe user is still able to edit the filter/dashboard.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nThe filter is actually not saved with this error:\r\n{noformat}\r\nThe filter My Filter could not be saved.\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nThis appears in the browser\u2019s JavaScript Console:\r\n{noformat}\r\nbatch.js?agile_global_admin_condition=true&atlassian.aui.raphael.disabled=true&is-system-admin=true\u2026:3875 PUT https://instance.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/filter/10100?expand=subscriptions[-5:] 400 ()\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nThe user won't be able to edit the Dashboard and also, the *Add Gadgets* and *Edit Layout* buttons won't display for the user.\r\n \r\nh3.

It can be quite large depending on the number of columns in the grid. Some customers report that they are getting error on saving of the custom field default value on the JIRA instances which use Oracle database. I checked it and noticed, that XMLVALUE column of the GENERICCONFIGURATION table that is used for this purpose has extremely short length(4000) whereas in other databases there is no limit at all on this column.\n\nAs the result some of our customers experience inconvenience working with Table Grid Editor on Oracle. Can you expand the length of the column or remove the limit at all in future versions?",
