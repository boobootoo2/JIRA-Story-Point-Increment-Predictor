Manually triggering incremental index won't help too.\r\n\r\nMost likely scenario that occured:\r\n # new changes were pushed to remote git repository\r\n # FishEye started indexing them, first step is to run fetch to update local clone (this seems to have finished correctly)\r\n # next step is to compare branches and tags in local repository against heads in remote repository.  But FishEye was restarted at this point (notice local clone was updated already)\r\n # after restart on every incremental index scan FishEye repeats steps 2 and 3.  Until step 2 brings new changes step 3 would assess that local and remote heads are the same and there is nothing to be indexed.\r\n\r\nh3.

Unfortunately non of the Atlassian products supports PlasticSCM directly.\r\n\r\nCurrently we are using the PlasticSCM plugins provides by Codice. But most of the time there are not as nice integrated as the repositories which are directly supported by Atlassian. \r\n\r\nWe think it is necessary for Atlassian to support PlasticSCM natively, since it's the best SCM system on the market, at least in our opinion. The native support would add value to all Atlassian products.\r\n\r\nEspecially Fisheye would benefit of a PlasticSCM support, since there isn't a plugin available yet. If you would integrate PlasticSCM support to Fisheye, we would immediatly buy a License for our Company. And I am sure others will do the same!\r\n",
