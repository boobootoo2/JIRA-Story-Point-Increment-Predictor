Issue Summary\r\nWhen a DN contains Turkish characters it will create a duplicate user_mapping entry on incremental syncs and also remove users from groups every alterantive sync but is resolved upon the next full sync.\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n* Investigation provided by customer\r\n\r\nConsider this Java program with Turkish character in it:\r\n{code}\r\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\r\nString name = \"\u0130lhan\";\r\nString nameLower = name.toLowerCase();\r\n\r\nSystem.out.println(name + \" \" + name.length());\r\nSystem.out.println(nameLower + \" \" + nameLower.length());\r\nSystem.out.println(name.equalsIgnoreCase(nameLower));\r\n}\r\n\r\nand its output:\r\n\r\n\u0130lhan 5\r\ni\u0307lhan 6\r\nfalse\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nUsers are correctly synced both with incremental and full syncs.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nThe problem is in com.atlassian.crowd.directory.synchronisation.cache.UsnChangedCacheRefresher class. The class is used duing incremental synchronization with Active Directory. synchroniseUserChanges() is correct - it lowercases results and the next called method is supposed to synchronize group memberships.\r\n\r\nIn com.atlassian.crowd.directory.rfc4519.RFC4519DirectoryMembershipsIterable.searchUsers returns DNs of users which does not do lowercasing\r\n\r\n*Investigation*\r\n* Provided by customer\r\n{quote}\r\njavax.naming.ldap.LdapName.equals() uses String.equalsIgnoreCase which will not work for the Turkish language. There is a fantastic comment in com.atlassian.crowd.directory.ldap.util.DNStandardiser. It says a lot about handling of responses from LDAP directories. Unfortunately there is one place which is not using this strategy. Most of places where DNs or group member attribute is processed, case of characters is lowered.\r\n\r\nThe problem is in com.atlassian.crowd.directory.synchronisation.cache.UsnChangedCacheRefresher class. The class is used duing incremental synchronization with Active Directory. synchroniseUserChanges() is correct - it lowercases results and the next called method is supposed to synchronize group memberships.\r\n\r\nIn com.atlassian.crowd.directory.rfc4519.RFC4519DirectoryMembershipsIterable.searchUsers returns DNs of users which does not do lowercasing. The outcome can be seen on attached screenshots. Two representations of the accounts end up in users Map. Next piece of code (in mapHolderToMembership) uses lowercased names and in result removes the users because the Map contains Optional.empty values for them. This is the root cause why the two accounts are removed from the group. This case is also inefficient in updateCache() for all entries because the first \"for\" loop enters all accounts into \"users\" Map and the subsequent forEach updates the entires in the Map. The comment in DNStandardiser:\r\n\r\n* It is critical that the DN and memberDN are comparable based on a raw String comparison (String.equals)\r\n* for things like group membership determination and cache consistency.\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nh3.

If these DN's are a referral, then pagination breaks causing crowd to only sync the first page of results returned from AD.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Create 3 windows servers (in AWS)\r\n # Setup one with AD and promote to DC with GC (global catalogue) - this will be your base DN (I did test.com)\r\n # Setup the next two as child AD with no GC - I did one as \"apps.test.com\" and one as \"corp.test.com\" - (I had to add test.com into the hosts file on these)\r\n # Setup an admin user in \"test.com\" server - giving all the same groups as \"Administrator\"\r\n # Setup a regular user in \"corp.test.com\" server - under Users OU (I did \"myuser\")\r\n # Setup a new group OU in \"apps.test.com\" server - create 7 \"Domain local\" groups and sort them by alphabetical order.\r\n # From the \"apps.test.com\" server, add \"CORP\\myuser\" to the first and last group (in alphabetical order)\r\n\r\nNow we set up the MaxPageSize as 5 -\r\n # Login to the main \"test.com\" server as the admin user created in step 4 (I used admin@test.com from RDP)\r\n # Windows + R button -> Ntdsutil.exe\r\n # Type\u00a0{{LDAP policies}}\r\n # Type\u00a0{{connections}}\r\n # Type\u00a0{{connect to server \"test.com\"}}\u00a0(substitute with your BaseDN)\r\n # Type\u00a0{{q}}\u00a0to go back to \"LDAP policies\"\r\n # Type\u00a0{{Set MaxPageSize to 5}}\r\n # Type\u00a0{{commit changes}}\r\n # Verify the changes by typing\u00a0{{show values}}\r\n # In User directory settings - set the page size to 5\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nAll users and\u00a0groups get synced correctly\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nOnly the first 1000 users or groups that come back from the referral domain is populated due to the paginated result from LDAP.\r\n\r\nThe User and/or Group update count is constantly limited at 1000 in the application logs:\r\n{noformat}\r\n2020-12-13 16:26:37,065 INFO [Caesium-1-1] c.a.c.d.DbCachingRemoteChangeOperations scanned and compared [ 1000 ] groups for update in DB cache in [ 91ms ]\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nUser directory syncs can also remove groups/users which were populated by the \"update when logging in\" settings.\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nDue to the behavior being embedded into the java (com.sun.jndi.ldap.AbstractLdapNamingEnumeration has no pagination support), no direct work-around is available. We can mitigate / minimise the issue with the following:\r\n\r\n* We can minimise the amount of groups syncing unnecessarily by:\r\n** Setting up a group filter to exclude unneeded groups. See [here|https://confluence.atlassian.com/kb/how-to-write-ldap-search-filters-792496933.html]. Example, remove all groups that start with aa:\r\n{noformat}\r\n(&(objectCategory=Group)(!(cn=aa*)))\r\n{noformat}\r\n** Move unnecessary groups to a separate OU, or move Bitbucket groups to a new OU\r\n* We can update the LDAP pagination \"MaxPageSize\" to accommodate the number of groups using [View and set Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) policy with Ntdsutil \\- Windows Server \\- Microsoft Docs|https://docs.microsoft.com/en-US/troubleshoot/windows-server/identity/view-set-ldap-policy-using-ntdsutil] however this might have a performance impact for your AD and will need to be tested (depending on how much higher it goes)\r\n* We can convert the groups to [Universal scope|https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2003/cc755692(v=ws.10)?redirectedfrom=MSDN] and then point the directory to the global catalog.\r\n* If groups are the only dn being referred, we can setup a user directory to only sync groups (and not sync users) to pre-populate our application with all the necessary groups, and permissions can be applied to the groups. After this we then setup a delegated user directory for users and enable \"update groups on login\". This only works if users have less than 1000 groups attached to their account.",

Issue Summary\r\n\r\nAccording to Atlassian Troubleshooting and Support - Crowd (ATST) plugin [version history,\u00a0|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1221430/troubleshooting-and-support-crowd/version-history]\u00a0Crowd 3.7.0, supports ATST 1.20.3 . However, a fresh Crowd 3.7.0 installation comes with ATST 1.18.1 and there is no way to upgrade it to the supported versions above. This is also the case when upgrading from an earlier Crowd instance to 3.7.0.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe issue persists across all 3.7.x family.\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Install a fresh Crowd 3.7.0 or upgrade to Crowd 3.7.0 from an earlier version\r\n # Head over to\u00a0*Manage Apps* and locate\u00a0*Atlassian Troubleshooting and Support tools*\r\n # Expand and notice that the installed version is 1.18.1\r\n # No upgrade option is seen.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n * Crowd 3.7.x should include 1.20.3 or have the option to be able to upgrade the plugin.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n * the installed version is 1.18.1 in Crowd 3.7.x and no option to upgrade the app\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nA) upgrade to at least 4.0.5. (it is likely that the fix is available from 4.0.0, however, this was not tested)\u00a0\r\n B) OR install [ATST >= 1.20.3|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1221430/troubleshooting-and-support-crowd/version-history] manually (by i.g. picking its JAR in Crowd UI",

This can result in using different connections for different ranges. When Crowd is connected to load balancer it is possible that Crowd will receive subsequent pages from different nodes. AD nodes can use different sorting on attributes, and this can lead to inconsistency in groups.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPotential solution would be to use transactions for fetching subsequent pages with attributes.

Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nThese are steps for HTTP CONNECT request as it's simpler to reproduce:\r\n # Run `nc -k -l 8881` to simulate not responding forward proxy on port 8881\r\n # Add Remote Crowd directory with the following config:\r\n ## URL: [https://localhost|https://localhost/] - It's crucial that it's HTTP*S* so that Crowd will try to open a SSL tunnel via proxy.

Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Install data center\r\n# Set the cluster.node.name system property\r\n# Add an LDAP directory with cache enabled\r\n# View the directory.

Problem Definition\r\n\r\nIf a Crowd Administrator needs to forcefully drop all active users for any specific reason (due to password policy changes, security breaches etc), currently there is no one-click solution.\r\n\r\nThe ability to drop a specific User session currently exists on the *Current sessions* menu as the *Expire* button:\r\n\r\n!Screen Shot 2020-10-26 at 15.00.47.png|width=841,height=338!\r\n\r\nHowever, dropping all active user sessions can take time and effort if multiple users are currently logged in (eg. 200-300 sessions), as the Admin will have to click on the *Expire* button once for every active session.\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nCreate a new button to *Expire all sessions* on the *Current Sessions* menu that will essentially target all listed sessions and bulk-drop them. It would be a good idea to require a confirmation to avoid any misclicks.\r\n\r\nHaving this button aligned with the *Expire* buttons for individual users on the vertical axis and horizontally with the Filter boxes (Name, Directory, Results per page) would be intuitively be a good place for it.\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nCrowd Administrators can write a script to execute this function via REST API calls.\r\n # Fetch all active session hashes:\r\n{code:java}\r\ncurl --silent -u ${ADMIN_USERNAME}:${ADMIN_PASS} -XGET ${CROWD_BASE_URL}/rest/admin/latest/sessions/user\\?limit\\=-1 | jq '.values[].randomHash' | sed 's/\\\"//g\r\n{code}\r\n # Iterate over each line and for each ${hash} invoke:\r\n{code:java}\r\ncurl -u ${ADMIN_USERNAME}:${ADMIN_PASS} -XDELETE ${CROWD_BASE_URL}/rest/admin/latest/sessions/${hash}\r\n{code}",

Problem Definition\r\nCustomer has multiple directories configured in Crowd. The usernames are flattened, so that a {{jsmith}} may exist on more than one of the Directories, belloging to different actual users.\r\nWhen user {{jsmith}} tries to login, only the one in the first Directory, in the order set in Crowd, will be allowed to login.\r\nCustomer tried to add aliases to each of them, but aliases are associated with the user and the application, and not with the directory:\r\n !Screen Shot 2020-09-07 at 19.03.16.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\nDevelopment could consider including alias associated with a combination of username+directory, not only  username. So that we can have {{jsmithteamA}} and {{jsmithteamB}} (for instance) each of them associated with a different directory and user.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround \r\nCurrently, the user has to be renamed, or customers should use another attribute for username which is not duplicated across directories, such as e-mail for example.\r\nIf the remote Directory allows alias to be added to users, and it is set for all users, that alias attribute could be used as username in Crowd too.",

Some times this is difficult if the user or group names are similar and one has to know the exact name to search for the user/group.\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nWe would like to include a feature that would make it possible to sort using description, email, status, username (ascending/descending) for both groups and users. Basically all headers that are listed could be sortable. So that users/groups can quickly be located without the need for search functions. As this is only a client side function, hoping that the change could be made without changes at the server side.\u00a0\r\nh3. Why This Is Important\r\n\r\n_This would help in locating users/groups in addition to the search option. If one is not clear about the exact username/group they are looking for,\u00a0 this avoids scrolling down until the right user is found.

Workaround\r\n\r\nThere are three possible workarounds. Each of them will resolve the issue independently so only one needs to be used:\r\n * In Crowd, enable cache for the affected uncached directory. It's done by checking\u00a0*Cache enabled*\u00a0checkbox in the config page of the directory\r\n * Switch to communication over LDAP in place of LDAPS. It's configurable in the config page of the directory. The external LDAP service needs to accept unsecured connections. One should be aware that switching to LDAP decreases the security of the communication.\r\n * Disable\u00a0*Use paged results*\u00a0for the affected directory. This can be done in the config page of the directory. Although, it's not always an option. Some LDAP servers limit the maximum number of results per query. This can be observed in i.e. MS AD which can limit the number of results to 999. This means that for example if there are more than 999 groups coming from MS AD then some groups will be missing.",

Expected Results\r\n\r\nThere should be no errors in the logs out of the box and OpenID should work fine.\r\nh3.
