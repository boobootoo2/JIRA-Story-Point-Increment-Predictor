If I search for this add-on in the Marketplace, I see that a significantly newer version is available (6.14.0). However, there is no indication in the JIRA add-on manager that an update is available, even though my version of JIRA supports this version of the HipChat for JIRA add-on.\nI'm wondering what the appropriate procedure is for obtaining the latest version. Do I just download the add-on and install in manually? Or is there something I need to do to get the add-on manager to recognize that an update is available?\n\nThis is what I meant by installing manually - I'm aware that I could use that method. My question was more along the lines of: is there a reason why the UPM is not recognizing that an update to the HipChat add-on is available?\n\nIs it the intended procedure that I update manually? Or should the UPM see that an update is available?\n\nhttps://answers.atlassian.com/questions/13411651/how-do-i-get-the-latest-version-of-the-hipchat-for-jira-add-on",

Problem\nCurrently with the User Picker field on a custom field, you can Configure the field to be restricted to a certain group. This does seem to be an overall change, so you won't be able to use the field in more than one project with different sets of users.\n\nh4. Solution\nCreate permission schemes per project and allow to choose which scheme to use on each project.\n\nh4. Example\nProject A uses group Users A\nProject B users group Users B\n\nWhen selecting from that field, you only want to be able to select from Users A or B, depending on which project is using the custom field.\n\nh4. Currently\nRequired that you create a new custom field for each project and specify the group there.",

This could have various undesirable effects as has been reported in other bug reports e.g. duplication of issue creation, endless logging about the failed attempts etc.\n\nUsually the workaround is to manually remove the problematic emails, but this is sometimes inconvenient, as the problem could go on for a long time or over an entire weekend before someone is able to manually intervene.\n\nPerhaps we could device a better handling for this kind of emails e.g. set a limit to the amount of times JIRA would re-attempt to process a specific email, and ignore that email after these number of failed attempts or take some other action to prevent the endless loop.",
