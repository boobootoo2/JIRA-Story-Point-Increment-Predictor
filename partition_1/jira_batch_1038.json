In a situation where there are more than 25 results that match the string provided in the search, the desired result may not be returned.\r\n\r\nh3. How to reproduce\r\n # Create multiple custom fields that contain the same word\r\n ** In the test performed, more than 25 custom fields had the word *Status* in their name\r\n # Open a filter in the *List view*\r\n # Click *Columns*\r\n # Search for the field you're looking to add\r\n\r\nh3. Expected result\r\n * It would be expected that at least the field that matched *exactly* the string provided would be returned\r\n\r\nh3. Actual result\r\n * Only 25 results are returned, but not necessarily the one you're expecting to see. Because there is no pagination, the desired result may not be reachable\r\n  !Screen Shot 2018-12-20 at 6.54.35 PM.png|thumbnail! \r\n * In the example above, there were more than 25 custom fields named *<something> Status*. The field to be added was the system field *Status*, but because of this behavior, it was not possible to add it as a column, as it is not returned by the search.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround:\r\n* Using [PUT - Add Filter Columns|https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/v3/api-group-filters/#api-rest-api-3-filter-id-columns-put] endpoint, it is possible to set the columns of a filter you own. \r\n\r\nBelow, an example of how this request can be executed using *cURL*. In this example, the updated filter would have the columns *Issue Key, Summary, Assignee and Status* set\r\n{code}\r\ncurl -D- -u <emailAddress>:<apiToken> -X PUT -d columns=issuekey -d columns=summary -d columns=assignee -d columns=status https://<instance>.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/filter/{filterId}/columns\r\n{code}\r\n * For custom fields, specify its IDs in the format *customfield_\\{id\\}* (i.e. customfield_10000)",
