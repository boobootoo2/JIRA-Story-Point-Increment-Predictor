      "description": "There is a bug in JIRA 2.4.1, where the hsqldb database bundled with the Standalone distribution gets occasionally restarted in memory, as queries come and go.  This can potentially result in data loss.  Gory technical details to follow.\n\nThis issue arose in 2.4 when we had to switch from commons-dbcp 1.0 to JOTM (it being transaction-aware - and transactions being forced on us by an Ofbiz upgrade..). JOTM uses xapool, which expires open connections after a default period of 10 minutes.  Thus, despite the minimum size of the pool being 2, these connections would expire and close after 10 minutes.  When the last connection closed, the hsqldb Database object finds itself with no Java References pointing to it, so is marked for garbage collection.\n\nHowever!  The shutdown-and-clean-up logic for hsqldb's Database object is in a finalize() method, so it is not executed immediately the last connection is closed.  If the JVM is lazy about garbage collection, then an unused Database object could be in a pending-shutdown state for a long time.  If during this time, another request comes in, a *new* Database object is created, which starts writing to the log file.  Then the JVM's garbage collector kicks in, triggering the finalize() method on the old Database object.  Being unaware of the new Database, the old one will go through its shutdown process, which involves optimizing the .script file by rewriting it as a series of INSERTs.  The new (current) Database is now completely inconsistent wrt. the .script file, and data loss results.\n\nThe solution we've implemented in 2.5 is to keep a guardian connection open to hsql, independent of the connection pool.  This stops hsql from ever being restarted and garbage-collected.",

      "description": "When using the CreateOrCommentHandler to create issues from email in a POP box, it is possible for some emails to get 'stuck', so they create a new JIRA issue(s) every time the POPService runs.\n\nThis happens when a user's mail client (here, Lotus Notes) tries to encode the filename field of the Content-Disposition: header, as described at http://www.mhonarc.org/~ehood/MIME/2047/rfc2047.html.  According to:\n\nhttp://java.sun.com/products/javamail/FAQ.html#encodefilename\n\nthis is not MIME-compliant behaviour.  The attachment is saved with the base64-encoded name ('=?UTF-8?B?U291bmR...').  JIRA may throw an exception [1] when trying to parse the header, and on Windows, will throw another exception[2] when trying to save the attachment with an undecoded filename.\n\nA partial workaround has been implemented for 2.5.  The filename is checked to see if it appears to be encoded (begins with '=?'), and if so, is decoded.  This avoids the second exception, but not the first (which I cannot replicate).\n\n[1]\n2003-10-16 06:51:42,125 DEBUG [atlassian.jira.mail.MailQueueImpl] Queued:\n+com.atlassian.jira.mail.IssueMailQueueItem@8ea21d[issue=org.ofbiz.core.entity.GenericValue@e6e42e[id=11392,summary=RE:\n+Seeking a \"Great\" Marketing Partner?,key=CSS-56,created=2003-10-16 06:50:55.078,updated=2003-10-16\n+06:50:55.078,assignee=<null>,reporter=externaluser],remoteUser=externaluser,notificationType=ISSUE_CREATED,template=issuecrea\n+ted.vm,subjectPrefix=Created: ]^M\n2003-10-16 06:51:42,140 DEBUG [service.util.handler.CreateIssueHandler] Issue CSS-56 created^M\n2003-10-16 06:51:42,156 ERROR [service.util.handler.CreateIssueHandler] Could not create issue!^M\njavax.mail.internet.ParseException^M\n    at javax.mail.internet.ParameterList.<init>(ParameterList.java:61)^M\n    at javax.mail.internet.ContentDisposition.<init>(ContentDisposition.java:70)^M\n    at javax.mail.internet.MimeBodyPart.getDisposition(MimeBodyPart.java:827)^M\n    at javax.mail.internet.MimeBodyPart.getDisposition(MimeBodyPart.java:241)^M\n    at\n+com.atlassian.jira.service.util.handler.AbstractMessageHandler.createAttachmentsForMessage(AbstractMessageHandler.java:75)^M\n    at com.atlassian.jira.service.util.handler.CreateIssueHandler.handleMessage(CreateIssueHandler.java:122)^M\n    at com.atlassian.jira.service.util.handler.CreateOrCommentHandler.handleMessage(CreateOrCommentHandler.java:112)^M\n    at com.atlassian.jira.service.services.pop.PopService.run(PopService.java:97)^M\n    at com.atlassian.jira.service.JiraServiceContainer.run(JiraServiceContainer.java:54)^M\n    at com.atlassian.jira.service.ServiceRunner.execute(ServiceRunner.java:53)^M\n    at org.quartz.core.JobRunShell.run(JobRunShell.java:147)^M\n    at org.quartz.simpl.SimpleThreadPool$WorkerThread.run(SimpleThreadPool.java:387)^M\n\n[2]\n2003-10-16 06:53:28,093 ERROR [service.util.handler.AbstractMessageHandler] Exception while creating attachment^M\njava.io.IOException: Could not move (or copy) attachment from d:\\Jira\\Attachments\\CSS\\CSS-57\\tempattach22747dat to\n+d:\\Jira\\Attachments\\CSS\\CSS-57\\10130_=?UTF-8?B?U291bmRXYXZlIGFuZCBOdWNsZXVzIFIxMjYgU2lkZS1ieS1TaWRlIEluc3RhbGxhdGlvbi5kb2M=?=\n+:java.io.FileNotFoundException:\n+d:\\Jira\\Attachments\\CSS\\CSS-57\\10130_=?UTF-8?B?U291bmRXYXZlIGFuZCBOdWNsZXVzIFIxMjYgU2lkZS1ieS1TaWRlIEluc3RhbGxhdGlvbi5kb2M=?=\n+(The filename, directory name, or volume label syntax is incorrect)^M\n",

I listed them here, along with a few other observations.  Let me know if I should split these up into separate issues.\n\n0. I didn't see a way to import \"component\", or custom fields.\n\n1. It wasn't clear to me that I needed to enter a userid in the \"raisedby\" (etc) columns; I discovered this by trial-and-error after entering a full name in there and watching it create a completely new user.\n\n2. What is the \"ReviewMtg\" column?  The sample values of \"4\" and \"8\" don't shed any light on its purpose.\n\n3. No mention was made in the CSV import documentation that you needed to change the projectID on the line below where you specify the location of the CSV file.  It's right there, of course, so maybe I should have seen it, but I didn't.  So after running the import once and seeing everything imported into the wrong database, I was a little confused, and ultimately had to restore the data from a backup.\n\nOh, and it also seemed strange to me to have to enter a database key (e.g. 10020) instead of a project ID (e.g. \"FOO\").  I had to go to the database directly to find the key.\n\nThe docs in question: http://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/docs/v2.4.1/csv_import.html\n\n4. import_csv.jsp threw a JasperException, with the following root cause:\njava.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: 3\n\tat org.apache.jsp.import_csv_jsp._jspService(import_csv_jsp.java:167)\n\n5. It seems like each new created issue generated an e-mail to \"email@email.com\".  Where is it getting that erroneous e-mail address?\n\n6. In Tomcat's stdout.log, it listed each new issue as it was created, but periodically gave me one of these exceptions: 2003-10-06 15:17:46,603 ERROR [atlassian.jira.mail.IssueMailQueueItem]\njava.lang.NullPointerException\n        at com.atlassian.jira.scheme.AbstractSchemeManager.cacheProjectSchemes(AbstractSchemeManager.java:379)\n        at com.atlassian.jira.scheme.AbstractSchemeManager.getSchemes(AbstractSchemeManager.java:95)\n        at com.atlassian.jira.notification.DefaultNotificationSchemeManager.getRecipients(DefaultNotificationSchemeManager.java:83)\n        at com.atlassian.jira.mail.IssueMailQueueItem.send(IssueMailQueueItem.java:99)\n        at com.atlassian.jira.mail.MailQueueImpl.sendBuffer(MailQueueImpl.java:52)\n        at com.atlassian.jira.service.services.mail.MailQueueService.run(MailQueueService.java:25)\n        at com.atlassian.jira.service.JiraServiceContainer.run(JiraServiceContainer.java:54)\n        at com.atlassian.jira.service.ServiceRunner.execute(ServiceRunner.java:53)\n        at org.quartz.core.JobRunShell.run(JobRunShell.java:147)\n        at org.quartz.simpl.SimpleThreadPool$WorkerThread.run(SimpleThreadPool.java:387)\n",
