      "description": "We've had the occassional issue that's been closed with the wrong \"Fixed In\" version against it.  Originally the issue was targetted for one version, but somebody got the urge to fix it sooner and it made it into an earlier version; however, they didn't notice it had the wrong version against it when they resolved the issue.  One side effect of this is the issue doesn't appear in the Changes Log, and even when it does eventually appear it'll be against the wrong version.  So, in the interests of accuracy, I want to change it back to the correct version.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, even with administrator privileges, the only way to do this is to re-open the issue then close it again, which is a bit cumbersome.  It would be nice if this were made more streamlined e.g. by allowing administrators to Edit certain fields even in closed issues (actually, that's about the only field I can think of which would benefit from being able to do this, since you can still add Comments already)",

The developer works on the issue for one day and reports that he has used 8 hours (= one working day) - then Jira tells him that he still has 16 hours left of the estimated time.\nI could ask the development team to report work logged by days - but then they have to remember to log a half days work as 12 hours.\nThis is confusing - I have locally worked on changing the Jira representation so 1w = 5d (workdays) and 1d = 8h (one working day) which definately looks nicer.\n\nWhat I would suggest is a general preference so people can adjust hours/day days/week to make the work log work the way they prefer.",

It's not that I'm losing the HTTP connection and truncating the page as the footer text is still returned after it, with the result that the browser renders it all in the next table cell (and has a large grey rectangle in the remaining area to the right of it).\n\nTrying to sort the table by different columns by clicking on the headings, I found it was being cut off at different points.  In fact, at one point after sorting by summary and paging through to the last page of results, it got cut off before it had even finished the table headings...\n\nIt may just be an environment issue with their installation, but I thought I'd bring it up here too in case it's a more general problem.  A couple of examples of pages which were affected are:\nhttp://jira.werken.com/secure/IssueNavigator.jspa?pid=10030&sorter/field=reporter&component=-1&sorter/order=DESC&reset=true&mode=hide&resolutionIds=-1\nand\nhttp://jira.werken.com/secure/IssueNavigator.jspa?start=40\n(hmm, I notice that one doesn't contain any parameters for project etc. so that one may not work).  If you like, I could attach some screenshots showing the behaviour, too.",

Anything less makes the product useless to us.\n\nPersonally, I will give you any help that you require in fixing this problems, so that we can purchase it. If you need me to try out new builds in my particular environment, then please feel free to e-mail me.\n\nAsking me to 'try 2.0' is not a solution.

Was wondering if Jira 2 would allow you to select\r\nmultiple issue types in a filter (Jira 1 currently just has a drop-down for\r\nissue type) - I'll email you if you want to go to bed!\r\nmike_b_roberts: btw, Jira 2 is going to solve a whole heap of problems round\r\nhere! )\r\nbookmarkman_99: heh - uhm, actually it doesn't yet\r\nmike_b_roberts: , even\r\nbookmarkman_99: but with the new query system, there's no reason it couldn't\r\n\r\nbookmarkman_99: (ie performance degradation would be v. small)\r\nmike_b_roberts: Shall I add it to jira.atlassian?\r\nbookmarkman_99: yep - sounds like a good idea\r\nbookmarkman_99: what sort of problems?\r\nmike_b_roberts: k - cool, thanks.\r\nmike_b_roberts: Custome fields, mostly\r\nmike_b_roberts: We are using Jira for some weird stuff here along the lines\r\nof project management\r\nbookmarkman_99: right - well, I'd really love if you could try out the EAPs\r\nand let me know if the custom fields do what you want\r\nbookmarkman_99: now is the time to chime up for features while the hood is\r\nopen!\r\nmike_b_roberts: e.g. A customer enters an issue for a new *project* they\r\nwant, rather than just a new feature\r\nbookmarkman_99: one issue per project?\r\nmike_b_roberts: I'm gonna try. Loads of things on at the moment. I tried EAP\r\n1 but got hit by the new issues bug, but think that got fixed.\r\nbookmarkman_99: now that is a strange idea \r\nmike_b_roberts: Yeah - we support about 50 different projects in this group\r\n(some of them are *tiny*)\r\nbookmarkman_99: right - yep, fixed - and EAP 2 is even prettier, especially\r\nthe new filtering / issue nav UI is much better\r\nmike_b_roberts: btw, I think you should add 'unpriotitised' as a default\r\npriority and 'story' as a default task type. \r\nbookmarkman_99: hehe default! \r\nbookmarkman_99: now THAT is a good idea\r\nbookmarkman_99: all constants should have a default choice\r\nmike_b_roberts: Default project in 'new issue' would be good too.\r\nbookmarkman_99: well, that's always the last project you 'touched' -\r\nmagicness\r\nmike_b_roberts: Ah, a default default then. \r\nmike_b_roberts: (In case this is their first visit)\r\nbookmarkman_99: but thep riority is currently always the 'middle one'\r\nmike_b_roberts: Ah, OK.\r\nbookmarkman_99: issue type is always the top one\r\nmike_b_roberts: I just being anal. \r\nbookmarkman_99: but defaults is a good idea, I can see people using that -\r\nand we can do it very simply in the UI\r\nmike_b_roberts: (/me downloads EAP 2...)\r\nmike_b_roberts: So when do yo the .Net port?!\r\nbookmarkman_99: the what? \r\nmike_b_roberts: heh\r\nmike_b_roberts: BTW, you know the other download from here the other day?\r\nThats for a team that are trying actually integrating Jira into a projcet\r\nbookmarkman_99: really? wow - how? having any problems?\r\nmike_b_roberts: There was a project needing some specific issue management\r\nbased on some other stuff.\r\nmike_b_roberts: Basically they have a Service grabbing stuff out of an\r\nOracle DB and are creating issues through the API.\r\nmike_b_roberts: Biggest problem they are having is the API itself - I think\r\nthey'd either like more documentation, or to try a SOAP API\r\nbookmarkman_99: ahh ok - well, depending on when their project is due - they\r\nshould use 2, it's a much nicer API \r\nmike_b_roberts: Any chance of a source download?\r\nbookmarkman_99: for 2? Uhm - it's still got a lot of debug / cruft in there\r\nmike_b_roberts: And? \r\nmike_b_roberts: s'ok, I understand if you don't want it let out\r\nmike_b_roberts: A Javadoc dump for the API at least would be useful though\r\nbookmarkman_99: maybe wih release 3 when we get a few more bugs ironed out,\r\nand the email notification stuff done (one of the last 'majors')\r\nmike_b_roberts: Yeah, Jira 'spam' is a bit of an issue here. \r\nbookmarkman_99: hehe, we're fixing that - and in style true to atlassian\r\nform, making it 100x better than anywhere else \r\nbookmarkman_99: (it's seriously funky shit \r\nmike_b_roberts: Joe and Paul H were singing the praises of your CRM App,\r\nbtw. Scott showed them in belgium and they were well impressed\r\nbookmarkman_99: hehe now THAT is some seriously funky shit *g* we have a lot\r\nof 'cool stuff' still to come, don't worry about that \r\nmike_b_roberts: So are you going to sell the CRM stuff?\r\nbookmarkman_99: possibly - it's a much harder 'sale'\r\nmike_b_roberts: yeah, it wouldn't be something we want here, I guess\r\nbookmarkman_99: I think Confluence will be our next 'released' app, and that\r\nyou guys will cream for - it's right up the XP alley\r\nmike_b_roberts: ?\r\nbookmarkman_99: hrm... it's hard to describe, you have to see it - it's like\r\nan online collaborative free form environment, part blog, part wiki - you\r\ncan create new 'spaces' (like a wiki in itself) rapidly and bring other\r\ngroup members in to collaborate in them. \r\nmike_b_roberts: Ah, OK. I tried snip-snap - it didn't pass the 10 minute\r\ntest for me\r\nbookmarkman_99: of course you can let outside people just 'view' - I think\r\nit will be really good for companies to document a software process, manage\r\nprojects, share information with customers / clients\r\nbookmarkman_99: why's that? it's pretty cool\r\nbookmarkman_99: of course - it will be integrate with JIRA (two way)\r\nmike_b_roberts: Seemed over complex to me. I love moin moin coz its so\r\nsimple\r\nbookmarkman_99: moin moin is simpler? in which way?\r\nmike_b_roberts: You click 'edit' and type.  Can't remember now. Chris and\r\nwere looking at it - perhaps we were just having one of those days...\r\nbookmarkman_99: right - well, I'll make sure to keep simplicity high on the\r\nlist (it always is)\r\nmike_b_roberts: (/me creates a project)\r\nmike_b_roberts: oooooh - nice bew project admin browser. \r\nbookmarkman_99: yah, much cleaner\r\nbookmarkman_99: and you no longer lose your navigation if you have lots of\r\nversions / components\r\nmike_b_roberts: btw, we *really* need to eb able to assign 'per-project\r\nadmins' here\r\nbookmarkman_99: yah, it's on the 2 list\r\nbookmarkman_99: anyway, I'm crashing but I'll leave this on - feel free to\r\ndump any thoughts, worries, UI improvements (checkout the new issue nav,\r\nshared filters etc - I still think it's not 'quite' right even if it's much\r\nmore obvious than the last one)\r\nbookmarkman_99: to this window or email \r\nmike_b_roberts: I still reckon the version boxes look a bit ugly compared\r\nwith everythin else (on 'new issue page 2')\r\nbookmarkman_99: the fix / affects versions select boxes? hard to make them\r\nprettier\r\nmike_b_roberts: Yeah. I reckon it should highlight 'none' and 'unknown'\r\nmaybe. And if there aren't any released versions in the project, there\r\nshould be the 'Released versions' line in the box\r\nbookmarkman_99: right - maybe, all good little tweaks - keep 'em coming, I'm\r\nbailing - nite mate (or morning \r\nmike_b_roberts: heh - see ya\r\n\r\nSo, here's what else I thought of. :) Just my thoughts, so when I say\r\n'should', its just my opinion, right?! :) And its a bit verbose, but\r\nhopefully it will be representative of my immediate emotions. Which is\r\nimportant when you're selling this thing?!\r\n\r\nThat whole version thing - the affected and fix for should look more similar\r\nto each other, affected version should also have 'unknown' at the top, and\r\nboth boxes should have 'unknown' highlighted by default. Most users (here at\r\nleast) don't care about versions. We can always figure that out later\r\nanyway, and they just get confused.\r\n\r\nWhile I think about it, component is the same. As a user, I don't know\r\nnecassarily how your components work. Perhaps change 'none' to 'unknown', or\r\nat least highlight 'none'.\r\n\r\nAlso, if my project doesn't have versions and/or components, I don't care\r\nabout them on the new issue screen, so why not either (a) don't show them or\r\n(b) show them disabled? Helps with the whole '10 minute test'\r\n\r\nEnvironment should be below 'description'. We hardly every use it. :)\r\n\r\nPerhaps, in fact, you should split page 2 - Page 2a is the mandatory fields,\r\nyou then have 2 submit buttons, one takes you to page 2b where you can add\r\noptional fields, and the other just creates the issue there and then. I'd\r\nlike that a lot.\r\n\r\nOooh, how about rich text box for description?\r\n\r\nOK, created my issue - nice new issue page! :) Ah, but my status is just a\r\ngrey box with a dot in it - that ain't intuitive!\r\n\r\nApart from that, it looks nice! Getting rid of all those buttons was a good\r\nidea. While I think of it - watching. Here's a story: 'As a user I want to\r\nbe able to configure my profile such that I can choose whether I\r\nautomatically watch issues or not when I create them' and 'As a Jira\r\nadministrator, I want to be able to be able to configure a default behaviour\r\nfor [the previous story] when a user hasn't specified a preference'\r\n\r\nBUG! Tried to create another issue - this time I left the component as\r\n'None', and its giving me a big pink bar saying 'Component IDs cannot be\r\nless than zero'.\r\n\r\nAnother bug - When I browse the project, only 'No component' is listed on\r\nthe left hand side of the 'open issues' page, yet the 2 issues I created are\r\nboth in a specified component, so when I click the component link nothing\r\nappears. (My extracted XML is at the end of this email)\r\n\r\nAnother bug - extract xml is hanging when I want to extract to browser\r\nrather than file.\r\n\r\nSo now to the new 'Find Issues stuff'. First thing - I hadn't set up\r\nindexing, so I went and did that, then hit 'find issues' again, but got the\r\nsame page ... because it was cached. We get this a lot - is there anything\r\nmore you could do to stop IE caching?\r\n\r\nAgain, the 'fix for' box problem. I really don't like the whole\r\n'sub-listing' thing in the select box. There has to be a better way.\r\n\r\nWhy is 'Edit' and 'New' a different pane on the tab, when effectively they\r\nare the same thing? It doesn't seem to fit when the other things on the tab\r\n('View' and 'All') are so different.\r\n\r\nGenerally - I like having more filter fields in terms of power, but this\r\nscreen is getting increasing difficult for new users to comprehend. Any\r\nchance we can break this up a bit?\r\n\r\nBug! 'Reported by' set to 'Any User', clicked 'View >>', got message 'Could\r\nnot find username: asdas' ! When I clicked something else, then back to Any\r\nUser, and view again, this went away.\r\n\r\nRight, so I've got a list of issues now, and status is a little sqaure with\r\na dot it in again - what gives?\r\n\r\nAlso, priority column is so narrow, all the title says is 'Pr' - is this a\r\nfeature?\r\n\r\nOK, I'm going to save this filter now (that's a lot nicer than V1) - the\r\nsubmit button says 'Save As' - I think 'Save' is fine. 'Save as' implies (to\r\nme) that another dialog is going to appear. And sure enough, you're using\r\n'Save as' for a rename option on the 'view' tab' (which makes sense)\r\n\r\nSo I'm viewing the filter now, and I get more columns. Any reason why you\r\nhave more columns here?\r\n\r\nI click a column to re-order and I get 'Modified since loading' as a message\r\n- what does that mean? The data changed? Ah, I see, I have a 'Save' link now\r\nso it means the filter specification has changed (I reordered), which means\r\nyou are saving sort orders. Nice. But not obvious. :) Are we going to get\r\ncolumn picking? And can you add an option to generate a URL for any given\r\nfilter (so I can link to reports from an intranet site)?\r\n\r\nLooking at 'Manage fiilters' - this is a private filter, so we can't share\r\nyet?\r\n\r\nSo back to the Issue view page.\r\n\r\nBug! I click 'Watch it' and get 'Issue does not exist'. I haven't got SMTP\r\nturned on - is this the problem? And if I have SMTP turned off should I even\r\nhave that option? (which brings into to play a whole 'service-dependent UI\r\noptions' thing which we better not go near! :) )\r\n\r\nOK, lets go play with custom fields. Mmmm - I can add 'Select lists' . Very\r\nnice! :) And you have default options! :D Why are 'Edit' and 'Edit options'\r\ndifferent pages?\r\n\r\nOther things - moving issues between projects would be good.\r\n\r\nOK, I need to go and do some work now. Overall, there's a load of good new\r\nthings in Jira 2, but I've come across a few bugs. I look forward to trying\r\nout later versions! \r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nMike\r\n",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-1012].\n  {panel}\n\nA few suggestions that I think would improve JIRA from a general project management perspective (and I think they are probably easy to implement to boot).\r\n\r\n1.  A 'estimated close date' or 'due date' field for issues (I think this may already be on the list).  Would allow for some basic over/under schedule type metrics.\r\n\r\n2.  'target date' and 'release date' tracking on versions (again simple scheduling metrics).\r\n\r\n3.  It would be very useful to be able to attach documents to the project itself, not only to issues.  Often a project has high level documents (project charter, licensing docs, coding conventions, etc) that need to be in a highly visible, easily accessible location.  Creating bogus issues to attach then to doesn't work so well (out of sight, out of mind).  It would be great to be able to attach them directly to a project and have them listed on the main project detail screen.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nJoe",

Your input in the comments helps us understand how this affects you and what you're hoping to accomplish with JIRA.\r\n\r\nThis suggestion is a priority for the JIRA development team, but I am not able to provide an accurate estimate for when this will be resolved. We will update this issue as soon as we can confidently project a release.\r\n\r\nPlease remember that jira.atlassian.com is one of many inputs for the JIRA roadmap. You can [learn more about our process here|https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/110373/how-does-the-jira-team-use-jira-atlassian-com].\r\n\r\nI understand that our decision may be disappointing. Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nDave Meyer\r\n[dmeyer@atlassian.com|mailto:dmeyer@atlassian.com]\r\nProduct Manager, JIRA Platform\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\nSome of our project members are rumbling about having to assign issues, when on some of the other projects this is important.  It seems this (along with some other options, such as mailing and voting) would make more sense as an option on the project rather than on the whole server.",
