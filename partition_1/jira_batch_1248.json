[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-31673].\n  {panel}\n\nHere's the context: I had a PM leave and another take his place - I wanted to rename the user so he could just take over.  Alas, you can't do that, but that's another issue.\n\nInstead, It appears I must take the cumbersome path of creating a new issue and transfer all of the data from one user to another. The Operations offered on the Admin User pane allow for Deleting, but when I choose that, it says I cannot, because they have issues assigned them.  After searching through the help, I discover that Atlassian \"strongly recommends deactivating the user instead of deleting it since deleting a user may cause database integrity problems.\"  Deactivating?  First I've heard of that.\n\nMy question: Why would you put an action that you _strongly_ recommend against on the common operations list for Users??  If you want people to deactivate, put Deactivate on that list instead, instead of making people wade through your help to discover that that feature even exists.\n\nPS - I so wish I didn't run into head-slapping issues like this every time I use Jira.  How many years has this product been actively developed?",

If I view an issue I can see a list of issues that has a direct blocks/blocked by relationship with the one I'm viewing. What I can't see is issues that have an indirect link, you have to click from issue to issue memorising the state (which gets difficult when an issue is blocked by multiple other issues). \n\nFor example if ISSUE-1 blocks ISSUE-2 blocks ISSUE-3 then viewing ISSUE-1 says \"blocks ISSUE-2\", viewing ISSUE-2 says \"is blocked by ISSUE-1 and blocks ISSUE-3\" and viewing ISSUE-3 says \"is blocked by ISSUE-2\".\n\nInstead it would be useful to be able to see a list of indirect issues blocking/blocked by the one being viewed. Ideally this could be presented as a diagram as that would be much quicker to use.\n\nPerhaps other kinds of relationships could be displayed on this graph, but this will likely not be as useful for them.\n\nOther specification/bug trackers such as [Launchpad|https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/hardware-q-kernel-config-review#deptree] and bugzilla has both a [text tree view|https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/showdependencytree.cgi?id=12282] and a [graph view|https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/showdependencygraph.cgi?id=12282]",

Most of the use cases described here are based on the desire to run arbitrary scripts in JIRA Cloud. Unfortunately, for security and performance reasons, this is something that we absolutely cannot support.\n\nWe have made significant investments in JIRA webhooks and the JIRA REST API in order to support executing the exact same actions remotely. Since we introduced [Atlassian Connect|http://connect.atlassian.com] in March 2013, *this is the recommended integration architecture for Atlassian's Cloud applications*. We have introduced a number of new REST API resources, with more coming in JIRA 7.0. There is also a new [admin UI for administering and registering webhooks|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Managing+Webhooks].\n\nPlease remember that jira.atlassian.com is one of many inputs for the JIRA roadmap. You can [learn more about our process here|https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/110373/how-does-the-jira-team-use-jira-atlassian-com].\n \nI understand that our decision may be disappointing. Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.\n \nRegards,\nDave Meyer\n[dmeyer@atlassian.com|mailto:dmeyer@atlassian.com]\nProduct Manager, JIRA Platform\n{panel}\n\nMany customers would like to implement an auto-close function similar to the one implemented on support.atlassian.com, but the one implemented by Atlassian requires the use of Jelly scripts, which are rightly banned from Cloud Applications as they have the potential to cause havoc or even allow a malicious user to perform a privilege escalation. However, the same function could be implemented by using Listeners to trigger a function, (such as the one in the bundled JIRA Toolkit plugin), so this feature request is to consider whether permitting any Listener functionality would be possible for Cloud Applications instances.",

One re-index is triggered by the standard JIRA import process that the OnDemand import process wraps, then, as described in JRA-31473, several re-indexes are triggered by upgrade tasks.\n\nAll of these re-indexes are ultimately pointless, because a re-index is triggered explicitly at the end of the OnDemand import anyway.\n\nWe should look into the feasibility of disabling all re-indexing at the beginning of the OnDemand import process (so that re-index request become no-ops), and re-enabling it only at the very end of the process for the final request.",
