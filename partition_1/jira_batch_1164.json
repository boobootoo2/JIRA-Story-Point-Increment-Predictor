Summary\n\nWhen editing tickets within JIRA, screen readers e.g., JAWS are unable to read the page correctly.\n\nh3. Environment\nJIRA v7.2.0-OD-05-023 \n\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\nOpen an existing ticket\nClick the Edit button\n\nh3. Expected Results\nJAWS should be able to render the entire page including the modal\n\n\nh3. Actual Results\nJAWS is only able to render the page title\n \nh3. Notes\nLooking at the page code, when clicking the Edit button, there is a JavaScript event firing that applies a hidden tag to the page. It appears this was done to confine focus to the modal window. It appears however that the modal window is hidden from view as well. Removing the ARIA tag, which is hidden, from the page DIV, it should fix the issue.\n\nh3.Workaround\nNo known work around for this",

Adding a new context\n\nAdding a new context allows you to configure a custom field differently for different combinations of issue types and projects.\n\n*To add a new context:*\n# Navigate to the Custom Fields page, locate the desired custom field and choose cog icon > Configure.\n# Click the Add new context link. The 'Add configuration scheme context' page will be displayed (see below).\n#* Under 'Add configuration scheme context', enter a 'Label' and 'Description' for your new context \u2014 these are used for administrative purposes only and will not be shown to your end-users.\n#* Under 'Choose applicable issue types', select the issue type(s) to which you want this Default Value and Options to apply. You can select Any issue types if you wish.\n#* Under 'Choose applicable contexts', select the project(s) to which you want this Default Value and Options to apply. Note that this will apply to only issues with the selected issue type(s) as above.\n\nA custom field can only have one context per JIRA project. So you cannot have multiple contexts for different issue types in the same project.\n{quote}\nSource: [Configuring a Custom Field|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Configuring+a+Custom+Field]\n\nThis leaves room for a lot of questions on how contexts work and what happens after a new context is created for an existing field (e.g. when there are existing issues with populated values).\n\nWe need to clarify that even if the options from the Default Configuration are the same as the ones used in a context, once a context is created, the old values will be rendered obsolete / read only.\n\nRelated bugs and docs:\n* [JRA-33026|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRA-33026] - Additional configuration context caused missing value for field with optionid\n* [Change Context for an Existing Custom Field Without Losing Old Data|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRAKB/Change+Context+for+an+Existing+Custom+Field+Without+Losing+Old+Data]",

For use-cases where there is need to achieve the same for mail handlers meant to create new issues, JIRA doesn't provide an out of the box way to strip content occurring after a designated marker e.g. a regex pattern, excepted for quoted content.\n\nh3. Suggested Solution\nProvide a Issue Creation mail handler that can be configured to strip not just quoted email body, but content occurring after a designated marker or seperator as well.\n\nh3.

Expected Behavior\nFully support all operands provided by SimpleDateFormat in Java 8.\n[http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html]\n\nh3. Actual Behavior\nThe {{u}} operand cannot be parsed, even though it's accepted as valid. In the logs, we can see an {{InvalidArgumentException}}.\n\n{noformat}\n2016-04-05 12:56:15,382 http-nio-8710-exec-8 ERROR admin 776x101x1 1u66v39 0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1 / [c.a.j.plugin.navigation.HeaderFooterRendering] Unable to include web panel in context 'atl.header.after.scripts' from class 'com.atlassian.plugin.web.descriptors.DefaultWebPanelModuleDescriptor.ContextAwareWebPanel' because of 'java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Illegal pattern component: u'\n{noformat}\n\n{quote}\nh5. Suggested theory\n\nTomcat 8 is bundled since JIRA 7, and we are only supporting Java 8 on these versions. However, Tomcat 8 uses the Servlet 3.1 API, which is part of Java EE 7. [SimpleDateFormat on Java 7|http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html] has {{E}} for day of week names and {{F}} for day of week numbers.\n\n[SimpleDateFormat on Java 8|http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html] changed some operands, including the replacement of {{F}} with {{u}}, so JIRA will not accept the input of {{F}} as an operand when setting up date formats, but will take {{u}}.\n\nWhen trying to parse the header and footer of the page (see error above), JIRA takes a {{HttpServletRequest}} object, which is a class from the Servlet 3.1 API. This obviously leads to an inconsistency, where a Java 7-based class cannot understand the {{u}} operand when parsing the date.\n{quote}\n\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\nUnder *Administration > System > Look and feel*, setup any date format to use {{u}} as one of the operands.\n\nh3. Workaround\nAs of now, there's no guaranteed workaround other than opting for other operand (such as {{E}}, parsing to the name of the weekday), supported by SimpleDateFormat on both Java 7 and 8.\n\nIn case the setting is applied, it may be necessary to revert it through the database. You can use the below query to reset the format to the default.\n\n{code:sql}\nUPDATE propertystring SET propertyvalue='dd/MMM/yy' WHERE id IN (SELECT id FROM propertyentry WHERE property_key = 'jira.lf.date.dmy');\n{code}",

This would also allow them to Bulk change tickets for projects they shouldn't be administrating but have permission to edit single tickets.\n\nh3. Suggested Solution\n- to use the current Bulk Edit interface (in Issue Navigator) but only display the Bulk Edit option if you have Bulk Edit permission to all projects contained in your search result\n- another option would be to enable it or when the project filter is selected & you filtered on projects where you have Bulk edit rights only.

When I type in a value like is after -1d, the syntax is immediately auto converted to a static date value such as March 31, 2016.  This means that I will have to update the activity stream every day to continue to get comments from just the last day. \n\nMy team documents the work they plan to do each day on the JIRA  each morning and documents progress updates throughout.  The activity stream makes it easier for local and global peers of the development team to monitor planned work, accomplished work, and unplanned work.  Today we work around this bug by streaming the last 5 updates for users without regard to update date.  We only do 5 so as to prevent seeing too many results from previous days.  However, this also forces us to click the 'more' button repeatedly to consume the previous day activity.\n\nThis seems to relate to https://ecosystem.atlassian.net/browse/STRM-1804.",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-60386].\n  {panel}\n\nThe current Project Categories functionality is way too broad of a feature.  It completely overlooks those using modified agile workflows or non-agile workflow such as in JIRA Core.  Also, it fails to handle the possibility that a single status could be used in 2 different projects at 2 completely different locations in a workflow.  Not to mention that it could possibly be used as 2 separate purposes within the same project in 2 different workflows on 2 different issue types.  The possibility that the same status is used as a ending state (done) and an In Progress state in the same project is very slim, but i've actually seen it before.\n\nFor example, I have seen a status called \"Verified\" which in one workflow was used as the final complete state (Done).  However, on a different issue type in the same project it was used as a middle state in the workflow where \"Closed\" was used as the Done state.  Now, on the global Status level, which category do you assign to the \"Verified\" state?\n\nAnother example is when a single workflow transitions an issue to multiple different job roles.  Therefore, based on the state of the workflow it may be in person1's queue and they have their own To Do, In Progress, Done statuses, but when it is in Done for person1, then it moves to person2's To Do queue where they also have their own In Progress and Done states.  However, with the global category setting, it turns out that both person1's and person2's statuses all end up being \"In Progress\" and therefore are all colored yellow.  Have you ever seen a dashboard with this new category system in this use case?  Every single status on the entire dashboard is yellow.  How is that beneficial to the user?\n\nThe current implementation also falls short on the UI of the statuses, Please return these status names in the UI to Camel Case because all caps is harder to read.  Human eyes are conditioned to read characters in Camel Case and therefore these words are easier to identify at a single glance.  ALL CAPS ARE TOUGH TO READ BECAUSE EACH CHARACTER IS THE SAME HEIGHT AND THEREFORE THE BRAIN NEEDS TO READ EACH CHARACTER SEPARATELY IN ORDER TO DETERMINE THE WORDS.  This is just something that will allow users to be able to quickly identify the status by name since the vast majority, if not all, statuses will be in a yellow state.\n\nWith the Categories, you have gone backwards in the ability to quickly identify a status and it's meaning.\n\nOn other issues it has been mentioned that the new categories was put in place in order to assist with the new Project Release board which shows the current fix version and a \"pretty\" blue, yellow, green bar to show the progress of that version.  Since this seems to be the only reason to implement project categories, it just doesn't make sense to do so on the global level.  For the same reasons as above, the project categories could be incorrectly colored for one project, but be correct for another.  Therefore, the Release board is only useful for 1 of those 2 projects.  Therefore, if you want to keep the Release board around, you should shift the category assignments to statuses down to at least the project level if not the project/issue type level.\n\nIn summary, the status categories need to be removed or altered to better suit ALL possible uses of JIRA.  Atlassian is making a big push with JIRA Core, JIRA Software, and JIRA Service Desk to make JIRA appealing to all different types of uses, but this functionality goes against that drive and actually hinders it.  Please make a change.",

Problem Definition\nWhen JIRA has a significant number of Custom Fields, over 100, it becomes difficult to find/reuse a custom field.  This can causes duplicate Custom Fields to be created by different JIRA admin since an exhaustive search is close to impossible.\n\nh3. Suggested Solution\nA simple solution would be to allow the name and type column to be selected and then the contents columns will be put in alphabetical order.\n\nAnother solution would be to have a multiple selection field where you could select one or a couple of custom fileld types at a time.\n \nh3.

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-60326].\r\n{panel}\r\nh3. Problem Definition\r\n\r\nCurrently JIRA has a new REST API call for user properties. However, the documentation is not clear on the specifics of this call as explained by the dev in the below 2 comments to linked issues:\r\n # JRACLOUD-45502:\r\n{quote}The user properties that can be set via the user profile page and the user properties exposed in the JIRA REST API are actually two completely different storage mechanisms, which explains why user properties set from EditUserProperties.jspa are not returned when you call the REST API.\r\n\r\nThe new user properties in the REST API are intended to be used by remote integrations and add-ons to store per-user data and settings. This helps add-ons provide a customized experience for each JIRA user while keeping all the data in the JIRA Cloud instance's database. These properties are generally intended to be used by add-ons. We do not plan to build a UI to create and set properties \u2013 you are more than welcome to use them, but to retrieve user properties using a GET request on /rest/api/2/user/properties, they must be set with a PUT to /rest/api/2/user/properties/\\{propertyKey}.\r\n\r\nWe absolutely recognize the confusion that having two different sets of user properties can cause, and we intend to rectify this in the future.\r\n{quote}\r\n # JRACLOUD-59760:\r\n{quote}There is a\u00a0[free add-on for JIRA Cloud|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.atlassian.connect.entity-property-tool.prod/cloud/overview]\u00a0that provides the ability to edit user entity properties, which are\u00a0[accessible via the user entity properties REST API discussed on this issue|https://docs.atlassian.com/jira/REST/cloud/#api/2/user/properties].\u00a0\r\n\r\nWe know that one of the most common use cases for user properties is workflow automation. For that reason, add-ons like the new\u00a0[JIRA Misc Workflow Extensions add-on for JIRA Cloud|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.innovalog.jmwe.jira-misc-workflow-extensions/cloud/overview]\u00a0have also implemented their own user interfaces for setting and managing user properties.\r\n\r\nThe reason we are not planning to expose a REST API for the legacy user preferences/properties that are currently not accessible via REST is that we are making a number of changes to how users are stored in Atlassian Cloud as we roll out\u00a0[Atlassian accounts|https://confluence.atlassian.com/purchasing/introducing-atlassian-account-738362254.html]. Unfortunately, migrating legacy user preferences to the new user entity properties available via REST is not straightforward.\r\n{quote}\r\n \u00a0\r\n\r\nTherefore, users would be attempting to access properties of users created via UI using REST API and also will expect to access properties created via REST API from the UI. However, this is an intended behavior as explained in the above tickets.\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nPlease update the doc to clarify the rest call as explained by the dev",

This screen has no fields, so in JIRA the result is a transition with a screen that only holds the comment field. The 'Reject' transition has a validator that requires a comment filled in.\n\nWhen a bulk transition of 'Reject' is used, JIRA does not see that a screen is attached (I guess it can't see the difference between an empty screen and no screen at all).\n\nResult is that we can not give any comments and therefor the validation failed. So no bulk transitions is possible for this transition:\n\n !image-2016-03-23-11-48-12-447.png|thumbnail! ",
