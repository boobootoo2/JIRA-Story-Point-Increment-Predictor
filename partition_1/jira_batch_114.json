      "description": "First issue...\r\n\r\nI set up a remote account to GitHub using OAuth and SSH. I created a new SSH key and enabled the checkbox to allow SourceTree to modify my SSH configuration.\r\n\r\nWhen I attempted to Clone a repo, the clone window opened but there was an Error message of \"{color:#ff0000}This is not a valid source path / URL{color}\". Clicking on the message shows the connection log with the following.\r\n\r\n{{/Users/USERNAME/.ssh/config: line 97: Bad configuration option: usekeychain}}\r\n {{/Users/USERNAME/.ssh/config: terminating, 1 bad configuration options}}\r\n {{fatal: Could not read from remote repository.}}{{Please make sure you have the correct access rights and the repository exists.}}\r\n\r\n{{I opened /Users/USERNAME/.ssh/config file and found the following new entry}}\r\n {{# \u2014 SourceTree Generated ---}}\r\n {{Host InsomniacSoftware-GitHub}}\r\n {{\u00a0 HostName github.com}}\r\n {{\u00a0 User InsomniacSoftware}}\r\n {{\u00a0 PreferredAuthentications publickey}}\r\n {{\u00a0 IdentityFile /Users/USERNAME/.ssh/InsomniacSoftware-GitHub}}\r\n {{\u00a0 UseKeychain yes}}\r\n {{\u00a0 AddKeysToAgent yes}}\r\n {{# ----------------------------}}\r\n\r\nCommented out the UseKeychain line and saved. Back in SourceTree, clicked on the Clone link and it successfully logged into GitHub.\r\n\r\nAfter some testing, I discovered the error is due to using a non-Apple version of ssh that doesn't support the UseKeychain option. I have installed OpenSSH_7.5p1 (OpenSSL 1.0.2l 25 May 2017) via Homebrew at /usr/local/bin/ssh. This is the version SourceTree is using since it is the first in $PATH.\r\n\r\nTo make it work with either version of ssh, at the top of the ~/.ssh/config file, add the following lines\r\n\r\n{{Host *}}\r\n\r\n{{\u00a0 IgnoreUnknown UseKeychain}}\r\n\r\nThis will cause non-Apple versions of ssh to ignore the UseKeychain option.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nSecond issue...\r\n\r\nMy system-wide ssh config file enables StrictHostKeyChecking by default (enforced by IT/Security department). SourceTree is unable to connect (Permission denied (publickey)) unless I create a 'Host github.com' entry in my personal ssh config file that disables StrictHostKeyChecking or points to a Known Hosts file that already contains github.com's public key.\r\n\r\nNote: Adding these options to the SourceTree-Generated lines does not work as ssh isn't actually using those options (Host doesn't match, User should always be git, etc). \u00a0SRCTREE-4631 discusses this a bit.\r\n\r\nSo that a user doesn't have to create a 'Host github.com' entry, SourceTree should always call git with the GIT_SSH_COMMAND variable setting these options, like this.\r\n\r\n{{GIT_SSH_COMMAND=\"ssh -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o IdentityFile=/Users/USERNAME/.ssh/STGENERATEDKEY\" git clone git@github.com ...}}\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nNow for the request.\r\n\r\nWhen I was setting up the GitHub account, the SSH Key line was showing the default id_rsa.pub key. Clicking on the Copy To Clipboard button would bring up the Generate SSH Key dialog. The (i) icon said to hold down Option key to generate a new key but the Generate SSH Key dialog would appear whether I was holding down Option or not, so it couldn't use my id_rsa key either. I generated a new SSH key which SourceTree saved as InsomniacSoftware-GitHub[.pub].\r\n\r\nHowever, I already have a SSH key uploaded to GitHub that I'm using for other git applications, which is different from the default id_rsa.pub key. Unfortunately there is no way in the dialog window to tell SourceTree to select a different key.\r\n\r\nRequest: Allow the user to pick an existing key instead of forcing them to generate a new key.\r\n\r\n\u00a0",
