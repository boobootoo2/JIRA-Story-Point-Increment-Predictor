After consideration, we are closing this issue because we do not expect to address it in the foreseeable future. As is clear from the examples below, the ideal propagated action depends on the type of issue link and varies depending on your use case. Considering issue links can be arbitrarily defined, this would require adding logic in JIRA to handle certain types of links differently from others. Alternatively, we would need to add settings to configure propagated actions based on the issue links.\r\n\r\nOur belief is that the value doees not justify the expected increase in UI complexity or maintenance burden.\r\n\r\nAs always, please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nDave Meyer\r\nProduct Manager, JIRA Platform\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen an issue is linked as solved by or set as duplicate do a cascading update when resolving the issue that solves the duplicate.",

From JIRA 6.1 we are only going to support customised project keys that meet all of the conditions specified below:\r\n# The first character is a letter from the [Modern Roman Alphabet|http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_alphabet#Modern_alphabet]\r\n# The first and all consecutive letter characters are in upper case\r\n# Only letters, numbers or the underscore character is used\r\n\r\nWe understand that some customers may be in the position where their current project keys do not meet the above requirements. We want to help these customers migrate to a supported format. To do this, we will implement this highly-voted feature request to allow the editing of project keys. We have started work on this and we aim to complete it for the JIRA 6.1 release. Given that it is very early in the release cycle we can not guarantee this and we will keep everyone updated via this issue.\r\n\r\nFor customers that cannot wait until the 6.1 release, the current recommended workaround is to create a new project and use Bulk Move to transfer issues over from the old project to the new project. This has the additional benefit of providing redirection from the old issue key to the new issue key if anyone has an external reference to it. We realize that there is still manual work involved with moving components and versions and other project configuration.\r\n\r\nThanks for your patience and we hope you appreciate our open approach to feature requests.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nBartek\r\nJIRA Product Management\r\nbartek (at) atlassian (dot) com\r\n{panel}\r\n*Original request description:*\r\n\r\nI had cause to rename a whole series of projects recently, however I could see no way to modify the key for a project, so the issue-numbers now make little sense compared to the name.\r\n\r\nWould be nice to change the key to a non-used key and see them all updated.",
