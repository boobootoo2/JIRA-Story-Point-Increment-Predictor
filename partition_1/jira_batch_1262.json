[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-29038].\n  {panel}\n\nAs a subcontractor for DirecTV, we interact with JIRA many times per day.  Here are some suggestions for improvements, which are supported by DirecTV:\n\n1. It's annoying that sub-tasks can't have sub-tasks.  Sub-tasks of sub-tasks should be allowed.  Further, there should be a list in tasks (and sub-tasks) showing what sub-tasks they have.\n\n2. When email goes to jirahddvr@directv.com, with a recognizable ticket in the subject, JIRA forwards the email to the assignee for the ticket.  Helpfully, it checks to see if the assignee is the same as the sender of the email, and in that case, it does not forward the email.  It should also check the Cc: list of the email to see if the assignee is on the list, and in that case it should also not forward the email.\n\n3. JIRA believes that two issues can be linked as \"is related to\", \"is related by\", \"duplicates\", or \"is duplicated by\".  There is no semantic difference between \"is related to\" and \"is related by\" because \"is related to\" is a symmetric relation (and so is \"duplicates\").  JIRA should get rid of \"is related by\" and \"is duplicated by\".                                       -- George\n",

Here the issue object *has* a parentId set (because it was probably explicitly set by the webwork action or issue service)\n* It then triggers an update of this issue by adding a label. At some stage during this process we must lookup the issue again by ID and then dispatch the issue updated event.  Now we haven't run the doPostCreationTask() method yet which establishes the parent/child link in the DB.  The IssueImpl looks up the parentId via this parent/child link however and so now that we've looked up the issue via DB but we don't have the link yet the parentId comes back as null.   \n* Finally the doPostCreationTask() method runs in CreateSubTaskIssueDetails which establishes the parent/child issue link.  *now* if we retrieved the issue again from the db it would have a parent ID set but at this stage it's too late.\n\n{quote}\n\nWe will need this to be fixed, as GreenHopper (amongst others) definitely makes use of listeners to synchronise Version and Component hierarchy, and this prevents 3rd party developers from using this feature in combination with the own listeners that want to work with subtasks and their parents.\n\nHaving said that though, it's not urgent as the workaround would be to not run two separate listeners like this (not run a hierarchy in GH, and disable those listeners).",

Unfortunately we don't seem to have any documentation on it and it's a bit confusing about what the functionality does and does not do.\n\nSo far, based from the case I worked on and JRA-24213 it seems to be able to:\n* Migrate *all users* from JIRA Internal to Delegated LDAP.\n* Migrate *all users* from Delegated LDAP to JIRA Internal.\n* Migrate *all users* from Delegated LDAP to Delegated LDAP.\n\nIt does not support (requested in JRA-27868):\n\n* Migrating a specific set of users from one directory to another.\n* \"Connector\" User Directories - so direct to the LDAP Server (e.g.: Active Directory).\n* Migrating groups only.\n\nIt seems to have the following features:\n* If you, the currently logged in user, are in the directory to be migrated from, your user data will not be migrated.\n* Users and groups will not be migrated if they already exist in the target directory. For example, if {{dcurrie}} exists in JIRA Internal and JIRA Delegated LDAP, yet has different groups in JIRA Internal, when migrating from one to the other, that user will be skipped an the groups will not be migrated.\n\nAnd of note:\n* Project Roles are not affected as they do not seem to be user directory specific (unlike groups).\n\nThis originally derived from JRA-24213 and now has a subsequent issue to add more functionality to the feature, JRA-27868.\n\nCan you please add some documentation for this feature?

However, some are common enough that you should be able to catch and display a properly formatted message to the user. Our database server went down recently\u2014and while we are tracking down the cause for it, JIRA should have handled the situation better. There are two different behaviors for a downed database, depending on whether JIRA was running at the time or not.\n\nIf JIRA was already running when the database goes down:\n\nWe get a stack trace of your code with a final exception saying it can't connect to the database.\n\nIf JIRA is also shut down, but started before the database is ready:\n\nJIRA writes it's .lock file\nWe get a generic Tomcat Error screen with no information, no stacktrace, nothing.\nWhen you shut the JIRA service back down, the .lock file remains\n\nWhat I would like to see, at least for when the database is down:\n\nA similar page to the case when there is an existing .lock file, but this time telling the user that the database can't be connected to.\nProper cleanup of the .lock file when the service is shut down.",

Your input in the comments helps us understand how this affects you and what you're hoping to accomplish with JIRA.\n\nAt this time, this suggestion is not on the JIRA development roadmap. Please remember that jira.atlassian.com is one of many inputs for the JIRA roadmap. You can [learn more about our process here|https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/110373/how-does-the-jira-team-use-jira-atlassian-com].\n\nI understand that our decision may be disappointing. Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.\n\nRegards,\nDave Meyer\n[dmeyer@atlassian.com|mailto:dmeyer@atlassian.com]\nProduct Manager, JIRA Platform\n{panel}\n\nI understand that there are limitations to logging based on log4j and in Tomcat but it is a pain for an Administrator, and for Atlassian support engineers to work with massive logfiles. JIRA should ship with a logging system which has log rotation enabled by default for more than just instance restarts.\n\nh3. Workaround\nChoose one them:\n* Options to rotate the {{catalina.out}} and detailed steps for using logrotate are documented at [How to Rotate the Catalina Log File|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRAKB/How+to+Rotate+the+Catalina+Log+File].\n* Increase logging level for {{console}} loggers to _WARN_ and restart JIRA, see diff:\n{code:borderStyle=solid}\ndiff -u ./atlassian-jira-6.4.13-standalone//atlassian-jira/WEB-INF/classes/log4j.properties  ./log4j.properties\n--- ./atlassian-jira-6.4.13-standalone//atlassian-jira/WEB-INF/classes/log4j.properties\t2016-02-25 06:10:30.000000000 +0100\n+++ ./log4j.properties \t2016-09-26 15:51:16.000000000 +0200\n@@ -28,12 +28,12 @@\n #####################################################\n\n log4j.appender.console=org.apache.log4j.ConsoleAppender\n-log4j.appender.console.Threshold=DEBUG\n+log4j.appender.console.Threshold=WARN\n log4j.appender.console.layout=org.apache.log4j.PatternLayout\n log4j.appender.console.layout.ConversionPattern=%d %t %p %X{jira.username} %X{jira.request.id} %X{jira.request.assession.id} %X{jira.request.ipaddr} %X{jira.request.url} [%c{4}] %m%n\n\n log4j.appender.nowarnconsole=org.apache.log4j.ConsoleAppender\n-log4j.appender.nowarnconsole.Threshold=DEBUG\n+log4j.appender.nowarnconsole.Threshold=WARN\n log4j.appender.nowarnconsole.layout=org.apache.log4j.PatternLayout\n log4j.appender.nowarnconsole.layout.ConversionPattern=%d %t %p %X{jira.username} %X{jira.request.id} %X{jira.request.assession.id} %X{jira.request.ipaddr} %X{jira.request.url} [%c{4}] %m%n\n{code}\n* Remove all {{console}} from log specific logging events, see examples\n{code:borderStyle=solid}\n-log4j.logger.com.atlassian = WARN, console, filelog\n+log4j.logger.com.atlassian = WARN,  filelog\n log4j.additivity.com.atlassian = false\n{code}\nsed code:\n{code:borderStyle=solid}\nsed '230,$s/console,//' ./log4j.properties > ./log4j.properties_new\n{code}\n",

Date fields appearing in notification emails do not honor the user's time zone preference but instead show the server local time.  Please extend time zone support to the entire product.\n\n---\n\nEmails use the interface of {{NavigableField}} to render the changed values in emails. Specifically, they are given {{GenericValue}} objects for ChildChangeItem entries, which are rendered via {{VelocityHelper#getPrettyFieldString}}, which will call out to the {{Field}}'s equivalent method.\n\nHere's the rub: \n# The changelog values are only strings. They don't have type data, so we don't know whether we're dealing with a value that needs parsing or not.\n# The NavigableField rendering methods only accepts an i18nHelper object, but not a locale or timezone value. \n# NavigableField is a Public API, so it's possible people are implementing and extending this.\n\nThese three things combined mean that, at present, we have no real means of parsing the values for a user's timezone.\n\nTo add time zone support in emails, we need to address the more fundamental problems listed above.",

As per a customer's comment:\n\n{quote}\nyou should probably have users clear out the old indexes as it prevented Jira from being accessible after the initial upgrade using the .bin file to upgrade. Then one should immediately upgrade plugins, then re-index. \n{quote}\n\nCheers,\nMatheus Fernandes",
