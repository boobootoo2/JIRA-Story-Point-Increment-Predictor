This is because he is now trying to login with a lowercase username. If the user is smart he will see that the mail with the new password also lists his username and that this is in uppercase. If he then tries to login with his username in uppercase and the new password, he is shown this message: \"You do not have the permissions required to browse any projects.\" (Just like in the JRA-2349 issue).\n\nThe only solution for the user now is to do like the hacker and request a new password (just this time by writing his username in lowercase). Now his username is changed back to lowercase. When he now tries to login with his new password and his lowercase username it works fine.\n\nAn interesting side effect is that now it is not possible to login with an uppercase username anymore like in JRA-2349. It is still possible though to change the username back to uppercase again with the method described above.\n\nBTW: This bug is close related to JRA-2349.

Our company is looking into transitioning into it.\n\nIt should also be more friendly to JIRA, since log messages are stored per commit (and not per commit x every file); so an email-comment system like the current CVS mails would work much better (a single comment instead of tens of them); also the CVS integration in 2.6 would be much lighter due to the decreased log size (see issue JRA-3183)\n\nSince Subversion interface has been kept close to CVS, my guess it's that shouldn't be too hard to implement suppport for it based on the current support for CVS.",

Also, if they've changed the navigator layout, they want that to appear in Excel.\n\nWhat Jira seems to be offering by this link is a way to get the entire issue into Excel - more like \"download full content to Excel\".  I can see that might be useful - but the other case is more useful.

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-3286].\n  {panel}\n\nThe feature \"timetracking\", which activated the 'developer workload report' is already a nice feature for basic logging of work.\n\nThe estimation of work could be used for project management to check estimated workload of developer, re-assign tasks/improvements for future versions to reduce over-all time needed to finish a future version etc.\nCurrently it's very difficult to check the man-power resources and there workload.\n\nI'd like to suggest some enhancements to make this more usable for the project management:\n\n1. Allow ProjectManager to check estimated Workload of all developer\n\nDevelopers sometimes work for more than one project simultaneously.\nThe developer workload report already takes this into account by reporting the workload of the developer over all projects.  From the point of a developer, the \"workload report\" is fine, but from the point of a project manager it's difficult because she needs to generate the report for every developer.\nWould be much easier when report is created for all project and for all developer.  This could be a bit tricky with permissions, well, right.  But for project manager it would be perfect to get a table like this (JRA and OTHER are projects):\n\nDeveloper       Workload-JRA  Workload-OTHER\n--------------------------------------------\nMartin Skopp              8h        1w 2d 3h\nScott Farquhar          120h             20h\nOwen Fellows             48h             35h\n\nSee also JRA-3111 for another idea how to improve the report.\n\n\n2. Adding \"Versions\" for Workload report\nAddtionally to 1., I would appreciate to get a Workload for single project over all developers and versions, e.g.\n\nWorkload report for Project JIRA (JRA):\nDeveloper              2.6.1             2.7\n--------------------------------------------\nMartin Skopp              8h        1w 2d 3h (x)\nScott Farquhar          120h (y)         20h\nOwen Fellows            4,5d (z)         35h\n\nOptionally, it would be nice to allow the user to select the unit for the work, e.g. standard, like (x) or in hours (y) or in days (z).\n\n\n3. Add date/time field to Log Work on issues \nSometimes, I forget to log my work on a issue and want to log my work the next day.  No problem, this is possible, but the date of the worklog entry is created by JIRA.  I would appreciate that the reporter can soecify a start date of the worklog.  This would allow the forgetful developers like me to create more accurate worklog entries.\n\n\n4. The worklog entries could be used by project management to monitor progress within a new version.\nThe problem is that there are no reports available for project management to check which work has been done e.g. during the last week or days.  Yeah, one can filter all issues which changed within the last days, but a real \"worklog report\" or filtering on worklog entries would be very nice.\nE.g.:\nFilter properties: \nProject = JRA\nVersion = 2.6.1\nWorklogs = -1w to 0 (=relative date one week ago up to today)\n\nResult: all worklog entries (not the issues!) which match.\n\n\n5. Worklog entries do not appear in filter results!  This makes it really difficult for project management to monitor work logs (well it's possible via notification, right).\nSo it would be great if optionally display of worklog entries could be enabled in a filter result somehow.\nMaybe this is obsoleted by 4. already...\n\n\nSo that's it!  The basic feature request is \"make it more easy for project manager to check estimated workload and development success\".\nFor any more questions etc. please do not hesitate to contact me.\nThanks for reading this long issue.\n\nP.S.: I really love JIRA, really.\n\nMartin Skopp\nskopp@riege.com",

In addition to change notification emails, they had in their client app an \"inbox\" that was a list of all the subscribed bugs that had changed. After reviewing one, you could delete it from the inbox, and it would only show up again if it changed again.\r\n\r\nThe difference between this and an email notify or RSS solution is that Tracker would not create a new entry when a bug that was already in the inbox had changed - it would update the existing one.\r\n\r\nThe issue I'm trying to address here is when I review bug change notifications in my email inbox. I will frequently see five changes to the same bug - a comment, another comment, someone started work on it, then assigned it, etc. So I can't see the list of all changes at once for a particular issue.\r\n\r\nFeature request: provide a \"bug inbox\" like I've described above that runs via the JIRA web interface.

Entities like:\n1) Current Assignee\n2) Current Reporter\n3) Project Lead\n\nwould help.\n\nIt would also make JIRA more powerful if a group could be set up so that  it would be allowed users to join that group automatically. I can see a useful use-case of such feature: \n\nLet's say I have a project Foo and I set up a group Foo Watchers that will be in the notifications scheme for project Foo, receiving alerts from changes in Foo. Anybody who wants to watch the project Foo as a whole will join this group on their own (without the necessity of Project Admin's involvement) and begin watching all issues in that project rather than having to manually turn on watching for each issue.\n\n\nthank you",
