An user would automatically be _deleted_ but _then restored_ in any successive synchronisation from any provider (LDAP, Crowd, etc.), if the username matches.\r\n\r\n2.7 changed this behaviour by making the user deletion strict and irreversible. Creating an user with the same username as a deleted user does not restore the old user. However this has caused a lot of headaches for the support team as any migration between the authentication providers are now permanent and does not restore the old users after migration.\r\n\r\nA solution for this is to restore the undocumented behaviour of 2.6 and prior versions: restore any user matching a deleted user with the same username.",

The option can also be enabled when the number of requested files in a single multiple-print operation places too much load on the p4d server, leading to timeouts and excessive index times (see https://support.atlassian.com/browse/FSH-7863) \r\n\r\nChange the \"disable multiple print\" option to be a selectable dropdown of the batch size for files per p4 operation. A size of 1 is the equivalent of the old \"disable multiple print\" functionality, but the customer can also configure other batch sizes to balance the number of p4 client executions against the number of files requested per execution.\r\n\r\n",

Workaround\r\nh4. Option #1\r\n\r\nUse an\u00a0[SMTP proxy|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMTP_proxy]. Examples:\r\n* https://github.com/kz26/mailproxy\r\n* https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/mail-proxy/mail-proxy/\r\n\r\nh4. Option #2\r\n\r\nConfigure mail library using system properties. Steps:\r\n\r\n1. Create a {{javamail.address.map}} file in the {{JAVA_HOME/lib}} directory. Content of the file should be as follows. This file will switch default email protocol from smtp to smtps:\r\n\r\n{noformat}\r\nrfc822=smtps\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\n(!) Keep in mind that this will affect all Java applications running on this machine. In case Fisheye/Crucible is not the only one, consider installing another, dedicated JRE for Fisheye/Crucible with this file present.\r\n\r\n2. Set the following JVM properties in FISHEYE_OPTS \r\n\r\n{noformat}\r\n-Dmail.smtp.ssl.enable=true -Dmail.smtps.auth=true -Dmail.smtps.host=smtp.gmail.com -Dmail.smtps.port=465\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\n* mail.smtp.ssl.enable - this will enable SMTPS instead of StartTLS\r\n* mail.smtps.auth - to require authentication for SMTPS\r\n* mail.smtps.host / mail.smtps.port - values from the 'Administration > Server > Mail server' page will be ignored when SMTPS is enabled, therefore you have to provide them using these flags; use your server address and port, the example above works with GMail\r\n\r\nYou may also want to add the following ones:\r\n\r\n{noformat}\r\n-Dmail.debug=true -Dmail.smtp.ssl.protocols=TLSv1.2\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\n* mail.debug - extra debug logging for troubleshooting\r\n* mail.smtp.ssl.protocols=TLSv1.2  - restrict protocol to TLS v 1.2\r\n\r\n3. Configure other mail settings on the 'Administration > Server > Mail server > Edit config' page\r\n\r\n* Use TLS/SSL = set to false, as you will be connecting via SMTPS, not StartTLS\r\n* Username / Password = put credentials\r\n\r\n",

      "description": "When {{DefaultUserManager}} is being instantiated by Spring, the constructor calls {{upgradeData()}}, which calls {{removeDeletedAdminGroups()}}.\r\n\r\n{{removeDeletedAdminGroups()}} calls {{getExternalGroupNames()}}, which calls {{listGroupNames()}} to retrieve all the groups defined in Crowd if it's configured to use Crowd.\r\n\r\nThis method calls the {{listGroupNames}} method on {{CrowdAuth}}. If Crowd is not up at that time, the {{CrowdClient}} throws an {{InvalidCrowdServiceException}}, which is rethrown as an {{AuthenticationException}}.\r\n\r\n{{listGroupNames}} method on {{DefaultUserManager}} swallows any exception thrown by {{CrowdAuth}} (though it logs it as an error) and return an empty list.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, {{removeDeletedAdminGroups()}} method then assumes
