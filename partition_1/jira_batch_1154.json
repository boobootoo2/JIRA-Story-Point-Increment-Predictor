Summary\n\nIn case that JIRA is integrated with external directories, remember-me token should be ignored when users managed in the directories log in JIRA at least.\nThe root need is that users can still log in after an administrator forces a password change (due to the remember-me token).\n\nh3. Environment\n * JIRA 7.2.0\n * Crowd 2.9.1\n\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\n # Integrate JIRA with Crowd\n # Log in JIRA with a user (User A) and then, check \"Remember my login on this computer\"\n # Restart the browser\n # Access JIRA with the same browser\n\nh3. Expected Results\n\nJIRA should show login page and need User A to input the credentials\nh3. Actual Results\n\nUser A could log in without any authentication.\nh3. Notes\n * The above actual results might cause some troubles in the following scenario{panel}_In case that there are some password leakages, an admin of the external directories wants the users to update their passwords immediately._\n # In the past, User A logged in JIRA with checking \"Remember my login on this computer\"\n # An admin of Crowd notices that a password of User A was leaked\n # The admin access Crowd, open user setting page of User A and set an attribute called \"requiresPasswordChange\" as \"true\" (It would require User A to update the password when the next login.)\n # In spite of the above setting, User A can log in JIRA without updating the password{panel}\n* Confluence, Bitbucket Server and Bamboo behave as well at this moment\n\nh3. Workaround\n\nDisabling remember-me token is only the workaround.",

There are five types of\nsecurity within JIRA:\n1. Global permissions\n<https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiracloud/managing-global-permissions-776636359.html>\n-\nthese apply to JIRA as a whole (e.g. who can log in).\n2. Project permissions\n<http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Managing+Project+Permissions>\norganised into permission schemes, these apply to projects as a whole\n(e.g. who can see the project's issues ('Browse' permission), create, edit\nand assign them).\n3. Issue security levels\n<http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Configuring+Issue-level+Security>-\norganised into security schemes, these allow the visibility of individual\nissues to be adjusted, within the bounds of the project's permissions.\n4. Comment visibility\n<http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Commenting+on+an+Issue> -\nallows the visibility of individual comments (within an issue) to be\nrestricted.\n5. Work-log visibility\n<http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Logging+Work+on+an+Issue> -\nallows the visibility of individual work-log entries (within an issue) to\nbe restricted. Does not restrict visibility of progress bar on issue time\ntracking.\nDifferent Projects, Different Permissions\nPermission schemes allow you to apply varying access levels to combinations\nof groups, roles and individuals on a per-project basis. A permission\nscheme will enable/disable specific actions for users for that project. For\nexample, the 'Browse Project' permission for a particular project restricts\nwho can view the project in JIRA and thus view issues that belong to that\nproject via the Issue Navigator. Without this permission, user(s) would not\nbe able to access ('browse') that project.\nYou could have permission schemes applied per project that give certain\ncustomer groups or roles access only to the project (via the 'Browse\nProject' permission) that pertains to them, while giving the internal\ngroups or roles all permissions across multiple projects. See Managing\nProject Permissions <http://confluence.atlassian.com/x/ZAISCw> for further\ndetails.\nReusable Permission Schemes: Using Project Roles (default and recommended)\nEach project has Project Roles associated with it: Project Lead,\nAdministrators, Developers, and Users. As you define your Permission\nScheme, you can assign permissions in your Permission Scheme to a Project\nRole (e.g. Project Role (Users)). When you select the Permission Scheme for\na project, JIRA will grant the permissions specified in the scheme to the\nspecific users/groups that you've defined in the Project Roles for your\nproject.\nThis allows you to reuse the same Permission Scheme for different projects\nthat have the same security needs, but different groups. You then select\nthe same Permission Scheme for the Project, but Manage Project Role\nMembership\n<http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Managing+Project+Role+Membership>\nto substitute different users/groups. Sharing a Permission Scheme also\nfacilitates the creation of Administrator groups across the projects\n[image: View page Icon]\n<https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRAKB/JIRA+Permissions+General+Overview?src=mail&src.mail.timestamp=1472570448441&src.mail.notification=com.atlassian.confluence.plugins.confluence-content-notifications-plugin%3Apage-edited-notification&src.mail.recipient=ff8081813fe690d5013fe88f358c016e&src.mail.action=view>\nView\npage\n<https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRAKB/JIRA+Permissions+General+Overview?src=mail&src.mail.timestamp=1472570448441&src.mail.notification=com.atlassian.confluence.plugins.confluence-content-notifications-plugin%3Apage-edited-notification&src.mail.recipient=ff8081813fe690d5013fe88f358c016e&src.mail.action=view>\n\u2022\n[image: Add comment Icon]\n<https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRAKB/JIRA+Permissions+General+Overview?showComments=true&showCommentArea=true&src=mail&src.mail.timestamp=1472570448441&src.mail.notification=com.atlassian.confluence.plugins.confluence-content-notifications-plugin%3Apage-edited-notification&src.mail.recipient=ff8081813fe690d5013fe88f358c016e&src.mail.action=comment#addcomment>\nAdd\ncomment\n<https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRAKB/JIRA+Permissions+General+Overview?showComments=true&showCommentArea=true&src=mail&src.mail.timestamp=1472570448441&src.mail.notification=com.atlassian.confluence.plugins.confluence-content-notifications-plugin%3Apage-edited-notification&src.mail.recipient=ff8081813fe690d5013fe88f358c016e&src.mail.action=comment#addcomment>\n\u2022\n[image: Like Icon]\n<https://confluence.atlassian.com/plugins/likes/like.action?contentId=625902332&src=mail&src.mail.timestamp=1472570448441&src.mail.notification=com.atlassian.confluence.plugins.confluence-content-notifications-plugin%3Apage-edited-notification&src.mail.recipient=ff8081813fe690d5013fe88f358c016e&src.mail.action=like&jwt=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJ4c3JmOmZmODA4MTgxM2ZlNjkwZDUwMTNmZTg4ZjM1OGMwMTZlIiwicXNoIjoiZTViMjFmODA1OTM4YjgxNjgwMGE4YmFlNmQxNjIyMzFkNzk5OGZmNzZhZTUyMTFmZWI0YzZiNDNlODFlYzAwZSIsImlzcyI6ImNvbmZsdWVuY2Vfbm90aWZpY2F0aW9uc0FHNk0tWjdJVC1ZRVNKLThXRVgiLCJleHAiOjE0NzMxNzUyNDgsImlhdCI6MTQ3MjU3MDQ0OH0.Gpxzcu3q7cc_oYBNZuu45A-NvsTYPqe9uBJutFQviHs>\nLike\n<https://confluence.atlassian.com/plugins/likes/like.action?contentId=625902332&src=mail&src.mail.timestamp=1472570448441&src.mail.notification=com.atlassian.confluence.plugins.confluence-content-notifications-plugin%3Apage-edited-notification&src.mail.recipient=ff8081813fe690d5013fe88f358c016e&src.mail.action=like&jwt=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJ4c3JmOmZmODA4MTgxM2ZlNjkwZDUwMTNmZTg4ZjM1OGMwMTZlIiwicXNoIjoiZTViMjFmODA1OTM4YjgxNjgwMGE4YmFlNmQxNjIyMzFkNzk5OGZmNzZhZTUyMTFmZWI0YzZiNDNlODFlYzAwZSIsImlzcyI6ImNvbmZsdWVuY2Vfbm90aWZpY2F0aW9uc0FHNk0tWjdJVC1ZRVNKLThXRVgiLCJleHAiOjE0NzMxNzUyNDgsImlhdCI6MTQ3MjU3MDQ0OH0.Gpxzcu3q7cc_oYBNZuu45A-NvsTYPqe9uBJutFQviHs>\nStop watching space\n<https://confluence.atlassian.com/users/removespacenotification.action?spaceKey=JIRAKB&src=mail&src.mail.timestamp=1472570448441&src.mail.notification=com.atlassian.confluence.plugins.confluence-content-notifications-plugin%3Apage-edited-notification&src.mail.recipient=ff8081813fe690d5013fe88f358c016e&src.mail.action=stop-watching&jwt=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJ4c3JmOmZmODA4MTgxM2ZlNjkwZDUwMTNmZTg4ZjM1OGMwMTZlIiwicXNoIjoiMTI4MWQ1MzdiYmM4NjRhMGNlOWY3NzQ1MWMxMTcyNTkyYTAyZGQwMTQyY2M2NWYzNWYzZmE2YzYxMTdjMzBhZiIsImlzcyI6ImNvbmZsdWVuY2Vfbm90aWZpY2F0aW9uc0FHNk0tWjdJVC1ZRVNKLThXRVgiLCJleHAiOjE0NzMxNzUyNDgsImlhdCI6MTQ3MjU3MDQ0OH0.PiM_dEzMSIZMsCrVP0yPFHhCSFimKuqCYCoBLSwHQec>\n\u2022\nManage notifications\n<https://confluence.atlassian.com/users/editmyemailsettings.action?src=mail&src.mail.timestamp=1472570448441&src.mail.notification=com.atlassian.confluence.plugins.confluence-content-notifications-plugin%3Apage-edited-notification&src.mail.recipient=ff8081813fe690d5013fe88f358c016e&src.mail.action=manage>\nThis message was sent by Atlassian Confluence 5.9.12 (node1: d6e9a79a)",

Problem Definition\nCustomers would like the ability within the Issue Navigator of JIRA to display the timestamp for date fields such as Created date.\u00a0\u00a0 Natively there is not a supported way to accomplish this within JIRA.\u00a0 However there was a KB article created over at [Showing Extended Timestamp in the Created Column of the Issue Navigator|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRAKB/Showing+Extended+Timestamp+in+the+Created+Column+of+the+Issue+Navigator], that explained a means to customize the file 'date-columnview.vm' directly to accomplish this.\n\nThe problem now is that those instructions no longer valid to JIRA 7.x versions.\u00a0\u00a0 Those instructions only appear to work for JIRA 6.4.x and before.\u00a0 Presumably the code changes in JIRA 7 altered the way in which these .vm files are used to render the issue navigator results page.\n\n\nh3. Suggested Solution\nAllow JIRA administrators to customize the view of this issue navigator to include timestamps\nOR\nProvide an alternative work-around that might explain how this could be customized on a JIRA 7.x platform.",

Summary\n\nWhen a saved filter contains a project, which JQL has the project name or project key, and a user that don't have permission to view this project access this filter, the project name/key in the filter change to its database ID to all users accessing this filter. This breaks many functionalities that depend on this filter, like dashboard gadgets and also the the list of boards that appear under a project. \n\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\n # Create a filter containing a project (or some projects), like project in (ABC, XYZ)\n # Save this filter sharing it publicly\n # Set another user to have permission to view projects ABC and XYZ\n # With this user click Issues > View all filters and search by the saved filter on #2 and open it\n # Set a third user not to have permission in one of the projects (ABC or XYZ)\n # With this third user click Issues > View all filters and search by the saved filter on #2 and open it\n # With the second user refresh the page showing the filter\n\nh3. Expected Results\n\nThe filter shouldn't change the project name/key to ID for the users that have permission to view all projects in the filter\nh3. Actual Results\n\nThe filter changes from project name/key to the project's database ID even for the users that have permission to view all projects in the filter\nh3. Notes\n\nThis does not update the database entries for the filters. Restarting the JIRA Application will refresh the filter data back to the project names, temporarily until the filter is accessed again by someone without permissions.\nh3. Workaround\n\nShare the filter only with groups/users that have permission to view the projects in the filter",

Actual Results\n\nNo email is received for this comment.\n\nThere is nothing written in the\u00a0atlassian-jira-outgoing-mail.log\nh3. Notes\nAs a user, a comment added during a transition or on the view issues screen directly, is the same. They appear the same way on the issue. So, they should be treated the same way too.\n\nh3.

In that case the roadmap should have counted remaining activity as four not five more over task and sub task are not issues as per the JIRA definition of issue\n\nSo proposal is roadmap should not say remaining issues instead it should say remaining activity and it should not count count the task whenever there are subtask is attached to it\n{quote}",

Summary\n\nCurrently, the issue collector delivers a fragment of HTML/JS to embed in the client website that interacts with JIRA via a URL that encodes state in it. \n\nFollowing on, the client browser will cache the content and a (potentially) outdated resource will be used by the client browser when JIRA or its plugins are upgraded. \n\nThis is worsened by the fact that products such as Confluence, Portfolio and Stash are hardcoding these URLs (currently pointing to JAC) in the actual source of these products and are basically using these URLs as \"API\" :(\n\nh3. Steps to Reproduce.\n\n1. Create an issue collector in JIRA.\n2. Get the html fragment for the issue collector and embed it into a html page.\n3. Visit the the html page and use the collector so that the browser caches the content.\n4. Make a change to JIRA source such that the content delivered for the URL included in the html fragment provided by the collector is different.\n5. Restart JIRA.\n6. Visit the external html page and try to use the collector again.\n\nh3. Actual Results\n* The content retrieved from the URL by the embedded collector is out of date and does not reflect the changes done in step 4.\n\nh3. Expected Results\n* The content retrieved from the URL by the embedded collector is up to date and reflects the changes done in step 4.\n\nh3. Workaround\n\nClear the browser cache to obtain the new content.",

By default, this isn't possible, so the user may proceed to configure the following formats in JIRA's *Administration >> System >> Advanced Settings*:\n * jira.date.time.picker.java.format\n ** Add 'z' to the format\n * jira.date.time.picker.javascript.format\n ** Add '%Z' to the format\n\n!Timezone_Format.png|width=194,height=35,thumbnail!\n\nThis does allow the timezone to be shown in issue view and in the issue navigator for example. However, when the changes above are done and the Calendar selector is used to specify the custom field's value, the calendar cannot add the timezone on it's own and the user must manually type in the timezone.\n\n!Calendar_No_Timezone.png|thumbnail!\nh3.

Summary\nCurrently, it is not possible for a user to keep a field from being visible until a certain part of the workflow if that field has a default value. Some users might want a field to appear later in the workflow of an issue but might want it to have a default value when appearing on a custom screen for users. For that field to be visible however, it has to be included in the 'View Issue' operation. Since the field will already have a value set, it will always be present, even if the field does not yet apply.\n\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\n# Set a default value for a field\n# Create a custom screen for a workflow operation in the life of a ticket, and add this field to that screen\n# Add the field to the view issue screen\n# That field will appear from the creation of the ticket and will stay as long as a value is in place. This might not suite a user's needs if the user wants the field to apply to the custom screen in the workflow but not be present until then.\n\nh3. Expected Results\n\nh3. Actual Results\nThe field is set to the default value but only appears once applicable (using a custom screen for a workflow operation).\n\nh3. Notes\nThe field will always be present.\n\nh3.Workaround\nUsing a post function to SET the value after a workflow operation would work, but in the above scenario, a user would want the default value to be present in the screen so the field could be modified or changed before completing the operation.",

Our workflow is such that after a feature is completed on our side, it goes for customer acceptance and testing -- areas over which we have no control.  The release burndown assumes a status of \"resolved/done\" to show any data and while that works in many cases, it would be nice to specify per burndown which status is \"done\" for your team.  This gives everyone the chance to use this functionality as features flow from team to team.\n\nI ran into this issue as well when fixing production defects that were reported by the customer.  The customer is the one who could say they were \"done\" that would take them months sometimes.  However, development and QA were done with them almost right away and to track SLAs we needed to associate \"resolved\" with different statuses which was not possible with JIRA.\n\nNot sure if we are not using the software correctly or there is a better way but frequently features and defects originate outside the development team, are fixed/developed by DEV, and are finally closed by the reporters.  I think this is a pretty common practice in Professional Service Development Teams and having the ability to report a status as resolved that we specify would make JIRA more powerful for all.",

(Tests were made in cloud environment)\nAlso, this HTML embedded code bed can be used for testing [http://www.csgnetwork.com/htmlcodetest.html]\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\n # Create an issue collector\n # Assign a proper default reporter\n # Create a user limited to access confluence only (must not be allowed to access JIRA and)\n # Log in to JIRA as that user (either logging out and entering that user credentials or using the log \"in as user\" feature)\n # Paste the Issue Collector html code in the test site i.e: [http://www.csgnetwork.com/htmlcodetest.html] and test it.\nh3. Expected Results\n\n\nShould be able to open an issue normally using the collector.\nh3. Actual Results\n\nWhen using the \"log in as user\" feature, it shows the issue collector tab, but won't load (stuck on loading wheel). When entering user credentials in confluence, then trying to test the issue collector, the collector tab won't show.\n\n\\{noformat}\n...\n\\{noformat}\n\u00a0\nh3.
