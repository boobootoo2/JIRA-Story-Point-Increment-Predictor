Problem Definition\nAt this moment, it is possible to see the last login date for users only when the user is coming from internal directory or LDAP. It is not possible to see the last login date when the user is coming from Crowd.\n\nh3. Suggested Solution\nWe need to get the information of last login from Crowd side and add it to the JIRA UI.\n\nh3. Workaround\nIt is possible to get this information from Crowd database by running the following query : \n{noformat}SELECT u.user_name, a.attribute_value as lastlogin FROM cwd_user u JOIN cwd_user_attribute a ON u.id = a.user_id WHERE attribute_name = 'lastAuthenticated' ORDER BY lastlogin DESC;{noformat}\nThe result will be in EPOCH time, you would need to convert it to get the exact date. Every successful login attempt from Crowd user in JIRA, JIRA will update the last login value into Crowd database.",

However, in JIRA 7.2.x, there's no option to disable the sidebar. This is a new feature implemented in JIRA 7.2.x - please refer to [JIRA Core 7.2.x release notes - Projects, front and center|https://confluence.atlassian.com/jiracore/jira-core-7-2-x-release-notes-826896229.html#JIRACore7.2.xreleasenotes-Projects,frontandcenter].\n\nNote that this options is not available for Cloud customers, so it would be nice to have the suggested resolution implemented either way. :)\n\nh3.

The title only identifies the issue by the Issue Key. It would be better to also show the title (summary) of the issue.\n\nThat shortcut is great to make a quick\u00a0workflow\u00a0transition, but we need to be sure that we have the right issue. I\u00a0remember the summary of the issue; but I'm not learning the issues key by heart. For me showing the issue key in the dialog has no benefit; I must rely on the confidence that I have selected the correct issue.\u00a0\n\nTherefore showing a small easily to remember identifieer (i.e. the summary - even if it's just the first X characters of it)) would help a lot.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0",

Summary\n\nSetting an entity property value to a string longer than 255 characters fails returning error 500 if the property type is set to 'string'.\n\nThis is because, as mentioned in below documentation page:\n - [https://developer.atlassian.com/jiradev/jira-platform/building-jira-add-ons/jira-entity-properties-overview]\n\n{quote}\ntext: tokenized before indexing and allows for searching for particular words.\n string: indexed as-is and allows for searching for the exact phrase only.\n{quote}\nIt should be documented than the limit is 255 characters when using the type 'string' and a better error message should be returned in case a bigger value is provided.\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\n # Set the entity property type to 'string'\n # Send a text longer than 255 character as the property value. E.g. I have sent below body in a REST request as described in:\u00a0\n{noformat}\nhttps://docs.atlassian.com/jira/REST/cloud/#api/2/issue/{issueIdOrKey}/properties-setProperty\n{noformat}\n{noformat}\n{  \n   \"cachedItems\":\"[{\\\"id\\\":\\\"57dbe48fc0e1d6f6570ccdca\\\",\\\"summary\\\":\\\"--- template 1\\\",\\\"fixed\\\":false,\\\"order\\\":0,\\\"toggleUser\\\":\\\"Mario Thor\\\",\\\"toggleDate\\\":1474028687137},{\\\"id\\\":\\\"57dbe48fc0e1d6f6570ccdcb\\\",\\\"summary\\\":\\\"abc\\\",\\\"fixed\\\":true,\\\"order\\\":1,\\\"toggleUser\\\":\\\"Mario Thor\\\",\\\"toggleDate\\\":1474028704728}]\"\n}\n{noformat}\n\nh3. Expected Results\n\nEither 200 OK, or a meaningful error message\nh3. Actual Results\n\nYou get Error 500 (internal server error) in the REST response and the below exception is thrown in JIRA logs. \n The same body is accepted without any problem when the type is set to 'text'.\n{noformat}\n2016-09-26 18:26:15.207066500 2016-09-26 18:26:15,194 http-nio-2991-exec-34 ERROR sysadmin 1106x17978x1 ua82jq 193.240.188.96

Problem Definition\nCurrently, when JIRA does the index snapshot, it does not verify if the index files are in a working state. When we recover the index files, it could lead to a situation where we need to rebuild the index by performing a full reindex - this will cause downtime and index recovery suppose to avoid the downtime. This defeats the purpose of the index recovery. \n\nh3. Suggested Solution\nTo have a health checker before taking a snapshot. If the index files are not healthy, warn the System Admin and do not perform the snapshot. With this, the Admin will be able to recover the index files that is in the working state and perform a background reindex.\n",

Problem Definition\nNew Atlassian Connect add-ons create users in the application so they can perform some operations. Some of these operations can trigger notification events.\nFor example the new JIRA Misc Workflow Extensions (JMWE) add-on user sends a notification when a the add-on reassigns the issue to another user by way of a workflow post-function\n\nh3. Suggested Solution\nAs a JIRA admin I'd like to disable notifications from these system users from Atlassian Connect add-ons.\n \nh3. Workaround \nYou could remove the Issue Assigned event from the project notification scheme, but this will stop this kind of notifications from all users, not just system ones.",

Expected Results\n\nThe issues listed on the Bulk Edit match the search from the first tab.\n\nh3. Actual Results\n\nThe issues listed on the Bulk Edit are shown according to the search performed in the second tab.\n \nh3. Notes\nNotice that the issues pulled into the bulk edit screen are the issues from the search in the other tab (although it's limited to the number of issues found on the first tab\n\nh3.Workaround\nCurrently, there's no workaround for that.",

However, the closest I could find were suggesting firing an event on a linked issue.\n\nIt would be great to have a new link type that would allow certain fields to be mirrored between the linked issues. Specifically, I would like to see Comments and Status be mirrored. When a comment is added to one it shows up in the other. When one of the issues is closed the other is closed. I realize the status could get messy if the linked issues have different workflows. As a suggested solution If when an issue is closed, if the workflows/statuses don't align then the user could be presented w/ a 'what do you want to do with the linked issue screen'.\n\nExample use case:\n# A user sends in a request to JIRA Service Desk for a product issue/enhancment\n# The issue is cloned and moved to the development project in JIRA SW\n# The developer works the issue to closure in JIRA SW\n# Today somehow the Agent has to be manually notified to take action on the JSD issue.

For some reason highlight foreground color is white, which is not easy to see as the highlight background color is light gray. The highlight background color looks nice, but the highlight foreground color should then be black for clarity. I have noticed that in some other applications the highlight foreground color is black, too. Someone also said that the highlight foreground color could not be changed.\n\nIn adding link to an issue you can add the link target issue to a text field. The text field is also a search box, which opens a list of issues. In this list the highlight foreground color is black, like it should be.\n\nI see that default highlight background color is blue, which is quite a dark color. But it can be changed. If it is changed to lighter color, you should be able to at least also change the highlight foreground color to black. Why can you only change the highlight background color?\n\nJira v7.1.10.",

Problem Definition\nIn some cases it might be helpful to have JIRA be able to send out notifications to other linked issues, when the main issue is updated/closed/etc.\u00a0 Presently this is not possible within JIRA, as all changes to a single issue only follow the given notification scheme which applies to all issues in that project.\n\n\nFor example, if you have a project called \"ABC\" and there are three issues in the project. In which,\n\nABC-1 (assignee:John) is linked to ABC-2(assignee: Mary) and\nABC-1 (assignee:John) is also linked to ABC-3 (assignee: Paul).\n\nIf ABC-1 issue is updated, John already gets notified as he is the assignee, however it would be nice if there was an option to also notify the assignees of other linked issues such as Mary and Paul.\n\n\nh3. Suggested Solution\nAllow a notification scheme event such as \"Linked issue updated\" to be created in turn fire an alert\n\n\nh3. Workaround \nIt might be possible to use a 3rd party plugin like scriptrunner in order to create a script that would check all existing linked issues when an update was made, and in turn create an edit/update on those issues in order to trigger a notification.\u00a0\u00a0 However this could be tricky since if you have a large environment with lots of issues linked to other issues, in theory you could create a tsunami of email notifications with a single change to one issue (something that could cause severe performance problems, as well as inbox problems).",

Suggested Solution\nI'm not sure if this requires the web links to have a separate field definition from other Issue links within JIRA in order to accomplish, however this would be a nice feature to have for environments that would want to say for example, require a web link exist for an issue to be created.\n\n\nh3.
