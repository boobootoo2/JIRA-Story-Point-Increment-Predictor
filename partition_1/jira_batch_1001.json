I have attached an excerpt of the log file when this occurs. However, JIRA manages to restart and seems to run fine, it just doesn't look too good (nor is too re-assuring) when we get lots of ERROR-statements related to the database storage/back-end.\r\n\r\nMy question is then whether something needs to be done with the configuration of JIRA to prevent this on successive startups, or whether it's possible to handle this more gracefully in later releases of JIRA?\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nTrym",

      "description": "1. If a 'find' returns more than one page of results, those results are split over several pages. \n\n2. If the grouping (the sort column) does not provide sufficient differentiation (eg., many of the issues are of the same priority), the ordering within the sorted group is random.\n\n3. Consequently, when paging from one page to the next, issues are re-ordered and sometime INFORMATION CAN BE LOST because clicking \"Next>>\" will not show you all the issues.\n\nThis happens because the natural ordering of issues is not preserved in between pages. On page 1 of 3, issues might be ordered as such:\n\n400\n430\n576\n320\n\nBut, when I view the second page, this natural ordering changes within the sorted group. If the group does not provide a great deal of order (such as the date), the second page might select this result set:\n\n430\n400\n320\n576\n\nIf the result set is less than one page long, this doesn't matter. But if the result set is longer than a page, the random ordering can mean that some issues never appear while paging through the results, or that some issues appear more than once.\n\n(You can try this by clicking on the \"2.7 Pro\" milestone, which is three pages long, and pay close attention to the order of the results. What is the last item on the first page? Go to the second page. Does that item appear again? Go back to the first page... odds are, it's not at the bottom of the page anymore... it might not even be on the page!).\n\nThis can be solved by adding a secondary sort to all queries. I would suggest sorting by <priority>,<issue#> (in other words, always do a secondary sort on the <issue#>).",

We will update this request when we plan to include it in our roadmap.\r\n\r\nFor those that are unaware, JIRA allows for the default assignee to be the project lead or unassigned. Other than that you can use the component leads to auto-assign issues.\r\n\r\nFor any concerns please contact me directly. Otherwise let's keep the comments on track by indicating your use cases for this feature.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nRoy Krishna\r\nJIRA Product Management\r\nroy at atlassian dot com\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\n\\\\\r\n\r\nI cannot change the default assignee in projects from the administration console.\r\nAssignable users are defined in the permission scheme, but JIRA does not allow me to modify the default assignee, which is defined as the Project Lead by JIRA. I think this is a bug, because by reading some previously submitted issues, it seams that JIRA allows to change the default assignee and select a specific user.\r\n",

I would like to see something much more useful. \r\n\r\nPart of this is because I expect to modify the workflows to encapsulate our business processes to the greatest extent possible by JIRA and what I can con our \"Powers That Be\" into letting me do. \r\n\r\nI would like to be able to assign different work flows to different types of issues. \r\n\r\nFor instance, our feature requests have to be prioritized by a specific committee (at least major feature requests) so the workflow for feature requests will need to go through a workflow that takes it through that committee processes where it will be prioritized and scheduled and so on before being sent to development. \r\n\r\nIn addition each issue type needs to have a diferent set of information. A good example of this is with the current setup. I think that for the most part the environment is not meaningful for new features. If I'm going to have different workflows for each issue type, I'm going to need different data to run those workflows.\r\n\r\nI would also like to have different priority sets for each type of issue. \r\n\r\nI think it would also be useful to establish who can create which types of issue (as a member of the public, I should never be able to create a task, for instance) and also which priorities they are able to set. It possible that I only want certain people to set the priority to certain values (for instance the \"Oh no! Fix this now or the whole company is going into the toilet\" priority should probably only be set by Managers). ",

      "description": "I am passing this on in case the ideas are useful to Atlassian.\n\nThe current custom field code does not scale very well in regards to the issue navigator.  We have over 700 custom fields, and displaying a simple list of issues (i.e. \"Assigned to Me\") was taking too long:\n\n  [4525ms] - /batt/secure/IssueNavigator.jspa\n    [721ms] - IssueNavigator.execute()\n    ...\n    [2781ms] - ColumnLayoutManager.getColumnLayout()\n    ...\n\nAfter researching and understanding the code and making some improvements, we were able to reduce this dramatically:\n\n  [667ms] - /batt/secure/IssueNavigator.jspa\n    [19ms] - IssueNavigator[JiraWebActionSupport].execute()\n    ...\n    [318ms] - IssueNavigator.getColumns()\n    ...\n\nWhat we did was:\n\n1. Improved use of Lucene\n\n   Of the 721ms in IssueNavigator.execute(), approximately \n   690ms was used reopening the index for every query (these\n   numbers are worse if the issues are not in the cache).\n   We implemented an IndexListener interface to send out \n   events whenever the index was refreshed (i.e.\n   IndexManager.reIndexIssues()), and now only reopen the \n   index when it changes.\n\n   For most queries, the commment index is not used, and so\n   we now use the actual Lucene Document object to display\n   search results, instead of querying the database for a\n   GenericEntity.  In order to do this, we changed some of\n   the names of the Fields in the Lucene index to exactly \n   match the entity definition, and then instead of passing\n   a GenericEntity to the JSP, we pass a SearchResult.  The\n   information for the search result is read lazily from the\n   Lucene Hits object (not read until needed).  Sorting is\n   done by Lucene.  If the comment index is used, the code\n   takes the existing path using the database (but note that\n   this is only for user queries - none of the \"built in\"\n   queries such as Open Issues, Assigned to Me, etc. use the\n   comment index).\n\n   Note that the combination of these two means the Lucene\n   IndexReader is not explicitly closed, but wrapped in an\n   object which closes it when it is garbage collected.\n\n2. Improved ColumnLayout usage\n\n   The interaction between the JSP and LayoutManager regarding\n   columns is very inefficient.  In many cases ArrayList\n   objects are used, which must be searched sequentially to \n   find matching columns.  Also, during one display of the \n   IssueNavigator, the layout is queried several times, and\n   column information retrieved from the store many times\n   (for example, IssueNavigator.getColumns() is used to\n   return a visible list of columns, but then the\n   FieldLayoutManager is queried again for each column to \n   see if it is visible).\n\n   We changed some of the internal cached lists to be hashed\n   (i.e. DefaultFieldManager.orderableFields).  Also, we made\n   our own implementation of IssueNavigator.getColumns()\n   and FieldLayoutManager.isFieldHidden() to avoid repeated\n   field lookups.  Really, it could be improved a lot more by\n   rewriting the JSP to not go back through the FieldManager \n   once the visible list of columns is retrieved.\n\nThese changes have been working quite well for us.",

For us, it would mean at least a ten-fold\nimprovement.\n                                                                                                                                               \nLooking into doing this, I've got some questions about the Lucene\ncode in Jira:\n\nWhy is there a comment index and an issue index?  It would seem more\nefficient to have only one index, where the information needed to\nfind issues by comments is in the issue index.  Unless I'm not seeing                                                                                                                    it, there don't appear to be any searches specifically interested in the comment records themselves - only the issues that the comments\nare in.\n                                                                                                                                               \nIs this correct?\n                                                                                                                                               \nMost of the values used to index in Lucene are stored as\nField.Keyword or Field.Text, which besides just indexing the field,\nstores the value in the index.  Then, when a hit is retrieved from\nthe index, those values are retrieved (meaning all the text for\nthe Field is returned).  It does not appear, however, that any of\nthose retrieved values are ever used - all searches seem to go\nthrough DefaultSearchProvider, which only uses a single field,\nDocumentConstants.ISSUE_ID, and throws the rest away.  The ISSUE_ID\nis used to re-retrieve the information out of the database (or\nout of the issue cache, if it is there).\n                                                                                                                                               \nIs this also correct?\n                                                                                                                                               \nIt seems like what needs to happen is for there to be some kind\nof \"IssueSearchResult\" object which contains the values for found\nissues, and that object used in the generation of the JSP instead\nof a GenericEntity.  That way, the IssueSearchResult object could\nget its values straight from Lucene, bypassing the database.\n                                                                                                                                               \nDoes this seem a reasonable approach?\n                                                                                                                                               \nThanks -\n                                                                                                                                               \nTim\n\n",

      "description": "Currently, JIRA allows due dates to be scheduled for issues. The next obvious step is to allow due dates for releases. With those two pieces in place, a calendar view could be added, which would greatly improve the use of JIRA in project management. Specs for this feature:\r\n\r\n * Calendar view that displays due dates for both issues and releases.\r\n * Ability to see dates for an individual project, or groups of projects.\r\n * Provide day, week, month, and three month views of data. Each view would have varying levels of detail based on how much room there is. As a very crude example, I've attached an image showing a three month view. The little green dots are supposed to be due dates for individual issues and the bigger red dots are due dates for releases. Putting your mouse over each item would give you a pop-up with the title of the item. A one-week view would provide quite a bit of detail  about each item such as the summary for an issue, and for a release perhaps a graph of the percentage of issues closed for the release.\r\n * Ability to embed different calendar views in the Dashboard. This can be used by a manager to get a snapshot for how development is going for the week/month, or by a developer to get an overview of what they're supposed to be working on for the day.\r\n\r\nJustification for this feature:\r\n \r\nTime management is a critical component of development and JIRA's current tools around time management are good at a granular level (management of time for individual issues), but crude at the meta level (ability to schedule out a release and all of it's sub-issues). A calendar view would allow JIRA to act as a single tool for project management in many respects.",

If you mistype the password, the error screen comes up all scrambled.  This is not reproducible on demand.  Refreshing the screen (F5) causes the screen to be come more and more clear on each attempt.  The scrambled is visible HTML code on the page.  See the screenshot(s) I am attaching.  The screen does not always look exactly like this, but are similar in the fact that HTML code is visible to the user.\n\nSecond, when users are created the admin is forced to enter the username as all lower case, which is good.  However, when the user logs in, if they enter the correct name, but with some or all upper case then the user seems to be logged in, but they cannot see the project list or anything.  It should have instead, rejected their login attempt.  See my attachment for an example.\n\nThird, the most dangerous...  We have a permission scheme setup to that has Administer Projects permission for a group.  If a member of that groups logs in, they can then administer that projects components and versions to which that permission scheme is attached, which is good and the behavior I expect.  However, there is an \"Add Project\" link available to this user... why?  they can't do that.  When it is clicked on, the user is the forced to log in again... no matter how many tries they try to login they cannot, usually.  HOWEVER, we have had one instance where when the user attempted to login, they got to a mangled screen (similar to the first problem) but on that screen, was an issue list of issues not in a project that that user has access to!  This is not good.  I can't reproduce it again no matter how many times I have tried, but it's was very scary to see.  We set up groups and permission schemes to keep people out of project they have no business being in, but this problem caused a user to get to somewhere where he should not have.",
