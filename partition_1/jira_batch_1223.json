When working in an environment where we are using JIRA to manage use cases, manage requirements, manage features, stories and so on, we have a fairly diverse set of links. A great example of something we cannot do is search for all requirements and display the links to other issues, with context for what the issue link type is (such as a link to Related Use Cases). It is critical as a project manager to be able to make sure our requirements and Use Case coverage are appropriate, and to be able to filter out links from Requirements to Stories for example. \n\nThere really should be a a method in JIRA search to inject in JQL Link type as a selection option. In JIRA Standalone there are a variety of plugins to allow this, but OnDemand there is no option. ",

Steps to replicate:\n\nIt does not affect instance that have small indexes, as the indexing complete before the issue creation timeout.\n # Generate 30 thousand issues\n # Perform background reindex\n # Attempt issue creation, noticed error\n # Wait for another while (highly depending on the size of the instance where indexing of issue has been done), noticed the issue is created.\n\nThis could be crucial for the large instance and as stated on our documentation, the only downfall is that indexing is slower to complete but user can still use JIRA as per normal, but issue creation took a long while which gives impression that the issue is not created.\n{quote}JIRA can be used by users during re-index.\n{quote} * [https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Search+Indexing]\n\nHardware Specification during the verification of the Bug:\n * 64-bit \"Fourth Generation\" Intel Mobile Core i7 \"Haswell/Crystalwell\" (I7-4750HQ) 2.0GHz\n * SSD (Solid State Drive) with Read Speed 700Mbps/ Write Speed 400Mbps\n\nh2.

The content of such protocol would be for example:\n(with PO being the product owner, DEV being a specific developer)\n\n2012-01-13 | PO | Feature request received via phone by customer X\n2012-01-28 | PO |  Mail PO->customer: We need a workshop.\n2012-01-28 | PO | Internal discussion with DEV and  .... for creating offer\n2012-03-28 | PO | Customer says this is urgent, needs offer until ....\n2012-03-30 | PO | Workshop held with customer, results see Confluence page XYZ\n2012-04-05 | PO | Grooming finished\n2012-04-08 | PO | Offer sent, specification see Confuence page  XYZ2\n2012-04-10 | PO | Customer accepts offer\n2012-04-15 | DEV | Work started\n2012-04-17 | DEV | Discussion with customer about detail of specification: Customer wants 4 instead of 3 colums in report.\n2012-04-17 | PO | Change request accepted.\n2012-04-27 | DEV2 | Internal test and review of code successful\n2012-04-27 | DEV | Delivery to customer\n2012-05-10 | PO | Mail to customer: Tests done already? Can we finish issue? Waiting for feedback.\n2012-05-12 | DEV | Customer installed and tested product\n2012-05-12 | PO | Invoice sent by mail to Mr XYZ\n\nI think you get the picture.\nThere are several of  these entries which could be automatically created by JIRA, such as status changes (e.g, open->test->resolved), but often additional information is needed, such as about the content/result of a discussion or phone call.\n\nWe are aware that we could do all this using \"comments\", but given that comments are not exactly \"compact\", each being put into a separate box with header above, the rather compact protocol example given above wouldn't be as clear any more. This becomes especially a problem if comments also include detailed developer discussions, the complete content of mails sent etc.\n\nCurrently we have resorted to a long text field for entering the protocol. While generally suitable, this has following shortcomings:\n- Anybody can edit protocol entries by any other person\n- It can happen by accident, that parts or the complete field are emptied.\n- People cannot agree on one common formatting\n(- The list partly duplicates information shown in the JIRA issues' status change list)\n\nIdeally it would be possible to add and manage protocol entries for an issue just the way comments are created and issues, but the protocol entries would appear in a compact list separate from the comments in a far more prominent location than at the end of the issue screen. Furthermore relevant status changes would automatically be added to the protocol by JIRA.",

Hovering over the lozenge shows the status name.\n\nThis is a problem because a user can no longer distinguish between two subtasks with different statuses but the same category when viewing the list of subtasks in the parent task. They now have to hover over each subtask's lozenge. With more than a couple of subtasks this is unusable.\n\nAlso, https://developer.atlassian.com/design/latest/colors.html says \"Don't rely on color alone to convey state or meaning\" and this change clearly breaks that.\n\n ",

In our system some of our issues get created out of emails automatically. I need for every issue to be linked to an epic, so i need the ability to set the epic link automatically during creation. \n\nI know that this should be possible through scripting, but i could not find a way to set the epic link through a script. Your support team acknowledged that this is not possible out of the box but was not willing to help me with scripting it. So that\u00b4s why i kindly ask you now to integrate it into JIRA.\n\nThank your very much\n\nRegards \nChristoph",

When manual intervention is required the system opens an issue in Jira. Ticket resolution includes assigning a value to a field, accomplished via a Jira Custom Field. The domain of options, however, is managed by the system and any selected option must be valid within that domain. Since the system is used to add options to itself - stored in a database table - to ensure the automated parts and the Jira workflow parts work well together the sets of possible options need to stay in-sync. As part of its processing the system can create new option values within itself. Adding the ability to PUT/POST the Jira custom field option values would ensure data integrity and consistency across the automated and more manual, Jira-driven parts of the workflow.\r\n\r\nAs for needs, either a simple PUT with the full set of option values included in the request, or the ability to add and delete individual option items would work.",

I would like to have a summary (Score) field that is based on individual scores and scaling factors in order to execute a Pugh method based trade study analysis of the issues in the back log so that the most important ones can be sorted to the top. The categories can be supported by the existing Decimal field types but I need a calculation based field that relies on the content of other fields that exist in Jira already. \n\nWith this I could add a Service Impact Field, Product Management Impact, Technical Risk, Time to Implement, Manufacturing Impact, Safety Impact, etc.. and then in the Scoring Field (Field based on other values) I could calculate the score for each issue based on the individual scores multiplied by a scale factor for each type of issue. (Safey is X 10, Technical Risk is X 3 and Time to Implement is  X 1 etc...)  These scale factors should be integrated into the new calculation field. ",

[See the corresponding bug report|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-36064].\n  {panel}\n\nHi,\n\nWe are currently using issue collectors in one of our projects. Recently we've noticed that the attachments added through the issue collector have the wrong name, they should be <file-name> but they are displayed as <full system path>/<file-name> see : \n!attachment-fail.jpg!\n\nThis causes the attachments to be available (it simply points to an error page or an empty file if you click on the attachment).\n\nSteps to reproduce :\n# go to a test project in JIRA\n# create an issue collector containing the possibility to upload attachments and with a default reporter filled in.\n# paste this issue collector in a test HTML page \n# open this test page in a new browser (one which you haven't yet used today)\n# open the issue collector and add a new issue with an attachment.\n# click submit\n# go back to your other browser and the Jira project\n# find the newly create issue and see the attachment failure.",
      "summary": "Attachments in Issue Collectors are broken if the browser doesn't have an Atlassian Session open."
