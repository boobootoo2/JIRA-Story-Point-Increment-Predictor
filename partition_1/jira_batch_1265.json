Actual behavior: \n\nJIRA is adding the _Catch Email Address_ as a Watcher of an Issue when the E-mail Address belongs to some JIRA User and the Mail Handler has *CC Watcher* enabled.

Steps to reproduce:\n\n# Create a Project and associate with the _Default Notification Scheme_;\n# Add an Incoming Mail Server and Add a Mail Handler that has the CC Watcher enabled and set a _Catch Email Address_ the same as one JIRA User.\n# Send an e-mail to that address.\n# JIRA will create the issue and add the _Catch Email Address_ address as one of the watchers.\n\nh4. Expected behavior:\n\nJIRA should not add the user in the watchers list.\n\nh4. Notes:\n# This is affecting JIRA Service Desk Email Settings as well, in this case it is the request participants.\n# Tested on JIRA Core 7.0.2 and without the \"Catch Email Address\". If there is a user with the same email address as in \"To\" of a sent email, it will added as a watcher.\n\nh4. Workaround:\n\nModify the user email address or the Catch Email Address being used.",

Steps to reproduce (Scenario A)\n\n* Setup a fresh installation of JIRA\n* At the first step of the [set up wizard|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA050/Running+the+Setup+Wizard], choose a language pack other than English such as German\n* Finish the setup and create issues\n* Go to the general configuration page and change the default language to English\n* *(BUG)* The dashboard will still be mixed with both English and German language see screenshot\n\nh3. How to reproduce (Scenario B)\n\n* Start JIRA from a clean instance\n* Create two users: One with the default language and one with a different locale than the system default (For example: Japanese or Spanish)\n* Make sure that the system default locale is set to English(UK)\n* Shutdown Jira and Restart\n* Login into jira with the Japanese user\n* Go to the dashboard. Make sure that the assigned to me gadget shows no issues assigned\n* Login again with the default language user\n* *(BUG)* Go to the dashboard, you will see the \"No issues assigned\" text in Japanese.\n\nh3. Workaround\n\n- Restart JIRA, or in JIRA Administration \"Refresh Client Resources\" (System> User Interface > Look and Feel) and make sure that the language of the first user to browse the JIRA dashboard gadgets is the same as the system's default language.\n\nh3. Root Cause Analysis\n\nThis is caused by the way JIRA includes {{web-resources}} into the gadget's XML specification.\n\nCurrently, when JIRA is started all gadget specifications available in {{gadget}} plugin modules are retrieved, then we proceed to resolve a number of Atlassian specific directives (see https://developer.atlassian.com/display/GADGETS/Using+Substitution+Variables+and+Directives+in+your+Gadget) and then the transformed xml specification is validated and cached for later use.\n\nAt this stage, web resources are included via two of these directives, specifically {{#requireResource}} and {{#includeResources}}. This happens at {{GadgetProcessorImpl.processIncludeResources}} and web resource urls are generated per each included resource. The URl needs to include the locale as part of the resource to fetch, so since this is done at start-up this will be the system default language at that moment.\n\nThis is the wrong time to do this as: \n\n# All users will then get the cached transformed copy of the gadget spec xml which will specify inclusion of resources using the default language.\n# If the language of the first user to request a gadget is not the system default language (used to resolve the urls to the included resources) any call to  {{AJS.getText()}} or soy's {{getText}} function will be done under the current user's language, which will then cause the included resources for the default language to be cached with i18n strings in the _wrong_ language. \n\nThe second problem is more severe as it will affect any part of the UI that makes use of the resources corrupted with the i18n messages in the wrong language.",

A great indication that the ticket has been sitting on the board for way too long, and obviously it wasn't important enough to become urgent.\n\nWhat if JIRA had a similar \"decay\" feature, where you can configure the 'half-life' of different classifications of issues...and these items that have decayed, or became stale, fall into a pane on the bottom of your screen that you can drag open - similar to a pile of stickie-notes that have fallen onto the floor.\n\nThe neat thing about this is, if an item has been stuck in a state that isn't an \"end-point\" (closed, open, etc.), then the status changes to the stale status and can be found easily in the slide-out pane at the bottom of the window.\n\nYou could do really neat things with this as well, like run reports on how many items become stale; easily communicate a list of items that need to be triaged/addressed; and also you have a way to visualize the items that aren't getting any attention.\n\nIt's somewhat of a cheek feature, but I think there is value in being able to quickly/easily visualize the work that is being abandoned.  It will help the development teams so that the backlog doesn't get cluttered with items that never die...and it will help managers to make certain that items are walking through the process properly.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.\nThank you for building such awesome products!\n-\nMatt Terry\nmcterry@sep.com",

The customer admin may then re-run an import, and the instance should be OK if this second import completes successfully.\n\nThis seems to be rare, but the impact is severe.

There are several processes supported by JIRA, with different settings (e.g. bug tracking, Agile development).\n\nNo matter how often the admins say it, project leads keep assigning roles to people that are irrelevant to their process/project; i.e. the roles don't appear in the permission scheme linked to that project, so it makes no sense using them - or on the other hand they forget to use the right roles and then complain that 'it doesn't work'. I guess this should sound familiar to  some users.\n\nI checked with Atlassian ([SUPPORT] (JSP-127325)) if it is possible, but no, so this is the feature request: please make it possible (e.g. generic, via sysadmins; or per project via project lead; or both) to show/use only those roles that are relevant according to the permission scheme of that project.

It would be great to reduce the difficulty of this by enhancing the JIRA Configuration Tool so that it handles the setup of these. Already we have a fairly large amount of documentation that could be reduced with this functionality built in, for example:\n\nhttp://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Running+JIRA+over+SSL+or+HTTPS\nhttp://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Integrating+JIRA+with+Apache\nhttp://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Integrating+JIRA+with+Apache+using+SSL\nhttp://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Configuring+Apache+Reverse+Proxy+Using+the+AJP+Protocol\nhttp://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Integrating+JIRA+with+IIS\n\nAnd looking at the number of KBs we have to cater for these:\n\nhttp://confluence.atlassian.com/label/JIRAKB/ssl -> 12\nhttp://confluence.atlassian.com/label/JIRAKB/apache -> 20\nhttp://confluence.atlassian.com/label/JIRAKB/iis -> 3\n\nFor example, you could add a SSL and a Proxy tab to the configuration tool, or put them all in the Web Server tab, wherever fits best. This would then allow something like the following for SSL:\n\n# Select the SSL tab.\n# Select the location of the certificate.\n# Enter the certificate alias, if applicable.\n# Select the desired keystore (cacerts/user specific).\n# Enter the HTTPS port.\n# Select whether or not you wish to force HTTPS.\n# Hit the apply button.\n\nThis would then execute the appropriate keytool command to import the certificate using the path provided, update the {{server.xml}} and also modify the {{WEB-INF/web.xml}} if they want to force HTTPS.It could also provide an appropriate description of any errors if they arise.\n\nFor proxy, something like this would be ideal:\n\n# Select the proxy tab.\n# Select the proxy type (mod_proxy or AJP).\n# Enter the HTTPS port.\n# Enter the AJP port (if applicable).\n# Select whether or not HTTPS is being offloaded at the reverse-proxy.\n# Enter the base URL.\n# Enter the JIRA server IP.\n# Hit Apply.\n\nThis would then:\n\n# Parse the base URL and determine if a {{context}} path needs to be set in {{server.xml}} (as in [Configure JIRA's application server|http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Integrating+JIRA+with+Apache#IntegratingJIRAwithApache-Step1ConfigureJIRAsapplicationserver]).\n# Add the {{proxyPort}}, {{scheme}} and {{proxyPath}} attributes to the connector in {{server.xml}} (these values will vary depending on the settings, as in [Alternative configuration if HTTPS is terminated on the proxy server|http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Integrating+JIRA+with+Apache+using+SSL#IntegratingJIRAwithApacheusingSSL-NoteAlternativeconfigurationifHTTPSisterminatedontheproxyserver] and [Troubleshooting|http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Integrating+JIRA+with+Apache#IntegratingJIRAwithApache-Troubleshooting].\n# If you want to be super awesome, generate the block of text that the user will need to copy/paste into their VirtualHost configuration. For example:\n{code:title=VirtualHost}\n\n<Proxy *>\nOrder deny,allow\nAllow from all\n</Proxy>\n\nProxyRequests       \tOff\nProxyPreserveHost \tOn\n\nSSLEngine\t\tOn <-- based on whether or not terminating SSL\n\nProxyPass \t\t/${context_path}\t[ajp|http|https]://${JIRA IP}:${ajp or JIRA port}/${context_path}\nProxyPassReverse \t/${context_path}\t[ajp|http|https]://${JIRA IP}:${ajp or JIRA port}/${context_path}\n{code}\n\nThis would be *incredibly* useful.",

In the previous version 4.0.2 the cloned subtasks would not have the leading \"CLONE -\" applied to them, but only the parent task. Now the sub-tasks get this and if you don't edit the description and continue to clone the parent tasks the sub-tasks description starts to look something like this: CLONE - CLONE - CLONE\nThis might be somewhat annoying and not helpful. So I think having only one instance of the word CLONE would be sufficient even if I choose to clone a clone.\n",

Therefore we think it is only fair to not keep this issue as open and close it as \"won't fix\". We will take this feedback into account as we work on ongoing design and usability improvements to the view issue page.\n\n\nCheers,\nJason\nJIRA Product Management\njwong (at) atlassian (dot) com\n{panel}\n\n*Original description*\nWhen using JIRA, I often change the attachment sort order. I would really like to have a 'default sort order' so I don't have to do it as often.\n\nh3. Workaround:\n\nThis is an unsupported, and hacky workaround but hopefully it helps some people. You can use the following code in your announcement banner:\n{code}<script>var direction = \"asc\"; //Other option is \"desc\"\nvar sortBy = \"dateTime\"; //Other option is \"fileName\"\n\nvar origUrl = window.location.href;\nvar patt = /browse\\/[A-Z][A-Z]+-[0-9]+/;\nvar key = new RegExp(\"[A-Z][A-Z]+-[0-9]+\");\n\nvar sort = \"?attachmentSortBy=\"+sortBy+\"&attachmentOrder=\"+direction+\"#attachmentmodule\";\nif(patt.test(origUrl) && !JSON.parse(sessionStorage.getItem('hasReloaded' + key))){\n\tlocation.assign(origUrl + sort);\n\tsessionStorage.setItem('hasReloaded' + key, 'true');\n} else {\n    sessionStorage.setItem('hasReloaded' + key, 'false');\n}</script>{code}\n\nThis will automatically switch to sorting by Date Ascending. You can tweak it to suit your needs. \n(i) *This will only work for JIRA server installations. JIRA Cloud [does not support|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRA-27864] inserting custom code into the announcement banner.*\n\nIf you are on cloud, or are an individual user that wants to have this functionality without inserting it for everyone, you can use the user script: [^JIRA Order Attachments by Date.user.js] within [Tampermonkey|https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en] for Chrome, or [Greasemonkey|https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/] for Firefox.",

Depending on the issue type selected I want to be able to display a different list of values for a field called Area. So for example if Marketing is the issue type, Area would have the vlaues Market Problem, Competitive Landscape and Technology Assessment, but if the Issue type is Strategy the Aread field would have the values Market Definition, Distribution Strategy...\n\nRegards,\nRuchi",
