So it would be nice if a few of the more common configuration changes that are made are on the project creation page itself, that way it saves a few extra clicks and makes things a little easier to follow.",

I understand that in that case, we have to set up a dummy account, and set the \"reporterusername\" to that dummy account, so that the dummy account can create the ticket on behalf of the customer who mailed in the support request.\n\nNow, here is our problem. In this scenario, the customer, the person who sent in the email requesting support, never gets a confirmation email from the system that their request was received. They never get automatic emails from Jira informing them of comments or progress to their request, and they never get an automatic email from Jira telling them when their request is completed or closed.\n\nI see that the original customer's email address is appended to the issue description field, and that our customer support personel can copy that address and manually create email updates to keep the customer informed, but for us, that creates additional workflow issues and potential for omissions that are not acceptable to us. Is there any way to have Jira email the customer who sent in the ticket automatically when the ticket is created, updated and closed, given our environment?",

[See the corresponding bug report|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-33790].\n  {panel}\n\nHey,\nI migrated JIRA to test env from 4.3 to 5.2, it is implemented on IIS 7 server,\nusing TOMCAT 5.0.29.\nThe login.jsp page is started and recognizing currnet user with windows authentication automatically, but there is a windows security window (requesting for username&password) that pop-ups, that can be cancelled without any promts. Then JIRA starts normally. That problem wasnt existed on previous version. I have checked many things, and tried to isolate the problem, and I think it is related to web.xml file or web.config file.\nCan you please help me?\nThank you!",

Customer Expectation: \n{quote}\nYou recommend using the Apache Tomcat version 7.0.29 or 6.0.32 as supported application server plattform for JIRA versions greater 5.2.\nWhilst these versions are acceptable for an internal deployment behind the firewall, it is not acceptable if you allow public access to\nthe JIRA installation via internet. The Apache Tomcat team strongly recommend to update to the newest Tomcat version because there are\na lot of security issues in older versions espacially 6.0.32. The security issues for the respective Tomcat versions are public\n(see http://tomcat.apache.org/security-7.html and http://tomcat.apache.org/security-6.html) so everybody can take advantage of Tomcat's vulnerabilities.\n{quote}",

There is no reason to show the message \u201cShowing 19 of XX matching issues\u201d if the user cannot access the remaining (XX-19) issues. To give an example, if you typed in the name of a project in the search (Issue) field and received a message saying that you are seeing 19 of 50 issues, there is no way you can ever get to the remaining (hidden) 31 issues: if you add any additional characters to your search criteria the resulting record set is likely to change. Your \u201c31\u201d would change to something else ones the search criteria gets altered. Most of the time our users would not know what to type beyond the familiar project name unless they have a specific issue in mind.\n\n2. The History Search shows only the most recently accessed (by the user) issues. So, if the user has not touched an issue that he or she wants to link to it will not appear on that list. It would be great to give users an ability to search all available issues.\n\nThis would be a very strong feature to complement the existing JIRA\u2019s filtering functionality.

What's going to happen\n\nI'm going to update this JIRA issue every time we add new functionality or incorporate any feedback you have provided. There are no obligations to participate in this program - simply play with the feature and provide feedback whenever you like.\n\nh3. What we are after\n\nThe team really loves it when we get feedback on what we're building. Whether it be good or bad, it allows us to improve the feature much more rapidly than we could without feedback.\n\nThere is a 'Got Feedback?' button in the top right hand corner of the page you are going to be using. If you could click that and send all feedback/bugs/problems etc through, it will be raised in one of our JIRA instances and we can manage it there. If that doesn't work for any reason, please email me. :)\n\nh3. What you need to do\n\nThis is an interesting experiment on my part because we are using one OnDemand instance, which you all have admin access to. Please be nice to one another and only play with workflows/projects/objects that you create.\n\nSteps:\n1. You will have been sent an email with credentials to an JIRA test instance - https://admin-feedback.jira-dev.com/ (your passwords are your usernames. Feel free to change them if you wish)\n2. Create a workflow\n3. Play around with the new designer functionality\n4. Give us feedback!\n\nThanks in advance for any feedback or thoughts you have! \n\nBest Regards,\nJosh\n{panel}\n\\\\{panel:title=Things that were in the old designer, but won't be implemented in the new designer|borderColor=#333| titleBGColor=#faacad|bgColor=#fff}\n* Clone transition\n* Annotations\n{panel}\n\\\\\n{panel:title=Bugs that have been picked up by this program|borderColor=#333| titleBGColor=#009ACD|bgColor=#fff}\n* Creating a status with a long name fails without a proper specification of why. I tried to give it a name of about 65k letters. Perhaps add a maxlength to the textbox?\n* Sometimes when going into full screen mode, the tooltip is moved to the top leftmost part of the screen (see attached screenshot).\n* FIXED -When I drag a status off the drawing area, the status stops at the edge of the drawing area. If I release the mouse button and move the mouse back onto the drawing area, the status follows me around.-\n* If I can't add a new transition to a draft workflow, then the designer should know that and not let me do it graphically, then ask for name+description, before giving an error message.\n* FIXED -it is possible to move the transition label \"Create issue\".-\n* FIXED -When scrolling down the page, the workflow designer zooms (fix is in progress for this)-\n* FIXED -You can add a status, but it is hard to find where it appeared unless you zoom way out-\n* FIXED -When moving statuses, the cursor doesn't change to a \"cross with arrows\"-\n* FIXED -\"Create issue\" transition can be moved-\n* FIXED -Blue snap to object lines try to snap to everything (a fix is in progress for this :))-\n{panel}",
