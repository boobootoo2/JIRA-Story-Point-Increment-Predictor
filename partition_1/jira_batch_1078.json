Why this is important\r\nThis should allow more customization to different types of projects.

Issue Summary\r\nPlease Note the current Documentation Inconsistency BUG about the expected default behavior when a Boolean is used:\r\n- https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-72541\r\n\r\nClarification Reference from Basic Search documentation found here: [\"Search syntax for text fields\"|https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirasoftwarecloud/search-syntax-for-text-fields-764478343.html], Noting that the expected default behavior of not using a boolean value between two terms is the \"AND\" operator not the \"OR\" operator as both variations are currently listed in the document and the following statement is true:\r\n{quote}\r\n\"If you combine multiple terms without specifying any Boolean operators, they will be joined using AND operators.\"\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nHowever when doing a Query that has two terms missing an Operator nested inside a Group the behavior defaults to a \"+\" rather than an \"AND\"\r\nEXE using a very simple text search:\r\nin the Text field search for *test (singleTerm OR term OR compound word)*  noting that compound word is actually two separate terms where Term 1 = \"compound\" and term 2 = \"word\" per definition criteria of a Term:\r\n{quote}\r\nThere are two types of terms: single terms (e.g. \"hello\") and phrases (e.g. \"hello dolly\")\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nThis would be consider a Phrase if placed in quotes, as there are no quotes the default  conjunction operator should be \"AND\" however we are seeing behavior similar to the \"+\" Operator unless explicitly flagged as \"AND\" or as \"OR\" in the query.\r\n\r\nh3. Environment\r\nCloud & Server affected Tested and verified behavior on current Cloud version and server version in the range 7.2, 7.13, 8.0, & 8.2\r\n\r\nIf using Jira Server See corresponding Server Bug Report here: https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-69650\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Create Requests containing only one of the following in each issues Description and any other combination that you want to verify against:\r\n{quote}\r\ntest word\r\ntest compound test word\r\n{quote}\r\n# Run the search using Control search\r\n{code}\r\ntest (singleTerm OR term OR compound word)\r\n{code}\r\n#run the search using verification search\r\n{code}\r\ntest (singleTerm OR term OR compound AND word)\r\ntest (singleTerm OR term OR compound + word)\r\n{code}\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nExpected that control query *test (singleTerm OR term OR compound word)*  and the \"AND\" test query *test (singleTerm OR term OR compound AND word)* would return the same result set which would be the issue containing \"test compound test word\"\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nboth text combinations are returned and this is the same result set as the \"+\" operator test query\r\n\r\nh3. Notes\r\nIt appears to be a conflict of the double AND application on the distributive action to the nested query inside the (grouping), as the portion \"test()\" is technically triggering the default conjunction operator as a \"test AND ()\" with the additional distribution of the alternate default conjunction operator portion \"AND word\" making it \"test AND AND word\" causing some conflict in logic at this point,  \r\n\r\nAs an additional visual exe manual distribution of operators in the string *test (singleTerm OR term OR compound word)* to a advanced query should look like this:\r\n{code}\r\ntext ~ (test AND single term) OR (test AND term) OR (test AND compound) AND (test AND word)\r\n{code}\r\nBUT is actually being treated as:\r\n{code}\r\ntext ~ (test AND single term) OR (test AND term) OR ((test AND compound) AND (test AND word))\r\n{code}\r\nOR\r\n{code}\r\ntext ~ (test AND single term) OR (test AND term) OR (test AND compound) + (test AND word)\r\n{code}\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\nFirst NOTE the \"AND\" is expected not the \"OR\" per the linked documentation BUG, so use the \"AND\" operator variable Manually rather than relying on the query to use a whitespace to default to the default conjunction operator \"AND\"  especially when used in nested queries to verify the correct search operator is being used.\r\nOR \r\nRely on Advanced Search queries as defined in:\r\n- [Advanced Searching|https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirasoftwarecloud/advanced-searching-764478330.html]",

The complete list of actors for the project is returned.\r\n\r\nDue to the performance of the query that retrieves this list it can take up to a minute for a single response to adding a user.\r\n\r\nThis can be especially problematic for Jira Service Desk projects which are not publicly open and have a large number of customers as these also are added to the role actors with the *Service Desk Customer* role\r\n\r\nh3. Environment\r\nCloud with more that 2000 users in a project or a closed Jira Service Desk project with a combined more than 1000 users and customers.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Create Jira project.\r\n # Add over 2000 users to the people page.\r\n # Use the rest endpoint to add further users. \r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nThe single POST request should be performant and return a response within a few seconds.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nThe response returned can take close to a minute due to returning all role actors for the project.\r\n\r\nh3. Notes\r\nPerhaps a parameter to not return these results are an alternate endpoint where only a success or fail response is delivered could be a solution?\r\n\r\n(Optional - If Necessary)\r\nh3.
