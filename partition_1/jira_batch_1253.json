In our use, \"Closing\" means we are not going to do any thing about the Issue.\n\nI want to be able to change that text to better prompt the user.\n\nI am told I can change it here: /atlassian-jira/WEB-INF/classes/com/atlassian/jira/web/action/JiraWebActionSupport.properties\n\nBut that's not a good approach if for no other reason than it is hard to do and prone to getting overwritten with a JIRA update.\n\nI would like this ability for all of these text strings.

For my\nattempt to use the tutorial, I removed the logger, I renamed the class in\nthe test fork.\n\nThis are errors in the tutorial, however, I do not think that these are\ncausing my problem of the non-appearing customfield.\nWhat I SUSPECT is that there are more errors in the tutorial which I could\nnot identify yet. E.g. I might need some kind of \"searcher definition\" or a\n\"link\" that the standard text searcher is used for the moneycustomfield.\nOr there are other things that must come along with a customfield plugin,\nthat are not covered in the tutorial.\n{noformat}\n\nCan we please have a check in case there is something misleading on that page?",

The problem that I see is, that everybody can create his own label. In this case you have really fast really much labels. Okay, my suggestions is, to combine the \"label-field\" with \"multi-list-field\". \nThe result is a own labels field, in that we can configure the possible labels. And just the administration can configure a set of possible labels. I think this makes sense, because labels are only powerfull if you know the keywords. But if everybody is allowed to create own key words, you will really fast lose the overview.\n\nSo it would be great if we have in the future all three custom-fields:\nLabels, Multi-List and Multi-Label (or what ever :-))\n",
