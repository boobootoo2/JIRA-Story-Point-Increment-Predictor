      "description": "h3. Problem Definition\r\nWhen number fields are displayed in Jira, and these values exceed 3 digits, there is a convention to use a separator in order to show the difference between thousands, millions, billions, etc. much more easily at a glance.\r\n\r\nHowever end users in Jira Cloud do not have the ability to select which separator they see, at least not directly.  Instead the only way to currently control this is to change your language settings and have your language/region settings adjust this on your behalf.  For English, this is always the comma.  For many users the comma is not an ideal way to separate these values.\r\n\r\nExamples:\r\n||Language||appearance||\r\n|English|5,432|\r\n|Russian|5 432|\r\n|Espa\u00f1ol|5.432|\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNumbers consisting of long sequences of digits can be made more readable by separating them into groups, preferably groups of three, separated by a small space. For this reason, [ISO 31-0|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_31-0] specifies that such groups of digits should never be separated by a comma or point, as these are reserved for use as the decimal sign.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\nIn the account settings, let users choose how number value separators should be displayed outside of language norms.\r\n\r\nh3. Why this is important\r\nEnd users will sometimes want to see this differently, as it can be much easier to read and understand for different users.  End users should have the ability to choose their own personal setting here.\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround \r\nChanging your Language settings found on https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/account-preferences to a value such as Russian (\u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439) can allow you to view number fields without a comma/period separator.

[See the corresponding suggestion|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-71544].\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Problem Definition\r\nCurrently, in order to remove any user from a project within Jira, it has to be done by a project administrator (or higher level such as Jira admin or Jira System admin).  A typical end user without admin rights cannot simply remove themselves from an entire project in Jira.  In some cases they could unassign themselves from individual issues (if permissions allow), but they cannot adequately manage the notifications they receive within a project, remove themselves from assignable users, \r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\nIt would be ideal if an end user could opt-out of any specific individual project on their own, without the need of an administrator to manage this.  It would be great if there was a single one-time action/script that could be used to unassign any issues from yourself in that project, as well as remove yourself as a project lead, and remove yourself from getting any notifications from a project.\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Why this is important\r\nJira grants total control here to the administrator of a project.  Many times too many users on a site have admin access and can inadvertently add too many or the wrong groups to project roles/adjust notification schemes to include too many users that don't really want to know about a project.  Those end users can't simply opt-out themselves.  Their only solution it to reach out to a Jira Admin in order to get them to adjust the project settings.\r\n\r\nIn Jira Cloud, we do have a process to honor GDPR regulations such as the right to be forgotten and right to erasure, however this request is not seeking a complete account deletion, but rather the ability to grant more granular control over your own account.\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround \r\nCurrently it is not possible for a user that is not a Jira admin/project admin to remove themselves entirely from a project (such as unassigning all issues currently assigned to a single user, and removing a single user from notification schemes, and removing that user as a project lead/component lead/etc).  Please contact a Jira administrator in your site in order to remove your account from a particular project.",

Steps to reproduce\r\n# Create a user with no application accesses;\r\n# Create a group and add the user above;\r\n# Go to a Service Desk project and add that group to the browse projects permission;\r\n# Create an issue, with or without request type, and set the user as the reporter;\r\n# Mention that user on an internal or public comment.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected results\r\nSince the user does not have any application access, they don't have access to the issue and shouldn't receive Jira notifications.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual result\r\nThe unlicensed user (customer) will receive mention notifications for internal and public notifications.\r\n\r\nh3. Notes\r\nIf the unlicensed user clicks in the *View issue* button from the notification, they will be redirected to the portal since they don't have access to Jira.\r\n\r\nh3.

Suggested Solution\r\nWhen a notification is blocked on customer's end, identify and alert the customer of the cause so that the customer can act accordingly.\r\n\r\nh3. Why this is important\r\nAgents can miss out on notifications that a ticket has been created which will cause a delay in response time to end customers\r\n\r\nh3.

      "description": "{panel:bgColor=#e7f4fa}\r\n*NOTE:* This bug report is for *Jira Cloud*. Using *Jira Server*? [See the corresponding suggestion|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-71491].\r\n{panel}\r\nh3. Problem Definition\r\n\r\nJira in the default settings is only storing two digit precision for years. This is not always a problem, but in some cases this can lead to data issues.\r\n\r\nFor parsing with the abbreviated year pattern (\"y\" or \"yy\"), SimpleDateFormat must interpret the abbreviated year relative to some century. It does this by adjusting dates to be within 80 years before and 20 years after the time the SimpleDateFormat instance is created. For example, using a pattern of \"MM/dd/yy\" and a SimpleDateFormat instance created on Jan 1, 1997, the string \"01/11/12\" would be interpreted as Jan 11, 2012 while the string \"05/04/64\" would be interpreted as May 4, 1964.\r\n\r\n[http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html]\r\n\r\nToday Jira still ships with a default date format of only two digits for the precision of the year, such as MM/dd/yy.\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nWe should really not be relying upon Java's interpretation of what year is intended. Instead we should be implementing a four digit value for the year by default. This would require us to change the defaults for In the System > General Configuration > Advanced settings:\r\n # *jira.date.picker.java.format*\r\n # *jira.date.picker.javascript.format*\r\n # *jira.date.time.picker.java.format*\r\n # *jira.date.time.picker.javascript.format***\r\n\r\n\u00a0But also in the Look and Feel settings for Date/Time Format:\r\n # *Complete Date/Time Format*\r\n # *Day/Month/Year Format***\r\n\r\n*+For the java values+* \r\n * Change all the 'yy' values to 'yyyy'\r\n\r\n *+For all javascript values+* \r\n * Change the '%y' values to '%Y'\r\n\r\nh3. Why this is important\r\n\r\nMany users can create items and dates of events well beyond a 100 year range.\u00a0 This becomes a real and obvious problem when trying to store that date with only 2 digits.\u00a0 Dates entered such as 1/1/41 can be very ambiguous as to which year is being referenced here.\u00a0 Relying upon Java, today that is interpreted as 1941, but next year, that would be interpreted as 2041 (20 years from the current year).\u00a0 The solution seems obvious to attempt to completely avoid the ambiguity here and instead store this data with 4 digits of precision.\u00a0 This solution it won't impact existing users and can prevent customer frustration and bad data over this problem.\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nJira administrators can change these java values from yy to yyyy and javascript values from %y to %Y to make this change manually.\u00a0",
