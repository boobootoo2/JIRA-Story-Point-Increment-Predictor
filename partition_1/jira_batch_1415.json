      "description": "Dynamic Lookups (recommended method) - Applications should follow the guidance found in Internet Engineering Task Force Request for Comments 2782 (http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2782.txt&#41;: A DNS RR for specifying the location of services (DNS SRV). The RFC outlines how a client can query for services (LDAP for domain or GC for forest) using the Domain Name System (DNS). Also, application code can use serverless binding techniques such as LDAP://RootDSE or GC://<forestname>. Serverless binding techniques allow the application code to find any available domain controller with preference given to domain controllers in the same Site (see next section \"Site Aware\").\r\n\r\nNOTE: When using the serverless binding technique, please note that LDAP://nam.nsroot.net is not the\r\nsame as LDAP://DC=nam,DC=nsroot,DC=net.\r\nIf the application uses LDAP://nam.nsroot.net, a domain controller is located based on the DNS\r\nround robin function of offering all the registered 'A' (Host) records for the domain in a random order. The impact of this method is that DNS will offer 'A' records in a random order, thus the application could receive an IP address of a remote domain controller. In addition, the records returned in response to the 'A' query may not represent domain controllers that are online or available for use by the application as DNS is not aware of the status of the domain controller or the application services it provides.\r\nIf the application uses LDAP://DC=nam,DC=nsroot,DC=net, it is using the serverless binding\r\ntechnique and relying upon the Directory Service DCLocator function. The DCLocator function(http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms675900(VS.85&#41;.aspx\\) is\r\nAD Site Aware and will select a domain controller closest to the server and will also ensure that the domain controller is responsive.",

Drawbacks of the workaround:\r\n * Memberships won't be synchronised during user log in anymore. This means that when you add a user to group in Azure AD you'll have to sync the directory in Crowd.

Issue Summary\r\n\r\nWhen connecting Crowd to an external user directory such as LDAP it keeps track of users that have been deleted from LDAP but have relating content in our applications- these are known as inactive users. An example database entry will resemble the following in the cwd_user table:\r\n||user_name||lower_user_name||active||created||updated||first||lower_first||last||lower_last||display||lower_display||email||lower_email||cred||deleted_externally||external_id||\r\n|OrosA|orosa|0|2020-01-21 16:24:28|2020-01-23 16:37:37|Amina|amina|Oros|oros|Amina Oros [X]|amina oros|OrosA@test.mydomain.com|orosa@test.mydomain.com|nopass|1|d09a10df73ffd7498f3053a324a8083d|\r\n\r\nIt appears when users to be deleted are calculated, then *all users(active + inactive) from database are taken into account, but only active should be.*\r\n{code:java}\r\nclass UsnChangedCacheRefresher\r\nmethod validateAndReturnGuidsToAddAndDelete(DirectoryCache directoryCache)\r\n\r\nbug:\r\nfinal Set<String> guidsInCache = ImmutableSet.copyOf(directoryCache.getAllUserGuids());\r\n{code}\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Connect an Atlassian application to external user directory\r\n # Create content for a user\r\n # Remove this user from the external user directory\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nCrowd will mark this user as inactive and never reference this user again while syncing with external user directories\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nCrowd continues using the inactive / externally deleted user when calculating users it needs to delete. As this behavior accumulates in larger environments it will lead to longer synchronization times\r\n\r\nThe sync logs from atlassian-jira.log for example will resemble the following:\r\n{noformat}\r\n2020-01-23 16:37:37,499 Caesium-1-2 INFO ServiceRunner     [c.a.crowd.directory.DbCachingRemoteChangeOperations] deleted [ 1 ] users in [ 21ms ]\r\n2020-01-23 16:41:08,432 Caesium-1-4 INFO ServiceRunner     [c.a.crowd.directory.DbCachingRemoteChangeOperations] deleted [ 1 ] users in [ 10ms ]\r\n2020-01-23 16:41:21,206 Caesium-1-2 INFO ServiceRunner     [c.a.crowd.directory.DbCachingRemoteChangeOperations] deleted [ 1 ] users in [ 11ms ]\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nNotice how Crowd is attempting to \"delete\" the same user ( depicted above ) over and over again \r\n\r\nh3.

Issue Summary\r\n\r\nWhen adding a Jira server in Bamboo under the \"User directories\" module, an attacker can put any value in the \"Server URL\" field and the response from the server is returned to the client. Yes, it's true that if an attacker already had admin on a Bamboo instance, they can do a whole lot more damaging things, but this effectively allows them to scan the internal network that the Bamboo instance is sitting on and determine what other endpoints they can exploit. This vulnerability is especially useful if an attacker does not have a shell on the host and has just popped the Bamboo we app.\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Login to Admin user\r\n # Navigate to Bamboo administration (11.png)\r\n # Click on User directories (22.png)\r\n # Click on Add Directory (33.png)\r\n # Select Directory type to JIRA (44.png)\r\n # Enter Server URL as\u00a0[http://127.0.0.1:8000|http://127.0.0.1:8000/]\u00a0(55.png)\r\n # Click on test settings (66.png)\r\n # Observe the request to server (77.png)\r\n # Message for open port 80 (88.png)\r\n # Message for non http open port (92.png)\r\n # Message for Closed port (94.png)\r\n\r\n",

Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Download the [Delegated Directory Pruning for Crowd Plugin|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1218630/delegated-directory-pruning-for-crowd?hosting=server&tab=overview].\r\n # Stop Crowd\r\n # Place the jar downloaded from the above link inside the <crowd-home/plugin> folder\r\n # Restart Crowd\r\n # Once restarted login to the Crowd UI\r\n # Access the directory in question on the left-hand panel, you would see *Configure Pruning*\r\n # Check the box for only *Enable Pruning*\r\n # This job will run at 11 PM server time and would ideally disable all the users who are inactive in AD.\r\n # On the following day pick a couple of users who are already disabled in AD and check if it also disabled in Crowd from the UI.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nAll users those are disabled in AD will be disabled in Crowd\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nUsers are not disabled as the pruning job wouldn't run as the externalID for those eligible to be disabled has a NULL entry in the database.\r\n\r\nThe below exception is thrown in the atlassian-crowd.log file:\r\n{noformat}\r\n2019-11-15 04:23:00,010 scheduler_Worker-2 INFO [directory.pruning.jobs.DelegatedDirectoryPruningJob] Pruning users for directory 'Test'\r\n2019-11-15

      "description": "h3. Issue Summary\r\n\r\nThis issue refers only to a connector directory (reproduced on Microsoft Active Directory).\r\n\r\nIn Crowd, If you add members to a group in a group details page, a remote directory won't be updated. Changes will be only persisted locally. But next Crowd sync with remote directory will override them.\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Go to a specific group and add one or more members\r\n # Check a remote directory if members were added to a matching group\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nIn Crowd added users are present in the group. In remote directory, added users are present in the group.\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nIn Crowd added users are present in the group. In remote directory, added users are +not+ present in the group.\r\nh3. Notes\r\n\r\nI've reproduced this bug using Microsoft Active Directory. But it's likely that the behaviour is the same for other types of connector directories.\r\n\r\nThis bug also affects following Crowd REST endpoint:\r\n\r\nPOST /rest/admin/1.0/groups/\\{groupId}/users\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nInstead of adding members to a group in a group details page, it's possible to add groups to each user in a user details page. The second flow works as expected.",
