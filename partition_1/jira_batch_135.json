      "description": "I really don't like the changes made to the file status view, it's instantly become much less useable.  I strongly feel it should just be reverted back to how it used to be.  If that option won't be considered, here are some more detailed points with my issues with the changes:\r\n\r\n1. Files are now listed with their paths at the start, this means the most important part, the file name itself, is now at the far right, and not aligned nicely  with any of the other files names.  This makes it much harder to quickly glance down the list to spot file names.\r\n\r\n2. I used to be able to select a number of files and drag them to the staging area together to stage them.  You can no longer do this, meaning you have to stage each one individually (or, at least I can see no other way to do it - and I've looked quite hard).  The staged files area isn't even shown now until a file is staged.\r\n\r\n3. There used to be a clear and consistent division on the page between stages and unstated files.  Now they're all just in one long list, which is a lot less useful.  They are separated in the list, but where that separation is changes.\r\n\r\n4. The commit options are now in a drop-down at the right of the new commit box, this means you a) can't easily see what options are selected, and b) have to click the drop-down to expand it for each option you want to change.  This is less usable than before, and also isn't a very standard user experience.\r\n\r\n5. Oh, maybe I can click the \"Commit\" button at the to pro get the previous commit screen back - nope, that just expands the commit at the bottom, adding more non-standard user experience, and making the button almost completely pointless.\r\n\r\nI hate to sound so negative, but I really think the changes are a step backwards.  They remove functionality, make other functionality worse, and all I can see that they add is a slightly quicker method for committing changes (unless you want to set any commit options).",

This makes it really easy to accidentally amend an existing commit if the developer forgets to manually find and uncheck this option after the last commit.\r\n\r\nI think two reasonable approaches that could address this:\r\n1. Make the amend checkbox state clear after a commit. So by default, the developer needs to re-check this every time they want to re-amend an existing commit\r\n2. Or, make it clearly visible somewhere on the main commit screen that the amend option is active. E.g., perhaps change the \"Commit\" button label to \"Amend\", or maybe show some type of UI overlay saying Amend mode is active.\r\n\r\nThis issue is somewhat related to SRCTREE-2238 and SRCTREE-2258.",

But i have to do this every time i launch this dialog. Even if i close and immediately open it again. I've compared this with my other MacBook and a MacBook of my colleague. Both installed SourceTree, having (almost) the same git-config. They do not have this problem. I removed and reinstalled SourceTree (even deleting files under ~/Library/Application Support) and it didn't solve the problem. After pressing 'refresh' remote branches are available for this moment. I also can see a loading spinner icon in the drop down menu when i open the pull dialog but there are not any results. Only after manually refreshing them.\r\n\r\nThe only difference between this Mac I'm having this issue and my second one is that I installed a plain SourceTree app on this one while I had the AppStore version installed on the second one before.\r\n\r\nThe last update didn't fix this issue. The issue occurs in every repository every time. It doesn't occur on the other Macs where the same repositories are used.\r\n\r\nIf necessary I can provide further details.",

Not otherwise excellent source control software.\r\n\r\nI'm aware i can turn the \"staging area\" mode off, but this does not change what is a really poor experience.

I am constantly confused about what I am looking at. Because the table changes every time I check something, my mouse is always in the wrong place. I just accidentally staged everything because things are always moving around. This is just poorly done. It's not even a question of not liking change. This is just not very well done. But I should come with solutions, not problems, right?\r\n\r\nGo back to two table views that are in a split view so that they don't change sizes. When I check un-staged, it goes to staged but its tableview does not resize. The next un-staged item would move up but the group header does not move. Importantly, the item that *was* selected, goes to staged and *stays* selected so the thing that I was looking at does *not* change. Just as important, the table view header does not move so I don't accidentally stage/un-staged everything.\r\n\r\nI am a big fan of SourceTree but even filing this issue was painfully difficult.

E.g. I might not realise I'm ignoring white space, and end up committing some Python code that breaks because of the indentation.\r\n\r\nThere's also now three styles of buttons that contain additional options. There's one with text in a rounded button that does show the selected value for multiple options (in a single button), then there's a gear box in a square button (no idea what it does until you click on it, that's bad), and then there's \"...\" (also no idea what it does until you click on it).\r\n\r\nI much preferred the way 1.8 would display as many options as could fit, so I could change them instantly with one click, but it was acceptable that when space ran out they collapsed into list options showing the current value and allowing you to select others.\r\n\r\nBut the new style seems to offer no improvement at all, unless you really dislike clutter and prefer available options to be hidden away under ambiguous \"...\" and gear box icon menus.\r\n",

Unifying staged and unstaged files into a single scrollable area hampers productivity for my team.\r\n\r\n2. Clicking a checkbox to MOVE files from one area to the other is a regression compared to the previous drag (=MOVE) & drop paradigm that made previous versions of SourceTree the best git experience.\r\n\r\n3. Not making \"Use staging area\" selected by default after update seems a strange choice to me.\r\n\r\n4. When \"Use staging area\" is not selected, staging either lines or hunks checks the \"Use staging area\" and displays a git error.\r\n\r\n5. Losing the separate file and path columns is a real pain...\r\n\r\n6. \"Stage file\" and \"Add to index\" perform the same action and should probably share the same terminology.\r\n\r\nThanks for your time.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nBoris Conforty\r\n\r\nPS: please check the unstaging process.
