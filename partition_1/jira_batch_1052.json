If the field is changed to be optional or a default\u2026\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nThat's contradictory. \r\n\r\nThe issue creation flow works the same from any source. \r\n\r\nWhen you turn off *Allow unassigned issues*, you are required to have a default assignee in the projects. Even if you do not have the *Assignee* field be displayed in the create screen, the issue is created and the default assignee is set. That refutes the statement that says the *Assignee* field cannot be displayed for anonymous users, as that's not really a necessary thing.\r\n\r\nBesides, during my tests, I was able to create issues trough the issue collector when the setting to allow unassigned issues was turned off. The default assignee would be set anyway.\r\n\r\nSince the issue creation flow works as expected, preventing the creation or edition of the issue collectors when the general setting is turned off does not make much sense.\r\n\r\nh3.

Issue Summary\r\n\r\nThe *DELETE* method for rest/api/3/issue (used to delete issues), will error out (400s mentioning system error and 500s) when deleting *sub-tasks* if:\r\n\r\n* You send multiple calls at the same time and,\r\n* The sub-tasks belong to the same parent\r\n\r\n(!) I tested this with around 5 sub-tasks, the more the likelyhood of error increases\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Create around 5 sub-tasks under the same parent\r\n# Send 5 DELETE /rest/api/3/issue calls to delete the sub-tasks *at the same time*.\r\n\r\nIn my tests, I used curl with the '&' joiner, to ensure calls were fired at the same time, as below:\r\n{code}\r\ncurl -u <e-mail>:<api_token> -X DELETE -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" https://<instance>.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/issue/GAN-31  -w \"%{http_code}\" & \\\r\ncurl -u <e-mail>:<api_token> -X DELETE -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" https://<instance>.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/issue/GAN-32 -w \"%{http_code}\" & \\\r\ncurl -u <e-mail>:<api_token> -X DELETE -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" https://<instance>.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/issue/GAN-33 -w \"%{http_code}\" & \\\r\ncurl -u <e-mail>:<api_token> -X DELETE -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" https://<instance>.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/issue/GAN-34 -w \"%{http_code}\" & \\\r\ncurl -u <e-mail>:<api_token> -X DELETE -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" https://<instance>.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/issue/GAN-35 -w \"%{http_code}\"\r\n{code}\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nThe calls will return 2xx responses and the sub-tasks deleted\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nWe receive 400s that mention \"System errors\" in the payload and also 500s\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nMake synchronous calls (where the next call will only start after the initial previous one finished). I tested and this works in Curl by using the ';' command joiner, which ensures synchronicity.\r\n\r\n{code}\r\ncurl -u <e-mail>:<api_token> -X DELETE -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" https://<instance>.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/issue/GAN-25 -w \"%{http_code}\" ; \\\r\ncurl -u <e-mail>:<api_token> -X DELETE -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" https://<instance>.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/issue/GAN-26  -w \"%{http_code}\" ; \\\r\ncurl -u <e-mail>:<api_token> -X DELETE -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" https://<instance>.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/issue/GAN-27 -w \"%{http_code}\" ; \\\r\ncurl -u <e-mail>:<api_token> -X DELETE -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" https://<instance>.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/issue/GAN-28 -w \"%{http_code}\" ; \\\r\ncurl -u <e-mail>:<api_token> -X DELETE -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" https://<instance>.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/issue/GAN-29 -w \"%{http_code}\" ; \\\r\ncurl -u <e-mail>:<api_token> -X DELETE -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" https://<instance>.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/issue/GAN-30 -w \"%{http_code}\"\r\n{code}",

      "description": "h3. Problem Definition\r\nWhen calling the api/3/issue/createmeta REST API endpoint, this indicates that fields like *Description* expect a string when they do not.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\nMake a REST API call to that endpoint such as:\r\n{code:borderStyle=solid}\r\ncurl -D- -X GET -H \"Authorization: Basic [redacted]\" -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \"https://[cloudsitename].atlassian.net/rest/api/3/issue/createmeta?projectKeys=SCRUM&issuetypeNames=Bug&expand=projects.issuetypes.fields\"\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nThis returns all the fields on that issuetype in that project.  Specifically when reviewing the Description field, it indicates:\r\n{code:borderStyle=solid}\r\n\"description\":{\r\n\"required\":false,\r\n\"schema\":{\r\n  \"type\":\"string\",\r\n  \"system\":\"description\"\r\n  },\r\n\"name\":\"Description\",\r\n\"key\":\"description\",\r\n\"hasDefaultValue\":false,\r\n\"operations\":[\"set\"]\r\n} \r\n{code}\r\n\r\nHowever this type of string is misleading.  Because if a user attempts to provide a basic sting when creating the issue here, they are instead seeing a response of:\r\n\r\n{code:borderStyle=solid}\r\n{\r\n\"errorMessages\": [\r\n\"Number value expected as the Sprint id.\"\r\n],\r\n\"errors\": {\r\n}\r\n} \r\n{code}\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\nInstead of returning a type of string, the /createmeta endpoint should indicate that this field expects the format to be in the [Atlassian Document Format (or ADF)|https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/apis/document/structure/] instead.\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Why this is important\r\nFor developers creating Jira integrations for the first time, this problem is confusing and misleading to them.  The old versions of the editor in Jira would actually have expected just a string here.  However since all of Jira Cloud is today using a newer editor that stores that data in a more comprehensive data format (ADF), the REST API should be more clear that this is expected here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround \r\nUsing the /v2/ endpoint when creating a new issue will still accept a plain string here.",

We will be rolling out an improvement to this problem in upcoming days/week. Here are the expected changes coming your way as a result of the roll-out\r\n \u00a0\r\n * All external links that used to be missing when switching from old to new view should now be visible\r\n * Phabricator links will be grouped under text \u201cPhabricator\u201d instead of text \u201cImplemented in\u201d. This is true for other links. We will no longer group applications by relationships, but rather by application name {color:#505f79}(such change aims to make it more explicit to users what type of app/link is being grouped together, because the current text of \"implemented in\" is a free-text field defined by each app individually){color}\r\n * Links will be sorted old to new, the same pattern in the current \u201cWeb links\u201d section of the new issue view\r\n * Links are now displayed in a paginated manner, starting with 10 links and then 50 more, each time \u201cShow more\u201d is clicked.\r\n * New limit: There will be a 1000 link limit on the overall number of visible external links|\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n Thanks\r\n Atlassian Cloud Team|\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nWe have this feature request JRACLOUD-70833 to fix the external links in the new issue view but this is not including third party links like [Phabricator|https://secure.phabricator.com/T5422], this ticket is to add that possibility, the old issue view will not be available on March 31, 2021, so it will be good if this is added before that.",
