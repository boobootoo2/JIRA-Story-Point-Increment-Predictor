However, a lot of us can't do that so we end up jumping several versions when we upgrade. The what's new items are lost.  There is an inverse problem that some what's new items aren't actually relevant to specific sites but we have an all or nothing approach.\n\nI'd like to be able to (1) specify what features are covered in what's new, and (2) to be able to include features from previous releases.  Real nice would be (3) the ability to add your own what's new items to cover site-specific changes, eg, changes to custom workflows.\n\nThis library approach could be used as ongoing training too when something needs to be communicated to users asynchronously to version upgrades.  It would also be linked to a menu item to allow users to refresh an update that had checked off previously.       ",

If there will be button like \"Go to Top\" like marketing site to go to top. That will be great.\n\n1. It would be bater if the \"Go to Top\" button should not visible until it crosses some marked area in the screen.\n2. The \"Go to Button\" should be a hanging one. I mean to say when the user scroll through the issue, the button should go down along with the scroll.\n\nHope I am not disturbing your development team.

The version of JIRA is 5.0 (JIRA (v5.0#713-sha1:aec58e2)).\nI have dedicated user & password to access the LDAP. When we enable the active directory, JIRA reads all the AD users & loads it to active cache. It takes about 22 min (1354 sec) to fetch all 55000 odd records. The application is very slow during the process of syntonization. \nHere are my questions\n1. In general do you know if you login to JIRA with your AD credential does JIRA goes to LDAP & authenticates the user or does it authenticate against the active cache that it holds (copy of LDAP).\n2. There is an attribute : \"directory.cache.synchronise.interval\": \"3600\" that defines the synchronize interval. How can I change synchronise interval to 1 day.\n3. How can we increase the size of active cache\n",

Use case\n# An LDAP user directory in JIRA is created with 'Read Only with Local Groups'\n# An LDAP user is then placed in a local group, e.g. 'jira-users'\n# Later, it is decided that this group's memberships will be handled in LDAP, and a group of the same name is created (again for example 'jira-users')\n\nThe result is that the LDAP 'jira-users' members never get synced over since there's already an existing local group of the same name that contained at least one LDAP member at some point in time.\n\nh4. Purpose\nThe purpose of this improvement request is to investigate a way allow the LDAP group to override the local group in this senario. In the mean time, there's a workaround, detailed below.\n\nh4. Workaround\nWhen the LDAP user is placed in the local group, a new row will be created in the _cwd_group_ table associating the local group with the _directory_id_ of the LDAP user directory. The row will have the _local_ column set to '1' indicating that it is not a group from LDAP.\n\nThis flag, when set to '1', apparently keeps the LDAP group of the same name from syncing.\n\n# Shut down JIRA\n# Update the row such that the _local_ column is set to '0'\n# Start JIRA, which will trigger a sync on startup\n\nPlease note the impact this will have on your user memberships:\n* Local users and groups are not affected\n* LDAP users in the local group will no longer have that membership relationship\n* LDAP users will now belong in the LDAP group of the same name",

And neither should JIC represent a single point of failure for those other websites.\n\nWhen JIC has a \"scalable\" mode, we have to update the jira-feedback-plugin in JIRA to use that mode.\n\n----\nI'm currently investigating performance issues on JAC and the issue collector is causing quite a bit of overhead. (https://extranet.atlassian.com/jira/browse/ADM-33614)\n\nIn particular the request for /rest/collectors/1.0/configuration/trigger/d3de7fb5 (which any client with an issue collector will send) causes

no-store, no-transform{noformat}\n\nThis means that if an issue collector is enabled in OnDemand for example, every single OnDemand user will trigger a request to JAC for every single page-pop which will potentially hit the DB if the propertysets aren't cached in memory.\n\nI think we should consider:\n* Moving issue collectors to ActiveObjects which may be more efficient than the currently ugly pluginsettings storage (where everything is split across multiple DB rows)\n* Adding temporary cache headers to this response so not every single end-user page-pop hits JAC.  I think we don't have cache headers to allow editing of collectors, but surely several hours to see edits on the client is acceptable for a feature like this.\n\nEffectively the issue collector in OnDemand is launching a DDOS attack on JAC currently.",

My profile was set up to receive the emails via Text. \n\nEach morning I receive the email but the formatting is off which makes the links useless.  It appears to be adding the issue key to the previous summary link.  The screenshots may tell a better story.  The 1st one is what the email looks like.  The 2nd one is of the error message and format of the link int he address bar.\n\nI did change the email format to HTML and it solved the incorrect linking but still not wild about the format b/c we're using sub-tasks. The summary section  includes the parent issue in the summary links.  \n\nPS: What happened to the issue collector on EACJ.  Those things are awesome.\n\nh5. Findings:\n* The problem happens to users that using plaintext for email and only happens to subscriptions.\n* Reported working fine in Outlook client and working fine in Ymail as well. It seems only impact Gmail client.\n* Ran a lots of testing and a possible cause of the problem seems to due to length of the link/base url. I tried with 51 characters for the whole link: https://localhost.ismylove.com/123/browse/TESTING-3 and the subscription render nicely. If I change the base url slightly to https://localhost.ismylove.com/1234/browse/TESTING-3 the link rendering would be broken for 52 characters.",
