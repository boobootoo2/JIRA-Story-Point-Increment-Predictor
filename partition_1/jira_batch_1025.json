We create several user groups for every project we use - users, developers, managers... So, we don't use integrated \"jira***\" groups, because permissions are project specific. Permissions of user form same group (project1-manager and project2-manager) have always same permissions. \nIt will be wonderfull that I can say that for instance \"project1-manager\" group 'extends' \"jira-manager\" group. In global permissions I will then just put, that \"jira-manager\" can do everything and that mean that manager of project1 can do everything but just in project1, not in whole system.",

I know it's been a while since we last commented on this suggestion and I am sorry to have kept you so long without a clear answer.\r\n\r\nAs Jira server team we have once again reviewed how this suggestion is aligned with our strategy and priorities. I am affraid we are not planning to invest in support for subcomponents.\r\n\r\nWhile we absolutely understand the logic behind many of the requests for subcomponents, we strongly believe that our focus should be on making Jira simpler and easier to use. Simply put, additional levels of hierarchy for components is likely to add complexity on a conceptual level, at a technical level (more bugs and slower performance) and will lead to a more confusing UI.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, there are several add-ons available on the Marketplace addressing the requirements outlined below:\r\n * [Component/Subcomponent/Bundle Versions|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.deniz.jira.versioning/server/reviews]\u00a0\r\n * [Subcomponents for Jira|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/net.brokenbuild.subcomponents]\u00a0\r\n\r\nSince investing\u00a0in support for subcomponents\u00a0is not aligned with our strategy and roadmap, we will be closing this issue.\u00a0I understand that our decision may be disappointing but we also hope you will appreciate our candid and transparent appraoch. Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nGosia Kowalska\r\nSenior Product Manager, Jira\u00a0Server\r\n{panel}\r\n*Original request description:*\r\n\r\nAs a person responsible for running the project I need to have the tools aligned with my projects' structures. My projects are organised in a large hierarchical groups of components. I need to be able to assign the JIRA issue to a whole group of components, as well as individually to any component within the system and be able to interact with issues in JIRA based on this assignment - i.e. all issues for component group, including both issues which are assigned to group as well as issues assigned to individual components within that group.",

On the interface it says that I'm not watching the issue.  So why do I get the updates?  I thought to maybe toggle the watch.  But even if I click this on and off, I *still* get the emails. So this must be because I'm the Reporter of the issue, right?\n \na few things:\nIt's somewhat confusing to see on the UI that I'm not 'watching' an issue, but I still get emails.  From this I figure that by 'watching' you must mean 'other interested 3rd parties besides the reporter and assigned developer (and project lead?)'.  I suppose the list of people to email updates to is a combination of the watch list, plus whatever hardcoded values are in the com.atlassian.jira.event.listeners.mail.MailListener.  \n\n\nsecond, as unlikely as it seems, can this be changed to allow anyone to choose to receive updates or not, on an issue by issue basis, including the reporter?  I'm not sure of the architecture, I haven't examined the code. But if it's like I think it is.. removing the hardcoded values, and simply making these people 'watchers' would allow for this customized feedback, and would fix the UI confusion as well.",
