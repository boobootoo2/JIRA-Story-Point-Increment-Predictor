The length of the specified users' full names and resolution of the user's computer display seems to determine whether or not the custom field is expandable.  This is an issue because it's not clear which users are specified if there are more than 2 users in the custom field.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Create a new  \"User Picker (multiple users)\" custom field and assign the new field to a screen.\r\n# Create a new issue and add at least 3 users to the newly created custom field.\r\n# Ensure that the 2nd user's name is equal or less than ~7 characters in length(including space)\r\n# Check the resolution of the computer screen - this will change how the field is presented\r\n\r\nh3.

Even if your board contains issues from several projects, the sidebar remains project-centric, giving you quick, navigation to the work related to your project and board.\r\n{quote}\r\nThis is not how we use JIRA Software. And many of our customers don't either. Many of our customers support multiple external organisations and have set up JIRA Projects per customer.\u00a0Other companies have multiple Jira projects per application they support, but share teams and other resources across, so they need a common view on this backlog.\r\n\r\nOur own consultancy team has a shared board to manage the backlog of 50+ projects. How could we possible associate this with \"a project\"? Or with a user profile?\r\n\r\nOur key boards are not project centric at all, but team centric.

Summary\r\n\r\nIn one of the latest JIRA updates, there was an unexpected change in how Version Picker (multiple version) custom fields display.\r\n\r\nInstead of showing a simple button to click and display the version (filtering as characters are entered), a list of versions is shown in Edit Screen for issues (regardless of whether the users started editing this field).\r\n\r\nThis is not happening in the Create Screen in most cases, but we can see it when editing the issue.\r\n\r\nAlso something note is that this bug is currently extremely inconvenient when your project have a lot of versions in them (a pretty common scenario) and you have to scroll through a long list of versions to select them.\u00a0\r\n\r\nh3. Affected Version:\r\n\r\nJIRA 1000.1350.0\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Create a Version Picker (multiple versions) custom field\r\n # Add it to a project\u2019s Edit and View Screens\r\n # Create an issue using these screens\r\n # Edit it\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nThe versions are only listed when the field is selected, just like Fix and Affects Version/s fields.\r\n * !Fix Version.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nA permanent list of versions is displayed, taking up space.\r\n * !Custom Field.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nh3. Notes\r\n\r\nCustom fields which were created earlier, show with the \"old\" design\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nUse *cmd* + *click* to select multiple versions as in:\r\n * !Custom Field.png|thumbnail!",

Problem Definition\r\nCurrently, it's only possible to create a personal or a group based filter subscription - it's not possible to choose some specific users to add them to the filter subscription.\r\nIf you to subscribe certain users on a filter, they must be part of the same group.\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\nExpand the functionality in a way to add single users on the filter subscription.\r\n\r\nh3. Why this is important\r\nThis will help users to manage filter subscriptions - instead create one group to add all the users who should receive the filter subscription, it would be easier to add them individually. \r\n\r\nh3. Workaround \r\nThe users must sign up themselves in order to receive the filter results.",
