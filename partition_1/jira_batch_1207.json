Basically I would like to have custom filed in worklog screen where I can get two worklog filed, 1) billable and 2) non-billable. \n\nMoreover when I extract the report I should be able to get report considering billable and non billable hours. This should be visible on issue screen too along with Estimated time, Logged time, Remaining time, Non-billable time. \n\nThanks\nJaydip ",

Summary\n\nOn moving Issue to another project, JIRA doesn't check the permission for Assignable User. JIRA should not fill that Assignee field during moving an issue, if the former assignee doesn't have *Assignable User* in project B.\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\n # Create an issue in projectA\n # Give UserA *Assignable User* permission for projectA\n # Assign the created issue in projectA to UserA\n # Create projectB\n # Move Issue from projectA to projectB\n\nh3. Expected Results\n\n\nAssignee field should be left blank as they original assignee doesn't have permission in projectB.\nh3. Actual Results\n\nThe original assignee is still assigned the issue in projectB although he doesn't have *Assignable User* permission in projectB\nh3. Notes\n\nThe Reporter field is also affected by this bug in the same way as described for the assignee field.\n\nIssues can be also moved to another project\u00a0 through \"bulk change\".",

We actually have built a lot of internal applications fed data from/to JIRA so that people within our company can get information about our customers.\n\nIn many cases, we have folks who need to perform actions on customer information (look at their groups, change their groups, add them to groups).    This is something only allowable by jira-administrators.  These employees do not need to have access to everything else a jira-administrator has.\n\nHas there been any consideration for making global permissions more granular than just \"system-administrator\" and \"administrator?\"",

[See the corresponding bug report|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-39087].\n  {panel}\n\nThis issue is mentioned in the comments by @Halley on JRA-1898, a rather old feature request. But I believe it's somewhat different than that issue and really should be filed by itself as a Bug.\n\nJira\u2019s comment notification system isn\u2019t really reliable because we can\u2019t depend on users getting comment notifications all of the time.\n\nWe have set up a notification scheme that sends an email notification to all issue watchers and the issue assignee whenever anyone makes or edits a comment on the issue. This works fine when someone adds the comment from within Jira itself.\n\nWe also allow users to email back a reply to these notification emails, and we're set up so their email replies are added to the issue as and additional comment. This too works.\n\nWhat doesn't work is, if a user includes any kind of attachment, regular or inline, in the reply email, Jira will not send a notification email that there is a new comment. If the user deletes all attachments, images, etc. before sending it, however, and just sends text in the reply, Jira will send out a notification. Either way the comment is still being added to the issue. It's just a problem with the notifications not being sent out unless the comment contains only text.\n\nThe problem is Jira assumes that anything that isn\u2019t text in the email is an attachment. That includes things that aren\u2019t really attachments, like inline images and logos that appear in the message or in a sig. Also, since every notification that Jira sends out has icons and logos in it, simply replying to these sends back a message full of \u201cattachments,\u201d thus defeating the comment feature and filling up the issue with garbage \u201cattachments\u201d that really should not be part of the issue record.\n\nI can ask users to delete everything except their text reply when replying to a comment via email, but this isn\u2019t really practical since, of course, your average user won\u2019t remember to do that. Also, sending out a notification every time an issue is updated doesn\u2019t work for us. Users will get way to many notifications over the course of the issues\u2019 life, most of which they will not understand. We really just want to notify them of all new comments.\n\nI see two possible solutions (this is in order of my preference)\n\n1. If Jira had a setting to block attachments via email that would solve this problem (I know JEMH can do something like this, but its price is very high to use for only this purpose).\n\n2. If Jira could be set to ignore any email attachment with \u201cContent-Disposition: inline\u201d, I think this also would fix this problem. If its \u201cContent-Disposition: attachment\u201d it should add it to the issue, but ignore otherwise.\n\nBTW all users here have a Jira account, and this does not seem to be related to their \"my changes\" selection under their profile settings. Notifications aren't going out to anyone in these cases, regardless if they sent the reply or not.\n",

We fully intend to support MS SQL Server 2014 in the near future and will inform everyone on this ticket once support has commenced. \n\nh5. When can I expect it?\nSupport for MS SQL Server 2014 will occur in the next *_minor release_* of JIRA, granted there are no unforeseen events that prevent this support. If this does occur, I will relay any information back to this ticket to keep you all informed as best I can. The next minor release for JIRA is set for *Q1 2016*. \n\nh5. I can't wait that long, what should I do?\nIf you or your organisation cannot wait until Q1 2016 for MS SQL Server 2014, I recommend updating to MS SQL Server 2012 in the interim. We will be ending support for MS SQL Server 2005 in the next major release, JIRA 7.0, and it is recommended you do not stay on this version of MS SQL Server when it comes time to upgrade. \n\nh5. I have more questions\nPlease feel free to email me or comment on this issue and I'll do my best to get back to you as soon as I can.\n\nThank you for your understanding and patience. :) \n\nRegards,\nKerrod Williams\nJIRA Product Management\nkewilliams at atlassian dot com  \n{panel}\n\n///\n\nh3. Summary\nMicrosoft SQL Server 2014 is not certified/supported for use with recent versions of JIRA.

Safari occasionally decides to be helpful and pop up alternative spellings for words it thinks you've mis-typed, and you can hit ESCAPE to get rid of the suggestion popup.  The problem is that ESCAPE also triggers JIRA into throwing away your entire edit, with no ability to undo this action.  This isn't the first time I've lost work in this way, and judging by other bug reports I've found for other parts of JIRA I'm not alone in this.  So PLEASE remove the ESCAPE-is-cancel feature from the text entry box, or add an \"are you sure\" pop-up, or add an \"undo cancel\" feature, but please don't kick this into the long grass by saying \"works as designed\" - it's the design that's at fault!

Summary\nBasic search is unavailable when performing simple JQL searches involving users who have been renamed in the past.  This effects both searching from a saved filter or from a gadget on a dashboard which may have previously worked. \n\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\n# Create a user with any username\n# Browse to the issue navigator and search for this user either in the \"reporter\" or \"assignee\" field\n# You will be able to search either in Basic or Advanced mode\n# Now rename this user with any value (adding an extra letter will work)\n# Browse back to the issue navigator and, in Advanced mode, search for the user either in the \"reporter\" or \"assignee\" field\n# The \"Basic\" search will be disabled\n# If you hover over the \"Basic\" link, the message \"This query is too complex to display in Simple mode\" will be shown\n\nh3. Expected Results\nYou should be able to switch between Basic and Advanced mode\n\nh3. Actual Results\nThe Basic search is disabled and if you hover over the \"Basic\" link, the message \"This query is too complex to display in Simple mode\" will be shown\n \nh3. Notes\nIf you are unsure whether a username has changed run the following SQL:\n{code}select * from app_user where lower_user_name='<username>'{code}\nand it will return the current and previous username\n\nh3.Workaround\nRename the user back to the original username, or use advanced search instead\n",
