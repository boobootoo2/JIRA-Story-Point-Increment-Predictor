It was my mirroring that screenshot which seems to have created the issue. The opportunity for improvement thus, is to update that page to discuss when and why one would configure that Basic Authentication field. I suppose that since I am using Trusted Applications authentication, that Basic Auth in this setting is unnecessary. If that is a true assumption, then maybe the tool could be updated further to be aware of the authentication scheme. If the application link is setup as a Trusted Application, then perhaps the basic authentication field with the subtask ID's could be disabled, or otherwise programmatically nullified.\r\n{quote}",
