To navigate to the screen below: go to you project page -> click project settings -> click issue layout -> click on \"edit layout\" for one of your layouts -> then you should see the screen below.\r\n\r\nOnce you clicked Copy Issue Layout button as shown on the screen, you can follow consequent steps in the full screen wizard\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n!Screen Shot 2021-05-18 at 11.32.35 am.png|width=671,height=452!\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n============================================================================\r\n\r\n\u00a0As a larger organization, we rely heavily on standardized views for issues.\r\n\r\nCurrently, Jira issue layout is based in part on the screens, however, due to the fact that the issue view screen is largely ignored by the new issue view, this means that the issue layout must be customized for each every project, and a standard view cannot be produced and used.\r\n\r\nI would like to propose the option of making the issue layout something that can be copied or shared between projects.",

Summary\r\n\r\nWhen working with Jira and Confluence integrated if a single issue is retrieved in a Confluence page with a macro like the [Jira issues macro|https://confluence.atlassian.com/confcloud/jira-issues-macro-724765217.html], the issue itself will have a field \"*mentioned in*\" in which will have a link to the Confluence page that the issue is linked. However, if the Jira issues macro uses a JQL to retrieve more than one Jira issue in Confluence, the issue in Jira will not be pointing the specific page.\r\n\r\n*Original description (from the Server edition)*\r\n\r\n{quote}\r\n# JIRA issues do not contain the field \"mentioned in\" which shows the confluence pages that have a link to that issue. \r\n# This only happens when the Confluence page includes a Jira filter which results are more than one issue.\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Have Confluence and Jira installed in your Cloud application.\r\n# Create a few issues in a JIRA project (ROCK in this example) \r\n# Create a page in Confluence \r\n# Insert the JIRA issue macro using JQL search which returns multiple issues for example:\r\n{code}\r\nproject = TEST\r\n{code}\r\n !screenshot-1.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nThe added JIRA issue should display the \"mentioned in\" information on the Issue Links section of the JIRA Issue view screen.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nThe Issue Links section does not display at all.\r\n \r\nh3. Notes\r\nIf there is only one issue returned on the JQL search for the JIRA Issue Macro, the \"mentioned in\" information on the Issue Links section works as expected. For example : \r\n{code}\r\nproject = TEST AND status=Done\r\n{code}\r\n !screenshot-2.png|thumbnail! \r\n !screenshot-3.png|thumbnail! \r\n",

      "description": "h3. Issue Summary\r\nOn Jira Server, the attachments file names might have appended to the file ID the original file name of the file(from when the file was uploaded).\r\nFor example when I attach a file named \"picture.png\" to a Jira issue, in the Jira Server's file system the file is stored with the ID of the file it gets in the database, like \"12345\", but on some cases the name of the original file might be appended to the file ID like \"12345_pincture.png\".\r\n\r\nDepending on the size of the name of the original file, this name might exceed the 255 characters limit and the import will fail silently.\r\nh3. Environment\r\nJira Server importing into Jira Cloud\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Have a file with more than 255 characters in its name\r\n# Import this file into Jira Cloud using the \"Import attachments\" option.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nThe file is imported\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nThe importer fails silently in the browser (it just reloads the page).\r\n \r\nh3. Notes\r\nIn the micros_zipper logs we can see this message:\r\n{noformat}Callback to notify failure, details: Unable create file from a buffer. Failure: Failure{cause=null, reason=BAD_STATUS, message='{\"error\":{\"code\":\"BadRequestError\",\"title\":\"Request failed to validate against RAML definition: invalid query (maxLength, 255) for parameter name\"}}', httpStatusCode=400}{noformat}\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\nIdentify which file has this big name and rename it to just the file ID.\r\nRe-zip maintaining the folder structure and retry the import.\r\n\r\nThis is also valid for the \"thumbs\" file within the \"thumbs\" folder, so make sure to update the file name of the thumbs as well (or simply remove the \"thumbs\" folder).",
