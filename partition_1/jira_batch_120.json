When I plug off my macbook from the monitor, and continue working on the go, the SourceTree window resizes, and resizes the Commit Text Input Pane proportionally. It would be better if the Commit Text Input Pane height would not scale when scaling the SourceTree window, because also on the smaller monitor, I need my 3 rows.\r\n\r\nThe inverse is also true: when on the small monitor, I resize the Commit Text Input Pane to a sensible height, and I connect to the bigger monitor, the height increases, even though I don't need it that big.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt's a bit hard to describe, but a very simple thing that would help in the daily work, and probably won't be too much effort in implementation.",
