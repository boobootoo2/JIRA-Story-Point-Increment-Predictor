Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nAs an admin, I should be able to disable/enable the @mention email notifications for any project.\r\nh3. Why this is important\r\n\r\nThis functionality could help to prevent sensitive information to be exposed when the @mention feature is being used.\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nThere are two things that allow @mention to work.\r\n * The @mention uses the *Browse Users* global permission to determine whether they will be able to see the user list or not. So to prevent this you can remove all groups in the Browse Users global permission so your user would not be able to search for the user at all. The downside of doing this is you would not be able to search for the user even in any other field such as Assignee or Reporter. For more details please see [Managing global permissions|https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiracloud/managing-global-permissions-776636359.html].\r\n\r\n * The comment field needs to be of *Wiki Style Renderer*. By default; fields like *Description* or *Comment* is set to Wiki Style Renderer. If you change it to Default Text Renderer in your Field Configuration; you will no longer be able to use @mention. However, you'd also not be able to styling your text in the Comment any more and you can't no longer use tags such as the code tag. For instructions please refer to [Specifying field behavior|https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiracloud/specifying-field-behavior-776636443.html].",

Issue Summary\r\n\r\nIn the board view, when clicking upon a card(which is a parent), the sub-task time tracking original estimation is not summed up to its parent time tracking original estimation field within the New JIRA Issue View.\r\n\r\nThe same applies when we directly access the issue (card).\u00a0\r\nHowever, when clicking on a card in the board (in old view), it opens a pop up box on the right which shows the time estimation for both parent and subtasks.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\nh4. New issue view\r\n\r\nBoard click on card :\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0 !Board view cick on card.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\nParent issue view :\r\n\r\n!Parent task.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nSubtask:\r\n !Sub task.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nHowever, in the old view, it does show the sum value of the original estimation in parents and in sub-tasks.\r\nh4. Old issue view\r\nBoard click on card :\r\n !Board view click on card(Old view).png|thumbnail! \r\nParent\r\n\r\n!Parent task old view.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nSubtasks:\r\n !Sub task old view.png|thumbnail!\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Go to board settings > Estimations\r\n 2. Set the estimation statistics to Original Time Estimate\r\n 3. Under Time tracking, choose Jira's Remaining Estimate and Time Spent fields.\r\n 4. Now create an issue and add the original time estimate\r\n 5. Within the issue, create a subtask and add the original time estimate as well\r\n\r\n*Example* :\r\n - When an issue has 100m set in time tracking.\r\n - For the subtask of that issue, it is also set for 100m.\r\n - When viewing the issue in backlog and active sprint boards.\r\n - The expected value for the time tracking should equal to 200m\r\n - However, it only shows the parent issue which is 100m\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Result:\r\n\r\nThe parent task should have the sum of the Original Time Estimate of the current issue and the subtasks.\r\nh3. Actual Result:\r\n\r\nThe parent task only shows its original time estimate and not including the sum of the subtasks.\r\nh3. Workaround:\r\n\r\nYou can choose from either option:\r\n 1. Turn off the New JIRA Issue View.\r\n 2. View the time estimation from the board itself where it shows the time estimate in the cards\r\n !Card view .png|thumbnail! \r\n 3. Use filter navigator where you can add the column (Original time estimate) to view the total time estimation for the issue\r\n\r\n!Filter navigator.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nh3. Update as at 8th Jan 2020\r\nThis issue is related to the subtask JRACLOUD-70150 , you can use the workaround mentioned here but for the long term fix , please also see the subtask above.",

Only Marketplace add-ons can create a system account during their installation, when these accounts are created, they are used to perform actions on behalf of the app.\r\n\r\nThe alternative is to create a new licensed account on the instance (every account must have a valid email in order to authenticate and avoid issues in the future, E.g.: _The account gets locked and you need to reset its password by requesting a password reset email_) that will be dedicated to handle the communication between JIRA and other apps (custom scripts included). The account will need to have all the necessary permissions over the projects depending on the actions that it would perform, this is especially important if the account would also be used in custom scripts that can interact with the instance using REST API endpoints available in the Cloud platform (documentation for reference here: [Jira Cloud REST API|https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/]).\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nJIRA Instances should provide a different, special type of accounts that don't belong to an individual user.

As part of https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-70476\u00a0we have also recently released the display of the resolved date and time.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nJira Cloud Team\r\n{panel}\r\nIn the old issue view, users were able to set the resolution in the issue view. In the new view, there are no option for this.\r\n\r\nNote that you can see the Resolution if it is set, next to the Status action.\r\n\r\n!https://community.atlassian.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/74644i175C27C06489809E/image-dimensions/2500?v=1.0&px=-1|width=547,height=368!\r\n\r\nThough switching back to the old view solves this problem, it'll be great if we are able to set this in the new view, too.\r\n\r\n*It is important to note that this is not a good practice to use the resolution field on Jira*\r\n\r\nThe behavior of not being able to set the resolution in the new issue view is more optimal to avoid the common configuration mistakes by users of setting the resolution field incorrectly in the old view. For a quick background in Jira, the resolution field plays a special role. When the resolution field is populated, the issue is considered to be closed in Jira. On the other hand, when then the resolution field is empty, the issue is considered to be open in Jira.\r\n\r\nThe *common configuration* mistake for users is to allow the resolution field to be edited on \"Open\" status and this can lead to end users populating the field incorrectly and unintentionally closing the issues. When that happens, certain features in Jira may be skewed.\r\n\r\nThat being said, we recommend checking the documentation about the best practices on using the \"Resolution\" field and how to properly configure your instance:\r\n * [Best practices on using the resolution field|https://confluence.atlassian.com/cloudkb/best-practices-on-using-the-resolution-field-968660796.html]\r\n\r\nWe strongly advise following this documentation to set up the Jira Cloud instance, because eventually the new issue view will be definitely rolled out, and this will ensure that your instance is properly configured and won't have problems in the future.",

As you may be aware, we will shortly be releasing the ability for end users to sort actions from the issue view. You can follow this work here: https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-73076\r\n\r\nAs a result of this, we will not be working on the jira.issue.actions.order setting in the short term, as we review usage of this feature. We will keep this ticket open for now so we can provide updates.\r\n{panel}\r\n{panel:title=Atlassian Update - 10 Dec 2019|borderStyle=solid|borderColor=#2684ff|titleBGColor=#2684ff|bgColor=#ffffff}\r\nHi Everyone,\r\n\r\nI want to provide a quick update for this topic. this feature, *Ability to sort comments/activities on an issue*, is being under consideration to be prioritised in the next couple of months. we will keep you posted with the updates. I know this has taken a while to build out, but rebuilding Jira issues is no small feat, so we very much appreciate your patience on this.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, you can opt out of this new issue experience via your *Personal Settings* > *Jira Labs section* will have a 'new issue view' toggle to turn it on or off. We will not be disabling this opt-out option until we have rebuilt all the key features of the Jira issues experience you have come to know and love.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nAtlassian\r\n{panel}\r\n*Original ticket title:*\u00a0Configuring the 'jira.issue.actions.order' property on Jira's Advanced Settings page has no effect in the new Issue detail view\r\nh3. Summary\r\n\r\nIf the comments sorting is changed to 'descending' by the 'jira.issue.actions.order' property on Jira's Advanced Settings, the new issue detail view does not respect the new settings and keep showing the comments on 'ascending' order\r\nh3. Environment\r\n * Jira Cloud\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Create an issue in a Jira software project and add some comments to it\r\n # From Jira home page, click *Settings > System > General configuration*\r\n # At the top-right of the screen, click *Advanced settings*\r\n # Next to the *jira.issue.actions.order* key, change the value to *desc*\r\n # Look at the issues comments on issue view and board's issue detail view\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nBoth views show the comments on descending creation order\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nBoth\u00a0 issue view shows the comments on ascending order\r\n\r\n[^Screen Shot 2018-05-23 at 7.26.29 PM.png]\r\n\r\n!Screen Shot 2018-05-23 at 7.29.59 PM.png|thumbnail!\r\nh3.

Suggestion\r\n\r\nThere should be a feature to aggregate all comments where you've been mentioned in and filter out the N/A comments.\r\nUsing a query such as [summary ~ currentUser() OR description ~ currentUser() OR comment ~ currentUser()] will give you all the tickets you've been mentioned but all other comments will be included as well.\r\n{panel:title=Original request}\r\nIt would be great if there was a feature to see all the comments directed at me in an aggregated way. Whenever a ticket is updated, whether the comment is old or new, always tends to come up first as the ticket is updated. I usually try to find my comments by using queries but due to this update issue, the list I get contains both old and new comments based on when the ticket was last updated. This is not a full prove solution and would request to add a solution to this in future.\r\n\r\nI meant comments or anywhere where I have been tagged like, @user. It would be great if there is a feature to see all these issues in an aggregated form.\r\n{panel}",
