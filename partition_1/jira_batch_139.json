When I go to commit one of the incorrect commits, I find that my account (A@example.com) is already in the author field, but when I commit the --author flag is not used (maybe because it hasn't been changed) and the author is still the other user (B@example.com). A workaround is to put a space after my address so it is different (A@example.com ).\r\n\r\nWhy is this important?\r\nWhen working with Gerrit, one cannot push a new commit unless they are the author.

      "description": "Frequently when working in the main SourceTree window for a repository, I'll be working in the working copy and need to open a file (e.g. to resolve a merge conflict).\r\n\r\nI will right-click and bring up the contextual menu to \"Open\".\r\n\r\nThis is alright, but sometimes I need to open it in a specific application. For example, I need to edit a .html file. If I merely \"open\" it, it will open in Safari, which is not what I want to resolve that conflict. Instead, having an option to \"Open With\" (and presenting a submenu of apps that could open files of that type... just like the Finder does), would be greatly helpful. That way I could be sure to open the conflicted .html file in TextWrangler or TextMate or whatever may be most appropriate.\r\n\r\nIt would also be useful if this would be sure to open the file. For example, when an Xcode project file's .pbxproj file is conflicted in a merge, a simple \"open\" fails to work because the file is technically within a package and thus cannot just be opened by the Finder. If Open With (and/or Open) could open the actual file, that'd be great... but I know that's a bit harder to do in a generalized manner.\r\n\r\nAnyways, Open With would strive to replicate how the Finder works in this regard, if at all possible. Being able to dynamically build a list of apps on the user's system and present them. Also an option to select \"Other...\" if needed.  If it's not possible or is too costly to generate that list of apps, having a SourceTree preferences panel would be cool to help handle files of particular types... e.g. for files with this extension, use this app to open it. Prepopulate with a lot of known and common extensions, allow ease of editing those mappings, and if something is selected via \"Other..\", automatically pick up that new mapping.\r\n",

      "description": "It took me a while to figure why I was repeatedly being confused when handling branches, then today I found it: In SourceTree (for Mac), on the left hand side, in the overview for the branches, not only the currently switched-to branch is shown in bold font, but also the one which is currently highlighted with the mouse pointer.\r\n\r\nThe currently switched-to branch is otherwise only marked by the slightly different icon. The currently mouse-highlighted branch is otherwise also marked by it's colored background highlighting.\r\nThe mouse-highlighting stays (tho shown in gray background, but still boldface) even when working in other parts of the application, for example the log.\r\n\r\nGenerally, the less important information of which branch I have previously clicked by mouse is optically dominant over the more important information on which branch I am currently working on.\r\nTook me a while to understand that my brain was mainly confused by the bold typing of the string.\r\n\r\nI have attached an edited screenshot which I hope helps my explanation. In the two different cases, I have clicked from one to another branch. First, the master branch is selected, then the NO-Manueld-cruft. You can clearly see that the last clicked item is shown in bold font.\r\nPlease note that the branch I am currently working on (in these pictures) is neither of these branches. The current working copy is on MONT-85.\r\nIn both cases, the most dominant information in the picture is the least important one, at least as long as that highlighting is persistent over activities in other parts of the application.",
