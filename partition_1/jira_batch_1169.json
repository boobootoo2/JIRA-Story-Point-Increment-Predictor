Summary\r\n\r\nWhen using List View of Issue Navigator, the user has the ability to select fields to add as Columns to the list.\r\n\r\nThe Columns drop down selector can only display 25 fields at any time. In order to see more, the user is prompted with a message as follows:\r\n\r\n_+## more options. Continue typing to refine further.+_\r\n\r\nIn the circumstance where a user is trying to search for a value (e.g. \"*Type*\"), but the environment has *more* than 25 fields (including Custom Fields) which have the word \"Type\" as part of the value, the user may not be able to find \"*Type*\" in the list. Yet they cannot refine further by adding more characters; they are only looking for \"*Type*\".\r\n\r\nThis impacts users with a large number of custom fields in their environment, who might stumble into this issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n# Create one custom field with a specific name (e.g. \"Type\")\r\n# Create at least 25 other custom fields with any combination of characters, *followed by* \"Type\" (e.g. \"Example Type\")\r\n# Go to the Issue Navigator, and be in List View.\r\n# Click the Columns dropdown, and search for \"Type\"\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nThe user should be able to select \"Type\". This could be accomplished by either:\r\n\r\n* Changing the search logic to order results *starting* with the search criteria at the top\r\n* Allowing the user to expand the search results without typing (e.g. +_Click to refine further_+)\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nThe user is prompted to continue typing to refine further. Any further typing beyond \"*Type*\" will result in a non-match for the value \"*Type*\", making it impossible to select this value.\r\n\r\n\r\nh3.Workaround\r\n\r\n# Rename the custom field to something else which does not cause this issue in the Column search.\r\n# Add this renamed field as a column to the List View in the Issue Navigator\r\n# Rename the custom field back to what it originally was\r\n",

If you want to restore a project from JIRA Cloud to JIRA Server, follow the steps below:\n\n   # Install a new JIRA Server instance (in addition to the one that you want to import your project into). This will be a temporary instance that is used to store a full JIRA import from JIRA Cloud. Ensure that the version of this temporary instance matches the version of the JIRA instance that you want to import your project into, e.g. JIRA 6.2.\n   # Do a full JIRA migration from JIRA Cloud to the temporary JIRA Server instance. See Migrating from JIRA Cloud to JIRA Server.\n   # Export the entire JIRA Server instance.\n   # Import the project into your desired JIRA Server instance, by following the instructions in the Restoring your project section below. \n   # (optional) Delete the temporary JIRA Server instance, once the project has completed \n{quote}\n\nThis information is incorrect. It's not possible to import a backup from JIRA Cloud to an old version of JIRA Server, specially the 6.2. It's recommended, and sometimes only possible, to restore a JIRA Cloud backup in the latest JIRA Server version.\n\nIt's important to make clear that it's not supported and furthermore not possible to use the Project import tool to import data from newer JIRA versions to older JIRA versions.\n\nRegards,\nTeilor",

At this time we would need to manage this for them which creates an necessary overhead for our analysts. In addition this would also help work with enterprise customers who expect to have several individual accounts able to operate easily \"together\"\n\nThis seems to be a real gap in this design to the use of this collaboration tool - it could be doing more for us!!",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-59309].\n  {panel}\n\nHi Atlassian Team,\n\nI use both internal url and external url for my Jira 7.0.5. Currently when I click on the Jira logo it always redirects me to Base URL. How can I change the behavior of that? \n\nFor example: I log on internal url jira-internal.abc.com and when I click on the logo it will redirect me to dashboard and still keep my internal url.\n\nThanks and Best Regards.\n\nDung",

I found something really weird about the bundle context (context class of OSGi bundles, which is what Jira plugin really are) : the bundle being called when the ServiceProxyDestroyed exception was raised was NOT the currently deployed plugin version....\n\nTo illustrate this, I put some debug points in Felix (OSGi framework implementation used by Jira) BundleContextImpl class, in the invalidate() method (called when a plugin is uninstalled), and in the constructor (called when the plugin is installed). I also place a breakpoint in Spring Dynamic Modules ServiceDynamicInterceptor class, which is were the ServiceProxyDestroyed exception is raised. At each of these breakpoints, I took a \"snapshot\" of the bundle context for the bundle being used, and here is what came of it :\n\nDuring uninstallation of a plugin, in BundleContextImpl.invalidate() method, the bundle context is as follows :\n{code}\n{org.apache.felix.framework.BundleContextImpl@41676} \n m_logger = {com.atlassian.plugin.osgi.container.felix.FelixLoggerBridge@38134} \n m_felix = {org.apache.felix.framework.Felix@38135} \"org.apache.felix.framework [0]\"\n m_bundle = {org.apache.felix.framework.BundleImpl@41677} \"com.ovyka.jira.tesplugin [180]\"\n m_valid = false\n\nNote the OSGi id of the bundle com.ovyka.jira.tesplugin : 180\n\nWhen installing the new version of the bundle, here is what I got in the BundleContextImpl constructor :\n {org.apache.felix.framework.BundleContextImpl@41793} \n m_logger = {com.atlassian.plugin.osgi.container.felix.FelixLoggerBridge@38134} \n m_felix = {org.apache.felix.framework.Felix@38135} \"org.apache.felix.framework [0]\"\n m_bundle = {org.apache.felix.framework.BundleImpl@41794} \"com.ovyka.jira.tesplugin [181]\"\n m_valid = true\n{code}\n\nNote the OSGi id of the testplugin plugin is different : 181.\n\nNow if i try to use a feature of my plugin, the ServiceProxyDestroyed exception raising breakpoint is hit, and the associated bundle context is :\n{code}\n {org.apache.felix.framework.BundleContextImpl@41970} \n m_logger = {com.atlassian.plugin.osgi.container.felix.FelixLoggerBridge@38134} \n m_felix = {org.apache.felix.framework.Felix@38135} \"org.apache.felix.framework [0]\"\n m_bundle = {org.apache.felix.framework.BundleImpl@41985} \"com.ovyka.jira.tesplugin [173]\"\n m_valid = false\n{code}\n\nNote that the OSGi id is 173 (so not the uninstalled one, nore the newly installed one), and the bundle context is marked as invalid (m_valid = false).\n\nWhat I concluded from this is that Jira was keeping a reference to every version of the plugin, and was calling one of them, wether or not it was the latest one.\nActually, after a little more digging, I found out it was not totally exact.\nIn fact, Jira DOES keep a reference to all the version of the plugin, but does not call one of them : it calls ALL of them.\n\nWhen, after reaching the first ServiceProxyDestroyed raising breakpoint I let the application continue its work, the breakpoint was hit once again, with a different bundle context (180 in the example above).\n\nAfter that, it is not called anymore, but the plugin feature work is done. Adding a breakpoint on the called plugin method that Jira was trying to execute, I found out it was actually called, with a different bundle context (181 in the example above), which is why no exception is raised, and the work is done.\n\nSo here is the updated conclusion :\nJira keeps a reference to all versions of a bundle (after multiple install/reinstall), and when the plugin is called, Jira calls all of the bundles, one by one.\n* For all the inactive versions, a ServiceProxyDestroyed exception is raised (sometimes also ClassNotFound or NoClassDefFound, for classes that ARE in Jira provided classpath (Jira services references by plugins)).\n* For the active version, the plugin does its work, without any exception.\nSo this exception is not blocking, as it does not prevent the work of the plugin to be done, but may be very dangerous, because if the plugin does not require any OSGi reference, no exception will be raised, and the work may done several times...\n\nNow what was left to do was to know why all bundles were kept by Jira (increasing the amount of memory used, by the way). I climbed back the call stack from the ServiceProxyDestroyed raising point, and found out the source of the call was an IssueEventListener. After a small test, I found out the reason of the problem, and of course its solution.\n\nThe reason why Jira keeps a reference to all bundle versions is that, when a plugin adds an EventListener to jira, it has to register it into the EventPublisher :  eventPublisher.register(this);\nThis is not a process linked to OSGi. It is done \"programatically\", and none of the OSGi bundle uninstalling processes being aware of this link, the listener is NEVER unregistered from the EventPlublisher, if the developer does not unregister it : it stays in the list of listeners registered in Jira.\n\nThat explains why my plugin was called multiple times when I was doing an action triggering an IssueEvent. The EventPublisher was calling all of the registered IssueEventListeners, including the ones registered by removed plugins. And this explains also the ServiceProxyDestroyed exception, because when a bundle version is uninstalled, the ServiceProxy provided by Spring Dynamic Modules are actually destroyed, so all the services injected in the uninstalled plugin now are obsolete and linked to nothing.\n\nThe solution to this problem (actually one of the solutions) is very simple, and is given in your tutorial page (https://developer.atlassian.com/jiradev/jira-platform/guides/other/tutorial-writing-jira-event-listeners-with-the-atlassian-event-library) : Make the listener implement DisposableBean and implement the destroy() method with the line : eventPublisher.unregister(this);\n\nI think you should emphasize the fact that this is very important, because given the number of pages about this ServiceProxyDestroyed exception around the net, I am not the only one to have missed this point :)\n\nNow another solution to this problem would be to avoid asking developers to register their listener into the EventPublisher.\n\nA very efficient way to do this would be to implement the OSGi White Board pattern. When developing a listener, the developer would just have to declare it in the atlassian-plugin.xml (for example, declare it using a <listener class=\"\"/> tag, as it is done for rest endpoints), and Jira would just have to publish it as an OSGi service, with restricted access to Jira core only. Now the EventPublisher, instead of maintaining a list of registered listeners, which as we saw does not work well with the dynamic nature of OSGi bundles, would just ask for all services published under a specific marker interface, for example PluginJiraListener (just an example).\nOSGi framework would then give it all services implementing this interface, which are available at the time the call is made by the EventPublisher.\n\nThis would require a modification of jira core or Jira plugin management plugin, but would avoid this problem and would be a much nicer way to deal with dynamic plugins.\nAnd isn't it how this is done in Confluence ?\n\nWould you consider doing this modification in Jira system ?",

The operation times out and an error message is shown.\nHowever, the version is still being removed in an 'abandoned' request thread and finally disappears from the versions list.\n\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\n\n1. Create at least 200 issues and set their fix version/s to A.\n2. Delete version A from project administration.\n3.*BUG* The operation will timeout in the UI, although the version will proceed and be successful in the background.\n\nh3. Actual Results\n\nThe Delete/Merge Version operations time out when the number of issues involved is large.\n\nh3. Expected Results\n\nThe UI operation does not time out regardless of the number of issues involved in the deletion or merging of versions.\n\n h3. Notes\n\nThis affects both version delete / merge. Cloud is more affected than server by this because the request time-out in the Cloud environment is shorter.",

Summary\nThe quick search \"Saved Filter\" inside Gadgets is not listing all available filters that match the search criteria. It returns a list of 10 items that match the search criteria and then does consecutive searches over those first 10 items, missing filters that were not included in the first results.\n\nh3. Affects\n* JIRA 7.1\n* Dashboard Gadgets\n* Confluence Macros with JIRA filters\n\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\n# Create 11 or more Filters that start with the same word. e.g: \"Filter A\",\"Filter B\", etc\n# Add the \"Two Dimensional Filter Statistics\" gadget to a Dashboard\n# Search for the 11th filter by typing \"Filter K\"\n\nh3. Expected Results\nThe Filter is found because the search matches the filter's name.\n\nh3. Actual Results\n* Typing the first name returns 10 filters. Good so far.\n* Typing the start of the second word brings no results or a sub group of the previous 10 results.\n \nh3. Notes\n* Doesn't affect JIRA 6.4 and previous.\n* Searching for \"K\" in the example, will find the 11th filter but if the site has another 10 filters with the letter K, it may not. Making it unsearchable.\n\nh3.Workarounds\n* Use the Advanced Search to find the filter (not available in Confluence macros)\n* Add a unique word to the filter.\n* Search for the second word. This will only work if the 10 results for the second word include the filter.",

This pops up an Edit Transition window with a drop-down for *Screen*\n# In Text Mode, select the Transition, then click the Edit button at the top right. This loads a new page to edit the transition with a drop-down for *Transition View*\n\nAlso, while in Diagram Mode, select the Transition, then one of the advanced functions such as Validators. From here you can Edit, reaching the same screen as in #2.\n\nThere are two problems. First is the inconsistent naming between these, Screen vs. Transition View.\n\nSecond, using the Default Classic Workflow, we can see that there's a disconnect between these two fields (Screen and Transition View). Using method #2, edit the Close transition and note that the Transition View is the Resolve screen. Then use method #1 to edit the Close transition and note that the Screen is None.\n\nIf you change the screen using method #1 from None to Default Screen, save it, then edit the transition using method #2, you will see that the Transition View has been changed to Default Screen.\n\nThis confirms that both Screen and Transition View are the same, but for some reason, the editing window provided by Diagram Mode isn't always displaying the same data as the Text mode.\n\nThis affects previous versions of JIRA as well (back to 6.3.5 at least).",

We have identified the root cause of this issue and a fix has already been deployed to JIRA Cloud production. The fix has been deployed to all instances. \n\nAt this point we consider this issue resolved. If you have any questions, please contact Atlassian Support.\n\nRegards,\n\nOswaldo Hern\u00e1ndez. \nJIRA Bugmaster.\n[Atlassian].\n{panel}\n\nh3. Summary\n\nAfter the upgrade in JIRA on Jan/3/2016, several customers were having a long delay in JIRA Incoming Email Handlers. Which didn't seem to be running.\n\nAfter analysis, we found that a code change that inadvertently bypassed some bridging code that existed between JIRA's current scheduled job parameter format and the format that existed pre JIRA 7.0.  As a result, schedules that have not been modified since before 7.0 was deployed may not be read correctly by the scheduler.\n\nEditing the service to some other delay and back to '1' rests the Service and fixes the issue:\n!minute_service.png|thumbnail!\n\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\nAfter upgrade, some scheduled jobs are not running.  The Scheduler details page shows that the jobs parameters could not be read.\n\nh3. Expected Results\nRemain running as scheduled.\n\nh3. Actual Results\nAffected jobs do not run.\n\nh3.Workaround\n# In the Services (https://instance.atlassian.net/secure/admin/ViewServices!default.jspa) page, find the affected job.\n# Go to the Incoming Email page\n# Edit the Mail Handler\n# Set the delay to the desired interval the handler should be executed (in minutes).\nIf the value is already set to 1, simply click on *Next* and *Save*.\n# Check in Services page if the Service related to that was update correctly. The Service has the same name.",
