Particularly for users like me who need to do a series rounds of ex-diff inside SourceTree very often in one session.\r\n\u00a0\r\nI am not sure where the underlying problem is located, is it wrong with the argument I put in SourceTree(I follow the DeltaWalker webpage indication exactly), or is it a bug in SourceTree side, or is it with the system Mercurial. Please fix it.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlus, I also wondered if DeltaWalker could be integrated into SourceTree as an officially supported ex-diff utility like FileMerge, BeyondCompare etc, since for many professional diff users I know of, they use DeltaWalker over other utilities. Please consider adding DeltaWalker support. * [https://community.atlassian.com/t5/SourceTree-questions/Feature-Request-add-integration-for-deltawalker/qaq-p/363857]\r\n * https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/SRCTREE-2046\r\n * https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/SRCTREE-2433?workflowName=SourceTree+Bug+Workflow&stepId=1\r\n\r\np.s. : From the posts above, I see there is an effot to add DeltaWalker as build-in ex-diff support back in 2011 but failed since DeltaWalker is not very stable back then, now the latest release of DeltaWalker is v2.3.2 in Apr 2017, during all this time DeltaWalker has gone through a series round of major upgrade in both functionality and core architecture, and it has been running so stable according to DeltaWalker community. So please give it another go and see if we get luck this time. ;P\r\n\r\nLook forward to your kind assistance, since SourceTree rocks!\r\n\r\nThank you in advance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n--\r\nBest regardsMilo",

If I try to stage individual lines, I get the same error. I can stage and unstage without error by clicking the checkbox next to the filename; this works on both the entire file as one unit and to manipulate all the remaining hunks of a file after I\u2019ve staged selected ones.\r\n\r\nThere\u2019s no obvious pattern on content: in one case two hunks differ only by variable name, and yet one works while the other gives an error. It seems consistent in that a hunk that produces an error will always produce an error, both within the same session and in older/newer versions of SourceTree.\r\n\r\nWorkaround: use the checkbox to stage/unstage entire files, though that doesn\u2019t help if you really want to separate out individual hunks.\r\n\r\nFound in SourceTree-Beta Version 2.5.3 (113)\r\nConfirmed in SourceTree Version 2.5 (104)\r\nOS X 10.11.5 \u201cEl Capitan\u201d (15F34)",

And actually doing so requires way way too many steps.\r\n\r\n[Suggested Solution]:\r\n [1] Make a stand-alone menu item \"File history...\" under menu \"View\".\r\n [2] Once clicked, user will have chance to enter a valid file-path into an input box and click on a \"Go\" button to launch the current \"Log selected...\" window.\r\n\r\n[Further Suggestion]:\r\n If possible, can \"Log selected...\" window be launched via a direct Terminal command? Such as \"soruceTree.exe my-project/my-file.js\" ? This will allow user to either automate and view the \"Log selected\" window very quickly.\r\n\r\nPlease note that viewing history for a single file is such a fundamental feature, it must be promoted to be a\u00a0first-class operation. I do enjoy using SourceTree - but I have spent a lot of extra time on this particular operation. \u00a0Deeply appreciated if a fix can\u00a0be made.\r\n\r\nMany thanks",

      "description": "This issue is still present in SourceTree 2.5, albeit less severe. I can reliably reproduce it for certain hunks, but not for others. So far, my theory is that it depends on the size of the hunk: For small hunks, staging is fine, but for large hunks, it still causes a reset of the scroll position.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nAttached are two screenshots, one just before staging the depicted hunk (the top one, fully visible), the other taken right after, with the scroll position reset.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nHere is the text of my original report (for 2.3.2):\r\n\r\nWhen using the \"Stage hunk\" button to stage changes for git, the diff view each time scrolls to the top. This is very annoying if I want to say, stage hunks 10 to 15 out of 20, as for each hunk I stage, I next have to scroll back where I was, stage the next hunk, and so on.\r\n\r\nNote that sometimes, when I wait a moment longer after staging the hunk, the diff view flickers as if it was scrolled back to the top and redrawn *again* ...\r\n\r\nThis used to work flawlessly, but at some point in the past broke (unfortunately, I do not know whether it correlated with a SourceTree update).\r\n\r\nI already have the \"Refresh automatically when files change\" option disabled in the preferences, as that also used to cause things to scroll at arbitrary times. But it is almost as if staging a hunk now ignores this setting... ?!?\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThis is *really* annoying, as it negatively impacts my usual workflow quite seriously. For now, I am back to using \"git add -p\", but I'd really prefer to use SourceTree for this again, as it also allows me to quickly stage or discared individual lines.",
