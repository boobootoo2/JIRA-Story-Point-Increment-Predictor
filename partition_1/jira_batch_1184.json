Problem Definition\nUsing [JIRA for Assets Management|http://blogs.atlassian.com/2015/03/free-ebook-jira-service-desks-guide-asset-management/] requires users to enter several issues at once. \n\nAlbeit JIRA allows users to use the \"create another\" feature to log issues one after another, that is tiresome when entering many issues, specially as you have to wait for the form to be submitted to fill another issue.\n\nAnd creating CSV files requires you to create a separate file, which becomes more and more complicate, and requires users to manage things in excel and then export to CSV and import into JIRA, which duplicates the information the user needs to store (once in Excel and then in JIRA).\n\n\\\\\n\nh3. Suggested Solution\nIt would be great if JIRA provided a \"Bulk Create\" feature, which would allow the user to select the project / issue type in which the issue would be created.\n\nThen, select what fields would be available to enter (similarly to how the Create Issue screen works with the *Configure Fields*). \n\nThe user could then simply use tab to go through all fields of the issue. Once it hits the end of the row, it would add a new line with empty fields for a new issue - similarly to how adding rows to a Confluence Table works. After filing the \"rows\" of the \"table\", the user can just submit the form once, which would create all needed issues.",

That does not only affects the footer which can be adjusted manually for each product (See end-user-agreement, 6.4 Attribution) but also the information within html headers.\n\nProviding those information even to anonymous users on any login mask could be abused to identify security flaw. So if we just remove the version out of the footer, the page it self still contains any needed information, e.g.:\n{code}<meta name=\"application-name\" content=\"JIRA\" data-name=\"jira\" data-version=\"6.4.1\">{code}\nAlso all manuell changes are not fully prove for upcoming update and increase therefore the impact of maintenance. In short: Editing templates is just _quick and dirty_ and could not be the best practice.\n\nI suggest to give end users (in administration role) the opportunity hide all internal information for not logged in users. Such a system should only provide the login mask and in addition to the EUA 6.4 the \"powered by Atlassian\" term.\n\n*Benefit and Business value*\nEach product become more secure and more resistant to potential attacks. In my opinion this is helpful for all of your business customer who needs there Atlassian stack or single product online. ",

This can be done based on groups, or maybe have a permission just for that. A use case scenario would be like the following\n# We have 2 Jira instances that have application links\n# Jira A is accessible externally the company (customers)\n# Jira B is accessible only internally\n# There is an issue link between JIRA A & B\n# Customers do not have access to JIRAB, so there is not point they can view issue links",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-43585].\n  {panel}\n\n*Problem-Context*\n\nSome of my customers are highly concerned about securing JIRA/Confluence. While accesing the tools can be easily secured through SSL a security painpont are the notfication mails. Enabling TLS for the mail server is useless in most scenarios as this only secures the transport to the next hop. \n\nSo how to deal with it. The first strategy is to customize the mail templates and strip all content that is not allowed to be deliverd through insecure networks. There are some tickets in JIRA and confluence about this matter. However customizing the templates is to much administration as this needs to check after each update/upgrade of the tool. In addition the users really love the notifications, and stripping all content is not of much help to them.\n\nThe second strategy applies to a scenario where mails to some domains could be delivered without any concern (e.g. secure internal domain) and some mails to external suppliers needs to be dropped or filtered. In this case I recommend my customers to setup an postfix after queue filter to do the trick - which works pretty well.\n\n*Suggestion*\n\nThere should be a flag in the notification scheme which says \"Send mails to the user only if he or she has provided a valid mail certificate\". In the user profile there would be an upload feature, so that the user can upload or update his public mail certificate (as selfservice - so no additional administration efforts in caretaking of certificates). And of course if the flag is set, the mail sent would be encrypted and signed by JIRA/Confluence and if the user has not stored a certificate he gets nothing (or an advice to store a mail certificate in his profile).\n",
