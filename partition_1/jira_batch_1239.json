Weirdly, if there is *no* Set Issue Security permission configured in JIRA A (while the issue has a issue security level), the remote copy works fine.\n\nh4. Steps to Reproduce\n# Set up JIRA A and JIRA B with JIRA to JIRA Issue Copy\n# Set up Application Link between JIRA A and JIRA B\n# Create Project AA in JIRA A with Issue Security Level enable\n#- Create the Issue Security Level for Project Roles(Developers)\n#- Gives the user permission to Set Issue Security in JIRA A\n# Create Project BB in JIRA B without any Issue Security Level\n#- Use the Default Permission Scheme for Project BB\n# Create an issue in Project AA with a security level\n# Remote copy the issue from Project AA to Project BB and will encounter the following error\n!RIC_nosecurity_both.PNG!\n\nh4. Additional Notes\n* It has been tested to Remote Copy between JIRA 5.2.10 and JIRA 5.2.11\n* It has been tested with JIRA to JIRA Issue Copy 3.0 and 3.1\n* The same error will occur when both instance has not set issue security permission configured\n* The error does not occur if JIRA A do not has Set issue security permission configured\n\nh4. Expected behaviour\nWhat is the expected behaviour? A customer asked previously, why is the error occured when trying to copy an issue to a vanilla instance with no Security Level scheme configured. The problem seems to be with the permission for _Set Issue Security_. If this is indeed the expected behaviour, the error thrown should clearly state that the user in Project BB do not has the correct permission.",

Could this field include the key, just as the \"Projects\" navigation menu does? Could this be an option that could be enabled/disabled? Could it also be an option to display the key either before or after the name?\n\nThanks,\nAndrew",

This way, the user can import the required plugin beforehand and use 100% feature from the workflow imported.\n\nBelow is the test that I did to verify the current workflow importing process.\n\nh3. Testing Description\n* Testing the workflow exporting process (.jwb workflow bundle file) in JIRA 6 that is customized with an external workflow third-party party (Ie. JIRA Suite Utilities with custom workflow post-function and validation).\n\nh3. Testing Specification\n* JIRA 6 RC1 installed with third-party plugin: JIRA Suite Utilities\n* JIRA 6 RC1 Vanilla Instance with no plugin installed\n\nh3. What I did\n# Customize workflow in JIRA 6 RC1 installed with third-party plugin: JIRA Suite Utilities with their own post-function and condition\n# Export it as workflow then it would basically generate the (.jwb) file \n# Install a fresh JIRA 6 RC1 Vanilla Instance\n# Import the workflow (.jwb) file into it\n\nh3. Outcome\nIt is successfully being imported. However it only notify us about the additional plugin and configuration information like the following:\n!workflow_successfully_imported.jpg!\nBasically if I need to use the exact same workflow again. I have to delete this workflow, install the plugin and reimport again. This could be a big hassle.\n\nh3. Suggested Improvement\n* In the first step after user click to import. Workflow importer should validate / check the workflow selected, \n* If new plugin is required, it should inform the user with information like below:\n{quote}\nThis workflow require the following plugins:\n* JIRA Suites Utilities\n* JIRA ToolKit\n\nSome features in in workflow will be remove without these plugins. Click cancel to install these plugin or proceed to import the workflow.\n{quote}\n\n* We can even integrate Marketplace into this so that the user can directly install these plugins without leaving workflow importer page.

[See the corresponding bug report|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-33116].\n  {panel}\n\n*Scenarios:*\n# The customer JIRA instance have two user account with same email address and one of them is inactive mode. But, JIRA mail handler not able to create an issue for the active user due of using the same email address as of inactive user. \n# in JIRA Cloud, the Mail Handler is configured with a default reporter. There is a disabled user in the Database with the same email address as the sender. The issue is not created because the mail handler matches the disabled user in the database. This also happens with active users that don't have create issue permission and (New in 2016) JIRA Cloud Deleted users that have issues and remain hidden in the database.\n\nh4. Steps to reproduce the problems:\n*Scenario 1*\n# Create two user (A and B) with same email address.\n# Deactivate user A.\n# Send an email to the user B email address (which should be the same as A) and send to POP/IMAP server.\n# It will get the following warning message from incoming mail log, please see:{noformat}\n2013-05-20 15:52:00,382 WARN [test] QuartzWorker-0 ServiceRunner    test test[10001]: Reporter (testing) does not have permission to create an issue.

Message rejected.\n{noformat}\n\n*Scenario 2*\n# Remove application access for a user in JIRA. The user is now disabled.\n# Send an email with that email address to a Mail Handler with a \"Default Reporter\"\n\nh4. Expected behaviour\nJIRA creates issues because the user has an option to do so.\n\nh4. Actual behaviour\nJIRA doesn't create any issues for the users that have an email address in the database and are either disabled, deleted or without permissions although the Mail Handler allows issue creation with default mail handler or there is another user with that email address.\n\nh4. Workaround\nRe-enable users and give correct permissions for issue creation or trick JIRA by renaming users and email addresses:\n\n*1)* Enable inactive/deleted users\nFailing email addresses for users that were deleted can be manually re-created from the User Management.\n*To detect failing emails:* Set a \"Forward Email\" address in the mail handler to receive notifications when emails fail and then manually grant access to users so the email is processed.\n\n*Manually fixing inactive and deleted users:*\nScenario 1) Check for duplicate email address:\n{code}select lower_email_address from cwd_user group by lower_email_address having count(lower_email_address) > 1;\n{code}\nScenario 2) Find Deleted or disabled users:\n{code}\nselect user_name, first_name, last_name, display_name, email_address, active from cwd_user where active = 0 ;\n{code}\n\n*Steps for Cloud Support to mass re-enable deleted users:*\n# Export deleted users to .csv\n{noformat}copy (SELECT user_name AS \"Username\", first_name AS \"First Name\", last_name AS \"Last Name\", user_name AS \"Email Address\", credential AS \"Password\" FROM cwd_user where active = 0 and display_name like '%[X]') to '/tmp/users-deleted.csv' csv header;{noformat}\n# Remove from the .csv the users that don't cause problems with the emails and don't need to be re-enabled.\n# Use user-csv-importer to re-enable users.\n\n*2)* Assign correct permissions to users so they can create issues or Trick JIRA by changing user_name and email_address to a dummy address. Remember that the mail handler matches incoming emails to email_address and user_name.\n",

Expected Results\nThe create issue AJAX dialog would show all projects and issue types available without any warnings.\n\nh3. Actual Results\nThe create issue AJAX dialog does show all projects and issue types available, but shows the following message:\nbq. Some issue types are unavailable due to incompatible field configuration and/or workflow associations\n\nThis can be seen in the attached video: [^behavior.mp4]\n\nh3. Original Description\n{quote}\n{panel}\nTo reproduce:\n* Setup your JIRA instance so that you have a project/issuetype/workflow combination that shows this warning when you edit an issue (for the issue type field)\n* Edit an issue so that this warning is shown (using the quick edit dialog)\n* Then try to create a new issue. The warning will be shown in the quick create dialog\n* Right click on create issue and open it in a new tab. The warning will not be shown which is the correct behavior.\n\nThe full warning is: \"Some issue types are unavailable due to incompatible field configuration and/or workflow associations.\"\n\nThe root cause is in the FieldHtmlFactoryImpl class.  It has a mutable static final Map of DISPLAY_PARAMS that's passed into both the getCreateHtml() and getEditHtml() field methods. If any of the fields modify this map and set certain params (such as \"restrictedSelection\") then these params will be passed to any subsequent calls as well until the server is restarted so that this map is restored to its inital state!\n\nWe should probably make this map immutable and create mutable copies everytime we call getEditHtml()/getCreateHtml().  Now if only I knew the idiot who wrote this code ;)...\n{panel}\n{quote}",

This is impossible with the current semantics:\n\n* \"issuestatus was closed\" picks up issues that were never reopened.\n* \"issuestatus was closed and issuestatus != closed\" picks up issues that were reopened but misses such issues that were reclosed.\n\nSuch a change in semantics would increase the expressiveness of JQL with no decrease. To reproduce the current semantics, one would query like this:\n\n* \"issuestatus was closed or issuestatus = closed\" \n\nIf it's thought that such a change now would break too many well-established expectations, then consider a new operator: \"was once\", with the semantics I am urging.\n\nBTW, just in terms of natural English, \"was\" is not used when a state of affairs still exists at the point of speech. Consider: \"I was (once) a callow youth and full of hope\". This statement sounds distrinctly wrong when uttered by a person who is still a callow youth, full of hope. :)",
      "summary": "Change semantics of JQL \"was\" operator to exclude issues that currently have the given value."
