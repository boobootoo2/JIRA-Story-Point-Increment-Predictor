The list view will reach Jira Service Desk in the next month and following this will be introduced for Jira Software and Jira Business.\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\n\r\nAtlassian\r\n{panel}\r\nh3. Problem Definition\r\n\r\nCurrently, attachments are displayed as thumbnails in the New Issue View of Jira, as shown in the screenshot below:\r\n !_KAIS-1__Are_you_the_hunter____or_the_prey__-_Jira.png|thumbnail!\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nAllow users to select the \"List\" view for attachments, which is an option available in the Old Issue View:\r\n * !Screen Shot 2018-08-30 at 21.48.31.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nh3. Why this is important\r\n\r\nAnytime an issue in Jira has multiple attached files with long filenames, the current state is likely to pose a problem. Especially when many of those filenames start with the same substring of text. Since the new issue view doesn't guarantee to display the entire filename, it makes it very difficult to quickly see and understand which file is which. A thumbnail of the file is only ever useful to image attachments, whereas having a list view would be beneficial to seeing and sorting all attachments (regardless of type) by their actual filename.\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nNone",

This is available to all customers who have the new issue view enabled. You can find more information here: [https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirasoftwarecloud/configure-field-layout-in-the-issue-view-961798059.html|https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirasoftwarecloud/configure-field-layout-in-the-issue-view-961798059.html]\u00a0\r\n\r\nHere are a couple of key points about this you should know. More detailed info is in the docs link above.\r\n * This only applies to\u00a0classic projects that are using the new issue view. Next-gen project types already have the ability to add/remove/edit the field ordering of the issue view. See [https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirasoftwarecloud/working-with-next-gen-software-projects-945104895.html]\u00a0\r\n * The new Issue Layout option in your project settings is what allows you to order your fields. It still gets the list of available fields from your global screen config that is being applied to the specific issue type you are editing within that project. If you change the ordering this will\u00a0*only* affect the field layout for those issue types within that specific project. The new Issue Layout option is *not* a global setting. It is a per project setting.\r\n * Only project admins and site admins have access to this Issue Layout option. It can be accessed by clicking on the ... within any issue detail view. Or go to your project settings.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, or would like to see some improvements, there is a feedback collector on the Issue Layout edit page. So give us your feedback, we are looking to iterate and improve this moving forward but we are excited about this change. We hope it makes using the new issue view much more enjoyable!\r\n\r\nTaylor Pechacek, Jira Cloud - Sr. PM\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n{panel}\r\nh3. Problem Definition\r\n\r\nPreviously in the old view, the list of the field in view issue screen follow the sequence in Screen configuration.\r\nh3.

Here\u2019s an example of how we do that with Apache HTTP client in one of our services: https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/pf-emoji-service/commits/83f3abaa6ec1d274b6713b14cc4a4f9891b9714e#chg-src/main/java/com/atlassian/product/fabric/emoji/Application.java\r\n\r\nConfluence have observed the same problem in the past: https://product-fabric.atlassian.net/browse/FS-1913\r\n\r\nNote, this particular problem will be solved if/when we switch the Presence service to use Application ELBs which is tracked as https://product-fabric.atlassian.net/browse/FS-2950.

You can read more about that announcement [here|https://www.atlassian.com/blog/announcements/new-atlassian-slack-partnership]. As a result, we will *not* add support for HipChat and Stride to the new issue view.\r\n\r\nTo stay up-to-date with what's happening with the new issue view, watch our documentation [page,|https://confluence.atlassian.com/cloud/blog] which we update when we add new features and functionality.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n Eric\r\n{panel}\r\nProblem Definition\r\n Currently, the new JIRA issue view that is applicable to the full issue view page and board detail view of issues is not displaying the HipChat discussions as it was in the old layout\r\n\r\nSuggested Solution\r\n Add support for this field so it can be shown in the issue details and full view.\r\n\r\nWorkaround\r\n Disable the new JIRA issue view under the Labs section inside the user profile or use the *?oldIssueView=true* at the end of the URL for business and Agility not affected by JIRA lab .",

As part of these changes the uploaded date and time will be displayed. We expect these changes to be delivered to you in the next month.\r\n\r\nNote that in addition to improved attachment cards we are also actively working on bringing a list view to Jira's new issue view. This will provide an alternative way for you to find your attachments and will also include the attachment upload date/time: https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-70146\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\n\r\nAtlassian\r\n{panel}\r\n{panel:title=Atlassian Update - 10 Dec 2019|borderStyle=solid|borderColor=#2684ff|titleBGColor=#2684ff|bgColor=#ffffff}\r\nHi Everyone,\r\n\r\nI want to provide a quick update for this topic. this feature will be in progress soon, *show timestamp on attachments*, and it is being under consideration to be prioritised in the next couple of months. we will keep you posted with the updates. I know this has taken a while to build out, but rebuilding Jira issues is no small feat, so we very much appreciate your patience on this.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, you can opt out of this new issue experience via your *Personal Settings* > *Jira Labs section* will have a 'new issue view' toggle to turn it on or off. We will not be disabling this opt-out option until we have rebuilt all the key features of the Jira issues experience you have come to know and love.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nAtlassian\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\nWhen searching tickets through Issues and Filters, if a ticket has attachments, it shows the date and time that the ticket was attached.\r\n\r\nOn the new issue view, it only shows the attachment's name when we put the mouse over the attachment.\r\n\r\nIt would be great if the new issue view shows the same information as the old view.",

Also it would be useful to have this view filtering by assignee.\u00a0I would like to drag tasks of all the projects in one column (i.e.: to do) upwards or downwards depending on the priority (that varies from day to day).

      "description": "Users would greatly benefit from being able to sort issues using multiple factors/columns. JIRA Cloud could allow the user to have three tiers of column sorting, each tier unable to disengage the effect of the the tier above but nonetheless applying it's own sorting.\r\n\r\nIn order to select which tier is currently editable, the user could give input via 'radio' buttons, drop-down lists, or any other practical UI element; defaulting to first tier.\r\n\r\nThen the user could simply click a column to sort all issues in any list by the column, just as they do now. Say they choose Component for example. They've now found all the issues with, say, a component called \"audio in a list also showing issues in other components; perfect.\r\n\r\nBut now they want to quickly and efficiently get an idea of how many of the 47 audio issues are in each priority level. Currently the user has to use a gadget in the dashboard to visualize the priority distribution of the audio related issues. But they would only need to take another couple seconds to click tier 2 and the priority column; no need to switch away from that page and waste small amounts of valuable time that add-up.\r\n\r\nWith the tier sorting feature, these users will not only be able to have quickly made a visual representation of the their 47 audio issues by priority, but they can also then quickly move to other components already organized by priority by simply scrolling down. A part of this optional feature is configurable headers before the start of the next first-tier sorting field; a relatively thin bar between the last and first issue of (in this case) each component with the total issue count under that first tier category/field/column.  \r\n\r\nBut when they scroll down, they see there are 2467 video component issues. But they know about the one-click refined search feature too! So they simply click the name of the component they want to refine their search with (either using the header or the component name on any issue's row), and JIRA will load up a search that now shows issues with the video component, and remembers your column sorting from a moment ago.\r\n\r\nWhat an incredible help this would be for all of us. Thank you all for your hard work putting together this awesome database system that is JIRA. :)\r\n",
