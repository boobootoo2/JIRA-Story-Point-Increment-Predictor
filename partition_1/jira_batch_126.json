When you select option 2B, the Stash gets created, and previously staged changes no longer appear in the Working Directory.

      "description": "The \u201cResolve Conflicts > Resolve Using \\{Mine|Theirs\\}\u201d commands in SourceTree do not behave as expected. Rather than resolving conflicts according to the selected side, it seems that the ENTIRE FILE is replaced by either \u201cmine\u201d or \u201ctheirs\u201d.\r\n\r\nAs a user, I expect that the successfully auto-merged chunks remain intact (as they first do prior to conflict resolution). Instead, they are unexpectedly reverted.\r\n\r\nVerifying this bug has been made more troublesome by the fact that SourceTree does not log in its command history panel what it's actually doing when I choose a resolve command.\r\n\r\nThe current behaviour renders the \u201cResolve Conflicts\u201d command mostly useless (and indeed dangerous), making a manual treatment (by editing the text of the conflicted merge product) the only way to achieve the correct merge.\r\n\u200b",

Environment\r\n\r\nSourceTree for Mac, reproduced with the latest version, 2.0.5.7. \r\nThis feature is working well in SourceTree for Windows.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n# Open SourceTree in Mac.\r\n# Open a Git repository.\r\n# Right-click the sidebar and select Add/Link Subtree.\r\n# Add a Subtree, with 'Local Relative Path' equal to dir1.\r\n# Right-click the sidebar and select Add/Link Subtree.\r\n# Add a second Subtree, with 'Local Relative Path' equal to dir1/dir2/dir3/dir4.\r\n\r\nh3.

You may want to change that marking.\r\n\r\n@mbasaralusrinivasa asked me to create this issue.",
