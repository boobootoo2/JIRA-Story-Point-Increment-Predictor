I am envisioning an accordion-style group so I can see the repositories I'm woking on at the time (because they are all in the same group).\r\n\r\nNested groups would be even better.

This was also a bitbucket repo.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it is some kind of DNS error which results in resetting the address?

On a whim today, I tried my SSH key password, and it worked. \r\nI think the UI window responsible for requesting the password should be modified to specify that it needs a password for an SSH key rather than 'git@host.com' if Bitbucket wants to try an SSH key that requires a password.\r\nI would provide a screenshot of the window in question but ever since I gave it the correct password it hasn't asked me again.
