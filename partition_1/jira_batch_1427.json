Context\r\nIn Crowd 2.7.0, we had an issue with Crowd generating invalid XML documents due to binary data getting synced to the Crowd cache as the user's external id; we fixed this in 2.7.1 by not skipping syncing any attributes which are not representable in XML to the Crowd LDAP cache (specifically, in CWD-3748).\r\n\r\nh1. Problem\r\nUnfortunately, Novell eDirectory's GUID attribute (which is the default \"User Unique Identifier Attribute\" in Crowd) is [defined to be|http://www.novell.com/documentation/developer/ndslib/schm_enu/data/sdk1198.html] of type [Octet String|http://www.novell.com/documentation/developer/ndslib/schm_enu/data/sdk5652.html], so that attribute often has invalid-for-xml characters and hence is often not sync'd to Crowd's cache.\r\n\r\nh1. Consequence\r\n\r\nUser renames will not be detected for any user whose GUID attribute is not XML safe.\r\n\r\nSafety is determined according to {{com.atlassian.crowd.directory.ldap.util.XmlValidator#isSafe}}.

As the issue hasn't collect votes, watchers, comments, or support cases from many customers during its lifetime, it's very low on our priority list, and will not be fixed in the foreseeable future. That's why we've decided to resolve it as *Timed Out*.\r\n\r\nAlthough we're aware the issue is still important to those of you who were involved in the conversations around it, we want to be clear in managing your expectations.

Please consult the [Atlassian Bugfix Policy|https://confluence.atlassian.com/support/atlassian-server-bug-fix-policy-201294573.html] for more details.\r\n\r\nWe understand how disappointing this decision may be, but we hope you'll appreciate our transparent approach and communication.\r\n\r\nAtlassian will continue to watch this issue for further updates, so please feel free to share your thoughts in the comments.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nCrowd Team\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\nCrowd is throwing some strange database errors about creating tables and foreign keys as the ones below:\r\n{code}\r\nhttp-bio-8095-exec-25 ERROR [hibernate.tool.hbm2ddl.SchemaExport] HHH000389: Unsuccessful: alter table cwd_app_dir_group_mapping drop constraint fk_app_dir_group_mapping\r\nhttp-bio-8095-exec-25 ERROR [hibernate.tool.hbm2ddl.SchemaExport] Table not found: CWD_APP_DIR_GROUP_MAPPING in statement [\r\n    alter table cwd_app_dir_group_mapping]\r\nhttp-bio-8095-exec-25 ERROR [hibernate.tool.hbm2ddl.SchemaExport] HHH000389: Unsuccessful: alter table cwd_app_dir_group_mapping drop constraint fk_app_dir_group_app\r\nhttp-bio-8095-exec-25 ERROR [hibernate.tool.hbm2ddl.SchemaExport] Table not found: CWD_APP_DIR_GROUP_MAPPING in statement [\r\n    alter table cwd_app_dir_group_mapping]\r\nhttp-bio-8095-exec-25 ERROR [hibernate.tool.hbm2ddl.SchemaExport] HHH000389: Unsuccessful: alter table cwd_app_dir_group_mapping drop constraint fk_app_dir_group_dir\r\nhttp-bio-8095-exec-25 ERROR [hibernate.tool.hbm2ddl.SchemaExport] Table not found: CWD_APP_DIR_GROUP_MAPPING in statement [\r\n    alter table cwd_app_dir_group_mapping]\r\nhttp-bio-8095-exec-25 ERROR [hibernate.tool.hbm2ddl.SchemaExport] HHH000389: Unsuccessful: alter table cwd_app_dir_mapping drop constraint fk_app_dir_app\r\nhttp-bio-8095-exec-25 ERROR [hibernate.tool.hbm2ddl.SchemaExport] Table not found: CWD_APP_DIR_MAPPING in statement [\r\n    alter table cwd_app_dir_mapping]\r\nhttp-bio-8095-exec-25 ERROR [hibernate.tool.hbm2ddl.SchemaExport] HHH000389: Unsuccessful: alter table cwd_app_dir_mapping drop constraint fk_app_dir_dir\r\nhttp-bio-8095-exec-25 ERROR [hibernate.tool.hbm2ddl.SchemaExport] Table not found: CWD_APP_DIR_MAPPING in statement [\r\n    alter table cwd_app_dir_mapping]\r\n{code}\r\nCrowd starts normally though.\r\n\r\nThis started to happen in crowd 2.7.x and also happens when using external databases.

Summary\r\n\r\nWhen there are multiple directories and membership aggregation is disabled for an applicatoin, group membership queries require an {{isCanonical}} check on each user. In order to do this {{isCanonical}} finds the user by name in order to shallow the user. This results in n+1 queries to the database. This can cause massive performance issues when the host application (in this case Stash) when calculating licensed user counts.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nIt is not entirely clear at this point how to accurately replicate the problem. It involves configuring nested groups and multiple user directories, then using the application such that it retrieves user groups.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nCrowd retrieves nested groups with minimal performance impact.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nThere is a notable performance impact on the system and it presents with symptoms of performance problems.\r\n\r\nh2. Verification\r\n\r\nCheck for the presence of multiple threads utilising {{com.atlassian.crowd.manager.application.ApplicationServiceGeneric.isCanonical}} and/or {{com.atlassian.crowd.manager.application.ApplicationServiceGeneric.searchNestedGroupRelationships}}.

JIRA delegates this operation to {{ApplicationServiceGeneric.searchNestedGroupRelationships}} in its embedded Crowd. Embedded Crowd is dependent on these classes from Crowd. This can be an expensive calculation which increases with the number of users. Unfortunately the loop inside that method causes many queries to the database, *many of them to fetch the directory mappings which are not cached*.",

A full sync (which sometimes happens although incremental sync is enabled) takes 400-600s on an idle, production-like (i.e. powerful) test system, and can take more than *an hour* in production.\r\nDuring most of the time, there are no requests to crowd, and only one thread is using a CPU core (100%), there are no I/O waits.\r\n\r\nThread dumps show that the culprit is {{com.atlassian.crowd.directory.DbCachingRemoteChangeOperations.findUserMembershipForGroupChanges}}\r\n\r\nThis method shows a few weaknesses:\r\n* {{contains}} lookups are performed that are O\\(n\\)\r\n* {{~n}} lookups are performed, so we have O(n^2)\r\nfirst example is internalMembers:\r\n{code}\r\nList<String> internalMembers = ...\r\n...\r\nfor (String remoteUser : remoteUsers)\r\n{\r\n    if (!internalMembers.contains(remoteUser))\r\n        usersToAdd.add(remoteUser);\r\n}\r\n{code}\r\nsecond is remoteUsers:\r\n{code}\r\n...

This is necessary for the returned list to be a view, but it means that the function will be applied many times for bulk operations like List.contains(java.lang.Object){quote}\r\n** which is exactly what is done here\r\n** so we are not only dealing with O(n^2) comparisons, but also with n^2 invocations of {{toLowerCase}}, while only n would be needed\r\n\r\nSo I did what Google suggests, copy both collections into HashSets and use them for both iteration and {{contains}} lookup.\r\n\r\nResult:\r\nOn the above mentioned test system, the sync takes about *15* seconds (30 times speedup).\r\n\r\nPatch is attached, it was taken from Confluence 5.1.5 (Crowd 2.6.2), but applies cleanly against Crowd 2.7.0 (Confluence 5.4.2), too.\r\n",

As the issue hasn't collect votes, watchers, comments, or support cases from many customers during its lifetime, it's very low on our priority list, and will not be fixed in the foreseeable future. That's why we've decided to resolve it as *Timed Out*.\r\n\r\nAlthough we're aware the issue is still important to those of you who were involved in the conversations around it, we want to be clear in managing your expectations. The Crowd team is focusing on issues that have broad impact and high value, reflected by the number of comments, votes, support cases, and customers interested. Please consult the [Atlassian Bugfix Policy|https://confluence.atlassian.com/support/atlassian-server-bug-fix-policy-201294573.html] for more details.\r\n\r\nWe understand how disappointing this decision may be, but we hope you'll appreciate our transparent approach and communication.\r\n\r\nAtlassian will continue to watch this issue for further updates, so please feel free to share your thoughts in the comments.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nCrowd Team\r\n{panel}\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nWhile using an openldap backend to manage JIRA users, it sticks to use JIRA bind DN to perform the \"Change Password\" task rather than the authenticated DN of current logined user.\r\n\r\nFor some security reasons, the JIRA bind DN is granted limited privileges (such as authenticate, and reading specified fields of a directory) just for binding purpose. Under commonly crics, the user has the write privileges to his/her \"userPassword\" attribute in the directory. So JIRA should provide an option to use the authenticated user's DN to bind the directory while performing \"Change Password\".",

You cannot change the case directly in Crowd, but if AD is connected to Crowd and Crowd is connected to Confluence, when the casing changes in AD this issue occurs)\r\n# Log in to Confluence as the user. \r\n# Go to Admin > Users in Confluence (confirm the password when prompted)\r\n# View your group memberships and confirm you are a member of GROUP1\r\n# Go to the Dashboard\r\n# Click in the top banner to drop admin rights \r\n# Go back to Admin > Users, confirming password again when prompted\r\n# Confirm that you are no longer a member of GROUP1\r\n# Repeat steps 11 - 13 and confirm that you are a member of GROUP1 again\r\n# Repeat again and confirm the membership is gone\r\n\r\nNB: This is similar to old issues that used to occur when the casing changed, but they all occurred on intermittent directory syncs. That does not appear to be occurring anymore, and it is now only authenticating into the admin section of both JIRA and Confluence that causes this issue.",

I think what is happening is that embedded crowd is caching the call to getGroup (so returns null) but the createGroup function goes through the cache and notices that the group exists.\r\n\r\nRequest: After you call createGroup and it notices that the group does exist, it should update the cache. That way I could use this function instead:\r\n\r\n{noformat}\r\nprotected final G getGroupCreateIfNecessary(String groupName) throws Exception\r\n    {\r\n        G group;\r\n        try {\r\n            group = createGroup(groupName);\r\n            logger.info(\"'{}' group created\", groupName);\r\n        } catch(InvalidGroupException ige) {\r\n            logger.debug(\"Turns out the group {} did already exist but was cached.
