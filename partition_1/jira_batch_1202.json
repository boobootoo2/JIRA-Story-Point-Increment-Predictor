So it would take just one click to see these\n3) make release notes available as a tab in a version's view in JIRA.\n\nThanks for very good software otherwise! You, Atlassian guys, are role models for use at MageFlow!\n\nbr,\nSven,\nCTO",

This does not have anything to do with the importance of the issue.\n\nWe are investing heavily in improving performance and slow initial pageloads is one of the focus areas. We've made some progress in the last quarter or two, however, as those of you with performance optimisation experience know, there are many things that contribute to the slow initial pageloads and we need to tackle a laundry list of things in order to make a substantial impact.\n\nIn the meantime, if you are experiencing slow initial page loads I'd love to hear more detail on this ticket, *so pls answer a few questions via this google form: [https://goo.gl/gnltna]*\n\nThanks for your help,\n*Otto Ruettinger*\n*Principal Product Manager, JIRA*\n\n\n\n-----------------------------------\n*Original Description*\nAfter JIRA Cloud is restarted, which occurs once a week for the [maintenance window|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/AOD/Atlassian+OnDemand+maintenance+windows] at a minimum, the very first JIRA page that is loaded can take a very long time to load.\n\nThe time can vary depending on network speed, but from Sydney it has taken up to 25 seconds to load the first page on a completely empty instance.\n\nWe've also identified that JIRA can take up to 20 seconds to load the dashboard simply if you haven't loaded JIRA for about a day.\n\nThe dashboard is the primary page that experiences slowness, however, if you visit any other page first then that page will be the slowest to load.\n\nAfter the initial page load pages of different types, such as the projects page or issue navigator, may take some time on first load (up to 10 seconds during our testing, but you may experience more slowness) while the css and js are downloaded.\n\nOnce everything is cached then pages should be loading at more acceptable speeds (1-4 seconds in our testing).\n\nIf you are continuing to experience performance problems once everything is cached please log a [support ticket|https://support.atlassian.com] and provide a [HAR file|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/ONDEMANDKB/Generating+and+Reading+a+HAR+File+For+Performance+Troubleshooting] of your experience.\n\nAt this stage theres is no workaround, at least one user will experience slowness after a restart, once the javascript and css files are cached though then JIRA will be significantly more responsive.\n\nAtlassian is aware of the slowness experienced by our JIRA Cloud customers, and improving the responsiveness of our applications is of utmost importance to us.",

And what can be great is to have more information about the reporter (in our case a customer). Today when you let your cursor over the reporter field in an issue, you see his name and his email address, but it will be great to have the name of his company, his telephone number and other information. If we could have the possibility to create custom fields in the user profile formular it will be perfect.\n\nCheers",

Especially when combined with bug #2. \n4) Even after resetting correctly, I can't fucking login. I can cut & paste the EXACT form entry, and it won't work. I can manually type it in, in case there's some ridiculous restriction on cut & pasting, and login credentials are still rejected. \n\nPlease fix this festering pile of crap.

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-40166].\n  {panel}\n\nMy impression of JIRA is that it provides some limitations due to its long history. Therefore one should think about some concepts and how to improve them. \n\n*Versions*\nA version is an attribute, it may last from start to end. At the end it will provide a release note.\nOn the other hand, during practical work, a version follows a workflow. At the beginning the content of the version has to be defined. Various dates have to be fixe: start of development, efford, end of development, start of testing, end of testing, same for integration and then go to production. So the content of a version is much more, than the current schema is able to solve. \nWhy not think about a version as a issue of type Version. It may provide a workflow, users can adopt it to their needs. So the idea of converting an attribute to an issue can provide much more flexibility as provided today. Existing concepts in JIRA would support this idea. There would be also the possibility to decompose a Version with \"Development Phase\", \"Test Phase\" to add the timeline required of the corresponding teams. \nI see a simple functionality as precondition: One should be able to define post actions, conditions on sets of transitions. E.g. disable a transition as long there are issues not in step xyz. It should also be possible to transition other issues by post functions. E.g. For go live, I want to transition all solved issues (linked to the version) to the step \"Live\". \n\n*Links*\nThere is no semantic behind links. A link can express specific information, a test case refers to a requirement, also a bug should refer one ore more requirements as justification, otherwise one should create a change request. Also a change request should link to requirements it affects. It should be possible to calculate information based on sets of linked issues. E.g. \"Development Phase\" recieves an \"Estimated Efford\" from all linked \"Development Tasks\". \n\n*Durable and project issues*\nA requirement lives much longer as projects changing the product. So one could distinghuish issues which are descriptive like test plan, test case or requirement. Other issues exist temporarily during phases of a project. These issues may have strong relations, because the project issues change, create or delete the durable issues. This can be understood as issues reflecting the state of the product, which may be changed by several projects in parallel. \n\n*Realistic Workflow for large environments*\nThere is a great difference between the workflow of artefacts like issues and the workflow of some kind of tasks in a project. E.g. Since there may be many customers, one would like to separate the issues in customer related projects. The development is controlled by development projects. If the customer raises an issue (bug, new requirement, ...) the overall workflow will require to create one or more development tasks in the corresponding developer project. At the moment I do not see any functionality suporting this level. \n\nMy thoughts may be not concrete enough to start directly an implementation on it. But I want to tell, that I see a lot of gaps in the product. ",

Some of these plugins will require a re-index to work as expected and today the Project Admins have to email the JIRA Admin requesting this re-index. This is an un-necessary and inefficient step in my opinion.\n\nIf this also could be configurable globally whether Project Admins shall be able to do this it would be great!\n\nAnd if you could maybe even define what projects shall have this possibility it would add even more value! \n\nAre there any technical reasons for not allowing this?\n\nCheers,\n// Svante",

Ironically, Atlassian removed the tools literally a day or two after I started using them.\n\nI understand why the JIRA Classic prototype has been removed. After all, \"[removing the duplication to avoid confusion\" is what we're trying to do with our Schemes and Workflows. And the Project Management type provides the same functionality, so nothing is lost to the user.\n\nBut the Scheme Tools don't duplicate any other functionality and nothing has been provided to replace them. If Atlassian believes these tools don't add value, they are wrong. Customers who don't use them will ignore them. \n\nCustomers who do use them (like me) see that they DO add value. I don't see how the removal benefits anyone, but how it makes things more difficult for some customers is clear. Please make sure that whoever is in charge knows this. If they would care to contact me directly, I'd appreciate it.",

Problem Description\n\nWhen customer upload a JPEG which is large (>100MB), it requires a lot of memory to generate the Thumbnail (e.g. in avatar picker) of the image and the instance crashes with OOME.\n\nIt would be better if there is an error message or limit handling when it captures the size of the file and drop the thumbnail generation to ensure the instance is still running. Instead of allowing and later the instance crashes everytime the issue is loaded.\nIn case of avatar picker JIRA should reject request informing user that image is too big and that smaller image should be used.\n\nh3. Steps to replicate\n\n# Get a huge dimension picture file (Eg, 2988 x 5312) \n# Upload it as an avatar\n# High possibility the instance will run into OOME\n\nh3. Expected Result\n\nTo have warning telling that image is too big, or alternatively, drop the thumbnail rendering for the file with error message.\n\nh3. Workaround\n\nTo use a smaller size image file for avatar",

If the reviewer does not approve the pull request, he declines the pull request and JIRA transitions the issue back to \"In Progress\".\n\nSince an issue can only be assigned to a single user, the assignee can only be set to a reviewer if there is only one. I suggest that you add the following post functions that can only be used if Stash is linked to JIRA:\n\n- Assign to single reviewer (keep assignee for multiple reviewers)\n- Assign to pull request creator\n- Remove assignee (could be used for multiple reviewer scenarios)",
