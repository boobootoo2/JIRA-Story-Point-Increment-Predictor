By using the Component value we can automatically assign the job raised to the component lead.  What we would also like to do is to automatically assign the job to a specific release.  In most of our projects we create a Pending release that all new work is placed in, in this particular project we have one Pending release per piece of software that is managed by the project.  When someone raises a job for say the notification utility, it would be great to have the job automatically assigned to the notification pending release.

I'm sure, as with most things, this is easy to envision but probably very difficult to program and implement.  But maybe one day?",

Create a user with a special character in both the username and the password.  \"jos\u00e9\" is a convenient example (You can probably enter it using option-e followed by another e on a Mac or holding down Alt while typing 0233 on the numeric keypad on Windows.)\n2. Verify that the new user can log in using the same browser on the same platform.\n3. Attempt to log in using a different browser on a different platform.  Frequently, this does not work.\n\nThe problem seems to be that the password field's character set depends on the platform and browser settings.  On my Mac, I found that Chrome and Safari on the Mac were generally compatible with one another, but neither would interoperate with Firefox on the Mac or with IE8/9 running on a Windows system.\n\nI think what's happening here is that (at least as far as I can see) the input form does not specify the accept-charset HTML attribute, leaving the choice up to the browser.  Form submission is not necessarily constrained to use the same charset as the HTML that created the form.\n\nMy understanding is that you can use accept-charset=\"UTF-8\" in the form element to force most browsers to use that encoding for their data.  IE apparently ignores this but can be convinced to behave itself by including a (hidden) input with a value like U+2620 (SKULL AND CROSSBONES), to force it to use UTF-8 form the whole form.\n\nNote that usernames are not affected; this only seems to impact the password.  Naturally, none of this matters if you can convince users that they should stick with ASCII-only passwords.",

[See the corresponding bug report|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-26808].\n  {panel}\n\nQuartz 1.5.1 has the following code on its _org.quartz.JobExecutionContext_ constructor:\n\n{code}\n    public JobExecutionContext(Scheduler scheduler,\n            TriggerFiredBundle firedBundle, Job job) {\n...\n        this.jobDataMap.setMutable(false);\n        this.trigger.getJobDataMap().setMutable(false);\n    }\n{code}\n\nThe _setMutable_ method of the trigger's _JobDataMap_ implementation, _org.quartz.utils.DirtyFlagMap_, looks like this:\n\n{code}\n    public void setMutable(boolean mutable) {\n        this.locked = !mutable;\n        if(locked)\n            map = Collections.unmodifiableMap(map);\n        else\n            map = new HashMap(map);\n    }\n{code}\n\nIf the caller passes in _mutable false_ (and the state does not get changed in the meanwhile), the internal map will be decorated with the _java.util.Collections.UnmodifiableMap_.\n\nThis code is quite dangerous, because as it seems the above mentioned caller (_JobExecutionContext_ constructor) is the only caller in the framework. If a job runs with a high-frequency for a few weeks, the reference chain could grow to a level where an iteration over the map's entries could result in an exhaustions of the thread's max stack size.\n\nThe code was introduced somewhere in between Quartz 1.4.5 (the version JIRA was on before) and 1.5.1. It was removed as part of [QUARTZ-458|http://jira.opensymphony.com/browse/QUARTZ-458] for 1.6, thus upgrading to this version should remove the threat of building up a harmful state.\n\nThe caller iterating over the trigger's _JobDataMap_ is yet to be identified. This is due to the nature of the logging of the _StackOverflowError_ not containing the root stack frame anymore. It would be enough if _setMutable(true)_ is called after a couple of weeks, thus the _HashMap_ constructor would iterate over the map in order to attach the values and would thus hit the _StackOverflowError_. Now we know that the actual call has to be in the Quartz thread executing JIRA's _ServiceRunner_, since its run method does not reference the _jobExecutionContext_ anywhere. \n\nMy guess would be that it is _job = qs.getJobFactory().newJob(firedBundle)_ in _org.quartz.core.JobRunShell.initialize(QuartzScheduler, TriggerFiredBundle)_ which would either have to directly iterate over the trigger's _JobDataMap_ or construct sth. which would do that lazily in order to satisfy the contract as laid out in _org.quartz.JobDataMap_:\n\n{quote}\nThe _JobExecutionContext_ passed to a Job at execution time also contains a convenience _JobDataMap_ that is the result of *merging the contents of the trigger's _JobDataMap_ (if any)* over the _Job_'s _JobDataMap_ (if any).\n{quote}\n\nE.g. org.quartz.simpl.PropertySettingJobFactory does the following:\n\n{code}\n    public Job newJob(TriggerFiredBundle bundle) throws SchedulerException {\n\n        Job job = super.newJob(bundle);\n        \n        JobDataMap jobDataMap = new JobDataMap();\n        jobDataMap.putAll(bundle.getJobDetail().getJobDataMap());\n        jobDataMap.putAll(bundle.getTrigger().getJobDataMap());\n\n        setBeanProps(job, jobDataMap);\n        \n        return job;\n    }\n{code}\n\nIf this theory is correct, every JIRA instance >= 4.3 will eventually run into this problem if not being restarted.",

The key field in the JSON will be BBB-234.\n - -the REST API should return a code 302 with the self URL of the moved issue to the new location.- (JIRA will not 302 in this case)\n\n\nBTW, I was hoping to workaround the problem with a JQL query like:\n{noformat}\n\"issuekey\" was \"AAA-123\"\n{noformat}\n\nbut the \"was\" keyword doesn't seem to be present in JIRA 4.4.3.\n\nThat issue is also present in the SOAP API, although I'm sure fixing only REST would be sufficient as we're all moving that API anyway ;)\n",

As you type in the subject it's performing some sort of a SQL full-text comparison of what you typed to the Question table. They also perform this when you enter the actual body of your question (analogous to JIRA's Description field).

Customer of OnDemand tries to connect to their JIRA using IntelliJ Connector. On testing the connection (which amounts to a SOAP-based login), they get the response code like the one in summary. This seems to be the same response as ones in JRA-25048 and JRA-26770. However, these issues seem to happen when JIRA is being restarted.

This would alleviate the need to do a JDK download and installation and muck around with the Jira home/path variables to get a stack trace. This download is doubly problematic because you probably have to go through Oracle's complex process for getting an older version of the JDK to match the Jira distribution because you don't want to add a Java update to the mix at [tarfu|http://www.futilitycloset.com/2009/10/03/reporting-in/] time. :)\n\nI also attach a batch file to get the tomcat PID and the other bits required to generate the stack trace, view it and save it in a text file with a time-stamped file name.  In a single click. Also works with Confluence. This version saves the file in the stack trace in the current directory, this could possibly be improved to a standard location like the log folder. You might like to distribute this as a support tool or something.\n\n\n",
