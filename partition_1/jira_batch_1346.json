This option is available under\u00a0\"Domains\" in\u00a0Site administration. For more info, check out our documentation on\u00a0[Managed accounts and domain claim verification|https://confluence.atlassian.com/purchasing/managed-accounts-and-domain-claim-verification-846071711.html].\r\nh3. *A bit about our vision*\r\n\r\nAt Atlassian we believe that everyone should be able to collaborate together in teams to create amazing things, and do so with the confidence their data is safe.\u00a0[Find out more about our vision|https://confluence.atlassian.com/cloud/atlassian-cloud-collaboration-basics-873871187.html].\r\n\r\nWe've designed Atlassian account as your single passport into any team you collaborate with on Atlassian cloud products. By authenticating with Atlassian account you gain the ability to navigate between all the teams you are a member of, without the need to revalidate who you are.\u00a0With an Atlassian account, it's easy to join and be invited to collaborate.\r\n\r\nWhen teams form, they often work on sensitive information. We understand that protecting this information is paramount for many teams and organisations. We aim to provide the administrators of teams as well as the members within those teams with tools to protect themselves and their data.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n*So what's next?*\r\n*We are progressively upgrading all our cloud customers to Atlassian account and expected to complete this roll out by early May 2017.*\u00a0\r\n\r\nWe recommend\u00a0[verifying your user's email domain(s)\u00a0|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/Cloud/Domain+verification]before upgrading to\u00a0[Atlassian account|https://confluence.atlassian.com/cloud/atlassian-account-for-users-873871199.html]\u00a0to maintain continuity of your password policy. Once we switch you to Atlassian account, your password policy will apply to all users on verified domain(s) when Atlassian account is enabled.\u00a0Users will not be logged out during this transition and they will continue to have access to the site, without the need to change their password.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n*Stay in contact with us*\r\nWe'd like to continue to work with you to understand your specific use case and how any of these changes affect you.
