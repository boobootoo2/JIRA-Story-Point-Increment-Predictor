      "description": "{panel:title=2018.05.26 Update|titleBGColor=#deebff|bgColor=#deebff}\r\nWe received several reports from customers, that the problem occurred also in Fisheye/Crucible 4.5.1 and higher.\r\n Version 4.5.1 contains a fix for a bug we found (missing OSGI import caused @PostConstruct to be not executed by Spring, resulting in events not being sent). We decided to re-open this issue in order to check if there is a second bug causing this faulty behaviour. If you happened to upgrade to *4.5.0*, we still recommend upgrading to 4.5.1 or higher, as the fix delivered in 4.5.1 reduces occurrence factor.\r\n{panel}\r\n----\r\n{panel:title=2018.08.30 Update|titleBGColor=#deebff|bgColor=#deebff}\r\nOur investigation revealed that the new customer reports about missing data in the Development panel are caused by the problem with Jira synching mechanism. Crucible correctly pushes events about new commits as well as correctly responds to Jira queries about particular issue key. Therefore, a fix for cached data not being refreshed has to be implemented in Jira, please vote and watch the JSWSERVER-16760 bug report.\r\n{panel}\r\n----\r\n{panel:title=2018.12.12 Update|titleBGColor=#deebff|bgColor=#deebff}\r\nThe JSWSERVER-16760 bug has been fixed and is pending public release in Jira \r\n 7.6.11, 7.13.1 and 8.0.0.\r\n{panel}\r\n----\r\n{panel:title=Note on the Fix}\r\nThe fix only ensures that the problem won't happen again to new data. Existing data that got affected in an earlier version won't be fixed automatically. For example,\u00a0the DevPanel still doesn't show up for some issues that have commit links, but if we make a new commit to the issue then all will show thanks to the fix.\r\nh4. Workaround for a single issue\r\n\r\nIn such a case, what we can do is to manually delete the fusion cached data related to the issue in the Jira database. For example, if you discover that issue ABC-123 is affected (it has 1 commit but DevPanel doesn't show), you may:\r\n # Run this REST call to confirm it has 1 commit:\r\n{code:java}\r\n<FeCru_BaseURL>/rest/remote-link-aggregation/latest/aggregation?globalId=ABC-123\r\n{code}\r\n # Run this SQL query in Jira db to confirm Jira has an outdated record of it (no commit):\r\n{code:java}\r\nselect * from entity_property where json_value like '%\"ABC-123\"%';\r\n{code}\r\nFor JIRA 7.9+, run this query instead:\r\n{code:java}\r\nselect * from AO_575BF5_DEV_SUMMARY where json like '%\"ABC-123\"%';\r\n{code}\r\n(+) If there're more than 1 entry, get the ID of the one whose property_key (or provider_source_id for JIRA 7.9+) is FeCru's applinks ID.\r\n # If the above are confirmed, it's safe to delete the db entry for it to be rewritten with up-to-date data:\r\n{code:java}\r\ndelete from entity_property where id = <ID from the above SELECT query>;\r\n{code}\r\nFor JIRA 7.9+, run this query instead:\r\n{code:java}\r\ndelete from AO_575BF5_DEV_SUMMARY where id = <ID from the above SELECT query>;\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nh4. Workaround to flush the entire cache in Jira\r\n # Run the query to get the information about the app link in Jira:\r\n{code:sql|bgColor=#f8f8f8}\r\nSELECT SUBSTR(a.property_key,16,36) as \"Application Key\", b.propertyvalue as \"Application Name\" FROM propertyentry a join propertystring b on a.id=b.id where a.property_key like 'applinks.admin%name';\r\n{code}\r\n # Delete the app link from the Jira side\r\n # Delete the app link from the FeCru side\r\n # Take a backup of the Jira database\r\n # Stop Jira to make a DB update\r\n # Delete all entries relating to the FeCru app link from *entity_property*. For example, if \"fa55abbf-804c-31fd-8d07-1878e61b9766\" is the app-link for FeCru:\r\n{code:sql|bgColor=#f8f8f8}\r\nDELETE FROM entity_property WHERE PROPERTY_KEY LIKE '%fa55abbf-804c-31fd-8d07-1878e61b9766%';\r\n{code}\r\nFor JIRA 7.9+, run this query instead:\r\n{code:sql|bgColor=#f8f8f8}\r\nDELETE FROM AO_575BF5_DEV_SUMMARY WHERE JSON LIKE '%fa55abbf-804c-31fd-8d07-1878e61b9766%';\r\n{code}\r\n # Re-install the app link between Jira and FeCru\r\n # Validate that issues now show updated commit information\r\n\r\nh5. Important notes on the workaround above\r\n * The workaround must be tested on a copy of Jira before executing in production.\r\n * We have observed that Jira issues will get added to the *entity_property* table as users browse them. At some point, Jira pulled changes for all issues from FeCru as well. This leads us to think this operation may be expensive and makes it safer to run the workaround in production outside of peak hours.\r\n * A few hours after the workaround is run, we need to count the number of records from the query:\r\n{code:sql|bgColor=#f8f8f8}\r\nSELECT * FROM entity_property WHERE PROPERTY_KEY LIKE '%fa55abbf-804c-31fd-8d07-1878e61b9766%';\r\n{code}\r\n{panel}\r\n{panel:title=Original Description}\r\nh3. Steps to reproduce.\r\n # Fisheye 4.5.0 JIRA version doesn't matter\r\n # Perform a smart commit with any kinds of tags of any size\r\n\r\nh3. Expected results.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the commits are available in Fisheye, the JIRA ticket is updated accordingly.\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nEverything is updated in JIRA except for the Dev Panel. It will take up to 30 minutes for the changesets to show up. After the first branch and commit are available, the number is not updated properly but if you click on the links, all of the branches and changesets appear as expected in the popup.\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nN/A as of now. Clicking on the already available links will reveal the true information, but the first one there is no workaround.\r\n{panel}",

With many deleted repositories and a large cross repository index this can slow down the start of Fisheye&Crucible.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nIndex repositories. \r\n\r\nRemove repositories via one of the following:\r\n * user admin panel\r\n * REST API: DELETE\u00a0/rest-service-fecru/admin/repositories/repository-name\r\n * manually from config.xml\r\n\r\nRestart instance. Time required for startup increases. \r\n\r\n \r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nFisheye successfully cleans cross-repository index and performs it only once.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nFisheye on every start will try to clean the cross repository index and fail silently. Startup time is much longer, which can be identified by amount of time which passes between \"Starting plugin system\" and \"Starting mail system\" log messages.\r\n\r\n{noformat}\r\n2017-09-23 12:56:22,020 INFO - Starting database...\r\n2017-09-23 12:56:22,595 INFO - BoneCP - tracking statements enabled for pool [mainPool]\r\n2017-09-23 12:56:24,510 INFO - BoneCP - tracking statements enabled for pool [retriablePool]\r\n2017-09-23 12:56:24,947 INFO - Database started.\r\n2017-09-23 12:56:27,396 INFO - Starting plugin system...  <<<<<\r\n2017-09-23 13:19:26,622 INFO - Starting mail system...   <<<<<  over 20 minutes elapsed\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\n\r\nh3.

Workaround\r\n\r\nThe following alternative options are available as a workaround:\r\n # *(Preferred)* Convert the repository to a Unicode one in Perforce.\r\n # Add the {{fisheye.ignore.p4.client.errors=true}} property to the {{JVM system properties}} (see [JVM system properties - Atlassian Documentation|https://confluence.atlassian.com/fisheye/jvm-system-properties-298976942.html] and [Environment variable|https://confluence.atlassian.com/fisheye/environment-variables-298976934.html]). This can be achieved in the following way:\r\n ## add the following to the {{$FISHEYE_INST/system.properties}} file\r\n{noformat}\r\nfisheye.ignore.p4.client.errors=true\r\n{noformat}\r\n ## add the following to the {{FISHEYE_OPTS}} environment variable\r\n{noformat}\r\n-Dfisheye.ignore.p4.client.errors=true\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nh3. Solution\r\n\r\nFisheye allows you to define encoding for Perforce repository.\r\nBefore Fisheye 4.6.1 this encoding was used only to process Perforce output. In Fisheye 4.6.1 and later, also input commands are constructed with encoding that is readable by Perforce.\r\n\r\nTo make sure that the Fisheye input is readable for the Perforce repository,\r\nrepository encoding has to be set according to the file paths encoding in the repository.\r\n\r\nFor example, if a committer uses Windows machine with windows-1252 (\u201cWestern Europe\") character set as their default encoding, the same encoding must be set in Fisheye.\r\n\r\n\u00a0",

However, FishEye will not process email notifications for older changesets, which is the situation of the changeset pushed by user A later on.\r\n\r\nThe logic below (found in the source code) only triggers the email to be sent if the change has been performed after the {{lastChecked}} value:\r\n{code}\r\nprivate List<ChangeSet> checkWatch(FecruUser user, Watch watch, RepositoryEngine rep, Principal principal) throws DbException {\r\n...\r\nlong lastChecked = watch.getLastChecked();\r\n...\r\nif (revLastMod > lastChecked) {\r\n...\r\nwatch.setLastChecked(revLastMod);\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nh3.

      "description": "We currently don't have any documentation explaining what happens when customers need to reduce the user tier allowed by a new license and they have more users in the instance than the new license will allow. There should be one FAQ for Fisheye and another one for Crucible containing the following.\r\n\r\nHere are some questions from a customer, and our answers in red, that could be added to this new documentation:\r\nh3. Question 1:\r\n\r\n*We are going to reduce the license for Fisheye & Crucible from unlimited to a fix # of licenses. Say if we have only 50 user licenses for Fisheye and Crucible, but the Active Directory security group has 100 users, how is Fisheye/Crucible going to behave? Will it stop the 51st user to log in?*\r\n {color:#ff0000}\r\n All users will still be able to login, but:\r\n * *Regular users* won't be able to use the instance at all, as this screen will be presented whenever they try to browse repositories or work on reviews:\r\n !Screen Shot 2017-06-21 at 16.00.42.png|width=1200!\r\n *Administrator users* will still be able to reach the administration panel though, in order to fix whatever needs fixing, by accessing http://<site-url>/admin/admin.do directly in the web browser and typing the [Administration Page Password|https://confluence.atlassian.com/fisheye/how-to-reset-the-administration-page-password-in-fisheye-or-crucible-298977083.html] which can be reset if they don't happen to remember it.{color}\r\nh3. Question 2:\r\n\r\n*Is this license by name or unnamed license and just based on the pool?*\r\n {color:#ff0000}\r\n All you need to do is make sure that the number of users being synced from Crowd does not exceed the number of users allowed by the FishEye/Crucible licenses. Following your example, you cannot sync more than 50 users into FishEye/Crucible.\r\n This usually means doing the following:\r\n * Making sure that the Crowd groups being synced into FishEye / Crucible have up to 50 users associated to them.\r\n * That the [Global permissions|https://confluence.atlassian.com/fisheye/global-permissions-812222809.html] are configured correctly for these Crowd groups.{color}\r\nh3. Question 3:\r\n\r\n*So all can log in, but who takes the priority? If there are 51 users in the AD group, and only 5 people log in, can this 51st user log in and do the work because the other 45 are not in?*\r\n {color:#ff0000}\r\n It's not the number of users currently logged in that is taken in consideration. When we took that screenshot attached in my previous comment, only one user was logged into the instance.\r\n In your example, all 100 users will still be able to login regardless of how many are logged in at the moment, but they won't be able to do anything else.\r\n What is taken in consideration is the number of users granted access to Fisheye and / or to Crucible in [Global permissions|https://confluence.atlassian.com/fisheye/global-permissions-812222809.html].{color}\r\nh3. Question 4:\r\n\r\n*So in order words, the first 50 users who granted the login, will be in. Then no matter if these 50 users log in or not, the 51 user can\u2019t do anything in Fisheye/Crucible, until 1 user removed from the group?*\r\n {color:#ff0000}\r\n Exactly, but there are two addendums: only the 50 users granted access will be allowed to login. Any other user not granted access will not be able to login, no matter how many users are logged into the instance at that moment, until one of the 50 users allowed is removed from the group *and* the user not yet granted access is added to the group *and* the Crowd directory configured in FishEye /Crucible is resynced.{color}",

      "description": "I'm using FishEye to index Git repositories on a [Gerrit server|https://www.gerritcodereview.com/]. I noticed that while indexing the repositories FishEye takes a lot of time. Investigating further I noticed that when I \"start\" the repository FishEye uses the following command to fetch it:\r\n{noformat}\r\n/usr/bin/git fetch https://user:XXXX@gerrit.example.com/code +refs/\\*:refs/\\*\r\n{noformat}\r\nThe problem seems to be the refspec used to fetch ({{+refs/\\*:refs/\\*}}). As you may know, Gerrit uses special references under {{refs/changes}} to keep the history of commit revisions. When FishEye fetches the repository it brings all this history which is irrelevant for the purposes we want to use FishEye to. One of our repositories has ~11.000 references under {{refs/changes}}.\r\n\r\nI opened a support issue and was told that currently there is no way to specify a different refspec. *So, I'm asking for an new feature to be implemented so that when I configure a Git repository in FishEye I can specify the refspec that it will use to fetch from the repository.*\r\n\r\nI'd also like to argue that the default refspec should be different. I think it should be {{+refs/heads/\\*:refs/heads/\\*}} and {{+refs/tags/\\*:refs/tags/\\*}} so that by default FishEye would index only the repository's branches and tags.\r\n\r\nAs it currently is ({{+refs/\\*:refs/\\*}}) FishEye brings from the remote Git repository things we usually wouldn't be interested in. In the case of Gerrit, it brings all the review history under {{refs/changes}}, which is irrelevant. There are other tools which use other reference namespaces for bookkeeping and that would potentially cause problems too. For instance, the [SubGit|https://subgit.com/] convertion tool which keeps under {{refs/svn}} several bookkeeping references. Another one is the command {{git-filter-branch}} which keeps references under {{refs/original}}. If I use any of these tools I will \"polute\" the reference namespace and FishEye will try to bring them all and index them with no purpose.\r\n\r\nThank you for your attention!",

Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Integrate FishEye 4.2.1 with JIRA (tested with JIRA 6.4.14 and JIRA 7.2.6) through Application Links\r\n# Ensure that OAuth consumer token has been accepted in both sides, allowing you to see JIRA issue details in FishEye side and commits / reviews in the JIRA issue\r\n# (Likely optional) Create a user mapping, just to make sure that the repository committer will be mapped to a FishEye user\r\n# Enable debug logging in FishEye\r\n# Commit code using smart commits, and containing {{#time 1d}} in the commit message\r\n# Wait until FishEye the new commit shows up in the repository activity stream\r\n# Reload the JIRA ticket, ensuring to be in the {{Work Log}} tab, and check that the time was not logged.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nAccording to [Using Smart Commits|https://confluence.atlassian.com/fisheye/using-smart-commits-298976812.html] it should be possible to use the time unit 'd', respective to days, and it should log the number of days specified before the 'd' character in the issue.\r\n\r\nh3.

(This problem didn't happen when using *SVNKit*.)\r\nThis is different problem from the one which is mentioned in [this KB|https://confluence.atlassian.com/fishkb/fisheye-renders-binary-file-in-svn-repository-as-text-792498092.html]. Even if {{svn:mime-type}} of the file is set to {{application/octet-stream}}, this problem could be reproduced.\r\nh3. Environment\r\n * Ubuntu 16.04\r\n * SVN 1.9.3\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Create a SVN repository\r\n # Add any file to the repository and commit it (revision 1)\r\n (i) This step is important. I couldn't reproduce this problem in case that I added the problematic file in the initial commit.

Expected Results\r\n\r\n\"(test).pptx\" should be handled as binary.\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\n\"(test).pptx\" was handled as text.\r\nh3.
