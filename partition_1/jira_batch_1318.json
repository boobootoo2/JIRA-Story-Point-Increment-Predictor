Notes\r\nIt appears there are several older versions of Jira that are end of life, such as 6.3.x up through 7.1.x that are still listed as compatible for many portfolio versions per [Portfolio for Jira - Version history|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1212136/portfolio-for-jira/version-history].   So this leads customers to have an expectation that their older version of Jira can still use the very latest version of Portfolio, when that does not currently seem to be the case.\r\n\r\nh3.Workaround\r\nI found other versions of Portfolio do not seem to have this problem.  You could work around this problem by following these steps:\r\n# Uninstall Portfolio from the UPM (Add-ons -> Manage Add-ons).  Be sure to remove all 3 Portfolio addons listed there\r\n# Download another version such as 2.2.6 from https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1212136/portfolio-for-jira/version-history \r\n# save this file to your local machine\r\n# In Jira on the manage add-ons page, there is a link to 'Upload add-ons', click this\r\n# select the downloaded package to install this older version of portfolio that works with your version of Jira.\r\n",

We just had to share it with you.\u00a0\r\n\r\nOur organization thrives on Kanban boards but the Roadmaps created by Portfolio are amazing for seeing the big picture too. But as we all know the big picture sometimes changes. This is where our big idea comes in. We thought it would be really \"cool\" and useful if there was a way to capture snapshots of the Roadmap over time throughout the year so a team could look back and see how the Roadmap has changed. This would also be useful for sharing with our business owners so they can see how their decisions, over time, can have an impact on other projects and people resources. Now, go create a \"Snapshot\" feature and be even more amazing!!\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nThe Enterprise Information Technology Team\r\nat Montana Dakota Utilities.",

There appears to be an expectation that the target end date of an unestimated issue will impact the scheduled start date of blocked issues when this is not the case. Another issue (https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JPOSERVER-2323) has been raised to make some changes to the scheduling algorithm, but it might be prudent to update the existing documentation in the meantime to clarify the situation.\r\n\r\nThese the suggested pages to consider improving (although there may be others):\r\n * [https://confluence.atlassian.com/jiraportfoliocloud/scheduling-unestimated-items-based-on-default-estimates-844236853.html]\r\n * [https://confluence.atlassian.com/jiraportfoliocloud/add-target-start-and-target-end-dates-868977060.html]\r\n\r\nh3.

      "description": "Based on my testing of this option in Portfolio for Jira with customers, I think that the sub-task Option Issue Import Level should be removed and documentation improved.\r\n\r\nIn summary here is the issue and the recommendation:\r\n\r\nPortfolio for Jira has an option called _Issue Import Level_ for building the schedule. There are a number of possible options and this feedback is related specifically to the Sub-Task option. \r\n\r\nIn summary: \r\n When you set the option for *Issue Assignee Import Level to Story*, Portfolio for Jira correctly handles this Use case:\r\n 1) Story with no sub-tasks - it imports the actual Jira assignee into Portfolio\r\n 2) Story with Sub-tasks - it imports the assignee on the Sub-tasks\r\n\r\nWhen you set the option for *Issue Assignee Import Level to Sub-Tasks*, Portfolio for Jira seems to get confused:\r\n 1) Story with no sub-tasks - it FAILS to import the actual Jira assignee into Portfolio\r\n 2) Story with Sub-tasks - it imports the assignee on the Sub-tasks\r\n\r\nBased on this logic, I think that the Sub-Task option should be removed since it provides no value and handles a very limited USE case that is not representative of what happens in the real world. The Sub-Task option is *assuming that if a Team uses Sub-Task it will have Sub-Tasks for EVERY story*. This is a very Corner Case which I think is Extremely rare based on the realities of what teams do on a daily basis. I have yet to find a team that uses Sub-Tasks so diligently that they will create Sub-Tasks for every Story.\r\n\r\nTherefore, why have an option that brings no real value to the product? I propose that this Option be removed. It only causes confusion to your end-users. If not you should at least document how this option works and the assumptions that the Portfolio makes around this option.\r\n\r\nOne final comment on the Documentation you have at this link:\r\n\r\n[https://confluence.atlassian.com/jiraportfolioserver/mapping-issue-assignees-to-team-members-868977966.html]\r\n\r\nIt is great to talk about EPIC's and Stories but you don't cover the next level down which is where the problem is. The customers I work with set this value to Story and Portfolio is correctly handling even the next level down into Sub-Tasks. There is nothing in your documentation about what to expect when a customer uses a mix of issue Hierarchies in the SAME Jira project:\r\n\r\n1) EPIC-Stories,\r\n\r\n2) EPIC-Stories-Sub-Tasks,\r\n\r\n3) Stories-Sub-Tasks\r\n\r\nwhich is what happens in the industry all the time. This is actually working correctly now when you use the Story and EPIC Issue Assignee Import level settings and I recommend documenting it.",
