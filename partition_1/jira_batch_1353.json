      "description": "*Original ticket: August 2018 -*\u00a0https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/I18N-2582\r\n\r\nThere are some Italian translations that are not accurate and need to be re-corrected. Below is the list:-\r\n|English|Current italian Jira|Supposed to be|\r\n|Issue|Problema|Segnalazione|\r\n|Reporter|Reporter\u00a0|Segnalante|\r\n|Assignee|Incaricato|Assegnatario|\r\n|Customer Request Type|Customer Request Type|?|\r\n|(to) Browse\u00a0|\u00a0Esplorare|\u00a0Sfogliare|\r\n{quote}The main problem arose on the \"issue\" concept itself.\r\n\r\nIn the current translation \"issue\" was translated as \"problema\", that in italian means \"trouble\". So, when a user has to \"Create an issue\", in italian it will appear as a \"Create trouble\" (hence the hilarious result, in fact a user would search a solution for a problem, but doesn't want to create troubles at all!)\r\n\r\nIn my previous translation (dated 2016), i used the word \"segnalazione\", which is near to the more general concept of \"ticket\" (similar to \"request\").\r\n\r\nIn addition think that at least two other terms should be re-translated. Excel file attached.\r\nBut beware: in italian (as well as in other languages), female and male word genders exist.\r\n\"Problema\" is male gender, \"Segnalazione\" is female; so there are many phrases with adjectives that should also be retranslated according to the word gender.\r\n{quote}\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n*Update: June 30th*\r\n\r\nSome time ago we raised an issue (https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/I18N-2582) regarding some terms translated in a very questionable way from English to Italian. Now, almost two years later, having made the upgrade of Jira server from 7.11.2 to *8.5.5*\u00a0(incidentally this version in not even selectable in the Affects Version/s field below), we bitterly discovered that none of our suggestions have been taken into account.\r\n\r\nAs after the last update, we were forced to perform a full translation of some key terms on all the files contained in the language pack, bringing the situation back to an acceptable level (and I will not hide that it is a long and alienating job, having required 3 full days of work).\r\n\r\nI will be able to provide to you the jar file containing our changes, hoping that you can integrate them into future Jira server versions, with the advantage of not having to proceed with the burden of a new translation work on your part (alas, i see that the _Attachement field_\u00a0is missing in this Create screen of yours).\r\n\r\nThis translation contain not only the correct terms, but also verbs and adjectives suitably adapted (as you know italian nouns have gender), and we are currently using it in our production environment.",

      "description": "h3. Problem\r\n\r\nWhile creating a Jira Issue Macro in a Confluence Server instance, the header information of the Jira Issue will be translated depending on web browser language configuration for the user.\r\n\r\nWe have found out that the specific fields Fix version/s and Component/s in English (United Kingdom) will be translated to Fix version(s) and Component(s) in English (United States).\r\n\r\nThis can cause discrepancies when using advanced filtering and third-party add-ons that rely on an immutable translation of these fields to retrieve the information. It is also confusing for the end-users.\r\n\r\nh3. Environment\r\n\r\nLatest Confluence Server 7.5.2 connected to a Jira instance v8.0.0 via application link\r\nTo reproduce the issue I used Chrome Version 83.0.4103.106 (Official Build) (64-bit)\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nTo visualize the issue:\r\n# Create a Jira Issue Macro on a Confluence page (recording attached). You need to make sure that Component/s and Fix version/s has been correctly configured on the Jira side for the project. I made them mandatory fields on the Jira end.\r\n# Set the default language in web browser to be either English (United Kingdom) or English (United States)\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nWe expect to have a consistent translation between English (United Kingdom) and English (United States).\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nSpecific fields Fix version/s, Component/s and Affects Version/s in English (United Kingdom) will be respectively translated to Fix version(s) and Component(s) and Affects Version(s) in English (United States)\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nStill in the process of checking this. Manually modifying the JAR file that includes the translation of such fields in the Jira Metadata Plugin in Confluence can be an option.\r\n\r\nh3. Notes\r\n\r\nThis translation is specifically impacting the use of third-party plugin *[Table Filter and Charts for Confluence v5.3.17 by StiltSoft|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/27447/table-filter-and-charts-for-confluence]*\u00a0and Pivot Table macro. Depending on the browser language setting, the result displayed to end-users will be different. ",
