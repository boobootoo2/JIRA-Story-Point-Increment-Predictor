[See the corresponding bug report|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-35327].\n  {panel}\n\nI downloaded the JIRA 6.1 trial version and came across the Issue Collector concept.\nThis seemed like a really neat idea to help integrate JIRA creation with any website.\nI created an Issue Collector with a custom form containing my custom fields along with some native fields for hte users to fill in, and copied the provided HTML to a Script Editor web part on a page in SharePoint.\n\nThis allowed me to request the creation of a JIRA, but the form layout was scrambled, so whilst all of the fields did exist it was hard to see them and enter values - see attached screen shots.\n '_1' shows the Summary and Description fields - there is no scroll bar, the field names are seen under the field value boxes.\n '_2' shows what happens when I manage eventually to scroll down to the other fields - again the field names are under the field value boxes\n'_3' shows another attempt to create an issue and scroll down when it wouldn't let me go past the Environment field, seen at the top above the Summary and Description fields\n'_4' shows what I see when I finally give up and submit the issue!\n\nThe HTML that I inserted into the Script Editor web part is as follows:\n\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://localhost:8080/s/d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e/en_GBio9p4o-1988229788/6144/4/1.4.0-m6/_/download/batch/com.atlassian.jira.collector.plugin.jira-issue-collector-plugin:issuecollector/com.atlassian.jira.collector.plugin.jira-issue-collector-plugin:issuecollector.js?collectorId=d881c35c\"></script>\n\nPlease let me know if you need any more information from me.\n\nWhen I tried using the standard Issue Collector Feedback form, this worked perfectly using the same method of adding it to the SharePoint page",

The process is that we first create sketches that we discuss and agree on, create the epic(s) and user stories in Jira, describe these as detailed as necessary, break them down, estimate and start the work. In the middle of this there is also an approval per issue to ensure that we haven't misunderstood each other along the way. \n\nOnce the user stories are approved the requirements are transferred to Confluence for later reference - they are also \"bound\" together to make it easier to read as a whole if needed. \n\nWhat we would like is to write the descriptions fully in Confluence and tag them with anchors or similar, and then link these specific anchors from Jira. In this way we would only have to write the descriptions once, and we do not risk the possible differences between what is described in the two different systems. \n\nI know you can write something in Confluence, \"mention\" the Jira-issue and this way get a link between the two. But that would again require the developer to go back and forth, which is not very optimal for us. ",

As a web developer we often need to clear our cookies in most or all of our browsers which renders the Tempo timer useless as we lose all time when this happens. We have been using other browsers as a workaround but we usually have to clear cache in those also. A second great feature about doing this server side is that we can adjust our timers from any of our devices whether we are in a meeting, on the road, or anywhere really. One consistent timer would be a great Tempo improvement!",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-35240].\n  {panel}\n\nI have encountered a significant and unadvertised difficulty in accessing the REST API.\n\nI am working on an iOS app, which consumes information programmatically but doesn't handle redirects and cookies--I'm not saying that there's not probably something out there, but the tried and true standby of accessing https://username:password@hostname/rest/api/2/foo . And after pulling out my hair after figuring out why my iOS code wasn't handling JSON appropriately, I tried something.\n\nI entered, in a browser window, https://username:password@hostname/rest/api/2/foo , and two things happened:\n\n1: The correct data was displayed, and:\n\n2: The URL was retconned to https://hostname/rest/api/2/foo\n\nThe reason why I only got empty results was that a REST API pull of https://username:password@hostname/rest/api/2/foo does not behave as one would expect from a REST API, especially not one as simple and powerful as JIRA genuinely offers.\n\nI'm pretty much dead in the water for my original approach to getting data. I can circumvent this issue by manually copying data from JIRA to static content on my own server, but that is a workaround to a development blocker, not a solution, even a cumbersome one, to real production usage. You might be able to help me work around this difficulty, but if you're going to advertise a RESTful API, it would be nice if you didn't practically defeat the REST standby of https://username:password@hostname/rest/api/2/foo\n\nI'm open to learning cookies or whatever powers live human browser usage of your REST API, but your failure to support basic authentication over HTTPS had me pulling my hair out trying to figure out what I had done wrong in iOS to not let iOS handle your JSON properly.\n\nI think a REST API with support for basic authentication would be a major improvement.",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-35227].\n  {panel}\n\nWe've recently upgraded to JIRA 6.0.8 from 5.2.11, and one of the first things my users noticed is that the width of the Text and Free Text fields (including the built-in ones like _Summary_ and _Description_) has been reduced significantly on Create and Edit forms.\n\nIn general, we love the new interface, but this specific example is causing some pain, as the UI now makes it more difficult to enter large amounts of text.  Also, unlike in previous releases, the \"max-width\" property is being set for these fields, meaning that users aren't allowed to enlarge the text boxes for Free Text fields in browsers that provide that capability (like Chrome).  This is triggering a lot of \"workaround\" behaviour, where people are using other tools to write their text, and then pasting it into the JIRA form...this is not a good model, as it is very error-prone.\n\nMy users noticed that the new widths are being equally applied to the static Create and Edit forms, as on the QuickCreate and QuickEdit forms, even though the static forms have much more room to work with.  This used to be the favoured approach by those that didn't like the smaller fields on the QuickCreate/QuickEdit forms, but there is no longer any difference between the forms.\n\nCurrently, these fields are being styled with the \"long-field\" class.  This request is to re-classify these fields as \"full-width-field\", which does not set the max-width attribute.",

Steps to Reproduce\n\n# Create a project with a long name.\n# Create an issue.\n\nh3. Expected Results\n\nThe drop down has sufficient space to display the project name.\n\nh3. Actual Results\n\nThe project name is cut off as per the example.\n\nh3. Notes\n\nThis could be fixed by extending the 250px width to 500px which would be sufficient and also kinda lines up with the rest of the page.\n\nh3. Workaround\n\n* The JIRA files could be altered to change the display of the drop downs - if you'd like to do this please raise it on [Atlassian Answers|https://answers.atlassian.com/] as it's unsupported - see a sample CSS fix in the [comment below|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRA-35218?focusedCommentId=622714&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-622714].\n* Note that you should be able to see the project name in full, by hovering your mouse over each project name from the drop-down list.\n* The project name can be shortened so that it correctly appears.",
