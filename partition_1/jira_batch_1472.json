      "description": "Some of our projects are working with patch queues in Mercurial:\r\n\r\n* There is a \"base\" repo containing normal source files (e.g. from an open source community).\r\n* There is a related \"patch\" repo containing patchs of the sources in the base repo.\r\n* There is _no_ repo containg changesets resulting from applying the patches to the base files.\r\n\r\nThis is a standard structure in Mercurial and well supported.\r\n\r\nSo now we come to a review and the problem is that the reviewer sees only changesets in the patch repo, which do not contain enough context.\r\n\r\nThe situation is somewhat similar to the \"pre-commit\" feature that Crucible already supports. We tried to figure out a way to shoehorn our problem into this feature, but it doesn't work. The crucial problem is the hash of the patch (\"diff -r\"), which depends on all previous applied patches. Taken apart from them, it does not work when reviewing only a single patch from the middle of the queue.\r\n\r\nWhat is needed here is some logic in the review that understands how a patch queue functions. We see the following use case supported:\r\n\r\n# The review is created from Jira for one or more changesets in the patch repo.\r\n# As in the case for a pre-commit review, the user should be able to choose an \"anchor\" changeset in the base repo. Crucible applies the patch if possible; if not, it informs the user that the anchor is not patchable.\r\n# The files in the base repo that are updated by the application of the patches are displayed to the reviewer as reviewable files and his comments are associated with these files for the selected anchor.\r\n# The user may choose different anchors during the review, with the patches delivering different results in the base repo. *The comments are not lost when the user switches anchors.*\r\n\r\nWe won't try to specify more here. Suffice it to say, the Atlassian developers should just try to use the patch queue feature of Mercurial and then implement a good way of reviewing patches in Crucible. :)",

That way there is a tight relationship between \nthe jira issue and crucible review, and the crucible and jira roles are \naligned.

      "description": "Customer use case:\r\n{quote}\r\nWe use SVN as our repository. We use a fairly traditional trunk and branch structure. Our current review process requires us to create a \"review\" branch for each review. One reason for this is to be able to do trunk pre-commit reviews. I know that crucible has a pre-commit review capability, but frankly, it will not do what we want. So, we use a \"svn cp\" command to create a branch and copy our changed files in 1 step to a review branch (this creates a single checkin from the copy and commit of the new files). Doing traditional SVN diffs, it is smart enough to realize that the branch has a base and does not include any of the copied files as part of the diff, only the changed files. We also do the same process for creating a review branch from a traditional private working branch.\r\n\r\nAnyhow, when I try to use crucible with our review branch, it is trying to pull in way to many files (maybe all of them). First, is this expected? Second, if not, how do I setup Crucible to correctly determine branch bases. I have setup my own set of SVN Symbolic Rules to match our structure. Please let me know if any additional details are required. Thank you for your quick response.\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nThis might be a common use case - where users branch and want to add all new commits on the branchX to a review.\r\n",

Two scenarios:\r\n\r\n*1 - Reviewing a change set with a new file*\r\nA file is added and the change set is added to a review. The only pointer to know a file is new is the 'Added' arrow next to the file name. The diff is not completely green (it is in Fisheye, which seems quite inconsistent to me). See scenario1.png.\r\n\r\n*2 - Reviewing two change sets with a new file and a change to this file*\r\nSee scenario2a.png, scenario2b.png and scenario2c.png. \r\n\r\nIn change set c311802 the file is added, in change set 247ed42 a change is made to the same file. By default, the state of the file in change set 247ed42 is shown (scenario2a.png). The arrow next to the file name states something has been changed, but this cannot be distilled from the diff (no changes are shown). It is also not clear that the actual file is a new file, added in revision c311802.\r\n\r\nWhen viewing the changes between the two change sets, it becomes clear that a line has been removed (scenario2b.png). It is still unclear that the file is a new file that needs reviewing.\r\n\r\nWhen viewing only change set c311802, the situation is equal to scenario 1 (scenario2c.png)\r\n\r\nOverall, it is very hard for a reviewer to figure out that a file is actually new and needs reviewing. As a consequence, files can stay unreviewed.",

I am a keyboardist: this just impacted my speed/productivity.\r\n\r\nb) I can not copy code from the source. this is a true showstopper.\r\n\r\n Yes, I tried the following:\r\n\r\n          alt Hold down then click and drag to select source line contents.\r\n\r\nWhat that does?  It ends up selecting lots of extraneous text, and I cannot control it.\r\n\r\nWhy was the default browser behaviour changed for cut and paste and scroll??? That's a serious negative usability choice.\r\n\r\nPlease inform how to revert the \"click to add comment\" so I can get normal click back.  After all it looks like 'c' is already there for 'add comment', so click is an extra.  \r\n\r\nEasy: add user option to disable 'click to comment'. That will resolve this bug.  \r\n\r\nUntil then I am one very unhappy camper, i have wasted a lot of time with this, more than the amount of time actually working in the tool.\r\n\r\n\r\nthanks.\r\n",
