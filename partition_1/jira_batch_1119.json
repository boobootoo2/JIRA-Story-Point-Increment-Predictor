      "description": "h2. Problem Description\r\n\r\nBy default, when installing an Atlassian Connect add-on, it creates a new role as *atlassian-addons-project-access* on all projects. And in the project permission scheme, it added the role *atlassian-addons-project-access* to gain access to all permission. \r\n\r\nThis creates a problem for the scenario below, where a user (not JIRA Administrator) is given *Administer Projects* with limited permissions. The user gains the ability to add his user to the project role *atlassian-addons-project-access* and granted access to all permissions.\r\n\r\nNote: \r\n* Project Administrator has *no* ability to change the project permission. \r\n* Project Administrator has the ability to add users to role\r\n\r\nh2. Steps to Replicate\r\n\r\n# Create a project\r\n# Create a normal user without JIRA Administrator global permission\r\n# Grant the user to *Administer Projects* permission on the project permission scheme\r\n# Install an add-on\r\n# Using the user navigate to the project setting permission scheme\r\n# Notice that user is unable to change the project permission\r\n# Navigate to the *Users and roles* page\r\n# Notice that user able to add another user to role *atlassian-addons-project-access* and gain access to all permission\r\n\r\nh2. Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nProject administrators are unable to add any user to the role *atlassian-addons-project-access* as it is meant to be add-on usage only. This would prevent them from granting themselves full permission for the project.\r\n\r\nh2. Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nProject administrators are able to grant full permission by adding themselves to the role *atlassian-addons-project-access*\r\n\r\nh2. Workaround\r\n\r\nYou can manually change the add-on permission group by adding the groups to the permission scheme and remove the project role *atlassian-addons-project-access*, that will ensure that the add-on function as it should and project administrators were not able to elevate their permission. \r\n\r\nDo note of the following limitation by the workaround:\r\n* New add-on installation will recreate role and added back to the permission scheme\r\n* It might require you to perform clean up if this bug is fixed",

      "description": "\r\n(!)\u00a0*Please notice that this only applies to the new infrastructure. The old endpoints are still working fine in the old infrastructure* (!)\r\nh3. Summary\r\n\r\nRunning a JIRA backup from command line or from a script fails. The endpoint {{rest/obm/1.0/runbackup}} is now returning: 404 - page not found\r\n\r\nAs mentioned in the KB article \"[How to Automate Backups for JIRA Cloud applications|https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirakb/how-to-automate-backups-for-jira-cloud-applications-779160659.html]\" this is not fully supported but, if the endpoint has been removed, then we should either update the documentation or make it work again.\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Either use the [Atlassian Labs automatic-cloud-backup script|https://bitbucket.org/atlassianlabs/automatic-cloud-backup/src] or run the below commands:\r\n{noformat}\r\ncurl -D- -c cookie.txt -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d '{\"username\":\"EMAIL\", \"password\":\"PASSWORD\" }' -X POST https://HOSTNAME/rest/auth/1/session\r\n\r\ncurl --cookie cookie.txt --header \"X-Atlassian-Token: no-check\" -H \"X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest\" -H \"Content-Type: application/json\"  -X POST https://HOSTNAME/rest/obm/1.0/runbackup -d '{\"cbAttachments\":\"true\" }'  \r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nA JIRA backup is started and you can check the progress by calling the below endpoint:\r\n{noformat}\r\ncurl --cookie cookie.txt https://HOSTNAME/rest/obm/1.0/getprogress.json\r\n{noformat}\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nAn error is returned instead:\r\n{noformat}\r\ncurl --cookie cookie.txt --header \"X-Atlassian-Token: no-check\" -H \"X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest\" -H \"Content-Type: application/json\"  -X POST https://HOSTNAME/rest/obm/1.0/runbackup -d '{\"cbAttachments\":\"true\" }' \r\n\r\n\r\n<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"><meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\"><title>Oops, you&#39;ve found a dead link. - JIRA</title><script type=\"text/javascript\">contextPath = \"\";</script><link type='text/css' rel='stylesheet' href='/static-assets/metal-all.css' media='all'><script src='/static-assets/metal-all.js'></script><!--[if lt IE 9]><link type='text/css' rel='stylesheet' href='/static-assets/metal-all-ie.css' media='all'><script src='/static-assets/metal-all-ie.js'></script><![endif]--><!--[if IE 9]><link type='text/css' rel='stylesheet' href='/static-assets/metal-all-ie9.css' media='all'><![endif]--><meta name=\"decorator\" content=\"none\" /></head><body class=\" error-page error404\"><script type=\"text/javascript\">document.body.className += \" js-enabled\";</script><div id=\"page\"><header id=\"header\" role=\"banner\"></header><!-- #header --><section id=\"content\" role=\"main\"><div class=\"aui-page-panel\"><div class=\"aui-page-panel-inner\"><section class=\"aui-page-panel-content lowerContent\"><div id=\"error-state\"><span class=\"error-type\"></span><h1>Oops, you&#39;ve found a dead link.</h1><ul><li>Go back to the <a href=\"javascript:window.history.back()\">previous page</a></li><li>Go to the <a href=\"/secure/MyJiraHome.jspa\">Home Page</a></li></ul></div></section><!-- .aui-page-panel-content --></div><!-- .aui-page-panel-inner --></div><!-- .aui-page-panel --></section><!-- #content --><footer id=\"footer\" role=\"contentinfo\"><section class=\"footer-body\"><div id=\"footer-logo\"><a href=\"http://www.atlassian.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Atlassian</a></div></section></footer><!-- #footer --></div><!-- #page --></body></html>\r\n{noformat}\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nThere are new endpoints to be called that are working fine. However, please notice that automatic backup from script is not officially supported and therefore the endpoints can change again in the future without any previous notice.\r\n\r\nI have updated the existing script by doing the following (you can do the same in case the scripts won't work anymore in the future):\r\n # Open the developer tools in Chrome (or Firefox)\r\n # Run the backup from the UI\r\n # In the developer console check the endpoints used to run the backup and modify the existing scripts accordingly\r\n\r\nBelow are the scripts I have just used to backup my JIRA and Confluence instances. Please use them at your own risk (and make sure you read and understand what's in there before running them):\r\n - [^Confluence-backup.sh]\r\n - [^JIRA-backup-new-endoints-12-2017.sh]\r\n",

JIRA appears to have done nothing after executing the search, but after 20-40 seconds, the search results are returned. This only applies when searching for a text string. The issue doesn't appear when searching by field e.g. 'summary' or 'description'.\r\nh3. Environment\r\n * JIRA 1001.0.0-SNAPSHOT\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # On any JIRA page, use the Search box and type in a word that you expect to appear in issues, then hit Enter\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n * Search results are (almost)instantly returned\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n * JIRA appears to do nothing, search results are returned 20-40 seconds afterward\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n * Instead of using the Search box, search for issues using JIRA's advanced search:\r\n ## Go to Issues > Search for issues\r\n ## Enter \"Advanced Mode\"\r\n ## Type in {{summary ~ YOUR_SEARCH_TERM OR description ~ YOUR_SEARCH_TERM}}.\r\n * Avoid using the {{text}} field in this Advanced mode when searching for issues, instead use any other available fields to return the desired results. For a list of available fields, please see: [Advanced searching fields reference|https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirasoftwarecloud/advanced-searching-fields-reference-764478339.html#Advancedsearching-fieldsreference-DescriptionDescription]\r\n * Use the advanced search feature e.g. description ~'worklog' - this query will search the Description field of all issues for 'worklog'.
