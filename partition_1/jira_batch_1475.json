Namely, generated code and project files. For example I would like to always filter out, *.sln, *.csproj, *.dbml, *.Designer.cs (but not *.cs). Of course, this filter list would be user configurable either at the \"system level\" for those of us using the download version or at the project level. If specified at both levels, then the filters would be accumulative (unless a better mechanism can be thought of).\r\n\r\nRelated posting: https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/51218/how-to-filter-out-files-for-review-when-selecting-a-change-set",

The issue is that when different teams are coding in different SVN branches they do all of their code reviews on those branches so we get good management reporting about the code review coverage of those branches. But when the teams merge their code to Trunk, the code review history is lost, and if you look at the code review coverage for trunk it does not depict the true picture. This is becoming critical for our setup, without the reporting on trunk management gets little value out of this setup.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n# Configure the Repo in Fisheye.\r\n# Commit a file into a Branch.\r\n# Create a review with the file included.\r\n# Review it and close it.\r\n# Check the Review Coverage Report of the Branch\r\n# Merge the file into Trunk.\r\n# Check the Review Coverage Report of the Trunk.\r\n\r\nThe Reviewed status of the file on Branch is not imported to the Trunk.\r\n\r\n!Branches.jpg|thumbnail! !trunk.jpg|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nThank you in advance.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n*Douglas Fabretti*\r\n*Atlassian Support*",

The domain to be used to open UI via browser is fisheye.example.com and jira.example.com.\r\nWhen i want to add e.g. hassle plugin via \"Add Gadget to Directory\" function, i have to use \"http://fisheye.exampledmz.com/rest/gadgets/1.0/g/com.atlassian.fecru.fecru-gadgets-plugin:overdueReviews/gadgets/hassle.xml\" to successfully add the gadget to the directory. If i now add this gadget to the dashboard, it is empty, because all of the http requests which are started by it, are directed to domain \"http://fisheye.exampledmz.com\" instead of \"http://fisheye.example.com\", which is configured as \"site url\" in admin section of fisheye.",

If the files are checked out before being submitted, Crucible displays the diff correctly.\r\n\r\nEDIT:\r\nSeems the issue is more specifically that crucible is not diffing the correct changesets, not that it just doesn't exist. If the file in perforce has a current change set of 4897, then after integration, has a changeset of 5124, crucible has a different base revision between those 2 numbers. So crucible is trying to diff 4955 and 5124, even though a revision for 4955 wasn't available for that file.
