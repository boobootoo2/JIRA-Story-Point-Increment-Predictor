However, with users and groups, there is OnDemand-specific logic to synchronise the imported data with the Crowd directory. This logic is incomplete, in that it doesn't update attributes of existing users, does not remove users, and only creates new group membership entries (does not remove any).\r\n\r\nThis impacts JIRA Enterprise hosted to OnDemand migrations.
