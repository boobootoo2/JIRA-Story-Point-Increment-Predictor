It's inconvenient to click the 'x' next to each of the 100 names to remove all of them.\r\n\r\nThis happens if I click on the \"Edit Details\" button before or after adding content to the review. I believe we are running 2.8.x although I'm unsure what the minor version is.\r\n\r\nIt seems that this field should be populated with no reviewers until the user adds them. It's possible that crucible was trying to be helpful by adding suggested reviewers but when clicking the \"Suggested reviewers\" link it doesn't pull up any suggestions. That link doesn't appear to work until after the review has actually been created.",

      "description": "We're using Crucible 2.9.1 running on a Debian GNU/Linux system, connecting to a PostgreSQL 8.3 database.\r\n\r\nFishEye/Crucible keeps a number of database connections open, in an \"idle in transaction\" state. These transactions hold a number of AccessShare table locks. This causes a problem when our database tries to run a \"VACUUM FULL\" maintenance job on the Crucible database, since VACUUM FULL attempts to get a AccessExclusive lock, which it can't do when there are AccessShare locks held on the same tables. This then causes further queries to stall because they're waiting for AccessShare locks on the same table the vacuum process is waiting for an AccessExclusive lock on.\r\n\r\nI've attached some process listings and information from pg_locks which demonstrate the issue.\r\n\r\nIdeally, Crucible should be closing the transactions when they're not in use, thus releasing the locks.\r\n\r\nOur workaround for now is to stop Crucible before vacuuming the DB, although obviously this is not ideal.",
