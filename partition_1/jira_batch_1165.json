When I attempt to associate a workflow scheme with a project by selecting the \"Associate\" link next to the workflow name, it displays a box with all the projects to which I can apply the selection.  The problem is that it also shows projects ALREADY associated with said scheme in highlighted fashion.  If I am not careful, I may simply click the project I want to associate and inadvertently deselect projects already associated.  This may happen, for example, if the projects already associated with the scheme are out of view (requiring to use the scroll bar to bring them into view).  If this mistake is made, the projects will be de-associated from the scheme and set to the default scheme.  This has happened several times at my company already.\n\nA solution I propose is to show only the projects which are NOT associated with the scheme.  This will prevent projects from being de-associated by mistake.\n\nThanks",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-60269].\n  {panel}\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. Open a JIRA issue\n2. Resolve that issue by committing a code change to the git repository that references the JIRA issue; e.g. PROJECT-0001 fixed\n3. Observe the issue has the commit associated with it\n\nPROBLEM: if this is the wrong ticket, you cannot change it unless you force push a change to the commit comment, which is highly discouraged in a multi-develop environment.\n\nSOLUTION: one idea is, when the commit message is scanned and a jira issue is found, create a link between the issue and the commit. Allow that link to be edited or removed. Also, allow links to be manually created. In the example above, one could edit the link:\n\n1234567 PROJECT-0001\n\nto be\n\n1234567 PROJECT-0002\n\nAnd a commit for which the developer forgot to refer to the lira ticket could be added:\n\nabcdef12 PROJECT-0003\n\n",

The nature of the protocol is that a partial memento of the email is made available to Mail Handlers, and that calls to the underlying message object to obtain body content and attachments result in direct chatter back to the mailserver.  If the mailserver decides for some reason to kill the connection the client Mail Handler gets a Folder Closed Exception, which is covered in quite a few places:\n- https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRA-29228\n\nCurrently, what can happen is that in this situation, the mail handler cannot process the mail, because the server closed the connection.  The JIRA API for Mail Handlers currently provides a TRUE (we processed it, so mark read or delete) / FALSE (we didn't process it, leave it unread).  Unfortunately what seems to happen is that the 'broken' nature of this message is somehow cached via the IMAP connection, and is re-presented to mail handlers again, which breaks, again.\n\nIt may be possible to 'poke' the Mail Service back into life by revalidating its mail connection, but this may have unforeseen implications for other mail handers that could be in progress, hence this issue.\n\nPotentially mail handlers could return 'true' to indicate that JIRA should mark the message read and delete, it's possible that would stop the same message being re-presented to the mail handler repeatedly, but could result in message loss without processing, so isnt a good option.\n\nIt would be better if a Mail Handler API enabled support for a specific Exception to indicate the nature of the problem (generally ALL related to IMAP), to drive the connection refresh, or return some kind of enumeration, which allows for more expressive hinting about what JIRA should do in the event of a failure to process a message that occurs at a protocol level.\n",

Suggested Solution\nAllow more customizable warnings to be preset by users. \nFor example, allow each type of the currently-available warnings to be further configurable based on issue types.\nA typical use case for this is certain tasks such as Documentation tasks do not require code reviews, so it doesn't need to be a warning for such issue types.\n\n \nh3. Workaround \nCreate a label system that mirror the warnings you would like to see in the release page. Create a process to mark issues with labels and create a dashboard based on filters that parse the issues into a logical group of said warnings. ",

Typically each user account only exists in one directory.  However we have one user who moved regions, and thus his account was disabled on one directory and recreated on the other:\n\nLDAP1\\JSMITH (inactive)\nLDAP2\\JSMITH\n\nFrom the logs we can see that JIRA first attempts to authenticate against LDAP1, it finds the account but authentication fails.  JIRA does not fall through and attempt the next directory, but rather gives up entirely, advising the user that their \"username and password are incorrect\".\n\nIf I switch the order of the directories, the user is able to log in.  However this is not a feasible solution; LDAP1 is first for performance reasons.  Also other users may migrate in the other direction.\n\nSince it appears to be a standard domain sysadmin practice to deactivate the old account when moving users between LDAP directories, I believe JIRA should check the Inactive state of the LDAP account and if it is inactive, it should try the next user directory.",

Current situation\nUnder _Project > Administration > \"Users and Roles\"_ one can assign users to roles which are not used by the permission scheme of the project.\n\nh2. Problem\nSometimes, it is difficult for a project administrator to know which roles are relevant for a project or let's say used by a project's permission scheme.\n\nh3. Suggestion\n*As a project administrator, I can add users to roles that are used by the project's permission scheme only so that I don't have to look up the permission scheme to know which roles are relevant.*\n\nIt may be like this:\n* Users can be added to roles that are used by the project's permission scheme only\n* If a role gets removed from a permission scheme and users are still added to this role there are two options\n** JIRA removes the role from the project and in order to this all assigned users are getting removed automatically\n** JIRA leaves the role with all assigned users in the project and marks it as being not required or without effect (*preferred*)",

Summary\nA user who is a member of the Project Role (Administrators) which has been added to the *Administer Project* permission is unable to edit the Project Lead. According to the [documentation|https://confluence.atlassian.com/jira/managing-project-permissions-185729636.html], the *Administer Project* permission allows any user w/ the permission to edit the Project Lead:\nbq. Permission to administer a project in JIRA. This includes the ability to edit project role membership, project components, project versions and some project details ('Project Name', 'URL', 'Project Lead', 'Project Description').\n\nHowever, with this bug, a user with the *Administer Project* permission is unable to edit the Project Lead. No errors -appear in the UI or- in the logs.\n\nAs of JIRA 7.2.0-OD-05, receiving the following Error when trying to change the Project Lead or Default Assignee as a Project Admin:\n!EditProjectLeadorAssignee.png|thumbnail!\n\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\n# Create a project and grant the user Project Administration permission\n# Login to the instance as the user and navigate to project settings > Users and Roles\n# Click on \"Edit Defaults\"\n# Change project lead to another user\n# Click \"Update\"\n\nh3. Expected Results\n-The update completes and pop-up window closes.- User is able to update changes to Project Lead and you see the Project Lead correctly updated on the page. \n\nh3. Actual Results\n-The update button does not respond. You will see a brief spinning wheel, but the \"Update\" button does not actually update the user.-\n\nReceiving an error indicating \"You must have global administrator rights in order to modify the project key.\"\n\nLooking in the logs with {{com.atlassian.jira.security}} DEBUG, all the permissions clear:\n{code}\n2016-03-04 17:28:28.883949500 2016-03-04 17:28:28,881 http-nio-2990-exec-227 DEBUG rfuerst 1048x24557x1 39fl15 4.15.43.214,10.85.161.148,127.0.0.1 /secure/project/EditProjectLeadAndDefaultAssignee.jspa [c.a.jira.security.WorkflowBasedPermissionManager] BROWSE_PROJECTS permission granted by permission scheme\n2016-03-04 17:28:28.883951500 2016-03-04 17:28:28,881 http-nio-2990-exec-227 DEBUG rfuerst 1048x24557x1 39fl15 4.15.43.214,10.85.161.148,127.0.0.1 /secure/project/EditProjectLeadAndDefaultAssignee.jspa [c.a.jira.security.WorkflowBasedPermissionManager] ADMINISTER_PROJECTS permission granted by permission scheme\n2016-03-04 17:28:28.883991500 2016-03-04 17:28:28,881 http-nio-2990-exec-227 DEBUG rfuerst 1048x24557x1 39fl15 4.15.43.214,10.85.161.148,127.0.0.1 /secure/project/EditProjectLeadAndDefaultAssignee.jspa [c.a.jira.security.WorkflowBasedPermissionManager] BROWSE_PROJECTS permission granted by permission scheme\n2016-03-04 17:28:28.883997500 2016-03-04 17:28:28,881 http-nio-2990-exec-227 DEBUG rfuerst 1048x24557x1 39fl15 4.15.43.214,10.85.161.148,127.0.0.1 /secure/project/EditProjectLeadAndDefaultAssignee.jspa [c.a.jira.security.WorkflowBasedPermissionManager] ADMINISTER_PROJECTS permission granted by permission scheme\n{code}\n\nh3.Workaround\nIf you add the user to the {{administrators}} group, they will be able to edit the Project Lead.

However, I want to suggest an enhancement for this gadget. I'd like to be able to set some quick filters on the calendar header. This way, I would be able to filter my calendar according to some criterias. So, the new enhancement would be similar as kanban boards. Can you add this new enhancement to improve this gadget ? I hope so :)\n\nBest regards,\nGhislain Lambert",
