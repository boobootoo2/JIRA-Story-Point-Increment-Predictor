One would have to follow them to their other end, where the same ambiguities as above could appear.\n\nTo solve this ambiguity, incoming and outgoing arrows should never overlap at a box. One way to do that is to have two access points at each edge of a box. All incoming arrows end at the access point that is nearer to the top left corner, and all outgoing arrows end at the access point that is nearer to the bottom right corner. (For RTL-written languages, the top-right and bottom-left corners might be used instead, to follow the natural reading directions.)\n\n!Proposal for arranging the arrows.png|thumbnail!",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-44594].\n  {panel}\n\nh3. Problem Definition\nThe use of the Agile Simplified Workflow enables project administrators to create issue statuses.  Statuses from other boards are not visible when they are doing this from the Board Administration UI.  This means many different issue statuses are created.\n\nWhen searching this results in a very large list of issue status suggestions.  The searcher can't tell which ones are valid for a given set of projects or boards.\n\nh3. Suggested Solution\nA JQL function to suggest a constrained list of issue states.  This is just one idea, a different solution to the problem would be welcome.\n\nPerhaps this would look like...\n{code:borderStyle=solid}\nstatus IN projectIssueStates((PROJECT_NAME [, PROJECT_NAME, ...]), (STATUS [, STATUS, ...]))\nstatus IN boardIssueStates((BOARD_NAME [, BOARD_NAME, ...]), (STATUS [, STATUS, ...]))\n{code}\n\nBy specifying a list of projects or boards to use as a constraint a sub-set of the global list of statuses can be suggested.  This saves the user from trying to determine the list of statuses used by the project or board.\n\nAlternatively and perhaps more generally useful, use a sub-query to pull a list of issues then use the statuses from that list as suggestions.  Example:\n\n{code:borderStyle=solid}\nstatus IN filteredIssueStates(\"Project = TEST AND issueType != 'Epic'\", (STATUS [, STATUS, ...]))\n{code}\n\nThe suggested list would only include statuses present in the filtered list of issues.\n\nNOTE: Consideration should be given to whether or not this would prevent referencing _other_ issue statuses.  In other words, if project TEST only has issues in Open, InProgress, and Done should the function allow an issue status list of (Open, InProgress, Done, PendingReview) or flag this as invalid?\n\nh3. Workaround \n\nThese are not great workarounds so please comment if you have other ideas.\n\n* Ask and train project owners to prefix the statuses they create with their project key. Example: PROJA Waiting Approval.\n* Ask/train project owners to maintain a list of statuses that are valid for their project to aid them in searching.  Others can refer to the project summary or Agile board to identify the statuses available.",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-44558].\n  {panel}\n\nHi JIRA Product Management Team,\n\nCurrently, my company is using Jira & Confluence.\n\nAnd now, my company has a need of analyzing a project based on project properties.\n\nFor example, our need are \n* to list all projects and group by project technology and/or business lines/ business entities \n* to analyze time spent of projects based on a specified project technology and/or a specified business lines/ business entities\n\nWhen creating a project, I can use category field to clarifying but only one field is not enough\n\nI also found a add-on which name is Profield can help me to add more custom field to a project and analyze based on those fields\n\nHowever, I'd like this feature (will have more filed to clarify a project instead of only one \"category\" field) can integrate into Jira rather using an add-on of third party. So, my question is: does your company intend to add this feature to your product in future (Jira) ?\n\nThanks for your support,\n\nLam Nguyen Hoang | QA Manager\nlam.nguyenhoang@pycogroup.com\n_______________________________________\n{color:#59afe1}*PYCO*GROUP{color}\nDIGITAL / CONSULTING / VENTURES\nBelgium / France / Hong-Kong / South Africa / USA / Vietnam\n[https://www.facebook.com/PYCO.Digital.VN]  |  [http://www.linkedin.com/company/642427]",

Steps to Reproduce\n1. Generate a JIRA Cloud Backup and follow these instructions for Migrating from JIRA Cloud to JIRA Server:\n\nhttps://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Migrating+from+JIRA+Cloud+to+JIRA+Server\n\n2. Login with a user that has JIRA System Administrators Global Permission. This was tested with a new System Administrator users as well as the default \"sysadmin\" user.\n3. Go to JIRA Administration (the cog) > System (or any other JIRA Administration menu item.)\n4. You will not be prompted to login again.\n\nh3. Expected Results\nJIRA Server would enable Secure Administrator Sessions automatically, as it is designed to do by default.\n\nh3. Actual Results\nGoing into any of the JIRA Administration menu items does not prompt for an additional login.\n\n h3. Notes\n[Even editing the | https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Configuring+Secure+Administrator+Sessions] {{jira-config.properties}} file with {{jira.websudo.is.disabled = false}} (or toggling it between false and true) does not enable the Secure Administrator session login prompt.\n\nh3. Workaround\n\n(!) *Please ensure you have up to date JIRA DB backup before performing below tasks.*\n\nBefore performing below workaround, let us first check whether there is an entry for {{jira.websudo.is.disabled}} property in DB.\n* Run below SQL query. This will return one entry if exist in DB, list down the {{ID #}} which needed under workaround section. If no result return, *do not* perform workaround. \n{code}\nselect * from propertyentry where property_key like '%websudo%';\n{code}\nh5. Example below\n{code}\nselect * from propertyentry where property_key like '%websudo%';\n\n\n  id   |   entity_name   | entity_id |       property_key       | propertytype\n-------+-----------------+-----------+--------------------------+--------------\n 10044 | jira.properties |         1 | jira.websudo.is.disabled |            1\n(1 row)\n{code}\n\nh5. Update {{jira.websudo.is.disabled}}\n# Shutdown JIRA\n# Run below query to update the propertytype value from *1* (T) to *0* (F). Replace {{<ID>}} below with the correct ID(above example would be 10044).\n{code}\nUPDATE propertyentry set propertytype=0 where id=<ID>;\n{code}\n# Start JIRA\n#  Verify it under *Administration >> System Info* page, the *jira.websudo.is.disabled* property should be set to *false*.",

It would help our product development a ton to have some cost effective client collaboration in JIRA.\n\nRight now I would need to purchase a license for ever one of our community members, which is a large, organic and ever-changing group of people, similar to the community on Atlassian Answers. This would take extensive overhead to manage the accounts and be very expensive to boot with the current licensing structure. It would be great to be able to purchase a bundle of accounts with extremely limited permissions at a reduced cost.

I tested with German.\n# Now proceed with the installation\n# After the installation is complete, check the issue types on the instance\n# Notice all issue types are created in English\n# Now create a project\n# Notice that now new issue types are created in the instance language.\n\n",

Problem Definition\nEvery so often, customers migrate from JIRA Cloud to JIRA Server, and support Engineers sometimes need to restore customer data on particular JIRA builds, when they do this they may need to compare build numbers of different JIRA versions.\n\nCurrently this is done by referencing this KB: https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRAKB/JIRA+Build+and+Version+Numbers+Reference\n\nThe KB is updated manually and as a result will fall out of sync with the latest version, this should be done as part of the release process.\n\nh3. Suggested Solution\nInstead of using a manually updated KB this information should be in developer.atlassian.com somewhere - look at how Confluence handles this https://developer.atlassian.com/confdev/development-resources/confluence-build-information",

Problem Definition\nBoth *JIRA* and *Confluence* have *HTML* macros, which allow users to add _HTML code_ to any issues and pages respectively.\n\nHowever, if the user adds the required HTML tags inside the macro ({{<html>}}, {{<body>}} or {{<header>}}, the user may end up breaking the page formatting. \n\nSimilarly, if the user adds a \"style\" for tags, it may override JIRA's CSS. For example:\n{noformat}\n<style type=\"text/css\">\nbody { font-family: serif, verdana; font-size: smaller; }\n</style>\n{noformat}\n\nh3. Suggested Solution\nInform users that they should not use those tags - rather, they should only use the formatting as if they were including something inside the {{<body>}} directly.\n\nExample of pages that should be edited are:\n* [Editing Rich-Text Fields|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Editing+Rich-Text+Fields] in the JIRA documentation, and;\n* [HTML Macro|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/HTML+Macro] in Confluence's.",
