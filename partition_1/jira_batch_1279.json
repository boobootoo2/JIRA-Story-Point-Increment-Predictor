It also removes the problem of changes in markup between JIRA releases.\n\nWe would like to use this functionality outside the context of an issue. We have already done so for worklogs with great success. However, the formatSuccess function used requires an issue object (JIRA.FRAGMENTS.issueActionsFragment).\n\nWe would like to propose a new dropdown that is more generic. That is, it would be excactly like JIRA.FRAGMENTS.issueActionsFragment but without the first item (View Issue).\n\nYou could create it with something like the following:\n\n{code}\n    AJS.Dropdown.create({\n        trigger: \".generic-actions-trigger\",\n        ajaxOptions: {\n            dataType: \"json\",\n            cache: false,\n            formatSuccess: JIRA.FRAGMENTS.genericActionsFragment\n        }\n    });\n{code}\n\nWe are aware that would could easily create this on the plugin site but that would be a major headache when supporting multiple JIRA releases. Since the genericActionsFragment would be on the JIRA end, we wouldn't have to worry about changes in the markup.\n\nThere are multiple use cases for this in our plugin development and it would save us a lot of time dealing with new JIRA releases.\n\nIt would also be convenient if the fragment would render the 'desc' attribute in the actions/operations elements as the link title.\n\nThis is something we would really want to see in JIRA 5.0 so we can throw away our old dropdowns.",

Manual configuration of the {{dbconfig.xml}} file might be required because those particular configurations are not supported by the JIRA Configuration Tool.\n\nHowever, if the customer were to perform the JIRA Home Directory configuration step _after_ defining a finely tuned DB connection (in a 'specialised' {{dbconfig.xml}} file which they manually configured), their specialised {{dbconfig.xml}} will be overwritten because the '*Save*' button on the JIRA Configuration Tool saves the configs on _all_ tabs - regardless of whether you like it or not. End result? They'll then lose their finely tuned configurations.\n\nHence, please make the '*Save*' button only apply to the configuration tab its used on. Intuitively, many users would also expect the '*Save*' button to behave this way - and it ultimately results in greater flexibility for them too.",

By default, IIS disallows 'double encoding'. Jira uses this 'double encoding' to replace spaces in the names of file attachments with '+' characters. This causes an error (404 Not Found) when Jira is proxied through IIS with Application Request Routing and URL Rewriting (this is the normal situation with Windows Server 2008 and IIS 7). There is a workaround, but it requires weakening of the default security policy of IIS, which is never easy to swallow.\n\nUsing '+' to represent spaces is not universally accepted as a valid practice. The more technically correct (but ugly) encoding of %20 would be safer in a wider variety of situations.\n\nI would like to see Atlassian products use this standard encoding practice.\n\nFor background information, please see https://support.atlassian.com/browse/JSP-85127",

We want reporter always to mean \"original reporter.\" If an issue is being moved and this cannot be retained, we want to stop the move. There doesn't seem to be a way to do this. Even if no users have \"Modify Reporter\" permission, reporters can still be modified. In fact, if I take away \"Modify Reporter\" permission in our secure (restricted-access) projects, the reporter is *always* changed, even if the original reporter is a member of the target project. At least this is the behavior I see when I move a single issue (outside the bulk updater).\n\nIf moving a single issue, JIRA spells out exactly what will happen to the reporter before an action is taken. The user performing the explicitly confirms the change in this case. But this still leaves open the possibility of mistakes.\n\nFor bulk moves, the matter is obscured and more dangerous. See https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRA-14385. The user can say to retain the reporter, but this will only be done if it is possible. Otherwise the default reporter (which *must* be specified for the bulk move) will be used.\n\n",

If this install is working already with SSL or IIS, after the upgrade is done, all these working confugurations stopped working.\n\nSo, steps to reproduce:\n- make a JIRA pre 4.4 use SSL or IIS\n- upgrade this existing install via Windows installer\n- try to access JIRA\n\nAny updates on this would be great!\n\nCheers\n\nThiago Prisco\n{quote}",

Here are some potential attack scenarios:\n\n# Admin sets their JIRA logo to be a logo sourced from an untrusted site (this is not usually considered an issue)\n# A user forgets their password and requests a password reset email, and clicks the link in an issue.  Alternatively, the admin of the untrusted site requests password reset for a victim, and hopes they click the link, which could happen.\n# The user is taken to the password reset screen, the logo is requested and the referrer header from that logo contains the password reset token\n# The site the logo comes from uses that referrer header to reset the users password before the user has an opportunity to\n\nOther potential scenarios are that the admin sets the JIRA logo to a trusted static site who, because their site is static and contains no confidential information, leaves their webstats unprotected.\n\nA good solution to this problem is when receiving a password reset request from an email, store the token in the session, and redirect the user to another screen that asks for a new password, and doesn't put the token in the URL.",

Instead, clicking the '*Add*' link (at the top left of the transition's 'Conditions' tab) simply adds your individual condition to the outermost grouped condition.\n\nThis makes it cumbersome to add an individual condition _independently_ of the outermost grouped condition and then switch the logic of this individual condition (_independently_ of the outermost grouped condition).\n\nFor example, I have an outermost grouped condition consisting of (A AND B AND C) to which I want to add the individual condition D.\n\nAfter using the '*Add*' link to add D, I get '(A AND B AND C AND D)' - not '(A AND B AND C) AND D'.\n\n*Why is this distinction important?* Because if I wanted to switch the logic of the original grouped condition only, I'd get '(A OR B OR C OR D)' - not '(A OR B OR C) AND D', the latter of which:\n* is intuitively what I'd intended\n* would be a valid (complex) condition.\n\nTo get the latter (complex) condition, I'd have to do the following - assuming I'm starting with the grouped condition (A AND B AND C):\n# Click the '*Add grouped condition*' link (against A) to add B and C to A, so I get ((A AND B AND C) AND B AND C).\n# Click the '*Add*' link at the top-left (or the outermost group's '*Add condition to group*' link) to add D to the outermost group, which gives me ((A AND B AND C) AND B AND C AND D).\n# Click the '*Delete*' link (against B and C in the outermost group) to remove B and C from the outermost group, which finally gives me ((A AND B AND C) AND D).\n# I can then go ahead and switch the logic of the internal group to give me ((A OR B OR C) AND D).\n\nThis is an unnecessarily complex set of steps to generate this fairly straightforward complex condition.\n\n----\n\nTo resolve this issue, the '*Add*' link at the top-left (mentioned in step 2 above) should always add individual conditions that are 'external to' the outermost group. *Reason?* - you can always add D to an outermost group (A AND B AND C) using the '*Add condition to group*' link.\n",

The custom field context allows your custom field to be configured differently for numerous different combinations of issue types and projects. For example, your custom field could have *different default values for different projects (and/or issue types).*\n\nI want to emphasize the _*(and/or issue types)*_. This seems to imply that you can set multiple default values within the same project for different issue types.\n\nAfter some testing, I found that once you have selected and configured a specific project/issue type combination, you cannot select that same project again for editing.  This means that you cannot set the 'different values' for a different set of issue types within that same project.\n\nExample:\n* I have the project 'ape planet' and want to create a custom select field with values A, B, C for the 'Bug' issue type and values 1, 2, 3 for the 'Improvement' issue type of this project.\n* As shown below I did the following:\n** Created the new custom field select type, selecting 'Bug' and 'ape planet' context.\n** I then clicked 'Add new context' to now configure the 'Improvement' issue type, but I find that 'ape planet' project can no longer be selected.",

A Clickjacking attack is similar to CSRF in which attacker can hijack a \"click\" on a web application from another \"invisible\" frame in the browser. Essentially, an attacker can force a user to click on a button that is invisible to him/her.\r\n\r\nExploit Scenario: An attacker crafts a malicious page such that when their victim clicks, they are actually clicking on the link or button in the vulnerable application hosted in an iframe. Thus, an attacker tricks the user into performing an action of the attacker's choosing by directing mouse input to the target application.\r\n",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-25122].\n  {panel}\n\nWhen upgrading from JIRA 4.0.2 to 4.3.3 the JIRA database upgrade process that is run on first startup performs four separate reindex operations, all four of which are extraneous for a typical upgrade and incur many hours of critical down time for large JIRA instances.  Due to the fact that JIRA upgrades often involve admin-level changes that are going to require a manual re-index to be performed anyway, it is unnecessary for JIRA to perform a reindex at all as part of the database upgrade process, and it is definitely unnecessary for it to perform 4 of them.  Please optimize this so at most one (optional) reindex is performed during the upgrade process.\n\nTo work around this problem we removed the jira.option.indexing row from the propertyentry table in the JIRA database before starting the upgraded version of JIRA for the first time.  After the upgrade is complete, go to Administration->Indexing in the JIRA interface and click \"Activate\" to re-add this row to the database and manually begin the reindexing process.  Using this procedure resulted in a 50-minute upgrade process instead of nearly 5 hours.  Your mileage may vary, but we did not notice any problems created by using this procedure.\n\nPlease also update the JIRA documentation to note that the jira.option.indexing parameter in jira-application.properties no longer performs any function in an unmodified JIRA instance.  (This setting in jira-application.properties is always overridden by the database entry, if present.)\n\nh3. Workaround\n\n(i) This only applies for instances pre 5.0 and should only ever be required if upgrading from a version of JIRA prior to 4.0 (e.g.: a two-step from 3.13.x to 4.4.5). Otherwise upgrading to the most recent version will contain this improvement.\n\n# Disable the indexing:\n{code:SQL}\nUPDATE propertynumber ps, \n       propertyentry pe \nSET    ps.propertyvalue = 0 \nWHERE  pe.id = ps.id \n       AND pe.entity_name = 'jira.properties' \n       AND pe.propertytype = 1 \n       AND pe.property_key = 'jira.option.indexing'\n{code}\n# Complete the upgrade and test.\n# Re-enable the argument:\n{code:SQL}\nUPDATE propertynumber ps, \n       propertyentry pe \nSET    ps.propertyvalue = 1\nWHERE  pe.id = ps.id \n       AND pe.entity_name = 'jira.properties' \n       AND pe.propertytype = 0 \n       AND pe.property_key = 'jira.option.indexing'\n{code}",
