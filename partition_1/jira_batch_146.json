I regularly merge my local feature branch with the remote while I work on it to keep my changes current. (See screenshot 1).\r\n\r\nI have my feature ready, so now I want to prepare a patch to propose to the community via email.\r\n\r\n1. Click Create Patch. (Screenshot 2)\r\n2. I can't easily isolate my changes vs the ones I simply merged in.\r\n2a. I tried clicking the Graph column header to perhaps sort that way. It does nothing.\r\n2b. I finally switch to Ancestor Order and All Branches.\r\n2c. Now I'm able to manually find the changes I locally made since they're mostly clustered at the top. (Screenshot 3)\r\n3. Once I have a set of changes selected, the changes shown cover lots of files that were not actually touched in the selected changes. (Screenshot 3)\r\n4. If I actually create the patch, it does contain only the selected changes. I have to review it as a text file to check it instead of relying on the UI in step 3.\r\n5. I realize now that this patch shows interim changes and I'd really rather provide a collapsed patch with all of my changes instead.\r\n6. Try to figure out how to diff two branches (feature branch (metrenamer) vs master (opensource)). Stumble around and find no way to do this.\r\n7. Realize that with one branch current, I can right-click another branch and Diff against Current. It spins for minutes. It stops spinning. No idea where the diff ended up, if it got saved anywhere.\r\n8. Wonder how I should prep the patch I want now and write up a Jira ticket.",

      "description": "On lower-end machines it's possible to overload the machine with calls to hg/git because of the way GCD interprets calls which it considers to be blocked on I/O.\r\n\r\nSourceTree schedules all of its work through Grand Central Dispatch, which deals with thread pools based on the number of CPU cores available. This should mean that things are scaled appropriately based on the machine, however it was revealed to me in a lab session that GCD is a bit smarter than that - it detects if any of those threads is currently waiting for file I/O or similar, and if so fires up another thread to deal with the next request in the mean time. Unfortunately, calls to Mercurial are seen like this, so GCD goes beyond the 2-4 threads and starts firing up new ones to service more Python calls. On a low-end machine the hg calls probably don't clear quick enough, and this becomes a snowball effect (the 2GB starts to run out, making each hg call slower, which means GCD thinks they're blocked on I/O more so launches more threads etc etc). You just don't see this on other machines (and I test on my wife's 5-year old Core Duo MBP, but it has 4GB and the hg calls seem to clear quick enough for the pile-up not to happen).\r\n\r\nThe main culprit here is likely to be the bookmarks window, although in theory any view could trigger it with enough queued work.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately to maintain 10.6 compatibility we can't just use a custom dispatch queue set to concurrent (only serial custom queues are supported in 10.6, and those serialise things too much - on testing this the bookmarks window feels interminably slow). The better option might be to monitor the number of outstanding calls in the bookmarks window much like the Hosted Projects window and limit it to queueing a max of (say) 3-4 to GCD at any one time.",

For example, it could render the first line of the message in *bold*, and somehow signal if I go over 50 characters for that line. For the rest of the commit message, it should automatically insert line breaks at 72 characters, inserting spaces for indentations when it looks like I'm typing a bullet list.\r\n\r\nAnother option would be embedding Emacs as the commit message editor (I'm half joking about this).",

      "description": "With the probable release of Retina displays for Mac in the fairly near future (perhaps even at WWDC 2012 although I'm not sure the tech is ready for the right price yet), suddenly all the bitmaps in SourceTree will start to look pixellated compared to the text / vector drawing. The only way to resolve this will be to re-draw all the icons at double the resolution - in practice in fact we'll need the icons to be drawn explicitly at both resolution types in order to be sharp on all configurations.\r\n\r\nSo, we'll probably need to get a designer working in Illustrator or similar to make this happen. There are quite a lot of icons so this isn't a small job, but it would probably be good to get some professional work on the functional icons too anyway (as opposed to the app icon which has already been done).\r\n\r\nYou can see how this looks by doing the following even on a non-Retina Mac:\r\n\r\n# Install the XCode tools\r\n# Launch Quartz Debug from /Developer/Applications/Graphics Tools\r\n# Click the Window Menu, then UI Resolution\r\n# Check the 'Enable HiDPI display modes' option\r\n# Log out and log back in\r\n# Open System Preferences > Displays\r\n# Select a resolution that ends in \"(HiDPI)\"\r\n\r\nEverything will be double the usual size since the hardware can't actually display the resolution otherwise, but you can see the effect.",
