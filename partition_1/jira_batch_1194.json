[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-41728].\n  {panel}\n\nProblem:\nSince we upgraded from JIRA 5.2 to 6.3.12 on 23.11.2014, we see that the work logged within JIRA (or Tempo in our case) is shown in the History tab of each issue. This was not the case in the older JIRA version.\nWe updated to JIRA 6.3.13 to get rid of the worklog emails, but 6.3.13 did not change the History tab problem.\n\nReason:\nFor us, it is important that Work Log entries  are only visible to concerned persons in the company. This typically are project leaders and accounting. All others should not see the worklog of others. It is OK and helpful to see ones own work logs.\n\nBackground:\nTempo does a good job in hiding work logs from others. It has permissions for time sheets that fit our needs. But at the JIRA level, this high appreciated level of privacy seems to get lost: Activity Streams show worklog entries, History Tabs show worklog entries. Both shall be hidden to users without permission to do so. We managed to hide Activity Streams (which was a long struggle and not all participants were lucky with the found solution).\n\nThis is also a legal issue: In Europe, personal data must be treated in a special way. This is enforced by national and european laws. As I understand it, the current behaviour of JIRA is not conform to European law, because work logs can be seen by people that are not involved with processing this data.\n\nExpected Solution:\nThe worklog entries should be removed from the history tab for users that do not have the required permission for this. \"Issue View\" permission is not the right permission to use as well as \"Edit All Worklogs\". A \"View All Worklogs\" permission (vs. \"View Own Worklogs\") would be fine.",

As admin, I want to keep the admin group and remove everything else:\n\n- Single User (John Doe) (Delete)\n- Single User (Jane Doe) (Delete)\n- Project Role (Developers) (Delete)\n- Project Role (atlassian-addons-project-access) (Delete)\n- Project Role (Clients) (Delete)\n- Project Role (Users) (Delete)\n- Group (administrators) (Delete)\n\nRetaining Group (administrators), I would need to click the Delete link 6 times.

Run this at source JIRA Insert your project key into this query: {code:sql}\nSELECT EP.id\nFROM entity_property EP, jiraissue I, project P\nWHERE EP.entity_name = 'IssueProperty' AND I.id = EP.entity_id\n  AND P.id = I.project AND P.pkey = 'YOUR_PROJECT_KEY'\nORDER BY EP.id;\n{code}\n# Determine the current MAX(id), run this at target JIRA: {code:sql}\nSELECT MAX(id) FROM entity_property\n{code}\n# Modify the XML backup file, replacing the entity_property IDs with sequential numbers higher than MAX(id) from the entity_property table.\n#* Make sure you only modify XML nodes that begin with \"<EntityProperty id=\".  If the entities.xml file is large you may need to use vi or another editor that can handle really big files.\n# Complete the import\n# Shut down the target instance\n# Reset the sequence_value_item table for EntityProperty types, run this at target JIRA: {code:sql}\nUPDATE sequence_value_item SET seq_id = (SELECT MAX(id)+100 FROM entity_property) WHERE seq_name = 'EntityProperty';\n{code}\n# Restart the target instance\n\nSee KB for more detailed steps and simplified option to modify the XML backup file: [Project Import fails due to too many errors|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRAKB/Project+Import+fails+due+to+too+many+errors]",

This can be found in the getSenders method in the MailUtils class:\n{code:java}\npublic static List<String> getSenders(Message message) throws MessagingException\n    {\n\n        ArrayList<String> senders = new ArrayList<String>();\n        Address[] addresses = message.getFrom();\n        if (addresses != null)\n        {\n            for (int i = 0; i < addresses.length; i++)\n            {\n                if (addresses[i] instanceof InternetAddress)\n                {\n                    InternetAddress addr = (InternetAddress) addresses[i];\n                    // Trim down the email address to remove any whitespace etc.\n                    String emailAddress = StringUtils.trimToNull(addr.getAddress());\n                    if (emailAddress != null)\n                    {\n                        senders.add(emailAddress);\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n        }\n        return senders;\n    }\n{code}\n\nThus, when creating a new issue from email, the issue reporter will be the user that is retrieved from the \"From\" header of the email. \n\nHowever in some cases, this might not be accurate as the \"From\" header of the email might not contain the correct sender email address. As an example, when the create issue handler process emails that have the \"From\" header such as below, the issue will be created using the wrong email address:\n{noformat}\nDate: Tue, 23 Dec 2014 10:33:55 +0800\nFrom: \"'test' via support\" <support@bitbucket.org>\nReply-To: test@mail.com\nTo: \"support\" <support@bitbucket.org>\n{noformat}\n\nTherefore as a suggestion, the create issue handler should also inspect the \"Reply-To\" header when getting the reporter email address, as the \"From\" header might contain the wrong address.",

However, if endpoint identification (see SSLParameters.getEndpointIdentificationAlgorithm) is enabled for a connection or the potentially changed certificate is for the same 'identity' as the last certificate seen then the connection is permitted. If the identity of the certificate has changed then a \"javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: server certificate change is restricted during renegotiation\" exception is raised.\n\nNote: two identities are considered equal in this case if:\na) There is a subject alternative name specified in both certificates which is an IP address and the IP address in both certificates is the same.\nb) There is a subject alternative name specified in both certificates which is a DNS name and the DNS name in both certificates is the same.\nc) The subject and issuer fields are present in both certificates and contain identical subject and issuer values.\n\n*Possible solution*\nIf you encounter a \"javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: server certificate change is restricted during renegotiation\" error try restarting JIRA. If the issue persists open a support issue.\n\n*Workarounds*\n* It is possible to disable the unsafe server certificate protection by applying the following JVM argument:\n{code}\n-Djdk.tls.allowUnsafeServerCertChange=true \n{code}\n",

This leads to admins getting questions about fields disappearing, when they haven't.\n\nWould it be possible to re-organise this screen in a way that shows more logic to the end users, or possibly allow custom ordering of the fields?",

At the same time, every element of the JIRA that has been provided with an help, would be enabled to show the documentation.\nIt would be so possible to:\n- Document screens\n- Document fields (possibily on screens)\n- Document states (possibly on workflows)\n- Document workflows\n- Document validations on workflows\nand so on\u2026 with an integrated help on line in Jira",

Summary\nWhen adding custom fields to JIRA issue screens, it is not possible to dictate where these fields show up. Currently custom fields always show up in the left hand column of the 'Details' section of the issue.\n\nh3. Environment\nCloud - 1000.305.0\nServer - Current\n\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\n# Create a new custom field or utilize an existing one\n# Edit any screen within a project\n# Add this custom field to the screen\n# Create a new ticket\n# Ensure that you have input data into this custom field\n# View the new ticket\n\nh3. Expected Results\nWhen editing the screen, a user should have the ability to specify which column the field will be displayed in just like he/she can place fields on separate tabs\n\nh3. Actual Results\nThere is actually no option to specify field location within the screen edit page\n \nh3. Notes\nIn addition to this, it would helpful if custom sections could be created for JIRA tickets as well\t\t",

This new issue experience has been completely redesigned and includes a single status transition button with a drop-down, which will show all status's and/or all transitions --> status if you have multiple transitions to a single status within your workflow. The ordering is just alphabetical within each status category (to do, in progress, done).\r\n\r\nThe new issue view is available to all Jira users. You can enable it by going to your personal settings, then scrolling down to find a Jira Labs section and enabling it.\r\n\r\nWorkflow transitions and status are a key part of any Jira issue, so our aim was to make it much more prominent, easier to understand, and easier to update when you want to make a change. You can read more about all the new features here:\r\n - [The new Jira issue view - Atlassian Documentation|https://confluence.atlassian.com/jiracorecloud/the-new-jira-issue-view-938040503.html#ThenewJiraissueview-Simpletransitions.]\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask.

It's also the case for some Connect add-ons.\n\nh5.cause\nDue to a temporary bug we just encountered, JIRA is parsing usernames incorrectly when *there's a space in the username*. That's why Connect add-ons using username as a parameter are affected too. A bug fix in in progress.\n\nh5. WORKAROUND\nThe bug fix is in progress. If access is urgent for your team you can work around the issue by renaming the user to remove all spaces from their username. Only users with _site-admins_ access can rename users.\n\n(i) UPDATE 12/1/15 13:00hrs GMT+0: We are currently still working on a fix at the back end. The fix will be released to all affected Cloud instances soonest possible. Please *watch* this issue to get latest information on the fix.\n(i) UPDATE 12/1/15 13:30hrs GMT+0: This issue is confirmed to affect also JIRA Server 6.3.13 and will be fixed in 6.3.14\n(i) UPDATE 12/1/15 13:50hrs GMT+0: We are currently testing a fix and will start deployment shortly if successful.",

For source code control we are using PlasticSCM since it's the best state of the art tool for that. We have experiences with git, subversion, cvs and mercuical but all of them are not a patch on PlasticSCM. Unfortunately non of the Atlassian products supports PlasticSCM directly.\n\nCurrently we are using the PlasticSCM plugins provides by Codice. But most of the time there are not as nice integrated as the repositories which are directly supported by Atlassian. \n\nWe think it is necessary for Atlassian to support PlasticSCM natively, since it's the best SCM system on the market, at least in our opinion. The native support would add value to all Atlassian products.\n\nEspecially Fisheye would benefit of a PlasticSCM support, since there isn't a plugin available yet. If you would integrate PlasticSCM support to Fisheye, we would immediatly buy a License for our Company. And I am sure others will do the same!\n",
