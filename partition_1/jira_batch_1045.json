The point of software enhancements is to make our job easier, NOT require numerous actions every time one tries to do things.\r\n\r\nThe term _Task_ is a predominant term for our tickets however Jira ALWAYS assumes I want to search for tickets with the type _Task_. In order for me to search for tickets with _Task_ in the query, it requires FIVE (5) steps.  \r\n\r\nHere is an every day occurrence:\r\n# Search for a ticket (e.g. \"Task Graph resize\")\r\n# No results because it is search for \"Graph Resize\" and type=\"Task\")\r\n#* At this point the _Smart querying activated. Run search without smart query_ popup appears\r\n# Click the link to disable Smart Query\r\n#* Nothing because the Type selector set to Task remains\r\n# Clear the Type selector\r\n# Type _Task_ into the search text input\r\n\r\nThis is the most annoying feature and I just wish that there was a preference to disable it.\r\n\r\n\u00a0",

If you do something that indirectly triggers a bulk migration (like changing the issue type scheme), this 999 limit is not checked (because you cannot partially migrate to a new issue type scheme) and so the migration may fail.\r\nh3. Workaround - MANUAL EFFORT:\r\n * Backup your Jira data and save it in a safe place.\r\n * Create a new project with a similar configuration to the current one, but already having the required issue type scheme.\r\n * Move issues from the old project to the new one in batches of 999.\r\n\r\nIf it is OK to have all the issues in the new project, then you are done. If the project must be kept the same, then:\r\n * Change the old project issue type scheme as required.

It would be great if that could be translated to shortcuts from the\u00a0lightning bolt icon and have the same popup to create an issue or add to existing issue (which would then post in slack that an issue was created). I realize there are third party apps that provide this, but seems like most of the functionality is already available in Jira Cloud app and would avoid having to integrate with another provider.\r\n\r\nIt would also be great, to be able to do Jira search directly from slack.\r\n\r\nThank you!",

Thanks for your feedback.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n Atlassian Cloud team\r\n{panel}\r\n\u00a0\r\nh3. Issue Summary\r\n\r\nFrom a parent ticket (in the new issue view), an assignee cannot be selected in-line for a subtask, if the subtask does not already have an assignee. In order to select an assignee, the subtask must be opened. After an assignee is selected, then this can be changed inline from the parent ticket.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nNote that this behaviour is also inconsistent with issues from an epic - where assignees can be selected in-line for issues with no assignees, from the epic ticket.\u00a0\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Create an issue (parent ticket)\r\n # Create a subtask with no assignee\r\n # From the parent ticket, try to select an assignee in-line (without clicking into the subtask)\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nFrom the parent ticket, I should be able to select an assignee through an inline action (without having to open up the subtask). Similar to selecting assignees for issues within an epic.\u00a0\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nThere is no way to select an assignee for a subtask, from the parent ticket, without opening up the subtask.\u00a0\r\nh3.
