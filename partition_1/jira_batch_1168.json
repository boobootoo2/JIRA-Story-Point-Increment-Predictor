This can lead to confusion for the following reason:\n\nLet's say a user wants to search for all issues created between the start of the day on June 25th, and the end of the day of June 27th. A user would likely put those two dates in the basic search on Created Date (Between dates June 25th through June 27th). This would yield the following JQL:\n\n{code}created >= 2016-01-25 AND created <= 2016-01-27{code}\n\nIn JQL, 'created' assumes the time of 00:00 unless specified otherwise (which cannot be done in the basic search), which would mean that their search yields:\n\n{code}created >= \"2016-01-25 00:00\" AND created <= \"2016-01-27 00:00\"{code}\n\nUnless a ticket was created on midnight of the 27th, that entire day will not be included in the search. A majority of users would expect the basic search to yield the following advanced JQL instead:\n\n{code}created >= \"2016-01-25 00:00\" AND created <= \"2016-01-27 23:59\"{code}\n\nWithout being able to specify the times of day in the basic search, only assumed times are used, and if a user doesn't know to configure the JQL in advanced search or search a day above the results they need, they will not be seeing all of the issues they are looking for.",

The problem is that the cloning issues makes our issues less manageable. It would carry over too much information from the old issue such as assignee, due dates, fix versions, sprint, etc. while the new cloned issue hasn't been worked on. What the user really wants to do is just copy over the summary, description, etc.\n\nh3.

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-59531].\n  {panel}\n\nh3. Problem Definition\n* The documentation  https://confluence.atlassian.com/jira/connecting-jira-to-postgresql-185729433.html cover a minimal amount of basic security configuration so that the database user ID which JIRA uses to connect to the database is properly configured. It would be great if this article be clarified and extended so a systems administrator can configure PostgreSQL for JIRA quickly, without having to do a lot of research or carefully study the dozens of comments in the link you provided.\n* Specifically, the existing documentation describes PostgreSQL commands to create the empty jiradb database and establish the PostgreSQL user named 'jira'. But the existing documentation neglects to describe configuring securty so PostgreSQL user id's and passwords are utilized for authentication (which is how JIRA and Confluence expect PostgreSQL to behave).\n* This would help numerous Atassian end users, reduce database connectivity issues and perhaps reduce end-user support requests at Atlassian. The current documentation on this process could stand to be improved.\n\nh3. Suggested Solution\n* Please include how to configure PostgreSQL security in pg_hba.conf. The instructions provided by Atlasssian advise an authentication type of 'trust', which is insecure.\n* The documentation should be clarified and expanded to provide directions for setting up the jira database user using 'md5' type authentication in pg_hba.conf.\n\nh3. Workaround \nRefer to the PostgreSQL official documentation :\n* http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/auth-pg-hba-conf.html",

It's just to give us a little bit more of the already existing information in the UI.\n\nAnother option would be to let health checker only check the tables relevant for JIRA but this could become a more difficult task since this might be hard to answer for some tables.\n\nRegards,\nDieter",

Summary\nThe \"Log Work\" functionality is using the JIRA System \"Default user time zone\" to set the \"Date Started\".\nIt should be using the \"User Time zone\" set in the Profile section\n\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\n# Go to an issue, click on \"Log Work\" and check the Time in \"Date Started\"\n# Change your user timezone by going to your Profile\n# Refresh the issue\n# Click on \"Log Work\" and check the \"Date Started\" field again\n\nh3. Expected Results\nThe Time defaults to the timezone recently set in the profile\n\nh3. Actual Results\nThe Time remains the same as before because it still uses the JIRA \"Default user time zone\"\n\nh3. Notes\nChanging the JIRA \"Default user time zone\" under \"General Configuration\" will change the time shown by default by the \"Log Work\", confirming the link between them.\nAll other dates in the issues, such as Created, Updated, Comment times, change accordingly to the user timezone.",

Problem Definition\nWhen modifying a workflow, or setting up a workflow, it would be good to ensure the transition lines do not over lap statuses, and ideally an option to 'tidy' the workflow exists. \n\nThere is no feature to prevent the lines from running over the status labels, however it is typically possible to layout most workflows so that they don't have lines (transition connections) overlapping the actual status labels. \n\nh3. Suggested Solution\nLook at implementing a method to tidy or avoid the transition lines overlapping the Status transitions.  \n\nh3. Workaround\nManually move the statuses and transitions around in the Workflow designer until the Workflow is easy to read and no transition lines overlap status in the workflow.  ",

But it would limit my ability to expand JIRA's capacity of work.\n\nAnyways, \n\nCurrently, JIRA has Epic as an \"Agile\" issue type that can gather multiple user stories and bug fixes. However, there are some users that are confused on understanding the meaning of the word *Epic*. Is Epic a requirement issue type? Super User Stories? Or something else. \n\nIn order for me as JIRA administrator is to extend the ability to create other Epic level issue types (like Requirement, etc) in order for users to get clarity on creating their tickets. \n\nP.S: As a reference, look how admins are able to create subtask-level issue types in addition to the *Sub-task*.\n\nThanks",

However, since our Company (3500+ Employees) uses a quite big Installation of which only a fraction of users will use JIRA and which has quite a complicated Sub-Unit structure, we will not grant an Application running outside of our control Admin-Rights.\n\nIt appears to me, that you only use that to pull users from GApps, which is not necessary.

There is also the tmp folder, which looks to be the same kind of thing. I'd guess those two locations are the most likely to be modified during a copy.\n\nI've tried copying the HOME folder without either of those two directories (using exclude commands in rsync) and Jira actually starts up fine without them. It re-creates them when it first runs and starts to fill them with content again. The index page says that the index is missing and that it should be restored and re-built; re-creating it only took 6 minutes or our test system.\n\nI think it would be very good to update the documentation in light of all this. Right now, it says \"create a snapshot of the data directory (including all files and subdirectories), then back up the snapshot\":\n\nhttps://confluence.atlassian.com/jira/backing-up-data-185729581.html\n\nI think it would be better and clearer to say:\n\n\"The recommended method of backing up the data directory is to copy it to another location while excluding both the /jira-data/caches/ and /jira-data/tmp folders, and then to archive the copied folder (using zip, tar.gz, etc). This is because the content in those two folders is frequently modified, which may cause the copy to fail, and because Jira will simply re-create these folders and their content if they are missing.\n\nNOTE: the Jira index is stored inside the caches directory, so will be lost using this method. You can enable \"restorable index\" in the system options to create backups of the index, which you can then restore later. Alternatively, if time is available, you can re-create the index from scratch after you have restored Jira.\n\nHere is an example rsync command for the copy:\n\nrsync -avh --delete --exclude 'caches' --exclude 'tmp' --stats --progress /jira-data/ /jira-rsync/\n\n\"\n\nThat would definately have helped me when I was configuring the backup.\n{quote}",
