[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-43367].\n  {panel}\n\nHi,\n   Recently I had an issue about the Postgres JDBC driver and I found an inconsistence at JIRA documents.\n   The standalone installation of JIRA does not require changing the JDBC driver if JIRA is not WAR (Connecting JIRA to PostgreSQL|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Connecting+JIRA+to+PostgreSQL]), but the [Supported Platforms|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Supported+Platforms] document says or seems to say that he DB version should match the JDBC version. This information is causing some noise at the customers and took me some time to understand what should I do. I think is important to clear this out to reduce this friction.\n\n   I'm not sure about the solution. Maybe is recommend leave the old JDBC 9.0 with newer versions of Postgres since this is the bundle driver or is recommend follow the JIRA war process to install the JDBC new driver. The comment from James Rice (at references below) resumes this inconsistence.\n   \n   References for this request:\n   * Issue [JSP-231367|https://support.atlassian.com/browse/JSP-231367];\n   * James Rice comment at Jan 28, 2015 from [Connecting JIRA to PostgreSQL|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Connecting+JIRA+to+PostgreSQL] page.\n\nThanks a lot,\nDaniel P Santos",

This is similar to how you can set a specific edit screen for each transition, but instead of it not displaying a screen when one isn't specified it would go to the scheme default.\n\nToday to get that functionality you have to use a combination of loop back states, behaviors and/or other plug-ins, but if the workflows allowed the specification of an edit screen on each state in addition to the default edit screen it would be easier to configure and the functionality would be more consistent for the users since they would be able to use the \"Edit\" button more often.   \n\n",

For example, when I set a ticket to Customer, I fill in the same Comment, set the Date to the currrent value and then click Customer. When I cancel a ticket, I set the same values every time and then click Cancel.\n\nWouldn't it be great to have a single button or link that I could press (perhaps in a sidebar) that would do it all for me?\n\nI have not found anything similar after a quick search. There are references to default templates and some rule automation in Confluence and the Cloud but that's not what I'm looking for. I want to be able to define an action or default values in multiple fields whenever I click a button or link.\n\nCan this functionality be added?\n\nMany thanks,\nDenis.",

I have two tables, one for service users, one for assets.

It shows the comment on the Asset, and that there is a link on the user (if I look at \"ALL\" in the activitiy of the issue).\nHowever, If I go to the asset and delete the link to the user, what shows is\nASSET HISTORY: Admin made changes - 8 minutes ago\n                              Link \tThis issue alloc'd to USER-869 [ USER-869 ] \t \nUSER HISTORY:  Admin made changes - 9 minutes ago\n                              Link \tThis issue alloc'd to ASSET-7224 [ ASSET-7224 ]\n\nAdditionally, if I go to the user record (user-869) and then use the Activity tab within Activity on the issue (as it's a little prettier), it tells you \n    \"Admin: Admin removed the Link of USER-869 - JO HARDMAN\n                 Core10 minutes ago\"\nBut that is not what has happened. What has happened is the deletion of the link to Asset-7224. It makes no sense making the Activity bit unusable, and the ALL bit unusable.\n\nWhy does the ALL tab not say that the link is removed? or the ACTIVITY tab not say what has been removed?  We need to keep a history of the links for the whole service desk. Any advice would be appreciated as at present, this is unworkable and we may need to look at another solution.\n(see attached for examples of what the ALL and ACTIVITY tabs show for each issue being linked/link removed.)\n",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-43274].\n  {panel}\n\nh3. Problem Definition\n\nCurrently, there is no method for JIRA to perform any data validation/detection when it comes to checking the integrity of the data within JIRA. As a result, whenever there is any problems with the integrity of the data within JIRA, it does not get detected beforehand. As a result, sometimes the problem is only detected when it's too late (for example, when upgrading).\n\nh3. Suggested Solution\n\nIt would be great if we have some sort of method or tool that can detect and validate the integrity of the data in an instance. This way many data integrity issues can be detected early and solved. The current Integrity Checker does not seem to be able to detect these issues. Perhaps a health check tool instead?",

During a sprint, sometimes the scope or nature of a story changes due to new requirements or discoveries.  We sometimes need to move a portion of a story's sub-tasks in to a new one, and push it in to our backlog.\n\nThe current process involves:\n\n# Creating the story or stories we need to move the sub-tasks too (unless they already exist, which is rare).\n# Navigating to the story that hosts the sub-tasks we need to move.\n# Select the \"More \\ Move All Sub-tasks\" feature\n# Select the sub-tasks to move\n# Select the story to move them to\n# Then select \"Move Sub-tasks\"\n\nA simpler experience would be not to create the target stories in preparation of the move.  Rather just create the story inline with the move process:\n\n#...\n# Select the sub-tasks to move\n# Select \"Create a new story\"\n# Then select \"Move Sub-tasks\"\n# Present the \"Create\" pop-up window\n# Create the story and save\n\nThis helps keep the team workflow in line with the conversation and simplifies the overall effort.",

Due to this, they manually log in https://my.atlassian.com and click to generate a New Evaluation License, where they're asked to provide a Server ID. At this step, Server ID is nowhere to be found if users are not curious enough to click to see method 3, where it is displayed.\n\n*Suggestion*\n{panel}Server ID should be displayed explicitly at Specify Your License Key step in the Setup Wizard, no matter which method is selected.{panel}\n\n*Notes*\nOn https://my.atlassian.com/license/evaluation, the guide to get Server ID seems to be obsolete, showing an old Setup Wizard where Server ID was explicitly presented:\n!serverid.png|thumbnail!",

Currently, JIRA uses relative dates for the first 7 days, then switches to absolute dates.  We would like to be able to configure the number of days before converting to absolute dates.  For example, it would be nice to set this to only 3 days.  It would also be nice to be able to change this setting on a per-user basis.\n\nWe know that it's possible to [disable relative dates|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRAKB/Disable+Relative+Dates+in+JIRA] completely, but that doesn't get what we want.  We are also aware that hovering over the relative date shows the absolute date.  Again, this isn't quite enough and requires action from the user as opposed to being able to quickly glance at a screen to see the right level of information.\n\nWhat we'd like is :\n# To be able to set a User Default value for the number of relative days before converting to absolute dates.  \n# To allow users to override this preference individually in their profile.\n# To allow users to effectively disable relative dates by setting the preference to {{0}} days, meaning always show absolute dates.\n\n*NOTE:* This is in addition to the request to [Display Relative Dates with Times|JRA-42780]",

The 'Security Level' field is not present on the form you are viewing\n\nwith a description of:\n\nbq. The 'Security Level' field is not included in the 'Default User Story Screen' screen configured for this issue. To solve this problem, go to 'Default User Story Screen' Screen configuration settings and add the field.\n\nThe screen configurations were all correct - the field should have been showing.\n\nWe were able to get around this by creating a custom single-line text field also called \"Security Level\" with some random text as a default value, making both visible on the default screen scheme, and then hiding the dummy custom field. This made the real field visible on-screen and work as expected.",
