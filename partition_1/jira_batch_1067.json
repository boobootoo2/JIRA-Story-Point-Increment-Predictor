That is, an app with a developer license only works in a host product that also has a developer license.\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nIn two separate tickets, I was told by support that [Cloud development instances|https://blog.developer.atlassian.com/cloud-ecosystem-dev-env/]\u00a0can be used\u00a0for Dev/Staging clones of a production instance, and that I would not have to pay for those instances as long as I stayed below the usage limits (which is a whole 'other story.)\r\n\r\nAnyways though, it's hard to have a proper Dev/Staging environment without add-ons, or having to worry about add-ons constantly expiring.",
