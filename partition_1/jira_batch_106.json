      "description": "Quite frequently, a click on any of the items in the sidebar under WORKSPACE, BRANCHES, REMOTES, etc. will be partially ignored. When this happens, the sidebar item is selected but the view is not changed to match.\r\n\r\nFor instance, clicking on a branch under BRANCHES may select the branch name in the sidebar but not select the branch commit in the history view. Or if the File Status or Search views were previously selected, then history view will not be shown.\r\n\r\nAnother example is clicking between \"File status\" or \"History\" under WORKSPACE. The selected workspace changes in the sidebar, but not in the window.\r\n\r\nBecause the selection in the sidebar changes, and clicks on the currently selected sidebar item are naturally (and correctly) ignored, when this bug occurs you must click to select some other sidebar item, then click back on the one you really wanted to view. As an example, if I'm in the history view and want to switch to File Status but the click on file status is ignored, then I have to click on, say, a branch name then back on File Status in order to actually switch to the file status view (assuming none of the other clicks are ignored).\r\n\r\nThere doesn't seem to be much of or any pattern to when sidebar clicks are ignored. This makes it difficult to provide step by step instructions to reproduce. I'll try to record a screencast to demonstrate the issue.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThis bug combines with SRCTREE-2936 to form a major usability issue for SourceTree. They both interrupt my workflow all the time, to the point that I'm considering moving away from SourceTree after using it for many years (with growing frustration).",

This would've opened the current directory in Sourcetree, whether the current directory was bookmarked or not.\r\n\r\nWith v3.0 the same command won't apparently do nothing.\r\n\r\nThe issue doesn't seem to be related to the relative path either, because if I were to try to open with *{{`stree /Users/me/foobar`}}*, Sourcetree doesn't open the repository just the same.\r\n\r\nI think this is a regression that needs to be solved.\r\n\r\nThank you.",
