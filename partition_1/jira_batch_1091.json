      "description": "h3. Problem Definition\r\n * By design, Jira keeps a record of old issue keys when an issue is moved or a project key is changed\r\n * When a project key is changed, Jira creates issue keys for _each_ project key that has ever existed for the project that the issue is currently in. Example:\r\n{quote} * Project A, which is then renamed to B, then to C, then to D...\r\n * Then issue D is created with the issue key D-100.\r\n * Then the issue is moved to project FOO, and now has the issue key FOO-42\r\n\r\nThe records in the \"moved_issue_key\" in the Jira database will contain records for A, B, C (even though the issue never was in the project at the time), i.e. it will be discoverable as A-100, B-100, C-100, D-100 and FOO-42.\r\n{quote}\r\n * Jira allows searching of old issue keys\r\n * This is fine, however, if a customer is using an old list of issue keys, there may be some discrepancies in the results or unintended results\r\n * The results may be confusing or if a customer chooses to make a bulk change, then that action could have unintended results\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n * Allow Jira to keep a longer record of project key/issue key changes and make that data available to users in Jira\r\n * Show the move/change history in Issue Navigator\r\n * Show the move/change history in a field which in turn will be displayed in the JQL query results(column)\r\n\r\nh3. Why this is important\r\n * When searching using JQL, it's not always clear if the returned search query contains issues that have been moved and are no longer relevant to the query\r\n * On a side note: this discrepancy\u00a0can only occur if old issue keys are explicitly referenced by the user or in an old comment/issue description, summary, custom field etc.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n * Find the \"issue id\" of an issue by hovering on any of the buttons on the full issue view and looking at the URL(usually displayed at the bottom of the browser), e.g.\u00a0https://<instance_name>.atlassian.net/secure/EditIssue!default.jspa?id=2472909.\u00a0 The \"issue id\" is\u00a02472909.\u00a0 Once the \"issue id\" has been obtained, then the JQL query can be run as so:\r\n{noformat}\r\nissue in (2472909,2472908)\r\n{noformat}\r\n * Contact Jira Cloud Support for information regarding issue history",

      "description": "h3. *Summary*\r\n\r\nIn the New Jira Experience, when navigating from one tab to another in the project page, the usual behavior is that the last accessed page in the project is memorized and when the user navigates to another project and returns back to the original project, it will redirect the user back to the last opened page in the that project. Though, in the New Jira Experience, when a new Software project is created, the default page is the Issue tab \"All Open Issues\", the moment the \"Reports\" tab is opened, even if the user opens the \"All Open Issues\" tab back again and navigates to another project and comes back to the original project, it will redirect back to the \"Reports\" page always.\r\nh3. *Environment*\r\n - New Jira Experience\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n*Steps to Reproduce*\r\n # Create a new Software project > Create some dummy issues(if needed)\r\n # (From Jira Main-page) > Click on Projects on the left navigation bar > Click on the Project name (either on Recently viewed or the list of projects) > The default project page will be the All Issues page under the Issue tab.\r\n # Click on Reports tab > navigate to another project, return back it shows Reports tab(which is correct)\r\n # From there, click on Setting tab, Issue tab and navigate to another project, return back it still shows Reports tab.\r\n # Exit the instance > Login back > Access the Projects tab > Click on the Project > Still shows Reports tab as last accessed.\r\n\r\nh3. *Expected Results*\r\n\r\nTo be able to navigate back to the correct last opened page in a Software Project\r\nh3. *Actual Results*\r\n\r\nKeeps navigating back to Reports tab\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n*Side Note*\r\n- If you click on the Component tab, then it will keep bringing up the Component tab, even if you switch back to Reports tab, it still maintains the Component tab.",
