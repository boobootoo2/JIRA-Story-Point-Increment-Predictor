This way the branch is named properly and linked to the ticket effortlessly.\r\n\r\nWhen I click on the \"Create branch\" button in the ticket I expect that a new tab opens with the Bitbucket interface while leaving my tab with the Jira board intact.\r\n\r\nWhat actually happens is that when I click on \"Create branch\" I get redirected to Bitbucket and after creating the branch I have to go back to my Jira board somehow.\r\n\r\nIt is not an issue that disrupts my workflow or makes me loose too much time but it adds to improve the user experience.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThanks in advance,\r\n\r\nCarlos Moro Garc\u00eda",

      "description": "h3. Summary\r\n\r\nThis BUG occurs in a very specific scenario. If we add a post-function to trigger a custom webhook, the 'system' webhook which is also triggered intermittently doesn't contain *changelog* information. The custom webhook is apparently not affected.\r\n\r\nThe broken webhook in question can be verified using the [Cloud Inspector|https://connect-inspector.prod.public.atl-paas.net/page/start ] tool.\r\n\r\nThe more post-functions to fire webhooks we add, more likely the transition will not trigger a notification in add-ons that need the *changelog* information that is sent along with the webhook payload. The information related to the changelog won't be found on the webhook JSON payload. \r\n\r\nPlease note that this information won't be available on webhooks fired by default by the system. It seems that they are not the same as the regular webhooks that are fired by JIRA (AO_4AEACD_WEBHOOK_DAO). We can only see this when using the connect-inspector to monitor the webhooks fired: https://connect-inspector.prod.public.atl-paas.net/page/start \r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Install the connect-inspector in a test instance - https://connect-inspector.prod.public.atl-paas.net/page/start \r\n# Create a workflow that has a transition setup exactly like the following: \r\n** With a screen associated\r\n** With at least two post-functions to trigger regular webhooks - _Send transition to webhook: YourWebhook_\r\n# Start to add more post-functions to trigger other webhooks one by one and transition the issue while monitoring the payload catch by the connect-inspector\r\n# At some point, the connect-inspector will show that no data regarding the changelog information is being recorded on the JSON payload.\r\n\r\nE.g.:\r\n\r\n !post functions.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nThe JSON payload should contain this kind of information when the issue is transitioned, no matter how many post-functions are triggering webhooks:\r\n\r\n{code}\r\n\"changelog\": {\r\n    \"id\": \"966624\",\r\n    \"items\": [\r\n      {\r\n        \"field\": \"resolution\",\r\n        \"fieldtype\": \"jira\",\r\n        \"fieldId\": \"resolution\",\r\n        \"from\": \"10000\",\r\n        \"fromString\": \"Done\",\r\n        \"to\": null,\r\n        \"toString\": null\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        \"field\": \"status\",\r\n        \"fieldtype\": \"jira\",\r\n        \"fieldId\": \"status\",\r\n        \"from\": \"10104\",\r\n        \"fromString\": \"Completed\",\r\n        \"to\": \"3\",\r\n        \"toString\": \"In Progress\"\r\n       }\r\n    ]\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nJSON end\r\n\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nThe webhook payload that is sent to add-ons for consumption will not have the changelog information:\r\n\r\n{code}\r\n...\r\n\r\n\"customfield_13900\": null,\r\n      \"customfield_15802\": null,\r\n      \"customfield_13902\": null,\r\n      \"customfield_15803\": null,\r\n      \"customfield_13901\": null,\r\n      \"comment\": {\r\n        \"comments\": [],\r\n        \"maxResults\": 0,\r\n        \"total\": 0,\r\n        \"startAt\": 0\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nJSON end\r\n\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nAs we can see above, the JSON ends without having information about the changelog. \r\n\r\nh3. Notes\r\n\r\nThis is known to cause at least this problem:\r\n* Add-ons like Slack rely on the changelog information to display a notification on a channel about the issue being transitioned.\r\n",

When typing in search and hitting enter right after text input, Jira will redirect you to the first chosen result - it can be a first result of the search or it can be 'View all issues' link or anything 'cached' from previous search.\r\nAs a result, your search will redirect you to 'random' pages.\r\n\r\nExpectations:\r\nIf at the moment of hitting enter after text input there were no results found yet, redirect to the 'Issue search' page that includes search pattern similar to 'View all matching issues', i.e.:\r\n\r\nsummary ~ \"<search_text>\" ** OR description ~ \"<search_text>\" ORDER BY lastViewed DESC\r\n\r\n2. Implement 'smart search'.\r\nFor example, you have issue 'IT-123' with a subject 'Test'.\r\nIf you try to search for 'IT test', there will be no results of the issue 'IT-123'\r\nIf you try to search for 'IT 123', there will be no results of the issue 'IT-123'\r\n\r\n3. When search is empty and you hit enter - Jira redirects you to 'advanced search' screen.",

Much like how the permission scheme works, access allowed only if specified.\r\nh3. *Why is This Required*\r\n\r\nThis can help to improve security to ensure users who are not specified in the group are not mistakenly allowed to be able to access the menu in the Application Switcher. This also helps to empower the user with more management and control in a much simpler process instead of keeping track of the Application Switcher each and every time some changes are made to the users or groups in the instance.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0",

      "description": "When we can use components as we work with versions and epics - life will be beautiful. Because it will be very easy to start using components by then. Additionally I've read articles where Atlassian writes that EPICS are basically BIG stories / a group of issues. Now I see that EPICS are used as components a bit which is not ok. Basically you want to close an EPIC - but now it's a kind of module so it will never be closed. We should use components, but it's not easy enough to assign issues to a component and when assigned - components are not visible enough.\r\n\r\nFrom my perspective it would be great to have the Components in vertical menu, assign stories to it by drag-and-drop (and auto assign when configured), see components in issues automatically and be able to quick-filter on them\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to how to display components in an issue - I will create another story.",
