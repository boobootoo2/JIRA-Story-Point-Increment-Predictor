Unfortunately, this plugin only enables voters to Like or Dislike a comment within issue and provides a summary tally of Comment Likes/Dislikes. It does not provide a way to see who voted for/against or who abstained vs did not vote at all.\u00a0 This would provide a simple solution for electronic configuration control board approval (or not) for all JIRA Change Requests submitted to our baseline system.\n\nRelated to this requirement is that two of the People fields are not being captured/listed in the current JIRA Issue Activity/History tabs: Votes & Watchers. Only Assignee and Reporter are captured under Activity, etc. Is there a way to add the Votes & Watchers as another tab? That would help on the reporting requirement--sort of.\n\nWhat we really need is to be able to generate Issue level and Project level queries and reports listing Users/Groups showing if and how each person voted, assuming functionality of voting For (Like), Against (Dislike), Abstain (Meh), or Not Voted (Slacker) is added. However, we can't do this now because the current JIRA VOTES field is boolean (either Voted or Not Voted) which only tells you if someone voted or not. It does not tell you if someone is voting FOR, AGAINST, ABSTAINING, is ignoring you, or just hasn't gotten around to voting yet.\n\nPlease add the ability to either customize or add additional values/options to the VOTES field or use the social apps like/dislike features already elsewhere in JIRA Comments and Confluence.\n\nWe are using JIRA version 7.2.0.\n\n\u00a0",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-62542].\n  {panel}\n\nOne of the default JIRA workflows is to mark an issue as \"Resolved\" and then after verification to mark it as \"Closed\". Therefore we need a way to filter for all issues that have been marked as \"Resolved\" but are not yet marked as \"Closed\".\n\nIn JIRA Cloud when I click on \"Issues\" it defaults to \"Open Issues\". That's a reasonable default . But in the \"Switch filter\" list, there is no filter for \"Resolved but not closed\". There is a \"Done issues\" option, but that shows both resolved and closed issues, but for this use case we don't want to see see closed issues. We need to see which issues have been \"Resolved\" but not \"Closed\".\n\nI'm aware that I can manually add some filter, and every time we add a project we can add this to some complicated Boolean expression to include that project in the filter. But that's not what I'm asking for.\n\n* I don't want to have a filter that shows such issues across all projects. I want it to be shown only for the current project. Just like the \"Done issues\" filter.\n* I don't want to have to add a new filter to each project. I don't have to add the \"Done issues\" filter, for example---it's just already there.\n\nSo please add a \"Resolved but not Closed\" filter that is available to each project _by default_. After all, the \"resolved->closed\" workflow is one of the default JIRA workflows, so there needs to be a filter for it.\n\nSee related service desk issue [JST-214454|https://support.atlassian.com/servicedesk/agent/JST/issue/JST-214454].",

This will disable {{com.atlassian.greenhopper.web.sidebar.AgileBoardScopeFilterContextProvider.getContext}} method. \n## Navigate through Administration menu > Add-ons > Manage Add-ons > Select 'JIRA Agile'\n## Expand the JIRA Agile Add-on modules\n## Find the 'board-scope-filter' module and disable it.\n# Disable Project Navigation (Sidebar project navigation) for all users: Administration Menu > System > Project Navigation\n",

If not, indicate the supported versions.\n** license(s) validity\n* A centralized knowledge base of all documentation related to Upgrading JIRA i.e. Upgrade method, process, upgrade notes\n\nh3. Workaround\n* Test upgrade and reach out to JIRA Support if there're any problems in the UI or errors in the logs\n* Reaching out to Support before performing upgrade might help to avoid some problems too, however, Support can only advise based on known issues and documented requirements. There are too many causes of failed upgrade or errors varies because of environment and data, hence test upgrade is the best approach.\n",

Often times this can happen while filling out data, like issue descriptions and comments, the contents of which become lost after being presented with a service error or a 500 \"Service Temporarily Unavailable\". In some cases many paragraphs of work can be lost, and for both myself and those who have been in this situation, it's extremely frustrating. I have began to get in the habbit of selecting all of the content, and coping it to the clipboard every single time I write a description or comment.\n\nI'd like to propose some mechanism to protect that content when a user is ready and take action to persist to the server. The most affected area is likely Jira Comments. Any ability to recover there would be a quick win. A likely approach might be to copy the content, or model to local storage, and allow recovery when Jira is accessible again. At worst case, some sort of \"Save content to Clipboard\" checkbox might work.",

Summary\n\nWhen a custom field configuration is edited and then an issue using that configuration is edited, the *custom field values revert to null or the default option*.\n\nUsers are not likely to notice unless they are attempting to change that field. If they do happen to notice they cannot see the original value in order to restore it to the correct value.\nh3. Environment\n\nJIRA 6.4.14, JIRA 7.1.9, JIRA 7.2.1\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\n # Create a Custom Field called \"Test\" using the \"Select List (single choice)\" type.\n # In the default/Global field configuration, configure three options: A, B, C.\n # Create an issue in Project FOO and set the field value to \"B\".\n # Create a new custom field context.\n # Configure the same three options for the field in this configuration: A, B, C.\n # Configure Project FOO to use this field configuration for the type of issue you created in Step 3.\n # Click \"Edit\" for the issue you created previously.\n\nh3. Expected Results\n * After the field configuration is changed, existing values for the field should be preserved unless they cannot be mapped to options in the new configuration.\n * Alternatively, JIRA should highlight the modified field values\u00a0in some way so the user knows they must make a change in the Edit screen.\n\nh3. Actual Results\n * If the user does not modify anything on the \"Edit\" screen and clicks update, the field value will be changed to either 'None' or the first available field option.\n ** If the field is *optional*, the field will be set to 'None'\u00a0in the Edit screen.\n ** If the field is *required*, the field will be set to the first available option, not the default option, in the Edit screen.\n\nh3. Workaround\n\nAdministrators: After changing the field configuration for a project, for each custom field value you wish to preserve...\n # Search for issues that have the custom field set to that value.\n # Bulk edit the issues to set them to the correct value in the new field configuration (even if that value matches the default field config)\n\nDetailed description and steps for the workaround are at [Change Context for an Existing Custom Field Without Losing Old Data|https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirakb/change-context-for-an-existing-custom-field-without-losing-old-data-674990056.html].",

This makes it not possible to guarantee data consistency for all your user's first and last names. Also, this will reflect any Application that needs the object for other purposes.\n\nh3.

Summary\nAfter the first startup, if an user uses the CSV importer under *Issues > Import issues from CSV*, the conversion of time estimates will misbehave.\n\n*Example:* importing a file with the below data results in *Original Estimate* set to 8 minutes.\n\n{code:none|borderStyle=solid|borderColor=#6A8EB3|bgColor=#F8F8F8}\nIssue ID, Summary, Issue Type, Assignee, Due Date, Original Estimate\n1, Test Import Task 1, Task, admin, 09/Sep/16, 28800\n{code}\n\nh3. Expected Behavior\nGiven our documentation on the CSV importer says that estimates should be set in seconds, the estimate for that imported issues should be 8 hours (28800 seconds / 60 = 480 minutes / 60 = 8 hours).\n\nh3.

Summary\nWhen updating user picker value during a workflow transition screen, if the transition is blocked due to other system/workflow validator condition, after updating the field needed, the user picker value will not be updated properly\n\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\n# On a freshly installed instance, create a transition screen which has _assignee_ field and _summary_ field\n# Summary field by default has a validator hard coded to it, where this field will need to have a value\n# Append the transition screen to any workflow transition\n# Publish the workflow\n# Trigger the transition screen by performing the needed transition\n# *Change the assignee field*\n# Remove the Summary value to become empty\n# When saving, the update will fail due to the summary field is empty\n# Insert value to summary field, and resave.\n\nh3. Expected Results\n# Issue will be able to save with updated value for both assignee field and summary\n\nh3. Actual Result\n# Assignee field is not updated accordingly\n [^bug user picker transition.mp4] \n \nh3. Notes\nAfter some testing, it seems that installing JSU and apply plugin validator to other transition will remove the bug. User picker value are updated properly\n [^bug user picker transition2.mp4] \n\nh3.Workaround\nUnverified at the moment, however, worth to try. \n* Install JSU and configure other validator in the workflow.\n",
