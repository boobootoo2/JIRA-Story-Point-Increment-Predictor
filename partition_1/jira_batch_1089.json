Steps to Replicate\r\n\r\nThere isn't a direct way to replicate this issue. Due to, Atlassian Cloud is deprecating username, hence there is no possibility to change username. However, it affects the users that has username changed prior to that.\r\n\r\nh2. Steps to Diagnose\r\n\r\n(!) Support engineer only\r\nRun a check on the {{app_user}} table, the user_key and lower_user_name should have different value:\r\n||id||user_key||lower_user_name||\r\n|10189|abc123|123abc|\r\n\r\n(i) In the case of wrongly mapped user:\r\n||id||user_key||lower_user_name||\r\n|10189|abc123|123abc|\r\n|10190|123abc|123cde|\r\nNote: the lower_user_name has a similar column value of user_key for another row\r\n\r\nThen check what issue user is watcher:\r\n{noformat}\r\nselect (ji.pkey||'-'||ji.issuenum) as key, ua.association_type, ua.source_name, ua.sink_node_id\r\nfrom jiraissue ji, userassociation ua\r\nwhere ua.sink_node_id = ji.id\r\nand ua.association_type = 'WatchIssue'\r\nand ua.source_name = '<extract from the user_key column from app_user>'\r\n{noformat}\r\nThen run a rest call on the issue retrieving the watcher:\r\n [https://example.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/TEST-1/watchers]\r\n\r\nh2. Expected Result\r\n\r\nAll values returned correctly\r\n\r\nh2. Actual Result\r\n\r\nDiscrepancy viewing the user information and rest api call\r\n\r\nh2. More information\r\n\r\nBased on the example given above, the logic for the mapping should be:\r\n* Watcher (abc123) mapped to user_key (abc123) which returns (123abc) that should points to the user with username (123abc)\r\n\r\nHowever, it seems to be having double mapping, hence:\r\n* Case 1: Watcher (abc123) mapped to user_key (abc123) which returns (123abc), and mapped again for user_key (123abc), returning no result\r\n* Case 2: Watcher (abc123) mapped to user_key (abc123) which returns (123abc), and mapped again for user_key (123abc), returning (123cde) which mapped to wrong user (if exist)\r\n\r\nh2. Workaround\r\n\r\nNone found so far",

Summary\r\n\r\nWhen creating loop transitions (transitions that leave from status *Any status* to status *Itself*), the transition is stacked in a box and cannot be organised freely in the Workflow designer as statuses are.\r\n\r\n !Edit_\u2014_Software_Simplified_Workflow_for_Project_SCRUM_-_JIRA.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\nAfter adding several loop statuses, these stacked boxes grow vertically and expands the designer window to which it eventually decreases visibility where you're forced to zoom in to view the names.\r\n\r\nThis can prove very inconvenient for those using numerous loop transitions in their Workflow.\r\n\r\nh2. Proposed solution\r\n\r\nAllow the loop transition to be organised and dragged freely in the Workflow designer so they may be organised in a clean fashion that doesn't minimise the overall visibility.\r\n\r\n\r\nh2. Possible workaround\r\n\r\nUse individual Workflows for each Issue type (even if they are identical) in the Project to limit the total number of loop transitions per Workflow.\r\n\r\n",

Dummy, has a username of *dummy.user* under the Site Administration.\r\n\r\nOnce Dummy is mentioned in *Confluence*, he is mentioned based on his defined nickname, from the *People Directory*, so everyone calls him *@Big Dummy* (a nickname he defined himself) although, once he is mentioned in *Jira*, he's mention becomes *dummy.user*.\r\nh3. More examples\r\n\r\nThis is specially impactful for users that are [provisioned via Okta|https://confluence.atlassian.com/cloud/configure-user-provisioning-with-okta-957492956.html], since users provisioned from there are created with an *Unique Identifier* from Okta, and in order to be mentioned, those users need to called out with the UUID, instead of their display names or emails.\r\nh4. Workaround\r\n\r\nA workaround for this situation, is to provision the user, delete them on the *Site Administration*, and ask those users to log into the application, this will sync the user with the data from the database and allow Jira to fetch the user's mention based on their Display name, and/or email.\u00a0_Site administrators would need to reinvite users to the instance to sign up to see this workaround work for them_",

Workaround\r\n - To turn off the new Jira issue view:\r\n # Click on your user *profile picture* at the lower left corner\r\n # Select *Personal Settings*\r\n # Under *Jira labs*, click on the tick box to *disable the view*\r\n\r\n(!)
