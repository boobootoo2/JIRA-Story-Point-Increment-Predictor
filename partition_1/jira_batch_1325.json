They want to undo changes and baseline scenarios and come back later to compare with other scenarios.\r\nThe fact you have merged the commit to JIRA feature within the same process makes it very hazardous to use. Indeed, if I want to baseline a scenario without committing anything in JIRA, the existing dialog is not appropriate; for that reason, we are not able to recommend Live Plan and stick for now to Classic Plan.\r\nRegards.",

Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Create a plan\r\n# Add some issues.\r\n# Drag to reprioritise.\r\n# This will work. \r\n# Sort the issues by a column (e.g. click on the estimates column header to sort by estimates).\r\n# Hide the estimates column.\r\n# The issues remain sorted by the column, but there is no visual indication of this.\r\n# Try to drag the issues to reprioritise.\r\n# The issues cannot be moved.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nThe sort should automatically be removed when the column is hidden/collapsed.\r\n\r\nh3.Workaround\r\nExpand/un-collapse columns until you find the one the issues are sorted by (the column header will have a grey background). Click on the column header to un-apply the sort. Re-hide the columns if desired. Issues are now displayed in priority order and can be drag-and-dropped to reprioritise.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, the table can be sorted by the _Title_ column (which cannot be hidden) first and then sorting can be un-applied by clicking the title column two more times (first click changes sort direction, second takes the table back to their default sort order by rank which allows for rank operations).",

This is due to the fact that in JIRA all issues are ranked in a \u201cflat\u201d manner: you can have sub-tasks before parents and stories before epics, etc when you search for issues. In Portfolio, issues are displayed based on hierarchy and as such, they cannot be ranked in the same manner as those in JIRA.  \r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\nProvide a way to import these priorities and hierarchies between Portfolio and JIRA, so that they can also be viewed in JIRA. \r\n\r\nh3.

It will show as an Uncommitted change, as it should\r\n# Next, I will go into that same story in Software and change the Release to _Version 2.5_. It updates there, so far so good\r\n# Finally I go back into Portfolio, I have an uncommitted change that is different than my latest update to that same issue in Software.  There is no easy way to tell when looking through uncommitted changes what the effect would be\r\n# If I revert the change in Portfolio, it will show the release as 2.5, the one I made in step 2\r\n# If I commit the change in Portfolio, it will update the issue in Software as well to 2.0, the one I made in step 1\r\n\r\nI don't know what the right solution would be.

      "description": "h3. Summary\r\nThe 3.x releases of pocket-knife included two methods - {{findTableNames}} and {{findColumnNames}} - which used a metadata query known to cause performance problems in Oracle: {{metaData.getTables(null, null, null, null)}} and {{metaData.getColumns(null, null, null, null)}}.\r\n\r\n* http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2068665/oracle-10g-slow-metadata-queries\r\n* https://community.oracle.com/thread/105008?start=0&tstart=0\r\n\r\nThis code has been removed on 4.x releases.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Behavior\r\nOnly retrieve metadata for objects relevant to the operation, which can be achieved by optimizing the call of this method - passing a new parameter to it that filters results.\r\n\r\nExample: {{metaData.getTables(null, null, null, new String[]\\{\"TABLE\"\\})}}\r\n\r\nIn newer releases of pocket-knife, these two methods do not exist anymore. Since it was updated in Feb 2016, JPO should use this new release.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Behavior\r\nThis code ends up retrieving lots of objects from the public schema in Oracle that are not relevant. In one case, it returned 60,000 objects, causing a severe performance bottleneck in JIRA instances connected to this DBMS.\r\n\r\nThis library is used by JPO, and severely impacts the performance of JIRA in some actions when performed right after a restart. One of the actions impacted is adding comments to an issue, but also most of other issue updates.\r\n\r\nThe below can be seen when analyzing hot spots in database queries. Notice the query called by pocket-knife runs for ~35s.\r\n\r\n!add_comment_jpo_pocketknife.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Connect JIRA 7.1.x to an Oracle 12c database;\r\n# Install JPO 1.x;\r\n# Right after JIRA's startup, try creating a new project;\r\n# Notice subsequent creation of projects will be considerably faster;\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\nThere are no known workarounds for this problem yet. However, the slowness is only noticed at the first time any issue update happens, until a restart of JIRA.",

The portfolio could still forecast capacities based on team member hours and skills.  \r\n\r\nIn the classic portfolio, I was able to accomplish this by creating a fake team member with the same number of hours available as the real team members combined.  I would then assign the \"unassigned\" user to all epics and stories that were still in the planning process.  I was effectively doubling my teams capacity in the eyes of Portfolio, so for the trick to work, I had to make sure to assign all issues manually to team members (real or unassigned) so I could maintain control over capacity.\r\n\r\nI would like to have the ability to manage my capacities, while not yet being certain which developers would do the work.

Martin Suntinger asked me to post it here so you can look into it.\r\n\r\nWe are working with a pilot version of the Portfolio Live plans. We connected one of our boards to the plan and it shows a nice schedule. However, when we click the 'recalculate;' button multiple times in a row it completely rearranges the planning of the epics. Sometimes after one click, sometimes after multiple clicks. I'm sure nothing changed on the backlog between clicks that could have influenced the plan. Although some people might like this kind of undeterministic scheduling possibility, our Product Owners and stakeholders get quite unnerved by this (me too). Could you please look into this? It keeps us back from using the Live Plans because we can't trust the outcome.",

      "description": "{panel:bgColor=#e7f4fa}\n  *NOTE:* This bug report is for *JIRA Portfolio Server*. Using *JIRA Portfolio Cloud*? [See the corresponding bug report|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JPOCLOUD-1381].\n  {panel}\n\nI had previously imported issues (Epics, Stories and Tasks) from a live project into a \"Sandpit\" project in our Jira Cloud instance. These were given new issue names on the import so that they are completely separate from the project that they were imported from (SAN-1, SAN-2 etc).\r\n\r\nBefore trying Jira Portfolio Labs, I had previously added a new Issue Type called \"Initiative\" and associated it with the Sandpit project.\r\n\r\nWhen subsequently trying out Jira Portfolio Labs and setting up a plan to import the issues from the Sandpit project, everything appeared to work ok and epics, stories and tasks were imported. There were, of course, no initiatives in the project at this point.\r\n\r\nPortfolio Labs was configured to allow Initiatives in the Scope. When attempting to create new initiatives, this worked correctly. However, when trying to commit the changes back to Jira using \"Review and commit changes\" in Jira Portfolio Labs, the following exception occurred:\r\n\r\nLinked Applications\r\nJIRA\r\nDashboards\r\nProjects\r\nIssues\r\nTempo\r\nBoards\r\nPortfolio\r\nTests\r\n Create\r\n\r\nSearch\r\nHelp\r\nAdministration\r\nUser profile for Gary Bates\r\n\r\nScope\r\n\r\nTeams\r\n\r\nReleases\r\nUntitled plan\r\n2Uncommitted changes\r\nGive feedback\r\nRecalculate\r\nProjects: All\r\nReleases: All\r\nTeams: All\r\n\r\nContains text\r\n\r\nMore\r\n \r\nThere is no iniative in the current result set.\r\n08/Apr/16 - Start11/Apr/16 - Later\r\nScope\r\n\r\nIniative\r\nTitle\r\nReleases\r\nEstimates (h)\r\nProgress\r\nSAN\r\nLiving Well\r\nSAN\r\nAgeing Well\r\nIssues without parent Iniative\r\nLater\r\n40.51\r\nCreate Iniative\r\nReview and commit changes\r\n2 changescouldn't be committed to JIRA.
