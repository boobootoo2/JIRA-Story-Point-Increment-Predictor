Users are wondering why given buttons (to do a state transition) aren't showing up on certain JIRA issues.  But I don't want to add everyone on the project to the jira-administrators group.  Is there a way in JIRA to give all users on a given project permission to have a read-only view of all of the conditions on each of the transitions for the workflows on the project?  If such functionality already exists in JIRA then please direct me to info about it - I did Google searches and searched existing JRA issues but I didn't find anything - I'd be surprised if I'm the first person to want this.

The solution was to edit the respective workflow and manually remove the validator from the transitions. Obviously this is really inconvenient especially if the disabled validator is used in a lot of workflows. So Jira should \"disable\" it on workflow level too and should not try to load the disabled validator.

While this is generally helpful, I find myself having to frequently update the gadget to display the desired timeline.  It also includes all issue types, whereas I have a need to understand how many Defects are incoming versus New Features.\n\nRequest:  As a project manager, I would like to be able to set a start date for the chart in the gadget configuration OR use the existing number of days prior configuration.\n\nUse Case:  Our projects often have continuous testing, and I would like to be able to have a chart that shows the created/resolved defects based on the start date of a of testing for that particular project or Sprint.  To accomplish this, I would need to be able to only view created/resolved defects beginning from a defined date, not a floating date.\n\nThe ability to have that kind of quality view across multiple sprints for a given version is immensely valuable.  One of the key things I want to be able to see is the point at which the resolved tickets surpass the created tickets.  At that point I begin to have confidence that we're trending towards our completion date.  If we're halfway through our schedule for the version, and our created defects are still outpacing our resolved defects, I know I have a serious quality problem to address.",

Problem Definition\n\nCurrently if you forward a mail as an attachment, for example using Microsoft Outlook or Thunderbird, it shows up in a JIRA issue as a file with no extension containing a MIME formatted file containing xhtml with MS Office's extensions. Because there is no extension, clicking on the file does not open it in the appropriate way.\n\nh3. Suggested Solution\n\nAdding a check to rename such a file to be called .eml or .msg would give the necessary hint required for a mail program to successfully open such an attachment.\n\nh3. Cause\n\nAttaching an email in a client such as gmail will provide a filename for the attachment, for example:\n\n{noformat}\nContent-Type: message/rfc822; name=\"test.eml\"\nContent-Disposition: attachment; filename=\"test.eml\"\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: base64\n...\n{noformat}\n\nAttaching an email in Outlook provides no name or filename for the attachment:\n\n{noformat}\nContent-type: message/rfc822\nContent-disposition: attachment\n{noformat}\n\nAs a result JIRA doesn't know what to name this file.\n \nh3. Workaround \n* This has previously been suggested and implemented in JEMH as per [https://thepluginpeople.atlassian.net/browse/JEMH-1376], so seems like it's possible to do this.\n* Remove the *\"In-Reply-To:\"* header mail",

But this has come up several times where we've needed to determine where a user is used in a custom workflow and can't find an easy way to determine without clicking into each and every transition within each workflow the project was using.  We've started to maintain our own workflow diagrams with the extra details, but if it's something we can pull from JIRA that would be so much better as real time reporting is always better than relying on someone to manually keep a diagram up to date.",

Is there any way to have an email send that essentially cc's everyone in the one email. i.e.: One email is sent to all users so once the email is received, user A can see that user B, user C and user D also received the mail. User A can therefore include all users on a reply.\n\nit would be good to have this as an option when sending JIRAs.\n\nThanks\nLouise",

Now, in my organization (canope, france) we have a license for 500 users. I have to say you, the functions provide by jira to sort user are not very convenient when the number of users increase. At least, we need a simple function to sort user by activity (last connexion for example). it would be another criteria in user search function. \n\nI found the two solutions below but... the first is not convenient and the second (even if i understand the policy to promote plugin development) is not acceptable. Sort user by activity is a trivial function to manage all the accounts, specially when the panel of users increase. In my point of view this function is missing. \n\nhttps://answers.atlassian.com/questions/93421/jira-admin-sort-users-list-by-directory?utm_source=SAC&utm_medium=dashboard\n\nhttps://support.atlassian.com/customer/search?q=sort+user\n\n\nthat's all.

However, we have five issue types in one project and testers, legal reviewers or product managers are different users for each issue types... Would it be possible to have another level of roles at the issue type level? Inherent parent Project Role if not set?  \n\nAlso at the moment, Jira doesn't support default assignee on project roles. All users in a role are arranged alphabetically... Can we maybe allow an administrator to set the order of the list so the first in the list is the default assignee for the role? Or better yet, allow admin to set a default assignee for each Project roles (Issue Type role as well...)? ",

Currently for a JIRA project there can be one and only one lead.  Our projects are big enough whereby each component has a specific lead, and for things such as setting default assignee based upon component, would be very useful.  Also just having the lead be per component has many other benefits. ",
