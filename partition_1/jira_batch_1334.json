Example:\r\n\r\nIn this scenario a sprint was created on the DEVP board and is currently the active sprint on it and also on Board2.\r\n * If the selected value is \"Active Sprint (Board2)\", it will trigger the error message.\r\n * If the selected value is \"Active Sprint (DEVP board)\", it will not trigger the error message.\r\n !Example.png!\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Create board 1 and board 2.\r\n # Create an issue on each board.\r\n # Create a sprint on board 1.\r\n # Assign both issues created on step 2 to the sprint from step 3.\r\n # Start the sprint.\r\n # Now create an automation rule that has an action to \"Edit an issue\", and select the Sprint Field.\r\n # On the Sprint field select \"Active Sprint (board 2)\".\r\n # Run the rule and check the results.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n * The rule should add the issue onto the sprint.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n * The rule fails to add the issue to the sprint and throws an error.\r\n * If the Edit Issue action has another field that is successful, the rule fails to add the issue to the sprint, but doesn't thrown an error in the audit logs. This specific behavior is handled in [JIRAAUTOSERVER-315: When there are two fields being edited on the Edit Issue action, the audit log doesn't mention the errored field if the other field is successfully updated|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JIRAAUTOSERVER-315]\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nTo confirm which board the sprint was created on, you can use the SQL query below:\r\n\r\n(i) When running this query, be sure to swap 'your Active Sprint name here' with actual active Sprint name (this query is case sensitive).\r\n{code:sql}\r\nSELECT s.\"NAME\" AS Sprint_Name, r.\"NAME\" AS Original_Board_Name\r\nFROM \"AO_60DB71_SPRINT\" s \r\nJOIN \"AO_60DB71_RAPIDVIEW\" r ON s.\"RAPID_VIEW_ID\" = r.\"ID\"\r\nWHERE s.\"NAME\" = 'your Active Sprint name here';\r\n{code}\r\nWith the information from the above query, adjust your rule to use *select the active sprint for the board in which it was created on* (eg. \"Active Sprint (Board_where_the_sprint_was_created)\", which in the above example would be 'DEVP board').",

      "description": "h3. Issue Summary\r\n\r\nThis issue appears to be isolated to PostgreSQL databases due to how they determine which merge strategies to use on table joins.\r\n\r\nA4J {{7.3}} changed the data type for {{AUDIT_ITEM_ID}} and {{ID}} in the tables {{AO_589059_AUDIT_ITEM_CGE_ITEM}} and {{AO_589059_AUDIT_ITEM_COMP_CGE}} from {{INT}} to {{BIGINT}}.\r\n\r\nThis is causing some queries to use a {{hash join}} strategy instead of a {{merge join}}.\r\n\r\nIf the hash tables of the tables are too large to be loaded into memory, eg they are larger than 4MB but {{work_mem}} is set to the default of 4MB, Postgres begins writing them out to temporary disk files.\r\n\r\nThis causes DB Write IOPS to spike, and causes other DB queries to back up and return more slowly.\r\n\r\nThis will cause Automation Rules to be actioned more slowly.\r\n\r\nWith heavy load, it can also cause DB Connection Pool exhaustion, which in turn will cause HTTP Thread exhaustion, which will result in an outage.\r\n\r\nThis is a good read on join strategies for more information: [https://www.cybertec-postgresql.com/en/join-strategies-and-performance-in-postgresql/]\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Have a large number of entries in the tables listed [here|https://confluence.atlassian.com/automation/upgrading-to-automation-for-jira-7-3-1055951956.html]\r\n # Upgrade A4J to {{7.3.x}}\r\n # Run this query and observe which merge strategy is in use:\r\n{code:java}\r\nexplain analyse select\r\n    \"AO_589059_AUDIT_ITEM_COMP_CGE\".\"AUDIT_ITEM_ID\",\r\n    \"AO_589059_AUDIT_ITEM_COMP_CGE\".\"COMPONENT_NAME_KEY\",\r\n    \"AO_589059_AUDIT_ITEM_COMP_CGE\".\"COMPONENT\",\r\n    \"AO_589059_AUDIT_ITEM_COMP_CGE\".\"COMPONENT_ID\",\r\n    \"AO_589059_AUDIT_ITEM_COMP_CGE\".\"DURATION\",\r\n    \"AO_589059_AUDIT_ITEM_COMP_CGE\".\"ID\",\r\n    \"AO_589059_AUDIT_ITEM_COMP_CGE\".\"OPTIMISED_IDS\",\r\n    \"AO_589059_AUDIT_ITEM_COMP_CGE\".\"START_TIME\",\r\n    \"AO_589059_AUDIT_ITEM_CGE_ITEM\".\"AUDIT_ITEM_COMPONENT_CHANGE_ID\",\r\n    \"AO_589059_AUDIT_ITEM_CGE_ITEM\".\"AUDIT_ITEM_ID\",\r\n    \"AO_589059_AUDIT_ITEM_CGE_ITEM\".\"CHANGE_FROM\",\r\n    \"AO_589059_AUDIT_ITEM_CGE_ITEM\".\"CHANGE_TO\",\r\n    \"AO_589059_AUDIT_ITEM_CGE_ITEM\".\"FIELD_NAME\",\r\n    \"AO_589059_AUDIT_ITEM_CGE_ITEM\".\"ID\",\r\n    \"AO_589059_AUDIT_ITEM_CGE_ITEM\".\"MESSAGE\"\r\nfrom \"public\".\"AO_589059_AUDIT_ITEM_COMP_CGE\" \"AO_589059_AUDIT_ITEM_COMP_CGE\"\r\nleft join \"public\".\"AO_589059_AUDIT_ITEM_CGE_ITEM\" \"AO_589059_AUDIT_ITEM_CGE_ITEM\"\r\non \"AO_589059_AUDIT_ITEM_COMP_CGE\".\"ID\" = \"AO_589059_AUDIT_ITEM_CGE_ITEM\".\"AUDIT_ITEM_COMPONENT_CHANGE_ID\"\r\nwhere \"AO_589059_AUDIT_ITEM_COMP_CGE\".\"AUDIT_ITEM_ID\" = 10;{code}\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n * A4J is as performant as prior to the upgrade\r\n * Running the query above shows a {{merge join}} strategy is in use\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n * A4J is extremely non performant and causes Jira instability\r\n * DB Write IOPS is very high\r\n * Running the query above shows a {{hash join}} strategy is in use\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\n(!) NB: Currently, downgrading to A4J {{7.2.x}} is NOT guaranteed to resolve the performance issue\r\n  h4. *RECOMMENDED FIX*\r\n # Run {{ANALYZE VERBOSE}} on the tables to collect statistics about the tables, so the query planner can use these statistics to determine the most efficient execution plans for the queries.\r\n ## Run the query above and confirm that the join strategy is {{hash join}}\r\n ## Run {{ANALYZE VERBOSE \"AO_589059_AUDIT_ITEM_COMP_CGE\";}}\r\n ## Run {{ANALYZE VERBOSE \"AO_589059_AUDIT_ITEM_CGE_ITEM\";}}\r\n ## Run the query above and confirm that the join strategy is now: {{merge left join}}\r\n ## Confirm DB Write IOPS has dropped and performance is restored\r\n\r\n h4. Other workarounds\r\n # Increase {{work_mem}} until you see Write IOPS drop and performance improve: {{SET work_mem = '16MB';}}\r\n ## This may need to be increased further and monitored\r\n ## Be careful not to increase this beyond the capacity of the memory on your database server. Bear in mind that multiple queries will run concurrently, so there may be multiple queries using memory at once, and each query can have multiple operations which consume 16mb of memory each, so the memory in use can grow exponentially.\r\n # Alternatively, follow the instructions in [the 7.3 release notes|https://confluence.atlassian.com/automation/upgrading-to-automation-for-jira-7-3-1055951956.html] to truncate the data from your AUDITLOG tables\r\n ## Ideally this would be done\u00a0 **prior** to the upgrade to 7.3 to avoid any performance problems, but\u00a0this can be done post upgrade to immediately resolve performance issues. This can be done while the system is running, and you should see immediate recovery.\r\n ## This *will* result in the loss of all the audit log data\r\n ## Over time the audit log will fill back up and you may see a resurgence of this problem\r\n ## Consider [expiring audit log items|https://confluence.atlassian.com/automation/expire-audit-log-items-993924681.html] more frequently, so the tables are smaller",

Issue\r\n\r\nAutomation rules using the *Incoming Webhook* trigger fail to run if the JSON payload provided by the webhook contains the *data* tag with just a string in it:\r\n{code}\r\n{\r\n  \"data\": \"Julien\"\r\n}\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nh3. Notes\r\n\r\nNote that the Payload received by the Automation rule is properly parsed if the *data* tag contains a map of data. In such case, the rule is properly triggered:\r\n{code}\r\n{\r\n    \"data\": {\r\n        \"name\": \"Julien\"\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nAnother note is that the same issue will happen if the payload contains the tag *issues*, as it is also a tag which is processed in a special way by Automation for Jira.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to replicate:\r\n\r\n# Configure an automation rule using:\r\n-- the *When: Incoming webhook* trigger\r\n-- the log action used to record the payload coming from the webhook, via the smart value webhookData\r\n !Step1.png|thumbnail! \r\n# Take note of the *Webhook URL* from that rule\r\n# Open an app that can be used to send a POST request to the A4J rule webhook URL. For example, I'm using Postman\r\n# Send a POST request to the webhook URL using:\r\n#- The webhook URL in the URL field\r\n#- the POST method\r\n#- the \"content-type\" header set to \"application/json\"\r\n#- the following payload:\r\n{code}\r\n{\r\n  \"data\": \"Julien\"\r\n}\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nh3. Expected results\r\n\r\n- A4J should come back to the client that sent the webhook with the 200 HTTP code:\r\n !Step3.png|thumbnail! \r\n- The incoming webhook should be processed by the rule and the execution show be with the \"SUCCESS\" status in the audit log:\r\n !Step4.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\nh3. Actual results\r\n\r\nA4J returns a 400 HTTP error with the following message:\r\n{code}\r\n{\r\n    \"warningMessages\": [],\r\n    \"errorMessages\": [\r\n        \"Can not instantiate value of type [map type; class java.util.LinkedHashMap, [simple type, class java.lang.String] -> [simple type, class java.lang.Object]] from JSON String; no single-String constructor/factory method (through reference chain: com.codebarrel.automation.api.webhook.IncomingWebhook[\\\"data\\\"])\"\r\n    ],\r\n    \"errors\": {},\r\n    \"status\": 400\r\n}\r\n{code}\r\n !Step2.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nThere is unfortunately no easy workaround. This bug comes from the fact that, by design, the Automation source code expects the *data* tag to come with the format below, and fails if *data* only comes as a string:\r\n{code}\r\ndata: {\r\nkey: value,\r\nkey2: value,\r\n...\r\n}\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nThe only way to work around this bug is to modify the format of the webhook payload which is sent to the Automation rule. This might or might not be possible, if this webhook is sent by using a 3rd party application.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Issue Summary\r\nAfter upgrading A4J to 7.3.x some customers are finding some null entries on rule actor and it seems like there are some errors about \u201cNo automation items were claimed from the queue for processing on this node since most automation rules depend on JQL indexes being available.\u201d.  \r\n\r\nAnalysing further we've noticed that there were more than 60k results on the AO_589059_AUTOMATION_QUEUE table on JIRA startup.

Issue Summary\r\nThe \"If issue type\" conditions (and probably others, but this is the one I use most) end up with the wrong issue types when moving between environments whose IDs don't match. This is going to be common when creating new issue types in a test environment before going live in Production, and the identification should be more robust, checking that the name of the issue type (or other field) matches what was exported upon import, and finding a match if the ID and name don't both match, perhaps even asking for what that ID/name should map to in the new environment. Customer had to update every rule individually to correct this after my last import.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Refresh Dev environment from Prod so they match 100%\r\n2. Create two new issue types\r\n3. Create an automation rule with a condition that requires one of those two new issue types in Dev\r\n4. Export the rule from Dev\r\n5. Create the two new issue types in Prod, possibly in a different order (because of using Project Configurator to move the issue types between environments)\r\n6. Import the rule from the file\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nNo matter what order the issue types are created in, the rule is correct, or alerts the user running the import that the issue types in the target environment (Prod) don't match what was exported from Dev\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nThe rule may silently refer to the WRONG issue type without any indication of what happened unless you're looking for it.\r\n\r\nh3.

Issue Summary\r\n\r\nNormally, any automation rule should always check the permissions from the *Rule actor* (defined in the rule configuration) to execute any action.\r\n\r\nHowever, this is not the case when an action is trying to fetch linked issues. In this specific scenario, the permissions of the person who initiated the automation rule (=initiator) are used instead of the rule actor permissions.\r\n\r\nThis issue might result in actions which are not executed correctly.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to replicate\r\n\r\n- Create 2 projects. For example:\r\n-- Project SCRUMSAMPL\r\n-- Project TESTSD\r\n- Create 2 users with the following permissions:\r\n-- User 1 has *browse projects* permission in both projects\r\n-- User 2 has *browse projects* permission only in project SCRUMSAMPL, but not in TESTSD\r\n- Create an issue in each project\r\n- Link both issues together\r\n !Bug_Step2.png|thumbnail! \r\n- Create an automation rule that automatically creates a new ticket, and that copies the linked issues from the trigger issue into the newly created issue. Make sure to set the rule actor as *User 1* (the user who has *browse projects* permission in both projects)\r\n !Bug_Step1.png|thumbnail! \r\n- Trigger the automation by making an update to the ticket from the project SCRUMPSAMPL, and by using the User 2 as the \"initiator\"\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nThe newly created ticket include the linked issue (which is an issue from the project TESTSD) from the trigger issue into the newly created issue, since:\r\n- the rule actor permissions should be checked\r\n- the rule actor is set to User 1 who has permission to view issues from TESTSD\r\n\r\n !Bug_Step3.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nThe newly created ticket does not contain a link to the ticket from the TESTSD project.\r\nThat's because the rule initiator (User 2) does not have permission to view this ticket\r\n\r\n !Bug_Step4.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\nLooking into the audit logs, we can also see that if the rule is initiated by the user 2, the linked issue is not seen and therefore not copied:\r\n\r\n !Bug_Step5.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nEnsure that the initiator of the rule has browse project permissions in all the projects\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Issue Summary\r\nAutomation for Jira does not detect more than 50 values for any fields in Jira. \r\nFor example: When we have 50+ versions (Projects > Releases), *Fix Version/s* field in the *Issue fields condition* does not show all the options in the \u201cvalue\u201d dropdown. The dropdown shows 51 versions.\r\n\r\nAs per the design, A4J requests Jira REST API to get project versions with default settings. And these 50 records are the maximum number that Jira returns by default. \r\n\r\nDue to this, if any fields in Jira have more than 50 values, A4J will display only the first 50 values of them. There are options for pagination and result size, but A4J doesn't use them. \r\n\r\nThis is a limitation when customers have fields with 100+ values. For example, in a big sized project, there could be 100+ Versions and A4J will fetch only 50 versions. This would cause an impact as other versions could not be used for automation purposes.\r\n\r\nDropdown does not list the 'matching' options as per the input. We need to scroll to select the required version irrespective of the input entered.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Create a JSW project. Go to Projects > Releases.

Issue Summary\r\nWhen trigger of A4J rule is executed twice or more within seconds, a 'race condition' is created in \"automation queue\" causing abnormal behaviour in the validation part of the rule for the second execution. \r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n *  Create a simple A4J rule and workflow where issue is transitioned to \"Waiting for Customer\" when agent comments and \"Customer Updated\" when comment is made by the customer.\r\n ** Create a new issue and transition it to 'Waiting for Customer'. From the customer portal, add 2 comments within seconds. This should transition the issue to \"Customer Updated\".\r\n ** For Comment 1, In the audit logs, we could see the rule was successful and issue was transitioned to \"Customer Updated\".\r\n ** For Comment 2, in the audit logs, we could see the rule failed with *No transitions to specified status could be found for issues (with current status)* error.\r\n !Screenshot 2021-02-26 at 12.11.51 PM (1).png|thumbnail!\r\n ** If we notice the *History* tab for the issue, where the rule was executed, we see for Comment 1 at 12:02 PM, which is 26/02/21 12:02:08 pm in A4J audit log, the rule is 'successful'.\r\n ** However, for Comment 2 at 12:02 PM, which is 26/02/21 12:02:12 pm in A4J audit log, the rule failed with 'Some Errors'.\r\n !Screenshot 2021-02-26 at 12.14.03 PM (1).png|thumbnail! \r\n * This could have happened - The customer makes 2 comments and triggers the A4J rule twice within seconds.\r\n ** *Iteration 1* -\r\n ### Comment 1 matched all 'if' conditions successfully\r\n ### Comment 1 transitioned the issue to 'Customer Updated'.\r\n ** *Iteration 2* - At the same instant, Comment 2 is also triggered, this has reached the 'if' condition even before or while \"Step 2\" of *Iteration 1* is underway. Due to this, the \"If\" condition is passed successfully. Next, when the rule moves to the 'Transition' part, it fails as the issue is not in *With Customer* status anymore.\r\n * This could be the reason why we see the rule failing with \"Some errors\" in audit logs. This would happen only when the customer adds one or more comments within seconds when the execution of the rule is still underway for the first comment.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n'If' condition should 'fail' when A4J rule is triggered in second customer comment as the first comment would have transitioned issue to 'Customer Updated'.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n'If' condition is successful and A4J execution moves to 'Transition' part where rule fails and throws error message in audit logs.\r\n\r\nAs A4J rule execution and Jira events are asynchronous we are getting into these 'race conditions' where rule is failing under certain scenarios. It would be great if A4J rule execution and related Jira events are made synchronous.\r\n",

      "description": "h3. Issue Summary\r\n* We have an A4J rule with a \"Work Logged\" trigger (All working operations) which is project-specific. Rule works fine when work is logged.\r\n* If we delete any of the issue containing 'logged work' (previously entered multiple work logs), then 2 events would be triggered through Jira - \r\n** Jira starts deleting the issue along with logged work (Work log) in it.\r\n** As part of issue deletion, when the work logged is deleted, it triggers the A4J rule as the rule is configured as *\"Work Logged\" trigger (All working operations)*. \r\n(i) This Jira deletion and A4J execution process are asynchronous (independent of each other). \r\n** The A4J rule during its execution will look for *projectID* and other details of the issue to enter them into the 'audit logs' of the rule. By then, if Jira has already deleted the issue (as both processes are independent), A4J will not get the projectID and would assume the rule to be 'Global' and would make the audit log 'global'. As the audit log becomes global, it would not be visible from project settings.\r\n** Another side effect is that if any notifications are configured, the user would get the failure notifications for this rule. As the rule is project-specific, and the audit log for the failure is made 'global'; the non-Jira admin user would not be able to view the audit logs. \r\n** If there are multiple entries under 'Work log' for the deleted issue, the A4J rule would be triggered multiple times thereby sending multiple 'failure' notifications for the user.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Create an A4J rule with \"Work Logged\" trigger (All working operations).\r\n # Enter multiple 'work log' hours.\r\n # Delete the issue.\r\nThe occurrence is random. At times the rule is 'SUCCESS' with expected results. Sometimes it fails with 'SOME ERRORS'. When rule fails with 'SOME ERRORS', it stays project-specific or sometimes becomes 'Global'.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nThe rule should not be triggered when the issue is deleted. Even if the rule is triggered, it should not trigger multiple tiles and audit logs should be visible from Project Settings. Audit logs should not be 'Global'.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nResults vary with every execution - \r\n* Rule is 'SUCCESS' with audit log showing an error message. The audit log for the execution is visible when accessed through Project Settings.\r\n* Rule fails with 'SOME ERRORS' with audit log showing an error message. The audit log for the execution is visible when accessed through Project Settings.\r\n* Rule fails with 'SOME ERRORS' with audit log showing an error message. The audit log for the execution is *not visible* when accessed through Project Settings. The audit log is marked 'Global' and is only visible when accessed Globally.\r\n* Rule is triggered multiple times (for every deleted 'Work log' entry of a single issue).\r\n{panel}\r\nh4. Trial 1\r\nHere the deleted issue, '12103' (ATJ-12103) had 2 entries for work log. Hence when the issue was deleted, A4J rule was triggered twice. both the times, the rule execution marked the audit log as project-specific.\r\n   !Screenshot 2021-02-12 at 12.29.30 PM.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\nh4. Trial 2\r\nHere the deleted issue, '12104' (ATJ-12104) had 3 entries for work log. Hence when the issue was deleted, A4J rule was triggered thrice. 2 of the rule execution marked the audit log as project-specific and 3rd one made the audit log as 'Global'.\r\n!Screenshot 2021-02-12 at 12.30.08 PM.png|thumbnail!{panel}\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n* Change the \"*Work Logged*\" trigger in A4J from \"*All working operations*\" to just \"*Created*\" and \"*Updated*\". This would trigger the A4J rule when available the work log is either added or edited. Be Deleting the issue would not trigger the A4J rule.\r\n* If changing the \"*Work Logged*\" trigger in A4J from \"*All working operations*\" is not an option, then be cautious while deleting the issue as deleting the issue could trigger this behavior.",
