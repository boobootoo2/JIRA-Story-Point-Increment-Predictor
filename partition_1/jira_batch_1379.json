      "description": "*PROBLEM*\r\nA user reports that modifying \"Time Spent\" on a Crucible review with Time Tracking submission from reviews set to ON causes a timeout and error message using 2.7.12 where this was not the case in 2.7.11.\r\n\r\nModifying the \"Time Spent\" on a review ordinarily takes two Ajax calls:\r\nreviewUpdatedAjax\t\r\nupdateTimeTrackingAjax\t\r\n\r\nToggling on \"Allow Time Tracking submission from review\" under Options from {{Administration >> Global Settings >> Application Links >> JIRA Settings}} causes a large number of calls to updateJiraTimeAjax!default.\r\n\r\n\r\n*ACTIONS / NOTES*\r\n\r\nI duplicated this locally on my machine (Version:2.7.12 Build:20120322030402 2012-03-22) and found 118 calls. I duplicated the large number of calls but not the timeout nor error message. I don't think I'm seeing either of these symptoms because both of my servers are on the same box (but this is just my guess). Results extracted from debug logs are below for 2.7.12. I tried to find logs for 2.7.11 but couldn't figure out why the calls weren't being logged and thus had to manually count them (20 calls to *updateJiraTimeAjax*) via the developer tools Chrome add on (similar to the user's screenshots).\r\n\r\nMy browser:\r\nChrome 19.0.1084.46 m\r\n\r\nUser's browser:\r\nTBD \r\n\r\n\r\n2.7.12 logs:\r\n{noformat}\r\nLine 5276: 2012-05-22 11:23:01,523 DEBUG [btpool0-14 ] fisheye.perf ProfilingServletFilter-logRequest -
