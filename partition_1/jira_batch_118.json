      "description": "In my normal working environment I review multi-file changes selecting files or hunks to stage.\r\n\r\nBut this is nearly impossible with SourceTree, because the diff view keeps refreshing and every time it refreshes the file and line position and scroll position. For me, this is happening every 5 or so seconds. As you can imagine, many a swear word gets uttered during this process.\r\n\r\nIn my search for an answer, I've seen various bug reports for SourceTree that seem to get shuffled about and closed or not necessarily addressed. Ultimately there are three contributing factors:\r\n # Something is changing files\r\n # SourceTree refreshes when ANY file change occurs, even ignored files\r\n # SourceTree looses position information when a refresh occurs\r\n\r\nNow although item\u00a01 is not SourceTree's fault the consequences given 2 and 3 are really bad. With the greatest respect, there have been so many people who hit these issues that I would strongly suggest 2 and 3 are addressed.\r\n\r\nFor item 1, I eventually found out what was the problem in my case. I develop apps using meteor ([http://meteor.com)|http://meteor.com%29/]\u00a0and in development mode it runs a mongodb database, which periodically writes diagnostic info (*.meteor/local/db/diagnostic.data/metrics.interim*\u00a0to be precise). The whole .meteor folder is in my .gitignore file.\r\n\r\nThe simple answer of course is that I shut the meteor down while reviewing changes, but that is simply not a realistic option as it would destroy my productivity. I also haven't found a way to disable the mongodb diagnostics.\r\n\r\nSourceTree has the ability to disable automatic refreshes, and although this might seem like a great option - as a user it isn't. You only have to miss some changes that shouldn't have been submitted ... etc. and you may end up looking for another job.\r\n\r\nOne more workable compromise option would be to have an automatic refresh that only kicks in when the SourceTree app gains focus. For most people this would catch manual code changes.\r\n\r\nAnother suggestion is to have refresh still detect changes, and display a 'Changes detected. Refresh now.' button\u00a0in the header/toolbar. \u00a0So that the user is alerted, but not necessarily interrupted.\r\n\r\nThe best option of course is that file detection skips ignored files/directories (fix issue 2). It clearly\u00a0should. I've seen a comment in one of the issues suggesting that it might be inefficient, but the consequences are too impactful not to, and the actual refresh has to do that check anyway (albeit inside git).\r\n\r\nMaybe the git refresh (git status command at least) can be executed before fully committing to the UI refresh. If the existing view doesn't currently have that file, and the git status doesn't list it - ignore the file change. Even better, use the *git check-ignore*\u00a0command which seems perfect for this scenario.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, do the refresh in the background, and if the result is identical to the UI's existing state - return without changing anything.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0",

This is the reason that your current release is unusable.\r\n\r\nLet's talk about the last one. I'm sure you have designers who are better artists than me and I did the attached icons in <5 minutes. They are still modern, they in the exact same style you're using, but they actually look different from one another. And they're my free gift to you. If was up to me, I'd also provide a larger option too, but at least make the icons you have look different from each other.\r\n\r\nI'm one of the people who paid for SourceTree for my whole company before it was free. I like it, but you've done a number of things to make it worse after the Atlassian acquisition. You've fixed some of the other mistakes. Can you please fix the icons?",

Only if the local develop branch had been previously been updated will it say \"Merge branch 'develop' into...\" This is somewhat of an inconvenience, because the hash there is nigh on useless (the hash is right there in the metadata if you need it, the log message is supposed to be more meaningful to humans).\r\n\r\nThe workaround I've been using is first checking out develop, pulling, and then going back to the feature branch to do the merge. Another workaround I came accross (in\u00a0-SRCTREEWIN-492-) is to find the remote branch in the left pane and select \"Pull\u00a0 [remote branch] into [current local branch]\". This produces a somewhat more useful log message, although its a little verbose for my taste, expanding the remote into\u00a0the actual location (I.e. merged 'develop' from [http://github.com/[...]]\u00a0into [current local branch]). The workflow isn't as nice as selecting \"Merge\" and picking \u00a0the merge point from the history, though, so you can be sure the branch you're merging is at the point you thought it was.",

Right click file in pending or posted changeset and select External Diff from menu\r\n 2. FileMerge is launched (default merge tool, hasn't been changed - no others installed to test with)\r\n 3. Within about 10 to 15 seconds but no sooner than 5, SourceTree will become unresponsive, showing the pinwheel icon.\r\n 4. SourceTree will remain unresponsive until immediately after FileMerge is fully exited. Closing the individual diff view has no effect.\u00a0Opening and/or closing multiple diffs has no effect.
