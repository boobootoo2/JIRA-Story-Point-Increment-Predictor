If not then you need to specifiy the password for the private key *6)\n1) Create CSR and private key on your linux box:\nopenssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout private.key -out request.csr -subj \"/C=na/ST=None/L=None/O=None/CN=None\"\n2) Create certificate with the generated CSR for your domain. (in StartSSL go to \"Certificates Wizard\", paste the generated CSR for your domain and submit. Download and extract the certificate and CA Chain.)\n3) Create PFX file from certificate (step 2), private key (step 1) and Certificate Chain (step 2 - root bundle or intermediate cert depending on CA):\nopenssl pkcs12 -export -out <PFX-filename>.pfx -inkey private.key -in <your-certificate>.crt -certfile <CA-chain-file>.crt\n(you can use the same password for the PFX file as for the private key to make things easier - we won't need the PFX file later and can destroy it)\nThe output should read like this:\n>Enter pass phrase for private.key:\n>Enter Export Password:\n>Verifying - Enter Export Password:\n4) Convert the PFX into a Java keystore. In your JRE bin directory on your linux box execute:\n./keytool -importkeystore -srckeystore <PFX-filename>.pfx -destkeystore <new-keystore-file>.keystore -srcstoretype PKCS12 -deststoretype JKS\nIMPORTANT: Use the SAME PASSWORD for the keystore as for the private key from step 1)! otherwise see *6)\nThe output should read like this:\n>Enter destination keystore password:\n>Re-enter new password:\n>Enter source keystore password:\n>Entry for alias 1 successfully imported.\n>Import command completed:  1 entries successfully imported, 0 entries failed or cancelled\n5)Edit your server.xml, uncomment the <Connector port=\"8443> and point the keystore entry to your <new-keystore>.keystore and supply the keystore password from step 1. (keystoreFile=\"<new-keystore>.keystore\" keystorePass=\"<password from step 1>\")\n*6) If you want to set different passwords for the private key and the keystore then you have to:\n./keytool -keypasswd -keystore /path/to/keyestore.file -alias <alias-in-keystore>\nIf you're not sure about the alias: ./keytool -list -keystore <name-of-keystore>\n*7) Alternative to creating a PFX file including the CA chain file:\n./keytool -importcert -alias startssl-CA-chain -keystore <path-to-atlassian-directory>/jre/lib/security/cacerts -file <CA Chain Cert in PEM format>.crt\n{quote} ",

Maybe implement an empty field as a customer with an empty string \"\"?\n\n(Of course, there may be a way to express my query in the easy mode query interface, without having to\u00a0learn a query language at all; if it can be done, then *I*\u2019m the giddy goat.)",

The text is in the page and so are the edit tools. Only ajax request should be on updating it.\n * Trying to change assignee on an issue would load the users list via Ajax request. Why not cache this in localstorage?\n\nThere are many more occasions where needless requests are made and the system thus responds much slower than needed. Perhaps it becomes more evident on the cloud _service_ which is obviously overloaded. I could now see that refresh a simple issue page would take 1.1-2.5 seconds to fetch the HTML part of the page (without resources).

Use cases:\n * As we are transferring hours to other tool automatically we would like to see mistake entries as zero values.\n * We are comparing worklog entries with summup pluging to budget. If negative entries could be entered we would see on dashboard how many hours are left on the budget bu calculating spent time + negative budget. The result would be negative which does not matter as the value would be correct.\n\nThanks and Regards,\n\nJussi",

Problem Definition\r\n\r\nUnlicensed users are not able to receive notifications for JIRA Software and JIRA Core. As other customers report, this used to work in the past. But while taking multiple tests into Cloud Instances (this was only tested with Cloud).\r\n\r\nTo test that you can:\r\n # Create a user without any application access\r\n # Create a notification scheme that includes this user (we tested by allowing browse projects permission and notification through a user custom field and also through watchers field)\r\n # Add user to that issue as a watcher or using a custom field\r\n # Make sure the user has browse permission access to that issue\r\n # Try to generate notification\r\n # No Notification is sent, neither information is thrown on outgoing mail log\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nAllow this type of user to receive notifications.\r\nh3. Why this is important\r\n\r\nThere are use cases when users need to receive only mail notifications and will not need to use JIRA internal functionalities, this is demanding this kind of users to consume a license only to receive e-mails.\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nSend the notification to a single email address, without creating the user with no application access. \r\nThis should work since -JRA-63395- has been fixed.

I get the feeling that the users are not taken seriously - not everyone that uses the tool or even those that administer the tool are developers. GUI is important in a software tool and basic functionality that can save admins and users time and effort should really be considered as important.

Make sure to add _?filter=-1_ at the end of the issue URL in order to be able to print all the activity in case it has multiple pages (e.g http://cloud_site_name.atlassian.net/browse/TEST-1?filter=-1)\r\n** Note: This workaround may be not be functional for most of the sites after the upgrade to the new Jira experience: \r\n",

However, there is no log that keep track of who login as the user, at what time, and what did he do with it.\n\nThis may cause some loophole in the security, in which the site admin would be able to log in as other user and make crucial changes without the person in contact knowing.\n\nh3.

For example, implementing a Business Epic \u2018A\u2019 requires the implementation of features \u2018X\u2019, \u2018Y\u2019 and \u2018Z\u2019. Implementation of feature \u2018X\u2019 requires work in JIRA project \u2018P1\u2019, \u2018P2\u2019 and \u2018P3\u2019, for feature \u2018Y\u2019 it requires work in project \u2018P2\u2019, \u2018P4\u2019, etcetera. So \u2018A\u2019 must be cloned to \u2018X\u2019, \u2018Y\u2019 and \u2018Z\u2019 and from there issues need to be cloned to \u2018P1\u2019, \u2018P2\u2019, etc. All hierarchy relationships require an \u2018implement\u2019 link between the parent and the child.\n\u201cClone & move\u201d is used to create the issues, but for each newly created issues the \u201cLink\u201d function must be used to create the parent-child relationship with the \u2018implement\u2019 link.\nSince it typically involves a large number of new issues, it is a lot of work switching between \u201cClone & Move\u201d and the \u201cLink\u201d function, and it is easy to make a mistake (e.g. linking the wrong issue ids, or omitting the \u2018implement\u2019 link). By including the linking in the clone function, JIRA knows exactly which issues are concerned (i.e. the original and the clone) reducing the amount of work and reducing the amount of mistakes, and the user is more likely (to not forget) to create the link.\n\n\nh3. *Why this is important*\n# The hierarchical structure has an immediate impact on the development planning, and therefore mistakes have too (e.g. missing \u2018implement\u2019 links). Similarly the mistakes have impact on the progress control of business epics.\n# The hierarchical structure will be used for aggregating time writing (from JIRA to Clarity) and time writing is used to account financial of projects (Clarity). Mistakes in the hierarchy will have impact on the financial accounting to projects.",

Import the data\n 1. Upload the files to the cloud by [using WebDAV |https://confluence.atlassian.com/cloud/upload-data-via-webdav-744721622.html]. (For backup files larger than 4GB, refer to [Uploading Large files to WebDAV |https://confluence.atlassian.com/cloudkb/uploading-large-files-to-webdav-747834468.html])\n{quote}\nThe first link: [using WebDAV |https://confluence.atlassian.com/cloud/upload-data-via-webdav-744721622.html] is a reciprocal link back to document 1 with no additional information\n\nThe Second Link [Uploading Large files to WebDAV |https://confluence.atlassian.com/cloudkb/uploading-large-files-to-webdav-747834468.html] Notes the Deprication of the webdav with:\n{quote}(!) Atlassian Cloud applications no longer support WebDAV. For updated import information, please refer to [Import and export data |https://confluence.atlassian.com/cloud/import-and-export-data-744721621.html].\n{quote}\nThe link provided [Import and export data |https://confluence.atlassian.com/cloud/import-and-export-data-744721621.html] is also a link back to the first document with no additional information on the new process for uploading data for a Import.\nh3. Suggested Solution\n\nThe new process needs to be detailed in the import documentation directly.\n\nSince of the Depreciation of the WebDav the new process has been added in the Cloud instance directly on the *Second Step* of the *JIRA Import Wizard* So the only way to notified of the new process is to initiate the process before reading the documentation pages as you must start the import to reveal these details:\n{quote}\nh2.Before you begin\n# Back up your JIRA Cloud site data using Backup Manager\n # Prepare an export of your other JIRA Cloud or Server instance.\n # If you want to include attachments, avatars, or logos in this import, create compressed copies of the following:\n * <JIRA_HOME>/data/attachments directory (with attachments as the top-level directory, or project keys within attachments as the top-level directory).\n * <JIRA_HOME>/data/avatars directory (with avatars as the top-level directory)\n * <JIRA_HOME>/logos directory (with logos as the top-level directory)\n{quote}\n!Screen Shot 2017-02-06 at 4.41.01 PM.png|thumbnail!\n\nBetween step 2 and 3 the JIRA Import File only file is uploaded from local file system to the webdav, and there is still no indication of were in the process attachments, avatars, or logos files are to be uploaded. Step 3 Notes:\n{quote}\nBefore the import is started, the JIRA export and optional archives must be uploaded to your Atlassian Cloud instance using WebDAV. For instructions on connecting to your WebDAV directory, [see this documentation | http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/Cloud/Uploading+Data+via+WebDAV]. The import data must be at the root-level of your WebDAV directory and not within a sub-folder.\n{quote}\n*Also Redirecting to the first document:* [Import and export data | https://confluence.atlassian.com/cloud/import-and-export-data-744721621.html] with no indication of how or when to do this.\n!Screen Shot 2017-02-06 at 4.48.33 PM.png|thumbnail!\n\nNext step Initiates the Restore\n\nOnce Restore is successful to upload the Attachments/Avatars/logos  you have to Do the process again but this time upload the zip of the attachments rather than the jira backup,  once complete repeat for each subsequent ZIP file so in total you will need to repeat the full migration process four time to transfer all data once for each:\n- jira-backup.zip\n- attachments.zip\n- avatars.zip\n- logos.zip\n\n\n",
