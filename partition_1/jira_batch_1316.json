If the issue is estimated and scheduled for multiple sprints then Auto-schedule provides\u00a0*load* value for each sprint to explicitly assign story points/hours per each sprint.\r\n\r\nThe above inconsistency may lead to sprints marked as overbooked.\r\n\r\n\r\nh4. Steps to reproduce\r\n - create a plan based on scrum project with sprints defined\r\n - keep the empty team with default 30 story points velocity\r\n - create two epics estimated both for 21 story points\r\n - Auto-schedule\r\n\r\nh4. Problem\r\n - The first sprint is marked as overbooked with 31sp assigned.\r\n - But according to Auto-schedule first sprint is not overbooked as it distributes 21sp from the second epic unevenly. 9sp goes to the first sprint. 12sp goes to the second sprint.\r\n\r\nh4. Workaround\r\nYou should ignore the preview mode of the auto-scheduler because it's inaccurate. \r\nInstead, you should accept the auto-scheduler changes and review them in team capacity graph. If you're unhappy, revert them. \r\n\r\n",

Since Portfolio only have one hierarchy that is configured by system administrators we have some teams that are finding it hard to align all of their issues to what we have defined for them. While the hierarchy would broadly, there are many use cases where it does not.\r\n\r\nUsers are also looking for more control over how they can filter the graphical display of the issues within a plan so they can use things like JQL to search for specific issues which meet specific criteria and then see them in the display in Portfolio. So instead of using the filters to limit the issues to a specific item in the hierarchy and then filter on a release, they want to be able to search within Portfolio with something like this: \u201cissuetype = Initiative And release = 2.13 AND linked issue in hasLinkedSR(1-12345) AND status != Resolved and group = TeamA\u201d.",

When there are team members, the algorithm will divide those story points over all the team members (including virtual users) equally. When one or more team members (including virtual users) are not available for (part of) the sprint, it will take that into account.\r\n\r\nFor example, let's say there are 30 story points in the `Team velocity` field. The `Forecasted Velocity` will, by default, be 30 story points. When there are 2 team members, the `Forecasted Velocity` will still be 30 story points: 15 story points for each team member. When 1 team member is only available for half of the sprint, the `Forecasted Velocity` will be 22.5 story points: 15 story points for the team member that is available for the whole sprint and 7.5 story points for the team member that is only available for half of the sprint.\r\n{quote}\r\n",

Environment\r\n* Jira 8 (tested in 8.0.0 and 8.0.1)\r\n* 2.25.0\r\n* [Timetracker|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1211243/timetracker-time-tracking-reporting?hosting=server&tab=overview] (installed first)\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Install Jira 8\r\n# Install [Timetracker|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1211243/timetracker-time-tracking-reporting?hosting=server&tab=overview]\r\n# Install Portfolio 2.25.0\r\n# Click *Portfolio > View Portfolio*\r\n \r\nh3. Notes\r\nThis appears to be caused by the fact that [Timetracker|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1211243/timetracker-time-tracking-reporting?hosting=server&tab=overview] also installs *Querydsl Support for JIRA Plugin*. It looks like Portfolio sees this other (incompatible) version of Querydsl and does not install the * querydsl-4.0.7-provider-plugin-1.2.jar* that it normally installs and requires.\r\n\r\nWhen Portfolio is installed first, there appears to be no problem and both Querydsl versions live side-by-side without any issues.\r\n\r\nh3.Workaround\r\nAs of right now, the only working workaround that we found is to,\r\n# Shut down Jira\r\n# Remove the {{jira-querydsl-support-2.0.0.jar}} file from {{[JIRA_HOME|https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiraserver/jira-application-home-directory-938847746.html]/plugins/installed-plugins}} \r\n# Start Jira\r\n# Add {{querydsl-4.0.7-provider-plugin-1.2.jar}} to {{[JIRA_HOME|https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiraserver/jira-application-home-directory-938847746.html]/plugins/installed-plugins}} if it's missing (attaching to this ticket)\r\n# Jira Portfolio should now work as expected\r\n",

We were evaluating the feature and where lucky to find something that helps to schedule based on available ressources and there skills. Now even with out Kanban Optimization the tool is currently useless for us due to a strict working with the Waterfall method. Minimum we need Kanban Optimization as fast as possible.\r\n\r\nBackground:\r\nWe have 2 Stories. The tasks per Storie are i.e. Design, Code, Test. Design and Test ist User A and Code is User B. We want a automatic planning that allows for User 1: Design 1 -> Design 2 --> Test (after Code)...\u00a0\u00a0and User 2 after Design 1: Code 1 -> Code 2.\r\n\r\nThe classic experience allowed this perfectly.\r\n\r\nThank you and best regards\r\nAlexander|",

When only a subset of releases has been chosen, there should be an option that prevents Portfolio from automatically importing any new releases that may have been added to the source Jira project(s).\r\n\r\nThe current behaviour, where new releases are automatically imported to the plan, means that in some configurations the plan owners regularly need to go through the list of releases in Portfolio and exclude them from the plan. In these scenarios (large plans with plenty of issue sources and multiple plans including the same source Jira project(s)), this needs to be done several times a week. I can definitely see how the current behaviour is useful in several scenarios but sometimes it is not desirable to have new releases pop up in the plan automatically.",
