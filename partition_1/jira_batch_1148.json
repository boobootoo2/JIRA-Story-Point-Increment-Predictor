[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-63462].\n  {panel}\n\nHi,\n\nI managed to get JIRA running via Apache's virtual host (using the proxy module). This makes that the web address doesn't contain the port number, and I can use SSL.\n\nIt all works fine, except for the message that I receive when logging out (see screenshot). Is there maybe another way to configure JIRA the way I want it?\n\nAnother question is: how can I force a redirect from the URL with the port number to my new URL? I cannot make Apache listen on that port.\n\nRegards,\n\nEdwin",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-63427].\n  {panel}\n\nThe attached screenshot shows the \"Create\" transition of any issue in JIRA workflows. Unfortunately there are two ways to reach that same transition from the JIRA UI:\n1. An issue is being created using the \"Create\" button\n2. An issue is being created using the More->Clone menu item of another issue\n\nIn my workflow, these two cases require significantly different handling. Specifically, my users like to use (2) instead of (1)\n\nAnd in fact often they even prefer to clone an issue in the wrong project then move it to the right project instead of just using the \"Create\" button in the right project.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThis known behavior was ok before one of our web hook integrations was built for two way sync of bugs, but it became catastrophic afterward. The classic error was to clone an issue to create a completely unrelated issue in a project that is not even tracked by this process. The result was a bunch of dangling bugs\u00a0in the other application created \"by mistake\" because someone decided to \"clone+move\" instead of \"create\".\n\nSo I need two separate transitions, one for create\u00a0and a different one for clone, in order to track the different set of actions that I need to take in one case or the other. Right now that can be done with undocumented code in Scriptrunner (so undocumented that I've never even got a straight answer from Jamie Echlin: [https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/9863448/answers/38752668] ). Here's the code I'm using:\n\nif(issue.key == null)\n\n\\{ // If the issue is not a clone, we honor whatever issuetype that // was set at issue creation screen return }\n\nelse\n\n\\{ // The issue is a clone. A few fields need to be purged here, because // purging them in normal post-functions would clear them even if they // had been explicitly set during the create screen of a new bug. \u00a0}\n\nWhile this looks pretty simple, being completely undocumented means that every time the support\u00a0team upgrades JIRA or the scriptrunner plugin, this might break.\n\nThe other, more annoying side effect is that once this logic is in play, any custom field that needs to be managed during this transition will need to be inside this same script, and I lose all the advantages of the JIRA UI managing post functions.\n\nSpecifically, in my bug workflow, when an issue is being cloned (but not when an issue is being created anew) I need to:\n - Change the issuetype to \"Bug\" for clones to avoid unnecessary triggers\n - Purge\u00a04 custom fields\n\nThese custom fields\u00a0cannot be purged on a \"Create new\" (as opposed to \"Create clone\") because they are present in the editor when an issue is created, and the user could decide to explicitly set them to something at creation time (same deal of the Issuetype \"bug (public)\").\n\n\u00a0",

Steps to reproduce:\n # Add labels for multiple issues. For example, Issue A was labelled *TESTA*, *TESTB*, *TESTC*, *TESTD*, *TESTE* and Issue B was labelled *TESTA*, *TESTB*, *TESTC*.\n # Go to issue navigator and save the filter with *labels in (TESTA, TESTB, TESTC)*\n # Go to dashboard and create Pie Chart with the saved filter.\n # Pie Chart will display labels *TESTA*, *TESTB*, *TESTC*, *TESTD*, *TESTE*.\n !Capture 2016-12-03 at 10.46.45.png|thumbnail!\n # This happens because Issue A is labelled *TESTD*, *TESTE*.\n\nh5. Environment\n\nJIRA 6.4.14, JIRA 7.2.5\nh5. Expected Results\n\nJIRA only display labels specified in the gadget's configuration\nh5. Notes\n\nLimiting the presented data to a custom-specified subset bares a high risk of data mis-interpretation.

However when a user clicks on any of the values within the chart, the column display defaults to the user's default display instead of utilizing the parent filter's saved column display.  On a number of cases this means that the data they need to see is not automatically available to them, they need to re-configure their columns each time.\n\nSince we help to manage several projects within the same JIRA instance, utilizing the parent filter's column display would provide a significant business value.",

For those it's 'Fix Version', 'Version', 'Link'\n* For custom fields, you get the field name not the field id (so 'My text field' instead of 'customfield_11212')\n\nSo we can kinda do a lookup from field Id -> field name and try both to see if there's something in the changelog, but Fix Version seems completely hard coded.  /rest/api/2/field returns id of 'fixVersions' and name of 'Fix Version/s'.  The changelog contains neither so we have to hard-code this lookup!\n\nHer's an example with Fix Version:\n{noformat}\n\"changelog\": {\n    \"id\": \"17415\",\n    \"items\": [\n      {\n        \"field\": \"Fix Version\",\n        \"fieldtype\": \"jira\",\n        \"from\": null,\n        \"fromString\": null,\n        \"to\": \"10001\",\n        \"toString\": \"2\"\n      }\n]}\n{noformat}\n\nWould be awesome if the changelog items could contain a 'fieldId' entry that's *always*  the fieldId!  Sure they can disappear for custom_fields, but we can just fall back to 'field' in that case.",

Problem Definition\nIt would be helpful with JQL to be able to search for issues by comparing user fields to other user fields (e.g. where Assignee == Reporter   or where Reporter == Requested Participants (on service desk))\n\n\nh3. Suggested Solution\nCurrently this is not possible to do with JQL, as you cannot compare user fields against other user fields.   All user field can be compared with is a text value.  As for functions, only {{CurrentUser()}} and {{memberOf()}} functions can be used for this, neither of which can make these kinds of comparisons.\n\n\nh3. Why this is important\nThis can be very useful from a JIRA admin point of view in order to be able to find issues that meet certain user criteria.  For example, when the assignee is also the reporter, or when one of the user fields matches a user in a custom user field.   This kind of comparison should be relatively easy to implement within JQL and in turn could extend the functionality significantly.\n\n \nh3. Workaround \nThis is something that can be done with [Scriptrunner|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.onresolve.jira.groovy.groovyrunner/server/overview].  Only then can you gain access to other JQL functions such as {code:borderStyle=solid}\nissuefunction in expression(\"project = FOO\", \"assignee != reporter\") \n{code}\n\n\nExamples of users on [Atlassian Answers|https://answers.atlassian.com/] looking for this functionality:\n* [Help with JQL assignee != reporter - Atlassian Answers|https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/4981880/help-with-jql-assignee-reporter]\n* [JQL Scripted Function to check if assignee = reporter? - Atlassian Answers|https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/200713/jql-scripted-function-to-check-if-assignee-reporter]\n* [Is it possible to search for issues where assignee=reporter? - Atlassian Answers|https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/318999/is-it-possible-to-search-for-issues-where-assignee-reporter]\n* [Assignee not same as reporter - Atlassian Answers|https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/250557/assignee-not-same-as-reporter]\n* [JQL Query for searching issues that are assigned to the reporter - Atlassian Answers|https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/91037/jql-query-for-searching-issues-that-are-assigned-to-the-reporter]\n* [JQL: query issues where assignee != project lead; or where assignee != reporter - Atlassian Answers|https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/64387/jql-query-issues-where-assignee-project-lead-or-where-assignee-reporter]",

Your input in the comments helps us understand how your teams work and what you're hoping to accomplish with JIRA.\n\nWe have decided to close this specific request for _additional status categories_ as Won't Fix. The finite set of status categories allows us to build useful features on top of them, like completion progress indicators for Epics and Versions.\n\nWe recognize that for many teams, most of the steps in a workflow are \"In Progress\" and that it can be difficult to distinguish them. Here are some strategies:\n* Add additional columns to your board for different workflow states. You can have several \"In Progress\" columns to represent concepts like \"In Development\" or \"Under Review\".\n* Use the card colors based on JQL queries feature ([documentation|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/AGILE/Customising+Cards#CustomisingCards-colours]) to define your own colors for workflow states. I've created this suggestion in the JIRA Agile project to improve this in the future: GHS-11666\n* Use JIRA Agile card layouts (new in JIRA Agile 6.6) to show the workflow state on the card ([documentation|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/AGILE/Customising+Cards#CustomisingCards-fields])\n* To customize the display of issues within the JIRA issue navigator, consider the free third-party [icnavigator add-on|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/de.iconcept.icnavigator.jira-icnavigator] from Interconcept GmbH.\n\nWe do not plan to support arbitrary colors for status categories. The mapping of blue, yellow, and green to \"To Do\", \"In Progress\", and \"Done\" is part of [Atlassian's overall visual system|https://design.atlassian.com/latest/product/components/lozenges/]. Our intent is to improve how we use this pattern to communicate information in JIRA; however, we use the combination of colors and lozenges to represent concepts not only in JIRA, but across Atlassian's product suite.\n\nFinally, there were specific requests for a \"Red\" status color. The main use case here was situations where an issue had progressed to the end of a workflow, but the resolution was negative (e.g. \"Failed\" instead of \"Done\"). In JIRA's structure, this connects the final workflow state (i.e. \"Resolved\") with the type of resolution. While there's certainly merit in this request, it has the potential to significantly increase JIRA's complexity.\n\nI understand that our decision may be disappointing. Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.\n\nRegards,\nDave Meyer\nJIRA Product Manager\n{panel}\n\nThe new status colors in JIRA provides initial set of pre-defined statues. It would also be beneficial to add the ability for users to add more categories to it",

Suggested Solution\nAt the end of that documentation it says that \"_Atlassian accounts cannot be managed via public APIs today. We are currently evaluating how best to expose these capabilities in a secure manner that best meets our customers' use cases._\"\nThis request is to track the re-implementation of such endpoint.\nh3.

Problem\nThere is a bug on the integration between IDEs like Webstorm and JIRA, although the support for IDE in JIRA was discontinued.\n\nThe bug was reported originally in our JIRA support site to be fixed since when using this integration our users were being logged out of JIRA.You can see the bug reported here:\n[JRA-42154|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRA-42154]\n\nSince this issue was related to a connector, the bug was moved to the Connector's project:\n[PL-3051|https://ecosystem.atlassian.net/browse/PL-3051]\n\nhttps://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2015/06/discontinuing-ide-connectors-support/\n\nh3. Suggestion\n\nAdd any kind of compatibility or feature where the user does not face the login intermittent issue when making API calls to JIRA.\n\nh3. Workarounds\n\n*I was able to find some workarounds on my research that might be useful, although it's necessary an additional license in JIRA, which is inconvenient for our customers*\n\n- Change the password of your own account, so if an unknown app / service was using your account and destroying the sessions it no longer could\n- Create a dedicated account and use it credentials to connect Webstorm and Jira. In this way, Webstorm could no longer destroy the sessions of your own account.\n- You can upgrade to snapshot versions in the Global Settings -> General -> Auto Upgrade section of the connector's configuration. (This workaround was suggested PL-3051 comments).",

If he wants to create a filter with basic search, he will find all the 30 status in the system, though he only will see a query when he uses the 5 he has permission for.\n\nWould it be possible to fade out all the other status?\n\n\u00a0\n\nBest Regards,\n\nAlex Richter",
