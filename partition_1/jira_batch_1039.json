Issue Summary\r\n\r\nCopied from\u00a0[ACJIRA-2449|https://ecosystem.atlassian.net/browse/ACJIRA-2449]\r\n\r\nOur Jira Cloud Connect App is using the following scopes:\r\n\r\n\"scopes\": [\r\n \"read\",\r\n \"write\",\r\n \"admin\",\r\n \"act_as_user\"\r\n ]\r\n Which are listed as follows in the \"Integration Details\" of the Marketplace page:\r\n * Act on a user's behalf, even when the user is offline\r\n * Administer the host application\r\n * Administer Confluence spaces\r\n * Administer Jira projects\r\n * Delete data from the host application\r\n * Write data to the host application\r\n * Read data from the host application\r\n\r\nIt is unclear to us where the \"Administer Confluence spaces\" scope is coming from (the app being a Jira app). It is not listed among the Jira scopes for connect apps. We found a post in the community with the same issue that did not get any answer.\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Create marketplace listing with an app that has `admin` scope.\r\n # Look at Integration Details on the marketplace page\r\n # There's\u00a0Administer Confluence spaces despite app being Jira only\r\n\r\nh3.

I found a turnaround (CTRL+Z) but it is not satisfying as I am sharing many URLs on a daily basis. One more argument : in my case, I don't need the link preview most of the time (like 90% of times when I'm sharing a URL, because I'm working with developers who need the full URL). The link preview is useful only a minority of times, and is nice-to-have feature instead of must-have feature.\r\n\r\nHere is a 20 seconds video explaining my problem in details : [https://www.loom.com/share/5b9efd7b0572479f86bb24a654d2f251]\u00a0\u00a0(you can read the comments below the video on Loom)\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThank you very much for your consideration,\r\nMaxime",

      "description": "{panel:title=Atlassian update - 4 August 2021}\r\n\r\nHi all!\u00a0\r\nA quick update from the Jira issue and Smart Links teams.\r\n\r\nFirstly, thanks for your ongoing, candid feedback. Please rest assured that we are closely monitoring your feedback and discussing internally.\u00a0\r\n\r\nI understand this issue is increasingly causing challenges for our users. I'm currently working with our Smart Links team to explore this problem space to better understand nearer term improvements.\u00a0\r\n\r\nI'll continue to update this ticket as I have more to share.\u00a0\r\n\r\nCheers,\u00a0\r\nVenkatesh | Jira Issue PM\r\n----\r\n\r\nHi everyone,\r\n\r\nThanks for voting and commenting on this issue. Your feedback is key to helping us understand how you use Jira so we can continue improving your experience. We have reviewed this issue over the last few days, however there are not currently any plans to implement this suggestion.\r\n\r\nWhile we understand the logic for wanting to have different default options, our current focus is on making the unfurl states of Smart Links richer both inside and outside the editor across our products. Based off customer feedback, this is where we believe it\u2019s most necessary to focus our efforts in the short-term.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, you can change the Smart Link back to a normal url by clicking on the Smart Link in edit mode, and selecting \u201cDisplay URL\u201d from the toolbar dropdown.\r\n\r\nWe will continue to track this ticket and feedback across our various customer channels. Please remember that [jira.atlassian.com|http://jira.atlassian.com/] is one of many inputs for the Jira roadmap. You can\u00a0[learn more about our process here|https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/110373/how-does-the-jira-team-use-jira-atlassian-com].\r\n\r\nI understand that our decision may be disappointing. Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.\r\n\r\nVenkatesh Vasudevan\r\n vvasudevan@atlassian.com\r\n Product Manager, Jira Cloud\r\n{panel}\r\nh3. \u00a0\r\n\r\n*Problem Definition*\r\n\r\nOn the new issue view, whenever you paste a link on the Description or comment field, Jira initiates a Smart Link that will attempt to preview this link. It shows the below link \"Connect to preview link\"\r\n !smart-link.png|thumbnail!\r\nh3. *Suggestion*\r\n\r\nAllow an option to be able to disable the Smart link by providing a \"turn off/on\" Smart link button, either on the Instance as a whole or on per Issue basis.\r\nh3. *Workaround*\r\n\r\n_Note: Current workarounds only apply when creating a smart link. As a user viewing a smart link there is no current workaround._\r\n\r\nIn order to remove the Smart link from rendering on the new issue view.\r\n - Paste the Google link for example, once it renders to preview the link\r\n - Press Ctrl + Z (Windows) or Cmd + Z (MacOS) (this will revert the link to a normal blue link)\r\n\r\nAlternative workaround:\r\n - When inserting the link, be sure to use http:// instead of [https://|https:]. The Smart Card feature will not be activated, and upon visiting the URL, it will automatically redirect to https:// for these services.",

Workaround\r\n\r\nCurrently, the only available workaround is to add the macro again, without adding the Text Field (multi-line) custom field.\r\n\r\nAnother potential workaround:\r\nUse Jira Issue macro as a potential workaround. Here are some documentation:\u00a0[https://support.atlassian.com/confluence-cloud/docs/insert-the-jira-issues-macro/]\r\nAfter selecting the tasks to display using a filter or JQL query, we can use the table display option to customize the columns that will be shown like so:\r\n!Screen Shot 2021-08-10 at 12.39.09 PM.png|thumbnail!",

It would be nice to have a feature whereby users can send an email based on a 'keyword' configured on a project issue and that email is translated into an existing comment given that the user's email who sent it is a valid user in the project and is able to comment on that project issue. This way, the user doesn't need to know the issue key or reply to a Jira address. A configured mail handler would be configured on the project with options of a custom or system email address. So all the user needs to do is send an email to that address with a variable in either the subject or body of the email and that will automatically be added as a comment in an issue.",
