[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-60068].\n  {panel}\n\nh3. Problem Definition\nCurrently JIRA has only one mail queue and the processing of the queue is synchronous (1 by 1) and hence an item in the mail queue that is taking a very long time to process (e.g a large amount of recipients on a filter subscription could take a long time to execute) could cause other email notifications to back up considerably on the mail queue. The impact on this is that other critical notifications may be delayed at the expense of the long running filter subscription.\n\nh3. Suggested Solution\nIt would be nice if the mail queue could process mails asynchronously to reduce the chance that other notifications get delayed and back up due to a long running item in the queue.\n\nh3. Workaround \n* If you have identified notifications taking a long time to process e.g. filter subscriptions for a large number of recipients, you may want to reschedule this kind of subscriptions to run at off-peak period and not too regularly.\n* It is also possible to use the *Bypass currently sending mail* feature to suspend the long running mail item to all other notifications to go through quicker.",

As it is now we have to manually create all of the sub-tasks (we open the Story issue and create sub-tasks one at a time).\nIf when we highlighted a table with our sub-tasks, and could choose a Story that existed on the page for linking, it would save us a tremendous amount of time.\n\nIf my description of this is not clear I'd love a chance to try explaining again.

I am currently playing with the event listener plugin trying to ramp up on event listeners as well as logging debug messages.\nI am at step 5. of the tutorial where we create a project and an issue and then resolve the issue. This should produce log messages based on the event listener however, I am not seeing any log messages for the creation or the resolution of an issue.\nNote the tutorial refers to creating software development type project but these are no longer available in JIRA 7so I create a Project Management of Business type project.\nI have checked to ensure that the plugin is actually enabled and it is. Also I reviewed the Logging and Profiling screen to ensure that the com.example.tutorial.plugins logging level is set to DEBUG which it is.\nI am at a loss of how to further debug this event listener issue. Any debug suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Is there a JIRA 7 version of this event listener tutorial:?",

Problem\nThe supported platforms documentation for [JIRA 6.3.x|https://confluence.atlassian.com/jira063/supported-platforms-683541780.html] and [6.4.x|https://confluence.atlassian.com/jira/supported-platforms-207488170.html] currently states that Java 7 and 8 are both supported. Although the application functions properly with Java 7, but there are a large number of cases - especially when it comes to medium to large instances - when the performance on Java 7 is significantly worse than it is on Java 8, not to talk about the same instance running on earlier versions of JIRA.\n\nh4. Proposed solution\nWe already have a [knowledge base article|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRAKB/Java+8+improves+JIRA+application+performance+dramatically] that describes the performance gain on Java 8, but customers who upgrade or install JIRA will not necessarily browse through the KB space. \n\nWe should mention the significant performance impact when using Java 7 in both the supported platforms documentation and the related upgrade documentation to clarify the situation and avoid post-mortem suggestions for customers being affected by this issue.\n\nWe should probably also evaluate removing Java 7 as supported platform for these versions, given the number of performance related issues we see.\n\nh5.

It firstly checks if such an element exist. If it does but cannot be reused then it creates the element with a changed name.\nFor example, you import a workflow but your current JIRA already contains \"Ready to View\" node but it differs in type. The workflow import then renames the imported node as \"Ready to View - 2\".\nWhen you then proceed to import a project will find that the flow is incorrect as the project import \"forgets\" the \"Ready to View\" is now \"Ready to View - 2\" and the project import does not proceed.\nAnother example are Screens during the actual project import.\nWhen the project import process find out that \"Default\" screen configuration already exist then it creates \"Default - 2\" then it proceeds with the project import but it associates it with \"Default\" rather than \"Default - 2\".\n\nh3. Suggested Solutions\n# Give user an option to stop importing when a change of name is necessary. Just inform the user that \"Ready to View\" exists but is not compatible because it has a different type.\nThe user then has the option to abort the import and fix the problem or he will have an option to ignore and proceed with \"Ready to View - 2\"\n#  Having original element name. When you import a workflow and it gets renamed to \"Ready to View - 2\" then the project import will find out that the workflow doesn't fit the import but the incorrect elements have expected original name and the project import can proceed.\n",

After taking into account actual usage of different webhook events and potential workarounds for restricting them, we decided to action in the following ways:\r\n # We are splitting this collective request into separate issues - each for individual webhook event - in order to make it more clear what is the status of JQL support for each of webhook events respectively, and to give you opportunity to express demand for specific improvements. From now on you can refer to the following issues for JQL filtering of:\r\n ## Comment webhooks - JRACLOUD-68235\r\n ## Attachment webhooks - JRACLOUD-68594\r\n ## Worklog webhooks - JRACLOUD-68595\r\n # Since December 2017, JQL filtering is available for Comment webhooks. For the remaining webhook events, it is still possible to restrict them by [substituting variables in the webhook URL|https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/webhooks/#variable-substitution-in-the-webhook-url].\r\n # We have updated [Jira Cloud Webhooks documentation|https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/webhooks/] to make it more clear that JQL filtering is only supported for a subset of webhook events, and what those events are.\r\n # As of January 2018 JQL filtering of Attachment, Worklog and Issue Link webhooks (as well as others not mentioned as JQL enabled in the documentation) is not supported, and that works by design. Therefore, adding such functionality is treaded as improvement suggestion in the newly created issues.\r\n # At this moment we do not have plans to add JQL filtering for the remaining webhook events, but we can revisit that decision in the future.\r\n # As a consequence of splitting the issue, and because the main use case was addressed, we\u2019re closing as Fixed.\r\n\r\nWe understand that your expectations expressed in this issue have not been fully addressed, but after balancing the value of competing priorities we\u2019ve determined that focusing on Comment webhooks would provide the biggest value for Jira Cloud app developers. To that end, I hope you appreciate the transparency of this update.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n Eve Stankiewicz\r\n Product Manager, Jira Cloud Platform\r\n{panel}\r\n*Original request description:*\r\nh3. Summary\r\n\r\nJQL filter for Webhooks doesn't work correctly when the following related events are fired:\r\n * _Comment_\r\n * _Worklog_\r\n * _attachment_\r\n * _issuelink_\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Create an webhook as follows\r\n ** Issue related events\r\n *** JQL: {{project = <PROJECTKEY>}}\r\n *** Issue: created, updated\r\n *** Issue link: created deleted\r\n *** Comment: created, updated\r\n *** Worklog: created,updated\r\n *** Attachment: created, deleted\r\n !webhooks.png|thumbnail!\r\n # Make a comment, log work, upload an attachment or link an issue in a project aside from the one which is specified with the JQL\r\n\r\nh3.

We noticed that you're also able to search for blog posts. \nThis leads to the attached misery. We got this going for us by using the common \"Web Link\" interface. \n\nIn conclusion, I think that you either shouldn't be able to find blogposts in the Confluence Page interface, or if so, blogposts aren't properly rendered by Jira.\n\nJust wanted to point this out :)\n\nHave a nice day",

The resolution of JRA-36670 is a bit controversial, it has a resolution won't fix and explanation that it is \"by design\". However people report that they lose content while accidentally pressing the escape button.\n\nThis bug regards editing a description of an issue, and clicking File->Save Page As, or  pressing the keyboard shortcut ctrl-s. The dialog for choosing a file name appears. When clicking the cancel button a user returns to editing an issue, but while hitting the escape button instead, the dialog closes which is correct behavior, but simultaneously all updates to description are lost.\nI think the escape button should have the action \"close the dialog\" and nothing else.\n\nI have the habit of pressing ctrl-s, and after that pressing the escape button. Due to this I lose content very often.\n",

Suggested Solution\nIt would be great to be able to disable these WARNINGS on the log. Unfortunately it doesn't work by changing the logging level on the Logging & Profilling page for the classes: *com.sun.jersey.spi.container.servlet.WebComponent* & *com.sun.jersey.spi.container.servlet.WebComponent.filterFormParameters*\n\nh3. Workaround\nChange the logging level for the com.sun.jersey.spi.container.servlet.WebComponent class in the conf/logging.properties file by adding this line:\n{code}\ncom.sun.jersey.spi.container.servlet.WebComponent.level = SEVERE\n{code}\nThis will prevent the Warnings from being logged.\n\nh3. Notes\nError is not triggered specifically for TimeSince gadget only\n",

Experienced Behavior:\n\nAfter creating a project the Default Issue Type Scheme is not automatically updated to include issue types created during project creation. \n* The Default Issue Type Scheme must include all issue types. These types not being included in the Default Issue Type Scheme causes errors when performing actions in JIRA\n\nh5. Expected Behavior:\n\nAll issue types are added to Default Issue Type Scheme when the issue types are added to JIRA. The description of this scheme indicates it should be automatically updated.\n** \"Default issue type scheme is the list of global issue types. All newly created issue types will automatically be added to this scheme.\"\n\nh5. Steps to Reproduce:\n\n# Start with new JIRA 7 instance\n# Install JIRA Software \n#* Notice two issue types (epic, story) are created automatically and appear in the Default Issue Type Scheme.\n# Create new JIRA Software project\n#* Notice that new issue types have been created and a new issue type scheme has been created for that project. This new scheme contains the issue types defined in the project template. \n#* The default issue type scheme is not updated to include the issue types that were added during project creation.\n\nh5. Workaround:\n\n* JIRA Server\nFollow the instructions in [this KB|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRAKB/Unable+to+move+issue+to+another+Issue+Type+due+to+%27The+issue+type+selected+is+invalid%27+error] to add the issue types to the scheme\n\n* JIRA Cloud\nOpen a support ticket at [Atlassian Support|https://support.atlassian.com] to have those issue types added.\n",

And since it doesn't update the existing page with Ajax callbacks, often times we lose track of the latest comments made by others, while we're writing a comment or viewing a JIRA ticket. This can lead to confusing inconveniences because of the race conditions that take place between the last refresh timestamp of the page and submitting a new comment or change for the ticket.\nThis use case is particularly important while we are dealing with Escalation issues (i.e. CPSDEVESC) that sometimes requires almost immediate notification on the currently while we're working on the currently open windows.\nWhile comment Ajax refresh functionality is the most important aspect, it would be also a non-trivial benefit if JIRA pages can support Ajax callbacks for any and all updates on any field on the page (e.g. type, description, assignee).\nWithout this feature, we constantly have to refresh all the pages for all the jira tickets that are open in our browsers, which makes it impossible to get the latest update feed once we start to write a comment, since we can not refresh the page while writing a comment or making a change on one part of the ticket.",

Problem Definition\n\nNormally you get an JSON from the REST API, no matter if it's an error or a success with data. This isn't the case when i successfully upload an image via multipart. The Jira API returns an textarea with the \"success\" JSON inside:\n\nFor example:\n!image001.png! \n\nh3. Suggested Solution\n \nIt would be great when an avatar is successfully uploaded in JIRA via REST API, it will be returning a meaningful success or error JSON data instead of a meaningless result.\n",

Summary\n\nUsing the REST api to update an issue field (eg. fixVersions) with specifically incorrect JSON will return successful (204 No Content), and wipe the field instead of returning an error.\n\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\n\n# Send a PUT request to /rest/api2/issue/<issueno> with the following payload:\n\n{code}\n{ \"fields\": { \"fixVersions\": [ { \"add\": \"1.2.3\" } ] } }\n{code}\n\nh3. Expected Results\n\nJIRA should return an error, indicating that the JSON is incorrect. In this case, the JSON does not have the correct key to identify the type of version we are trying to add (eg. name, id, etc).\n\nh3. Actual Results\n\nJIRA will wipe the fixVersions field, and return HTTP 204 (No Content, ie. Success).\n\nh3. Notes\nCorrect JSON for the same update would look like:\n\n{code}\n{ \"fields\": { \"fixVersions\": [ { \"name\": \"1.2.3\" } ] } }\nOR\n{ \"update\": { \"fixVersions\": [ { \"add\": { \"name\": \"1.2.3\" } } ] } }\n{code}\n",

It would be much more convenient to be able to have the link copied from a previous comment be pasted into the new comment as a labeled link rather than as the full URL. So the steps would be: 1) Right-click the previous comment's chain-link-sign to copy the link 2) Use a button in the new comment to paste a reference to the previous comment as a labeled hyperlink such as 'Comment NNNN'. Currently I can work around this by doing the labeling of the URL myself but it would be convenient to make it a one-step operation.\"\n\nThanks,\nRobert\n",

Please upgrade to JIRA Agile 6.7 and try again.*\n\n*Suggested Solution*\nSince prior to JIRA 7.1.0, JIRA was able to handle the upgrade task automatically, implemented the same upgrade task should be ideal for the users.\n\n*Workaround*\nUser will have to upgrade their source JIRA instance's JIRA Agile to version 6.7 and above, create new XML backup and restore that backup in the target JIRA instance. \n\n\n{panel:title=Brydie McCoy [Atlassian] }\nUnfortunately it was becoming too difficult to maintain older upgrade tasks, so in 7.1.0 the Agile team removed upgrade tasks older than 12 months.\nYou can either\nUpgrade JIRA Agile to 6.7.x on their original instance (for JIRA 6.3, 6.4 and 6.5). Or;\nImport the data into a JIRA Software 7.0.0 instance first. (or upgrade the original instance to 7.0.0)\nBoth of these scenarios will run the required upgrade tasks.\nCheers,\nJIRA Software Team\n{panel}",

Summary\nCopied from [ACJIRA-513|https://ecosystem.atlassian.net/browse/ACJIRA-513]:\nWhen I call REST API using basic authentication and the user has a non-ASCII character in their name, e.g. '\u00e4', the status 401 (Unauthorized) is returned. The name:password string is converted into a byte array using UTF8 before base-64 encoding. I also tried ASCII, but that is not supposed to work anyway.\nPlease note that JIRA user names can contain non-ASCII characters (e.g. umlauts) and a user with such a name can log in to JIRA using the web UI. rest/auth/1/session processes names with non-ASCII characters fine as well.\n\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\n# Step 1 - Create a user with non-ASCII character name like \"\u0142ukasz\"\n# Step 2 - Do rest call as the user. \"curl -u \u0142ukasz:test http://localhost:8090/jira/rest/api/2/issue/TEST-2\"\n\nh3. Expected Results\nIssue json should be returned for the user.\n\nh3. Actual Results\n{noformat}\nHTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized\nContent-Encoding: gzip\nContent-Type: text/html;charset=UTF-8\nDate: Thu, 18 Feb 2016 10:53:23 GMT\nServer: Apache-Coyote/1.1\nSet-Cookie: JSESSIONID=91304E14DAA60D5A14292013A062A13B; Path=/jira/; HttpOnly\nTransfer-Encoding: chunked\nVary: User-Agent\nWWW-Authenticate: OAuth realm=\"http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A8090%2Fjira\"\nX-AREQUESTID: 1313x7361x1\nX-ASEN: SEN\nX-Content-Type-Options: nosniff\nX-Seraph-LoginReason: AUTHENTICATED_FAILED\n{noformat}\n \nh3. Notes\nSee [ACJIRA-513|https://ecosystem.atlassian.net/browse/ACJIRA-513] description and comments for more details.\n\nh3.Workaround\nRemove non-ascii character from user name\n",

Requirement\nCurrently, JIRA will log slow queries in {{atlassian-slow-queries.log}} that run longer than 400ms. This value is hardcoded, cannot be adjusted. It would be extremely beneficial for troubleshooting purposes to able to modify the threshold, to see less \"noise\" and focus on longer running queries only.\n\nh4. Proposed solution\nEither have a [system property|https://confluence.atlassian.com/jira/recognized-system-properties-for-jira-229180062.html] that would override the default value, or even a more administrator-friendly solution would be to have this adjustable runtime on the Administration UI.\n",
