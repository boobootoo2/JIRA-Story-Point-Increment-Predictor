[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-37475].\n  {panel}\n\nAs reported by [~kavian]:\n{quote}\nWe discovered scalability problems with the implementation of four of the gadgets provided by jira-gadgets-plugin:\n* Two-Dimensional Filter Statistics\n* Issue Statistics\n* Pie Chart\n* Heat Map\n\nAll four of these use a similar implementation where the internal value objects for the \"count-by\" field are loaded into memory for all issues returned by the filter...and this is done in a loop, so the objects will continue to be loaded into memory with no opportunity for garbage collection.  In cases where there are a large number of values, this can cause JIRA to run out of memory, which causes the application to fail and require restart.\n\nMost of our outages have corresponded to the use of one of these gadgets where the \"count-by\" field was a user field (e.g. Reporter, Assignee, or a custom User Picker), so this leads us to believe that there may also be scalability issues with the new ApplicationUser implementations.  However, we aren't as certain about this last part, since at least one of our outages did not involve a user field.\n\nWe have mitigated the immediate impact of this problem by notifying our users of this behaviour, and asking them not to use these gadgets with large datasets.  However, we would like this to be addressed properly to eliminate the risk of accidental outage, and to allow our users to use these gadgets as needed.\n\nThe following is the details of the execution path that leads to outage (this is the trace for the Issue Statistics gadget, but a similar path exists for the other three gadgets):\n\n* the {{/rest/gadget/1.0/stats/generate}} call maps to com.atlassian.jira.gadgets.system.StatsResource.*getData*\n\n* on line 145 in the getData method, a com.atlassian.jira.web.bean.StatisticAccessorBean object is created\n\n* on line 148 in the getData method, the *getWrapper* method of the StatisticAccessorBean object is called, and this is what essentially pulls the data (the rest of the getData method is prepping the results for output)\n** the getData method also creates a StatisticsMapper object (line 144) and passes it to the getWrapper method\n*** for counts by Assignee, this is a com.atlassian.jira.issue.statistics.AssigneeStatisticsMapper object, which is really a simple extension of com.atlassian.jira.issue.statistics.UserStatisticsMapper\n\n* after the getWrapper method pulls the data, it iterates through the results and translates each GenericValue to a real object (line 198 in StatisticAccessorBean) using the *getValueFromLuceneField* method of the StatisticsMapper\n\n* UserStatisticsManager.getValueFromLuceneField is implemented using an instance of its inner class *UserManagerResolver*\n\n* UserManagerResolver.apply calls JIRA's UserManager.getUserByKey method to get the ApplicationUser instance, and passes that into ApplicationUsers.toDirectoryUser to get the embedded-Crowd User object\n** this is what is being repeated for every Assignee found in the search result\n** the embedded-Crowd User objects (and possibly the ApplicationUser objects) are not released for garbage collection until the entire user operation has completed\n{quote}",

I need to create the visual controls with Javascript because the properties change depending on a \"type\" property. So far so good.

When I inspect the HTML, there is a \"style=\"height: 278px;\"\" out of nothing in it, even when I set explicitly \"set style=\"height: 56px;\"\"\nIn the edit dialog the text areas look OK, so in the inline edit someone is overwriting my style. And even if I don't set a height (which was my first approach), it is set the height with an inline style. In both cases (dialog and inline) the textarea have the class \"textarea full-width-field\"\nThe textarea dimensions are 598x272 (~2.2 ratio), in case this means something.\nThe inline editor is populated, of course, in the NEW_CONTENT_ADDED event, as from the tutorials, while the editor and creation dialogs are populated from the Velocity template itself:\n There is also a \"Add\" button to add items, and when I add new items from it, the created textareas have the correct height, whether the one I explicitly set via \"style\", or the default.\n\nOriginally posted in Atlassian Answers[1].

I have users that like to create issues using email and want to get an email back that contains the new issue number in the subject.  From my understanding, currently they must either use the UI or set their profile to notify them of all changes.  As a suggestion, it would be great to have a \" on create issue only\" setting.  I guess this would also have to work in conjunction with the project notification scheme as I assume having \"Reporter\" in the create issue section only works when the user creates from the UI.

the application url from a domain name to localhost when I updated to jira 6.2 (jira and confluence are public - running behind a apache proxy) Yet, I reverted this change and the exception was still thrown. \nI also made sure that jira as well as confluence both have the necessary SSL certificate in their store.\nIn the end I suspect it must be a bug in 6.2 because I did not have this problem

Only user with JIRA Administrators or JIRA System Administrators can edit user groups. In corporate settings with many non-public projects it would be helpful to be able to delegate the management of group memberships to project leads in order to relieve jira-admins of this task.\n\nh3. Suggested Solution\nCreation of user group will still be under JIRA Administrators or JIRA System Administrators, but Project Lead can add/remove users in the user groups. Better still, if there is \"membership-edit\" permission, so that JIRA Administrators or JIRA System Administrators can grant such permission to the respective Project Lead can perform add/remove users.",

[See the corresponding bug report|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-37337].\n  {panel}\n\nh3. Summary\n\nWe're seeing an increasing number of issues where customers are reporting initial page load times in excess of 10-15 seconds, and sometimes more.\n\nh3. Cause\n\nWhen accessing a page within JIRA, a set of {{batch.js}} and {{batch.css}} files are provided that contain the batched Javascript and CSS resources for the page. Upon first load of a page this cache is created (if it does not already exist on the server), and is then stored for future loads of the page. This cache is a server-side cache and is separate from the client-side cache (ie the cached {{batch.js}} and {{batch.css}} files in the browser). The creation of the cache can take some time - 10 to 15 seconds - so on first load of a page it will take some time for the page to load.\n\nOn first load of any page in JIRA it does download quite a lot of content, which is then cached in the browser, so it is expected that the first page-load will be longer than any subsequent page loads. This is exacerbated when the cache is being recreated as it adds even more time onto that page load. \n\nThe cache is created on a language/locale basis, so for example if users access a page in English it will be generated, and other users access pages in Russian it will be generated again. The cache is invalidated when there are Look & Feel changes, or plugin changes occur. This means if these changes occur the cache will need to be recreated and will cause page load times to increase until the cache is created and stored server-side. If there are users with a variety of different languages using the server it will mean the cache is recreated multiple times.\n\nIn certain cases where multiple concurrent requests take place they can end up all running the batch generation simultaneously, leading to the CPU spiking and the instance potentially becoming unresponsive while all the requests are processed. \n\nOnce a type of page has been visited per user (e.g. the dashboard, a JIRA issue or a project page) the {{batch.css}} will be cached for that type of page until the next restart or plugin change. So the first time you view one of these pages the performance will be slow, but it will improve significantly on each subsequent visit.\n\nh3. Steps to reproduce\n# Go to any JIRA instance - this can be easily replicated with a jira-dev instance\n# Disable or enable a plugin\n# Load the dashboard\n\nLooking at the Network tab of developer tools, you'll see that there's a long delay in loading those batch files.\n\nh3. Workaround\n\nSchedule plugin changes during off-peak periods, and then visit a page in JIRA to ensure the cache is recreated during that off-peak period.\n\n(!) *Note:* It is always best practice to schedule plugin installations and upgrades in off-peak periods or during maintenance windows. For JIRA Download customers it is also recommended to perform major plugin changes on a staging instance before it is done on a live environment. \n\nh3. Diagnosis\n\nFor one of the ways of identifying this problem, this will show us the number of threads waiting to process LESS compilation. A higher number over a series of thread dumps can be considered bad.\n\nThe below is being executed in a folder with a significant number of thread dumps labelled jstack that were taken over a series of days.\n\n{noformat}\n$ grep -B1 \"com.atlassian.plugin.cache.filecache.impl.CachedFile.stream\" jstack* |grep \"waiting to lock\" |awk '{print $1}' | sort |uniq -c\n  31 jstack.13007.110759.851358689-\n  58 jstack.13007.110810.528822009-\n  54 jstack.13007.110821.172461523-\n  42 jstack.4440.threadHigh.103649.939600529-\n  44 jstack.4440.threadHigh.103701.620551473-\n  48 jstack.4440.threadHigh.103713.178859435-\n  51 jstack.4440.threadHigh.103724.736087099-\n  57 jstack.4440.threadHigh.103736.376659166-\n{noformat}\n\nHere we see the thread dumps taken over time continue to consistently have a higher number of threads most likely waiting to compile LESS.
