We'd love to hear your thoughts!\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nMarek Radochonski\r\n Senior Product Manager, Crowd\r\n [mradochonski@atlassian.com|mailto:mradochonski@atlassian.com]\r\n{panel}\r\nA customer pointed out that it will be cool to have a group (or groups) level admin permission.\r\n\r\nThis permission will allow them to control who can be a member of their group(s) and grant appropriate permissions to them.\r\n\r\nThis way those group owners would have control over adding/removing users from their group without having to be a JIRA/Confluence/Crowd admin. This would be similar to how JIRA allows project admins to place users into roles for their project. The control would be with the individuals that maintain the groups, not Crowd admins.",
