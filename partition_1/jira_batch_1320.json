When you have 100 issues to reorder dragging them around is painful and slow. The backlogs in JIRA have a right click function that allows you to move something to the top or bottom of the backlog without dragging. This would be a great start if this functionality was brought into Portfolio. Additionally the rank numbers on the right side, it would be awesome if I could just type over let\u00a0say issue 99 and automatically move it to 5 and the whole list would reorder moving the current 5 to 6 and so on to make room for 99 to move to 5. this would be ideal.\r\nh3.

This is described below:\r\nSuppose we have a Portfolio Item (SAFe Epic) with 3 Capabilities underneath: C1, C2 and C3. Each of the Capabilities has in turn 3 Features:\r\nF-A, F-B and F-C are under C1,\r\nF-D, F-E and F-F are under C2,\r\nF-G, F-H and F-I are under C3.\r\n\r\nThe Features get story point estimate either from Stories linked to them or the estimate is put directly into Features when there are no Stories defined yet. Then, the estimates in Capabilities and Portfolio are simply roll up of Feature estimates. Features are then scheduled either based on Stories (if available) or based on their estimate and teams' capacity / skill set. This all works as expected.\r\n\r\nWhat we are looking for as a useful addition is:\r\n * for Capabilities and Portfolio to have the duration bar on the Schedule displayed automatically based on the duration of the underlying Features.\r\n * for Portfolio and Capability on the Schedule to have an \"expand\" clickable link (like a \"+\") that would expand the item and would show the underlying items and their duration. We would need that on two levels: expand Portfolio to see Capabilities and then expand Capability / Capabilities to see the Features.\r\n * for the entire Schedule to be able to filter by Portfolio and Capability, so that if we choose a Portfolio item we can see only this Portfolio item on the schedule, but we can still expand it as described in the bullet above. The same for Capability.",

      "description": "The Portfolio groups act like global permissions. Members added to a\u00a0Portfolio group have global portfolio rights based on the group controls. This does not work for permission controls through Roles and schemes.\u00a0\r\n\r\n*Suggest extending the Role permission controls to include Portfolio permission controls.*\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe PROJECT\u00a0administrator is better informed to add individual users to the roles that correspond to their project roles, per project. Note: a Product\u00a0Owner\u00a0(PO) would be given more rights to their primary projects but limited rights to secondary projects. We don't want all POs to be able to rearrange all project backlogs.\r\n\r\nLike permissions on Issues, the project admin can add the project PO\u00a0to the project Role.PO.\r\n\r\nUnlike Issues, what the project SHOULD be able to do:\r\n\r\nAll POs\u00a0that depend on the primary projects would be added to\u00a0Role.PO. \r\nAll members of Role.PO\u00a0are also granted Portfolio_Users access.\r\n\r\nAll POs that observe on secondary projects would be added to Role.observer. \r\nAll members of Role.observe are also granted Portfolio_Viewers access.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe Permissions scheme should have the portfolio permission controls added such that Role.PO can be added to Portfolio_Users control and Role.observer can be added to Portfolio_Viewers control.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe current Portfolio groups would be added to Global permissions for those that need full portfolio rights across all projects.\u00a0\r\n\r\nWhy the current portfolio permission model is cumbersome:\r\n\r\nWe have ~9,000 users in the system through Active Directory. As we create new projects they will need to be given the correct access to their primary projects and observer\u00a0access to all other projects. For portfolio access the project admins will have to inform our small\u00a0group of jira-admin\\Jira-sysad when a user is added to a specific role so they can be added to the corresponding portfolio group. All users must be warned that they have global portfolio access and specific project access. They might not find out the level of permissions on projects until they try to commit plan changes.\u00a0\r\n\r\nPlease integrate portfolio permissions into\u00a0JIRA software and core permissions so that the scheme creation and permission controls are implemented consistently. This is another issue that makes the JIRA products (Portfolio) look and feel separate an not integrated.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0",
