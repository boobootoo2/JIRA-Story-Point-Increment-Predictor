When I hover over each name though nothing pops up.\n\nI bring this up because in Jira 4.1.2 we have a plugin that overrides the user-format so that links to all the users other than the current user go to a mailto: link rather than ViewProfile. Now that Jira 4.3 has the user hover pop up, which I love, this re-formatting of user-format is not necessary except in gadgets like Filter Results.\n\nI would leave our user format code in and add a condition for when it's coming from Gadgets, but there's no easy way to tell inside the User Format code where the format request is coming from. \n\nAnd then there's Activity Streams (JRA-22089) ...",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-25057].\n  {panel}\n\nThe way that Jira handles sub-tasks is inconsistent with standard project management methodology.  A sub-task, by definition, is a fractional component of a parent task.  In other words, a parent task can be broken down into multiple smaller steps, each of which is a sub-task.  Assuming there is an complete listing of sub-tasks, once all of the sub-tasks are completed, the parent task is also complete.  So that if a parent task is estimated to take 10 hours to complete, it can be broken down into, for instance, five two-hour sub-tasks.  The time required to complete the sub-tasks does not add to the total time of the parent task; rather, the time for the parent task is already inclusive of the sub-task time.\n\nJira, however, treats sub-tasks as \"related tasks,\" which is a completely different concept. When a sub-task is created and a time estimate entered, that time estimate adds to the total time of the parent task, which then results in inflated project time estimates and an inability to effectively track and report on the remaining work because time is getting double counted -- once in the sub-task and once in the parent task.  The only workaround for this situation is to enter a zero time estimate for the sub-task and to log work against the sub-task in the parent task, which does solve the problem but removes the ability to track estimate accuracy against the sub-tasks within Jira.\n\nTo resolve this situation, Jira would be improved by not adding time estimate for a sub-task to the total estimate for a parent task unless the total estimated time for all of the sub-tasks for a given parent task exceeded the original estimate for the parent task.  Logging time against a sub-task should then reduce the total remaining time for the sub-task as well as the parent task.  ",

The correct name ordering in Hungary is Surname first, and Givenname last. \nIf they edit users in JIRA, and set \"Full Name\" in hungarian name order, then the givenName and sn LDAP attributes gets mixed up. The sn attribute will store the given name, and the givenName attribute will store the surname. As they use LDAP for other purposes too, they cannot do this. \n\nPlease help.\n\nRegards,\nRuchi",

Most plugins use Velocity templates for their UI features.\n\nProblem: Velocity files in JIRA can use #parse and #macro to make them scale better. Plugins can't use #parse at all, and #macro only works within the same .vm file. \nThis makes it hard for plugins to scale. Developing and debugging a large, monolithic .vm file is hard to get right.\n\nIdea: modify the DefaultVelocityManager so that when it is used by a plugin it changes the Velocity engine properties and adds the resources directory as a valid TEMPLATE_ROOT for finding macros and .vm files to include. Document this with a small reference plugin that shows how to use these Velocity features to improve your own plugin.",

The \"blocks\" links typically form a directed-acyclic-graph, not a tree. A DAG can have the following structure:\n\n{noformat}\n       C \n      / \\\n A - B   E - F \n      \\ /\n       D\n{noformat}\n\nThe Links Hierarchy Plug-in does not handle this case well.

I've formatted so that the link to the page is followed by the issue I'm discussing.\n\n\n\nhttp://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Installing+Java\n- linux commands for setting JAVA_HOME missing (though this could be because of differences in distro) But I found that this is pretty standard...\necho JAVA_HOME=\"</PATH/TO/JAVA>\" >> /etc/environment\n\n\n\nhttp://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Installing+JIRA+Standalone+from+an+Archive+File+on+Windows%2C+Linux+or+Solaris\n\nCan we make a note and link that using the .bin file is recommended over doing it manually from the archive file\n\n\n1. Download and Extract the JIRA Standalone Archive File\n\nThis did not suggest where to put JIRA in the first place, though I understand if this is purposeful... we could say something like this if we thought it necessary.\nmkdir -p /opt/atlassian/jira\nmv *.tar.gz /opt/atlassian/jira\ncd /opt/atlassian/jira\ntar xfvz atlassian-jira-4.4-*.tar.gz\nln -s atlassian-jira-4.4-BLAH current\n\n\n2. Set the JIRA Home Directory in JIRA\n\nCan we have the path of application.properties without having to click for it?\n./atlassian-jira/WEB-INF/classes/jira-application.properties\n\nOnly a small thing but I think it's more of a convention to use </suggested/paths> as such.\nexport JIRA_HOME = </path/to/jira/home>\nCan we give an example that it's usually set as something like /var/atlassian/jira ?\n\nI think exporting can be risky because the system will forget it when logged out and in again. Instead maybe something like:\necho JIRA_HOME=/var/atlassian/jira >> /etc/environment\n\n\n\n3. Create a Dedicated User Account on the Operating System to Run JIRA\n\nCan we suggest a dedicated user account AND group?\n\ngroupadd atlassian\nThen add the user jira and put it into the group atlassian:\nuseradd --create-home --comment \"Account for running JIRA\" --shell /bin/bash jira -G atlassian\n\nSuggestion for setting permissions\nchown -R jira:atlassian </path/to/jira/install>\nchmod 770 </path/to/jira/install> (please tighten for security if necessary)\nchown -R jira:atlassian </path/to/jira/home>\nchmod 770 </path/to/jira/home> (please tighten for security if necessary)\n\n\n4. Start JIRA\n\nWait until the following message appears in the application's log file: - give path to log file instead of having to click elsewhere.\n\nIf JIRA does not appear in your web browser, you may need to change the port that JIRA runs on.\nAlso suggest to check OS and network firewalls\n\n\nhttp://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Running+the+Setup+Wizard\n\nCan we please link to a page on dragons (or wherever) that tells the customer how to set up on different databases eg: postgres...\n\nBasic Postgres setup information:\nyum install postgresql84-libs.x86_64 postgresql84-server.x86_64 postgresql84-devel.x86_64\nsu postgres\ninitdb /var/lib/pgsql/data\n* check postgresql.conf \n(adjust security)\nlisten_addresses = '*'  \n* check pg_hba.conf\n(adjust security)\nhost    all         all       0.0.0.0/0               trust\nexit\n/etc/init.d/postgresql start\nsu postgres\ncreateuser jira_user\nShall the new role be a superuser?

The style should be similar to 'Greenhopper Days Remaining' - Big Bold Number. \n\nThe information it should provide relates to Service Level Agreement commitment projections based on historical data. This concept is especially used with Kanban processes, where a commitment is made as a new task starts, that it will be complete within <statistic> days. \n\nThe commitment is based on the (recent) historical mean for the cycle time (ie.\"work started\" - to - \"done\" period) for issues [of that type] PLUS 2 standard deviations. \n\nThe problem I am striking is that JQL seems too primitive to allow me to select an appropriate set of records and perform statistical calculations based on values for certain fields in those records.\n\nWhat is needed is:\nWhere Project is <name>\n  Pick the (configurable number) most recently \"Closed\" or \"Resolved\" issues\n    For these issues, calculate the mean and standard deviation from the time difference between the \"work started\" and \"done\" timestamps\n      Display = Mean + (2 * Sigma)\n\nOf course this would also be best with additional filtering, so the set of issues calculated over would be taken from a selected Component or Version or Assignee. As we are using 'shirt size' estimates via a custom field, it would be good to filter based on that also, so that we can have a gadget that displays the current SLA commitment for each estimation size.\n\nAn additional option to display the actual mean would be useful also.\n\nI attach suggested graphic and config mockups\n",

It's well said in the comments:\n{quote}This isn't unique. There are lots of settings that unfortunately are global: priorities, resolutions, links, etc.\nIn all cases, though, it makes a JIRA instance difficult to scale logically. It's more than just a bug tracker; it can be used to track lots of processes.{quote}\n\nWe are certainly working to make JIRA more flexible on a per-project basis so that it's easier for a variety of teams to adapt it. Voting certainly falls under this category. While this issue is not currently on our roadmap, we do hope to address this in the future.\n\nPlease don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.\n\nRegards,\nDave Meyer\nJIRA Product Manager\n{panel}\n\nWe would like to be able to turn on voting on a per project basis.  We have a range of project types, ranging from help desks to dev projects and voting is not appropriate, or rather, confusing, in some projects.  As a result we disable voting globally.",

They can do this by creating searchers that implement CustomFieldStattable. However they often can't render their custom field contents properly in these gadgets so the end effect looks poor.\n\nThis is because the Velocity context used to render a custom field (with the label resource) is is limited to just three variables where it is defined in CustomFieldSearcherModuleDescriptor.java getStatHtml(). Adding a line such as\n\n{code}\nMap extraVariables = field.getCustomFieldType().getVelocityParameters(null, field, null);\n{code}\n\nwould at least allow extra variables to be passed when rendering the label template file.

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-24961].\n  {panel}\n\nStory: a JIRA administrator (or JIRA user) wants to perform some set of actions many hundreds of times. These actions are available via the web to the user. \nMany administrators open a new tab for each action in turn, because there is no easy way to automate bulk operations, e.g. changing a scheme on a project.\n\nAim: make JIRA configuration and maintenance scale as well as JIRA data does by making it easier for users to automate actions in JIRA\n\nCurrently administrators have a few choices. Users have fewer choices. All these choices are:\n\n1. UI tools (Selenium) - pretty crude and sensitive to UI changes\n2. A SOAP/REST plugin to expose an API to execute the set of operations, and then use a client-side script. This is probably the most common approach right now.\n3. A plugin to execute just that set of operations - can be a fair amount of work, not clear which internal APIs to use or how to use them\n4. A Jelly script - outdated, little support in the last three years\n5. (JIRA 4.3 and later) Speakeasy is the client-side approach to doing this in the browser, but it doesn't allow access to all the actions that administrators or users may want to use.\n\nThere are at least two plugins available that let you execute Groovy, JRuby, Jython etc scripts inside JIRA. They are Script Runner (https://plugins.atlassian.com/plugin/details/6820) and JIRA REST CLI (http://leonardinius.blogspot.com/2011/03/release-announcement-jira-rest-cli-05.html and https://plugins.atlassian.com/plugin/details/40268)\n\n\nThis issue is the result of a number of discussions at Summit, plus feedback received on \"Practical JIRA Administration\" (O'Reilly, 2011).",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-24954].\n  {panel}\n\nHi, this is probably a bit unusual, but I'm filing a ticket to provide you guys with a solution. Your article on this was a huge help in correlating the fact that these crashes weren't unique to our product, so thought you'd be interested in the Java bug we've raised with Oracle, as these have caused significant problems for our clients:\n\nhttp://confluence.atlassian.com/display/GHKB/JIRA+with+GreenHopper+Crashes+Java+with+a+SIGSEGV+Fault+on+Linux+64bit+JVMs\n\nThe short summary is: stack overflows in Java native calls should never crash the JVM, unless you have your own native library that's deeply recursing. Crashes have been confirmed to be prevented with a -XX:StackShadowPages=20 on Linux x86_64 and may also address these on UltraSPAC (sparcv9).\n\nCheers!\nDanny\n\nJava bug: http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=7059899\n\n{quote}\nAs our clients have migrated to 64-bit JVMs we've seen a significant number of JVM crashes due to SIGSEGV on Unix platforms. These are spontaneous and do not trigger a HotSpot crash report. Each crash involved an application bug that caused deep recursion that should have resulted in a java.lang.StackOverflowError, for instance an infinite struts forward or a search continuance/referral loop during LDAP authentication. This affects both Solaris and Linux platforms, but a 64-bit JVM is always the common factor.\n\nWe referred to the Java SE Troubleshooting Guide section '4.1.3 Crash due to Stack Overflow' and found that likely, the StackShadowPages value is too small for these platforms. The guide discusses custom JNI libraries, however we're seeing these conditions in \"normal\" native calls, usually socket operations, reads or writes, which lead us to investigate further, as this should not be the case. According to the OpenJDK source the default on x84 platforms is 3, and is doubled to 6 on AMD64. There is a x86 Solaris value, seemingly to accomodate C++ compiler bugs on that platform, however our experience has shown that perhaps this is \n\nhttp://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk6/jdk6/hotspot/file/9b013e207574/src/cpu/x86/vm/globals_x86.hpp\n{code}\n       60 #ifdef AMD64\n       61 // Very large C++ stack frames using solaris-amd64 optimized builds\n       62 // due to lack of optimization caused by C++ compiler bugs\n       63 define_pd_global(intx, StackShadowPages, SOLARIS_ONLY(20) NOT_SOLARIS(6) DEBUG_ONLY(+2));\n       64 #else\n       65 define_pd_global(intx, StackShadowPages, 3 DEBUG_ONLY(+5));\n       66 #endif // AMD64\n{code}\n\nWe can only conclude that either 64-bit stack frames on AMD64 are generally far larger than their 32-bit equivalents or there's a problem with the way this value is calculated (I believe it's OS pagesize * StackShadowPages), allowing previously benign stack overflows in Java code to crash the JVM. Lab testing indicates that 17 was is the smallest StackShadowPages size that prevented the JVM from crashing with a segmentation fault. We have not confirmed the value on Solaris (UltraSPARC, we don't support our product on Solaris x86), however we have certainly seen these conditions affect both platforms. \n\nOthers have also encountered 64-bit specific SIGSEGVs, bug 6346701 seems to report exactly this kind of condition, however I could not see an outright discussion anywhere that indicated that there could be a problem with the default shipping value or calculation of the number of pages to look ahead before invoking native methods:\n\nhttp://confluence.atlassian.com/display/GHKB/JIRA+with+GreenHopper+Crashes+Java+with+a+SIGSEGV+Fault+on+Linux+64bit+JVMs\nhttp://fusesource.com/forums/thread.jspa?messageID=7830\n\nWe identified the offending threads using gdb, and jstack thread dumps identified the following two crash use cases:\n \nCrash 1 -

The way it works is quite fragile and wasteful, in that every time the table storing sequences is manipulated outside of {{SequenceUtil}}, the current {{SequenceUtil}} has to be trashed by means of calling {{GenericDelegator.refereshSequencer}}. Because the sequence util uses in-memory ID banks of size 100, every time we refresh we lose anything from 0 to 100 IDs from the sequence. This could be improved by setting the sequence value in the DB table to the current in-memory sequence value upon {{refreshSequencer}} and when the {{GenericDelegator}} is shut down.

I have had a chat with Olli Nevalainen and we agreed that this is a good improvement request for the behavior of JIRA when a user is deleted from the AD side or from Crowd.\n\nCurrently, the user would disappear from the JIRA user browser and will show up in gray color in the issues when he is the assignee of reporter. However, this may cause problems later on. I have witnessed one problem of it when retrieving SOAP remote issues which their assignee/reporter does not exist in JIRA due to him/her being deleted from LDAP/Crowd side. There may be more hidden problems about it.\n\nDeleting a user who matches any of this criteria was never possible from the UI:\n# Assignee of any issue\n# Reporter of any issue\n# Lead of any project\n\nThus, I have raised this improvement request to keep the user in JIRA even after being deleted from the external user management system, but as an inactive user (he/she will not be able to log-in anyway).\n\nRegards,\nAli",

Update\n\nSee [comment below|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRA-24926?focusedCommentId=259508&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-259508] for an update on what needs to be done to address this issue.\n\nh4. Problem description:\nI have noticed that when the documentation instructions are followed from here:\nhttp://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA043/Installing+JIRA+on+Tomcat+6.0\n\nDue to step 4 instructions:\n{quote}\nTomcat does not come with some libraries required to run JIRA. To fix this, download\n\nhttp://downloads.atlassian.com/software/jira/downloads/jira-jars-tomcat-distribution-4.3-tomcat-6x.zip\nand copy the contained jars to Tomcat's lib/ directory. (Be sure to remove existing versions of these JAR before copying the new ones.)\n\n    In particular, to prevent exceptions related to logging, please ensure that commons-logging-1.0.4.jar and log4j-1.2.15.jar are present in Tomcat's /lib/ directory. Also ensure that these files are not present in Tomcat's webapps/jira/WEB-INF/lib directory.\n\nAdditionally, if you are running Sun's distribution of Tomcat, download tomcat-dbcp.jar and copy it to the tomcat6/lib directory.\n{quote}\n\nThe jar files below will end up in both of the directories:\n* _<TOMCAT>\\webapp\\jira\\WEB-INF\\lib_\n* _<TOMCAT>\\lib_\n\n| jcl-over-slf4j-1.5.8.jar |\n| jul-to-slf4j-1.5.8.jar |\n| slf4j-api-1.5.8.jar |\n| slf4j-log4j12-1.5.8.jar |\n\nh4. Impact analysis:\nDue to this, JIRA may possibly encounter errors like:\n\n{code}\njava.lang.RuntimeException: XSRF white list failure\n{code}\n\nEven if not, it does not make sense that there should be duplicate jar files accessible to JIRA.\n\nh4. Suggested resolution:\n* Either these jar files can be removed from the JIRA jars tomcat distribution libraries:\nhttp://downloads.atlassian.com/software/jira/downloads/jira-jars-tomcat-distribution-4.3-tomcat-6x.zip\n* Or the documentation needs to be updated to warn about these duplicates and ask the user to delete them if they exist.\n\n_Note: tested with JIRA 4.3. The same problem may exist with massive amount of JIRA versions_\n\nThank you very much,\nAli\nAtlassian Support",

Users can still create a separate label that is a different case. E.g. 'Taylor' and 'taylor' will be stored as two different labels if you want to do so.\r\n\r\nWe believe that making the autocomplete search functionality case insensitive, it will prevent users from creating derivative labels of the same name because users will see all available options regardless of case. At the same time, users are still able to create specific labels by case if they need to.\u00a0E.g. 'Taylor' and 'taylor' will be stored as two different labels, which is existing functionality.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThis should make it much more usable moving forward without negatively affecting what is currently stored as labels in your projects today.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or would like to see anything else re: this issue, please add your comments below.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\nTaylor Pechacek\r\n tpechacek@atlassian.com\r\n Senior Product Manager, Jira\r\n{panel}\r\nh3. Problem Definition\r\n\r\nWhen applying a label, JIRA will not find existing labels that have a different case:\r\n\r\n!Label_search_not_case-insensitive.jpg|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nBasic search has the same behavior:\r\n\r\n!Screen Shot 2015-05-13 at 10.05.41.jpg|thumbnail!\r\n !Screen Shot 2015-05-13 at 10.05.33.jpg|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nAn *advanced* search, using JQL, will find all labels and is case insensitive.\r\n{code:java}\r\nlabels=\"it_maintenance\"{code}\r\nreturns all results.\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nLabels should be case insensitive. That is, if an issue already has a label *Australia* then it shouldn't allow a second label *AUSTRALIA*\r\n\r\nThere isn't any use to be able to label an issue as *Australia*, *australia* and *AUSTRALIA* because searching for the word Australia in any case will return the issue.",

In other hand, during a upgrade from previous version to JIRA 4.3.x if users management was once delegated to external Crowd and this integration is removed, users are not migrated to JIRA internal user database.\n\nAtlassian does not provide a path to migrate user information from Crowd to JIRA during the upgrade. This is by design. If you previous installation of JIRA was integrated with Crowd, all users, groups and membership information will be saved on Crowd database. Therefore if during the upgrade the external instance of Crowd is not available or if upgrade notes for Crowd integrated were not follow, JIRA will NOT recreate the users locally.\n\n\nWorkaround: http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRAKB/Migration+path+from+Crowd+to+Crowd+Embedded+during+upgrade+to+JIRA+4.3.x",

The \"add\" response is that i am no longer logged in. after i log back in, the text is gone! suggestions are 1) retain the text after log-in. i dont mind logging back in, but its a hassle to retype the text. 2) pop the log-in dialog not on the \"add\" event, but on the js event that opens the text entry box. 3) alter the GUI in some way when time-out occurs to alert the user that they are no longer logged in ",

You are able to do this in a JIRA 4 dashboard with filter list gadgets, roadmap gadgets, but to many i've talked to, the jira 3 summary page was more useful.  This is because this page is teh default landing point for clicking a fix version link,  I've ported the jira 3 version summary panel to JIRA 4 and added quick links to the green-hopper task and planning boards, version admin page, etc -  But i'd rather be able to configure that frequently trafficked view like we do with dashboards.

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-24779].\n  {panel}\n\nAfter 9 years of development in our Jira 'TRI' Project, we have more than 1200 versions in total, from which 940 archived. With this long list, it becomes very time consuming to Release, Archive, Unarchive or Delete versions, as it has to be done one by one, while it gets slower and slower because of the number of versions.\n\nThe essence of the problem with the Jira Version management functionality is the bad performance with about 1200 versions (or more) in the database. I make the assumption this has to do with the fact that all (>1200) versions are retreived, every time one action (release, archive, unarchive, edit, delete) is done. Moreover, on the project overview screen, just the top 15 version are shown as read-only, and a seperate link to view them all.\n\nThe solution I propose is simple; just adding an option (Boolaan, checkbox) on the Jira Version Management screen, someting like 'Show archived versions' (default on No).When this option is No (false), the Archived versions are not retreived after every action, and not (default) shown on the Version Management page. I expect this will largely increase the performance of this functionality.\n\nKind regards,\nHans Brouwer\nTriodos Bank NV \nNetherlands",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-24776].\n  {panel}\n\nHello all,\nI would like to implement a JIRA project for test management purposes, using 2 different issue types, \"Test Plan\" and \"Test Case\".\n\nOne \"Test Plan\" can have more than one \"Test Case\"\nOne \"Test Case\" can relate to more than one \"Test Plan\" (or if you want \"Test Case\"'s can be shared among \"Test Plan\"'s\nEach \"Test Plan\" should aggregate time estimates for all the \"Test Case\"'s associated to it\nThings I have already tried:\n\nCreate \"Test Plan\" and \"Test Case\" issue types; Link \"Test Case\"'s to the relevant \"Test Plan\"'s. OUTCOME: Works fine for sharing \"Case\"'s among \"Plan\"'s but does not aggregate time estimates\nCreate \"Test Plan\" as issue types and \"Test Case\"'s as sub-task of a plan. OUTCOME: Works fine for calculating overall \"Test Plan\"'s estimates but does not allow sharing of \"Test Case\"'s sub tasks among \"Test Plans\"\nUse Structure to organize the hierarchical model. OUTCOME: Works well for calculating overall estimates by aggregating estimates of each child \"Test Case\" but does not allow sharing of \"Test Case\"'s among Test Plan (once a \"Test Case\" is inserted in the structure under a plan, it is not available any more to be added under a second plan)\n\nWhen I submitted my issue to JIRA support (https://support.atlassian.com/browse/JSP-81631) I was told that this is unattainable at present but that I should request a new feature to make it possible to share a sub-task (in the example above a Test Case) among more than one parent task (in the example above a Test Plan) and still get the parent issue Test Plan estimates to aggregate the estimates of all the sub-tasks associated to it.\n\nThanks a million in advance,\n\nMarco",
