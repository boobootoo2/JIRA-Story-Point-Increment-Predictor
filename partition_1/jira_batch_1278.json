Application components get a UserTransaction object through a JNDI lookup using the name java:comp/UserTransaction or by requesting injection of a UserTransaction object.\"\n\nUsing the non-spec compliant binding of java:comp/env/UserTransaction probably works on Tomcat, but is not guaranteed to work on any other container. At this point let me declare my interest here as one of the core Jetty developers. That notwithstanding, surely it is in Atlassian's interests to be as container agnostic as possible? Especially on such a trivial issue.\n\nMoreover, as JIRA is a well-known application no doubt many users would assume it uses industry best-practice and would copy this unfortunately incorrect and non-spec compliant configuration.\n\nI again urge the JIRA developers to stick with spec compliance and simply fix the JNDI name configured in entityengine.xml.\n",

To find issues that are assigned to someone other than \"jack\" or \"jill\" or are unassigned, you would need to type: assignee not in (jack,jill) or assignee is empty.\n\n\nThis is very frustrating, and besides that our users are not aware of this limitation (unless they dig in the doc which they never do) and thus complain that the query results are not correct.\nI would also believe that a 'not in' result should return non-match AND empty values.",

They don't know how to use it? Moreover, they are puzzled about the gadget directory, Chart, JIRA, wallboard, etc. When people just want to use some component to track their team's user stories, they cannot to transfer their mind to gadget by this gadget directory.\n\nSo i suggest i can customize the gadget directory to pie, table, curve, histogram, etc. It's clear to JIRA user. They can config their JIRA as what they think. Like the image below.\n\n!cat.png!",

If you access Gmail through a POP or IMAP email client (e.g. Outlook) and would like to send messages with a custom \"from\" address, you have two options. We recommend that you configure your email client with two outgoing SMTP servers, one for Gmail and one for your other address. Or, you can use Gmail's outbound servers with a different \"from\" address. If you've already configured the alternate address, your message will be sent from:otheraddress@domain.com, sender:username@gmail.com, regardless of which custom from configuration you chose.\n\nThe custom 'From:' feature works only if you already own the account linker to the alternate address. To send mail with a different Gmail username, you must first sign up for that address.",

This basically means {{status was progress [12:00, 1:00)}}. We generate the Lucene query {{endChange > 12:00 and startChange < 1:00 and newValue = \"progress\"}}. This is good and correct.\n\nNow lets say you had this:\n\n{noformat}\n11:30 -> 12:00   ->  12:00    -> 1:00\nOpen     Starting    Progress    QA\n{noformat}\n\nThis will produce the Index entries:\n\n{noformat}\n[11:30, 12:00) -> Open\n[12:00, 12:00) -> Starting\n[12:00, 1:00)  -> Progress\n[1:00, +Inf) -> QA\n{noformat}\n\nNow lets say we run the query {{status was starting on -1h}} at 1:30. We generate the Lucene query {{endChange > 12:00 and startChange < 1:00 and newValue = \"starting\"}}. Unfortunately this will not match the zero length \"Starting\" change at 12:00. This is no way to match this change using ON. *THIS IS THE BUG*\n\nFurther assume that the history is actually following.\n\n{noformat}\n11:30 -> 12:01   ->  12:01    -> 1:00\nOpen     Starting    Progress    QA\n{noformat}\n\nThis will produce the Index entries:\n\n{noformat}\n[11:30, 12:01) -> Open\n[12:01, 12:01) -> Starting\n[12:01, 1:00)  -> Progress\n[1:00, +Inf) -> QA\n{noformat}\n\nIn this case we will match the zero length \"Starting\" change item with the query {{endChange > 12:00 and startChange < 1:00 and newValue = \"starting\"}}.\n\nBefore you say this will never happen, many of our databases (e.g MySQL and Oracle) only store dates down to second precision.

This works on the view issue page. Unfortunately, when the issue operation is rendered on the issue navigator, the issue parameter isn't in the velocity context - only the issueId parameter is present.\n\nI'd expect both of these to contain the same velocity parameters when rendering. If they don't, then the documentation should be updated so developers know what parameters they can rely on here.\n\nSee getIssueOperations() in IssueNavigator for where the IssueOperations get their velocity parameters (well, velocity parameter) in the issue nav.\n\nCaused https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/BON-18",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-25417].\n  {panel}\n\nWe've had situations where some project roles (i.e., such as Project Manager's) that do not wish to receive automatic e-mail notifications when their issues are updated, created, etc. while others in the same role/group do.  Since subscriptions can only be created for personal use or group(s) their still is not a way to create some form of subscription for those who do or do not wish to receive notifications.  And even if there was the system would send the results of the subscription to all in the group vice just the assignee.  Suggest implementing one of two systems.\n\n#1) Allow each person to have the option on their profile to either 'receive' or 'not receive' automated notifications from JIRA.  This scheme involves just notifications, not subscriptions. \n\n#2) Add functionality within the subscription feature to allow adding project roles and/or individuals to the subscription.  You can setup a group with only one individual now but the extra steps seem totally needless to achieve the same results.  Moreover, with this add an additional option of sending the subscription only to those who are affected (i.e., the assignee, reporter, project, or a configurable paradigm setup by the JIRA Administrator).\n\nBoth the notification schema and subscription functionality is a power feature to help keep on top of things.  Adding one or both of these recommendations would simply make this a much more powerful capability. ",

Having the ability to convert an email into a JIRA task/issue would provide an easy and efficient way for managers to quickly create a queue of maintenance/bug fix/enhnacement tickets in JIRA. Its much easier to forget about creating a task in JIRA when in a fast paced operational environment. Turning an email into JIRA issue/task ensures nothing important will be missed along with capturing vital information about who requested the change and when. Its a big time saver as information has to be copied over from email into a new JIRA issue form. Ofcourse, it may not work for all cases as one has to come up with a proper summary and descirption for the issue but still a lot of poeple would appreciate this feature.",
