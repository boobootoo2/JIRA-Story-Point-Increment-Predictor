The underlying logic to perform the actual copy-on-auth is already implemented.\r\n\r\nThe other part of this UI task is to show/hide extra properties required to implement copy-on-auth.

As the issue hasn't collect votes, watchers, comments, or support cases from many customers during its lifetime, it's very low on our priority list, and will not be fixed in the foreseeable future. That's why we've decided to resolve it as *Timed Out*.\r\n\r\nAlthough we're aware the issue is still important to those of you who were involved in the conversations around it, we want to be clear in managing your expectations. The Crowd team is focusing on issues that have broad impact and high value, reflected by the number of comments, votes, support cases, and customers interested. Please consult the [Atlassian Bugfix Policy|https://confluence.atlassian.com/support/atlassian-server-bug-fix-policy-201294573.html] for more details.\r\n\r\nWe understand how disappointing this decision may be, but we hope you'll appreciate our transparent approach and communication.\r\n\r\nAtlassian will continue to watch this issue for further updates, so please feel free to share your thoughts in the comments.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nCrowd Team\r\n{panel}\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThis is inefficient, and happens to be causing problems for multi-tenancy in JIRA.

The default database file includes the password, but it's of course encrypted, and I don't see any other user accounts. I have tried copying the admin's encrypted password into the crowd account insert statement and running, but no luck.\r\n\r\nI am basically running this out of the box, so I am tempted to blame windows character encoding. I am a little surprised not to find any other material on this, but perhaps writing crowd plugins is not very popular and everyone uses a mac? I will try on my mac when I get home. I was able to run the tutorial successfully in jira and the refapp, but I can't even get into crowd...\r\n\r\nDon Brown requested that I create a Crowd bug, in response to my forum post, or I would have probably done a support request first.\r\n\r\nhttp://forums.atlassian.com/thread.jspa?threadID=50046&tstart=0\r\n\r\nThanks!",

In the Apache logs, an error says that Perl/site/lib/Atlassian/Crowd.pm fails in line 60. This is where the SOAP request if given to the SOAP::LITE Perl Library. The SOAP Library checks for the environment variable HTTP_PROXY and sends the request to the HTTP Proxy - which cannot handle \"http://localhost:8095/crowd/services/SecurityServer\"\r\nand so it return an error. As a result, the authentication for /tools will fail.\r\n\r\nThere are several ways to fix this. Atlassian could extend the auth plugin to analyze the parameter CrowdSOAPURL in details. Then make SOAP::LITE not use any proxy setting for requests to \"http://127.0.0.1:12345/...\" or \"http://loclahost:12345/...\". But I assume SOAP::LITE has no such configuration options. \r\n\r\nThus it may come down to extending/fixing Perl's SOAP::LITE to handle this properly. Or use another SOAP library that can handle this. \r\n\r\nI have solved this for now by removing HTTP_PROXY from the environment variables and telling everybody never ever to do this again. \r\n\r\n",

This gives you a LinkageError because the app server class loader doesn't allow classes for that package to be loaded from a different class loader.\r\n\r\nThe problems are in the files\r\n * stax-api-1.0.1.jar\r\n * xml-apis-1.3.03.jar\r\n * xbean-2.2.0.jar\r\n\r\nFor there libraries are new versions available without the javax.xml.* packages.\r\n\r\nI ran into this problem because I wanted to connect to a SOAP webservice (via wsdl2java) in my Crowd Plugin I'm developing.\r\n\r\n ",
