Please adjust the display verbiage.\n\nh3. Background:\nREST APIs cannot be turned off and this needs to be made clear in the UI as they are essential core JIRA components that require access from client to server in order to process and feedback information from JIRA. \n\nFor example, JIRAs entire @ mention system relies solely on the REST API's, along with that all functions in greenhopper, JQL searching etc... require data to be passed to and from your browser via the APIs, turning them off would likely cease the function of the web app.\n\nThere is no inherent security risk in having the REST API open as all access control of the APIs is also the same access control held by your JIRA instance. IE: if you can see an issue via your REST APIs then you can also see if through the interface.\n\neg:\nIf I don't need to be logged in to get information from this issue in my browser:\n{code}\nhttp://localhost:8527/browse/EXM-1\n{code}\nI also don't need to be logged in to get this information through the REST API:\n{code}\nhttp://localhost:8527/rest/api/latest/issue/EXM-1\n{code}\n\nIf I, on the other hand restricted public access to that issue, then I also would not be able to obtain JSON data about it through the APIs. The access control is one and the same.\n\n\n",

Provide the option to require resolution via a checkbox (because the transition or status name is some form of Close/Closed/Answered/Resolved/etc) or some form of UI element that doesn't require going back and editing the transition once it's created.\n\nTaking that a step further, being able to save elements of a transition for reuse (favorite?) or copy them from other workflows would be awesome.  Thinking similar to the move dialog for a page in Confluence... Workflowname > Transition Name copy to Currentworkflow > From Status1 to Status2. \n\nThere are ways to mitigate this by efficiently reusing old workflows, but that isn't always possible (and not everyone is always that efficient).  Something that satisfies the above I think would be a very nice admin quality of life improvement.\n\nIf any of this is unclear I can Photoshop up some ideas.\n",

By \"used\" I mean issues where the given field actually has a value set.\n# Provide a list of fields that are not used in any filters. This is pretty extreme, but should give a good indicator of how useful a field actually is.\n\nFollowing the audit, the user should be given basic options to:\n# Automatically or manually down-scope the context of a given field. The automatic function would reduce the scope of the field to those projects where the field has one or more issues with the value set.\n# Remove options from any fields with pre-defined options if any one or more of those options was never used\n# Remove fields in their entirety if \n## They've never had a value set in any jiras OR they've only had a value set in x # jiras or less\n## There hasn't been a value set for that field in over x period of time\n## The field is not referenced by any filters\n",

The app enables\u00a0site administrators to migrate selected Jira Software projects from Jira Server to Jira Cloud.\r\n\r\nTo find our more about the Jira Cloud Migration Assistant EAP edition can do, and for links to sign-up, please go over to this article on Atlassian Community:\u00a0[https://community.atlassian.com/t5/Jira-Migrations-Early-Access/About-the-Jira-Cloud-Migration-Assistant-early-access-program/gpm-p/1165638]\r\n\r\nAlso, because this ticket originally covered more than just Server to Cloud project migration, for clarity we have separated the original ticket into multiple tickets.\r\n * This ticket tracks the Jira Server to Cloud migration and\r\n * The following ticket tracks the Jira\u00a0Cloud to Cloud migration: JRACLOUD-72570\u00a0If you are interested in Jira Cloud to Cloud project migration, please head over to the new ticket to vote, watch, and comment.\r\n\r\nThanks for everyone\u2019s patience. We look forward to progressing the development of the Jira Cloud Migration Assistant with your feedback so please continue to vote, comment and also [signup for early access|https://community.atlassian.com/t5/Jira-Migrations-Early-Access/About-the-Jira-Cloud-Migration-Assistant-early-access-program/gpm-p/1165638].\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nJason Wong and Chris Clarke\r\n\r\nProduct Management, Atlassian Cloud Migrations",

We have faced this issue multiple times so far when our Custom field name is longer and the text goes to multiple lines. I know there is a workaround to add that information in the description box. But, we do not want to do that every time. We want to type it in the field name box. Can this feature be implemented?\n\nThanks\nAdhip",

This is really poor user-experience, especially as it's quite easy to overlook whether you are viewing a saved filter or not.\n\nSecondly, once a query has been saved the permalink button becomes completely non-functional unless I also share the filter with the intended recipients first. Once I've shared the filter, there is very little need for the permalink button in the first place because the intended recipients will be able to find the filter in their list of available filters. As you can only share on a group level, it can be quite tricky to work out which groups you need to share with to get all the right recipients included. You might have to share with a lot of unnecessary people, if your intended target group is quite small.\n\nThis has come about because of JRA-28914 with which I quite strongly disagree. In my opinion, the permalink button should be a *permanent link* to the *current* set of results that I'm looking at.

Whenever the required fields are not available among the default ones, you can add the fields you need by clicking the \"More Criteria\" option and add the field you require. If you often use the basic search, and often require fields not under the default ones, looking them every time becomes tiresome. Could some functionality be added in which you can customize the default fields? I tried to work around this by making JQLs and switch back to basic search, but in that case the extra defined fields in the JQL are not taken in the fields under the basic search, though the additional fields ARE checked when you go to the \"More Criteria\"option",

Steps to Reproduce\r\n1. ensure to have a jira instance with several projects e.g 'Project A' and 'Project B' - Done\r\n2. ensure to have at least two different permission schemes e.g. 'Permission Scheme A' and 'Permission Scheme B' - Done\r\n3. ensure to that e.g. 'Project A' uses the 'Permission Scheme A' and 'Project B' uses the 'Permission Scheme B' - Done\r\n!s1.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\n4. ensure that the 'Browse Project' permission is restricted to the appropriate project roles in each permission scheme e.g. to the project role 'Tester' -Done\r\n!s2.png|thumbnail!\r\n!s3.png|thumbnail!\r\n5. ensure that e.g. 'User A' is assigned as 'Tester' to 'Project A' only, while 'User B' is assigned as 'Tester' to 'Project B' - Done\r\n!s5.png|thumbnail!\r\n!s6.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results:\r\nUser A is not supposed to be able to see Project B at all. \r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results:\r\nUser A is able to see Project A at various places :\r\n1. View All Projects\r\n!s7.png|thumbnail!\r\n2. Issue Navigator\r\n!s8.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nh3.Workaround\r\n* Remove Current Assignee on Browse Projects Permission\r\n\r\n*Workaround to restrict issue view to 'Current Assignee' and Browse Project to only a specific group of users:*\r\nIf a Project is only relevant to one or several groups\r\n# Add the related groups to the Role(Users) or Role(Developers) and remove unrelated groups that shouldn't see the project.\r\n# Set Browse permissions for the Roles. (Remove 'Current Assignee' from Browse Project permission)\r\n# Use Issue level security to restrict viewing to 'Current Assignee'\r\n*Result:* only groups and users in the Roles within Browse Project permission see the project and Browse only issues Assigned to them.\r\nStep by step instructions to set Security Level at [How to limit user to only browse issues assigned to or reported by them|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/CLOUDKB/How+to+limit+user+to+only+browse+issues+assigned+to+or+reported+by+them]\r\n\r\n\r\nKnowledge Base : [Granting Browse Project permission to 'Current Assignee', 'Reporter' or 'User Custom Field Value' allows all users to view Project information|https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirakb/granting-browse-project-permission-to-current-assignee-reporter-or-user-custom-field-value-allows-all-users-to-view-project-information-586056400.html]\r\n\r\n",

We have moved this ticket back and forth between MELSS and OpsEsc a couple times, each time it creates a new JIRA ticket number. I realize we can acccess it via any of the 4+ JIRA ticket numbers it has assigned for this one issue but it would eliminate much confusion if it would assume it's original JIRA ticket number in a project if it is moved back to a project where it has already been moved. Make sense? (it makes it difficult when we refer to the issue by a JIRA ticket number and the number is being incremented each time it is moved back and forth.) \n\nOrig: sets-5048",
