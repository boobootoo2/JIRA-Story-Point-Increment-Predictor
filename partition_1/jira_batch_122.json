This is the path that will also show when you run {{git status}}, however if you run {{git status --porcelain}} then the {{../../}} prefix is not displayed, showing the path relative to the worktree, not the location of the git repo. Since SourceTree uses the {{\\-\\-porcelain}} option, using those file paths directly in other git commands fails with {{pathspec did not match any files}} kind of errors.\r\n\r\nIn order to fix this usage scenario SourceTree needs to detect the {{core.worktree}} setting and adjust paths accordingly.",

Then, to quickly find the latest commit on the branch which is to be merged, I use the top-left filter to filter on that branch.\r\n\r\nWhen we decide to remove the branch after merging, an error message is raised with the following text:\r\n\r\n'git log' failed with code 128:'fatal: bad revision 'aaaa'\r\n'\r\n\r\nwhere aaaa is the name of the branch which was just removed. This message keeps showing up every x seconds, probably because of auto refreshes.\r\n\r\nWhen clicking Merge again and unset the filter on the branch (which actually doesn't exist anymore), the error messages disappear.\r\n\r\nTo summarize, these instructions can be followed to reproduce:\r\n\r\n- switch to master\r\n- create a branch, e.g. aaaa\r\n- commit anything to that branch\r\n- switch back to master\r\n- click Merge\r\n- filter on branch aaaa in the dialog where you pick the commit to merge\r\n- cancel merge (or go ahead with the merge, doesn't matter)\r\n- remove branch aaaa (force if you cancelled the merge)\r\n\r\nTo get rid of the messages:\r\n- click Merge\r\n- filter on branch 'All branches'",

      "description": "While using SourceTree, the view will occasionally spontaneously change, disrupting my workflow.  This change in view seems to be precipitated by the software (not by user input) by spontaneously moving the selected commit from where I'm working (\"Uncommitted changes\") to the most recent commit and displaying the History screen.\r\n\r\nIn the attached animated GIF, you can see how this is an issue while reviewing changes and staging them.  After a hunk is staged, the most recent commit is spontaneously selected.  In this GIF, this happens three times in a row.  Then, on the 4th hunk, the view changes spontaneously even before I click the \"Stage hunk\" button (it changes just after I click on the \"email\" folder).\r\n\r\nHowever, this isn't the only case in which the bug occurs.  One of the more annoying instances is that occasionally, it will select the most recent commit *while I'm typing a commit message on the commit screen*.  This is very frustrating as my hands are on they keyboard, mid-sentence, entering a commit message.  To get back, I need to get back into the commit screen, ensure the cursor is at the correct location in the commit text, and then resume typing... at which point, sometimes SourceTree will select the most recent commit one or two more times, each time kicking me out from the Commit screen, back to the History screen.\r\n\r\nMy guess is that there's something funky going on with SourceTree's file modification detector thinking that changes have been made, and that the History tab needs to be shown again.  The main reason I guess this is that the \"spinning wheel\" that shows when files are being checked for changes appears reliably every time before I'm kicked out back to the History screen and the most recent commit.\r\n\r\nThis issue has been happening for many (3-6) months.  I've continued to use SourceTree since I figured the bug would be addressed in an upcoming update.  However, this bug persists.  Unfortunately, this bug is frustrating enough that if it can't be resolved, I'll likely move to another Git GUI.",
