Issue Summary\r\nUsing the Jira New Navigation, the \"Your Work\" page shows a Recent projects section, which shows the recent projects you've worked on and their queues or boards (according to project type). If the recent queue is under the ITSM categories like Incidents, Changes, the link will redirect to the \"All queues\" section of the JSM project queues -- resulting in an incorrect queue shown.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Create a JSM project with the ITSM template and create some incidents or change tickets.\r\n # Go to the ITSM queues for Incidents or Changes to view the open tickets\r\n# Go to \"Your work\" screen and click on one of the recent queues\r\n# The link will open to a page saying the queue could not be found\r\n\r\n !Screen Shot 2021-10-28 at 09.43.56.png|thumbnail! \r\n !image-2021-10-28-09-45-58-298.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nThe 'Recent Queue' links to the correct queue under the correct ITSM category\r\n\r\nh3.

Resetting a site is a common task as part of migration activities since many admins complete multiple dry runs prior to moving to production. This feature request is aimed at providing an in-app mechanism that allows for the content to be cleared gracefully without negatively affecting the users, groups, apps and licensing on a Jira Cloud instance.\u00a0\r\n\r\n*As a workaround, we have the following options*:\r\n # Importing a blank site Jira import file\r\n # Reset all data on the site but [Unsubscribing/Resubscribing the Product|https://confluence.atlassian.com/cloudkb/reset-and-delete-all-data-from-your-cloud-site-691012037.html#:~:text=On%20your%20cloud%20site%2C%20go,DELETE%20into%20the%20field.]\r\n\r\nh4. Notes on the available Workarounds\r\n * Importing a blank backup on the Jira side could potentially also wipe any connected Confluence users from the DB which would require the Organization to reimport Confluence users which may not be an option if Confluence is already in use in production. The only way to avoid this issue would be to select\u00a0*Merge With Existing Users* which may not be an option depending on how a customer may need to reset the site.\u00a0\r\n !userOptions.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\n * [Unsubcribing/resubscribing|https://confluence.atlassian.com/cloudkb/reset-and-delete-all-data-from-your-cloud-site-691012037.html] to the product can sometimes cause licensing issues (ECTL and other billing issues) and requires admins to engage with Migrations Support & CA Support to address. This can have the potential to affect/block production migrations.\r\n * Unsubscribing from the product also causes all downloaded apps to be reset - so in cases where there are many apps installed, admins have to manually re-install all of the plugins.\u00a0",

Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nWhen a user takes anew photo / video to be insert into the Hybrid Editor the dimensions of the media card on iOS / Android differ. Android displays a big preview with the proper aspect ration where as iOS falls back to the default media card dimensions that crops the preview image.\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nAll platforms are aligned -> display the bigger preview with proper dimensions in the editor.\r\nh3.
