Ticket is \"In Progress\" \n2. Developer transitions the ticket to \"In Review\" and assigns it to a reviewer\n3. The reviewer has some issues with the ticket so they \"Reject Review\" and the transition post function is supposed to re-assign it back to the developer automatically\n\nExpected Result:\nThe ticket is assigned to the previous assignee.\n\nActual Result (for those assignees with changed usernames):\nThe ticket is assigned to the person that was the assignee before the previous assignee, one person too far up the list.",

Summary\n* When re-ordering a sub-tasks one step up or down, this causes the full page to refresh. \n* This issue was not occurring in JIRA 6.4.5 , but it started occurring only after upgrading to JIRA 7. \n\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\n# Install JIRA 7\n# Create an issue\n# Create many sub-task \n# Re-order the sub-task ( move the subtask up and down )\n!rsz_screenshot_from_2015-11-16_171805.png|thumbnail!\n\nh3. Expected Results\n* The sub-task should be able to be moved without the whole page refreshing as it works well in JIRA 6.4.5\n\nh3. Actual Results\n* The whole page is refresh resulting in the user needing to scroll back to where they were before. It refreshes with every Move button push which makes re-organizing sub-tasks too cumbersome to ever do.\n \nh3. Notes\n* This issue is related to [JRA-33647 Allow reordering of sub-tasks with drag & drop and without having to reload the page|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRA-33647] but that ticket did not give enough information and has been closed as duplicate to [JRA-24547 Drag and Drop Subtasks|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRA-24547] which i believe is entirely different to what is reported in this bug ticket as this issue was not occurring in older versions of JIRA. That ticket is also created as a suggestion and i believe this issue a bug.",

Problem Definition\nCurrently, if you upload an image with the same name as the issue key, then JIRA allows you to upload this. However, when you want to insert the image somewhere in your comments, then we are not able to do so as when we type \\!issuekey.png|thumbnail!, then the issue key turns to a hyperlink to the issue, instead of rendering the image.\n\nh3. Suggested Solution\nMake the wiki renderer render the text in a image tag as an image and disregards any issue key links found. An alternative solution could be to have an escape character that will escape the issue key to be rendered as a hyperlink of that issue. \n\nh3. Workaround\nThis is no workaround for this. However, you may still link a image in the comment field using the following method: \\[^Issue-Key.png].This would create a link that would open up when clicked on.",

Problem Definition\nThe URL that is suggested for use in JIRA Data Center behind a load balancer, as mentioned in https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/ENTERPRISE/JIRA+Data+Center+Load+Balancer+examples states to use {{/status}} and it will return {{\"state\":\"RUNNING\"}} for a healthy node that should be in the LB pool.  In my testing, I found that when a node is performing a *foreground re-index* that locks JIRA, it is actually unavailable for processing user requests.  Accessing a node that is performing a locking re-index redirects to an error page and gives an HTTP 503.  When that is occurring, I would not want that node to have user requests routed to it. \n\nh3. Suggested Solution\nHaving multiple nodes for JIRA Data Center, we like foreground re-indexing as it is much faster with the amount of data we have.  So when a node is locked for re-indexing we'd like it to take itself out of the pool. This issue is to suggest either:\n* the /status page be updated to provide a different status during indexing, possibly {{\"state\":\"INDEXING\"}}.  This would allow a LB health check to take the node out of the pool during indexing\n* update the Data Center LB documentation (above) to instruct users to use {{/secure/errors.jsp}} as the health check URL as it more accurately conveys whether a node is capable of servicing requests\n\n",

Currently, users are displaying their wallboards within their environment through TV displays as an information radiator and would like them to display for long periods of time without any interruptions. As of now, it seems the only workaround is to increase the default session timeout but this isn't viable in some situations as this increase the session timeout for all users. Maybe there is a way to remove a session for a specific user, include a feature within JIRA to refresh the session timeout for a wallboard or enable the display of a wallboard without having to login as a user.",

I want to have a base screen, that can be included into other screens, but when the base screen is updated, it gets updated everywhere. For example, I would be able to have a \"Create\", \"Edit\", \"View\" screen for an issue type (each locked down by permissions), but each of those screens have the same \"Asset Location\" Screen as a tab within them. So instead of a \"Create_Asset_Location\", \"Edit_Asset_Location\", and \"View_Asset_Location\" screen (each of which needs updated if new location metadata is added), I want a \"Asset_Location\" screen that gets tied to each \"Create\", \"Edit\", \"View\" Screen as a tab. Only update the \"Asset_Location\" screen, and it works on the other three.",

When adding a new custom field to the server it automatically adds these fields to all the field configurations and makes it visible. This makes the field show in the search view, and the excel export view. \n\nThis means that when data is exported from an issue type that should have only 12 fields. the excel file actually has 900 columns in the file making the exported data worthless. Additionally the search only shows 10 or so fields so if you don't know all the available fields it is near impossible to decide which columns you want to show in the search results. or which fields you want to search for. \n\nWe know that we could go in to all the field configurations and hide all the unused fields for all these. However the problem is when a project has a new requirement and adds a new custom field then the field automatically becomes visible in all projects. \n\nThe default behavior should be changed when new fields are added. or at very least allow the person creating the field decide which projects to apply the field to.

However, the developer kit and what not discourages use of things from the *jira-core* dependency which is where this class currently resides. In fact most of the email magic that JIRA does isn't in the API. I feel like as a developer  I am having to either depend on the jira-core and non @PublicAPI parts which doesn't appear to be a good idea for good reasons; or re-invent the wheel. \n\nI would love to be able to send emails using JIRA that actually already look like normal JIRA emails and use the *CSSInliner* class correct _which is not in JIRA API either_.

For example, a tech writer, a web developer, a QC, instructional designer, etc. (This is not defined at the project level, but at the issue level). \n\nWhen using commenting to @mention we almost always have to look under the \"People\" area  in the issue and see who all the people are on the issue, and then tag them individually with with @mentions. (Using \"watch\" is not feasible, it generates far too many emails and is not used, plus, there isn't a separate possibility to simply @mention watchers, now is there?)\n\nCommentary on Atlasssian and the Usefulness of Voting\nOf course, I now realize that no matter how many votes a suggestion gets here, it stands about as a great a chance of being implemented in Jira as a flea bench lifting a car, but we have to keep trying, eh? Just look at the top voted issues here, and you'll see the the majority of them have been poo-poo'd by Atlassian. This doesn't build customer confidence in your ability to democratically gather feedback. But there's always a glimmer of hope, after voting for many of the most popular suggestions here, 1 of them actually went into production! Hooray!  ",

Problem\nCurrently, if administrators install plugins during a peak period, when many users are active on the instance, it may have severe impact on performance and even accessibility of core functionality.\n\nThe reason for this partly is having related caches reset globally, which can be a cascade operation, not only affecting the caches related to the very plugin being upgraded, but others dependent on it. This may have the effect of the instance being locked up for 10+ minutes even, depending on the number of active user sessions and the caches affected\n\nh4. Workaround\nBased on the facts above, we suggest not to implement major configuration changes during peak-hours. Make sure to schedule such major changes to off-peak hours (overnight or during weekend), when user activity on the instance is minimal.\n\nh4. Proposed solution\nOne possible solution would be to block/reject incoming user requests during plugin installation/upgrade, to have the impacted period around 30s instead of minutes.",

Find that, 2 dimensional gadget filter forgets it filter settings and fall back to user default .. Pls find below for more details\n\n\nWe have discovered what we believe is a 100% repro bug with the actual Atlassian JIRA Gadgets \u201cIssue Statistics\u201d & \u201cTwo Dimensional Filter Statistics\u201d gadgets for Dashboards.  Essentially, if you drill-down using the gadgets from the Dashboards (Snip It 1 below - which is surely the intended user path) both gadgets forget their Filters and just enter a basic Search query to return the results.  Thus, each User sees the results in a search and it returns just their local \u201ccolumns\u201d JIRA settings within their view.  This means the order and fields meant to be displayed by the various Filters driving these gadgets by the creators of the Dashboards at Admin level or User level are lost.  \n\nAlso, if you fix it at local level it\u2019s OK provided the User is only accessing one JIRA project on their PC, as if you locally select the correct fields (columns) for one Gadget / Filter, the order then applies to other projects as it\u2019s your local setting, which may not be using the same fields and the Dashboards as they may be showing data for completely different things.  I\u2019ve repro\u2019d this too; Snip It 2 below.\n\nChris helped isolate the reason being that the drill-down was losing association with the Filter on these 2 gadgets.\n\nAs these gadgets are both very useful we will try to raise a request with Atlassian themselves to address; David is doing this.  Just wanted to make you aware in case other teams raise this issue as I spent considerable time trying to resolve as I thought it was something we\u2019d done wrong within our project/dashboards.\n\nIf however someone knows another way to ensure Users can see the intended field settings when using these Gadgets, please let us know.\n\nregards\n\nAndy\n\nSnip It 1 (Illustration):  clicking on any of the blue links to drill-down loses the field settings in the search results.\n\n \n\nSnip It 2 (Illustration):  Drill-down has forgotten the Filter and returned a Search, picking up Users JIRA settings and returning fields not applicable to that specific Filter or Project:\n\n\n \n\n\nKindly let me know if you need more information on this \n\nThanks & Regds\n\nSandeep Radhakrishnan Warrier\n",

Message rejected.\n{code}\nThis error obviously makes sense because the user does not have permissions to create issues. But we should allow the option to fall back to using the Default Reporter configured in the mail handler, so theres still an option of creating issues here. \nTechnically, the user doesn't have permission to create issues directly in JIRA, but at least have the option of doing it through mail. \n\nh3. Suggested Solution\nA Toggle functionality in the mail handler to choose between:\n# Ignore default reporter and prevent issue creation if email is from a user with no Create Issue permission.\n# Allow issue to use default reporter and be created in JIRA. \n \nh3. Workaround \n\"Trick\" jira into thinking these users are anonymous users, (so it will fall back to Default Reporter), e.g. by changing their email addresses in JIRA to a different email. This of course has implications e.g. no notifications can then reach these users. ",

This would allow us to expose the least amount of information to the public as possible, while still allowing our employees to access the information behind the firewall over an obscure port.  If the connector listening on for example  port 9111 could then connect on localhost for the API, this would help us to not have to expose the entire API and only the connector necessary for the mobile application.

Problem Definition\nOn a JIRA screen with tabs, switching to a Custom screen removes the tabs. \n\nh3. Steps to reproduce : \n# Create a JIRA screen with tabs\n# Open the screen \n# The tabs are showing up on the screen.\n# Now click on the \"Configure Fields\" button and select the 'Custom' link \n# As soon as the custom link is selected, the tabs will disappear.\n\nh3. Suggested Solution\nAllow users to see tabs when using a Custom configuration for fields (e.g. either making them visible by default or providing a checkbox to make tabs visible).\n\nh3. Workaround \nIt is possible to configure field visibility for selected users using third party plugins such as the Behaviours functionality from [ScriptRunner for JIRA|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.onresolve.jira.groovy.groovyrunner]. However, this requires the intervention of a JIRA admin.",
