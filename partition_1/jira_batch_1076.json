So let's say I create a model for iteration one and start working on a model for iteration 2 based on model from iteration 1 and user stories for iteration2. Then we decide to move a user story from iteration 2 to iteration 1, so I change the model for iteration 1 respectively, and system automatically adds these changes to iteration 2, so I don't have to edit model twice for 2 iterations.\r\nThen we would be able to link model elements(diagrams, UML elements such as components, classes, use cases, etc) and issues. Right now you can only create unrelated diagrams and link them to issues with extensions like SmartDraw:\r\n!https://i.imgur.com/Y9xNuUt.png!\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nBut that's far from actual modeling because you can't actually create full models and link work items to components of the solution model.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think about this idea?",
