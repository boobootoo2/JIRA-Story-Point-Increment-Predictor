      "description": "From previous correspondance with Conor MacNeill:\r\n\r\n>\r\n > Does not cope well with branch/tag deletions\r\n >\r\n > One of the operations which regularly causing blocking of repository\r\n > scanning is the removal of branches or tags within a Subversion\r\n > repository.\r\n > I don't know why this is the case - I opened a query with Cenqua about\r\n > this - they weren't actually able to tell me the answer as to why it takes\r\n > so long.\r\n\r\nFrom an external view, a Subversion respository can appear huge. i.e. \r\n if you performed an svn listing (ls) on the root of a Subversion \r\n repository, which contains 10 branches and 100 tags, the repository will \r\n appear to be about 111 times its actual size. This is not a problem for \r\n Subversion itself, internally, as its access is predominantly sequential \r\n (with respect to the directory hierarchy). As it navigates a path, it \r\n can follow copy links - so called cheap copies. As an indexer, FishEye's \r\n access to the directory hierarchy is predominantly \"random access\". \r\n Searching with FishEye would be more difficult if it were navigating the \r\n directory hierarchy sequentially.\r\n\r\nWe are actively researching whether we can take advantage of \"cheap \r\n copy\" style linking within FishEye's index to better handle the way \r\n Subversion works. In other word, we do recognize the problem and we are \r\n working on solutions.\r\n\r\nOne of the approaches taken within FishEye to mitigate the problem is to \r\n recognize tags as such and to tag the original file's entry in the \r\n FishEye index. Effectively the tagged directory hierarchy is virtualized \r\n by tagging the entries for the source of the tag. This keeps the size of \r\n the FishEye index down significantly but does mean that FishEye needs to \r\n know when a copy represents a tagging operation.\r\nh3. Workarounds:\r\n # [Add exclude rules|https://confluence.atlassian.com/fisheye/include-exclude-paths-960155516.html#IncludeExcludepaths-AddinganExclude] in order to make Fisheye ignore the paths from the branches and tags that have been deleted.\r\n # Set a\u00a0[start revision|https://confluence.atlassian.com/fisheye/configuring-repository-details-960155509.html#Configuringrepositorydetails-ConfiguringtheSCMdetailsforarepository]\u00a0to start indexing from a particular revision.\r\n # Split a single large repository into logical components (e.g., by project or by product).\r\n # Change the repository definition so as to look at a subset of your repository by setting [a path|https://confluence.atlassian.com/fisheye/configuring-repository-details-960155509.html] within your repository that you wish Fisheye to index.\r\n # After trying one or more of the suggestions above, saving changes and exiting the repository administration panel a modal window will be presented saying that the repository needs to re-indexed for changes to take effect, and offering two options:\r\n ** {{*Perform now*}} will immediately erase the repository cache indexed thus far and will start re-indexing the repository from scratch.\r\n ** {{*Ignore*}} will keep everything indexed thus far, but you need to [stop and start|https://confluence.atlassian.com/fisheye/managing-your-repositories-960155450.html] the affected repository to make Fisheye ignore the excluded paths from now onwards.\r\n # As a general advice, you could benefit from a way faster indexing speed by using file protocol instead of HTTP / HTTPS for connecting to the repository. According to the [Best Practices|https://confluence.atlassian.com/fisheye/best-practices-subversion-integration-960155709.html] document, HTTP and HTTPS are the slowest protocols. You can switch to file protocol by either:\r\n ** [Migrating Fisheye|https://confluence.atlassian.com/fisheye/migrating-fisheye-between-servers-960155799.html] to the server where Subversion is installed, or\r\n ** Using the [svnsync|http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/subversion/trunk/notes/svnsync.txt] utility to mirror the remote repository onto the server where Fisheye is installed.\r\n # The most important aspect for a large-repository deployment will be disk I/O speed. You definitely want a fast local HDD for Fisheye's cache. Note that NFS and SAN are [not supported|https://confluence.atlassian.com/fisheye/supported-platforms-960155252.html]. Perform the [disk access speed test|https://confluence.atlassian.com/kb/test-disk-access-speed-for-jira-server-performance-troubleshooting-818577561.html] and compare your benchmarks with the table shown in the section\u00a0*Grading the Results*\u00a0from that document in order to make sure that the HDD speed on the Fisheye server is at least OK for all file operations.",

Is there any technical reason why this could not be implemented, or is it just that you haven't added this feature yet ? If this was done, then the review process would be exactly same as if I had committed the change and then your product created its own diff using latest repository revision, compared with previous revision in repo.\r\n\r\nThe reason why we don't want to commit changes until they are reviewed is that often an engineer makes some changes and when they are reviewed it turns out that many changes are required, and sometimes a complete re-write. In these case if we committed each change before review it would create a mess in the repository which will make it harder to use when we want to check old revisions.\r\n\r\nC/o Tim Alsop",

If FishEye is a \"read only\" tool, could you\r\nplease point me to such a pre-commit hook for subversion which I can use?

However, \"p4 print\" is a latency and not bandwidth sensitive operation, and it almost always makes sense to perform these with some degree of parallelism. But it's necessary for FishEye to index a p4d running over a high-latency WAN.\r\n\r\nOne way to see precisely how bad things can be is to try to index a Perforce repository on a proxy on a WAN (London-->Hong Kong) link, where the proxy isn't hot:\r\n\r\nFishEye --> Local p4p --> Remote p4d\r\n\r\nIf the p4p is cold, it looks like what's happening is that FishEye is running a bunch of \"p4 print\" operations in series, each of which is quite synchronous and thus latency sensitive (in our case we have more than enough bandwidth to spare). So while you get some minor speedup on a local server at the expense of thrashing your FishEye and P4 installations, you would get MASSIVE performance benefits out of parallelizing the \"p4 print\" operations to some extent.\r\n\r\nThis was originally raised as a comment on FE-122 due to a misunderstanding of what that issue really meant.",
