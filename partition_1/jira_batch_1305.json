[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-6402].\n  {panel}\n\nThis is a big wish, I've broken it down into subsections.\n\n== Root Cause ==\n\nWe currently use two systems for managing issues with our customers, and our products. We use Jira on the \"project management\" side of things (assigning and tracking issues, release management, ie: your classic Jira usage). We also use a trouble-ticket system (OTRS http://otrs.org/) to handle all our incomming \"support\" email.\n\nThere is some overlap between these two systems: basically, we will often have a support email that we want to turn into a bug or feature request. In this case, we manually create a JIRA and say \"see ticket number 1234\".\n\nSince there is *some* overlap, we (of course) wish that it was just the one tool.\n\n== The Wish ==\n\nThis wish comes in 3 parts:\n\n1) intelligent inbound email processing\nJIRA does most of this already, but for completeness:\na) thread tracking (OTRS does this by prepending a [TICKETNUMBER] to the subject field in replies, which is entirely adequate).\nb) inbound sorting: sort email into different queues (projects?) based on header info (specifically the To field) . It is not enough to sort on the pop account, as we have multiple email aliases mapped to the same pop box.\n\n2) outbound email\nA way of being able to reply to a \"thread\" and have the email sent to the originator of the ticket. We don't want to create real jira users for all of email correspondants. As I write that, I'm imagining a special kind of issue-type, where I can \"reply\" similar to \"add comment\" but I also have To, CC, Subject fields, etc.\n\n3) ticket management, escalation\nA good ticketing system should *force* you not to forget to reply to unanswered email, so alerts and escalations are a must. OTRS has this feature where it won't show you the inbound queues unless you answer the escalated emails first. (This is both painful and desired :| )\n\nand a 4th sneaky wish:\n4) all this should be built into jira so I don't have to faf around writing plugins :D\n\n\n== Misc ==\n\nI can't make up my mind if this functionality would be easy to add to JIRA or not.\n\nI have this feeling that the ticket \"queues\" are different to a JIRA \"project\". Or at least, I can seem myself changing the project of a ticket quite often (as customers sometimes send emails to the strangest of email addresses).\n\nI was finally prompted to raise a JIRA for this feature after reading http://weblogs.asp.net/ericjsmith/archive/2005/04/12/400011.aspx\n\n(This issue could be attached to JRA-2326)\n\n",

It seems like quite a limitation because typically a workflow is updated to suit a company's process and in that scenario a custom field is likely to be used.\n\nI appreciate that I could write custom Java code for this but that's a level of effort I can't make at this point in time.

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-6374].\n  {panel}\n\nI need to be able to separate admin permissions within JIRA.  For example, there is the global admin permissions which allows you to do anything in JIRA.  However, I'd like to have a permission role that would allow specified users to create new projects.  Currently, the only way to do this is to grant that user full global permissions.  We have several project managers that need to be able to create projects and be able to fully administer these projects without having global permissions.",

Depending on the notification scheme in place, some individuals will get an email containing that comment. If one of those users reply to that email, that message is then viewable by all, which may or may not be expected.\n\nWhat if there was an admin option to enable \"plus addressing\". Normally a comment would be emailed with the sender of jira@example.org. If there was this \"plus addressing\" option, and if a comment was created with visibility restricted to the \"dev\" group, then what if the sender became jira+dev@example.org? Then if a recipient replies, and assuming the JIRA email plugin knew how to parse plus addresses, this email comment would be posted with visibility restricted to the \"dev\" group like the original was. That way information doesn't leak out unexpectedly.\n\nI guess an altnernative method might be to somehow contain the group info in the Subject line, as in [JIRA-1010:dev]. Though, the plus addressing seems cooler. ;-)\n\n",

Namely, the ability to send an issue notification email to one or more users. \n\nFor example, if I want to get input on an issue from someone other than the reporter or assignee I have to either send them an email to them and reference the Jira issue, put the person on as a watcher, or assign the issue to the person. \n\nWhat would be preferrable would be the ability to send an inquiry / comment to a specific user such that the assignee does not change and that person does not now have to remove themselve from a watch.\n\nAnother motivation for this functionality is the use case where an assignee needs input from multiple other users. Currently in our organization, people tend to use assignment as a way of getting input to an issue. \n\nThe problem with this approach is that it turns what could be a parallel process in to a serial process. For example, if I need to get input from three people and use assignment as the way of getting their input in to the issue the input requires assigning the issue 6 times along with the latency for each step.",

Your feedback is key to helping us understand how you use JIRA so we can continue improving your experience. We have reviewed this issue over the last few days; unfortunately we don't have any plans to support this in JIRA for the foreseeable future.\n\nPlease remember that jira.atlassian.com is one of many inputs for the JIRA roadmap. You can [learn more about our process here|https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/110373/how-does-the-jira-team-use-jira-atlassian-com].\n \nI understand that our decision may be disappointing. Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.\n \nRegards,\nDave Meyer\ndmeyer@atlassian.com\nProduct Manager, JIRA Platform\n{panel}\n\nh3. *Original request description*\nIn certain circumstances, it would be useful if JIRA's email notifications included attachments, and a new \"Attachment added\" notification existed to notify users of attachments made to a page (and mail them the added attachment).  Whether to mail attachments should be a per-user option. \n\nh3. *Workaround*\nThere are some third-party plugins that allows users to embed attachment file into the email notification, please refer to the following Answer Threads:\n* https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/12277565/sending-attachments-through-service-desk - [Enterprise Mail Handler for JIRA|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.javahollic.jira.jemh-ui/cloud/overview]\n* https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/9371717/how-do-i-include-attachments-in-jira-notification-emails - [ScriptRunner for JIRA|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.onresolve.jira.groovy.groovyrunner/server/overview]",

Your feedback is key to helping us understand how you use JIRA so we can continue improving your experience. We have reviewed this issue over the last few days; however there are not currently any plans to implement this suggestion.\n\nIf issue locking is critical for your environment, there are alternatives;\n* [JIRA-Issue-Edit-Lock|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/net.koncis.atlassian.jira-issue-edit-lock].\n* There's also a non-supported plugin which may solve your immediate needs: [whoslookin|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.atlassian.jira.plugins.whoslookin]. This add-on is 6.x compatible and we're looking at the effort required to make this 7.x compatible. There is now also a cloud version of this plugin: [whoslookin for cloud|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/whoslooking-connect/cloud/overview]\n \nPlease remember that jira.atlassian.com is one of many inputs for the JIRA roadmap. You can [learn more about our process here|https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/110373/how-does-the-jira-team-use-jira-atlassian-com].\n \nI understand that our decision may be disappointing. Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.\n \nRegards,\noruettinger@atlassian.com\nPrincipal Product Manager, JIRA\n\n{panel}\n\n\\\\\n\n*Original description below:*\nThis can be implemented in 2 stages:\n\n1. A simpler approach that detects that an issue has been edited and displays an error message informing the user of this fact. For example, a user clicks edit issue and takes their time to update a few fields. Another user updates the issue in the mean time. When the first user presses \"Update\" they will be returned to the Edit Issue screen with all the fields populated with values that were submitted by the user. The screen will display an error message informing the user than an issue has changed. The error message will also contain a link that will open a new browser window displaying the issue as it appears currently.\n\nThe user will be able to compare the issue using the View Issue screen in the second browser window and the Edit Issue screen. The system will not provide an indication on what fields are \"clashing\". The Edit Issue screen will contain a confirm button, that when pressed will do the check again, to ensure the issue has not changed since, and if it has not, will update the issue.\n\nIssues will also be checked for updates during Bulk Edit operation. The Bulk Edit operation will not update any issues that have been updated in the mean time and will inform the user about these issues. (The user will then be able to bulk edit those issues if required).\n\nWhen an issue is being progressed through workflow (e.g Resolved, Closed) a check will also be performed. If the issue has been changed the user will be informed of this fact. If the Workflow Transition that the user is trying to perform is still available the user will be provided with a link that will open the View Issue screen in another browser window. The user will be able to confirm that they would like to proceed. If the workflow operation is no longer available, the user will be asked to return to the View Issue screen.\n\nWe estimate the effort required to implement the above functionality to be around 80 man hours (or 2 man weeks).\n\n2. The second approach takes the \"issue locking\" functionality a bit further and when a clash is detected during the Edit Issue stage, the user is presented with a page that shows the conflicts. The page shows the fields that are \"different\" in value between the current issue and the values that are being submitted by the user. For each \"clashing\" field the issue's current field value is shown as well as the submitted value. For each field the user will be able to specify the value that they actually would like to go ahead with and then proceed with the update.\n\nThe Bulk Edit will still leave modified issues untouched and will simply report them, just like in the first approach.\n\nProgressing issue through workflow will use the Edit Issue's approach and show a conflict resolution screen if the workflow transition is still available.",

Your input in the comments helps us understand how this affects you and what you're hoping to accomplish with JIRA.\n\nAt this time, this suggestion is not on the JIRA development roadmap. Please remember that jira.atlassian.com is one of many inputs for the JIRA roadmap. You can [learn more about our process here|https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/110373/how-does-the-jira-team-use-jira-atlassian-com].\n\nI understand that our decision may be disappointing. Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.\n\nRegards,\nDave Meyer\n[dmeyer@atlassian.com|mailto:dmeyer@atlassian.com]\nProduct Manager, JIRA Platform\n{panel}\n\nRight now it appears that the Assign Permission is all or nothing.\n\nWe would like force the \"Assign To\" functionality to limit the list of users to only be in the user group defined.\nThus, if the workflow step defined assigning to a developer, the user list will only display the list of developers.  If the workflow step is to assign to a QA Engineer, the QA Engineer would only have assign-permission to assign to another QA Engineer.\n",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-6051].\n  {panel}\n\nHello, I'm Koen Renders from CIPAL in Belgium (one of your all-day users of Jira Enterprise).\n\nWe're now preparing to migrate to version 3.1. We're very happy with the workflow-option that is now available in JIRA. Great job.\n\nWe have a suggestion/question with this workflow: at this moment it's possible to select:\n\n* or you go directly to the next step\n* whether you want to select a new assignee\n* or you want to select a resolution (when closing an issue).\n\nWould it be possible to select the option \"log work\"? When selecting this option a user must enter his work (he can adjust the estimate etc.) for the step he comes from.\n\nFor us it may also be an option for the complete workflow (so you must enter it with every transition). Just an idea.\n\nThe result gets then:\n\n* analysing         Koen Renders            4 hours\n* programming       Alain Conings           3 days\n* testing           Alien Wouters           4 hours\n* documenting       Sindy Lenaerts          2 hours\n\nThanks.",

While this works (apparently due to bug JRA-5743), it doesn't allow the user additional access to the issue over time through the web interface. What we would like is an additional option on the Issue Security Scheme to support allowing anyone marked as a watcher of an issue to be able to be in a security level.\n\nThe particular use case is:\n- User submits a \"help desk\" request. This goes to the \"Help Desk\" project\n- The Help Desk project has a \"Reporters and Developers\" issue security system\n- Developer realizes that this requires development (rather than just a quick fix) and is already being tracked by an issue in the \"Core\" project\n- Developer marks the \"Help Desk\" issue as a duplicate of the \"Core\" issue and makes the original reporter of the \"Help Desk\" issue a watcher on the \"Core\" issue\n- From here, while the reporter would otherwise not be able to see anything in the \"Core\" project, because a developer has made him watch that issue, he should be able to see it.\n\nThis was originally tracked in the Atlassian support system as JSP-864.",

Your input in the comments helps us understand how this affects you and what you're hoping to accomplish with JIRA.\n\nAt this time, this suggestion is not on the JIRA development roadmap. Please remember that jira.atlassian.com is one of many inputs for the JIRA roadmap. You can [learn more about our process here|https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/110373/how-does-the-jira-team-use-jira-atlassian-com].\n\nI understand that our decision may be disappointing. Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.\n\nRegards,\nDave Meyer\n[dmeyer@atlassian.com|mailto:dmeyer@atlassian.com]\nProduct Manager, JIRA Platform\n{panel}\n\nSummary:\n  Version Control File Attachments\n\nOverview:\n  I suggest that JIRA should store multiple versions of a file attachment.   When users attach a file of the same name as an existing file, the new file is accepted and previous versions stored.  Users can download an either version, delete individual versions, or delete the whole file object (all versions).\n\nJustification:\n  Although JIRA may be considered a bug tracking system, it's often used as a Project Managment tool.  Our current process defines an elaborate change request process, the outcome of which is a word document.  (Personally, I prefer a web form like this!)  And, as in so many things, the spec changes 1/2 way through the project.  The spec document itself is in some CMS, but we always attach it to the root incident for a project for handy reference.  \n  Sometimes early decisions can only be explained in context of the previous version of the spec.  Having both handy in JIRA would be a time saver.  Linking to the CMS is another approach, but there are many version of the document as it changes and before it gets turned over to development.\n  Although JIRA is not a replacement for a version control or content management system, this feature request seems to track when JIRA is used to consolidate project information.\n\nPossible future directions:\n  Allow saving a new version with webdav.\n\nDependencies:\n  In my opinion it's acceptable to require a CVS backend for this functionality.  Preferred would be to store in the JIRA tables.\n\nThanks,\nDarren.\n\n\n",

It disappers from the \"Open Isues\" summary on the project screen and the issue will display as green in the progress status bar of the Roadmap. I assume this is because the issue has had a resilution entered.\n\nThere are a number of ways JIRA could be improbved to cater for this.  One possibility is to specify whether the step is Open or Closed when setting up the workflow.  This would mean that the current default JIRA workflow will behave as it currently does.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

So, if you want to create a \nprivate sub-task, that is not accessible by your customers, you have \nto first create a sub-task that is automatically private, hence\ngenerating an automatic eMail notification of your customer. Then, \nyou have to edit the sub-task to change the security level.\n\nWouldn't it be more efficient to let the user choose the security level\nwhen creating the sub-task?\nOr could we have special security levels for different types of sub-tasks.\nE.g. create a sub-task \"private sub-task\" that automatically relates to\na certain security level \"private\".\n\n(Just to explain: We are using Jira Enterprise 3.0.3 to track new \nfeatures. It is used by us and our clients. When a new feature issue is\ncreated, we put several development/private sub-tasks under it, to\nsplit work for one feature or to assign private work that has to\nbe done in order to build the new feature. But we do not want our\ncustomer to see, what is going on \"behind the scenes\".)",

Your feedback is key to helping us understand how you use JIRA so we can continue improving your experience. We have reviewed this issue over the last few days; however there are not currently any plans to implement this suggestion.\n\nWhen we've discussed archiving with our customers we've generally found that the number one reason customers want archiving is to *improve instance performance*. Customers usually also want to;\n* de-clutter \nand\n* need to keep the archived records for traceability/audit compliance reasons\nHowever these two reasons are much lower priority secondary and tertiary needs.\n\nWe knew that we could make a bigger impact on performance by working on JIRA's performance directly instead of delivering an archiving capability. Hence we focused our resources on that since June last year. This is why [we were able to ship a significant performance improvement with JIRA6.4|https://confluence.atlassian.com/enterprise/scaling-jira-461504619.html] and we've continued improving performance since.\n\nThe effort required to make these performance improvements directly in JIRA are less costly than developing an archival solution. In addition the performance gains we've since delivered and have broader performance benefits for all users regardless of their issue/project count. We will continue to focus on improving performance as one of our highest priorities and therefore do not currently have plans to implement archiving.\n\nIf you are experiencing performance issues you can also look at our [scaling guide|https://confluence.atlassian.com/enterprise/scaling-jira-461504619.html] that gives some insight into all the factors that affect performance. i.e. you may also want to look at reducing instance complexity by doing things such as; reducing the number of custom fields, reducing the number of workflows, permission schemes and other JIRA configuration.\n \nPlease remember that jira.atlassian.com is one of many inputs for the JIRA roadmap. You can [learn more about our process here|https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/110373/how-does-the-jira-team-use-jira-atlassian-com].\n\n \nI understand that our decision may be disappointing. Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.\n \nRegards,\nOtto Ruettinger\nPrincipal Product Manager, JIRA\noruettinger (at) atlassian (dot) com\n{panel}\n\n*Original request description:*\n\nWe would like to have the ability to archive old issues. We currently have an installation of JIRA (3.0.3) that has grown to 50,000 + issues. Out of these, about 35k are closed issues. We would like to be able to remove these issues from the database so that our installation has a smaller amount of issues. As an example, all issues that are more than 90 days old would be removed from the database, but they would still be useful for a Knowledge Base.\n\nTo summarise, a feature that would remove or export issues (with comments) of certain age would be very useful.",

Your feedback is key to helping us understand how you use JIRA so we can continue improving your experience. We have reviewed this issue over the last few days.\n\nThe Field Required Validator for workflow transitions\u00a0*has been incorporated into JIRA Cloud* as a native feature. For JIRA Cloud customers, we recommend using this validator as the most direct way to resolve this use case.\n\nFor *JIRA Server* customers, the validator is still available by installing the JIRA Suite Utilities plugin, which is [free and available on the Atlassian Marketplace|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.googlecode.jira-suite-utilities/server/overview].\n\nPlease don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or feedback.\n\nRegards,\n Dave Meyer\n dmeyer@atlassian.com\n Product Manager, JIRA Platform\n{panel}\n*Original request description:*\n\nThe reporter can not add an issue when he has no resolve permissions and the \"fixed Version\" field is a required field.\n\nAs a JIRA Administrator I want a \"Fixed version\" to be a required field when resolving. But it seems illogical that someone reporting an issue should enter the field. This applies to other fields as well.\nh3. Workaround\n\nThe [JIRA Suite Utilities|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.googlecode.jira-suite-utilities] provides a [fields required validator|https://jsutil.atlassian.net/wiki/display/JSUTIL/JIRA+Suite+Utilities+Workflow+Validators#JIRASuiteUtilitiesWorkflowValidators-FieldsRequiredValidator] that can be configured to set fields required on specific transitions.",

We highly value your feedback in all forms, and through suggestions in jira.atlassian.com is not different. We use this channel often to learn the best we can with how customers use JIRA and how we can continue to improve the experience for as many users as possible.\n\nWe have revisited this issue again recently and wanted to reiterate that there are still currently no plans to implement this suggestion, and it is not currently on any JIRA team\u2019s roadmap at this stage. \n\nPlease remember that jira.atlassian.com is one of many inputs for the JIRA roadmap. You can [learn more about our process here|https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/110373/how-does-the-jira-team-use-jira-atlassian-com].\n\nI understand that our decision may be disappointing. Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.\n\n\nRegards,\nKerrod Williams\nKerrod (dot) Williams (at) atlassian (dot) com\nProduct Manager, JIRA\n\n{panel}\n\nOne of the configuration difficulities with JIRA and it's 'silo' project structure is how mapping/coordinating across multiple projects is very troublesome.\n\nOne Example of this are an enterprise software product where individual modules are mapped onto projects yet the product as a whole has no central control point. \n\nAnother example is a consulting organization working on several different projects with the same client, or one project with multiple deliverables.\n\nOne fix for this would be to extend the categorizations available for individual projects onto project categories - essentially nesting projects - where each individual project has it's versions and components yet the project category can have a overall view of deliverables.\n\nSuch a feature would quickly create demand for 'views' similiar to those available for JIRA projects today - roadmaps, issues by user, filtering by category, etc.\n\n ",

(the condition is that a selected field must be entered prior to executing that transition.\n\nUnfortunately, now when the user hits the prior step and the field is blank, they simply don't see the option of executing that transition. There's no way for them to tell why.\n\nWhat I'd like to see is when configuring a condition, to have the ability to type a value into a \"why\" field; if that field is blank (which it would be by default) everything would work as today and the user wouldn't see the transition link. If the field was populated, the transition link would appear but the field would either be disabled with hovertext containing the \"why\" messages collected from the various conditions that said no, or the link would be enabled but would cause a popup window with the \"why\" messages",

For Example:\n3.0 (Version)\n   |_ 3.0 RC1 (Release)\n   |_ 3.0 RC2 (Release)\n   |_ 3.0 Final (Release)\n\nThis would enable logging issues against the release (1.0 RC1 etc) rather than the version and still be able to generate release notes for the version which would include all issues logged againts all releases for the version.\n\nThis would also be helpful for using JIRA for planning. You could schedule each release and track progress by release. You should be able see overall progress for the version as well.",

However, there should also be other JIRA export files that quickly showcases the full feature set of JIRA and/or alternative uses for JIRA. Some example imports could be:\n\n* JIRA Enterprise MAX - An import with all features utilised with some sample data to make meaningful reports (work load etc)\n* JIRA Support - Using JIRA as a support tool, not just an issue tracker\n* JIRA Workflow - Using JIRA as a workflow manager. (eg Cases instead of Issue) \n\nI think this will require changes to the import to allow for import files with no license (user would need to get their own trial license).",
