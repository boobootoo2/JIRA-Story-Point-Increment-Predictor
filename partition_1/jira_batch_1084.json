Current implementation isn\u2019t based on REST API consumer, it is based on concurrent requests made across all consumers of single tenant - consider tenant users, your App and other Apps accessing the infrastructure. Thus it is a challenge to provide meaningful, guaranteed information for consumer in response headers (e.g. Retry-After), such information could be seen only as a suggestion.\r\n\r\nIn case of implementing retries please be advised of using back-off mechanism to lower retry frequency on subsequent failed attempts and increase traffic gradually on a success. Concurrency based limiting is more visible for longer requests so the rule of thumb would be the longer request is the lower concurrency should be used.\r\n\r\nWe are actively working on per consumer rate limiting which should help us provide meaningful information in response headers. We expect it to be delivered in couple of quarters.\r\n\r\nWith regard to this issue we\u2019ll fix it by not returning 500 and provide suggestion (as described above) when retry may happen.\r\n{panel}\r\nh3. Summary\r\n\r\nCalling search or other REST API endpoints might return status code 500 instead of status code 429 when the error {{FATAL: too many connections for role...}} is logged.\r\n\r\nSometimes other random status codes like 503, 400 or 403 are returned for the same root-cause.\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Send REST APIs calls (in example the Search endpoint was used) in continuous succession\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nIf the rate limit is hit, the status 429. Throttling limit state should be returned in headers like\u00a0[here|https://developers.trello.com/docs/rate-limits]\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nDifferent status codes including 500, 503, 400 and 403 are returned instead.",

Summary\r\n\r\nThis is not replicable on every instance.\r\n\r\nIn some cases, we cannot delete parent issues when they have sub-tasks with resolutions. \r\n\r\nIn the old issue view, Jira will show a successful message saying the ticket was deleted, but it's not. If you were previously on a page listing the issue, you may be redirected to it again and the issue may not be there, but refreshing the page reveals it. It still exists.\r\n\r\nIn the new issue view, you'll see this error:\r\n{code}\r\nWe couldn't delete <issue key>\r\n\r\nCheck your connection, then give it another try.\r\n\r\nTry again\r\n{code}\r\n!error.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Create a project (has been tested with Kanban and business). Make sure it has a sub-task type\r\n# Create a ticket and a sub-task to it\r\n# Close the sub-task, adding a resolution to it\r\n# Try to delete the *parent*\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nThe parent is deleted\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nThe behavior described above is seen. The tickets are not deleted. \r\nIf the parent had sub-tasks without resolution, some of these may have been deleted.\r\n\r\nh3. Note\r\nThe problem here is the sub-task preventing the parent from being deleted. We can delete the sub-task and we can delete the parent once the sub-task is deleted. What fails is deleting the parent while the sub-task is there.\r\n \r\nIn original testing, closed sub-task without resolution were also causing this, but with a different error in UI (same errors in logs). However, in recent testing, we could only replicate with sub-tasks with resolutions.\r\n\r\nh3.Workaround\r\nDelete all sub-tasks with resolutions first.",

Don\u2019t worry: this feature is a priority, and we\u2019re working hard to make sure it\u2019s released as fast as possible. In the meantime, some of these actions are available as keyboard shortcuts (from the nav, go to !https://pf-emoji-service--cdn.us-east-1.prod.public.atl-paas.net/atlassian/question_mark_64.png|width=20,height=20! > *Keyboard shortcuts*), and for now, you can still [temporarily click through to the old view|https://support.atlassian.com/jira-core-cloud/docs/temporarily-click-through-to-the-old-issue-view/] to use its dialog menu.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nAtlassian\r\n{panel}\r\nIf I press Dot \".\" and type \"Epic Link\" I don't get to enter the Epic Link.\r\n\r\nMost other capabilities within this menu are missing too, including (but not limited to):\r\n * Status transitions\r\n * Add story points\r\n * Log Time\r\n * Move\r\n * Delete",

Currently, we have a custom Narrative field, but it appears on the side with the other primary and secondary fields, and since it is usually a largish amount of text, is unusable there. Which means I have to go back to the old view where I've put the Narrative in a separate tab (next to the \"Field Tab\", whatever that means) to read and edit it.
