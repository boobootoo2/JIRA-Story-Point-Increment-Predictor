      "description": "Hi, Atlassian.\r\n\r\nI'm using SourceTree with some repos that have a very long commit history. For example, [https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core,]\u00a0which has 830,000 commits as of this writing.\r\n\r\nToday, I wanted to roll my homebrew-core repo back to mid-February. To do this, I opened up the repo (at /usr/local/Homebrew/Library/Taps/homebrew/homebrew-core on my Mac) in SourceTree, and started scrolling down the commit history by dragging the scrollbar's thumbnail (or whatever you call it) to the bottom. Each time I dragged it to the bottom, it would load some more history, and the thumbnail would jump back up a bit.\r\n\r\nHowever, this took a\u00a0_lot_ of repetitions of that scroll-to-the-bottom behavior to get all the way back to May. And each time I scrolled to the bottom, the thumbnail seemed to jump up less far in the scroll bar. I suspect this is because it was loading a fixed number of commit records (like 100 or 1,000?) each time I scrolled to the bottom.\r\n\r\nMaybe the scroll bar behavior could be adjusted so that the number of new history records it loaded upon being scrolled to the bottom could be scaled to the number of history records that are already loaded: like, if there are 10,000 records displayed, load up 1,000 more, but if I've already loaded 100,000 records, load up 10,000 more at a time (i.e. 0.1*n), at the expense of a longer delay in UI responsiveness. That would make it easier to dredge through long repo histories.\r\n\r\nThanks for your consideration!\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nAndrew",

The constraints (if you are using NSLayoutConstraints) are too grabby on that pane. If you find the right pixel to grab on the divider you can pull them apart, but nearly any movement snaps the pane shut. Since this is a very visual thing, I'm attaching a screencast that demonstrates this. It seems to apply to binary data views, not source.\r\n\r\nOr tried to: \"JIRA could not attach the file as there was a missing token.

      "description": "It would be very useful to support the display (and creation) of marks against commits.\r\n A mark is a bit like a tag, except that many commits can have the same mark; a mark is metadata concerning a commit.\r\n\r\n*Use case example, with imagined Sourcetree features:*\r\n\r\nA\u00a0user wants to be able to easily\u00a0mark\u00a0and see at a glance which commits are known to have compile issues. Similarly a mark for\u00a0the commits which are refactor only (i.e. no functional change).\r\n\r\nTo set this up in Sourcetree, the user enters a\u00a0marks setup dialog. They select \"add item\" and enter:\r\n * the text \"compile fails\"\r\n * they select a coloured shape from a choice (NB shape is for users with colour perception issues)\r\n\r\nThey hit ok, and select \"add\" again and enter:\r\n * the text \"refactor only\"\r\n * they select a (different to above) coloured shape from a choice\r\n\r\nThis entered info is optionally stored in a file in the actual repository itself, which would allow it to be shared with team members by pushing the file in usual way.\r\n\r\nNow when viewing the git history in Sourcetree, there would be a convenient way for the user to apply or remove one of the marks from selected commit(s), e.g. a pressing a number key (preferred, as is quicker) or context menu.\u00a0\r\n When a commit has one or more of the\u00a0marks applied to it, the configured coloured shapes are shown next to the commit message. Note that multiple markers can exist on same commit, hence multiple coloured shapes might be visible, and also that a many commits can have the same mark against it (which is a fundamental difference between a marker and a conventional tag).\r\n\r\nMouse-overing any\u00a0mark\u00a0for a commit pops up the definitions of the\u00a0marks against the commit.\r\n\r\n*Note:* showing of marks against commits should be presented visually in a way amenable to pre-attentive processing ([http://www.infovis-wiki.net/index.php/Preattentive_processing]), which is why I use coloured shapes in the example above.\u00a0\r\n It's important for user to easily grok the information at a glance. Showing say just the mark\u00a0names against commits, without e.g. colouring, is not desirable, since this information is not pre-attentively processed by the brain.\r\n\r\n*Note on possible implementation*\r\n\r\ngit notes seems to be an obvious way to implement this behind the scene. The single note permitted for a commit can store tags separated by some delimiter, e.g. \"mark1|mark2\"\r\n\r\nGit supports notes being pushed to the remote repo, so sharing notes with all users of a repo should be possible.\r\n\r\nThe possible downside of using git notes for this is that any other use of git notes in a repo would clash with this feature's use of git notes.\u00a0This issue could be avoided by using a different location to the default (refs/notes/commits)\u00a0for\u00a0the mark notes - see the --ref option of git notes.",

      "description": "Usually I am positive about changes of applications user interfaces but the 2.7 release has brought an objectively much worse GUI. The amount of information per pixel has significantly decreased and the UI elements proportions have broken (some have got bigger while some haven't changed):\r\n\r\n !scrnsht 2.7.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\nSome fonts and paddings have become too big. The left sidebar has also become bigger (because of the larger fonts) so the commits list got less space. It makes me expand the application window to fullscreen on my 1440x900 screen which is sad. I am not a child or an elder user, I don't need giant interfaces.\r\n\r\nThe version 2.6 fits much more text and commits on the same application window size while keeping the information well-readable:\r\n\r\n !scrnsht 2.6.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\nI believe this change is a mistake. If it is not a mistake, treat the issue as my strongly desired improvement request.\r\n",
