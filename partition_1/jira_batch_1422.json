Having sync intervals triggered at prime number intervals would reduce the likelihood that multiple directories would have their sync processes running simultaneously (since primes aren't multiples of one another), and having directories that take longer to sync run at higher intervals would afford them more time to complete.\r\n\r\nIt's entirely possible that my idea is a solution looking for a problem, but I thought it would be better to enter the ticket than not.",

Problem Definition\r\n\r\nIn order to restrict synchronisations of certain users it currently needs to be done by configuring a LDAP search filter as per [How to write LDAP search filters|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DEV/How+to+write+LDAP+search+filters]. This can get particularly complicated when multiple groups, from different DNs are involved. Please provide some functionality within the UI to only synchronise users based on different groups, for different applications.\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nThis solution mentions JIRA, however is applicable for any application integrating with Crowd.\r\n\r\n# Log into Crowd as administrator\r\n# Go to Applications and click on your JIRA application.\r\n# Click on \"Groups\"\r\nNow you should see a list of all groups that can authenticate to JIRA (I'll use my instance for example).\r\nPearson AD - PEROOT users - jira-administrators\t\r\nPearson AD - PEROOT users - jira-developers\t\r\nPearson AD - PEROOT users - jira-users\r\nPearson Crowd - external users - jira-users-ext\r\n\r\nNow, in JIRA, or in Crowd, there should be a checkbox option (it'll probably be easier to implement in JIRA, but if done in Crowd could be easily utilized by all Atlassian apps) to only sync authenticated groups.\r\n\r\nWhat this would mean is that unless the user is a part of one of the above groupings, they are not synced into JIRA. This would cut down drastically on the number of users brought in, and alleviate the issues large instances such as our own have been experiencing. JIRA would no longer be forced to bring in user information for users that cannot access JIRA.\r\n\r\nThis would drop us from 80k users, back to our 8k, while still allowing us to authenticate through Crowd, manage our groups through Crowd, and leaves (as far as I can tell) all functionality intact.",

      "description": "h3. Summary\r\n\r\nAs of Java 1.8u51+ (also 1.7.0_85+ and 1.6.0_101+) making SSL connections to an IP address is no longer allowed.  Previously the JVM would do a reverse lookup of the hostname using the IP then complete the connection using that hostname.  This was a security vulnerability because an attacker that gained control of DNS \r\ncould route traffic to their own server.  This change is a security feature of Java.\r\n\r\nWe have found there is a problem with the way Java creates LDAPS connections.  The way Socket.createSocket() is used results in an SSLSocket without the hostname set in it.  This results in use of an IP address to make the connection and since this is no longer allowed the connection fails.  We have reported this problem to Oracle and also forwarded the information to the Java security dev list: http://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/security-dev/2015-September/012845.html .\r\n\r\nBecause of this _*existing LDAPS connections are broken*_ and users from that user directory are unable to login including non-local administrators.\r\n\r\nThis will affect any customer using secure LDAP that upgrades the JVM.  Secure LDAP is very common to protect passwords on the internal network, particularly in enterprise environments.\r\n\r\nh3. Environment\r\n* Any version of Crowd using one of the noted Java versions.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Configure a user directory using a secure LDAP connection\r\n# Upgrade the JDK to a noted Java version.\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nLogins and LDAP syncs should work as normal.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nUsers will be unable to authenticate and LDAP syncs will fail.\r\n\r\nErrors like this will occur in the logs: {code:borderStyle=solid}\r\n2015-07-22 12:43:05,896 WARN  [http-bio-443-exec-1] @1SDVDDx763x1x0 XXXXX \"POST /j_stash_security_check HTTP/1.1\" c.a.s.i.s.s.PluginAuthenticationProvider Could not authenticate XXXXX; authentication by com.atlassian.stash.stash-authentication:crowdHttpAuthHandler failed\r\ncom.atlassian.stash.user.AuthenticationSystemException: The remote authentication server is not available.

Workaround\r\n\r\n(!) Only necessary if you do not upgrade your Java JDK.\r\n\r\nh5. Add JVM startup parameter {{-Djdk.tls.trustNameService=true}}\r\n\r\nThis reverts back to the older Java behavior while preserving all the other security related changes in the newer Java release.  Your LDAP data will still be encrypted.  The risk is described by Oracle in their explanation of the change at http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/8u51-relnotes-2587590.html.\r\n\r\nh5. Disable SSL check\r\n\r\n Under the LDAP connection \"Advanced Settings\" set \"Secure SSL\" to disabled*.  As stated in the UI this will disable all verification of the SSL certificate.  Your LDAP data will still be encrypted.  (!) This workaround may represent a greater vulnerability as any SSL cert could be substituted with no need to compromise a DNS server.",
