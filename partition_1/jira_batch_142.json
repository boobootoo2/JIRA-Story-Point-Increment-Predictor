In fact, it is the opposite that will occur.  The absence of the current branch's name adds to the confusion.\r\n\r\nA re-wording that improves the sentence structure and includes the name of the affected branch would afford a huge win for clarity.

For example, a feature developed in topic depends on some\r\nfunctionality which is found in next.\r\n        o---o---o---o---o master\r\n             \\\r\n              o---o---o---o---o next\r\n                               \\\r\n                                o---o---o topic\r\nWe want to make topic forked from branch master; for example, because the functionality on which topic depends was\r\nmerged into the more stable master branch. We want our tree to look like this:\r\n        o---o---o---o---o master\r\n            | \\\r\n            | o'--o'--o' topic\r\n             \\\r\n              o---o---o---o---o next\r\nWe can get this using the following command:\r\n    git rebase --onto master next topic\r\nAnother example of --onto option is to rebase part of a branch. If we have the following situation:\r\n                                H---I---J topicB\r\n                               /\r\n                      E---F---G topicA\r\n                     /\r\n        A---B---C---D master\r\nthen the command\r\n     git rebase --onto master topicA topicB\r\n would result in:\r\n                      H'--I'--J' topicB\r\n                     /\r\n                     | E---F---G topicA\r\n                     |/\r\n         A---B---C---D master\r\n This is useful when topicB does not depend on topicA.\r\n\r\n{code}",

Watch as SourceTree deletes your work without asking you first!\r\n\r\nI had expected SourceTree to copy the file from the staging index to the working tree, thus restoring the file I'd (accidentally) deleted.  I now realise my understanding of what SourceTree would do was flawed.  However it would be nice if SourceTree asked you before actually deleting your work.\r\n\r\nPlease could you add a confirmation dialog between steps 4 and 5 in the above sequence?  A simple version would be to ask:\r\n\r\n  Are you sure you want to delete XXX? Yes/No\r\n\r\nOr maybe more usefully:\r\n\r\n  Do you want to delete XXX or copy it to your working tree? Delete/Copy/Cancel\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nMark",

In SourceTree (and in FileMerge, for that matter), this character shows up as a simple space (it even messes up the Wiki formatting here...)\r\n\r\n  \ufeff     var body = document.getElementsByTagName('body')[0];\r\n\r\nHowever, in actual git diff, the differ shows the character fully and even outlines it in black:\r\n\r\n{{+  <U+FEFF>     var body = document.getElementsByTagName('body')[0];}}\r\n\r\nCatching this mistake earlier would have saved us significant time and money. Having this change would make us more comfortable with using SourceTree rather than having to double-check every commit with git diff. I'd be fine with leaving tabs, spaces, \\r and \\n as is, but invisible characters should be shown by the SourceTree differ (or at least offer an option for it).",
