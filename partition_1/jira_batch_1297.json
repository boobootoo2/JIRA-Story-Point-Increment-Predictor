I'm told that you need to redo the workflow change until all issues are converted (but if this takes 16 h everytime then it's not worth the trouble). So for everybodies sake I had to restore a backup to get everything going again.\n\nIt seems the workflow activation needs a workover to improve its speed and to ensure that nothing can interfere while it's running. \nIt seems there's a missing indirection because every issue has to be changed when the workflow changes.\nThe workflow only consists of a little amount of steps. If you put something between the issue and the workflow then you should be able to change it in a few seconds and see problems when there are missing steps that can't convert. Normally you add stuff to a workflow so there shouldn't be a need to change the issue because all the steps that where in the previous workflow are also in the new workflow\n\nAlso there is nothing in the log or on the screen that gives you an indication what's going on or wrong or if it succeeded, ...\n\nDocumentation for the prof. edition only states how to activate a workflow (It wasn't hard to adjust but is this really all, no warnings that it takes allmost a day, that other processes will interfer)",

When displaying the issue links of a parent, it says:\n\nThis issue <italics>links to issue...<italics>.\n\nThe italics part is taken from the link type, though the 'This issue' part seems to be canned. It would be neat if the 'This issue' part of the text was replaced by the actual issue type it's referring to. I think it's rare that anyone will have an issue that's actually called 'issue'. Folks might have bugs, enhancements, tasks, etc.\n\n\nThanks!\n\n\n-Matt",

However, the group browser is available only to jira-administrators. I'd like to make the Group Browser available to a wider audience without having to make that audience members of jira-administrators. Is there a way to do that? I checked the configuration options from the GUI and couldn't find anything relevant.\n\nI don't see any security risk in allowing users to browse the group lists. In fact, there is value in this. We link Jira closely with our internal documentation, and we have designated specialties (e.g. Unix, Windows, Firewalls) that link to projects and components within Jira. It's incredibly useful for my staff to know who is in a group with them on a particular specialty. For example, \"I'm in the firewall group. Who else is in the group and who is the leader?\" We put that information into the groups within Jira. It would be nice to have hyperlinks from the documentation to Jira to display the group list, and that's what I was trying to do when I found this problem. So, the feature request would be to create a group browser and then have a general option in Jira as to which groups could use that browser. In my environment, I'd permission that to all jira-users. \n",

Improvement Requests\n* Include documentation identifying which RPC modules are required and which are optional\n* Include workaround steps for the problem that occured below\n\nh4.Scenario in which this would come in handy\nA developer within our company wanted to try and create an xml-rpc client into JIRA.  He then asked the JIRA administrator to enable the RPC plugin.   At the time we were using JIRA 3.6.1 Professional, and had the RPC plugin disabled.  It was decided that we would enable this plugin during an upgrade to JIRA 3.7.2 Professional.\n\nSo after upgrading to JIRA 3.7.2 Professional (with all of our data now imported), we decided to turn on _\"Accepting remote API Calls\"_ and enable the RPC plugin according to the instructions available at http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Creating+a+XML-RPC+Client.  Not knowing what each individual module did, we decided to _disable the admin service module_ and left everything else enabled.  Screenshot shown in instructions doesn't show this module either, so thought it would be ok.  Also thought that , if anything went wrong we could just disable the entire plugin again.  However, after restarting services the {color:red}JIRA UI is no longer available.{color}  \n\nTo get our system backup we ultimately had to restore ms sql server 2000 from a clean database.  Then when the system was up, re-import all our data (which was unfortunate, since this process is very long).  It would be nice to know what the workaround for this would be, since it seems it could be manually changed in the database.   \n\nh4.Additional Testing\nTested the same set of steps on the absolutely clean installation of JIRA 3.7.2.  Same issue is reproduced:\n# Install 3.7.2\n# Enable _\"Accepting remote API Calls\"_ and enable the RPC plugin \n# Disable Admin Service Module and leave all other modules enabled\n# Restart Jira services\n# Try connecting to http://localhost<port> : {color:red} UI no longer available{color}\n",

Your input in the comments helps us understand how this affects you and what you're hoping to accomplish with JIRA.\n\nAt this time, this suggestion is not on the JIRA development roadmap. \n\nThere is a workaround, though, that might be used for the specific use case defined in the description. It involves JIRA Importers Plugin (or JIM for short), which is available for both Cloud and Server deployments of JIRA. JIM allows for issues to be imported from CSV format (also available for regular JIRA users - not only Admins) and JIM's wizard includes a step where user select the project he/she wants the issues are to be imported into. So the workaround will be to export the desired issues into CSV file using Issue Navigator and then import them back into another project using JIM.\n\nPlease remember that jira.atlassian.com is one of many inputs for the JIRA roadmap. You can [learn more about our process here|https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/110373/how-does-the-jira-team-use-jira-atlassian-com].\n\nI understand that our decision may be disappointing. Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.\n\nRegards,\nDave Meyer\n[dmeyer@atlassian.com|mailto:dmeyer@atlassian.com]\nProduct Manager, JIRA Platform\n{panel}\n\n\n*Original request description:*\n\nI'm working on rolling out JIRA to a Big 10 University in the U.S. We anticipate the potential to have hundreds or possibly thousands of projects in our installation. One of the features we are keen on being able to offer our faculty is the ability to create a series of tasks organized into milestones (versions) such as phased assignments, research projects, etc. Ideally each instructor will be able to create task collections in a \"master\" course template, and clone out entire filter sets (including relevant issues and versions) to a collection of other projects belonging to their students. At the beginning of the course, the instructor could bulk copy these assignments and tasks out to each participant student's personal time management project, and they'd each have a unique copy of the tasks, organized into version milestones. Right now, I envision this will involve the following:\n# The ability to create a project with tasks tied to given milestones. This functionality exists in the present version of JIRA (3.7.2)\n# The ability to bulk copy (clone and move) an entire project milestone, including all relevant issues, to a list of projects. This feature does not presently exist.\n# The possibility to deny the ability described in item 2 above to a specific list of users on the server.\n\nI am willing to build this custom feature myself, but will need to purchase a source license first. However, the functionality might warrant a place in the default JIRA installation.\n\nThe advantage of being able to do this in a default installation of JIRA is that it would simplify multi-project installations for all Open Source communities.\n\nEXAMPLE: all new projects need to perform basic project set-up chores (all administrivia you need to do to start an Open Source project, for example: \n* creating username on the appropriate servers, \n* setting up your ssh public keys, \n* mailing list tasks, \n* web site, \n* source repository publication, \n* adding developers and managing permissions, \n* producing unit tests, \n* documentation, \n* first release\n\nAll of these common tasks could be grouped into a \"Getting Started\" milestone that server admins could clone out to all new projects. We used to run into this problem at the CodeHaus all the time. The Apache software foundation also has a long list of things that all new projects must complete in order to become an official TLD. These tasks should be able to be auto-cloned wholesale to one or more existing projects from a master template.\n\nI think having a case study on how to tie JIRA-based task management into the traditional academic enterprise would significantly increase the academic interest in this product. I saw some other issues out there that sort of batted this concept around, but nothing definitive or even that descriptive. I can't estimate how long this might take to implement, but welcome any suggestions or feedback from the JIRA development team.",

E.g.: _\"I'm sorry. Server is down because ... Please call hot line on .....\"_.\nI known, Data for Announcement are store in database. If I Restore from backup aren't available.\n\nMay be it's reason for create \"Error Announcement banner\" and store this in property file.\n\nThanks for your comments.\n\nCheers,\nLibor",

Is this expected behavior?  If so, this is a problem when we have a number of cases that we planned to fix for one version and need to bulk change them to fix for a different version.\n\nIdeally, there should be a \"retain original values\" checkbox to allow the semantics to be either additive or replacement.\n\nThanks, Steve\n",

In our context there are tasks that have more than 50 sub-tasks inside of lot of kinds of types. \nWe suggest apply some type of filtering and ordering inside the tasks applied for sub-task associatedes.\n\nVinicius.",

By default, JIRA ignores keys that are part of URLs. This is a problem with svn/p4 plugins (see the [p4 bug|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/PERF-62], [svn bug|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/SVN-37]), where people frequently do enter the URL instead of the key.\n\nAs a workaround, we implemented a 'jira.option.ignore.url.with.key' property in jira-application.properties. If set to {{false}}, JIRA will not ignore keys in URLs. This is a workaround (undocumented at that), not a proper solution.\n\nWe need to work out a) what's wrong with just allowing keys in URLs, b) if there is a legitimate reason for not wanting that, implement a different algorithm for use in Subversion and Perforce plugins.",

Problem Definition\nWhen sending an email, it is always nice to be able to see who received it (by looking at the To: Cc: Bcc:)\n\nJIRA is sending out email notifications all the time but it is not possible to see who received them. Notification schemes and workflows can change at anytime but there is no way to look back in the history of a bug to see who got notified and when.\n\nI guess you could only see everything in context when you click on \"All\" because \"Comments\" and \"Change History\" both result in an email notification.\n\nJust an example of why this would be useful - in our company, we use JIRA like an information tool. Sometimes whilst commenting on an issue, we like to \"copy\" a few people so that they see the comment. It would be great to have this logged so we can see who actually received a notification.\n\nh3. Suggested Solution\nWithin an issue, you can see \"All\", \"Comments\", \"Work Log\", \"Change History\" and \"Version Control\". Would it be possible to add a new one called \"Notifications\"? \n\nh3. Workaround\nUse a third-party plugin which already have this feature; [Enterprise Mail Handler for JIRA|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.javahollic.jira.jemh-ui/cloud/overview]. Please refer to [Enable the Notification History Issue Tab|https://thepluginpeople.atlassian.net/wiki/display/JEMH/Enable+the+Notification+History+Issue+Tab] for more information.",

If yes, could you point me to the appropriate documentation.\n\nIs it possible for Jira to send automatic notification when a particular open issue has been inactive for a while... i.e. no comments, no work on the issue being done. For e.g. If the issue has been inactive for.. say 2 weeks (customisable) or so... an email notification is to be sent to the Assignee/Reporter that no activity has been occured for the past 2 weeks.\n\nI am happy to give more details on this.\n\nThanks,\n\nVijesh",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-11884].\n  {panel}\n\nAfter implementering Project Roles in JIRA 3.7 you have unfortunately introduced a _major_ security violation.\n\nIn earlier versions of JIRA the Administer Projects permission granted a user the right to edit a project, manage components and manage versions. In 3.7 this permission also grants the user the right to _Manage Project Role Membership._\n\nI know this is part of the idea behind introducing Project Roles. But it _must_ be possible to exclude users from this right even though they have the Administer Projects Permission. This could be done by introducing a Global Permission: \"Manage Project Role Membership\".\n\nIn our JIRA installation we have 12 JIRA administrators. The are the _only ones_ that are allowed to manage users and groups. We have a lot of Project Leads that are allowed to Administer Projects. They need to be able to manage components, versions and so on. We even have some _customers_ that are granted the Administer Projects permission because they run their own JIRA projects.\n\nThe problem that has been introduced is not so much, that a user with the Administer Projects permission can add a single user to a Project Role. I could live with that. The problem is, that they can also _add a group_. This means that a user by accident can add a wrong user to a project by giving them indirect access (via the group) without knowing it. The users with Administer Projects permissions have no way of knowing which users are in a given group. Only administrators can see this from the Group Browser.\n\nAnother is that the users can see the \"Assign Groups to Project Role\". Now the users can see all the groups in JIRA, not only the groups they are a member of. Users without the Global \"Browse Users\" permission (which also controls the ability to browse groups) should not be able to do this. In our JIRA installation groups represents customers. This means that some of our customers now can see the names of some of our other customers... not good...\n\nI urge you to fix this in a 3.7.x version a soon as possible. \n\nThanks.\n\nRegards,\nLars\n\nEdit: 2017-02-01\nh5. Slightly formalised summary\nAs Jira administrator I want to segregate two Permission: _Administer projects_ (current Permission) and _edit Roles_ (new Permission)\n* Project lead/administrator will not have ability to modify the roles (delegate permissions) but can manage their project for remaining admin functions\n",

While I have figured out how to do it in JIRA, it is a little tedious.\n\nExample: I have to manually change the file location \\\\machine\\releases\\software\\softwareversion to file://machine/releases/software/softwarelocation.  The other system (which is significantly less sophisticated than JIRA) allows me to just cut and paste \\\\machine\\releases\\software\\softwareversion and it converts it into a link that can be clicked on to go to the file location.\n\nWe really desire to replace this other system to continue our consolidation of systems so any help you could provide would be appreciated.",

If we could set the visibility of the comment to the reporter only, it will be more secure.\n\nThanks,\nC\u00e9cile",

We gave some external users read-only perms to our JIRA (like jira-users).  Discovered shortly thereafter that they were able to transition issues through their workflows.  After going through the docs, we began to worry that the only way to prevent this was to put conditions on all of the workflow steps (we have quite a few custom workflows).  We confirmed this after talking to support.\n\nThis is onerous in our particular case, as we now need to go thru the process of manually updating all of our workflows to preclude this from happening.  However, we think it illustrates an omission in the permission model.  We understand that from a technical perspective workflows are managed separately via OSWorkflow.  However, from a user/admin use case standpoint.  A 'read-only' issue should be just that and there should be a more global way to enforce this (i.e. a \"Transition Issues\" permission), as saying that 'read-only' users can't do this on every transition step is redundant.  The workflow conditions are more appropriate for 'fine-grained' checks like only 'testing' can move through this particular transition.",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-11480].\n  {panel}\n\nOne of important features of any workflow, task-management, project-management software is an alerter functionality. Currently, Jira supports only e-mail alerts, plus some 3-d party extensions are available, which are not convenient (some require a specific JDK and run as a stand-alone application, some support a specific browser only). All these alerters can be treated only as a temporary work-arounds for a native built-in http alerter, to be provided by Jira.\n\nAs Jira's client is a browser, the most natural and convenient way of getting alerts is on Jira's html pages. I'd suppose, that http alerter should comprise a listener (perhaps, the same one as for e-mail alerts will suite with minor changes?) and a client-side renderer of a dynamic html. The renderer must fetch a data from the listener every predefined period of time (configurable by a user) and place its statistics on top of currently opened Jira page. I mean that the div tag, which is supposed to be used for the rendering, must be placed in common header (a mean the leading bar on top of every page above Jira's menu or the Jira's menu itself; both have an empty space at the right side) for all Jira pages. The statistics of the http alerter should show how many new issues are available by priority, for example: New issues: 1/2/3/4 (8 total), where 1/2/3/4 - are number of issues in all priorities, starting with a highest priority. The text should be a link, which allows a user to open a filter showing all the new issues.\n\nHow long an issue should be treated as a \"new\" one and listed in the alerter statistic - this is a question. Because the http alerter should provide the same cumulative quality, which e-mail provides by means of inbox, I'd suggest, that new issues remain in the http alerter list until either they viewed in the abovementioned filter, or each one of them is opened by user (in this case issues may leave the alerter list separately). The easiest way is, of course, just to clear the alerter list every time a user clicks the alerter link. The best way is to track the newness of each issue based on whether it was actually viewed by a user or not.\n\nI think, everyone agree, that properly placed and timely alerts will make Jira much more efficient, than the static and annoying \"hit refresh yourself\" approach offered now.\n\nE-mail alerts are not convenient and involve technical overheads: they require to have and to switch to another application, they flood inbox with a lot of e-mail, which are actually not e-mails and will be deleted once a user switched back to Jira and processed corresponding issues; they lack usability overall.\n",
