However, we can't write a filter using Tempo objects.  For example, the Tempo Worklog Distribution Gadget shows graphically the results of a JIRA filter. We use one that shows all JIRA issues assigned to the current user. Unfortunately, when the ticket gets reassigned, the issue drops out of your Worklog Distribution Gadget. Similarly, if you're working on a ticket that is assigned to someone else, the issue never appears in your gadget. There doesn't seem to be a way to write a filter that shows all issues that you've set a worklog on. And this problem isn't just limited to the Worklog Distribution Gadget...being able to filter for and print a list of the issues you've worked on in a given time period, regardless of who it's assigned to or what it's current status is, would be very useful.\n\nSimilarly, being able to expose 3rd-party fields to the JIRA filter would make 3rd-party tools (and JIRA in general) more valuable to our customers.\n\nI've asked Tempo if there's anything they can do, and they can't...the filter is a JIRA tool.\n",
