Furthermore, even if the issue isn't closed, you have to go in to the issue, and then open a drop-down just to add a label.\n\nIt'd be great if:\nA) you could add labels to closed issues (or at least make it an option)\nB) add labels more easily on the issue page, without needing the drop-down\nC) add labels from the issue list page",

Summary\nWhen the customer creates a version, either in JIRA or JIRA Agile board, after deleting this version, all issues using it as fix or affected version will still have a reference to it in the database. \n\nThis results in some incorrect JQL searches for Fix Versions or Affected Versions. For example, if an issue ABC-123 had only the 'version1' as its fix version and this one is deleted (doesn't have a fix version anymore), this search won't return the issue when it should:\n{code}\nfixVersion is empty\n{code}\n\nSince that was the only fix version the issue had, now it should be null or empty, but the search fails as there's still a reference to the old version in the database.\n\nThis is also happening to affected versions.\n\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\n# Have a project in JIRA\n# Create a version (either in the board in case of Agile or not) and an issue \n# Add the version as the issue's fixVersion (or affectedVersion)\n# Delete the version _without removing it as the fixVersion (or affectedVersion) in the issue itself_:\n#* Go to the versions page in the project\n#* Click '...' >> 'Delete' >> 'Delete' \n\nh3. Expected Results\n# This JQL search should return the issue, as it was the only fixVersion:\n{code}\nfixVersion is empty\n{code}\n\nh3. Actual Results\nThough the fixVersion is no longer visible in the issue, the following JQL won't return it even if it was the only fixVersion and it should:\n{code}\nfixVersion is empty\n{code}\n\nWhen deleting the version, even though the warning says the links will be removed, they're not completely.\n \nh3. Notes\nThough the fixVersion/affectedVersion is not shown, there's still an entry in the 'nodeassociation' table to the non-existing version. They can all be found with these searches:\nFor FixVersion:\n{code:sql}\nselect distinct(n.sink_node_id) as fix_version_id from project p, jiraissue i, nodeassociation n where n.source_node_id = i.id and p.id = i.project and n.sink_node_id not in (select id from projectversion) and n.association_type = 'IssueFixVersion' order by fix_version_id asc;\n{code}\n\nFor AffectedVersion:\n{code:sql}\nselect distinct(n.sink_node_id) as affected_version_id from project p, jiraissue i, nodeassociation n where n.source_node_id = i.id and p.id = i.project and n.sink_node_id not in (select id from projectversion) and n.association_type = 'IssueVersion' order by affected_version_id asc;\n{code}\n\nThis was replicated in JIRA Cloud instances, but there are reports in JIRA Server instances as well.\n\nh3.Workaround\n*JIRA Server instances*\n# Search for the orphan links as per above and copy their IDs\n# Remove it directly from the database using the IDs found in the search above\n#* Fix Versions:\n{code:sql}\ndelete from nodeassociation where association_type = 'IssueFixVersion' and sink_node_id in (<list of IDs>);\n{code}\n#* Affected Versions:\n{code:sql}\ndelete from nodeassociation where association_type = 'IssueVersion' and sink_node_id in (<list of IDs>);\n{code}\n# Reindex JIRA to be sure the changes are applied\n# To avoid this in the future, bulk edit issues to remove the fix/affected versions before deleting versions.\n\n*Cloud instances*\n# Open a support request at [Atlassian Support|https://support.atlassian.com] to have this workaround be applied",

Problem Definition\n* The *'Configure Fields'* button which exist in the 'Create Issue Pop Up Screen' is not available in the 'Create Issue Screen that is access by URL'. This seems to be a missing functionality at the moment, and are not configurable at the moment.\n* Inconsistency of configuration as if through Create Issue Screen Popup, user have configured custom-fields-visibility, when access the create issue screen from a URL link will remove this custom-fields-visibility setup\n* To access the URL : https://<your jira URL>/secure/CreateIssueDetails!init.jspa?pid=1234&issuetype=6 , change PID with appropriate project ID and issue type.\n!URL_access_createissue_popup1.png|thumbnail!\n!URL_access_createissue_popup.png|thumbnail!\n!URL_access_createissue.png|thumbnail!\n\n{quote}\nThis is needed in order to retain the user preference for the fields on the Create Issue Screen. When we try to create issue using link, Jira looses the custom field preference by the user on the create issue screen and displays all the fields on the screen. Which is annoying for the users who do not want to see all the fileds or all the fields are not useful for users and they have hidden those fileds from screen. It is not necessary to have \"Configure Field\" button on the screen while creating an issue from link, but Jira must retain the field preference and should only show the fileds which are selected by user through Configure Fields option.\n{quote}\n\n\nh2. Suggested Solution\n* To introduce this button in the 'Create Issue Screen that is access by URL' so that consistency can be achieved here.\n* To ensure the user preference for the fields on the Create Issue Screen via Screen Popup coexist on the Create Issue Screen via URL",

Problem Definition\nCurrently, the [Search Request View|https://developer.atlassian.com/static/connect/docs/latest/modules/jira/search-request-view.html] module returns a 403 Forbidden error when attempting to export more than 1000 issues. \n\nThe issue number export limitation is well known per [CLOUD-6544|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CLOUD-6544]. However, plug-ins developed to leverage this module return a 403 when a user is trying to export a search with more than 1000 issues with plug-in specific exporting options created with the search request view module. The 403 error may cause the user to assume the plug-in has failed in some way rather than JIRA enforcing a documented limitation.\n\nh3. Suggested Solution\nIt would be better if JIRA could send the plug-in the control and, as long as the maxIssues parameter is set for the search request view module, the issue export restriction can be managed.",

This is undesirable on certain circumstances.\n\nh5. Suggestion\nThe idea is to provide aliases for project keys. For instance assume you have the process of having two distinct projects in JIRA for a single project \"Foo\". One for development and one after the project was released:\n\nProject key: FOO (for released builds)\nProject key: FOODEV (for development builds)\n\nBefore the project goes live, you only set-up the FOODEV project in JIRA.\n\nIt would be great if you could specify a project key alias to FOODEV called FOO which can then be used to look-up FOODEV issues as long as the alias is active.\nAt the point the project is released you can then remove the alias and add a FOO-project.\n\nThe net outcome is that all your employees will always work with the \"FOO\" project key and it will automatically use the FOODEV-project during the early development phase while later it will automatically use the FOO-project.\n\nNo more need to rectify the long project key names for administrators.",

Problem Definition\nIt's currently not possible to easily change the order in which you would like Stash Servers to be displayed on the \"Where do you want to create the branch\" dialog screen for Creating Branch in JIRA, especially when you have multiple Stash Servers. The screen only allows a maximum of 3 Stash Applications to be displayed at once, but allows you to scroll to find other hidden Stash Servers. Sometimes even the Primary Stash Server configured is hidden in the bottom of this list.\n\nProblem is that the visibility of Servers that are at the bottom of the list and need to be scrolled to reach is quite low, so this becomes an inconvenience when your mostly used Stash Server is always hidden by default from the screen until you scroll to reach it.\n\nh3. Suggested Solution\nImplement more intuitive arrangement order for Stash Servers in the \"Where do you want to create the branch\" dialog screen.\n* One way to do this is to allow the Stash Servers to appear in the same order set in the Application Navigator.\n",

Summary\nConfluence's external macros from JIRA and JIRA Agile aren't working (existing ones) and if new ones are added to Confluence pages they're unable to retrieve JIRA's projects and saved filter, a required step of their configuration, which leads to the following error upon an attempt to save it: {color:red}No project or filter specified.{color}\nMacros such as _Issue Statistics_ and _Two Dimensional Filter Statistics_.\n\nh3. *Update*\nConfluence is having trouble contacting JIRA whenever an action to fetch JIRA information is required.\nIn case the user wants to create an issue in JIRA using Confluence quick issue creation, he/she won't be able to browse the Projects available on JIRA due to a problem with the applink.\n\nh3.

Expected Results\nA drop-down list of available JIRA project or saved filter should appear according to what was typed\n\nh3. Actual Results\nNo drop-down list appear and the following error is displayed when the current setting is saved: {color:red}No project or filter specified.{color}\n \nh3.

But the functionality remains unchanged, i.e. you can still take screenshots with the same keyboard and then just paste on to the issue. You will get the same dialog where you can rename the screenshot.\nThanks for letting us know your thoughts as always!\nCheers,\nLingbo\n{panel}\n\nWe have noticed today, that Attach Screenshot has disappeared from Issue menu for all projects. \n\nPlus,  I can't find 'View Issue Ops Bar Attach Screenshot Link(attach-screenshot)' module under Administrator >> Manage My Plugins >> System Plugins >>'Issue Operations Plugin' \n\nIs this a known issue?

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-44894].\n  {panel}\n\nWe have integrated JIRA to our Active Directory, and the problem is that we have lots of user groups.\n\nThe group list is so long that when you access the \"User Management\" the screen takes a lot to load given it has to receive and render the group list drop down. It would be a great enhancement to remove that drop down and allow text typing and quick search to find a Group Name that way. The same happens in the Group Administration  when adding/removing users to groups, where you have a multi-line select with all the groups listed there, then the current members of the group and the users to add. \n\nBasically, having a large list of groups hits performance and user/administration experience.
