      "description": "h2. Problem\r\nAfter an LDAP directory has already synced and users/groups/memberships have been cached to the database, _subsequent_ syncs can take an extremely long amount of time to complete if there's a large change in user management data. This can be caused by a misconfiguration, e.g. a directory which pulled in too many users initially, and has been adjusted afterwards to pull in less. Or, it can simply be due to large changes on the LDAP server itself.\r\n\r\nThis has the potential to tie up CPU and database resources and can cause performance issues in the application.\r\n\r\nh2. Example/Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Configure an LDAP directory with 50000 users and 10000 groups, with an average of 100 group memberships per person\r\n# Allow the directory to be synced to the database\r\n# Subsequently, edit the LDAP directory in a way such that the user search filter now only pulls in 1000 users.\r\n\r\nThis will result in the directory needing to delete 49000 users from {{cwd_users}}. To do that, it also needs to look up all of the memberships of each of the 49000 users from the {{cwd_membership}} table and issue DELETE statements to the database to remove those. In the logs and the UI, there will be some indication that a massive amount of users are being removed:\r\n{code}\r\n2018-03-26 17:51:06,822 INFO [Caesium-1-3] [atlassian.crowd.directory.DbCachingRemoteChangeOperations] deleteCachedUsersByName deleting [ 49000 ] users\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nThis process will likely take a long time to complete.\r\n\r\nh2. Suggestions\r\nIt would actually be quicker for Crowd to sync \"from scratch\" in this case instead of reconciling the cached dataset in the database. The act of having to work with a huge delta is expensive and taxing on the database. In other words, we can improve sync time in these cases by simply adding 1000 users from zero instead of trying to delete 49000 users from 50000. This will require the directory to perform some pre-sync statistics gathering, so that the directory can decide whether to use the \"from scratch\" approach or go with the original approach.\r\n\r\nAdditionally/alternatively, in the case of large deletes, we might be able to improve the way some of the changes are handled from the database perspective. For example, if the user to be removed is in 100 groups, the sync will first need to delete these 100 memberships. Currently, it will issue 100 individual DELETE statements using the primary key column of the {{cwd_membership}} table (\"id\"):\r\n{code}\r\n2018-03-26 18:51:06,822 DEBUG [Caesium-1-1] [org.hibernate.SQL] logStatement delete from cwd_membership where id=?\r\n2018-03-26 18:51:06,822 TRACE [Caesium-1-1] [type.descriptor.sql.BasicBinder] bind binding parameter [1] as [BIGINT] - [294934]\r\n{code}\r\nIt should be more efficient to look up all of the membership the rows associated with the user ID in one go, using the {{child_id}} column, and issue a single DELETE statement that way.",

      "description": "h2. Summary\r\nStarting in Crowd 2.11, users who are duplicated in multiple directories should only be counted once if they are associated with the same application (as detailed in [Crowd 2.11 release notes|https://confluence.atlassian.com/crowd/crowd-2-11-release-notes-867183140.html]). However, if the duplicated usernames have different letter casing (e.g. \"bob\" vs \"BOB\"), then they will still be counted twice.\r\n\r\nh2. Steps to reproduce\r\n# Install an affected version of Crowd (this has been tested in 2.11.1 and 2.12.0)\r\n# Create two internal directories, DirectoryA and DirectoryB\r\n# Create a user in DirectoryA called \"bob\"\r\n# Create a user in DirectoryB called \"BOB\"\r\n# Create an application\r\n# Add DirectoryA and DirectoryB to the application, in that order, and set both to \"Allow all groups to authenticate\"\r\n# Go to Crowd Admin > Licensing, and recalculate user total\r\n\r\nh2. Expected behavior\r\nCurrent user count should be \"2\" (default admin account + one instance of \"bob\")\r\n\r\nh2. Actual behavior\r\nCurrent user count shows \"3\" (default admin account + \"bob\" + \"BOB\"). This is a bug because only \"bob\" from the top directory should be counted.\r\n\r\nh2. Other notes\r\nAside from double counting if both users are enabled, this can also cause problems if the top user is _disabled_ but the bottom user is still enabled. In this scenario, Crowd will still count the bottom user against the license even though effectively the user cannot log in due to directory order and the top user taking precedence. \r\n\r\nh2. Workarounds\r\n* Option 1: Rename usernames so that they match in terms of casing across directories. Note that this will not work properly if user comes from an external sources, e.g. LDAP\r\n* Option 2: Adjust your directory configurations such that there are no duplicate usernames across directories",
