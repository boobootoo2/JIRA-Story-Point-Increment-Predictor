      "description": "Hello,\r\n\r\nI've been using Git on our team a little over a month now moving from TFS on Windows and SVN on Mac into one system.  The atlassian stack is amazing, we have JIRA, Confluence, Fisheye/Crucible, Stash, and Bamboo all in play and love it!!!\r\n\r\nOnce concern we have with the SourceTree app is staying aware of remote changes such as developer pushes, etc.  I changed the default refresh from 10 to 5 minutes and may even lower it to 1 minute.  But it's hit or miss as to exactly when and what is required for the remote to be queried for updates.\r\n\r\nDo I need to have the local remotes open? Do I just need the ST client app open?  It seems when the ST app is minimized to the Apple Dock at the bottom it's not querying until I restore it into view. \r\n\r\nI really would like to see a more aggressive polling of our remotes so we are always confident of when we have the latest pulled in or not.  I'd also suggest, if possible, like HipChat does, is the Stash server (or bitbucket) if tied to SourceTree to use remote/push notifications to send real time notifications to the client and subsequent show desktop notifications.\r\n\r\nThe Windows side needs the same attention in more aggressive polling but I prefer not to create another case if not needed.\r\n\r\nThank you for all of the great tools.  Please also continue to help us Git newbies create, use, and maintain submodules/subtrees by any automated push/pull's to ensure no bits ever get forgotten in managing source.  We don't use the submodules/trees yet as we're slowly learning Git so we need all of your help in the ST app to help us.\r\n\r\nNeal",

In other words, retrieve the version from that commit into a temporary location, then diff it with the current one in the repository.\r\n\r\nThese two features would go a long way toward making it easy to deal with branch merges that have conflicts, and/or picking out changes from a branch to back-patch.",
