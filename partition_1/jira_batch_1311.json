[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-1012].\n  {panel}\n\nA few suggestions that I think would improve JIRA from a general project management perspective (and I think they are probably easy to implement to boot).\n\n1.  A 'estimated close date' or 'due date' field for issues (I think this may already be on the list).  Would allow for some basic over/under schedule type metrics.\n\n2.  'target date' and 'release date' tracking on versions (again simple scheduling metrics).\n\n3.  It would be very useful to be able to attach documents to the project itself, not only to issues.  Often a project has high level documents (project charter, licensing docs, coding conventions, etc) that need to be in a highly visible, easily accessible location.  Creating bogus issues to attach then to doesn't work so well (out of sight, out of mind).  It would be great to be able to attach them directly to a project and have them listed on the main project detail screen.\n\nThanks,\n\nJoe",

Your input in the comments helps us understand how this affects you and what you're hoping to accomplish with JIRA.\n\nThis suggestion is a priority for the JIRA development team, but I am not able to provide an accurate estimate for when this will be resolved. We will update this issue as soon as we can confidently project a release.\n\nPlease remember that jira.atlassian.com is one of many inputs for the JIRA roadmap. You can [learn more about our process here|https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/110373/how-does-the-jira-team-use-jira-atlassian-com].\n\nI understand that our decision may be disappointing.

Your feedback is key to helping us understand how you use JIRA so we can continue improving your experience. We have reviewed this issue over the last few days; however there are not currently any plans to implement this suggestion.\n\nWhile we absolutely understand many the logic behind many of the requests for subcomponents, we strongly believe that our focus should be on making JIRA simpler and easier to use. Simply put, additional levels of hierarchy for components is likely to add complexity on a conceptual level, at a technical level (more bugs and slower performance) and will lead to a more confusing UI.\n\nThere are several add-ons available on the Marketplace addressing the requirements outlined below:\n* [Subcomponents for JIRA Cloud|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/net.brokenbuild.cloud.subcomponents/cloud/overview]\n* [Component/Subcomponent/Bundle Versions|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.deniz.jira.versioning/server/reviews] (for JIRA Server)\n* [Subcomponents for JIRA|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/net.brokenbuild.subcomponents] (for JIRA Server)\n\nPlease remember that jira.atlassian.com is one of many inputs for the JIRA roadmap. You can [learn more about our process here|https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/110373/how-does-the-jira-team-use-jira-atlassian-com].\n \nI understand that our decision may be disappointing. Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.\n \nRegards,\nDave Meyer\ndmeyer@atlassian.com\nProduct Manager, JIRA Platform\n{panel}\n\n*Original request description:*\n \nAs a person responsible for running the project I need to have the tools aligned with my projects' structures. My projects are organised in a large hierarchical groups of components. I need to be able to assign the JIRA issue to a whole group of components, as well as individually to any component within the system and be able to interact with issues in JIRA based on this assignment - i.e. all issues for component group, including both issues which are assigned to group as well as issues assigned to individual components within that group.",

It will make easier to created filters on mail clients.\n\nFor example, I'd like to automatically archive emails JIRA sends me relative to the xdoclet project, but not to the xdocletgui project. In the current setup, the only way to differentiate these messages is searching the Topic field. This is not optimal.\n\nSo, let's suppose I create a field in my email message that looks for emails:\n\n  1) Sent by legendaryservice@atlassion.com\n  2) Topic starts with [JIRA]\n  3) Topic contains XDT (the project key)\n\nYou see, there are two criteria based on topic. Not good. JIRA could add some custom header (like X-Jira-Project) to emails sent, so I could set up a filter based on that.",

To discourage nasties from registering as a third person [who is not himself]\n2. To discourage frivilous use of issue submittal. (This assumes that a user will be more inclined to create \"good\" issues if he knows his identity is known.)\n3. To satisfy corporate edicts. (Fortunately, I am not under any editcs :-)\n\nHow:\n\n1. User enters registration information (just like now)\n2. Jira creates a user object in the database in an \"unconfirmed\" state with an associated \"confirmation code\".\n3. Jira notfies the user that an email has been sent containing a confirmation code/link. Jira sends the email to the user.\n4. User receives confirmation email, clicks on confirmation link. \n5. Jira servlet at url specified in email receives confirmation code, and \"confirms\" user registration.\n6. User can now login in to Jira\n\n4a. User receives email, but was not the one who registered.\n4b. User optionally contacts Jira admin, who can, if required, attempt to track down the perpitrator.\n\nAdmin Confirmation\n-------------------\nWhy:\n\n1. To ensure that only customers can view issues. (This is much less a priority, as groups can be used to provide access control to projects.)\n\nHow:\n\n1. User enters registration information (just like now)\n2. Jira creates a user object in the database in an \"unapproved\" state.\n3. Jira notfies the user that an email will be sent once his registration has been approved. \n4. Jira sends the email to admin and/or provides list of registrations required via an admin page.\n5. Admin approves via email or admin page.\n6. Jira changes user registration to \"approved\" state and sends email notice to user.\n6. User can now login in to Jira\n\n5a. Admin does not approve registration, and specifies a reason.\n5b. Jira sends \"too bad\" email to user\n",

We now have the perfect issue-resolution work flow with Jira, where users report an issue, we resolve it, then they close it once they've tested the resolution.  (Just to clarify, our 'users' give us a spec for the applications that we develop and so are internal, not Joe Public...)\n\nIt would be a great extension of this workflow to apply it to versions of projects as well as to individual bugs.  This would mean that our users can 'sign-off' a version as being complete and ready for deployment to production.\n\nWould anyone else find this useful?  Currently we do all our great work in Jira then have to go to Lotus Notes for sign-off (!)  Linking to Jira's roadmap of course ;)  Which almost works...! (JRA-633)\n\n  Mike",

Your feedback is key to helping us understand how you use JIRA so we can continue improving your experience. We have reviewed this issue over the last few days; unfortunately we don't have any plans to support this in JIRA for the foreseeable future.\n\nPlease remember that jira.atlassian.com is one of many inputs for the JIRA roadmap. You can [learn more about our process here|https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/110373/how-does-the-jira-team-use-jira-atlassian-com].\n \nI understand that our decision may be disappointing. Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.\n \nRegards,\nDave Meyer\ndmeyer@atlassian.com\nProduct Manager, JIRA Platform\n{panel}\n\n\\\\\nI think there should be a way to customize outgoing emails to clients per project.

The expected end date of the bug fix has moved by several days, which means the stories won't be able to start on the expected start date, nor the issues dependent on them, and so one - dozens of work items need to have their dates shifted.\r\n\r\nI would like to be able to auto-shift all the dates (both start end end) of all the issues based on the changes on end dates (or start dates, if using consecutive start of dependencies) - there could possibly be a confirmation step, e.g. \"Would you like to shift all dependent issues accordingly, by X days?\".\r\n\r\nThis requirement has come up repeatedly from many Plans users in our organization, since this is something they are able to do in MS Project easily. It was a blocker for some of them to switch to planning their projects in Jira from MS Project.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nDaniel",

Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Create a plan.\r\n # Create two issues: *Issue-1* and *Issue-2*\r\n # Associate *Issue-1* with the *Release A* and *Release B* fix version/s in Jira Software.\r\n # Associate *Issue-2* with the *Release B* fix version in Jira Software.\r\n # Ensure that *Release A's id* is the first value returned by the backlog request.\r\n\r\nh3.

Issue Summary\r\n\r\nThe [Advanced Roadmaps for Jira in Confluence|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1221237/advanced-roadmaps-for-jira-in-confluence?hosting=server&tab=overview] macro added to a Confluence page fails to load a Roadmap from a Jira On-prem instance if there is a mismatch in the Application URL used in the AppLink and the URL from the Roadmap Link.\r\n\r\nThe issue only affects versions 1.2.0 and above of the app\u00a0[Advanced Roadmaps for Jira in Confluence|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1221237/advanced-roadmaps-for-jira-in-confluence?hosting=server&tab=overview].\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nTested on Confluence 7.4 and 7.13 linked to a Jira 8.18 instance:\r\n # Install Jira 8.18.\r\n # Install Confluence 7.4 or 7.13.\r\n # Create an Application link between them using the same URL as Application URL and Display URL:\r\n ** In the tests performed, it was\u00a0[http://localhost:8080|http://localhost:8080/]\r\n # Install the\u00a0*Advanced Roadmaps for Jira in Confluence*\u00a0app (version 1.1.0) on Confluence.\r\n # Add an\u00a0*Advanced Roadmaps*\u00a0macro to a Confluence page and link it to a valid Roadmap from Jira.\r\n # If the URL from the Roadmap Link and the Application URL from the AppLink match (see example below), the macro works as expected\u00a0(/):\r\n ** Application URL from the AppLink Confluence->Jira:\u00a0[http://localhost:8080/]\r\n ** Roadmap Link:\u00a0[http://localhost:8080/secure/PortfolioRoadmapConfluence.jspa?r=1hFAg]\r\n # Edit the AppLink and change the Application URL to a different but valid URL such as\u00a0[http://127.0.0.1:8080|http://127.0.0.1:8080/]\u00a0(which points to the same location as\u00a0*localhost*, in this case).\r\n # Check the page where the macro was added and it is still working as expected.\u00a0  !https://getsupport.atlassian.com/images/icons/emoticons/check.png|width=16,height=16!\r\n # Update the app to version 1.2.0 or higher.\r\n # Check the page where the macro was added and it is no longer working as expected.\u00a0(x)\r\n ** This is due to a mismatch in the URL from the Roadmap Link and the Application URL.\r\n ** Application Link Confluence->Jira, Application URL:\u00a0[http://127.0.0.1:8080/]\r\n ** Roadmap Link:\u00a0[http://localhost:8080/secure/PortfolioRoadmapConfluence.jspa?r=1hFAg]\r\n ** If you replace\u00a0*localhost*\u00a0in the Roadmap Link above with the IP address we are using on this example, the macro starts working again.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nThe Roadmap would be displayed on the Confluence page.\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nThe message below is displayed instead:\r\n{quote}*Error rendering macro 'portfolio-for-jira-plan'*\r\n\r\nIt looks like you've entered a URL to a Jira that is not connected to Confluence. Contact your administrator to configure an Application Link\r\n{quote}\r\nh3. Additional Notes\r\n\r\nIf we go back to the Release Notes for\u00a0[Release Notes|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1221237/advanced-roadmaps-for-jira-in-confluence/version-history] for v1.2.0 of this app, we can see the following:\r\n{quote}Note to administrators: This new version pulls Advanced Roadmaps data from Jira\u00a0*using Application Links*. To ensure a smooth upgrade, please make sure that the Application Link between your Confluence and Jira servers is set up. If you update to the new version without this connection, your Macro might not work as intended\r\n{quote}\r\nWe have some cases where customers set an AppLink between Confluence and Jira using different URLs for Display URL and Application URL.\r\n\r\nThis is done, for example, when setting an [unproxied application link|https://confluence.atlassian.com/kb/how-to-create-an-unproxied-application-link-719095740.html]. Usually, the Display URL will match the Base URL for the Jira instance, which is not the same URL set for the Application URL.\r\n\r\nWhen generating the Roadmap Link on Jira, it will use the Base URL as a reference.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nThe user can use one of the following workarounds:\r\n# Downgrade the app\u00a0[Advanced Roadmaps for Jira in Confluence|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1221237/advanced-roadmaps-for-jira-in-confluence?hosting=server&tab=overview] to version 1.10, as long as you are running a Confluence version compatible with it; or\r\n# Set the Application URL in the AppLink to be equal to the Display URL, if possible; or\r\n# When adding the Roadmap Link to the macro on a Confluence page, manually change the URL to use the Application URL from the AppLink (see step 10 in the *Steps to Reproduce* section).",

Within this space, we have created a page and linked a roadmap we created for the customer to this (from Advanced Roadmap > Share plan as > Confluence).\r\n\r\nHowever, when the customer is viewing the page they cannot see the roadmap. They instead see an embedded webpage (I think this is our service desk/support page).\u00a0\r\n\r\nI added the customer's group to the Advanced roadmap permission, but this still didn't work. Only after I added the customer's group to Jira access did it work. However, this is not suitable as:\r\nA) none of the issues are pulling through to the roadmap as they don't have access to the project (and we don't want to give this view access to the whole of this project)\r\nB) the customer can see project names etc. which we don't want them to\r\nC) we would incur additional costs to add them as a Jira user.\u00a0\r\n\r\nI also tried the iframe method, but the result was the same.\u00a0\r\n\r\nI would've assumed that the roadmap would be viewable for everyone that has access to the space, but this is not the case.

Issue Summary\r\n\r\nWhen there are two fields in Jira named \u201cTeam\u201d, one custom, the other from ARJ, the UI will only display a single entry when trying to add this field into Plan view, when added, it will show both the custom field and the ARJ field and it's not possible to have only a single one appearing.\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Create a custom field named *Team*\r\n!image-2021-09-02-10-43-07-887.png|thumbnail! \r\n# Allow the custom field to be used in ARJ Plan:\r\n!image-2021-09-02-10-44-43-376.png|thumbnail! \r\n# On ARJ Plan, try to add +one+ of the *Team* fields, only a single option will be shown:\r\n !image-2021-09-02-10-45-15-919.png|thumbnail! \r\n# When adding this single entry, both fields will be displayed:\r\n!image-2021-09-02-10-51-00-594.png|thumbnail! \r\n# When removing the single entry available, both columns are removed\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nBoth fields are identified and can be added/removed separately\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nOnly one of the fields is available at the picker and will result on both fields being added/removed from plan view\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\nOne alternative, is to \"rename\" the custom field in Jira through the usage of the\u00a0*translation feature*, which should not break any references in JQLs/Filters to your current Team field in Jira, as described on\u00a0[Translating Custom Fields|https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiraserver/translating-custom-fields-1047552721.html], using the current instance language\r\n\r\nBy performing this method, you should be able to change the way the custom field name is presented, as to identify it as being from Jira, such as TeamsJira or similar, which would allow it to be separated from it's ARJ counterpart.\r\n\r\nWith this we are able to successfully list two\u00a0*Team*\u00a0fields, as my custom one is being translated into\u00a0*jTeam*\u00a0and referenced as such by ARJ:\r\n\r\n !screenshot-1.png|thumbnail! \r\n !screenshot-2.png|thumbnail! \r\n !screenshot-3.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\nWhile in Jira on display it will use the name\u00a0*jTeam*, but for any filtering purposes it retains it's original name:\r\n\r\n !screenshot-4.png|thumbnail!",

Expected Results\r\nBoth issues A and B are included in Plan X\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nIssue B is missing from Plan X\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\nAuto-schedule plan to force a recalculation to redisplay both issues in the plan. \r\n\r\nh3. Notes\r\nThis is happening because data related to the moved issues like PROJECT, VERSION, etc are still referring to their original project in {{AO_D9132D_ASSIGNMENT_EXT}} table.
