However, those transitions created don't appear in the list of transitions for a step when you want to remove it.  \n\nConsequently, the value dimishes if you cannot remove it from a step since, in our case, there is usually only one transition that is valid from a closed state (reopen).  Thus, I had to go into the properties for that created transition and basically hide it from everyone.  \n\nI have several scenarios where this would come in handy and make creating some very complex workflows less time consuming when the user wants to go from one transition to any transition (e.g. project implementations are like this).  \n\nRight now, I've not given them this option because of the time required to setup all these transitions. We just say, move it to Hold and from hold you can go anywhere - so, that is our workaround. \n\nPlease consider having this option as a great default to quickly apply transitions; but, allow an admin to remove them individually, where appropriate.

[See the corresponding bug report|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-42344].\n  {panel}\n\nHi Atlassian,\n\nIn JIRA 6 it is not possible anymore to add new notification types easily by just registering  a new notification type using NotificationTypeManager.setSchemeTypes().\nActually it's possible to register a new type but later when notification events are processed one gets exceptions as in https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/183097. So in my opinion NotificationTypeManager.setSchemeTypes() is broken and that is why i file this as a Bug.\n\nWe understand Atlassians efforts to keep the core stable against misbehaving getRecipients() methods in customer implemented NotificationType's. I am also aware that uninstalled customer plugins cause problems in the core when they leave configuration information but hey, why not just log this as a simple warning and ignore it?\nNow we have to use NotificationFilter - which still can be implemented badly and thus is not adding stability - *and* we are not able anymore to store the notification scheme entries in column notify_type of table notification. This requires to create code (UI,backend) to persist this information elsewhere.\n\nThere really should be an easier way to allow the definition of custom notification types, e.g. by switching back to the JIRA 5 behaviour when a certain system property is set on startup. As a big enterprise customer I am aware of what my notification type code does. I see your best intentions but this makes our life difficult since we need either to spend money to create new solutions for something we already have *or* change system classes. Both is not acceptable for us!\n\nIn the final it's even not clear to me for which technical reason notification types have been hard coded in JIRA 6. As a consequence Atlassian should have deprecated NotificationTypeManager.setSchemeTypes() already in JIRA 5 because it is broken now in JIRA 6. Also notification-event-types.xml should have been removed in JIRA 6. The way it is now developers still have the impression the extension mechanism works. \n\nRegards,\nDieter",

While there might be a reason for the limitation such as it might able to impact the instance performance, there is no tool or other workaround to differentiate the previous edited 1000 issues if the issues that needs to be edited is more than 1000. While JIRA Admin able to make changes on the field to mark issues that have been edited, it will always be two steps operation:\n# Bulk Edit and update fields to mark it while making the actually changes.\n# Do another search with \"!=\" expression or JQL search that could differentiate it.\n# Repeat.\n\nThese operation will take longer and major work to do if the issues need to be edited for example about 10,000, not to mention there could be a human error where the previous issues is included inside.\n\nHence, it would be great if there is a Tool or function that could segregated the 1000 issues out of 10,000 then runs automatically until those 10,000 issues is edited, rather than repeating the operation above again and again,",

[See the corresponding bug report|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-42282].\n  {panel}\n\nh3. Summary\n\nWhen issuing requests to {{/jira/rest/api/2/issue/createmeta?projects.issuetypes}} on larger instances, in some cases the call can take over a minute to complete and generate 115mb of content.\n\nWith {{fields}} added ({{createmeta?projects.issuetypes.fields}}), JIRA can run out of memory if its Xmx is too low.\nh3. Environment\n\nThe following data exists in the test instance:\n{noformat}\nDatabase Statistics\nIssues          417547\nProjects        1481\nCustom Fields   1203\nWorkflows       324\nAttachments     0\nComments        2921131\nUsers           17225\nGroups          985\n\n{noformat}\nAnd 323 issue types.\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\n # Setup or use an instance with similar data sizes.\n # Query {{/rest/api/2/issue/createmeta?projects.issuetypes}}, for example [https://jira.atlassian.com/rest/api/2/issue/createmeta?projects.issuetypes].\n\nh3. Expected Results\n\nThe query returns in a reasonable timeframe.\nh3. Actual Results\n\nThe query takes ~60 secs as per the attached screenshot, or in the case of {{createmeta?projects.issuetypes.fields}} runs out of memory entirely.\nh3. Possible cause and room for improvement\nh4. Duplicate content\n\nWe have seen that in some cases there are _logical duplicates_ in the {{optionconfiguration}} table. This, depending on the number of affected issue types, can cause performance issues itself. To check for such, you can run the following query:\n{code}\nSELECT fieldid,optionid,fieldconfig, count(*) FROM optionconfiguration group by fieldid,optionid,fieldconfig having count(*)>1\n{code}\nIf the above returns any rows, you are likely affected by the problem. In this case, please raise a ticket on [https://support.atlassian.com|https://support.atlassian.com/], referring to this bug report and ask for assistance on de-duplicating the table.\nh4. OOM\n\nThe only workaround for this behaviour is to increase JIRA's maximum heap. There's no hard-and-fast rule for what to increase it to, as it's a function of the number of projects, custom fields, issue types, and contexts for each.",

This affects what order the versions are shown in drop-down lists and also how 'version' type fields are sorted. \n\nThe drop and drag functionality provided by the User Interface does not allow creating a version into a specific location, or automatically sorting this list using any criteria.\n\nProjects with very long lists become difficult to manage. For example, imagine having many concurrent version releases being actively developed and needing to add a point release due to a security patch on each version. The Project Administrator would need to drag through the list all the new project versions to their correct locations.\n\nControls such as: Automatically Sorting the list by Version Number and allowing a user to define a specific \"versionAfter\" version when creating a new version would greatly aid in the usability of the product.",

Problem Definition\nWhen viewing an issue in JIRA, you are presented all the fields that are associated with a screen. I know you can display/hide fields by making a new screen and then associating with a workflow transition. However, I would also like this to reflect on the main page when viewing an issue.\n\nh3. Example\nAn example would be on Create Issue you are presented with fields such as Zip Code, Phone Number, State and, City. So after creating the issue with these fields containing values, you will see these fields on the main page for viewing an issue. However, let's say I'm on a transition/status called \"Shipped\" and the screen for that transition does not contain the fields Zip Code, Phone, Number, State and City. I want that to be reflected on the main page thus hiding those fields. \n",

Rather than looking for the correct tab in web browser or have a lot of separate windows for each Atlassian Products, using this app we could just hit CMD+Tab a few times and we will be on where we want to be.\n\nUsing this app integration also could help to keep tracks on what we are working on.\n\nSo far, based on customers comment STASH and Confluence are working perfectly when integrated with the app, but not JIRA.

The idea of this is to avoid performance issues.\n\nThis becomes a major limitation in use cases where one of these words coincide with a string which represents an important search sting in a JIRA instance e.g. a code or acronym (for one customer BY is an IATA code which is a custom field value and used in the summaries of JIRA tickets as well). In this cases it's a major inconvenience and source of confusion for users who are not getting expected results when searching with this strings because they are treated as stop words by lucene.\n\nNot sure what would be the best way to implement a solution for this problem, but perhaps we can implement a way to automatically modify the text to an exact search string by adding quotes automatically when a reserved word is used in search. e.g.:\nbasically {{text ~ \"by\"}} becomes {{text ~ \"\\\"by\\\"\"}} automatically, so that the search doesn't fail.",

Same goes for JIRA startup - run initially, and then again every time the delay has passed.\n\nContrast that with Confluence's \"Scheduled Jobs\", where, for at least some of them, it is possible to specify execution times like one does with Cron on *nix systems - in the case of the specific client I had in mind (who is not alone in this), it would be beneficial to specify, for instance 0 20 * * * for one service, 5 20 * * * for another, 10 20 * * * for a third etc., for execution every day at 20:00 for the first, 20:05 for the second, 20:10 for the third and so forth.\n\nTo summarise, the Cron-like ability for scheduling jobs in Confluence is great, and it would be very nice to have similar capabilities in JIRA.",
