Steps to Reproduce\r\n # The instance has been setup to process incoming mail on default mail server\r\n # An email update is done by any participating user at a Jira Issue\r\n # Email Handler takes that one email update and adds it multiple times at the corresponding Jira issue as multiple comments.\r\n\r\nh3.

Actual Results\r\n\r\nMultiple emails were sent by the mail engine on a single email , potentially as an architectural retry to ensure mail was sent successfully. Checking backend logs show that any one email and its specific messageId can be processed up to hundreds of times, which in return shows that each mail were updated that many times as separate comments but redundant and duplicate comments into the Jira Issue.\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nCurrently there is no known workaround for this behavior. A workaround will be added here when available. As best practise , please try to ensure that Jira issues are maintained within a healthy size limit of comment - these issues seem more apparent in issues that already have more then 200 comments.
