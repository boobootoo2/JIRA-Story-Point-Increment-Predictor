That's an unfortunate reason that keeps me on SourceTree 1.5, because there this issue isn't yet fixed, and I can keep replacing \"~/Library/Application Support/SourceTree/openWindowList\" with an empty openWindowList file before actually running \"stree\", so that everything works as I'd like to.\"\n\nNote, window restoration to be disabled, however running 'stree <path>' should open just that single repository window and nothing else.",

Is SourceTree or git flow hardcoded to only push to a remote named origin during the finish?\r\n\r\nSince there isn't an ongoing log in this version (but looks to be in 1.7, yea!) I'm not sure exactly what is going on when the git flow release finish command is running.\r\n\r\nAfter the release is finished (merge release to master, merge release to develop) then it fails when pushing these changes to the remote.  I can dismiss the error dialog box then manually push to the remote and everything is good again.\r\n\r\nAttached is a screenshot showing the error.\r\nAlso note the last line.  Shouldn't that be \"FROM develop TO origin\"?\r\n\r\nHope this helps",

However, when you \"Pull\" from the parent repository it always executes \"git submodule update \\-\\-recursive \\-\\-init\". This will always put the submodule back to the commit stored with the parent repository. If the \"\\-\\-remote\" argument is also supplied, it will first pull the given branch to the submodule.\r\n\r\nAt some level this is as simple as adding \"\\-\\-remote\" to the submodule update command, although I'm sure everyone would like the ability to set this on a per-submodule basis (so some submodules can be semi-static, referring to a specific commit unless specifically changed).",
