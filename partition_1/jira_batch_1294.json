These two capabilities should have distinct permissions. The current mixup drastically reduces the usefulness of granting permissions to \"Reporter\" and \"Current assignee\". A distinct \"View project\" permission should be required before any other permission is considered. The current \"Browse projects\" permission could be renamed to \"Browse issues\".\n\nCurrently if you grant \"Browse project\" to \"Reporter\", ALL users can see ALL projects, even those where they have no role. Of course you can create a permission scheme per project, but that nullifies the whole point of having permission schemes.\n\nThis subject has been extensively discussed previously (JRA-4093, JRA-4935, JRA-8950, JRA-11881, JRA-14307). A fix is identified in JRA-14307. It's great to have a patch, but much better to solve the underlying problem.\n\n\n*Workaround* \nThis might help in some cases : https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Current+Reporter+Browse+Project+Permission.",

This is because when an issue is cloned, it does not automatically get assigned to the default assignee and therefore there is not an e-mail sent via our notification scheme to the appropriate persons.  We are encouraging users to re-open issues rather than clone them so they are not lost.  However, this is not working so nicely.

We highly value your feedback in all forms, and through suggestions in jira.atlassian.com is not different. We use this channel often to learn the best we can with how customers use JIRA and how we can continue to improve the experience for as many users as possible.\n\nWe have revisited this issue again recently and wanted to reiterate that there are still currently no plans to implement this suggestion, and it is not currently on any JIRA team\u2019s roadmap at this stage.\n\nPlease remember that jira.atlassian.com is one of many inputs for the JIRA roadmap. You can [learn more about our process here|https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/110373/how-does-the-jira-team-use-jira-atlassian-com].\n\nI understand that our decision may be disappointing. Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.\n\n\nRegards,\nKerrod Williams\nKerrod (dot) Williams (at) atlassian (dot) com\nProduct Manager, JIRA\n\n{panel}\n\nI would like to keep track of all the versions an issue has been scheduled in. I created a custom field for versions. I then do a bulk update at the start of the version of this field so that even if the fix version changes, I still have the original version there. However, if that same issue gets again re-scheduled, I now loose the first version that was already there if I do a bulk update. I would have to manually select both versions for that issue.\n\nWhat I would like is the ability to say \"add this new value to the already existing values\" in a bulk change. This can be very useful to add a new label for instance to issues also.",

This is nice as it is easy to keep track of new issues or add comments if you know more about it.\n\n*But there is a problem:* As _Issue Created_ notification also applies to Sub-Tasks the developers get a huge heap of unwanted notification mails.\n\nThis is because we use Sub-Tasks as a way a developers might organize their work to document step by step approach. Thus most of the time such sub-tasks are more like private todos than anything interesting to the public.\n\n*I suggest* to have a separate notification called _Sub-Task created_ which is independent from _Issue created_.\n\nIf resolving JRA-9941 it might still be good to have the two notifications introduced here just in case you want to simulate the old behavior, i. e. getting Sub-Task created mails just as Sub-Task for Issue created (as proposed by JRA-9941).",

Right now, when we look at Versions, there is no apparent way to tell when the Version was created and by whom or how many times it has been modified and what the previous values were.

This is a great long time expected feature. And I think we can make it even better.\n\nLet's consider the following (I guess realistic in the way people uses Jira) scenario:\n\nMost of the initial high level estimates are made on the Parent issue. \nThen as the issue understanding increases, estimated subtasks are created.\n\nIn order to keep the total estimated effort coherent between the Parent and its Children, the owner of a subtask must update the Parent according to the time tracking information passed in the children. For instance, if I initially estimate a Parent issue to 5 days of effort, if I then split it in 5 subtasks of 1 day, I can decide to reduce the remaining of the Parent issue in similar proportion (otherwise I'll get 10 days in the consolidated view). \n\nThis should be an option - maybe I'll be pleased to keep a effort margin at the parent level \"in case of\".\n\nCurrently, this little process, while understood by our users, is quite cumbersome: update subtasks timetracking, than udpate parent timetracking.\nIt has a direct impact of the reliability of the information gathered at parent level.\n\nWe would like a shortcut in the subtask worklog screen that would allow the users to update the parent timetracking according to the children changes.\nSounds like a small change, but we do think it would increase the reliability of the time tracking data.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

We have addressed the original improvement request provided in the description of this issue, in JIRA 5.2. Users now have the ability to edit a workflow scheme on a project - a draft is created, and the migration is handled through the normal migration process. Functionality that has been provided:\n* Add existing workflows\n* Remove workflows from scheme\n* Reassign issue types between workflows in the scheme\n* Publish draft\n* Discard draft\n\nYou can read all about the new improvements in the latest [JIRA EAP release notes|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/JIRA+5.2+EAP+4+(m6)+Release+Notes].\n\nThis functionality works if you have a 1:1 mapping between a project and a workflow scheme. I understand that this does not fulfil the functionality discussed in [JRA-5254], which is also mentioned in the comments on this issue. *We understand this and are actively addressing* [JRA-5254] - unfortunately it is not a part of JIRA 5.2.\n\nGoing forward, I will be resolving this issue when JIRA 5.2 is released in the coming weeks, and leaving [JRA-5254] open until that is fully addressed and workflow schemes can be edited when they are associated with more than one project.\n\nIf you have any questions or concerns feel free to contact me directly.\n\nThanks for your understanding,\nJosh Devenny\nJIRA Product Management\njdevenny at atlassian dot com\n{panel}\n\n\n\nOriginal Description\n--------------------\n\nSo the current process is:\n  1) Create a workflow with all steps etc\n  2) Create workflow scheme, assigning issue types to workflows\n  3) Configure project to use the new workflow\n  4) Realise that you've forgotton something\n  5) swear\n  6) Copy Workflow - making required changes\n  7) Copy workflow scheme\n  8) Delete all assigned workflows in copied scheme\n  9) Assign issue types to new workflows\n  10) Configure project to use new workflow\n\n.. And then there's the clean up stage where you delete the previous workflow scheme and workflow.\n\nI've rarely seen changes to the workflow scheme once it's been configured, so it's just extra work to reconfigure the scheme for the new adjusted workflow.",

Your input in the comments helps us understand how this affects you and what you're hoping to accomplish with JIRA.\n\nWe are interested in bundling this functionality in JIRA by default, however I cannot provide an estimate when this will take place.\n\n* For JIRA Server customers, you can install the free [OpenID Authentication plugin|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.pawelniewiadomski.jira.jira-openid-authentication-plugin], maintained by one of our JIRA developers.\n* In JIRA Cloud, authentication is managed across the entire Atlassian Cloud instance, we can consist of JIRA, Confluence, Bamboo, and Bitbucket. Currently, we support Google Apps integration in Atlassian Cloud instances, however I cannot provide an estimate when we will have full OpenID support.\n\nPlease remember that jira.atlassian.com is one of many inputs for the JIRA roadmap. You can [learn more about our process here|https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/110373/how-does-the-jira-team-use-jira-atlassian-com].\n\nI understand that our decision may be disappointing. Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.\n\nRegards,\nDave Meyer\n[dmeyer@atlassian.com|mailto:dmeyer@atlassian.com]\nProduct Manager, JIRA Platform\n{panel}\n\nIt would be useful for me to support openid authentication in Jira. I plan to build set of all web services based on openid authentication, so external users can use own openid server, and they do not need to register specifically with my Jira. \n\nOpenID would be similar to external LDAP - it only manages passwords. If Jira is in Public mode then new users may get some default user role (e.g. jira-users) after first log on, if Private then unknown OpenIDs should be just rejected. ",

This leads to the following problem.\n\nIf data is imported into JIRA from some other system (in our case it's TrackGear, via csv importer), users are created automatically, and passwords for them are not set. As a result, once import is complete, you may have hundreds of users in the database with no passwords - this means that they cannot login anyway until passwords for them are explicitly set. This is hundreds of manual password set operations used for one thing only - to let the user do his first login and then possibly change his password.\n\nIf the system either allowed users with blank passwords to login, or provided a bulk password set functionality, it would solve the problem.",

JIRA apparently distinguishes between a group name entered as *MGR: Smith* vs. *Mgr: Smith*, or *mgr: smith*.  Is it necessary to make this field case sensitive?  It creates a hardship, as various managers will be entering their own group name as search criteria, and I'm bound to get all kinds of calls if they do not use the precise case.  (I am aware that the group picker would eliminate this problem, but I prefer not to open up the list of groups to all managers).",

I only use Jetbrains's IDEA product, but they have many more products that are listed in Jira.\n\nThe problem I have with Quick Search is that it shows issues across all projects, it shows issues with all statuses.\nEventually I just got fed up with it and created a filter \"IDEA Search Template\" which has the projects, status, and resolution fields preset with a search term \"ChangeThisXYZ\". So, now what I do is click on \"IDEA Search Template\", then click Edit filter, then change the filter text, and then click View to see the jiras.\n\nThis got me thinking that maybe the Quick Search could just allow you to set a search filter as the default settings for the Quick Search. The Quick Search would use all the settings in the filter except for the query string. The query string would still be taken from the quick search textbox.",

Currently the Assignee field defaults to the currently assigned user, usually the resolver.  This is never the correct value for this field during a Resolve transition.\n\nWhen we reopen an issue, we want the Assignee field to select the last assigned user.  I note there is already a request for this functionality.\n\nOur plan is to install a Post Function that assigns the issue to the Reporter, and remove the Assignee field from the resolve screen.  This is less than ideal.   We have no simple solution for re-opened issues.\n\nWhat I'd really like is some kind of pre-function that can alter values to be displayed on the web form without yet touching the underlying database.

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-13763].\n  {panel}\n\nHi,\n\nplease imagine the following scenario:\n\nYou create an issue with some subtasks in project A. Then you clone it with all subtasks and move the clone to project B. \n\nSome time later you create a new subtask for the issue in project A.  If you now want the new subtask in the clone too, then there's quite a lot to do because you can't move a subtask to another project.\nWhat can be done is: clone the subtask. Convert it to a normal issue. Move it. Change to subtask. This ist quite a lot to do for such a simple action.\n\nIt would be really helpful to move subtask directly to another project because we need that very often.\n\nCheers and thx,\nIrene",

In one the whole database became unavailable, and on two more occasions the database went read only (disk full, commits not possible).\n\nWhile we obviously need to sort out the issues with the database uptime (and contractually it should be 100%, so we have a issue with the provider) we were also disappointed with Jira's behaviour during the outages. [please note: from my perspective as an admin, the logs etc.. were fine, messages were geeky but could be interpreted, and no corruption of the database has occurred].\n\nOur end users, however, were confronted with error pages simply framed the Java exception (in all it's 'glory') no real attempt was made to clarify the situation to the user, just a very complex error message and a note to call the administrators.\n\nIn particular, when the dB was read-only, there was no problem viewing issues (which is good) but submitting issues only failed when the user had already entered all their data. Causing much irritation for some who had spent time entering detailed descriptions. Our only choices were to take Jira down altogether, or add a big red announcement banner (tm).\n\nWe appreciate that there is no easy technical fix for this, and that there will always be race conditions (Db goes down while user is editing etc..) that are hard to handle, but in situations where Jira relies on an potentially fallible external resource there is an opportunity to provide much more user-friendly error notification.",

It is after all only intended to provide users with an RSS view of the issues.  However, it would be useful if the existing XML link would allow you to get a comprehensive dump of the currently visible issues in XML, and select an XSLT transform to be applied to the XML.  The use case would be something like this:\n\n(1) User opens the issue navigator, performs appropriate filtering, then clicks the XML link.\n(2) Popup appears allowing the user to select from one of the registered XSLTs. \n(3) The selected transform is then applied to XML.\n\nThe default XSLTs might include GanttProject, and MS Project XML file formats.\n\nMaking it pluggable makes it possible for administrators to add their own XSLTs to support additional export formats.  These might include transforms that take JIRA issues and generate requirements documentation in XHTML or other formats.",

This is weird because when an issue gets to a certain state, it often has to be auto-assigned the The Guy In Charge first who will decide what to do next. (E.g. if an issue gets to \"To Be Regressed\", it should be assigned to QA Lead first (automatically), and then reassigned by the lead to a particular resource.)\n\nWhat would be nice to have from this standpoint is: \n\n- Capability to define a \"Default Member\" / \"Lead\" of a Group \n- A post-function to auto-assign issue to a Lead of specified Group (selected from a dropdown list) \n\nThe \"Assign to Group\" plugin does not qualify because it requires explicitly specifying the Group Lead in transition properties which's a maintenance problem. Defining users and groups must be located entirely in User Management section, else evey time a group lead is hired/fired, the admin would have to swicth workflows (which may take up to hours if the databse is big enough) and modify every certain transition to change the user defined there. \n",

In this case we set the Field to optional in the \"Field Configuration\". When the Issue follows a workflow path where the Issue will be fixed then the FixedVersion must be always required. Now we can make the Field value required in the \"Step Transition\" Validator but when a user selects a \"standard\" JIRA action (i.e. Edit) then the FixedVersion field is optional again and can be set to \"NUL\". The next step validation will fail because the field value is not set.\nActually it makes more sense to associate the Conditions,Validators and Functions with the \"Step\" because many \"Transitions\" can lead to a step, but the \"Step\" occurs only once. \"Transitions\" configurations that lead to the same \"Step\" are redundent if the configuration is defined in the Step. The \"Edit\" and \"Bulk Edit\" actions would then also refer to the configuration of the \"Step\". This would also solve the problem applying \"Conditions\" to the \"Create Issue\" action.\n ",
