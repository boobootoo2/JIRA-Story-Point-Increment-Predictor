As part of these changes we will add a button to all attachment cards to directly download the attachment. We expect these changes to be delivered to you in the next month.\r\n\r\nNote that in addition to improved attachment cards we are also actively working on bringing a list view to Jira's new issue view. This will provide an alternative way for you to find your attachments and will also include the ability to directly download an attachment: https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-70146\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\n\r\nAtlassian\r\n{panel}\r\nUsing the old issue view, when you click in the attachment using the key *Command* the file is downloaded automatically, however, this feature is not available in the new issue view.\r\n\r\nIt's important because sometimes the user just needs to download the file and don't want to wait for the loading of the preview.\r\n\r\nA button to download the single file under the thumbnail of the attachment would also help in this situation.\r\n\r\n{panel:title=Update 22 Nov 2019|borderStyle=solid|borderColor=#3399ff|titleBGColor=#3399ff|bgColor=#e0e0e0}\r\nFor big attachment files (over 8 MB) a Cloud icon is appears on the file allowing you to download it without having to preview the file.
