Namely, the closed window is still reported by the system API to enumerate windows [https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coregraphics/1455137-cgwindowlistcopywindowinfo]\u00a0\u2014 this causes havoc with the screen reader I use for accessibility purposes.\u00a0\r\n\r\nIt is also probably a contributor to gradually increasing memory footprint which I experience over several days as I keep opening and closing different repos. At around 1GB of memory usage I choose to relaunch the app, which while workable, is a pity.\u00a0\r\n\r\nA simple fix, assuming you are using NSWindows, would be to ensure that the NSWindow is released when the user closes the window, by configuring it as such and ensuring no spurious references exist to the window instances.\u00a0[https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nswindow/1419062-isreleasedwhenclosed]\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nif something else is being used, the fix would be the same in principle\u2014 release precious resources vended by the window server when user closes the window, to avoid abandoned memory piling up and to allow users with accessibility needs to better use Sourcetree.\r\n\r\nHappy to discuss further.",
