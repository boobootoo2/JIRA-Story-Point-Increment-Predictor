Instead you should consider using_ FE-3457 _in FishEye 2.6_\r\n\r\nOne of the missing options in the support toolbox is the ability to optimise the indexes of a FishEye instance.\r\n\r\nThe issue(s) with unoptimized indexes are that:\r\n* deleted entries will not be purged until the optimisation is [performed|http://wiki.apache.org/lucene-java/LuceneFAQ#If_I_decide_not_to_optimize_the_index.2C_when_will_the_deleted_documents_actually_get_deleted.3F], which have some performance impact when users with many repositories drop a large number of them (see [CRC-2107|https://support.atlassian.com/browse/CRC-2107]) \r\n* unoptimised indexes are slower for searching\r\n* and unoptimised indexes are larger (which, as Brendan remarked, results in larger backup zips)\r\n\r\nHowever, optimising is not trivial as it can double the number of opened files during optimisation, ([link|http://lucene.apache.org/java/2_9_0/api/core/org/apache/lucene/index/IndexWriter.html#optimize%28%29], if any IndexReader is opened during the optimisation step (which will happen if done inline, unless we block users to use the QuickNav or QuickSearch while the optimisation is being performed). So for this reason, I am implementing this as an offline FishEye command.\r\n\r\n\r\nIteration 2 would be to try to see if this can safely execute within a FishEye instance, for example as a Quartz job with an admin option to setup the time when it runs (with a default of 3am for example). Potentially this could do only a partial optimisation (possible with IndexWriter.optimize(maxSegmentToMerge)) and/or with limiting the memory size with [setRAMBufferSizeMB(double)|http://lucene.apache.org/java/2_9_0/api/core/org/apache/lucene/index/IndexWriter.html#setRAMBufferSizeMB(double)]. \r\n",
