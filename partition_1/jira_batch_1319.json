Problem Definition\r\n\r\nPer [Releases, teams and member assignments|https://confluence.atlassian.com/jiraportfolioserver/releases-teams-and-member-assignments-715262710.html], Portfolio will automatically assign backlog items suggested releases and teams/members, as long as there are defined estimates, teams, and releases.\r\n\r\n{quote}Once you have defined estimates, your teams and releases, you'll see that backlog items will automatically be assigned to suggested releases and teams/members. \r\n\r\nEverything that is assigned automatically, is depicted by a blue highlighting in the table: \r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\nThe automatic assignment of releases is based on the priority ranking of the backlog and the available capacities. Items are only assigned dynamically into releases if a release has a fixed end date. In this case, the scheduling algorithm tries to fit in as many high-priority items as possible into the release, until the target release date is reached.{quote}\r\n\r\nHowever, there is no option to disable the automatic assignment of suggested releases and team/members. Organizations with business/technical requirements who do not want this feature are unable to turn this off, and are forced to use the feature.\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n\r\n# Allow for automatic assignment of releases and team/members to be a setting that may be toggled on and off, at the plan level.\r\n# Allow for automatically assigned issues in the Timeline to be visually identified (with alternative colors, highlighting, or general appearance), to make it clear which issues in the timeline were not originally part of that release.\r\n\r\nh3. Why this is important\r\n \r\nThere exist usage cases where the automatic assignment of releases and teams/members would be undesirable. \r\n\r\nIn one specific example, the users would prefer if the issues were not automatically assigned, so that they did not get placed on the Timeline. This would allow for visual identification of how much spare margin there is left for teams to finish their work on their given release. Otherwise, teams cannot easily tell whether issues on the Timeline were originally assigned to their release, or if Portfolio has assigned the release for them.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround \r\n\r\nFor a board containing issues which are not assigned a release, create a _shadow_ board identical in configuration, but filter for only issues assigned to a release. This shadow board will not contain issues which do not have a release. \r\n\r\nCreate your portfolio plan based on this shadow board rather than the original board. This plan will not see the problem issues and will not be able to assign them the suggested releases, which will prevent them from appearing on the Timeline.\r\n",

Actual Results\r\nThe team of S2 shows in the UI as T1. \r\nHowever, a JQL search with {{Team = \"T1\" AND Team = \"T2\"}} returns the issue S2. \r\n \r\nh3. Notes\r\n* This problem can lead to subtasks appearing in two Portfolio boards/plans. \r\n* Converting S2 back to a task shows its team value is still set to T2. \r\n* The database value of the team for S2 (in the *entity_property* table) is not changed when converting it to a sub-task. \r\n\r\nh3.Workaround\r\n# Convert S2 back to a task. \r\n# Change its team manually. \r\n# Convert S2 to a subtask of S1.

Summary\r\n\r\nIf we have default resolution set in JIRA, committing issues though live plans causes the new tickets created in the process to have a Resolution Date, though no Resolution.\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Create a project\r\n # Create a Portfolio plan and add the project as an issue source\r\n # Go to Resolutions page in JIRA (type g+g >> resolutions, under [https://instance.atlassian.net/secure/admin/ViewResolutions.jspa])\r\n # Select a resolution as default\r\n # Add an issue to the plan\r\n # Commit it so it's created in JIRA\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nThe ticket is created without Resolution Date, as it doesn't have a resolution.\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nIt's created with no Resolution (as expected), but with a Resolution Date (not expected):\r\n !resolution_problem.png|thumbnail!\r\nh3. Workarounds\r\n{panel}\r\nh4. Workaround 1: no default resolution\r\n\r\nDon't make use of default resolution until you can upgrade to a fixed version.\r\n Clearing the default resolution on the Resolutions admin page's blocked by JRASERVER-70041, so to clear it you may:\r\n # Create a new Resolution temporarily\r\n # Set this new Resolution to be default\r\n # Delete the new Resolution\r\n\r\nh4. Workaround 2: tweak the workflows (suggested in comments below)\r\n # Change the 'Create' transition for this issue\r\n # Add a post-function to clear the 'resolution' (not resolution date)\r\n ** This should also clean the resolution date\r\n\r\nh4. Workaround 3: create issues in Jira\r\n # Create issues directly through Jira, rather than Portfolio. This should avoid the problem.{panel}",
