Empty body success responses are supposed to use code 204 -- http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html\n* An empty body is an invalid JSON response, this not being allowed.\n* If it is an authentication failure, this MUST return a 401 or 403 code.\n* This is not a real authentication failure because we are 100% sure that the credentials are right (using basic_auth).\n* If the server is not able to respond due to other causes it MUST reply with a 503 code and optionally with a Retry-After header that tell the client when to retry the request.\n\nAs stated above this bug uncovers several serious HTTP standard deviations, probably caused by several broken pieces of code.\n\nIt may be useful not remark this response header and the fact that, so far, all reports were happening while using basic_auth\n\n     'x-seraph-loginreason': 'OUT, AUTHENTICATED_FAILED'\n\nAtlassian support suggested, as a temporary workaround, to use alternative authentication options. Still our tests proved that other auth ways are even more prone to fail. Also BASIC_AUTH is documented in several places as the recommended authentication to use with REST, that being one of the reasons we call it *REST*.\n",

This is because only *Project Administrators* can create Versions and Components in the first place.\n\nOne of the features which is going to be implemented by JRA-3156 would be for other roles (eg. Project Developers) to create Versions. This would mean that these roles should be able to create versions 'On the Fly' as well.\n\nSince other roles can create versions 'On the Fly' it would be great to have an option to define exactly which roles can perform this and which can't.\n\nFor example, if I give Project Developers the ability the create versions, it would be because I (as administrator) am not the one which needs to create them.

I'm extending my extension for the google chrome browser called *jironimo*. Problem I have is that too often JIRA replies with 500 status to a linked ajax query. For example: I'm searching and getting 100 issues and then I'm doing *mypermissions* call for each of them. The purpose is to show the \"play\" button(time-log feature) icon. (reproducible on different JIRA instances)\n\nWhat I've tried to google is how to get *mypermissions* data withing the *search* call. Something like this: &expand=mypermissions, which is eq. to: mypermissions?issueId=SearchResultIssueId. But I didn't manage to find it. \n\nCould you complete one of them:\n1. Improve the docs, add this section to the rest API if there is an option.\n2. Implement this functionality if possible.\n\nThe positive sides for JIRA project:\n1. Less calls to the REST API\n2. More logical output of a search result entry\n\nThank you!",

But since we're stuck with the new one, at least for the time being, I'd like to suggest one specific, simple improvement:\n\nCurrently, when clicking on any of the menu items (Dashboards, Projects, Issues etc) there's a bit of a lag, and then the menu drops down with a list of options. Only then is one able to get to the desired destination. It drives me absolutely nuts.\n\nInstead, it would be great if a single click on any of those menu items sent me straight to the last page/view I was viewing within that context. If I want the list instead, I either do a mouseover or hit the arrow.\n\nExample #1: A click on \"Dashboards\" would get me straight to the last dashboard i was viewing.\n\nExample #2: A click on \"Issues\" would get me straight to the last filter view\n\nExample #2: A click on \"Projects\" would get me straight to the last project I was viewing.\n\nThis tiny fix would make navigating the new menu bar UI so much easier.",

I would like to be able to create workflows that have approval steps requiring approval from multiple users. For example in an issue type 'product change request' the workflow might require an approval from at least one user in the QA management group, at least one user in the Engineering group, at least on user in the production management group, and the CEO. For another issue type 'QC procedure change' the workflow might require an approval stage only requiring one user in the QA management group. This would really extend the useful capabilities of Jira OnDemand and make it useful to our organisation. In fact as a recent subscriber to the OnDemand service I am surprised and a bit disappointed not to find this level of functionality.\n\nI left this comment on issue JRA-6182 but as that is a very old issue and was generated in relation to an older installed version of JIRA i though it sensible to create the issue afresh.\n\nI notice that the issue has been resolved for customers using the installed version of JIRA via an add-on \"Group Sign-Off for JIRA\". If I had known this at the time of starting to use JIRA I would have probably progressed down the installed route...",

The link take them to apage not found error on https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/AOD/JIRA+OnDemand?utm_campaign=qAwr63Ru&utm_medium=navbar&utm_source=inproduct. Even though the correct link is directly below this error it has already caused a bit of confusion with some evaluators.\n\nThanks!\n\nMarian",

This is not needed and is very annoying to remove manually. Further, if one of these CLONED Stories are CLONED, then the prefix, CLONE - CLONE is created.\n\nWe would like to have the setting for no need for the Subtasks to add the word, \"CLONED\".\n\nThis used to be available with an addon called Clone Plus, but I do not see that this addon is available for Jira On Demand.\n\nPlease fix Jira On Demand for our site to not add the prefix.\nOur site is ntt-innovation.atlassian.net\n\nThanks",

However, according to AOD-41704, this feature is not available in OnDemand instances because it uses crowd for user management (and not \"internal directory with LDAP Authentication\" / \"delegated LDAP\"). Therefore, it is only available in JIRA Standalone. \n\nThis would be helpful as an attribute for any user, whether it is using Crowd or for separate instances as it provides a much cleaner approach to administrators to turning off users if they are not able to delete them; often, the latter is not possible as most contribute at least once within the product. \n\nCurrently, in OnDemand, a user must remove the application links, change the user's password, and change the email address to something else (we put it as an invalid email).   It would be cleaner and safer, from a security standpoint to avoid missing a step, if inactivation were available and it guaranteed that the user could not login and they would not receive emails associated with any watches or subscriptions they have.  The latter is a huge security hole if information is shared that the user should not have access to. ",

However, when I export my issues to excel, for some reason the old Logo still appears. Can someone please explain where the logo file is held for excel or any other exports from JIRA so I can amend accordingly?\n\nThanks\nJp",

However, it does not work. I meant, I'm able to close the issue and it is not taking into the account the condition we set up in the link.\n\nWe tried deactivating and activating again the link option (thinking in service clouding issue that may be), but same results.\n\nWe need to have a quick response from your since our developers are closing tasks without that option and we need it. \n\nThank you in advance, Looking for a response,\nJavier",
