If there are more issues than the number configured to fit in the box, you need to click to view the next pages(s).

Sometimes other parts of the issue like the Description, etc. are included even when they haven't changed.\n\nIdeally it would be helpful to be able to filter when the change notification is because either a comment, the description or the assignee has changed.\n\nAlso, it would be helpful to detect whether the version that an issue has been moved to matches a particular condition (i.e. an issue has been moved into an iteration).\n\nThis probably isn't a Studio enhancement (or maybe it is), but may actually be a JIRA enhancement.  But it would really help us better manage the email volume.\n\nThanks!",

It has happened where something gets moved last minute without my knowledge we end up releasing the incorrect code.\nI have asked my boss to inform me when this happens, but he continues to do this anyway.  My goal is to detect when he moves tickets in or out of the current fixVersion, so all the proper docs and commits can be updated appropriately.  \n\nTo that end, here is what I've attempted:\nI have created 3 saved filters all based on fixVersions.\nHere are the queries for the filters:\nfixVersion=10236 AND status=Open\nfixVersion IS NULL AND status=Open\nfixVersion=10237 AND status=Open\n\nThose filters are saved as requestIds 10228, 10229, and 10230 respectively.\n\nFrom these, I have created the following rss feeds:\nhttps://myCompany.jira.com/sr/jira.issueviews:searchrequest-rss/10228/SearchRequest-10228.xml?os_authType=basic\nhttps://myCompany.jira.com/sr/jira.issueviews:searchrequest-rss/10229/SearchRequest-10229.xml?os_authType=basic\nhttps://myCompany.jira.com/sr/jira.issueviews:searchrequest-rss/10230/SearchRequest-10230.xml?os_authType=basic\n\nI've imported these feeds into Thunderbird 2 and 3, and see all the issues currently in each fixVersion.\n\nTo test the feeds, I edit an issue with fixVersion 10236 so that it's fixVersion is now 'Unknown'.  The feed based on filter 10229 updates with a new item, as expected. Next I test the opposite case, where an item currently has fixVersion NULL and edit it to be 10236; the feed for filter 10228 is not updated with the new issue.\n\nI also tested changing the fixVersion from 10236 to 10237 and again there was no notification. \n\nI only received notifications when issues were moved into fixVersion NULL.\n\nMy company is using Jira Studio 2.3\n",

This is either from editing the assignee field via Edit Screen or Inline editing in Issue view. Some user do not want to receive the notification when the issue is updated, but want to receive notification when the assignee field is updated. If a user use the inline editing or edit the assignee in the Edit screen, the user would not receive notification but the user is expecting a notification.\n\nI think this relates to [JRA-26898|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRA-26898], since the bulk assigning issue is currently triggering the Issue Updated Event and not Issue Assigned Event.

They advised me to bring it to your attention as an opportunity to improve security.\n\nSummary:\n{quote}\nSome web frameworks collapse the POST and GET parameters into a single collection. This is a flawed design pattern from a security standpoint. If a page accepts POST parameters as GET parameters an attacker would be able to effect change on websites through Cross-Site Request Forgery or leverage this design flaw with other vulnerabilities to attack the system hosting the web application. POST variables and GET variables should be distinct and no attempt to collapse to two collections should occur.\n{quote}\n\nAn example showing how to demonstrate the issue:\nInput: {quote}\nGET /login.jsp?atl_token&os_username=12345&os_password=foo&os_cookie=true&os_destination=%2fsecure%2fDashboard.jspa&login=Log%20In HTTP/1.1\nReferer: https://ourJira.local:443/login.jsp\nAccept: */*\nPragma: no-cache\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)\nHost: ft-jira.mattersight.net\nX-Scan-Memo: Category=\"Audit\"; Function=\"createStateRequestFromAttackDefinition\"; SID=\"FBF9E4FEE5C7BA725AF21068F08BDAF6\"; PSID=\"280981CE8E66BF997A623A77CC318FFD\"; SessionType=\"AuditAttack\"; CrawlType=\"None\"; AttackType=\"Other\"; OriginatingEngineID=\"8ca14a29-1566-423d-b9f8-f46aa279ec29\"; AttackSequence=\"0\"; AttackParamDesc=\"\"; AttackParamIndex=\"0\"; AttackParamSubIndex=\"0\"; CheckId=\"10655\"; Engine=\"Form+Accepts+GET+Variables\"; Retry=\"False\"; SmartMode=\"NonServerSpecificOnly\"; ThreadId=\"55\"; ThreadType=\"AuditDBReaderSessionDrivenAudit\"; \nConnection: Keep-Alive\nCookie: CustomCookie=WebInspect78498ZX4A2C8EB0ABD54C51AC87E7A4AB6BBC75Y3A46;atlassian.xsrf.token=BOKD-JKJB-95MZ-P5IW|b6c98b43b2686e19d437215c8d0bdc6d5054a134|lout;JSESSIONID=072444395FA06364137381BBBF290A43\n{quote}\n\nResponse:\n{quote}\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nServer: Apache-Coyote/1.1\nX-AREQUESTID: 1310x84951x8\nX-ASESSIONID: 13aee16\nCache-Control: no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate\nPragma: no-cache\nExpires: Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 GMT\nX-Seraph-LoginReason: AUTHENTICATED_FAILED\nX-AUSERNAME: anonymous\nContent-Type: text/html;charset=UTF-8\nDate: Thu, 19 Apr 2012 20:50:29 GMT\nContent-Length: 7751\n\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n...\n{quote}",

It would be useful, and a huge time saver, to be able to bulk update the field configuration.\n\nFor instance, I would like to checkbox select all fields on a field configuration and then Hide them. Then select several to show.\n\nPerhaps there is a better way, I'm ready for ideas [~rkrishna]!\n\nThanks,\nNick",

The current functionality edits and saves each field individually as it is edited, and the edit is triggered via a single click which results in unanticipated changes to fields and user confusion.\n\nMy Suggestion to resolve this is as follows:\n# Enter Inline Edit mode by double clicking on a field that can be edited.\n# Once in Inline Edit mode, allow subsequent fields to be edited via a single click.\n# Once editing is complete, user must click a Save button on the issue to commit all changes at the same time.\n\nThese changes will prevent users from accidentally changing fields on an issue while still keeping it easy to change multiple fields.  Then the single Save button which will commit all changes will then also prevent multiple Issue Updated Events from being triggered and flooding users with emails.  This also has some added benefits such as allowing plugins the ability to tap into that save function in order to validate fields and also enable field dependencies.\n\nPlease vote!",

By doing so it saves all fields which came from the original create event therefore overriding the assignee with 'admin' again\n\nThere's no way to guarantee ordering of events so this is hard to work around.  I think this can also lead to concurrent edit issues:\n* User fred comments on issue\n* User barney edits issue priority to 'Critical'\n* Autowatch listener handles fred commented event and increases watchers. At the same time it overrides barney's priority edit with the original priority.\n\nTo fix this we should change the AutoWatch plugin to either use JIRA's issueManager.updateIssue() which does the correct thing, or at the very least create an updateGV copy with *only* the fields that have to be updated in the DB.",

By default, Road Map, Change Log and Versions tab panels will be visible if at least a version is created on the project. \n\nHowever, there are times that the Road Map, Change Log, and Versions project tab panels still not visible despite having a version on the project. This is usually because the \ufeffFix version/s field is configure as hidden or the Road Map Panel, Change Log Panel, and Versions Panel plugin has been disabled in Project Panels Plugin.\n{quote}\n\nThis will at least notify customer that a version is required for the tab panels to be displayed on the first place.\n\nHope this is clear enough, thanks :)",
