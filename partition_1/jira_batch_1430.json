      "description": "According to [Crowd's documentation on {{crowd.properties}}|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/CROWD/The+crowd.properties+file], here is the definition of Crowd Server URL and Base URL:\r\n* Server URL: The URL to use when connecting with the integration libraries to communicate with the Crowd server.\r\n* Base URL: The URL used by Crowd to create the full URL to be sent to users that reset their passwords.\r\n\r\nHowever, this is not the case. Crowd uses Base URL when integrating with Confluence, JIRA or other applications that use {{crowd.properties}} file.\r\n\r\nh4. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# [Set up Confluence SSO integration with Crowd|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/CROWD/Overview+of+SSO] (or other Atlassian application like JIRA)\r\n# Ensure that the SSO is working fine by logging into Confluence. Check if you are automatically logged into Crowd.\r\n# Stop Confluence\r\n# Open {{crowd.properties}} in {{<confluence-install>/confluence/WEB-INF/classes}}\r\n# Change {{crowd.base.url}} to an incorrect URL that is not accessible\r\n\r\nh4. Expected Results\r\nUser can still log into Confluence without any problems, since Crowd is using Server URL \r\n\r\nh4. Actual Results\r\nUser is *not* able to log into Confluence at all. Try to set an incorrect {{crowd.server.url}} and *correct* {{crowd.base.url}}. The result is that: user is able to log into Confluence\r\n\r\nh4. Environment Information\r\nTested on Crowd 2.6.2 and Confluence 5.1.3 (SSO)\r\n\r\nh4. Findings\r\nI have done some more investigation by doing remote debugging. Here are the steps:\r\n# [Set up Confluence SSO integration with Crowd|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/CROWD/Overview+of+SSO] (or other Atlassian application like JIRA)\r\n# Prepare the Crowd source code for remote debugging in Intellij or Eclipse with port 5008 \r\n# Open {{ClientPropertiesImpl.java}} in {{atlassian-crowd/components/crowd-integration-client-common/src/main/java/com/atlassian/crowd/service/client/}}\r\n# Add a new breakpoint at line 126, which contains this code:\r\n{code}String baseURL = loadPropertyString(properties, Constants.PROPERTIES_FILE_BASE_URL);{code}\r\n# Enable remote debugging in Confluence by adding the following JAVA args in {{setenv.bat}} or {{setenv.sh}}\r\n{code}-Xdebug -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=5008 {code}\r\n# Restart Confluence\r\n# As soon as Confluence starts, run the Crowd debugging in IntelliJ/Eclipse. Confluence will load {{crowd.properties}} during the startup\r\n\r\nHere's the code that we are interested in:\r\n{code:java}\r\n    private String loadBaseURL(Properties properties)\r\n    {\r\n        String baseURL = loadPropertyString(properties, Constants.PROPERTIES_FILE_BASE_URL);\r\n        if (StringUtils.isBlank(baseURL))\r\n        {\r\n            baseURL = generateBaseURL(properties);\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        return StringUtils.removeEnd(baseURL, \"/\");\r\n    }\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nAs you can see from the above code (and also I can see this during remote debugging), that the Base URL is loaded first. It is only when the Base URL is *empty* that the Server URL is then used. This does not match with the documentation description as mentioned above.\r\n",

      "description": "h3. Description\r\nThis issue has been assigned CVE-2013-3925 by Mitre Corporation.\r\nPreviously reported issue CVE-2012-2926 (August 2012, CVSS score 6.4) was patched by introducing a new XFire servlet component into Crowd. The new component disables external entity resolution during XML parsing.\r\nThe new component has been configured to work for URLs with pattern /crowd/services/ but does not intercept calls to /crowd/services/2/ (etc). \r\n\r\nh3. Scope\r\nAn successful attack requires direct access to Crowd REST interface. As a result, only standalone Crowd servers are affected. \r\n\r\nA common configuration where an internal Crowd server is used by an Internet-facing Confluence, JIRA or other products is not vulnerable to an attack from the Internet.\r\n\r\nh3. Fix\r\nPlease upgrade Crowd to 2.5.4 or 2.6.3. The issue has been resolved in these versions.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\nFor older versions of Crowd there is a patched version of xfire-servlet.xml available attached to this ticket. It needs to replace the existing one inside a jar in your installation. See [here|https://confluence.atlassian.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=376836952] for instructions for how to apply the patch.\r\n\r\nIf you use Web Application Firewalls, Apache ACLs or similar technology, you can filter access to {{/crowd/services}}.\r\n\r\nh3. Patching Instructions moved up here from comment as comment is collapsed.\r\nh3. Patch instructions\r\nAs well as the Fix Versions, this can be patched in older versions if you are unable to upgrade. The fix requires replacing the {{xfire-servlet.xml}} file in the {{crowd-server}} jar. \r\n\r\nh4. Patching\r\nThe corrected version of the file can be used with Crowd 2.3.7, 2.4.1 or any 2.5 or 2.6 release. See {{xfire-servlet.xml}} attached to this issue.\r\n\r\nFor example, for Crowd 2.4.2:\r\n{noformat}\r\nzip -u atlassian-crowd-2.4.2/crowd-webapp/WEB-INF/lib/crowd-server-2.4.2.jar xfire-servlet.xml\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nOr you can simply copy the attached [xfire-servlet.xml|https://jira.atlassian.com/secure/attachment/94422/xfire-servlet.xml] to {{crowd-webapp/WEB-INF/classes}}, followed by a Crowd restart.\r\n\r\nh4. Older versions\r\nWith versions 2.1.2 or 2.2.9, unzip the file and manually edit it to remove all {{urlMap}} entries other than the first {{key=\"/*\"}} entry:\r\n\r\n{code:lang=none}\r\n     <bean class=\"org.springframework.web.servlet.handler.SimpleUrlHandlerMapping\">\r\n         <property name=\"urlMap\">\r\n             <map>\r\n                 <entry key=\"/*\" value-ref=\"securityServerService\"/>\r\n-                <entry key=\"/1/*\" value-ref=\"securityServerService\"/>\r\n-                <entry key=\"/2/*\" value-ref=\"securityServerService2\"/>\r\n-                <entry key=\"/latest/*\" value-ref=\"securityServerService2\"/>\r\n             </map>\r\n         </property>\r\n     </bean>\r\n{code}\r\n\r\n{panel}\r\n*We have documented a security notice regarding this matter at - [Crowd Security Notice 2013-07-01|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/CROWD/Crowd+Security+Notice+2013-07-01]*\r\n{panel}",

If there was a maximum session duration, you could require that every 24 hours a user's session is killed, and thus they need to re-authentication, thus plugging a potential security hole of abusing idle session timeout durations.\r\n\r\nIf we could rely on CrowdID requiring a fresh login every set period of time, we would be able to pass our internal security reviews more easily and move forward with implementation.\r\n\r\nOriginally discussed in CWDSUP-7882 \r\n",

CWD-3323\r\n\r\nNow, we tried to workaround this by writing a Crowd plugin which would email users upon UserUpdatedEvents.\r\n\r\nThis works well when the attribute requiresPasswordChange is updated via the web console of Crowd; but it does not when the user tries to login in Jira and the attribute is updated in Crowd (the event is not generated)\r\n\r\nSo basically, events are not generated when a user is updated by Crowd itself to respect directory rules. Our plugin will never work and we will resort to writing a DB trigger (which is not really the best here but the only remaining option we have until the Crowd team does something)\r\n\r\nCould you check the missing spots in Crowd where events should be generated ?

As the issue hasn't collect votes, watchers, comments, or support cases from many customers during its lifetime, it's very low on our priority list, and will not be fixed in the foreseeable future. That's why we've decided to resolve it as *Timed Out*.\r\n\r\nAlthough we're aware the issue is still important to those of you who were involved in the conversations around it, we want to be clear in managing your expectations. The Crowd team is focusing on issues that have broad impact and high value, reflected by the number of comments, votes, support cases, and customers interested. Please consult the [Atlassian Bugfix Policy|https://confluence.atlassian.com/support/atlassian-server-bug-fix-policy-201294573.html] for more details.\r\n\r\nWe understand how disappointing this decision may be, but we hope you'll appreciate our transparent approach and communication.\r\n\r\nAtlassian will continue to watch this issue for further updates, so please feel free to share your thoughts in the comments.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nCrowd Team\r\n{panel}",
