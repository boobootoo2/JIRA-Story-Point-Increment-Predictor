Since I already had a list of all 60 projects, it only took a minute to write a regular expression to build the 60 SQL Insert statements.\r\n\r\nIn order to create the 130 repositories I had to discover (the hard way) that repositories are not registered in the database, instead they are kept in an XML file. I used a similar approach: I had a list of the repository URLs I wanted to create, with their usernames, passwords, etc. With about 5 minutes of regular expressions I was able to build the XML that would register these repositories, I pasted it into the XML config file, restarted FishEye and bang! 130 repositories registered successfully.\r\n\r\nIf this was an ideal world, I would like to be able to create these hundreds of repositories by uploading a CSV or something like that. Also, I would find it useful if I could create Application links to both JIRA and Confluence, right now I have no choice but to link each of the 60 projects and each of the 130 repositories by hand, that's two links times 190 items!",

During that time fisheye decided to rename all of the users that had been moved out of fisheye-users as username_old1.  Then when it saw the users in fisheye-users group again, it created new users.\r\n\r\nIt might be best if Fisheye/crucible would only move users in/out of groups and never rename them.",
