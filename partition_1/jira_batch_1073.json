The rollout should take a day or two to propagate to all tenants. More details can be found here:\u00a0[https://community.atlassian.com/t5/Jira-articles/Announcement-Microsoft-Oauth-for-incoming-emails-on-Jira/ba-p/1504721#M3421]\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n\r\nArjoon Som\r\n Product Manager, Jira Cloud\r\n{panel}\r\n\u00a0\r\nh3. Problem Definition\r\n\r\nOffice 365 is planning to discontinue support for basic auth on services like POP and IMAP on October 13, 2020. As of today, basic auth (username and password) via IMAP/POP is the only way to make Jira able to use an Office 365 mailbox for receiving email. More details about the upcoming changes to Microsoft's products can be found in [https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/office/blogs/end-of-support-for-basic-authentication-access-to-exchange-online-apis-for-office-365-customers/]\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nImplement some other method of allowing Jira to authenticate to an office 365 mailbox, such as OAuth2.\r\nh3. Why this is important\r\n\r\nWithout this feature, regular office 365 accounts won't permit applications like Jira to connect to them. It seems that the ProPlus accounts might still permit this after the set date, however it seems clear that improving security is the goal of this forced change, and perhaps it would benefit Jira to follow suit.\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nNone currently, if one should become available this will be updated to reflect that state.",

You can save the query as it is (either with filter = Incidents, or filter = \"Incidents\"), and the search will work:\r\n !Screen Shot 2019-10-22 at 11.28.02.png|thumbnail! \r\n* Create a pie chart, and use the filter you've created on it. Save the preferences.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nThe gadget will display the results.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nNo results are displayed.\r\n\r\nInstead, an error message with an error 500 is displayed:\r\n{code}\r\nUnfortunately, one or more of your preferences are now unavailable. Please update your preferences, or remove gadget by clicking delete from the title bar above.\r\n\r\nfilterId should not be null!\r\n500\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nInstead of using the name of the filter in the query, replace it by its id.\r\n\r\nYou can get the id of a filter by one of the following ways:\r\n* REST API: https://yourinstance.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/filter/search will return the list of filters, including their ids;\r\n**  *rest/api/3/filter/my* will return the ones you own.\r\n* If you hover over a filter, you will see an URL displaying its id in the end:\r\n !hover_over.png|thumbnail! \r\n* Accessing a filter will give you the id in the address bar as well:\r\n !access.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\nIn my case, the filter query would change from *filter = Incidents* to *filter = 10107*.",

Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Navigate to an Issue and load the issue\r\n # From the har file we could notice some slowness when javascript resources loaded from the frontend and CloudFront.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nNavigating to an issue should render quickly by optimizing the javascript resource loaded from the frontend and CloudFront and should be consistent as that page is being cached.\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nOpening an issue tends to be slow, in some case it might take from *10 seconds* or *> 10 seconds* for a page that already caches from the browser during a hard reload and cacheless reload.\r\nh3. Notes\r\n\r\nDue to the slowness in rendering the Javascript resources from frontend/CloudFront, the slowness is actually the same across the issue view (new and old). In most case, here we could see some latency when the browser retrieving the javascript resources particular from the endpoint below:\r\n * [https://jira-frontend-prod-eu-2.eu-central-1.prod.public.atl-paas.net/]\r\n * [https://cloudfront.net|/]\r\n\r\nSo in this situation, the On load event can jump to 9.82 seconds to load a page with 21.1MB which is not really optimal in this case since the time to retrieve the javascript prolonged and this caused some latency from the frontend/CloudFront in parsing resources and the time primarily spent in downloading and parsing JS resources.\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nCurrently, there is no known workaround for this behavior. A workaround will be added here when available\r\n\r\n",

      "description": "h3. \u00a0\r\n{panel:title=Aug 15, 2020: New navigation has been rolled out and the old navigation has been removed}\r\nThe new navigation has been fully rolled out for all Jira Cloud customers. The old navigation has been permanently replaced and will no longer be available for users to switch back to.\r\n\r\nWhile we feel the changes will be intuitive and easy to pick up, you are welcomed to refer to our official help documentation here:\u00a0[https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirasoftwarecloud/new-jira-cloud-navigation-983502691.html]\r\n\r\nThank you to everyone who's shared their feedback and thoughts. Our team has moved on to work on other areas and we are no longer actively monitoring this issue. To provide feedback,\u00a0please use the Give feedback link in the Help menu.\r\n{panel}\r\n\u00a0\r\nh3. What are we doing?\r\n\r\nWe're in the process of redesigning Jira's navigation (for Jira Software, Jira Service Desk and Jira Core)\u00a0to help you find and access your work more quickly & efficiently. Here's a sneak peek of what it might look like:\r\n\r\n!Next-gen service desk (sneak peek).png|thumbnail! \u00a0 !Next-gen software (sneak peek).png|thumbnail!\r\nh3. Why are we making this change?\r\n\r\nOver the last couple of years, we have heard from numerous customers of their challenges with our current navigation sidebar UI, around navigation, findability, and accessing their work in Jira and Confluence. As a result, our team is now working on an improved navigation UI to better meet the needs of our diverse customer base.\r\nh3. What to expect next?\r\n\r\nTo keep you as informed as possible, we'll be using this public issue to communicate the progress of our work and also collect missing features in the form of subtasks. As features become available, we'll update the subtasks to let you know what's changed.\r\n\r\nIf you would like to try an early exploration, you may download & install our [Chrome extension|https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/atlassian-navigation-exte/flioipdmdipioibnnoekkadfcoelelil]. Please note that the extension is no longer being actively developed on.\r\nh3. Frequently asked questions\r\n # *When will my instance receive the new navigation?*\r\n We will start rolling out the new navigation in the first quarter of 2020.\u00a0The rollout will take several months and we will send you an email as well as in-app notifications reminding you before your instance is selected for rollout.\r\n # *I\u2019m an admin of an instance and I will need to communicate this change to my teams. Where can I go to get more information?*\r\n In addition to the emails we've sent to Jira Cloud admins, we've also published [official documentation here|https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirasoftwarecloud/new-jira-cloud-navigation-983502691.html].\r\n # *I\u2019m an admin of an instance and I need more time to communicate this change to my teams. Can I be excluded from the initial rollout?*\r\n Yes. If you would like to be temporarily exempt from the rollout, please\u00a0[contact our Support team|https://support.atlassian.com/contact/#/]. Please note that this exclusion will only be temporary. Once the rollout is completed in early 2020 you will be given notice and prompted to switch over to the new navigation.\r\n # *How will my users toggle on/off the new navigation?*\r\n Once we\u2019ve started rolling out the experience, you and your instance\u2019s users will be able to individually toggle on/off the experience by going to the user profile and clicking \u201c_Turn off the new navigation._\u201d\u00a0 !How to opt out of new nav.png!\r\n # *I've signed up for the Early Access Program. Will all my users get the new navigation by default?*\u00a0\r\n The new navigation will be OFF by default. Once it is made available for your instance, every individual user will need to opt-in and toggle it on.\u00a0  !How users can opt-in.jpg|width=382,height=205! \u00a0\r\n # *Where are Boards? Why don't they appear in the top navigation?*\r\n We don\u2019t plan to add boards to the main navigation bar in Jira Cloud. The main reason for this is to clarify the relationship between projects and boards. We create issues in a project, and boards are one of several ways to\u00a0_view_\u00a0those issues, along with the backlog, queues, and the issue navigator. From this perspective, it makes sense to navigate to a project that shows the various ways you can view and work on issues, including boards. Boards\u00a0_can_\u00a0show issues from multiple projects, but the vast majority show issues from a single project.\r\n # *How will I get to my Boards if it doesn't appear in the top navigation?*\r\n The quickest way from anywhere in Jira is by clicking the search field (or pressing / on your keyboard). You\u2019ll see recent boards, projects, and filters in the bottom half of the search panel. We also recommend starring boards so you can quickly find them by going to\u00a0*Your work*\u00a0>\u00a0*Starred*. When you\u2019re in a project, you can also use the board switcher in the sidebar. Click the board name and choose a board or type in its name.\r\n # *Will the new navigation be available on all Atlassian products?*\r\n Jira Cloud and Confluence Cloud are the only products confirmed to have the new navigation in 2020. There are no commitments at this point for any of our other Cloud products (Bitbucket, Opsgenie, Statuspage, Trello, etc) to be adopting this experience. Server and Datacenter products will remain as-is.\u00a0\r\n # *Will the new (horizontal) navigation completely replace the old (vertical) navigation at some point?*\r\n Yes, but not straight away. And while we\u2019re in the process of rolling out the new navigation, you\u2019re free to switch back and forth between the two. Once we\u2019ve fully rolled out the new navigation, we\u2019ll begin the process of removing the old navigation, but we\u2019ll let you know before we remove it. We strongly believe our improved navigation will make it easier to use Jira Cloud. The clear labels; quick access to projects, filters, and dashboards; and fewer clicks to move between screens are just a few of the reasons why we think it\u2019ll make navigation easier.\r\n\r\n_*Note:*\u00a0What is and isn't a distinct feature can be tricky to define, especially in something as involved as the navigation. We'll do our best to capture things as accurately and comprehensively as possible._",

Issue Summary\r\nIt is worth noting that a lot of Performance issues tends to rise in and out of using Jira's Old and New Issue view. All these may be as a result of many of factors, however there's some particular behaviour that occurs sparingly for some users whereby out of a sudden Jira New Issue view tends to become slower compared to the Old Issue view, sometimes it happens in reserve etc.\r\n\r\nh3. Environment\r\nJira Cloud\r\n\r\n(If Applicable view Point)\r\n* Project view\r\n* Issue View\r\n* Board View\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # login to your instance https://<your-instance>.atlassian.net\r\n # Navigate to a Project\r\n# Try to view an Issue within that Project or from the Board view, given that you have the most basic filter e.g. project = ABC ORDER BY Rank DESC\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nNavigating to an issue should render quickly in a considerable amount of time e.g. https://<your-instance>.atlassian.net/browse/ABC-123 within 4-5 seconds and should be consistent as that page is being cached.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nNavigating to an issue tends to be slow, in some cases it might be a basic issue and the load time tends to be longer e.g. https://<your-instance>.atlassian.net/browse/ABC-123 ranging from *10 seconds* or *> 20 seconds* even though the page has been visited all over with CPU thread increasing especially when multiple tabs are concurrently opened.\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Notes\r\nDue to this inconsistency, in some cases, the slowness are actually the same across issue view (new and old). First of all when an issue is loaded \"the issue title and description are loaded first nearly instantly, but the sections for comments and everything else are loading for a few seconds. And while they are loading CPU usage jumps to 100% and on the Dev console you can notice too many \"long running task\" being captured with difference ranging from *ms* to *seconds*.\r\n\r\nOther examples, lies with the Browser being used - you can notice that in some instances, Chrome tends to consume more CPU thread than Firefox. When loading a simple issue, the CPU thread can spike up really fast especially when multiple tabs are running and the issue that are opened contains an attachment.\r\n\r\nExplaining further this factor, out of the many request that are being called when the issue view is loading, they encounter latency, buffering, congestion etc that causes the Javascript resources to pause and block, making it seem like a Javascript issue when in reality it is not, resulting in the pages load taking much longer than usual.\r\n\r\nIn some situation The TTFB (Time to First Byte) values might be quite low towards a fully loaded page  which might take up to 20 seconds and you might see some Javascript and CSS resources that took 4-5 seconds and they are only 100KB-800KB sizes files.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\n This behaviour seems to vary\r\n* In some conditions, switching to the *New Issue View* becomes faster to render a page (Probably due to *_SPA_* and *_SSR_* working in pairs)\r\n* In some other conditions, switching to the Old Issue View seems faster to load or have no performance related issues at all.\r\n* Other conditions, would be having a *_Quad Core_* device rather than a *_Dual Core_* device.(based on CPU thread spiking sparingly at various intervals)\r\n* Changing Browsers (From *Chrome* to *Firefox*) might alleviate the situation",
