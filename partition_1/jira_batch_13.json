I had to download and install it myself.)\r\n\r\n*Update:* It _almost_ fixed the issue. If I minimize the main window by clicking on the Minimize button, yes, I _can_ restore the window by clicking on its icon in the taskbar. However, I _cannot_ restore the window by using the WIN+# shortcut key. Also, _after_ I restore the window by clicking on it, I _cannot_ again minimize the window by clicking on the taskbar icon.\r\n\r\nMy guess is that the Sourcetree app is trying to do something clever with minimize/restore and, in the process, has broken the native Windows functionality that every Windows app has by default. My recommendation is to stop trying to do something clever by inserting code into the normal Windows event chain. In my, rather long, experience, this never works out well, causes never-ending bugs, and is, therefore, more trouble than it's worth.",

      "description": "Many of our company teammates are using the SourceTree as the Git client and it is pretty good in overall.\r\n\r\nBut\u00a0regarding the tagging function, we're having a very annoying problem.\r\n\r\nNormally we don't make a tag manually by each individual but the CI system makes some tags automatically when a new build is created.\r\n\r\nBefore we settled down with an agreed convention on tag naming, there were some experimentally created tags and\u00a0we wanted to clear them out in order not to make an unwanted confusion. It looked just a\u00a0simple straight forward thing, and removing them from the server and my local working copy was actually done easily.\r\n\r\nHowever, since the Git is a distributed system the old wrong tags were already existed in\u00a0other coworker's local repositories and\u00a0+because the default status of \"*Push all tags*\" option is '*Checked*'+, those old tags were revived so many times when someone didn't sync their local tag with the remote server and pushed his/her commit with this option on, as the people didn't pay much attention on this option\u00a0status and neither understand correctly what its impact is.\r\n\r\nIf once this situation happened we had to announce repeatedly to make sure this option is turned off and to sync their local working copy tags.\u00a0\r\n\r\nI'm not so sure how many people\u00a0are struggling with this issue but it was a surely\u00a0annoying thing for us.\r\n\r\nAnd so I want to know making its default status as unchecked would be acceptable for other users as well.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nOliver Cho\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n----------------------\r\n\r\nAdding this feature request based on the question posted [here|https://community.atlassian.com/t5/Sourcetree-questions/Can-you-please-make-the-default-status-of-quot-Push-all-tags/qaq-p/971859].",

      "description": "Since several version (some of the last releasted for the 2.x and all of the 3.x) it is impossible to use the Diff/Merge tools, at least with BeyondCompare.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that when SourceTree creates the process, it apparently does NOT substitute the {{$LOCAL}}, {{$REMOTE}}, {{$BASE}}, {{$MERGED}} variables for the correct filenames, thus the process gets created with incorrect parameters, something like this:\r\n{code:java}\r\n\"C:\\Program Files\\Beyond Compare 4\\BComp.exe\" \\\"$LOCAL\\\" \\\"$REMOTE\\\" \"e:\\temp\\extdiff.lvsswo\\4.0.a83bd46717c6\\reportes\\RepContratos\\VRAVentasPorPauta95.cpp\" \"4.0.9443a11bb1b7\\reportes\\RepContratos\\VRAVentasPorPauta95.cpp\"{code}\r\nNote the {{$LOCAL}} and {{$REMOTE}} parameters on the created process.\r\n\r\nThis example is for a diff call. SourceTree appends the correct filenames to the process, but leaves the variables in place, which doesn't work for the tool. For diff it is possible to workaround the issue: deleting the parameters from the Diff configuration works. But for merge, which needs more data/parameters it is not possible to workaround it like this.\r\n\r\nThis happens not only with the \"BeyondCompare\" option, but also with the Custom one. I haven't tried others, but if the Custom one fails I am guessing it will fail for all of them.\r\n\r\nI have tried removing the {{\\\"}}, the backslash, and the\u00a0{{\"}} characters and it doesn't matter, the {{$VARIABLE}} is not being replaced.\r\n\r\nI have tried in the two computers I have at hand and some virtual ones and the same happens. I have updated, uninstalled and then reinstalled, and so on, and it's always the same result.\r\n\r\n\u00a0",
