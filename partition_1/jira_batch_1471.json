In this view, the left side bar would be a commit tree navigator. Selecting a commit will show the changes to all the affected files on the right side (one file after the other).\r\nAdditionally, the files could be selected to navigate to the start of each one.\r\nThe commit message would display at the top, clearly formatted.\r\nThis would be somewhat similar to what gitk browser shows.\r\n!crucible.png!\r\nThe idea would be to have a layout like this:\r\n|.|.|Commit message|\r\n|Commit Selector|File selector|File1|\r\n|.|.|File2|\r\n|.|.|File3|",
