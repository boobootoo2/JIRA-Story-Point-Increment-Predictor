That straight forward process might not be the ideal scenario for such an invasive procedure. When a project is deleted, there is no option to restore it natively. When the restore is necessary the user must contact the support team and it has a cost and demand time for the support team. \r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solutions\r\nTo make it easier to restore a deleted project we should have a *trash*/*achieve* feature that stores the \"deleted\" project for like 2 weeks until it runs a job to delete the project completely. This should give the team time to revisit the project if needed and mitigate the need for the restore when that deletion is \"accidental\". \r\n",

It will simply remove the numbered list and leave only the digits after the decimal.\u00a0\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # \u00a0Type a single-digit decimal somewhere outside of Jira (i.e. 4.5, 2.7, 3.6, etc) Copy it to your clipboard.\r\n # Open an issue in the new issue view.\r\n # Paste the number into the new issue view.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nNumbers should be pasted without formatting into a numbered list.\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nThe numbers will automatically be converted into a numbered list.\r\nh4. Original:\r\n\r\n!CleanShot 2019-12-04 at 13.56.18.png!\r\nh4. New Issue View:\r\n\r\n!CleanShot 2019-12-04 at 13.56.51.png|width=350,height=149!\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nPasting directly into a code snippet does retain the original values.\u00a0 In addition, copying from a raw text editor also appears to work.\r\n * Pasting without formatting (e.g. CMD+SHIFT+OPTION+V on macOS) does\u00a0_not_ work to avoid the formatting.\r\n * Clicking off on Numbered List only will remove the numbered list, but will not correct the issue (i.e. 5.7 which has been changed to 1. 7 will only revert back to 7)\r\n * Adding the content to a text editor and copying from there avoids the auto-formatting\r\n\r\nh3. Notes\r\n\r\nMany users may report this as an issue with copying and pasting tables from Excel, or tables from pages in Confluence that are using the Old Editor.\r\n\r\nI can confirm that the issue persists without pasting from a table or list. You could paste a single number and it will still auto-convert.\r\n\r\nThis issue also exists in the Confluence new editor.",

Summary\r\nIn Jira Cloud the the JQL field referance for *\"issueLinkType\"* only supports the operators *\"=\"*, *\"!=\"*, *\"IN\"*, *\"NOT IN\"* as covered in:\r\n- https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirasoftwarecloud/advanced-searching-fields-reference-764478339.html#Advancedsearching-fieldsreference-issuelinkIssuelink\r\n\r\nHowever Currently the Unsupported operators *\"IS\"* & *\"IS NOT\"* are avaliable for use in the JQL options for advanced search, and when these unsupported link type operators are used they do not supply data that would be consistent with what would be expected per the input.\r\n\r\nh3. Environment\r\n* Jira Cloud JQL Advanced Search\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# do an advanced search in an instance that has issues with and without linked issues\r\n# use the following two JQL searches:\r\n{code}\r\nissueLinkType is not EMPTY\r\n{code}\r\nAND\r\n{code}\r\nissueLinkType is EMPTY\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nEither the operators \"IS\" and \"IS NOT\" are not avaliable as they are noted as Unsupported operators\r\n\r\nOR\r\n\r\nOnly issues without a linked issue will be returned when using \"issueLinkType is EMPTY\"  AND Only issues with linked issue will be returned when using \"issueLinkType is not EMPTY\"\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nEach search will result in different sets of issues returned, and each result set will include both; field values *with* AND *without* a linked issues \r\n\r\n \r\nh3. Notes\r\nThe *\"IS\"* and \"*IS NOT\"* operator look to have been added to the JQL when fixing the following BUG:\r\n* https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-72795\r\n\r\nh3.Workaround\r\nOption 1:\r\n* Do not use *\"IS\"* or *\"IS NOT\"* with *\"issueLinkType\"* as they are unsupported operators for the field type\r\n\r\nOption 2:\r\n* For similar behavior to what would be expected results of an *\"IS EMPTY\"* or *\"IS NOT EMPTY\"* you can use the workaround noted in JRACLOUD-72795 and do a *filter \"!=\"* referance to a saved filter to exclude any issue with the set list of link types, like the following:\r\n* Create a saved filter including a list of all the current link types EXE:\r\n{code}\r\nsaved filter = issueLinkType in (\"all\", \"of\", \"the Issue Link Type Names\", \"as a comma separated\", \"List\", \"using Both the\" \"Outward Description\" \"And\" \"Inward Description\")\r\n{code}\r\n* Then in your final JQL:\r\n{code}\r\nProject = EXE AND filter != <filter_ID>\r\n{code}",
