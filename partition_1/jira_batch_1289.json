However, if the address is not associated with any user, and the handler has a reporterusername, then the comment will be added as that default user.\n\nThis ends in the absurd situation where a non existing user can add comments to a case, but an existing user cannot. This user could then create a bogus email account to add comments to the issue.\n\nIn my understanding, the logic of the handleMessage/getReporter mail handlers should be changed. For the previous case (existing user but no permissions) the logic should be:\n\n# Get user from email\n# If user exists, check if user has permission to perform operation\n# If no permissions, fall back to reporterusername\n\nI am aware that [JRA-16786] was raised in the past with a similar request, and the functionality was claimed to be like that by design. However, I think the situation I describe is a flaw in that design.\n\nIf the logic was as described before, we could have avoided creating the proxy commenter for SAC to fix [JRA-15431]. The proxy commenter performs the logic as described before (with some additional magic)\n\n",

Maybe group issues in groups by the fourth power of ten?  \n\nFor example, instead of \n\n/usr/local/jira/attachments/JRA/JRA-123456\n\nhave\n\n/usr/local/jira/attachments/JRA/120000/JRA-123456\n\nFor now we've moved the 1,000 oldest attachments to another directory, effectively deleting them from the Jira web site.  \nSo we have a couple weeks to come up with some patch for this or we keep effectively archiving or deleting old attachments.\n\nI understand from our OS folks that it would be possible to recompile the kernel to have a higher maximum file handle setting.  However, my management wants to pursue an application solution rather than risk the OS recompilation solution.\n\nHere is the error reported in the logs: \n{noformat}\n2009-11-23 10:15:37,371 TP-Processor94 ERROR [jira.issue.fields.AttachmentSystemField] Error occurred while creating attachment.\ncom.atlassian.jira.web.util.AttachmentException: Cannot write to attachment directory.

If you are the owner of a dashboard, you can give a gadget a custom title by clicking the configuration dropdown menu and choosing \"Rename\".\r\n!New_1.png|thumbnail!  !new_2.png|thumbnail!  !new_3.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\nThe screenshots above are from the new JIRA UI and navigation experience that is currently being progressively rolled out to JIRA Cloud. This feature is also supported in the existing UI.\r\n !old_1.png|thumbnail!  !old_2.png|thumbnail!  !old_3.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\nThanks for your patience.

I have suggested that they could create a dashboard containing all relevant charts, but they complain that they cannot name the gadgets as they would like. \r\n\r\nFor example the chart which is presented as 'Issues: 30 Day Summary' at the Project Summary page, could be placed at the dashboard, but its name is set to 'Created vs Resolved Chart: <Project Name>'. That would be great if users could edit the title.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nLukasz ",

This can lead to rare circumstances whereby a remote client, if poorly written, or resource starved in the JVM, can fatally spam JIRA with full system GC calls until (if) it recovers.\n\nThe effect is similar to:\n{noformat}378.030: [GC [PSYoungGen: 13733K->10886K(418816K)] 257769K->254922K(1336320K), 0.0438305 secs] [Times: user=0.05 sys=0.00, real=0.05 secs] \n378.074: [Full GC (System) [PSYoungGen: 10886K->0K(418816K)] [ParOldGen: 244036K->244138K(917504K)] 254922K->244138K(1336320K) [PSPermGen: 66190K->66190K(135168K)], 1.5175107 secs] [Times: user=4.92 sys=0.05, real=1.51 secs] \n379.924: [GC [PSYoungGen: 15258K->712K(435328K)] 259396K->244850K(1352832K), 0.0091928 secs] [Times: user=0.00 sys=0.00, real=0.02 secs] \n379.933: [Full GC (System) [PSYoungGen: 712K->0K(435328K)] [ParOldGen: 244138K->240486K(917504K)] 244850K->240486K(1352832K) [PSPermGen: 66592K->66590K(131072K)], 1.6306610 secs] [Times: user=4.53 sys=0.00, real=1.63 secs] \n382.535: [GC [PSYoungGen: 19106K->11462K(431104K)] 259592K->251948K(1348608K), 0.0230824 secs] [Times: user=0.06 sys=0.00, real=0.03 secs] \n382.558: [Full GC (System) [PSYoungGen: 11462K->0K(431104K)] [ParOldGen: 240486K->240176K(917504K)] 251948K->240176K(1348608K) [PSPermGen: 66648K->66646K(131072K)], 1.3173999 secs] [Times: user=4.14 sys=0.00, real=1.31 secs] \n383.926: [GC [PSYoungGen: 12066K->5636K(446080K)] 252242K->245812K(1363584K), 0.0219822 secs] [Times: user=0.05 sys=0.00, real=0.03 secs] \n383.949: [Full GC (System) [PSYoungGen: 5636K->0K(446080K)] [ParOldGen: 240176K->245655K(917504K)] 245812K->245655K(1363584K) [PSPermGen: 66668K->66668K(131072K)], 1.2802751 secs] [Times: user=4.03 sys=0.00, real=1.27 secs] \n385.301: [GC [PSYoungGen: 7271K->224K(441408K)] 252926K->245879K(1358912K), 0.0217929 secs] [Times: user=0.03 sys=0.00, real=0.03 secs] {noformat}\nRendering the installation incapacitated.\n\nFrom [Sun|http://java.sun.com/javase/technologies/hotspot/gc/gc_tuning_6.html#other_considerations]:\n\n{quote}Another way applications can interact with garbage collection is by invoking full garbage collections explicitly by calling System.gc(). This can force a major collection to be done when it may not be necessary (i.e., when a minor collection would suffice), and so in general should be avoided. The performance impact of explicit garbage collections can be measured by disabling them using the flag -XX:+DisableExplicitGC, which causes the VM to ignore calls to System.gc().\n\nOne of the most commonly encountered uses of explicit garbage collection occurs with RMI's distributed garbage collection (DGC). Applications using RMI refer to objects in other virtual machines. Garbage cannot be collected in these distributed applications without occasionally collection the local heap, so RMI forces full collections periodically. {quote}Alternatively,{quote}The frequency of these collections can be controlled with properties. For example,\n\n\t java -Dsun.rmi.dgc.client.gcInterval=3600000 -Dsun.rmi.dgc.server.gcInterval=3600000 ...\n \nspecifies explicit collection once per hour instead of the default rate of once per minute. However, this may also cause some objects to take much longer to be reclaimed. These properties can be set as high as Long.MAX_VALUE to make the time between explicit collections effectively infinite, if there is no desire for an upper bound on the timeliness of DGC activity.{quote}\n\nOriginates from [CSP-38789|https://support.atlassian.com/browse/CSP-38789]. Explicit remote GC can be completely disabled (ignored) via {{-XX:+DisableExplicitGC}} in Tomcat startup parameters, under Sun Hotspot. Recommend we add this to the distribution startup parameters. Ignoring client requests for GC should not have any impact moving forward as JIRA has already been notified that the object is dirty, or dereferenced, and will reclaim it as part of normal collections.",

And worse, the \"log in\" screen tells them to notify an administrator!  I don't want to get emails (or suffer the other administrators to emails) from users in the world that just want to create an account.\n\nJIRA needs to be able to you specify URLs where users can go to create or modify an account, so that it can continue to work seamlessly with Crowd integrated & external user management turned on.",

The Filter Picker Popup takes about 15 seconds to load as well...until I disabled the issue count column in the JSP...after which it loads instantly.\n\nAnd in JRA-8106, Vincent notes that he encounters similar some performance problems with Issue Filer Management which are not related to JRA-16959. He writes, {quote} In our instance, as Administrator, I am able to see many Filters (8 filters per Project and more than 200 projects).\nDue to theses figures, in JIRA 3.10, I did use any more the Filter Portlet.\nSince JIRA 3.13.x, I encounter the same performance problems, for the Portlet (normal !) but also for the ManageFilters page.\nIt appears a priori that each filter is systematically executed in order to provide the Issue count.\n\nMay we consider an enhancement of these two features (Portlet and ManageFilters page), where Issue count are calculated periodically and stored in order to have the figures as estimate values, but not systematically recalculated. {quote} ",

And it's been a while since you've done this.\n\nFirst you go to Projects and select the project you want. Oh wait. No administration functions here.\n\nThen you go to the Administration tab, then select Project. It pops up a list of projects. Great! There are 3 choices, \"View Edit Delete\". You pick \"Edit\" since you are changing something. Oh wait, it's just the main project metadata (name, picture, etc). This is confusing.\n\nFinally you go back and you pick \"View\". This shows all the project details besides the main project metadata. Here's where you can actually edit the major settings of a project, not on the \"Edit\" page but on the \"View\" page.\n\n=====\n\nSome suggestions for improved usability.\n\n1) Get rid of the separate \"View\" \"Edit\" \"Delete\" screens and the \"Operations\" column on the \"Administration\" page. Combine them together. All 3 of them allow administrators to modify a project. It's too confusing to remember when I have to use \"View\" to edit a project setting, and when I have to use \"Edit\" to edit a project setting.\n\n2) For \"Delete\", have a button or link that says Delete Project, but add a note below the button or link that says \"(You will be asked to confirm)\" or something. It's disconcerting to see \"Delete\" and think \"Wait... if I'm not 100% sure, will clicking this immediately wipe the project away forever?\"\n\n3) On the regular Projects tab, when you select a project, add an \"Administration\" tab for administrators, so that you can modify the project settings from here, and are not forced to go to the Administration->Projects page.",

Your feedback is key to helping us understand how you use JIRA so we can continue improving your experience. We have reviewed this issue over the last few days.\n\nSpeed and performance are a priority for us. While there is still room for improvement when it comes to load times of the Dashboard, we believe at this point we have made sufficient progress to close this request. We continue investment in performance and more improvements are on ther way.\n\nThere was significant effort put into transformation of Gadgets to Dashboard Items. There are still some Gadgets pending transformation. The Activity Stream gadget being the heaviest, and it is scheduled for transformation within next 6 months. We expect further high impact on Dashboard performance from this. We also made some improvements in the front-end by removing DCL handlers.\n\nIn JIRA Cloud instances, Dashboard loading time still sometimes suffers from the fact that for ~25% of user sessions it is the first page after login, and therefore it's affected by cold caches and resources download. The solution here is not to improve the Dashboard anymore but to fix cold caches and resource delivery. We\u2019re working on it.\n\nTo benefit from the above mentioned improvements we recommend for JIRA Server customers to upgrade to at least JIRA 6.4. Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.\n\nRegards,\nDaniel Franz\ndfranz at atlassian dot com\nPrincipal Product Manager, JIRA Platform\n{panel}\n  \n\nDashboard is taking way more time to load than previous version. Everyone noticed it here and it is a major downgrade from 3.13.\n\nOn our local network, the dashboard is noticeably slower. From outside on SSL connection, it is annoying.\n\nIt seems like there is an load of HTTP requests made each time dashboard is load. Could'nt gadget be sent with the main page instead of being loaded after?",

Customers that use the 'createusers' option in one of their mail handlers have little control over the amount of users that their instance has. This is because every user created from the mail handler is assigned to the \"JIRA Users\" global permisisons, and therefore, they are granted permission to log into Jira, increasing the number of active users by one.\n\nFor customers that only want these users to interact by email (and therefore they do not need to log into Jira) it would be useful to have an extra parameter in the mail handler to indicate that the new user should not be granted \"Jira Users\" global permission. \n\nTo make sure these new users do receive mail notifications when the issue is updated, the browse project permission for the relevant project should be granted to group (anyone)",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-19479].\n  {panel}\n\nI installed JIRA on a hosted Windows server that was running IIS and other web sites on port 80. I needed to expose JIRA on a port that was open to the firewall (i.e. port 80) and using a URL that customers would find friendly, such as http://support.mycompany.com/jira. I walked through these two docs:\n\nhttp://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Configuring+IIS+with+Tomcat\nhttp://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Integrating+JIRA+with+IIS\n\nbut I still had several major issues that prevented the site from working. Please add these steps and troubleshooting items to your IIS integration docs:\n\nA) Grant Windows ACL permissions to the c:\\tomcat_iis_connector folder. Right-click the folder, go to the Security tab, ensure that you grant Full permissions for the IIS_WPG group (or the Identity used by the Application Pool if it does not belong to the IIS_WPG group). Then click the Advanced button and select this option: \"Replace permission entries on all child objects with entries shown here that apply to child objects\". Click OK.\n\nTroubleshooting: Ensure that you perform step A if you have any of the following problems:\n  1) The ISAPI Filters tab shows a red arrow for the isapi_redirect.dll filter added earlier.\n  2) You receive a blank response from your custom URL (http://support.mycompany.com/jira)\n  3) A log file is not created within the c:\\tomcat_iis_connector folder when you restart IIS and access your custom URL.\n\nB) After creating the \"jira\" virtual directory, grant the Windows ACL Read permission to the Internet Guest Account (typically IUSR_servername) or whatever identity you have selected in your web site Directory Security for anonymous users.\n\nTroubleshooting: If you receive an HTTP 401 (access denied) error from your custom URL (http://support.mycompany.com/jira) then ensure that you have done step B.\n\nTroubleshooting: If JIRA responds on your custom URL (http://support.mycompany.com/jira) you may see the following error for each of the gadgets: \"Error loading gadget: org.apache.shindig.gadgets.GadgetException: Unable to retrieve gadget xml. HTTP error 500\". This occurs when the JIRA server is unable to resolve the domain name of your custom URL. If your server is hosted or for some other reason cannot resolve support.mycompany.com, then add the following entry to the C:\\WINDOWS\\SYSTEM32\\DRIVERS\\ETC\\HOSTS file:  127.0.0.1  support.mycompany.com\n",

It would be useful if the startup process verified plugin deployment and automatically repeated the process when necessary.\n\nPossible symptoms of the problems are: missing project settings such as categories, issue type schemes, issue security schemes, field configuration schemes, workflow schemes etc... \n\nRegards,\nEdoardo ",

It ignores the \"author\" field and instead uses the logged-in user. Naturally, in an integration scenario, you dont want to use the logged-in user but rather be able to specify who has made the comment.\n\nPlease not that not all SOAP APIs work in that manner: the createIssue API (which is very similar in nature to addComment) takes in a \"reporter\" field and uses it to capture the user who reported the issue, this gives the external application the ability to correctly create an issue on behalf of a user, while such ability does not exist when you try to create a comment, thus, making the createComment API somewhat pointless. I think this can be easily fixed by adding a new \"reporter\" attribute to the RemoteComment object or using the existing \"author\" or \"updateAuthor\" attributes.\n\nThis is a major issue for our company as our service depends on integration with Jira over SOAP.

Eventually JIRA will no longer retrieve gadget specs via a HTTP request back to itself and make an API call instead. This has not been implemented as of this writing.\n{quote}\n\n\nThis is also the case if the JIRA instance is running on a virtual machine, which is running on an internal network.  The issue is that the proxy is implemented by the hypervisor, doing the port forwarding\n(and not apache).

This listener doesn't stop the page navigating to the desired page.\n* Rest end-point - This will take the id (from the id attribute of the anchor) and store it in persisted history\n* Persisted history - create a AdminUserHistoryManager (very similar to ProjectUserHistoryManager)\n* create AdminHistorySimpleLinkFactory (similar to ProjectHistoryLinkFactory) and add it to system-top-navigation-plugin.xml.\n\nWill need unit tests for the AdminUserHistoryManager, AdminHistorySimpleLinkFactory and AdminHistoryResource (REST).\n\nSelenium tests to for functional coverage.\n\nNote. AdminUserHistoryManager should most probably just deal with keys (Strings).\nAdminHistorySimpleLinkFactory will need to convert keys to WebItems to SimpleLinks.\nTo convert keys to WebItems - get all JiraWebItemModuleDescriptors from the PluginAccessor using a ModuleDescriptor predicate that checks for the link id.\nLook at the SimpleLinkManager on how to convert these to SimpleLinks.

For instance I would like to get the list a actors associated with a project role of the project referenced by the issue being validated. The CustomFieldType interface method \"public void validateFromParams(CustomFieldParams relevantParams, ErrorCollection errorCollectionToAddTo, FieldConfig config)\" does not pass the Issue reference so I can't determine the projectId. I have tried different hacks to get access to the current issue (i.e. getting the \"EditIssue\" action from the Action context. The problem here is that if you edit another issue in another browser tab of the same browser, the second issue will overwrite the \"Edit Issue\" Action before the first Issue is validated.\nIf system field types get an Issue reference in the validation method why don't custom field types.

Version names are generally synchronized across all of these projects, however if I want to view a list of issues sorted by the Fix Version, JIRA will do a an implicit primary sort on Project Name because the Versions of the same name are actually different database entities across the different projects.  Effectively, there is no way to sort on Fix Version across multiple projects in JIRA.\n\nI would suggest adding new custom fields called \"Affects Version Name\", \"Fix Version Name\", and \"Component Name\".  This would allow a user to sort their issues on these new columns which would not implicitly sort based on the Project first.",

Your feedback is key to helping us understand how you use JIRA so we can continue improving your experience. We have reviewed this issue over the last few days; unfortunately we don't have any plans to support this in JIRA for the foreseeable future.\n\nPlease remember that jira.atlassian.com is one of many inputs for the JIRA roadmap. You can [learn more about our process here|https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/110373/how-does-the-jira-team-use-jira-atlassian-com].\n \nI understand that our decision may be disappointing. Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.\n \nRegards,\nDave Meyer\ndmeyer@atlassian.com\nProduct Manager, JIRA Platform\n{panel}\n\nI'd like to be able to create an activity stream based on a component in a project.\n\nIt seems to be the easiest way to accomplish this would be to allow filters for issues to serve as the feeding system for the activity stream.",

I have had several cases where I made sure a screen included a field, only to find out the field was still not shown, or shown but read-only. Fiddling with screen schemes, screen definitions, field configurations, and field configuration schemes usually worked out, but there was no clear route, and no clear winner in what eventually caused the desired effect.{quote}\n\nI agree that JIRA is very complex and it can be difficult to ascertain why a field is visible/hidden or editable/read-only. We should create an FAQ that summarises the reasons why a field might be visible/hidden or editable/read-only, linking to the relevant documentation.",

Create a workflow.\n 2. Create multiple steps in the workflow but add no transitions.\n 3. Create a workflow scheme.\n 4. Associate the workflow to an issue type in the workflow scheme.\n 5. Associate the workflow scheme to a project.\n 6. Create a draft of the workflow.\n 7. Try to add a transition to any of the steps.\n 8. Try to delete any of the steps.\n\nThis is not a support request, as I have a workaround: make sure every step has at least one transition before associating them to a project.",
