      "description": "We currently have 81 mercurial repositories and 3 cvs repositories. We set up the repos with all default values and found the load average on the box went very high. After researching, this is due to the fact that fisheye is scanning the repos non-stop (1 after another).\r\n\r\nWhat I would like to see would be a way to choose a smart scheduler to schedule updates of the repositories. Something that could ramp up scanning (say after a commit is seen it goes back to scanning every 60 s). But after each scan in which nothing changes, it adds 30 seconds to the next scan up to a minimum threshold say 10 minutes (configurable). That way active projects would be scanning every 60 seconds and inactive projects and night-time everything would only scan every 10 minutes. This would significantly lower the load on our server.",
