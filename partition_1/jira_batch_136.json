      "description": "Why needed:\r\n\r\nThere are tools devs use to monitor the file system of their projects (such as css compilers etc such as Codekit for OSX) and these tools are monitoring for user-initiated changes (file saves etc).\r\n\r\nUnfortunately they cannot distinguish between these changes and changes initiated by a branch checkout of pull request, so we find ourselves having to manually stop these monitors by hand each time the project is updated (or risk git \"cannot update because file is changes/untracked\" errors... a real P in the A).\r\n\r\nTherefore we really need a way of stopping these other apps from monitoring the projects during a checkout/pull in an automated way.\r\n\r\nWhy is this a problem for Sourcetree?:\r\n\r\nGit has no concept or a pre-pull/checkout hook that a dev can create against a project, so the normal way to do this is to create a custom script on the terminal that does this and then does the checkout etc. Unfortunately this isnt possible with Sourcetree as we have no way to tell it to run a specific script instead of running the standard \"git checkout\" command.\r\n\r\nTherefore my idea is for a solution that would utilise the existing \"custom actions\" feature already present in Sourcetree. What would be needed would be an alternative (repo-specific?) option that essentially says (before checkout / before update, run custom action \"x\" , and after, run custom action \"y\").\r\n\r\nWhile this isnt an option that would appeal to everyone, it would give some users far greater control and flexibility of how they can manage their repos, and give much flexible integration with other tools in a developer's workflow (without actually having to do any specific integration with other apps).",

When using the command line hg everything works fine, but when trying to commit from SourceTree I get errors about Python being unable to load the modules.\r\n\r\nI tried running SourceTree from a shell session that has the proper value in PYTHONPATH but it doesn't work better. I also tried setting PYTHONPATH through launchctl (with a logout+login) but I get the same error. I'm guessing that SourceTree somehows completely overrides the PYTHONPATH when invoking hg.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nMartin",

Also noticed the items are disabled if you just select all repositories at the top level.\r\n\r\nThis is a UX improvement request to make a real, helpful sort feature part of the GUI, and have it work on bookmarks in the window regardless of whether they are in a folder. The feature you have is so hidden I used the product for months, looking for it repeatedly, and was convinced it wasn't there. Even a preference setting \"Sort bookmarks by name\" would be more visible and intuitive than what's there now. \r\n\r\nThanks!",
