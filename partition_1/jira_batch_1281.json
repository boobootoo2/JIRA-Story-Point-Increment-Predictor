This defeats the purpose of having configurable workflows steps since the user is able to change the state of the issue outside of the workflow.  There should be a way to configure JIRA so that this button can be hidden or disabled.\n\nAn admin should also have the ability to hide the Assign menu button on the top of a ticket for the same purposes as listed above. If a user wants to only have the assignee determined by a workflow, this hinders that ability.\n\n*Workaround:*\nFor JIRA Server: Go to Admin, Plugins, System Plugins, Issue Operations Plugin, Manage plugin modules. Find the module named \"View Issue Ops Bar Assign To Me Link (assign-to-me)\" and click on the Disable button. The \"Assign To Me\" button will now not be displayed when viewing any issue.\nThis is not available on JIRA Cloud because System Plugins are restricted.",

(I've not found any other way to meet this request, and it limits the usefulness of sub-tasks, which is the only real issue hierarchy available in JIRA.)\n\nFor example, PARENT IN (KEY1,KEY3,KEY8) is a useful expression to find sub-tasks related to a known list of top-level issues, but PARENT IN (TYPE = PROBLEM) would be much more powerful, as I wouldn't need to know in advance which issueKeys are of type \"Problem\". Also, if this syntax existed for finding subtasks, it could then be leveraged to provide the sort order requested in JRA-9197.\n\nThanks for a great product!",

Given the plugin key they need to look at the vendors for an idea or grep the plugin jar files again.\n\nOne way to provide this information to an admin would be to make the custom field type names listed at Admin, Custom Field into links to the UPM and the specific plugin module that provides the given custom field type.

We envision that JIRA will end up with thousands of projects (ballpark figure of about 10,000 projects). However, it would appear that JIRA was not designed to scale to this number of projects and we would like to request some new features in JIRA to support this number of projects. \n\nThese requests are based on our findings of running a JIRA instance with 12,000 projects (this was created using a modified version of your jmeter-test-setup.jmx performance testing script).\n\nFeature Request 1:\nAdd pagination support to the 'View all Projects' page both under the Projects tab and the Administration page. \n\nAs you can imagine, with 12,000 projects these pages take too long to load making project selection extremely difficult. Pagination would enable a user to browse a large number of projects without excessive load times.\n\n\nFeature Request 2:\nAdd some filter controls on the 'View all Projects' page. \n\nEven with pagination, searching thousands of projects would be tedious. Thus if we could get filters, even if it were just a name based filter, that would be most welcome.\n\n\nRegards,\n  -George Clernon\n",

You can see the linked video in the attachments for how this works. Therefore, I am marking this issue as complete.\r\n\r\nThe new issue view has been rolled out to all Jira Software cloud customers with the ability for each user to individually toggle it off or on. You need to have the new issue view toggled on to have this functionality. \r\n\r\nIt should be noted however, that drag and drop for issues within an epic will *not* work. This is due to the fact that regular issue types - e.g. stories, bug, task - are tied into the global rank which can affect your backlog list. The subtask issue type(s) did not have this problem as they were not tied to the global rank. For example, if you moved the list of stories under an epic around, it would affect how those issues are represented in your backlog inadvertently and ways you may not have intended, causing confusion. We are designing the best experience for being able to drag and drop issues within an epic, while taking this into account. This will be shipped at some point in the future - no timeline yet unfortunately. \r\n\r\nI have created a separate issue to track that functionality specifically. https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-72887\r\n\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n Taylor Pechacek\r\n tpechacek\u00a0(at) atlassian (dot) com\r\n Product Manager, Jira Cloud\r\n{panel}\r\nShould be a way to move the subtasks up or down with a drag and drop feature instead of one row at a time. When there are an extensive amount of subtasks it is cumbersome and time consuming to move subtasks up or down one row at a time. Having a drag and drop feature would allow for quicker organization of the subtasks.",

This new issue experience has been completely redesigned and includes a single status transition button with a drop-down, which will show all status's and/or all transitions --> status if you have multiple transitions to a single status within your workflow. The ordering is just alphabetical within each status category (to do, in progress, done).\r\n\r\nThe new issue view is available to all Jira users. You can enable it by going to your personal settings, then scrolling down to find a Jira Labs section and enabling it.\r\n\r\nWorkflow transitions and status are a key part of any Jira issue, so our aim was to make it much more prominent, easier to understand, and easier to update when you want to make a change. You can read more about all the new features here:\r\n - [The new Jira issue view - Atlassian Documentation|https://confluence.atlassian.com/jiracorecloud/the-new-jira-issue-view-938040503.html#ThenewJiraissueview-Simpletransitions.]\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask.

However, we are importing and retiring two different systems into one JIRA installation in the near future and have a need to have two import id prefixes for two different projects. Is there a way to have two import ids and base them on which project the issue originates from?\n\nFor example, if I configured this field to work with Bugzilla all links on both custom fields pertaining to different systems would both point to Bugzilla. This would be fine if we only imported issues from Bugzilla, but now all links in my other Bug Import Id field also point to Bugzilla.\n",

You can [learn more about our process here|https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/110373/how-does-the-jira-team-use-jira-atlassian-com].\n\nI understand that our decision may be disappointing. Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.\n\nGracias,\nOtto Ruettinger\nPrincipal Product Manager, JIRA\noruettinger (at) atlassian (dot) com\n{panel}\n\n\\\\\n\n*Original description*\nSimilar to CONF-21982 it would be desirable to have the ability to retrieve LDAP properties for users.\n\nWe are using JIRA as a help desk system and have attached it to a Windows Active Directory LDAP server with a plug-in (https://plugins.atlassian.com/plugin/details/16524). The plug-in implements com.opensymphony.user.provider.CredentialsProvider, is able to authenticate the user, add group memberships and store custom user properties as PropertySet attributes in the JIRA database.\n\nThe custom properties are necessary for our support team and are displayed on the user profile and issue screen (ie. for phone dialing without using an external phone book application).\n\nWith JIRA 4.3 there is a possiblity to switch to the provided LDAP integration, but there seems to be no way to retrieve additional LDAP properties.\n\nWe have also investigated in using a separate Crowd installation and delegating user security to Crowd. It is possible to create user defined user and group properties in Crowd but these properties are not synchronized into the JIRA database.",

In my instance we have a custom Single Sign On solution where we do not want a user to receive a notification when their JIRA account is created.  A setting in the Administration console under General Administration would be a good spot for it.\n\nAnother part of this is that we are specifically using the SOAP services to create users and it would be helpful to have a value that can be set in the API to turn emails on or off when creating that one user.\n\nThanks,\nJustin",

But there is a way to force FancyBox to process all links like images, to do that we added 'type': 'image' parameter to FancyBox initialization script in viewissue.js (right after 'overlayShow': useOverlay, in row 456). Is it possible to add this parameter to your upstream, since you use it to show image's thumbnails anyway?",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-24234].\n  {panel}\n\nWhen LDAP Delegated Authentication is used it can be configured to support user object filter only via direct manipulation of database table. To be more specific this is 'cwd_directory_attribute' table and mapulated attributes are \"ldap.user.filter\" and \"ldap.user.objectclass\". In my case I'm using ldap.user.filter=\"(memberOf=cn=jira,ou=groups,dc=mycompany,dc=com)\" and ldap.user.objectclass=\"inetOrgPerson\". It works perfectly. I had a hope that underlying implementation is the same as LDAP Directory. Obviously it is, at least is seems like that. My point is that this functionality already exists and there is no reason to don't use it again for LDAP Delegated Authentication.\n\nFor me personaly this is quite useful, because I can emulate disabled jira account.",
