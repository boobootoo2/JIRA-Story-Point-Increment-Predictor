Issue Summary\r\n\r\nWhen a product subscription is deleted, for example, Jira Core, this may break the Product Access page, it will display an error saying \"No application access config found\". Not allowing administrators to configure product and administrative access on the site.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nThe issue is intermittent, so it won't reproduce easily, the steps below are the exact steps taken by Atlassian support to reproduce the problem on a fresh Cloud site.\r\n # Start a site with Jira Software\r\n # Start a trial on Jira Core\r\n # Delete the Jira Core subscription\r\n # Try to delete Jira Software, you will be prompted to cancel the whole subscription\r\n # Reactivate the Jira Core subscription\r\n # Delete the Jira Software subscription\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nNo more product access configuration for Jira Software is returned on Product Access or user profile access switcher toggle.\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nThe product access page breaks, looking at the HTTP requests, it still returns product access configuration for Jira Software, the user profile will also keep showing the product access switcher toggle for Jira Software.\r\n\r\nh3. Notes\r\n\r\nThe issue may reproduce itself under similar circumstances of subscription management but not the same order of steps described on this bug report.\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nReactivate the missing product and delete it again. If this does not work, contact our [Atlassian support|https://support.atlassian.com/]\u00a0mentioning this bug report.",
