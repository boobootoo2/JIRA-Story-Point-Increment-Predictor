Summary\nWhen there are multiple custom fields with the same name on a screen, in the \"Configure Fields\" dropdown menu there will be only one option for all these fields.\n\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\n# Create two custom fields with the same name. For example, \"TestCF\".\n# Create a project and associate the both \"TestCF\" fields to the Create Issue screen of that project.\n# Create a new issue in that project, a Creste Issue popup will appear.\n# In the Create Issue screen click on the \"Configure Fields\" menu.\n\nh3. Expected Results\nIn the \"Configure Fields\" dropdown menu the \"TestCF\" custom field should appear twice.\n\nh3. Actual Results\nOnly one \"TestCF\" field appears. (See screenshot below)\n !2016-10-20_configure-fields.png|thumbnail! \n \nh3. Notes\nWhen \"Show All Fields\" is selected, both custom fields with the same name are correctly displayed on the screen, however if \"Show Custom Fields\" is selected, only one \"TestCF\" custom field will be displayed if the option is checked.\n\nh3.Workaround\nUse different names for the custom fields on the same screen.",

Problem Definition:\nAt the moment, if a user is using the wrong credential when login multiple times they will prompt to input CAPTCHA if it is enabled. Then, if we refer to the page at _JIRA Administration > User Management > User_ we could see the \"Failed Login Count\" is increasing and Admin will be able to reset it. But, this will remain until the user is using the right credentials to login or an Admin resets the failed login count.\n\nh3. Suggested Solution:\nHence, it will be great if there is a Configuration that will resets the failed login count automatically in a set period of time. Just like most login feature where the user needs to wait for 5 minutes for them to make another attempt to login, this will reset the failed login count.\n",

Notice from screenshot of a live debugging, how linkedIssue.isSubTask() is true, while cleanLinkedIssue.isSubtask() is false for the same issue.\n!linkedIssue.png|thumbnail!\n* According to customer same code works fine in JIRA 6, and only has this behaviour from JIRA 7.x. If there's at all need to make any reference to the plugin's source code, it is available at https://bitbucket.org/azhdanov/jiratimesheet, however, since it's our java API issue I'm assuming that may not be necessary. Relevant or affected code from our API can be seen from screenshot to some extent. \n\n*Worth to mention:*\nBug is in the method {{IssueLinkManager#getLinkCollection}}. All outgoing issues have parameter {{parent}} set to itself.\nIntroduced in [this|https://stash.atlassian.com/projects/JIRA/repos/jira/pull-requests/5475/overview] PR.",

Jira did not accept these, only parts of that expression.\n\n*Actual behaviour*: Setting a biweekly trigger for a selected day of week seems to be a missing basic feature at the moment. \nWhen we add e.g. second and last Mondays for trigger, sometimes it takes 3 weeks sometimes 2 weeks in between. Its not acceptable.\n(second monday  of october is oct.10, last is october 31, that is 3 weeks, but for november the trigger would work)\n \n*Expected behaviour*: Possible scheduled issue trigger biweekly on a chosen day of week, please. Would be nice as \"Days per Biweek\" as a preset schedule.\n\nThank you!",

Problem Definition\r\nWhen using utf8 (multibyte character set), changing the default setting of NLS_LENGTH_SEMANTICS = BYTE to NLS_LENGTH_SEMANTICS = CHAR can help to avoid unexpected ORA-12899: value too large for column errors on AO columns. The problem is that with the default setting VARCHAR(N) translates to a length of n Bytes and not necessarily n characters in UTF8, so you would get a ORA-12899 error when you try to store n multibyte characters in that column.\r\n\r\nThis can be reproduced with a simple ActiveObjects test class as follows:\r\n{quote}\r\n\u2014 class \u2014\r\n import net.java.ao.*;\r\n import net.java.ao.schema.StringLength;\r\n import net.java.ao.schema.Table;\r\n\r\n@Table(\"T_TEST_CLASS\")\r\n public interface TestClassAO extends Entity \\{\r\n String TEST_FIELD_ID = \"C_TEST_FIELD\";\r\n\r\n@Accessor(TEST_FIELD_ID)\r\n @StringLength(6)\r\n String getTestField();\r\n }\r\n\r\n\u2014 run test \u2014\r\n myActiveObjects.create(TestClassAO.class, new DBParam(TestClassAO.TEST_FIELD_ID, \"\u043f\u0440\u0438\u0432\u0435\u0442\"));\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\nIt's Oracle DB feature: NLS_LENGTH_SEMANTICS. This setting manages how Oracle DB will calculate length of VARCHAR2 (in out case). Default value is BYTE (it means \"calculate by bytes\"). We should use CHAR (calculate by chars) for expected results of UTF-8 usage... In this way we must define this parameter explicitly during table creating. For example: VARCHAR2(18) must be replaced by VARCHAR2(18 char).\r\nSee\r\n[https://docs.oracle.com/cd/B19306_01/server.102/b14237/initparams127.htm#REFRN10124]\r\n[http://gerardnico.com/wiki/database/oracle/byte_or_character]\r\n\r\n\u00a0",

Summary\n\nThe [_cascadingselect_ field type|https://developer.atlassian.com/jiradev/jira-platform/building-jira-add-ons/jira-plugins2-overview/configuring-plugins-with-object-configurable-parameters] does not work in the [reports plugin module|https://developer.atlassian.com/jiradev/jira-platform/building-jira-add-ons/jira-plugins2-overview/jira-plugin-module-types/report-plugin-module]. A plugin attempting to use this field type will compile without problems, but no select input field will be rendered in the final report.\nh3. Environment\n - JIRA 7.2.3;\n - OSX 10.11.2;\n - Chrome 53.0.2785.143.\n\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\n # Create a plugin that utilises the [report plugin module|https://developer.atlassian.com/jiradev/jira-platform/building-jira-add-ons/jira-plugins2-overview/jira-plugin-module-types/report-plugin-module].\n # Define a new report in the {{atlassian-plugin.xml}}, and specify a _cascadingselect_ field type (example below):\n{noformat}\n...\n<property>\n  <key>selectForCascade</key>\n  <name>Select for cascade</name>\n  <description>First part of the cascading field</description>\n  <type>select</type>\n  <values>\n    <value>\n      <key>happy</key>\n      <value>Happy</value>\n    </value>\n    <value>\n      <key>sad</key>\n      <value>Sad</value>\n    </value>\n  </values>\n</property>\n<property>\n  <key>aCascade</key>\n  <name>Cascade select field</name>\n  <description>Secondt part of the cascading field</description>\n  <type>cascadingselect</type>\n  <cascade-from>selectForCascade</cascade-from>\n  <values>\n    <value>\n      <key>cat</key>\n      <value>Cat</value>\n    </value>\n    <value>\n      <key>dog</key>\n      <value>Dog</value>\n    </value>\n  </values>\n</property>\n...\n\n\n\n\n{noformat}\n\n # Navigate to the custom report.\n\nh3. Expected Results\n\nTwo select fields should be present on the configure report screen (hardcoded values in the second select should come from a {{ValuesGenerator}} that depends on the value of the first select).\nh3. Actual Results\n\nNo input field is rendered at all for the second select, and if a {{ValuesGenerator}} was used to populate the second select, it is never executed.\u00a0\u00a0\nh3. Workaround\n\nAccording to [this Confluence Question|https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/128375/options-for-reports-using-cascading-select], the [eazyBI Reports Plugin|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.eazybi.jira.plugins.eazybi-jira/server/overview]\u00a0can provide this functionality.",

For the mandatory fields of Jira1 which are not available in Jira2 we have set default values.\n\nLikewise we have set default value for Priority also.ie in Jira2 issue priority is not a mandatory field so for tickets in which priority is not set Remote copy is throwing the error: Priority This field is mandatory in the target project, but field value(s) for this field could not be mapped to valid values in the target project. But for other custom fields which are not available/set in Jira2 while remote copying default value is considered. Why its not considered for Priority?

This can cause confusion when users receive the error telling them that Epic Name is required, when it does not even exist in the screen as an option.
