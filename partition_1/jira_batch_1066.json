FAQ\r\nh3. What are we doing?\r\n\r\nAfter analysing your feedback, we've realised that there is a lot of confusion caused by multiple inconsistent issue search pages in Jira. We want to simplify search in Jira and make it\u00a0faster and more scalable. In this journey we will be adding features to the new issue navigator and after it has all the functionality of advanced search, we will *replace advanced search with the new issue navigator*.\r\n\r\nHere's what we are achieving with this change:\r\n * A consistently powerful issue search experience in Jira\r\n * Faster and more scalable search\r\n * Updated technology behind search, making it easier to add new features\r\n * Simple and modern UI\u00a0\r\n\r\nh3. Why are we doing this?\r\n\r\nWe receive lots of great feedback from our customers on how we should improve issue search in Jira. One of the top items that caused confusion was the disparity in the user experience between advanced search and project \"issues\" tab. Moreover, our customers want the search to be more user friendly and powerful, we need to modernise the tech stack of search to make that happen.\u00a0\r\nh3. What to expect next?\r\n\r\nTo keep you informed, we will use this issue to communicate the progress of our work. Please +*WATCH*+ this ticket to stay updated on the latest.\r\nh3. How do I enable the issue navigator in my team-managed projects ?\r\n\r\nYou can enable issue navigator via the features page under team-managed project settings in Jira Cloud. After you have enabled the issue navigator, _Issues_ will appear in the sidebar on the left.\r\nh3. What will happen to my marketplace apps ?\r\n\r\nTo ensure a smooth transition of marketplace apps, we ran a [testing program|https://community.developer.atlassian.com/t/unifying-search-experience-in-jira-replacing-advanced-search/45000] to allow time for app developers to transition to the new issue navigator.\u00a0\r\nh3. What about the issues that currently exist in Advanced search?\r\n\r\nA lot of the issues with advanced search are getting fixed and you can try the fixed out today in the new issue navigator. An example is\u00a0JRACLOUD-76031\u00a0Unify the scrollbar appearance on different platforms.\u00a0 More documentation on\u00a0the new issue navigator [here|https://support.atlassian.com/jira-software-cloud/docs/enable-the-project-issue-navigator/].\u00a0",

      "description": "h3. Problem Definition\r\nThere are times when you need to take your Jira Cloud data and put it into a Jira Server site. There are many reasons for this, such as auditing your data locally, testing out something, or a true Cloud to Server migration.   However with Jira Cloud having next-gen projects (and Server not having them), the process to create a backup intended for Jira Server is much more difficult to manage now for site-admins.  Now admins have to either convert all the next-gen projects into classic first, OR delete them before a backup can be made for Server.\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\nIt would be amazing if the server backup creation option could just create its backup file as if the next-gen projects had already been converted (don't actually convert them on the Cloud site, just in the backup file).  Since this backup is never intended to be used with another Jira Cloud site, the backup for server should just auto-convert them for you.\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Why this is important\r\nIt's difficult as a site-admin to know what data created by others in next-gen projects would still be needed after a migration.  This requires the site-admin to contact each project creator to see if that data is required.   Otherwise the admin has to make the gut wrenching decision to either delete or convert.  Both options are not ideal.\r\n\r\n\r\nh3.

For instance assume you have the process of having two distinct projects in JIRA for a single project \"Foo\". One for development and one after the project was released:\n\nProject key: FOO (for released builds)\nProject key: FOODEV (for development builds)\n\nBefore the project goes live, you only set-up the FOODEV project in JIRA.\n\nIt would be great if you could specify a project key alias to FOODEV called FOO which can then be used to look-up FOODEV issues as long as the alias is active.\nAt the point the project is released you can then remove the alias and add a FOO-project.\n\nThe net outcome is that all your employees will always work with the \"FOO\" project key and it will automatically use the FOODEV-project during the early development phase while later it will automatically use the FOO-project.\n\nNo more need to rectify the long project key names for administrators.",

The _original time_ and _remaining time_ fields will remain in sync, if the original time is changed after it is first entered, the remaining time will also change. However, once time is logged or if the remaining time is manually updated, this sync will no longer occur i.e. the remaining time will no longer change when the original time is updated.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nTha Atlassian Cloud team\r\n{panel}\r\nh3. Issue Summary\r\n\r\nThe Remaining estimate is not updated when the Original estimate is filled on the issue.\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Enable the new issue view on the Profile Settings\r\n # Add Time Tracking to the issue's edit screen\r\n # Create a new issue\r\n # Open the issue and enter a value on Time estimate\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nRemaining estimate receives the same value as Time estimate\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nRemaining estimate is not updated\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nThis specifically happens on the new issue view only. You can either permanently disable the new issue view on your Personal Settings or temporarily with the See the old view button",
