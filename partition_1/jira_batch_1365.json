      "description": "RCS diff parsing can fail if changelist description or added lines contain text that we interpret as RCS metadata, e.g. \"change 123 by Author\".\r\n\r\nPossible fix could be skipping N lines after an add marker. However, this approach fails when requesting more than one changelist diff in one batch and one of them does not finish with a new line. Then we can get the following output:\r\n{noformat}a34 1\r\nnonummy ligula, et aliquam massa felis dolor.Change 7 by conor@awali on 2008/03/05 04:46:37{noformat}\r\nWe can't distinguish if \"Change 7\" is a start of a new changelist, or just a plain text of the added line.\r\nCurrently we treat it as a new changelist, see {{com.cenqua.fisheye.perforce.client.DescribeProcessor#CHANGE_HEADER}}. Possible solution is to switch to {{com.cenqua.fisheye.perforce.client.DescribeProcessor.DescribeType#UNIFIED}}, but that of course requires testing the new diff format and *making sure all supported perforce servers are capable of providing diffs in this format*.\r\n\r\nThis problem appears for example when parsing https://swarm.workshop.perforce.com/changes/240, file test/p4_describe.good#2.
