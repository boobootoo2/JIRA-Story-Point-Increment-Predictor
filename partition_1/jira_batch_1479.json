A total rethink of permissions in FECru, with projects becoming the top-level items in FishEye Repositories becoming part of projects. Permissions all project based.\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nBy default, Crucible project caches content of files added from Fisheye repository. You can disable this option in Administration > Projects > Edit project > 'Store the contents of files in reviews'. When disabled, Crucible will always call Fisheye to fetch file content when reviewing. During this fetch, repository permissions are respected.\r\n\r\n",

However, we have many more than 50 projects, and our users get confused by not seeing they're project in the list. Auto-completion still works so if they happen to know the key of they're project they can just start typing it and continue. This is very awkward though as we have a large number of projects, and not everyone has every project memorized!\r\n\r\nPlease change the brute force approach of 50 item limit, to being a contextual scoping; show only the projects that the user is in some way associated with. For example they have previously made commits to, reviews to, or are in a group that is tied to the project or repository,\r\n\r\nThis contextual scoping will be much more appropriate and likely a lot less than 50 items. For cases where its not possible to auto-detect the context of the user, there should be a list all check box, which fills the drop down list with _all_ projects. They clicked it, they asked for it, its ok to wait.\r\n",
