This would be very useful for us because we are automatically linking tickets using special \"internal\" link types that were raised from other projects (e.g. L1 / L2 / QA / etc.). If a user can edit / create these manually, it can break our whole link structure. Basically we want to do the same JIRA does with it's internal subtask link that users cannot manually edit.\n\n(3) Advanced permissions on who can use a certain link type. This is particularly useful when removing link types that e.g. identify blockers for a certain issue.",

This creates an issue with backup and recovery.  While both can be backed up using whatever means determined by the user, the back up for the file system is only good at the point when the backup occurs.  Since it is next to impossible to match the database and file system backups up, restoration can be miss matched.  This is especially true when the database exists on a separate server as is the case in most larger environments.  If the attachments could be stored in the database, the inconsistencies exist in the file system/database backups would not exist.  \n\nThe other positive to storing the attachments in the database is the database can be restored to any given point in time.  Since Jira is very dynamic and data is constantly changing and/or being added, this capability minimizes data loss. ",

(Button on bottom)\n\nMy suggestions are:\n\n1. Have all NLS settings at *one* place and have a separate section or menu entry \"NLS settings\" or such. Do not hide them away.\n\n2. Make it explicit what each NLS setting affects. There is some nice description for the four Java/JavaScript date/time settings available, but there is no comment on what the date/time settings in the Design section are supposed to affect or not affect. There's also no hint how the date/time settings in the Design settings complement or interfer with the field date/time settings.\n\n3. Things would imho be much more comfortable if JIRA came with a few widely used presets for NLS settings, such as\n  - US format, numbers only: 12/31/1999 5:32 PM\n  - US format, abbrev. months: Dec/31/1999 5:32 PM\n  - European format: 31.12.1999 17:32\n  - ISO standard format: 1999-12-31 17:32\n  - maybe one or two others...\n  (There are web pages listing the world's most common date/time formats.)\nThis would avoid the need to study the format descriptions first and play with the Java/JavaScript date/time setting, thus reducing the chance of errors.\n\n4. It is currently not clear for me as an admin whether NLS settings are JIRA-wide for *any* user or whether they depend on the locale setting of each user's PC, which might vary. Ideally translations, date/time formats and such would automatically adjust to the defaults of each user's locale, with no need for the admin to specify *any* explicit format.\nSee also issue JRA-10613 (Time and date formats should be depending on users profile) for this.\n\nI hope these suggestions will help improve JIRA. Feel free to split them into separate issues if you like.",

As well you would need to implement a way to resume the mail queue from the same dump file(s).\n\nBest regards,\nLucas Timm\nAtlassian Support",

Manually choosing the projects a custom field applies to is not a good way because it is very error-prone (think about what happens when the customer adds projects at a later stage). Therefore most people end up using the global context but restricting the field to certain field configurations. However, the field is automatically added to all field configurations and per default SHOWN. This means you have to go through every single field configuration and HIDE it.\n\nI can think of two possible solutions:\n\n(1) Implement Custom Field Schemes\n\nOR\n\n(2) Implement another wizard page when adding a new custom field that allows to show / hide the custom field for certain field configurations (just like it is done with Screens)",

This breaks in JIRA 5.1.2\n\nIt would be ideal that the JIRA.Mention would just accept options to either use custom endpoint and/or simply use /user/search when projectKey is not provided. That way I could use JIRA.Mention without hacking to get it to work with non-project specific mentioning.\n\nThanks.",

You simple need to belive that something is happening in the backgound, if the upload is complete everything is fine and the images appeare under the appropriate section. Some of our users are very irritated that their upload or screenshot attachment didn't work because of the lack of any visual feedback while the file is beeing process in the background. You may implement some kind of loading gif that appears until the image appears. That would get the casual user happy.\n\nThank you in advance for looking into that.\n\nRegards,\nBj\u00f6rn",

In previous versions of JIRA it was possible to edit the labels field even if the field was not present in the Edit Screen. \n\nIt has been decided not to restore this behaviour in JIRA 5.1 and beyond so an alternative to inline editing Labels needs to be documented.\n\nThere are two options:\n# Press the 'l' key to bring up the Labels dialog\n# Add the Labels field to the Edit Screen\n\nFurther, to increase visibility of the issue, it was proposed that the JIRA Admin Helper Plugin be used to help diagnose why people cannot edit a particular field. Currently the plugin does not load the Edit Screen details on the View Issue page. I will raise an issue with the developer to see if this is possible.",
