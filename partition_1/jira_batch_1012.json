We have a large amount of issues in our jira installation.  Most of those issues are unverified, possibly unscheduled and are generally crud.  I only really care about the scheduled issues that are in the current or the next releease or two out.  So statistics for the whole project get skewed by this amount of old/unscheduled/unverified issues.  \n\nIt would be nice to be able to filter a stats portlet by version.  So it basically displays the same way but only calculates stats for a specific version.  Of course, it would be nice to see that version in the portlet header or something.  Also for different ways I configure the portlet (Summary,Components,Assignee) it would be nice to specify whether I want to filter on Affects or Fix version.  ",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-2328].\n  {panel}\n\nDetails on the report below - from Jesco von Voss:\r\n\r\n> I'm not sure quite how the second report works. Given a particular version,\r\n> list all the time assigned to different developers? How does the calendar\r\n> date part work?\r\n\r\nThe idea is this: I want to know how much buffer time we have until\r\na version is due. And a version is due on a release date, which is given\r\nby calendar date, not by the expression \"in 45 work days\".\r\n\r\nSo I have a developer and sum up her current work load in days and hours,\r\nbased on all issues assigned to her. (Minus the time worked on the issues,\r\nof course. And across all projects.) That is the first report I described.\r\n\r\nNow I give a calendar date, and the system should figure out how many\r\ndays the developer will be in the office. How many times will the sun\r\nrise, minus all Saturdays and Sundays. That's how many days she has left\r\nto complete her work load. The difference is the buffer time for her.\r\nAs you already have popups in date input fields that show the month,\r\nformatted by weeks, I imagine calculating the office days would not be\r\ntoo hard.\r\nLet's ignore July 4 or any other holidays for now.\r\n\r\nIdeally, one would like to see this for all developers in an overview page\r\n(Or maybe for all developers that are assigned to a project? ) But a start\r\nwould be to show this on the start page for every developer.\r\n\r\nThe question is how this \"release date\" would be stored. Ideally, I would\r\nlike to set one project as being the reference in the global Administration\r\nsettings somewhere. Then, the system would get that project, get the next\r\nupcoming version, and retrieve its \"release date\" value, which I have set\r\nappropriately.\r\n\r\nThe fast version of implementing this would probably be to just set a\r\n\"release date\" somewhere in the Administration settings and use that value.\r\n\r\nThere is a slight mismatch, as you might have noticed: I want the workload\r\nof a developer gathered across all projects, but one project should be\r\nused to determine how much time is left. But that's how we work ... we'd\r\nlike to set up one project \"Holidays\", one project \"Fairs + Exhibitions\",\r\nand everyone would log issues there. This way we know: \"Person A has two\r\ndays off, is one day at a conference, and has 14 days worth of issues,\r\nthat gives him two days left until day X, and that's ok\".",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-2326].\n  {panel}\n\nThis is a 'meta-issue' for linking all issues related to advanced email support.  That is, towards being able to use email as a primary JIRA interface -- ideally, not even be aware that JIRA is involved.\n\nThe biggest use-case I have is public opensource projects.  All communication happens over email, and there is very little distinction between an email and an issue, neither conceptually nor physically (the tracker is configured to send emails for new issues/comments). Frequently, long conversations are held via comments in an issue [1]\n\nFor established projects, a significant proportion (~40%) of non-cvs emails are generated by the issue tracker.  It would be a _massive_ timesaver if developers didn't need to run off to a web interface to comment on issues.\n\nJIRA has some rudimentary support for this (CreateOrCommentHandler), but JIRA-generated emails:\n - do not support threading (JRA-1113)\n - are IMHO pretty ugly and not easy to scan quickly compared to Bugzilla's. (JRA-3719)\n - do not customize the From: address to indicate who the commenter is. (JRA-2315)\n\nSo I think getting decent email support would be a fantastic way of capturing the lucrative open-source market.  More than any other feature, it would leapfrog JIRA over its competitors.\n\n----\n\nIf JIRA's email support was enhanced sufficiently, it could also be used as a support system backend, tracking support requests, not least here at Atlassian.  This is a whole new market, probably justifying a new product stream, but I think the enhancements mentioned above would give us an 80:20 solution.\n\n\n--Jeff\n\n\n[1] For example, see some of Mozilla's longer threads, like http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=97284 .",

For example PM post new issues to project and want to see it in project plan.\n\nWe need now use follow workaround. First we separate project by versions as project stages. We post issue and set \"Fix for Version\", and choose version for planed fixing issue. To ordering in versions we using priority. In result we have roadmap:\n1.0.1\n  Issue 01\n  Issue 02\n1.0.2\n  Issue 03\n  Issue 04\n1.0.3\n  Issue 05\n  Issue 06\n1.0.4\n  Issue 07\n  Issue 08\n\nBut we need follow:\nIssue must have link to depended issues (how we use for it link \"Depends\", we linking depended issues but it not affected on issues ordering in Road Map).\nIn Road Map, firstly show independed issues, follow its depends indended by space. The road map must look like a tree.\nFor example:\nRoad Map:\n1.0.1\n  Issue 01\n    Issue 02\n    Issue 03\n  Issue 04\n  Issue 05\n    Issue 06\n    Issue 07\n1.0.2\n  Issue 08\n    Issue 09\n  Issue 10\n\nIssues in one level will ordered as now in roadmap - by priority.\n\nThanks!\n",

Most of these units store their information on servers local to them.  \n\nIn the current process, we have the ability to create attachments for tasks, but this causes several problems for us.\n\n1)  We do not want to store duplicate documents.\n2)  We would have to purchase larger harddrive systems to store all this information that is currently stored on other servers.\n3)  The attachments can become outdated and would require dropping them and re-attaching the new documents.\n\nThe solution we would like to see implemented is to allow us to create links (with descriptions) to external resources.  Then the external units can continue to manage their documents per their process, and our users would always link to the most recent versions.\n\nThanks",

      "description": "Provide explanation of JDK and where to get it (from the minimum requirements spec). \n\nSee this email from a current user....\n\nHi Ben,\n\nThanks for your friendly email, a timely reminder for me. We have no time to evaluate this  month and possibly next, but certainly want to. We're using Seapine's Test track Pro right now and increasingly running into its limitations. A colleague recommended and was enamored with JIRA and that's how I came to download the evaluation version.\n\nMy initial observation on download was one of confusion as I'm no Java geek alas and your website at:\n\nhttp://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/docs/v1.4/requirements.jsp\n\nclaims that for the standalone demo I need:\n\n    Sun JDK 1.3 or above\n\nBut not only do I have no idea what this is, and find no further guidance on this web page, when I search for it on Google, the best I can come up with is:\n\nhttp://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/\n\nwhich doesn't really satisfy me as it just adds more acronyms and confusion. Nevertheless I somehow downloaded:\n\nj2sdk-1[1].4.2-nb-3.5-bin-windows.exe\nj2re-1_3_1_09-windows-i586.exe\n\nby following links from that page, but am frankly none the wise which, if any of these satisfies the \"Sun JDK 1.3 or above\" requirement.\n\nI would be most grateful if you could shed some light on that for me, and would suggest you add the clarifications to your web site, and perhaps some guidance as to where a prospective client might lay hands on it. \n\nCheers,\n\nBernd Wechner\nSonarData Pty Ltd\nbernd@sonardata.com\nhttp://www.sonardata.com\nPh: +61 3 6231 5588 \nFax: +61 3 6234 1822\n",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-2250].\n  {panel}\n\n(from jira-user mailing list):\r\n\r\nHi All,\r\n\r\nI wrote a quick and dirty little class to integrate JIRA with our\r\nexisting build notification process and figured I'd share it in case\r\nanyone is looking to do something similar.  \r\n\r\nOur build process is designed to send out an email when it is complete\r\nand included in the email is all the issues that were fixed in that\r\nbuild.  This is primarily for the benefit of our QA department.  Anyway I included a sample pic of what the email looks like (basically mimics JIRA).  The class also updates a custom field that we use for the build number.\r\n\r\nThere is some stuff that is specific to the way my company works so you would need to make some changes before using this.  I did try to\r\nexternalize most parameters into a props file, at least to make it\r\nuseable by multiple projects without recompiling, but there is still\r\nstuff that needs changing (like the base JIRA url) in the code.\r\n\r\nAnyway, if nothing else I figure its starting point for anyone else that might have the same kind of automatted processes.\r\n\r\n-Chris\r\n\r\nPs.  You'll also need to grab the MailMessage class from\r\nwww.servlets.com.",

So at first we thought one should log 4 hours, and \"Set a new estimate\" to 10 hours, which is incorrect -- it's actually estimated _time remaining_ on the task, not the task _estimate_. Sort of a difference between the thinking of a developer and a project manager.\n\nAdditionally, might be able to combine the \"Leave existing estimate\" and \"Set estimated time remaining\" into a single field, perhaps defaulting the original value?
