      "description": "h3. Summary\r\nWhen using a Kanban board, Portfolio will always assign at most 1 story per person per day, the exception for that is only when more than one story could be completed at the same day. The issue with this is that if an user is assigned, for example, a 32 work hour per week capacity (6.4h per day), Portfolio might skip almost full days if the rest of a story takes, let's say, 1h of that day to be finished, and there is no other story that is estimated for less than 5.4,  Portfolio skips the full 5.4h capacity of that day and the next story is only starting on the next day, stretching the scope plan and not using the full capacity as some might expect.\r\n\r\nh3. Affects\r\nAny version until now, it was tested on 2.24.0.\r\n\r\nh3. Description of the problem\r\nLet's say you have your Plan has a Kanban board configured with estimation in days, 8 working hours per day, 5 days per week, and a user is assigned several stories, with a 32 work hours per week for that user.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected\r\nIt might be expected to visualize consistent 4 days per week (32 hours as that user capacity) of work looking at the Capacity view of the Portfolio plan until the end of the scope planning. \r\n\r\nh3. Current behaviour\r\nJira shows inconsistent capacity estimation per days or hours (if you configured estimation in hours) per week, for example, 4 days in the first week, 3.6 days in the second week, 2.3 days in the third week and so on.\r\n\r\nThat happens because, let's say the biggest story has a 40 hours estimation. That story will take 6 full days (38.4 hours as Portfolio ignores the 8 hour working day and assumes a 6.4 hour working day because 32h/5d per week = 6.4) and 1.6 hours of the 7th day. The 7th day will still have 4.8 hours of capacity considering the 6.4 work hours for that user, however, if there is no story estimated less than 4.8 hours, Portfolio will skip the whole 4.8 hours of that day, and start the next story on the next working day.\r\nThat makes the capacity view show the following:\r\nWeek 1: 4 days (full 32h worked on one story)\r\nWeek 2: The 5th and 6th day are worked full 6.4 capacity as it is still the first story being worked on, but on the 7th day the plan only estimate 1.6 hours of that day capacity, going directly to the 8th day for the next story, leaving free capacity for no reason.\r\n\r\nh3. Additional information\r\nIt works well if you set 40 work hours for the user as Portfolio will always estimate full days. The issue here is that Portfolio ignores the 8 working hours per day configured in the plan settings and use 6.4 instead automatically.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n1) Always fill all the capacity in the case when weekly capacity is 32h, someone would need to estimate always in hours and the estimate values should  be always dividable by 6.4h\r\nor\r\n2) Exclude one of the working days, let's say Friday, having only 4 working days per week. That way Portfolio will correctly fulfill the capacity for a 32 work hour agent when estimating per days.\r\n",

Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nWhile having Portfolio active, do the following search:\r\n{code:java}\r\n\"Parent Link\" is EMPTY\r\n{code}\r\n_Or_\r\n{code:java}\r\n\"Parent Link\" is not EMPTY\r\n{code}\r\nh3. Expected Behavior\r\n * For *is EMPTY*, only issues without a Parent Link should be returned\r\n * For *is not EMPTY*, only issues with a Parent Link should be returned\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nThe results are returned in an _unexplainable_ way, e.g. issues *_without_* a Parent Link appear in *is not EMPTY* and do not appear in *is EMPTY*.\r\nh3. Note\r\n\r\nThe results of the 2 JQLs seem to be complements of each other. For example:\r\n * There're 100 issues, only 5 of which have a Parent Link\r\n * If *is not EMPTY* returns 20 (or any other number instead of 5)\r\n * Then *is EMPTY* returns the other 80\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nAs introduced by this comment on Feb 5, 2020:\r\n Parent Link is not EMPTY considers 3 types of \"parent links\": Parent Link from Portfolio, Epics and subtasks. To search issues with only the Parent Link custom field present, exclude the other possible links:\r\n{code:java}\r\n\"Parent Link\" is not EMPTY AND \"Epic Link\" is EMPTY\r\n{code}\r\nAnd to further exclude subtasks, if needed:\r\n{code:java}\r\n\"Parent Link\" is not EMPTY AND \"Epic Link\" is EMPTY AND issuetype in standardIssueTypes()\r\n{code}\r\nh3. Root cause\r\n\r\nThis happens because the \"Parent Link\" search keyword is an abstraction of parent links, going beyond the actual custom field with that name.\r\n JPOSERVER-2734 has been created to\u00a0{{Change the \"Parent Link\" search keyword so it doesn't conflict with the \"Parent Link\" custom field}}.",

Expected Behavior\r\nPortfolio should not treat it as dependency, as issue link in JIRA can have different usage/context for the users (who is not necessarily working on Portfolio Plan). Having dependency to be automatically translated as issue link in JIRA is fine, but not necessarily the other way around. As the issue link usage in JIRA is broader.  \r\nExample of use case:\r\n{quote}\r\nIn this use case; only some roles like Product-Owner, Scrum-Master, Release-Manager are working with Portfolio. But the other roles (such as developer, tester, designer) in the business unit are working with issues (stories, epics...) on JIRA's side or board. Therefore most of these roles (developer, tester, designer) will be using issue links on their Epic and/or tasks\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nh4. Actual Result\r\nPortfolio treats it as dependency. And the example (from steps to reproduce) will result in having dependency within the same hierarchy, and that can result in cyclic dependency when those issues being scheduled. \r\n\r\nNote on cyclic dependency\r\n{quote}\r\nThe general rule is that Live plan\u2019s algorithm bases itself on the Story level as it contains the actual work and everything else is just a helpful structure. In this case, the properties below or above are transferred back to the story level/or the most bottom level.

Environment\r\n\r\nJIRA Portfolio 2.18 and above\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1) Configure a Portfolio program based on more than one Portfolio Plans (i.e. the program scope are the plans)\r\n\r\nHierarchy: Program -> Plan -> Epic - Story\r\n\r\n2) Calculate Plan Scheduling for the plans - Notice that the Plan Schedules appear both under the \"Schedule\" and \"Scope\" tab\r\n\r\n3) Now navigate to the Portfolio program and check \"Scope\" tab. Notice that \"Scheduled Start\" and \"Scheduled End\" column values are empty while the plans appear as scheduled under the \"Schedule\" tab\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nPortfolio should consistently show that plans are scheduled both under the \"Scope\" and \"Schedule tab\"\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nActual results are inconsistent \u2013 some plans might \"scheduled start\" and \"scheduled end\" date, some will not\r\nh3. Notes\r\n\r\nThis behaviour is due to an inconsistency in how Portfolio calculates the schedule dates of items in the 'schedule' tab vs the 'scope' tab. In the 'schedule' tab the calculation is taking into account the schedule dates of the child issues, whereas the 'scope' tab is not. That means that if you have an Epic that is not explicitly estimated (but has estimates on its children), you will see that Epic as scheduled in the 'schedule' tab but not the 'scope' tab.\r\nh3.

Issue Summary\r\n\r\nIn Portfolio, a user can gain access to view and edit a plan through two general means:\r\n* By being designated as a Plan Editor in the Plan's permissions\r\n* By being granted the Portfolio User permission in Portfolio's general permissions\r\n\r\nHowever, these methods do not grant fully equivalent permissions and rights. Through either method a user will be able to view and edit a plan, but a user cannot create a Parent/Child link without the *Portfolio User* permission, as that permission is necessary to create and edit custom fields implemented by Portfolio.\r\n\r\nh3. Environment\r\nJira Portfolio 2.17.1\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\nInitial Setup:\r\n\r\n1. Create a brand new Software Project\r\n2. Create a brand new Portfolio Plan based on said Project\r\n3. Add a new Hierarchy Level above Epic, like in the following screenshot:\r\n !Portfolio Hierarchy.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\n4. Create a brand new User, ensuring that they are properly licensed to use Jira Software\r\n\r\nPermissions Setup:\r\n\r\n# Add the new User as an Editor to the Plan Permissions\r\n# Ensure the User does *not* have *Portfolio User* permission for Global Portfolio Permissions ([$JIRA_URL/secure/PortfolioPermissions.jspa])\r\n\r\nReproducing the Issue:\r\n\r\n# Create a new Initiative \r\n# Create a new Epic\r\n# Designate the Initiative as the parent of the Epic\r\n# Commit\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nIf a user with these permissions is expected to be able to establish Parent Links, then the linkage should succeed.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, an error/warning should be thrown in the UI prohibiting the User or otherwise warning them that the Link will not be possible.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nParent Link is not established and no error or warning is thrown in the UI.\r\n\r\nThe following error is thrown in logs:\r\n{code}2018-11-15 16:38:54,691 http-nio-8080-exec-9 WARN kliou92 998x3015x1 l373jd 0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1 /rest/jpo/1.0/issues/commit [c.a.r.j.customfields.parent.ParentCustomFieldHelper] Editability check for setting Portfolio parent link failed\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nh3.

Some teams use deeper levels of hierarchy like initiatives, epics, stories, but some are not familiar with Jira or just don't need any deeper levels than their action.\u00a0\r\n\r\nWhat teams want to see: their own actions and its progress.\r\nWhat C-levels want to see: a plan which can be filtered easily (not grouped) by team.\r\n\r\nThe possible solutions:\r\n1/ Resolve\u00a0JPOSERVER-223 :assign multiple teams to one issue, show a board for each team and the plan to C-levels with filtering by team.\u00a0\r\n\r\n2/ Each team is a component. Actions can be related to several components. Make a board for each team (component), and create a plan with all boards. This will auto-create the teams.
