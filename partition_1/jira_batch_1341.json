Summary\r\n\r\nOnly a part of the dropdown menu is visible. So Japanese users can tell which is which just after actually clicking the dropdown menu.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n# Set your browser's language to Japanese\r\n# Open user management page\r\n# Click *\u3059\u3079\u3066\u306e\u30e6\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc* (All users) dropdown\r\n# See both items state *\u30b5\u30a4\u30c8\u30a2\u30af\u30bb\u30b9\u304c...* (Site access is ...)\r\n\r\n !jac-ac-um.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nThe whole texts are visible.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nThe texts are truncated.\r\n\r\nh3. Notes\r\n\r\nThe tooltip should not be the best option in the dropdown menu. So consider widening the dropdown menu or using smaller font-size so that the whole texts become visible at first glance.\r\nThe approach of [Pseudo Localization @ Netflix|https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/pseudo-localization-netflix-12fff76fbcbe] might be helpful for native-English designers to ensure localized UX sustainably.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nNone. Consider adding yourself as a watcher to be kept informed as to the state of the bug moving forward. With that way, if our development team updates the ticket, you'll be notified via email.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Problem Definition\r\n\r\nAfter a Jira import is complete, regardless of whether the Outgoing mail is enabled or disabled, no email notifications will be sent to the imported users. However, the \"Last seen on site\" and \"Status\" shows a misleading message of \"Invitation pending\" and \"Invited\".\r\n !invited.png!\r\n\r\nIn addition to that, the \"Resend Invite\" also suggests that an invitation had been previously sent.\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nFor these users, change the wordings of the \"Last seen on site\" and \"Status\" to something else, such as \"Not seen on this site\" and \"Has site access\". The \"Resend Invitation\" should also be \"Send Invite\" instead.\r\n\r\nOn a related note, during the Jira import process, it is not stated whether the invitation emails are sent to the imported users (they will not be sent, regardless of whether Outgoing mail is enabled or disabled. see\u00a0ID-6780). It would be great if we can also make this clear during the import process or after the import is completed.\r\nh3. Why this is important\r\n\r\nWhen performing imports, it is a common practice to perform test imports prior to the production import. During test imports, we would not want any emails to be sent out to users, as it would cause confusion.\r\n\r\nThe misleading wordings used in the Cloud's User Management would cause Site-Admins to be alarmed, fearing that their users had been sent email invitations during the test import process.
