In the display options there is the \"Attachment\"  column. \n\nIt will be nice if the Attachments from the Drag and drop plug-in of Jira will show as a link or something in confluence with the use of the Macro. But when i select the column I don't see anything. If there is a attachment inside a jira issue which is inside the filter, the attachment field stays blank.\n\nIt's strange that the drag and drop system in Jira makes the file list under the heading \" AttachmentS \", while in Confluence the column name is \" Attachment \".\n\nHow can i solve this problem?\n\nFriendly Regards,\n\nTotal Company",

This is inconsistent with how non-custom fields are treated. For example here is a custom field:\n\n\"changelog\"=>{\"id\"=>\"14507\", \"items\"=>[{\"field\"=>\"Release notes\", \"fieldtype\"=>\"custom\", \"from\"=>nil, \"fromString\"=>\"Release this month!\", \"to\"=>nil, \"toString\"=>\"Release this month or next.\"}]}, \"timestamp\"=>1399311766637}\n\nIt seems to me that the \"field\" field should have contained \"customfield_10300\".\n\nFor built-in fields the key is used, e.g. \n\n\"changelog\"=>{\"id\"=>\"14510\", \"items\"=>[{\"field\"=>\"summary\", \"fieldtype\"=>\"jira\", \"from\"=>nil, \"fromString\"=>\"Shovel the snow\", \"to\"=>nil, \"toString\"=>\"Shovel the snow now\"}]}\n\nNote the lower case \"summary\".",

Different people find their own issues more important than others and claim priority over others. How can I 'score' my issues objectively?\n\nI would really like a calculator to compute business value based upon a number of questions like \"Are there many users/customers involved?\". Yes? then add 100 points, No? No points.\n\"Does my company suffer financial damage?\" Yes? 250 points, No? No points\n\"Is it easy to fix?\" Yes? 50 points, No? No points\n\"Is the issue law- or policy based?\" Yes? 150 points, No? No points etc. etc.\n\nThe sum of all these criteria result in my business value. Of course I can always add a (less objective score) number of points if my managers really want an issue ranked higher on the list...\n\nI currently use an Excel sheet to do this for me, but it would be nice if I could manage the criteria and the scores in each seperate project. Then (adding a new issue) I call up the calculator, answer the yes/no questions and click [adopt business value to issue].\n\nI hope more users like this idea.\n\nKind regards!",

We use a novell, and decided to use LDAP in order to allow users to login using their credentials. But, we've been running across issues. I've logged in several times with my credentials and somehow logged in with someone else's account. Although, I still have administration rights and it doesn't seem to move it to the users I log into. Another user who is also an admin is having the same issue herself, in which she logs in with my ID somehow. Also, we have testrail and integrated JIRA. When we push a ticket to our JIRA site, it'll have the issue come up then so sometimes it'll post the ticket with different user IDs than what it's supposed to be doing. \n\nI've tried re-adding the LDAP settings to make sure I'm doing it right, but this issue has become a daily issue.\n\nWe are using JIRA v6.2.2 and SuSE Enterprise Server 11 SP2 (using VMWare)\n\nPlease assist!

Although we already set up the way you instructed, which is below, the tickets are still auto assigned to one of our guys. And for some reasons, that guy actually has two names appearing in the system under the same email address.I feel this could be a problem and cause unnecessary redundancy and inconsistency to our ticketing system. \n\nBelow is the answer you gave us before, we did exactly what you told us to. But the problem is still happening.\n\nThis is actually configured in the Administration \u00bb Projects \u00bb 'Your Project' \u00bb Roles (tab) screen - you can see in the top a Default Assignee option, which you can select \"Unassigned\". Just make sure the Allow unassigned issues flag is turned on in the General Configuration settings in JIRA.\n\nI understand this is not the first time we get to you on this issue and please forgive for all those troubles. \n\nFeel free to call at 6463804320 for further questions or details. \n\nRegards,\nGabrielle Yang | Jr. Linux System Administrator | eXelate\n\n7 West 22nd Street, 9th Floor, New York, NY 10010\n",

The reason was - the docs say nothing about plan configuration in Bamboo to make the gadget work. There is only information about Application Links and Authorization. To fix this it would be great to put on this page addition information that to get the pretty picture like the one attached to page, user needs to have Clover integration enabled in Bamboo plan. Otherwise the error will be displayed and for a long time I was thinking I did something wrong with the applinks. It's good that we have Clover developer here in Gdansk (Marek Parfianowicz) who helped me with that. It would be great if the additional information about Clover could be added to this page.\n\nMy suggestion: on the https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Adding+the+Clover+Coverage+Gadget page there is information border about integrating Bamboo and JIRA. My suggestion is to add there information about Bamboo integration with Clover: https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/BAMBOO/Using+Bamboo+with+Clover",

      "description": "We have a customer with a large JIRA (1M issues) and every two weeks they have to restart JIRA because it is running out of file descriptors. We increased the system setting from 30K to 300K descriptors but it still happens eventually. We're using SSD for the JIRA home directory\n\nI've done some investigation and found that on the production JIRA using lsof and the counts on the Lucene issue index files increase every 5 minutes or so. On staging it's only once or twice per day. The rate is lower at weekends, so it is human-related. What happens is that the same 60 different index files have new file descriptors added, but the old file descriptors are not closed. There is also an error that appears at the same time in the JIRA log file:\n\n\"Tried to reopen the IndexReader, but it threw AlreadyClosedException. Opening a fresh IndexReader.\"\n\nThis comes from DefaultIndexEngine and is where a new Lucene IndexReader is created if the previous one is believed closed. I suspect that the previous IndexReader may not have been really closed.\n\nThere is a comment right in that place in the source code. It's the \"don't worry\" that makes me think there is still a problem around here!\n\n// JRADEV-7825: Really this shouldn't happen unless someone closes the reader from outside all\n                        // the inscrutable code in this class (and its friends) but\n                        // don't worry, we will just open a new one in that case.\n\n\nThis is similar symptoms but apparently a different cause than https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRAKB/Loss+of+Functionality+due+to+Too+Many+Open+Files+Error",

There are good reasons to do that since ActionConfiguration.getActionCommand() causes a lot of requests to Configuration.get()\n\nThough in the same thread JiraWebworkViewDispatcher.getActionConfiguration() ActionConfiguration.getActionCommand() is called again later which makes the caching less useful. JiraWebworkViewDispatcher should also call the caching code within method LookupAliasActionFactoryProxy.getActionImpl(). One could factor out the the caching code into a separate module and inject it in all places where ActionConfiguration is needed.\n\nI have checked the source for 6.2.3 but likely earlier version also show this behaviour.\n\nThis is easy to fix and should make it's way into at least 6.3.x. My tests showed that the overall response time when calling a webwork action drops from 300 to 250 ms.  \n\nRegards,\nDieter",

This is a nice way to track a threaded conversation -- much better than email.  Sometimes the set of posts can be very long.  It would be nice to number the posts in order to refer to them.  For example, it would be nice to say something like \"see Bob's post #12 in issue XYZ-42.  \n\nFurther, it would be nice to be able to link to individual posts using post ids.  Yes, I know you can create or access a permanent link to each post, but that's not useful in a conversation. Instead of an obscure sequence of letters and numbers, posts could be referenced using the issue number and the post number.  For example, XYZ-42.12 would refer to post #12 in issue YXZ-42.\n\nThanks for considering this for a future release.",

However, if a reload of the form is needed (i.e.: a change in the type of issue), the form does not show the button any more.\n\nThe described behaviour can be seen in the attacched video: Custom_button_does_not_render_properly.mp4\n\nInspecting HTML generated code for the form it seems that the problem is that in second and subsequent reloads the JavaScript code in the description of the field is not been applied and therefore the HTML code of the button is not generated. \n\nCould you please give a look to this behaviour? Thanks in advance.\n\nRegards.",

I am very glad to see the feature being added to the new designer.  The one drawback I've noticed about the way that it has been implemented is that the transition id numbers are no longer listed next to the transition names like they were in the classic designer.  This becomes problematic when you have multiple transitions with the same name but different properties leading to the same destination step.  If you want to make a transition common with one of those, there is no good way to figure out the proper transition to choose.  Your only choices are trial and error or temporarily editing your transition names.\n\nIn short, I'd like to see the transition ids added to the \"Transition to reuse\" dropdown on the \"Reuse a transition\" tab.",
