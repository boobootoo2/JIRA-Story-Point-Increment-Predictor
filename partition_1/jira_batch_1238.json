See attached screenshot, a few people already told me they thought it was a default feature of JIRA ;)\n\nCheers,\nAdrien\n",

Summary of Bug\n\nWhen using the Wiki Style Renderer, there are times when the spacing between the bullets are not shown correctly. \n\nh3. Steps to replicate\n\n# In the comment or description of an issue, enter the following (as an example) :\n{noformat}\n* *test*\n** one\n** two\n* *test two*\n** one\n** two\n{noformat}\n# The preview of it would show the following :\n!preview.png|thumbnail!\n# However, when inserted into JIRA, the result would be the following :\n!result.png|thumbnail!\n\nh3. Additional Info\n\n* Everything seems to show fine if there is an empty space placed in between the two main points, like the following :\n{noformat}\n* *test*\n** one\n** two\n\n* *test two*\n** one\n** two\n{noformat}\n\n* Behavior is also different if the main points (test and test two) is not *bold* - Here is the preview :\n!without bold preview.png|thumbnail!\nand here is the result :\n!without bold result.png|thumbnail!",

In our previous version of Jira (5.0.7) the reports appeared in a drop down menu, but not sorted too. I was looking for some configuration option to allow report sorting but I can't find it.\n\nIt would be woderfull if we could grant permission to certain roles to get access to this reports, or any section, issue screen (fields visibility without using Behaviours plugin), etcetera. \n\nThank you\nBest regards\n\n\n\n",

Therefore, we are careful to use the same component names across projects as we hope for a fix for JRA-8663.  It's useful to us to use the Two-Dimensional Filter Statistics widget to report on the state of issues across the various projects in a release, but I realized that, with Component on the X-axis, the widget treats each component from each project individually, rather than combining like-named components into a single column.  I would like the option to be made available (probably as a checkbox) to group like-named columns or rows together.  In the case of the Component field, the JQL would go from \"project in (PROJ1,PROJ2,PROJ3) AND component = 'Reporting' AND project = PROJ1\" to just \"project in (PROJ1,PROJ2,PROJ3) AND component = 'Reporting'\".",

The \"associations\" are merely an n-to-n mapping of Jira Id and git hash. The associations could be modified through Jira or Stash. And, if possible, it would be convenient to still trigger associations by including the Jira Id in the commit message as we do now. In the latter case, the commit message would not itself represent the association - it merely initiates the association; one could subsequently remove this association without touching the commit message.\n\nDue to the immutable history of git commits, I was surprised I was unable to find anyone else asking for this (save a few two-year-old requests for this for integration with svn).",

Background of Request\n\nAs of now, JIRA is unable to restrict some of its groups to be synchronized to applications that integrated with its user management, for example Confluence. In a huge organization, Confluence may not need all of JIRA groups to be synchronized.\n\nHowever, since those groups are still synchronize to Confluence, administrator  need to manage those unnecessary groups in Confluence.\n\nh3. Proposed Solution\n\nProvide a field for administrators to restrict group(s) to be synchronized. If this fields able to understand lucene syntax (for example) it would be helpful. So administrators can restrict multiple groups in one sentence such as:\n\n{code}jira_*, administrators{code}\n\nThe above syntax mentioned means Confluence will not be able to sync any groups that start with {{jira_}} and {{administrators}} groups.",

It would be great if the add-button gets focus because i'm used to just entering a comment, hitting tab, then enter to submit the comment.\n\nIn jira on the other hand i need to enter my comment, hit tab 4 times and then hit space or enter to submit. Not really productive and handy, certainly for a keyboard junky like me who prefers to leave his mouse alone when he can.\n\nPS: CMD+Enter submitting could work too, as long as i don't have to tab 4 times it's ok :)",

For example, a user can import a PEM public cert and a PKCS12 private key into a PrivateKeyEntry that would be awesome. Maybe we could even put in some checks to ensure the cert chain is complete?
