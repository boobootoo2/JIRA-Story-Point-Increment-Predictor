For example: If there are several branches aligned to an specific commit and there is one branch checked out, it is useful to be able to distinguish it easily.\r\n * Improving Dark theme. I have tried it and colours are not that good in my opinion. I would check dark theme colours from apps like SublimeText, Atom or Intellij and try to improve Sourcetree Dark theme.\r\n * Tree graph is somehow difficult to follow compared to other tree graphs (check out gitx Tree graph). And It could even contain some information in each circle such in GitKraken. I would also align it to the center as when having only 1 line as a tree it is aligned to the left making it less visible.\r\n * I would another search option suc in gitx where a user can search in the full list of commits for a keyword, say Atlassian and then all commits containing in the commit message that keyword are highlighted in a different colour\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nHope this suggestions help in making event better this great tool!",

In fact I have been upgrading source tree over the course of the past year I've been using it and this bug has always been there.\r\n\r\nPlease let me emphasize how \"critical\" this bug is towards productivity. From a software perspective \"is there a work around, etc, etc\" yes. Of course. But please understand that SourceTree & SCM is \"Productivity Software\". It exists SOLELY to make productivity better. Enhancements for all sorts of crazy use cases is awesome, but 98% of the time users use SourceTree / Git, it is to check in code. That's like so vanilla of a use case that we just take it for granted that it just works. This bug is soooo frustrating every time because if I have to select 2 files to check in, it doubles the time it should take me to do a check in. If I have 10 files, it's a 10x tax. If I need 100 files its 100x. The more files we need to check in, the MORE we need productivity software. But ironically this bug scales linearly with the value that SourceTree provides.\r\n\r\nThis is simply a plea to appropriately consider the \"criticality\" and priority of this bug from the total value loss perspective. It's a shame that a the image of a very very solid product is tainted in my mind due to a very minor bug that affects me 98% of the time I use the software.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your consideration and providing this wonderful software.",

I believe that removing the icons would:\r\n * Reduce vertical space for menu items allowing for easier comparison between the first character for scanning\r\n * Reduce visual noise, the color of the icons interferes with hierarchy in the list as it itself is not very important but is treated as such (first in order, colored vibrantly)\r\n\r\nThanks for your hard work and great product!",
