Summary:\r\n\r\nAs a Crowd administrator, I would like to use OKTA SSO (SAML) for my Atlassian applications, however, my idea is to have only Crowd integration with OKTA and acting as a bridge app in between OKTA and Jira/Confluence/Bitbucket. This means that if an unauthenticated user logs to Confluence, Confluence sends an authentication request to Crowd and Crowd talks to OKTA to get the SAML Authentication done.\r\nh4. Scenario:\r\n * User tries to access Confluence/Jira.\r\n * They reach Crowd Logon page.\r\n * They insert their user and password which is authenticated against the information in OKTA.\r\n * OKTA sends the confirmation to Crowd.\r\n * Crowd redirects to the application being requested.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\nh4. How does SAML Works?\r\n\r\nEach application needs to be SAML Versed in order for them to be able to integrate with Okta. The way we establish this is by either using the Connectors provided by Okta (available for Jira and Confluence only) or through third party plugins provided by vendors such as Mini Orange(e.g).\r\n\r\nOnce that's done, we integrate those applications with Okta with the aid of those plugins as well. At this point, the applications will know that login requests should go to Okta to be processed and will also know how to read a SAML response accordingly.\r\nh4. Considerations:\r\n\r\nThe scenario explained above seems ambiguous, since both Crowd and Okta in their scenario seem to have the same or very similar proposal which is to act as the IdP. However, even though this is similar, it can be important for some organizations or companies.",

We also have our \"jira\" groups created locally in the crowd instance.\r\n\r\nUsing the above approach gives the following issues:\r\n * To have multiple directories with the same config (except the URL), is errorprone and its easy to do a mistake with one directory when updating its config.\u00a0\r\n * Since all groups are created in the primary directory, we *must* use directory aggregation in order to have the groups if the users logs in from the failover group. However directory aggregation is not wanted for our other directories with customer users.\r\n * It\u00b4s not possible from the failover directory to filter out who can authenticate (e.g. users in the confluence-users group only, instead everyone must be able to authenticate in crowd --> we need to have higher crowd license than nescessary.\r\n * Crowd must duplicate the same users since it need to fetch them again to all directories, unless using delegated authentication directory.

      "description": "h3. Issue Summary\r\n\r\nWhen calculating license usage for users that have empty external ids the calculation will fail on the application's side with a NullPointerException.\r\n\r\nThis can typically happen in directories with a nullable external id attribute by definition or when the external id attribute was misconfigured. Internal directories generally should not be affected by this issue as default external ids are generated for those directories.\r\n\r\nWhile Crowd does augment external ids provided to applications, it will relay a null or empty external id as a null, so the issue can occur both when the directory is defined in Jira/Confluence/BBS as well as when it's a directory defined in the Crowd defined for that application.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Setup a directory which has at least one user with an empty external id in Jira/Confluence/BBS\r\n # Setup license monitoring for that application\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nThe license usage is calculated.\r\nh3.

While the issue generally should not occur for internal directories the external_id column in the cwd_user table could be populated manually for those users.",

This operation is not required to happen that often. For example such a token could be updated every couple of seconds to avoid unnecessary sql update statements which create additional load on the database and also saturate the database connection pool in Crowd.\r\n * During verification if the connected application making request to Crowd is correctly authenticated, Crowd creates many instances of ApplicationImpl in the same thread. Because ApplicationImpl holds a bunch of references to other tables (directories, webhooks etc) instantiating it turns out to be quite time consuming (to fetch data from the db). The ApplicationImpl instance could be created only once and stored in a thread-local manner.\r\n * \u00a0AutoGroupAdderListener is not optimized as it processes SSO logins related events twice, but it could do it only once. According to internal benchmarks it has a significant performance hit for user authentication requests.\u00a0",

      "description": "h3. Problem Definition\r\n\r\nAn administrator wants an option on Crowd internal directory to configure the application to enforce a minimum 24 hours password lifetime. The idea is to avoid having users resetting or updating their passwords during that period. This option is not available yet.\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nCrowd should have a parameter inside its configuration tab to allow administrators to configure the application to enforce a minimum password lifetime before users could be allowed to reset or update the password again.\r\n\r\nh3. Why this is important\r\n\r\nAn insufficiently long password lifetime allows authorized users to reuse old passwords with greater ease and frequency despite the password history feature. This more readily enables brute-force attacks and password predictability, elevating the attacker's chances to gain account access. A short or nonexistent password age would let a user repeatedly reset or update his password quickly enough to allow him to revert to an old password in a short period of time while still satisfying the unique password history requirement.",

This could result in duplicate groups as well as groups not matching downstream applications\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Install Crowd\r\n # Set up two groups (group names below are using - to represent a space character for ease of reading):\r\n ** {{test-group}}\r\n ** {{test--group}}\r\n # Run a Backup of Crowd\r\n # Try to restore the backup to the same or a different Crowd instance\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nThe import/restore will succeed.\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nThe import/restore will fail due to duplicate group names, OR the import will succeed but the group name will have changed.\r\n\r\n*If the import fails due to duplicates:*\r\n\r\nThe below exception is thrown in the atlassian-crowd.log file:\r\n{noformat}\r\nERROR [atlassian.crowd.migration.GroupMapper] Could not add com.atlassian.crowd.model.group.InternalGroup@7faf32d0[id=15204648,name=test group,type=GROUP,active=true\r\n{noformat}\r\nAnother error will also be thrown indicating a violation of a unique key constraint has happened.

Notes\r\n\r\nExtra spaces seem to only be possible in between words. Crowd will not allow the creation of groups with leading or trailing spaces.\r\nh3. Workaround\r\nh4. Option 1 - Remove The Group (if unused)\r\n# Run the below DB query to get a list of all groups that have 2 (or more) spaces in their name:\r\n{code:java}\r\nselect * from cwd_group where group_name LIKE '%  %';\r\n{code}\r\n# Check to see if any users are assigned to this group, using the {{id}} returned in the previous query:\r\n{code:java}\r\nselect * from cwd_membership where parent_id = <id from above>;\r\n{code}\r\n# If no results are returned, then you can safely delete this group and re-run the export. If results are returned, then the group may be in use. Check downstream applications (Jira, Confluence, etc) to see if permissions or access is based on membership in this group. If so, proceed to Option 2\r\n\r\nh4. Option 2 - Manually Modify the XML File\r\n # Open the XML file and do a search for the group ID (found in the first query above). You will need to manually change the group name for every entry in a {{<group>}} or {{<membership>}} parent tag.\r\n (!) Do not do a global find/replace, as if you have duplicate directories, it will change both, and the issue will still exist\r\n # Save the file, and re-run the import.\r\n # Groups (with extra spaces) will be imported now.",
