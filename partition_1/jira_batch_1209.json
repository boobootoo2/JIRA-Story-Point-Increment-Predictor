Note: this assumption needs to be tested, the MailHandler might set a default 'bulk' value) \n{quote}\n\nWe think the doc need to add more information, as in it does not include the \"multipart/report\" cases, it does not mention that *not* configuring \"bulk\" will include those emails in the regular process (see note above) and does not makes it clear enough that configuring 'bulk' means those bulk emails will not create issues/comments.\n\n",

All solutions provided on the forums were workarounds and that Jira itself was not designed to support \"soft deletes\". \n\nWe feel that ticket information is very important.  Not only you lose the ticket and its history but also every work log entries of time tracking.  Since the data really belongs to us, the customer, we feel this is unacceptable.\n\nWe would appreciate if the Jira team corrects this design flaw and not closes it as done with similar issue: JRA-21831.\n\nThanks in advance,\nCustomer",

This is weird because you may create issues way in advance of including them into a release. This makes an inaccurate trend line which I believe is supposed to show an anticipated completion date for all issues in a release based on velocity.

So it should be:\n\n_The status 'x' can't be removed_\n\n*Message content*\n\nThe message says _Statuses cannot be removed from draft workflows._\n\nThis doesn't describe the problem or tell me how to fix it. It also doesn't fit with our \"friendly, yet concise\" tone and certainly isn't human sounding. Perhaps something better:\n\n_Statuses can't be removed from workflows that are in use. It's possible that an issue is using the status you're trying to delete. In order to delete this status you might need to migrate any issues to a new status._\n\n_More information on configuring workflow (link)_\n\n* https://developer.atlassian.com/design/1.4/foundations/language/\n* https://developer.atlassian.com/design/1.4/components/modal-dialog/\n\n",
