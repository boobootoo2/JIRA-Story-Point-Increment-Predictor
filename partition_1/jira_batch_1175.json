In current JIRA, each time you create new role, they appear in project role. Some role have almost same name than other role, and they aren't used by this project.\nIf we can choose a schema of role we can choose the role used by project only and hide unused roles (that allow to see needed role only and we aren't flooded by not needed role).\nThanks in advance for your help.\nSorry if suggestion already exist but i don't see it.\n\nRegards,\nMickael",

Problem Definition\nCurrently by default JIRA doesn't allow any two factor authentication.\n\nh3. Suggested Solution\nIt would be great if we could integrate JIRA with Radius server which will allow two factor authentication to be setup with ease \n\nh3. Customer justification\n{panel}\nWe want to open up JIRA outside of the network for external consultants, but due to strict policies we have to have two-factor authentication in place.\nWe used Duo Security for a while. They had made a plugin for JIRA that made this possible. If you tried to log on to JIRA outside of our network, Duo's system kicked in and asked for authentication via sms / mobile app. Upon succesfull authentication you were then routed into JIRA. \nUnfortunetly they havent kept the plugin up to date, so it stopped working with newer versions of JIRA.\nAll of our internal users have access to JIRA functions via their Active Directory user (be it jira-users or customers for our JSD), and with a Radius server in between to handle the authentication of the users we could use Duo Integration with Radius to get the two-factor solution in place using their AD users.\n{panel}",

I've done JIRA work for two very large, public companies and I know for a fact that they have business projects that aren't remotely related to software but still use Agile methods. I even have a personal instance of JIRA which I use to track my work and I want to use Agile boards for non-software projects. I do think it is a good idea to make Source Management project specific.\n\nAllow us to pick and choose which projects get Agile and Source Management but don't bundle it into \"Project Types\".",

Summary\nWhen creating a new issue from JIRA and dragging and dropping an attachment, it will prevent interaction with the currently loaded issue, whether the issue is actually created or not.\n\nh3. Environment\n* JIRA 7.0.0-OD-08-001\n\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\n# Visit any issue in JIRA (the issue only occurs on top of another issue, not from dashboard)\n# Click to *Create* a new issue\n# Drag an attachment to the window, being careful not to drag it to the actual attachment panel. It must select the whole page, like this:\n!Screen Shot 2015-10-12 at 16.18.58.jpg|thumbnail!\n# Either submit the ticket or click cancel.\n# Attempt to click anything that can usually be interacted with on the ticket that remains on the screen\n\nh3. Expected Results\nYou would normally be able to click around on the issue that remains behind.\n\nh3. Actual Results\nNo errors in the logs, nothing in Network Console.\n\nh3.Workaround\n* Manually attach file by clicking *Browse*\n* Drag directly to attachment panel",

Expected Results\r\n\r\nThe screen deletion page should show an error message and prevent screen deletion.\r\n\r\nThe screens page still shows a list of all existing screens despite the existence of a missing screen in a workflow.\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nThe screen deletion page allows the screen to be removed.\r\n\r\nThe screens page shows a blank list of screens.\r\nh3.

This makes it harder to find people you want to include in work on a ticket.\n\nCompounding the problem, matches in the email address are bolded even though this is _not_ used for the list of suggested users. See JRA-59230.\n\n\nh3. Environment\n* Reproduced in JIRA 6.3.12, 6.3.15, 6.4.12\n\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\n# In a fresh JIRA installation create user accounts using the data in this list: [^mention-test-users.txt]\n# Go to a JIRA issue and create a comment\n# Enter text \"@jo\" and observe which users are shown.  Also note that \"jo\" at beginning of the email address is shown in bold like the matches in username and full name:\n!mention-jo.png|thumbnail!\n# Add an \"h\" onto the @mention, e.g. \"@joh\".\n\nh3. Expected Results\n\nThe JEDY235544 account should be shown in the list of suggested users due to match on \"johnston.cory@example.com\".\n\nh3. Actual Results\n\nThe JEDY235544 account is not suggested, only the accounts where the first name, last name, or username start with \"joh\".\n\nh3. Notes\n\nWe can see that the REST calls are returning 10 users using a \"contains\" search.  The JavaScript component searches within those results.\n* [^mention-rest-jo.txt]\n* [^mention-rest-joh.txt]\n\nh3. Suggested Solution\n\nMake the @mention JavaScript component search on email addresses. [^option1-SearchEmail.patch.txt]\n\nIn the meantime, we should stop bolding matches in the email address. [^option2-NoEmailBolding.patch.txt]. See JRA-59230.\n\n_(I was unable to test the patches because I had trouble running JIRA from source.  I hope they are helpful to illustrate the problem.)_",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-45635].\n  {panel}\n\nh3. Problem Definition\nRelying on MIME type information regarding JIRA issue attachments supplied by browsers can often be unreliable, causing JIRA to store attachment data with wrong MIME types in the database. This could lead to minor issues on how this attachments should be handled when downloading from the issue since the content-header is set wrongly based on the wrong MIME type recorded in the database.\n\nh3. Suggested Solution\nA minor validation e.g. based on known file extensions should be used to determine the most appropriate file type when storing attachment data.\n \nh3. Notes \n* It initially appeared JIRA already had such a feature based on https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRA-871. However after a report from a customer, I was able to personally reproduce a scenario where JIRA basically stores the wrong MIME type (text/pdf instead of application/pdf) when a PDF file was uploaded to JIRA using Firefox with corrupt MIME type definitions library. Basically this caused issues when downloading the pdf files in other browsers because the browsers tried to render the PDF file as a text file based on the content headers sent by JIRA, resulting in gibberish characters outputted on the screen.",
