Clicking files in the left pane doesn't do anything, the spinning circle just stays there. Also clicking the \"Create Review\" button inside the frame for the commit also produces a review dialog that doesn't properly work. The Firefox Web Developer tools doesn't report any JavaScript errors.\r\n\r\nI've attached crucible_frame.html which is the HTML driving our frameset.\r\n\r\nI've been working around the problem using the handy \"This Frame > Open Frame in New Tab\" feature of Firefox, but others are annoyed because Chrome doesn't have this menu.\r\n\r\nI've just tested it on these browser versions, and found out the page renders/loads fine in IE9, I hadn't tried IE at all until now:\r\nFirefox 24.0\r\nChrome 30.0\r\nInternet Explorer 9.0",

      "description": "In Crucible 3.1 we have introduced the following changes to the way reviews can be shared:\r\n\r\n- We removed the _Email review_ link from the tools as it as providing the same content as _Download review as text_. \r\n\r\n- We removed the _Send reminder_ link from the tools menu to promote using the sharing button instead.\r\n\r\n- If review is overdue the _Share_ link says _Send reminder_ instead and clicking on it opens the share dialog with the list of uncompleted reviewers pre-selected. \r\n\r\nThose changes should be reflected in the documentation for the latest Crucible:\r\n- [Sending a review's comments via email|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/CRUCIBLE/Sending+a+review%27s+comments+via+Email] should be amended: the user will have to download the comments as text via _Download review as text_ and then use the generated txt file to send it via their own email client.\r\n- [Using review reminders|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/CRUCIBLE/Using+Review+Reminders] should be changed in the _Manual Reminders_ section and describe the new behaviour of the _Share_ button.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nSten",

I am perfectly happy using the REST API and need not have it in the UI per the issue you referenced.\r\n\r\nI need a way so that as an administrator I can delete old, irrelevant reviews. The REST API only allows for reviews to be deleted if they are abandoned and it only allows you to abandon reviews you own. I believe it should allow an administrator to delete reviews directly regardless of state.\r\n\r\nI would be fine to use a direct database manipulation to accomplish this but I expect a supported solution. That is after all part of why we pay for our licenses.\r\n\r\nWe have 8000 code reviews and want to delete about 6000 of them, this is not something I can ask the team to do individually via the UI.\r\n{quote}",

We have a large repository that hosts code for a few different projects.  the repo layout is different per project\r\n\r\ne.g.\r\n\r\n//foo/baa/projectA-main\r\n//foo/baa/projectA-branch1\r\n//foo/baa/projectA-branch2\r\n\r\n//foo/baa/quxx/other-main\r\n//foo/baa/quxx/other-branch1\r\n//foo/baa/quxx/other-branch2\r\n\r\n//foo/baa/projectB-main\r\n//foo/baa/projectB-branch1\r\n//foo/baa/projectB-branch2\r\n\r\nThere dont seem to be any options on how to setup branches.  If we import the whole repo it assigns commits to the wrong branches. It also reports crazy stats like we have half a billion LoC, the largest project in this repo is half a million LoC\r\nI have also tried to setup crucible with just two branches import mainline and one other and limit the changelists imported, then crucible defines the branch as \"main\" all lower case, which afaik does not exist, our main branch is called MAINLINE.\r\n\r\nVersion is crucible 3.0 (which is not in the list below) and the HTML title says fisheye 3.0.3\r\n\r\nBranches in P4 are defined in two steps a repo path (like SVN) and a branchspec which is really just a mapping across 2 paths.  We almost always havea branch spec for a path but perhaps not always and we certainly have branch specs that do not have paths.  In the smaller test run we have a branchspec that matches the path name at the root and this is what we mean by branch\r\n\r\ne.g.\r\npath is //foo/baa/\r\nbranch path is \r\n//foo/baa/PROJA_BR1\r\nbranchspec is called PROJA_BR1  which maps \r\n//foo/baa/MAINLINE/... //foo/baa/PROJA_BR1/...\r\n\r\nThis shopuld be the most standard case and for crucible to be sueful we would need this case to work as a minimum",

This is independent from the permission scheme. \r\n\r\nIt would be nice if there is a possibility to do this in FishEye/Crucible as well. It takes a lot more time to create a new group and a new permission scheme for each project that has external workers than to let a project administrator add a single user in a project role in \"People\" in JIRA. This is preferable to having 40 permission schemes for 40 projects with external workers, because then changing the permissions will create overhead.\r\n\r\nIn FishEye it is better than in Crucible, since in FishEye there are no permission schemes but only direct permissions of the groups and only \"yes/no\" options (see the repository or not), but here also a new group for each external worker would have to be created.\r\n",

There may be a way, but exploring with my mouse does not make it wake up to offer me the option.\r\n\r\nBecause I am also, foolishly, running this within a VM (because the code review tool is on the company internet, and because VPN is configured with busted proxy options -- not your problem, but part of the world we live in -- I run the VPN in a VM -- plus it is safer for my employer anyhow) I am now able to see all of SIX lines of code, total, around the place where I made my comment.  I'm doing my best to minimize everything ELSE here so that I get more vertical space, but this is not exactly first-class on your part.\r\n\r\nNote that I am aware that 3.0.2 exists, but I could not tell from the upgrade options if this was for the server (not my problem) or client (my problem).  It seemed unlikely that it was for me (isn't it all pushed from the server?) but who can tell for sure?",
