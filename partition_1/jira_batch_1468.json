But this brings problem how to show this if there is no common descendant yet.  users expects the rightmost version on file revision slider is the most recent version of the file, but there is no really newer/older relation between commits of no common descendant.\r\n * stop adding same file more than once, visualise linear version slider as commit graph?

Having no other idea what makes Crucible complain, we rebased and removed that file and suddenly everything was working again.\r\n\r\nSo obviously there is something wrong in processing changes that contain filenames with unicode characters. I wonder that no one ran into this problem before (at least I didn't find a ticket related to that problem).\r\n\r\nTo reproduce the issue: just add a file containing unicode characters to the git repository (i.e. \u0410\u0413\u0413\u0417.txt) and let Crucible index the changes. That should trigger the error.",
