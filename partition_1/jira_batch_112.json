      "description": "Staging hunks in large files has become a serious chore. If I'm only staging one hunk, no worries, but the more I stage, the more time the pane refreshes, loads, and waits. It's really frustrating when it continuously re-selects the staged version of the file, rather than the unstaged that I've just intentionally manually selected.\r\n\r\nI've recorded a video of my interaction with it, which is typical of my usual workflow, including the frustration with staging. It's affecting how I work, to the point where I do it less to avoid the frustration until the end and batch it all up to the end.\r\n\r\n_File upload limit is 10MB so I have uploaded this 22MB video elsewhere._\r\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1fbfKCwZQROllgJYxnyqsV8S7tAXrNf0f/view?usp=sharing\r\n\r\nWhen watching the video, pay careful attention to the cursor movement and clicks. Please review the entire video. The cursor reveals my intent and attempts to anticipate the unexpected/undesired re-selection, and fails.\r\n\r\nThis Sourcetree behavior is exceedingly frustrating, especially when working with many large files.\r\n\r\nPlease leave a comment if you have any questions or need anything clarified.",

The column wasn't labeled, with a header or tooltip text, so I didn't know what it was even called, until I posted in the beta forum and learned its name.\r\n\r\nIf tooltip text on column-header-hover could have revealed that that column is called \"Build Status\", that would have been one good step, but better than that, a contextual popup menu when right-clicking that column header could say \"Hide Build Status Column\". I intuitively attempted both of these to resolve my issue myself, with no luck.\r\n\r\nThere is a more elaborate and complete solution which is to include a \"Columns\" sub-menu in the View menu, which lets you check on and off any columns you'd like. With this approach, you wouldn't need to literally label the Build Status column itself, because it would already be categorized and named by this submenu. This could be very useful, as I've also historically wanted to turn off the Commit hash column\u00a0since it's just visual clutter for me and if I need the hash, I can simply right-click the column and copy it from there (a great feature).\r\n\r\nSome UX to consider.
