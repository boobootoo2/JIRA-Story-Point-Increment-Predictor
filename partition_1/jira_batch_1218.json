I can understand that this is needed for layout purposes but I think that truncation should happen at a different length, depending on the screen resolution, not a fixed one, as it is now.\n\nCould you please look into this?\n\nThanks,\nPetru",

Steps to reproduce\n\n\n- Go to confluence and delete your jira acess token http://confluence/users/revokeoauthtokens.action\n- Create a new confluence page with a colon ( : ) on its name. Page url should be something like http://confluence/something/yourpagewithcolon:intherurl\n- In a test issue try to link that recently created confluence  page.\n- It'll ask you to do the login dance. Do it\n- Click on link button\n- [ BUG ] It'll prompt again to do the login dance. No matter how many times you do the dance, it won't accept the link. And it will create as much tokens for the jira instance on confluence as tries to do the dance.\n\n*Note that this only ocurrs with that particular url I've tried a clean url one https://extranet.atlassian.com/display/~scia/test and it works fine.*\n\nh2. Workaround\n\n- On the confluence page you want to link go to Tools/Page History\n- Click on CURRENT version link\n- Use that url to link to the issue. (Should be something similar to _yoursite.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=number_)",

This reduces build & experiment harness complexity by obviating the need to edit bundled script with JIRA standalone.\n\nFor example, heap sizes; which are hard coded in {{setenv.sh}} for the standalone Tomcat.\n\nUsing Bash Parameter Expansion, these values can be pulled from the parent shell environment or use a default if not specified. From the {{bash}} manual page:\n{quote}\n$\\{parameter:-word}\n              Use Default Values.  If parameter is unset or null, the expansion of word is substituted.  Otherwise, the value of parameter is substituted.\n{quote}\n\nE.g.:\n{noformat}\npdzwart@Mjolnir:~[14:33:14](0,0)$ ./setenv.sh \nBAR\npdzwart@Mjolnir:~[14:33:16](0,0)$ FOO=gnarf ./setenv.sh \ngnarf\npdzwart@Mjolnir:~[14:33:21](0,0)$ cat setenv.sh \nFOO=${FOO:-BAR}\n\necho $FOO\npdzwart@Mjolnir:~[14:33:26](0,0)$\n{noformat}\n\nIn the context of {{setenv.sh}}, as an example; the {{JVM_MINIMUM_MEMORY}} environment variable assignment can be changed from:\n{noformat}\nJVM_MINIMUM_MEMORY=\"384m\"\n{noformat}\nTo:\n{noformat}\nJVM_MINIMUM_MEMORY =${JVM_MINIMUM_MEMORY:-\"384m\"}\n{noformat}\n\nWhich would allow the setting of this value from the shell environment with exported variables.\n\nStrongly suggest using this mechanism of parameter expansion with the following list of variables:\n* {{JVM_MINIMUM_MEMORY}}\n* {{JVM_MAXIMUM_MEMORY}}\n* {{JVM_EXTRA_ARGS}}",

One of the features we're really missing is a background-color for columns - depending on the status the ticket actually has.\n\nOur current workaround is the script from http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/134394\n\nI attached a screenshot how it looks like when I view all my tickets, ordered by status ASC, updated DESC.\n\nYou can see at first sight that it's much clearer what kind of tickets are open, what status they have and how many there actually are for each status. This color also affects the ticket detail page, where the status column is still colored.\n\nIt's fine for me with the script, but it is not for our customers. They don't know about the script, they don't know how to install a script, they don't want a script and - of course and most important - they shoudn't need a script.\n\nMaybe it's possible for you to implement the userscript (see link above) as a standard tool. That would be really great.\n\nAs this setting could be optional, none of the current JIRA users would have any disadvantage.\n\nThank you!\n\nRegards,\nMartin",

Instead of not being able to view the issue data at all. Is it possible to still render the valid aspects of the issue/project data and then just show a warning error that alerts the user to the database corruption? And then prevent changes that may make the invalid data cause additional problems. Also, the full stack trace can still be hidden in a expansible panel as is already obtainable in JIRA.\n\nImplementing this perhaps may introduce more resource implications, levels of complexity and perhaps other unpredictable behaviour in the programming logic, and I mentioned this to our customer who raised it. However, I'd leave it to developers to determine what level of improvement can be made to handling issue rendering under these special circumstances.\n",

Let us call them Personal WIP rules:\n\nfilter, operator, count\n\nPWIP rule1: CoS = \"expedite\", <=, 1\n\nPWIP rule2: CoS in (\"fixed delivery date\", \"standard\", \"intangible\"), <=, 2\n\nThese rules should be assigned to user roles.\n\nSuppose some user (the originator) attempts to assign a candidate issue to another user or self (the target). The system will count the current tickets assigned based on the filter rules for the target user, will apply the filter rules for the candidate issue and if a filter condition is matched then the count will increase for that filter. The rules will trigger and only if the user can accept the ticket the operation will be successful.\n\nIn fact the target user should not even be presented as a candidate to resolve the ticket. At a minimum, as stated above, the validation of the submission should fail. The result should be an error like \"Could not perform this action. Personal WIP limit reached\"\n\nThanks!\n\n- Nestor",
