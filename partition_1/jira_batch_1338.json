Issue Summary\r\n\r\nWhile the Atlassian Cloud app within Okta does now provide a Statuspage chiclet, you are not provided with an example URL from Atlassian on what to submit while setting up the app in Okta. \r\n\r\nAtlassian provides examples for services like Jira (https://[your-subdomain].atlassian.net) and Confluence (https://[your-subdomain].atlassian.net/wiki) but nothing is provided to customers looking to configure it for Statuspage. Maybe the issue is that the management URL is not on an Atlassian domain? \r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n# setup Atlassian cloud Okta app \r\n# provide a URL for the Statuspage chiclet to point to manage.statuspage.io in order to be taken to the management console \r\n# get dumped at https://manage.statuspage.io/login\r\n# type in email address again (defeating purpose of SSO id-init flow) \r\n# get into management portal \r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nThe Statuspage chiclet in okta authenticate, and direct, you to the Statuspage management portal (manage.statuspage.io) \r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nThe IdP flow directs you to https://manage.statuspage.io/login where you are forced to enter your email address, instead of being sent into the management portal. \r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nCustomers can provide the below URL (replacing the cloud site info section from the example) when setting up the chiclet. This will allow for expected behavior when doing an IdP init session - \r\n\r\nmanage.statuspage.io/cloud/atlassian-cloud-site-id\r\n\r\nWhile this does solve the issue, it is not convenient to find a given Atlassian site URL, and is not provided in the existing Atlassian Cloud Okta app setup documentation: https://saml-doc.okta.com/SAML_Docs/How-to-Configure-SAML-2.0-for-Atlassian-Cloud.html",

As this issue does not stop the G Suite integration but the account update that is being pushed, it is more appropriated to track this as an enhancement request to improve the UI messages so the admins know the accounts involved in the difficulty. The development team is already aware of this difficulty. We will set this ticket to _Long Term Backlog_.\r\n\r\nFor future cases, please track the progress around the enhancement request at the ticket below:\r\n- [Improve the error handling with Org-level G Suite integration|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/ACCESS-962]\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\nh3. Issue Summary\r\nThe new org-level G Suite/G Sync integration fails when trying to update a synced account to an email address that is already taken. In the UI the admins only see:\r\n!image.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nThe image does not explain the issue and gives no workaround for the admins. There is a [feature request|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/ACCESS-962] to improve that error message.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Setup the integration and sync a user (i.e. email@domain.com)\r\n# Create a new Atlassian Account with a different email address (i.e. new.email@domain.com) but do not sync it\r\n# At G Suit admin page, change the synced account from email _email@domain.com_ to _new.email@domain.com_\r\n\r\nIn this scenario we have the following accounts:\r\n||account||email||synced from Google?||\r\n|A|email@domain.com|(/)|\r\n|B|new.email@domain.com|(x)|\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nThe integration should change the account _B_ email to _new.email+conflict@domain.com_ or at least let the admin opt for that change before proceeding. Then update account _A_ to _new.email@domain.com_ as G Suite should be the source of truth for the accounts. \r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nNothing happens and the sync seems to fail. \r\n\r\nIn the backend the support team can see the following errors in the logs:\r\nError\r\n{code}\r\nstack_trace: io.atlassian.micros.gsyncv2.clients.IedaException: Call to IEDA failed due to: emailalreadyexists\r\n{code}\r\nMessage\r\n{code}\r\nCould not update user for directory <directoryId> and userId <userId> (status: 409, reason: {\"schemas\":[\"urn:ietf:params:scim:api:messages:2.0:Error\"],\"status\":\"409\",\"scimType\":\"uniqueness\",\"detail\":\"Resource [USER]: with email[<targetEmail>] already exists.\"})\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n# Open a support ticket\r\n# If the admins know about changes being pushed to our end, they can undo them at Google (i.e. revert _new.email@domain.com_ to _email@domain.com_) and then:\r\n## Change the account with the target email to something different i.e. _new.email@domain.com_ to _invalida@domain.com_ (change just the email prefix so the account will still be managed by your Org)\r\n## Then try to push the changes from Google (i.e. change _email@domain.com_ to _new.email@domain.com)\r\n\r\n",
