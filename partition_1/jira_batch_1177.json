I was thinking of something like _git log PROJECT-1234-the-branch --not <all the other branches>_\n\nThanks!\n",

Instead of an arbitrary field that may or may not even be used, the reporter on the issue navigates to the \"Label\" field and types what they need. Instead of perusing the page for their 2-10 fields, they simply enter the 2-10 keywords into the \"Label\" field.\n\nIn the vein of ease of use, having labels that can be identical (only differentiating in capitalization) not appear within the same search/filter only complicates things. On top of this, user's often _think_ that they're adding the correct label, when in fact they are not inputting the label that will cause their issue to appear on the desired filter/board. This false sense of security then comes back to bite them later, and the user is (rightfully) very turned off from using the application for anything meaningful from that point forward. I've experienced that exact scenario (first hand, second, and third) at multiple companies leveraging JIRA.",

Case 1 - Arrays (copied)\nMost of the standard custom fields that JIRA ships have meta data that says they are arrays with string values. That normally means you need to provide a JSON array of option ids. Cascade select is a odd case even though it reports the same schema but needs to be handled differently. It has historically been an odd case (wink).  \n\nThe trouble is for an arbitrary custom field that reports meta data as \"array\" and with items of \"string\" there doesn't seem to be a way to know the format or content of the data that is expected to set the value of the field. Am I missing something here? One would assume meta data would give you enough information to determine that, but it doesn't. Providing an array of values results in an error. How does one create a representation of data for an arbitrary custom field that represents itself as accepting array values but does not? Also, what indication is there that it needs option ids instead of regular strings? This seems like an omission from the metadata available.\n\nFor instance, the agile custom fields look like arrays, but don't accept array values:\n\nschema\": {\n\"type\": \"array\",\n\"items\": \"string\",\n\"custom\": \"com.pyxis.greenhopper.jira:gh-epic-link\",\n\"customId\": 11261\n}, \n\ncustomfield_11261\": \"ZAGILE-1\",\n\nh1. Case 2 - 3rd party custom fields\nHere is a Tempo field with the following metadata:\n{noformat}\n\"customfield_10600\":{\"required\":true,\"schema\":{\"type\":\"account\",\"custom\":\"com.tempoplugin.tempo-accounts:accounts.customfield\",\"customId\":10600},\"name\":\"Account\",\"hasDefaultValue\":false,\"operations\":[\"set\"]},\n{noformat}\n\nThis happens to be a numeric field. However, there is no indication of that in the metadata. \nWorse, an update using a string value gives \"not numeric\" error even though the string value is actually a numeric value. There doesn't appear to be a generic way to determine that a numeric is required. The only obvious way is magically knowing about this specific custom field requires a numeric entry. ",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-45361].\n  {panel}\n\nThere are two issues reported related to this, JRA-16595 & JRA-39112, but I thought I'd put a general suggestion that encompasses the whole problem.\n\nh3. Problem\nAs long as the user has create issue permission in a project, they can move an issue to it and more importantly, to ANY workflow state in the target workflow. This creates an issue in a use case such as:\n\n-If you are using in a project (or specific issue type) a workflow that has specific restrictions as it is being used in a strict approval process. The ability to use the move issue operation to \"bypass\" any workflow conditions and validators renders the approval workflow useless. (not saying that someone would necessarily maliciously seek to do so)\n\n-Similarly, it could be moving to a different issue type within the same project that is using a different workflow as well. \n\nLooking at the consequences mentioned in the other linked issues, simply put, the \"move issue\" operation is one could say \"too powerful\" as it doesn't respect workflow conditions and permissions in the target project.\n\nh3. Solution\n\nRemoving create issue permissions to a project or move issue permissions is in a lot of cases not really an option and therefore not a solution.\n\nWhat would be a solution apart from all conditions and permissions being taken account by the code, would be the ability to disable moving TO a project/issue type either via permission or otherwise so that at least any really problematic cases can be avoided.\n\nh3. Workarounds?\n\nAt least for my case I am looking at whether it is impossible to employ a hack to remove certain projects or issue types from the ui dialogue similar to https://confluence.atlassian.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=301663662.

Actual Result\n\nIt will take a very long time to load the issue, and fail the page load. Multiple reload will still hit into the same issue. Potential piling up the memory if it keeps loaded.\n\nh3.

This is causing cosmetic issues when hovering the mouse over the logo:\n - Using a transparent logo, having the logo text and the Header Highlight Background Color in the same color, the logo text disappears.\n - Using a non-transparent logo, the Header Highlight Background Color is applied around the logo (showing a frame) which looks deforming.\n\nh4. Notes\n\nIt would be nice if the Header Highlight Background Color wouldn't be applied on the logo, as the logo is something static that should not be manipulated or highlighted by the UI.\n\nh4. Workaround\n\nApply the following script to the announcement banner. This script prevents the section in which the logo resides from having the Header Highlight Background Color being applied:\n{code}\n<script>\njQuery(document).ready(function() {\njQuery(\"h1#logo a img,h1#logo a,h1#logo\").css(\"background\", \"white\"); \n});\n</script>\n{code}\n\nNote: Also {noformat}[.css](\"background\", \"#F6F6F6\"){noformat} can be used to apply an HTML color code as the background color when hovering the mouse over the logo.",

Suggested Solution\n\nWhen entering new field values for the bulk operation, provide an optional text input where a JQL expression can be entered.  Issues that match this JQL filter will receive the new field value, otherwise the existing field value will not be modified.\n \nh3.

Summary\n\nIf you set a group to have a project permission, Permission Helper says that the user do not have the project permission, but the user do have the permission.\n\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\n\n# Create a new user \n# Create a new group \n# Create a new project\n# Create a new issue\n# Make sure the user belongs only to the new group and jira-users.\n# Add the group to have the project permission \"Browse Project\".\n# Open the Project Roles and remove the group jira-users of the Project Role users.\n#* This is to make sure that the user is only given permission through groups not project roles.\n# Open the permission helper and inform the user and issue that you just created.\n#  Select \"Browse Projects\" and Submit\n\nh3. Expected Results\n\nThe permission helper correctly identifies the user is in that group and that they belong to that project permission, and they have permissions.\n\nh3. Actual Results\n\nPermission helper says \"The user do not have 'Browse Project' permission\".\n\nh3. Workaround\n\nSet the permission to project roles instead of groups or user. We highly recommend project roles are used over groups for permissions as it means one permission scheme can be applied to multiple projects.",
