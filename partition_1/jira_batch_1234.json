Customer Feedback:\n{quote}\nlately a question occured about the behaviour of the average age chart gadget. A colleague uses this chart to monitor the age of issues in some projects that we use for support. This week he looked at the chart and all the bars in the average age chart had risen from about 10 to 14 days to more then 100 days.\nAfter a short investigation I found that he had previously reopened a 2-year old issue in order to change the resolution. So the issue also got a new resolution date. The new resolution date of that issue caused the average age gadget to \"think\" the issue has been unresolved before and therefore included the issue in the calculation of the average age for the past days, weeks and months. I think this behaviour is not right and distorts the data shown in the average age chart.\nThe issue was already resolved for a long time. Reopening it and setting a new resolution made it appear that it was unresolved all the time, although it was closed, just with another resolution. For us it would be better if the average chart would only take the first resolution date into account.\nHow could we handle issues that need to be reopened without distorting the average age chart? Is it possible to change the resolution without changing the resolution date?\n{quote}\n\nh3. Support Feedback\nPerhaps there could be some additional settings to be implemented to set issues that have been more than 30 days should not count into the Average Age Chart.\n",

Since the collector already tracks who is logged in and user profiles contain email addresses most of the data needed is already in the system.  I realize this would not work for non-account holders.  The hard part would be creating a place in the collector UI where you could use HTML to customize your reply email for each collector.\n\nThis is auto-reply feature has also been requested for JIRA in the following tickets.

That's a lot :).  As far as I can tell that's simply done to invalidate cache entries in the CachingFieldConfigContextPersister.  This is where I ran out of time to investigate further but given the customer data and information above should be enough for someone on bugfix to reproduce.  There's probably more efficient ways we could be clearing cache entries (using map.remove(key) rather than iterating with a predicate perhaps).",

When typing the entire name and changing focus though, an error appears. There are two distinct cases:\n\n1. Displaying an Issue on the screen makes Component field editable (pen icon allows editing). When user begins to type, auto-complete is active, the \"option\" appears clearly. Entire option is edited; enter or ok issues the error (see ManualEditComponent.jpg image).\n\n2. Creating a new Issue and editing Component field is somewhat similar, but only if focus is switched from the Component field after entirely typing to another field with mouse selection; then error appears; if focus to another field is done by pressing TAB, everything seems to work fine (see CreateIssueComponent.jpg image).\n\n\nThanks for resolving this,\nRoxana",

However, currently JIRA will required a minimum screen resolution of *1024 x 768* in order to fully utilize JIRA. \n\nh3. Customer Personal Feedback\n{quote}\nOne thing to pass on to Atlassian is that the \u201cWhat\u2019s new\u201d pop-up is not great for people using a low screen resolution. The trouble is the pop up can\u2019t be scrolled and so the only option is to zoom out (meaning I can no longer read the information contained in the pop-up). Here is how it appears on my screen:\n!Accessibility 01.png|thumbnail!\nThis is spread over two 800x600 resolution screens.\n\nSecondly trying the menus I get:\n!Accessibility 02.png|thumbnail!\n\nIt seems that it is being rendered ridiculously short with respect to the available screen height. Atlassian probably need to look at the routine used to assess this. Please do praise them for the ability to now use the scroll wheel on this menu again it is usable! Just tricky to get context form as many menu items as possible (even if you have to scroll for the final few).\n\nI\u2019ve not got much time at the moment for an extensive test but hope that these initial observations will be useful. I\u2019d be grateful if you could let me know what happens about these things as it will make Jira more difficult to use.\n{quote}",

Current behaviour\n\nWhen the HTTP 403 error is thrown via REST API, there is no way to distinguish when a \"usual\" failed login attempt has occurred. In both cases (wrong credentials or maximum login attempt) JIRA retrieves HTTP 403 error.\n\nh3. Expected behaviour\n\nWe want a different error message when the HTTP 403 error is thrown (either for wrong credentials or maximum attempts).",
