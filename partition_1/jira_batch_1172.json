The entire operation take just a few milliseconds, however, since the transition options are displayed based on the workflow step ID and not based on the status ID, if we run a REST API call to get the available transition statuses, we might see a discrepancy. If we run the REST call again, the correct information is displayed. \n\nPlease note this issue is very hard to replicate since the entire operation takes just a few milliseconds, however, if you're running an automated script to get the available status, there might be a discrepancy and cause problems to the backend systems which relies on that information.\n\nAn example can be seen in the screenshots below.\n\n !image1.png|thumbnail!  !current_workflow.png|thumbnail! \n\nIt would be great to change the way JIRA updates the database to have this information updated simultaneously.",

At the top, an user story should tell me the phase wise status.\n2. Story will have sub-tasks & also corresponds to a new issue type called Verification Task.\n3. Based on the statuses of sub-task the story status should reflect.\n4. At one point (after 3-4 sub tasks gets to closure) upon a transition at story level, it should create another issue type called Verification Task.\n5. At one point even that Verif Task reaches a state upon its status the story status should get changed and at this point need another issue type to be triggered.\n6. Finally based on the 2-3 step process this new issue type gets done and that's when the story finally should reach Done/closed state.\nPlease suggest the best way to configure this workflow. \nThanks for your time!\nRaghav",

Problem Definition\nAs an administrator I would like JIRA Announcement banner code to be isolated from the JIRA and the plugins code. This is to prevent any code in Announcement banner to cause any outages on the instance.\n\nAt the moment, if an incorrect code is entered in the announcement banner then it can cause major outages on the JIRA instance leading to an instance that is unusable.\n\nSample HTML code that can cause major problems : \n{noformat}<div style=\"width:float;height:float;border:3px solid green;\"<br />\n<b><center>Jira system now in the new version 6.4.12. To find out more about the new features please click this link: <a href=\"http://xxxxx.com/introdocsinternal/xxxx.pdf\">Jira Upgrade</a></b></center>\n{noformat}\n\n(i) Note that in the above banner code there is a missing HTML end parameter </div> . This is what caused the problems in Structure and the \"hide menu\" feature in Jira Agile.\n\nh3. Suggested Solution\nMake sure that the code in the announcement banner is not easily able to leave the instance unusable.",

Currently it does happen that a user fills in a bug/adds a comment to an exisiting one with long description, attachments etc and then misclicks by hitting \"Cancel\" instead \"Create\" and all's removed at once. So either moving the \"Create\" and \"Cancel\" further apart from each other, a \"confirm action\" check for \"Cancel\" button or recovery option would be nice here.",

This leads to different kinds of inefficiencies, because people don't know there are links. For example an issue is cloned and moved to another project, who will solve it, but someone else looks at the orginal issue and sees no links and decides to create another child issue in another project.\n\nAlso, from a data perspective, this behaviour is very wrong. The relationship between issues does not belong to either issue. A link belongs to both sides, So when looking at an object which the user has permissions to look at, the user can see all data in that object, outgoing links is part of that. Jira should always show outgoing links, but when you click on a link, that is the moment access control to that issue should be checked, NOT when showing links as information in an issue.",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-47044].\n  {panel}\n\nh3. Problem Definition\n\nWhen carrying out a manual full reindex in JIRA we get this kind of logging in the {{atlassian-jira.log}} file:\n{noformat}\n2015-11-20 13:19:25,560 IssueIndexer:thread-3 INFO username 760x93x1 6x3ux8 10.155.44.250 /secure/admin/IndexReIndex.jspa [action.admin.index.IndexAdminImpl] Re-indexing is 22% complete. Current index: Issue\n{noformat}\n\nHowever when doing a JIRA upgrade that requires a full reindex, for example this step:\n{noformat}\n2015-11-19 19:04:08,176 localhost-startStop-1 INFO [jira.upgrade.util.BuildNumberDao] Setting current build number to 6318\n2015-11-19 19:04:08,192 localhost-startStop-1 INFO [atlassian.jira.upgrade.UpgradeManagerImpl] Performing Upgrade Task: Signalling all data in JIRA should be reindexed.

Necessary so stop words are not ignored in exact phrase searches.' succeeded\n{noformat}\n\nh3. Suggested Solution\n\nWe do not get any feedback in the log as to the progress of the indexing process, there should be some reindex progress logging so that when we carry out upgrades on large instances, we can understand the progress and estimate how long it will take to complete.\n\nh3. Workaround \nWe can increase the indexing logging in the log4j.properties like this:\n{code}\nlog4j.logger.com.atlassian.jira.issue.index = DEBUG, indexlog\nlog4j.additivity.com.atlassian.jira.issue.index = false\n{code}\n\nWhich then does provide a full log of each item being indexed, but it still doesn't give any information about the progress of the full index, only which individual tickets have been indexed.\n\n{noformat}\n2015-11-20 12:20:32,546 JiraTaskExectionThread-1 DEBUG anonymous     [jira.issue.index.DefaultIssueDocumentFactory] Indexing issue: ABC-1000\n2015-11-20 12:20:32,608 JiraTaskExectionThread-1 DEBUG anonymous     [jira.issue.index.DefaultIssueDocumentFactory] Indexing issue: ABC-1001\n2015-11-20 12:20:32,749 JiraTaskExectionThread-1 DEBUG anonymous     [jira.issue.index.DefaultIssueDocumentFactory] Indexing issue: ABC-1002\n2015-11-20 12:20:32,842 JiraTaskExectionThread-1 DEBUG anonymous     [jira.issue.index.DefaultIssueDocumentFactory] Indexing issue: ABC-1003\n2015-11-20 12:20:32,951 JiraTaskExectionThread-1 DEBUG anonymous     [jira.issue.index.DefaultIssueDocumentFactory] Indexing issue: ABC-1004\n2015-11-20 12:20:33,014 JiraTaskExectionThread-1 DEBUG anonymous     [jira.issue.index.DefaultIssueDocumentFactory] Indexing issue: ABC-1005\n{noformat}\n\n\n\n\n",
