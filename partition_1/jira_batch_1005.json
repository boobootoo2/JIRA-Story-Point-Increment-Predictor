During attaching a file, the file name was listed as an attachment in manage attachments however the file was never uploaded to the server.  \n\nWhile this was directly caused by our own doings, it doesn't seem to make sense that the file appeared attached, yet the process was not completed when the comment was being added.

I have searched the web but not found any conclusive answers, just clues.  It seems that by either appending \"JCONNECT_VERSION=6\" to the JDBC URL or specifying some additional properties (as suggested on http://tinyurl.com/3gp8g) it is possible to get it to work; i.e. then it is possible to edit all fields of an issue.  But I still get all these error messages about the DataSource which isn't found at startup of Tomcat.\n\nSo for now I can work again.  But I suspect that anybody using JIRA on Tomcat with Sybase ASE 12.5 will run into the same problems; although I have no idea if this is limited to Tomcat.  So it's still something that should be investigated.  Maybe this post provides some clues: http://tinyurl.com/26uxu.\n\n\n\n\nWould be good to add a note to the Sybase doco\n  http://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/docs/latest/standalone-dbconfig.html#sybase\nSo other users can try this.",

However when we allow unassigned issues, \"Unassigned\" is set as the assignee by default, which results in a large number of issues that nobody is focusing on. It would be nice to have the three following global settings for unassigned issues:\n\nUnassigned issues:\na) Allow - with \"unassigned\" set as the default assignee\nb) Allow - but with a nominated assignee set by default\t\nc) Don't allow - all issues will be assigned to a nominated default assignee\n\nThis way option b) allows unassigned issues, but only if that is what the user explicitly chooses.\n\nThe default assignee would probably be the project lead, although it may or may not be beneficial to be able to set this default assignee independently of being the project lead. I suppose that hinges on whether there is there any significance to \"Project Lead\" status other that being a default assignee.",

Trying to force users to use the system properly through handbooks and other rules not enforced by the system becomes a burden to engineers (engineers unhappy).\n\nIntegrating a couple of restrictions and rules in the system, nothing very complex would make things much better.\n\nFor example, I've found a couple of already logged requests (JRA-1993, JRA-1744, JRA-868...) that seem quite reasonable to me, and would make things easier for users\n\n- Force people to log work when resolving issues - at least present them with the dialog\n- When resolving an issue, reset the \"time left\" field to 0\n\nI also logged :\n\n- JRA-3009 : Track time on tasks&subtasks\n- JRA-3010 : Restriction on who/when work can be logged\n\nSolving all these issues would make time tracking features in JIRA much more attractive, since they would be less of a burden for the developer (less room for mistakes), and much more reliable for managers.\n\nMy $.02",

As an example I currently have a Fitting Software Support project that the field people use to raise and comment on issues that crop up in the field. \n\nIf an issue occurs in the field they compose and email to xxx@domain.com and I have a service that monitors that email account and either creates a new issue in a project or adds a comment to an existing issue. It actually works quite well for if we add a comment to an issue, asking for more information say, JIRA automatically notifies the reporter and all they need to do is respond to that email. We're doing this because many of our field people are on the road all the time and mainly have access to email only. \n\nNow I've had several requests for the same setup for other projects. The problem is that the notification email sent by Jira is not configurable. I can setup a service that will monitor yyy@domain.com but all the notifications will come from fittingsoftwaresupport@cochlear.com and therefore responding to that email would create a new issue in the Fitting Software Support project rather than create a comment in the Implant Support Project.
