While this feature is something we want to add to JIRA, it is not on the list of priorities for the next 12 months.\n\nIn the meantime, please check out these plugins:\n* [Configuration Manager from Botron Software|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.botronsoft.jira.configurationmanager] \n* [Project Configurator from Awnaba Software|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.awnaba.projectconfigurator.projectconfigurator]\n\non our Atlassian marketplace. \n\nBoth of these plugins are available for the downloaded instances of JIRA and solve the use cases outlined in this requirement.\n\nWhile we will not be addressing this feature in the next 12 months, we plan to resolve several other top voted feature requests in the next 12 months, including JRA-3156, JRA-3821, JRA-1431. And we have recently resolved JRA-32199, JRA-32200, JRA-2703 and JRA-7659 as well as provided the first drop of functionality related to JRA-3157.\n\nThanks for your patience and we hope you appreciate our open approach to feature requests.\n\nCheers,\nBartek\nJIRA Product Management\nbartek (at) atlassian (dot) com\n{panel}\n*Original request description*\n\nCurrently JIRA crashes when importing workflows if referenced screens and statuses do not exist.\n\nJira should not need  the statuses or screens to have the same ids when importing workflows from one instance to another.\n\nIt makes it very difficult to import new workflows from a test/development instance to production. This use case is [explicitly documented |http://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/docs/v3.6.1/workflow.html#copying_workflows].\n\nPerhaps upon import, JIRA should ask whether to create new statuses, by default pre-filled with the workflow step name? For screens perhaps it could do something similar, or maybe remove the screens.\n\nEither way JIRA should not crash on importing workflows at all.",

If the \"Any\" issue type is selected, only custom fields that are available in the Global context are searchable. To be able to search custom fields that are only available for specifik issue types, one of those types must be specified in a new search.\n\nI have a setup where the Participants field (from the JIRA Toolkit Plugin) is only defined for the Bug, Improvement, New Feature and Usability (custom) Issue types. Most of the people that search the issue database are not aware of this restriction, as they generally only work with these issue types. When they search, for participants, they want to find _all_ issue with this particular participant, and therefor do not specify a specific Issue type to search. The problem is that because they do not specify one of the issue types for which the field is enabled, thay can not search the field at all.\n\nWhat I miss is an option to allow all custom field searches to be shown when creating a new filter. I understand the need to limit the view if many custom fields have been defined. But when the Any issue type is selected in a new filter, a second Custom Fields section should be available that provides access to fields that only are available in for specific issue types.\n\nI know this could probably be created as a plugin, but my company does not have the Java expertice available to do this. I also believe this would be a great addition to either JIRA itself or to the Toolkit Plugin that most people seem to have installes anyway.",

I suppose an 'issue created' event is fired, so just people associated with the new sub-task receive notification. Watchers of the parent issue get no notification.\n\nIs there an easy workaround we could use to set up notifications like this?\n\nThanks,\nKim",

My improvement suggestion is to change the JIRA hotkeys to NOT duplicate those implemented by common browsers. \n\nAlthough IE does not cause pages to switch until you activate the link (by hitting enter or the space bar), Firefox activates the link immediately and thus leaves the user with no recourse to reclaim any comments they entered.\n\nI've lost work on several occasions and am beginning to work around by typing in notepad first, but I am confident designers of JIRA would agree that this shouldn't be necessary especially when Alt+e then a is a very common shortcut for the Edit-Select All implementation in software.\n\nI understand that not all users may experience the Alt+e problem since not all users have rights to edit JIRA issues. But the Alt-F feature (use the File menu) would also be overridden to the Find link in JIRA. ( just validated this and gladly cut my content to the clipboard before trying since all was lost hitting alt+F)\n\nAnother JIRA requested for a feature which allows the user to decide whether they want to be diverted from the edit mode they were in might be one approach, though could also be irritating as the \"do you really want to delete the file\" found in windows explorer but i digress.",

Currently you cannot do this by copying links because they do not include all the parameters used to construct the view.\n\nAlso, as a side effect, this would mean you could fix the Print icon so it did the same and you could bookmark or send links to printable content.\n\nThis issue is a superset of JRA-7817",

Typically we have different teams owning and testing Jiras from those who are fixing them.  What would be nice would be to easily distinguish between open Jiras and closed Jiras.  It's easy to see the difference between jiras that have been resolved and those that haven't but you only have a small icon on the right to see which ones are open.  It's hard to see at a glance how many jiras have yet to be tested which paints a better picture of the road map particualarly if many issues have been resolved but none have been tested yet.",

If one does not exist yet, it should be created (perhaps the system should get a username and description  -- aka full name in that case)\n3) The issue would have the backup and log attached just as the email does.  The local environment might be good as an attachment as well -- it takes up a lot of room on the screen\n4) On the atlassian end, the email should be imported into an issue at support.atlassian.com\n\nWhy keep it in both places, you ask?  Because until there's a portlet for watching issues on someone else's JIRA, most of us will only pay attention to what's in our own JIRA and it doesn't make sense for Atlassian to deal with support requests on everyone else's JIRAs.\n\n\nNote that I've already implemented a workaround that works pretty well for me (see JRA-9547) and you'd have to deal with potential notification loops between the two JIRAs (see JRA-9617).",

Let's call it a \"mass\" operation instead of \"bulk\".\n\nConsider this scenario: you are doing triage on a set of open bugs - reprioritizing, potentially reassigning, setting due dates and versions, perhaps resolving as \"postponed\". This triage could be daily, or it could be the result of a change in schedule or feature set that makes you need to revisit a bunch of them. Now, as a producer or dev lead or whatever, you're very familiar with most of these bugs, so a glance at the Summary field in the Issue Navigator is usually enough to let you know what's going on.\n\nI don't know about everyone else who uses Jira, but for my team this is a really common scenario. Anyway, right now you have two options to do your mass update:\n\n  1. Go through every bug one at a time and do the combination of edits, and workflow transitions required.\n  2. Subdivide bulk edits based on type - so do all setting-to-pri-1 in one pass, setting-to-pri-2 in another pass, reassigning-to-Bob in another pass...\n\nBoth of these are really tedious and it makes it really hard to go through a lot of bugs and update them very quickly, to the point that we don't do it nearly as often as we should. I've got a proposal for this.\n\n-----\n\nProposal:\n\nHave a new \"mass edit\" feature that is similar to Step 1 of Bulk Operation: an Issue Navigator style grid, except instead of each field being static, have it be editable. If it's a priority field, say, it would become a drop-down of all priorities, with the current priority for that bug selected, rather than static text. If it's the Assignee field, it would become a drop-down of all available people to assign to (with the current assignee selected), and so on. There should also be a previous step to Mass Edit that lets you choose which fields appear in this grid, so what's visible is only what you want to change.\n\nIn addition, have a column at the end (enabled via that \"previous step\" I just mentioned) that lets you select possible workflow transitions, again via a drop-down (defaulting to \"leave as-is\") that shows all possible transitions for each bug - the same list as would appear in the \"Operations\" section on the left bar if you were to be viewing that individual bug.\n\nThe \"next\" step would confirm the changes that are proposed, and then a \"next\" after that to commit them. First it would do the edit updates, then it would do the workflow transitions. Perhaps it would give you a button to continue working with the bugs that had workflow transitions, in case you wanted to send them through further transitions (i.e. go back to step 1).\n\nMaybe a better name for this feature would be Grid Mass Edit or something. Some other bugbases have this feature (such as Microsoft's RAID) and it's extremely useful for working quickly through a set of bugs.",

Thanks for all this feedback. Given the level of interest we\u2019ve conducted some research to reassess the link click behaviour across Jira Cloud and our other products like Confluence Cloud that use our new editing experience.\r\n\r\n+*Decision:*+\r\n\r\nBased off our research,\u00a0*we will keep the existing default behaviour.*\r\n\r\nThis existing default behaviour is:\r\n * All links in the editor (i.e. the mode where you can see a toolbar and insert content) will open in a new tab by default.\r\n\r\n * All links in the renderer (i.e. the published/saved view of an issue description, comment, etc) will open in the same tab by default.\r\n\r\n+*Reasoning:*+\r\n\r\nWe assessed multiple approaches and landed on keeping the existing behaviour for the following reasons.\r\n\r\nFor users in the editor:\r\n * We don\u2019t want a user to be moved away from the current work they\u2019re doing so open the link in a new tab by default. This is common behaviour.\r\n\r\nFor users in the renderer:\r\n * Common link-click behaviour on the web is to open in the same tab.\r\n\r\n * If we open links in a new tab by default, it\u2019s impossible for a user to open the link in the same tab. For opening in same tab by default, however, there are common ways to open in a new tab, like cmd + click (Mac), ctrl + click (Windows & Linux), right click then select open link in new tab, or pressing the middle button on a mouse.\r\n\r\n * From an accessibility standpoint it is better to stick with the default browser behaviour and open links in the same tab. The main arguments for this are:\r\n ** Assistive technology users can become disoriented when a link opens a new tab or window. They cannot use the back button to return to their previous location. We want to minimize this as much as possible. We have a toolbar button for opening links in the editor to give those with accessibility needs guidance that a new tab is opening.\r\n ** People with mobility or dexterity issues who rely on a keyboard may find it difficult or painful to perform additional navigation tasks.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nFor both the renderer and editor:\r\n * We decided against giving user-level control of how their links open when clicked. Aside from the accessibility and other reasons mentioned above, we believe this could cause confusion to consumers of the content. This is because every link could hypothetically open in a different way. It wouldn\u2019t afford the consumer of the content a predictable experience when clicking on a link.\r\n\r\n*Next steps:*\r\n\r\nI know this won\u2019t be the decision a number of you are looking for, and I\u2019m sorry for that. It\u2019s what we believe is the best decision, for the majority of our user base, with the current information we have at our disposal.\r\n\r\nBased off this decision, I\u2019ll be closing this ticket and marking it as \u201cClosed\u201d.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019re always looking to reassess and improve our experiences. If new information comes to light that suggests we should iterate this approach, we\u2019ll definitely reconsider.\r\n\r\nThanks again for your feedback.\r\n\r\nJonno | PM, Atlassian Cloud Editor\r\n{panel}\r\nSome users need to have external links in Description / Comments to open in new browser window.\r\n Looks like this should be per-user configurable.\r\n\r\n*Workaround*\r\n Use the middle-click on your mouse if you have a three-button mouse, ctrl-click on Windows/Unix, or cmd-click on Mac.",

It would be really helpful if the resolve issue screen had a Close and Next button as well as a Resolve and Next button so the user can close and issue and move to the next item in the filter.  Right now you have to click Close, then click Next to move on.\n\nIdeally, it would only appear if you have a filter active.",

We are happy to communicate that this issue is closed as fixed, and it will be available to you shortly.\n\nAs you might have noticed, we have not planned this improvement to be addressed explicitly. But we have discovered that we can close it quite easily as a consequence of architectural work delivered to close JRA-25721.\n\nCheers,\nBartek\nJIRA Product Management\nbartek (at) atlassian (dot) com\n{panel}\n*Original request description*\n\nCustom fields which are issue type or project specific are not shown in the issue navigator until the relevant project or issue type is selected (and refreshed via the blue box).

It means we lose some history, and also have to be sure to enter transitions in the order they occured in real life instead of letting Jira just sort them out based on the dates.\n\n",
