It also shows everything by minutes and not hours. This should be a setting or based on the default time interval. Lastly, it should display subtasks as such, possibly by tabbing them over or some kind of handling of issue keys when exported to Excel. My goal is to just pull a list of all issues for a project and hand it to someone explaining the time  and status of each issue. I'm a little shocked at how poorly the subtasks (no drap/drop, no roll up, no easy editing, no configuring columns in a list, etc.) and reporting are handled.

The query was something like this:\nSELECT ID, issueid, AUTHOR, grouplevel, rolelevel, worklogbody, CREATED, UPDATEAUTHOR, UPDATED, STARTDATE, timeworked FROM worklog WHERE (STARTDATE >= '2013-07-15 00:00:00.0' ) AND (STARTDATE < '2013-07-16 00:00:00.0' ) AND (AUTHOR = 'elspina' );\nWe created a index with this syntax and the time went down to less than one second.

That implies, that it wouldn't work when it comes after the <script> tags for instance within the HTML header.\n\nIn JIRA 6 source a script tag comes before this tag,\n{code}\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n    if (!window.performance) {\n        window.mpPerformance = {};\n        window.mpPerformance.responseStart = new Date().getTime();\n    }\n</script>\n<meta charset=\"utf-8\">\n\n<meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=Edge;chrome=1\"/>{code}\npossibly making it useless and unable to perform it's intended function, which is to force IE to render the page with the chrome frame engine if installed or in the highest mode available.\n\nPlease note that in JIRA 5, this tag is positioned properly, as recommended by Microsoft. It is already clear that JIRA will not support compatibility view, but this tag was added to override the default settings for compatibility view from IE 8+. \n\nIsn't there a possibility that we are having most of our rendering problems with compatibility view in IE with JIRA 6 instances and not so much in JIRA 5 because this tag isn't able to work as it should in JIRA 6, due to the wrong positioning?\n\nIf the X-UA Compatibility Meta tag can be made to work by looking into the position of this tag, users who for some organisational constraint cannot afford to disable compatibility view locally are more likely to be able to use JIRA 6 in IE, as they are using JIRA 5 without problems even though they are unable to locally disable compatibility view in IE.",

Currently clicking a link to say a google doc or a website in a ticket will load that asset in the same window. This is understandably annoying and a small time waste for our devs. As I can not see any reason that these links *shouldn't* open in a new window, I thought it would make sense to put in a request.",

Or, you have to just know the order of the items and use the arrow key to navigate to it and press ENTER and hope that you selected the correct one. \n\nI have several support tickets each month because users are not seeing the menu options and don't know how to perform functions. \n\nWe have many of our users on laptops with 13\" or 15\" screens and are in a resolution that is either 1024x768 or higher (the screenshots are using a 1440x900, Mac Air, 13\" which is the highest available resolution for an Air's system. \n\nSee attachment for current experience. \n\nOptions could include categorizing some options into a single menu option and have the user drill to that level.  Or, as we had to do in our own web design due to a similar issue, we limited the vertical length to only display 10 items at a time and displayed a vertical scroll bar if more than 10 were listed. \n\nI do not believe it appropriate to require users to change their docking options or web browser setup if they are already meeting a 1024x768 resolution and are in a supported browser.

Thanks in advance.\n\nI tried to follow this tutorial to set up the atlassian repository on my Ubuntu machine: https://developer.atlassian.com/display/DOCS/Install+the+Atlassian+SDK+on+a+Linux+or+Mac+System#InstalltheAtlassianSDKonaLinuxorMacSystem-Step1:DownloadandInstalltheSDK\n\nAfter I went to the step which says \"apt-get update\", the apt updated all the other repositories and got stuck with atlassian, with the message \"Waiting for headers\".\n\n5 or 10 minutes later (I lost the count), the process finished with these errors:\n------------------------------------\nIgn http://sdkrepo.atlassian.com stable Release.gpg                            \nIgn http://sdkrepo.atlassian.com stable Release\nIgn http://sdkrepo.atlassian.com stable/contrib TranslationIndex\nErr http://sdkrepo.atlassian.com stable/contrib amd64 Packages\n  Undetermined Error\nErr http://sdkrepo.atlassian.com stable/contrib i386 Packages\n  Undetermined Error\nIgn http://sdkrepo.atlassian.com stable/contrib Translation-en_US\nIgn http://sdkrepo.atlassian.com stable/contrib Translation-en\nFetched 72 B in 11min 22s (0 B/s)\nW: Failed to fetch http://sdkrepo.atlassian.com/debian/dists/stable/contrib/binary-amd64/Packages  Undetermined Error\n\nW: Failed to fetch http://sdkrepo.atlassian.com/debian/dists/stable/contrib/binary-i386/Packages  Undetermined Error\n\nE: Some index files failed to download. They have been ignored, or old ones used instead.\n------------------------------------\n\nCan this be fixed please?\nP.S. I downloaded deb file manually and will try to install it using dpkg, but it would be nice to fix this error in order for other people to be able to use atlassian sdk without issues.",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-33892].\n  {panel}\n\nDear Support,\n\nMaybe I am misunderstanding some settings in the JIRA admin section but here's what I'd like to be able to do:\n- about 50% of our JIRA users are standard \"users\" and do not have access to log into JIRA directly. They are jsut able to open tickets via email, receive email notifications and comment via email.\n\nAs we are also using JIRA as an IT Helpdesk / Ticketing system, we'd like our standard users to receive an email notification when their ticket is created in JIRA. I tried to add the Issue Created - Reporter notification in the notification scheme.\n\nProblem is, users don't receive their \"own\" notification as I presume the \"Do not notify my changes\" option in their profile is set by default.\n\nHow could we tackle this problem?\nI saw we could change this default setting but it will change it for ALL users, including \"active\" JIRA users that will also receive all those notifications as well as when they comment issues, or change other fields. This will lead to way too many emails.\n\nDo you know a way to set this email notification only for the issue creation to the reporter with the ability to notify the reporter of his own issue?\n\nThanks for your help and understanding,\nOlivier",

Go to an issue filter that only YOU can see, that displays the query in Advanced rather than basic mode.\n2. Change part of the query - so in my case I do this a lot to copy a standard of filters from one project to another ... so I would edit the project=\"X\" to a new value instead of X.\n3. DO NOT SAVE, but instead, click \"Details\" to change the filter from private to Everyone/shared. Accept this.\n4. A message saying the filter is SAVED comes up.\n5. Go to another filter and back to this one. You'll see the sharing was saved, but the query has not been saved.\n\nIdeas:\n* Because you actually need to navigate away from the page, it would be a feature to try and save this between pages,\n* Either that or change the success message from:\n{quote}\nChanges to <Filter Name> have been saved.\n{quote}\nto something more accurate (and true):\n{quote}\nChanges to the permissions of <Filter Name> have been saved.\n{quote}",
