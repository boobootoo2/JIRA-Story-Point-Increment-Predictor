However, descriptions tend to be rather long and multi-line, and that can cause the rows of the Filter Results to be quite tall.\n\nWhat I propose, is that a new field, perhaps named \"DescriptionPreview\" is made available, and what it does is it displays as much of the description as it can in it's cell in a Filter Results row, but limits itself to not increase the height of the row (relative to the height that any other cell in that row would cause) and of course it would be limited to the width of that cell.\n\nThis would allow, for example, to show some subset of the description within Filter Results while maintaining rows of single height (instead of getting rows of varying heights, some of which may be quite huge and undesirable).",

I have set one of these to the default. The problem is, the \"None\" option is still available to the users.\n\nJIRA is able to recognize which Security Levels are available to users, including the \"None\" option. The problem is that the \"None\" option will be selected automatically for a user if the default Security Level is not available for them. From what I've read in the documentation, the \"None\" security level means that everyone can access the issue.\n\nThe Screens component of JIRA is intelligent enough to not show the \"Security Level\" option if there is no Issue Security Scheme set for the project. Unfortunately, the Workflows component is not. If you set \"Security Level\" as required in a workflow, it will not be disabled for a project that doesn't have a Security Scheme set, thus requiring a copy with a very minor change.\n\nThis combination of \"features\" results in reduced re-usability of screens and workflows and potentially unsafe default options if \"None\" is allowed to be present with no way to remove it or at least default to a more restrictive option.\n\nOne proposed fix would be to allow a way to remove the \"None\" option on fields without requiring us to set it to \"Required\" in a workflow.\n\nAnother option would be to disregard Security Level as a required field in Workflow Validators when the current project does not have a Issue Security Scheme configured.\n\nAnother partial fix could also be to default to any option other than \"None\" if the default is not available to the user.",

Additionally, sometimes Issue Collectors are being used by authenticated users, as occasionally Issue Collectors are set up in the Announcement Banner for use within the JIRA environment.

There are advantages in making this more configurable, such that one could specify some other property e.g. a custom field that could be used for the link other than issue key if necessary.\n\nThe use case for this is usually with users migrating from other issue trackers with pre-existing subversion integration. We may be seeing more requests for this e.g.:\n* https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/282164/how-to-index-repository-referecing-ids-from-migrated-bugzilla-issues\n* https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/174771/how-to-receive-subversion-commits-of-an-imported-project-using-the-external-issue-id\n\nThis applies to different methods of integration including JIRA Subversion plugin, Fisheye plugin, DVCS connector etc.",

Besides that it provides a button from which the user can go to JIRA without the need of login. The consequence is after some time, maybe days, the user loses his JIRA section and needs to login again. At this time he does not know the login and password.\n\nWe think this could be solved changing the last screen of the setup for me installation in some way that enforces the important information about the login or/and obligating the user to login at first time he goes to JIRA after installed. \n\nThe screenshoots from the setup for me selection and the last installation screen are attached.\n\nThanks,\nDaniel P Santos",

Currently the best they can do to help is to comment on an issue. To better facilitate this JIRA should add a moderation queue.\n\nUsers would be given the full moderator toolkit and the ability to make any change they want. The only catch is their requests would be added to a moderation queue. So a user could decide to change the title, link an issue to a duplicate, or close an issue and these would show up as chronological requests in the moderation queue.\n\nA moderator would then be able to view pending requests and approve or deny them and visually see what's being change from the old value to the new value. This would allow many rapid changes to be made with the help of a large community. Moderators could also remove all the requests from a specific user from the queue.\n\nAnother useful feature would be to connect the number of approved moderations to specific users. This might help communities in picking out future moderators for community driven issue trackers and to reward users that are helping.\n\n",

This also creates a backling from the issue to the comment.  In a federated installation JIRA will behave this way only for issues that are local to the JIRA instance.  For issues that are on a remote instance automatic hyperlinking does not work.\n\nA rationale solution would be to add this as a native feature of the federated installation.
