Additional workaround: keeping a reference of the issue type's name in the issue view\r\n * Create a text custom field that will contain the name of the issue type:\r\n !Screen Shot 2021-04-22 at 15.06.24.png|thumbnail! !Screen Shot 2021-04-22 at 15.06.32.png|thumbnail!\r\n * Add it to the screens in your project;\r\n ** You can, for example use different screens for the issue edition and view operations;\r\n ** Then, add that field to the screen used by the view operation, but not the edit one;\r\n ** That will prevent the field from being edited by users. See [Manage screen schemes|https://support.atlassian.com/jira-cloud-administration/docs/manage-screen-schemes/#Associating-a-screen-with-an-issue-operation];\r\n * Export the issues you need to CSV (current fields) with the fields: Key, Summary, and Issue type:\r\n !Screen Shot 2021-04-22 at 15.07.46.png|thumbnail!\r\n * Edit the CSV file so only the columns Key, Summary (leave this one empty), and Issue type are present:\r\n !Screen Shot 2021-04-22 at 15.08.06.png|thumbnail! !Screen Shot 2021-04-22 at 15.08.17.png|thumbnail!\r\n * Import the CSV file (*https://<YOUR_SITE>.atlassian.net/secure/admin/ExternalImport1.jspa*), and map the fields so the column issue type will point to the new field:\r\n !Screen Shot 2021-04-22 at 15.09.40.png|thumbnail!\r\n ** That will populate the new field with the current name of the issue types on each respective issue:\r\n !Screen Shot 2021-04-22 at 15.10.23.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nFor future issues:\r\n * Create an Automation rule that will get the name of the issue type, and put it on the custom field you had created:\r\n !Screen Shot 2021-04-22 at 15.16.12.png|thumbnail! !Screen Shot 2021-04-22 at 15.16.18.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nOther hints:\r\n * If you want to highlight the issue type name in the issue view, you can use the button to pin the field to the top:\r\n !pin field1.png|thumbnail! !pin field2.png|thumbnail!\r\n * Also, for other actions such as when the issue type changes, you can create other automation rules to modify the custom field when that happens.",

Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nClarify how to fix the project permission where a self-service fix is available.\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nThe cause of the error can vary:\r\n\r\n*Case #1*: Open the project permission and check whether the project role \"*atlassian-addons-project-access*\" is granted all of the permissions. If not, here's how to fix the permission configs:\r\n * Log in as a Jira admin\r\n * go to [Settings] \u2192 *Issues \u2192 Permission schemes*\r\n * Find *Default Permission Scheme* and click *Permissions* to edit it\r\n * On the next page, click *Grant permission*, select *all* the permissions and grant them to \"*atlassian-addons-project-access*\"\r\n * Repeat the process to all the\u00a0**\u00a0permission schemes where you need to integrate the apps\r\n\r\nIf you only see the error on a specific project, it's more likely to fall into this case.\r\n\r\n!image-20201029-042032.png!\r\n\r\n*Case #2*: If the site in question experienced\u00a0any of the following operations recently, reach out to [support.atlassian.com|https://support.atlassian.com/contact/#/]\u00a0so that Atlassian Support can reinstall the Slack app:\r\n * renamed site\u00a0subdomain\r\n * migrated from Server to Cloud\r\n * had a backup restored\r\n\r\n*Others*:\r\n * Exceeding Slack's\u00a0[rate limit|https://api.slack.com/docs/rate-limits]\r\n * Connecting to the shared channel - refer to JRACLOUD-68798\u00a0for more details\r\n\r\nBesides, consider adding yourself as a watcher to be kept informed as to the state of this feature request moving forward.

      "description": "{panel:title=Atlassian Update - 26th March 2021|borderStyle=solid|borderColor=#ffab00|titleBGColor=#ffab00|bgColor=#ffffff}\r\nHi everyone,\r\n\r\nThanks for your feedback on this problem. We appreciate the time that you took to help us be better.\r\n\r\nThough not ideal, this behaviour in-product today is not a bug. Proposed behaviour of Screens here are a feature request and have to be prioritised against other requests.\r\n\r\nThe layout and fields that appear on screens must be defined in the Screen configuration. This also includes any required fields, to learn more about defining your screen (See [Defining a Screen|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Defining+a+Screen]).\r\n\r\nWe're using bugs to track any issues that prevent our features from being used as intended.\r\n\r\nBut we also understand and appreciate the expectations you have of our product so we have converted this to a feature suggestion instead.\r\n\r\nPlease watch this Jira issue for future updates as we continue to work on improving our product.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n Andrew Trieu\r\n Atlassian\r\n{panel}\r\nh4. Problem Definition\r\n\r\nAs a user, I modify my field configuration and turn a 'field' into a Required Field. I expect this required field to be visible on my Issue Create and View screens as I will not be able to proceed with issue creation without populating this field.\r\n\r\nCurrently required fields need to be defined in the Screen view otherwise they will not be visible. This means I will not be able to proceed with Issue Create unless I define that field in the Screen View.\r\n\r\n\r\nh4. Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nAutomatically may required fields visible in the Issue Create screen.\r\n\r\n\r\n----\r\n-Steps to reproduce-\r\n # -Modify field configuration and make Affects Version a required field-\r\n # -Create new Scrum Sample board-\r\n # -Click on + to create a new epic-\r\n\r\nh4. -Excepted Result-\r\n\r\n-Required fields show up-\r\nh4. -Actual Result-\r\n\r\n-Affects Version is missing-\r\n\r\n-(!) This does not only apply to the Affects Version field, but any required field.-\r\nh4. -Workaround-\r\n - -Add field to appropriate screen (See [Defining a Screen|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Defining+a+Screen])-",

The custom field contains:\r\n * A\r\n * B\r\n * C\r\n * D\r\n\r\nA use case would be to exclude some of those options if they are confidential, so the output looks like this (C is excluded):\r\n * A\r\n * B\r\n * D\r\n\r\nOr it could be necessary to make certain substitutions:\r\n * A\r\n * B\r\n * Y\r\n * Z\r\n\r\nOr change the formatting (in this case B is very important):\r\n * A\r\n * *B*\r\n * C\r\n * D\r\n\r\nh3.
