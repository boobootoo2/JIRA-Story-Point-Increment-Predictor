There are many tools out there for this, but we happen to use Wink - http://www.debugmode.com/wink/   .  This greatly simplifies the reproduction steps for certain issues, as instead of spending lots of time describing the issue, you can simply record your clicks, export it as a SWF, and then pass that along as the reproduction steps.\n\nWe can attach the flash files to an existing issue with no problem, however, they are not easy to view within jira, as they're treated like any other file attachment instead of being treated like an image where they can just be viewed from within jira.\n\nSimilar to CONF-991 which was implemented in Confluence 1.5, we'd like to have the ability to attach flash movies just like images and have Jira be able to play them on screen (or potentially via a new popup/div like the confluence gallery plugin).  This way, someone can view the reproduction of an issue from directly inside jira instead of having to download 1-3 files (sometimes a wrapper HTML and JS file are needed, both about 2 lines each, just so the browser activates the movie) into the same directory and launch locally.\n\nTheoretically, this could apply to Quicktime MOV's or other common file types that can be <EMBED>'d within the browser, but Flash is the primary concern here.",

The query doesn't give user any error message but on clicking \"Edit\" takes user to advanced view(simple view is not allowed) with no error message. The query is \"fixVersion = 10648 AND project = ATCWF ORDER BY key DESC\". The issue here is that fixversion is hidden for this project.\n2. I successfully reproduce this issue in JIRA 4.0.\n3. Create 1 project with version 1, 2. Save a filter in simple view by selecting the project and fixVersion value.\n4. Now the admin has make the fixversion field hidden for this project.\n5. Execution of filter doesn't give error message as its a valid JQL query in JIRA 4.0 but for user upgrading to JIRA 4.0, it will unclear what is showing the different result, when filter is not showng any error message\n\nExpected:\n1.

JIRA does show the summary, but in \"tooltip\" format with no other information, and you have to wait 3 seconds.\n\nThis would be a great feature to be able to enable; anything that reduces having to navigate to another web page in favor of making information more transparently accessible, is a really good improvement in my book. Otherwise I can see myself jumping back and forth thinking \"now what was that other issue again?\" Ideally you could customize which fields would be displayed on a popup (e.g. like 1st 500 characters of description, last comment, etc.)",

An example of this is as follows:\n\nLansing Community College (pie chart) -> Information Technology Services (ITS)(pie chart) -> Enterprise Systems (ES) (pie chart) -> ES Projects (pie chart) -> All Issue Types for a Given ES Project (pie chart) -> All Issues for a Specific Issue Type selected (tabular) -> the bottom line data for one Issue (detail page)\n\nThe idea is that this would be a graph that would show each of these levels. For the first level (LCC), there could be such areas as ITS, HR, IER, etc. for each slice to show the different organizations that are being tracked within JIRA here at LCC. In my example, we chose the path of ITS. For ITS, there could be Server, Data Center, Enterprise Systems (ES), Help Desk, etc. each showing as a pie slice.\nFor this example, I chose ES. Then, the pie chart would show a slice for every ES project currently in JIRA (including Open, Re-Opened, etc.). In this example, I chose one specific project, and then another pie chart would show all Issues for that one project (a slice per Issue Type showing the number of each Issue Type in JIRA for that project). Then, you would choose one slice of the pie chart to drill down to look at a list of all of the issues being tracked for that one project for that one Issue Type. This would now show in the normal tabular format that one normally sees in JIRA. Finally, you would select a specific issue, and see the bottom line data for that one issue.\n\nIn order to do the high level filtering, we would add in custom fields to track what Org and Sub-Orgs the Issue Types are tied to, so all the data necessary to do this drill down would already be in JIRA. And, to make this work, all that really is needed is to have the ability to have the first (top level) pie chart start with a default filter. Once the user clicks on one of the slices of the pie chart, then the next pie chart would be dynamically created based on whatever slice was chosen. The query for each pie chart is identical, but the data being searched on is different based on what slice was selected. That is what would need to be \"loaded\" into the filter before the query was executed and the new pie chart built. This would continue down the path until you reached the existing JIRA functionality of showing the tabular results and then ultimately the detail page for the one specific issue you are reviewing.\n",

This could be helped by just ensuring that if they select the issue key, it will get put on the leftmost column no matter what.\n    * Gadget width was an interesting hurdle. I added a bunch of columns and they just got hidden off the side in such a way that i didn't even realise that there was more to see. Maybe a scroll bar or something to provide a visual indication that there is more data off to the side.\n    * Is there somewhere where you can change your personal gadget defaults - set columns, horizontal ordering and sorting?? Something like this would be cool, it would mean I didn't have to pick all the columns every time I created a gadget (and would overcome most of my previous points).\n\nhttps://extranet.atlassian.com/display/QA/Brydie%27s+Findings",

If there is a match, we comment on the issue that originated the notification.

I think current JiRA DB is not storing the version creation date. Currently I can find only the list/sequence in which they has been added.\n\n We would like to have a more column under 'projectversion' table where it maintain the version creation date, it will help us in filtering when the version has been created. \nIt would be great if we capture this version creation date from JiRA frontend instead of running the query on database.\n\n\nRegards,\n- Vishal",

One and the same issue could have different resolutions per branch, i.e. invalid if a broken functionality does not exist anymore. Nevertheless, all branches have to be checked, likely in different time frames.\n\nUnfortunately JIRA does not support the notion of branches. You have to emulate the behaviour using different schemes like:\n\n    * One issue per version that represents a branch\n    * Multiple fix versions for an issue\n    * Subtasks for an issue or issue links to ckeck and fix the issue for different versions\n\nReal branching support could help you check on which branch an issue is done, where it has still to be resolved and so on without adding more and more (perhaps loosely connected) issues to your system or forgetting to fix the issue on some branch (no question/warning when resolving an issue with multiple fix versions).",

The JIRA Toolkit has a participants custom field which could be used to do this, but unfortunately it doesn't show up in the \"User Custom Field Value\" section. \n\nHowever, I tried to modify {{/secure/admin/views/issuesecurity/addissuesecurity.jsp}} and hardcoded the participants custom field as an option for the \"User Custom Field Value\" section:\ne.g. from JIRA 3.13.4\n\n{code:xml}<webwork:elseIf test=\"types/(.)/type == 'userCF'\">\n       <td>\n             <select name=\"<webwork:property value=\".\"/>\" onClick=\"document.forms['jiraform'].type[<webwork:property value=\"@status/index\"/>].checked = true;\">\n                <option value=\"\"><webwork:text name=\"'admin.schemes.issuesecurity.choose.a.custom.field'\"/></option>\n                <webwork:iterator value=\"types/(.)/displayFields\" >\n                       <option value=\"<webwork:property value=\"id\"/>\" <webwork:if test=\"../../parameter(..) == id\" >selected</webwork:if>><webwork:property value=\"name\"/></option>\n                </webwork:iterator>\n                <option value=\"customfield_10020\">Participants</option>\n             </select>\n        </td>\n </webwork:elseIf>\n{code} \n\nThis seemed to work so It would be good if we picked up any custom field that implements {{UserCFNotificationTypeAware}} (I'm guessing that is why this works).
