One or several weeks later, its computer meets a crash.\r\n\r\nAt this moment, the user realizes the snapshot branch he has working on during the last weeks was only a local branch.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nSolution:\r\n\r\nA popup upon branch creation could ask the user if its will is really to create a local branch, or if the branch should be published on a remote.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0",

Repositories will fetch latest changes from all remotes anyway when they are opened, irregardless of the preference.  Curiously, the per-repository *Refresh remote status in the background (if enabled in global preferences)* checkbox can be unchecked, and then auto-fetching no longer occurs.  However, it's cumbersome to have to uncheck this for every repository.  I would prefer that the global preference be honored instead.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n# Uncheck the *Check default remotes for updates every X minutes* checkbox from global preferences.\r\n# Open the *Tasks Monitor* debug window.\r\n# Open a repository.\r\n\r\n*Expected behavior*: No repository fetching should occur.\r\n*Actual behavior*: Observe that a \"Fetch\" task was run in the tasks monitor, and the latest remote branches have been fetched.\r\n\r\n*Workaround*: go to per-repository Settings, and uncheck *Refresh remote status in the background (if enabled in global preferences)*.  Now, fetching does not occur.  However, it's an annoying workaround because I have to do it for every repository and I'd rather have it apply globally.\r\n\r\n(NOTE:  I am assuming the *if enabled in global preferences* phrase in per-repository settings refers to the global *Check default remotes for updates every X minutes* checkbox in the global settings.......)",
