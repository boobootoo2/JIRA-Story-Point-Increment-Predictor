This locks all fields of the issue except the links. \n\nUnder normal circumstances it is good to leave open the ability to edit links after an issue is rendered uneditable with the above flag. However, for traceability and consistency of our system for an ISO auditor it would be great if there was an extra property to set on a state like: jira.issue.linkseditable=false. This would allow us to force a user to open an issue in order to change links.

An issue for one of the products will often be relevant for other products (or several versions of the same product), in which case we set several fixVersions in Jira. The problem is the difficulty of tracking which versions the issue is actually fixed for. Currently we often end up using cloned issues, one for each fixVersion, or \"reminder tasks\" (port issue so and so to version so and so. But this is, quite frankly, not a good solution at all, it is a hassle, it spreads information over several issues and it does not give a good visibility of the resolution status of the issue.\n{quote}\n",

I would assume it does not work correctly on the others as well, but we did not rename any Bamboo users and we installed Confluence after renaming the users.\n\nFor example, in my case, my AD name was previously aaron.jenkins. It was renamed to just aaron as a company-wide policy change in naming. Crowd understood this and synchronized it fine, but JIRA instead created a new user called aaron and left the old one, while simultaneously breaking authentication. I have lost the exception, but it was essentially telling me that it found multiple results when looking up a user. It was not until I opened the database in MySQL (whichever version Ubuntu 14.04 comes with) and manually renamed the old users AND deleted the new users it worked.\n\nSo, my steps for repairing were\n\nuser id 293020: aaron.jenkins\nuser id 404040: aaron\n\nI had to rename aaron to aaron-, then rename aaron.jenkins to aaron, then delete aaron-. I had to do this in the cwd_user table, the app_user table, and the cwd_membership table.\n\nVersion\t6.2\nBuild Number\t6252\nBuild Date\tWed Feb 19 00:00:00 GMT 2014\nBuild Revision\taa343257d4ce030d9cb8c531be520be9fac1c996\n\nEDIT: this is more of a JIRA issue, I accidentally put it in the Confluence project, sorry.",

Summary\n\nIf the JIRA WebHook destination connection fails for any reason, such as the below, there will be no errors in the log, so no exceptions - essentially WebHooks fail silently:\n * The domain uses self signed certificate that's not in the Java trust store.\n * There's any other problem with verifying SSL connection (like certificate issued by an unknown CA, protocol/cipher mismatch and so on).\n * The host cannot be reached, due to network configuration.\n * The URL is invalid.\n\nThis makes it hard to understand why the connection failed, as nothing is written about the failure.\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\n # Setup a WebHook to send to a target that will fail (for example, it uses a self-signed certificate not in the JIRA's trust store, or SSL is configured in a way that will generate an exception, or the URL does not exist).\n # Attempt to send the WebHook by performing the JIRA action that triggers it.\nh3. Expected Results\n\n\nThe exception is written to the logs.\nh3. Actual Results\n\nNo exception is written to the logs or thrown.\nh3. Diagnose\n\nIdentify why the connection is failing - this can be tested outside of JIRA by using network tools such as {{cURL}}, {{telnet}} and/or {{ping}}. For example, if the target URL is www.example.com/webhook/test/ perform these tests from the JIRA server:\n * If using the {{-Dhttp.nonProxyHosts}} argument, the request may be failing due to JRA-43143 (WebHooks are not respecting this argument).\n * {{ping www.example.com}} to see if the servers can establish a network connection.\n * {{telnet www.example.com 80}} to see if the appropriate port is open.\n * {{curl -X POST www.example.com/webhook/test/}} to see that you can submit a {{POST}} to the target server.\n\nIf these tests fail, it can indicate that network / firewall / DNS configurations may need to be addressed, depending upon the errors returned from the different tests.\n\nIf this is SSL related, ensure to import the self-signed certificate into the trust store as per [Connecting to SSL services|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Connecting+to+SSL+services].",

When the chart is rendered its results are ambiguous (see attached) including the results in both \"Other\" (a user entry) and in the automatically summarized field \"Other\" containing the remaining entries of smaller quantity. Clicking on this auto-generated \"Other\" however does not include the user selected \"Other\" entries.\n\nI propose that it would be more clear if the auto-generated summation on the pie chart called \"Other\" should not include any user entries that may also by chance be called \"Other\". Perhaps an even better approach would be to name this auto-generated summation something that is not likely to be used as a user selectable entry but still gets the point across that these are an automatically generated summary of the remaining entries.\n\nFor example, name the other entries as \"Other Entries\" or \"Other Choices\".",

Summary of bug\n\nWhen using JIRA with JAVA 1.8 (and using it in a non-English language), JIRA might not recognize the dates properly, even when they are set according to the date picker format\n\nh3. Steps to replicate\n\n# Setup JIRA with JAVA 1.8 (preferable JIRA 6.3 and above)\n# Set JIRA to use one of the affected languages (more on that later). For now we shall use German\n# Set the due date to be in March\n# The result is as follows :\n!german lang.png|thumbnail!\n\nh3. Additional Info\n\n* This does not seem to be able to be replicated if using JAVA 1.7 or below\n* Another affected language found so far is Czech :\n!czech lang.png|thumbnail!\n* This seems to only affect certain months/patterns (for example, using the German language example above, March is affected, but not December)\n* Tested in JIRA 6.3.9 with Postgres\n\n*Possible Workaround:*\n- Change the date format from _20/Mrz/15_ to _20.03.15_ with the below setting in _Advanced Settings_:\n{noformat}\njira.date.picker.javascript.format=%d.%m.%y\njira.date.time.picker.javascript.format=%d.%m.%y %H:%M\njira.date.time.picker.java.format=d.MM.yy H:mm\njira.date.picker.java.format=d.MM.yy\n{noformat}\n\n- For Cloud instances, kindly create a support ticket at https://support.atlassian.com/ to perform the above workaround.",

For example, an older issue with an archived Version is resurrected, or a \"closed\" issue needs some data clean-up for accurate metrics.\n\nAt present, there is no way to override these read-only states...the only way to deal with \"clean-up\" situations is to undo the read-only state (e.g. un-archive the Version or temporarily remove the {{jira.issue.editable}} setting).  Both of these require administrator permissions (either Project or System), and this adds to the administrative workload.\n\nThis request is for a capability to define the users/groups/roles that are allowed to \"override\" these read-only settings.  This would allow JIRA administrators to share the workload a little more with the user community (e.g. allowing users with a privileged project role to edit read-only issues in that project).  Making this configurable per instance will enable this capability while still respecting the specific data integrity requirements of each instance.",
