Although the REST API can reveal some of this information, it does not contain all of it.\u00a0\u00a0Please consider developing a complete glossary/dictionary of the available smart values for each product in the Atlassian ecosystem, and make it automatically updated from the source code of releases of automation and the REST API.\u00a0 Such a glossary/dictionary will save customers a large amount of time, and no doubt reduce the number of contacts to Atlassian support.\r\n\r\nThanks for your work to improve Jira!",

As *testusera* was created first and its records are listed in the *app_user* and *cwd_user* tables before the information of *usera*, Automation for Jira will match the information and try to add *testusera's information* instead.\r\n\r\nThis can cause incorrect users to be added, along with further issues if the incorrect user is disabled or does not have the required permissions to be added as an approver.\r\n\r\n* Workaround\r\n\r\nUse the *More Options* section and specify the parameter being used to be the *user_key* or *username* instead. You can use the example below for the *username* as a reference:\r\n\r\n{code}\r\n{\r\n    \"update\": {\r\n        \"Approvers\": [\r\n            {\r\n                \"add\": { \"name\": \"{{issue.customfield_XXXXX}}\" }\r\n            }\r\n        ]\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n{code}  \r\n\r\n(!)

Issue Summary\r\n\r\nWhen configuring two rules: one to link an issue and the other one to act on \"issue linked\" event, we noticed that using \"Issue linked match\" condition confuses the source and destination of the issue link if the issue link has \"Inward Description\" same as \"Outward Description\" (e.g 'relates to' that works in both ways).\r\n\r\nFor example, linking issue1 to issue2 using the 'relates to' link in an A4J rule will end up in:\r\n * issue1 *relates to* issue2\r\nAND\r\n * issue2 *relates to* issue1\r\n\r\nHowever, running the \"Issue linked match\" in the second rule will run the check on issue2 instead of issue1.\r\n\r\nPS: This issue is not reproducible when:\r\n * Using a different issue link that has \"Inward Description\" different than \"Outward Description\" (e.g blocks)\r\n * Linking the issues manually to trigger the second rule.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Create two rules as follows and enable the second rule to be triggered by other rules:\r\n+Rule 1:+\r\n ** When \"Issue Created\"\r\n ** Then \"Link the issue to TSP-7 using the 'relates to' link\"\r\n!Screenshot 2021-06-08 at 14.38.30.png|width=327,height=173!\r\n+Rule 2:+\r\n ** When \"Issue Linked\"\r\n ** If \"'some linked issues' using 'relates to' link match: JQL 'issuekey=TSP-7'\"\r\n ** Then \"Add a comment 'Link verified' to the current issue\"\r\n!Screenshot 2021-06-08 at 14.40.48.png|width=300,height=171! \r\n!Screenshot 2021-06-08 at 14.40.56.png|width=275,height=149!\r\n # Create an issue in the test project. (in the example TSP-34)\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nThe second rule should add a comment \"Link verified\" to the created (TSP-34) issue since it was linked by 'relates to' to 'TSP-7' by the first rule.\r\n\r\nHere is the result of the execution of the first rule:\r\n\r\n!Screenshot 2021-06-08 at 15.01.45.png|width=401,height=137!\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nHere we can see that Rule 2 ran successfully but doesn't add a comment and throws \"The following issues did not match the condition: TSP-7\".\r\n\r\n!Screenshot 2021-06-08 at 15.03.00.png|width=872,height=133!\r\n\r\nThe rule uses TSP-7 as Source issue and TSP-34 as Destination issue. It should be the opposite or at least the rule should run for both issues.\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nAs a workaround, you can edit the Issue Link configuration (under {_}Administration > Issues > Issue linking{_}) and make sure to use an \"Inward Description\" different than the \"Outward Description\".\r\nIn this example, we have changed \"relates to\" to \"is related to\" for the Inward Description:\r\n!IssueLinkingDiff.png|width=361,height=154!\r\n\r\nP.S: After editing the issue link then reverting it back to the original configuration (\"Inward Description\"=\"Outward Description\"), the issue is no more reproducible.\r\nh3. Note\r\n\r\nThere are some cases where we noticed a weird behavior of the 'relates to' issue link when used in an A4J automation rule. The rule may stop or resume working suddenly after modifying that issue link (e.g one of the descriptions). It is recommended to avoid using the 'relates to' issue link in this case until this BUG is further investigated.",
