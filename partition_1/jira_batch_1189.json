Summary\nIn JIRA, according to the [Atlassian Design Guidelines|https://design.atlassian.com/2.1/product/patterns/date-formats/] relative dates are shown such as \"Yesterday\". The absolute date and time can be shown using a tooltip.\n\nEarlier versions of JIRA presented the relative date as \"Yesterday 5:00pm\", which helped JIRA users determine _when_ yesterday the date is making reference to, which is useful when dealing with young dates.\n\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\n# Create a new issue in JIRA (version 6.3+)\n# Wait a day.\n# Observe the Created date is in-line with the Atlassian Design Guidelines\n# Observe that there is no option to show the time without hovering over the date.\n\nh3. Expected Results\nA method to show the relative date with a time.\n\nh3. Actual Results\nNo option to show the relative date with the time.\n\nh3. Notes\nThis is not a bug, but a feature request. The documentation [Customizing the Look and Feel|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Customizing+the+Look+and+Feel#CustomizingtheLookandFeel-Date/TimeFormats] provides details about Time Formats in JIRA.\n\nh3. Workarounds\n# Using the tooltip, users can see the absolute value of a JIRA date.\n# Following the steps in: [Disable Relative Dates in JIRA|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRAKB/Disable+Relative+Dates+in+JIRA]",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-42751].\n  {panel}\n\nI have read through this page:\nhttps://confluence.atlassian.com/display/Cloud/Cloning%20an%20Issue?continue=https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/Cloud/Cloning%20an%20Issue?src=search \n\nI would like to suggest that the same option which exists for Reporter (that it will list me as the reporter when I clone an issue) to also be setup for the Assignee.\n\nAs an example we have users call our Helpdesk and if they have the same or even a similar issue I would like to be able to clone it (thus saving me lots of time trying to fill out the work order request (/trouble ticket)) and just readjust the Summary and Description without anyone else needing to be notified via email that I had made a clone of the previously closed/completed work order (unless the admin must see it) just because they had helped this person in the past and was listed as the Assignee.\nSince I am taking the call I would expect that I would be the Reporter and that I would also be the Assignee.\n\nAnother example is I have a work order with 4 sub-tasks for when we have a newly hired student worker. These sub-tasks go out to their respective areas requesting activation of an account or access to a network folder etc. Now the student is graduating and will no longer be working for us. I would like to open up that initial work order which says, \"please grant access to. . . \" Clone it and all the sub-tasks and have all of them assigned to me as Reporter and Assignee. Then all the information is there for the name of the student, their account, the access they needed, etc. Next I change the wording from \"please grant access to. . . \"  to  \"remove access from . .  \" on each of the work orders. Then assign it from me to the other individual/area for completion.\n\nRight now if I clone the work order in the example above an email is generated to all the individuals in the sub-tasks and the wording in the Summary for those sub-tasks says that it is a Clone - . I have no opportunity to change anything in the sub-tasks just the main work order. Then any changes I make to the work order will send them an email, unless I change the assignee from them to me. Then on each of the sub-tasks I remove the \"Clone-\" from the Summary, remove/add labels and change the verbiage to \"remove access from\" in the description and then change the assignee back to that person.\n\nIf I automatically became the Reporter and the Assignee then all the emails for any change I make are not needed until the Work Order and sub-tasks are ready to be seen.\n\nHere's for Hoping the Assignee can also have the option to be like the Reporter and be automatically given to the person Cloning the Work Order.  Thanks for listening.\nKris",

Suggested Solution and Why this is important\r\nAs a manager, it is tedious to have to manually count the Remaining Estimate every time we want to update the Original Estimate. We would preferably just edit the Original Estimate, such that the Remaining Estimate will be automatically calculated.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround \r\n* Currently, the only workaround is to update the remaining estimate value manually based on the *Original Estimate* new value and the *Time Spent* value.",

I've also got lots of filters set up to help us navigate to the relevant issue lists for each section of the meeting.\n\nWhat I'd like to see is a gadget similar to the \"Favourite Filters\" gadget, but instead of only showing the favourite filters (where each user can only have one list), you can specify a list of filters to use in this instance of the gadget. That way I could have a different filter list on each dashboard, and also have other information and graphs on there.\n\nAt present I've achieved this using multiple \"Filter Results\" gadgets and limiting to one item per list, but this isn't practical and a list of filters in the same format as \"Favourite Filters\" would be much better. I looked into writing my own, but apparently you can't write custom gadgets for OnDemand (accoriding to https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/Cloud/Restricted+Functions+in+Cloud+Applications)\n\nI tried searching the project for existing items but couldn't seem to find anything, apologies if I missed it.\n\nMany thanks,\nJames",

There seems to be no functional problem from the UI side.\n\nWhen clicking on an mp4 attachment, it will play the video in the web browser with no indication of any problem, but JIRA logs a {{ClientAbortException}}.\n* This doesn't seem to happen for small files that are less than 1 MB (rought estimate)\n* For files that are a couple MB in size, it happens upon first request, but not after. I believe this is because of caching\n* I've been able to always reproduce this with larger files of great than a couple hundred MB\n\nh3. Environment\nReproducible on the browsers below: \n- Chrome 42.0.2311.135 (64-bit) \n- Safari 7.1 (9537.85.10.17.1)\n\nThe error does not happen when streaming the video on Firefox 37.0.2. \n\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\n# Upload a .mp4 video file to an issue ticket (e.g. [^SampleVideo_360x240_5mb.mp4]).\n#* Use larger files for best results\n# Click on the video, which will cause it to start playing in your web browser\n\nh3. Expected Results\nNo errors are written to the logs.\n\nh3. Actual Results\nThe errors below will be written to the JIRA logs:\n{{catalina.out}} or {{atlassian-jira.log}}:\n{code}\n2015-03-27 16:02:54,535 http-bio-8080-exec-5 ERROR admin 962x252x1 1g0nbm1

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-42577].\n  {panel}\n\nWe have configured our JIRA workflow to use automatic workflow transitions with triggers from Stash. Specifically, when a pull request is merged the issue is transitioned from 'In Review' to 'Resolved'.  However, we have a slightly unusual setup in that we have more than one Stash repository per project and it is not uncommon for a JIRA issue to be associated with changes in more than one repository. As a result, it is quite common for a JIRA issue to have more than one pull request. Our problem is that as soon as the first pull request is approved the developer merges the branch without waiting for the other pull request(s) to be approved. This transitions the issue to Resolved even though there is still one or more outstanding pull request. Ideally, it should not be transitioned to Resolved until all pull requests are merged. I think the best way to achieve this would be to have a Condition that can be added to the transition which would prevent the transition if there are outstanding pull requests. ",

Problem\n\nUsers discover that certain issues are not able to be transitioned (e.g. Done, Fixed, etc.)\n\nFor at least one customer this problem can occur when a SQL exception happens during issue creation.  Custom fields of type URL are limited to 255 characters but in JIRA 6.4.4 this is not enforced by validation in the UI.  When using MySQL this results in a SQL exception and creation of a partial issue record which can not be indexed. \n!Long-URL-Exception.png|thumbnail! \n\nThis is a possible regression of JRA-4241.\n\n\nh4. Workaround: Integrity Checker\n\nRunning integrity checker will solve the problem\n\n\nh4. Workaround: Field validation using Script Runner Behaviours\n\nIf users report a SQL exception when creating issues you can prevent this by adding validation behaviors to the custom fields.\n\nThis is useful for JIRA versions prior to 6.4.12 when you have many workflows and transitions so adding a validation to all of them would be too time consuming.\n\n# Install the [Script Runner|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.onresolve.jira.groovy.groovyrunner] add-on which provides the [Behaviours|https://scriptrunner.adaptavist.com/latest/jira/behaviours-overview.html] feature.\n# Navigate to JIRA_BASE_URL/secure/admin/Behaviours!default.jspa\n# Create a new Behavior\n# Click on the \"Fields\" link next to the newly created Behaviour\n# Add the field(s) you want to protect with the behavior.\n# For each field click \"Add serverside script\" and insert Groovy scripting to check the field length.  Example: {code}\ndef url_field = getFieldById(getFieldChanged())\nif (url_field == null) {\n  return 0;\n}\ndef value = url_field.getValue();\nif (value == null) {\n  return 0;\n}\nif (value.length() > 255) {\n  url_field.setError(\"URL is too long, must be less than 255 characters.\");\n} else {\n  url_field.clearError();\n}\n{code}\n!^Workaround-BehaviorFix.png|thumbnail!\n\n\n\nh4. Workaround: Add workflow validations\n\nIf users report a SQL exception when creating issues you can prevent this by adding validation to transitions in your workflow.\n\nThis is useful for JIRA versions prior to 6.4.12 when you do not have many workflows/transitions or you cannot purchase the Script Runner add-on.\n\n# Install the [JIRA Suite Utilities|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.googlecode.jira-suite-utilities] add-on (free)\n# Edit the workflow\n# For the Create transition add a validation.\n# Choose the [regular expression validation|https://jsutil.atlassian.net/wiki/display/JSUTIL/JIRA+Suite+Utilities+Workflow+Validators#JIRASuiteUtilitiesWorkflowValidators-RegularExpressionCheckValidator]. \n# Enter this regular expression to limit a field to 255 characters: {code}^[^\\s]{0,255}${code}\n#* Here's a screenshot of the configuration screen:\n!Regular-Expression-Length-Check.png|thumbnail!
