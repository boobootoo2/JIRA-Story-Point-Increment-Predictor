Under the current implementation I am mapping customer issues to our product release on a JIRA project by project basis. This is fine for a customer-facing view. But there are scenarios where I have implemented a couple JIRA projects for 1 customer to accommodate their workflow. In this 2nd scenario looking at a release on a JIRA project by project basis fails.\n\n*Requested Behaviour*\nAllow to view multiple release version under one release view page. We can have this in board's release menu. Customer could define a product version, and under that have various releases versions. Then in any of the JIRA projects they would just tie the project to that product version(s), and thereafter be able to select fix version(s) from the list of releases that exist under that product version.\n\n",

For more detailed example, please refer here:\n\n{quote}We'd like a way of adding individuals' holiday schedules and exclude these from the working time available calculation, such as when assigning tasks to a Sprint.\nFor example, 4 weeks with 37.5 hours = 150 hours per person, but with a 2-week vacation in the middle is only leaves 75 working hours for that person.{quote}\n\nh3.

In the case where a customer wants to include this field in an 'Issue Collector' as a 'Required' field, the customer cannot as placing this requirement on the existing 'Attachment' field would alter this fields behavior for the entire JIRA instance.\n\n\nh3. Environment\nCloud\nServer\n\n\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\n- Goto: Administration > Issues > Custom Fields\n\nor \n\n- Type G+G \n- Type in 'Custom Fields'\n- Press 'Enter'\n\n\nh3. Expected Results\nWhen clicking the 'Add custom field' button, a user should be able to search for 'Attachment'\nThe user should be able to apply the same type of attributes to this field as they would with the already existing 'Attachment' field: Required, etc.\n\n\nh3. Actual Results\nWhen clicking the 'Add custom field' button and searching for 'Attachment' there are no results found as we currently do not allow for a custom field of the type 'Attachment' to be created\n\n \nh3. Notes\nIn the case of requiring an attachment field within an 'Issue Collector' form, this is not possible as we do not outright expose the code for the 'Issue Collector'. This means that validating the 'Attachment' field is not possible as there is no way to attach the 'onClick' event to the form submission button\n",

Step to Reproduce\n # Configure an outgoing mail server\n # Create a filter\n # A user with a Microsoft Exchange mail account subscribes to the filter\n # Wait for JIRA to send the filter subscription mail\n # Open mail with outlook or online browser OWA\n\nh3. Expected result\n\n!image-2016-07-21-18-16-58-095.png|thumbnail!\nh3. Actual Result\n\n!screenshot-1.png|thumbnail!\nFilter subscription email is only broken for specific affected mail servers (e.g. exchance, mail.ru), other mail servers like gmail are unaffected.\n\n\u00a0\nh3. Workaround\n* Change the email format from HTML to Text.\n* Check if the affected mail server has advanced settings that allow you to configure HTML rendering, and see if settings can be tweaked to avoid modifying or simplifying the HTML source in such a way that it breaks.\n\nh3. Notes\n* JIRA 6.4.x filter subscription mails don't exibit this bug\n* Problem\u00a0seems to be related to the way the different mail servers try to simplify some complex html tags in the email source for rendering.\n*Update*\n* Similar issue is reproducible with\u00a0mail.ru",

Without happy customers, we\u2019re doomed. So considering the customer perspective - collectively, not just a handful - comes first.\" - Do you believe removing functionality that adversely affects the end user, whilst not communicating the intent before the fact in release notes or otherwise, aligns with this company value? Do you feel you have treat your customers fairly here?\n\n\"Open company, no bullshit\" - Do you believe that withholding information on drastic product changes in your release notes constitutes an \"Open company, no bullshit\"?\n\nSecondly, in the spirit of providing solutions and not just pointing out problems, I would like to know how Atlassian would view a community attempt to re-instate this functionality through a free JIRA Core plug-in released on the Atlassian Marketplace. Can you clarify and confirm that if the community does chose to create such a plug-in that allows anonymous users to view issues in a board format, functionality that was present in previous versions, that Atlassian will not remove this plug in from the Atlassian Marketplace?\n\nThank you for your responses so far and I especially look forward to Atlassian's comment on free community JIRA Core add-ons.",

Summary\n\nSome users with visual disabilities will have to zoom in a significant percentage to be able to work as normal. JIRAs design when zoomed in isn't user friendly and gives users a hard time navigating and working with JIRA with all the pop ups in different pages in JIRA\nh3. Suggestion\n\nImprove on JIRAs design for users with visual disabilities. This includes having pop ups appear in less obstructive places.\n\nEven better if users have an option to select in the profile page for those visually impaired. When this option is selected, JIRAs design will switch to a more user friendly interface while magnified at the same time. It should also handle pop up dialogs gracefully (eg. workflow editor when zoomed in, re-index dialog) so that it doesn't consume much UI space\n\n\u00a0",

Summary\n\nAtlassian HTTP Client's callbacks' ThreadPoolExecutor doesn't queue callbacks, so it might reject tasks submitted to it during high load (when no threads available right at the moment of submitting a task). \nIn such cases it throws {{java.util.concurrent.RejectedExecutionException}} from the {{execute}} method in a submitting thread.\nApache HTTP Client doesn't expect that, so it throws {{org.apache.http.nio.reactor.IOReactorException}} when catching {{RejectedExecutionException}} and changes IOReactor status to STOPPED therefore preventing further requests being sent by this client bean.\nOne of the consequences is that WebHooks stop working after it happens.\nh3. Environment\n\nAny JIRA up to 7.2.0\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\n # Enable DEBUG logging for {{com.atlassian.httpclient}}\n # Set up an HTTP endpoint (preferably having a timeout of 30+ sec before responding)\n # Configure a WebHook against it\n # Make a bulk edit of 1000 issues\n # Cross the fingers\n # Repeat bulk edits until you see {{java.util.concurrent.RejectedExecutionException}} in the logs.\n\nh3. Expected Results\n - No {{java.util.concurrent.RejectedExecutionException}} thrown\n - No {{org.apache.http.nio.reactor.IOReactorException}} thrown\n - All JIRA's outgoing HTTP requests (including webhooks) continue working\n\nh3. Actual Results\n - Apache HTTP client's reactor status is STOPPED\n - Webhooks (as well as some other functionality) do not work\n\nh3. Workaround\n\nThat might only *decrease the probability* of this issue, but not fix it completely:\n - Decrease the number of webhooks\n - Decrease the number of errors when calling webhooks (e.g. get rid of webhooks often throwing TimeoutExceptions, etc.)\n - Better hardware might also help *slightly*\n\nActions that help if the issue actually happened:\n - Disabling/enabling the Atlassian HTTP Client plugin\n *OR*\n - Restarting JIRA.\n\nNote:\n - Disabling/enabling the Atlassian HTTP Client Plugin will trigger other plugins to be restarted.

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-61935].\n  {panel}\n\nHallo,\n\nIch habe am letzten Mittwoch mein Account selber erstellt und dann habe ich eine Best\u00e4tigungsemail bekommen. Laut diese ist mein User \u201eyoanats\u201c. \n\nLeider habe ich keinen Zugriff auf das was ich brauche. Und zwar - ich kann mich in JIRA einloggen, aber wenn ich auf \u201eCreate Issue\u201c clicke, muss ich als Project \u201e Mobile Portal Mkt Request\u201c ausw\u00e4hlen. Mir wird aber diese Option \u00fcberhaupt nicht gezeigt. Das Gleiche passiert mit Issue Type- ich muss als Issue Type \u201eContent\u201c ausw\u00e4hlen. Leider sehe ich diese Option nicht. Woran kann es liegen? Laut Christian Seifert habe ich Zugriff auf MPI und PORCONIN. \n\nKannst du mir weiterhelfen?\n\nDanke sch\u00f6n und VG\nYoana",
