With this poor use of space, in landscape mode, only one issue card is visible sometimes.\r\n\r\nCan you improve the board display on mobile to be able to see more issue cards? Even reducing the white space in the header for the lanes would go a long way, but I think you can go much further: I think in this view, the top status bar of Android can be disabled (at the very least in landscape view), so the screen can go [Full Screen|[http://example.com|https://developer.android.com/training/system-ui/immersive]]. You can even hide the bottom navigation, if you do, the user can still bring it back with a swipe up from bottom, I don't thin it would cause problems.\r\n\r\nPlease do something with this screen, it is very hard to use in the current state.

Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Install a connect add-on which defines an entity property alias or add a custom field named \"project\".\r\n # add a value for that entity property/custom field to an issue which is not the name or key of a project (eg: 'bleh').\r\n# Attempt to search for that value in JQL ({{project = bleh}}).\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nOne single issue in search results\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n{{The value 'bleh' does not exist for the field 'Project'.}}\r\n\r\nh3.

The dialog could show a concise text and a couple of buttons:\r\n* *Text*: Looping transitions are frequently useful from other statuses too. Would you like to create a global looping transition?\r\n* *Button 1*: Make global\r\n* *Button 2*: No, thanks\r\n\r\nAdditionally, a _Read more_ or (?) icon would ideally link to a documentation page which explained the advantages of using global looping transitions.",

Workaround\r\n\r\nTo work around this issue, call the filter by number and apply the sort at the time of use. Example:\r\n\r\n{code}filter = 47420 ORDER BY priority DESC{code}\r\n\r\nAs reported by a customer:\r\n\r\n{quote}An Employee created a search filter. \r\nWhen run it includes the ORDER BY priority DESC.\r\nIf you go to the full url of the search string it works as expected, and you can click on the P column to sort by priority. Given the operator in the filter it appears properly as descending.\r\nIf within Jira you do a search filter=\"some sumber\"\r\nIt displays the tickets, however the priority is not shown in DESC order. There is no way of course to click on it either. \r\nThis is causing issues as we use the Jira macro to list jira tickets based on a filter. While prior with wiki mark up we could add operators, this is not possible now.\r\nIn this case with the Jira macro it truncates the url to filter=\"some number\"\r\nThis is an issue as we want to display the list properly sorted based on the search criteria. We are able to replicate this in Jira, but creating a filter, then doing a search with filter=\"Some number\"{quote}\r\n\r\nh5. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Go to Manage Filters\r\n# Identify the filterid of any filter\r\n# Go to the Issue Navigator\r\n-# In Advanced mode, enter filter=<id>\r\n# Compare to the results of clicking through to the filter from Manage Filters",

Notes\r\n\r\nPoint to note that the New Issue View uses SPA (Single Page App) which makes seamless navigation possible and dynamically load pages fast.
