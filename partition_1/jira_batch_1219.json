However, the length of this input is not validated on the browser side. So when an object filter longer than 255 characters is entered into the field it fails against the database server causing an ugly SQL exception to be thrown at the user.\n\nIt's better to add validation for this entry on the client side for a few reasons:\n* Although, standard databases would reject the input, Hsql for instance, did not enforce this column constraint and accepted the entry. This may cause failure in the future, if a user tries to migrate the same instance from Hsql to a production-worthy environment.\n* The related bug report, regarding increasing the ammount of characters allowed for filters has been marked as wont fix (https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRA-24799), so having a user friendly message that warns the user about this limitation/restriction will be nice.",

But for those with the permission, there may indeed be a likelihood that inexperienced JIRA project administrators, while editing a workflow that is limited to their project, may assume that editing the statuses(e.g status description) is limited to their project as well, not knowing that these changes are actually global, and would affect all workflows using the status.\n\nPerhaps it's best not to allow statuses to be editable from within the workflow, or perhaps it's possible to make it a bit more obvious (perhaps by a warning) that such changes are global.",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-36881].\n  {panel}\n\nh4. Context\nWhen using JQL with auto-complete switched on, searching for fields will always list global values. For instance, when using the IN operator in JQL, auto-complete will \"give away\" values for the majority of fields. Given that for each individual project there are schemes restricting or limiting the available fields, only context-specific values should be accessible for the user.\nThe current behaviour seems to be potentially problematic with regard to usability or security concerns.\n\nh4. Objective\nAs a user, I want the auto-complete function to only present field values relevant for my context.\n\nWith \"my context\" meaning:\n# Projects, I have permission to browse; or \n# Values for fields that are configured/enabled via a scheme configuration for that project.\n\n_In other words: the behaviour and underlying logic of JIRA's JQL search capabilities should respect project configuration and permissions to not reveal global field values._\n\nh4. Steps to reproduce\n# Create a user that has access only to one particular project.\n# Configure the project in the following way:\n## A basic workflow (eg. only with three statuses TODO, DOING, DONE).\n## No Custom Fields used on any screen or any scheme;\n# In JIRA, browse to \"Search for issues\" in Advanced mode and try the following:\n## status IN (\n -> Auto-complete will display a preview of all existing statuses (in addition to our three).\n## project IN (\"My Project\") AND\n -> A preview of globally existing custom fields will be displayed.\n\nOther fields which are affected by the described behaviour as well are:\n* Issue Type \n* Status\n* Assignee\n* Resolution\n* Component\n* FixVersion\n* Custom Fields\n\nh4. Footnote\n* The search for projects _does_ respect the configuration. As a user, auto-complete only displays a list of projects I am authorised to browse:\n{code}\nproject IN ( \n{code}\n",

Although the migration dialog shows a summary of changes that will be made to the Issue, including a list of fields that will be removed by migrating, it appears this may not be visible enough.\n\n# I think it's arguable whether it's right for such custom field data to completely disappear from the database as well, because in most use cases a person moving an issue or migrating issue type is not necessarily intending to delete custom field data. Also, whereas other changes to issue fields can be mapped and even reverted in the future, data lost from the custom field cannot be reverted. Perhaps the data can be retained somewhere in the database even though it's no longer available in the new project or issuetype, but that's one of the issues.\n# Perhaps there should be some improvement in the migration dialog as well:\n* can include a specific warning that the data lost can no longer be retrieved, which the user acknowledges to proceed, rather than simply listing the field in a general summary of changes confirmation screen.\n* can include an option in the dialog to modify the context of the custom field to include the target project or issue type, which will automatically update the custom field configuration and avoid the data loss.\n\n*Workaround*\nSee [this knowledge base article| https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRAKB/Change+Context+for+an+Existing+Custom+Field+Without+Losing+Old+Data] for the necessary steps to change custom field contexts without losing existing data.",
