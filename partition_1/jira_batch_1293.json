The email that we receive as a notification stating the ticket was created seems fine, it has all the information that was submitted (except for the ticket number), but when you click on the link (ticket number), it will be an outdated ticket.... It's very strange! \n{quote}\nand one more about subscription:\n{quote}\nOne of our users had a subscription set up that she had deleted, along with the filter used for the subscription, so both of these no longer exist. The subscription is still being sent on the schedule she had set up, and it's always the same old data. I posted a message on the forum but their ideas have not worked. Can anyone help me with this? I don't think there has been any info in the log on it, but I'll attach those just in case, along with one of the email subscriptions that was just sent last night.\n{quote}\n\nPerhaps JIRA should:\n- on the Import page give option to manually enable the services after the restore, but by default disable them,\n- after restore list all disabled services,\n- display warning in the UI that services are disabled,\n- allow to manually enable the single services from the UI.",

Currently I have to recreate the same context many times (taking me 10 min for each context) where as if I could copy the context it would take me less than a minute each.  \n\nI'm (hopefully) only doing this once so unless there is an existing method a fix won't really help me but it may help others or even myself if I'm unfortunate enough to have to configure multiple contexts again in the future.",

The template type does not provide a list of _com.atlassian.jira.mail.TemplateIssue_ objects resulting in severe limitations on available data. This makes it extremely challenging to support the hundreds of Blackberry users we have a Electronic Arts.\n\nThe issue with Blackberry support is the email client converts HTML messages to TEXT leaving an unreadable message if it contains tables or URL's. Table structures are removed and replaced with space delimited fields and URL's are presented in place in full, no matter how long and unreadable they are on the tiny screen. None of the HTML templates are readable on a blackberry device, and the TEXT templates only tell you the absolute bare minimum about each issue.\n\nThe documentation at [http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/JIRA+3.6+-+Velocity+Context+for+Email+Templates] does not mention the collection variable $issues, and the items it contains do not appear to be the _com.atlassian.jira.mail.TemplateIssue_ data type.\n\\\\\n\\\\\nTake a look at the following template.\n\\\\\n{noformat}\\atlassian-jira\\WEB-INF\\classes\\templates\\email\\text\\includes\\issuesummary.vm{noformat}\n\\\\\nIt contains statements such as\n\\\\\n{code}$issue.getNiceTimeEstimate($i18n){code}\n\\\\\nThe $issue variable is part of the velocity context in a similar way the collection $issues is part of the context in the following template.\n\\\\\n{noformat}\\atlassian-jira\\WEB-INF\\classes\\templates\\email\\text\\filtersubscription.vm{noformat}\n\\\\\nIt seems logical the following code should work in the filtersubscription.vm template right?\n\\\\\n{code}#foreach ($issue in $issues)\n[$issue.getKey()] Time Estimate: $issue.getNiceTimeEstimate($i18n)\n#end{code}\n\\\\\nAll you get is\n\\\\\n{noformat}\n[SM-7] Time Estimate: $issue.getNiceTimeEstimate($i18n) \n[SM-6] Time Estimate: $issue.getNiceTimeEstimate($i18n) \n[SM-5] Time Estimate: $issue.getNiceTimeEstimate($i18n) \n[SM-4] Time Estimate: $issue.getNiceTimeEstimate($i18n) \n[SM-3] Time Estimate: $issue.getNiceTimeEstimate($i18n) \n[SM-2] Time Estimate: $issue.getNiceTimeEstimate($i18n) \n[SM-1] Time Estimate: $issue.getNiceTimeEstimate($i18n)\n{noformat}\n\\\\\nIt would seem the logic is not the same between the two template types, and the source code proves that in _\\jira\\src\\java\\com\\atlassian\\jira\\mail\\SubscriptionMailQueueItem.java_ line 303.\n\n{code}\n. . .\nSearchResults results = searcher.search(sr, u, PagerFilter.getUnlimitedFilter());\nList issues = results.getIssues();\n. . . \nActionContext.setContext(oldCtx);\ncontextParams.put(\"baseHREF\", getBaseURLWithoutContext(baseURL));\ncontextParams.put(\"issueTableHtml\", issueTableHtml);\ncontextParams.put(\"issues\", issues);   \ncontextParams.put(\"constantsManager\", ManagerFactory.getConstantsManager());\ncontextParams.put(\"userManager\", UserManager.getInstance());\ncontextParams.put(\"user\", u);\n{code}\n\\\\\nThe $issues collection is a collection of _com.atlassian.jira.issue.Issue_ rather than _com.atlassian.jira.mail.TemplateIssue_ which has the handy formating the *documentation alludes too*.\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\n",

The reason why the reporter field needs a value is that this field is required. When you check the retain option, the reporters are retained where possible. Depending on your configuration this may not be the case for all issues being moved. For those issue a new (reporter) value needs to be set and that's why the reporter field needs a value set.\n\nJIRA could be a bit smarter & user-friendlier and not require a value in the case when all issues will be able to retain the original reporter. It could also inform the user that if the value is entered and _retain_ option is checked, it will only replace or set the reporter value for the issues that will require it. It would seem that at the moment the current message does not give enough confidence to the users, they fear that all values will be replaced.\n\nPlease see linked JRA-14385 for more details about the origin of this issue.",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-15128].\n  {panel}\n\nThis issue just jammed me up and I think it's a terrible UI design to include the \"Screens\" operation under \"View Field Configuration\" when that operation applies to ALL field configurations across all schemes without any warning.  We're using the Enterprise Edition and setup a number of unique projects and configurations and I was shocked to find out that in the process of removing screens from one of my configurations that I had copied that I disabled functionality in my other projects.\n\nIn my example I had the following setup:\n------------\nField Configuration Schemes:\n\t- Issue Reporting 1 --> Project 1\n\t- Issue Reporting 2 --> Project 2\n\nField Configuration:\n\t- Issue Screen 1\n\t- Issue Screen 2\n\nScreens:\n\t- Enter Issue 1 --> Project 1\n\t- Assign Issue 1 --> Project 1\n\t- Enter Issue 2 --> Project 2\n\t- Assign Issue 2 --> Project 2\n\nField Configuration Issue Screen 1:\n\t- Assignee -->\n\t\t- Enter Issue 1\n\t\t- Assign Issue 1\n\t\t- Enter Issue 2\n\t\t- Assign Issue 2\n\n\t- Description -->\n\t\t- Enter Issue 1\n\t\t- Assign Issue 1\n\t\t- Enter Issue 2\n\t\t- Assign Issue 2\n\nField Configuration Issue Screen 2 (copied of Issue Screen 1):\n\t- Assignee -->\n\t\t- Enter Issue 1\n\t\t- Assign Issue 1\n\t\t- Enter Issue 2\n\t\t- Assign Issue 2\n\n\t- Description -->\n\t\t- Enter Issue 1\n\t\t- Assign Issue 1\n\t\t- Enter Issue 2\n\t\t- Assign Issue 2\t\t\n------------\n\nI then went and removed the Assignee and Description from the \"Enter Issue 1\" and \"Assign Issue 1\" screens in \"Field Configuration Issue Screen 2\" and ended up losing all those fields in \"Project 1\" which uses \"Enter Issue 1\" and \"Assign Issue 1\".  Had I seen some sort of warning in bold-red font that I was about to change ALL of my projects, or better yet -- if this action was not even permitted here, I would have never done this.  Putting a note in the documentation is not good enough, you need to have a warning in the UI because it's definitely not clear that you're changing all your projects..... why bother to have separate configuration areas if it's going to affect everything?  The only thing you see on the \"Associate field XXXXXX to screens\" page is:   \"Associate the field XXXXXX to the appropriate screens. You must associate a field to a screen before it will be displayed. New fields will be added to the end of a tab.\"  No warning at all....\n\nTo me it sounds like this UI works good for the non- Enterprise Edition of Jira, which does not allow multiple Field Configurations, and it was just left as is for the Enterprise Edition where it's definitely not sufficient.",

This project will involve many outside consultants and internal staff.  I can use roles for permissions, and I can create the following issue security levels based on the roles we have - a sampling could be\n         Omniware Internal\n         Sales\n         Network Admin\n         External Gui\n         External Web Services\n         External Developers\n\nThis allows me to create issues for Sales people only that NetworkAdmins can not view.\n\nIf I want to assign an issue that both the Sales and Network Admin roles can see (e.g. a task relating to a product install at a client site), I would then need to create another security level for Sales_and_Network.  \n\nSo, if I have 5 levels representing 5 types of 'employees/security levels', I need to create 5 factorial (120!) levels to allow for all the different combinations.  \n\nInstead, I would prefer to simply select multiple security levels for an issue, i.e. \"Allow the Sales and Network Admin levels to view this issue\"\n",

The information is buried within the page and not very distinct. \nIt's somewhat hard in both issue navigator and issue page. When one has to review issues quickly, just the status column doesn't always provide enough distinction.\n\n2. Users often don't notice the comments at the bottom of the page, b/c issue w/o comments doesn't differ enough from the issue with comments.\n\nI attached two screenshots: first one w/o any comments and the second one with one comment. I noticed over and over that people often don't notice that the comment is present in the second case, b/c they're used to some text in the comments section by default. \n",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-14696].\n  {panel}\n\nHi guys,\n\nLet me share some pain :)\n\nWhile scheduled backups go to JIRA backup directory specified in JIRA settings, all backup operations lauched by hand store backups in a different place (e.g. c:\\windows\\system32 - I assume it's the current dir of the JIRA service. See attached screenshot). To place a backup in other dir, admin always has to enter the destination path by hand; if there are some sequential changes pending assuming a series of backups, this may drive one nuts (especially if there's a typo and the backup file is lost somewhere in the filesystem). \n\nI'd say a preferable way would be to store backups always in the same dir - this will reduce the amount of typing to backup filename (i.e. if only filename is entered, the file goes to JIRA Backup Dir). Current implementation is so inconvenient that I prefer to RDC to the JIRA host, open JIRA in browser there, browse filesystem for the backup path and then copy/paste it into the backup UI field.\n\nIMHO this thing may save lots of nerve. Thanks for your time.\n\nThanks,\n~Nick",

Confirmation \nthis step changes only in that regard that after completion u are returned to the page of \"choose issues\".\nthis shows the initial view from step 1 but it has kept the state of the column \"bulk change tags\". the tag that got just completed has been removed though from all those issues.\neg. when i just made the bulk change for A then the tag A is remove from all the TBs.\nhowever it could be an option on the confirmation page to either remove the tag for the just executed bulk op or leave it, as there are also cases that for the same set of issues u have to do >1 bulk ops.\n\n\nPS: i set the priority to critical as this would greatly boost management efficiency of issues in jira",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-14588].\n  {panel}\n\nHowever, 12241 is looking at a deeper issue, in that the JIRA tracking system is rather flat, and does not contain a lot of functionality for organizing the 'project level' within the system. As well, organization by product is an imporant idea.\n\nThis is what I need to do. Currently, I\"m trying to use categories to do this, as well as the 'key' in issues, so I may have several categories representing our products:\n\nPPM\nEPM\nSPM, etc.\n\nThe key will then correspond to that, so I can see issues by product:\n\nPPM - 001\n\nHowever, this is a major workaround.\n\nThere may be a few things to consider, such as:\n\n1. Ability to have custom fields on the project itself that allows you not not only filter by issues, but also by project. As many have stated in the other three issues you listed, there may be multiple PROJECTS for a PRODUCT. At least providing a way to filter by attributes on a project could help with this, as you can say, for example, \"show me all my projects for this product\". You can't do that right now, except through maybe a category, but, again, you can't actually create a filter on that. It only shows up on the dashboard - not very helpful for reporting.\n\n2. The other issue is that there are times when a project itself may need to be broken down into smaller 'sub-projects' that then will collect their own set of issues. This is getting more into actual project management, which Planview does.\n\nMy problem I'm having here is that internally we are trying to implement our own tool, and use it in conjunction with JIRA. One of the problems is that the level of detail we want to collect issue information is at a level lower than the project....in our terminology, a 'phase' level, or possibly even the 'task' level.\n\nProject\nPhase\nTask\n\nThe ability to be able to bring more detail into the system would be very helpful. For instance, we could import into JIRA the work breakdown structure for a project down to the level in which we want to collect issue information, and be able to roll that all the way to the project.\n\nIn the example above, import down to the Task level. Issues would be attached to the Task.\n\n3. Another problem I see that people may be having is the ability to relate multiple projects to a particular version. Again, this gets back to #1 above, in that projects need to be able to have attributes on their own, outside of issues. So, you can create a filter that show you:\n\n\"show me all my projects for Version 10.x\".\n\nYou can't do that right now because projects don't have attributes, except for category, and you can't create views based on project, only on issue.\n\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nThe other thing I was talking about was to have custom fields on projects, with the ability to create filters on projects, NOT just issues. People want to see, by PROJECT, not by ISSUE, what is happening for a version. You can't do that right now, because you can't create a view on projects. You can only see, by version, project information for a single project at a time.\n\nSo, what that means is, in your filtering functionality, a user could not only create a filter to see issues, based on values within fields for those issues, but also create filters to see projects. I know this is a bigger change, but it looks to me like others are asking for it.\n\nThe other limiting thing I see, which others are also running into, is your 3 level 'hierarchy'. It really isn't a 'hierarchy' per se, and it doesn't take into account complex project structures.\n\nUnfortunately, JIRA is using the term 'project', and requiring that issues come off of projects, instead of just having issues and sub issues, and using fields/attributes to categorize them. When you start using the word 'project', and requiring that issues become part of a project, you begin to move toward the idea of project management, and all the overhead that comes with that.\n\nAs a project management system, JIRA, personal opinion, is not ready for. As an issue tracking system it has very good functionality. I'm running into problems with being forced to tie issues to this 'project' level, when I personally think that the idea of a 'project' is not necessary in this system - even though there is rudimentary time reporting. You want to have this, then you need to support more levels than 3 in your 'project' hierarchy.",

Its default value, false, would keep the current behavior, that is to say, set the issue's last updated timestamp to *now*.\n\nThanks,\nNicolas.",

We highly value your feedback in all forms, and through suggestions in jira.atlassian.com is not different. We use this channel often to learn the best we can with how customers use JIRA and how we can continue to improve the experience for as many users as possible.\r\n\r\nWe have revisited this issue again recently and wanted to reiterate that there are still currently no plans to implement this suggestion, and it is not currently on any JIRA team\u2019s roadmap at this stage. That said, we'll be investigating improving our emails and notifications in the future, so please keep an eye out for these changes when we find an opportunity to prioritise this.\r\n\r\nPlease remember that jira.atlassian.com is one of many inputs for the JIRA roadmap. You can [learn more about our process here|https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/110373/how-does-the-jira-team-use-jira-atlassian-com].\r\n\r\nI understand that our decision may be disappointing.

It would be great if we can provide a new plugin module type (e.g. sub-task tab panel plugin module) to enable the user creates their own sub-task tab panel in an issue. \n\nThis could be something similar to 'Issue Tab Panel Plugin Module' which described at the JIRA Plugin Guide:\n* http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/JIRA+Plugin+Guide",

Since the defacto standard in Japan is A4 paper size, please advise how we can change this setting either during the build or via user configuration.\n\nregards,\n\nNeeraj",
