Having many customers establish mailing subdomains to get mail sent from your system to deliver properly seems much more intrusive than having an alternate name set to offer to solve this issue.\r\n\r\nBasically, What I am asking is if you would consider adding an alias to the existing record providing 2 options for what a customer can set in their DKIM DNS entries to point to to validate the signature. Ideally, if you added something like s3._domainkey.atlassian.net CNAME to s1._domainkey.atlassian.net and s4 to s2. That should resolve the existing conflict with sendgrid entries that are required to properly deliver Pagerduty and other service emails. Maybe that change would break validation in the DKIM verification chain but it doesn\u2019t seem like it would. It should also not affect anyone using current settings or configurations",

We have an issue with the attachments uploaded to a Jira issue. The attachments uploaded to a Jira issue generate three webhook events - _issueupdated_, _commentcreated_ (in the case of public attachment) and _attachmentcreated_. In our implementation scenario, we are integrating with Salesforce and the requirement is to only bring the public attachments from Jira to Salesforce. As we understand from the webhook behavior, if an attachment is public, it will have a corresponding public comment created.\r\n\r\nh3. Problem\r\nThe three webhook events are independent of each other and are not correlated.\r\nThe _commentcreated_ webhook event has only the attachment name and no other attachment metadata. So I cannot get the attachment id from _commentcreated_ webhook to perform a subsequent get attachment details API call to get the attachment link.\r\n\r\nThe _attachmentcreated_ webhook event has only attachment details like id and link but does not have visibility details. It does not have the comment id to which it is associated and hence we are not able to get the visibility of the attachment based on which comment it is associated with.\r\n\r\nThe _issueupdated_ webhook event does not provide any attachment detail or comment detail or any other detail correlating the attachment and the comment to which it is associated with.\r\n\r\nh3.

When it is set in a status in the workflow, the Clone option is removed from the issues.\r\n\r\nHowever, this is also removing the button to create Subtasks in the new issue view.\r\nh3.

Problem Definition\r\n\r\nThere are several documented REST API endpoints regarding being able to make changes to workflows documented such as\r\n * [https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/v3/?utm_source=%2Fcloud%2Fjira%2Fplatform%2Frest%2F&utm_medium=302#api-group-Workflows]\r\n * [https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/v3/?utm_source=%2Fcloud%2Fjira%2Fplatform%2Frest%2F&utm_medium=302#api-rest-api-3-workflow-transitions-transitionId-properties-put]\r\n * and several other endpoints\r\n\r\nHowever frequently it is documented that:\r\n{quote}Note that active workflow schemes cannot be edited.\r\n{quote}\r\nFor example [Set workflow for issue type in workflow scheme PUT /rest/api/3/workflowscheme/\\{id}/issuetype/\\{issueType}|https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/v3/?utm_source=%2Fcloud%2Fjira%2Fplatform%2Frest%2F&utm_medium=302#api-rest-api-3-workflowscheme-id-issuetype-issueType-put]\r\n\r\nSo while you can make changes to workflows via the REST API, you can only do this to inactive workflows and drafts. Further complicating the problem here is that there is no mechanism currently to activate AND/OR publish that workflow so that these changes can actually take effect via REST. \r\n Users have to currently login to Jira's web interface and publish/activate these changes.\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nThe REST API should have some means to activate inactive workflows, and publish workflow drafts.\r\nh3. Why this is important\r\n\r\nFor the sake of ecosystem integrations that want to be able to make changes to workflows, this is an important ability.\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nCurrently users have to login to the web interface of Jira as an admin in order to activate or publish these workflow changes so that they can take affect.",

The original support person (SP) makes minor corrections to the description (UD).\r\nThe actual result is:\r\nA. The history shows AM updated the description from OD to ND.\r\nB. The history makes it appear like SP reverted the entire description from ND to UD, when in the UI it had actually only experienced a minor change from OD to UD.\r\nThe expected result is:\r\nA. The history should show the actual updates that occurred - from original content to revised content. If it's only a minor update, the history should reflect that fact. Such a minor update could be (manually?) applied to a brand new (replacement) description.\r\nSome possible ways this could be improved:\r\nA. A locking mechanism, preventing the description from being updated if another user is actively updating the description. This would presumably be easier that implementing locking for all fields in the issue.\r\nB. Notification of current updates, when the second update is saved. In this case, both descriptions could even be displayed with an option to select which to keep - the one already saved vs. the one currently attempted to be saved.\r\n\r\n",

There are some Squad options that we've disabled in the custom field default context and although those options are correctly disabled in the Jira Old View, however, they remain enabled in the JIRA New View.\r\nh3.

Expected Results\r\n\r\nWhen selecting the custom field options and checking the cascade options, the cascade options that I've disabled is not appearing on the drop-down list using the *new issue view*.\r\nh3.
