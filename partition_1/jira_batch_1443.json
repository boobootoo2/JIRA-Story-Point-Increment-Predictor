So I have to match on more than just one character.\r\n\r\nThird problem - if the filter string includes portions of my company's URL (since it is present in all the email addresses) then it matches on all of those too.  Since my company has a \"ro\" in it, I can't use \"ro\" to match roger, rose, etc.  So I increase the count of letters in the filter until all I match is 1 user per filter.  Then I add the user.\r\n\r\nFourth problem - every time I add a user from the Add Users page it exits right out, so I have to re-click on the Add Users button every time.\r\n\r\nFifth problem - the Add Users button is at the bottom of the member list, so as the member list gets bigger and bigger, the button gets pushed down more and more until it gets scrolled off the visible page and I have to scroll it back into view to be able to select it.\r\n\r\nMy overall impression is that this screen is so badly implemented that I might as well just be adding users one by one.
