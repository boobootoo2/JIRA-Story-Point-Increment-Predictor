[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-10638].\n  {panel}\n\nJRA-10205 was reported regarding the displaying of issue summary, reported and assignee, type and status on certain issue operations when not logged in. For 3.6.3 the solutions was to simply throw an IssuePermissionException when the user doesn't have Browse Issue permission for that issue. Please see that issue for a description of how it was done and what files were touched.\n\nHowever, it was noted that there were at least four different ways the Issue actions might report this to the user.\n# Custom handling in the operation view. Creates a very nice error page with the operation, and friendly error message - http://server/jira/secure/AddComment!default.jspa?id=12345\n# \"You are not logged in\" message with standard Jira banner, user gets redirected to permission-violation page (permissionviolation.jsp), not so friendly, but the user gets the point - http://server/jira/secure/ViewIssue.jspa?id=12345 (note, this page has trackback info)\n# \"Access Denied\" message with big red background, user gets redirected to security-breach page (securitybreach.jsp) with standard Jira banner, not so friendly big red message, user still gets the point - http://server/jira/secure/attachment/12345/logs_jira-int_11_03_2005.txt or the ViewVoters or ManageWatchers urls (no trackback info). \n# 500 page catches IssuePermissionException, very, very unfriendly message, lots of nasty logging.\n\n{note}all the Admin pages use the securitybreach.jsp{note}\n\nThese need to be standardised so all access denied reports are the same, and it is not possible to view any secure information if you do not have that permission.\n\nWhile researching JRA-10205 the following was noted:\n- IssuePermissionException is handled inconsistently. We need to either throw it from our Action.doValidate(), Action.doExecute() & Action.doDefault() methods or handle it in a consistent manner.\n- We probably should handle the standard case in the framework. AbstractIssueSelectAction holds the issueObject, and should be able to handle 99% of the code paths. Attached is a version that does the 99% (doesn't handle the trackback case)\n- We could further generify the issue handling of Actions by having them implement some kind of IssueAware interface and have an interceptor of the filter stack read the request parameters and insert the Issue into the action. This could also have a PermissionException injector method as well if the user cannot see an issue. (Please ask Scott for further information, as this is his idea).\n- The trackback info is the wrinkle edge-case, we do actually have to provide some issue info in the trackback rdf if enabled.\n\nFinal caveat: The permission error page actually DOES HAVE TO HAVE the issue summary in it (if incoming trackbacks are turned on) in the trackback RDF. This currently works if the permissionviolation.jsp is the result (which it is for ViewIssue). We probably need to have a separate TrackbackIssueInfo object that the Issue can give us that is filtered through a trackback policy filter. Then we can have a trackback policy for enabling/disabling trackbacks based on their security (for instance allow trackbacks for public issues only, rinse issue summary from non public issues etc.)",

This way they can hide the not-so-common filter items. They requested if it is possible for the admin to set the default collapsed and expanded groups.\n\nJira does seem to save which groups are expanded/collapsed by an individual user, but by default all groups are expanded by default.

Your feedback is key to helping us understand how you use JIRA so we can continue improving your experience. We have reviewed this issue over the last few days; unfortunately we don't have any plans to support this in JIRA for the foreseeable future.\n\nPlease remember that jira.atlassian.com is one of many inputs for the JIRA roadmap. You can [learn more about our process here|https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/110373/how-does-the-jira-team-use-jira-atlassian-com].\n \nI understand that our decision may be disappointing. Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.\n \nRegards,\nDave Meyer\ndmeyer@atlassian.com\nProduct Manager, JIRA Platform\n{panel}\n\n*Original request description*\n \nI use the project components very heavily for issue list filtering and rely on them for building out lists in Confluence using the {jiraissue} macro.\n \nIn order to preserve those lists, I have to keep the component around, unfortunately, many times I don't necessarily need it for future work. So I don't want to present the developers with the component if it doesn't really apply to work anymore.\n \nIt would be great if there was a mechanism to \"archive\" components just like you would with a release version, such that the user can no longer select that component for issues.",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-10333].\n  {panel}\n\nWe have extended yours jira-rpc-plugin with possibility to   retrieving issue change history (see: http://jira.atlassian.com/  browse/JRA-9533) and because of that I have a question. It is   possible to include our changes in offical plugin release? It   will be a great benefit for possible customers not to install our   custom version of this plugin, but the original one. If it will   be possible, could you please contact me with a person to whom I   may send plugin source code changes. \n\nBest Regards,\nRobert Sermak\nParasoft Corp.\nwww.parasoft.com\n\nHi Robert,\n\nThanks for offering to contribute! Just send your changes to me,   and I'll forward them on to the JIRA team so that they can look   over them. Hopefully we'll be able  to get them into the RPC   plugin soon. \n\nCheers,\nJonathan\n\n\nHello Jonathan,\n\nAs I promised in attachment you can find changed version of rpc-  plugin and diff file. So, now with this changes new method is available in soap   interface: getChangeHistory, also two new beans has been introduced: RemoteChangeHistory and   RemoteChangeItem (take a look below for full list of changes or to attached diff file). Sad information   is that I've made only necessary changes from our point of view.   So, I did not add any unit tests and I did not change any part of   code responsible for xml-rpc. There is one thing more, because I   did not write any Jira plugin before, and I do not know Jira code very well I strongly recommend that someone   should review my changes before including them in main branch. Especially  I'm not sure  if   I have included all necessary fields in RemoteChangeHistory and in RemoteChangeItem bean. \n\nFinally, we'd really appreciate if someone let us know (if it is   not a problem of course) when we may expect official plugin   release. Thank you very much for all. \n\nBest Regards,\nRobert Sermak\nParasoft Corp.\nwww.parasoft.com\n",

From a user:\n\n{quote}\nWhat i had trouble with tho was not the velocity side as it is relatively straight forward, but more so the fact that i had no idea what classes i had access to from within the velocity template, or how to add classes (infact i didn't even know you could add classes).\n\nOnce i got over that hurdle, it was just a matter of finding the relevant classes to pass to the release notes in the jira api, so i could gain acces to each issues linked issues.\n\nI think that some documentation could be added to this affect. ie what classes are initially available to the release notes templates. As well as how to add more classes to this list (through the method getTemplateVariables in ReleaseNoteManager)\nAnother issue, which fortunately i didn't come up against as we have the enterprise edition of jira so was able to get the source code for the ReleasenotesManager, edit it, recompile and replace the existing ReleaseNoteManager class file. But if i didn't have enterprise and didn't have access to the source, how would have i gone about this?\n\nAnyway that just my 2cents on a few things that would have helped me out greatly to avoid the issues that i had. (Judging by the number of views that this thread has had i am guessing i am not the only one who has come up against these issues also)\n\nCheers\nSam\n{quote}",

However, if these are resolved, we often want to know the 'real' version in which they were resolved, which is where using 'fake versions' bites you.\n\nThis could be met by allowing another method of task categorization so that versions wouldn't be used at all; I'm not entirely averse to this approach.",
