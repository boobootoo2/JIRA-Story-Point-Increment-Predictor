[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-20616].\n  {panel}\n\nFor the last 4 months I been using JIRA a lot.  As JIRA bug master I have a \"reason\" to really use JIRA.  And the way it works affects the way I can work.\n\nI think JIRA needs a new feature.  Lets call them Lists.\n\nA JIRA List is simply a set issues that have be \"placed\" together into the list.  Simple as that.\n\nh2. Why Not Filters\nFilters are \"views\" on some data.  If the issue data has matching attributes, then it presented by the filter.  When it not longer\nhas matching attributes, its not.\n\nLists differ in that once an issue is added to the list, it stays there.  An issue's data attributes can change as much as you\nlike but they are still in the list.\n\nOne does have to ensure that the data stays stable with lists compared to filters.  If you have a filter looking for unresolved bugs in v3.13.3 and some one changes the version accidently, then its out of the filter.  But with a list the inclusion condition is that at one point it was added to the list.\n\nh2. Lists Are More Personal\nLists are more personal and/or more specific than filters.  If I create a list its because I have decided what needs to go into it.\n\nIts not data attributes but rather human reasoning that puts issues in lists.\n\nI figure having lists in JIRA will increase its \"social value\" in a sense.  A group of people can be sharing a list, and making group decisions about whats in it or not.\n\nTo this end lists should be shareable (like filters and dashboards) but also have an \"editable\" permisson.  Hence a list can be shared with a person/group/role and optionally have a \"editable\" flag also with that person/group/role.\n\nh2. Lists Are More Transient\n\nI can imagine lists being used in an Agile teams.\n\nFor example a \"weekly iteration\" can be a list, created at the start of the iteration.\n\nTime is logged against the issues in the \"iteration\" list.\n\nOne could imagine that lists may be able to \"add\" up the time logged against the issues in them.\n\nWhen the iteration ends, the list can be kept or discarded.\n\nUnfinished tasks can be put in another \"iteration\" list by \"dragging/copying\" a list (via UI checkbox selection).\n\nCompare this to a filter scenario.\n\nOne has to have a custom field called \"Iteration\" or use something like Lables.\n\nThe field needs to be set the same value in\nall of the issues.\n\nThe creator of the tasks/issues has to be responsible for getting the value right to include the issues in the filter.\n\nThen when the iteration is over, the issues need to re-edited top move them to the next iteration.  A lot of management overhead for a weeks list of tasks/issues, that are transient in nature.\n\nh2. Lists Are More Work Process Oriented\n\nSo while fitlers may tell you what things are candidates to be done, lists can be used to make a \"subset\" of work you planned to do.\n\nSo from the 100 bugs you could possibly do, imagine a list of the \"most important\", a list of the \"ones needing product management review\", the ones that \"you thought had been addressed before\", a  \"watch list\", a \"performance list\" and so on.\n\nSo you can use lists as a.... wait for it... a TODO list.\n\nFilters arent really TODO lists.  Once they get large that are a less useful for this function.\n\nI can imagine that issue sin the list have a DONE status or not WITHIN the list.\n\nSo JRA-1234 might be done in list X and not done in list Y.  Contrast this with filters where once a field value is changed (say resolved) its done in all filters.\n\nh2. Simple Features Of Lists\n\nA list is an arbitary set of issues.\nLists have names (editable at all times like filters)\nLists are shareable\nJust like filters and dashboards\nNeed an extra flag to idicate that those who can see the list can edit the list\nThey would also be \"favouritable\"\nAnywhere you see an issue key, you get a like to add it to a list\nIn the issue nav / issue view page / whereever\nA pop up that shows favourite list\nAlso the ability to start a new list at any time\nList would primarily be show in portlets\nIssues can be created from within the list context\nMuch like the sub task quick create\nList can be created from other lists\nThe user goes into copy mode and \"selects\" the issues to copy across\nMaybe copy to existing lists or create a new list\n\nh2. Extended Features Of Lists\n\n(These are less clear in my mind or are much harder)\nList are sortable inside themselves\nA bit like the issue navigator\nMaybe by a standard set of fields\nMaybe via a set of customizeable fields (like the issue nav)\nLists can be part of a project\nNo one owns it, the project does\nIts on the Browse Project page\nMay create issues in a project can edit the lists (maybe not)\nList would have a TODO nature for each issue in the list\nSo an issue in a list of DONE/NOT DONE in terms of that list\nPeople can \"check\" off the issues as done\nLists can be retrieved/created via REST/SOAP\nJQL could be used on a list\nSelect from list='list name' where x y z",

Usually people just have a few dashboards and thus there is just white space below the selection links. This white spaces scrambles the layout of the portlets on the right compared to the layout in JIRA3 where the portlets had more space on the screen. \n\nFor this reason there should be some way to switch to a horizontal dashboard selector or a popup selector that that preserves the layout of portlets. This would increase acceptance of JIRA 4 in our organization.\n\nBest regards\nDieter\n\n",

However, there are other applications that use this information and present it to the end customer. For instance, the confluence jiraissue macro uses the XML view to present the data in the Confluence page. That results in a macro that only shows the user id, which most of the times is not meaningful to the end user.\n\nI would be good if the customfieldvalue could be improved to return userid, username, and user profile url, so the macro could present more meaningful view to the end user.\n\nOf course, this should not break backwards compatibility of the XML view.",

My company uses a standard employee id to use for the JIRA username. With little knowledge, I designed a script that can cycle through employee id numbers and submit them to the reset password form. This process can repeat through an entire list of associate employee id numbers.\n\nI am in the IT Security department so my research was more of a proof of concept, however, the script could be written by anyone. This causes an annoyance for users, and could potentially hinder the performance of the JIRA server (which we are running in a VM) and might even impact our MS Exchange servers which have to process all password reset confirmation emails.\n\nThe password reset prompt should be able to share the CAPTCHA functionality that the JIRA admin can enable for the account sign-up form.

List browser sizes should be configurable for e.g. \"Create issue\" screen, allowing them to be bigger - this would be a simple change, but make things much, much better than currently (only seeing 5 items is just not usable, I'd like 10-15 - having this per-user configurable would be one option).\n\n2. Add some more sophisticated search facility that doesn't just to prefix searching, but does full string matching and restricts the displayed results, similar to how iTunes/Spotlight searches work \n\n3. Some sort of favorite history with a separate checkbox to \"show all\" for the list, with the ability to hide things over time - e.g. I'd only work with very few releases at a given point in time, although there may be a fair amount of historical releases that are still active out at customer sites and thus displayed\n\nThe main problem though, is really that the large UI workflow stumble-block, is to find the right item in these lists which can be long (we have the same problem with our \"Customer\" list where we assign which customer a case affects). Just as a reference, it took me probably 30-60 seconds just to find the right component to file this case for, as I had to slowly scroll through the list.\n\n\n",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-19937].\n  {panel}\n\nHi,\n\nFrom the following documentation:\nhttp://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA03x/Changing+Custom+Field+Types\n\nbq.When moving back from a multi select list a select list, you have to make sure that only one item is selected for each multi select list.\n\nI think you should change this sentence above to:\n\nWhen moving back from Multi Select List to a Select List, you have to remove the default value of the Multi Select. In addition to that, please make sure that no issue that has multiple Multi Select List values. Otherwise,  the issue will have no Select List value after conversion. The following error will occured during issue creation if the Multi Select List has default value before conversion:\n{noformat}\n...\njava.lang.ClassCastException: java.util.ArrayList cannot be cast to java.lang.String\nat com.atlassian.jira.issue.customfields.impl.StringCFType.getObjectFromDbValue(StringCFType.java:25)\n...\n{noformat}\n\nThe solution for this error is to delete the default value of the Multi Select List by hacking the database directly:\n{noformat}\ndelete from genericconfiguration where ID=<value_of_your_multi_select_default_value>;\n{noformat}\n\nIf you are not sure which ID, you could do  a select query and look for the XMLVALUE column where you can spot the default value:\n{noformat}\nselect * from genericconfiguration;\n{noformat}\n\nRestart your JIRA for the changes to take effect.\n\n\nDo not hesitate to let me know if you need more description.\n\nCheers,\nJanet\n",
