Summary\r\nWhen the user uses the JIRA Issue Calendar gadget, provided by the JIRA Calendar Plugin, it's possible to have a timezone unconformity when configuring the gadget with a DateField {{portlet.issuescalendar.field.dateFieldName.name}} set with the *Created* or *Updated* fields. These fields record timezone related information, and the gadget uses the JIRA`s Server system timezone instead of the Default user timezone or the User Preference Timezone (set by the user on his profile configuration). This is a problem when the JIRA's server system timezone is enough hours ahead of the user profile timezone that makes a few issues created on a specific day appear on the next day slot on the JIRA Issue Calendar gadget.\r\n\r\nI.e.: JIRA's server system timezone: GMT and the User profile preference timezone: GMT -8. The user created an issue on October 3rd around 6PM PST, but the gadget shows the issue on the October 4th slot at 2AM since it adjusts to the server time instead of the user preference time.\r\n\r\nDate fields that have no time component, such as *due dates*, release dates (associated with versions) and custom date fields, solely record date information (and no time zone-related information) so are not affected by time zone settings. So if the gadget is configured to use the *due date* field, the issues appear using the user profile preference timezone correctly.\r\n\r\nh3. Problem\r\n\r\nIf JIRA's server system timezone is enough hours ahead of the user profile timezone that makes a few issues created on a specific day appear on the next day slot on the JIRA Issue Calendar gadget when the gadget is configured to use the Created or Updates DateFields.\r\n\r\nh3.

Workaround\r\n\r\n- If it's possible, configure the gadget using the *due date* DateField configuration instead of any other field, and then configure JIRA user default timezone and the JIRA Profile Preferences timezone (for each user) to Los Angeles. The gadget will behave correctly.\r\n\r\n- Or, if it's possible, the user can set the timezone for the Java environment on the setenv.sh file, forcing the system to use this timezone instead of the JIRA's server system timezone, although a few other problems might appear so be careful when changing this configuration.\r\n\r\nhttps://confluence.atlassian.com/kb/setting-the-timezone-for-the-java-environment-841187402.html\r\n",

Step to reproduce\r\n\r\n# In Jira, grant only \"Browse Projects\" to a specific user/group/role, so that the user can view the projects and the issues within them, but cannot create issues;\r\n# In Confluence, go to Spaces Menu and click on \"Create space\";\r\n# Select \"Software project space\" and click on Next;\r\n\r\nh4. Expected Result\r\n\r\nUser is able to see the projects as they do in JIRA and then creates the related Space in Confluence.\r\n\r\nh4. Actual Result\r\n\r\nThe Project is not listed in Confluence, even though the user can browse it in JIRA.\r\n\r\nIn order to have the project shown up in Confluence, user must have \"Create Issues\" or \"Work On Issues\" permission in JIRA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe problem is that some users might not edit information in a Project because of security reasons, but they can be responsible for creating the Software Project Space in Confluence.",

Summary\r\n\r\n(i) This issue has the same context and root cause as JRASERVER-44588 : Multi Select Custom Field loads options in a suboptimal way, but describes a different performance implication. JRASERVER-44588 discusses REST and DB performance on the JIRA server backend. This describes browser frontend performance.\r\n\r\nIn an environment which has a *Multi Select Custom Field* with very many options (at least 1000, but performance implications are more visible at larger numbers, such as 10,000), if said custom field is added to the *Create Issue* screen for a project, it is possible for the *Create Issue* popup dialog to become unresponsive when switching projects *from* said project associated with the custom field, to a different project.\r\nh3. Environment\r\n\r\n(!) Performance seems to be substantially worse in Google Chrome than in Firefox. (~17 seconds in Chrome vs ~2 seconds in Firefox in a fresh environment with a Multi Select Custom Field with 10,000 options)\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Create a new *Select List (multiple choice)* custom field\r\n # Add at least 1000 options, but recommended 10000 options to the field\r\n # Associate the custom field to at least one project's *Create Issue* screen\r\n # Navigate to a Dashboard\r\n # Click the *Create* button at the top of JIRA to bring up the *Create Issue* popup box\r\n # If not currently on a project with the custom field on it's Create Issue screen, change to one of those projects first.\r\n # Change projects away from the project associated with the custom field\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nThere will be no unresponsiveness, and the projects can be switched within a short period of time.\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nThe browser will be unresponsive while scripting is occurring,\u00a0with the duration depending on the number of options being loaded and the performance of the browser's physical machine.\r\n\r\nSee [^JRASERVER-66086.mp4] for a demonstration of unresponsiveness in Google Chrome, along with Chrome's Performance Profiler results.\r\nh3. Notes\r\n\r\nThe performance issue does not occur if trying to create an issue via *{{$JIRA_URL/secure/CreateIssue!default.jspa}}*; only when using the popup window (i.e. when creating an issue from a Dashboard).\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nUse Firefox, as the performance issue appears to be either much less significant, or outright nonexistent.",

It exceeds the allowed limit of 255 characters.` message.\r\n\r\n(i) This means, URLs longer than 255 characters are rejected by the GUI before JIRA attempts to write them to the database.\r\n\r\nh3. +Other Workarounds+\r\nInstead of URL field, considering using the followings:\r\n# Web Link, from More -> Link (this field is always Optional)\r\n# A multi-line Text field, which supports unlimited text, link rendering (via Wiki Style Render) and can be set as Required in Field Configurations\r\n",

      "description": "h3. Summary\r\n\r\nWhen creating tickets/comments in JIRA via email, if an attachment is added to the email processed by JIRA, this attachment is added to the created/commented ticket as well.\r\n\r\nFor most attachment types, this is not a problem, but PDFs are failing to be previewed in the issue when added this way when using a Gmail account (not tested in others) as Email Server accessed by JIRA (not the user's source email).\r\n\r\nThis is happening because JIRA registered the \u2018mime type\u2019 for attachments in the \u2018fileattachment\u2019 table. All attachments added by email have a mime type in uppercase for some reason. \r\n\r\nFor most attachments, this is not a problem, but JIRA is not able to preview PDFs with uppercase in mime type.\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Environment\r\nThis was only tested with Gmail in external emails.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Create a test Gmail account\r\n# Create an Email Server connecting to the Gmail account and a handler to process the emails and create comments\r\n# Send an email message with a PDF attached to the Gmail account to either create a new ticket or comment and existing one\r\n# Navigate to the issue and click the PDF attachment\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nThe issue created/commented has a PDF attachment that when clicked previews the PDF in the browser (doesn\u2019t download it).\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nThe PDF attachment is not identified as PDF, cannot be previewed and when clicked causes the file to be downloaded, not previewed.\r\n \r\nh3. Notes\r\nHere\u2019s is the difference between a PDF added via email and added in the UI:\r\n{code:sql}\r\njira=# select * from fileattachment where issueid in (select jiraissue.id from jiraissue join project on jiraissue.project = project.id where project.pkey = 'TP' and jiraissue.issuenum = 1);\r\n   id | issueid | mimetype | filename | created | filesize | author | zip | thumbnailable \r\n------+---------+-----------------+--------------------------------+----------------------------+----------+----------+-----+---------------\r\n10004 |   10000 | application/pdf | pdf_added_in_ui.pdf            | 2016-01-27 19:45:09.801-02 |    20597 | sysadmin |     |             0\r\n10002 |   10000 | APPLICATION/PDF | pdf-attached_email.pdf         | 2016-01-27 19:30:41.117-02 |    20597 | admin    |     |             0\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nThe first one can be previewed when clicked, while the second one when clicked in the issue is downloaded. \r\n\r\nAlso, if you take a PDF that is working (can be preview and its mime type is in lowercase in the database) and change the mime type to uppercase and re-index JIRA, this PDF will have the same problem as the ones added by email. This shows that indeed the uppercase is what prevents these attachments from being previewed.\r\n\r\nh3.Workaround\r\nNone so far.",

Problem Definition\r\n\r\nWhen there is a LDAP directory with local group where the group in internal directory does not exist in LDAP, JIRA will synchronize the group to the LDAP. If the LDAP admin creates a new group with the same name in LDAP, JIRA will not create a new entry in cwd_group table which could prevent users in group from being synchronized.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to reproduce:\r\n\r\n# Create a group in Internal Directory.\r\n# Create a LDAP connection with \"Read only, Local group\" option\r\n# Add a user from LDAP to the new group.\r\n# Perform full synchronization.\r\n# Create a new group in LDAP with the identical name.\r\n# Try to add a user to the same group again.\r\n\r\nProblem mainly happens because there will be 2 entries in the cwd_group:\r\n\r\n{code}\r\n10362;\"atl04\";\"atl04\";1;1;\"2017-09-25 15:55:38.685+00\";\"2017-09-25 15:55:38.685+00\";\"\";\"\";\"GROUP\";10101\r\n10363;\"atl04\";\"atl04\";1;0;\"2017-09-25 15:55:38.715+00\";\"2017-09-25 15:55:38.715+00\";\"\";\"\";\"GROUP\";1\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nWe can see that there are 2 entries for the *atl04* group where the top entry from LDAP shows that the group is not a local group and added from LDAP directly. Since the LDAP is configured with \"Read only, local group\", adding user to the group will fail since JIRA will try to connect to LDAP to add the user in LDAP group rather than adding to the local group. \r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Result:\r\n\r\nThe Group Members from the LDAP side would be sync to JIRA.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Result:\r\n\r\nThe Group Members are not synced as the member of the group.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround \r\n\r\nIf user is using the \"Read only, local group\" option, updating the *local* entry from 1 to 0 will allow the user to be able to added to the local user.\r\n\r\nEg based on the query above:\r\n\r\n{code}\r\nupdate cwd_group set local = '0' where ID = 'ID of the group';\r\n{code}",

(See below additional notes section)\r\n\r\n * It also generates inconsistencies in the JIRA UI as the user will be displayed in the Project Settings --> Users and roles view (http://<HOST>:<PORT>/plugins/servlet/project-config/<PROJECTKEY>/roles) however it will not be possible to delete it.\r\n ** The only user that will be possible to delete from the JIRA UI will be the one that has the proper user name in lower case in the {{PROJECTROLEACTOR}} table.

Expected Results\r\n\r\nJIRA should either\r\n * Recognise user regardless of the text case and then the {{lower_user_name}} should be inserted into the {{PROJECTROLEACTOR}} table.\r\n * Deny adding 'non-valid' users to a project role\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n * JIRA inserts the received username into {{PROJECTROLEACTOR}} table without converting to the internal data representation ('lower_user_name').\r\n ** For each new variation of mixed-case username new user is added to the project roles.\r\n\r\nh3. Additional Notes\r\nh4. JIRA UI\r\n\r\nIf the user is added with a different text case than the respective username in lower case then\r\n * multiple rows for the same users will be shown in table view\r\n * it will be no possible to be deleted all those duplicated users\r\n See screenshot below.\r\n !projectroleactor_ui.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nh4.
