Expected Behavior\r\nFully support all operands provided by SimpleDateFormat in Java 8.\r\n[http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html]\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Behavior\r\nThe {{u}} operand cannot be parsed, even though it's accepted as valid. In the logs, we can see an {{InvalidArgumentException}}.\r\n\r\n{noformat}\r\n2016-04-05 12:56:15,382 http-nio-8710-exec-8 ERROR admin 776x101x1 1u66v39 0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1 / [c.a.j.plugin.navigation.HeaderFooterRendering] Unable to include web panel in context 'atl.header.after.scripts' from class 'com.atlassian.plugin.web.descriptors.DefaultWebPanelModuleDescriptor.ContextAwareWebPanel' because of 'java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Illegal pattern component: u'\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\n{quote}\r\nh5. Suggested theory\r\n\r\nTomcat 8 is bundled since JIRA 7, and we are only supporting Java 8 on these versions. However, Tomcat 8 uses the Servlet 3.1 API, which is part of Java EE 7. [SimpleDateFormat on Java 7|http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html] has {{E}} for day of week names and {{F}} for day of week numbers.\r\n\r\n[SimpleDateFormat on Java 8|http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html] changed some operands, including the replacement of {{F}} with {{u}}, so JIRA will not accept the input of {{F}} as an operand when setting up date formats, but will take {{u}}.\r\n\r\nWhen trying to parse the header and footer of the page (see error above), JIRA takes a {{HttpServletRequest}} object, which is a class from the Servlet 3.1 API. This obviously leads to an inconsistency, where a Java 7-based class cannot understand the {{u}} operand when parsing the date.\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\nUnder *Administration > System > Look and feel*, setup any date format to use {{u}} as one of the operands.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\nAs of now, there's no guaranteed workaround other than opting for other operand (such as {{E}}, parsing to the name of the weekday), supported by SimpleDateFormat on both Java 7 and 8.\r\n\r\nIn case the setting is applied, it may be necessary to revert it through the database. You can use the below query to reset the format to the default.\r\n\r\n{code:sql}\r\nUPDATE propertystring SET propertyvalue='dd/MMM/yy' WHERE id IN (SELECT id FROM propertyentry WHERE property_key = 'jira.lf.date.dmy');\r\n{code}",

Problem Definition\r\nAt the moment, the Bulk Change permission can be configured in the global permission page and once the respective group has been granted to this permission, the group members will be able to perform a bulk change to all tickets in all projects. This would also allow them to Bulk change tickets for projects they shouldn't be administrating but have permission to edit single tickets.\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n- to use the current Bulk Edit interface (in Issue Navigator) but only display the Bulk Edit option if you have Bulk Edit permission to all projects contained in your search result\r\n- another option would be to enable it or when the project filter is selected & you filtered on projects where you have Bulk edit rights only. This might be better performing as you wouldn't need to check each individual ticket rather the projects in the filter\r\n \r\n",

When I type in a value like is after -1d, the syntax is immediately auto converted to a static date value such as March 31, 2016.  This means that I will have to update the activity stream every day to continue to get comments from just the last day. \r\n\r\nMy team documents the work they plan to do each day on the JIRA  each morning and documents progress updates throughout.  The activity stream makes it easier for local and global peers of the development team to monitor planned work, accomplished work, and unplanned work.  Today we work around this bug by streaming the last 5 updates for users without regard to update date.  We only do 5 so as to prevent seeing too many results from previous days.  However, this also forces us to click the 'more' button repeatedly to consume the previous day activity.\r\n\r\nThis seems to relate to https://ecosystem.atlassian.net/browse/STRM-1804.",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-60386].\n  {panel}\n\nThe current Project Categories functionality is way too broad of a feature.  It completely overlooks those using modified agile workflows or non-agile workflow such as in JIRA Core.  Also, it fails to handle the possibility that a single status could be used in 2 different projects at 2 completely different locations in a workflow.  Not to mention that it could possibly be used as 2 separate purposes within the same project in 2 different workflows on 2 different issue types.  The possibility that the same status is used as a ending state (done) and an In Progress state in the same project is very slim, but i've actually seen it before.\r\n\r\nFor example, I have seen a status called \"Verified\" which in one workflow was used as the final complete state (Done).  However, on a different issue type in the same project it was used as a middle state in the workflow where \"Closed\" was used as the Done state.  Now, on the global Status level, which category do you assign to the \"Verified\" state?\r\n\r\nAnother example is when a single workflow transitions an issue to multiple different job roles.  Therefore, based on the state of the workflow it may be in person1's queue and they have their own To Do, In Progress, Done statuses, but when it is in Done for person1, then it moves to person2's To Do queue where they also have their own In Progress and Done states.  However, with the global category setting, it turns out that both person1's and person2's statuses all end up being \"In Progress\" and therefore are all colored yellow.  Have you ever seen a dashboard with this new category system in this use case?  Every single status on the entire dashboard is yellow.  How is that beneficial to the user?\r\n\r\nThe current implementation also falls short on the UI of the statuses, Please return these status names in the UI to Camel Case because all caps is harder to read.  Human eyes are conditioned to read characters in Camel Case and therefore these words are easier to identify at a single glance.  ALL CAPS ARE TOUGH TO READ BECAUSE EACH CHARACTER IS THE SAME HEIGHT AND THEREFORE THE BRAIN NEEDS TO READ EACH CHARACTER SEPARATELY IN ORDER TO DETERMINE THE WORDS.  This is just something that will allow users to be able to quickly identify the status by name since the vast majority, if not all, statuses will be in a yellow state.\r\n\r\nWith the Categories, you have gone backwards in the ability to quickly identify a status and it's meaning.\r\n\r\nOn other issues it has been mentioned that the new categories was put in place in order to assist with the new Project Release board which shows the current fix version and a \"pretty\" blue, yellow, green bar to show the progress of that version.  Since this seems to be the only reason to implement project categories, it just doesn't make sense to do so on the global level.  For the same reasons as above, the project categories could be incorrectly colored for one project, but be correct for another.  Therefore, the Release board is only useful for 1 of those 2 projects.  Therefore, if you want to keep the Release board around, you should shift the category assignments to statuses down to at least the project level if not the project/issue type level.\r\n\r\nIn summary, the status categories need to be removed or altered to better suit ALL possible uses of JIRA.  Atlassian is making a big push with JIRA Core, JIRA Software, and JIRA Service Desk to make JIRA appealing to all different types of uses, but this functionality goes against that drive and actually hinders it.  Please make a change.",

Summary\r\n\r\nAfter an issue is edited, some users may be notified for this change, which will include the fields that were edited, their previous and new values.\r\n\r\nWhen editing an issue with the \u2018Edit\u2019 button (not inline), if both the \u2018Description\u2019 and the \u2018Assignee\u2019 fields are edited, only the \u2018Assignee\u2019 field is included in the notification email.\r\n\r\nThis was tested with several combination of fields and it seems that the \u2018Description\u2019 is always part of the notification, except when the \u2018Assignee\u2019 field is also edited. If several other fields are included along with \u2018Assignee\u2019 and \u2018Description\u2019, only the \u2018Description\u2019 is not part of the notification.\r\n\r\nThis is an example when changing \u2018Labels\u2019, 'Summary' and \u2018Description\u2019, but not \u2018Assignee\u2019:\r\n!no_assignee.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nIf we change the same fields and \u2018Assignee\u2019 as well, the \u2018Description\u2019 is not included. In the change below, the \u2018Description\u2019 was edited in the same operation, but not included in the notification:\r\n!assignee_included.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Create a project and have a user notified for \u2018Issue Updated\u2019\r\n# Edit an issue and change its \u2018Description\u2019\r\n# Edit it again, changing its \u2018Description\u2019 and its \u2018Assignee\u2019\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nBoth notifications include the \u2018Description\u2019 field being changed.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nOnly when we don\u2019t include \u2018Assignee\u2019 in the change does it include the \u2018Description\u2019.\r\n\r\nh3.Workaround\r\nChange the \u2018Assignee\u2019 in a separate operation.",

of [com.atlassian.jira.bc.issue.search.DefaultSearchService|https://docs.atlassian.com/software/jira/docs/api/latest/com/atlassian/jira/bc/issue/search/DefaultSearchService.html] from a thread different from the current session's thread (sorry for the terminology), I get a *NullPointerException*.\r\n\r\nWhen the method is called from JIRA current session's thread the exception is not thrown, and all works correctly.\r\n\r\nThis problem doesn't happen with versions previous to 7.1.0, and is related with the introduction of class [DefaultInstrumentationListenerManager|https://docs.atlassian.com/software/jira/docs/api/latest/com/atlassian/jira/instrumentation/DefaultInstrumentationListenerManager.html] since version 7.1.0.\r\n\r\nA stack trace related with the problem is:\r\n\r\n{noformat}\r\n2016-03-23 14:53:19,003 Timer-11 ERROR admin 893x1320x1 13kzhkq 0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1 /secure/WorkflowUIDispatcher.jspa
