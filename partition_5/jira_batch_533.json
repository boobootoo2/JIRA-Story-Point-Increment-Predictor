Problem Definition:\n\nAt the moment for JIRA Service Desk 3.3, on the page, that is a message that a satisfaction feedback will be sent out when an issue is resolved. But, there is no information about the prerequisite that it comes out with \"Request Resolved\" notification and only Service Desk generated notifications.\n\nThen, for JIRA Service Desk prior to 3.3, the documentation did not mention that the feature only works for JIRA Service Desk generated notifications. Hence, if the \"JSD Global Notification\" option is disabled in which the option is not available anymore on version 3.3, the Satisfaction Feedback would not be included even though it is enabled.\n - [Collecting Customer Notification|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/SERVICEDESKSERVER031/Collecting+customer+satisfaction+%28CSAT%29+feedback]\n\nh3. Suggested Solution:\n\nFor the settings in version 3.3, a message which mentions that the \"Request Resolved\" notification is needed will be great. While the documentation on the previous version is updated that mentions it only works for JIRA Service Desk generated notifications.\nh3. Why is it needed:\n\nTo prevent any misunderstanding on how the Satisfaction Feedback expected to work.e",

Unfortunately this isn't user friendly and takes more time than necessary.\n\nThere are a number of discussions and tools that also partially solve this problem, so there is definitely demand for a native feature like this:\n * [http://excel2jira.bluurgh.com/]\n * [http://www.exceltojira.com/]\n * [https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/111762/convert-a-spreadsheet-into-a-table]\n * [https://github.com/bennadel/JIRA-CSV-Formatter]\n\nNote: I'm unsure whether this fits better under JIRA Software or JIRA Service Desk.

This is noted as a bad idea since it messes with satisfying SLAs \u2013 especially when the SLAs may include conditions such as \"Comment: For customer\".\n\nOf course, there's also the point that when raising an issue into an organization, which of the members of this organization should be assigned or receiving notifications about this issue?\n\nI don't think this is a rare or even obscure use case so maybe it could become a priority?\n\nA workaround that we're working with is creating an internal user part of the organization only used by the agents with which we can raise issues. This is a pretty dirty workaround though...\n\nThanks!",

Problem Definition\r\nNewly created portal users through User Provisioning Sync (Google, AD, etc) do not come with any organization as default. You can only choose an organization if inserting the customer directly to a project. Being able to automatically assign them to a default organization would resolve this.\r\n\r\n\r\nh4. Suggested Solution\r\nIt would be good to automate user's creation by adding a default organization. So you can choose which SD Projects this user will be able to access by adding this organization to those projects.\r\n\r\nh4. Workaround\r\n\r\n# *Use REST APIs to add the users to an Org*\r\nWe do have some endpoints that can be use to create a script to automate that process. Check the details below:\r\n## [Get the users' accountId|https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/v3/?utm_source=%2Fcloud%2Fjira%2Fplatform%2Frest%2F&utm_medium=302#api-rest-api-3-users-search-get]:\r\n The last API requires you to have the _accountId_ of the users you want to add to the Org. To get that information from all your users you can use the following API\r\n Request type: _GET_\r\n Endpoint: *_/rest/api/3/users/search_*\r\n Payload:+_Not needed_+\r\n## [Get an Organization Id|https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/service-desk/rest/#api-group-Organization]:\r\n You also need to get the _OrganizationId_ to specify to which Org you want to add the users to.

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSDSERVER-4648].\r\n{panel}\r\nh3. Problem Solution:\r\n\r\nAt the moment, with the new feature of grouping user to an Organization. This includes the feature to set a request whether it is available for the Customer organization or a private request which is great. But, there is no option to set the default of the visibility or make it hidden.\r\nh3. Suggested Solution:\r\n\r\nTo have the option to disable the Request Visibility when raising a request where it will set by default whether it will available for the organization that the customer in or private. If possible, it will affect JIRA issue creation as well for JIRA Service Desk project.\r\nh3. Why is it important:\r\n\r\nThe use case scenario is to disable this option where the organization requests will be shared automatically among each other.\r\n{quote}If a customer creates a new issue, they can choose to make the request private. I'd like to disable this.\r\nWhen we manually create an issue and set the reporter to one of our customers, the organization remains unset. We can manually set an organization, but I want to make this process automatic depending on the originator. That is, if I set the originator of the issue to user X, and user X is part of organization Y, I want to add organization Y to the organization field to enable everyone that belongs to Y to view the issue.\r\n{quote}\r\n\u00a0\r\n||*Update as of 26 Nov 2020*||\r\n|Hi everyone,\r\nI'm happy to share that we have implemented an option to disable sharing requests with an Organization by default. Admins can change the default Organization sharing behaviour by going to Settings > Products > Configuration (under Jira Service Management), under the \"Organization management\" section.\r\nThis provides a way to change the default visibility as requested, however we do not intend to add an option to hide it completely, so I'm closing off this suggestion.\r\nCheers,\r\nThe Jira Service Management team|\r\n\r\n\u00a0",

Problem Definition\nAbility to create multiple unique forms under an individual issue/request type\n\nh3.

Why this is important\nIt would be incredibly useful to have the ability to create multiple unique forms under an individual issue/request type so that you can capture the right information at the first point of contact from the customer. The best example for this would be Service Requests as they can come in all different flavors.\n\nPossible Service Requests that would need a unique form are as follows:\n\n* New employee request form\n* Employee leaving form\n* Database access request form\n* Hardware ordering form\n* Software ordering form\n* Basically anything that either needs to be approved or tracked.\n \nh3.

[See the corresponding bug report|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSDSERVER-4632].\n  {panel}\n\nh3. Summary\nWhen a new Service Desk is created, JIRA Service Desk doesn't check for existing sub-task types with the same name as the default issue types created by JSD.\nThis will cause JSD to map valid request types to sub-tasks, which is not supported and hence throw an error when creating new requests.\n\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\n# Create sub-tasks with the same name as the JIRA Service Desk issue types (e.g. Incident / Problem / Service Request)\n# Create a Service Desk project that uses those issue types.\n# Navigate to the the *new project > Project Settings > Request Types*.\n# Double-check that the request is mapped to a sub-task, as the screenshot below:\n!incident.png|thumbnail!\n\nh3. Expected Results\nJIRA Service Desk should not create an inconsistent configuration - It should either:\n* Create a new issue type so that the mapping works properly.\n* Prompt users that the issue type is already mapped to a sub-task and hence one of the issue types will have to be renamed.\n\nh3. Actual Results\nWhen you try to create a request using this type, the following error is displayed in the screen:\n!error.png|thumbnail!\n\nThe stack trace below can be found in the {{atlassian-jira.log}}:\n{noformat}\n09-Jan-2017 11:46:44.817 WARNING [http-nio-8726-exec-15] com.sun.jersey.spi.container.servlet.WebComponent.filterFormParameters A servlet request, to the URI http://localhost:8726/jira726/rest/servicedesk/1/customer/pages/portal/4/create/22, contains form parameters in the request body but the request body has been consumed by the servlet or a servlet filter accessing the request parameters.

This bug seems to affect only the customer portal, not JIRA View issue screen, as is possible to see in the images below:\n\n*Customer portal:*\n!customerportal.png|thumbnail!\n\n*JIRA View issue screen:*\n!jiraviewscreen.png|thumbnail!\n",

This can limit some cases, like e.g: You have other 'User fields' for people like Stakeholders, who should receive some specific notifications. \n\n\n\nh3. Suggested Solution\nBe able to add other entities for the 'To:' field in customer notifications, like Customer Field Value (as it has on notification schemes) or be able to add customers or customers within a custom field into notification scheme (which currently don't work as JIRA Notification schemes work only for internal users not customers)\n",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSDSERVER-4573].\n  {panel}\n\nh3. Problem Definition\nAt the moment, when the MIME message in the mail headers do not obey the [RFC2183|http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2183.txt] convention, the only error message that can be seen in the Email Requests is {{There was an error reading the body of email message}}. The only way to find out the information on why the emails are being rejected is to check the log on Atlassian Support end.\n\nh3. Suggested Solution\nIt would be great if the email request can provide more detailed explanation why the emails are being rejected (e.g: there is a problem with the email header) so that it will be visible to the users\n\nh3. Why this is important\nThe customer will have the awareness that JIRA Service Desk can only accept email with headers that obey the specific criteria. ",
