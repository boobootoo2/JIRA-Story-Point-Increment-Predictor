These fields will prevent the rest of the page to load/render successfully, if the following is the case:\r\n\r\nAn add-on is active, which has a {{web-resource}} module with context set to {{atl.admin}} and a dependency to {{jira-fields}} (other dependencies may also cause the problem).\r\n\r\nThe dependency to {{jira-fields}} will include the content of _initInlineAttach.js_ to the page, which in turn will search for all file-input fields ({{input\\[type=file\\]}}) and handle them in a special way. The problem is that some extra html content is expected, which is not present for the _Logo_ and _Favicon_ fields. Therefore the javascript will fail with the following exception:\r\n{code}Unable to find maximum upload size on form.{code}\r\n\r\n*Suggestion:*\r\nThat can be prevented if the file-input fields for _Logo_ and _Favicon_ have the class {{ignore-inline-attach}} (see [this Answers thread|https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/134862/file-upload-in-custom-plugin?page=1#134912]).

I selected 'dont send email' which stopped JIRA driven notifications.  I had a registered external cloudservice consuming webhook notifications that has been otherwise able to consume all events.  On this occasion, JIRA seemed to encounter a timeout of somekind, reporting a session expiry, all the issues were deleted in this case, and from what I can tell, webhook data was successfully sent, but, the point of this issue is that from the users perspective 'something went wrong', whatever caused this timeout or other, for a bulk delete needs to be more flexible, to take into account of delays talking to external systems.  \r\n\r\nThis only happened with one addon and ~250 issues.  I would imagine multiple addons and many more issues would result in the same, and (possibly?) also result in lost webhook notifications.\r\n\r\nA suggestion would be to provide regular user on-screen feedback on numbers of issues 'dealt with' out of the total.  \r\n",

Additional info :\r\n\r\n* If the user links the page directly via the URL of the Confluence page, it will work with no problem\r\n* Other applink functionalities (such as JIRA Issue Macro) seems to be working fine\r\n* This appears to only happen in JIRA 6.3.1. During the test, it was connected with Confluence 5.5.3 \r\n\r\nh3.

Create a new workflow scheme and associate the new workflow with that scheme. Create a new project and assign the new workflow scheme to it.\r\n\r\nMake three changes to the new workflow:\r\n\r\n1) Modify status, for instance change Open to ToDo\r\n2) Modify transition, for instance change Start Progress to Begin Work\r\n3) Associate the new workflow with a different set of issue types than the original workflow\r\n\r\nDespite these changes being made to a copy that is associated with a different scheme and a different project, the original workflow will pick up at least some of the changes to statuses, but not to transitions or issue types.\r\n\r\nThe reverse is true as well. I had this happen accidentally this morning when I created a copy of an existing workflow and ran through the above. When it was brought to my attention, I went to fix the original workflow, only to discover that in the Administration -> Workflows view, the original workflow still looked fine and matched what was expected. Through that view, it had not been edited. The timestamp of the last edit had also not been updated. When viewing the original workflow through the project to which it was attached, however, the changes were visible. This despite no changes having been published to any workflow, including the copy.\r\n\r\nYou cannot directly edit a workflow through a Project -> Administration view, but I got to it through the workflow scheme and reverted the changes on the original workflow. I  then checked my copy and saw that the copied workflow had the statuses changed, but the additional status I'd created, as well as the transitions I'd modified, were still there.\r\n\r\nIt looks like a copied workflow continues to reference the same database rows/columns for statuses despite referencing new/different rows/columns for transitions. I would expect a copy to be completely autonomous of the original.",
