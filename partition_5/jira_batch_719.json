(Seems like it's happened at least once to multiple people we know.) After it happened to me last week, I resolved to report this as a usability problem.\r\n\r\nYou can reproduce this by imagining you've gathered a load of disparate information in the \"Create Issue\" Dialog (or actually do it) and accidentally click the \"Cancel\" link, or tap the Escape key. Bam! (dialog closes) Re-open. All your work's gone. Was there a prompt? Nope. (If there were a way to get it all back, that'd be great too!)\r\n\r\nMoreover, this behavior creates the need for the arcane \"write-up your bug in and editor and then copy+paste\" workflow, which is awfully painful. Please add a quick confirmation dialog! (or something equally small) Thanks!",

Either JIRA has to show linked pages in the issue filter area or Confluence has to improve the JIRA reporting to include the ability to choose to display or hide ALL linked types of items.\r\n\r\nThe tools are nice and easy to use, but it's hard to \"prove\" we have covered our requirements and addressed everything if we have to do this manually.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\nP.S.

      "description": "We are using JIRA with a custom Seraph authenticator. Basicall, as described on JRA-27280, our SSO service sets a cookie in the browser session and the Seraph plugin looks for that cookie and automatically logs in the correct user in the JIRA internal user dictionary. If the user does not yet exist there, it is created with a random password (it should be unused).\r\n\r\nThe problem is now the Mobile GUI. This one seems to not correctly pass all requests through the Seraph Authenticator:\r\n- If you click on log in in the mobile GUI, it shows JIRA Mobile's own username/password field, and does not redirect the user to the configured SSO (as defined in seraph-config.xml). As the internal database has a random password, you cannot log in. Also the login request is not passed to SeraphAuthenticators method that takes username/password. So you have no possibility to intercept the login or authorize the user.\r\n- If you sign in to the external provider before entering JIRA mobile (so the cookie is available and SeraphAuthenticator can report the user back to JIRA), the results are like that: Issues, restricted to users logged in, are now shown correctly. You can also add comments or watch them, So Seraph seems to work here, but in other parts of the GUI it still thinks that you are not logged in. E.g. on the left sidebar the links to \"my issues\" redirect you to the incorrect login screen. Also it shows \"Not logged in\" on the left sidebar.\r\n\r\nThe only workaround at the moment is to disable JIRA mobile plugin for our installation, which is not nice for mobile users.",

However, they have a larger user base of customers who only have access to browse, create issues and comment on a specific Bug tracking project. The situation currently is such that they are paying for licenses for JIRA, JIRA Agile and other development related plugins based on the number of entire JIRA users (majority of which are customers who only require the most basic features of raising a bug, and commenting on it), rather than the actual size of their development team.\r\n\r\nThe suggestion raised is to allow a 'Customer' group permission (perhaps a global permission) which restricts member's privilleges to only viewing, raising and commenting on unrestricted issues and which is excluded from the license count. \r\n* The requirement is not a Service Desk kind of Customer Portal per se as the customer in this case is not able to raise restricted issues/comments.\r\n\r\n",

We use the agile way of working but also the waterfall way of working. It is hard for project leads (who aren't technical) to determine which role the have to fill in. (also because we have some workflows which have role based transactions,)\r\n\r\nalso for test management we use this and have therefor also created different roles. Now everyone sees there all project roles. That isn't quite fancy and usefull. Can you help with this.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "description": "h2. Summary\r\n\r\nThe _Created vs. Resolved_ gadget is currently implemented to calculate week numbers for the \"weekly\" grouping option using java.util.Calendar instances configured with the default Locale.  As a result, week numbers are calculated based on the physical location of the JIRA server, and not based on actual configuration of the instance.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, if the _Use ISO8601 standard in Date Picker_ setting has been activated on the *Look and Feel* admin page of a JIRA server located in North America, the Created vs. Resolved gadget will calculate week numbers that are mis-aligned with the instance configuration.  This is because [ISO8601|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601] defines Monday-Sunday weeks, but North American locales will result in java.util.Calendar calculating Sunday-Saturday weeks.  There may be other effects of this misalignment as well.\r\n\r\nThis problem may also be the root cause for JRA-23398 and JRA-25061.\r\n\r\nh2. Details\r\n\r\nThe following code snippets show the implementation gap:\r\n\r\nh3. com.atlassian.jira.charts.CreatedVsResolvedChart\r\n\r\nThe method that generates the _Created vs. Resolved_ chart uses *DatePeriodStatisticsMapper* objects to convert the _Created_ and _Resolved_ dates to the grouping values.\r\n\r\n{code:Java}\r\nline 402:\r\nfinal StatisticsMapper createdMapper = new DatePeriodStatisticsMapper(ChartUtil.getTimePeriodClass(periodName), DocumentConstants.ISSUE_CREATED, getTimeZone());\r\n\r\nline 413:\r\nStatisticsMapper resolvedMapper = new DatePeriodStatisticsMapper(ChartUtil.getTimePeriodClass(periodName), DocumentConstants.ISSUE_RESOLUTION_DATE, getTimeZone());\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nh3. com.atlassian.jira.charts.jfreechart.util.ChartUtil\r\n\r\nThe *ChartUtil* class is used to provide a class that implements the [TimePeriod|http://sourceforge.net/p/jfreechart/code/HEAD/tree/trunk/source/org/jfree/data/time/TimePeriod.java] interface, which is required by the *DatePeriodStatisticsMapper* constructor (shown above).  *ChartUtil* returns the Class object for the appropriate [JFreeChart|http://www.jfree.org/jfreechart] class.\r\n\r\n{code:Java}\r\nimport org.jfree.data.time.Week;\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\npublic static Class getTimePeriodClass(ChartFactory.PeriodName periodName)\r\n{\r\n    switch(periodName)\r\n    {\r\n        case daily:\r\n            return Day.class;\r\n        case hourly:\r\n            return Hour.class;\r\n        case weekly:\r\n            return Week.class;\r\n        case monthly:\r\n            return Month.class;\r\n        case quarterly:\r\n            return Quarter.class;\r\n        case yearly:\r\n            return Year.class;\r\n        default:\r\n            return Day.class;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nh3. com.atlassian.jira.issue.statistics.DatePeriodStatisticsMapper\r\n\r\n*DatePeriodStatisticsMapper* creates an instance of the specified [TimePeriod|http://sourceforge.net/p/jfreechart/code/HEAD/tree/trunk/source/org/jfree/data/time/TimePeriod.java] class, without providing a Locale object.\r\n\r\n{code:Java}\r\npublic TimePeriod getValueFromLuceneField(String documentValue)\r\n{\r\n    Date date = LuceneUtils.stringToDate(documentValue);\r\n    if (date == null)\r\n    {\r\n        return null;\r\n    }\r\n    return RegularTimePeriod.createInstance(timePeriodClass, date, periodTimeZone);\r\n}\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nh3. [org.jfree.data.time.Week|http://sourceforge.net/p/jfreechart/code/HEAD/tree/trunk/source/org/jfree/data/time/Week.java]\r\n\r\nFinally, the *Week* class provided by [JFreeChart|http://www.jfree.org/jfreechart] uses [java.util.Calendar|http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Calendar.html] to calculate the year and week based on the provided *Date* instance.  When the *Week* object is created without a provided Locale (which the *DatePeriodStatisticsMapper* does, shown above), the default Locale is used.\r\n\r\n{code:Java}\r\nimport java.util.Calendar;\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\npublic Week(Date time, TimeZone zone) {\r\n    // defer argument checking...\r\n    this(time, zone, Locale.getDefault());\r\n}\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\npublic Week(Date time, TimeZone zone, Locale locale) {\r\n\r\n    ...\r\n\r\n    Calendar calendar = Calendar.getInstance(zone, locale);\r\n    calendar.setTime(time);\r\n\r\n    // sometimes the last few days of the year are considered to fall in\r\n    // the *first* week of the following year.  Refer to the Javadocs for\r\n    // GregorianCalendar.\r\n    int tempWeek = calendar.get(Calendar.WEEK_OF_YEAR);\r\n    if (tempWeek == 1\r\n            && calendar.get(Calendar.MONTH) == Calendar.DECEMBER) {\r\n        this.week = 1;\r\n        this.year = (short) (calendar.get(Calendar.YEAR) + 1);\r\n    }\r\n    else {\r\n        this.week = (byte) Math.min(tempWeek, LAST_WEEK_IN_YEAR);\r\n        int yyyy = calendar.get(Calendar.YEAR);\r\n        // alternatively, sometimes the first few days of the year are\r\n        // considered to fall in the *last* week of the previous year...\r\n        if (calendar.get(Calendar.MONTH) == Calendar.JANUARY\r\n                && this.week >= 52) {\r\n            yyyy--;\r\n        }\r\n        this.year = (short) yyyy;\r\n    }\r\n    peg(calendar);\r\n}\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nh3. [java.util.Calendar|http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Calendar.html]\r\n\r\nFinally, the documentation for java.util.Calendar describes that the Locale is used to determine how weeks are calculated, as shown by the definition of the [getFirstDayOfWeek()|http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Calendar.html#getFirstDayOfWeek()] method:\r\n\r\n{quote}\r\n{{public int getFirstDayOfWeek()}}\r\n\r\nGets what the first day of the week is; e.g., SUNDAY in the U.S., MONDAY in France.\r\n{quote}",

Furthermore I use http as I can then use an (affordable) Content Delivery Network rather than running over HTTPS.\r\nHowever for basic system and user security I really need the ability to force SSL only for login functions of JIRA.\r\nTo this day I have achieved this 99% through htaccess rewrites however it can sometimes prove to be buggy and would be far better to have a simple checkbox which said \"Force logins over SSL\" but ran the rest of the application in HTTP mode.",
