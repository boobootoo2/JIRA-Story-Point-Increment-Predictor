Your feedback is key to helping us understand how you use JIRA so we can continue improving your experience. We have reviewed this issue over the last few days; unfortunately we don't have any plans to support this in JIRA for the foreseeable future.\r\n\r\nPlease remember that jira.atlassian.com is one of many inputs for the JIRA roadmap. You can [learn more about our process here|https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/110373/how-does-the-jira-team-use-jira-atlassian-com].\r\n \r\nI understand that our decision may be disappointing. Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.\r\n \r\nRegards,\r\nDave Meyer\r\ndmeyer@atlassian.com\r\nProduct Manager, JIRA Platform\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\nIn jira-application.properties I see the availability to customize the email header format. This is what I have:\r\n\r\n# Specifies the From: header format in notification emails. Default is of the form \"John Doe (JIRA) <jira@company.com>\".\r\n# Available variables are ${fullname}, ${email} and ${email.hostname}\r\n# If commented out, format is just 'jira@company.com'\r\n# default: jira.email.fromheader.format = ${fullname} (JIRA)\r\njira.email.fromheader.format = ${email} (${fullname}) via JIRA\r\n\r\nThe problem is that the actual address (if the user clicks to \"Reply\") is not that, but the one specified for the project, so users will just click Reply not realizing that the reply to address is not what is shown. What's more, I do not see any of the variables available to show the sender's address (e.g. project1@company.com). Is there a way to get the reply-to address to be the actual user's address (it SHOWS in the email as the sender). Do you understand my question?\r\n\r\nThanks",

For this I am writing a Jira service that should get all the issues that have changed in the old system and create/update the issues in Jira.\n\nFor the update I have to check whether an issue has already been imported or not, thus I need to search a Jira issue by a custom field value. I use the code proposed in JRA-7031but then the service crashes when I re-index all bugs after the import.\n\nThe simplest code (not very functional ;-) ) to demonstrate this behavior:\n\n    public void run() {\n        SearchRequest sr = new SearchRequest(true); // search without security checks\n        sr.addParameter(new ProjectParameter(new Long(10001))); // id of existing project\n        try {\n            com.opensymphony.user.User adminUser = UserUtils.getUser(\"admin\"); // the super user\n            ManagerFactory.getIssueManager().execute(sr, adminUser); // if this line is commented, no exception raised at reindex\n            ManagerFactory.getIndexManager().reIndexAll(); // THIS WILL CRASH\n        }\n        catch (Exception e) {\n            // ignore\n        }\n   }\n\nThis leads to the following problem:\n\n[INFO] Http11Protocol - -Initialisation de Coyote HTTP/1.1 sur le port 8080\nDTmarrage du service Tomcat-Standalone\nApache Tomcat/4.1.29\n[INFO] RAMJobStore - RAMJobStore initialized.\n[INFO] StdSchedulerFactory - Quartz scheduler 'JiraQuartzScheduler' initialized from default resource file in Quartz package: 'quartz.properties'\n[INFO] StdSchedulerFactory - Quartz scheduler version: 1.4.5\n2005-06-21 19:34:52,482 INFO [atlassian.jira.upgrade.ConsistencyCheckImpl] Starting JIRA Enterprise Edition, Version: 3.2-#89\n2005-06-21 19:34:52,482 INFO [atlassian.jira.upgrade.ConsistencyCheckImpl] Configured to use database: hsql\n[INFO] QuartzScheduler - Scheduler JiraQuartzScheduler_$_NON_CLUSTERED started.\n[Filter: profiling] Using parameter [jira_profile]\n[Filter: profiling] defaulting to off [autostart=false]\n[Filter: profiling] Turning filter off [jira_profile=off]\n[WARN] ServletDispatcher - Unable to find 'webwork.multipart.saveDir' property setting.

We highly value your feedback in all forms, and through suggestions in jira.atlassian.com is not different. We use this channel often to learn the best we can with how customers use JIRA and how we can continue to improve the experience for as many users as possible.\r\n\r\nWe have revisited this issue again recently and wanted to reiterate that there are still currently no plans to implement this suggestion, and it is not currently on any JIRA team\u2019s roadmap at this stage.\r\n\r\nPlease remember that jira.atlassian.com is one of many inputs for the JIRA roadmap. You can [learn more about our process here|https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/110373/how-does-the-jira-team-use-jira-atlassian-com].\r\n\r\nI understand that our decision may be disappointing. Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.\r\n\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nKerrod Williams\r\nKerrod (dot) Williams (at) atlassian (dot) com\r\nProduct Manager, JIRA\r\n\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\nWe have a workflow that requires issues to be linked on a regular basis to their parent issues.  Thus we have Parent Issue P-1 and then we create user stories U-1, U-2, ..., U-n to support it, where n may be a large number.  Currently, we need to create the issue and then manually click Link Issue then find the right one, then click 'Accept' etc etc.\r\n\r\nCan I propose a new 'Create Linked Issue' as part of an issue's operations?  You would then see the same screen as 'Create New Issue' but you'd also have a link drop-down to select the link you want.  When the issue is created the link is then there already.\r\n\r\nI think this would greatly simplify the workflow of creating issue links.  Thanks!",

In the past (v 2.5.3) if the\nproject cache wasnt refreshed, then the project cache would be shagged.\nThis was because the project GV was being used as the key in the cacheing\nhashmap (and the GV changes every time an issue is created - the nextId is\nincremented)\nI see this last bug has been fixed (ProjectCache is now using the project\nID as the key)\n                                                                                                                                                             \nSo, given that this last bug was fixed - do we actually need to refresh the\nproject cache any more?\nFrom what I can see in the refresh, there is absolutely nothing in there\nthat could have changed by adding a new issue....\n\nPS\nSomewhat unrelated: there also is some code that could be tidied in\nCachingProjectManager :-) (that is assuming it is required at all)\n                                                                                                                                                             \n    public void refresh(GenericValue project)\n    {\n        ProjectCache.getCache().refresh(project);\n    }\n                                                                                                                                                             \nYou have a field \"cache\" which you could use.
