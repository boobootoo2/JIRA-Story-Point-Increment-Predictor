[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-22428].\n  {panel}\n\nHello ;\r\n\r\nI am currently developing a new Jira plugin. As a result, I have to create new pages in the administration menu. These pages are build on the same metamodel as the \"Add a new project\" page. \r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, I developed them using some features provided by JSP, based on the same way as the new project page. \r\n\r\nThe thing is : \r\nI cannot use any internationalisation language file for displaying some text information on my JSP. For instance, the addproject.jsp uses some keys (common.words.name) to display elements. The values of these keys are located in some .properties language files (like JiraWebActionSupport.properties). In the JSP I am developing, I have to create my own keys, because they are specific to my plugin. \r\n\r\nActually, I have already my own .properties file (located in my plugin dir : myPlugin/src/main/resources/com/.../jira/plugins/myPlugin.properties). This file works perfectly for the atlassian-plugin.xml file (My keys appear properly in the admin panel menu). If I call the JSP directly, it works, my .properties file is properly loaded too. But this is not a good way to use JSP in Jira. This is not true if I call my .jspa class, my page will appear, but it will not load my .properties file : the page will display my keys instead (myplugin.words.name for instance)\r\n\r\nIs it possible to find a way to give Jira an extra feature to include a new .properties file? I don't want to modify Jira files directly, because they are about to be overwritten at each new upgrade of Jira. \r\n\r\nI want to develop these pages using JSP because : \r\n- I need to use the component to select users using JQL features (which is implemented by the userselect.jsp template)\r\n- Java Server Pages are far easier to use than the Velocity views\r\n\r\nI submitted this as a new feature, because I believe that the use of JSP will affect more and more Jira developers ; Anyway, if I made something wrong in my development, if my request is already implemented, please could you give me a trick on how to use it?\r\n\r\nYours sincerely, \r\nNicolas L",

Cause\r\n\r\nThis is generally caused when the proxy sitting in front of JIRA forwards each request from HTTPS (HTTP) to JIRA as HTTP (HTTPS). For example this following Apache HTTPd configuration does this:\r\n\r\n{code:none}\r\nSSLProxyEngine on\r\nProxyRequests       Off\r\nProxyPreserveHost On\r\nProxyPass           /jira       http://localhost:8080/jira\r\nProxyPassReverse    /jira       http://localhost:8080/jira\r\n{code}\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this case we have {{Browser -> HTTPS -> Apache HTTpd -> HTTP -> JIRA(Tomcat)}}. The problem is that JIRA thinks the request is coming from the client as HTTP rather than HTTPS. This makes JIRA generate some HTTP based links rather than the correct HTTPS based ones. To fix this you will need to tell JIRA the protocol that the client is using. You can do this using the \"scheme\", \"proxyName\" and \"proxyPort\" properties in the HTTP Tomcat connector. See \"Alternative configuration if HTTPS is terminated on the proxy server\" section at http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Integrating+JIRA+with+Apache+using+SSL for details.",

For example, 200000 conversions take 78.0 millis instead of 5625.0 before.\r\n\r\nCheers, \r\nVitaliy Shevchuk",

This is generated from \"IssueFactory\".toLowerCase(\"tr\", \"TR\"). Unfortunately when we started up JIRA under en_US the proxy (DynamicServiceInvocationHandler) around the {{IssueFactory}} in the Greenhopper plugin continued to look for an \"\u0131ssueFactory\" but under the en_US locale it is registered under the \"issueFactory\" name. This causes the proxy to throw a NPE because it never finds the host service. \r\n\r\nResource: http://www.mattryall.net/blog/2009/02/the-infamous-turkish-locale-bug",

That would be the coolest thing to do.  Then I can have a true Road Map of just my \"major\" releases.\r\n\r\nA lower priority would be to be able to choose the status/resolution the gadget should use use to define \"done\".  Right now it only looks where resolution is empty, but we added the resolution field on the edit form and now all new issues have a \"in-progress\" value, thus the road map shows everything as \"in-progress\" even that they are not even started yet.  Not sure if this one makes sense or not.\r\n\r\nthank you,\r\nCory\r\n",

      "description": "Hi,\r\n\r\nThis is a behavior I have seen when I use JIRA. I use this link for JIRA http://ittools.vmware.com/jira/\r\n\r\nThere are times when we write a comment in the comments field, that we would want to check something up in the attached image on the JIRA. If we click on the image attachment while writing the comment, the attachment pops up, but while returning back the whole comment field is wiped out and I will have to write the entire text again. Looks like, until I click on the Add button on the Comments the comments do not get saved. I would say, atleast not let the user or may be warn the user, if he tries to click a link/attachment while he is writing a comment.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nSridhar.K.Unni",

Once the development is complete, they move the issue to a custom status of \"Requires Testing,\" at which point the QA team picks the issue up and tests against it.  This follows our team's definition of done, however because it is in a status with no resolution, the issue still appears as open in the JIRA reports.  As a workaround, we added a resolution status of \"Requires Testing,\" which closes the issue.\r\n\r\nWe've added a custom field for \"QA Assignee\" to track who on the QA team will test against the issue.  In order to edit the issue, QA must re-open it, then edit the assignee.  \r\n\r\nThere are two issues here: the first is that the \"assignee\" field is limited to one user.  I would like to have the ability to have a development assignee and a QA assignee, and maintain the user selected for each one for the duration of the issue (for auditing purposes).  What would make sense would be the ability to configure multiple assignee fields in an issue and select the assignee from defined project roles.\r\n\r\nThe second issue is that we have developed a cumbersome workaround for flagging the issue as being ready for QA.  If we leave it in the custom status, the issue appears as Open and the charts don't track correctly.  If we set it as Closed, it disappears from the reports and shows them as closed, but they have to be re-opened to assign the QA assignee.  I would like to be able to configure the definition of done - ie) if the status is \"Requires Test\" but is unresolved, configure this as done - it would allow us to avoid a step of having to resolve the issue for reports and then re-open it to assign a QA tester.",

      "description": "I was dealing with some Favicon code in Studio and after wondering why our logout page was not showing a favicon. As it turns out it is because the frontpage.jsp page does not include the favicons because they reside in header.jsp.\r\n\r\nEither way, after talking to Dariusz, we thought it might be a good idea to refactor the favicons into their own include file, and include theme everywhere that they are required; like the frontpage.jsp and header.jsp.\r\n\r\nThis would really help with Studio because currently we patch frontpage.jsp with a made up favicon link that gets intercepted with every other favicon in our FaviconServlet and we would love to get rid of that little bit of indirection. The related studio bug is here: https://studio.atlassian.com/browse/JST-2955",

Essentially the login bar does not fill up 100% of the screen after adding the columns. It looks like the Login bar is fitted for 100% of the origional screen size. So if you make the browser box smaller the problem will appear. On a large screen will not appear because the bar is configured to fill 100% of that screen already. The exact steps as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Click the \"view\" button to search issues in the issue navigator screen.\r\n\r\n2. Select the \"configure columns\", and then click it to enter issue \r\nconfigure columns screen.\r\n\r\n3.

Click the \"issue\" icon on menu bar to return to the issue navigator \r\nscreen.\r\n\r\n5.
