So in my opinion it is really hard to see the differences for bigger comments.\r\nA web-diff would be preferred since you could easily highlight the changed positions by e.g. red/green colors.

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-30981].\n  {panel}\n\nWe have quite a few workflow transitions that do not change status when run. These transitions tend to exist for almost all of our statuses. This means I have to recreate each transition for each status instead of using the \"common transition\" available in the workflow designer.  As an example, I recently had to add 3 transition for each of our 8 different states.  Each transition involved complex conditions and post functions.  It took me about 5 VERY TEDIOUS hours to get this done.  I know it is possible to specify a '-1' for originating step directly in the xml, but it is simply impossible for us to deactivate and reactivate a workflow to accomplish this as we have over 100k issues that would have to transition to a new workflow; this would take many hours to run.  Adding \"originating step\" as a choice in the gui for the destination step would be a huge improvement.  If I had that functionality, it would have taken me only a short time to add the transitions.",

But if you do not swicth between the issuetypes and start with the one with the deault set it will behave properly. So its a bug that happens only when you are creating an issue -> select issue type A which does not have the default radio button set, and then switch issuetypes you are trying to create (before creating the issue) and the radio button does not refresh to show the default selection.\r\n\r\nI've only seen this in 5.0.5 - have not tried any newer versions of Jira.",

We created a Confluence page with a JIRA issues macro that returned issues for a particular Fix Version (e.g. JIRA 5.2.3). \r\nAt that point in time, no issues had been assigned to that Fix Version (JIRA 5.2.3), but we knew that there would be.\r\n2. We create a simple search on JAC to find all relevant issues assigned to 5.2.3. We know that it will be empty, but we wanted to get the XML to put in our draft release notes.\r\n3. The Views menu does not display. At this point I actually thought that it was some sort of permissions error.\r\n\r\nI would like the Views menu to show whether there are issue results or not.\r\n\r\nThere may be other scenarios where a user might want to get a view of a search that is currently empty, but they know will have issues in future (e.g. RSS feed).",

However, it can be quite tedious if the transitions are complex whereby validators, conditions, and post functions has been set for that function.\r\n\r\nImagine having to delete all of them and set them up again.

A current example is that I'm building out a request to use Jira for project tracking.  I've created a 'Project Tracking' issue type for that, and all enhancements/defects across projects will be linked to the issue type.  However, I would want to customize the display so in addition to the summary I could see the Status (not the tiny icon) and also other custom fields, such as 'Schedule' so I can see if the linked issue is behind/on/ahead of schedule, as well as the Fix Version for issues.  I'd also like to one click sort by the links instead of having to go into the back end and manipulate a file.  When having a large number of linked issues, being able to manipulate how we view the data would be hugely advantageous.",

I attached the screenshot from this issue I'm creating.  When I see the dropdown looking like this, my first thought is something is wrong with the current selection -- like the issue type \"Bug\" is no longer supported, so I need to choose a different issue type.  My other frustration with this is my company has the following priorities: Blocker, Critical, Major, Minor, Trivial.  So when something like Major is selected, and I want to check where it falls in order of priority, it's not immediately visible because Major does not appear in the list.  Then I often pick what I know to be the lowest priority, Trivial, to see where Major is ordered in the list.  It's just one more thing that makes adopting a new system more difficult.",

It would be nice to have a summary metric, say calculated per sprint / iteration, that showed the total number of DIs that entered each state per sprint.\r\n\r\nThe sample workflow would look something like this: issue is created, assessed and worked upon via one or more state transitions (e.g.: open->analysing->in progress) and it get re-assigned to another team member for final testing and validation (e.g.: by setting it to a \"testing\" state). A bug is found with the implementation and so the issue is re-opened. If a large number of issues fall into this category, say 50%, it indicates possible problems earlier in the workflow which may suggest possible workflow improvements (e.g.: perhaps the requirements were unclear or the implementation was not up to par). By being able to measure the total number of issues per-sprint that transitioned at some point to the \"re-opened\" state it allows leads to spot such issues much easier.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned on my somewhat related DI JIRA-30900, there may be some alternate means through which we can calculate such a metric (scripts, third-party plugins, etc.) but I have not found any yet. I am open to suggestions. However, ideally this would be an integrated feature in Jira not requiring any special configuration.",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-30900].\n  {panel}\n\nMy team works on a diverse set of issues and as such it proves difficult to isolate bottlenecks in our development pipeline. One thing that would help this analysis is if Jira had a report or some summary information available that showed the total amount of time each DI spends in a particular state.\r\n\r\nFor example, suppose you have 5 states in your workflow: TODO, Analysis, In Progress, Testing, and Done. Further, suppose it takes on average 2 days to complete each storypoint (e.g.: as a Kanban velocity metric) and you have a desire to increase your velocity by 50%. It would be nice to measure how long each issue spends in each state as this could provide an indicator of where the most time is spent in the workflow, and hence has the most potential for improvement. For example, if out of the 2 days issues on average spend 75% of their time in the \"testing\" state, then perhaps you should focus your efforts on improving your testing procedures.\r\n\r\nAt its simplest level, this information could be provided on a per-issue basis so if there are specific outliers on a sprint or iteration that need attention one could evaluate the metrics for those particular items. Conversely, it would be nice to have more elaborate reporting features that could amalgamate these metrics on a per-sprint / iteration basis as well. (e.g.: total time issues spent in analysis this sprint, etc.)\r\n\r\nPerhaps there is some way to write a script to calculate these metrics, or maybe a third party plugin or something, but I have yet to find a workable solution for this problem. Ideally it could be integrated into the standard functionality of Jira but I would be opened to alternative suggestions.",
