Currently there are many to choose from but a useful one would be for the person to whom the case gets assigned in that transition, to receive - not just the most recent comment - but a full transcript of the case including all fields (like the emails received when the case is first opened) and all comments.\r\n\r\nEffectively this is like the view you see of the case, when you view it online - only this time you're receiving it in an email automatically as part of a workflow step.\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nFor example: When we comment one particular issue, the notification/email will be sent to any related user to that particular issue. And the email only shows the comment only, without showing all the fields and including all the comments that has been commented from that particular issue.\r\n\r\nRelated issue: [JST-126664|https://support.atlassian.com/browse/JST-126664]\r\n",

I let you check that.*_\r\n\r\nIn terms of workaround, i have only the following solution\r\n* Force a default description, but I am not sure that it will be acceptable by business\r\n* Patch the plugin as follow :\r\n{code:javascript}\r\nvar missingPanels = [];\r\n\r\n// For each panel already present in this collection, check if it is still present in data.\r\n// If not, remove it from the collection.\r\nthis.each(function (panel) {\r\n\tvar panelId = panel.id;\r\n\tvar panelPresentInPanelEntities = _.any(data, function (panel) {\r\n\t\treturn panel.id === panelId\r\n\t});\r\n\tif (!panelPresentInPanelEntities) {\r\n\t\tmissingPanels.push(panel);\r\n\t\tthis.remove(panel);\r\n\t}\r\n}, this);\r\n\r\nAJS.$(missingPanels).each(function (panel) {\r\n\tinstance.remove(panel);\r\n});\r\n{code}",

Function linkedIssues() only shows the issues linked to a particular issue, I want to find all issues those are linked to other issues marked by a specific link type, e.g., \"is blocked by\".\r\n\r\nThis function could incorporate querying issues that are linked _to any issue_ with a given link type and bearing in mind that links have two identities, one in each direction, the link type could be direction specific or not. \r\n\r\nh4. Examples\r\n\r\n# find all issues that are duplicates of issue JRA-25640 (one direction, issue specified)\r\n# find all issues that are blocking issue JRA-25640 or that JRA-25640 blocks (bidirectional, issue specified)\r\n# find all issues that are duplicates of any issue, or which duplicate any issue (bidirectional, no issue specified)\r\n# find all issues that are blocked (one direction, no issue specified)\r\n\r\nh4. Implementation Notes\r\n\r\n* The JQL function that exists must continue to work exactly as it does. If it is possible to overload the JQL function based on arity and this makes a consistent API, then this would be preferred. Otherwise, there may need to be a new function name which provides vararg behaviour as described above.\r\n* The link index entries added in 4.4 (I think) provide enough to build performant lucene queries for the above use cases. What's missing is the JQL function plumbing.",

Specifically, we run into instances where other business teams require information about software versions that we release into production.  \r\n\r\nPeople frequently want to know what issues (tickets) were in a Version (this info is already provided in the Versions tab), whether each ticket was a bug fix or a new feature, who worked on each ticket, and how much time they spent on each ticket.  It would be great if all this information would be readily available to download as a .csv or .xls as well so we could pass this information along to other business teams easily.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nAndrew T",

Description:\r\n\r\nWhat happens currently when editing a description is that your edits are discarded if the Escape key is pressed.\r\n\r\nThere are many reasons why the Escape key can be pressed by mistake in today's browser use and varied workflows, and so users end up losing their unsaved descriptions.  \r\n\r\nFurthermore, Jira [itself|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Using+Keyboard+Shortcuts?continue=https%3A%2F%2Fconfluence.atlassian.com%2Fdisplay%2FJIRA%2FUsing%2BKeyboard%2BShortcuts&application=cac] encourages the use of the Escape key to clear the focus of the current fields.\r\n\r\nIf you click away from a description edit box to lose focus, your work is saved.  However, if you use the Escape key to lose focus, your work is discarded.  This is inconsistent behavior.\r\n\r\nThe above behavior is in contrast to how editing comments behaves.  When editing comments, navigating away whether by click, escape key, or page refresh, will popup an alert for the user to confirm their action (when there are changes to the comment).  \r\n\r\nI'm not sure why editing comments is given so much more importance than editing issue descriptions, but both edit operations should behave consistent with eachother, as it is confusing for the user to have separate behaviors depending on what you edit.\r\n\r\nh2. What should happen:\r\n\r\n1. Make editing issue descriptions behave the same way as when editing comments.\r\n* Alert box will show when there is risk of losing changes.\r\n\r\n2. As a way of allowing users to preserve current behavior with mininal disruption, provide users a way to configure the behavior of the ESC key in description boxes.  Possible (but not exaustive) list of choices:\r\n\r\n* Escape to discard changes, no confirmation (Current behavior, should be default for existing accounts)\r\n* Escape to discard changes, require confirmation (Can be default for new accounts)\r\n* Escape to save changes, no confirmation (Alternatively, can be default for new accounts)\r\n* Escape only to lose focus but leaving text area in edit mode\r\n* Do nothing\r\n\r\nSee: my [previous comments|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRA-36670?focusedCommentId=692922&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-692922] for a longer rant on this topic.",
