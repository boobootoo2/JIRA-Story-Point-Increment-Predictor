It would be more usefull for transition screen to explain what the transition means and remind the user on how to correctly execute the transition.\r\nI try to write a correct doc but users tend never to read docs, it is easier to have them reminded of what they should do directly on the screen..\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nFran\u00e7ois\r\n",

I should have filed this issue years ago, but recently this was brought to my attention again.\r\n\r\nWe use attachments extensively, and we even introduced guidelines for the naming of attachments so they're ordered the way we want to.  But this proves unworkable in the long run.  Therefore, the enhancement request is to make it possible to order attachment in various ways, such as name, creation date, modification date, etc.  This sorting should stay in effect across issues (i.e. it is not issue specific).\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\n\\-Jaap\\-\r\n",

Your feedback is key to helping us understand how you use JIRA so we can continue improving your experience. We have reviewed this issue over the last few days; however there are no immediate plans to put this suggestion on our near term roadmap.\r\n\r\nI'd recommend to take a look at [Portfolio for JIRA|https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/portfolio]'s features to evaluate if that could help you manage and schedule your issues as described here.\r\n\r\nI understand that our decision may be disappointing. Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nDaniel Franz\r\ndfranz@atlassian.com\r\nPrincipal Product Manager, JIRA Platform\r\n{panel}\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe following (if feasible) would allow issue dependencies to be created, ranging from just two issues up to potentially all issues in a given version of a project.\r\n\r\nThis would allow Gantt charts to be created.\r\n\r\n********************************\r\n\r\nAdd two fields to JIRA issues: \r\n- ScheduleType (single-select list) -- required.\r\n- StartDate (time/date) -- requiredness depends on the value of ScheduleType as itemised below.\r\n\r\nAdd one field to JIRA project versions:\r\n- VersionStartDate (time/date) -- required.\r\n\r\nMake the following existing field required:\r\n- VersionDueDate (time/date) -- required.\r\n\r\n\r\nEnhance the global configuration of Link Types so that one Link Type must be nominated as the 'Master' (this Link Type will be used to control actual dependencies between issues).\r\n\r\n********************************\r\n\r\nScheduleType has 7 possible values: \r\n\r\n1. 'Issue Start Date'\r\n2. 'Issue Due Date'\r\n3. 'Start After Linked Issues Finish'\r\n4. 'Finish Before Linked Issues Start'\r\n5. 'Version Start Date'\r\n6. 'Version Due Date'\r\n7. 'None'\r\n\r\nDepending on which value the user selects, the following will occur: \r\n\r\n(1). If ScheduleType = 'Issue Start Date', then:\r\n- OriginalEstimate is required.\r\n- StartDate is required.\r\n- DueDate (non-editable) is automatically set to StartDate plus OriginalEstimate (or, if work has already commenced, to StartDate plus RemainingEstimate).\r\n\r\n(2). If ScheduleType = 'Issue Due Date', then:\r\n- OriginalEstimate is required.\r\n- StartDate (non-editable) is automatically set to DueDate minus OriginalEstimate.\r\n- DueDate is required.\r\n\r\n(3). If ScheduleType = 'Version Start Date', then:\r\n- OriginalEstimate is required.\r\n- StartDate (non-editable) is automatically set to the VersionStartDate.\r\n- DueDate (non-editable) is automatically set to StartDate plus OriginalEstimate (or, if work has already commenced, to StartDate plus RemainingEstimate).\r\n\r\n(4). If ScheduleType = 'Version Finish Date', then:\r\n- OriginalEstimate is required.\r\n- DueDate (non-editable) is automatically set to the VersionDueDate.\r\n- StartDate (non-editable) is automatically set to DueDate minus OriginalEstimate.\r\n\r\n(5). If ScheduleType = 'Start After Linked Issues Finish', then:\r\n- OriginalEstimate is required.\r\n- StartDate (non-editable) is automatically set to the latest DueDate of all linked issues where the Link Type matches the specified 'Master' Link Type and the current issue contains the Outgoing Link; or if no such links exist, to the VersionStartDate.\r\n- DueDate (non-editable) is automatically set to StartDate plus OriginalEstimate (or, if work has already commenced, to StartDate plus RemainingEstimate).\r\n\r\n(6). If ScheduleType = 'Finish Before Linked Issues Start', then:\r\n- OriginalEstimate is required.\r\n- DueDate (non-editable) is automatically set to the earliest StartDate of all linked issues where the Link Type matches the specified 'Master' Link Type and the current issue contains the Incoming Link; or if no such links exist, to the VersionDueDate.\r\n- StartDate (non-editable) is automatically set to DueDate minus OriginalEstimate.\r\n\r\n\r\n(7). If ScheduleType = 'None', then:\r\n- StartDate is editable (and optional); but cannot be set to empty if any Outgoing links of the 'Master' Link Type exist.\r\n- DueDate is editable (and optional); but cannot be set to empty if any Incoming links of the 'Master' Link Type exist.\r\n\r\n********************************\r\n\r\nNOTES: \r\n(i). The system 'Time Tracking' values (i.e. 'Hours per day' and 'Days per week') would need to be taken into account in the above calculations. \r\n(ii). Whenever there is a change to an issue's StartDate, DueDate, OriginalEstimate or RemainingEstimate, any linked issues (where the 'Master' Link Type is used) would need to be updated as per (5) and (6) above.\r\n(iii). Whenever a link between two issues is created, using the 'Master' Link Type, it would need to be validated to ensure that no circular dependencies are created; and any dependent issues would need to be updated as per (5) and (6) above.\r\n(iv). Whenever a link between two issues, of the 'Master' Link Type, is deleted, any linked issues would need to be updated as per (5) and (6) above.\r\n(v). Whenever there is a change to a version's VersionStartDate or VersionDueDate, any dependent issues would need to be updated as per (3), (4), (5) and (6) above.\r\n(vi). StartDate should not be used to constrain the 'Start Date' that appears on the 'Log Work' popup -- this would just get too messy.",

This creates a bad incentive to leave votes open longer than they should\r\n2. In our public JIRA install, we'd like to still collect votes on issues we marked \"resolve/wont fix\", so that we can reconsider should there be a popular groundswell.\r\nh3.

      "description": "| Everyone should be able to use http-links referring to private filters! |\r\n\r\n*Situation*\r\nImagine you are a normal Jira user, without special permissions (i.e. \"JIRA Administrators\" or \"Create shared filter\"). You have created a wonderful filter with exactly the right columns in the perfect order - and now you want to share it with some of your colleges. \r\n\r\nBut it is impossible :-(  \r\n\r\nIf you send them a link to your filter, they will get this message:\r\n\"You do not have the permission to view the selected private filter\"\r\n\r\nAnd if you give them a Permlink to your filter, they won't see what you see. \r\n\r\nIt is even worse, if you have used your private filter to create a report - there is no way you can share this report with others.\r\n\r\n*\"Semi-workarounds\"*\r\nYou could send a perm-link to the filter\r\n - But it is an extra step \r\n - And more importantly - you will lose you column layout\r\n\r\nOr you could ask your filter-administrator to create a shared filter\r\n - But you have to involve others and it is extra work\r\n - And you may not have a suitable JIRA-group in your setup, to share the filter to\r\n   (Unless it is a truly brilliant filter, which your administrator will share globally)\r\n\r\n*Solution*\r\n| Everyone should be able to use http-links referring to private filters! |\r\n\r\n* This way it would be easy to share filters and reports with simple links.\r\n\r\nThis would also reduce some of the other problems with filters:\r\n* You don't need to create extra groups, just for sharing a filter\r\n    (in our organisation we use project-roles in stead of JIRA-groups)\r\n* You are no longer limited to share filters to ONE group of users (JRA-4139) \r\n* It would reduce the need for shared filters - which again would ease the administration of filters\r\n\r\n*Possible problems*\r\nI can't see any. No matter how the filtering is done (filter or Permlink), the user will only see the issues he is allowed to see.\r\n\r\nOf course the link would stop working, if the private filter is deleted - but that is the way of links (and also true for shared filters).\r\n\r\nIf the filter is changed after the link has been sent, it may confuse the user of the link (again, that is also true for shared filters). It is probably a bigger problem with private filters, so perhaps there should be a note in the filter-information box, that the current filter is private.\r\n\r\nIf it turns out, that there is a problem with allowing everyone to see all private filters, you could add a new option to \"Global permissions\":\r\n\"Allow use of all private filters for group(s): <Jira-group>\"\r\n\r\n*Example*\r\nHere is a great ;-) filter I have created:\r\nhttp://jira.atlassian.com/secure/IssueNavigator.jspa?requestId=15160&mode=hide \r\n\r\nAnd here is the Permlink - but without my column layout:\r\nhttp://jira.atlassian.com/secure/IssueNavigator.jspa?reset=true&&query=enterprise&summary=true&description=true&environment=true&type=4&type=2&pid=10240&resolution=-1&sorter/field=priority&sorter/order=DESC&sorter/field=updated&sorter/order=DESC \r\n \r\nAnd if you want to see my report - you have to do the following:\r\n# save the Permlink as your own filter\r\n# go to any project and chose \"Single level group by report\"\r\n# use your new filter\r\n# and group by component\r\n\r\n...or you could look at the attached screen dump.\r\n\r\nIt would be so much easier, if you could just use this link:\r\nhttp://jira.atlassian.com/secure/ConfigureReport.jspa?filterid=15160&mapper=components&selectedProjectId=10240&reportKey=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.reports%3Asinglelevelgroupby&Next=Next \r\n",

When comments are sorted in descending order the new comment textarea is displayed at the bottom of the page, furthest from the most recent comments.

In particular, some customers seem confused about when they need to do the intermediate step via 3.7 (only needed for the \"quick\" way, but some customers think they need to do this for proper way as well).\r\n\r\nI think it might need a technical writer's eagle eye over [Upgrading JIRA Safely|http://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/docs/latest/upgrading.html] and [SQL Scripts for 3.6.x to 3.7 schema upgrade|http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/SQL+Scripts+for+3.6.x+to+3.7+schema+upgrade], to make sure that this documentation is as crystal clear as it can be.\r\n\r\nWhile you are there, Jeff has written a page on [Making databases read-only for upgrade backups|http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Making+databases+read-only+for+upgrade+backups]. Could you please add a link to it from the main doco, although some of the initial description in that page - the first four or five sentences about the issues around ensuring a consistent backup by making sure no one is changing the database - should probably go in the main page.\r\n\r\nLet me know if you need any help or further info.

      "description": "A support customer has reported the following problem. An issue contains non-Ascii characters in the summary and description. When this issue is in the results of a issue filter, and you do an XML view of the issue filter, the characters are \"doubly-escaped\" in the description, but not in the summary.\r\n\r\nSo if the issue contains \"\u00e4 \u00f6 \u00fc\" in the summary and description, here is the resulting XML (excerpt):\r\n\r\n{noformat}\r\n<title>[TST-25] Non-ascii characters in summary and description: &#228; &#246; &#252;</title>\r\n<link>http://localhost:8090/jira/browse/TST-25</link>\r\n<description>And in the description as well: &amp;#xE4; &amp;#xF6; &amp;#xFC;</description>\r\n<environment></environment>\r\n<key id=\"10080\">TST-25</key>\r\n<summary>Non-ascii characters in summary and description: &#228; &#246; &#252;</summary>\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nNote that the XML appears fine in Firefox and IE when they interpret the output an an RSS feed. When you do a View Source though or save the XML to a file, you get the above.\r\n\r\nI was able to readily reproduce the problem on JIRA Standalone 3.10.1 on my box. Then things got complicated...\r\n\r\nI created a test issue on http://jira.atlassian.com to include in my (what I thought was going to be straightforward) bug report. Here is it: TST-11826. However I cannot reproduce the bug there. Here is the XML output from a search filter containing that issue:\r\n\r\n{noformat}\r\ntitle>[TST-11827] Another attempt: &#228; &#246; &#252;</title>\r\n<link>http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/TST-11827</link>\r\n<description>And in the description as well: &#228; &#246; &#252;</description>\r\n<environment></environment>\r\n<key id=\"56080\">TST-11827</key>\r\n<summary>Another attempt: &#228; &#246; &#252;</summary>\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nSo I thought about what was different between http://jira.atlassian.com and my box. http://jira.atlassian.com uses:\r\n- Apache proxy server\r\n- Resin\r\n- PostgreSQL\r\n\r\nI went and tested all these options. I tried in an JIRA Standalone instance using PostgreSQL. It produced the bug. I tried in an instance running Resin (same version as http://jira.atlassian.com) and Postgres. It produced the bug. I tried on an instance with Apache in front of it. It produced the bug.\r\n\r\nJeff and I played with port forwarding to view the output of http://jira.atlassian.com without going through the Apache proxy. It didn't produce the bug. (That is, the Apache proxy is not a factor.)\r\n\r\nI also tried in https://support.atlassian.com. It did not produce the bug.\r\n\r\nSo in any case, it is a bug, and one that is readily reproducible, as long as you don't use http://jira.atlassian.com or https://support.atlassian.com. ????\r\n\r\nLet me know if you have any ideas for further tests to try and isolate it, and I am happy to try them out.\r\n\r\n",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-13309].\n  {panel}\n\nA month ago I had a support case where a customer was getting OutOfMemoryErrors when accessing the following JIRA admin pages:\r\n- Menus Administration ->Global Settings -> Events\r\n- Issue Settings -> Statuses\r\n\r\nWe were only able to reproduce the OutOfMemory errors for the Events page. This was fixed in in 3.10.1 - JRA-13042.\r\n\r\nWhile we were not able to reproduce the OutOfMemory errors for the Issue Statuses page, that page does run slowly. On version 3.10.1 it takes 75 seconds to display the Issue Statuses page for the customer's data. The customer does have 46 issues and 206 issue statuses, so I acknowledge that this is perhaps pathological data. However I thought I should still log it as an issue, in case you want to investigate it further, to see if it is worth trying to improve the performance of this page.\r\n\r\n{panel:title=Atlassian Status as of 07/07/2010|borderStyle=solid|borderColor=#3C78B5| titleBGColor=#3C78B5| bgColor=#E7F4FA}\r\nThanks for everyone's input. We are still looking at this performance issue however it has not made it into the 4.2 release. \r\nWe will look at this again in the near future. Please keep updating this issue as we are watching it.\r\n{panel}\r\n",

We are otherwise satisfied with our purchase except that the XML, HTML and Word issue views lack a feature that is critical from our point of view: the worklog. Currently the XML, HTML and Word issue views in JIRA 3.10 contains only comments in addition to the basic issue fields. Therefore we request that worklogs if not all possible issue information is included to the issue views. This would make getting formal and good looking reports out of JIRA easy.\r\n\r\nWe think that the possibility to see worklog information in all issue views is a feature that should be a standard in JIRA instead of being accessible only by the means of plug-ins.

For example, if our 'i18n-name-key' property (\"action.hello.world.name\") wasn't found in HelloWorldAction.properties, the action name would become \"Hello World Action Example\".\r\n\r\nThis isn't the case for the description attribute. Here, if key \"action.hello.world.desc\" isn't found, JIRA uses \"action.hello.world.desc\". It should fall back to \"Webwork plugin example that prints hello world.\".\r\n\r\nThe problem also affects web-item labels. The lack of fallback here means (at least) web-item plugins cannot be internationalized without breaking in untranslated environments.\r\n",
