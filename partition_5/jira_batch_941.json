That is because data and state information is not saved prior to actual user execution.  Any user inputed data, queries, attachment selections, etc will all be destroyed if the back button is pressed.  This is extremely frustrating for me because I have a mouse with fwd. and back buttons near my thumb, and I frequently press them accidentally.  I am new to Jira, but have alrady had about 3 incidents that have caused me to loose detailed bug reports.  This costs the company money, and wasted time every incident.  It just seems prudent to prevent this from occuring by either saving the data in a temprorary location, or by warning the user if data has been submitted, and the back button is pressed.  There has got to be a way to either prevent this, or reduce the risk by warning users before it happens.  This issue is too frequently submitted in Jira, and Confluence to ignore.\r\n",

This usually fails however, as text/html parts when inline in a message usually denote the HTML version of the plain text, and thus mail clients don't usually bother to attach a filename to the part. This causes a warning message to appear in the logs (see JRA-10825 for more info):\r\nbq.

So, after my upgrade I commented out the announcement, like so:\r\n<!--\r\n<center>\r\n<font color=\"31289C\">\r\nJIRA has been upgraded to version 3.6.3\r\n</center>\r\n</font>\r\n-->\r\nand although it correctly displays nothing, it still shows the brown separator bar.\r\nIs this an improvement?

It is at the end the tab the users normally check for more while trying to understand what has to be downloaded, what has been done, ....\r\n\r\nOn the Release we would like to \"link\" two other informations:\r\n- the list of installation kits (full name) it is builf of\r\n- the list of sites where it runs\r\n\r\nThe first can be a simple \"attachment\" : a document where who has delivered the new Release reports the installation kits (RPMs for linux but any free text to be more general). \r\n\r\nThe list of sites can be helpfull as who i running a SW, with a version, might be interested in being logged such to be warned of new releases and, on the other side, the Configuration Control of the SW Company can always know whats running where. To have what I asled for you should also add the \"concept\" of \"site\" that can be a special user, with email configrured as any other user.  am only suggetsing a solution but I am sure there are more and more. I am interested in the Configuration Control honestly rather then in the email alert on new releases but this might be of interest of others.\r\n\r\nAny suggestion is welcome.

You'll get a filter of the entire DB if you click permlink on a filter that uses only Multi-issue keys.\r\n\r\nThe comment in JRA-7068 mentions adding \"&customfield_10190=JRA-1000,JRA-2000\" on the end of the URL (adjusting the custom field # for your installation).
