Summary\r\nSome Assignable User Permissions allow any user to be selected in the assignee field at issue creation\r\n\r\nPlease note that this issue doesn't happen with any Assignable user Permission. For now, it has only been reproduced in the case where this permission is granted to:\r\n- either *Group custom field value*\r\n- or *User custom field value*\r\n\r\nFrom what I observed which this type of Assignable User Configuration is that:\r\n- on the issue creation view, the assignee field shows all users from the JIRA instance, instead of only the users who are assignable\r\n- if we select a user who is not assignable, it is impossible to create the ticket and JIRA will complain about this user (which shows that JIRA will verify the permission AFTER the user is selected, and not BEFORE)\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n*Scenario 1 (User custom field value):*\r\n\r\nSteps:\r\n# Create a field of type \"User Picker (multiple users)\"\"\r\n# Go to a project setting page, click on permission\r\n# Edit the permission to only grant the field created in step 1 the \"Assignable User\" permission\r\n !Scenario1_AssignPermission.png|thumbnail! \r\n# Create an issue within this project\r\n# Select a group in the field created in step 1\r\n# Click on the assignee field and notice that any user from the entire JIRA instance can be selected\r\n !Scenario1_IssueCreation1.png|thumbnail! \r\n# Try to click on the \"Create\" button and notice that JIRA is displaying an error saying that the issue can't be assigned to the selected user\r\n !Scenario1_IssueCreation2.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\n*Scenario 2 (with Group custom field value):*\r\n\r\nSteps:\r\n# Create a field of type \"Group Picker (single group)\" or \"Select List (single choice)\"\r\n# Go to a project setting page, click on permission\r\n# Edit the permission to only grant the field created in step 1 the \"Assignable User\" permission\r\n !Scenario2_AssignPermission.png|thumbnail! \r\n# Create an issue within this project\r\n# Select a group in the field created in step 1\r\n# Click on the assignee field and notice that any user from the entire JIRA instance can be selected\r\n !Scenario2_IssueCreation1.png|thumbnail! \r\n# Try to click on the \"Create\" button and notice that JIRA is displaying an error saying that the issue can't be assigned to the selected user\r\n !Scenario2_IssueCreation2.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\n\r\nh3.

Expected Results\r\n\r\nNon assignabe users should not show up in the Assignee field.\r\n\r\nh3. Notes\r\n\r\nThis appears to only occur during *Issue Creation*.

If at some point progress abnormally stops before the job is complete, then job will be stuck for whole cluster. \r\nThe stuck job is stored in an in-memory cache and is replicated to other nodes when they start. All nodes must be shutdown at the same time in order for this job to be removed from cache.\r\n\r\nh3. Environment\r\n* JIRA DataCenter with 2+ nodes\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Performs change that causes \"Bulk Operation\" action \r\n# Monitor \"Bulk Operation Progress\" bar. \r\n# Restart the node executing job (or create database connection failure)\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n* Progress bar appears in stuck state on each node. \r\n** A restart of one node has no impact, progress bar continues to appear.\r\n* The stuck job appears when trying to make other changes. Other changes cannot be made while this is stuck.\r\n* All nodes must be shutdown at the same time in order for this job to be removed from cache.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nEither:\r\n* JIRA cluster detects the job is no longer progressing, throws an error, and no longer shows the stuck \"Bulk Operation Progress\" bar.\r\n*  Or JIRA cluster detects the job is no longer progressing and continues the job\r\n\r\nIn either case, a stuck job on one node _does not require restart of entire cluster_\r\n\r\nh3. Notes\r\n* A stuck bulk edit can be reproduced by setting a breakpoint to stop thread on {{BulkEditOperation.java}} line 184.\r\n* The bulk edit task is in memory and is communicated to all nodes.\r\n* Nodes will keep this task in memory until it is deleted, or all nodes are down (clearing tasks in memory)\r\n** Task is deleted when the operation is complete.

Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Create a custom field select list - multi select\r\n# Have a few option available under the custom field you just created\r\n# Go back to the custom field configuration, under _Edit Default value_\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nThe default _None_ option is available\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nThe default _None_ option is not available\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n(!) This workaround will need to be reapplied after upgrading Jira (as it edits a Velocity Template). You should ensure you have a backup of this file, and test these changes before applying to production:\r\n\r\n# Edit {{$jira-install/atlassian-jira/WEB-INF/classes/templates/plugins/fields/edit/edit-multiselect.vm}}\r\n# Find the following:\r\n{code}\r\n#if ( !$isFrotherControl && $fieldLayoutItem && $fieldLayoutItem.required == false)\r\n   <option value=\"-1\"#if (!$selectedValues || $selectedValues.empty || $selectedValues.contains(\"-1\")) selected=\"selected\"#end>${i18n.getText('common.words.none')}</option>\r\n#end\r\n{code}\r\n# Edit the {{if}} condition, so it looks like this:\r\n{code}\r\n#if ( !$isFrotherControl && $fieldLayoutItem.required == false)\r\n    <option value=\"-1\"#if (!$selectedValues || $selectedValues.empty || $selectedValues.contains(\"-1\")) selected=\"selected\"#end>${i18n.getText('common.words.none')}</option>\r\n#end\r\n{code}\r\n# Restart Jira for the changes to take effect\r\n\r\n(i) It's important to note that this will not affect fields that have are required. While it is possible to remove the condition entirely, doing so would negatively affect multi selects in large instances - this strikes the best balance between usability without breaking the UI.\r\n\r\nIf you select \"None\" that will unset the value in the database - i.e, Jira will not set it. This means that the field will not show if the value is not set, nor will that issue be found in database queries. If you need to see the \"None\" value explicitly set, consider adding an additional option to the custom field.\r\n\r\n h3. Notes\r\nThe _None_ option is showing as the default option under the Create issue screen",

We should have two different options upon import: \"Issue ID\"  - a value that will only be used within that import process to link issues; and \"External Issue ID\" for when users want to map the ID that came from the source system.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\nTry to import a file containing the following data twice, mapping \"id\" to \"Issue ID\" and \"parent id\" to \"Parent ID\".\r\n{code:none|borderStyle=solid|borderColor=#6A8EB3|bgColor=#F8F8F8}\r\nid,parent id,summary\r\n1,,\"Test\"\r\n,1,\"Test sub-task\"\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nThe value set on \"Issue ID\" will be replicated to the \"External Issue ID\" value of the issue with summary \"Test\". Upon a new import, it will skip that issue and register the following on the import log:\r\n\r\n{code:none|borderStyle=solid|borderColor=#6A8EB3|bgColor=#F8F8F8}\r\nExternal issue 1 already exists as PROJ-1, not importing.\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\nFind a unique value to use in that field. You may use the below database query to make it easier.\r\n\r\n{code:sql|borderStyle=solid|borderColor=#6A8EB3|bgColor=#F8F8F8}\r\nSELECT * FROM customfieldvalue WHERE customfield IN (SELECT id FROM customfield WHERE cfname = 'External issue ID');\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nor delete the External issue ID field after each import.",

Summary\r\n{{CachingTaggingAvatarStore}} is doing a removal (and thus a replicated event) on every read request. \r\n\r\n\r\nFrom Chris Fuller comment on this [Answers thread|https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/43566119/what-jira-operations-cause-synchronous-activity-in-rmisynchronouscachereplicator], we have a piece of code we can make it better (point 2).\r\n\r\n{quote}\r\nChris Fuller Oct 25, 2016\r\n\r\nThis particular cache is doing a removal (and thus a replicated event) on every read request, which is just plain dumb.  \r\ncom.atlassian.jira.avatar.CachingTaggingAvatarStore#getByIdTagged\r\n{code:java}\r\n@Override\r\npublic Avatar getByIdTagged(final Long avatarId) {\r\n    try {\r\n        return taggedAvatars.get(avatarId, () -> tagAndRetrieve(avatarId)).orElse(null);\r\n    } finally {\r\n        avatars.remove(avatarId);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n{code}\r\n \r\nThat `remove` probably isn't necessary at all.  The point is that once an avatar is \"tagged\" with the metadata that confirms it came from JIRA, we don't need to hold onto the untagged version of it anymore.  But on a cache hit, that untagged one is already gone, so the remove on the untagged avatar is just wasteful.  It could be moved inside the loading function or possibly removed altogether, depending on what the surrounding code does (I didn't dig in further than that).\r\n{quote} \r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Load URL: /secure/projectavatar?pid=<P_ID>&amp;avatarId=<A_ID>\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n{{com.atlassian.jira.avatar.CachingTaggingAvatarStore.getByIdTagged}} should not perform removal (and thus a replicated event) on every read request.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n{{com.atlassian.jira.avatar.CachingTaggingAvatarStore.getByIdTagged}} removes _avatarId_ from {{avatars}} cache on every read. \r\n \r\nThread dumps from customer instances have shown where multiple threads are waiting on cache replication resulting from {{getByIdTagged}} > {{ehcache.Cache.remove}}.

      "description": "h3. Summary\r\n\r\nIf a user has several user accounts on his JIRA with similar names, for example, lots of users with surname \"Xu\", he struggles to find users on Reporter's user-picker dropdown search field as the field shows \"Showing 20 of 120 matching users\" but scrolling down to see users past the first twenty nothing happens. Searching for the user's name, username or e-mail doesn't have any effect at all and the field still shows only the first matching users and doesn't allow to scroll down further.\r\nh3. How to reproduce\r\n\r\nThe instance has 120 users with \"Xu\" as a surname, for example. You want to find the user the user \"Xu Xu\", username \"xu.xu\", e-mail \"xu.xu@test.com\".\r\n # Go to any issue, click to choose a Reporter\r\n # Write \"Xu Xu\" > It will filter all 120 users that have their surname Xu, instead of the specific user. The user can't scroll down to find the correct user as \"Xu Xu\" is in the 117th position of the search, and the list only show the first 20.\r\n # Write \"xu.xu\", the same behaviour happens\r\n # Write \"xu.xu@test.com\", same behaviour happens\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nThe workaround on this case is to type the user's username \"xu.xu\" and click outside, anywhere out of the dropdown list. It will select the correct user then.\r\n\r\n *{color:#ff0000}(!) NOTE:{color}* Workaround for Jira Software and Jira Core only - Does not apply to Jira Service Desk. In Service Desk, the users can be added to the request via \"Share\" request.",

Steps to Reproduce\r\n * Setup JIRA Data Center with 2 nodes\r\n * For one node, modifying the {{cluster.properties}}, add an extra space at the end of the path for {{jira.shared.home}}\r\n * Save, complete JDC setup\r\n * Add attachments to node 1\r\n * Now access node 2 and notice that the attachment is unavailable.\r\n\r\nh5. Expected Behaviour\r\n\r\nSimilar to the {{jira-application.properties}}, JIRA should trim trailing white spaces\r\nh5. Actual Results\r\n\r\nNodes are using different shared home paths, thus they are unable to access data from the shared home that other nodes have stored.\r\n * You'll also notice the extra space in startup following in startup:\r\n{code:java}\r\n         Attachment Path                               : /Users/dchan/atlassian/jira728dc/shared-home /data/attachments\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nh5.
