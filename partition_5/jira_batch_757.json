[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-34927].\n  {panel}\n\nI would like to re-open this issue as the current behaviour seems counterintuitive.\r\n\r\nIf Jira want to support it's use as a ticketting tool, then this is clearly something that would add value to Jira.\r\n\r\nIn some cases users go to great length to create emails that contain multiple screenshots to document their case. Yet Jira decouples the images from the email content and adds them as attachment.\r\nSince the email handler creates the attachments from the received email (and thus knows the filenames of all created attachments) it can easily insert these filenames in the comment or description it creates from the email.\r\n\r\nIn this way the issues created through email do not loose their meaning as they sometimes do now.\r\n\r\n--- original text from cloned issue ---\r\n\r\nComments left when attaching a file are usually specifically for that attachment.  The way Jira separates the attachment from the comment on the ticket is confusing and many times makes the comment less effective.  I've started to make it a habit to always include a link to the attachment at the beginning of my comment to maintain the connection between the two (using the \\[\\^attachment.ext\\] syntax).\r\n\r\nIs there any way to make this a default behavior for all attachment comments?  In other words, make the final comment a concatenation of \"attachment link\" and \"attachment comment\".  For example:\r\n\r\n{noformat}\r\n[^screenshot.png]\r\n\r\nHere's a screenshot of the issue I'm seeing.\r\n{noformat}",

You can close it by clicking the x, but it comes right back every time a ticket page is opened.\r\n \r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n# Open an issue and clear the popup.\r\n# Go to the admin section.\r\n# Go back to that issue.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nThe popup doesn't appear.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nThe popup comes back and doesn't want to vanish.\r\n\r\nh3. Notes\r\n\r\nThere are some other ways to make the popup keep coming back.

Summary\r\n\r\nIn this bug, a read timeout exception is thrown before the timeout has passed, as can be seen in the logs below:\r\n{noformat}\r\n2014-01-29 07:36:47,601 QuartzScheduler_Worker-2 INFO ServiceRunner     [atlassian.crowd.directory.DbCachingRemoteDirectory] synchronisation for directory [ 10000 ] starting\r\n2014-01-29 07:36:57,975 QuartzScheduler_Worker-2 INFO ServiceRunner     [atlassian.crowd.directory.DbCachingRemoteDirectory] failed synchronisation complete for directory [ 10000 ] in [ 10374ms ]\r\n2014-01-29 07:36:58,084 QuartzScheduler_Worker-2 ERROR ServiceRunner     [atlassian.crowd.directory.DbCachingDirectoryPoller] Error occurred while refreshing the cache for directory [ 10000 ].\r\ncom.atlassian.crowd.exception.OperationFailedException: org.springframework.ldap.CommunicationException: avengers-the-initiative.net:389; nested exception is javax.naming.CommunicationException: avengers-the-initiative.net:389 [Root exception is java.net.SocketTimeoutException: connect timed out]\r\n\tat com.atlassian.crowd.directory.SpringLDAPConnector.pageSearchResults(SpringLDAPConnector.java:400)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.crowd.directory.SpringLDAPConnector.searchEntitiesWithRequestControls(SpringLDAPConnector.java:435)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.crowd.directory.MicrosoftActiveDirectory.findTombstonesSince(MicrosoftActiveDirectory.java:882)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.crowd.directory.MicrosoftActiveDirectory.findUserTombstonesSince(MicrosoftActiveDirectory.java:824)\r\n{noformat}\r\nh3. Expected Behaviour\r\n\r\nThe LDAP connection does not timeout before the *Read Timeout (seconds)* is reached in the User Directory Configuration, for example [Connecting to an LDAP Directory|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Connecting+to+an+LDAP+Directory#ConnectingtoanLDAPDirectory-ServerSettings].\r\nh3. Actual Behaviour\r\n\r\nThe connection times out before the *Read Timeout (seconds)* interval is met.\r\nh3. Verification\r\n\r\nReview when the synchronisation started in the logs, for example in the below snippet it's {{07:36:47,601}}:\r\n{noformat}\r\n2014-01-29 07:36:47,601 QuartzScheduler_Worker-2 INFO ServiceRunner     [atlassian.crowd.directory.DbCachingRemoteDirectory] synchronisation for directory [ 10000 ] starting\r\n{noformat}\r\nAnd compare that to when the timeout occurs:\r\n{noformat}\r\n2014-01-29 07:36:58,084 QuartzScheduler_Worker-2 ERROR ServiceRunner     [atlassian.crowd.directory.DbCachingDirectoryPoller] Error occurred while refreshing the cache for directory [ 10000 ].\r\ncom.atlassian.crowd.exception.OperationFailedException: org.springframework.ldap.CommunicationException: avengers-the-initiative.net:389; nested exception is javax.naming.CommunicationException: avengers-the-initiative.net:389 [Root exception is java.net.SocketTimeoutException: connect timed out]\r\n{noformat}\r\nHere we can see the timeout occurred at {{07:36:58,084}} which is around 11 seconds, and the *Read Timeout (seconds)* was set to 60. It's highly likely this is a result of the Java bug. If the timeout occurs after the interval, this is normal and expected behaviour. For example if the timeout occurred at {{07:37:47,684}} this would be expected behaviour.\r\nh3. Cause\r\n\r\nThis bug is triggered randomly in some environments, when the Read Timeout field in LDAP directory properties has been set to non-zero value.\r\n\r\nThis bug is caused by a known [bug (#6968459)|http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=6968459] affecting Java SE.\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nNormally these exceptions can be safely ignored as the synchronisation is self-correcting. That is, problems encountered in one synchronisation round will get fixed in the following synchronisation round.\r\n\r\nIf the synchronisation fails to complete successfully repeatedly, a known workaround is to disable read timeout by setting the Read Timeout field in LDAP directory properties to 0. A side-effect of this change is that Crowd will not be able to recover automatically from LDAP requests that take too long to run, which might cause Crowd to stop communicating with LDAP directories until it is restarted.\r\nh4. For JIRA 6.3.x customers\r\n\r\nIf you have confirmed that you are experiencing the aforementioned Java bug, we have developed a temporary fix until Oracle fixes the issue in the JDK itself.\r\n\r\nThis is in the form of 2 JARs, a [new version of Crowd for JIRA|https://maven.atlassian.com/service/local/repositories/atlassian-public/content/com/atlassian/crowd/crowd-ldap/2.8.0-OD-6-JIRA-06/crowd-ldap-2.8.0-OD-6-JIRA-06.jar] and a [patched+shaded version of the JDK's LDAP JNDI provider|https://maven.atlassian.com/3rdparty/shaded/atlassian/com/sun/jndi/ldap/atlassian-ldap-jndi-provider/1.8.1-atlassian/atlassian-ldap-jndi-provider-1.8.1-atlassian.jar].\r\n\r\nSource for the patched+shaded version of the JDK's LDAP JNDI provider is available at [https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-ldap-jndi-provider]\r\n\r\nTo install these files and apply them as a workaround:\r\n - Stop yourJIRA instance\r\n - Navigate to JIRA's {{webapp/WEB-INF/lib}} directory.\r\n - Replace the existing `crowd-ldap-???.jar` with [crowd-ldap-2.8.0-OD-6-JIRA-06.jar|https://maven.atlassian.com/service/local/repositories/atlassian-public/content/com/atlassian/crowd/crowd-ldap/2.8.0-OD-6-JIRA-06/crowd-ldap-2.8.0-OD-6-JIRA-06.jar]\r\n - Add the [atlassian-ldap-jndi-provider-1.8.1-atlassian.jar|https://maven.atlassian.com/3rdparty/shaded/atlassian/com/sun/jndi/ldap/atlassian-ldap-jndi-provider/1.8.1-atlassian/atlassian-ldap-jndi-provider-1.8.1-atlassian.jar] file to this directory as well.\r\n - Start your JIRA instance.\r\n\r\n*IMPORTANT*: This will only work if the you are running Java 8 and a version of JIRA that uses crowd-ldap-2.8.0-OD-6 or compatible (JIRA 6.3.x)",
