I've set up a change control workflow which people are now using but that I've now realised has a bug - if changes are 're-opened', approvers who approved changes the first time round can't re-approve them.\r\n\r\nThe basic question is - is there a way of preventing a use from making a workflow transition when I have their username / userid stored in a custom field?  Sounds so simple, but I can't seem to do it.\r\n\r\nThe issue is described in much more detail below for those with the patience - a resolution would be very much appreciated!!\r\n\r\nEdmund. \r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n> Hi guys,\r\n> Essentially, we have set up a workflow that doesn't work, but we've only just realised it and it's now being used which is why I've said it is impacting the business.\r\n> I want a way of being able to prevent a user from performing a workflow transition when their username is stored in a custom field.  This is to do with an approval system - we have issues that require any three people from a group of 10 to approve something and we don't want the same person to approve it more than once.\r\n> I was happy that we'd solved this using the 'JIRA Misc Workflow Extensions' plugin.  This has a 'Separation of Duties Condition' module that allows me to stop someone performing a workflow transition if they have previously moved the workflow from one state to another.  I used it to say 'if user has previously moved workflow from status 'pending approval' to status 'pending approval' (ie. if they were the first or second approver), don't let them make this second (or third and final) approval step.  \r\n> This worked well, but what I forgot to think about is that post approval, a change can be re-opened for various reasons, forcing people to change details and submit it for approval again.  I now find that approvers who have previously approved a change can no longer re-approve it.\r\n> A work around is to force people to clone changes rather than re-approve them, but this means we lose the change history.\r\n> I actually think it should be a very simple thing to do.  When someone performs a workflow transition, put their username (using the %%CURRENT_USER%% function / variable) into a custom field.  I then just need to check the second time round that their user name isn't in the 'first approver' custom field.\r\n> I've tried to do this using the 'Value Field' condition.  ie. User can only perform a second approval if 'Approver 1' custom field != %%CURRENT_USER%%, but this doesn't work.  I think the 'Value Field' condition can't be compatible with %%CURRENT_USER%% (ie. I guess it just sees the string %%CURRENT_USER%% rather than a variable) - is this the case?  \r\n> There is another condition, called 'User is in Custom Field', using which I can force only the person who approved the first time to be able to approve the second time, so it seems the logic is really simple!  It's just that I need the reverse of this - ie. the ability in the list of conditions to say 'and NOT this condition', but I can't seem to do that either.\r\n> If you could show me how to achieve this, you'd help sort what's becoming quite a reasonably big problem for me!  \r\n\r\n> Many thanks,\r\n> Edmund Heyes.\r\n",

One of the first things I look for are any third party plugins the user may have installed. It would save a lot of time if in the system information could distinguish what the User added vs. what is installed by default. This was a lot easier in the past because we generally just had \"Atlassian\" plugins installed by default. However, now with JQL and Gadgets, it seems there are non Atlassian plugins installed by default. Can we please have some separation in the system information so that we can tell the difference between default and non default plugins faster. My current workaround is to have a text document with the default plugins from a clean instance, then make a new text document with the clients system information for each case. I then diff the files. Can we please implement this feature for support.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nJon ",

The caching size is roughly #projects * #users * #security_levels. The security_level is actually copied each time it appears in the cache (i.e. if the \"test\" level is visible by 5 users, then there will be 5 copies of the level in the cache).\r\n\r\nh5.

As we step up Crowd's support to use our LDAP server for internal users (as opposed open-source users), that will mean we will need to have multiple directories in Crowd that JIRA is delegating to, which means we will have to turn \"user management\" to external in JIRA.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, with external user management set, there will be no good way for users to enter JIRA and be told how to create an account.  And worse, the \"log in\" screen tells them to notify an administrator!  I don't want to get emails (or suffer the other administrators to emails) from users in the world that just want to create an account.\r\n\r\nJIRA needs to be able to you specify URLs where users can go to create or modify an account, so that it can continue to work seamlessly with Crowd integrated & external user management turned on.",

I agree that the Favourite Filters portlet performs well as of 3.13.  \r\n\r\nThe ManageFilters screen and the FilterPickerPopup window launched from portlet configuration are still very slow.  Our Manage Filters screen takes about 15 seconds to load. It takes about 45 seconds to load the My tab in Manage Filters. The Filter Picker Popup takes about 15 seconds to load as well...until I disabled the issue count column in the JSP...after which it loads instantly.\r\n\r\nAnd in JRA-8106, Vincent notes that he encounters similar some performance problems with Issue Filer Management which are not related to JRA-16959. He writes, {quote} In our instance, as Administrator, I am able to see many Filters (8 filters per Project and more than 200 projects).\r\nDue to theses figures, in JIRA 3.10, I did use any more the Filter Portlet.\r\nSince JIRA 3.13.x, I encounter the same performance problems, for the Portlet (normal !) but also for the ManageFilters page.\r\nIt appears a priori that each filter is systematically executed in order to provide the Issue count.\r\n\r\nMay we consider an enhancement of these two features (Portlet and ManageFilters page), where Issue count are calculated periodically and stored in order to have the figures as estimate values, but not systematically recalculated. {quote} ",

      "description": "Hi,\r\n\r\nThis seems to be a bug with JIRA: I added 2 \"Select List\" custom fields to the \"Resolve Issue\" screen for a group of projects. For each field, I created two contexts, because one of the projects requires a different set of options. In both fields, I set default values for the second context, but the problem is that the default value is not automatically selected in the \"Resolve Issue\" screen.\r\n\r\nThe funny thing is that I have another \"Select List\" field in the same screen; this field is configured only with the default context, and also has a default value set, which is automatically selected when I enter the screen. Looks like the issue is present only when a custom field has more than one context.\r\n\r\nPlease take a look at the attached document, which contains screenshots describing the issue with more detail. Have you ever detected this behavior? Is this something that might have been solved in newer versions of JIRA? This turned to be a little critical for me, because I was working on a request to set default values for the two fields described above (as the easiest approach), and it's getting more difficult than normal.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for your comments,\r\nGERMAN",

      "description": "Hi guys,\r\nA request.  Is there a way I can notify someone (via a notification scheme) when an issue is commented on but only when it is in a certain status?\r\n\r\nMy example is someone raising a change - they create the change, it gets commented on various times, and then they submit it for approval.  Several people need to approve the change, and whilst it is in the Pending Approval stage I would like to notify these change approvers of any extra comments, since someone who has approved a change could change their mind and reject it depending on a comment (whilst not having emailed them on the previous comments).  \r\n\r\nI thought that I could hide the 'Comment' button from the 'Operations' list and create a workflow Comment button instead.  I could use workflow conditions to have two Comment buttons with only one shown depending on the status.\r\n\r\nThe problem is, of course, that my only way of removing the Operations 'Comment' is by removing permission to comment, which then destroys my workflow 'Comment' buttons.  So I have to live with having an Operations Comment button and a workflow action Comment button at the same time, which is confusing to the user.\r\n\r\nAny hints and tips would be appreciated.  My workaround is to call the Workflow Action Comment 'Comment and Notify Approvers' so hopefully users can surmise the difference.",

Brazil is different from Australia in that DST takes effect at Midnight.\r\n\r\nThe problem with the date picker only occurs when:\r\n* The time component is set to Midnight (i.e. its a date-only picker, or a date-time picker with the time set to Midnight)\r\n* There is already a value set for the component",
