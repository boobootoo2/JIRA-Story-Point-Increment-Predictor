      "description": "I added the following info into a Confluence issue on CPU usage. We have very high CPU usage and database logical IO, and suspect that this may be the cause. They asked us to post this to JIRA, so here it is.\r\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\r\n\r\nPlease take a look at the spreadsheet I just attached (20071129 Parameterized Queries.xls). That shows summary information for all the parameterized queries that ran last night. For each distinct query, it shows how many times it ran, and how much system recourses it took over the night. This was for the time period 5:30 PM last night (Nov 28) to 7:00 AM this morning (Nov 29). \r\n\r\nThe top two queries jump out at me big time.\r\n- The first one ran over 5,000 times, taking almost 2.25 hours total time to run these queries. \r\n- The second one ran almost 4.5 MILLION times. Amazing. The query is actually pretty small, and has a cumulative time of only 5 or 6 minutes. \r\n\r\nRegarding the first query, our DBA says it is not optimized for performance. It only has one join condition, but multiple OR conditions in the WHERE clause. These OR conditions are killing performance. The DBA says it would be much better to have several queries with simple WHERE clauses (which will use the indexes properly) with a UNION to combine the results. Is there a way this query can be optimized?\r\n\r\nRegarding the second query, even though it's REALLY fast (taking only a few minutes total over the night even though it ran so many times), executing ANYTHING 4.5 million times seems to be a very possible candidate for our CPU problem. Do you know what this query is, and why it's running so many times?\r\n\r\nQuestions -\r\n1 - Can we modfiy the SQL of that first query somehow in the code?\r\n2 - Why is that other query running so many times? What is it? Is this our CPU problem?\r\n\r\nI think the DBA is suggesting that the SQL be modified to the following:\r\n\r\nSELECT columns...\r\nFROM tables...\r\nWHERE children0_.PARENTID= Parameter_1\r\nUNION\r\nSELECT columns...\r\nFROM tables...\r\nWHERE children0_.PARENTID= Parameter_2\r\nUNION\r\nSELECT columns...\r\nFROM tables...\r\nWHERE children0_.PARENTID= Parameter_3\r\n\r\nOf course, the followup question is, why are these queries getting fired at all, and why so many times?\r\n\r\nEric",

      "description": "If there is a slow network connection between web browser and the box running JIRA, and if the JIRA instance has many projects (of the order of 100 or more), and if the user has the Projects Portlet on their dashboard, then the dashboard does not display in Internet Explorer 6 and 7. It works fine in Firefox.\r\n\r\nThe browser (Internet Explorer) renders the header - the logo and the Home | Browse Projects | Find Issues | Create New Issue, but then not the rest of the dashboard page.\r\n\r\nThe browser appears to try to reload the page a few times. This is apparent because the page briefly flashes and the \"Waiting for <URL>\" text at the bottom of the browser seems to redisplay. Sometimes there is first a \"Website found. Waiting for reply.\" message briefly displayed in the message window at the bottom of the browser. The browser tries this several times, sometimes for 30 seconds or so, sometimes for several minutes, before finally giving up, displaying a popup window saying:\r\n\r\n    Internet Explorer cannot open the Internet site <URL>.\r\n    Operation aborted.\r\n\r\nThis behaviour is readily reproducible using a local import of http://developer.atlassian.com/jira and using [TCPMon|http://ws.apache.org/commons/tcpmon/] to simulate a slow network connection. Use the following delay settings in TCPMon:\r\n\r\n    Bytes per pause: 1024\r\n    Delay in Milliseconds: 50\r\n\r\nThe behaviour is also readily observable on http://developer.atlassian.com/jira (if you add the Projects Portlet to your dashboard, or create a new dashboard page containing the Projects Portlet). The problem was previously reported by two (separate) support customers. In their cases it only appears on slow links. \r\n\r\nThe behaviour is not observable on the local import of http://developer.atlassian.com/jira if you do not use the delay.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note that at the times when the browser seems to be trying to reload the page, the shell running TCPMon displays the following error:\r\n{noformat}\r\njava.net.SocketException: Broken pipe\r\n        at java.net.SocketOutputStream.socketWrite0(Native Method)\r\n        at java.net.SocketOutputStream.socketWrite(SocketOutputStream.java:92)\r\n        at java.net.SocketOutputStream.write(SocketOutputStream.java:136)\r\n        at org.apache.ws.commons.tcpmon.SocketRR.run(SocketRR.java:213)\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nMicrosoft has a bug report for the above error message: http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx/kb/927917. However that bug relates to Javascript, specifically to when a child container HTML element contains script code that tries to modify the parent container element of the child container. It is unlikely that this bug is the cause of our error, as you can turn off Javascript in IE and comment out all Javascript and links to Javascript files in the served page, and the error still occurs.\r\n\r\nWe tried saving the static page back on the server (do a View Source in Firefox after the page is successfully displayed, then save it back to the server), and then accessing it.  Same error occurs.\r\n\r\nWe tried another page that is about the same size - ~900K - and it displays correctly. So the error is content specific. Perhaps it is related to nested tables?\r\n\r\nWe spent significant time trying to find the root cause and have been unable to. As there are straightforward workarounds, we will not spend any more time on it at this stage.\r\n\r\nThe workarounds are either:\r\n- Don't use the Projects Portlet in the dashboard if you have lots of projects. If you want links to projects on your dashboard, consider using the Project Table portlet instead.\r\n- Use Firefox instead of Internet Explorer.\r\n",

This is a great long time expected feature. And I think we can make it even better.\r\n\r\nLet's consider the following (I guess realistic in the way people uses Jira) scenario:\r\n\r\nMost of the initial high level estimates are made on the Parent issue. \r\nThen as the issue understanding increases, estimated subtasks are created.\r\n\r\nIn order to keep the total estimated effort coherent between the Parent and its Children, the owner of a subtask must update the Parent according to the time tracking information passed in the children. For instance, if I initially estimate a Parent issue to 5 days of effort, if I then split it in 5 subtasks of 1 day, I can decide to reduce the remaining of the Parent issue in similar proportion (otherwise I'll get 10 days in the consolidated view). \r\n\r\nThis should be an option - maybe I'll be pleased to keep a effort margin at the parent level \"in case of\".\r\n\r\nCurrently, this little process, while understood by our users, is quite cumbersome: update subtasks timetracking, than udpate parent timetracking.\r\nIt has a direct impact of the reliability of the information gathered at parent level.\r\n\r\nWe would like a shortcut in the subtask worklog screen that would allow the users to update the parent timetracking according to the children changes.\r\nSounds like a small change, but we do think it would increase the reliability of the time tracking data.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

On the last page of a bulk change process you have the options to cancel or to execute the changes. In German the \"execute\" button is named \"Wiederholen\", which means \"repeat\". I would propose changing the text on this button to \"Best\u00e4tigen\" (which means \"confirm\")\r\n\r\n2. When you chose, which action to take for the bulk change you can select \"workflow actions\", which are translated as \"\u00dcbergangsvorg\u00e4nge\". This translation is a total \"fanatsy-word\", with no meaning. As the term \"Workflow\" is now translated as \"Arbeitsablauf\" in JIRA the translationen \"Arbeitsablauf-Aktionen\" would be much better as it would be at least consistent with the translation of \"Workflow\"\r\n\r\n3. On the Issue-Navigator the word \"bulk change\" is translated as \"Mehrfaches \u00c4ndern\", which means \"Multiple Changes\", which is not really wrong, but also not a very good translation. Better would be \"Massenbearbeitung\".\r\n\r\nWould be great if you would change it in the next minor release.\r\n\r\nJust as a warning :-) I have just released JIRA 3.10.2 to the rest of our company and i expect a lot more translation-change-requests coming your way the next weeks.\r\n",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-13981].\n  {panel}\n\n{panel:title=Atlassian Status as of 29 October 2012|borderStyle=solid|borderColor=#3C78B5| titleBGColor=#3C78B5| bgColor=#E7F4FA}\r\nHi All,\r\n\r\nGood news! We have addressed the original improvement request provided in the description of this issue, in JIRA 5.2. Users now have the ability to edit a workflow scheme on a project - a draft is created, and the migration is handled through the normal migration process. Functionality that has been provided:\r\n* Add existing workflows\r\n* Remove workflows from scheme\r\n* Reassign issue types between workflows in the scheme\r\n* Publish draft\r\n* Discard draft\r\n\r\nYou can read all about the new improvements in the latest [JIRA EAP release notes|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/JIRA+5.2+EAP+4+(m6)+Release+Notes].\r\n\r\nThis functionality works if you have a 1:1 mapping between a project and a workflow scheme. I understand that this does not fulfil the functionality discussed in [JRA-5254], which is also mentioned in the comments on this issue. *We understand this and are actively addressing* [JRA-5254] - unfortunately it is not a part of JIRA 5.2.\r\n\r\nGoing forward, I will be resolving this issue when JIRA 5.2 is released in the coming weeks, and leaving [JRA-5254] open until that is fully addressed and workflow schemes can be edited when they are associated with more than one project.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or concerns feel free to contact me directly.\r\n\r\nThanks for your understanding,\r\nJosh Devenny\r\nJIRA Product Management\r\njdevenny at atlassian dot com\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginal Description\r\n--------------------\r\n\r\nSo the current process is:\r\n  1) Create a workflow with all steps etc\r\n  2) Create workflow scheme, assigning issue types to workflows\r\n  3) Configure project to use the new workflow\r\n  4) Realise that you've forgotton something\r\n  5) swear\r\n  6) Copy Workflow - making required changes\r\n  7) Copy workflow scheme\r\n  8) Delete all assigned workflows in copied scheme\r\n  9) Assign issue types to new workflows\r\n  10) Configure project to use new workflow\r\n\r\n.. And then there's the clean up stage where you delete the previous workflow scheme and workflow.\r\n\r\nI've rarely seen changes to the workflow scheme once it's been configured, so it's just extra work to reconfigure the scheme for the new adjusted workflow.",
