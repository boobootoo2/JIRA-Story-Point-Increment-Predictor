[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSDSERVER-4551].\r\n  {panel}\r\n\r\nh3. Context\r\n\r\nSince [04 Jul 2016|https://confluence.atlassian.com/cloud/what-s-new-686863216.html#What'sNew-servicedesk], SD Agents can now always create customer accounts in all JIRA Service Desk Cloud instances:\r\n{quote}Agents can add new customers to a service desk regardless of how request permissions are configured. Agents can add new customers by inviting them from the Customers page, raising a request on their behalf, or adding them as request participants on an email request. Previously, agents could only add new customers to the service desk when the request security was set to 'anyone can create a customer account'.\r\n{quote}\r\nThis has been a great\u00a0feature.\r\nh3. Problem definition\r\n\r\nAccounts\u00a0created by Agents from the Customers page use the email as the value of:\r\n # customer's email\r\n # customer's username\r\n # customer's full name\r\n\r\nTherefore:\r\n * Agents frequently don't know their customer names because\u00a0they couldn't store the user's full name on issue creation.\r\n * Usernames are too long strings, so customers\u00a0cannot login with shorter credentials.\r\n * Customers cannot share tickets with\u00a0other users within their organization by typing their names.\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested solution\r\n\r\nBuild a way in which Agents can also set appropriate usernames & full names on account creation from the Customers page.\r\nh3. Related previous suggestion\r\n\r\nThere's already a previous similar suggestion,\u00a0created before 04 Jul 2016, on which the request of change had a much more limited context, as it only affected when the request security was set to 'anyone can create a customer account':\u00a0JSD-1197\r\n\r\nHowever, the scope change in the context makes JSD-1197\u00a0an obsolete request on Cloud instances, as now it forcibly applies to every Service Desk project in all Cloud instances.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n(!) This workaround applies while creating the customer, it is still not possible to edit the existing customers.\r\nUse our [Create Customer API|https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/service-desk/rest/#api-rest-servicedeskapi-customer-post] to create your customers and set their user names:\r\n{code:html}\r\ncurl --request POST \\\r\n  --url 'https://<YourSite>.atlassian.net/rest/servicedeskapi/customer' \\\r\n  -u \"email:token\"\\\r\n  --header 'Accept: application/json' \\\r\n  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\r\n  --data '{\r\n  \"displayName\": \"Test customer\",\r\n  \"email\": \"test@test.com\"\r\n}'\r\n{code}\r\n* After adding the customer using the API above, *if the project is private*, you must go to the customer's page > add customer and invite them again. The API above will add them to the instance, but not to the private projects.\r\n",

Problem Definition\nThe current implementation of approvals either requires all of the approvers to provide their approval, or a fixed number out of a set of users.\nIn certain organisations, approval responsibility does not reside with individuals, but with groups (read, departments within the organisation).\nA requirement in such an organisation could be, that in order for an approval to go through, multiple groups are required to provide their approval.\nFrom within those groups, there are separate sets of users that can provide approval, though each group only requires to provide an \"x\" amount of approvals.\nh3. Suggested Solution\nAdd an additional option in the current approval feature.\nThe \"Get approvers from\" option should not only work off a multi user picker custom field, but also a multi group picker custom field.\nThe \"Consider approved after\" option should allow for a configuration where a number of approvers per group can be set, next to the \"all\" option as currently available.\nh3. Why this is important\nChange management can rely on multiple departments within an organisation prior to changes being allowed to get pushed through.\nThe current implementation of the approval feature does not allow for a differentiation of user groups, reflecting these different departments within the organisation.\u00a0\nh3. Workaround\u00a0\nInstead of having multiple groups required to approve a request in a single step, it is possible to make several statuses and approvals per status moving the approval process from one department to another.\nThis is a very linear approach, and could prove to cause (several) bottlenecks to occur within the change process when one department is quicker to approve than another.",

There may be an opportunity to improve performance here by making cache replication asynchronous instead, but that could also cause instability if parts of the system don't respond as well to eventual consistency semantics, so it would need a lot of testing.\n\n# This particular cache is doing a removal (and thus a replicated event) on every read request, which is just plain dumb.  You should report this to support.  The nasty code is this (from CachingTaggingAvatarStore):\n\n{code:java}\n@Override\npublic Avatar getByIdTagged(final Long avatarId) {\n    try {\n        return taggedAvatars.get(avatarId, () -> tagAndRetrieve(avatarId)).orElse(null);\n    } finally {\n        avatars.remove(avatarId);\n    }\n}\n{code}\n \nThat `remove` probably isn't necessary at all.  The point is that once an avatar is \"tagged\" with the metadata that confirms it came from JIRA, we don't need to hold onto the untagged version of it anymore.  But on a cache hit, that untagged one is already gone, so the remove on the untagged avatar is just wasteful.  It could be moved inside the loading function or possibly removed altogether, depending on what the surrounding code does (I didn't dig in further than that).\n{quote} \n",

In this case, when accessing SD-1 via its Portal URL it says the request has been moved to a project which you have no access. This is because there's no Portal URL for NSD-2 to be redirected to.\n\nh4. +Suggestion+\nTheoretically this is a correct message. However, if NSD is open to Anonymous access, then it would be better if JIRA or SD could detect this and redirect SD-1 to the JIRA URL of NSD-2, which will be accessible by any Anonymous user.\n\nh4. +Note+\nWhen it comes to Anonymous, this should be tracked closely with JSD-4467.",

The reason for this diagram is just as valid in a SD world as in SW:\u00a0it is\u00a0useful for identifying bottlenecks (aka a backlog).\n\nConsider the simplest form of CFD: open to closed. JSD does provide an open/closed report as a line graph. The problem with a line graph is that it's harder to get a quick visual understanding of how those numbers\u00a0affect the queue size over time. Put the same open/close rates on a CFD and you can quickly see whether the queue size is growing, shrinking, or stable. In my experience, the backlog\u00a0trend is one of the best pieces of evidence for investment in more people or process improvement efforts.\n\nWhile there are other graphical forms for backlog trending, it seems like leveraging the CFD helps SW and SD people find common ground.",

Summary\n\nCurrently, the 'Organization' field in Service Desk can be set as a required field and added to the 'Create' screen for an issue. The problem with this is that the 'Organization' selection only shows up in the Customer Portal and will not appear as a visible field in the Create screen, thus making it impossible for an admin to require an organization to be chosen, and create a Service Desk ticket through JIRA rather than the Portal.\u00a0\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\n\n1. Set 'Organization' as a required field\n\n2. Add the field to the create screen in a Service Desk project\nh3. Expected Results\n\nThe field should be visible and able to be set, or Service Desk should not allow you to set the field as required.\u00a0\nh3. Actual Results\n\nThe field will only be visible in the Customer Portal and a user will not be able to create a ticket in that project through JIRA.\nh3. Notes\u00a0\n\nThis might be intended functionality (as Organization is primarily\u00a0a contact field and is meant as an option for customers to share a ticket with their org.), but allowing it to be set as required and put into a 'Create' screen causes confusion, as the ability implies that this field can be set through JIRA\u00a0during issue creation.",

Problem Definition\n\nI would like to be able to embed our knowledge base in our customer portal so it can all be on one page, rather than a link from the portal to a separate page.\n\nThe primary goal is more visibility on what the common questions and issues are, so people can easily find the answer they are looking for *at a glance*.\n\nRequiring customers to start typing a search doesn't resolve the issue of visibility because non-technical people are often hesitant to do it and articles won't show unless the user types in the appropriate words/phrases. IF a user does't know how to properly describe the issue but would recognize it in a list of articles, they may end up getting frustrated and create an unnecessary ticket, or leave the site entirely.\nh3. Suggested Solution\n\nTo avoid having a bad user experience, I want to make the Confluence Space more readily available, such that how-to pages and FAQs are clearly listed in our Customer Portal.\n\nThus, I'd like to be able to embed our Confluence Space in the Customer Portal.\nh3. Workaround\n\nEducate users to visit Confluence first, and [configure a banner associated with the Knowledge Base space|https://confluence.atlassian.com/confkb/how-to-add-a-space-wide-banner-717062877.html] referring users to the Customer Portal if they can't find the answer to their question.",

However, they fail to take account of when an organisation operates in a location with daylight saving time. \n\nFor instance a contract may specify 9am - 6pm for support. However the server time does not change to reflect daylight saving time. Therefore for part of the year the SLA calendar will not align with the contract hours.\n\nI discussed this at Summit 2016 with Vidhu, Lingbo and Adriana.  Please contact me direct for a PoC. \n\nA partial workaround is to use the created time to determine which SLA calendar to use and define summer and winter calendars.
