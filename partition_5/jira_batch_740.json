Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n\r\n- Go to confluence and delete your jira acess token http://confluence/users/revokeoauthtokens.action\r\n- Create a new confluence page with a colon ( : ) on its name. Page url should be something like http://confluence/something/yourpagewithcolon:intherurl\r\n- In a test issue try to link that recently created confluence  page.\r\n- It'll ask you to do the login dance. Do it\r\n- Click on link button\r\n- [ BUG ] It'll prompt again to do the login dance. No matter how many times you do the dance, it won't accept the link. And it will create as much tokens for the jira instance on confluence as tries to do the dance.\r\n\r\n*Note that this only ocurrs with that particular url I've tried a clean url one https://extranet.atlassian.com/display/~scia/test and it works fine.*\r\n\r\nh2. Workaround\r\n\r\n- On the confluence page you want to link go to Tools/Page History\r\n- Click on CURRENT version link\r\n- Use that url to link to the issue. (Should be something similar to _yoursite.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=number_)",

One of the features we're really missing is a background-color for columns - depending on the status the ticket actually has.\r\n\r\nOur current workaround is the script from http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/134394\r\n\r\nI attached a screenshot how it looks like when I view all my tickets, ordered by status ASC, updated DESC.\r\n\r\nYou can see at first sight that it's much clearer what kind of tickets are open, what status they have and how many there actually are for each status. This color also affects the ticket detail page, where the status column is still colored.\r\n\r\nIt's fine for me with the script, but it is not for our customers. They don't know about the script, they don't know how to install a script, they don't want a script and - of course and most important - they shoudn't need a script.\r\n\r\nMaybe it's possible for you to implement the userscript (see link above) as a standard tool. That would be really great.\r\n\r\nAs this setting could be optional, none of the current JIRA users would have any disadvantage.\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nMartin",

Instead of not being able to view the issue data at all. Is it possible to still render the valid aspects of the issue/project data and then just show a warning error that alerts the user to the database corruption? And then prevent changes that may make the invalid data cause additional problems. Also, the full stack trace can still be hidden in a expansible panel as is already obtainable in JIRA.\r\n\r\nImplementing this perhaps may introduce more resource implications, levels of complexity and perhaps other unpredictable behaviour in the programming logic, and I mentioned this to our customer who raised it. However, I'd leave it to developers to determine what level of improvement can be made to handling issue rendering under these special circumstances.\r\n",

The base URL is used for both. This is a regression from 6.0.x, where it was possible.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\nThe current workaround is to set the BaseURL of the applications to the URL you want to create the link with, then create the link. The Application URL for both applications will be their BaseURL. You can then set the BaseURL back to the correct user-facing URL, and edit the Display URL of the application link.\r\nThis behaviour is present in Applinks 4.0. You can see the versions of our software that contain Applinks 4.0 [here|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/APPLINKS/Application+Links+Version+Matrix].\r\n\r\nh3. JIRA 6.0.x applink workflow\r\n\r\nHere's how it used to work in 6.0 and earlier (screenshots from the [Adding an Application Link|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA060/Adding+an+Application+Link] docs, which haven't been updated).\r\n\r\nFirst specify the application URL - ie. the _internal_ URL (notice the non-standard port):\r\n!https://confluence.atlassian.com/download/attachments/222724578/UAL-AddAppLink-LinkURL.png?api=v2!\r\n\r\nIn the next step, one could set the reciprocal application URL (as the docs say, \"override the base URL specified in your remote application\"):\r\n\r\n!https://confluence.atlassian.com/download/attachments/222724578/UAL-AddAppLink-LinkBack.png?api=v2!\r\n\r\nFinally, if the application URL != display URL, one could edit the applink, and set its Display URL explicitly:\r\n\r\n!configureapplink.png!\r\n\r\nh3. JIRA 6.1.x applink workflow\r\n\r\nSay we're in https://jira.mycompany.com, wishing to create an applink to http://confluence.localhost, with display URL https://confluence.mycompany.com. We fill in the URL:\r\n\r\n!jira615_applink1.png!\r\n\r\nand.. \r\n\r\n!jira615_applink2.png!\r\n\r\nJIRA has ignored the URL you entered ({{http://confluence.localhost}} ) and instead used the base URL. There is no opportunity to override this. Nor can this be first by editing the applink afterwards, as the application URL is unchangeable:\r\n\r\n!jira615_applink3.png!\r\n",

The system will count the current tickets assigned based on the filter rules for the target user, will apply the filter rules for the candidate issue and if a filter condition is matched then the count will increase for that filter. The rules will trigger and only if the user can accept the ticket the operation will be successful.\r\n\r\nIn fact the target user should not even be presented as a candidate to resolve the ticket.

Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n# Install JIRA Service Desk *1.2* and greater.\r\n# Create a new Service Desk.\r\n# Uninstall or disable it.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nThe JIRA instance does not have any problems.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nAttempting to access the instance or search throws a NPE.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\n# Stop JIRA.\r\n# Execute the below SQL on the database:\r\n{code:SQL}\r\nDELETE FROM schemepermissions \r\nWHERE  perm_type = 'sd.customer.portal.only'; \r\n{code}\r\n# Start JIRA.\r\n\r\nWith the workaround, the problem could occur again whenever Service Desk is uninstalled or disabled again. Hence the recommendation would be to upgrade JIRA to 6.2 or the latest version which has the bug fix and prevents this from happening.\r\n\r\nIf you wish to reinstall Service Desk, when new Service Desk is created it will repopulate that table.",
