Please see this [documentation|https://support.atlassian.com/jira-service-management-cloud/docs/allow-external-emails-to-be-added-as-comments-on-issues/] for more information on how to turn the feature on.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nJason and the Jira Service Management Team\r\n{panel}\r\nh3. \u00a0\r\n\r\nSummary\r\n\r\nWhen a customer of a JIRA Service Desk sends an E-mail from Service Desk to another person (who is not an agent, reporter or request participant) of the issue, if that additional party replies to the issue and includes the JIRA Service Desk E-mail, the E-mail is treated as a new issue, even though:\r\n - Subject Line contains the Issue Key,\r\n - Email Headers are still intact.\r\n\r\nFor Example:\r\n # Customer 1 raises a Service Desk request.\r\n # Agent 1 responds to the Service Desk Request.\r\n # Customer 1 receives a response and CC's the response to another Customer (Customer 2).\r\n # Customer 2 responds to the service desk request, CCing in the same people.\r\n\r\nCreating new E-mails under this scenario causes additional overhead for the Service Desk Administrator, and may be confusing to the customer interacting with the Agent, due to the fragmented nature of the E-mail interactions\r\n\r\nThis was introduced as a result of the changes in: JSD-1876 which fixed an issue when a user who was not a Service Desk customer responded to a Service Desk Email.\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Set up a new Service Desk\r\n # Create an Issue and Send a Comment to a customer as an Agent\r\n # As a customer forward the issue to a colleague to get help responding to the Agents queries\r\n # Respond to the agent, and customer as the external party.\r\n # The response will not be linked to the existing issue unless you are already a request participant of the issue.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nJIRA Service Desk should be able to detect the E-mail trail relates to a specific issue, and give the customer an option to enable Automatic request participants based on Email interactions.\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nJIRA Service Desk fails to recognise that the Emails in the aforementioned scenario relate to a pre-exiting issue, even thought the Email contains the correct headers, subject line, and the other users in To/CC fields are the customer and the Service Desk Email address.\r\nh3. Notes\r\n\r\nThe current functionality for inbound E-mail appears to be:\r\n # Check who the sender of the Email is\r\n # Add sender as a new customer if they are not (depending on SD configuration)\r\n # Decide what to do with E-mail content based on the sender's authorisation.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nPlease use either *Service Desk Automation* _or_ the *JIRA Automation Plugin* to do this.\r\n\r\n*Using JIRA Service Desk*\r\n # Go To your *Settings* under the affected JIRA Service Desk\r\n # Select *Automation\r\n # Create a new Rule and select \"Custom Rule\" with the following:\r\n ## {*}WHEN{*}: Issue Created\r\n ## {*}IF{*}: Issue Matches and Create an Advanced JQL filter\r\n ## {*}THEN{*}: _Add a Comment_ that indicates that the user is not authorised to comment on the request\r\n ## *THEN* _Issue Transition_ that Resolves the issue.\r\n\r\n*Using the Automation Add-on*\r\n # Create a new Rule\r\n # Set the Issue Event to be Issue Created\r\n # Set the JQL Expression to something S\r\n # Add Actions as to how you would like to handle this circumstance.\r\n\r\n*Note on JQL matching.*\r\nThe Affected issues are expected to contain:\r\n - Your E-mail Prefix in the Subject line of the Email\r\n - An Issue Key in the Subject line of the Email\r\n - Either a \"Re:\" or \"Fwd:\" in the Subject line of the Email.\r\n - The content should contain \"{_}This message is automatically generated by JIRA Service Desk.{_}\"\r\n\r\nTherefore we can create a JQL query to match on these issues:\r\n{code:java}\r\ntext ~ '\"This message is automatically generated by JIRA Service Desk.\"~0' \r\nAND \r\n(summary ~ \"Re \\\\[CDX\\\\] \\\\[SD\" OR summary ~\"Fwd \\\\[CDX\\\\] \\\\[SD\") \r\n{code}\r\nYou could add different options to this JQL Query as you see the need to do so, such as project filters.

Summary\nJSD-1491 describes an issue as Resolved wherein subsequent email replies to an email linked to Service Desk creation are creating duplicate SD issues.  It notes the fix version for OD as 2.4-OD-04.\n\nWe are running JIRA Service Desk v3.0.0-OD-02-001-D20150907T065544, and are still having this issue.  \n\nh3. Steps to reproduce\n# Set up SD instance using support@foo.com for customers to email, and SD issues to be auto-created\n# Customer finds issue, emails support@foo.com with subject \"Foo Is Broken\", and CC's 3 other people, SD-1 issue is created with *Foo Is Broken* title\n# One of the CC'd users replies to the email thread, including support@foo.com as a recipient, \"Re:  Foo Is Broken\" becomes subject of the email thread\n\nh3. Expected results\n* Replying person's email content from step 3 is added as a comment to the SD-1 issue, no duplicates issues are created\n\nh3. Actual results\n* Replying person's email from step 3 creates SD-2 with *Re:  Foo Is Broken* title.  SD-1 and SD-2 are not linked in any way.  Content from replied email in SD-2 is not present in SD-1 and vice versa.\n\nh3. Notes\nI'm not 100% certain, but it seems to be arising from \"Re:\" being added to the subject line of the email.  This is extremely tedious to deal with.",

When an image is attached by an internal account or by a customer, the image that shows up in the automated email is broken.\n\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\n\nSteps to Reproduce \\[bug 1\\]:\n# Create a Service Desk ticket as an agent or as a customer. Here is the portal: \n# Make sure your Agent account is the assignee. Make sure your customer account is the customer on the ticket.\n# Log in as an Agent  and navigate to the Service Desk.\n# Open that ticket on behalf of a customer for editing and go to \"More\" and select \"Attach Files\".\n# Make an external comment and attach an image to it.\n# Log into the email account associated with the customer account. You should see the email come through with a broken image for the attached email. \n\n\\[bug 2\\] The problem also happens the vice-versa direction, and presumably this is the same underlying issue:\n# Log in as a Customer  and navigate to your list of open tickets.\n# Edit the same ticket and add an image to a comment.\n# Log into the email account associated with your Agent account\n\n\\[bug 3\\] A third related problem is when you comment and add the attachment on the same time, JIRA doesn't recognize that it exists when it sends the email, so the email contains an error message for the attachments, saying it doesn't exist, even though it is successfully added to the ticket. Another email is sent right after saying the attachment was added:\n# Same steps as above, only add the attachment on commenting, by clicking the attachment icon\n\n\\[bug 4\\] This can also be replicated with emoticons.\n\nh3. Expected Results\n\nThe customer should receive an automated email with that external comment. \n\nh3. Actual Results\n\\[bug 1 and 2\\] In first two cases, the images are broken:\n!attachment_after_commenting.png|thumbnail!\n\n\\[bug 3\\] The third problem shows this:\n!attachments_when_commenting.png|thumbnail!\n\n\\[bug 4\\] Here is the emoticons problem:\n!emoticons.png|thumbnail!\n\nh3. Note\n\nIt seems that an agent emailing him/herself does not cause this problem.\n\nh3.Workaround\nNone so far.",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSDSERVER-2312].\n  {panel}\n\nHello Team \n\nOur Company wants to use the JIRA Service Desk for all our clients. So we are talking about 50-500 Clients/Organizations (with 100-10000 employees) each using the customer portal to raise their Support Tickets. We want to give them an efficient Ticket Management system/Portal.  So our intention is to let each Client (1-2 Admins) be able to review reports on all their tickets raised with us. We think its too much manual work for us to generate each type of report they require fortnightly/monthly for 500-1000 organizations. It seems like a lot of unnecessary  manual work.\n\nWe understand JSD Agents only have that permission. We are ready to purchase JSD Agent license for 1-2 people for each organization BUT we want to restrict their access from editing workflows , viewing our internal communication , work logs, etc. Basically we just want them to be able to see issues raised by their own organization and create reports based on them.\n\nDo you think this is possible? My first alternative was to give them JIRA License but they can  still see our internal communication and worklogs which is bad :( We cant seem to attach our server related attachments to the support Ticket , hiding it from the client. I dont think we want to create duplicate tickets in a different project every time and work on those duplicated tickets rather than the original. \n\nCan you please suggest a solution or suitable alternative solutions ? \n\nThank you for your time and support. \n\nRegards\nManjusha \n\n\n",

Summary\nWhen entering data into a comment (eg. into comment section), a user can accidentally click on a link in the page causing the browser to re-direct the page to the new page. Clicking the *Back* button of the browser will return the user to the original issue. However, the behaviour is inconsistent\n||Type of project||Chrome||Firefox||\n||Normal Project|Clicking *Back* will reload all previously entered data|Clicking *Back* will load a new page. Any data entered previously will be lost|\n||Service Desk Project|Clicking *Back* will load a new page. Any data entered previously will be lost|Clicking *Back* will load a new page. Any data entered previously will be lost|\n\nHere are videos demonstrating the behaviour\n* [^chrome.mp4]\n* [^firefox.mp4]\n\nService Desk projects should be able to retrieve entered data as well\n\nThe behaviour also happens in Customer Portal. After re-directing to a new page (be it on purpose or accidentally), clicking _Back_ will *not* retrieve entered data. This will affects users who have entered a lot of data only to accidentally click on a link to be re-directed. All their data will be lost.\n\nh3. Suggestion\n# Make Firefox (and all other supported browsers) behave the same and able to retrieve entered data; AND\n# Make Service Desk projects behave the same as well so that browsers can retrieve entered data\n\n*OR*\n# Have a pop up which warns users such that entered data will be lost",

In the interests of being clear and transparent; although being a future roadmap consideration, this feature is not on our near term roadmap.\r\n\r\nI will look to update it again in roughly 6 months time.\r\n\r\nCheers,\u00a0\r\n\r\nBen.\r\n{panel}\r\nh3. Summary\r\n\r\nWhen a customer already exists in a Service Desk, if I re-invite them using an email address, nothing happens. It will be silently ignored.\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Go to the 'Customers' page in a Service Desk\r\n # Invite a customer, by clicking 'Invite', enter an email and click 'Send invites'\r\n ** The invite will be sent\r\n # Do the same process again _with the same email address_\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nEither:\r\n * A new invite email is send (if this process was done twice, is most likely because the first one didn't work) or warn the user that a customer with that email already exists and no email will be sent.\r\n * No invite is sent, but I receive a message informing me this user is already a customer, but would I like to resend the invitation to this Service Desk\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nDepending on the type of invitation:\r\n - The initial invitation containing the link to set a password will only ever be sent once, when the user is initially created. After this time, the Forgot password link can be used.\r\n - Invitations to different Service Desks send a new invite email each time, and these are what can be re-sent.",

We have several service desks at the office, and one of those we don't want it to be chatty towards the customers. What I would have liked to do was to disable the emails to the reporter, but leave everything else as-is.\n\nAfter much pondering I ended up keeping JSD notification set to ON globally, and setting the project-level notifications scheme to NONE. This solves some of the problem, but service desk agents won't get emails either when we assign to them. \n\nIt'd be nice if we had more control over this, such as turning OFF the service desk notification scheme at the project level, or use the project notification scheme to control when the emails are sent (but not their format).",

If you want to customise further, it's being tracked at https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSD-631.\n\nBests,\nThe JIRA Service Desk team\n{panel}\n\n{panel:title=Service Desk Update - 4 September 2015}\nHi all,\n\nThank you for all your feedback. Before launching this new feature, our goal was to make service desk notification more conversational. We\u2019ve made a decision to move forward with helping agents save time with a friendly greeting and sign off with the agent name to make it more personal. We acknowledge that this functionality isn't for every agent and your desire to customize these responses.\nSo far we've added additional translation strings for German, French and Japanese. \nYou can also help us in translating for your language here if it is missing https://translations.atlassian.com/. \nThe string are:\n\n{noformat}\nsd.comment.prepopulated.default.greeting=Hi {0},\nsd.comment.prepopulated.default.anonymous.greeting=Hi,\n{noformat}\n\nThe ability to edit these responses will require a bit more thought, the immediate action for us is to provide an option for agents to turn this functionality off as they wish in the upcoming release. If you want to customise further, it's being tracked at https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSD-631.\n\nThanks for your patience and we hope you appreciate our open approach to feature requests.If you have further questions or comments, please feel free to contact me directly as well at jhuynh at atlassian dot com.\n\nBests,\nThe JIRA Service Desk team\n{panel}\n\n",
