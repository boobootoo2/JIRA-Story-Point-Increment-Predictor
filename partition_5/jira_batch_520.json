Summary\r\n\r\nDetail missed in the title for brevity: the SLA metric must also have a 'pause'/'unpause' condition triggered at the same time as or very close to the close of the SLA.\r\n\r\nOccurrences mostly happen when there is an Automation rule running on resolution of an issue (eg: adding a \"your request has been closed\" comment) after closing an issue that had a paused SLA.\u00a0\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nVery rare, not practical to reproduce manually. This just outlines an example config that matches the prerequisites to reproduce.\r\n # Ensure there is an SLA metric which pauses on \"Status: Waiting for Agent\" and stops on \"Resolution set\"\r\n # Ensure there is an automation rule which comments on resolution of a request.\u00a0\r\n # Create a request\r\n # Put the request in status \"Waiting for agent\"\u00a0\r\n # Resolve the request (with any status that is not \"Waiting for agent\")\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\n\u00a0The SLA referred to in step 1 should be closed and commented on as specified by the automation rule in step 2.\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nThe comment works, but the SLA will sometimes (rarely) be unpaused and still running.\u00a0\r\nh3. Known Workarounds\r\n * Remove pause conditions from SLA metrics which stop on the same trigger which any automation rule uses to update the issue at all (comment, edit, transition)\r\n * Remove automation rules which update the issue at all from issues which have pause conditions. \u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nh3. Extra Details:\r\n\r\nThis may theoretically also occur in slight variations of example mentioned setup. \u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0",

(All editable text should be optional.)\r\n- Backgrounds must be 100% in the control of the Cloud admin, including removal of the background if desired.\r\n- Custom CSS must be allowed.\r\n- Text color must not be tied to a theme, as is with the current portal, as this leads to situations where potentially the text is invisible, or hard to see (depending on the background color).
