They live in a large directory structure, about 200 folders wide and about 4 deep.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1) Opened the above repo (SourceTree hangs for a little bit, but not too badly)\r\n2) Close SourceTree, go away for Christmas\r\n3) Come back, open SourceTree to work on another project\r\n4) SourceTree goes to open the last opened project, and occupies a full core of the CPU for several minutes.  \r\n5) It eventually opens - the tab it shows (presumably the last one I had open) is the \"file status\" tab\r\n6) I close the bloated project.\r\n\r\nI totally get that this project is one of the \"hard cases\" - lots of fairly large files, in a huge tree of folders.  And the consequences are fairly small - I had to wait a few minutes.  But I figured you guys might want to know about it.\r\n\r\nOther possible contributing factor: at the time, I have 15 repos bookmarked.  Most of them use public-key authentication via Pageant.  At the time of this issue, pageant didn't have the required keys.  So it's also possible that attempting to fetch for 15 different repos may have contributed.\r\n\r\nIf you want to use this repo to reproduce the issue, it's here: https://github.com/jwalthour/msl_3d_viewer . The readme and commandline help explain how to download the untracked files - the source itself is fairly small.\r\n",

Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Clone a repo with more than one branches, e.g. branches master and staging.\r\n# Checkout the staging branch under a subfolder, like below: \r\n!Screen Shot 2015-12-22 at 12.18.50.png|thumbnail! \r\n# Try to push staging by either clicking the Push button on the top, or by right-clicking the branch in SourceTree >> Push to origin/staging (tracked).\r\n\r\nh3.

Environment\r\nThis has been reproduced in versions 1.6.25 and 1.7 of SourceTree for Windows.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Open a git repository with 2 branches (let's say master and staging) in SourceTree Windows.\r\n# Switch to master branch (if not there already).\r\n# Double-click on staging branch from the list 'Branches' on the left.\r\n# Right after the dialog for switching branches closes, press the 'Pull' button from the menu on the top.\r\n\r\nh3.
