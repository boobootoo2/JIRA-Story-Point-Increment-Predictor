Steps to reproduce:\r\nFrom a fresh JIRA instance, simply enable http access dump logs and enter few pages. You will easily be able to see similar cases to the ones above as they are common and happen all over the log.\r\n\r\nh3. Impact analysis:\r\nThis would make it difficult to depend on the http dump logs to diagnose whether the server is sending the correct content or not. For example, I have had a customer who I needed to narrow the problem scope down whether it is his JIRA sending wrong content or whether it is the router/proxy/firewall altering the content and corrupting the document.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nAli\r\nAtlassian Support",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-24687].\r\n{panel}\r\nIn JIRA version 4.2.4 there is an \"Assign To Me\" button in the issue details screen which allows the user to change the issue's assignee value without going through one of the user defined workflow steps. This defeats the purpose of having configurable workflows steps since the user is able to change the state of the issue outside of the workflow. There should be a way to configure JIRA so that this button can be hidden or disabled.\r\n\r\nAn admin should also have the ability to hide the Assign menu button on the top of a ticket for the same purposes as listed above. If a user wants to only have the assignee determined by a workflow, this hinders that ability.\r\n\r\n*Workaround:*\r\n For JIRA Server: Go to Admin, Plugins, System Plugins, Issue Operations Plugin, Manage plugin modules. Find the module named \"View Issue Ops Bar Assign To Me Link (assign-to-me)\" and click on the Disable button. The \"Assign To Me\" button will now not be displayed when viewing any issue.\r\n\r\n(!)\u00a0This is not available on JIRA Cloud because System Plugins are restricted.\r\n\r\n+Another workaround using CSS:+\r\n * [How to hide the \"Assign\" and \"Assign to me\" links via CSS|https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirakb/how-to-hide-the-assign-and-assign-to-me-links-via-css-665421833.html]",

Hence the above pattern.\r\n\r\nJIRA accepts the pattern, but the JIRA user interface automatically converts project keys to uppercase. So, it's useless to specify any other pattern, because it won't work with the JIRA user interface anyway.\r\n\r\nYou need to fix this by doing one of the following:\r\n\r\n* Allow lower case letters in Project Keys and also have the User Interface support this. The UI needs to check the project key against what is configured in jira.projectkey.pattern.  Now your UI uses some local logic, which is a bug. Of course it should be compatible with what the user has configured.\r\n\r\n* If you don't want to support lower case letters, then document that in jira-application.properties.\r\n\r\n",

The problem occurs both when using the Export/Import upgrade method as well as the in-place direct database upgrade paths.  \r\n\r\nThe problem occurs under the following circumstances.  \r\n- Crowd Integration is enabled on a user directory with more than 10,000 users\r\n- two internal Jira users are present in the Jira database from pre-crowd integration (though these are not used at all in any projects, issues, or permissions)\r\n- The exported XML version of the database contains membership information like: <OSMembership id=\"10000\" userName=\"<username>\" groupName=\"jira-administrators\"/>\r\n- the crowd directory does NOT include groups that match the default Jira groups: jira-administrators, jira-developers, jira-users\r\n\r\nThe exception contained in the attached text file occurs during the upgrade, and blocks the upgrade as well as rendering Jira unusable.  \r\n\r\nMy only solution to the problem was to revert the database to a pre-upgrade backup and then manually remove the users/groups and memberships records from the three tables userbase, groupbase and membershipbase.  \r\n\r\nMore information can be found on this problem in your support system under the issue JSP-80318",

      "description": "When an automated tool is creating an issue via HTTP POST request to CreateIssueDetails.jspa and omits request parameter 'security', one would expect that the resulting issue will have Issue Security Scheme's default security level. However, this is currently *not* the case.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Associate a project with an Issue Security Scheme that have some security levels in it.\r\n2. Assign one of the security levels as the default (i.e., it mustn't be 'None').\r\n3. Make sure the project's Field Configuration Scheme has Security Level field not hidden in the field configuration associated for the issue type you are about to create (e.g. Bug) and also shown on the screen (e.g. Bug create screen).\r\n4. Go to Issues -> Create Issue page, choose this project and issue type (e.g. Bug), press Next.\r\n5. Make sure your configured default security level is displayed in the Security Level select-box as the default (so you know the configuration is correct).\r\n6. Remove HTML element <select name=\"security\".../> using Firebug, Chrome's dev tools or similar (OR use HTTP proxy such as Charles to modify the request)\r\n7. Press Create \r\n8. The resulting issue has Security Level 'None' instead of scheme's default.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure whether this behavior is the same when creating issues through RPC APIs, but if it is, it might pose a security risk. I've noticed a method createIssueWithSecurityLevel(token, rIssue, securityLevelId) in Jira SOAP API, but I didn't notice a possibility to query project's (or its associated issue security scheme's) default security level, so it's of little use unless the remote caller knows the default level itself.\r\n\r\nThe code below could be used to set the default security level in CreateIssueDetails.java:\r\n{code}\r\nObject securityParameter = ActionContext.getParameters().get( \"security\" );    \t\r\nif( securityParameter == null )\r\n{\r\n\tlog.debug( \"Request parameter 'security' is missing, trying to set the default security level of issue security scheme\" );\r\n\tList< GenericValue > issueSecuritySchemes = ComponentManager.getComponentInstanceOfType( \r\n\t\t\tIssueSecuritySchemeManager.class ).getSchemes( getProject() );\r\n\tif( issueSecuritySchemes != null && !issueSecuritySchemes.isEmpty() )\r\n\t{\r\n\t    // there are issue security schemes associated with this specific project, continue\r\n\t    for( GenericValue securityScheme : issueSecuritySchemes ) // actually there should only be one scheme..\r\n\t    {\r\n\t\tLong defaultLevelId = securityScheme.getLong( \"defaultlevel\" );\r\n\t\tGenericValue defaultLevel = issueSecurityLevelManager.getIssueSecurityLevel( defaultLevelId );\r\n\t\tif( defaultLevel != null && issue != null )\r\n\t\t{\r\n\t\t\tissue.setSecurityLevel( defaultLevel );\r\n\t\t\tlog.info( \"Set scheme's default security level '\" + defaultLevel.getString( \"name\" )\r\n\t\t\t    + \"' for Issue[summary=\" + issue.getSummary() + \"]\" );\r\n\t\t        return;\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t    }\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nProbably there are better places for this check, probably where the issue is initially created and fields populated, e.g. in IssueCreationHelperBeanImpl.validateCreateIssueFields() or SecurityLevelSystemField.getValueFromParams():\r\n{code}\r\n    public Object getValueFromParams(Map params)\r\n    {\r\n        if (params.containsKey(getId()) && params.get(getId()) != null)\r\n        {\r\n            Long securityLevelId = Long.valueOf((String) params.get(getId()));\r\n            if (NO_SECURITY_LEVEL_ID.equals(securityLevelId))\r\n            {\r\n                return null;\r\n            }\r\n            else\r\n            {\r\n                return getSecurityLevel(securityLevelId);\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n        else\r\n        {\r\n            CURRENTLY:\r\n            // No parameter could be found so need to set the default security level\r\n            return null;\r\n\r\n            SHOULD BE:\r\n            <CODE TO SET THE DEFAULT SECURITY LEVEL>\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nOr is there a logical explanation why this kind of behavior is considered normal in Jira?",
