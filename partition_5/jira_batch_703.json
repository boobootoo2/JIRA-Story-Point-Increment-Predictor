This affects what order the versions are shown in drop-down lists and also how 'version' type fields are sorted. \r\n\r\nThe drop and drag functionality provided by the User Interface does not allow creating a version into a specific location, or automatically sorting this list using any criteria.\r\n\r\nProjects with very long lists become difficult to manage. For example, imagine having many concurrent version releases being actively developed and needing to add a point release due to a security patch on each version. The Project Administrator would need to drag through the list all the new project versions to their correct locations.\r\n\r\nControls such as: Automatically Sorting the list by Version Number and allowing a user to define a specific \"versionAfter\" version when creating a new version would greatly aid in the usability of the product.",

Right now he can type this by hand: {code}[73e778e|http://stash.example.com/stash/projects/PRJ/repos/project/commits/73e778ed40bf0384e7531712e9c92e08bb815472#src/main/webapp/app/controller/Controller.js]{code} to create a link like [73e778e|http://stash.example.com/stash/projects/PRJ/repos/project/commits/73e778ed40bf0384e7531712e9c92e08bb815472#src/main/webapp/app/controller/Controller.js]\r\n\r\nWe can already just type JIRA issue keys into comments and JIRa automatically transforms them into clickable links to those issues. It would be useful if we can just type 73e778e or 73e778e:src/main/webapp/app/controller/Controller.js and have JIRA automatically link it to the commit in Stash and even the specific file in that commit, respectively.\r\n\r\nPerhaps with a different notation so that the parser can more easily pick it up as a commit id, something like #73e778e and #73e778e:<path> for specific files in that commit.",

The idea of this is to avoid performance issues.\r\n\r\nThis becomes a major limitation in use cases where one of these words coincide with a string which represents an important search sting in a JIRA instance e.g. a code or acronym (for one customer BY is an IATA code which is a custom field value and used in the summaries of JIRA tickets as well). In this cases it's a major inconvenience and source of confusion for users who are not getting expected results when searching with this strings because they are treated as stop words by lucene.\r\n\r\nNot sure what would be the best way to implement a solution for this problem, but perhaps we can implement a way to automatically modify the text to an exact search string by adding quotes automatically when a reserved word is used in search. e.g.:\r\nbasically {{text ~ \"by\"}} becomes {{text ~ \"\\\"by\\\"\"}} automatically, so that the search doesn't fail.",

Same goes for JIRA startup - run initially, and then again every time the delay has passed.\r\n\r\nContrast that with Confluence's \"Scheduled Jobs\", where, for at least some of them, it is possible to specify execution times like one does with Cron on *nix systems - in the case of the specific client I had in mind (who is not alone in this), it would be beneficial to specify, for instance 0 20 * * * for one service, 5 20 * * * for another, 10 20 * * * for a third etc., for execution every day at 20:00 for the first, 20:05 for the second, 20:10 for the third and so forth.\r\n\r\nTo summarise, the Cron-like ability for scheduling jobs in Confluence is great, and it would be very nice to have similar capabilities in JIRA.",

We've made the decision to close this issue because we want to send a clear message that this is not something JIRA is going to support.\r\n\r\nFirst, a few thoughts on this issue in particular.\r\n* JIRA permission schemes are already very granular and complex. There are several dozen individual permissions that an administrator needs to understand. If these different sets of permissions were mapped at the issue type level, this would multiply the complexity.\r\n* In our research, we already see major confusion between schemes that map configuration to issue types versus schemes that map configuration to projects.\r\n** Issue type schemes, permissions, notifications, and issue security are all associated directly to a *project*\r\n** Workflow schemes, field configuration schemes, and issue type screen schemes map configuration to *issue types*\r\n* If you were to change the behavior of permission schemes so that they mapped a permission configuration to issue types, you would need to introduce a second layer \u2013 a permission configuration per issue type, and then a permission scheme to associate that set of configurations to a project.\r\n* This is the exact opposite of the direction we want to go with JIRA. We are investing heavily in reducing complexity in JIRA administration to make it more accessible to more users.\r\n\r\nThis does not mean that the needs of JIRA admins are not important. Improving performance and simplifying project configuration are the top two priorities for the JIRA development team for the foreseeable future. However, when looking holistically at how we can improve the project configuration experience in JIRA, this request doesn't fit in to our vision.\r\n\r\nA note on requests on jira.atlassian.com:\r\n* We take the feedback and votes on feature requests on jira.atlassian.com seriously. Certainly the fact that there's 144 votes for this request and it's already been closed before doesn't go unnoticed.\r\n* When we make the decision to close an issue, our goal is to make a clear statement about which features we realistically expect to support in JIRA and which features we don't expect to implement, at least not in the way they have been described in the feature request. While it might be painful or frustrating in the short term, we strongly committed to communicating our intentions as openly as possible. Everyone is better off in the long run.\r\n* We have a detailed explanation of how we use jira.atlassian.com and how we develop our roadmap [here|https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/110373/how-does-the-jira-team-use-jira-atlassian-com].\r\n\r\nWe're currently in the midst of updating almost every feature request in the JRA project with a significant number of votes. Our hope is that the conclusion you draw is not that Atlassian doesn't care, but that we are trying to focus on the improvements that will the largest benefit for the most customers, and unfortunately this means that we simply cannot work on the vast majority of the hundreds of feature requests at once.\r\n\r\nFeel free to contact me at any time if you have feedback or questions. My email address is dmeyer@atlassian.com.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nDave Meyer\r\nProduct Manager, JIRA\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\nReopen JRA-5865 created 10 years ago. I understand the reason why you didn't implement this but there's a LOT or people and company wanting this feature. There's still a lot of activity on the issue comment.\r\n\r\nPlease reconsider implementing this feature.\r\n\r\nNow, when a group has the permission to create an issue, it could create EVERY types of issues available. It's a complement to project specific issues types. (http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRA-1602)\r\n\r\nFor example, If we have external client (like me right now :)) I would be interrested to limit his issue creation right to only bugs, features, external client requests (custom type).",
