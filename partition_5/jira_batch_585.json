The current implementation doesn't allow enough timing precision for troubleshooting a problem\r\n * *Lack quantity control* - The quantity of the thread dump must be proportionate to the problem behavior. e.g., troubleshooting 15 second slowdown would require 5 thread dump taken with 2 second interval to give a clear picture of what happened during the 15 second slowdown.\u00a0\r\n\r\nh4. *Impact of this problem*\r\n\r\nAdministrator often think the thread dump included in the support zip are valid and rely on that to troubleshoot performance problem.

Here is the sample log:\r\n{code}\r\n...\r\n...\r\nJava HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM warning: CodeCache is full.

Issue Summary\r\n\r\nMethods in _DefaultUserPickerSearchService_ take _UserSearchParams_ or _maxResults_ value as a parameter to most of the methods.\r\n\r\nThe Java doc on _UserSearchParams_ says:\r\n{code:java}\r\n     * @param maxResults           the maximum number of results to retrieve.  Use <code>null</code> for unlimited results.\r\n{code}\r\nHowever, inside _DefaultUserPickerSearchService_, there is an explicit check for the null value (and an explicit special value meaning unlimited results) that changes this value to _MAX_MAX_RESULTS_, which currently is equal to 1000:\r\n{code:java}\r\n    private int normalizeRidiculousUserPickerLimits(Integer resultLimit) {\r\n        if (resultLimit == null || resultLimit == EntityQuery.ALL_RESULTS) {\r\n            return MAX_MAX_RESULTS;\r\n        } else {\r\n            return resultLimit;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n{code}\r\nThis means that the only way to obtain more than 1000 users from the search is to explicitly provide a big number as _maxResults_.\r\n This approach is problematic though, as it can cause a high memory usage due to the way Lucene will handle this number - it will eagerly create an array of the passed-in size, so a caller providing MAX_INTEGER value to the method will user over 8GBs of memory.\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nN/A\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\n_DefaultUserPickerSearchService_ supports unlimited search, according to the Java doc.\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\n_DefaultUserPickerSearchService_ returns at most 1000 users when unlimited search is requested.\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nA workaround is to explicitly set _maxResults_ to a high number.\r\n*Note that this will use a lot of memory due to Lucene eagerly creating data structures, even if the final search will return 0 results.*",

Options associated workflow transitions should open in the same tab, as the old tab becomes useless after a typical workflow edit; even in the case of discarding any changes. Once the changes are published, they should reflect.\r\n\r\n2. *An alternate option*, the new tab being opened for edit should be closed after the Publish or Discard buttons are pressed and the parent tab to be refreshed. To achieve this, we can think of providing these edit options as popup windows, once changes are made it automatically refreshes the workflow.\r\n\r\nOne other improvement, would be to make the workflow edit screen go back to the same view originally selected (in this case the Diagram view).\r\n",

Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Install Jira 8.5.0\r\n # create a project and start creating issues, transition one of them and add comments.\r\n # run a background re-indexing on the instance.\r\n # check the background reindexing logs.\r\n # enable debug logging on the package: *com.atlassian.jira.ofbiz.IssueGenericValue* in the log4j.properties\r\n # do a restart and check the logs.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nJira should have a clean start up, index recovery shouldn't be trying to deindex issues with zero ids.\r\n Background reindex number should match up without any discripancy.\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nOn start up Jira is trying to deindex issues with zero ids even though the database doesn't have any issues with zero ids.\r\n The below messages are shown in the Jira start up logs in atlassian-jira.log:\r\n{noformat}\r\n2019-11-13 14:42:34,466 Caesium-1-1 INFO      [c.a.jira.startup.IndexRecoveryLauncher] Running start-index-recovery\r\n2019-11-13 14:42:34,789 Caesium-1-1 INFO      [c.a.j.index.ha.DefaultIndexRecoveryManager] Latest index date: {2019-11-04 13:30:15}, Latest DB date: {2019-11-04 13:30:15}\r\n2019-11-13 14:42:34,790 Caesium-1-1 INFO      [c.a.jira.startup.IndexRecoveryLauncher] Indexing issues from=2019-11-04 13:30:15.0 to=Mon Nov 04 13:30:15 CET 2019 (time span of 314ms)\r\n2019-11-13 14:42:34,791 Caesium-1-1 INFO      [c.a.j.index.ha.DefaultIndexRecoveryManager] Re-indexing issues from: 2019-11-04 13:30:15.0 to: Mon Nov 04 13:30:15 CET 2019 ...\r\n...\r\n2019-11-13 14:42:35,439 ForkJoinPool.commonPool-worker-1 INFO      [c.a.j.cache.soy.SoyCacheWarmer] Warming 41 soy modules\r\n2019-11-13 14:42:35,439 Caesium-1-1 INFO      [c.a.j.index.ha.DefaultIndexRecoveryManager] Done re-indexing: 1 issues from: 2019-11-04 13:30:15.0 to: Mon Nov 04 13:30:15 CET 2019.\r\n2019-11-13 14:42:35,439 Caesium-1-1 INFO      [c.a.jira.startup.IndexRecoveryLauncher] Progress=60%, task=Recovering, message=Recovered added and updated issues\r\n2019-11-13 14:42:35,505 Caesium-1-1 WARN      [c.a.jira.ofbiz.IssueGenericValue] Issue (id=0) has empty field 'num'.

This would be extremely helpful for customers that have large and heavily customized environments.

Additionally, it is important to deny users access to the instance before plugins are correctly upgraded and post-upgrade checks have been performed, and functionalities have been tested and are ready for use. Furthermore, once the upgrade is completed, the integrations between Jira and other applications will be reestablished and that can be another potential source of issues in the future.\r\n\r\nAlso, for instances that have users worldwide in different timezones, it can be extremely difficult to program a maintenance window where no users will be accessing Jira. In some cases, these maintenance windows are used to perform system administration tasks such as the installation of new plugins, extracting data for year-end processing or auditing by regulatory agencies.\r\n\r\nThe current options available, outlined in the article: [Preventing users from accessing Jira applications during backups|https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiraserver/preventing-users-from-accessing-jira-applications-during-backups-938847685.html], are not feasible for some of our customers, as it can require network and security skills that may not be available when this functionality is needed.\r\n\r\nBecause of that, this feature could benefit these customers allowing them to restrict access to the instance through the User Interface, similarly to the Full Reindex process (that is already available), not allowing users to alter data inside the instance while the process is executed.\r\n",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-73372].\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\nh3. Issue Summary\r\n\r\nWith the addition of the JQL function [issueLinkType|https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirasoftwareserver/advanced-searching-fields-reference-939938743.html#Advancedsearching-fieldsreference-issuelinktypeIssuelinktype], Jira Server now has the ability to let users search by the issue link's Name, Outward Description, and/or Inward description. The problem with this is that by default the issue link type 'Blocks' also has an outward description by the same name 'blocks'. Since these are the same, you can't actually only get back results with that outward description. Instead you get back all issues with that link name, which includes both outward ('blocks') and inward ('is blocked by').\r\n By default only the Blocks link type has a description with the same value as the link Name. The suggested solution would be to have new Jira sites use a different change the outward link name from 'blocks' to something different such as 'blocking'.\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Link one issue to another with the blocks issue link type\r\n # Search JQL with:\r\n{code:java}\r\nissueLinkType = \"blocks\" \r\n{code}\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nWould expect to only get back a single issue with that outward description of 'blocks'\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nYou actually will get back all the issues of that link name (both inward and outward description) because the term that is being searched here matches the link name.\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nYou can edit the link descriptions so that they do not exactly match the name of the link type. For example you could change the outward link name from 'blocks' to something different such as 'blocking'. This would at least permit users to make these specific JQL searches based on the description and not the name.",
