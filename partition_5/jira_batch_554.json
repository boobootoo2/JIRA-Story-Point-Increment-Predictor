[See the corresponding bug report|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSDSERVER-834].\n  {panel}\n\nAs quoted from [this documentation|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/SERVICEDESK/Setting+up+the+email+channel#Settinguptheemailchannel-Usingmultipleemailaccounts]\n\n{quote}You can only link one email account with JIRA Service Desk. If you use more than one email address to interact with your customers and want to integrate them with JIRA Service Desk, you might be able to achieve this by setting up forwarding rules or aliases.{quote}\n\nHowever Gmail's auto forward and aliases doesn't work. These mails are ignored and request are not created\n\nh4. Steps to reproduce\n# Install Service Desk add-on (I tested with v 2.0.2)\n# Create new Service Desk\n# Navigate to {{Settings > Email settings}}\n# Turn on email request and enter valid credentials (eg. servicedesk@gmail.com)\n\n# In your secondary gmail account (eg. servicedesk-backup@gmail.com), configure auto forwarding to servicedesk@gmail.com\n# Send an email to servicedesk-backup@gmail.com\n\nh4. Expected Results\n# servicedesk-backup@gmail.com will receive the email and automatically forward it to servicedesk@gmail.com\n# servicedesk@gmail.com will receive the email\n# Mail handler will process the email and create the request in Service Desk\n\nh4. Actual Results\n# servicedesk-backup@gmail.com receives the email and automatically forward it to servicedesk@gmail.com\n# servicedesk@gmail.com receives the email \n# Mail handler doesn't create a new request in Service Desk for this email\n\nh4. Notes\n# I personally tested this auto forwarding feature\n# I was unable to test aliases, but there are cases where a customer configured aliases and the mail handler ignores the email\n# If you manually forward the email, it will be processed. Problem is with gmail auto forwarding",

There's certainly a lot of interest behind this feature!\r\n\r\nWe would love to hear more from you on how your team shall add and maintain multiple languages on the portal. Understanding this will help us make the right thing that fits your needs perfectly.\r\n\r\nIf you would like to help out, please take 2 minutes to answer these questions - [https://jsd-beta.typeform.com/to/VS5QKT].\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n JIRA Service Desk Team\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n----\r\nDuring my evaluation I discovered that JSD is not able to offer a \r\n customer helpdesk in diffrent languages for diffrent customers.\r\n\r\nIn fact it is not even able to offer a proper helpdesk in an other\r\n language as English, because of bugs in mailgeneration and a stating page\r\n (http://<JIRA-BASEURL>/servicedesk/customer/portals) \r\n which does not seem to care about language at all.\r\n\r\nRegarding the missing possibilty to select a language as customer I have\r\n to state that I'm not only dissapointed but quite shocked.\r\n\r\nThere are countries in the world where the customer (and sometimes\r\n also the law) expect support in the local language. If a company wants to \r\n sell its products there AND also international, you always have the need\r\n a helpdesk in diffrent languages.\r\n\r\nI simply cannot understand that JSD does not offer this. \r\n As Jira Users can choose the language you already have anything you need to implement this:\r\n - a framework and a process to deal with translations.\r\n - a software which is capable of dealing with diffrent languages\r\n - a user profile implementation which deals with a language setting",

Having to save a copy, then go and attach, is laborious and very archaic - the customer experience is disappointed that this simple fucntionality hasn't been provided. Can someone please look into this as it's a big problem with the way a lot of customers report issues through the Portal. Thanks\n Jp",

As this is a strong candidate for our roadmap, I would love to speak to some of you on your needs and the specific use cases behind multiple email addresses. Your input and time will help us better create a feature that serves you! I empathise with the frustration that has been accumulating since the ticket opened 6 years ago.\r\n\r\nPlease do not hesitate to reach out to me at [szhang4@atlassian.com|mailto:szhang4@atlassian.com]\u00a0so that we can set up a time for us to speak.\r\n\r\nLook forward to hearing from you.\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\n\r\n*Problem*: A single Service Desk may have many _Request Types_ yet only one email account can be associated with one _Request Types_ meaning users have to use the GUI to create a Service Desk Request. \r\n\r\n*Suggestion(s)*: Allow multiple email address to be associated with a single Service Desk, multiple _Request Types_ to be associated with a single email address, or holistically associate the Service Desk with one email.",

Problem Definition\n\nWe've setup a dedicated service desk project, so we can have the issue types, workflows and so forth setup to suit/match the service desk workflow.\n\nIf an issue gets pushed across to the developer team, we then have a choice: Do we move the issue (and lose the tracking, SLAs etc in the service desk) or clone it and then move it (which \"wastes\" an ID and leaves gaps in the issue numbering).\n\n\nh3. Suggested Solution\n\nIt would be nice to have a simple \"Send to Developers\" or \"Copy to Project\" workflow which creates a duplicate of the issue in the (specified) developer project, and automatically links the service desk project issue to the developer project issue.\n\nThat would mean you can have a single helpdesk project for triaging issues, and the development team the flexibility to play around with the issue without impacting the SD team and metrics.",

After this i wrote a plugin which is trying to find user's project roles using JIRA API.\nThe problem is that for users with this role plugin can not find this role. As a result, I need to do some administrative or programmatic workarounds.\nHope you can help me.\nThanks in advance, Andrey.",

Would you fix it (or even it isn't work incorrect) in Jira Service Desk?\n\nThis is description of the problem:\nWe observed some bug in calculation of due date.\nBelow is the scenario for getting this incorrect behaviour:\n1. We have registered issue (for example 1.08.2014) with Start SLA in the future, for example today: 11.08.2014\n2. This issue has Time SLA which should start calculating today 11.08.2014, but work is in progress from 1.08.2014.\n3. From 1.08.2014 this clock was frozen for 10 hours (for example in 5-6.08.2014).\n4. When Time SLA starts today, it has \"-10h\" in \"Consumed time\", which ist't correct, because it should start today and it shouldn't take into account the time when clock was frozen.\nWhen Consumed time is calculate as negative, Due date is also incorrect.\n\nPlease let us know whether this problem occurs in Jira Service Desk and if it'll be fix.\n\nBest regards, \nMalgorzata Mroz",
