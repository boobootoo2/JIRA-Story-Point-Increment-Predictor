Find the commit that no longer shows up in SourceTree\r\n4. Cherry-pick or merge in the commit using it's shortened id in the reflog.\r\n\r\nIf the dangling commit showed up in the UI, It would be much easier to recover.\r\n\r\nHonestly, I think this option should be on by default so newbs like me aren't as likely to lose their work.",

      "description": "When discarding selected changes from a file, either a hunk or selected line(s), SourceTree does the discard and then converts all linebreaks in the complete file from CRLF (Windows) to LF.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\nI used a fresh created repository so everyone should be able to reproduce the steps on the own computer.\r\n\r\n* Create new repository\r\n* Set autocrlf=false in {{.git/config}} to make sure the files are commited as-is.\r\n* Create a file with CRLF line endings, add some text in four or five lines.\r\n** Commit the file.\r\n* Now we need to use a clone where autocrlf=true. This is simply done by another change in {{.git/config}} manually. The effect is the same as cloning the repository on a machine where autocrlf=true globally.\r\n* Change a line in the file\r\n* In SourceTree, click on _Discard Hunk_\r\n\r\n*Expected:* The changes are simply discarded, no changes are in working copy.\r\n*Actual:* The changes are discarded, but all line endings have been converted to LF.\r\n\r\nNote that this does not happen when discarding the whole file.\r\n\r\nh3. Comments on expectations\r\nYou may state that the error is caused due to inconsistent use of autocrlf throughout the repository clones. But actions on my clone should be independent of what was checked in by others. I have clear expectations on the autocrlf functionality:\r\n* on checking out every LF is converted into CRLF\r\n* CRLF line endings are preserved (not converted into CRCRLF)\r\n* on commiting every CRLF is converted back into LF\r\n\r\nThese auto-changes have impact on the actions _checkout_ and _commit_. I do not expect SourceTree to mess with my working copy on _discard_ actions other than the assigned task. Instead in the above case, I expect that SourceTree discards the hunk (or selected lines) and reinstates the content of the file which is currently in the repository. That leaves two possibilities how it can be done:\r\n# reinstate the original content without regarding autocrlf, which could leave me (for LF formatted files) with LF endings -- not desirable\r\n# checkout the original content with autocrlf applying afterwards (LF to CRLF), which would give me the content but with CRLF line endings\r\n\r\nSourceTree does none of the above. Instead it seems to apply the *reverse* autocrlf action after discarding the changes. The contents are prepared for a commit (everything in LF), where I expect the contents prepared to as after a checkout (everything in CRLF).\r\n\r\nh3. Additional comments\r\n\r\nThis issue is the same as SRCTREEWIN-988 which was closed with \"resolved locally\" or (in my understanding) \"cannot reproduce\" by a developer. So I tried to provide the steps that use a fresh repository. Please ask if questions are left.\r\n\r\nAlso SRCTREEWIN-1635 seems to describe this bug, but misses the exact circumstances. It was stated as an error with SVN to Git conversion and no further reason was declared. This is not valid here because I used a new repository.",

Once this is done, the actions appear to work as normal and the appropriate dialog appears. This works until it gets scrogged again after which we repeat the tab closing/reopening process.",

After I make this change I'll often forget that I've changed this until the next time I try to commit something and notice a ton of files, thinking they all need to be committed for some reason. It gets me every time. I'm sure I'm not the only one.\r\n\r\nSo really, committing changes should just 'Show Pending' and searches should really 'Show All' by default and if the user changes them, the new setting should be remembered, each filter setting separate from the other.",
