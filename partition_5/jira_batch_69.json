It's been difficult to determine what's Best Practice, but I'm currently evaluating and leaning towards having Dev, Test & Release repo's for each project (in addition to each developer's working repo). Thus the same project name could be in up to 4 tabs in the SourceTree window. I can assign repo's to folders in the navigation pane (which is really nice!), my suggestion is I think it'd be very useful to be able to colour-code the folder and/or tab backgrounds to help avoid confusion and possible errors...",

The include will fail due to missing file/folder errors. The workaround to this is to do two separate commits:\r\n\r\n1. Move the renamed file to somewhere else. Commit.\r\n2. Move the file back (the upper-cased letter name) back to its original location. Commit.\r\n3. New file name (Example.txt, NOT example.txt) is detected and in repository as it should have been all along.\r\n\r\nThe workaround is fine; however, it is an unexpected inconvenience. I would expect when I make a change to the filename (including capitilization of any letter in its name) that the change would be detected and the repository updated with that change \u2013 even on a non-case sensitive FS like win8's.\r\n\r\nSo, to clarify... sourcetree is just not detecting the change file name. the third party system is just an example of how a linux machine would consume the repository.\r\n\r\nIf you were to ls in the directory the example.txt would be, it'll read, \"example.txt\" \u2013 indicative that sourcetree did in fact not detect the changed file name \u2013 and therefore assumed that nothing new was there to commit, nor was it able to be seen on the third party system (how I originally discovered this issue).\"\r\n\r\n---------\r\n\r\nI've personally reproduced this; though Mercurial on Windows itself treats \"Example.txt\" or \"example.txt\" as the same file without any changes done. But if that particular change is done on Linux itself, Mercurial on Linux will treat it as different files. Hence, this might be a Mercurial on Windows problem rather than SourceTree.\r\n\r\nThis is a request for improvement on SourceTree's side instead - to help SourceTree on Windows to recognize case sensitivity.",

When checked, The log view will use the --first-parent flag. I would expect, then, to see only a single line of history for a branch. If multiple branches are being shown (eg. the \"All Branches\" option), then if the two branches intersect, they will intersect in the Log view as well. When the \"First Parent Only\" option is not checked, the Log view will behave as before.\r\n\r\nThis should be exactly like using `git log --graph --first-parent`\r\n\r\nThe reason I marked it as Major is because this issue is not \"Trivial\". In an ideal world, everyone knows everything about git and they don't need the GUI to show only first parent. However, I am in a company that is huge and has many, many different people of different paradigms and skills, and as people start switching to git, one of the main points of confusion (and continual frustration and confusion) is that the Log view is chaotic and hard for them to use.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
