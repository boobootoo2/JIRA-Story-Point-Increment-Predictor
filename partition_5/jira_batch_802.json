If not, drop or reset the invalid tables and sequences; Then, install JIRA Agile (GreenHopper).\r\n\r\nh5. Current behavior:\r\n- JIRA does not check properly if all the {{\"AO_60DB71*\"}} tables and sequences already exists, but install JIRA Agile anyway.

The reality is that mistakes happen and this is actually a fairly common scenario.\r\n\r\nThe common workaround to this problem is to use the steps mentioned here: https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Retrieving+the+JIRA+Administrator\r\n\r\nThis is a fairly complicated process, and is dangerous because it requires direct database modifications. Additionally, enterprise organizations may have a separate JIRA administrator and database administrator. This results in a longer, drawn out, access and modification request process. \r\n\r\nGoogle Analytics shows 10,323 page views (see image) for the above mentioned document in the last year alone. A search on SAC for the document brings up 310 support tickets (I am not saying it was absolutely useful in each ticket, just what came up in a search for the url). This procedure is also frequently used internally by support engineers when dealing with customer data.\r\n\r\nIn other products I have worked on, there has been an easy to use backdoor feature. \r\n\r\nIt is important for the backdoor to natively verify a certain level of access permissions before it is triggered. \r\n\r\nI propose that we add a parameter to the jira-config.properties file along the lines of:\r\n{code}\r\njira.backdoor = 0\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nTo enable, you would simply set it to 1, and restart the JIRA instance.\r\n\r\nThis would be read at the time of JIRA starting and would disable all authentication directories within JIRA, and attach a single directory with a preconfigured user and password. This directory would not be editable (or can be generated at boot time, so modifications do not persist). \r\n\r\nBy placing this option in the configuration file, we are verifying that:\r\n\r\n# The user has access to the server running the instance\r\n# The user's level of access allows them to write changes to the jira-config.properties file\r\n# The user's level of access allows them to restart services / applications\r\n\r\nThis would also serve as a first step towards providing a solution to JRA-1924",

Filtering for active and inactive users has been available in Atlassian Cloud for some time.\r\n\r\nWe do not expect that we will re-implement this feature for JIRA Server at any point in the future, therefore we have made the decision to close this issue.\r\n\r\nIf you are using JIRA Server right now, there are a couple options:\r\n# You can use the JIRA REST API to return active users, inactive users, or both using the {{/rest/api/2/user/search}} resource and the {{includeActive}} and {{includeInactive}} query paratmers\r\n# You can query the JIRA database directly [as described here|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRAKB/Search+for+Inactive+Users]\r\n \r\nI understand that our decision may be disappointing. Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.\r\n \r\nRegards,\r\nDave Meyer\r\ndmeyer@atlassian.com\r\nProduct Manager, JIRA Platform\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\n*Original request description (original description was blank, so let's use one of the duplicates' description for clarity):*\r\nI suggest to add another combo box to Filter Users section, which allows filtering the list by users' statuses (all/active/inactive).",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-29103].\n  {panel}\n\nWe get quite a large number of support cases where customers are asking for the steps to take to upgrade from a 3.x instance to our latest version. I usually bounce the following information, however it seems like we should add it to our documentation. I would normally provide them with the following:\r\n\r\n{quote}\r\nPrior to upgrading, it's recommended to review the [Production Releases|http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Production+Releases] page. If you take a look at all the major release notes it will provide a list of all the new features you'll receive as part of the various upgrades. Please take a look at the [Supported Platforms|http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Supported+Platforms] page for 5.x, particularly the browser support. We recommend Chrome or Firefox to access JIRA, however if you are restricted to Internet Explorer within your organisation please ensure that your users will have access to IE8 at the minimum prior to upgrading. If possible, using IE9 would be preferred.\r\n\r\nTo upgrade from JIRA 3.x to 5.x, you would need to do this upgrade in two steps. First 3.x to 4.4.5 and then 4.4.5 to 5.x - it's done this way as 5.x is only backwards compatible up to JIRA 4.0.x. To upgrade, please follow the below version specific documentation\r\n\r\n* 3.x to 4.4.5: [Migrating JIRA to Another Server|http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA044/Migrating+JIRA+to+Another+Server].\r\n* 4.4.5 to 5.x: [Migrating JIRA to Another Server|http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA050/Migrating+JIRA+to+Another+Server].\r\n\r\n(i) There is a lot of important information in these guides, please ensure everything is followed.\r\n\r\nAs advised in the [Backing Up|http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA044/Migrating+JIRA+to+Another+Server#MigratingJIRAtoAnotherServer-2BackingUpr] section you will need to transfer the database contents (via XML), the home directory and the attachments to the new server.  I imagine you will want to do a fair amount of testing on the new version - depending on how long this takes you may need to transfer the information twice, due to changes in the production database between the time the backup was made and the time testing was completed.\r\n\r\nOne of the *most important* tasks to do during the upgrade will be [migrating the existing JIRA configuration over to the new one|http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA044/Migrating+JIRA+to+Another+Server#MigratingJIRAtoAnotherServer-34MigrateyourexistingJIRAconfigurationsovertoyournewJIRAinstallation] when upgrading between 3.x and 4.4.5. This is particularly important, especially if you have any custom configurations in JIRA or you're using integration with Active Directory. As of JIRA 4.3, Crowd has been integrated into JIRA, enabling synchronisation with Active Directory/LDAP servers a lot easier. Please have a look at our [Configuring User Directories|http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA044/Configuring+User+Directories] documentation if you're using LDAP/AD.\r\n\r\nIf you have any customisations to JIRA or internally developed plugins, it's recommended to get JIRA up and running successfully prior to installing any additional plugins or making customisations. As discussed in the migration guide, please ensure to check your plugins are compatible with the new version. As part of JIRA 4.3 there is also a [New Plugin Management System|http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA044/JIRA+4.3+Release+Notes#JIRA43ReleaseNotes-NewPluginManagementSystem] and any customised plugins may have to be set up manually, depending on what version they are.\r\n\r\nOne common error is that when upgrading, some of your plugins may not be compatible with the new version of JIRA and this will generate some errors. If this does happen, please disable those plugins, or remove them from {{$JIRA_HOME/plugins/installed-plugins}} and install them through the [Universal Plugin Manager|http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Managing+JIRA?+Plugins#ManagingJIRAsPlugins-InstallingaJIRAPlugin] after you have performed the initial upgrade.\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nCan you please add a page to CAC that has some information on big upgrades, such as 3.x to 5.x? Thanks :)",

Your feedback is key to helping us understand how you use JIRA so we can continue improving your experience. We have reviewed this issue over the last few days.\r\n\r\nWe've made the decision to close this request. We are focused on improving usability across JIRA \u2013 inline editing issues is an important part of JIRA feeling fast and fluid. We would prefer to concentrate our efforts on making the click-to-edit interactions faster, smoother, and more consistent across all areas of the project. Furthermore, adding feature-level behavior configuration on a per-user basis adds significantly more complexity to JIRA and slows down the product for everyone.\r\n \r\nI understand that our decision may be disappointing. Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.\r\n \r\nRegards,\r\nDave Meyer\r\ndmeyer@atlassian.com\r\nProduct Manager, JIRA Platform\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\nI just recently noticed the new feature called \"Click to edit\". While I understand the need to quickly edit a field, I have two problems with this feature:\r\n\r\n# Any click on any part of the text triggers this feature. Some people (like me) click on text to select and de-select it (mabye to copy it, or to just make it easier to follow the text while reading), or just to get the focus on the right window. People who do this will most likely end up in edit mode unwantingly (like I have done maybe 10-15 times already today).\r\n# The feature is only configurable on a global level, when each user should be able to configure it individually.\r\n\r\nMy suggestions is this:\r\n\r\n* Make this configuration possible per user.\r\n* Give three configuration options:\r\n*# Full \"Click to edit\" functionality (as it works now)\r\n*# \"Click to edit\" using the upper right icon, while any click on the body text does nothing (This one would be my personal favorite)\r\n*# Completely disable \"Click to edit\"\r\n\r\nI don't know what \"Affects Version\" to select, since we use Jira OnDemand or what's it called.",
