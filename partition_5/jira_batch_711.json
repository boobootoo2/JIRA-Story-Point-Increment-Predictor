I understand why this needed to be done but it's definitely a loss (see original issue for discussion on that). \r\n\r\nI could use the new Browse Projects view if the *table columns were sortable*. Then I'd just click the project category column to sort it and have something close to what I had before. Even better (but not critical) would be to have a \"printable\" view of this page that listed all projects using the current column sorting. \r\n\r\nSo I'm making this enhancement request. \r\n\r\nUse case is that I produce a weekly report for management listing current projects, grouped by category. I used the previous view to produce this but I can't easily produce it using the new view or any other workaround suggested by Support or Product Management.\r\n",

Every day we have our stand up and we look at the Task Board.  Sometimes the board looks exactly the same as it did the day before, and that is bad.  But it can be hard to tell exactly what has changed.  We use the burndown chart and I get emailed notifications when tickets are updated but it would still be nice to have a super easy way to see what the Task Board looked like the day before.  Maybe a report where you can select the Task Board for a given date and it would show you what the board looked like then.

This is very useful when bulk changing many tickets, but I tend to also use bulk change for 2-3 tickets at a time.  The time it takes to bulk change a small number of tickets is longer with the progress bar, as I have to wait for the first poll of the progress bar which is longer than the time it takes to bulk change my tickets.  Is there a way to improve this?  Perhaps with having the first poll of the progress bar occurring sooner?  Or not using a progress bar when there are a small number of tickets?",

Expected Behavior\r\nPool LDAP connections over SSL (LDAPS) as performed when connecting over plain LDAP.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Behavior\r\nLDAPS connections are not pooled, requiring JIRA to renegotiate the connection every time. This leads to poor performance and could cause synchronization failures, as described on [this KB article|https://confluence.atlassian.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=763004137].\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Setup any directory server with a considerable amount of users and groups (no limit pattern has been detected up until now);\r\n# Enable SSL for the connection;\r\n# Synchronize;\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround for pooling connections over SSL\r\nAdd the below argument to JIRA's [startup options|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Setting+Properties+and+Options+on+Startup].\r\n{noformat}\r\n-Dcom.sun.jndi.ldap.connect.pool.protocol='plain ssl'\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround for improving synchronization time\r\nAlbeit this won't resolve the pooling connections problem, it can significantly improve the synchronization time:\r\n# Edit the LDAP directory:\r\n# On _Use the User Membership Attribute_, under *Membership Schema Settings*:\r\n## Uncheck \"When finding the members of a group\";\r\n## Check \"When finding the user\u2019s group membership\";\r\n# Save the configuration and synchronize the directory;",

Current Behaviour\r\n\r\nJIRA/Confluence some times need to scale the original size of the global logo. The resultant size may differ by using oversized or undersized images. To reproduce, just upload a custom logo to both JIRA and Confluence via global logo admin section respectively.\r\n\r\nSee the inconsistencies between JIRA and Confluence using the [attached logo|^Atlassian-ondemand-logo.png]. \r\n\r\nJIRA: \r\n!JIRA.png!\r\n\r\nConfluence:\r\n!Confluence.png!\r\n\r\nIt could be well related to the constraint set by both apps. These info messages are displayed on the global logo upload page:\r\n\r\n* JIRA: \"The height of the logo image will be constrained to a maximum of 30 px. Also, it is recommended to use an image with a 57 px width.\"\r\n* Confluence: \"The height of the logo image will be constrained to a maximum of 48 px.\"\r\n\r\nThis is verified on Chrome, Safari, Firefox.\r\n\r\nh3. Feature Request\r\n\r\nEnsure consistency of the global logo size across all apps. This is important for branding.\r\n\r\n",
