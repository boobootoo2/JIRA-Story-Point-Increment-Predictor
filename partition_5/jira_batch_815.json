      "description": "Steps to reproduce the problem:\r\n\r\n# Create two projects using common screen/screen schemes. You can use the default screen for all issue types and default screen scheme for both projects.\r\n# Add a new custom field with any name. You can use \"label\" for example.\r\n# In the configuration section for newly created field, make it available to any issue type and restrict the scope of this field to just the two newly created projects.\r\n# In the screen association for this field, select default screen.\r\n# Add a user to first project with create issue rights. This user must not have any rights over second project.\r\n# Using this user, create a new issue in first project and enter some value for the \"label\" field.\r\n# When the issue is created and displayed on screen, click on the newly created label.\r\n# At this point, the error screen is displayed. It shows the query that is trying to search for this custom field in both projects. Something like:\r\n{noformat}\r\nproject in (\"10000\", \"10001\") AND cf[10000] = xxx\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nWith error on top: *The value '10001' does not exist for the field 'project'.*\r\n\r\nIf you sign in with a user who has permissions on both projects, no error is displayed and the query returns the results.\r\n\r\nEdit\r\nEssentially a jql that points towards a project/issue or anything that the user does not have access to, this error will show up. Instead, the query should be ran despite the user not having this access, and the results should be filtered according to the users permissions afterwards. Customers can work around this issue by making the specific field a global field, and hide it from the screens in the projects it isn't relevant to.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\nIf you need to keep the current custom field context configuration, then you can implement a JavaScript based workaround to modify the target URL after the page is loaded to the user.\r\nYou can use the [Announcement Banner|https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiraserver/configuring-an-announcement-banner-938846985.html] to add the [custom JavaScript code|https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirakb/how-to-hide-elements-in-jira-using-css-or-javascript-958774526.html]. You may use a different path based on how you administer Jira, such as through [ScriptRunner|https://docs.adaptavist.com/sr4js/latest/features/script-fragments].\r\n\r\nThe script is the following -- note you need to modify {{customfield_11111}} based on your custom field:\r\n{code}\r\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\r\nAJS.$( document ).ajaxComplete(function( event,request, settings ) {\r\n\tif(settings.url.indexOf('AjaxIssue') >= 0){\r\n\t\tconsole.debug(\"Executing javascript for JRASERVER-27618 workaround.\");\r\n\t\tAJS.$('div#customfield_11111-val > div.labels-wrap.value > ul.labels > li').each(function(){\r\n\t\t\tif ($( this ).children('a.lozenge') && $( this ).html().indexOf('jql=project') >= 0){\r\n\t\t\t\tvar atag = $( this ).children('a.lozenge')[0];\r\n\t\t\t\tvar currentHref = atag.attributes.href.value;\r\n\t\t\t\tatag.attributes.href.value = currentHref.replace(/jql=project.*\\+AND\\+/g, \"jql=\");\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t});\r\n\t}\r\n});\r\n</script>\r\n{code}",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-27613].\n  {panel}\n\n*Background*\r\nJIRA does not natively support the idea of field level security (JRA-1330), the most popular of which is the ability to the hide Time Tracking fields from customers (JRA-2364). We know that a lot of customers really want a way for JIRA to solve this kind of problem. \r\n\r\n*View Ports*\r\nInternally at Atlassian we have been throwing around the idea of what we call \"View Ports\". The idea behind this is that admins can configure an alternative view of the JIRA View Issue screen for different groups. One of the items that can be configured is the ability to choose what fields are shown in the View Port. \r\n\r\n*Example Scenario*\r\nYou have a company that specialises in custom development solutions and have 10 internal staff members with 200 external customers. You want to manage all your issues in one JIRA project but you do not want to expose the time tracking fields to your customers.\r\n\r\n*View Port Solution*\r\n1. Admin creates a JIRA group for all the 'external customers'. \r\n2. Admin then creates a View Port for this group only.\r\n3. Admin configures the View Port to show all fields except time tracking. \r\n\r\nWhen anyone in the 'external customers' group logs into a specific url, they are taken to this View Port. They will not be able to login into the normal JIRA system.\r\n\r\n*Comments Please*\r\nWe'd love to get your feedback in this solution and if it would work for your company. ",

My thought on the matter is, if I am the one that made the modification, why should I have to be notified? Notifications make sense for when someone else has made a notification, not for when I make a notification. If I make a change to an issue in which I am not the creator/watching it I don't get notified, this practice seems correct. So the issue seems to be that if I created/watch the issue I get notified of every change regardless if I made the change or someone else did. I purpose that a change be made so that regardless of your notification settings, you do not get notified of changes made by yourself.",

Suggested Solution\r\n* Creating a JQL function that can search for @ Mentions would be ideal\r\n* Or extending the comment field to be searchable by user accounts mentioned within it\r\n\r\nh3. Why this is important\r\n\r\nIt would be very helpful to be able to search, filter, and generally organize issues where you have been mentioned directly.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\nNone\r\n\r\nh3.

JiraUserPreferences holds a reference to the JiraCachingPropertySet returned by the DefaultUserPropertyManager at the time of construction.\n* These two interfaces are supposed to be backed by the same data, but since the DefaultUserPreferencesManager can hold onto JCPS references after  DefaultUserPropertyManager has discarded them, the system can get into an inconsistent state.\n\nTo reproduce:\n* Log in as a user\n* Navigate to the user's profile page\n* Wait (a little over) 30 minutes\n* Change the user's locale\n\nExpected results:\n* Provided the session has not timed out completely, the user's preferences should update normally and be applied immediately (the UI language should change).\n\nActual results:\n* The results seem to update, but do not take effect\n* The locale's value will be displayed correctly, but the translations are still in the previous language selection.\n* This inconsistent state persists indefinitely\n\nWorkaround:\n* Nothing simple.  It is not fixed by logging out and back in.\n\nTechnical note:\n* You can reproduce this without the 30 minute wait by calling DefaultUserPropertyManager's psCache.invalidateAll() after the user has logged in.\n\n\n",

Create a sub-task that uses an workflow with the event above.\r\n\r\n3. Promote the workflow of this sub-task until the referred close step.\r\n\r\n4. Clone the sub-task above to another sub-task.

I will attach an example Screenshot. \r\n\r\nThe visual difference with the labeling is that before, labels on the X-Axis were not tilted 45 degrees. Therefore all those labels appeared just as a dotted line which I must admit was not readable either. But the point is that now labels appear as a big heap of pixels disturbing the complete layout of the graphics and making it too confusing to use it in reports (which we need to do very often). And we're not able to get rid of this. There is no gadget configuration to \"do not tilt x-axis labels\" and none to \"turn axis labels off\".\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nRuchi",
