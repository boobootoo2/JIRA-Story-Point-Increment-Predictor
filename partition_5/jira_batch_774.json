If you want to share it with all the project role(s), ensure yourself included in *ALL* the roles. Just because you are in the *JIRA Administrators* group, it doesn't entitle you to have the ability to share the dashboard / filters to other roles. *JIRA System Administrator* should have that power since they control the whole *JIRA* itself.\r\n\r\nHowever, here is the users explanation on how this issue should be looked at, from a different perspective:\r\n{quote}\r\nMy view on a project lead is that he/she should be able to decide the accessibility of info freely within his/hers project to any level of project members without having to be involved into the deepest levels of the project. He/she should be able to sure that work is progressed/done according to the original plan. Project lead IS the utter responsible of the success of the project and should be able to give resources to the project members without any further settings but to be set as project lead.\r\n\r\nOf course there might be some security issues which comes with this but they are at the most very remote and dependent on other settings in that case.\r\n\r\nOf course getting the project lead level should not override other permission levels. Better safe than sorry.\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nAny thoughts on this? Perhaps this can be considered in the future release of *JIRA*?",

However, no access to User Directories\r\n- Project administrator: Access to Users (but not User Directories) and Projects\r\n\r\nHaving the option to only give full access or none affects our decision as a company whether to or not to fully move to Jira: we already have it in our organization but it is only being used in some geographical locations. \r\n\r\nSome teams currently use Assembla or other tools just because they cannot get the access they need from the Jira administrators. Much of this has to do with the inability to create workflows and custom fields.

New Feature Request to allow an issue to appear in more than one project.\r\n\r\nBecause an issue in my industry (semiconductor manufacturing) involves several different disciplines, a single issue during its life cycle may involve several projects, and there is no clear single project where the issue belongs.\r\n\r\nWe only have the choice of moving an issue from one project to another, or cloning the issue from one project to another.\r\n\r\nMoving is of some use since the issue numbering is permanent: if FOO-1 is moved to BAR-9, then subsequent access to FOO-1 will be forwarded to the issue BAR-9. But the FOO-1 issue no longer appears when browsing or searching the FOO project.\r\n\r\nThe other alternative is cloning; this has been very problematic for us since they are independent copies in multiple projects, and when we update an issue and add comments/attachments, they don't appear in the copy.\r\n\r\nIn addition to moving and cloning, it would be helpful to have an option to \"shadow\" an issue into multiple projects, so the issue has an issue number in all projects, and can be browsed/searched in all projects, but adding/modifying the issue in any of those projects will be seen in any other project. (I guess kind of like a hard link in an OS.)\r\n",
