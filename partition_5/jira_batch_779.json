      "description": "Symptoms: in JIRA 5.2.8, web resources provided by plugins (via WebResourceTransformer) are broken and don't work, because the meaning of DownloadableResource.isResourceModified() has been reversed. An example is Structure Plugin, which serves localized JS strings through web transformer. In 5.2.8, the transformer gives zero content, resulting in https://jira.almworks.com/browse/HJ-1182 \r\n\r\nThe cause of the change is likely JRA-31665\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\nInvestigation:\r\n\r\n1. The code that serves DownloadableResource -- {{PluginResourceDownload.serveFile()}}\r\n\r\natlassian-plugins-webresource:2.10.1 \r\n{code}\r\n            if(downloadableResource.isResourceModified(request, response))\r\n            {\r\n                log.info(\"Plugin Resource has been modified since plugin was loaded. Skipping: \" + requestUri);\r\n                return;\r\n            }\r\n{code}\r\n\r\natlassian-plugins-webresource:2.13.4 \r\n{code}\r\n            // Don't try and calculate isResourceModified if it's a cacheable resource - answer is always false.\r\n            if(cacheableResource && !downloadableResource.isResourceModified(request, response))\r\n            {\r\n                // 304\r\n                return;\r\n            }\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nAs you can see:\r\n- the meaning is reversed in 2.13.4, NOT is added to the condition - this breaks plugins;\r\n- in version 2.10.1, the physical meaning is in fact \"is resource *not* modified\", because it shouldn't be served if it's NOT been modified\r\n- in version 2.10.1, the author of the log message seems to have no idea what's this all about, the message does not make sense whatsoever\r\n- in version 2.13.4, the author of the comment also has problems describing the logic, because it contradicts the code that follows\r\n\r\n2. Let's take a look at the API - {{DownloadableResource.isResourceModified()}}. Funny thing, it hasn't changed from 2.10.1 to 2.13.4:\r\n{code}\r\n    /**\r\n     * Returns true if the plugin resource has been modified. The implementing class is responsible for\r\n     * setting any appropriate response codes or headers on the response.\r\n     *\r\n     * If the resource has been modified, the resource shouldn't be served. \r\n     */\r\n    boolean isResourceModified(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response);\r\n{code}\r\n\r\n- Clearly, the same problems with logic here. If the resource *has* been modified, then it *should* be served. But the comment says the opposite. \r\n- But, this broken logic was supported by the correct implementation of the broken logic in 2.10.1 - so everything worked for plugins whose authors had worked this out. In 2.13.4, you have broken implementation of the broken logic.\r\n\r\n3. Now, looking at a standard implementation of a DownloadableResource - {{AbstractDownloadableResource.isResourceModified()}}. The mess continues.\r\n\r\natlassian-plugins-webresource:2.10.1 \r\n{code}\r\n    /**\r\n     * Checks any \"If-Modified-Since\" header from the request against the\r\n     * plugin's loading time, since plugins can't be modified after they've been\r\n     * loaded this is a good way to determine if a plugin resource has been\r\n     * modified or not. If this method returns true, don't do any more\r\n     * processing on the request -- the response code has already been set to\r\n     * \"304 Not Modified\" for you, and you don't need to serve the file.\r\n     */\r\n    public boolean isResourceModified(final HttpServletRequest httpServletRequest, final HttpServletResponse httpServletResponse)\r\n    {\r\n        final Date resourceLastModifiedDate = (plugin.getDateLoaded() == null) ? new Date() : plugin.getDateLoaded();\r\n        final LastModifiedHandler lastModifiedHandler = new LastModifiedHandler(resourceLastModifiedDate);\r\n        return lastModifiedHandler.checkRequest(httpServletRequest, httpServletResponse);\r\n    }\r\n{code}\r\n\r\natlassian-plugins-webresource:2.13.4 \r\n{code}\r\n    /**\r\n     * Checks any \"If-Modified-Since\" header from the request against the\r\n     * plugin's loading time, since plugins can't be modified after they've been\r\n     * loaded this is a good way to determine if a plugin resource has been\r\n     * modified or not. If this method returns true, don't do any more\r\n     * processing on the request -- the response code has already been set to\r\n     * \"304 Not Modified\" for you, and you don't need to serve the file.\r\n     */\r\n    public boolean isResourceModified(final HttpServletRequest httpServletRequest, final HttpServletResponse httpServletResponse)\r\n    {\r\n        final Date resourceLastModifiedDate = (plugin.getDateLoaded() == null) ? new Date() : plugin.getDateLoaded();\r\n        final LastModifiedHandler lastModifiedHandler = new LastModifiedHandler(resourceLastModifiedDate);\r\n        return !lastModifiedHandler.checkRequest(httpServletRequest, httpServletResponse);\r\n    }\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nI intentionally added the whole text with the comments so you can see that:\r\n- the result of the method is reversed in 2.13.4 (so this implementation works with the reversed logic)\r\n- but the comment and the description stays the same, adding to the confusion\r\n\r\n\r\n--------\r\n\r\nOverall, this is a total mess, both working and non-working versions. \r\n\r\nAs a plugin developer, I find it a painful change in the API, which happens to be introduced in a patch version. If this change is going to stay, it will require us to produce multiple binaries, for 5.0-5.2.7 and for 5.2.8+. So please please fix this somehow! \r\n\r\nAs version 2.13.4 is broken in logic, I would suggest the following approach:\r\n- Please deprecate {{isResourceModified()}} and reverse its meaning and implementation back to 2.10.1, so the plugins functionality is restored.\r\n- Please create a new method with a good, conventional name, which correctly relates what the method does - for example {{processUnmodifiedResource()}}. Don't call it \"isSomething\" because of the expected side-effect (setting the headers). Don't call it \"isXYZ\" if it returns *false* in case of XYZ.\r\n- Please update javadocs, comments, log messages or share the stuff you smoke \\;)\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\nIgor\r\n\r\n\r\n",

The current functionality edits and saves each field individually as it is edited, and the edit is triggered via a single click which results in unanticipated changes to fields and user confusion.\r\n\r\nMy Suggestion to resolve this is as follows:\r\n# Enter Inline Edit mode by double clicking on a field that can be edited.\r\n# Once in Inline Edit mode, allow subsequent fields to be edited via a single click.\r\n# Once editing is complete, user must click a Save button on the issue to commit all changes at the same time.\r\n\r\nThese changes will prevent users from accidentally changing fields on an issue while still keeping it easy to change multiple fields.  Then the single Save button which will commit all changes will then also prevent multiple Issue Updated Events from being triggered and flooding users with emails.  This also has some added benefits such as allowing plugins the ability to tap into that save function in order to validate fields and also enable field dependencies.\r\n\r\nPlease vote!",

[See the corresponding bug report|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-32032].\n  {panel}\n\nThere's a problem with how the autowatch plugin updates issues to update their watch count.\r\n\r\nOn receiving created or commented events via the AutoWatchService it calls addWatcher passing in the issue from the event:\r\n{noformat}\r\n @EventListener\r\n    public void onIssueEvent(final IssueEvent event)\r\n    {\r\n        if (watcherService.isWatchingEnabled())\r\n        {\r\n            final User user = event.getUser();\r\n            if (user != null && isEnabled(user) && isAutowatchEvent(event))\r\n            {\r\n                watcherService.addWatcher(event.getIssue(), user, user);\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nThis code then eventually calls:\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\n        Long watches = issue.getLong(\"watches\");\r\n\r\n        if (watches == null)\r\n        {\r\n            watches = 0L;\r\n        }\r\n        watches = watches + adjustValue;\r\n\r\n        if (watches < 0)\r\n        {\r\n            watches = 0L;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        issue.set(\"watches\", watches);\r\n        issue.store();\r\n\r\n        try\r\n        {\r\n            indexManager.reIndex(issue);\r\n        }\r\n        catch (final IndexException e)\r\n        {\r\n            log.error(\"Exception re-indexing issue \" + e, e);\r\n        }\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nThis is bad for serveral reasons:\r\n* It saves all fields back to the database rather than just 'watches'\r\n* It uses an issue GV from the event which may be stale at the time of processing\r\n* It doesn't call the issue update manager to update the issue\r\n\r\nThis can lead to weird behaviour if you have other listeners that update issues.\r\n\r\nFor example this can happen:\r\n* User creates issue (default assignee is 'admin')\r\n* Listener one handles this event and auto-assigns the issue to 'fred'\r\n* Autowatch listener handles the create and increases the watch count. By doing so it saves all fields which came from the original create event therefore overriding the assignee with 'admin' again\r\n\r\nThere's no way to guarantee ordering of events so this is hard to work around.  I think this can also lead to concurrent edit issues:\r\n* User fred comments on issue\r\n* User barney edits issue priority to 'Critical'\r\n* Autowatch listener handles fred commented event and increases watchers. At the same time it overrides barney's priority edit with the original priority.\r\n\r\nTo fix this we should change the AutoWatch plugin to either use JIRA's issueManager.updateIssue() which does the correct thing, or at the very least create an updateGV copy with *only* the fields that have to be updated in the DB.",

This is suboptimal:\r\n\r\n * You have a project _key_, which -- in typical applications -- is used for identification of an object in processes that are not-so-visible to the user.  Filters are just such an application where use of a _key_ would be preferable to the use of the _name_, which would typically be used only for display purposes.\r\n * Use of the project key (which cannot be changed) gives some stability to the filter.  Instead, use of the project name means any change in project name will cause user filters to break _en masse_.  I had just such a scenario earlier this week where I changed the name on 50 projects.  I got a lot of flack from my users because their filters broke and they had no idea why.

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-32006].\n  {panel}\n\nGreetings,\r\n\r\nFrom the documentation 'Road Map', 'Change Log ', and 'Versions' Project Tabs Are Not Visible (link below), it requires additional information to be added on for customer to cross check first before the suggestion actions in the documentation.\r\n\r\n* https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/%27Road+Map%27,+%27Change+Log+%27,+and+%27Versions%27+Project+Tabs+Are+Not+Visible\r\n\r\nSuggested replacement to the first paragraph of the documentation:\r\n{quote}\r\nSometimes users cannot view the Road Map, Change Log, and Versions project tab panels under the Browse Project page. By default, Road Map, Change Log and Versions tab panels will be visible if at least a version is created on the project. \r\n\r\nHowever, there are times that the Road Map, Change Log, and Versions project tab panels still not visible despite having a version on the project. This is usually because the \ufeffFix version/s field is configure as hidden or the Road Map Panel, Change Log Panel, and Versions Panel plugin has been disabled in Project Panels Plugin.\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nThis will at least notify customer that a version is required for the tab panels to be displayed on the first place.\r\n\r\nHope this is clear enough, thanks :)",

However, a lot of us can't do that so we end up jumping several versions when we upgrade. The what's new items are lost.  There is an inverse problem that some what's new items aren't actually relevant to specific sites but we have an all or nothing approach.\r\n\r\nI'd like to be able to (1) specify what features are covered in what's new, and (2) to be able to include features from previous releases.  Real nice would be (3) the ability to add your own what's new items to cover site-specific changes, eg, changes to custom workflows.\r\n\r\nThis library approach could be used as ongoing training too when something needs to be communicated to users asynchronously to version upgrades.  It would also be linked to a menu item to allow users to refresh an update that had checked off previously.       ",

The application is very slow during the process of syntonization. \r\nHere are my questions\r\n1. In general do you know if you login to JIRA with your AD credential does JIRA goes to LDAP & authenticates the user or does it authenticate against the active cache that it holds (copy of LDAP).\r\n2. There is an attribute : \"directory.cache.synchronise.interval\": \"3600\" that defines the synchronize interval. How can I change synchronise interval to 1 day.\r\n3.

Use case\r\n# An LDAP user directory in JIRA is created with 'Read Only with Local Groups'\r\n# An LDAP user is then placed in a local group, e.g. 'jira-users'\r\n# Later, it is decided that this group's memberships will be handled in LDAP, and a group of the same name is created (again for example 'jira-users')\r\n\r\nThe result is that the LDAP 'jira-users' members never get synced over since there's already an existing local group of the same name that contained at least one LDAP member at some point in time.\r\n\r\nh4. Purpose\r\nThe purpose of this improvement request is to investigate a way allow the LDAP group to override the local group in this senario. In the mean time, there's a workaround, detailed below.\r\n\r\nh4. Workaround\r\nWhen the LDAP user is placed in the local group, a new row will be created in the _cwd_group_ table associating the local group with the _directory_id_ of the LDAP user directory. The row will have the _local_ column set to '1' indicating that it is not a group from LDAP.\r\n\r\nThis flag, when set to '1', apparently keeps the LDAP group of the same name from syncing.\r\n\r\n# Shut down JIRA\r\n# Update the row such that the _local_ column is set to '0'\r\n# Start JIRA, which will trigger a sync on startup\r\n\r\nPlease note the impact this will have on your user memberships:\r\n* Local users and groups are not affected\r\n* LDAP users in the local group will no longer have that membership relationship\r\n* LDAP users will now belong in the LDAP group of the same name",

currently ugly pluginsettings storage (where everything is split across multiple DB rows)\r\n* Adding temporary cache headers to this response so not every single end-user page-pop hits JAC.

Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n# Copy the default JIRA workflow.\r\n# Edit a transition (such as start progress) to add an 'Update Issue Field' post-function, setting the Issue Field 'Time Spent' to 5m.\r\n# Set up a workflow scheme for that issue and assign it to a project.\r\n# Use the transition that that is supposed to set the time spent.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nThis Issue Field is not available at all - setting it can mess up GreenHopper's time calculation.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nNothing happens.\r\n\r\nh3.
