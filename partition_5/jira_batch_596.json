Problem Definition\r\nThe very helpful sprint estimate summary that is available for planned sprints on the backlog view as ilustrated below, isn't displayed in a few scenarios.\r\n !Selection_544.jpg|thumbnail! \r\nThis summary is very useful as it allows you to have an overview of the sprint estimation without any additional clicks. The following are some scenarios where you don't have this summary displayed:\r\n* When the sprint panel is collapsed, this estimate summary disappears.\r\n !Selection_545.jpg|thumbnail! \r\n* The estimate is also not displayed for active sprints, only planned sprints.\r\n !Selection_547.jpg|thumbnail! \r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n* Keep the estimate summary at the bottom of a collapsed panel, there's still plenty of empty space to display it for the collapsed panel as currently is. \r\n* Display the estimate summary for active sprints as well.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\nThere is a button (with 3 dots or ellipsis) underneath the sprint name that can actually be used to preview a more detailed sprint estimate summary as illustrated below. Although it requires an additional click to display, it's a consistent way to always be able to see the sprint estimate summary from backlog view:\r\n !Selection_546.jpg|thumbnail! ",

      "description": "h3. Summary\r\n\r\nActive Objects library, which presents the abtraction for data types and object relational mapping, does not work consistently across supported platforms, hence migration fails.\r\n\r\nWhen migrating from another database (I.e. mySQL) to Oracle database, using an XML export generated from source system, following exception appears in the logs;\r\n{noformat}\r\nORA-12899: value too large for column \"JIRA3L\".\"AO_544E33_AUDIT_LOG_ENTRY\".\"ISSUE_SUMMARY\" (actual: 263, maximum: 255)\r\n{noformat}\r\nThis happens with an third-party app that has defined a string column with length 255. In the MySQL database it was possible to store 255 characters, no matter which kind of characters was used. E.g. it is possible to store 255 Chinese characters. In Oracle the column is created as VARCHAR2(255 BYTE). But in order to store 255 special characters, the suitable data type in Oracle would be VARCHAR2(255 CHAR). So the reason for the exception is, that 255 special characters need more than 255 bytes, but the column definition in Oracle is limited to 255 byte.\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nA test to recreate the problem is provided at JRASERVER-62833. Quoting;\r\n{code:java}\r\n// class \r\nimport net.java.ao.*;\r\nimport net.java.ao.schema.StringLength;\r\nimport net.java.ao.schema.Table;\r\n\r\n@Table(\"T_TEST_CLASS\")\r\npublic interface TestClassAO extends Entity {\r\nString TEST_FIELD_ID = \"C_TEST_FIELD\";\r\n\r\n@Accessor(TEST_FIELD_ID)\r\n@StringLength(6)\r\nString getTestField();\r\n}\r\n\r\n// run test \r\nmyActiveObjects.create(TestClassAO.class, new DBParam(TestClassAO.TEST_FIELD_ID, \"\u043f\u0440\u0438\u0432\u0435\u0442\"));\r\n{code}\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nMigration is successful, and all AO data are transferred to new database successfully.\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nMigration fails with ORA-12899 error.\r\nh3.

Environment\r\n\r\nJIRA 7.x - JIRA 8.0.1 linked to *multiple* github and / or bitbucket accounts\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Create at least two OAuth applications in GitHub and / or Bitbucket. Take a note of the Client IDs and Security Keys for the created accounts\r\n # Link JIRA to these applications via JIRA -> DVCS Accounts -> Link Bitbucket Cloud or GitHub account\r\n # On the latest configured account in JIRA -> DVCS Accounts select tripple dots menu to the right of the account and select \"Reset OAuth Settings\", \"Configure OAuth for account [accountname]\" should come up - take a note of the current key and authorizing account\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nJIRA should display the correct \"Current Key\" value and \"Authorizing account\" and should allow to reset the account token\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nJIRA shows \"Current Key\" and \"Authorizing account\" value of the very first DVCS account configured which is incorrect (and it actually shows the same key and authorizing account across all other DVCS accounts in JIRA) As a result, unable to reset the OAuth settings as per the ticket summary.\r\n When trying to Edit the settings (i.e. click EDIT on the Configure OAuth for account [accountname]\" and proceeding to change the Key and Secret, and then hitting \"Regenerate Access Token\" - JIRA comes up with \"OAuth key must not be blank\" value even though the values are filled in\r\nh3. Notes\r\n\r\nThis happens only when multiple DVCS accounts are present in JIRA. When there's only one DVCS account configured, there's no issue\r\nh3. Workaround I\r\n\r\nDelete the DVCS account that requires token renewal in JIRA and re-add it\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround II\r\n\r\n* Identify your organization ID by hitting https://<base-url>/rest/bitbucket/1.0/repositories. You're looking for an organizationId value that matches the organization you want, which you can tell from the repositoryUrl value.\r\n* Using Postman or curl, make a x-www-form-urlencoded POST to https://<base-url>/rest/bitbucket/1.0/org/<org-id>/oauth, passing the parameters\r\n{panel}\r\norganizationId: <org-id>\r\nkey: <key>\r\nsecret: <secret>\r\n{panel}\r\n* If you want, you can confirm this worked by running SELECT * FROM AO_E8B6CC_ORGANIZATION_MAPPING in your DB and confirming that the values are in place (directly modifying this table is likely another route to solving this problem, but would likely require a restart and the next step to take effect).\r\n* In your browser, hit https://<base-url>/secure/admin/RegenerateGithubEnterpriseOauthToken.jspa?organization=<org-id>, click Retry if prompted, then authorize the app on the GHE side.\r\n\r\n",

During the import process, the import may fail to create some issues for various reasons such as missing statuses, post-function, etc. After the import is finished, Jira displays post-import detailed logs to show the number of issues that were imported successfully and the number of those failed.\r\n\r\nIn certain cases, the logs report inaccurate results in the number of issues that have been created and the issues that need to be re-indexed.\r\n\r\nFor example, the below logs are for an import of two issues, with only *one* issue that was successfully created:\r\n{code:java}\r\n2019-02-22 23:18:44,022 INFO - Importing issue: [externalId='autoid-7605094558926580211', summary='Import fails']\r\n2019-02-22 23:18:44,033 ERROR - Error importing issue [externalId='autoid-7605094558926580211', summary='Import fails']\r\ncom.atlassian.jira.plugins.importer.external.ExternalException: Status UNKNOW1 cannot be found in JIRA neither by name and id\r\n\tat com.atlassian.jira.plugins.importer.imports.importer.impl.ExternalUtils.normalizeStatus(ExternalUtils.java:219)\r\n...\r\n2019-02-22 23:18:44,034 INFO - Importing issue: [externalId='autoid-6008772327090099268', summary='Success']\r\n2019-02-22 23:18:44,696 INFO - Reindexing last 1 issues imported ...\r\n2019-02-22 23:18:44,768 INFO - Reindexing took 65 ms.\r\n2019-02-22 23:18:44,770 INFO - 2 issues successfully created \r\n2019-02-22 23:18:44,771 INFO - ------------------------------\r\n2019-02-22 23:18:44,772 INFO - Finished Importing : Issues\r\n...\r\n2019-02-22 23:18:44,774 INFO - ------------------------------\r\n2019-02-22 23:18:44,774 INFO - No issues need to be reindexed.{code}\r\nHere is the corresponding screenshot:\r\n\r\n!image-2019-02-23-00-29-44-100.png|width=98,height=71!\r\n\r\nIn the above logs, the report shows that 2 issues were created and no further issues need to be re-indexed.
