But there are cases when one simply wants to establish a relationship between two issues without implying a direction. For example, we use \"is related to\". But, in order to make this work, we must define both an inward and outward relationship. So we have made both \"is related to\". This sort of works, except that, when linking issues, you get a pulldown menu with \"is related to\" listed twice. This looks rather peculiar to the users.\r\n\r\nLooking at Atlassian's JIRA issue database, I see that you have evaded this problem by defining \"is related to\" and \"relates to\". But this is really just a hack as these two relations are apparently the same. This makes the user wonder which one s/he should pick.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, the solution to this is for JIRA to allow the inward and outward relation to be the same when creating issue link types. This would essentially codify the concept that some issue linking is directional and some is not.",

(see attachment)\r\nWhen creating an issue, if you know the name of the component, why scroll down, when you can type in the first letters and pinpoint it out right away?

This home page uses NTLM/IWA to authenticate users, so I get a username but not a password. If I could connect to JIRA as a known, single account (e.g. \"intranet\") and then call JiraSoapServiceService.impersonate(\"joe.bloggs\") then I'd be able to be logged in as joe.bloggs without actually needing his password. Naturally the \"intranet\" account would need to have some kind of \"can impersonate\" permission set up on it.\r\n\r\nLooking at the RPC code it seems that it might just be as simple as adding an \"impersonate\" method to the tokenManager that does something like:\r\n{quote}\r\n{{public void impersonate(String token, String username) throws RemoteAuthenticationException, RemotePermissionException}}\r\n{\r\n  {{User currentUser = retrieveUser(token);}}\r\n  {{if(!permissionManager.hasPermission(Permissions.IMPERSONATE, currentUser)) throw new RemotePermissionException(\"No permission to perform operation\");}}\r\n  {{User newUser = UserUtils.getUser(username);}}\r\n  {{synchronized(tokens)}} {\r\n    {{tokens.put(token, newUser);}}\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n{quote}\r\nand then adding the relevant code to the interface itself to expose this method.",

In the long run (JIRA 3.11) we should move the searchers from teh ThreadLocalQueryProfiler to another class.\r\n\r\nThe workaround for this problem at the moment is to restart JIRA and re-index your JIRA instance.",

I think the empty dropdown is there because I have only one issue type for subtasks. So no other one can be choosen to change. In projects where I have other sub-task issue types the problem doesn't exist.\r\n\r\nIt's an reproducable bug.\r\n\r\nPossible Solution:\r\nThere should be a query in the code whether there is another issue type left that the subtask can be changed to. If there is no one a message should pop-up or the option \"change issue type\" should not be available.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nIrene\r\n",

Let's call it 'config'. The structure of that folder will have to follow the package arborescence implemented in Jira.\r\n\r\n. when we want to customize a property of a property file, then we place a properties file with the same name and arborescence of the original one, but containing only the customized property, not the unchanged ones\r\n\r\nWhen the JIra engine is loading properties/resources, it proceeds as usual, and, finally, loads the ones from that 'config' folder, then overriding the system properties.\r\n\r\nThe benefits are:\r\n. Customization are localized in the 'config' folder, not mixed with default settings\r\n. When upgrading, this folder is not overwritten, and we can easily use it on other installations.\r\n\r\nThat technic could also be used for templates, where only the complete file would be overriden.\r\n",

A very nice example is your own Jira: there are more than 11000 issues for project Jira and a lot of old/resolved/duplicated issues is returned as serach results and so on. Additionaly, there are many very old unresolved bugs, which are lost in huge amount of issues. The goal of suggested feature is to give more transparency for projec managers, developers and other users. There are some additional suggestions (maybe \"usage rules\") about this functionality:\r\n\r\n# Only resolved issue can be archived.\r\n# Archived issues are ignored in search results/filters by default.\r\n# Issues can be archived manually.\r\n# There is configurable \"issue age treshold\" for each project specifying how much time after last resolution of issue it will be archived. Maybe 2 years is a reasonable default.\r\n",
