(Optional) Update Jira base URL on gadgets and issue contents\r\n\r\nText gadgets, issue descriptions and issue comments can have text that mention the production Jira URL. This could cause confusion as users would be directed to the production Jira upon clicking on the test Jira links.\r\n The below MDL commands should replace the old URL for the new one:\r\n{code:sql}\r\nupdate gadgetuserpreference set userprefvalue = REPLACE(userprefvalue, '//prod.jira.base.url', '//test.jira.base.url') where userprefvalue like '%//prod.jira.base.url%';\r\n{code}\r\n{code:sql}\r\nupdate jiraissue set description = REPLACE(description, '//prod.jira.base.url', '//test.jira.base.url') where description like '%//prod.jira.base.url%';\r\n{code}\r\n{code:sql}\r\nupdate jiraaction set actionbody = REPLACE(actionbody, '//prod.jira.base.url', '//test.jira.base.url') where actiontype = 'comment' and actionbody like '%//prod.jira.base.url%';\r\n{code}\r\nAgain, replacing {{prod}} and {{test.jira.base.url}} with the respective production and test Jira base URLs. Eg. jira.atlassian.com and jira-test.atlassian.com.\r\nThe updates above, with the {{replace}} function, were written for Postgres DB. You may need to tweak them to work on your own database type.\r\n{panel}\r\nh2. 2) Right after \"Start Jira in test environment\"\r\n{panel}\r\nh3. 7. Update webhooks\r\n\r\nSo that the Test environment doesn't trigger production webhooks, they should be edited in the new environment to be either disabled or changed to Test webhooks.\r\n Please refer to the [Managing webhooks|https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiracloud/managing-webhooks-776636231.html] documentation on how to accomplish that.\r\nh3. 10. (Optional) Change the look and feel\r\n\r\nIt's a good practice to change the look and feel of the Test instance to hav a different logo or color scheme than Production. This will help users to distinguish between the two environments and don't rely solely on the URL.\r\n Refer to our [Configuring the look and feel of your Jira applications|https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiraserver/configuring-the-look-and-feel-of-your-jira-applications-938846975.html] documentation for guidance.\r\n{panel}\r\nh2. 3) On the top panel with links/table-of-contents\r\n{panel}\r\nThe suggested license to apply to a non-prod environment is a [Developer License|https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirakb/get-a-developer-license-for-jira-server-744526918.html], not an Evaluation License. The customer should only go for an Evaluation License if they don't have a Developer License tied to their main license.\r\n{panel}\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nHere's how the numbering will show up after the suggestions above:\r\n{code:java}\r\n1.

Issue Summary\r\n\r\nAt present, user deletions during directory syncs do not utilize any indexes on the *cwd_membership* table, meaning each deletion requires in a _*full table scan*_.

There is an index that _would_ _be_ suitable if the query utilized _lower_child_name_ instead:\r\n{code:sql}\r\n\"idx_mem_dir_child\" btree (lower_child_name, membership_type, directory_id){code}\r\n\r\nlist of all indexes for the table *cwd_membership*:\r\n{code:sql}\r\n    \"pk_cwd_membership\" PRIMARY KEY, btree (id)\r\n    \"uk_mem_parent_child_type\" UNIQUE, btree (parent_id, child_id, membership_type)\r\n    \"idx_mem_dir_child\" btree (lower_child_name, membership_type, directory_id)\r\n    \"idx_mem_dir_parent\" btree (lower_parent_name, membership_type, directory_id)\r\n    \"idx_mem_dir_parent_child\" btree (lower_parent_name, lower_child_name, membership_type, directory_id)\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Generate a large number of users and groups in local Jira directory or remote directory; ensure users have one or more group memberships\r\n # If using a remote directory, perform a full sync and observe elapsed time for deletions\r\n # If using a local directory, delete group memberships for a single user using the following query and benchmark the time:\r\n{code:sql}\r\ndelete from cwd_membership where membership_type='GROUP_USER' and child_name='<username>' and directory_id=<id>;{code}\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nDeletion should utilize a covering index to be efficient.\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nDeletion results in a full table scan. Here's a practical example from a customer with over 3 million rows in their cwd_membership table, and a deletion of a single user's group memberships that took over 7 seconds:\r\n{code:none}\r\nexplain analyze delete from cwd_membership where membership_type='GROUP_USER' and child_name='<username>' and directory_id=10000;\r\nQUERY PLAN\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nDelete on cwd_membership (cost=0.00..103367.51 rows=86 width=6) (actual time=7311.263..7311.263 rows=0 loops=1)\r\n-> Seq Scan on cwd_membership (cost=0.00..103367.51 rows=86 width=6) (actual time=755.912..7308.464 rows=95 loops=1)\r\nFilter: (((membership_type)::text = 'GROUP_USER'::text) AND ((child_name)::text = '<username>'::text) AND (directory_id = '10000'::numeric))\r\nRows Removed by Filter: 3003405\r\nPlanning time: 0.155 ms\r\nExecution time: 7311.305 ms\r\n{code}\r\nWhen deleting several users this drastically slows down sync time. A sync example from the same customer that took 243 seconds to delete 134 users' group memberships:\r\n{code:none}\r\n Caesium-1-3 INFO [c.a.crowd.directory.DbCachingRemoteChangeOperations] deleted [ 134 ] users in [ 243102ms ]\r\n{code}\r\nAdding a covering index drastically reduces these sync times, deleting 243 users' group memberships in 1.7 seconds:\r\n{code:none}\r\nCaesium-1-1 INFO [c.a.crowd.directory.DbCachingRemoteChangeOperations] deleted [ 243 ] users in [ 1724ms ]\r\n{code}\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nAdd a new composite indexing covering query predicates:\r\n{code:sql}\r\ncreate index idx_mem_child_dir on cwd_membership (membership_type,child_name,directory_id);{code}\r\nWith this the query planner will use an index scan, rather than a full table scan:\r\n{code:none}\r\nexplain (analyze,buffers) delete from cwd_membership where membership_type='GROUP_USER' and child_name ='<username>' and directory_id =1;\r\n                                                                    QUERY PLAN\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n Delete on cwd_membership  (cost=0.28..11.84 rows=3 width=6) (actual time=0.096..0.096 rows=0 loops=1)\r\n   Buffers: shared hit=9 dirtied=3\r\n   ->  Index Scan using idx_mem_child_dir on cwd_membership  (cost=0.28..11.84 rows=3 width=6) (actual time=0.016..0.019 rows=3 loops=1)\r\n         Index Cond: (((membership_type)::text = 'GROUP_USER'::text) AND ((child_name)::text = '<username>'::text) AND (directory_id = 1::numeric))\r\n         Buffers: shared hit=4\r\n Planning time: 0.113 ms\r\n Execution time: 0.114 ms\r\n{code}",

Issue Summary\r\n\r\nUser is not able to add new fields to the tab because Jira returns this error:\r\n !image-2020-04-15-15-59-02-982.png|thumbnail! \r\n and in the log file, you can find *IndexOutOfBoundsException*. Full stack trace can be found in _Actual Results_ section.\r\n\r\nThis is because Jira uses the sequence number of a tab as an index in the ArrayList data structure. Furthermore, all actions on the *fieldscreentab* database table are not performed in a transaction or using a lock - the last operation always wins.\r\n\r\nAs a result, concurrent modifications of the tabs can corrupt their sequences number due to a race condition. If one of the operations is a delete operation, one of the tabs can stay with the old sequence number causing IndexOutOfBoundsException.\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nThe easiest way to reproduce the problem is by using a debugger with breakpoints.\r\n\r\nThis is one of the possible reproduction scenarios.\u00a0Those steps imitate two users who are performing DELTE and UPDATE operation at the same time.\u00a0\r\n 1. Set up the breakpoints in those three places:\r\n{code:java}\r\ncom.atlassian.jira.issue.fields.screen.DefaultFieldScreenStore#getFieldScreenTabs\r\ncom.atlassian.jira.issue.fields.screen.DefaultFieldScreenStore#updateFieldScreenTab\r\ncom.atlassian.jira.issue.fields.screen.DefaultFieldScreenStore#removeFieldScreenTab {code}\r\n2. Create 3 tabs\r\n !image-2020-04-15-16-22-58-239.png|thumbnail! \r\n Your database sequence numbers should look like that:\r\n !image-2020-04-15-16-30-13-200.png|thumbnail! \r\n 3. In two different threads perform two different operations:\r\n * remove *Tab0*\u00a0and skip all actions in debugger until you will land in the *removeFieldScreenTab*() method\r\n * then swap *Tab1* with\u00a0*Tab2* and skip all actions in debugger until you will land in the\r\n * *updateFieldScreenTab*() method\r\n !image-2020-04-15-16-23-17-018.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\n4. Perform all operations in the thread which removed the *Tab0*\r\n 5. Perform all operations in the thread which swapped the tabs *Tab1* and *Tab2*\r\n\r\nYour database sequences should look like this\r\n !image-2020-04-15-16-23-41-423.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nThe actions completed without any errors\r\n !image-2020-04-15-16-24-37-903.png|thumbnail!\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nAn error message \"The Jira server was contacted but has returned an error response.
