As one of JIRA strengths is it's ability to be integrated with other systems and or extended, the current backup scheme is troublesome when one wants to say, add new features to a 'production' JIRA as part of a development process.  \r\n\r\nFor example, a new release of a JIRA-based system involves the addition of a few custom fields.  Currently there's no automated way to develop/test those changes in a development copy then only apply the tested config changes to the production instance.  At the very least the ability to backup/restore config changes separately from issues would be a nice start.  Selectively adding these changes manually is tedious at best.",

Using the 'Assign to' link\r\n2. Setting the assignee while editing an issue, using 'Edit'\r\n3. Setting the assignee during a transition\r\n\r\nBecause the current assignee was not a recipient of 'Issue Updated' and 'Work Started on Issue' events, no email notifications were sent. \r\n\r\nI am requesting that all relevant events be triggered each time the event occurs. For example if an assignee and fix version is set while editing an issue, this should trigger both Issue Updated & Issue Assigned. If an assignee & fix version is set while transitioning to In Progress, this should trigger 'Work Started on Issue', 'Issue Updated', and 'Issue Assigned'.\r\n\r\nAll relevant events should be triggered, and the recipient should receive a single notification. In our particular application, we want the current assignee to receive a notification each time they are assigned, but only the watchers to receive notification when an issue is updated. Sending the current assignee emails every time an issue is updated by anybody (they are able to disable notifications for their own changes) is far too many notifications for our needs. Unfortunately, including Current assignee to the Issue Updated list is the only way to get them to receive AT LEAST the assignee emails. ",

However if you have version names defined such as \"1.2 - new ad campaign\" it will summarize the version number to:\r\n\r\n\"1...\"  which is completely useless. As a result we have to edit all our version names to \"1.2\" and put \"new ad campaign\" only in the description - then the calendar will show \"1.2\" and be useful.\r\n\r\nHowever then when we create/edit issues the affects/fix-for version fields we only get numbers i.e.:\r\n\r\n1.3\r\n1.2\r\n1.1\r\n1.0\r\n\r\nWhich makes it difficult for people to know which is which, as previously it would show the full name:\r\n\r\n1.3\r\n1.2 - new ad campaign\r\n1.1\r\n1.0\r\n\r\nNot sure about the best solution - perhaps get version select boxes to show the version description alongside? Maybe in a separate Javascript / Ajax \"panel\" as a compromise?\r\n\r\nThis affects the usefulness of the calendars massively for us as the managers don't want to lose version descriptions as people just raise things against the wrong versions with no text there.",

Your input in the comments helps us understand how this affects you and what you're hoping to accomplish with JIRA.\r\n\r\nAt this time, this suggestion is not on the JIRA development roadmap; however, there are a number of third-party plugins mentioned in [this post from Atlassian Answers|https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/47652/jql-jira-filter-on-worklog] that can accomplish this.\r\n\r\nPlease remember that jira.atlassian.com is one of many inputs for the JIRA roadmap. You can [learn more about our process here|https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/110373/how-does-the-jira-team-use-jira-atlassian-com].\r\n\r\nI understand that our decision may be disappointing. Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nDave Meyer\r\n[dmeyer@atlassian.com|mailto:dmeyer@atlassian.com]\r\nProduct Manager, JIRA Platform\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\nI am looking for a way to search for all tasks that a specific user has been involved with.  \r\n\r\nFor example:\r\nTom creates a jira task and assigns it to Sally.\r\nSally logs work against the task and runs into a road block that only Jim can solve.\r\nSally assigns the task to Jim.\r\nJim logs work on the task and assigns it back to Sally.\r\nSally logs work and resolves the task.\r\nTom reviews and closes the task.\r\n\r\nThe task now shows Tom as the reporter and the Assignee.  There is no way to know that Sally and Jim worked on the task.  \r\n\r\nIt would be nice to have a search option to find out that  Sally (or Jim) contributed to the task.\r\n\r\nThis relates somewhat to JRA-6137",

As opposed to the VARCHAR2 type, the NVARCHAR2 column type length is actually the number of chars - it was created for multibyte char sets.\r\nOtherwise it's a bit hard to predict how many chars (when typing UTF-8 chars outside the ascii range) you can actually type in a field without the Oracle DB throwing an SQLException because the column length constraint was violated.\r\n{quote}",

I'm told that you need to redo the workflow change until all issues are converted (but if this takes 16 h everytime then it's not worth the trouble). So for everybodies sake I had to restore a backup to get everything going again.\r\n\r\nIt seems the workflow activation needs a workover to improve its speed and to ensure that nothing can interfere while it's running. \r\nIt seems there's a missing indirection because every issue has to be changed when the workflow changes.\r\nThe workflow only consists of a little amount of steps. If you put something between the issue and the workflow then you should be able to change it in a few seconds and see problems when there are missing steps that can't convert. Normally you add stuff to a workflow so there shouldn't be a need to change the issue because all the steps that where in the previous workflow are also in the new workflow\r\n\r\nAlso there is nothing in the log or on the screen that gives you an indication what's going on or wrong or if it succeeded, ...\r\n\r\nDocumentation for the prof. edition only states how to activate a workflow (It wasn't hard to adjust but is this really all, no warnings that it takes allmost a day, that other processes will interfer)",
