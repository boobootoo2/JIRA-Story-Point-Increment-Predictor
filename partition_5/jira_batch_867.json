It is hilarous to me how difficult it is for a user to find where the description of each project is displayed. It would be perfect if it came up when hovering over the project name anywhere in the GUI, but especially in the Projects gadget.\r\n\r\nI understand that using tips this way may provide a challenge for screen readers and other accessibility mechanisms. If this is the case, you could make it a per-user preference to select whether tips were used simply for help or much more usefully for contextual information.\r\n\r\nThis is related to a similar suggestion I made in JRA-21299.",

Rather than display the entire comment, a busy site would display only the first 2-5 lines of the comment.

We don't plan to work on this for the foreseeable future. This suggestion will be reviewed in about 12 months time, at which point we\u2019ll consider whether we need to alter its status.\r\n\r\nWe understand this decision will be disappointing to everyone who voted for this issue. While we believe this suggestion would improve the product, after careful review of the most pressing needs of our customers, we've decided to prioritize other areas of the Jira Server roadmap, including:\r\n\r\nPerformance and stability improvements\r\n Archiving projects for improved performance\r\n Optimising the use of custom fields\r\n Improving performance of boards\r\n Improving Jira notifications\r\n Allowing users to edit shared filters and dashboards\r\n Mobile app for Jira Server\r\n We hope that you appreciate our candid and transparent communication. You can learn more about our approach to highly voted server suggestions here.\r\n\r\nTo learn more on how your suggestions are reviewed, see our updated workflow for server feature suggestions.\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\n Jakub Kurcek\r\n Jira Server Product Management\r\n{panel}\r\nThis also includes renaming 'Priority' to 'Severity' as some customers prefer to use severity.",

It results in a call to UserUtilImpl.getGroup with a null group (which I guess, but am not sure is supposed to represent the Anyone group). This in turn may throw an exception, depending on what is backing it.\r\n\r\nLuckily it is unusual for people to grant admin access to Anyone, so this is unlikely to affect too many customers.\r\n\r\nThe workaround is to replace the Anyone group where it is used in the permissions scheme with a group containing all users.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAn example stack trace that occurs in this

I would like to see this as default context element there, too.\r\n\r\n*Use Case:*\r\n\r\nWe needed this as workaround for JRA-2364 -- _Hide Time Tracking estimates from certain users (e.g. customers)_ as we had to prevent that customers can add gadgets with time tracking information. Our solution was to set maxGadgets to \"0\" for them and only allow them to use preconfigured dashboards:\r\n\r\n{code}\r\n#if (!$authcontext.user.inGroup('${showtimetracking.groupname}'))\r\n  #set($maxGadgets = 0)\r\n#end\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nWhere {{showtimetracking.groupname}} is set on compilation through resource filtering.\r\n\r\n*Workaround:*\r\n\r\nAs described in [Confluence|http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Customising+interface+based+on+user%27s+role?focusedCommentId=217743856#comment-217743856]:\r\n\r\n* Add a dependency to the dashboard-plugin-POM:\r\n{code:xml}\r\n<dependency>\r\n  <groupId>com.atlassian.jira</groupId>\r\n  <artifactId>atlassian-jira</artifactId>\r\n  <version>4.X.X</version>\r\n  <scope>provided</scope>\r\n</dependency>\r\n{code}\r\n* Change {{DashboardView.java}} to provide the authcontext:\r\n{code:java}\r\ncontext.put(\"authcontext\", ComponentManager.getInstance().getJiraAuthenticationContext());\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nThis does the job... but for some reason the UnitTests won't run anymore.

As Chris pointed out, it isn't even clear what kind of instance you would have that would require that much heap and whether JIRA works at all with instances that large.\r\n\r\nIt seems like a better solution would to add a SystemEnvironmentCheck that looks for this scenario and gives the user a warning and a link to a knowledge base article explaining the situation.",

On the issue detail screen, you shouldn't have to click ellipses to see the whole values - this should be the screen to see it all. I saw this specifically with the components and cc fields; I'm not sure where else it collapses in that way, and an extra click is required to see the information.\r\n\r\n2. When on a subtask's issue detail screen, the way the parent ticket name, parent key, and the subtask's issue key is displayed, they are hard to read, because of the size, spacing and punctuation. It ends up not being easy to tell what those different bits mean the way it's laid out right now.\r\n\r\n3.

      "description": "I'm developing JIRA gadget and I need to send POST request to some REST resource. I doing it like that\r\n{code:javascript}\r\n        var config = AJS.$(\"#config-input\").val();\r\n        AJS.$.ajax({\r\n            url: \"/rest/testing/1.0/config/set\",\r\n            type: \"POST\",\r\n            data: { \r\n                config: config\r\n            },\r\n            success: function(data, st) {\r\n                dialog.hide();\r\n                gadget.showView(true);\r\n            },\r\n            error: function(data, st) {\r\n                alert('Failed');\r\n            }\r\n        });\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nAs I understood from documentation in webapp/includes/js/ajs-gadgets/utilI/util.js I do it in correct way. But instead of sending POST request with param 'config'  which has value from textarea it sends POST request with body '[object Object]'. I dug into problem and found in webapp/includes/js/ajs-gadgets/utilI/util.js next piece of code:\r\n\r\n{code:javascript}\r\n            if (options.data) {\r\n                if (options.type.toLowerCase() === \"get\") {\r\n                    if (typeof options.data === \"string\") {\r\n                        reqOptions.url += (\"?\" + options.data.replace(/^\\?/,\"\"));\r\n                    } else {\r\n                        reqOptions.url += (\"?\" + gadgets.io.encodeValues(options.data).replace(/^\\?/,\"\"));\r\n                    }\r\n                } else {\r\n                    reqOptions[gadgets.io.RequestParameters.POST_DATA] = options.data;\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nNext I googled for example of 'gadgets.io.makeRequest' use and found that JSON object passed as 'data' should be passed through gadgets.io.encodeValues() function for POST request too. So I changed my send request code to this:\r\n{code:javascript}\r\n        AJS.$.ajax({\r\n            url: \"/rest/testing/1.0/config/set\",\r\n            type: \"POST\",\r\n            data: gadgets.io.encodeValues({ \r\n                config: config\r\n            }),\r\n            success: function(data, st) {\r\n                dialog.hide();\r\n                gadget.showView(true);\r\n            },\r\n            error: function(data, st) {\r\n                alert('Failed');\r\n            }\r\n        });\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nand got my coed worked.\r\n\r\nIs that bug or is that expected way for passing POST data?",

The behavior they see is:\r\n\r\n# login.jsp works fine.\r\n# attempting to login via gadget results in the gadget giving a failure message. If you simply refresh the page, however, you *have* been logged in.\r\n\r\nThis appears to be a side effect of the changes to add CAPTCHA in 4.1 and the resulting changes to the login gadget. I don't know *why* Crowd/Seraph are behaving like this but what happens is that:\r\n\r\n# a user gets put into the session\r\n# the authstatuskey is success\r\n# the lastLoginResult is null\r\n\r\nIn 4.0 we just checked if there was a user in the session to declare \"login succeeded\". Now we look at lastLoginResult, which is null for reasons yet unknown.\r\n\r\nWORKAROUND :   To any customers affected by this bug, the work around is to use the Login link in the top right corner of the page.  This is a link to login.jsp and this is know to work as expected.",
