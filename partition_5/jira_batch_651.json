Summary\r\n\r\nIf a transition (using generic event) is not configured to send email, however, a user adds a comment on the transition screen (IssueCommented event configured to send email), then the IssueCommented event does not send an email as well. JIRA doesn't generate IssueCommented event, so the user does not receive an email for this comment.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Configure a workflow transition with post function to fire Generic event.\r\n # Make sure to edit notification scheme so that Generic event does not send email\r\n # Make sure to edit notification scheme so that IssueCommented event sends email\r\n # Create an issue\r\n # Transition the issue and add a comment on the transition screen\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nUse should receive an email for the IssueCommented event\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nNo email is received for this comment.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing written in the\u00a0atlassian-jira-outgoing-mail.log\r\nh3. Notes\r\n\r\nAs a user, a comment added during a transition or on the view issues screen directly, is the same. They appear the same way on the issue. So, they should be treated the same way too.\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\n- Use a 3rd party add-on such as Automation for JIRA or JIRA Enterprise Mail Handler.\r\n- For JIRA Service Desk, built in Automation can be used",

In that case the roadmap should have counted remaining activity as four not five more over task and sub task are not issues as per the JIRA definition of issue\r\n\r\nSo proposal is roadmap should not say remaining issues instead it should say remaining activity and it should not count count the task whenever there are subtask is attached to it\r\n{quote}",

Summary\r\n\r\nCurrently, the issue collector delivers a fragment of HTML/JS to embed in the client website that interacts with JIRA via a URL that encodes state in it. \r\n\r\nFollowing on, the client browser will cache the content and a (potentially) outdated resource will be used by the client browser when JIRA or its plugins are upgraded. \r\n\r\nThis is worsened by the fact that products such as Confluence, Portfolio and Stash are hardcoding these URLs (currently pointing to JAC) in the actual source of these products and are basically using these URLs as \"API\" :(\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce.\r\n\r\n1. Create an issue collector in JIRA.\r\n2. Get the html fragment for the issue collector and embed it into a html page.\r\n3. Visit the the html page and use the collector so that the browser caches the content.\r\n4. Make a change to JIRA source such that the content delivered for the URL included in the html fragment provided by the collector is different.\r\n5. Restart JIRA.\r\n6. Visit the external html page and try to use the collector again.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n* The content retrieved from the URL by the embedded collector is out of date and does not reflect the changes done in step 4.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n* The content retrieved from the URL by the embedded collector is up to date and reflects the changes done in step 4.\r\n\r\nh3.

Summary\r\nWhen you disabled keyboard shortcuts in your user profile and perform certain actions, then keyboard shortcuts would work although disabled. Most keyboard shortcuts are relatively harmless because they prompt before doing anything. However, some just go off and do stuff without prompting, eg. 'i' for Assign to Me. This makes them dangerous.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Disable keyboard shortcuts in your profile.\r\n# Open a ticket or hard-refresh the browser page if it's already open.\r\n# Type a keyboard shortcut and verify it doesn't work (eg. 'c' for the Create Ticket window or '?' for help).\r\n# Do an action that creates a modal popup dialog, eg:\r\n#* Click on the \"Create\" in the Jira header, then click Cancel. (Reproducible only in JIRA 7.2.0)\r\n#* click on the thumbnail of the attached image. Once the image is displayed, click on the X in the top right corner to dismiss it. (Reproducible in both JIRA 7.2.0 and JIRA 6.3.15)\r\n# Type a keyboard shortcut, eg. 'c' or '?'. The keyboard shortcut will work and the window will pop up.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nThe Keyboard shortcuts do not work as the Keyboard Shortcut is disabled in the User profile.  \r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nThe Keyboard shortcuts do work. \r\n \r\nh3.

Summary\r\nCurrently, it is not possible for a user to keep a field from being visible until a certain part of the workflow if that field has a default value. Some users might want a field to appear later in the workflow of an issue but might want it to have a default value when appearing on a custom screen for users. For that field to be visible however, it has to be included in the 'View Issue' operation.

Summary\r\n\r\nIn short when user attempt to add the confluence URL to the Manage Gadgets > Subscription page , they run into this error :\r\n{code:java}\r\nCaused by: javax.net.ssl.SSLException: hostname in certificate didn't match: <localhost> != <atlassian>\r\n\r\n{code}\r\nGadgets feature is not aware about the apache http server\u2019s certificate that actually should be verified in the first place.\r\nh3. Environment\r\n * JIRA 6.4.5\r\n * Confluence 5.8.x\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Generate keystore as per the following command:\r\n{code:java}\r\nkeytool -genkey -alias jira -keyalg RSA -keystore <JIRA_HOME>/tomcat.jks -dname \"CN=Atlassian, OU=Unknown, O=Unknown, L=Unknown, ST=Unknown, C=Unknown\" -ext SAN=ip:x.x.x.x\r\n\r\n{code}\r\n\r\n # Configure JIRA and Confluence over SSL (self-signed certificate) using the keystore above.\r\n # Create an applinks.\r\n # Add *Confluence Base URL* via {{JIRA dashboard > Add Gadget > Manage Gadgets > Subscription}}\r\n # Hit into other errors below because JIRA and Confluence server IP is not matching the certificate SNI address:\r\n{code:java}\r\nCaused by: javax.net.ssl.SSLException: hostname in certificate didn't match: <localhost> != <atlassian>\r\n\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nh3.

Problem is that application A might not have any UI and it's purely consumer. In this case _Application Link_ page always alerts that Generic Link is down and _Outgoing Authentication_ doesn't make sense.\r\n\r\nh3.

Our workflow is such that after a feature is completed on our side, it goes for customer acceptance and testing -- areas over which we have no control.  The release burndown assumes a status of \"resolved/done\" to show any data and while that works in many cases, it would be nice to specify per burndown which status is \"done\" for your team.  This gives everyone the chance to use this functionality as features flow from team to team.\r\n\r\nI ran into this issue as well when fixing production defects that were reported by the customer.  The customer is the one who could say they were \"done\" that would take them months sometimes.  However, development and QA were done with them almost right away and to track SLAs we needed to associate \"resolved\" with different statuses which was not possible with JIRA.\r\n\r\nNot sure if we are not using the software correctly or there is a better way but frequently features and defects originate outside the development team, are fixed/developed by DEV, and are finally closed by the reporters.  I think this is a pretty common practice in Professional Service Development Teams and having the ability to report a status as resolved that we specify would make JIRA more powerful for all.",

For some combination of large values, the insert/update operation will fail.\r\n{code}\r\nThe problem is that the nvarchar type will take two times the actual length of data entered + 2 bytes (see [MS KB|https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms186939.aspx]) which will take 255*2+2=512 bytes for each column and if the index contains more than one nvarchar column then warning message is thrown.\r\n\r\nh2. Suggested Solution\r\nIn reality it's relatively rare to reach the limit in order for the index to fail. However it would be nice if we can limit the column length at first place.\r\n",
