Therefore it's essential that our users be able to quickly and accurately enter it into fields of other tools. When the wrong value is used it causes painful and expensive problems. Unfortunately, users currently must either retype the ID manually or copy/paste it from within the URL in the browser address bar. Both of these are slow and error-prone. A Copy-ID-to-Clipboard button, which takes only a few lines of Javascript, would prevent a large number of errors which are expensive to fix. It would make JIRA work more productively within our organisation.\r\n\r\nCurrently there's no place on the screen with the issue number, where you can select and copy. Alternatively a quick link or a copy to Clipboard button would solve this problem and would presumably be helpful for many other JIRA customers too.\r\n\r\nSomething like this:\r\nPROJ-111",

We determined the root cause after investigating our recent changes.\r\n\r\nDuring post mortem we identified that the Jira Align activity logs are able to be filtered, but it does not have any filter subscription like Jira where we can set a schedule to receive the filter results that are looking for specific failures within the Activity Logs.\r\n\r\nAs a workaround, we have to manually periodically visit the filtered activity logs and monitor it to ensure we avoid any discrepancies or failures. We took this to our TAM and he recommended to submit this suggestion.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nLuis Tellado",

Issue Summary\r\n\r\n{{DefaultServerIndexRepairService}} periodically queries the version tables to get all the issues updated in the past 25s. On Oracle DB this \"25s\" argument is passed as {{TIMESTAMP}} datatype, while {{update_time}} column has datatype {{{}DATE{}}}. This mismatch causes the DB to perform a full table scan. This causes unnecessary DB load.\r\n\r\nThe same issue applies to the three versioning tables: {{{}ISSUE_VERSION{}}}, {{COMMENT_VERSION}} and {{{}WORKLOG_VERSION{}}}.\r\n\r\nThe query run is\r\n{code:sql}\r\nselect \r\n    ISSUE_VERSION.issue_id, \r\n    ISSUE_VERSION.parent_issue_id,\r\n    ISSUE_VERSION.update_time,\r\n    ISSUE_VERSION.index_version,\r\n    ISSUE_VERSION.deleted\r\nfrom issue_version ISSUE_VERSION\r\nwhere ISSUE_VERSION.update_time > current_timestamp + interval '-25' second\r\n{code}\r\nThe\u00a0corresponding Java code is {{{}com.atlassian.jira.versioning.VersioningDao#findVersionsUpdatedInTheLast{}}}:\r\n{code:java}\r\n                        .where(updateTimePath.after(\r\n                                SQLExpressions.addSeconds(\r\n                                        DateTimeExpression.currentTimestamp(Timestamp.class),\r\n                                        (int) -duration.getSeconds()))){code}\r\nPotentially (not tested!) changing this to\r\n{code:java}\r\nDateTimeExpression.currentDate(Timestamp.class){code}\r\nwould solve the problem, but the impact on DBs from other vendors would need to be checked.\r\n\r\nThis was reproduced on Oracle DB. At this moment we don't know if other DB types are affected by this issue.\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Run Jira Server on Oracle DB.\r\n # {{DefaultServerIndexRepairService}} will query the DB inefficiently\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\n{{iv_update_time}} / {{cv_update_time}} / {{wv_update_time}} indexes are used.\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nFull table scan is performed.\r\nh3. Impact\r\n\r\nThe query is inefficient, but does not impact Jira nor the DB significantly.\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nThis issue affects Jira Server and [Jira single-node DC|https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiraserver/running-jira-data-center-on-a-single-node-993929595.html] only. In order to avoid this issue, migrate to Jira DC cluster following [this guide|https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiraserver/set-up-a-jira-data-center-cluster-993929600.html]. Mind you, you do _not_ need to set up a second node. It's enough to set up the shared home and {{cluster.properties}} file.\r\n\r\n\u00a0",
