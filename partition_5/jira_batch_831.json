Now that Atlassian is including some of the Spring libraries in the core build, in theory we should have just been able to leverage these instead of including our own -- but the mismatch of the AOP library is making our code break and we don't want to override a bundled library version that came with the product and break something else.\r\n\r\nWhat gives, is this intentional or accidental?  Can you guys make these versions consistent so if someone needs to pull in another Spring jar file we can logically know which version we should include?",

We also appreciate the higher security of keeping critical configuration files under a separate entity from the application's userid.\r\nUnfortunately when running the installer as root the installation directory is owned by root (except for a few directories owned by jira). This means that the JIRA administrator would be required to have root access to preform tasks such as installing a JIRA System I plugin.\r\n\r\nI would suggest providing the ability to create a second jira account such as jiraadmin that would own the contents of the installation directory (which are not owned by jira) rather than using root.",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-25653].\n  {panel}\n\nFrom a project management perspective the way our team works is that we estimate at the Story level and then have the developers creates sub-tasks and log their work at the sub-task level.  The issue we have is that the time logged against the sub-task does not reduce the remaining estimate we did at the Story level.  This allows us to do a top-down style of estimation. If there could be an option to allow you to select where you want your time rolled up to, or have a preference on how time tracking works, it would be appreciated.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n* Story is estimated at 16 hours\r\n* Several sub-tasks are created with no estimations\r\n* 4 hours worth of work is done against a sub-task\r\n* Remaining time left on Story to be 12 hours",

Examples\r\n # find all issues that are duplicates of issue JRA-25640 (one direction, issue specified)\r\n # find all issues that are blocking issue JRA-25640 or that JRA-25640 blocks (bidirectional, issue specified)\r\n # find all issues that are duplicates of any issue, or which duplicate any issue (bidirectional, no issue specified)\r\n # find all issues that are blocked (one direction, no issue specified)\r\n # find all issues that are linked to a specific issue and display those based on a specific depth (linked issues displaying linked relationship two, three, etc., issues deep)\r\n\r\nh4. Implementation Notes\r\n * The JQL function that exists must continue to work exactly as it does. If it is possible to overload the JQL function based on arity and this makes a consistent API, then this would be preferred. Otherwise, there may need to be a new function name which provides vararg behaviour as described above.\r\n * The link index entries added in 4.4 (I think) provide enough to build performant lucene queries for the above use cases.

Application components get a UserTransaction object through a JNDI lookup using the name java:comp/UserTransaction or by requesting injection of a UserTransaction object.\"\r\n\r\nUsing the non-spec compliant binding of java:comp/env/UserTransaction probably works on Tomcat, but is not guaranteed to work on any other container. At this point let me declare my interest here as one of the core Jetty developers. That notwithstanding, surely it is in Atlassian's interests to be as container agnostic as possible? Especially on such a trivial issue.\r\n\r\nMoreover, as JIRA is a well-known application no doubt many users would assume it uses industry best-practice and would copy this unfortunately incorrect and non-spec compliant configuration.\r\n\r\nI again urge the JIRA developers to stick with spec compliance and simply fix the JNDI name configured in entityengine.xml.\r\n",

Although the causes are not known yet, it apparently points to a class/even type that doesn't exists in Greenhopper. Thus this exception is thrown.\r\n\r\nh2.Workaround\r\n\r\nDisable the *JIRA Toolkit plugin 0.18* via Universal Plugin Manager and restart your instance. The error no longer appears so.\r\n\r\n{panel:borderStyle=solid| borderColor=#ccc| titleBGColor=#F7D6C1| bgColor=#FFFFCE}*In some specific cases*, this error was also triggered by an issue between JIRA installed and the bundled version that 4.4 ships. Once Greenhopper implements a specific custom field type \"Greenhopper Ranking\", JIRA searches for the events related with this one but do it inside the bundled plugin (even disabled). That case, do the following:\r\n\r\n# Backup your data.\r\n# Go to _Administration > Plugins > Manage Existing > Greenhopper > Uninstall_ and remove the user-installed version of Greenhopper.\r\n# Restart your JIRA instance.\r\n# Go to _Administration > Plugins > Show System Plugins > Greenhopper > Enable_ enabling the system embedded version.\r\n# Go to _Administration > Plugins > Upgrade_ and proceed upgrading Greenhopper.\r\n# Go to {{<JIRA_INSTALL>/atlassian-jira/WEB-INF/classes}}, do a security copy of the file *atlassian-bundled-plugins.zip* (all bundled plugins are extracted from there), open this file and delete the jar *jira-greenhopper-plugin-5.7-disabled.jar*.\r\n# Restart your instance.\r\n# Try to add a comment on the issue and see if the issue has gone.\r\n\r\nThis procedure is supposed to avoid JIRA from using the *jar* file of the bundled version of Grenhopper.\r\n\r\nOR\r\n\r\n# Go to GreenHopper General Config and turn off the GreenHopper night service\r\n# Restart JIRA\r\n{panel} ",
