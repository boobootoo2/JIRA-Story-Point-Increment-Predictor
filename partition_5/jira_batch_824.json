E.g. a sub-task with a different value in \"Affected Version/s\" than its parent makes no sense IMHO. Same goes for \"Fix Version/s\" if you use this field for both, the version when it got fixed and the version when it should get fixed (as long as it isn't resolved). By default it should also have the same Assignee as its parent, the same priority, and the same labels.\r\n\r\nSure, this is not always desirable for all fields to have equal values than the parent but then you can still customize any field in any way you like. I think it covers the >90% case and saves you a lot of typing work when creating sub-tasks. Having to enter everything for each sub-task, even though it's only a single field you want to be different per sub-task (other than the Summary, of course) is just a lot of unnecessary work, methinks.",

Stability and security are the problems that prevent you from allowing to install JIRA plugins into OnDemand.\r\n\r\nHowever, I also pretty well understand that it's possible to isolate environments in which different OnDemand instances run to make sure one client will not ruin the other client's systems. Virtualisation fully solves that. So it's possible to solve inter-environment stability and security issues.\r\n\r\nStability & security issues at user's own instance are just a matter of sending a clear message to OnDemand customers, saying - \"we carry no responsibility for thirdparty plugins problems\". As long as you allow to install plugins onto the downloaded solution - you are allowing users to ruin themselves in their own selfhosted instances. I don't see then why not allow same thing for Atlassian hosted environment, as long as this will not affect other customers. It will bring major benefit of plugins exchange to OnDemand users. \r\n\r\nThanks\r\nAlex\r\n\r\nPS: I've found no paticular project for OnDemand system, so posting to main JIRA project. Please lead me to OnDemand dedicated space, as I have more to post for it.",

Summary\r\n\r\nWe have our Jira instance setup to synchronize with Active Directory such that any users that are added to a particular AD group are supposed to automatically become Jira users. When we initially configured the user directory, the synchronization worked perfectly and all users were able to login to Jira. However, when a new user joined the AD group, it is not automatically created in JIRA.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nThe following LDAP User Filter is used on the User Directory:\r\n\r\n{noformat}\r\n\"ldap.user.filter\": \"(&(objectCategory=Person)(memberOf=CN=newgrp,CN=Users,DC=company,DC=local))\"\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nAll the users that are members of the _newgrp_ after the synchronization are automatically added to the _jira-users_ group.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nFor the first time the directory is synchronized, everything works fine. However, if a user is added to the _newgrp_ directory after the first synchronization, it is not automatically added to Jira, instead we can see this message in the atlassian-jira.log:\r\n\r\n{noformat}\r\n2011-12-06 10:05:41,016 QuartzWorker-1 WARN ServiceRunner     [atlassian.crowd.directory.DbCachingRemoteChangeOperations] Could not add the following missing users to group [ newgrp ]: [johndoe]\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nThe workaround for this situation is to go into your Advanced Settings in your user Directory and uncheck \"Enable Incremental Synchronization\" as per [Connecting to an LDAP Directory|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Connecting+to+an+LDAP+Directory#ConnectingtoanLDAPDirectory-AdvancedSettings].",

On the Issue Navigator, through Tools > Configure Columns I added the \"Story Points\" column. It appears in the \"Re-order columns\" view and I can see populated values.\r\n\r\nWhen I click back to \"Issue Navigator\", the column is missing. But, if I filter on *all* issue types (i.e. ensure every issue type in the list is selected) - the story points column magically appears. If I search with just \"Any\" issue type selected however, the Story Points column vanishes again. As far as I can tell, the column is visible whenever I choose any issue type other than \"Any\" - so just choosing 'standard issue types' also makes the column visible.\r\n\r\nIn JQL:\r\nworks - I can see \"Story Points\" column with any of these examples:\r\n{code}\r\nissuetype in standardIssueTypes()\r\nissuetype in (\"New Feature\", epic)\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nA blank JQL query however (equivalent to \"Any\" issue type) does not work - I cannot see \"Story Points\" column.\r\n\r\nIt also seems to hide the column if my filter does not select any issue types (such as epic or story) that have stories. So for example, if I filter on \"New Feature\" or \"Bug\", it does not show the story points column. That seems reasonable. It _does_ show the column if my filter includes both \"New Feature\" and Epic (see second JQL above), i.e. one issue type that has story points and one that does not - which is also good. However if I choose \"Any\" issue type, that should include any Epics and Stories and show the associated story points. (it should certainly give the same results as when I individually select all of the possible issue types).\r\n\r\nAdditionally, this also affects the 'Export'>>'Excel (All fields)'.  The 'Story Points' field will not be exported if it is not displayed in the issue navigator.  If you adjust the JQL to {code}\"Story Points\" is not EMPTY{code} the export functionality will function as expected. \r\n\r\n\r\n",

If someone has a question after some years, e.g. if a particular bug already showed up during development, he/she can search for that in the stored project documentation and doesn't has to look for it in a lot of different places. Now JIRA bugs are still difficult to archive if you don't want to depend on a JIRA installation in future.\r\n\r\nTherefore it would be nice to have the possibility to export a whole JIRA project with all issues, comments and attachments. Exporting format should be HTML, so that it could be viewed offline and the content keeps easily accessible, especially attachments. \r\n\r\nThe Word export that already can be used to export a lot of issue data only shows the names of the attachments.

Then I found out that my JIRA project is not linked to CVS module so I didn't see anything in 'Version Control' tab. After that I linked my project to proper CVS module and restarted JIRA, waited for the updating of all CVS log files and checked 'Version Control' tab. It showed me all my committed files. I was very happy! But today I've checked this tab for that JIRA issue and haven't seen anything in it only message with text \"No commits have yet been performed on this issue.\". There were no any additional restarts of JIRA, CVS module changes, errors in JIRA logs between two moments when I committed file into CVS and when I checked 'Version Control' tab and didn't find anything there.\r\n\r\nI'm attaching two screenshots:\r\n 1) First screenshot with content of CVS log file and JIRA issue key\r\n 2) Second screenshot with JIRA issue's empty 'Version Control' tab",

If I try to embed links using other protocols, such as _smb_, _file_, or _doors_, JIRA markup fails to recognize them as legal links.\r\n\r\nThe workaround is to use HTML directly, but that defeats the purpose of the markup language, and the workaround doesn't seem to be universally supported on all JIRA versions.  \r\nNOTE: The workaround works fine on our installation of JIRA 4.3.2, but it doesn't seem to work on this version of JIRA.  At least, the preview function isn't displaying it correctly.\r\n\r\nExample:  The following link will not be recognized by the JIRA markup language:\r\n{color:red}[Design Documentation on the MAC server|smb://DocumentationServer.internal/Public/MyMACProject]{color}\r\n\r\nWorkaround: Bypass the markup language and use native HTML:\r\n{color:blue}{HTML}<a href=smb://DocumentationServer.internal/Public/MyMACProject>Design Documentation on the MAC server</a>{HTML}{color}\r\n\r\nWhen I test the links above on this JIRA project, the HTML workaround doesn't seem to work on this version of JIRA.  On our internal network, the blue link above not only displays the URL properly, but users can navigate directly to the directory location that is captured in the URL (assuming that they are on a MAC, which natively supports the SMB protocol).\r\n\r\nFYI: The _doors_ protocol, that I use as one of the examples above, is an example of using URL link that depends on an installed application.  In this case, the application is DOORS, from TeleLogic/IBM.  As long as the user has DOORS installed, and I use this workaround as part of how I markup the JIRA task description, users are able to navigate from the JIRA task, directly to the requirement description in the DOORS application.",

(This is a real example.)\r\n1. Type *david* - too many matches\r\n2. Type *smith* - too many matches\r\n3. Type *dsmith* - no hit, his username is dpsmith3\r\n4. Type *david.smith*, attempting an email match - no hit, this sometimes works for us but here his  mail address has been disambiguated to david.p.smith@xxx.  \r\n\r\nThis can also happen where there are variations of names, eg, deb/debra, or alternate spellings.  Using a broader target gives too may hits to pick the user but a narrow search misses altogether.\r\n\r\nSuggested fixes:\r\n1. Use a *dot* for an AND search, so _david.smith_ requires a match on _david_ and _smith_ (y)  \r\n2. Allow scrolling/paging of the full hit list.\r\n3. All the above.\r\n\r\nOption 1 is the snappiest from a usability point of view but paging is probably easier to understand.  A hint \"Displaying 20 of 237 matching users.
