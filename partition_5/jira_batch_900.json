      "description": "I would like to have a custom field that can display not only the current value of the field, but also its previous values. This is vaguely similar to, but also somewhat different from the Change History. I have a specific problem to solve, but I also think there might be other uses from this functionality.\r\n\r\nThe specific thing I'm trying to do is in a workflow that has a review process. The review cycle may be executed an unknown number of time (usually more than once). Each time through the process, I want to capture the name of the person who is reviewing, an indication that they have signed off (or not), and the date & time. I initially thought I would just be able to create a custom field for each of these three bits of information, but then I realised that if the issue needed to be reviewed again, the next reviewer would \"over-write\" the previous reviewer's field values. \r\n\r\nAlthough the changes would be logged in the issue's Change History, it might not be easy to find them. What I really want to see is all the previous values of JUST these three field, all in one place. Effectively, this would be a table with each row showing the reviewer, their sign-off (or not), and the date.\r\n\r\nFirstly, is there an existing way of doing this? I'm relatively new to JIRA, and I'm still learning how to configure it.\r\nIf not, is there a third party extension or p[lug-in? I've searched and haven't found anything, but I'm not sure what to call this type of functionality: audit history? field versioning? \r\n\r\nWhere could this sort of functionality be used? Anywhere where more than one user has in input.\r\nReviews, approvals, and sign-offs - all the sorts of activities where you're expecting parallel inputs\r\nVoting  - eg. you want to record a score from 1 to 5 from multiple users.\r\nBudgeting - eg. various team leaders can enter the anticipated costs from their own team.\r\n\r\nthanks,\r\nP",

There is a screen shot somewhere showing how to add a service but if a user wants to change the interval at which mail is sent from JIRA, they need to know to go to Admin, Services, Mail Queue Service, Edit. Not a big deal, just something missing. The closest I found was the reference on http://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/docs/v3.13/services.html to \"Editing Service Properties\". Perhaps just adding a sentence there such as: \r\n\r\n\"For example, to change the interval at which email is sent from JIRA, select the Mail Queue Service and change the interval from the default value of 1 minute\"\r\n\r\n{quote}\r\nMatt, if you could raise a ticket in jira.atlassian.com under the JIRA project with a component of 'Documentation' and describe your proposed changes, I'll have a look and make the necessary updates.\r\n\r\nKind Regards,\r\nAndrew\r\n{quote}",

This bug causes these special characters to be escaped in UTF-8 as well as CP1252. This is documented in CORE-100.\r\n\r\nThe customer impact of this is that customers cannot use JIRA with Crowd and Active Directory if they have group names that contain em-dash or en-dash. These look like hyphens, but aren't.\r\n\r\nConfluence and Crowd no longer use the WordCurlyQuotesFilter that causes this problem. I'd be very happy if JIRA could either a) also abandon it, or b) fix CORE-100.",

      "description": "I would like to add transitions to a workflow that let you do the following.  They all sound like different requests, but I believe they all have a common thread, so I'll link them together.\r\n\r\n1.  When resolving an issue as duplicate, you should be able to specify one or more issue numbers that this issue is duplicating.  It should create \"duplicates\" links to each of the issues.\r\n2.  It should be possible to create a transition that can create another issue based on the current issue, and link the two.  (Better explanation below.)\r\n3.  It should be possible to create a transition that will perform an action on a linked issue.  (Better explanation below.)\r\n\r\nImagine a scenario like this.  We have an external \"Bug Reports\" project, and an internal \"Development\" project.  When an issue is reported into the \"Bug Reports\" project, it will have a reporter and some people who are \"watchers\" on it.  At some point the issue may become a \"confirmed\" bug, and we want to move it to development.  But we don't really want to completely MOVE it, because we still want it to show up under the old number in the \"Bug Reports\" database.  Instead, we want a transition that does the following:\r\n\r\n1. Sets the status of the \"Bug Reports\" issue to \"In Development\"\r\n2. Creates a clone of an issue, into another project (\"Clone and Move\", which is a feature you don't really support.)\r\n3. Links the two issues using a link type of our choosing (\"is tracking\" / \"is tracked by\" or something like that).\r\n\r\nNow, this new issue in the \"Development\" project can have a completely independent status, version, and everything else, and watchers of the original issue aren't notified when it actually moves from \"Open\" to \"In Progress\", or if we schedule it for the next release, but then change our minds.\r\n\r\nWhen we then finish testing the \"Development\" issue, we'd like to create a transition like \"Release\" that will then modify the original linked \"Bug Reports\" issue, like changing the status to Fixed and adding a comment that says what version it was released in.\r\n\r\nThis concept of linked issues is important for many companies.  I applaud Atlassian for being so open as to use the same internal and external tracking systems, but I don't think most companies can get away with this.  Let me reiterate some of the problems.  For us in development, resolving an issue as fixed doesn't mean it is ready to deliver to a customer.  It then needs to be code reviewed, and then integrated to the main branch, and then tested by QA.  And we need documentation for it, and so on.  In many cases, we may fix an issue, but then decide we don't have time to test it adequately, or it is too risky for the next release, so we pull it and do it later.  If customers actually saw some of this process, they would blow a gasket.  \"You told me it would be fixed in the next release!\"  And by \"customers\", I don't even mean only external ones either, I will include our own sales and support personnel, who will pass the information on to customers even if it isn't in an outward facing system.\r\n\r\nI guess what I am trying to say is, you have this workflow system, and you have this concept of linking issues, but the two features are totally disconnected.  Being able to create a new linked JIRA issue, or modify linked issues, seems like a very fundamental thing a workflow should allow.",

      "description": "If I create a fairly complex custom workflow, many different steps along the way may have a similar transition.  For example, there may be several different points along the workflow where you can \"Close Issue\" or \"Reopen Issue\".\r\n\r\nIn the default JIRA workflow, there are two places where you can \"Reopen Issue\" and they magically share the ID 3.  If you copy this workflow, and then make a change to \"Reopen Issue\" (add a validation or something), it will appear in both places.  But if you make a new step, and give it a new transition \"Reopen Issue\", this is separate from the other ones (it will have a new ID).  Sometimes this is what you want, but usually it is not; if I impose a new restriction on \"Reopen Issue\" that says only a person in a certain role can do it, I want that to apply to everyone.\r\n\r\nI figured out how to do this by exporting the XML, hacking it, and reimporting it, but this defeats the purpose of a WYSIWYG editor.  We really need one or both of the following:\r\n\r\n1.  When creating a new transition, you should be able to choose if it is really new, or just shared with an existing one.\r\n2.  It needs to be easier to copy conditions, validators, and post functions from one transition to another.",

This scheme (and therefore also these issue types) are only used for one single project, by one single developer. However, when you click \"Create new issue\" in the top menu, the issue type list contains all these issue types for everybody. Also, when you create an issue with such a custom type on a project that doesn't have the issue type, you get no error message. Moreover, these issue types have a custom field configuration scheme, which is also ignored. In other words:\r\n\r\n1. If none of the projects you have access to use a given issue type, the issue type should not be in the list on the \"create new issue type\" page\r\n2. If some of the projects do use the issue type, but not all, trying to create an issue of that type in a project that doesn't have the type should raise an error message.\r\n\r\nThanks!",
