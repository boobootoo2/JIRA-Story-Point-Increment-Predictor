We are currently in the process of assigning ownership to these requests so they can be expedited. I have assigned an owner to this ticket who will triage it and provide an update. Please note that this is currently not on our short-term backlog.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nThe Service Desk Team\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. \r\n\r\nIssue Summary\r\n\r\nThe customers (both portal-only customers and the ones having Atlassian account) can see the issues in the [public Jira projects|https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiracloud/allowing-anonymous-access-to-your-project-779172888.html] when they are not logged in to JIRA Service Desk portal. Once they login to the JIRA Service Desk portal, however, they can't any longer view the issues in the public Jira projects. Keeps on getting redirected to the JIRA Service Desk portal.\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Create or use a [public Jira project|https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiracloud/allowing-anonymous-access-to-your-project-779172888.html].\r\n # View an existing issue in the publicly accessible Jira project via a browser where you're not signed in to any Atlassian cloud product.\r\n # Issue views successfully.\r\n # In the same browser, open another tab and log in with an existing portal-only customer in a Jira service desk portal of the same public project.\r\n # Try to view the same issue again from step#: 2\r\n # You will be redirected to the Jira service desk portal.\r\n # (Optional) - [Migrate the portal-only-user to the Atlassian account|https://confluence.atlassian.com/cloud/manage-jira-service-desk-customer-accounts-913213935.html#ManageJiraServiceDeskcustomeraccounts-HowcanIgivelicensestocustomersIwanttocollaboratewithintrueorConfluence?].\r\n # Repeat steps 2-6 again\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nThe publicly accessible project issues should be accessible in both cases i.e. When the portal-only customer account is logged into the portal or not logged in.\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nThe publicly accessible project issues are accessible only when the customer is not logged into the portal.\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nA possible workaround could be to use two different browsers until this bug is fixed. One browser window to login to the portal and another browser to view the public issues. Alternatively, the same browser can be used with one standard window and another private browsing (incognito) to view public issues.\r\n{panel:title=Example Use Case|borderStyle=dashed|borderColor=#cccccc|titleBGColor=#f7d6c1|bgColor=#ffffce}\r\nAll our customers can have a service desk customer account which they need to ask support. If a customer uses this service desk to e.g. request a feature, we might log this as a feature request in our \"public\" jira (a jira project where anyone can view the issues and see their progress). Typically, the service desk ticket is then closed with a message that a feature request is made (with a link to it) and that we plan to deliver this feature then or then.\r\n\r\nAn anonymous user can - like expected - view the ticket. If that user then clicks on login, he can login using his service desk customer login, and can still see the ticket and navigate the public jira project. However, once he visits the service desk portal, he cannot return to the public jira project anymore, as he keeps being redirected to the service desk interface.\r\n\r\nHowever, we want all users (anonymous and service desk customers) to view and browse our public jira project.\r\n{panel}",

We tried to re-apply our current Zephyr plugin license, which is still valid and an unlimited license.  However, we got an error saying this is an invalid license and cannot be used and the plugin would not work.  For now we have applied a trial license of Zephyr and the plugin is working. \n\nThis may just be a matter of renewing our purchased Zephyr license (expiring February 8th), but, our old license should work until then.\n\nCould you please give some guidance to resolve this issue?

This will make making a comment to the Customer and Internally simultaneously possible, and it might able to prevent mis-commenting to the wrong party like accidentally clicking on comment button while the tab still selecting \"Respond to Customer\", where it meant for \"Internal Users\".\n\nWith this feature, it could make it possible to comment simultaneoulsy to Customer and Internal User since they have independent comment between tabs.",

Expected behaviour\n\nWith the new agent-based license the user, should only be created as a \"Customer\" in Service Desk (specially if the option to restrict the access to the customer portal is enabled in SD).\n\nThis is not the expected behaviour because this also occurs when Service Desk is configured to restrict the access to the Customer Portal, and if the user tries to do his first login through the Custom Portal, his user has permission on all the system.",
