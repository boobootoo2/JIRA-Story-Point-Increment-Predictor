      "description": "h3. Summary\r\n\r\nWhen an issue is deleted on one node, it can still appear in searches on some other node. The key and summary of the issue are visible, but after clicking on the issue they change to \"This issue can no longer be opened\" message.\r\n\r\nThis happens when an \"UPDATE\" replication event is placed into the database after a \"DELETE\" event *and* they are processed in the immediate following batches by the node.\r\n For example, with the following database entries, if one batch is processed at 20:22:48, it will reply the DELETE event, and then the next batch will process the UPDATE event, reviving the deleted issue.\r\n !Screen Shot 2019-01-02 at 10.34.23.png|thumbnail! \u00a0\r\n\r\nIn production instances, this usually happens due to some automation performing very quick operations, e.g. changing the issue's description and immediately deleting it.\r\n Sometimes this can lead to the DELETE event being stored in the database before the UPDATE event that was performed earlier.\r\n Even though both of the operations will be added to the database milliseconds apart, with some unlucky timing they can be processed in separate batches, as described above.\r\nh3. Environment\r\n\r\nJira Data Center\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nIt's very hard to reproduce this in the UI. The easiest way is to create the scenario directly in the database.\r\n 1. Create some test issue and grab its id (e.g. by running select on the _jiraissue_ table), here it's 10005\r\n 2. Delete the issue from the database:\r\n{code:java}\r\ndelete from jiraissue where id = 10005;\r\n{code}\r\n3. Create a DELETE replication event, like the one below. Note that the\u00a0node's id (_c44634_) has to belong to a running node, and the\u00a0operation's id (_11035_) needs to be larger than the last processed replication event from that node.\r\n{code:java}\r\ninsert into REPLICATEDINDEXOPERATION values (11035, now(), 'c44634', 'ISSUE', 'NONE', 10005, 'DELETE', '');\r\n{code}\r\n4. After ~5 seconds, create an UPDATE replication event, with the same constraints as above. Waiting too little can make this event be processed in the same batch as the previous event, or 2 batches later - in both of those scenarios the bug seems to not be reproducible.\r\n{code:java}\r\ninsert into REPLICATEDINDEXOPERATION values (11036, now(), 'c44634', 'ISSUE', 'NONE', 10005, 'UPDATE', '');\r\n{code}\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nThe issue does not appear in the search results.\r\n Nice to have: some message is logged in the application's log about the race occurring.\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nThe issue's key and summary are visible in searches. Users are unable to view issue details.\r\n !Screen Shot 2019-01-02 at 10.30.26.png|thumbnail!\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nTo fix the index inconsistency, run a project reindex, or a full reindex.\r\n\r\n[How to remove from Jira lucene index, issues that have been deleted in the database, but still present in index|https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirakb/how-to-remove-from-jira-lucene-index-issues-that-have-been-deleted-in-the-database-but-still-present-in-index-998896911.html] offers a workaround that does not require a project or full re-index.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe the occurrences can also be limited by modifying automation scripts to avoid updating issues right before deleting them.",

When deleting the parent page choosing to delete the child pages altogether, Confluence will send a huge number of requests to JIRA for deleting the issue links. This will cause JIRA to stall for a certain amount of time.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n# Create a page with 50 child pages\r\n# For each child page, mention 20 unique JIRA issues\r\n# Delete the parent page and choose to delete all the child pages\r\n# Confluence will send 50 * 20 = 1000 DELETE requests to JIRA like this:\r\n{code}\r\n127.0.0.1 1346x24774x2 admin [26/Dec/2018:22:26:07 +0800] \"DELETE /jira790/rest/api/latest/issue/PUB-992/remotelink?globalId=appId%3Ddb73d65e-9dd8-3d71-a88a-c5504a978829%26pageId%3D3670036&xoauth_requestor_id=admin HTTP/1.1\" 204 - 1026 \"-\" \"Apache-HttpClient/4.5.5 (Java/1.8.0_181)\" \"1mm8l02\"\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nh3. Suggestions\r\nFor Atlassian - come up with a better way to handle this scenario, so that JIRA performance won't be noticeably affected.\r\n\r\nFor JIRA/Confluence end-users - schedule a maintenance window whenever it comes to deleting a page that involves a huge number of JIRA issues.",

Issue Summary\r\n\r\nWhen we add a Table from the drop down option in the visual mode while updating any issue field (be it comments section) , It adds an extra line after the table and and if we delete the table again in the visual mode, the extra line doesn't go away and it gives a drop down option with nothing listed.\u00a0\r\nh3. Environment\r\n\r\nIssue reproducible in 7.6.6 and 7.6.9\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Add a simple text custom field which has Wiki Renderer.\r\n # Add the custom field to all the screens including edit issue screen.\r\n # Open any issue from a project.\u00a0\r\n # Click on Edit issue\r\n # You should be able to see the custom field where you can input anything either in Visual mode or in Text mode\r\n # Stay on Visual mode and click on drop down box to create a table\r\n # Save it.\u00a0\r\n # Now click on the edit issue again and in visual mode, delete the table by selecting delete table from the options that you get when you click inside the table\r\n # You will see that it has not removed the extra space and instead leaved behind a expand or a drop down menu\r\n # This behaviour is not seen when adding and removing table from Text mode.\u00a0\r\n\r\nh3.

Problem Definition\r\nCurrently, when Jira\u00a0Datacente node is shutdown while running FullReindex task (see related JRASERVER-47045, JRASERVER-66204), there is no way to remove this task from the cluster.

Suggested Solution\r\nAllow Jira system admin to delete stale FullReindex task. \r\n\r\nh3. Implemented Solution\r\n* (i) Before using this feature, please check if JRASERVER-68885 fits your needs as it's a much simpler and safer option.\r\n* In order to remove stale re-index job from a cluster you can use REST API call (JIRA _Sysadmin_ permission required):\r\n** Method: DELETE\r\n** URL: {{<JIRA>/rest/internal/2/reindex/unlock}}\r\n* It will try to find active foreground re-index task and remove it if it belongs to +OFFLINE+ node.\r\n** (!) Since call removes only re-index task (which is assumed to be stuck), and doesn't kill the re-index thread itself, make sure that an actual node went down before you use this API (to ensure safety, there is also a check in the code).\r\n \r\nh3.
