Problem Definition\r\n* User starts typing a Service Desk request summary and is presented with KB articles suggestions\r\n* User clicks on an article to expand it in the pop-up window\r\n* User clicks on a link in the article content taking them to another article that is not in the KB space linked to the Service Desk project\r\n* A new browser tab open but the article can't be displayed. Instead, the user gets: \r\n{panel}\r\nThe knowledge base article could not be found.\r\nView other portals\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\nAllow Service Desk users to open links to articles if they're not part of the KB space linked to the Service Desk project. Ideally, these should be handled as regular links and Confluence should manage access to them based on space/page permissions. \r\nThe issue is occurring because the article link is rendered as a Service Desk servlet link: *https://<cloud_url>/plugins/servlet/servicedesk/customer/confluence/shim/spaces/<space_key>/pages/<page_id>/<page_name>* then rewritten to *https://<cloud_url>/servicedesk/customer/kb/view/<page_id>*\r\nand not a direct link to the page: \r\n*https://<cloud_url>/wiki/spaces/<space_key>/pages/<page_id>/<page_name>*\r\nh3.

Problem Definition\r\nAt the moment, to remove the Service Desk customers for the customer's list, you would need to do it from the people page by removing the account from the Service Desk customer's role. \r\n\r\nThis only applies if the Service Desk customer is not in any organisations. If the customer is in organisation, you can easily remove the account from the organisations by clicking on 'x' button next to the customer, but this would remove the customer completely from the organisation and not just specifically for the project.\r\n\r\nThis creates confusion for admins who manage the user via the Service Desk customer's page, and that they have to remove their customers via JIRA users and roles/ people page.\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\nIt would be a lot simpler and efficient to have the Service Desk customer's management, including the removal of account, be done in the Service Desk customer's page. \r\n\r\nPeople page - For Agents\r\nCustomer page - For customer\r\n\r\nPerhaps, we can have the 'X' button next to the customer's account on the SD customer page to remove the account.\r\n\r\nh3. Why this is important\r\nWith the current behavior, if you have a JIRA user who is also a customer, and Service Desk customer's role is given to a group, removing the user from the group or group from the role is not really an effective way. You would have to create a separate group just specifically for the project so you can have a specific group to be assigned as Service Desk customer's role, which not really an ideal solution.\r\n ",

Our email system maintains a suppression list of recipient email addresses that have recently caused a hard bounce for any customer. \r\n If you try to send an email to an address that is on the suppression list, the call to JIRA succeeds, but it treats the email as a hard bounce instead of attempting to send it.\r\n\r\nJust to make sure no other user was impacted I have done a bulk search for your domain and it turens out we had more emails at the same state:\r\n * [ahirani@wes.org|mailto:ahirani@wes.org]\r\n * [jgrande@wes.org|mailto:jgrande@wes.org]\r\n * [tstone@wes.org|mailto:tstone@wes.org]\r\n * [szhang@wes.org|mailto:szhang@wes.org]\r\n * [ktoich@wes.org|mailto:ktoich@wes.org]\r\n * [sarsalan@wes.org|mailto:sarsalan@wes.org]\r\n * [efinnerty@wes.org|mailto:efinnerty@wes.org]\r\n * [tbarrientos@wes.org|mailto:tbarrientos@wes.org]\r\n * [mbahamdoun@wes.org|mailto:mbahamdoun@wes.org]\r\n * [ldursunova@wes.org|mailto:ldursunova@wes.org]\r\n * [pmazella@wes.org|mailto:pmazella@wes.org]\r\n * [tdasilva@wes.org|mailto:tdasilva@wes.org]\r\n * [mfebria@wes.org|mailto:mfebria@wes.org]\r\n * [herharhaghen@wes.org|mailto:herharhaghen@wes.org]\r\n\r\nI've removed the address from the suppression list, but you still need to verify this issue with your Email administrator to make sure in the next attempt we'll be able to reach the mailbox of that user.\r\n\r\nOnce you have the error resolved just trigger a reset password email for these users.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n *Andr\u00e9 Kasper*\r\n Atlassian Cloud Support",

      "description": "h3. Summary\r\nSLA timers not stopping if SLA has a condition \"Comment: For Customer\" when reporter or request participant and commented agent is the same user\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Set up an SLA that should stopped when a comment: For Customers is added to a customer ticket\r\n # Create an issue  and add a public comment as the same user\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nSLA timer should stop when comment is added\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nSLA timer keeps ticking forever and ever\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\nThe workaround consists of two elements, an automation rule and the SLA and is as follows:\r\nh4. The Automation Rule\r\n\r\nSo in this example\r\n * We took the default automation rule *Comment updates reply status* duplicated this and called it *Comment updates reply status for request participants bug*.\r\n * Next is the less pretty element of the workaround where we amended the issue match JQL from\r\n{code:java}\r\n Status = \"Waiting for support\" AND \"Request Type\" is not EMPTY {code}\r\nto\r\n{code:java}\r\n Status = \"Waiting for support\" AND \"Request Type\" is not EMPTY AND (assignee = agent1 AND \"Request participants\" in (agent1)) OR (assignee = agent2 AND \"Request participants\" in (agent2)) {code}\r\nor\r\n{code:java}\r\n Status = \"Waiting for support\" AND \"Request Type\" is not EMPTY AND assignee in (agent1, agent2) AND \"Request participants\" in (agent1, agent2) {code}\r\ndepending on your requirements.\r\n\r\n * \r\n ** The first option would only cover if the assignee and request participant are the same.\r\n *** This is a little more work to create as you would need repeat this syntax for each of your agents:\r\n{code:java}\r\n(assignee = agent1 AND \"Request participants\" in (agent1)) OR (assignee = agent2 AND \"Request participants\" in (agent2)){code}\r\n\r\n * \r\n ** The second option has the added benefit of stopping the clock if you have another agent working a ticket alongside the assignee who responds to the customer on their behalf, however this does have the drawback of the agent always acting as an agent when a request participant even if that might not be the intention.\r\n *** This is also a little less overhead in terms of JQL writing as this requires only one clause for assignee and one for request participants each containing a list of all your agents:\r\n{code:java}\r\nassignee in (agent1, agent2) AND \"Request participants\" in (agent1, agent2){code}\r\n\r\n * The end result of this automation is that the issue will be transitioned to *Waiting for customer* status when a comment is added by an agent who is a request participant.\r\n\r\nHere are two screenshots from my test site of the the Automation rules described above.\r\n\r\nOption 1: Only the agent who is assignee stops the clock\r\n !Screenshot 2019-05-15 at 11.36.29.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nOption 2: All agents who are request participants stop the clock \r\n !Screenshot 2019-05-15 at 12.07.55.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\n*NB*: An unexpected side effect of this rule is that if you remove the option *User is an agent* from the automation rule matching criteria the SLA clock will stop but the issue will not transition. \r\n\r\nh4. The SLA\r\n\r\nHere we change added a stop condition to the SLA settings:\r\n *Entered Status: Waiting for customer*\r\n So this means that we are now relient on a status change which will be triggered by the above automation to stop this SLA clock. The end result looks like:\r\n !Screenshot 2019-05-15 at 11.37.57.png|thumbnail! \r\n Of course you can add you own goals in here as you see fit.",

The background also changes to permission denied but the window does not dissapear.\r\n\r\nThis only occurs when viewing tickets from the queue, with a url similar to: https://<instance>.atlassian.net/projects/<KEY>/queues/custom/205/<TICKET>\r\n\r\nWhen using a direct link like: https://<instance>.atlassian.net/browse/<TICKET>\r\nIt works as expected, the background changes to permission denied and the window dissapears after adding the comment and performing the transition.\r\n\r\nh3. Environment\r\nConfirmed on Windows and Mac\r\nChrome, IE 11, Edge\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Create a post function to set the issue level security to a level the assignee will no longer have access to _after_ the transition is performed and a screen to add an internal comment\r\n# View a ticket using the 'Queues' menu\r\n# Perform the transition that will edit the security level, add an internal comment during transition, notice the windows freezes with a spinning wheel\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nThe transition screen disappears and you are left with a permission denied warning\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nThe transition screen freezes whilst the background updates to a permission denied warning\r\n\r\n h3.Workaround\r\nView the ticket directly instead of from the queues menu and perform the transition then\r\n",

      "description": "For context, I work with a couple of different projects that like to have their issue trackers public. Foremost this is to give their users more direct insight into what features are up for consideration, bounce ideas off of each other, and see their current statuses. Additionally, being generally smaller teams makes directly having \"support reps\" responding to all requests, managing duplicates, etc unfeasible or just overkill.\r\n\r\nFor a public issue tracker, Jira Software/Jira Core is out of reach due to the fact that licenses are per-user no matter the users' role. I've seen Jira Service Desk as an alternative to this, so that payment is only made for agents, and there is still the option of linking back to Jira Software/Core. That said, currently the only method to access the requests screen is by clicking your username, and then clicking \"all\". This is very unintuitive, so for this use case it is still a bit of a stretch.\r\n\r\nIt would be great to have the option of putting the request list on the project customer portal, with a \"create request\" link sending the user to what is now the portal page, or at least on the current portal page having a link to \"browse all issues\". Additionally, having public request lists that don't require a user to be in an organization as well as integrating a search functionality into the issue reporting workflow (common in other community management suites) would help streamline this use case.",

For example, Dutch customers, when searching the portal for knowledge base only can view Dutch translated knowledge base articles, they will not be able to view the same knowledge base in English language in the same space.\r\n\r\nThis will be a label based system or the same way how the browser is able to detect the browser language and affect the customer portal language, the knowledge base should follow in suit to that specified language only.\u00a0",

Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Create a Service Desk ticket via API, adding a request participant using their email address as the parameter:\r\n{code}curl  -X POST --user 'user:pass' -H 'content-type: application/json' 'https://site.atlassian.net/rest/servicedeskapi/request' -d '{\r\n\"serviceDeskId\": \"<id>\",\r\n\"requestTypeId\": \"<id>\",\r\n\"requestFieldValues\":\r\n\r\n{ \"summary\": \"Creating a Test Issue\", \"description\": \"Lorem ipsum\" }\r\n,\r\n\"requestParticipants\": [\r\n\"email@domain.com\"]\r\n}'{code}\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nThe ticket is created and \"email@domain.com\" is added as a participant.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nThe following error is returned:\r\n\r\n{code}\r\n{\"errorMessage\":\"Sorry, but the following usernames could not be added as participant to this request: email@domain.com\",\"i18nErrorMessage\":{\"i18nKey\":\"sd.request.participants.username.error\",\"parameters\":[\"email@domain.com\"]}}\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nh3. Notes/Workaround\r\n\r\nIt is possible to add request participants using their *username* instead. However, with the [recent changes to usernames|https://confluence.atlassian.com/cloud/blog/2018/06/say-goodbye-to-usernames-in-atlassian-cloud], there's no easy way to find customer's usernames.\r\n\r\nService Desk Agents can retrieve this through the Experimental API (/rest/servicedeskapi/servicedesk/<service_desk_id>/customer)",
