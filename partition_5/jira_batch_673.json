However, currently only usernames that begin with *john* are included. \r\n\r\nh4. Notes\r\n* This feature is not found for the assignee and reporter field\r\n* This is found in the user management page when searching for a user.\r\n\r\nh3.

Steps to reproduce:\r\n# Create a JIRA mail handler\r\n# Send an email with the character {{NUL}} (0x00) as part of the Description\r\n*Expected Result:* JIRA corrects the {{NUL}} character unsupported by postgres and creates the issue normally\r\n*Actual Result:* JIRA fails to create the issue and keeps attempting to create it every 1 minute.\r\n\r\nThis bug also causes: [JRA-38024|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRA-38024] - JIRA increments pcounter when UTF encoding errors occurs\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Note on fix\r\nWe introduced the filter to sanitize the message body during email processing by Jira Mail handler ({{com.atlassian.jira.plugins.mail.handlers.CreateOrCommentHandler}}): \r\n{code:Java|borderStyle=solid}\r\n    public static String sanitizeText(@Nullable String text) {\r\n        if (text == null) {\r\n            return null;\r\n        }\r\n        return text.replace(\"\\0\", \"\");\r\n    }\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, the error/exception comes _OfBiz_ code when it's not being able to handle the malformed data (see JRASERVER-72673). We expect the code creating/adding issues will sanitize the data and call _OfBiz_ with valid parameters. \r\n\r\n(!) That being said, they could be other problems with the same symptom caused by 3rd party Apps. \r\n",

However these versions and proposed release versions are not appearing in all users drop downs as they did previously. \r\n\r\nDrop down fields I would expect to see these Requested Release Month / Archived Affects Versions. Requested Release Month etc. \r\n\r\nCan someone please look into this and revert it must be due to a setting which I have failed to apply but I cannot tell. \r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://ent01-jira.bankofamerica.com:8081/browse/REG/?selectedTab=com.atlassian.jira.jira-projects-plugin:summary-panel\r\n",

Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Connect JIRA to one or more LDAP directories which syncs a large amount of users\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n- Faster load on create project modal\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nA large amount of time is spent fetching users. This can be seen from profiling application here:\r\n!getProjectTemplates.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nh3.Workaround\r\n- There is a 5 second timeout on the create project dialog in JIRA 7.0.0, 7.0.1 and 7.02 which exasperates this problem. In JIRA 7.0.4 the timeout has been increased to 60 seconds. Upgrading to a JIRA version later than 7.0.3 should help.\r\n\r\nOriginal Description:\r\n{quote}\r\nIn certain situations (a lot of external user directories) create project dialog can timeout due to slow backend processing. \r\nIn my case client had like 17 AD configured and during the create project dialog there is some code executed:\r\ncom.atlassian.jira.projecttemplates.rest.ProjectTemplatesResource#getProjectTemplates\r\n{code}\r\n...\r\n                .shouldShowProjectLead(userManager.getTotalUserCount() > 1 || !authContext.isLoggedInUser())\r\n...\r\n{code}\r\nthe offending line is:\r\n{code}\r\nuserManager.getTotalUserCount() > 1\r\n{code}\r\nwhich basically means that we want to display project lead picker (user picker).\r\nThe current implementation iterates over all directories and handles shadow users and it's slow. but in this case we need only information if there are multiple users in the system (more than 1).\r\nmaybe instead of {code}userManager.getTotalUserCount(){code} we could use something like \r\n{code}\r\ncom.atlassian.jira.bc.user.search.DefaultUserPickerSearchService#findUsers(com.atlassian.jira.bc.JiraServiceContext, java.lang.String, com.atlassian.jira.bc.user.search.UserSearchParams)\r\n{code}\r\nand pass parameter that limits output to 2 users (or any other way of doing some fast query with user limit)\r\n{quote}",

Summary\r\nThe JIRA H2 Database does not contain constraints on field length that match the typical External database schemas. \r\n\r\nThis allows large fields to be recorded in the embedded database that subsequently cause an import to fail, for example: {{value too long for type character varying(255)}}\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Environment\r\nJIRA 7, originally hosted on an embedded database, then transported over to\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Set up a JIRA environment to use an embedded database. \r\n# Configure the JIRA instance to use an Active directory that contains long descritions for groups \r\n# Export the Instance as an XML Backup. \r\n# Switch the database, and try to import the XML backup again. The Import will fail due to content being larger than the fields in the schema definition. \r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nThe Constraint on fields should be applied evenly across all databases. \r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nYou can use long strings for content (Group descriptions, for example) in an embedded database, but not others. \r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\nIf you do happen to experience this issue, remove the offending content from your embedded database, before creating a new export. \r\n",
