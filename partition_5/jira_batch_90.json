When I work on aos-designer, aosl-cpp or utilcpp, I tend to use directly a clone of aos-all, so that I can commit changes in these different repos in sync (they can be used separately too so I still need them in different repositories) - you can see the subrepos on the screenshot.\r\n\r\nHowever, when I work on aos-webplayer or aosl, I tend to use several separate clone repos on my local disk because I do a lot of experimentation. (on the screenshot, some of these repos are visible on the left)\r\n\r\nThe Problem:\r\n\r\nLet's say I have a repo open in SourceTree and I open subrepos. Then I open repositories that are forks of the master repos of these subrepos.\r\nAs you can see on the screenshot, there is no way to differentiate between subrepo or not subrepo clones by looking at the tabs titles.\r\nEven when you open the window, you might have no clue about if it is or not a subrepo.\r\n\r\nBasically my request is to have some signal to:\r\n\r\n - help identify which open repository is a subrepo clone or not;\r\n - if it's a subrepo clone, help identify which repo is the parent (it should be in the upper directory hierarchy anyway, otherwise it's a separate clone);\r\n\r\nSome ideas:\r\n\r\n - just have a tooltip displaying the full address of the repository when you move the mouse over the tab name (I think it's the simplest way to fix it and it also help locate where it is);\r\n - maybe have different tab colors for open subrepos?\r\n\r\n",
