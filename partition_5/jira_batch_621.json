      "description": "h3. Summary\r\nThe processing of the outgoing mail queue is single threaded and can get delayed (making the notifications to pile up in the queue) due to the thread (processing the notifications) taking a long time to calculate what had changed in an issue before the notification is sent out.\r\nSee also other related issue:  JRASERVER-61543\r\n\r\nh3. Environment\r\nI have reproduced the issue in:\r\n * JIRA 7.2.8\r\n * Outgoing mail enabled\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Enable outgoing mail\r\n # Create a test project\r\n # Create some issues to the project inserting in any of the multi-text fields a very long text (approximately 300000 characters).\r\n # Edit one or more of the issues created by deleting the 300000 from the multi-text field and just pasting the first 1000 characters (from the long text of 300000 characters)\r\n # When the notification is being sent the thread processing it will be take some time to calculate the difference of what change in the issue and will have the same stack trace as the one detailed in the description of the bug above.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nThe thread processing the notifications should process the differences faster or it should have a time out that can be configured by the administrator so when it takes a certain time to process a notification a template notification (such as \"Too many things have change in this issue\" or similar) is sent instead of spending a long time in calculating the changes.\r\nThe administrator should be able to switch the time out on/off as well as being able to set the max time out interval.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nThe processing of the outgoing mail queue gets delayed, making the notifications to pile up in the queue and affecting the performance of it.\r\n\r\nThe thread processing the notification will have the below stack trace:\r\n{code}\r\n \"Sending mailitem com.atlassian.jira.mail.IssueMailQueueItem@682a8028[issue=com.atlassian.jira.issue.IssueImpl@5122ec89[id=837382,summary=Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit ,key=PROJ-123,created=2017-01-06 19:27:14.107,updated=2017-08-18 05:50:47.763,assignee=user1(user1),reporter=user2(user2)],remoteUser=user3(user3),notificationType=Current_Assignee,eventTypeId=2,templateId=2]\" #182 daemon prio=5 os_prio=0 tid=0x0000000058c36800 nid=0x1600 runnable [0x000000006631b000]\r\n java.lang.Thread.State: RUNNABLE\r\n at org.apache.commons.jrcs.diff.myers.MyersDiff.buildPath(MyersDiff.java:129)\r\n at org.apache.commons.jrcs.diff.myers.MyersDiff.diff(MyersDiff.java:93)\r\n at org.apache.commons.jrcs.diff.Diff.diff(Diff.java:197)\r\n at com.atlassian.diff.WordLevelDiffer.diffWords(WordLevelDiffer.java:101)\r\n at com.atlassian.diff.WordLevelDiffer.diffLine(WordLevelDiffer.java:91)\r\n at com.atlassian.diff.DiffViewBean.createWordLevelDiff(DiffViewBean.java:108)\r\n at com.atlassian.jira.mail.DiffUtils.diff(DiffUtils.java:19)\r\n at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke0(Native Method)\r\n at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(NativeMethodAccessorImpl.java:62)\r\n at sun.reflect.DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.java:43)\r\n at java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Method.java:498)\r\n at org.apache.velocity.util.introspection.UberspectImpl$VelMethodImpl.doInvoke(UberspectImpl.java:385)\r\n at org.apache.velocity.util.introspection.UberspectImpl$VelMethodImpl.invoke(UberspectImpl.java:374)\r\n at com.atlassian.velocity.htmlsafe.introspection.UnboxingMethod.invoke(UnboxingMethod.java:30)\r\n...\r\n at com.atlassian.velocity.DefaultVelocityManager.writeEncodedBodyForContent(DefaultVelocityManager.java:86)\r\n at com.atlassian.jira.template.velocity.DefaultVelocityTemplatingEngine$DefaultRenderRequest.toWriterImpl(DefaultVelocityTemplatingEngine.java:129)\r\n at com.atlassian.jira.template.velocity.DefaultVelocityTemplatingEngine$DefaultRenderRequest.asPlainText(DefaultVelocityTemplatingEngine.java:108)\r\n at com.atlassian.jira.template.velocity.DefaultVelocityTemplatingEngine$DefaultRenderRequest$1.with(DefaultVelocityTemplatingEngine.java:92)\r\n at com.atlassian.jira.template.velocity.DefaultVelocityTemplatingEngine$DefaultRenderRequest$StringRepresentation.toString(DefaultVelocityTemplatingEngine.java:77)\r\n at com.atlassian.jira.template.velocity.DefaultVelocityTemplatingEngine$DefaultRenderRequest.asPlainText(DefaultVelocityTemplatingEngine.java:94)\r\n at com.atlassian.jira.mail.builder.EmailRenderer.renderEmailBody(EmailRenderer.java:103)\r\n at com.atlassian.jira.mail.builder.EmailRenderer.render(EmailRenderer.java:150)\r\n at com.atlassian.jira.mail.builder.EmailBuilder.renderNow(EmailBuilder.java:155)\r\n at com.atlassian.jira.mail.builder.EmailBuilder.renderNowAsQueueItem(EmailBuilder.java:145)\r\n at com.atlassian.jira.mail.MailingListCompiler$1.evaluateEmailForRecipient(MailingListCompiler.java:336)\r\n at com.atlassian.jira.mail.NotificationRecipientProcessor.evaluateEmails(NotificationRecipientProcessor.java:39)\r\n at com.atlassian.jira.mail.MailingListCompiler.evaluateEmails(MailingListCompiler.java:267)\r\n...\r\n at com.atlassian.jira.mail.MailingListCompiler.prepareEmail(MailingListCompiler.java:170)\r\n at com.atlassian.jira.mail.MailingListCompiler.sendLists(MailingListCompiler.java:101)\r\n at com.atlassian.jira.mail.IssueMailQueueItem.send(IssueMailQueueItem.java:128)\r\n at com.atlassian.mail.queue.MailQueueImpl.sendBufferUnderLock(MailQueueImpl.java:103)\r\n at com.atlassian.mail.queue.MailQueueImpl.sendBuffer(MailQueueImpl.java:56)\r\n at com.atlassian.jira.mail.JiraMailQueue$1.apply(JiraMailQueue.java:51)\r\n at com.atlassian.jira.mail.JiraMailQueue$1.apply(JiraMailQueue.java:48)\r\n at com.atlassian.jira.util.velocity.DefaultVelocityRequestContextFactory.runWithStaticBaseUrl(DefaultVelocityRequestContextFactory.java:110)\r\n at com.atlassian.jira.util.DefaultBaseUrl.runWithStaticBaseUrl(DefaultBaseUrl.java:50)\r\n at com.atlassian.jira.mail.JiraMailQueue.sendBuffer(JiraMailQueue.java:48)\r\n at com.atlassian.jira.service.services.mail.MailQueueService.run(MailQueueService.java:21)\r\n...\r\n at com.atlassian.scheduler.caesium.impl.SchedulerQueueWorker.run(SchedulerQueueWorker.java:34)\r\n at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:745)\r\n {code}\r\n\u00a0\r\nh3. Workaround\r\nFlushing the queue can help to ease the problem as it add another thread to process notifications.\r\n(!) Please note that you shouldn't flush the queue more then once, since it will use more Caesium (scheduler) threads. \r\n\r\nh3. Additional Notes\r\n\r\nIt is very important to note that the bigger the difference between the original text in the multi-line text field and what it was updated then the longer the diff libraries will take to process what it was change.\r\nFor example comparing 1000 characters vs 300000 characters will take longer than comparing 240000 characters vs 300000 characters as the difference is smaller in the second comparison.\r\n\u00a0",

      "description": "One of the features of the JIRA user server is the ability to restrict application logins to selected IP addresses. Unfortunately, this functionality breaks if the connecting application access JIRA through a proxy or WAF, such as Apache, Nginx, Amazon ELB or Cloudflare. In these cases, it is necessary to specify the IP address of the proxy, rather than the actual IP address of the remote application. Although obvious in hindsight, this may not be readily apparent when setting the user server up, nor is it mentioned in the documentation (\u00a0[https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiraserver074/connecting-to-crowd-or-another-jira-application-for-user-management-881683375.html] ).\r\n\r\nWhile it is simple enough to specify the address(es) of the proxy in the allowed IP address area, this essentially bypasses the restrictions as any client able to connect to the proxy is able to access the user server facility (assuming the password is known and no special configuration is in place on the proxy).\r\n\r\nOne trait of most (or all) proxy applications is that they add headers indicating what the originating host's IP address was (Apache uses X-Forwarded-For, Cloudflare uses CF-Connecting-IP). While these headers can't be trusted by default, the ability to define the topology of connections would make this facility more useful. This configuration might resemble the following:\r\nAllowed IP addresses: ELB IP\r\nX-Forwarded-For: WAF IPs\r\nWAF-Source-IP: Application endpoints\r\n\r\nI wasn't certain if this was actually an embedded crowd issue or not, so I took my best guess on where to file the issue.",

Notes\r\n* Thread dump will show the following stack-trace for the thread which loads {{/rest/api/2/filter/favourite}}, part related to _com.atlassian.jira.rest.v2.search.FilterBean_\r\n{noformat}\r\n...\r\n\tat com.atlassian.jira.rest.v2.search.UserListResolver.getShareCount(UserListResolver.java:137)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.jira.rest.v2.search.UserBeanListWrapper.<init>(UserBeanListWrapper.java:40)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.jira.rest.v2.search.FilterBeanBuilder.build(FilterBeanBuilder.java:173)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.jira.rest.v2.search.FilterResource$SearchRequestToFilterBean.apply(FilterResource.java:650)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.jira.rest.v2.search.FilterResource$SearchRequestToFilterBean.apply(FilterResource.java:622)\r\n\tat com.google.common.collect.Iterators$8.next(Iterators.java:812)\r\n\tat com.google.common.collect.Lists.newArrayList(Lists.java:139)\r\n\tat com.google.common.collect.Lists.newArrayList(Lists.java:119)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.jira.rest.v2.search.FilterResource.getFavouriteFilters(FilterResource.java:422)\r\n..\r\n{noformat}\r\n* Each _FilterBean_  object (corresponds to _favourite filter_) is around 2.8MB, so having 100 of them will use ~300MB of memory. \r\n* Heap dump will show large memory consumed by _org.apache.tomcat.util.threads.TaskThread_\r\n** Snippet from dominator tree with 350 _favourite filters_: \r\n|| Object / Stack Frame |Name  | Shallow Heap | Retained Heap ||\r\n|org.apache.tomcat.util.threads.TaskThread @ 0x235d499d8|http-nio-8080-exec-1061 url:/jira/rest/api/2/filter/f...  |          128 |   961,473,680 |\r\n|org.apache.tomcat.util.threads.TaskThread @ 0x235d49b98|http-nio-8080-exec-1059 url:/jira/rest/api/2/filter/f...  |          128 |   863,698,080 |\r\n\r\nh3.Workaround\r\n*  Reduce number of favourite filters\r\n*  Set dark feature {{com.atlassian.jira.rest.v2.search.UserListResolver.getShareCount.disabled}} flag, that will always return _sharedUsers.size: 0_ in JSON response, eg:\r\n{noformat}\r\nsharedUsers: {\r\n size: 0,\r\n items: [ ],\r\n max-results: 1000,\r\n start-index: 0,\r\n end-index: 0\r\n},\r\n{noformat}\r\n*- (!) API break. Since after change {{/rest/api/2/filter/favourite}} API doesn't return a correct number of the share count there is a risk that it will affect some other functionality. \r\n\r\nh3. Note on fix \r\n* The issue was work-arounded in 7.2.12, 7.6.1 and 7.7 by introducing an extra query param _enableSharedUsers_ to {{/rest/api/2/filter/favourite}} and {{/rest/api/2/filter/id}} to show that users shouldn't be calculated.\r\n** By default, this param is true, so endpoints are fully backwards compatible. So that still can cause the mentioned problem \r\n** We've started using this param in JIRA itself ( issue-nav uses _enableSharedUsers=false_), so the problem should be fixed for JIRA.",

      "description": "h3. Problem Definition\r\nIf JIRA is temporarily unable to reach the SQL server (either because of a network problem, or SQL maintenance that leaves SQL unresponsive), scheduled tasks like email processing (inbound and outbound) can become broken until JIRA is restarted.\r\nWorsening the problem is that JIRA does not provide an indication in the UI that this scenario has happened.   So an outage of SQL can be expected to cause problems in JIRA, but when the SQL server/network has recovered, if JIRA has not been restarted since that time, the JIRA admin might have to wait an extended period of time before realizing this component is not working JIRA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\nIt would be helpful if there was a healthcheck that could detect when SQL has become unavailable for a certain period of time to help alert JIRA Administrators as to when this kind of problem exists on the system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Why this is important\r\nCustomers expect JIRA to be reliable, and when SQL is down, JIRA needs to indicate that in some clear way to the JIRA Admin so they can promptly take action to address the problem.\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround \r\n- Restart JIRA, but obviously this should not be necessary",

      "description": "h3. Summary\r\n\r\nThis is an edge case of JRASERVER-38147 and JRASERVER-44236.\r\nThanks to the fix for JRASERVER-44236, the performance problem seemed to be solved in case that the filter permission was global.\r\nHowever, this problem could still happen in case that the filter permission was *not global* (e.g. the filter was limited to a specific project) and tons of users were associated with the project.\r\n\r\nh3. Environment\r\n* JIRA Server 7.4.3\r\n* MySQL (any database is possible)\r\n* OpenLDAP (any directory service is possible)\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n# Prepare a fresh installed JIRA 7.4.3 + MySQL\r\n# Integrate JIRA with any external directory and synchronize users and groups\r\n#- In the external directory,\r\n*-- there are some users like 'testuser1', 'testuser2'...\r\n*-- there is one group 'testgroup' and the above users belong to the group\r\n#- Please make sure that JIRA internal directory is on top of the order\r\n# Make sure that the user who is reproducing this bug has *Browse Users* global permission\r\n# Create a project on JIRA\r\n# Go to _Project management > Permission_ and give *Browse project* permission to 'testgroup'\r\n#* In case *Any logged in user* has the permission, please revoke the permission and assigned it to the user who is reproducing this bug as well\r\n# Create some filters and share them with the project which you created in the step 4\r\n# Register the filters as your favorite ones\r\n# Open Issue Navigator\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nNo performance problem happens.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nThe following SQL were executed once for each favorite filter (like {{/rest/api/2/filter/10001}}) and *as many times as the number of the favorite filters* for {{rest/api/2/filter/favorite}} and they could consume the DB resources and JVM heap memory (cause Full GC, see another ticket for details: JRASERVER-65930)\r\n\r\n{code:sql}\r\n2017-09-04 07:52:35,407 http-nio-55049-exec-5 admin 472x898x1 1l1x7vx /rest/api/2/filter/10001 0ms \"SELECT user_name FROM cwd_user WHERE (lower_user_name IN ('testuser1', 'testuser2') ) AND (directory_id =  '1' ) ORDER BY lower_user_name\"\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nMoreover, all the users in the group appeared in the *WHERE* condition {{lower_user_name IN ('testuser1', 'testuser2')}}. The SQL seemed to check if the users who belong to the group are not in the higher ordered directory.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the more users in the external directory are associated with the project, the more DB resources are consumed. It doesn't seem to be scalable. Let's think about the following scenario.\r\n\r\n# There are many filters which are limited to specific projects\r\n# Tons of users are associated with the each project\r\n# Some users register many of such filters as their favorite ones\r\n# The users access Issue Navigator at the same time\r\n \r\nh3. Notes\r\n* There seemed to be some difference in the SQL between JIRA 7.4.x and JIRA 7.3.x.\r\n** JIRA 7.4.x\r\n{code:sql}\r\n2017-09-04 07:52:35,407 http-nio-55049-exec-5 admin 472x898x1 1l1x7vx /rest/api/2/filter/10001 0ms \"SELECT user_name FROM cwd_user WHERE (lower_user_name IN ('testuser1', 'testuser2') ) AND (directory_id =  '1' ) ORDER BY lower_user_name\"\r\n{code}\r\n** JIRA 7.3.x\r\n{code}\r\n2017-09-04 07:24:08,162 http-nio-41186-exec-4 admin 444x1796x1 1luqcea /rest/api/2/filter/10003 0ms \"SELECT user_name FROM cwd_user WHERE ((lower_user_name =  'testuser1' ) OR (lower_user_name =  'testuser2' )) AND (directory_id =  '1' ) ORDER BY lower_user_name\"\r\n{code}\r\n* Please refer to [my internal comment|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-65892?focusedCommentId=1603467&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-1603467] for the additional information\r\n\r\nh3.Workaround\r\n* Reduce number of favourite filters\r\n* Dark feature {{com.atlassian.jira.rest.v2.search.UserListResolver.getShareCount.disabled}} flag could solve the performance problem\r\n*- Only available with Jira 7.0.0+\r\n*- (!) API break. There is a risk that {{/rest/api/2/filter/favourite}} API doesn't return a correct number of the share count\r\n* Change the directory order\r\n*- This problem could still happen in case that there are tons of users in JIRA internal directory who were associated with the project\r\n\r\nh3. Note on fix \r\n* The issue was work-arounded in 7.2.12, 7.6.1 and 7.7 by introducing an extra query param _enableSharedUsers_ to {{/rest/api/2/filter/favourite}} and {{/rest/api/2/filter/id}} to show that users shouldn't be calculated.\r\n** By default, this param is true, so endpoints are fully backwards compatible. So that still can cause the mentioned problem \r\n** We've started using this param in JIRA itself ( issue-nav uses _enableSharedUsers=false_), so the problem should be fixed for JIRA.",

      "description": "h3. *Problem Statement:*\r\n\r\nOur environment requires mutual client/server authentication.  There are times when Jira reaches back to itself to get information.  One of these is when you go to add gadgets and it calls to get information of them, another is during the healthcheck when the baseurl is said to be bad.\r\n\r\nWe are using the following variables in our installation for the certificates:\r\njavax.net.ssl.trustStore\r\njavax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword\r\njavax.net.ssl.keyStore\r\njavax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword\r\n\r\nAs of Jira 7.4.3, Jira's implementation of both of these uses the HttpClientBuilder (org.apache.http.impl.client.HttpClientBuilder).  In order for the HttpClientBuilder to supportthe keyStore and keyStorePassword variables the \"useSystemProperties()\" needs to be called during it's setup.  For some reason without specifying this, only some of the variables are supported like the trustStore/trustStorePassword variables.\r\n\r\nJira's implementation of the gadget plugin (atlassian-gadgets-opensocial-plugin v4.2.21) and the healthcheck plugin (plugin-jira v1.0.2 previously jira-healthcheck-plugin) does not use the \"useSystemProperties()\" method when building the HttpClient.  This prevents the keystore being loaded in needed for client authentication.  (Apparently the truststore is loaded in regardless, but that is a separate issue.)\r\n\r\nDue to this, when the server tries to authenticate back to itself it does not provide it's certificate and the connection is rejected.  Therefore you get the \"__MSG_gadget.activity\" gadget names and invalid baseurl message from the health check plugin.\r\n\r\nI have seen similar issues on Atlassian's website on how to fix this issue, but none pointing to this solution.  Typically it refers to a misconfiguration of the server Jira is deployed on which is not the case here.  Would like to request this fix be applied to these classes where the HttpClientBuilder is used.\r\n\r\nh3. *Proposed Fix:*\r\n\r\nAfter taking down the two jar source files and inserting the line:\r\n\r\nhttpClientBuilder.useSystemProperties();\r\n\r\nAfter line 77 (where the httpClientBuilder is intialized) in the com.atlassian.troubleshooting.jira.healthcheck.support.BaseUrlHealthCheck  class.\r\n\r\nand After line 104 (where the httpClientBuilder is intialized) in the com.atlassian.gadgets.renderer.internal.http.HttpClientFetcher class.\r\n\r\nand then repackaging and redeploying the jars to our server, everything is fixed.  \r\n\r\n",
