I found the following thread on the web:\r\n\r\nhttp://osdir.com/ml/java.jira.user/2004-11/msg00338.html\r\n\r\nBut the comments by the Jira person are vague, at best, and a specific workaround example would really be appreciated.  I've been involved in QA for almost 20 years and in that time I've never been at a company, large or small, whose bug tracking tool didn't support default QA contact by component (or similar notion).

      "description": "I am sure I have seen a very similar request already, but I can't find it anywhere so sorry if this is a duplicate. We are finding the workflow system very limiting when it comes to setting the assignee of an issue. Sometimes users need the ability to override the default assignee. You are stuck with either having to go with whomever the system tells you (and without extensions that capability is very limited (in particular because of JRA-5496)), or having to select from a list of all assignable users.\r\n\r\nThere are several ways to address this issue:\r\n* Make workflow assignement conditional: only use the workflow to set the assignee when a user doesn't select \"automatic or unassigned\".\r\n* Better: provide a pre-workflow function. This gives users the option to set the assignee before the transition screen appears. So for example, set the assignee to the reporter when an issue is resolved so that the reporter appears in the Resolved Issue screen, but give the user the opportunity to change that selection.\r\n",

The application is great but it lacks a few things that were crutial to our organization: \r\n\r\n1- ability to represent user story with their associated tasks, bugs etc on a hierarchical representation\r\n2- ability to sum-up the efforts of all tasks, bugs etc for any given user story\r\n3- ability to have consolidated efforts at the sprint level\r\n\r\nSo we decided to create our own Excel based client (see page 2 of attachment). That client was pulling its data directly from the SQL Server DB which creates all sort of problems. \r\n\r\nI am rewriting the tool using Jira SOAP API which is great but I couldn't find anything related to issue linking in the current version of the SOAP API.

If the system look and feel uses dark controls with light text (e.g. the Darklooks theme in Fedora), then the form components are still dark in Jira, but the text is set to black. This makes the input forms really hard to use as black text on a dark gray background isn't really easy to read.\r\n\r\nSee attached screenshots.\r\n\r\nProposed solution:\r\nWherever input form controls have their font color explicitly set (in CSS or HTML), the background color should also be set. Alternatively: Don't set the foreground color of input form controls at all (and leave it to the system look and feel),",

For seperation of duties reasons, no matter the persons security group, etc they should not be allowed to both make the fix and also verify it via user acceptance testing.\r\n\r\n",
