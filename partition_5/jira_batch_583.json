      "description": "h3. Summary\r\nUnder high load, there could be performance degradation of requests using {{CachingOfBizPropertyEntryStore}} cache while loading the data and populating the values. This is due to contention in cache internals. {{CachingOfBizPropertyEntryStore}} is used a cache for {{propertyentry}} table. If DB performance is low, that affects loading the values into the cache, increasing the contention. \r\n\r\nh3. Environment\r\n* Datacenter \r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Apply high load to put {{CachingOfBizPropertyEntryStore}} cache under pressure.\r\n# Start updating different elements of the cache (some examples):\r\n#* Update user locale\r\n#* Last login time (see JRASERVER-70468)\r\n#* Dismissed banners \r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nREAD and UPDATE operations for a different part of the cache (different keys) can run concurrently without blocking each other. \r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nREAD and UPDATE operations for a different part of the cache (different keys) both in WAITING state waiting for the same lock (in the same stripe). So updates are blocking reads for other keys.   \r\n\r\n \r\nh3. Notes\r\nA typical symptom of the problem: \r\n* Large (majority) of the threads are waiting while executing {{CachingOfBizPropertyEntryStore.resolve}} \r\n* at the same time and same lock:\r\n** Updates on some elements of the cache in {{CachingOfBizPropertyEntryStore.setEntry}} method. \r\n*** (i) Updates from other nodes from cluster add to the contentions, eg:\r\n{noformat}\r\n[c.a.j.c.distribution.localq.LocalQCacheOpReader] LocalQCacheOp{cacheName='com.atlassian.jira.propertyset.CachingOfBizPropertyEntryStore.cache', action=REMOVE, key=CacheKey[entityName=ApplicationUser,entityId=16782], value=null, creationTimeInMillis=1561687285335} \r\n{noformat}\r\n** or loading cache in {{CachingOfBizPropertyEntryStore.loadPropertySetData}}.

      "description": "h3. Problem Definition\r\n\r\nJira Datacenter uses _EHCache_ as a cache implementation with a local wrapper {{LoadingCache}} (com.atlassian.cache.ehcache.LoadingCache), which is configured by default with a low number of stripes (mutexes).\r\n\r\nIn some cases, we see a very large contention inside the cache due to cross locking of different keys in the same stripe of the cache.\r\n * Due to low number of stripes (64) there is a high chance of collision in the same stripe for large caches.\r\n * End-users observed a performance degradation. Response time spikes are accumulated because of threads are waiting and not being able to utilize the hardware during that time.\r\n\r\n+Details+:\r\n * EhCache protects cache consistency by having a read/write lock for data per stripe (segment). It\u2019s not as granular as by keys (!)\r\n * Reads/Writes to the same stripe will share the same lock, so reads for Key-A might be blocked by writes for Key-B if they are in the same segment.\r\n * In Atlassian cache wrapper we have 64 stripes. The default number of stripes in EhCache is 2048 (DEFAULT_NUMBER_OF_MUTEXES) which will allow higher concurrency and low chance of collision.\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nIncrease number of stripes (NUMBER_OF_MUTEXES).\r\n\r\nRelated code from {{net.sf.ehcache.concurrent.StripedReadWriteLockSync#getSyncForKey}}\r\n{code:java}\r\n /**\r\n     * The default number of locks to use. Must be a power of 2.\r\n     * <p/>\r\n     * The choice of 2048 enables 2048 concurrent operations per cache or cache store, which should be enough for most\r\n     * uses.\r\n     */\r\n    public static final int DEFAULT_NUMBER_OF_MUTEXES = 2048;\r\n    private final ReadWriteLockSync[] mutexes;\r\n...\r\n{code}\r\nSee related - [https://ecosystem.atlassian.net/browse/CACHE-234]\r\nh3.

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-73683].\r\n{panel}\r\nh3. Issue Summary\r\n\r\nChrome version 80 is set to ship in February 2020. With this release there are some new cookie security features coming that will force Chrome clients to enforce a SameSite check policy. Right now, this policy would break all the functionality of issue collectors that appear on separate domains.\r\n If the issue collector could set the SameSite=None in the cookie it appears that it could at least allow the issue collectors to work on different sites.\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Inside a Chrome browser, go to address of chrome://flags and find entry called 'SameSite by default cookies' change this from default to Enabled (this feature is expected to ship in official Chrome 80 version on by default, hence this is something we should look to support, even if this specific version is not yet officially supported).\r\n # Then in my Jira Cloud site, I created a new issue collector\r\n # Copy the javascript of the issue collector and enter it into a site on a different domain\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nIssue collector works as expected.\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nIssue collector does not work. When the user click the expand button, they are presented with an error asking them to enable 3rd party cookies\r\n\r\n!issuecollectorChromeSamesite.png|thumbnail!\r\n{code:java}\r\nWe noticed that you have third-party cookies disabled in your browser.

Notes:\r\n\r\nThis feature can be enabled on most modern versions of Chrome such as 79.0.3945.117 (my current version) and also within Canary versions such as Version 81.0.4029.0 (Official Build) canary (64-bit). \r\n The expectation though is that Chrome will implement this feature as on by default when a stable version of v80 is released.

Suggested Solution\r\nAdd option to configure automation (service) user account which has fewer actions during login (auth):\r\n* Doesn't update Login counter for every successful login (possibly every X requests)\r\n* Doesn't update LastLoginTime for every login\r\n* Doesn't update user attributes from LDAP for every login (example {{updateUserFromRemoteDirectory}} method) \r\n\r\n+Possible solution:+\r\nOAuth 2.0 authorization via tokenization should allow for users to self generate a token in order to provide a secure and easy way to integrate their apps at a project level. Tokens should be associated with the corresponding user account limiting permission to the platform based upon the user's access.\r\n \r\nh3. Note\r\nMake sure that service account doesn't have Jira Admin privileges. In addition to having a security risk, it also has an extra performance overhead due to processing {{removeDismissFlagForUser}}.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround \r\nTry to avoid _Basic authentication_ for each REST API call, instead try to use _cookie-based authentication_ \r\n\r\nThis is how cookie-based authentication works in Jira at a high level:\r\n* The client creates a new session for the user via the Jira REST API.\r\n* Jira returns a session object that has information about the session including the session cookie. The client stores this session object.\r\n* The client can now set the cookie in the header for all subsequent requests to the Jira REST API. \r\n\r\nMore details: https://developer.atlassian.com/server/jira/platform/cookie-based-authentication/",

If a Jira issue key is added or removed from a Subversion log message after-the-fact, and the revprops for that revision are re-scanned in Fisheye to pull in those changes, Fisheye updates appropriately, but Jira does not always update appropriately. \r\n\r\nh3.

Users who have connected to LSAs prior to this date will be able to continue using them until usage of all LSAs is turned off.\u00a0\r\n * *After February 15, 2021 -*\u00a0Access to LSAs will be turned off for all G Suite accounts.\u00a0{quote}\r\nCould you please let me know your plan about this?",

Basically, my idea is that any issue returned by the {color:#de350b}_inverse_{color} issue filter would be excluded from the Plan, even if it would've otherwise been included based on the other Issue Sources in the plan. This would make creation of plans from large, messy projects (especially those migrated from other systems such as Rally) much easier because users would no longer need to manually find and exclude old, never completed \"junk\" from the Plan as long as they could wite JQL that would return them.",

This can be a taxing process to do as Project Import requires the [many pre-requisites|https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiraserver/restoring-a-project-from-backup-938847691.html#Restoringaprojectfrombackup-prepareJIRAPreparingyourtargetJirainstance] to meet.\r\n\r\nIn a situation where a deleted project was from 30 days ago and Jira has gone through a number of changes (scheme cleanup, plugin updates), the Project Import to restore won't be as smooth. Work has to be done to restore the old XML Backup to a temporary instance, set it up, then create a new XML backup to be used to Project Import to Jira.\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n* Option 1: \"Delete Project\" action to archive the project for 90 days (or configurable X days) before deleting the project from Jira\r\n* Option 2: \"Delete Project\" action will _only_ appear on Archived projects\r\n* Option 3: (Works with Server) \"Delete Project\" to have Trash bin with retention policy\r\n \r\nh3. Workaround \r\nThe only way to recover a deleted project is to use Project Import feature from an XML backup.",
