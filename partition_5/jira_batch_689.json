Summary\r\nCreating too many issue security issues can create some serious performance issues within JIRA. Limit or at least warning the customer that they are about to run into this issue when creating more than the recommend number of Issue Security Levels within the product could prevent customers from making an implementation decision that causes negative performance impacts within their environment and a poor experience of JIRA.\r\n\r\nh3. Environment\r\nJIRA + Many Issue Security Levels.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Create Many Issue Security Levels as per: [Configuring Issue-level Security|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Configuring+Issue-level+Security]\r\n# Exceed the recommended limit of ten Issue Security Levels.\r\n# Observe degradation of JIRA performance as a result of this.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nWe should _at least_ warn the customer that using too many issue security levels will potentially impact JIRA performance, and if possible implement both soft and hard limits on the number of issue security levels that can be created. There could also be the possibility of allowing these values to be set with flags so that the limitation can be knowingly breached. \r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nThe current implementation relies on customers reading the recent versions of the Documentation that highlight this performance issue. This doesn't work for a few reasons:\r\n- Users that are 'old hat' or confident with the product functionality might not consult the documentation.\r\n- User that have implemented one or two issue security levels, my erroneously think the feature can support many more levels without consulting the documentation\r\n- Users that are finding the functionality might not consult the documentation.\r\n",

Summary\r\n\r\nWhen the Issue Navigator is loaded, it makes a call to the favourite filter resource, e.g.: https://jira.atlassian.com/rest/api/2/filter/favourite. {{FilterResource.getFavouriteFilters}} is currently inefficient such that it performs a lookup to retrieve every single user which is unnecessary and causes performance problems.\r\n\r\nh3.

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-44234].\n  {panel}\n\nHello,\r\nToday, even with the recent JIRA version it\u2019s not easy and safe to operate a change of Labels in bulk mode: When your items are tagged with several various labels - which labels are made for-  it can be really risky to update them in bulk because you may overwrite some existing labels with your new one. In order to avoid that, you have no choice but doing the update operation by groups of items that have identical labels values.\r\n\r\nIllustrating with a simple example:\r\nLet say you have the 3 following JIRA items (of course real use cases involve more issues) tagged with these labels: \r\n\r\n* Item J-XX2:    Labels= [ADEPT][Cont.Delivery][Quikwin]\r\n* Item J-XX13:  Labels=[ADEPT]\r\n* Item J-XX27:  Labels= [ADEPT] [PP] [Quikwin]\r\n* \u2026\r\n\r\n\u2026 and say you need to tag these [ADEPT] items with an additional label [Candidate].\r\nWell, currently you just can\u2019t use the bulk mode for that and update these 3 items in one operation. (As you would necessarily overwrite existing labels values). What you need to do then is to identify items with similar labels and bulk edit them, retyping the existing labels plus the one that you need to add... Quite painful not to say hazardous in practice.\r\n\r\nSo I'm thinking it would really empower the Labelling feature in JIRA, if we could simply append or remove a label value on a selection of issues (no matter the various labels actually set currently for each one of these)\r\n\r\nThanks for considering this suggestion.\r\nStephane\r\n",

Problem Definition\r\nIn a few aspects of JIRA e.g. User Profile menu (my JIRA home, logout menu items), the atl_token is appended to the URL and propagated using GET method.\r\n\r\n_Sensitive information such as token will travel as part of URL when using GET. This information will be stored in browser cache and server logs. This information will be available for unauthorized disclosure through various methods such as shoulder surfing, shared machines or accessing server logs. Additionally, URLs information can get leaked out using referrer header when an external link is accessed via the application._\r\n\r\nh3.

Often these tasks relate directly to a JIRA ticket.  It would be very convenient to have an easy way to view all Confluence tasks that relate to this or that JIRA ticket within said ticket (rather than creating a link manually in the Confluence document, and then clicking on the resulting link in JIRA to see if there were any tasks that relate to the JIRA ticket).\r\n\r\nMaybe this could involve a specialized Confluence Macro, identifying a JIRA ticket that will display all the tasks in the Confluence page (with the ability to check said tasks in the JIRA ticket), as well as link type in JIRA that would identify individual Confluence records whose tasks will be brought into the JIRA ticket.\r\n\r\nFinally, it would be good to have a separate area for Confluence tasks within the JIRA ticket - maybe something like the areas for the lists of linked tickets and sub-tasks that are currently found in JIRA tickets.\r\n\r\nI created a ticket in the Confluence project for this functionality -  [https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONF-38209] for this functionality.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nDaniel.\r\n\r\n",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-44186].\n  {panel}\n\nHi,\r\n\r\nCurrently, sub-tasks can only be filtered by 'Show Open' or 'Show All'. I would like to request that we can filter the tasks if a string in the sub-task title matches the filter.\r\n\r\nFor example, where I work, I work on tickets for fixing website bugs. This part of the QA process. There's a master ticket labelled \"Client Name QA\", and then there are sub-tasks for each QA bug.\r\n\r\nThe sub tasks are named with their relevant department, and the issue, like so:\r\n\r\nPM - blah blah\r\nCSS - Blah blah\r\nDev - Blah Blah\r\n\r\nMe, handling tasks for CSS, would only like to see the ones relevant to me, so I think it would be beneficial that I could only show subtasks which have CSS in the title.\r\n\r\nSo the logical way of seeing it would be something like: If 'title' contains 'CSS', display, else hide. I know it's not that simple, but that's where I'm getting at!\r\n\r\nThanks in advance guys,\r\nAsh",

Expected Results\r\nIssues where the custom field is not filled in or not present will show up first and then the issues where the custom field is filled in.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nThe issues created in the project where the custom field is not present show up first. Then the issues from the other project where the custom field is project. Lastly issues from the project where the custom field is present but is not filled in. See attached screenshot.\r\n \r\n\r\nh3.Workaround\r\nThere is no workaround at this time but for now you could order by another field in your searches if possible. ",

By choosing 'Update' the user will be overwriting the changes made by the other user. Fields that were empty but have since been filled are emptied again.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce ( Example scenario )\r\n# At 10:00 am User A opens the edit screen for an issue and but gets called to a meeting. He leaves the issue in the edit screen view. \r\n# At 10:30 am User B opens the same issue, fills in the Description & Label field then clicks on Update.\r\n# At 11:00 am User A returns to her computer, alters only the description field but leaves the label field empty and clicks on Update.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nUser A should get some kind of warning or notification that the values of the issue has been changed of that the new values will be merged with the values entered by User B ( something like how Confluence works )\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nChanges made by User A overwrites changes made by User B without any knowledge of both the users. The description field now only has values from User A and the label field  is now empty.\r\n \r\nh3. Notes\r\n\r\nh3.Workaround\r\nReducing the [default timeout session|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRAKB/How+to+change+the+default+session+timeout] was suggested but not really  feasible",

You need to be much more explicit about the automatic renewal being only the automatic taking of the renewal fee, and that a manual process to update the licence keys is still required. Better still, the products could provide some centralised control of applying the licence keys so that this can be done from one place, via one login. Even better still would be to provide a method of validating the licences which does not require copy and paste or button pressing.\r\n{quote}",
