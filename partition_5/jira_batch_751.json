The script consists of just one thread which logs into the application (once at the beginning of the script) and opens an issue (always the same issue, an easy one with no subtasks, no links, ...) every 30 seconds\r\n\r\nUntil today I was using my own jira user to run the test. My jira user is not admin but is in a lot of roles, groups, etc. But today I had to send the script to a colleague  at another city and created an internal user with the minimal permissions needed to log in and browse the issue\r\n\r\nThe surprise is that the performance difference is amazing from using one user to the other. \u00bfIs this the expected behavior?",

If one edits a version to set a Release date, it displays that date as MMM/dd/yyyy (at least for us Americans). But if one later selects the gear to the right and requests to mark the version as Released, the date is still supplied as MMM/dd/yyyy, which is considered to be an incorrect format. Nevertheless, the system fully understands the meaning of that date. If one clicks on the calendar icon, it knows what date is meant. If one then clicks on that date in the calendar, it is rewritten in the expected acceptable format. So the code understands the date, but it still makes the human go through extra steps to get it into a format that it prefers over the original format that it supplied itself. The inconsistency is in the code and unnecessary. (Optional side observation: Why don't you consider storing/processing dates using the clear international standard of yyyy/mm/dd, which is unambiguous and sorts correctly even as text?)",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-35620].\n  {panel}\n\nWhen you have a lot of shared code, the same bug/issue may come up on multiple products if that bug/new feature is in a shared library.  \r\n\r\nCurrently, there we have to Clone and then Move an issue to a new project.  This is very tedious, time consuming and prone to human error/forgetfulness.\r\n\r\nOne idea would be to add extra fields that link an issue to other projects and keep track of the {{Fix Version/s:}} for that other project.  When you click Resolve issue, it could prompt you to fill in the Fix Version for the other projects, too, although that could be delayed as well.\r\n\r\nThe trick is having that issue show up in other projects queries as if it were a first-class issue in those projects.\r\n\r\nAnother idea is to add a special \"Clone in other Project\" action that creates the new issue in the other project and tracks it as described above.  This could be as simple as adding a choice of what Project to put a Clone into on the Clone action window.  This would at least collapse the Clone and then Move actions into one action which would be a start, assuming the cloned bug is linked strongly to the original issue.\r\n\r\n(Note: we use JIRA OnDemand - so it should work there too)",

I decided to raise it as a Minor bug because of the unexpected results that it could cause as explained below:\r\n* This can screw up statistics in a couple of ways as JIRA doesn't always treat each of this labels as unique. A JQL query involving any of this cases (e.g labels = Abc) will return all issues containing either Abc or AbC or ABC or abc. The problem with this is that, in a case where a user tried to create a label abc which he did not intend to be or mean the same as another acronym ABC (especially when he is not aware of that existing label with a seperate casing), the entire data appears to be mixed up when retrieving issues with the label.\r\n   ",

However, the description field is the most beneficial field to persist to the new issue because there may be even a single sentence or line in the description that you will want to keep.  It takes only 3 key presses (CTRL+A, Del) to clear the entire contents of a description field.  However, to re-type even a single line, sentence, paragraph, or something as long as reproduction steps would take an exponentially more amount of time.\r\n\r\nThis should definitely be changed back to allow the description field to persist especially since you made the \"Feature Change\" as a \"Bug\" in a previous minor release without properly notifying your users or administrators of the change. The change enacted by the bug should have never been classified as a bug due to the original feature implementation of the \"create another\" checkbox. By definition it was put in place to aid in the creation of a new issue by persisting fields, but the responsibility is still on the reporter to review ALL fields for relevance to the new issue being created. Therefore, it should have been a feature enhancement or new feature.\r\n\r\nThere was mention to statistics or analytics that were used to make the decision in the \"Bug\" that removed this functionality.  I would like to see these analytics that you are referring to. Were the analytics based solely on if the description field was changed or if the description field was 100% different from the previous description? That right there would make a huge difference in how to proceed with this feature. If just parts of the description were different from the previous one, then it should not be cleared, but if your analytics show that the description was completely changed each time, then i would agree that it should probably be cleared.  Also, where were these \"analytics\" captured?  If they were only on your OnDemand solution, that is most likely more of your newer customers and smaller companies that don't have the resources to house an on-premise solution.  All of your older customers and larger companies are more than likely still using on-premise solutions and aren't going to upgrade to every version.  Now that you are up to 6.1.2, you will see more larger companies starting to migrate from version 5, and therefore more companies are going to notice this change and also complain.\r\n\r\nHowever, if we follow through on this logic and boil it down to the essence of why the description field should be cleared, the underlying reason is that the user has to review the field and make any necessary changes to fit the new issue. If you use that reasoning, then it would mean that you should be clearing ALL fields for the new issue because then that would force the user to review every field and make the necessary changes.\r\n\r\nYou need to either persist all fields and put the responsibility on the reporter that they will review all fields and make changes as needed for the new issue, or eliminate the confusion and clear all fields back to defaults when using the \"create another\" checkbox, thus forcing the user to re-evaluate all fields and set them accordingly.\r\n\r\nAn alternative method to make this into a true Improvement would be to change the behavior to persist ALL fields, but give the flexibility to specify which fields should not be persistent between issue creations.  I can think of other fields which would benefit more from being cleared than the description field, such as the Priority field, or any other business critical Custom Field that an organization has implemented.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you have any questions regarding this.  If needed, i can instruct my entire company to log into this issue, vote for it, and comment on it describing how much they all use this feature, and how much this change is affecting their workflow and causing them to waste more time during issue creations.",

[See the corresponding bug report|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-35578].\n  {panel}\n\nThere are *{color:red}2 issues{color}* that appear to be going on here....\r\n\r\nh4.The 1st issue - Remaining Estimates (Create an Issue)\r\nWhen I create a new or edit an Issue, and I try to set the Remaining Estimates to \"Leave Estimates Unset\", the radio button for Leave Estimates Unset is chosen.  However when I go to log work, I am getting an error that states 'Remaining Estimates is Invalid\".  \r\n\r\nIf I go back into the edit mode of the Issue to see if my setup is still set on Leave Estimates Unset, I see that is has changed to Adjust automatically.  It is not saving my choice selection.\r\n\r\nh4. The 2nd issue - Log Work\r\nWhen I choose the Log Work and I make my entries into the pop-up box, if I put \"0\" in the Remaining Estimates field, they system auto changes that entry to display \"N/A\".  \r\n\r\nHowever, if I delete the N/A and reenter the \"0\" again, they system takes  that entry and I am able to log work.  Is this a current bug issue or does this currently work this way?\r\n??This appears as a bug with a workaround to remove the N/A and enter the \"0\" or whatever value to be able to proceed further.??\r\n\r\n??{color:blue}This does not matter is I config my screen to display the log time fields when a user creates an Issue or not{color}??",
