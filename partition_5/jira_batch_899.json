The plugins do not have to have been used for the leak to occur. There is not a one-one correspondence to restarts and leaks however (we generally see about 6 dead plugin systems although 30 or more restarts may have occured).\r\n\r\nIn the process of diagnosing this we have tracked down and removed every possible reference to a large section of memory (a plugin framework) that we could find. Starting with all strong references and proceeding to remove soft and weak references - even things like clearing the java.lang.reflect.Proxy cache - and even Finalizer references until YourKit, Eclipse MAT, JProfiler and jhat profilers all report that the memory in question is dead and should be collectable, but inexplicably _the JVM still holds on to it_. There are no JNI Global references either, yet this memory remains uncollectable!\r\n\r\nThis happens on all JVMs we have tried so far, which are the 1.5 and 1.6 JVMs on Linux and Mac, and the IBM 1.6 JDK on Linux.\r\n\r\nIn practice this doesn't hurt a standard JIRA customer as a full system import is generally a one-off operation. It seriously affects runs of our functional test suite.\r\n\r\nThis is [a JVM GC bug (4957990)|http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=4957990]. No known memory analysis tool can find the heap root (i.e. according to \"the rules\" there is no heap root). Are there any known GC memory leaks caused by ClassLoaders being dropped for instance?\r\n\r\nThe application is creating and disposing a lot of ClassLoaders via OSGi (Apache Felix) with Spring OSGi. It creates a lot of java.lang.reflect.Proxy class instances.\r\n\r\nStrictly speaking this is *not actually a memory leak* as the additional memory use is bounded - memory use does not go up forever.",

In the latter case only a 'Issue Assigned' Notification is being sent. \r\n\r\nThis confuses users in pour scenario. \r\n\r\nI think it would be an improvement to also sent an 'Issue Commented' Notification in this case.\r\n\r\nIf you think this would be over the top (too much), you could select those recipients for the 'Issue Commented' notification if they didn't already receive the 'Issue assigned' mail (which includes the new comment already). You could also add the recicipients from the 'notification scheme-issue commented' to the recipients of the 'Issue Assigned' Notificiation mail, but this could cause confusion because of the e-mail subject.\r\n\r\nPlease share your thoughts on this.",
