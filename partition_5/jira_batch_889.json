The output lists the resolution for all unresolved issues as \"UNRESOLVED\".\r\n\r\nIf you save the excel output to a CSV file and import it into JIRA, the \"UNRESOLVED\" resolution is not recognized for what it is.\r\n\r\nIf you make the mistake of adding an \"UNRESOLVED\" resolution, the imported issues won't show up on the project reports.  This happens because the project component and version reports on the project home page expect the resolution to be set to null rather than \"UNRESOLVED\".\r\n\r\nThe workaround is to map that resolution to \"Import as Blank\" manually.\r\n\r\nGiven that the information is going from our code (the excel export) to our code (the CSV import), the journey should be simpler.  As an example, during the import configuration wizard, the CSV file is parsed at least once.  That process could look for things like the \"UNRESOLVED\" resolution and suggest the necessary field mapping.\r\n\r\nAdding an in-place warning when setting up the mapping for the resolution field would be a simpler approach.\r\n\r\n",
