Instead, clicking the '*Add*' link (at the top left of the transition's 'Conditions' tab) simply adds your individual condition to the outermost grouped condition.\r\n\r\nThis makes it cumbersome to add an individual condition _independently_ of the outermost grouped condition and then switch the logic of this individual condition (_independently_ of the outermost grouped condition).\r\n\r\nFor example, I have an outermost grouped condition consisting of (A AND B AND C) to which I want to add the individual condition D.\r\n\r\nAfter using the '*Add*' link to add D, I get '(A AND B AND C AND D)' - not '(A AND B AND C) AND D'.\r\n\r\n*Why is this distinction important?* Because if I wanted to switch the logic of the original grouped condition only, I'd get '(A OR B OR C OR D)' - not '(A OR B OR C) AND D', the latter of which:\r\n* is intuitively what I'd intended\r\n* would be a valid (complex) condition.\r\n\r\nTo get the latter (complex) condition, I'd have to do the following - assuming I'm starting with the grouped condition (A AND B AND C):\r\n# Click the '*Add grouped condition*' link (against A) to add B and C to A, so I get ((A AND B AND C) AND B AND C).\r\n# Click the '*Add*' link at the top-left (or the outermost group's '*Add condition to group*' link) to add D to the outermost group, which gives me ((A AND B AND C) AND B AND C AND D).\r\n# Click the '*Delete*' link (against B and C in the outermost group) to remove B and C from the outermost group, which finally gives me ((A AND B AND C) AND D).\r\n# I can then go ahead and switch the logic of the internal group to give me ((A OR B OR C) AND D).\r\n\r\nThis is an unnecessarily complex set of steps to generate this fairly straightforward complex condition.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nTo resolve this issue, the '*Add*' link at the top-left (mentioned in step 2 above) should always add individual conditions that are 'external to' the outermost group. *Reason?* - you can always add D to an outermost group (A AND B AND C) using the '*Add condition to group*' link.\r\n",

The custom field context allows your custom field to be configured differently for numerous different combinations of issue types and projects. For example, your custom field could have *different default values for different projects (and/or issue types).*\r\n\r\nI want to emphasize the _*(and/or issue types)*_. This seems to imply that you can set multiple default values within the same project for different issue types.\r\n\r\nAfter some testing, I found that once you have selected and configured a specific project/issue type combination, you cannot select that same project again for editing.  This means that you cannot set the 'different values' for a different set of issue types within that same project.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n* I have the project 'ape planet' and want to create a custom select field with values A, B, C for the 'Bug' issue type and values 1, 2, 3 for the 'Improvement' issue type of this project.\r\n* As shown below I did the following:\r\n** Created the new custom field select type, selecting 'Bug' and 'ape planet' context.\r\n** I then clicked 'Add new context' to now configure the 'Improvement' issue type, but I find that 'ape planet' project can no longer be selected.",

A Clickjacking attack is similar to CSRF in which attacker can hijack a \"click\" on a web application from another \"invisible\" frame in the browser. Essentially, an attacker can force a user to click on a button that is invisible to him/her.\r\n\r\nExploit Scenario: An attacker crafts a malicious page such that when their victim clicks, they are actually clicking on the link or button in the vulnerable application hosted in an iframe. Thus, an attacker tricks the user into performing an action of the attacker's choosing by directing mouse input to the target application.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nApplying an additional header to the Apache HTTP server can mitigate this problem. Specifically using the SAMEORIGIN setting. If the header contains the SAMEORIGIN option, the response will be loaded within a frame only if the parent page is from the same origin.\r\n\r\nFor Apache:\r\n# Add this to your {{httpd.conf}} file:\r\n{code}\r\nHeader always append X-Frame-Options SAMEORIGIN\r\n{code}\r\n# Ensure the headers module is enabled, the below is required in {{httpd.conf}}, or if using Ubuntu/Debian {{a2enmod headers}} will turn it on.\r\n{code}\r\nLoadModule headers_module modules/mod_headers.so\r\n{code}\r\n# Restart Apache.\r\n\r\nNote that this is not a panacea for clickjacking. SAMEORIGIN should be safe to use and not provide any negative side-effects.\r\n\r\n(!) SAMEORIGIN will prevent the Issue Collector from loading when embedded in a Confluence page ",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-25122].\n  {panel}\n\nWhen upgrading from JIRA 4.0.2 to 4.3.3 the JIRA database upgrade process that is run on first startup performs four separate reindex operations, all four of which are extraneous for a typical upgrade and incur many hours of critical down time for large JIRA instances.  Due to the fact that JIRA upgrades often involve admin-level changes that are going to require a manual re-index to be performed anyway, it is unnecessary for JIRA to perform a reindex at all as part of the database upgrade process, and it is definitely unnecessary for it to perform 4 of them.  Please optimize this so at most one (optional) reindex is performed during the upgrade process.\r\n\r\nTo work around this problem we removed the jira.option.indexing row from the propertyentry table in the JIRA database before starting the upgraded version of JIRA for the first time.  After the upgrade is complete, go to Administration->Indexing in the JIRA interface and click \"Activate\" to re-add this row to the database and manually begin the reindexing process.  Using this procedure resulted in a 50-minute upgrade process instead of nearly 5 hours.  Your mileage may vary, but we did not notice any problems created by using this procedure.\r\n\r\nPlease also update the JIRA documentation to note that the jira.option.indexing parameter in jira-application.properties no longer performs any function in an unmodified JIRA instance.  (This setting in jira-application.properties is always overridden by the database entry, if present.)\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\n(i) This only applies for instances pre 5.0 and should only ever be required if upgrading from a version of JIRA prior to 4.0 (e.g.: a two-step from 3.13.x to 4.4.5). Otherwise upgrading to the most recent version will contain this improvement.\r\n\r\n# Disable the indexing:\r\n{code:SQL}\r\nUPDATE propertynumber ps, \r\n       propertyentry pe \r\nSET    ps.propertyvalue = 0 \r\nWHERE  pe.id = ps.id \r\n       AND pe.entity_name = 'jira.properties' \r\n       AND pe.propertytype = 1 \r\n       AND pe.property_key = 'jira.option.indexing'\r\n{code}\r\n# Complete the upgrade and test.\r\n# Re-enable the argument:\r\n{code:SQL}\r\nUPDATE propertynumber ps, \r\n       propertyentry pe \r\nSET    ps.propertyvalue = 1\r\nWHERE  pe.id = ps.id \r\n       AND pe.entity_name = 'jira.properties' \r\n       AND pe.propertytype = 0 \r\n       AND pe.property_key = 'jira.option.indexing'\r\n{code}",

In other words, there appears to be no validation based on *Step Name (id)* in the VWD.\r\n\r\nThis has two effects:\r\n* When you attempt to delete the duplicate step you added, JIRA returns a service error (detailed in the comment below).\r\n* You'll end up with two steps in the workflow steps editor with identical *Step Name (ids)*, which this editor would have prevented.\r\n",
