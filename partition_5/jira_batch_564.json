Use browser's PDF viewer\r\n* Right click and 'Open in new tab/window'. This causes it to use the browser's PDF viewer and not the one built into Jira.\r\n\r\nh3. Note from users\r\nCredit to [~26325d6c4916] \r\n{quote}\r\nThe issue seems to occur whenever fonts where used in the PDF that are not embedded within the file itself.\r\nThis provides two solutions (we could think of) that need to be considered when generating PDFs:\r\n\r\nMake sure the software that embeds PDFs embeds the fonts within the file.\r\nAlternatively: The PDF shouldn't contain any actual text but just paths - however, this likely makes Text unselectable.\r\n{quote}\r\nand [~640024a5d536]\r\n{quote}\r\nI did some extensive research on this. Pdf's earlier than Version 1.5 use the accessibility plugin (Adobe) which was deactivated somewhere in May this year after 20 years being EOL. One of the things this plugin provided was supply fonts and formats to PDF viewing software.\r\nThere were two ways this plugin could be used in a program: Embed it in your own (small piece of code/library) or call the weblink provided by Adobe (which downloads this plugin every time again).\r\n\r\nProgrammers who would spare some bytes of code or were simply lazy implemented the last option. \r\nAlthough Adobe announced the EOL and also announced the deactivation of the weblink, programmers forgot about the implementation in their software and never fixed it. \r\n\r\nThat is why PDF's V1.4 and lower don't render the Fonts any more when software is using the second option.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, complaining about this, at Atlassian, I found out that Atlassian doesn't feel responsible for this because there is a Workaround (saving and opening the PDF, so not using the preview from Jira for PDF's < Version 1.5 and replacing the PDF with a higher Version).\r\n\r\n Note:  PDF Version 1.5 (maybe V1.6 too, but could not find documentation about that) still implemented the new and the old way to render Fonts, so therefore, depending on the software  the PDF was created with, used the old  way and doesn't render, but as I found out, the most programs switched to the new way.\r\n{quote}\r\n",

Problem Definition\r\n\r\nWe need a better solution to manage the sorting order of statuses.\r\n\r\nWhen Jira has a great number of Statuses (+100) it is very time-consuming to manage the order of each status that relates to different projects and workflows one by one.\r\n\r\nAs this reflects directly on filters and JQL this order can be very important.\r\n\r\nWhen working with several projects and different teams, managing this order can be very confusing and quickly get out of hand.\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\nAbility to change the status order in JQL filter results based on which project is associated with the filter itself.\r\n\r\n",

Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n# Setup a [Jira Data Center with 2 or more nodes|https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiraserver/installing-jira-data-center-938846870.html]\r\n# Add two entries in the /etc/hosts file with both external and internal IP mappings, for example:{code}\r\n172.20.40.245 node01\r\n127.0.0.1 node01\r\n{code}\r\nThe reason for this behavior is a duplicate entry in the etc/hosts file containing an external and internal IP causing a loop.\r\n The problem can be explained as follows:\r\n * Each node uses its own hostname to communicate with each other\r\n * In case of duplicated entries in the hosts file, the hostname is resolved to the loopback IP 127.0.1.1\r\n * Due to this, master detects that 127.0.1.1 is trying to communicate with it, and it recognizes that IP as itself instead of secondary\r\n * The same happens to the secondary node\r\n * So basically the nodes are not able to communicate with each other and end up in a loop\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nProvide more details about the problem with the error message. ie, any indication of the host communication failure or loop.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nThe error messages are generic and offer no indication that the hostname has a localhost address and an external address just by looking at the cache replication errors alone\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nCheck /etc/hosts file for duplicated entries, for example:\r\n{code:java}\r\n127.0.1.1 ip-node-1\r\n127.0.0.1 ip-node-1\r\n{code}\r\nYou may also check:\r\n[JIRA - Only One Node Will Start in Cluster|https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirakb/jira-7-6-x-only-one-node-will-start-in-cluster-956699096.html]",

We just have not removed them from the product yet. Please move off them to the other types. The newer types are faster, support more capabilities, and you should not plan on continuing to use deprecated features whenever you can move off them. (We deprecated these in SQL 2005, so it's time to move off ;)). \u2013 Conor Cunningham MSFT Jan 11 at 14:18\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nWhile the data type is considered deprecated, Microsoft has not got around to remove them in a newer version of SQL Server. Since the removal of the data type could cause some issues, it's a good idea to switch the data type of columns currently configured with text/ntext to different data types such as nvarchar(max), varchar(max), or varbinary(max). \r\n\r\nCustomer has mentioned that changing the data type is essential because this also allows the database administrators to create the right covering index for changeitem that helps reduce the data lookup from primary key. This significantly reduces the CPU utilization in some scenarios.\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nFor MS SQL database, update the character type columns currently configured with text/ntext to  nvarchar(max) or varchar(max).\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround \r\n\r\nNone.",

      "description": "h3. Problem Definition\r\nIn Jira Server and Data Center currently the only way to get back a project via REST API is to call the GET /rest/api/2/project which returns ALL projects.  There is no means to search for projects or limit the request to only those projects that contain a specific string of text in the project name or project key.  \r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\nImplement a new REST API endpoint such as Jira Cloud has done over in https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/v3/api-group-projects/#api-rest-api-3-project-search-get\r\n\r\nWhich allows a query parameter that can match against the key or name.\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Why this is important\r\nIt can be a costly call to force the REST API to return all the project names on an environment that has a lot of projects.  Jira Cloud also has implemented this already.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround \r\nNone",

Issue Summary\r\n\r\nIt is possible to add a *User Picker Custom Field* or *Group Picker Custom Field* to Jira's Project Permissions, to have a specific set of users or groups granted permissions on an issue by issue basis.\r\n\r\nThe permissions are only granted upon saving these field values to an issue. This means that the permissions are not respected during Issue Creation, as the field value being set on the Create Issue form does not mean it has been saved yet.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n(i) We will use *Assignee* as our example, though this can apply to other permissions, such as *Reporter*\r\n\r\n # Create either a *User Picker Custom Field* or a *Group Picker Custom Field*, and associate it to all of a Project's screens\r\n # Grant the *Assignable User* project permission in the Project to either *User Picker Custom Field* or *Group Picker Custom Field* depending on which you'd like to test\r\n # During issue creation, set the custom field in question to the User or Group value that you'd like to add as an Assignee\r\n# Attempt to select an Assignee that only has permissions granted to it via the custom field\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nUsers granted the Assignable User permission via the custom field are selectable as an Assignee\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nUsers part of the User/Group Picker Custom Field cannot be selected as an Assignee\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nIssues must be created without the intended Assignee/Reporter/etc., and the *User/Group Picker Custom Field* value must be set in it's own edit operation, before the permissions are reflected on those User/Groups. The Assignee/Reporter/etc. may then be set in a separate operation afterwards.",
