      "description": "Hi All,\r\n\r\nI am experiencing an strange issue with my Minyaa plugins against JIRA 6.2.x and 6.3.x.\r\n\r\nI have just delivered after a large delay the 1st version compatible with 6.3 to 6.3.5 (not yet over :-( )\r\n\r\nAmong these plugins, I have always some V1 plugins (Be sure that I do my best to try their migration in V2 ... It is not the subject of this issue).\r\n\r\nToday, I have started to complete the migration for 6.3.6 to 6.3.8, and during some tests, I need to disable one of my plugin v1, and surprise I was not able to do it, since JIRA Plugin Manager raise the error \"org.picocontainer.PicoCompositionException: Duplicate Keys not allowed. Duplicate for 'xxxx'\".\r\n\r\nSince I did many change for this last version and mainly in pom.xml due to a newer Atlassian SDK, I have some suspiscion about some settings.\r\n\r\nBut I have finally made some tests wigth older versions ... It appears that I was not able to disable plugin V1 since JIRA 6.2.\r\n\r\nI made some search in source code and found this ....\r\n\r\nBefore 6.2, the method *ComponentModuleDescriptor.unregisterComponents()* was :\r\n{code:java}\r\n    public void unregisterComponents(final MutablePicoContainer container)\r\n    {\r\n        // Check that we have classloaded the interface if required.\r\n        if (interfaceClazzName != null && interfaceClazz == null)\r\n        {\r\n            throw new PluginException(\"Cannot unregister component '\" + interfaceClazzName + \"' in plugin '\" + getKey() +\r\n                \"' because we haven't loaded the class.

While this is generally helpful, I find myself having to frequently update the gadget to display the desired timeline.  It also includes all issue types, whereas I have a need to understand how many Defects are incoming versus New Features.\r\n\r\nRequest:  As a project manager, I would like to be able to set a start date for the chart in the gadget configuration OR use the existing number of days prior configuration.\r\n\r\nUse Case:  Our projects often have continuous testing, and I would like to be able to have a chart that shows the created/resolved defects based on the start date of a of testing for that particular project or Sprint.  To accomplish this, I would need to be able to only view created/resolved defects beginning from a defined date, not a floating date.\r\n\r\nThe ability to have that kind of quality view across multiple sprints for a given version is immensely valuable.  One of the key things I want to be able to see is the point at which the resolved tickets surpass the created tickets.  At that point I begin to have confidence that we're trending towards our completion date.  If we're halfway through our schedule for the version, and our created defects are still outpacing our resolved defects, I know I have a serious quality problem to address.",

I will not try to explain in English special rule related the usage of verb \"Avoir\" (to have) and \"Etre\" (To be), but it has also an impact on how we write adjectives.\r\n\r\nBy exemple, i18n key like \"common.filters.<adjective>\" should be translated with plural and feminine\r\n{code}\r\ncommon.filters.addedrecently=Ajout\\u00E9es r\\u00E9cemment\r\ncommon.filters.updatedrecently=Mises \\u00E0 jour r\\u00E9cemment\r\ncommon.filters.assignedtome=Qui me sont attribu\\u00E9es\r\n\r\ncommon.filters.reportedbyme=Que j''ai rapport\\u00E9s\r\ncommon.filters.unscheduled=Non planifi\\u00E9es\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nSome other is correclty translated :\r\n{code}\r\ncommon.filters.resolvedrecently=R\\u00E9solues r\\u00E9cemment\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nAnd \"common.filters.outstanding\" has been translated \"Unresolved\" like \"common.concepts.unresolved\", but due to the associated filters, where only the order differs, we shoud have a better translation ...\r\n\r\nThe term \"outstanding\" has many possible French translation in google (https://translate.google.com/#auto/fr/outstanding), but none of them express the order on Update Date.  \r\nAnd same remark for the translation of \"common.concepts.unresolved\" ... the order of the filter is not visible in the translation.\r\n\r\nWhat is sure, is that these both translation should not be the same.\r\n\r\nMy proposal would be \r\n\r\n{code}\r\ncommon.filters.outstanding=Non r\\u00E9solues et mises \\u00E0 jour r\\u00E9cemment\r\ncommon.concepts.unresolved=Non r\\u00E9solues par priorit00E9s\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nExcept these 2 last key words,the other corrections have been also proposed in https://translations.atlassian.com .\r\n\r\nRegards\r\nVincent\r\n",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-40477].\r\n{panel}\r\nh3. Problem Definition\r\n\r\nCurrently if you forward a mail as an attachment, for example using the desktop version of Microsoft Outlook or Thunderbird, it shows up in a JIRA issue as a file with no extension containing a MIME formatted file containing xhtml with MS Office's extensions. Because there is no extension, clicking on the file does not open it in the appropriate way.\r\n\r\n*Note 1*: The same issue appears to occur when we attach the msg file without using the forwarding functionality in Outlook. In this case as well, Outlook does not include the file extension in the attachment.\r\n\r\n*Note 2*: If the same mail attachment was sent to Jira via the mail web browser, the file extension exists in the original email and the .msg file can be viewed correctly.\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nAdding a check to rename such a file to be called .eml or .msg would give the necessary hint required for a mail program to successfully open such an attachment.\r\nh3. Cause\r\n\r\nAttaching an email in a client such as Gmail will provide a filename for the attachment, for example:\r\n{noformat}\r\nContent-Type: message/rfc822; name=\"test.eml\"\r\nContent-Disposition: attachment; filename=\"test.eml\"\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: base64\r\n...\r\n{noformat}\r\nAttaching an email in Outlook provides no name or filename for the attachment:\r\n{noformat}\r\nContent-type: message/rfc822\r\nContent-disposition: attachment\r\n{noformat}\r\nAs a result JIRA doesn't know what to name this file.\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n * use the\u00a0web version of Outlook\u00a0or use\u00a0another email client\u00a0(Gmail, etc)",

Is there any way to have an email send that essentially cc's everyone in the one email. i.e.: One email is sent to all users so once the email is received, user A can see that user B, user C and user D also received the mail. User A can therefore include all users on a reply.\r\n\r\nit would be good to have this as an option when sending JIRAs.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nLouise",

Now, in my organization (canope, france) we have a license for 500 users. I have to say you, the functions provide by jira to sort user are not very convenient when the number of users increase. At least, we need a simple function to sort user by activity (last connexion for example). it would be another criteria in user search function. \r\n\r\nI found the two solutions below but... the first is not convenient and the second (even if i understand the policy to promote plugin development) is not acceptable. Sort user by activity is a trivial function to manage all the accounts, specially when the panel of users increase. In my point of view this function is missing. \r\n\r\nhttps://answers.atlassian.com/questions/93421/jira-admin-sort-users-list-by-directory?utm_source=SAC&utm_medium=dashboard\r\n\r\nhttps://support.atlassian.com/customer/search?q=sort+user\r\n\r\n\r\nthat's all.

However, we have five issue types in one project and testers, legal reviewers or product managers are different users for each issue types... Would it be possible to have another level of roles at the issue type level? Inherent parent Project Role if not set?  \r\n\r\nAlso at the moment, Jira doesn't support default assignee on project roles. All users in a role are arranged alphabetically... Can we maybe allow an administrator to set the order of the list so the first in the list is the default assignee for the role? Or better yet, allow admin to set a default assignee for each Project roles (Issue Type role as well...)? ",

However, there should be some sort of functionality to remove abilities for a certain group of people, outside of a larger group.\r\n\r\nFor instance, everyone who is added to our JIRA instance is automatically added to jira-users. All jira-users have permissions to browse projects (amongst other things) in the default notification scheme. This simplifies things because users when created are always added to this group. However, there is a small group of people we don't want to give the ability to browse all projects to.\r\n\r\nIn our default permission scheme - that is assigned to fifteen projects - we allow 'jira-users' to 'browse projects', and would like to exclude one group from this list - a group have permissions to browse another project in our JIRA instance which has it's own permission scheme giving them the ability to do so.\r\n\r\nIn essence, we have a group of people we only want to give access to one project, but because they are in the 'jira-users' group, and our default scheme is based around that for convenience, they have access to all projects. So, there should be some way of excluding a group from a permission, just as there is the ability to give a group permissions.\r\n\r\nThanks",
