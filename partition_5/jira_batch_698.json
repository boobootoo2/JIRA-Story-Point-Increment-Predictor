Environment\r\n* Tested in JIRA 6.4.1\r\n* Service Desk 2.3.5\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Install Service Desk in the latest JIRA (at time of writing, 6.4.1)\r\n# In the Service Desk Queue, try to manage the watcher for one of the issues.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nThe section that allows you to watch users appear\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nNothing happens when you try to click on the number of watchers (which should usually allow you to manage the watchers)\r\n\r\n!watch1.png|thumbnail!\r\n \r\nh3. Notes\r\n* Managing voters from the Service Desk Queue is fine\r\n* Does not seem to occur in older versions of JIRA (did not happen in JIRA 6.3.9 when testing)\r\n* Does not seem to be affected by version of Service Desk. In JIRA 6.3.9, tried in both Service Desk 2.3.2 and 2.3.5, but problem does not occur.",

The problem is worse for AWS, since it will create many new nodes and never reuse them. \r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\nWe should find a way to clear out any old ids, without removing any entries that might be from a temporarily offline node.\r\n\r\nh3. Note\r\nHaving old nodes in the system (table) may cause other problems, see related:\r\n* JRASERVER-65538\r\n* JRASERVER-69652\r\n\r\nh3.

I have set one of these to the default. The problem is, the \"None\" option is still available to the users.\r\n\r\nJIRA is able to recognize which Security Levels are available to users, including the \"None\" option. The problem is that the \"None\" option will be selected automatically for a user if the default Security Level is not available for them. From what I've read in the documentation, the \"None\" security level means that everyone can access the issue.\r\n\r\nThe Screens component of JIRA is intelligent enough to not show the \"Security Level\" option if there is no Issue Security Scheme set for the project. Unfortunately, the Workflows component is not. If you set \"Security Level\" as required in a workflow, it will not be disabled for a project that doesn't have a Security Scheme set, thus requiring a copy with a very minor change.\r\n\r\nThis combination of \"features\" results in reduced re-usability of screens and workflows and potentially unsafe default options if \"None\" is allowed to be present with no way to remove it or at least default to a more restrictive option.\r\n\r\nOne proposed fix would be to allow a way to remove the \"None\" option on fields without requiring us to set it to \"Required\" in a workflow.\r\n\r\nAnother option would be to disregard Security Level as a required field in Workflow Validators when the current project does not have a Issue Security Scheme configured.\r\n\r\nAnother partial fix could also be to default to any option other than \"None\" if the default is not available to the user.",

Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Setup JIRA with the URL [http://jira.domain1|http://jira.domain1/]\r\n # Create OAuth Application Link between JIRA and Stash\r\n # Allow JIRA user to access Stash data\r\n # Check Stash user \"Authorized applications\" page [http://stash.domain:7990/plugins/servlet/oauth/users/access-tokens]\r\n It is showing Stash server allow JIRA server on jira.domain1 to access Stash data\r\n # Revoke the access\r\n # Delete the Application Link\r\n # Change JIRA server Base URL to [http://jira.domain2|http://jira.domain2/]\r\n # Access JIRA server with the URL [http://jira.domain2|http://jira.domain2/]\r\n # Create OAuth Application Link between JIRA and Stash again\r\n # Allow JIRA user to access Stash data\r\n # Check Stash user \"Authorized applications\" page [http://stash.domain:7990/plugins/servlet/oauth/users/access-tokens]\r\n It is *still* showing Stash server allow JIRA server on jira.domain1 (instead of the new baseURL jira.domain2) to access Stash data\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nStash User Authorized application (OAuth token) page should be using the new JIRA URL as shown in the Application Links\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nStill using the old JIRA URL\r\nh3. Notes\r\n\r\nFound out that Stash is getting this OAuth Consumer Description from JIRA server database table \"oauthconsumer\". \r\n Anyway, the Application Link still works fine even though the URL in the description is incorrect\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n # Backup JIRA database for rollback purposes\r\n # Shutdown JIRA\r\n # Edit the table \"oauthconsumer\" to change the URL and optionally, the name:\r\n{code:sql}\r\nUPDATE oauthconsumer SET consumername='<JIRA_new_name>' WHERE consumername='<JIRA_old_name>'\r\nUPDATE oauthconsumer SET description='Atlassian JIRA at <new_URL>' WHERE description='Atlassian JIRA at <old_URL>'\r\n{code}\r\n\r\n # Restart JIRA\r\n # Delete both Application Links in Stash and JIRA\r\n # Recreate the Application Links",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-42878].\n  {panel}\n\nWhen integrating JIRA with subversion or git repositories, currently it is only possible to link to JIRA issues by mentioning the JIRA issue key in commit messages/change sets. There are advantages in making this more configurable, such that one could specify some other property e.g. a custom field that could be used for the link other than issue key if necessary.\r\n\r\nThe use case for this is usually with users migrating from other issue trackers with pre-existing subversion integration. We may be seeing more requests for this e.g.:\r\n* https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/282164/how-to-index-repository-referecing-ids-from-migrated-bugzilla-issues\r\n* https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/174771/how-to-receive-subversion-commits-of-an-imported-project-using-the-external-issue-id\r\n\r\nThis applies to different methods of integration including JIRA Subversion plugin, Fisheye plugin, DVCS connector etc.",

Besides that it provides a button from which the user can go to JIRA without the need of login. The consequence is after some time, maybe days, the user loses his JIRA section and needs to login again. At this time he does not know the login and password.\r\n\r\nWe think this could be solved changing the last screen of the setup for me installation in some way that enforces the important information about the login or/and obligating the user to login at first time he goes to JIRA after installed. \r\n\r\nThe screenshoots from the setup for me selection and the last installation screen are attached.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nDaniel P Santos",

Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Create an Application Link between JIRA 6.3.15 and Stash 3.8.0;\r\n# Edit the Project's workflow in JIRA to use a Trigger to transition Open to In Progress (for example) when a commit is created for the issue;\r\n# Commit something on a Stash repository and add a JIRA issue key to the commit comment;\r\n# JIRA will transition the issue to In Progress - Navigate to the Dashboard to see the Activity Stream, which shall be displayed successfully including Stash's logo.\r\n# Stop JIRA and upgrade it to 6.4.1;\r\n# Start JIRA 6.4.1 and navigate to the Dashboard.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nJIRA would show the Activity Stream correctly, including Stash's logo.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nJIRA shows the Activity Stream, but does not display Stash's logo (returns a 404 error).\r\nThe below exception is thrown in the xxxxxxx.log file:\r\n{noformat}\r\nXXXX-XX-XX XX:XX:XX,XXX http-bio-8080-exec-11 INFO xxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxx XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX,127.0.0.1 /download/resources/com.atlassian.jira.plugins.jira-development-integration-plugin:devstatus-panel-and-dialog-resources/logo_stash96.png [plugin.webresource.servlet.PluginResourceDownload] Could not locate resource: /download/resources/com.atlassian.jira.plugins.jira-development-integration-plugin:devstatus-panel-and-dialog-resources/logo_stash96.png\r\n{noformat}\r\n \r\nh3.
