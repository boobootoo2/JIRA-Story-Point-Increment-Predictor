      "description": "Hi,\r\n\r\ncurrently I have a big issue to face.\r\n\r\nWe have a lot of old projects and users. Some of them which already left the company or aren't involved in the project anymore. I disable them and then leave them alone until a year has passed. We aren't a big company but with 30 users in the user management it already starts to look messy. This is one of the reason why I'd want to deleted users rather than just disable them.\r\n\r\nNow with the new European privacy regulation (DSGVO) we even have to delete all personal data of a user, too.\r\n\r\nWhat I do now: I take the user, delete the profile picture and set their name to dummy values. This may be a legitimate way in privacy matters. But now I have a few disabled users with generic names. If this list keeps growing, I'm going to have a problem.\r\n\r\nNow I just can't delete the users. I wouldn't have a problem with that, but Jira just doesn't let me, because the users have issues where they are assigned or reporters. Even though the projects are already concluded. That alone wouldn't be a problem, since I have a system user which I could bulk change all the issues to. The issue here are comments. It's not easy to get a list of all issues with comments of this user and it's even harder to delete these comments. And it's nearly impossible to change the author of a comment.\r\n\r\nAs I said, I'm obligated to remove all personal data of a user. And a lot of other companies, especially in Europe, will have to deal with this, too.\r\n\r\nSo why not just give the option to delete a user, even though he has comments and is assigned or reporter of an issue? You could just remove the user then, and assign the ticket to Unassigned or a specified/default user. And the comments: Just replace the name with a placeholder like \"Deleted User\" and remove the link to the profile. This way all the history is kept and it's not linked to a specific person.",

Synchronous replication may cause problems with scalability, as each change in cache needs to be replicated to other nodes. It means each change is blocking other actions for the caller until completed. Second important thing is that replication event is not guaranteed to be delivered. If something goes wrong, there is an exception when replicating - the operation will not be redone and cluster may be inconsistent, until cache will be refreshed.\u00a0\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nCaches in Data Center should be replicated asynchronously (async) using persistent layer as a separation of HTTP thread and RMI replication mechanism.\r\n * HTTP thread will be responsible only for persisting replication events to queues and replication itself should happen asynchronously to that thread.\r\n * The order of replication events coming from one HTTP request should be preserved.\r\n * Replication event is removed from queue only when there is confirmation of successful replication to other node.\r\n * If replication can not be done, replication event will remain in queue, waiting for possibility to replicate",

Summary\r\nIf a user was created with a trailing (or leading) non-breaking space on its username, this string will be used as the *user_key* for the user, even if the username is changed.

Check they're still active and available, and try again.}}\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Create a user using a trailing non-breaking space character (U+00A0).\r\n# Attempt to add the user to a project role.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nThe user is added to the selected role.\r\n\r\nh3.

Environment\r\n * Jira instance which is hosted in a domain {{example.com}} (The base URL is like [http://example.com/jira])\r\n * Some image files which are hosted in the same domain. The image URLs are like\r\n ## URL without context path like [http://example.com/image.png]\r\n ## URL with context path like [http://example.com/wiki/.../image.png] (Generally, this type of URL can be seen in Confluence which is hosted in the same domain of Jira)\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Start to edit comment\r\n # Change the edit mode to *Text* mode\r\n # Embed images which are listed in \"Environment\" section with following [the text formatting notation|https://jira.atlassian.com/secure/WikiRendererHelpAction.jspa?section=attachments]\r\n{code:java}\r\n!http://example.com/image.png!\r\n{code}\r\nor\r\n{code:java}\r\n!http://example.com/wiki/.../image.png!\r\n{code}\r\n\r\n # Save the comment\r\n # Now, you can see the image is embedded in the comment as expected\r\n # Start to edit the comment again\r\n # Change the edit mode to *Visual* mode\r\n # Add some texts after the embedded image\r\n # Save the comment\r\n\r\nh3.

Problem Definition\r\n# Currently, to create a Project from REST API, we will need to provide projectTemplateKey as per the example from [JIRA 7.7.1 Create Project REST API|https://docs.atlassian.com/software/jira/docs/api/REST/7.7.1/#api/2/project-createProject]:\r\n{noformat}\r\n{\r\n    \"key\": \"EX\",\r\n    \"name\": \"Example\",\r\n    \"projectTypeKey\": \"business\",\r\n    \"projectTemplateKey\": \"com.atlassian.jira-core-project-templates:jira-core-project-management\",\r\n    \"description\": \"Example Project description\",\r\n    \"lead\": \"Charlie\",\r\n    \"url\": \"http://atlassian.com\",\r\n    \"assigneeType\": \"PROJECT_LEAD\",\r\n    \"avatarId\": 10200,\r\n    \"issueSecurityScheme\": 10001,\r\n    \"permissionScheme\": 10011,\r\n    \"notificationScheme\": 10021,\r\n    \"categoryId\": 10120\r\n}\r\n{noformat}\r\n# However, there is no REST API endpoint to retrieve the available {{projectTemplateKey}} from JIRA.\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\nTo have a REST API endpoint for us to retrieve the available {{projectTemplateKey}} from JIRA so that we can use the {{projectTemplateKey}} during the Project creation.\r\n \r\nh3. Workaround \r\nThe available {{projectTemplateKey}} is listed in [JIRA API 7.1.0 Create Project - Atlassian Community|https://community.atlassian.com/t5/Answers-Developer-Questions/JIRA-API-7-1-0-Create-Project/qaq-p/551444].",

      "description": "h3. Summary:\r\nJIRA users are able to bulk move issues. When performing this operation the issues will be presented to the user so that they may select the destination.\r\n * This selection occurs at \"Step 3 of 4: Select Projects and Issue Types\"\r\n\r\nThis page will combine issues into groups, allowing a destination to be selected for that group.\r\n\r\n+Example+:\r\n * \"You have chosen to move 1000 issues from 8 project(s) with 14 issue type(s). You can either select a new project and issue type for each of the existing 26 combinations below or choose to move all standard issues to a single project and issue type.\"\r\n\r\nEach combination provides a project and issue type dropdown. In addition sub-tasks also show a third dropdown for selecting a new parent.\r\n * Note: JIRA does not combine sub-tasks into a combination on the bulk move page when those sub-tasks have different parents.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n * Use very large instance, greater than 2000 projects and issue types\r\n * Ensure user performing action has permission for these projects\r\n * Attempt bulk move where the set of issues contains a large number of subtasks that have distinct parents\r\n ** Example JQL: \"issuetype in subTaskIssueTypes()\"\r\n\r\nh3. Problem Behavior:\r\nInstances with a large number of projects and issue types may encounter memory issues if a large number of combinations appear. This can result in OutOfMemoryError when rendering the page.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Behavior: \r\nJIRA prevents the page from causing memory issues.\r\n * Perhaps a limit on the number of combinations that can be displayed\r\n * Or perhaps the page could be changed to work differently.\r\n\r\nh3. Additional Details:\r\nThe presence of sub-tasks in the search results can result in a large number of combinations. JIRA does not combine sub-tasks into a combination on the bulk move page when those sub-tasks have different parents.\r\n\r\nIn one example we found 277 issues returned by the search. Mostly sub-tasks, these resulted in 271 combinations on the bulk move page.\r\n * Each of the 271 combinations loaded the following lists:\r\n ** Project List = 2590 values, 665135 characters, 650KB\r\n ** Issue type List = 3382 values, 985747 characters, 963KB\r\n\r\nThe total for just these lists was over 400MB. The entire BodyContentImpl containing these lists was over 900MB in size.\r\n * Five BodyContentImpl objects exist, all related to the bulk move. Total retained heap is around 6GB for these five objects\r\n\r\nThe large objects show in the dominator tree:\r\n * !image-2018-03-08-19-07-57-609.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nHeap is consumed by very large Char objects tied to the bulk move:\r\n * !image-2018-03-08-19-10-09-524.png|thumbnail!\r\n * !image-2018-03-08-19-20-29-319.png|thumbnail!\r\n \u00a0\r\nh3. Workaround \r\nOnly move one set of (target project, target issue type) issues at a time.",
