For me specifically, this is a really bad outcome, as my cloud addon is dependent on them.  All my customers got an outage because of this, some may still not know there is a problem.  I don't know who has the problem because I can't guage status, which leads me to:\r\n\r\nAs a Cloud addon, I have no way to validate the 'heath' of the core Atlassian Connect infrastructure (of which webhooks are a part).  Some potential options:  \r\n\r\n# Atlassian could implement some post instance startup validation to sanity check things like 'is webhooks enabled / usable' (specifically talking of JIRACloud here, so Atlassian can 'know' about the problem at boot time, rather than customer feedback time ;))\r\n# Atlassian could create an Hourly Webhook 'Im alive' POST including a payload of internal healthheck status.  This allows addons to track when a host was last 'healthy', potentially communicating to host owner about that.  (possible, but Id rather not get auto pinged to death, if I got a webhook 5m ago, I dont need to know webhooks are healthy)\r\n# Atlassian could add a new REST service to divulge internal health check would make all manner of 3rd party monitoring possible, Pingdom : \"webhooks : enabled\" etc.  I would find this very handy. (possibly valid for JIRAserver as well as JIRACloud, being able to locally in an addon, know I hadn't got a webhook for more than an hour, could start polling health to check status, taking notification action as necessary)",

While I realize that this was done to improve performance, this is an import piece of information on a gadget as often a dashboard includes many different views of information using different filters.  I understand that the filter name is displayed at the bottom of the gadget, however this is truncated, and not as convenience (especially of a filter with a large number of rows) to view.  I would like to suggest that either the filter name be added back to the title bar of the gadget, or users be able to edit the title bar description as desired.  As a last alternative, I would like to suggest that the filter name be moved from the bottom of the gadget to the top and that the entire filter name be shown instead of truncating that name and requiring a mouse-over to see the entire name.  Unfortunately, if this trend continues, it will mean that the JIRA dashboards lose their usefulness for us, and we will need to move to an external dashboarding program like Tableau or look for alternative tracking systems.",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-43881].\n  {panel}\n\nJIRA uses clipboard-unfriendly HTML and CSS to display the issue key and summary title on many pages (like the one you're reading right now). This makes it unnecessarily hard to copy and paste the key and summary into an email or other document (something I do 5+ times per day). \r\n\r\nJIRA could make small changes to its HTML markup and CSS that would not change how the page looks but would make it much easier to copy, paste, and share JIRA info with the outside world. In particular: \r\n* title and summary should show up as a single line of text in text-only clipboard clients\r\n* formatting should be easy to repair for rich-text clients after pasting\r\n\r\nTo repro: \r\n* on this page, use the mouse to select both the issue key and summary\r\n* copy selection to clipboard\r\n* paste into the title of an Outlook email (or Google Docs or Word or ...)\r\n\r\nExpected: 1 line of text, because that's all that will fit into an Outlook email title. Ideally text that's a normal font size. And formatted like this: \r\nJIRA-1234 - Make it easier to copy key and summary. \r\n\r\nActual: \r\n* In outlook email titles, only the issue key shows up. You'll need to paste the clipboard somewhere else, remove the newline, then paste into the email\r\n* In rich-text apps (Google docs, Word, etc.) you'll get a one-line list (which breaks any bullet points you paste into) and then a second paragraph of the summary in a huge font. \r\n* If you use Word's/Outlook's \"Merge Formatting\" feature to try to match the formatting to your document, you end up with the issue key being 1. in a numbered list because the key is inside an LI element in HTML. \r\n\r\nPossible Solution:\r\nBy making a few minor HTML and CSS changes, and without making any changes to how your key + summary HTML is displayed, you could make a big improvement in how this content is pasted. \r\n\r\nHere's what I did in Firebug as a proof of concept:\r\n1. changed the OL/LI elements currently used for the project name and key to SPAN elements with similar CSS. This is the first step to get plain-text clipboard clients (e.g. Outlook mail titles) to treat the selection as one line instead of two. This change also prevents problematic impact on bullet points and also enables Word/Outlook Merge Formatting to work correctly. \r\n2. added a SPAN after the issue key with content of \" - \" and style=\"color:transparent\". This adds a \" - \" after the issue key that won't be normally visible (it's transparent!) but will be copied to the clipboard. \r\n3. wrapped the H1 issue summary title with a DIV with style=\"display: inline-block; width: 100%;\". This is the second part of convincing clipboard clients that this is a one-line block of text. \r\n\r\nSteps 1-3 above enable a single line of plain text to be pasted. Whoo-hoo!  But rich-text clipboard clients (e.g. Word, Google Docs) still display the text as two lines because the H1 is recognized as a line-breaking block element, even when wrapped inside that sneaky inline-block DIV.  But, if you're willing to change the H1 element, then you can get all the text onto one line in all clients using step #4 below: \r\n\r\n4. Change the H1 to a SPAN with similar CSS as the H1. I used this CSS: display: inline-block; font-size: 24px; margin-top: -2px; margin-bottom: -2px;\r\n\r\nThis is still not perfect because the text is in a big font size, but it's massively better than the current state. \r\n\r\nBelow is the Firebugged HTML after steps 1-4 above. I'm not suggesting you should implement exactly like this, but only want to illustrate that minor HTML and CSS changes could improve usability in an important part of the product without changing how the page looks. \r\n\r\n{{\r\n<div class=\"aui-page-header-main\"><span class=\"aui-nav aui-nav-breadcrumbs __skate\"><span><a href=\"/browse/AEON\" id=\"project-name-val\">Seed Web</a><span style=\"margin: 0 6px 0 2px\"> / </span><span><a class=\"issue-link\" data-issue-key=\"AEON-10353\" href=\"/browse/AEON-10353\" id=\"key-val\" rel=\"77818\">AEON-10353</a></span><span style=\"color:transparent\"> - </span></span></span><span style=\"display: inline-block; width: 100%;\"><span style=\"display: inline-block; font-size: 24px; margin-top: -2px; margin-bottom: -2px;\" title=\"Click to edit\" class=\"editable-field inactive\" id=\"summary-val\">Reports cannot be viewed in chrome on iPad<span class=\"overlay-icon aui-icon aui-icon-small aui-iconfont-edit\"></span></span></span></div>\r\n}}",

In this event, the user can be present with a quick links menu with, for example;\r\n\r\n- Add issue as child item\r\n- Link issue\r\n- Close as duplicate of\r\n- Merge issues\r\n\r\nIf this could also be done in bulk by selecting multiple items, this would make my life a lot easier, especially as there is no way to move items to a parent issue using the bulk editor.",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-43844].\n  {panel}\n\nh3. ***Current Behavior***\r\n\r\nWhen creating a new sub-task, the default status of the subtask would be based on the workflow of the associated issue type.\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. ***Feature Request***\r\n\r\nWe would like to have the option to set all newly created sub-task to the status of the parent issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n{panel:title=Original Request}\r\n1.\tWhat are the current issues that you face with the existing feature?\r\nThe current behaviour (as you have specified) using an OnDemand Jira instance, is limiting me from having separate boards for Planning and In Progress/Daily Standup work. My choices with the current implementation are\r\n\r\n1. To have a single kanban board for all stories in our backlog as well as work currently in play (which has the significant negative effect of making our preferred Epic Based Swimlanes impractical, due to long lists of planned work that need to be scrolled through to get to the next Epic of work in Progress), or \r\n2. To keep flitting back-and-forth between Planning boards and In Progress boards to move sub-tasks through the planning statuses and into the In Progress statuses. \r\nThe way that we run agile, we rarely create sub-tasks until our stories are taken into our In Progress statuses, as we tend not to do detailed analysis until the story is ready to play.\r\n\r\n2.\tWhat would you like to be able to do in the future?\r\nFull description of the requested feature\r\nI would like to have the option to specify the status that I want sub-tasks to be created in. Ideally I would like them to be created in the To Do Column of my In Progress board if the story is already represented in a status on that board, or, in the case of a story that is still in a status of my Planning board, to be created in the status of the parent story. I realise this is quite complex to implement, so I would be happy with a limited solution of having the option to just create the sub-tasks in the same status as the parent issue from which they are created (at least this way I could ensure they are on the same board as the parent issue)\r\n\r\n3.\tHow would you like this feature to behave?\r\nAny ideas you may have on how the desired feature should be implemented. (If any) \r\nI would propose having a Post Condition on the Create Transition in the Workflow that allowed me to specify that \"if the issuetype is sub-task, then set status to that of the parent issue\".\r\nI realise that you are unable to guarantee this feature request will be implemented, or if so, offer an ETA on the work, but I wish to emphasise that this is really hindering all our teams on a daily basis. I am currently in the process of rolling out JIRA across my organisation, and whilst the teams I have already migrated are generally really pleased with the functionality offered by JIRA over their previous system, this is a constant source of frustration to them.\r\n{panel}",
