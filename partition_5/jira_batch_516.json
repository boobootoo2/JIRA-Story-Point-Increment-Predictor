Problem Definition\r\nNormally when a customer create issue via email, the email is forwarded to external email that is not added as \"Request Participant\" or Organization to the ticket. Due to that, when the external user replied the email , the email is not added as comment to the existing ticket. In Cloud environment there's no way to allow it , except the issue need to shared to the user first. \r\n\r\nIn JSD server , the feature \"Public Email Comments\" already released and it allow emails from addresses which are currently not registered as customers of your service desk or the issue not shared to the customer, to be added as comments to the associated request. This is explain in [this|https://confluence.atlassian.com/servicedeskserver/receiving-requests-by-email-939926303.html#Receivingrequestsbyemail-Preparecustomersforemailgreatness] documentation.\r\n\r\nThis is how it look in Server environment:-\r\n !emailimage.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\nIt will be great for this feature to be released to Cloud environment too.\r\n\r\nh3.

Summary:\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to have the ability to configure the edit screens based upon on the request type instead of the issue type.\r\n\r\nHere it follows some use cases on which this it would be a nice to have:\r\n\r\nFor requests raised via email, we can only have a default request type. Analyzing the ticket we need to do a triage on those request and then change the request type as desired and on this new request type, we may have additional custom fields that need to be provided by the agents. As so far the screens are based upon on the Issue type, all the fields for that specific issue type will be shown and it keeps hard to agents know which fields they need to edit for that specific request.\r\n\r\nAnother scenario on which it would be useful is for when the customer submits the request and we need to edit and add some additional information about that specific request as well.\r\nh3. Suggestion:\r\n\r\nIf we were able to set up edit screens based upon on Request types it would be much easier to Agents edit the tickets.",
