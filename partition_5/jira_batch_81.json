      "description": "The rebase feature does not function correctly. When I rebase from [commit hash] interactively and then choose squash with previous commits, I have to repeat this process several times because the rebase function only actually squashes 1-3 commits. So I have to keep doing it over and over again until the feature branch is finally truly squashed into the commits I want to squash it into. Then I have to ammend commit to edit the commit message because: \r\n\r\nA. the edit commit message from the rebase menu sucks, and \r\nB. The software thinks it actually squashed x amount of commits but it didn't so I get a rebase message that looks like:\r\n[hash] commit message (+3 squashed commit)\r\n\r\nSquashed commit:\r\n\r\n[hash] commit message\r\n[hash] commit message\r\n[hash] commit message\r\n[hash] commit message (+5 squashed commits)\r\n\r\nSquashed commit:\r\n\r\n[hash] commit message\r\n[hash] commit message\r\n...\r\n\r\nHowever your rebase function is broken for several other reasons than this actual bug.  If I am on a feature branch I should be able to say rebase interactively on develop, as opposed to  rebase all children of [hash] interactively. I will admit that the logic of `rebase all children of [hash] interactively` could def. come in handy in some scenarios, but with git flow (a feature built in to your software) it makes more sense to rebase feature on develop, or rebase hotfix on master etc... \r\n\r\nSecondly, why put in the edit commit message and not give it the exact same functionality as when I create a normal commit message (i.e. allow me to do carriage returns, spell check etc...)?? You might as well fix the rebase bug I addressed at the begging of this issue and not allow me to customize the message at all!\r\n\r\nI'm pretty disappointed in the rebasing feature for source tree which sucks because it has been the best git client I ever used, but if your not going to correctly implement rebasing I'd rather you pull it out all together, it makes the software experience a lot more loathsome than I use to feel about using source tree.  Until this functionality is fixed I am just going to pretend that the rebasing features don't exist and rebase from the terminal \"/",

Latest updates, latest drivers on everything.\r\n\r\nWhen ST is open, I randomly get BSODs. There is absolutely no pattern to it whatsoever. I don't even have to be interacting with ST for it to happen, so my guess is that the issue is connected to the directory monitoring. It took me a long time to even figure out ST was causing it...\r\n\r\nThe length between BSODs might be 5 minutes or more than a day.\r\n\r\nIt's not even the same message every time! I've gotten IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL, PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA, QUOTA_UNDERFLOW...\r\n\r\nReading this your natural reaction will be that it's not ST causing it, but I'm 100% positive.

For this we fall back to Git Extensions as it has a 'Grey out non-relatives' feature which greys out the lines of all branches that have not been merged into the currently checked out branch (screenshot attached). This is super handy as it gives us a great visual overview of which features are on which release branch. If this were to be added I would transition my whole team to SourceTree as the only GIT UI.",

This view would basically hide everything except for the \"Working Copy Changes\" and the differences pane.\r\n\r\nOr, enable a shortcut key that would treat the native difference viewer in SourceTree (which is actually a really good difference engine) as if it were a standalone app like BeyondCompare or Araxis Merge.
