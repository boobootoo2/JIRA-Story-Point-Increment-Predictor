In our scenario, we set-up a dedicated VM server specifically for a large JIRA instance (10gb Heap).  It has been scaled accordingly for Server Memory and CPU.  Every time we restart the JVM it causes the system to dump a hs_err_pid.log file.  \r\nThis was never a problem when JIRA was being used on a shared server and the extra memory was available.\r\n\r\nIn short, with more teams moving to Virtual environments, this will be a problem that will continue grow.\r\n\r\nI added a copy of what the setenv.sh file might look like.",

Furthermore validateAndUpdateIssueFromFields takes in a boolean updateComment which determines whether or not to update the comment, however if this is set to false and skipScreenCheck is set to true in the IssueInputParameters then the comment is updated regardless.\r\n\r\nh2. Proposed Solution\r\n\r\n1. An OR condition be added to the if statement which determines if we care about a screen attached\r\nie. We want to be able to validate and update fields without a screen\r\n\r\n2. updateIssueFromFieldsWithoutScreenCheck should either \r\nA. check for the updateComment boolean \r\nOR\r\nB. not update the comment orderableField",

That means, it supports a maximum of 18 digits only, 12 before and 6 after the decimal point e.g. 111222333444.555666\r\n\r\nHowever, when trying to enter a very big value e.g. 111222333444555666777888999, the field says it supports the maximum value of 100000000000000, which is 15 digits before the decimal point.\r\n\r\nThis is incorrect, as it exceeds the number of digits before the decimal point and there will be not enough space for the decimal digits.

(The same {{function handleDatePickerFocus}} is also registered as a handler for other events, and those seem to be removed when needed.) If an application dynamically creates date pickers on demand, these event listeners accumulate, even if the date pickers are otherwise destroyed and removed from the document. (Also, the listener becomes orphaned when {{reset()}} is called, and a new one is added during the first {{show()}}.)\r\n\r\nWhat\u2019s worse is that orphan event listeners will actually throw an exception if triggered after {{destroyPolyfill()}}, because {{destroyPolyfill()}} deletes the {{hide()}} method (at line 207 in my copy), but {{handleDatePickerFocus()}}\u202f\u2014\u202fthe event handler\u202f\u2014\u202fcalls it without checking if it exists anymore. Only one exception is thrown per event, even if multiple orphan listeners are attached, because the exception interrupts event dispatching. The bad news is that legitimate event listeners later in the dispatch queue don\u2019t get the event anymore, either.\r\n\r\nNote: This concerns the file {{aui-date-picker.js}} from the {{com.atlassian.auiplugin:aui-date-picker}} web-resource. The debugging I did was on a dev-mode JIRA instance with version {{v7.0.0#70107-sha1:6cd5e8d}}, but I\u2019m pretty sure it affects any product using the AUI date picker.

Problem Definition\r\n\r\nCurrently our Documentation provides the following guidance for upgrading JIRA and Supported plugins.  \r\n\r\n{quote}\r\nIf you have installed JIRA plugins (i.e. not included with JIRA), verify that they will be compatible with the version of JIRA you are upgrading to. You can find a plugin's compatibility information from the plugin's home page on the Atlassian Plugin Exchange.\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nThe Universal Plugin Manager is able to check Plugin versions against newer releases. This simpler approach should be taken for customers to check their compatibility when upgrading a running Instance. See: [Checking add-on compatibility with application updates|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/UPM/Checking+add-on+compatibility+with+application+updates] for more details. \r\n\r\n \r\nh3.

Since now JIRA will verify whether the group is actually can be deleted only when user clicks the button. Should delete be not possible - JIRA will not execute the operation and show an information message for the administrator why the delete operation failed.\r\n\r\nThis change now dramatically speeds up the page.\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u2013\r\n Cheers,\r\n Ignat\r\n JIRA Bugmaster\r\n{panel}\r\n\u00a0\r\nh3. Summary\r\n\r\nAccessing *Admin (Cog)* > *User Management* > *Groups* can be slow for large JIRA instances (page url: {{secure/admin/user/GroupBrowser.jspa}}). In JIRA 7 new functionality was added and JIRA checks if group can be deleted, see example:\r\n !Non_delete.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nRelated code from {{groupbrowser.jsp}}:\r\n{code:java}\r\n<ww:property id=\"prospectiveDeleteError\" value=\"groupDeletable(name)\" />\r\n            <ww:if test=\"@prospectiveDeleteError != ''\">\r\n                <li><a id=\"del_<ww:property value=\"name\" />\" class=\"aui-button aui-button-link\" href=\"javascript:void(0)\" title=\"<ww:property value=\"@prospectiveDeleteError\" />\" aria-disabled=\"true\" disabled><ww:text name=\"'common.words.delete'\"/></a></li>\r\n{code}\r\nFor each group from the list, method {{GroupBrowser.isGroupDeletable}} will be called. It does number of checks and as part of {{getCommentsAndWorklogsGuardedByGroupCount}} method it will generate following SQL query:\r\n{code:java}\r\nSELECT COUNT(A.ID) FROM public.jiraaction A WHERE A.actiontype='comment' AND A.actionlevel='<GROUP NAME>'}}\r\n{code}\r\nAn example in the SQL log would be ( time _1s_):\r\n{code:sql}\r\n2016-04-27 13:51:22,470 http-nio-18714-exec-14 admin 831x1484x1 jcaucx /secure/admin/user/GroupBrowser.jspa 1083ms \"SELECT COUNT(A.ID) FROM public.jiraaction A WHERE A.actiontype='comment' AND A.actionlevel='developers_9'\"\r\n{code}\r\nThere are no indexes that will enhance the performance of this query and as a result this query can take sometime to complete.\r\nh3. Environment\r\n\r\nAny database + JIRA 7\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Create a JIRA instance with a large number of comments or jira 'actions'. You can use the [JIRA Data Generator|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.atlassian.jira.plugins.jira-data-generator/server/overview] to help replicate this issue.\r\n # Enable SQL Logging from: *Admin (Cog)* > *System* > *Logging and Profiling*\r\n # Access the Groups page.\r\n # Observe the slow responsiveness of this page.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nJIRA should be responsive when accessing this page.\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nThe page can take some time to respond due to these queries being executed for each group that is displayed.\r\nh3. Notes\r\n\r\nTracing the thread dumps shows a long-running thread such as:\r\n{noformat}\r\n\t\t...\r\n        at com.atlassian.jira.issue.comments.DefaultCommentManager.getCountForCommentsRestrictedByField(DefaultCommentManager.java:443)\r\n        at com.atlassian.jira.issue.comments.DefaultCommentManager.getCountForCommentsRestrictedByGroup(DefaultCommentManager.java:416)\r\n        at com.atlassian.jira.bc.group.DefaultGroupService.getCommentsAndWorklogsGuardedByGroupCount(DefaultGroupService.java:824)\r\n        at com.atlassian.jira.web.action.admin.user.GroupBrowser.isGroupDeletable(GroupBrowser.java:233)\r\n        at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke0(Native Method)\r\n        at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(NativeMethodAccessorImpl.java:62)\r\n        at sun.reflect.DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.java:43)\r\n        at java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Method.java:497)\r\n        at webwork.util.InjectionUtils$DefaultInjectionImpl.invoke(InjectionUtils.java:70)\r\n        at webwork.util.InjectionUtils.invoke(InjectionUtils.java:56)\r\n        at webwork.util.ValueStack.findValue(ValueStack.java:517)\r\n        at webwork.util.ValueStack.findValue(ValueStack.java:216)\r\n        at webwork.view.taglib.WebWorkBodyTagSupport.findValue(WebWorkBodyTagSupport.java:62)\r\n        at webwork.view.taglib.BasicPropertyTag.doStartTag(BasicPropertyTag.java:54)\r\n        at jsp.secure.admin.user.views.groupbrowser_jsp._jspx_meth_ww_005fproperty_005f12(groupbrowser_jsp.java:3167)\r\n{noformat}\r\nh3.

Suggested Solution\r\nTo have a configuration, example like Team and Theme to be passed to JIRA when creating and linking the issue.\r\n\r\nh3. Use case\r\n{quote}\r\nThere are various fields set in Portfolio - like Team and Theme for example.\r\n\r\nWe have added our own custom fields to JIRA for Team and Theme and we would like to set these values when the issue is created via Portfolio. We can already intercept the issue creation event in JIRA, but the data from Portfolio is not passed as part of the data received by JIRA.\r\n\r\nBeing able to expose Theme as a field in JIRA means we can then use our eazyBI plugin to do all sorts of useful analytics over our investment themes.\r\n\r\nIt also means that our business analysts don't need to manually keep 2 sets of data in sync.\r\n{quote}",

Problem Definition\r\n\r\nCurrently, the Resolution Time Gadget's Y Axis is set to measure *Days*, and this cannot be configured. If an issue is created and resolved in less than a full day, it will be represented on this gadget with a resolution time that is rounded down to 0 days. \r\n\r\nIf the following situation occurs:\r\n\r\n# An issue is created and resolved in less than the span of a full day\r\n# There are no other issues resolved on that day to raise the average of all issues to *at least* 1 day \r\n\r\nA confusing scenario will result where the chart shows no visible measurement for the day. You cannot discern if either no issues were resolved that day, or if there are issues but they average < 1 day. For example, in the screenshot below:\r\n\r\n !Resolution_Time_Gadget.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\nWithout expanding the gadget to view the data table, you cannot see that issues were resolved on 4/20/16 and 4/21/16.\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n \r\nThis could be addressed by allowing the Y axis measurement to be configured for more granularity; for example, by the *Hour* rather than by the *Day*.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround \r\nNone; expand the data table to view specific data.",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-60752].\n  {panel}\n\nHi JIRA team,\r\n\r\nLet me introduce our problem:\r\n\r\nWe would like to take advantage of \"Road map\" feature in project. Found out that it is interconnected with \"Fix Version/s\" field.\r\n\r\nWe started to use \"Fix Version/s\" for marking build number (e.g. \"6.1.23.0\") to which the issues is fixed.\r\nAtlassian help says this field should be used for marking mentioned, or future version to which we plan to fix this issue.\r\n\r\nThere are several build before a release is released. We may call the planned release something general like \"Service Release 1 (SR1)\". We plan to release SR1 let's say in Q3/2016.\r\n \r\nThis is where the problem lies. When we would like to take advantage of \"Road Map\", all \"unreleased\" versions are part of the roadmap. The roadmap will look as follows\r\n* 6.1.23.0\r\n* 6.1.24.0\r\n* 6.1.25.0\r\n* 6.1.26.0\r\n* 6.1.27.0\r\n* 6.1.28.0\r\n* Service Release 1 (SR1)\r\n* 6.1.29.0\r\n* 6.1.30.0\r\n* 6.1.31.0\r\n* 6.1.32.0\r\n* Service Release 2 (SR2)\r\n\r\nBasically, we would like to be able to filter build numbers so roadmap looks as follows:\r\n* Service Release 1 (SR1)\r\n* Service Release 2 (SR2)\r\n\r\nThe released build for SR1 will be \"6.1.28.0\" (but we obviously do not know the build number upfront, we call it SR1)\r\nThe released build for SR2 will be \"6.1.32.0\"(but we obviously do not know the build number upfront, we call it SR1)\r\n\r\nWe understand, that we may be able to set build numbers \"Release flag\" and they will not be shown in \"Road Map\". But this is not true and we do not want to do that. These build numbers are just interim builds for testing that will never be released.\r\n\r\nWe also understand that we may \"Archive\" the version. But we do not want to do that as well as archived versions cannot be searched for using Basic filter in JIRA. It is still available using JQL in advanced filter, but not all users are capable of creating their own advanced filter.\r\n\r\nI hope the problem is described clearly. If not, let me know and I will provide more information.\r\nMaybe there is another way we may achieve our goal which may be articulated as follows:\r\n\r\n* We would like to map issues to future larger releases like \"Service Release (SR1)\" and see \"Road Map\" with number of planned issues vs fixed issues. as follows:\r\n** Service Release 1 (SR1)\r\n** Service Release 2 (SR2)\r\n\r\nThank you very much in advance",
