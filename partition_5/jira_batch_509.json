Summary\r\n\r\nCurrently, the 'Organization' field in Service Desk can be set as a required field and added to the 'Create' screen for an issue. The problem with this is that the 'Organization' selection only shows up in the Customer Portal and will not appear as a visible field in the Create screen, thus making it impossible for an admin to require an organization to be chosen, and create a Service Desk ticket through JIRA rather than the Portal.\u00a0\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Set 'Organization' as a required field\r\n\r\n2. Add the field to the create screen in a Service Desk project\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nThe field should be visible and able to be set, or Service Desk should not allow you to set the field as required.\u00a0\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nThe field will only be visible in the Customer Portal and a user will not be able to create a ticket in that project through JIRA.\r\nh3. Notes\u00a0\r\n\r\nThis might be intended functionality (as Organization is primarily\u00a0a contact field and is meant as an option for customers to share a ticket with their org.), but allowing it to be set as required and put into a 'Create' screen causes confusion, as the ability implies that this field can be set through JIRA\u00a0during issue creation.",

They usually work when re-run.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Create an account with Zapier\r\n# Set up a Zap that uses the Create Request action\r\n# Execute the Zap\r\n\r\nNote: This issue cannot be reliably reproduced, but error logging points to an issue with the way we determine the scopes allowed for an endpoint in Jira. \r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nThe Zap is executed and a request is successfully created.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nThe request fails with a 403 response code and the error message \"OAuth2.0 is not enabled for this method\"\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nRetry the failed Zap manually.",
