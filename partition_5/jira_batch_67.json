However the application seems to carelessly use a few hundred megabytes on the disk after first launch. I have deleted some files and it all takes about 10MB now.\r\n\r\nHere's a list of what i've noticed that could be improved:\r\n1. The application folder contains 5 megs of .pdb files. Did you intend to ship all that debug data to the end user? Removing them shrinked the application folder size from ~15mb to ~10mb. The installer size would most likely benefit as well.\r\n\r\n2. The application does not clean up the git and mercurial distribution archives from \\AppData\\Local\\Atlassian\\SourceTree after installation, but ideally, it should. That's about 30MB saved.\r\n\r\n3. Lastly, and most importantly, please add the \"remove embedded\" buttons for embedded git and hg distributions. SourceTree downloads them both at first launch. Unpacked they take about 300MB in total. But some people might not need neither one. (I don't use hg and I use my own git folder) Removing the folders manually seems to work fine. Why not add a button for that purpose?",
