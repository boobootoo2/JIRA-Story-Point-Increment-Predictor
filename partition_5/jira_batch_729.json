Maybe you'd like a button \"reset to default\" or the like, but I don't consider that as hard requirement, as users can always display or hide any field with the existing toggle mechanism.\r\n\r\nYes, this is a kind of \"implicit\" user specific customization of basic search, and because it's implicit I do not consider it as new feature, as no additional GUI, documentation, etc is required.

I think this is an issue with jira & needs to be rectify.\r\n\r\nJira System should able to update name at each & every place in system, as its not possible for user to go & check/change in each and every board that used old project name.\r\n\r\nJIRA Agile (v6.3.13.1)\r\nReference: JSP-193610\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n- Vishal",

Summary\r\n\r\nWhen users attempt to submit information through an issue collector, it can randomly display 'Oops! Something went wrong...'. There is no specific information about what that error is.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n# Setup an issue collector.\r\n# Set the session timeout to 1 minute as per [Changing the default session timeout|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA062/Changing+the+default+session+timeout].\r\n# Open up the issue collector.\r\n# Wait for the user session to timeout.\r\n# Attempt to submit the form.\r\n\r\nh3.

Workaround\r\n\r\nIncrease the session timeout as per [Changing the default session timeout|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA062/Changing+the+default+session+timeout].\r\n\r\nh3. Notes\r\n\r\nThere are at least two ways to trigger this problem. Let's imagine the session timeout is 10 minutes.\r\n* Scenario A\r\n** T=0m: The user opens the feedback collector\r\n** T=0m: A new anonymous session is created (i.e. the user receives a JSESSIONID)\r\n** T=11m: The user submits the form. The JSESSIONID has timed out and it triggers the 401 response.\r\n\r\n* Scenario B\r\n** T=0m: The user opens the feedback collector and receives an anonymous session (for example, JSESSIONID=123)\r\n** T=1m: The user submits the feedback. Everything is ok at this point. The JSESSIONID=123 is still valid\r\n** T=9m: The user opens the feedback collector again. As they still have a valid JSESSIONID, no new session is created\r\n** T=11m: They submit the feedback using JSESSIONID=123. This session is now timed out, so they receive the 401.\r\n",

This will create a small \"eventless\" space between them, or at least add a few pixels between the Create button and the Cancel one so it's harder to click cancel by mistake.",
