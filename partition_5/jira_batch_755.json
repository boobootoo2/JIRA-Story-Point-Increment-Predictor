As a small company we have more than 500 but less than 1,000 employees. Currently if we had to renew it would be a $4,000 increase from our last renewal which I've already been told is unacceptable.\r\n\r\nOther than IT projects we use Jira as a Help Desk ticketing system. Although a good majority of our 700 employees never log onto Jira, we use it to communicate automaticaly upon opening/closing a ticket or email them with further follow up. \r\n\r\nIt appears my only option is to remove these non-essential customers from the Jira Users Group which will result in our license limit to decrease, but will impact how we communicate to our in-house customers. \r\n\r\nUnless you have any other suggestions",

Especially in larger enterprise instances with hundreds of projects managing project roles seems to be a common task for project administrators.\r\n\r\n*Current behaviour*\r\nNow if an user tries to open an issue he/she does not have the permission to view he/she gets an permission violation screen. On this permission violation screen the only contacts currently named are the \"JIRA administrators\". \r\n\r\n*Improvement* \r\nBut if project role administration is mostly done by project administrators, it would be helpful to show the name/s of the project lead/project administrators for the current project on the permission violation screen as well. Users could than directly contact the project lead and in most cases would get faster access to the project/issue than by contacting global JIRA administrators.\r\nAs not every installation of JIRA would like to have this feature, e.g. public mode instances, showing the project leads/project administrators on the permission violation screen should be optional. This could be a global option or a per-project option. An additional option could be to show just the plain name or an e-mail link.",

However, I have created a seperate bug for it because this [documentation clearly states|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Current+Reporter+Browse+Project+Permission] that the 'reporter' permission is different from the 'current reporter' permission. If this is a mistake, I guess the ticket can be closed as such.\r\n* The obvious workaround ofcourse is not to use 'Reporter' at all in the 'Browse Project Permissions', but the problem with this is that some use-cases need to allow any body who has created an issue in a project to be able to browse the project and atleast access issues they have reported.",

For other items on the Admin menu I have to do second authentication with my password first.\r\nThis seems odd.\r\n\r\nI can edit project details at this point without Admin mode being enabled.\r\n\r\nThen, if I try to add a project I get the second authentication request. I type in my password and Jira then takes a good 15 seconds to take me to a URL :\r\nhttps://jira.surevine.net/secure/admin/WebSudoAuthenticate.jspa\r\nWhich is a blank page.\r\n\r\nI can then click \"Back\" and I find I am logged out.\r\nIf I authenticate from here, I go back to the projects screen in user mode.\r\nIf I authenticate to admin mode from one of the other menu choices (e.g. User Management) first, then go to projects, things work OK.\r\n\r\nI think this is related to JRA-34646",
