The portal will be accessed by users with a variety of JIRA permission levels. It would be ideal if the JIRA portlet only displayed issues that the current user has permission to view. There are a variety of workarounds that partially address the scenario, but none that do it nicely. With Atlassian Crowd and SSO, I would think that it would be possible for JIRA and Crowd to transparently share authentication.\r\n",

We gave some external users read-only perms to our JIRA (like jira-users).  Discovered shortly thereafter that they were able to transition issues through their workflows.  After going through the docs, we began to worry that the only way to prevent this was to put conditions on all of the workflow steps (we have quite a few custom workflows).  We confirmed this after talking to support.\r\n\r\nThis is onerous in our particular case, as we now need to go thru the process of manually updating all of our workflows to preclude this from happening.  However, we think it illustrates an omission in the permission model.  We understand that from a technical perspective workflows are managed separately via OSWorkflow.  However, from a user/admin use case standpoint.  A 'read-only' issue should be just that and there should be a more global way to enforce this (i.e. a \"Transition Issues\" permission), as saying that 'read-only' users can't do this on every transition step is redundant.  The workflow conditions are more appropriate for 'fine-grained' checks like only 'testing' can move through this particular transition.",

Currently it looks like the events can be triggered only on workflow transitions, which means that they require active input from somebody.\r\n\r\nI'm aware that each user can set up a filter of their open issues and then subscribe to it; which allows them to get a regular nag email at whatever frequency they choose.  That's a good feature.  It is, however, voluntary; there's no way (that I know of) of forcing the user to have this subscription.  Also, it requires setting up an individual filter and subscription for each user.\r\n\r\nIf a timer service were available, it could potentially be useful for a number of other events as well as sending regular email.\r\n",
