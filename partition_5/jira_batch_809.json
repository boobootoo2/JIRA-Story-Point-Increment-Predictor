      "description": "{panel:bgColor=#e7f4fa}\n  *NOTE:* This suggestion is for *JIRA Server*. Using *JIRA Cloud*? [See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-28334].\n  {panel}\n\nCurrently SSL and Proxy are two of the more difficult configurations to setup on JIRA. It would be great to reduce the difficulty of this by enhancing the JIRA Configuration Tool so that it handles the setup of these. Already we have a fairly large amount of documentation that could be reduced with this functionality built in, for example:\r\n\r\nhttp://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Running+JIRA+over+SSL+or+HTTPS\r\nhttp://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Integrating+JIRA+with+Apache\r\nhttp://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Integrating+JIRA+with+Apache+using+SSL\r\nhttp://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Configuring+Apache+Reverse+Proxy+Using+the+AJP+Protocol\r\nhttp://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Integrating+JIRA+with+IIS\r\n\r\nAnd looking at the number of KBs we have to cater for these:\r\n\r\nhttp://confluence.atlassian.com/label/JIRAKB/ssl -> 12\r\nhttp://confluence.atlassian.com/label/JIRAKB/apache -> 20\r\nhttp://confluence.atlassian.com/label/JIRAKB/iis -> 3\r\n\r\nFor example, you could add a SSL and a Proxy tab to the configuration tool, or put them all in the Web Server tab, wherever fits best. This would then allow something like the following for SSL:\r\n\r\n# Select the SSL tab.\r\n# Select the location of the certificate.\r\n# Enter the certificate alias, if applicable.\r\n# Select the desired keystore (cacerts/user specific).\r\n# Enter the HTTPS port.\r\n# Select whether or not you wish to force HTTPS.\r\n# Hit the apply button.\r\n\r\nThis would then execute the appropriate keytool command to import the certificate using the path provided, update the {{server.xml}} and also modify the {{WEB-INF/web.xml}} if they want to force HTTPS.It could also provide an appropriate description of any errors if they arise.\r\n\r\nFor proxy, something like this would be ideal:\r\n\r\n# Select the proxy tab.\r\n# Select the proxy type (mod_proxy or AJP).\r\n# Enter the HTTPS port.\r\n# Enter the AJP port (if applicable).\r\n# Select whether or not HTTPS is being offloaded at the reverse-proxy.\r\n# Enter the base URL.\r\n# Enter the JIRA server IP.\r\n# Hit Apply.\r\n\r\nThis would then:\r\n\r\n# Parse the base URL and determine if a {{context}} path needs to be set in {{server.xml}} (as in [Configure JIRA's application server|http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Integrating+JIRA+with+Apache#IntegratingJIRAwithApache-Step1ConfigureJIRAsapplicationserver]).\r\n# Add the {{proxyPort}}, {{scheme}} and {{proxyPath}} attributes to the connector in {{server.xml}} (these values will vary depending on the settings, as in [Alternative configuration if HTTPS is terminated on the proxy server|http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Integrating+JIRA+with+Apache+using+SSL#IntegratingJIRAwithApacheusingSSL-NoteAlternativeconfigurationifHTTPSisterminatedontheproxyserver] and [Troubleshooting|http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Integrating+JIRA+with+Apache#IntegratingJIRAwithApache-Troubleshooting].\r\n# If you want to be super awesome, generate the block of text that the user will need to copy/paste into their VirtualHost configuration. For example:\r\n{code:title=VirtualHost}\r\n\r\n<Proxy *>\r\nOrder deny,allow\r\nAllow from all\r\n</Proxy>\r\n\r\nProxyRequests       \tOff\r\nProxyPreserveHost \tOn\r\n\r\nSSLEngine\t\tOn <-- based on whether or not terminating SSL\r\n\r\nProxyPass \t\t/${context_path}\t[ajp|http|https]://${JIRA IP}:${ajp or JIRA port}/${context_path}\r\nProxyPassReverse \t/${context_path}\t[ajp|http|https]://${JIRA IP}:${ajp or JIRA port}/${context_path}\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nThis would be *incredibly* useful.",

In the previous version 4.0.2 the cloned subtasks would not have the leading \"CLONE -\" applied to them, but only the parent task. Now the sub-tasks get this and if you don't edit the description and continue to clone the parent tasks the sub-tasks description starts to look something like this: CLONE - CLONE - CLONE\r\nThis might be somewhat annoying and not helpful. So I think having only one instance of the word CLONE would be sufficient even if I choose to clone a clone.\r\n",

This behavior affects the following color scheme configuration:\r\n-- Heading Color\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n# Go to Look and Feel and set the color scheme as attached screenshot for both JIRA 4.4 and JIRA 5.0: *COLOR SET*\r\n# Set Link color to *#411E66* and the color is not consistent to all the link in jira.

Therefore we think it is only fair to not keep this issue as open and close it as \"won't fix\". We will take this feedback into account as we work on ongoing design and usability improvements to the view issue page.\r\n\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nJason\r\nJIRA Product Management\r\njwong (at) atlassian (dot) com\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\n*Original description*\r\nWhen using JIRA, I often change the attachment sort order. I would really like to have a 'default sort order' so I don't have to do it as often.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround:\r\n\r\nThis is an unsupported, and hacky workaround but hopefully it helps some people. You can use the following code in your announcement banner:\r\n{code}<script>var direction = \"asc\"; //Other option is \"desc\"\r\nvar sortBy = \"dateTime\"; //Other option is \"fileName\"\r\n\r\nvar origUrl = window.location.href;\r\nvar patt = /browse\\/[A-Z][A-Z]+-[0-9]+/;\r\nvar key = new RegExp(\"[A-Z][A-Z]+-[0-9]+\");\r\n\r\nvar sort = \"?attachmentSortBy=\"+sortBy+\"&attachmentOrder=\"+direction+\"#attachmentmodule\";\r\nif(patt.test(origUrl) && !JSON.parse(sessionStorage.getItem('hasReloaded' + key))){\r\n\tlocation.assign(origUrl + sort);\r\n\tsessionStorage.setItem('hasReloaded' + key, 'true');\r\n} else {\r\n    sessionStorage.setItem('hasReloaded' + key, 'false');\r\n}</script>{code}\r\n\r\nThis will automatically switch to sorting by Date Ascending. You can tweak it to suit your needs. \r\n(i) *This will only work for JIRA server installations. JIRA Cloud [does not support|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRA-27864] inserting custom code into the announcement banner.*\r\n\r\nIf you are on cloud, or are an individual user that wants to have this functionality without inserting it for everyone, you can use the user script: [^JIRA Order Attachments by Date.user.js] within [Tampermonkey|https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en] for Chrome, or [Greasemonkey|https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/] for Firefox.",

Depending on the issue type selected I want to be able to display a different list of values for a field called Area. So for example if Marketing is the issue type, Area would have the vlaues Market Problem, Competitive Landscape and Technology Assessment, but if the Issue type is Strategy the Aread field would have the values Market Definition, Distribution Strategy...\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nRuchi",
