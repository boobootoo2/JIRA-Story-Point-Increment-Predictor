Environment\r\nJira service desk\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n#  Create a service desk project with more than 50 Customers \r\n# runt the rest api call https://<instance>.atlassian.net/rest/servicedeskapi/servicedesk/<projeci_id>/customer?start=0&limit=100&size=100\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nResults returned with a limit of 100 and a size of 100\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nResults returned with a limit of 50 and size of 50 ignoring that set parameters\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\nUse the \"start\" parameter to get the next batch of 50.\r\nSo for Example, first time run the code below to get first 50:\r\n{code}https://<instance>.atlassian.net/rest/servicedeskapi/servicedesk/<projeci_id>/customer?start=0&limit=50&size=50\r\n{code}\r\nThe second time run the code  below to get 51 to 100\r\n{code}https://<instance>.atlassian.net/rest/servicedeskapi/servicedesk/<projeci_id>/customer?start=51&limit=50&size=50\r\n{code}",

Suggested Solution\r\nIt would be great to have Automation in conjunction with the Approval process stream line the approval process. Similar to the functionality in [JIRA Checklist| https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1211562/checklist-for-jira?hosting=cloud&tab=overview]. That allows a checklist of subtask to be managed by the agents/managers and update the parent task to notify the customer.\r\n",

      "description": "*Update from Atlassian Team 07/03/21*\r\n Hey all, I have disappointing news for all of you. This work has been paused in order to focus on performance improvements and other accessibility initiatives. We still believe this is still highly important work and we understand the impact this is having on some of our customers. Unfortunately we do not have an estimate on when it will resume. This is a hard update to make as it comes after the 4 year anniversary of this ticket; nonetheless, we want to ensure that all of you are informed.\r\n\r\nThis change in direction has been made centrally in our Design System which will lead to improvements across many properties, but in the meantime it affects Jira\u2019s ability to roll out dark mode directly. That doesn\u2019t remove the sting of this for those of us who are passionate about dark mode, but know that the decision from our leaders was made with the customer in mind. When Design System has capacity to pick this up again, myself or whoever owns the work at the time will update all of you - Jake\r\n\r\n\r\n*Suggestion:*\u00a0Suggesting a simple, built-in dark theme that can be enabled from Settings. Simple colour scheme change to make it easier on the eyes.",
