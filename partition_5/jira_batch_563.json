Start-up:\r\n # The internally-hosted application (Jira, Confluence, Bitbucket, Bamboo) creates an outbound connection to the DMZ-hosted gateway application. This connection is used as a control channel for passing data between the two applications.\r\n ## The control channel provides proxy details (IP address and port mappings) to the gateway.\r\n ## The gateway starts up listeners on the designated IPs and ports for incoming traffic.\r\n\r\nh3. Reverse proxy mode:\r\n # When an external application connects to a listener on the DMZ-hosted gateway, the gateway makes a request over the control channel to the application in the internal network.\r\n # The internally-hosted application then creates a new outbound data channel to the gateway.\r\n ## This data channel is attached to service (e.g. HTTP/s) and all traffic for that session is routed over this data channel.\r\n ## When the session is terminated, the corresponding data channel is removed.\r\n\r\nh3. Forward proxy mode:\r\n # When the internally-hosted application needs to make an outbound connection, a request is made to gateway with the address of the intended destination.\r\n # The gateway establishes the connection to the destination and bridges it to the requesting application.\r\n ## The bridge does not reveal the identity or locations of the internal systems.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\n-CET",

Issue Summary\r\nAPI [documentation|https://docs.atlassian.com/software/jira/docs/api/REST/8.5.8/#api/2/issue/\\{issueIdOrKey}/subtask-moveSubTasks] mentions 'reordering subtasks' as doable with API. The [suggestion ticket|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-29933] closed as 'Won't do'. WADL documentation (attached) shows the same - as in doable. \r\n\r\nDocumentation needs clarify on the schema:\r\n\r\n- From the document \r\n{quote}\r\nReorders an issue's subtasks by moving the subtask at index \"from\" to index \"to\".\r\n{quote}\r\nHere, it's not sure what is meant by _index from_ to _index to_. The schema doesn't say anything about index or any _from_/_to_.\r\n- Here is the schema for request payload as per the document.\r\n !screenshot-1.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\n- The latest API documentation [https://docs.atlassian.com/software/jira/docs/api/REST/8.5.8/#api/2/issue/{issueIdOrKey}/subtask-getSubTasks] gives only one parameter which doesn't really give option for changing the order:\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Install a Jira instance - version >7.2 and above.\r\n# Create a project, a task and add a few subtasks under that task. \r\n# Run API with the schema as mentioned above (refer document for more details).\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n- There's example for other resources in the document. For instance, under api/2/issueLink, you can see an example which is missing in our case (move-subtask). Following is example from issueLink:\r\n\r\n !screenshot-2.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nNo example provided in the schema and it will be good have a clarity on _index from_ to _index to_ mentioned in the document.\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nThe correct payload structure would be: \r\n{code:json}\r\n{\"original\":x,\"current\":y}\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nwith the parameters: \r\n|| original | the \"from\" position of the subtask |\r\n|| x | the element in an array list | \r\n|| current | the \"to\" position of the subtask | \r\n|| y | the element in an array list |  \r\n\r\nFor example: \r\n{code}\r\n{\"original\":0,\"current\":10}\r\n{code}\r\nwill be the action to move subtask at the top to the 11th on the list\r\n",

Issue Description\r\n\r\nIn the [Jira Supported Platforms|https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiraserver/supported-platforms-938846830.html] page, we mention that we supported the following Java versions:\r\n{quote}Oracle JRE / JDK:\r\n - Java 8\r\n - Java 11\r\n\r\nOpenJDK:\r\n - Java 8\r\n - Java 11{quote}\r\nSo, based on this page, the latest Jira version\u00a0is formally compatible with any sub version of AdoptOpenJDK 11 (11.0.2, ..., 11.0.8, 11.0.9, etc...).\r\n\r\nHowever, since AdoptOpenJDK is a JDK provided by a 3rd party, Jira can be prone to issues caused by this JDK. For example, we've had 2 bugs that have been reported so far, and which were known to be caused by some sub versions of AdoptOpenJDK 11\r\n - High CPU usage from IO Dispatcher threads when using Java 11, which is resolved when upgrading AdoptOpenJDK to 11.0.8 or a higher version\r\n - When Jira is running against Java 11, TLS 1.3 requests can cause httpclient threads to become blocked, which is resolved when upgrading AdoptOpenJDK to 11.0.8 or a higher version\r\n\r\nFor this reason, it would be great if we could list on the Jira supported page any known issue with some versions of AdoptOpenJDK, so that customers are aware of them before they decide to use Jira with AdoptOpenJDK.\r\nh3. Suggestions\r\n\r\nThere are a few suggestions we can think of:\r\nh3. Suggestion 1\r\n\r\nAdd a *known issues* section next to the supported Java versions, listing all the known problems found so far, similarly to what is already done on the [Confluence Supported Platforms page|https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/supported-platforms-207488198.html].\r\nh3. Suggestion 2\r\n\r\nIn the documentation [Bundled Tomcat and Java versions in Jira|https://confluence.atlassian.com/jiracore/bundled-tomcat-and-java-versions-1013854250.html], add a new column *Tested JREs*, similarly to what is done in [Bundled Tomcat and Java versions in Confluence|https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/bundled-tomcat-and-java-versions-1005786018.html], so that our customers know what versions are reliable.",

It is also difficult when the ticket is at the bottom in the list.\r\n\r\n*Proposal*: Is it possible to add field like Priority value and based on value ticket will move up or down automatically.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nBhuvanesh Gomase",
