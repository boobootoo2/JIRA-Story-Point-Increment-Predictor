Problem Definition\r\n\r\nWhen using the quick search to search for strings containing only numbers, instead of performing the search, JIRA will try to access an issue using the number string as the issue number.

      "description": "h3. Problem Definition\r\nThe documentation about events within JIRA does not make it very clear when JIRA System Events will be fired vs workflow events.  Specifically, Issue Updated and Issue Assigned are not fired when a workflow is making those changes:\r\n[Adding a custom event - Atlassian Documentation|https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiraserver073/adding-a-custom-event-861253643.html]\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nBased on my testing locally with the DebugListener it appears that:\r\n* The JIRA built-in system events (full list [here|https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiraserver073/adding-a-custom-event-861253643.html]) are only fired if the action is not performed by a workflow transition.\r\n* *Issue updated* takes precedent over the other events in the case of editing an issue or automation based changes.\r\n* *Issue assigned* is only fired if the *assign* button is clicked or keyboard shortcut is used, not if the assignee is altered in workflow transitions, edits, or ticket creation\r\n* *Issue commented* is fired only when a comment is made outside of a workflow transition or other change\r\n* *Issue resolved* appears to be an outlier here and does get called regardless of what action triggered the resolution to be set\r\n\r\nSo the basic rule of thumb seems to be that if more than one action is performed, then the event that encompasses the entire action is used, with *Issue resolved* being the exception.  With Service Desk Automation or other 3rd party automation/scripting solutions you may see more events generated.\r\n \r\nh3. Workaround\r\n Use the DebugListerner to test your workflow and determine which events are firing:\r\n* [Listeners - Atlassian Documentation|https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiraserver073/listeners-867028226.html]",

Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n# As Bob, in Confluence,\r\n## Create a page that is accessible by any logged-in user. Call it something like \"Logged-in test\".\r\n## Create a page that only bob can access. Call it \"Page by Bob\".\r\n# As Bob, in JIRA,\r\n## Create a new issue in the public project.\r\n## Link to both the \"Logged-in test\" page and the \"Page by Bob\" page.\r\n# Log out of JIRA.\r\n# View the issue as an anonymous user.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected results\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\nh3.

Workaround\r\n\r\nEnable the \"{{confluence.issuelinks.use.rest.api.disabled}}\" dark feature for the JIRA instance. This will cause JIRA to use XMLRPC to communicate with Confluence.

Everything goes perfect, however when it comes to text formatting, I get back the Confluence wiki notation format. I was wondering, if there's any processor, with which I could convert it to excel's rich text format for example. I'll need to import the data to Doors, that part is easy, however processing the Confluence wiki notation takes way to much effort to write, and I suppose I'm not the only one who has to do this.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for the help",

Summary\r\nIf a user has a JIRA issue open in the browser, and they are idle long enough for their user session to expire, they will see an indefinite browser hang when attempting to comment on the issue.\r\n\r\nh3. Environment\r\nTested against JIRA 7.2.8 and JIRA 7.2.9 using current versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, IE and Edge on Windows, Linux and Mac. Behavior occurs in all contexts.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n- [Change the default session timeout|https://confluence.atlassian.com/jira063/changing-the-default-session-timeout-683542392.html] to 5 minutes and restart JIRA.\r\n- Authenticate to a user and navigate to an issue.\r\n- Allow 5 minutes to elapse and the user session to timeout.\r\n- Click the *Comment* button.\r\n\r\nh3. Observed Results\r\nOne of two behaviors will happen, and it is hit-or-miss as to which will be observed:\r\n# The user will experience a spinning cursor which will never resolve; an indefinite hang. The user will need to reload the page and reauthenticate to add a comment.\r\n# The user will be able to enter a comment, but upon clicking the *Add* button they will experience the spinning cursor and indefinite hang. The user will need to reload the page and reauthenticate to be able to add a comment.\r\n\r\nAgain, this is hit-or-miss. The latter behavior appears more often in IE/Edge in my testing.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nInstead of experiencing the hang, users should be prompted to authenticate before commenting.

      "description": "Hello,\r\n\r\nWe currently have users asking to not be notified when they are the one who updates a ticket. After working with our\u00a0IT and digging into your documentation ([https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiracloud/creating-a-notification-scheme-776636401.html)]\u00a0we found there is no \"Updater\" Role.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nIt also appears there may not be a concept of exclusion. That is, even if the \"Updater\" role was created, logic doesn't exist to explicitly\u00a0Exclude that user from that notification; logic only appears to include users. Is this true?\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nIs it possible to both add an \"Updater\" Role & to allow for users/roles be excluded from mail notifications they would otherwise receive?\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nZH\r\n\r\n\u00a0",

This is a problem because we need to convert the ApplicationUser to a User object, but it's not always a one-to-one mapping here. Sometimes there a user has multiple mapping keys. \r\n\r\nHere is an exception that can be thrown.\r\n{code}\r\nCaused by: java.lang.IllegalStateException: User 'mathias.edblom@riada.se' has no unique key mapping.\r\n\tat com.atlassian.jira.user.ApplicationUsers.from(ApplicationUsers.java:46)\r\n{code}\r\n\u00a0\r\nand this causing the filtering to fail completely. If you have any workaround for this, please let me know.\r\n\r\nAlso, why are you still using till Guava function (google) instead of Java Function? Please change this as well. \r\n\r\nFor any developer using this API (which I guess is many) the old \"User\" class is a pain....\r\n\r\nThanks & Cheers //Mathias",

Issue Summary\r\n\r\nWhen a user uses JIRA with McAfee VirusScan, at times, they still experience major performance degradation if the Antivirus is enabled even after following our guide [here|https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirakb/anti-virus-in-jira-applications-398393384.html].\r\n\r\nh5. Feature Request\r\n\r\nCan a section be added to this document for users who use McAfee VirusScan so they are aware that there is a need to still set the following processes _tomcat8.exe.x64_ and _mysqld.exe_ as low security level because this is the only condition where the changes made to the page would work properly as stated by our customer here:\r\n{quote}\r\nof course. We are using McAfee VirusScan and we had to define the processes \u201cmysqld.exe\u201d and \u201ctomcat8.exe.x64\u201d as low security processes. This then applied the defined folder exclusions for the folders specified in your guide correctly.\r\n\r\nWhen the processes were not specifically defined as such low security processes but instead treated as standard processes, the exclusions for all standard processes did not seem to work. McAfee did not acknowledge this behavior, however we are able to reproduce it by changing the process category.\r\n{quote}",
