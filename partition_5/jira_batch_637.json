When he logs work, JIRA would log the work as john02. \r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\nOnce the username has changed, then all existing worklogs have to be updated to the new name and all future worklogs must be done in the new username. \r\n\r\nh3. Why this is important\r\nThis could cause confusion to anyone analyzing the data directly from the DB and give them incorrect results.  \r\n",

Summary\r\nJIRA's Form Submit Keyboard shortcut in Firefox doesn't work as expected when Structure plugin is installed. Shortcut to the JIRA Menu dropdown such as Dashboards/Projects/Issues uses \"Alt + Shift + <first letter>\" which translates to \"Alt + Shift + D/P/I\". Structure is a third-party plugin that uses the same concept but this collides with existing \"Form Submit\" keyboard shortcut in Firefox on Windows.\r\n\r\nh3. Environment\r\n * JIRA 6.x, 7.2.7\r\n * Strucuter installed (version earlier than 4.1)\r\n * Firefox browser\r\n * Windows OS\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Go to an issue\r\n # Try to add a comment\r\n # Use \"Alt + Shift + S\" to submit comment\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nThe comment will be added correctly with the shortcut\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nThe shortcut highlights the Structure menu on top\r\nh3. Notes\r\n\r\nThe same \"Form Submit\" shortcut works correctly on Chrome's Mac OS, where the same method is being used trying to highlight the Top Menu and Submitting a form (Ctrl + Alt/Option + S). It will submit the comment when the Comment Box is triggered, and when not, highlight the \"Structure\" menu.\r\n\r\nh3.

      "description": "Currently within the doc [Migrating JIRA applications to another server - Atlassian Documentation|https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiraserver073/migrating-jira-applications-to-another-server-861253107.html] has the steps of:\r\n{quote}\r\n3.6 Import your old data into your new JIRA applications\r\n\r\nAfter you have started your new JIRA installation you should be logged in to your JIRA application, and ready to import the data from your old instance into the new instance. You will need the backup file of data from your old JIRA that you created earlier in these instructions ( above).\r\n\r\nTo import your old JIRA data into your new JIRA:\r\n\r\n# Log in as a user with the 'JIRA System Administrators' global permission.\r\n# Select Administration > System > Import & Export > Restore System (tab) to open the 'Restore JIRA data from Backup' page.\r\n# In the File name field, specify the XML backup file you created previously during the export process (above). That zipped file should contain two xml files: activeobjects.xml and entities.xml. Both of these files must be included in the zipped file for the import process to work.\r\n# Restore the attachments directory that you backed up previously, into the attachments directory of your new JIRA. (See Restoring data.)\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (info) Avoid passing through a proxy when performing an XML restore, especially if your JIRA instance is very large. Using a proxy may cause timeout errors. \r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nBut this is not actually what happens here.  If you follow all these step up to this point, when you start JIRA, you won't actually be logged into JIRA at all (how could you, the database is totally empty at this point).  When you start JIRA with an empty data as was the steps of this doc, you start JIRA in the initial setup wizard.  From here you can actually click the link for 'import existing data' and then simply select the XML backup here to restore.\r\n\r\nThat part is a minor difference but I would like to clarify that first.   In order to follow the steps in the current guide, you would need to create a new admin account and finish the initial setup wizard of JIRA before you can gain access to the System -> Restore data option.  Which is just misleading.\r\n\r\nAlso there is a bigger problem with following these steps if you are also upgrading JIRA at this time.  If you follow these current steps, and JIRA is upgraded to a new version where the naming convention of attachments has changed (I know it has happened between 6.4 and 7.0, and again in 7.2), then following these steps will result in your previous attachments in JIRA being inaccessible to you in the new instance because the database references for these files in the {{fileattachments}} table get updated with the new naming convention when the XML import happens, but the actual flat files themselves are not in place in order for JIRA to rename them yet.  Leaving the customer with broken attachments that are actually a pain to fix and additional support cases waiting to happen.\r\n\r\n\r\nInstead I would recommend these steps:\r\n\r\n\r\n{panel:borderStyle=dashed| borderColor=#3C78B5| titleBGColor=#3C78B5| bgColor=#E7F4FA}\r\n\r\n3.6 Import your old data into your new JIRA applications\r\n\r\nAfter you have started your new JIRA installation you will notice that JIRA will launch its initial setup wizard.   This happens anytime JIRA starts with an empty database.  From here you can import your backup file in order to populate your XML backup data into your new empty database. You will need the backup file of data from your old JIRA that you created earlier in these instructions ( above).\r\n\r\nTo import your old JIRA data into your new JIRA:\r\n\r\n# Restore the attachments directory that you backed up previously, into the attachments directory of your new JIRA. (See Restoring data.)\r\n# Start JIRA\r\n# In the setup wizard select the option for 'Import existing data'\r\n# In the File name field, specify the XML backup file you created previously during the export process (above). That zipped file should contain two xml files: activeobjects.xml and entities.xml. Both of these files must be included in the zipped file for the import process to work.\r\n    (info) Avoid passing through a proxy when performing an XML restore, especially if your JIRA instance is very large. Using a proxy may cause timeout errors.  \r\n{panel}\r\n\r\nSteps 5 and 6 on that doc should be unchanged.\r\n",

If not then you need to specifiy the password for the private key *6)\r\n1) Create CSR and private key on your linux box:\r\nopenssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout private.key -out request.csr -subj \"/C=na/ST=None/L=None/O=None/CN=None\"\r\n2) Create certificate with the generated CSR for your domain. (in StartSSL go to \"Certificates Wizard\", paste the generated CSR for your domain and submit. Download and extract the certificate and CA Chain.)\r\n3) Create PFX file from certificate (step 2), private key (step 1) and Certificate Chain (step 2 - root bundle or intermediate cert depending on CA):\r\nopenssl pkcs12 -export -out <PFX-filename>.pfx -inkey private.key -in <your-certificate>.crt -certfile <CA-chain-file>.crt\r\n(you can use the same password for the PFX file as for the private key to make things easier - we won't need the PFX file later and can destroy it)\r\nThe output should read like this:\r\n>Enter pass phrase for private.key:\r\n>Enter Export Password:\r\n>Verifying - Enter Export Password:\r\n4) Convert the PFX into a Java keystore. In your JRE bin directory on your linux box execute:\r\n./keytool -importkeystore -srckeystore <PFX-filename>.pfx -destkeystore <new-keystore-file>.keystore -srcstoretype PKCS12 -deststoretype JKS\r\nIMPORTANT: Use the SAME PASSWORD for the keystore as for the private key from step 1)! otherwise see *6)\r\nThe output should read like this:\r\n>Enter destination keystore password:\r\n>Re-enter new password:\r\n>Enter source keystore password:\r\n>Entry for alias 1 successfully imported.\r\n>Import command completed:  1 entries successfully imported, 0 entries failed or cancelled\r\n5)Edit your server.xml, uncomment the <Connector port=\"8443> and point the keystore entry to your <new-keystore>.keystore and supply the keystore password from step 1. (keystoreFile=\"<new-keystore>.keystore\" keystorePass=\"<password from step 1>\")\r\n*6) If you want to set different passwords for the private key and the keystore then you have to:\r\n./keytool -keypasswd -keystore /path/to/keyestore.file -alias <alias-in-keystore>\r\nIf you're not sure about the alias: ./keytool -list -keystore <name-of-keystore>\r\n*7) Alternative to creating a PFX file including the CA chain file:\r\n./keytool -importcert -alias startssl-CA-chain -keystore <path-to-atlassian-directory>/jre/lib/security/cacerts -file <CA Chain Cert in PEM format>.crt\r\n{quote} ",

In this case, the deleted option is part of a not-equals operation, so we can safely assume that everything is not-equal to it. In other words, interpret it as the following:\r\n{quote}(assignee = currentuser() OR watcher = currentuser() OR reporter = currentuser()) AND status != Done AND (*TRUE* OR customer is EMPTY)\r\n{quote}\r\nThis kind of fallback logic may not always be so obvious to calculate, but it would be useful when you can. It also shouldn\u2019t hurt anything, as (so far as I know) filters only apply to data searching/filtering/display. The worst case is that the fallback logic gets something wrong and displays too few items (which is still more useful than displaying none) or too many (which shouldn\u2019t harm anything, as I hope JIRA\u2019s permissions system (assuming one exists) doesn\u2019t go through the filter engine).

The text is in the page and so are the edit tools. Only ajax request should be on updating it.\r\n * Trying to change assignee on an issue would load the users list via Ajax request. Why not cache this in localstorage?\r\n\r\nThere are many more occasions where needless requests are made and the system thus responds much slower than needed. Perhaps it becomes more evident on the cloud _service_ which is obviously overloaded.

No icon appears on the sidebar and message \"Unable to render element due to an error\" appears on the top of the sidebar. Users have to refresh few times to get the sidebar loaded properly.\r\n\r\n*Fix notes*: BigPipe is our latest invention separating request from actual rendering. For example - it allows us to render issues faster and then sidebar at the end. However as this technology is used outside of server Jira too it contains timeout feature. Timeout is calculated from the beginning of the request, so when the whole request is too long, the pipe will give up on rendering. Fix removes this timeout for Jira.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\nN/A as this happens intermittently for some customers\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nThe issue details and sidebar are displayed without any error\r\n\r\nh3.

If negative entries could be entered we would see on dashboard how many hours are left on the budget bu calculating spent time + negative budget.

Problem Definition\r\nUnlicensed users are not able to receive notifications for JIRA Software and JIRA Core. As other customers report, this used to work in the past. But while taking multiple tests into Cloud Instances (this was only tested with Cloud).\r\n\r\nTo test that you can:\r\n# Create a user without any application access\r\n# Create a notification scheme that includes this user (we tested by allowing browse projects permission and notification through a user custom field and also through watchers field)\r\n# Add user to that issue as a watcher or using a custom field\r\n# Make sure the user has browse permission access to that issue\r\n# Try to generate notification\r\n# No Notification is sent, neither information is thrown on outgoing mail log\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\nAllow this type of user to receive notifications.\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Why this is important\r\nThere are use cases when users need to receive only mail notifications and will not need to use JIRA internal functionalities, this is demanding this kind of users to consume a license only to receive e-mails.\r\n \r\nh3. Workaround \r\nSend the notification to a single email address, without creating the user with no application access. \r\nThis should work since JRA-63395 has been fixed.",

Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Create a brand new JIRA SD 3.3.0 instance\r\n# Create a new Service Desk - using the IT template\r\n# Create an agent and customer\r\n# Create an issue as the customer through the portal\r\n# Transition back and forth using comments only until the issue falls into the incorrect status\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nThe ticket will transition correctly after a comment is added.\r\n\r\nh3.

Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Install JIRA 6.2.7\r\n# Create a Project to have active and inactive workflows\r\n# Create additional workflows if needed (Please note this is an optional step as the problem can be reproduced with vanilla workflows)\r\n# Check how workflows are displayed\r\n# Perform an upgrade to 7.2.2\r\n# Check how workflows are displayed\r\n\r\n\r\nh2.

Actual Results\r\nThe workflows are displayed in an totally different way compared to how they were displayed before the upgrade.  The more complex the workflows are the more difficult to understand them is, as some statuses will overlap with other statuses and transitions.\r\n\r\nh2. Workaround\r\nThe only workaround is to manually organize each affected workflow.\r\n\r\n*It is also important to note that following the upgrade path 6.2 >> 6.3 (latest release) >> 6.4 (latest release) >> 7.0 (latest release) >>7.2.2 (latest release) this issue can be avoided as workflows are displayed as they were originally organized when they were created*",
