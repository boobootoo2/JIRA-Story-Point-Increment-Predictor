If external source contains worktime records (ExternalWorklog class in plugin), Jira imports worktime correctly (the Work Log tab contains correct records). However, it also adds History items, each for every ExternalWorklog item. These History items contain wrong dates: the dates of import, but not the dates of work log items. It is interesting, that the user that logged worktime is set to correct value, but the date of the change is incorrect.\r\n\r\nI propose to switch off History while adding worktime records during import. The import script cannot guess when the worktime record was added to external source, so it should just ignore the change and leave it to the plugin to decide.\r\n\r\nSetting the history item date to the date of the import when the importer cannot guess is a bad and misleading practice.

Solution \r\n\r\nIn JIRA Core or Service desk project if we add version to the project then we can have the release tab. \r\nSo maybe we can provide steps to add versions before screenshot then it leads to less confusion.\r\n",

Summary\r\nIn previous versions of JIRA, the most recent selected tab when editing a transition would be remembered upon re-opening the transition or opening new browser tabs to edit other transitions while in the same session. Currently, when clicking on a transition to edit it, the Triggers tab is automatically selected regardless of previous selection. When performing an action on a different tab, the page is then refreshed and is back on the Triggers tab. This causes inconvenience when performing changes to multiple transitions, or performing multiple changes on a different tab.\r\n\r\nh3. Environment\r\n* v7.1.0-OD-02-030\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Edit a Workflow\r\n# Click on a transition to Edit it\r\n# Select a different tab on this page, for example Conditions\r\n# Navigate back to the Edit Workflow page\r\n# Attempt to re-open the same Transition to edit it, or open a new Transition to Edit\r\n# Each time a new transition is opened up, the Triggers tab is selected by default\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nThe most recent selected tab should be remembered when navigating to other transitions or re-opening transitions.

(I don't even want to tell you how many... ) I've also tried a few other tutorials for Confluence and JIRA and zero luck. I see the same issue with all of them. I'm not sure if there's an issue with how I've setup my dev environment (I'm completely new to JIRA/Confluence development and followed the instructions on how to install the SDK and recommended version of Java, etc.) I have started to see other people posting comments saying that they also cannot get the tutorials to work either, so I'm reaching out for help. For the errors I'm encountering, there is not enough explanation given in the tutorials to understand what is going wrong. If this turns out to be something on my end, I would suggest adding a better explanation of what exactly the plugin creation command generates and how to create these resources without using the auto-generate command.\r\n\r\nHere are the details on what's going wrong: \r\n\r\nWhen I run atlas-run to open JIRA and test the plugin, the Helloworld plugin is disabled. I try to enable it manually and get the following error:\r\n\r\nERROR admin .... /rest/plugins/1.0/com.atlassian.tutorial.helloworld-key [c.a.p.osgi.factory.OsgiPluginInstalledHelper] Cannot determine required plugins, cannot resolve bundle 'com.atlassian.tutorial.helloworld'\r\n\r\nAfter that initial error, it keeps trying to load, and then I finally get a timeout error and the plugin does not load:\r\n\r\nERROR admin ... /rest/plugins/1.0/com.atlassian.tutorial.helloworld-key [c.a.plugin.manager.PluginEnabler] Unable to start the following plugins due to timeout while waiting for plugin to enable: com.atlassian.tutorial.helloworld\r\n\r\nIt looks like the files generated from the atlas-create-jira-plugin-module command do not yield the same files in the completed version of the tutorial hosted at https://bitbucket.org/atlassian_tutorial/helloworld.git\r\n\r\nRunning atlas-create-jira-plugin-module yields: \r\nsrc/main/java/com/atlassian/tutorial/helloworld/api/MyPluginComponent.java\r\nsrc/main/java/com/atlassian/tutorial/helloworld/impi/MyPluginComponent.java\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the Bitbucket code has:\r\nsrc/main/java/com/atlassian/tutorial/helloworld/MyPlugin.java\r\n\r\nI'm not sure how to resolve this.

It would be very helpful if this description were also displayed when roles are managed since it helps the administrators to identify were users should go,\r\n\r\nWe need additional roles but want to limit the number of them by naming then in a generic way (e.g. \"Custom Role 1\") and instead use some more explanatory text in the description.\r\nSince there is still no possibility to define project specific roles we think this is a good way to go in a large environment with almost 1000 projects.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nDieter",

Suggested Solution\r\n* Provide a way to disable this popup - either on a global level (which would apply to all users and all dashboards)\r\n* or *preferably* as a personal setting (either made available under manage dashboards area or profile area); Or perhaps a \"don't notify me again\" option for each dashboard.",

Upon startup (PluginEnabledEvent) our add-on installs multiple custom fields. It matches those custom fields by ID as we store this ID the first time a custom field is created.\r\n\r\nJIRA caches all custom field objects as they are accessed but, if the Custom Field Type is not available, JIRA still caches these custom fields as CacheObject.NULL. All the following requests for a custom field in these conditions will return null. \r\n\r\nSome add-ons, will load all custom fields upon startup (e.g PluginEnabledEvent) using, for instance, the method CustomFieldManager#getCustomFieldObjects().\r\n\r\nIf one of these add-ons is enabled before our add-on, it will cache all our custom fields as NULL. Hence, when our add-on is enabled, the custom fields searched by ID return NULL leading the add-on to install them again, creating duplicated custom fields.\r\n\r\nThis behaviour only applies when JIRA is restarted.\r\n\r\nWe have found that this problem is affecting other add-ons as well that, just like us, are checking if their custom fields are installed using the ID.\r\n\r\nOur current fix is clearing the custom fields cache when the add-on is enabled.\r\n\r\nHope this get's fixed ASAP.

However, we aren't given information of velocity value per member of the team.\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\nThe velocity Charts should also include velocity value based on number of members.

We know the workaround is to apply another license and reapply the valid license:\r\n    1. Get another license such as an evaluation, no matter if it is valid or expired. \r\n    2. Apply it using Manage AddOn of JIRA  \r\n    3. Reapply your commercial license. \r\n\r\nI remember you have handled already some cases. Here is the last case we get from customer. \r\nhttps://support.atlassian.com/servicedesk/customer/portal/5/CA-234744\r\nwho complains the capability of the support since he is kept between us:\r\n   1. Our support said \"The license manage is managed by JIRA, it is out of our control. You should contact the Support of Atlassian\".\r\n   2. Your support said \"it is the third-part, you should contact the support of plugin vendor\". \r\n(we have no permission to access it. this why I create a new one).\r\n \r\nHe has reasonably requested we fixed the problem and prevent this infinit loop. \r\n\r\n*We think our both support teams should work closely once there is a problem with our Plugin. We should get notified when a ticket is created with our plugin.*\r\n\r\nOf course, we should work with Atlassian developper team to fix this problem definitively. This is why I have created a bug here:\r\nhttps://ecosystem.atlassian.net/browse/ATLASSDK-19\r\n",

That means that if the catch email is set to user@domain.com and an email is sent to User@domain.com, this email will be rejected, as the catch email won't match.\r\n\r\nThough this is correct according to the RFC 2821, several email servers don't consider this part case sensitive. \r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\nMake JIRA Catch Email completely case insensitive. \r\n\r\nh3. Workaround \r\nYou have have several version or emails addresses with different cases that are used, add a handler with a different catch email for each.

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-47628].\n  {panel}\n\nWe have a Team in our organization that has a use case for managing permissions at a sub-project level (the term sub-project is being used loosely here - for their purposes it could be a component or a version, etc.).\r\n\r\nSupposing there are user bases UB1 and UB2 (a set of users/groups/project roles), and sub-projects SB1 and SB2, and a hypothetical mapping that we have such that UB1 maps to SB1 and UB2 maps to SB2 - is it possible for us to set up permissions at the sub-project level such that users in UB1 would only see issues that correspond to SB1 and users in UB2 only see issues that correspond to SB2?\r\n\r\nWe would then want to extrapolate this such that one user base could map to multiple sub-projects and one sub-project could be accessible (i.e., the issues that correspond to the sub-project would be accessible) to multiple user bases and so on.\r\n\r\n----\r\nWe have investigated the possibility of achieving this by using issue-level security in conjunction with JJUPIN scripts and have found that too complex and hard to maintain, especially with respect to scale. We have also investigated the [Issue Type Filter plugin|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/net.youngaweb.jira.issue-type-ui-filter/server/overview], but found that it does not suit our purposes since our objective is not to limit a user base to a particular issue type, rather to create any issue type, but limit other users from seeing the created issues.\r\n----\r\nThus, we were wondering if JIRA offered any way for us to have permission management at a component (sub-project) level such that visibility/management of issues could be controlled at that level as opposed to at a Project level. Or would the official recommendation in this case be to just create separate Projects for each of our sub-projects?\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\n",
