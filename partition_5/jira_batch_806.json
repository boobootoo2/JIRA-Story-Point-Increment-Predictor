      "description": "h3. Summary\r\n\r\nWhen submitting a request to JIRA, if this contains both basic auth an a session cookie ({{JSESSIONID}}), JIRA will log in that user again, however will reuse the existing session.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n# Create a new admin session by logging in.\r\n# Create an issue.\r\n# Extract the JSESSIONID from one of the HTTP responses.\r\n# Check the session in the *User Sesssions* section.\r\n# Submit a GET to an issue, with basic auth (ie Authorization header) and the JSESSIONID. This was done with:\r\n{noformat}\r\ncurl -L http://jira-url:8080/jira/browse/ABC-1 -H 'Cookie: JSESSIONID=<session cookie>' -u admin:admin\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nJIRA does not log in again (ie the basic auth is ignored).\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nJIRA does login again, as can be seen below:\r\n\r\nOriginal login:\r\n\r\n{noformat}\r\n2016-02-19 12:13:08,474 http-nio-60710-exec-21 admin 733x1224x1 - 172.22.49.28 /browse/WITI-75 The user 'admin' has PASSED authentication.\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nSubmitting the GET:\r\n\r\n{noformat}\r\n2016-02-19 12:20:22,358 http-nio-60710-exec-17 admin 740x1374x1 - 172.22.49.28 /browse/WITI-75 The user 'admin' has PASSED authentication.\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nh3. Notes\r\n\r\nThis can create significant problems if requests are used that submits the {{Authorization}} header and also the {{JSESSIONID}} session cookie, as large amounts of requests will be constantly logging in. If using LDAP, this will create additional load on that server, and can result in production outages due to significant spikes in memory and CPU usage.\r\n\r\nI was not able to locate a RFC on this, so this may actually not be a bug and rather a suggestion to alter JIRA for this behaviour. I'm not sure why a client would ever submit both.\r\n\r\nRFC's reviewed:\r\n\r\n* [HTTP State Management Mechanism|https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6265].\r\n* [HTTP Authentication: Basic and Digest Access Authentication|https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2617.txt].\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nIt's possible to strip the {{Authorization}} header on a reverse-proxy if the session cookie exists. For example in Apache:\r\n\r\n{code}\r\nSetEnvIfNoCase Cookie ^(.*)JSESSIONID(.*)lin$ ALREADY_AUTH\r\nRequestHeader unset Authorization env=ALREADY_AUTH\r\n{code}",

Click the checkbox. The request will show up in Charles's breakpoint view.\r\n* On the same issue, type in a comment and click \"Add\". The 2nd request will show up in Charles' breakpoint view. Click Execute on this 2nd request. The comment appears on your issue.\r\n* Now click Execute on the 1st request. The changed Priority appears on the issue, but the comment disappears. (!)\r\n* Reload the page and both the changed Priority and the added Comment are visible.\r\n\r\nNetwork latency can cause this to happen in real world usage. We should implement inline edit in such a way that the order of received responses does not affect what eventually gets shown (after all responses are in).\r\n\r\ncc [~jcreenaune], [~sharwood]",

This behavior is unwanted if you have users which can fix the filters but doesn't have the necessary grants to query the database.\r\nThis error message should display the name of the filter so the user knows which of their filters needs to be fixed/edited.\r\n\r\nSee attached screen capture.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-28665].\n  {panel}\n\nWe are heavily using the sub-tasks to split work packages for developers and we create hundreds of them. The parent issue is just used as a container to wrap all the sub-tasks. Our problem is that in terms of reporting and managing the work, one would almost certainly only want to look at the parent issue level (either directly at the issue or in a report) but the parent issue does not include any information from the sub-task.\r\n\r\nI imagine this should function like the \"Include Sub-tasks\" feature for Estimates, where you can either just show the values of the parent or the accumulated values of the sub-tasks. Thus the activity log would show for the parent:\r\n\r\nUser ABC commented on ABC-42 - foobar not working\r\nUser XYZ started progress on ABC-42 / ABC-23 - Initial Investigation\r\n...",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-28652].\n  {panel}\n\nHi,\r\n\r\nI'm explaining my issue.\r\n\r\nI've :\r\n\r\n    - several projects: PR1, PR2, PR3\r\n    - several groups of users (dev and manager) which are different for each product: PR1-dev, PR1-management, PR2-dev, PR2-management\r\n\r\nFor each project, I've:\r\n\r\n    - one permission scheme: PR1-permission, PR2-permission\r\n    - one notification schme: PR1-notification, PR2-notification\r\n\r\nPR1-permission and PR2-permission are almost the same.\r\nDifferences are PR1-permission are used with PR1-dev and PR1-management groups. It's the same for PR2 project.\r\n\r\nAnd this is the same for notification (PR1-notification with PR1-dev and PR1-management group).\r\n\r\nSo, I've a lot of permission scheme, and a lot of notification scheme, and a lot of group.\r\n\r\nSO, I maybe, it should be good to have a general notification scheme for permission, notification and group and to be able to use a variable for name of permissions, notifications and group.\r\n\r\nFor exemple, a solution could be:\r\n- in general config, enable or not variable name for permission, notification and group name\r\n- some available variable should be \"project name\", \"key\", ....\r\n- in creation of group, notification scheme or permission scheme, we can use a variable name. For example, <ProjName> would be substituted by the name of the project.\r\n\r\nDon't hesitate to contact me for more explaination :)\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nMickael THIEVENT\r\nSILKAN",

This is all correct.\r\n\r\nHowever, \"mention\" notification e-mails come from the user that executed the mention, which makes e-mail replies go directly back to that user, rather than back to JIRA. This is not desirable behaviour for us \u2013 we would rather that \"mention\" notification e-mails also come from jira@themis.atlassian.net, so that responses go back to the ticket rather than to the individual user.\r\n\r\nThanks.{quote}\r\n\r\nIn sum, I can easily see arguments for both sides of this (i.e. send from the executing user e-mail address vs. send from JIRA's system address).  What I am suggesting is an option that allows you to select one or the other according to your individual use case.\r\n\r\nIn our case, we very much want to keep all of the communication about an issue within JIRA, so that there is a central repository of all information about the issue -- rather than having it scattered around e-mail inboxes.\r\n\r\nObviously we can work around this by never replying to a \"mention\" e-mail, but it'd be much nicer if the \"mention\" e-mail could be replied to and the result was appended to the JIRA issue as a comment.\r\n\r\nThanks!",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-28640].\n  {panel}\n\nHello Atlassian,\r\n\r\nafter asking Atlassian support to create different issue types via email for one project, I was recommended to create an improvement feature here.\r\n\r\nWe would like to have the possibility to define the needed issue type of an issue while creating it via email.\r\n\r\nMy thoughts therefore would be to add another parameter to the email's subject like: \r\n{code}\r\nsubject: [PROJECTKEY|ISSUETYPE-ID] title of issue\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nIf ISSUETYPE-ID is not provided like \\[PROJECTKEY\\] or if the ISSUETYPE-ID is not known in PROJECT a default issue type should be chosen.\r\n\r\nThx for paying attention - perhaps you already got existing solutions or work around to get this working.\r\n\r\nBest wishes\r\nChristopher",

The key difference between the two that I find really frustrating.\r\n\r\n\r\nConsider this scenario. I want to lower to priority of this field using a normal select list. Ordering matters (is critical, in fact) in this case. \r\n\r\nI click on the field.\r\n\r\n!https://img.skitch.com/20120621-k8nxyyjiec39qebkwhennxjhnq.png!\r\n\r\nFor a normal select list, it clearly shows where my current selection is (highlighted). I can easily select the item below or above it. Since the order matters, I also see where in the range of values my select is.\r\n\r\n!https://img.skitch.com/20120621-k51kuddfgmcnq2e5u2mgrm32b4.png!\r\n\r\nFor the Frotherized drop down, you don't see the selected value in the list. You don't know what's above or below the current select value and you need to already know where the value sits in the continuum. The _first_ item on that list is what's selected, which isn't really what you want. From a keytboard shortcut it also doesn't really work.\r\n\r\n\r\nh2. Thoughts on a solution\r\n\r\nThis is a big problem on fields / lists where order is critical (priority fields) and an annoyance on places where order is not critical (e.g. Rapid board drop down in GH, I know the board I care about all start with Bamboo, it'd be _nice_ if that area was highlighted).\r\n\r\n\r\nI understand the heritage of Frother as an auto-complete / type ahead and search replacement,, rather than a select list but if we're going to support having the down arrow on the right and ability to use it like a select list, it really needs to work like one when you click on it.\r\n\r\nI think it would work if:\r\n\r\n* When no text has entered in the input field, onclick or on down arrow, show all values (if the drop arrow mode enabled) with the current value highlighted\r\n* If you start typing in the field, the current behaviour is used. \r\n\r\nThis is a pattern that's starting to repeat itself in a lot of places, and I think we need to seriously look at it from a overall UX perspective.\r\n\r\nMaybe FEF or Design Trunk should look at this to get some consistency?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-28624].\n  {panel}\n\nCurrently we advise a user to go through some steps and is led to one that gets them to do something that isn't useful. In our JIRA044, JIRA050, JIRA051 or JIRA docs:\r\n\r\n# They follow the [create a keystore file|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Running+JIRA+over+SSL+or+HTTPS#RunningJIRAoverSSLorHTTPS-1.\u00a0CreatetheKeystoreFile] and generate a CSR.\r\n# We ask them to [export the certificate|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Running+JIRA+over+SSL+or+HTTPS#RunningJIRAoverSSLorHTTPS-2.ExporttheCertificate] from their keystore.\r\n# We then ask them to [import the certificate into the cacerts trustStore|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Running+JIRA+over+SSL+or+HTTPS#RunningJIRAoverSSLorHTTPS-ImportCertificateIntoTheTruststore]. The truststore is designed for certificate authority (CA) certs (e.g.: godaddy/rapidssl/verisign certs) and should mostly have all of the default CA certs. The only time they would need to do this is if the CA is not already loaded or the CA cert is self-signed. Step 1 gets them to sign a standard certificate, not a CA.\r\n\r\nWe don't need to ask them to do steps 2 & 3 as when the CSR is generated in step 1, it gets automatically imported and by default when Tomcat starts up it will use the keystore generated in step 1 (provided they did it as the correct user). You could remove the section in the attached screenshot as steps 2 and 3 aren't necessary.\r\n\r\nWe also don't warn the user that when using the keytool, it will default to the user's home directory that is running that command - this could lead to problems if they run it as a user that doesn't execute Tomcat. For example:\r\n\r\n# The bundled Linux installer sets up JIRA as the {{jira}} user.\r\n# Tomcat defaults to the {{~jira/.keystore}} file for the user that executes it.\r\n# If a customer generates the keytool as a user other than {{jira}}, it will not put it in {{~jira/.keystore}}, so Tomcat will not have the correct keystore.\r\n\r\nCould you please add something in like the below for step 1:\r\n\r\n(i) On Linux, please ensure this command is run as the user that Tomcat runs on. By default, this is {{jira}} when using the bundled installer.\r\n\r\nAnd also change \"2. Import certificate into the trust store\" so that we're clear that the user only needs to do this step if they have a CA certificate that is not already in cacerts.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you need clarification or anything - thanks! :)",

      "description": "There is a memory leak in Guice 3.0 and before as we embed it in OSGi. We need to update SOY templates to a version of Guice that uses guava r4+ rather than google-collections. Details below.\r\n\r\nSoy template renderer has an embedded copy of Google Guide (rc2?). Google Guice (3.0-rc2 - 3.0) embeds a copy of google collections in {{com.google.inject.internal.util}} (*NOTE*: It runs a transform across these classes during its build so they start with $. For example, MapMaker -> $MapMaker).\r\n\r\nThis version of google-collections is loaded from the OSGi classloader of the plugin. This version of google-collections forks a thread called $Finalizer to remove weak/soft entires from maps created with $MapMaker (which Guice uses internally). The $Finalizer thread needs to be shutdown automatically when no longer used. It does this by listening when the OSGi classloader is destroyed (though Weak/Phantom references) and kills itself. For this to work the $Finalizer thread must not have a strong reference to the OSGi classloader either directly or indirectly (i.e. it can't strongly reference any class or instance of class loaded by the OSGi classloader). If it gets a strong reference to the OSGi classloader that OSGi classloader will not be collected. Further, because the OSGi classloader is never destroyed the $Finalizer thread will never exit which will keep the OSGi classloader around. Memory leak.\r\n\r\nThe authors of $Finalizer went to great pains to avoid a strong reference between it and the OSGi classloader. For example, $Finalizer is loaded in its own class loader and only keeps weak/phantom references to the OSGi classloader. It also used reflection extensively. The problem that SOY has is that the $Finalizer thread is forked from a thread that has its ThreadContextClassloader set to the OSGi classloader. When this happens the $Finalizer inherits this TCC and as such has a strong reference to the OSGi classloader. \r\n\r\nThe master of Guice currently embeds guava 11 instead of the old and defunct google-collections. Guava has not used the $Finalizer since guava 3. Simply updating to a version of Guice that uses guava 4+ will fix this memory leak.",

[See the corresponding bug report|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-28617].\n  {panel}\n\nHello team,\r\nWe noticed an oddity when we have queries in different tabs on a browser. This happens on any browser and can be easily reproduced by the steps below:\r\n\r\n#   Open a browser tab (tab #1) and query (query #1) for issues in Jira\r\n#    Go back to tab #1 and click on an issue\r\n#    Open another browser tab (tab #2) and run a different query (query #2)\r\n#    Click \"Return to Search\"\r\n\r\n* Expected results:\r\nYou see the search results from query #1\r\n\r\n* Returned results:\r\nYou see the search results from query #2\r\n\r\nPlease let us know if it's indeed a bug or it's an expected behavior on JIRA.\r\n\r\nThanks.",

Summary\r\n\r\nI have tested JIRA version 4.4.3, 4.4.5 and 5.0.5 and found that JIRA throws an error while translating status with if description string exceeds 255 characters.\r\n\r\nStep to reproduce:\r\n # Log in as a user with the JIRA Administrators global permission.\r\n # Go to Administration>Statuses\r\n # Add a new status and make it's description more than 255 character\r\n # Click \"Translate\"\r\n # Copy Status name and description set and paste to the relevant Name and Description text field\r\n # Select any Language from \"View Language Translations\", click Update\r\n # JIRA will throw an error as the attached 'Error translating status.png'\r\n\r\nh3. Notes\r\n\r\nThis bug not only affects Status *translation*, but also affects other translations e.g. Resolutions and Custom Fields. If this is gonna be fixed, the followings should be fixed altogether:\r\n * [Error occured when translating description longer than 255 characters|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-14633]\r\n * [Translation of a custom field allows only 255 characters|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-61591]\r\n\r\n\u00a0(+) On top of that, there's a Suggestion that the Description field should be converted to a textarea instead, similar to the one in Announcement Banner, for better visibility (see JRASERVER-67635).",

The smaller groups have the latitude to use different development life cycle methods.  For instance, one organization uses a waterfall methodology, while another uses scrum.  \r\n\r\nDespite having these various methodologies, we wish to have a single issue tracking system because we have a single overarching CM and QA organization.  While this may not seem ideal, it fits us well because we have different delivery models (some are customer oriented and necessitate a waterfall, others are product oriented and can successfully use scrum).  \r\n\r\nOur request is to allow JIRA and GreenHopper to have different licenses counts.  It's frustrating (and a waste of money) to us to have to license GreenHopper at the same level as JIRA, when only a percentage of the GreenHopper licenses will actually be used.  \r\n\r\nIt's a testament to how we like JIRA as a bug tracker that we are considering making the move to it organizationally.  However, because the perception is that we are wasting money on GreenHopper licenses, it may sway our decision making otherwise (at least in the form of deciding on a scrum product).",
