      "description": "In the REST plugin we have a 'restmethod' scope that allows components to be injected from the current request. Its currently broken:\r\n\r\n- The scope is implemented via an REST interceptor (RequestScopeInterceptor). The problem is that the REST plugin does not fire the interceptor for all requests. For example, it is not triggered when doing an attachment.\r\n- The scope is not correctly cleared after the request is finished which can leave invalid stuff in the scope for the next request (its in a thread local).\r\n\r\nI tried to quickly to fix the second problem above and it exposed the second problem. The fix will 99% require a fix of the REST plugin or us to implement the 'restmethod' scope without using the interceptors.",

The user admin.jira should be member of jira-users, jira-developers and jira-administrators.\r\n    * Create a new issue (TEST-1)\r\n    * Create a Sub-task for this issue (TEST-2)\r\n    * Logout and login again as devel.jira\r\n    * Go to issue TEST-1 and Clone the issue checking \"Clone Sub Tasks\". The user devel.jira has the permission to clone this issue but not to pass the validator on Create Sub-task transition (it is not an administrator).\r\n    * As result you can find the issue TEST-3 where the Sub-task is the issue itself (TEST-3).\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nThe result, where the subtask is the parent issue itself, cannot be fixed when trying to delete any of these 2 tasks. When trying, this message appears:\r\n{code}\r\nThe JIRA server was contacted but has returned an error response. We are unsure of the result of this operation.\r\n\r\nClose this dialog and press refresh in your browser\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nAnd none of the issues are deleted.\r\n\r\nThe only workaround to fix this problem is direct database change:\r\n{code}\r\n    * delete the issue on db using DELETE FROM JIRAISSUE WHERE PKEY=<issuekey>\r\n    * restart JIRA and run the Integrity Checker (fix the link associations)\r\n    * reindex JIRA issues.\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nBut I cannot understand why this problem is created in the first place. I think it has something to do with the create issue validator, when it is applied to sub-tasks.\r\n\r\nCheers\r\n\r\nThiago Prisco\r\nAtlassian Support",

Move new issue to different project.\r\n\r\nLet me flesh out the process to make it clearer:\r\n\r\n1. Select \"Clone and Link\" from \"More Actions\" menu when viewing a single issue.\r\n2. Select \"new issue depends on original\".\r\n3. Check \"move to project\" and select new project.\r\n4. Select new issue type (i.e. was Epic, new is Story).\r\n5. Edit summary and/or description.\r\n6. Edit custom fields, such as \"Story points\" - which fields are available for editing at this point would be driven by a template, much like the template for the views in the Greenhopper plugin that we use.\r\n7. Click save.\r\n\r\nNew issue will be cloned to the target project with a link to the original issue, with the changed fields as described above.\r\n\r\nThis is especially useful when breaking an existing issue, story, feature or improvement up into subtasks or related stories and making the linking simpler to provide traceability.\r\n\r\nWhat was previously a 5 step process now becomes one.\r\n{quote}",

      "description": "The documentation at http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA040/Advanced+Searching?clicked=jirahelp is incorrect with respect to queries involving DATE fields. It says the following:\r\n{quote}\r\nFind issues that were resolved in January 2009:\r\nresolved > \"2008/12/31\" and resolved < \"2009/02/01\"\r\nFind issues that were resolved on 15 January 2009:\r\nresolved > \"2009/01/14\" and resolved < \"2009/01/16\"\r\n{quote}\r\nHowever, the first query will return bugs resolved on \"2008/12/31,\" which is not in January. The second query will return bugs resolved on January 15 *and* January 14.\r\n\r\nIt seems that {quote}resolved > \"2008/12/31\"{quote} means \"after midnight 31 December 2008.\" That is, there is an implicit time component of midnight in all DATE fields when none is explicitly specified.  This should be reflected in your documentation. I would also include examples that include a time component.\r\n\r\nThanks.",

Jira doesn't actually choke on the query, but it gets hammered trying to read the DB, convert and then feed the XML results back to Confluence.\r\n\r\nI was going to suggest just appending the result size to the end of each of the slow query entries, but I thought there's quite a strong chance that the query itself might not take that long. It's the time taken to feed up the XML results that kill us. So it may be better to log all queries that return great than a set threshold of results (like 10,000 for example)\r\n\r\nI think this problem+enhancement applies to all situations where Jira is not paging a result set. So I'm guessing XML, RSS, Excel, Word, Full Content, and Printable views get hit with this kind of issue. \r\n\r\n",
