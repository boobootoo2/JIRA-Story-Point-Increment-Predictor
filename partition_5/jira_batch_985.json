[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-5370].\n  {panel}\n\nWe are using an external tool to develop JIRA reports.\nThis tool connects directly to the database to generate reports.\nIt works fine except for reports that are using rules based on the history of changes.\nIn fact, the way you are storing changes in the changeitem table is not suitable and not generic enough.\nYou are storing only strings.\n\n2 examples :\n\n- Regarding the way you are qtoring dates: you are storing them using the screen format. If this format changes during the life of JIRA, we will have several date formats in the history. Then, it's very difficul for our reporting tool to analyse the dates and make differences...\n- Regarding the custom fields:\n   - you are storing the values as string.\n   - You are storing only the name of the custom fields and not their ID. So, if the name changes, the external reporting tool will be unable to get the history of this field.\n\nSo, you should change the way you are storing changes by :\n- storing old values and new values like the CUSTOMFIELDVALUE does\n- storing the ID of custom fields and not only the name.\n\nToday, we can answer to the need of users that want to have complex reports, but we know that if some custom field names change, the reports won't work anymore...\n\nDo you think you could change this in a future version ?",

      "description": "We have several Field Layout Schemes for our project, each matching a different Issue Type. When I hide a version field (\"Affects Version/s\", \"Fix Version/s\") in ONE of our Field Layout Schemes, Roadmap and/or Change Log disapear from the Browse Project page. Also, the Find Issues page no longer shows the \"Fix For:\" and/or \"Matches Versions:\" criteria (when selecting our specific project).\n\nI would be glad to hide these features when ALL of my Field Layout Schemes hide the version fields. However, what I expected to see was that, when only SOME of the Field Layout Schemes did hide the version fields, then these features would still be available but they would not show (or match on) the issues of types which were associated to a Field Layout Scheme hiding the version fields.\n\nI guess from issue JRA-5304 that the same situation happens with the Component/s field.\n\nThe problem is that these fields make sense for almost all of my issue types (therefore Field Layout Shemes) but are not relevant for very specific issue types (specific kinds of Tasks and Sub-Tasks).",

A user, say Alice, tells Jira that she'll be gone from Date X to Date Y.  Jira then presents Alice with a list of all the Projects and Components and other pre-set assignments that she is configured for.  Alice can then individually or in batch (checkboxes or whatever) select another Jira user or users to have newly created issues assigned to them while she's away.  In fact, the email template for vacation issue creation may even be different.  E.g.  JiraBob, you've been assigned this issue (yadahdhdhdha) b/c Alice is away on vacation from X to Y.  (if the current date is close enough to y, JiraBob may choose to ignore it :)\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?  Or is this functionality there already in a way that I'm not aware of?  This would really help us in that issues wouldn't a. fall thru cracks and b. when getting back from vacation (yes, sometimes we take vacation) we don't have a pile of issues waiting for us.\r\n\r\nI'm willing to start and tackle this as a plugin.  I don't have a source/commercial license.  Can I build this plugin without the source, just using the API and Jira blogs/email lists?  I don't want to go down the road if I'm not goign to be able to finish it.\r\n\r\n(i) This plugin can be used [Out Of Office Assistant|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.akelesconsulting.jira.plugins.OutOfOfficeAssistant/server/overview], Please contact the plugin vendor in order to make sure about functionality as Atlassian does not support third party plugins.",

Import a different bugzilla project (B), check \"Import only new issues\".\n\nAfter step 1, project A has been imported once. (check!)\nAfter step 2, project A has been imported once. (check!)\nAfter step 3, project B has been imported once, (check!)\n          and project A has been imported twice.

From the looks of the source, Map projectToBugzillaIdMap is initialized on line 96 once when JIRA loads.  It is used create the sql statement for issue selection (whereSelectedProjectClause()) instead of using this.selectedProjects.  Since projectToBugzillaIdMap is only initialized when BugzillaImportBean is loaded, it accumulates every project that has been selected for import.  When an import is run, the logs claim that this.selectedProjects are being imported (correct), but proceeds to import every issue in a project in projectToBugzillaIdMap.\n\nFix:\nInitialize projectToBugzillaIdMap on every import.
