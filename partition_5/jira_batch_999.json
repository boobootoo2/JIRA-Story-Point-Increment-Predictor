There are several ways to meet this need via existing (though manual) efforts. Several of my users siezed on the idea of 'voting' an issue into production and liked it.\n\n-wc\n",

With the introduction of a field that is hideable, not required and not requireable - it would seem beneficial to separate the HideableField interface from the RequireableField interface. This could lead to the introduction of the NavigableHideableFieldImpl and NavigableHideableRequireableFieldImpl classes.\n",

POSITION is a reserved token in SQL apparently. FYI -- it can still be used if the field is fully qualified with the tablename, ex.PORTLETCONFIGURATION.POSITION, but it would be better to change the fieldname.\n\nI use the name \"ORDINAL\" -- Check webster.com for the def'n:\n\n\"1 : a number designating the place (as first, second, or third) occupied by an item in an ordered sequence\"\n\nIn the meantime -- is there a way I can workaround this?\n\nCheers,\nTimo\n\n\n2004-04-28 08:00:59,829 ERROR [jira.action.admin.DataExport] Error exporting: org.ofbiz.core.entity.GenericDataSourceException: SQL Exception while executing the
