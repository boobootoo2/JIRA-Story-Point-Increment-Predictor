Other issue types have different prefixes. When I select 'Issue Type' in 'Create Issue' window I have plain list. It could be great if I suffix acts as parent of tree and the rest of issue type name acts as leaf. So I may choose from the following tree:\r\n\r\nSupport\r\n     \\-- Consulting\r\n     \\-- Techincal Issue\r\nDevelopment\r\n     \\-- User Interface\r\n\r\nand so on.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nAlexander Afonyashin",

Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Go to Look and Feel\r\n # Set timezone from default dd/MMM/yy h:mm a to dd/MMM/yy h:mm a, z\r\n # Click Update\r\n # The time zone then shows correct format with example: E.g. 22/May/07 10:55 PM, CDT\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nWhen you go to issue you should see local time zone format displayed for created ie. CDT, PST\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nTime zone format shows correct for .5 second then switches to GMT format\r\n\r\nSetting 'z' at the end is the correct format needed since the correct local format is shown but only for a second and then switches to GMT format.

      "description": "One of our admins came by today and said that he couldn't create a new project after we upgraded JIRA to 6.0, he never had this problem before. I said \"_phe_\" and selected projects in the right drop down menu and clicked the \"Add Project\" button. Nothing happened.\r\nThis kind of baffled me so naturally  I started up firebug to see what happened and I saw the following error\r\n\r\n{code}\r\nTypeError: this._enableWebSudo is not a function\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nIt seemed to be an authorization issue but I couldn't figure out why it would happen now after upgrading. I realized, though, that I had never been asked for my admin credentials when going into project so I went in somewhere else in the admin page where authorization was required, filled in my password and after that I could create a project.\r\n\r\nSo, the problem seems to be that if you go straight to projects and press \"Create Project\" then nothing happens. There should at least be a message saying \"You are not authorized\" or something because our admin was really confused.\r\n\r\n*How to re-create:*\r\nGo to projects without having authorized yourself as an admin and press Create Project. Nothing will happen.\r\n\r\n*Expected result:*\r\nIf I'm not authorized to create a project either ask me for my password or tell me I shouldn't press the button. :)\r\n\r\n*Workaround*\r\n\r\nThis can be worked around with either of the following:\r\n\r\n    Disable websudo as per our Configuring Secure Administrator Sessions.\r\n    Gain websudo access first by accessing a restricted area of JIRA before attempting to create the project (for example access Administration > System).",
