Summary\r\n\r\nWhen a specific JIRA issue worklog is being filled concurrently from different sources at the same time, some worklog entries are missed; resulting in inaccurate timespent value.

Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Create an integrated system that operates in Jira\r\n# Do several work logs operations such as adding work logs to the same issue\r\n# Run the following queries to verify {{timespent}} and {{timeworked}} data\r\n{code:sql|title=Total count of worklog added in an issue}\r\nselect count(*) from worklog where issueid = <issueID>;\r\n{code}\r\n{code:sql|title=Sum of worklog added in an issue}\r\nselect sum(timeworked) from worklog where issueid = <issueID>;\r\n{code}\r\n{code:sql|title=Sum of timespent in an issue}\r\nselect timespent from jiraissue where id = <issueID>;\r\n{code}\r\n(i) Replace _<issueID>_ with the [issue ID|https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirakb/how-to-get-issue-id-from-the-jira-user-interface-827341428.html]\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nThe time spent of the issue (shown as logged in time tracking panel) equals the sum of all existing work logs.\r\nh3.

Notes\r\n\r\nWe carried out 2 tests as proof of concept:\r\n # A script run twice sequentially (waiting for first run to finish to start another one) where we add 60 seconds of work logs 100 times\r\n # Same as above, but both are run at the same time in parallel\r\n\r\nIn both cases we expected 12000 seconds of time spent on that issue and that is what we got in the first test, but we got 9840 on the second as in some cases, the creation of a work log interfered with another running at the same time.\r\nh3.

Issue Summary\r\nJira DC can insert stale custom field values into its Lucene index while replicating index changes from another node(s). \r\nThis happens due to receiving node reading from the stale {{EagerLoadingOfBizCustomFieldPersister}} cache. \r\nThis will cause JQL search not returning the expected result on the affected node. \r\n\r\n+Notes:+\r\n* System fields are not affected since they are not using same cache. \r\n\r\nh3. Environment\r\nThe problem is visible in DC setup with 1+ nodes.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n* create the issueA on a node A\r\n** the less load DC has the more likely the problem will be reproduced. \r\n* edit a custom field with \"value A\"\r\n* wait until this issue is replicated to other node(s)\r\n* edit the same custom field once again and set \"value B\"\r\n* wait until this issue is replicated to other node(s)\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n* All nodes see \"value B\" in the index. \r\n* JQL search \"CF = value B\" shows the issueA\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n* Other nodes see stale CF value - \"value A\"\r\n* JQL search _\"CF = value B\"_ doen't show the issueA\r\n* JQL search _\"CF = value A\"_ shows the issueA\r\n** Opening issueA will show the correct value, since it will be loaded directly from DB\r\n\r\nh3.

To select a transition where multiple transitions exist to a single status, or select a transition to a status in the same column, the user has to either:\r\n * Click on the card > (wait for Issue detail view to render) > dots menu > More Actions > select transition\r\n * Open the full detail view (wait for Full issue view to render) > select the transition, possibly by clicking the Workflow dropdown\r\n\r\nThese are all 4+ clicks plus render time. To be forced to do this for a transition feels like punishment for using workflows with more than a few statuses and/or transitions. Not every business process can or should be simplified to that degree.\r\n\r\nI suggest that transitions be offered in the Alt-Click menu for the card. This would reduce the picking a transition to a 2 click process. It would also potentially solve the \"transition to the same column\" issue. Bonus points to the dev if they putting the To status next to the transition name in that Alt-click menu.\r\n\r\nThis may be an enhancement request elsewhere. Please link if it is.\r\n\r\n\u00a0",

Environment\r\nJira 7.9.0 - Jira 8.3.0\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\nGo to the public profile of a user and check the Activity Stream. It will appear a few activities of some days. Clicking Show More a few times, it will eventually show activities from day in between the previous dates that were not showing before as well. It doesn't happen to all users.\r\n\r\nPlease note maxResults=10.

Identified bugs:\r\n # Step (1.4) from the workflow above sorts previously calculated results by latest update date *ignoring* the author of the changes. The result is then trimmed to 10 issues only.\r\n # The code in general executes the same action several times as it's first getting the latest activities for a given user from database, then translates the activities into issue keys and then calculates the activities one more time but now based only on previously identified issue keys.\r\n\r\nh3.

This plugin provides in product notifications in applications like Jira. These notifications are controlled by Atlassian. These can be used to inform users of new features or notify users of critical updates.\r\n\r\nAs a system administrator, I want to control which of my Jira end users see this message, and be able to stop showing users this message when I choose.\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nUpdate whisper plugin to provide more granular control over these notifications by a system administrator. Such as the ability to dismiss a specific message from appearing for other users. And the ability to see which user-roles will see a specific message\r\nh3. Why this is important\r\n\r\nIt can help provide system administrators more control over the messages and content that appear to their end users. Many times end users could be seeing messages that urge them to upgrade Jira when Jira has already been upgraded, or when that user does not have privileges to actually perform the upgrade themselves. In turn these can lead to many users reaching out to the Jira system admin to remind them of an upgrade.\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nIt is possible to disable the whisper plugin entirely, however this is not recommended by Atlassian as it would prevent the system from getting any such notifications at all.",

In some cases, their website is running on HTTPS but JIRA instance is running on HTTP, embedding HTTP content in an HTTPS page will result in some users unable to see the embedded content due to browser blocking mixed content.\r\n\r\nThe following KB article details this issue and it presents a workaround by accessing a rest endpoint to open the form directly. Unfortunately, this endpoint doesn't work anymore, the HTML code for the form is returned but it stays hidden, not showing the fields to fill. ",

      "description": "h3. Problem Definition\r\n\r\nRarely, Atlassian has issued IPN (in product notifications) for Jira Server and Data Center customers. This feature has existed in Jira since about 7.3 or 7.4. These messages could be used for letting users know about new product features, or to let Admins know about security vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\nThe nature of these messages is very short, which usually has them including one or more addition hyperlinks to a related Atlassian site, such as Community, or documentation, etc. However the dialog box that appears on an end user's screen will not display the hyperlink URL in the statusbar of the browser when you hover over it.\r\n\r\nThis is a small feature that would help us be more transparent about where a link is going, before you try to go there. There is a fear among users, coupled with the infrequency of such notifications, that maybe a link that does not indicate where it is going could be malicious.\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nMake adjustments to the way hyperlinks are displayed in the in product notifications (whisper) so that hovering over those links shows the destination URL in the browser statusbar, like a real link.\r\nh3. Why this is important\r\n * Transparency with end users.\u00a0\r\n * Helps to build there trust,\r\n * Knowing what you are clicking before you click it.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nNone",
