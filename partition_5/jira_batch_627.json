Environment\r\n* Start with JIRA version prior to 7.3.0, with a Delegated LDAP Directory configured, with *Copy User on First Login* enabled.\r\n\r\nFor easier verification below, also have a user setup in the Delegated LDAP directory. \r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Upgrade JIRA to 7.3.0 or later\r\n# Navigate to {{\u2699 (Administration) > User Management > User Directories}} and review the *Directory Configuration Summary*\r\n** Verify that \"crowd.delegated.directory.auto.update.user\" is \"true\"\r\n# Navigate to {{\u2699 (Administration) > User Management > Users}} and *Edit* a user from the Delegated LDAP directory to mark it inactive. \r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nThe *Edit* link shouldn't even be displayed in the first place, per the text displayed when editing the Directory settings: \r\nbq.

Supported Platforms documentation is not clear regarding AWS\r\n\r\nI want to host JIRA on a Windows or Linux system running on AWS EC2. I want to connect it to a supported database platform running on Amazon RDS. \r\n\r\nLooking at [Supported platforms|https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiraserver072/supported-platforms-828787550.html/], it's not clear whether this is supported or if the whole of AWS is only supported for JIRA Data Center customers. \r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nClarify the [Supported platforms|https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiraserver072/supported-platforms-828787550.html/] documentation to indicate that single-node EC2 OS instances and RDS hosted databases fall within the realm of \"supported platforms.\"",

Problem Definition\r\nAs per [JRASERVER-28748|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-28748], during the Project import, the Boards are not going to be imported hence the Sprints to Boards associations will be lost. \r\n\r\nAfter the project import, we can create the Boards manually or by using some third-party plugin, but this may break the reports. For example, reports such as Release Burndown will only show partial Sprints and some of it will appear missing. Querying the database will return all the missing Sprints. \r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\nDuring the Project import, provide a wizard where users can map the old Board from the source instance to the new board in the target instance.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround \r\nLogin to JIRA database and run this SQL:\r\n{noformat}\r\nUPDATE \"AO_60DB71_SPRINT\" set \"RAPID_VIEW_ID\" = <new board ID> where \"ID\" in (<IDs of missing sprints>)\r\n{noformat}\r\n(i) Replace {{<new board ID>}} with the respective value. {{<IDs of missing sprints>}} should be in comma separated list.\r\n\r\n(!) *Please test this on a [staging server|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/AdminJIRAServer071/Establishing+staging+server+environments+for+JIRA+applications] before updating your Production instance.*",

Description\r\nDuring the integrity checking procedure, JIRA fired the following query to the database:\r\n{code}\r\nSELECT ID, pkey, issuenum, PROJECT, REPORTER, ASSIGNEE, CREATOR, issuetype, SUMMARY, DESCRIPTION, ENVIRONMENT, PRIORITY, RESOLUTION, issuestatus, CREATED, UPDATED, DUEDATE, RESOLUTIONDATE, VOTES, WATCHES, TIMEORIGINALESTIMATE, TIMEESTIMATE, TIMESPENT, WORKFLOW_ID, SECURITY, FIXFOR, COMPONENT FROM jiraissue\r\n{code}\r\nand load the data in the memory. For a large JIRA instance (more than 50 000 issues), loading such amount of data required a big chunk of heap that might cause the memory congestion or garbage collection performance issue.\r\n\r\nh3. Suggestion\r\nThe result set should paged to limit the size of data to be loaded in the memory to avoid the any memory pressure. ",
