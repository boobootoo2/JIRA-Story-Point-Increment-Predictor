The Task Manager shows full CPU utilization of one core and abnormal RAM usage (growing more than tenfold). For an example see the attached screenshots which show the state of the frozen GUI and task manager after double clicking \"master\".\r\n\r\nThe Stash server is running in the local network but is accessed via its public address. HTTPS is configured using a Wildcard SSL certificate from GoDaddy, the root CA bundle had to be added to the clients via \"git config --global http.sslCAInfo [path/to/ca_bundle.crt]\".

This means for me, that I need to download the files manuall by clicking the download repository button on bitbucket, because that is really faster then waiting for SourceTree.\r\n\r\nThen after some time of trying to download the project, SourceTree gives me every time this error: \r\nRCP failed: result=18, HTTP code = 200\r\nffatal: The remote end hung up unexpectedly\r\natal: early EOF\r\nfatal: index-pack failed\r\n\r\nIf I then got then the files on a different way then using SourceTree, SourceTree is really slow.

(see attached jpg screenshot of the dialog I refer)\r\n\r\nI have setup a bitbucket mercurial repo with nested mercurial sub-repos.  Just to a depth of 3.  Say my sub-repo hierachy looks like this:\r\n\r\nA\r\n+- B\r\n.   +- C\r\n\r\nI made an actual change to subrepo C and committed it locally.  This made subrepo B's state info for C change, so I commited locally on subrepo B.  This in turn made 'the root' repo A's state info for B change, so I commited locally on subrepo A also.\r\n\r\nThen for an experiment I tried to push changes to bitbucket starting with root repo A.  SourceTree displayed the Checking subrepositories... dialog to let me know that I had pending pushes on subrepos.  I've found that if I click the Cancel button on this dialog that SourceTree appears to crash 100%.\r\n\r\nThis dialog sits spinning for several second getting ready (communicating with remote bitbucket perhaps or checking local repo state).  If I click Cancel at any time it will crash.  It also crashes regardless of whether I generate this dialog from attempting to push root repo A or push subrepo B.",
