It would be much more convenient to be able to have the link copied from a previous comment be pasted into the new comment as a labeled link rather than as the full URL. So the steps would be: 1) Right-click the previous comment's chain-link-sign to copy the link 2) Use a button in the new comment to paste a reference to the previous comment as a labeled hyperlink such as 'Comment NNNN'. Currently I can work around this by doing the labeling of the URL myself but it would be convenient to make it a one-step operation.\"\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nRobert\r\n",

Please upgrade to JIRA Agile 6.7 and try again.*\r\n\r\n*Suggested Solution*\r\nSince prior to JIRA 7.1.0, JIRA was able to handle the upgrade task automatically, implemented the same upgrade task should be ideal for the users.\r\n\r\n*Workaround*\r\nUser will have to upgrade their source JIRA instance's JIRA Agile to version 6.7 and above, create new XML backup and restore that backup in the target JIRA instance. \r\n\r\n\r\n{panel:title=Brydie McCoy [Atlassian] }\r\nUnfortunately it was becoming too difficult to maintain older upgrade tasks, so in 7.1.0 the Agile team removed upgrade tasks older than 12 months.\r\nYou can either\r\nUpgrade JIRA Agile to 6.7.x on their original instance (for JIRA 6.3, 6.4 and 6.5). Or;\r\nImport the data into a JIRA Software 7.0.0 instance first.

Summary\r\nWhen calling the REST API using unencoded basic authentication, a non-ASCII character in the username or password will return an incorrect status - a 401 Unauthorized or a 403 Forbidden respectively.\r\n\r\nThis does not impact the {{rest/auth/1/session}} endpoint. For more information on how to use this endpoint instead, please [Cookie-based Authentication|https://developer.atlassian.com/server/jira/platform/cookie-based-authentication/].\r\n\r\nThis also does not impact a user's ability to log in - as the browser and form will correctly encode data before sending it back to the server.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Create a user with non-ASCII character name like \"\u0142ukasz\" and the password test\r\n# Login through the web UI as that user, to verify the credentials are valid.\r\n# Do rest call as the user:\r\n{code}\r\ncurl -u \u0142ukasz:test -I http://localhost:8090/jira/rest/api/2/issue/TEST-2\"\r\n{code}\r\n\r\n(i) The problem can exhibit with a non-ascii character in either the username or the password.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nWith the correct credentials, the issue return a 200 OK response.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n{noformat}\r\nHTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized\r\nContent-Encoding: gzip\r\nContent-Type: text/html;charset=UTF-8\r\nDate: Thu, 18 Feb 2016 10:53:23 GMT\r\nServer: Apache-Coyote/1.1\r\nSet-Cookie: JSESSIONID=91304E14DAA60D5A14292013A062A13B; Path=/jira/; HttpOnly\r\nTransfer-Encoding: chunked\r\nVary: User-Agent\r\nWWW-Authenticate: OAuth realm=\"http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A8090%2Fjira\"\r\nX-AREQUESTID: 1313x7361x1\r\nX-ASEN: SEN\r\nX-Content-Type-Options: nosniff\r\nX-Seraph-LoginReason: AUTHENTICATED_FAILED\r\n{noformat}\r\n \r\nh3. Notes\r\nSee [ACJIRA-513|https://ecosystem.atlassian.net/browse/ACJIRA-513] description and comments for more details.\r\n\r\nh3.Workaround\r\nThere are a few alternative options workarounds; depending on the exact implementation you're using.\r\n\r\nh4.Option 1 - Remove the non-ascii characters\r\nIf possible, change the non-ascii characters to ascii characters. This may not be desirable (or feasible) in all cases, however.\r\n\r\nh4.Option 2 - Encode the username and password as Base64 before sending\r\nUse the following command to generate a Base64 encoded string:\r\n{code}\r\necho -n 'username:password' | openssl base64\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nThen, supply an {{Authorization: Basic token}} header, like so:\r\n\r\n{code}\r\ncurl -X GET http://localhost:8090/jira/rest/api/2/issue/TEST-2 -H 'Authorization: Basic dXNlcm5hbWU6cGFzc3dvcmQ='\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nh4.Option 3 - Use Cookie authentication\r\n\r\n{panel:title=Information|borderStyle=solid|borderColor=#3C78B5|titleBGColor=#3C78B5|titleColor=#FFFFFF|bgColor=#E7F4FA}\r\n(i) In some cases, we've seen a Base64 encoded string fail. In our testing, this _seems_ to be caused by an ASCII username, with a non-ascii character in the password. If you're seeing a Base 64 encoded string fail (and you're sure it's correct) then consider using the cookie method of authentication.\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\nYou can use [cookie based authentication|https://developer.atlassian.com/server/jira/platform/cookie-based-authentication/] to authenticate first, and then use the cookie as your authentication mechanism in subsequent requests.",

There is a per project solution already in place for the time consuming index procedure which works like a charm.\r\n\r\nMy main use-case for this is that you normally get a request from a user that one specific issue is broken (usually no transition buttons available) and this is most often resolved by running the Integrity Checker.\r\nBut in a large instance behind a proxy this is often not possible due to the time-outs. In this case you know what project to look at (and even what issue) and it makes no sense for the checker in this case to traverse hundreds of thousands of issues just to realize that that one issue has an inconsistent state. Even if you increase the time-out for this specific case you still will have to wait a long time before you reach the Fix page!\r\n\r\nSo please make the Integrity Checker able to run on a project basis so I can start using this great tool again!\r\n\r\nThnx in advance!\r\n\r\n// Svante",

This is traditionally used when referring to code (variable names, class names, etc...) or short pieces of code.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\nWrite a text in the description of an issue with content like the following: \r\n\"The HTTP response came back as {{{\"result\" : \"success\"}}} but ...\"\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nThe text is shown as it was written, in one single uninterrupted line.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nThe text is shown with line breaks instead of a single line.\r\n \r\nh3. Notes\r\n* The impetus for this is javadocs which support tags such as: <tt>variableName</tt> (<code/> does the same thing) which will give monospace typing to variableName. Javadocs also support <pre>a bunch of code here</pre> which is handy for formatting a lot of code. JIRA handles the <pre/> situation quite well with the \"code\" tags. It makes an attempt to handle in-line monospace typing with \"Preformatted\". This works well most of the time, but it is completely broken when trying to use with JSON code snippets.\r\n* JavaDocs and other formatting tools support inline monospacing on code snippets for readability purposes, so should JIRA. In fact, Preformatting works well with code snippets for nearly any language EXCEPT JSON.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\nTo use the \"code\" formatting. Example: \r\n{code}The HTTP response came back as {{{\"result\" : \"success\"}}} but ...{code}",

Workarounds\r\nTo Avoid this issue, you can: \r\n# Migrate to an alternative Database such as Postgres [as per out documentation|https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiraserver070/switching-databases-749382658.html].\r\n# Downgrade the JIRA Instance (detailed below)\r\n# Follow the steps below to control the inaccessible functionality. \r\n\r\nh4. To workaround this bug with using the REST API: \r\n*To simply get information about the application Roles using the [REST API|https://docs.atlassian.com/jira/REST/latest/]:*\r\n# Log into JIRA \r\n# Access: {{<BASE-URL>/rest/api/2/applicationrole}}, which will return a JSON Response with details of the JIRA Application Users. \r\n\r\n*To Add or Remove a Group to a License Role*\r\n# Use a REST Client to call the following as per [the REST API - Update Application Role|https://docs.atlassian.com/jira/REST/latest/#api/2/applicationrole-get]: \r\n{noformat}\r\n<base-url>/rest/api/2/applicationrole/{key}\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nh4. To Downgrade your JIRA instance to JIRA 7.0.10\r\n# Make a full backup of your environment as in: [Backing up data|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/AdminJIRAServer070/Backing+up+data]\r\n# Ensure JIRA 7.1.0 instance is shutdown.\r\n# Install JIRA 7.0.10 into this environment, but not into the same JIRA Install as your 7.1.0 as this will not work.\r\n# Shutdown the JIRA 7.0.10 instance once it has started.  \r\n# Any customisations and data that you have in your JIRA 7.1.0 environment should be migrated to ensure that your JIRA 7.0.10 has these configurations. \r\n## Copy over any configuration changes that you have made as per our [Upgrading JIRA applications with a fallback method|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/AdminJIRAServer070/Upgrading+JIRA+applications+with+a+fallback+method]. \r\n## Copy over Avatars and attachments to your new instance as in [Upgrading JIRA applications with a fallback method|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/AdminJIRAServer070/Upgrading+JIRA+applications+with+a+fallback+method].\r\n## Migrate any installed-plugins that you would like to install into this JIRA 7.0.10 environment. Note: do not migrate the plugins from your 7.1.0 environment, as this will contain 7.1.0 Add-ons that you should not include.\r\n# Set the flag {{-Djira.downgrade.allowed=true}} as per: [Setting properties and options on startup|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/AdminJIRAServer070/Setting+properties+and+options+on+startup]\r\n# Start JIRA 7.0.10\r\n# When asked for connection information to the database, point to the 7.1.0 JIRA database (if you did not copy the {{dbconfig.xml}} file when copying configuration files.)\r\n# The instance should now start and downgrade the JIRA database data. The JIRA version should be reported as 7.0.10.\r\n ",

Summary\r\nAs described [here|https://docs.atlassian.com/jira/REST/latest/#api/2/user/properties-getProperty], a new REST API call was introduced in JIRA 7.0 that returns the value of the property with a given key from the user identified by the key or by the id. However, it's always returning Error 404.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected behaviour\r\nReturns the value of the property with a given key from the user identified by the key or by the id.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual behaviour\r\nError 404 is returned, which means user with given key or id does not exist or if the property with given key is not found.\r\nh5. Example\r\nCall\r\n{noformat}\r\n<instance url>/rest/api/2/user/properties/<propertyKey>?username=<user>\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nResponse\r\n{code}\r\n{\"errorMessages\":[\"The property <propertyKey> does not exist.\"],\"errors\":{}}\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Add a key-value pair under properties on <instance url>/secure/admin/user/EditUserProperties.jspa?name=<user>;\r\n# Try to list the property value of the key for this user with the below REST API call;\r\n{noformat}\r\nhttp://<jira-url>/rest/api/2/user/properties/<property key>?userKey=<user>\r\n{noformat}\r\n# Observe the response returned is code 404;\r\n\r\nh3.

Summary\r\nRegardless of the context path setup for JIRA, accessing the *Release Notes* link from a version's details page builds a URL with context path {{/jira}}, which possibly results in a 404 error.\r\n\r\nh3.

Expected Behavior\r\nThe context path should be retrieved from the application's Base URL, and not hard-coded.\r\n\r\nh3.

Problem Definition\r\n* It is currently not possible to hide the JIRA User Timezone Difference Warning. \r\n* Some users would choose to use a different Timzone for multiple reasons one of it being this bug : https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRA-44363\r\n* It is only possible to hide the JIRA User Timezone Difference Warning for JIRA 6.3 and older following this KB : https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRAKB/How+to+hide+JIRA+User+Timezone+Difference+Warning \r\n* Unfortunately it is no possible with JIRA 6.4 and later as there are changes in the code. In JIRA 6.3 and older , the timezone warning message had an ID named {{timezoneDiffBanner}} which can be hidden using script but in JIRA 6.4 onwards, this ID has been removed and replaced with a universal ID for all banner messages {{aui-flag-container}}\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\nMake it possible to  hide the JIRA User Timezone Difference Warning. \r\n \r\nh3. Workaround \r\n* You can still hide the Timezone difference warning by adding this script to the Announcement banner :\r\n{code}\r\n<style type=\"text/css\">\r\n  #aui-flag-container{ display:none; }\r\n</style>\r\n{code}\r\n* However this will also hide all other warnings which is not feasible.

[See the corresponding bug report|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-59742].\n  {panel}\n\nh3. Summary\r\nIn other browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, IE11, IE10), you can use the 'tab' key to navigate through the header bar, down the sidebars, and into the pages. However, in Safari 'tab' takes you to the search field, and maybe a few page elements, but does not go along the JIRA header or sidebars.\r\n\r\nh3. Environment\r\n* Browser: Safari 8.0.2\r\n* OS: Mac OS X 10.10.1\r\n* Java: 1.8.0_40\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Open JIRA in Safari\r\n# Navigate with tab key on any page (first noticed in the project administration section)\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nNavigating with the tab key should cycle through all the selectable elements on the page.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nThe selection moves from the the browser search bar, along browser bookmarks, into the JIRA search bar, maybe onto some other page elements. However, it does not select items across the JIRA header or sidebar elements (both project central sidebar and project administration sidebar).\r\n\r\nh3.Workaround\r\nNavigation and selection with the mouse is not affected and can be used as normal. Could use another browser.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Please revise the documentaiton to address the following four issues, numbered A, B, C & D:\r\n\r\nA) When importing JIRA Agile projects from one JIRA Software 7.0 system to another, the user is in a Catch-22 situation regarding workflows.  The Project Import documentation states:\r\n\r\n{color:#14892c}\"If you wish to retain a customized workflow from your backup, you will need to create a new workflow in your target JIRA instance and manually edit the new workflow (e.g. create steps and transitions) to reflect your old workflow \"\r\n. . .\r\n\"Do not use the JIRA functionality for exporting and importing workflow XML definitions, to copy your backup workflow to your target JIRA instance.\"\r\n{color}\r\n\r\nHowever, when it comes to Aglie projects, the workflow itself contains comments which contradict the above documentation:\r\n\r\n{color:#654982}\"This workflow is managed internally by JIRA Agile. Do not manually modify this workflow\"{color}\r\n\r\nPlease provide clarification what to do specifically regarding workflows when importing Agile-style projects:\r\n\r\n1) Should the workflow be recreated manually?\r\n2) Should the workflow be exported as XML, then imported on the target system and manually revised?\r\n3) Or is it best to use the workflow that is created when the empty project is first created on the target system?\r\n\r\nB) When creating the new empty projects on the target system, is it OK to create a non-Agile project, then later associate the project with an Agile workflow?  Or must the new empty projects be created as Agile projects from the start (via an Agile-enabled project template)?\r\n\r\nC) I often assign the same workflow to multiple non-Aglie projects.  Is it possible for Agile projects to have shared workflows?  Or must each Agile project have a distinct workflow?\r\n\r\nD) Please provide some sample SQL queries that could be used to re-establish Boards and other Agile data that the JIRA Software 7.0 Import Tool currently skips.  So far, the best procedure I have found is at [https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/18448856/how-to-import-jira-agile-sprint-data-project-by-project], but there is no way for me to know whether these steps are correct and complete.\r\n",

Problem Definition\r\n\r\nMany API endpoints use the startat parameter to determine the index starting point, and then maxresults parameter to determine how many results will be returned. The groups endpoint instead users to [start:end] endpoint to determine which results will be returned.\r\n\r\nFor example, for users 50-100 it is:\r\n\r\n* https://example.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/group?groupname=jira-users&expand=users[50:100]\r\n\r\nWhereas you would expect\r\n\r\n* https://example.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/group?groupname=jira-users&expand=users&startAt=50&maxResults=100\r\n\r\n\r\nThe inconsistent user experience makes it difficult to know which method to use.\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nMake all rest endpoints consistent in the way they handle startat and maxresults.\r\n\r\nh3.
