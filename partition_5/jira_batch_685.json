But the functionality remains unchanged, i.e. you can still take screenshots with the same keyboard and then just paste on to the issue. You will get the same dialog where you can rename the screenshot.\r\nThanks for letting us know your thoughts as always!\r\nCheers,\r\nLingbo\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\nWe have noticed today, that Attach Screenshot has disappeared from Issue menu for all projects. \r\n\r\nPlus,  I can't find 'View Issue Ops Bar Attach Screenshot Link(attach-screenshot)' module under Administrator >> Manage My Plugins >> System Plugins >>'Issue Operations Plugin' \r\n\r\nIs this a known issue?

It would be a great enhancement to remove that drop down and allow text typing and quick search to find a Group Name that way. The same happens in the Group Administration  when adding/removing users to groups, where you have a multi-line select with all the groups listed there, then the current members of the group and the users to add. \r\n\r\nBasically, having a large list of groups hits performance and user/administration experience.

Everything works fine, except when wanting to *close an issue* from the new Project Navigation view. Then it fails.\r\n\r\nAfter analysing the problem in detail, we have detected that when closing an issue from this new view, JIRA is *always* returning a \"401 Unauthorized\" error (see Developer Tools section in the attached screenshots).  All other actions (ie. resolve issue) return a \"200 OK\".\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce this behavior:\r\n1. Install a standalone JIRA, version 6.4.7 or JIRA 6.4.10. Perhaps other versions are also affected.\r\n2. Create a new project and populate it with some issues. \r\n3. Switch Workflow of the project to Default.\r\n4. Enable Development Tools in any browser (we used Chrome).\r\n5. Go to the new Project Navigation view, select any issue and click on \"Close\"\r\n6. Check the result of the Ajax call - the call should be similar to {noformat}AjaxIssueEditAction!default.jspa?decorator=none&issueId=10002&_=1439969896285{noformat}\r\n7. This is only happening when executing the transition to \"Closed\". Going to other statuses of the workflow does not generate this error message.

      "description": "There are several types of cron expression errors that Quartz fails to recognize as such, and sometimes this can result in the job not being scheduled or running at unexpected times.  A few examples discovered in JIRA Cloud include:\r\n\r\n* {{0 0/150 * * * ? *}} -- {{/150}} is out of range.  If the expression had been specified using {{\\*/150}}, which on the surface would mean the same thing, then Quartz would report the error.  Instead, with a starting value of 0 explicitly given, Quartz silently ignores the invalid interval.\r\n* {{0 40 9 1W,15W 1-12 ? 2010-2050}} -- Multiple values are not supported for the {{W}} flag.  When you list multiple values, the {{W}} flag state on the first value wins.  If the first value specifies it, then the other values are silently ignored.  If it does not, then the {{W}} flag is silently ignored for the other values.\r\n\r\nClearly the intent of the first cron expression is to run a job every 2 1/2 hours, but it actually isn't possible to express that using a cron expression, and since the invalid interval gets ignored, the job actually runs every hour.  The intent of the second one is to run on the weekdays closest to the 1st and 15th of the month, but only the 1st of the month is actually honoured.\r\n\r\nJIRA should either reject these expressions or honour their spirit.  It should not silently accept them as if they are valid but then do something else.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

It passes the text through to a JIRA text Field (single line).\r\n\r\nWe would like to include custom fields of all types in reporting options.

Atlassian Connect 1.0 [was released in March 2014|http://blogs.atlassian.com/2014/03/introducing-atlassian-connect-1-0/], and you can already get access to [more than 50 public add-ons today built using the platform|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/search?application=&category=&cost=&hosting=cloud&marketingLabel=].\r\n \r\nDue to stability and scalability reasons, we will not bundle additional third party add-ons with our Cloud offerings. But you should feel free to contact the vendors of your favourite add-ons to let them know that you would like them to create a Cloud version of the add-on! We will do our best to work together with the vendor to satisfy this request.\r\n \r\nSince we have no plans to bundle additional add-ons in Cloud, we are closing this issue.\r\n \r\nCheers,\r\nBartek\r\nJIRA Product Management\r\nbartek (at) atlassian (dot) com\r\n{panel}\r\n \r\n \r\n*Original request description:*\r\nCustomers need the following plugin install to make their tasks easier:\r\n\r\nhttps://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.wittified.jira.project-creator\r\n\r\n",

Our add-on is seemingly working on that version of JIRA without making any changes (and using the old BundleContext).\r\n\r\nb) Is there any way that JIRA 7 could continue to ship an shim interface corresponding to the old BundleContext (org.osgi.framework.BundleContext), and have that shimmed interface simply extend the new Eclipse BundleContext? It seems like this would permit add-ons to continue to list the old interface without any further difficulties.\r\n\r\nThis otherwise presents a significant binary compatibility problem for add-ons between JIRA 6 and 7. The current method used to get a BundleContext requires us to mark our own classes as implementors of the above interface\u2026but if we list the new class in our JAR, it won\u2019t load on JIRA 6 because the class doesn\u2019t exist. If we continue to list the old class, but JIRA 7 removes it, then our JAR won\u2019t load in JIRA 7. Although I haven\u2019t thought through all of the classloader specifics, I think the above solution would make this very easy on everybody.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019ve been able to resolve most issues like this through reflection, but we don\u2019t have that option here because it\u2019s related to the class inheritance, and it happens before our add-on gets control. Is there anything you can do?",

By its very nature, Dataplane needs to do this.\r\n\r\nIs there any way to make the warning threshold adjustable by us? We recognize that the warnings are there to alert the JIRA administrator that something may be going wrong and to prevent deadlocks, but in our case, we are using multiple connections deliberately.\r\n\r\nFor example, Dataplane takes great pains to be a careful user of JIRA database connections. Although a single Dataplane thread can certainly use multiple database connections, we never query the same tables that are used in other connections, and we also maintain our own \u201csub-pool\u201d of database connections to ensure that we never starve JIRA core of needed resources. (For example, Dataplane has its own internal high-water limit that prevents it from trying to use more than 1/3rd of the total JIRA dB connection pool at any time.)\r\n\r\nCould we get some sort of plugin-wide (or even ThreadLocal) setting that allows us to configure the warning threshold to a higher value to eliminate these warnings for our deliberate use? Although I see a way to increase the connection limit by +1 through some sort of strict-mode setting, one will not always be sufficient, and we also don\u2019t want to have to ask the user to make a JIRA properties change to make it work.",

Expected behavior:\r\nThe link should have been created with no error message and the link to the Confluence page should point to the Display URL defined at the application link configuration.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to reproduce:\r\n# Install JIRA and Confluence (with any proxy or ssl integraton);\r\n# Set the Base URL for both applications;\r\n# Create the application link using the URL defined as the Base URL;\r\n# After creating the application link, edit the _Display URL_ of Confluence to a different URL pointing to the same server (i.e.: Server IP), as in the following example:\r\n!applink.png|thumbnail!\r\n# Create the link to a Confluence page.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround:\r\nUse the [link to web page|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Linking+Issues#LinkingIssues-CreatingalinktoanywebpageURL] functionality, instead of the [link to Confluence page|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Linking+Issues#LinkingIssues-CreatingalinktoaConfluencepage].\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nh4. WORKAROUND:\r\nUse the full link, not the tiny link. Or use Web Link option",

This is of course sad to say but until we have covered ALL business processes at the customers site this will continue to be the reality for many users.   \r\n\r\nAs such I would like to suggest a function to unwatch a ticket without having to click on issue link and logging into Jira. \r\n\r\nA link, a button, a reply in the notification...I probably don't have the best idea on the HOW but I know that the function would be appreciated.",
