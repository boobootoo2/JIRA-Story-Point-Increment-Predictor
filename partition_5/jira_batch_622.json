Steps to Reproduce\r\n # create a project in JIRA with at least 1 issue\r\n # Give this issue a label, in this case used example label called 'special'\r\n # After this label has been confirmed, go into SQL and run command:\r\n{code:java}\r\nselect * from label where label='special'; \r\n{code}  - This will return a single entry for this one issue with this label\r\n # Now generate an [XML backup|https://confluence.atlassian.com/jira/backing-up-data-185729581.html#BackingUpData-UsingJIRA%27sXMLbackuputility]\r\n # Then go back to the JIRA issue, remove that label from the issue\r\n # Re-run SQL query, you should have 0 results\r\n # Then delete the entire project from this JIRA instance\r\n # then create a new project with the same project name/key as the previously delete project\r\n # Then use the project import tool to import that previously deleted project (using the XML backup you created)\r\n # After this is complete, run the SQL query again:\r\n{code:java}\r\nselect * from label where label='special';  \r\n{code}\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nWe expect to only find the single entry in this table for that single issue with that special label\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nWe actually find there are two entries in this table for that issue in regards to this single label. Not only that, but all labels that were imported as part of issues imported in this project import appear to have duplicate entries in the label table of the database. The ID column is incrementing and is unique, but there are multiple entries with the same issue value and the same label value that appear to be caused directly by this project import process.\r\nh3. Notes\r\n * Note that the UI of JIRA only shows a single label for this issue. So there is not a problem that way.\r\n * But in cases where users are running SQL queries or other external reporting on their databases for this table, this is a problem because the project import appears to be creating duplicate data that will mess with reporting.\r\n * This was not the case in regards to project imports in JIRA 6.x versions. It appears that this is something new as of the 7.x line of project importing.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nIt might be possible to use some fancy SQL query to locate and remove the duplicates, but I'm not sure the specifics of how this could be done without risking data loss/integrity issues.",

Your feedback is key to helping us understand how you use JIRA so we can continue improving your experience. We have reviewed this issue over the last few days.\r\n\r\nThe Field Required Validator for workflow transitions\u00a0*has been incorporated into JIRA Cloud* as a native feature. For JIRA Cloud customers, we recommend using this validator as the most direct way to resolve this use case.\r\n\r\nFor *JIRA Server* customers, the validator is still available by installing the JIRA Suite Utilities plugin, which is [free and available on the Atlassian Marketplace|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.googlecode.jira-suite-utilities/server/overview].\r\n\r\nPlease don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or feedback.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n Dave Meyer\r\n dmeyer@atlassian.com\r\n Product Manager, JIRA Platform\r\n{panel}\r\n*Original request description:*\r\n\r\nThe reporter can not add an issue when he has no resolve permissions and the \"fixed Version\" field is a required field.\r\n\r\nAs a JIRA Administrator I want a \"Fixed version\" to be a required field when resolving. But it seems illogical that someone reporting an issue should enter the field. This applies to other fields as well.\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nThe [JIRA Suite Utilities|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.googlecode.jira-suite-utilities] provides a [fields required validator|https://jsutil.atlassian.net/wiki/display/JSUTIL/JIRA+Suite+Utilities+Workflow+Validators#JIRASuiteUtilitiesWorkflowValidators-FieldsRequiredValidator] that can be configured to set fields required on specific transitions.",

Why this is important\r\n\r\nIt would be great if the \"smart mentions\" could also include users mentioned in a comment within the ticket, since such users are also involved in the ticket.\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n * For now, the only workaround would be for any person mentioned in the ticket to comment in the ticket, so that they can be part of the list of \"involved\" users.\r\n * A second workaround is to add a Custom field of type User Picker Multiple, and use it to manually add users and trigger notifications for them (similar to the way watcher notifications are configured):\r\n *# Create a Custom field, with the Type _User Picker (Multiple Users)_ (see example [^image-2017-08-17-16-35-04-614.png]).\r\n *# Add the custom field to the screens you need (in my example, the field is called 'Participants' and I added it to all my existent screens [^image-2017-08-17-16-37-57-605.png]).\r\n *# You can decide what events will be notified to the users included in the 'Participants' custom field by going to the Project settings, Notifications section, and _Edit_ the current Notification scheme of the project, click the _Add_ link of the desired event, selecting the option \"User Custom Field Value\", and select your custom field ('Participants' in my example [^image-2017-08-17-21-42-12-852.png]).\r\n *# Now you will be able to use your custom field and mention as many users as required, applying the same rules to mentions described before, and they will appear on the right side of the issue view (see example [^image-2017-08-17-21-49-27-417.png]). \r\n*#* While the field is empty, it will not be shown, but you can Edit the issue to add 'participants' [^image-2017-08-17-21-46-45-806.png] or you can set a value like 'None' to make it appear all the time.",

Summary\r\n\r\nWhen migrating projects between instances - one populated source instance and newly created target instance, comment in the source instance's first ever created issue (ID 10000) shows up in a different project in the target instance's issue which has ID 10000.\r\nh3. Steps to reproduce\r\n # Create empty JIRA instance - we will call it \"source\":\r\n ## Create \"Project A\" with key \"PA\"\r\n ## Create \"Project B\" with key \"PB\"\r\n ## Create issues in this order:\r\n ### PB-1 (ID=10000)\r\n ### PB-2 (ID=10001)\r\n ### PA-1 (ID=10002)\r\n ## Comment in PB-1\r\n ## Link PB-2 to PA-1\r\n ## [Create backup|https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiraserver071/backing-up-data-802592964.html#Backingupdata-xml_backupUsingJIRA'sXMLbackuputility] \"backup1.zip\"\r\n # Create another empty JIRA instance - we will call it \"target\":\r\n ## Create \"Project A\" with key \"PA\"\r\n ## Create \"Project B\" with key \"PB\"\r\n ## Create issue PA-1 (ID=10000)\r\n ## [Import project|https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiraserver071/restoring-a-project-from-backup-802592982.html#Restoringaprojectfrombackup-projectimportProjectImport] PB from\u00a0backup \"backup1.zip\"\r\n\r\nh3. Expected result\r\n\r\nPB-1 in \"target\" instance has comment added in step 1.4.\r\nh3. Actual result\r\n\r\nPA-1 in \"target\" instance has comment added in step 1.4.\r\nh2. Workaround without keeping cross-project issue links\r\n\r\nThere are multiple options:\r\n # Modify \"source\" instance backup to not contain issues with keys present in \"target\" instance.\r\n # Modify \"source\" instance backup to not contain issue links to issues outside of imported project.\r\n # Modify \"source\" instance backup in any other way to not meet the reproduction conditions from above.\r\n\r\nAll backup modifications can be done by:\r\n # Import\u00a0full backup to an empty instance\r\n # Make modifications (delete issues/links/...)\r\n # Export backup\r\n\r\nh2. Workaround without losing any issue link data\r\n{panel:borderColor=#FFE7E7|bgColor=#FFE7E7}\r\n(i) The steps below are to be tested very thoroughly before executing them in production and to be used at your own risk. \r\n{panel}\r\nh5. I. Export issue links\r\n # Install the\u00a0[ScriptRunner add-on|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/6820/scriptrunner-for-jira?hosting=server&tab=overview]\u00a0to use it's JQL functions.\r\n # For each project:\r\n ## Run a JQL search with the query\u00a0_project = PKEY and issueFunction in hasLinks()_\r\n ## In the results, only show columns:\r\n *** Key\r\n *** Summary\r\n *** Linked issues\r\n ## Export the current fields to CSV. If you end up with more than 1000 issues, refer to\u00a0[Exporting a filter result containing more than 1000 issues|https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirakb/exporting-a-filter-result-containing-more-than-1000-issues-191500982.html].\r\n ## Open the\u00a0CSV file in Excel and convert data to columns\r\n ## Remove the\u00a0*Issue id*\u00a0and\u00a0*Parent id*\u00a0columns from the Excel file and save again, this will change the delimited of the CSV file into\u00a0*;*\r\n # Once you export issue links for all the migrated projects, delete all of them from the DB so they're not included in the XML backup.\r\nNote that we're deleting all links but subtask and epic links:\r\n{code:sql}\r\nDELETE FROM issuelink WHERE linktype NOT IN (SELECT id FROM issuelinktype WHERE linkname IN ('jira_subtask_link', 'Epic-Story Link'));\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nh5. II. XML backup and project import\r\n # Run an XML backup on the staging instance after deleting the issue links\r\n # Import the projects one by one to your target instance\r\n # Validate the comments and the attachments mapping is not broken\r\n\r\nh5. III. Issue links import\r\n\r\nFor each project:\r\n # Make sure all custom issue link types from your source instance are present in your target instance\r\n # Refer to\u00a0[Running the CSV file import wizard|https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiraserver076/importing-data-from-csv-945111490.html#ImportingdatafromCSV-howRunningtheCSVfileimportwizard]\u00a0to import the exported CSV with issue links.\r\n # In\u00a0*Advanced*, change the delimiter to\u00a0*;*\u00a0and hit\u00a0*Next*.\r\n # Select the project you're importing the links to and hit\u00a0*Next*.[|https://getsupport.atlassian.com/secure/attachment/3216050/3216050_external_import_2.png]\r\n # Map the fields and links accordingly. Be sure to tick all the checkboxes and hit\u00a0*Next*.\r\n # Kick off the import and wait for it to finish\r\n # Validate the issue links are there as expected\r\n\r\nh2. Why is this happening\r\n\r\nThis is because 2 things:\r\n * Import will treat PA-1\u00a0on both instances as the same issue. Issue link between PB-2 and PA-1\u00a0will be migrated.\r\n * There is a hack in\u00a0{{IssueLinkPersisterHandler}} that uses collection of mapped issue IDs\u00a0as mechanism to enforce issues reindexing. This is sometimes* overwriting issue ID mapping used by comment import\u00a0to find newly created imported issues. The behaviour is there since 2008.\r\n\r\n*when issue from imported project had originally the same ID\u00a0as existing issue linked from\u00a0\"target\" to some issue from imported project\r\nh2. Notes\r\n\r\nThe bug will affect issue history as well as attachments",
