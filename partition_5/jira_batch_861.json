However, I have found out that there is no support for retrieving History or Activity information.  I am currently using XMLRPC, but SOAP does not have the functionality either (as far as I can tell).  There is a getComment() function, but no getHistory or getActivity?\r\n\r\nMy use case:\r\n\r\nI am creating a script that will constantly search the JIRA database for new changes.  IE, if issue PROJ-4 was recently changed from open to closed, or someone posted a new comment on PROJ-4, I would like to know about it.  I have this scripting working for Bugzilla and Trac, where I would iterate through the history to see if these changes occurred.  With JIRA, I see no easy way of doing this.  It would be nice if these RPC functions could be implemented. Thank you.",

The problem is that we currently have 20 projects and 8 issue states which would require me to create 160 email addresses, mail servers, and mail services. This I suppose is a work around to the issue except that the support for this is impossible so I consider a non-starter solution. I sent in a support request dealing with this issue:\r\n\r\nhttps://support.atlassian.com/browse/JSP-62775?page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:all-tabpanel\r\n\r\nI looked at both solutions, but the advanced mail handler plug in isn't 4.1 complaint. I will have to create a specialized mail handler but it seems to me that you can already read the issue from the subject since I can use this to comment on existing issues even without any defaults in the handler parameters. I would think it would be possible and very easy since most of the architecture is already set up to overwrite the project and issuetype in the subject of the email. Basically I want to mail something to the email address set up in a service where the subject line would be something like:\r\n\r\nproject=RM, issuetype=8, issuename=Testing Email Issue Creation for Project RM\r\n\r\nand body:\r\n\r\nTesting the creating of an issue under project RM.\r\n\r\nWhich would create a new issue with type 8 under the project RM with an initial comment of \"Testing the creating of an issue under project RM.\"",

Your input in the comments helps us understand how this affects you and what you're hoping to accomplish with JIRA.\r\n\r\nAt this time, this suggestion is not on the JIRA development roadmap. Please remember that jira.atlassian.com is one of many inputs for the JIRA roadmap. You can [learn more about our process here|https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/110373/how-does-the-jira-team-use-jira-atlassian-com].\r\n\r\nI understand that our decision may be disappointing. Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nDave Meyer\r\n[dmeyer@atlassian.com|mailto:dmeyer@atlassian.com]\r\nProduct Manager, JIRA Platform\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\nIt seems that there is no way (or none that I'm aware of) how to search for issues that are blocked by unresolved issues, resolved issues or not blocked by other unresolved issues at all (to see which issues I can work on). That would be really useful feature, because now I can have saved search filter with issues assigned to me, but I have to go through them one by one to see which are not blocked by any other. Also, it's useful to see which issues are blocking others, because we usually want them to be done first.\r\nI found a \"linkedissues\" function but that can refer to only one issue.",

When QA goes to qa and close the issue often the 'resolution screen' is used even though the resolution, often times, is already set. Using the 'resolution screen' a second time during the workflow is common and allows QA to decide and mark the bug as unfixable, won't fix, cannot reproduce, etc.\r\n\r\nPreviously, with 'Resolution Date', the field would only change values when the value was set initially or changed.\r\n\r\nNow the value is being reset every time a transition form displays the field, even if it isn't changed. \r\n\r\nI marked this as critical because there are lots of issues that aren't closed until long after they are resolved - resetting the resolution, or resolved date, every time the field is shown is wrong.\r\n\r\n*Steps to Replicate*\r\n# Create a workflow using 'open', 'verify' and 'closed' statuses\r\n# On the transition from open to verify use the 'resolved issue screen' as the transition form\r\n# On the transition from verify to closed use the 'resolved issue screen' as the transition form\r\n# Create an issue\r\n# Transition it to verify, set the resolution\r\n# Note the date/time of the resolved date\r\n# Wait 5 minutes (or just one, depending on your patience level)\r\n# Transition from verify to closed, not touching the resolution\r\n# Note the *'new'* date/time for the resolved date.

Your feedback is key to helping us understand how you use JIRA so we can continue improving your experience. We have reviewed this issue over the last few days; however there are no immediate plans to put this suggestion on our near term roadmap.\r\n\r\nPlease consider using the [SSL for JIRA|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.atlassian.jira.plugin.jirasslplugin/server/overview] add-on from the Atlassian Marketplace.\r\n\r\nI understand that our decision may be disappointing. Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nDaniel Franz\r\ndfranz@atlassian.com\r\nPrincipal Product Manager, JIRA Platform\r\n{panel}\r\n  \r\n\r\nAdding a cert to the keystore is a somewhat painful process. A browser does this automatically. There's a blog from [sun|http://blogs.sun.com/andreas/entry/no_more_unable_to_find] with a utility that does this programatically. It'd be nice to add an SSL cert to the keystore programatically through JIRA, or better yet a cross-product library.",

For someone who migrates from 4.0.2 the changes still don't feel natural.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe idea to keep action buttons and workflow actions on the screen while scrolling is nice! \r\nthat scrolling mechanism has some drawbacks. in some cases the scrollbar appears that sort of kills the mouse-wheel\r\n(see screenshot). to reproduce: scroll down on issue http://feedback.onjira.com/browse/BOX-1\r\nand click on a lower sub-task menu (number 4 for ex). The view jumps and the additional scrollbar does not go away.\r\n\r\n\r\nI dont like the buttons on top for actions and workflow. There is one rule I would recommend to follow: *make same things look the same!*\r\nIf some workflow actions are buttons and some are memnu-points, how do they differ? well they dont but one could think so.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is also some white space below the work logs. I understand it is difficult to fill it. So I got a suggestion.\r\n\r\n\r\nMove the work log inside the issue area (marked in green on the screenshot).\r\nThen the width could be used in full for starting with the description. \r\nAlso it might be an idea to make that area flippable, so it could be vertical or horizontal.\r\n\r\nThe vertical way would be more for people like me\r\nThe horizontal would be more for modern fashioned folks.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are other things as well:\r\n* you cheat the fix versions, affects versions and components information (marked in magenta) by cutting it\r\n* marked in blue is more what i would like to see together (type, priority, assignee, status, as most important ones)\r\n* comments are hovered on mouseover but one cannot click on them. coloring comments odd / even with a background would make a calmer layout and would avaoid additional lines to distinguish comments\r\n* the breadcrumb navigation on top lacks the issue / sub-issue structure.",
