      "description": "h3. Summary\r\n\r\nService Desk agents are unable to create tickets on behalf of existing customers via Service Desk REST API.\r\n\r\nThe JIRA Service Desk API expects the customer's username on the *\"raiseOnBehalfOf\"* parameter, however, due to a recent change on the Portal Only accounts, the customer's username no longer matches the user's email address, which is commonly used as the value of *\"raiseOnBehalfOf\"*.\r\n\r\nh3. Environment\r\n\r\nThis bug mainly affects users who have set their own web form to create tickets on JIRA Service Desk via API.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1 - Create Service Desk request using the command below. Replace the IDs accordingly:\r\n\r\n{code}\r\ncurl -D- --request POST \\\r\n  --user agent@domain.com:<API_Token> \\\r\n  --header 'Accept: application/json' \\\r\n  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\r\n  --data '\r\n    {\r\n      \"serviceDeskId\": \"sd-id\",\r\n      \"requestTypeId\": \"requestypeid\",\r\n      \"raiseOnBehalfOf\": \"inexisten-address@domain.com\",\r\n      \"requestFieldValues\": {\r\n        \"summary\": \"Request JSD help via REST\",\r\n        \"description\": \"I need a new *mouse* for my Mac\"\r\n      }\r\n          }' \\\r\n  --url 'https://site.atlassian.net/rest/servicedeskapi/request'{code}\r\n\r\n2 - Repeat the same command.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nYou'll have two tickets created on your Service Desk.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nThe first call will create both the customer account and the Service Desk request, while the second call will return the following error:\r\n\r\n{noformat}\r\n{\"errorMessage\":\"Your request could not be created. Please check the fields have been correctly filled in. Please provide a valid value for field 'Raise this request on behalf of'\",\"i18nErrorMessage\":{\"i18nKey\":\"sd.validation.request.creation.failure.required.field\",\"parameters\":[\"Please provide a valid value for field 'Raise this request on behalf of'\"]}} {noformat}\r\n \r\nh3. Notes\r\n\r\nAt the moment, this only affects new Service Desk customers whose usernames are stored in a \"hash\" format.  Accounts that the username and email address match each other are not affected by the bug.\r\n\r\nh3.Workaround\r\nNone at the moment",
