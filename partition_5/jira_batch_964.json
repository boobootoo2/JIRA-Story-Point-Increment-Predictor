Your input in the comments helps us understand how this affects you and what you're hoping to accomplish with JIRA.\r\n\r\nAt this time, this suggestion is not on the JIRA development roadmap. There are a number of add-ons on the Atlassian Marketplace available to support this. Please remember that jira.atlassian.com is one of many inputs for the JIRA roadmap. You can [learn more about our process here|https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/110373/how-does-the-jira-team-use-jira-atlassian-com].\r\n\r\nI understand that our decision may be disappointing. Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nDave Meyer\r\n[dmeyer@atlassian.com|mailto:dmeyer@atlassian.com]\r\nProduct Manager, JIRA Platform\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\nA customer requested cascading fields that have more than 2 levels of variables. They specifically requested the ability to have up to a 3 level - 4 level deep cascading field list. \r\n\r\nPerhaps this could be programmed in such a way that would easily allow customers to add as many levels as they wished?",

In my case I import issues from our previous system with jelly scripts and I have a pb since they are no jelly tags for Votes. A new tag will enable me to add the votes relative to the issue when I create it. Of course the tag should include the name of the voter. I hope this new feature is not too tricky to be implemented ... Thank you very much in advance for your help !\n\nRegards,\n\nC\u00e9cile Gorin\n\nPS: Perhaps could you give me a workaround ? I know the way to insert votes directly into the database but I would prefer to avoid doing that...Thanks !",

Almost every tracking system has problems with this level of detail, because you often want the single issue to remain a single issue (ie no cloning) but somehow to be fixed for different versions / branches at different times.\n\nMy suggestion to solve this effectively and simply is as follows:\n- a custom field which can be applied to different projects where you want this ability\n- an advanced searcher for the above field\n\nThe custom field would display checkboxes for each version in the fix versions field (ie derived data), with each checkbox indicating whether or not the issue had been fixed in that version. \n\nThe searcher would then allow you to query 3 things:\n- find issues which HAVE been fixed in versions x, y, z (ie have the checkbox checked and a fix version set for those versions)\n- find issues which HAVEN'T been fixed in versions x, y, z but are scheduled (ie checkbox is not checked but fix version is set)\n- find issues with ALL/ANY/NO unfixed versions (ie issues with all/any/no unchecked checkboxes)\n\nThings to think about: how the custom field gets the values from the fix version field - most likely some sort of funky Javascript.",

This configuration would occur in the Administration UI.\n\nAnother possible point to consider is logging across a cluster. If it ever appears the auditer might be leveraged to let admin.s administer federated logging.\n\n*NOTE* - the clustering comment applies to current thinking for Confluence, not JIRA.\n\nFurthermore, it would be nice if the auditer could work across both Confluence and JIRA - both product customers probably have a need for this level of logging. I'm creating this issue under Confluence for the timebeing but it is a relevant consideration for JIRA also.\n\n ",

I've set up some spreadsheets that write Jelly XML for them which they can then load in through Jira. An alternative would have been to define a CSV format for them to use and import.\n\nTrouble is that both methods require the user to have admin access to be able to run the import process.

Your input in the comments helps us understand how this affects you and what you're hoping to accomplish with JIRA.\r\n\r\nAt this time, this suggestion is not on the JIRA development roadmap. There are several add-ons that support this mentioned in the comments below. Please remember that jira.atlassian.com is one of many inputs for the JIRA roadmap. You can [learn more about our process here|https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/110373/how-does-the-jira-team-use-jira-atlassian-com].\r\n\r\nI understand that our decision may be disappointing. Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nDave Meyer ([dmeyer@atlassian.com|mailto:dmeyer@atlassian.com])\r\nProduct Manager, JIRA Platform\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\nAdd the ability to create a linked issue.\r\n\r\nThis would be functionailty similar to 'Create a Sub-task' but for any arbitrary link type, for example 'Duplicate'.\r\n\r\nFor example when viewing issue A, you could click 'create linked issue' and it would send you to the create form - with an additional select box for the link type. The form could be prefilled with data from the original issue (ie project, component, versions etc). \r\n\r\n",
