      "description": "Dear Attlasian,\r\nPlease rollback recent UI change to Source Tree. It's terrible and unusable.\r\nMonochrome icons in toolbar probably looks good only in particular Windows theme, but not in default Windows theme. \r\nYour designers may persuade that flat design is cool, but usability of the program was GREATLY decreased.\r\nThankfully you left branch and commits tree without visible changes. They are colorful and help you, the other part of the UI is spiritless and does not help. \r\nI understand that you may have different opinion, but just try to use SourceTree on everyday job and you will see that new UI and icons are terrible. They may look naturally on Android, but not on Windows.\r\nBy the way, branch list looks very similar to Outlook 2013/2016 folders list. Same no visual vertical distinction between items, just text items, it is terrible.\r\nNew icons for file states: M doesn't have enough difference from ?. I should spent time and look more carefully what was changed.\r\nP.S. You issue tracker freeze my browser around 6 times while I fill in this issue. Scripts on the page should not freeze. Scenario: https://jira.atlassian.com/s/2\u2026ael.disabled=true&locale=en-UK:125\r\nP.S2. Your tracker does not find SourceTree version 1.8.1.0\r\n",
