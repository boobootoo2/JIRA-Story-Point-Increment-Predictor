Problem Definition\r\n\r\nCurrently, when deleting a custom field context, there are no warnings or confirmation pop-ups. The context is deleted directly, which can be problematic in the event that the custom field context is used widely, and the deletion was an accident.\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nImplement a pop-up that asks the user to confirm whether or not the user wants to delete the context, preferably also showing the list of issues that are using that context",

Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nAs an improvement, we could allow the ability to specify a directory when adding users.

This browser has disabled 3rd party cookies by default and\u00a0despite the warning about this, you can still create issues. But when you hit the submit button you see another warning saying \"there was a problem submitting your feedback\". I.e.: *you can't submit issues on Safari by default*.\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Log in to staging Bitbucket (staging.bb-inf.net) with Atlassian account in Safari\r\n # Go to Labs (tab on the left) and enable \"Atlassian editor\" integration\r\n # Go to [https://staging.bb-inf.net/owallhult/sverige/pull-requests/1/readmemd-edited-online-with-bitbucket/diff]\u00a0and try to add any comment. In the top right corner of the editor there's a \"Feedback\" button. Press it to open JIRA Issue Collector iframe.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n * Warning about 3rd party cookies is brighter and \"submit\" button is either disabled or hidden at all.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n * Warning about disabled 3rd party cookies is small and\u00a0the submit button is still active\r\n * When you click the submit button you see a\u00a0confusing message (summary)",

Note on Fix\r\n\r\nWe partially mitigated the problem by implementing JRASERVER-65352, this introduces timeout to the cache population operation and optional async loading. \r\n We will monitor the problem and would review it again if it gets more traction.\r\n \u00a0\r\n\u00a0",

Problem\r\nLong comments in JIRA can cause performance problems as investigated on [JRA-28519|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRA-28519]\r\nThere is a jira.text.field.character.limit set to 32767 by default in JIRA Cloud.\r\nThis prevents the saving of a comment with a message: \r\n{quote}\r\nThe entered text is too long. It exceeds the allowed limit of 32767 characters.\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nAt that point the user needs to either remove characters or copy the text already formatted on the comment to a text file, save it locally and attach it to the issue.\r\n\r\nh3. Suggestion\r\nProvide a full user friendly alternative when saving comments that go over the limit to improve the speed and convenience.\r\n\r\nh3. An idea:\r\nJIRA prompts to save the long text in an attachment.\r\nExample:\r\n{quote}\r\nThe entered text is too long. Would you like us to create a file attachment with text inside the text blocks?\r\n{quote}\r\nJIRA then parse the \\{code\\} and \\{noformat\\} text into a .txt file and attaches it to the issue.\r\nThen it adds the comment with the text that was outside the blocks, adds a preview of the blocks text and a link to the attachment containing the full text. If multiple blocks are find, then it does a different file for each one.\r\n\r\nh3. More info\r\nThis has been previously asked/requested on:\r\n* https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/16392971/what-is-the-best-way-to-hide-large-text-in-jira-issue-description\r\n* https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRA-59124\r\n",

Most JIRA Server instances are using the oldparallel method or Concurrent (CMS) methods to handle the JAVA garbage collection.\r\nh3.
