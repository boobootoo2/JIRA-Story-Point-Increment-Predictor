Problem Definition\r\n\r\nCurrently file replication for disaster recovery is completely in the hands of the individual customers to implement, resulting in a wide variety of different solutions. While that gives the flexibility to implement something that fits well into the existing infrastructure framework they already have in place, it also has the drawback of not being directly supported by Atlassian while at the same time _parts_ of it, i.e. the native Jira side, +is+ supported. This leads to a lot of \"passing the ball\" back and forth between Atlassian Support and the customer.\r\n\r\nThe file replication is also not (natively) confirmed in any way, leading to the possibility of files not yet having been synced to the DR location without an easy to way check.\r\nh3. Suggestion\r\n\r\nNative file replication of files needed for disaster recovery.\r\n\r\nFrom customer testimonial:\r\n{quote}Utilizing S3 based storage for attachments is our internal first step to providing the ability for our Jira DC instance to failover between physical data centers. It is essential for us to have DR support in the products that we support internally. Currently, in order to achieve some level of DR capability, we run a background process to synchronize files across our physical data centers.\r\n\r\nHaving Jira support this natively would be our preferred option, and in our opinion, would place Jira Data Center in a different class of application, that approaches the level we expect from a true Enterprise level application. It would also almost completely eliminate the need for NFS to run this application. From our research it appears that aside from attachments, there appears to be only 1 additional file that needs to be shared within the cluster.\r\n{quote}",

Issue Summary\r\nThis bug was found and shared by a vendor working on Structure Plugin(https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/34717/structure-project-management-at-scale\\) on a test instance of JIRA.\r\n\r\nTheir plugin [Structure Plugin|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/34717/structure-project-management-at-scale] \\- includes a Jira Dashboard Gadget. Structure Gadget uses Atlassian dropdown elements \\(one of them shown on the picture\\). \r\nIf a user tries to open this dropdown menu the following error happens in the console \\(AUI 8.5.0\\):   \r\n\r\n\\{code}\r\nUncaught TypeError: parent.hasAttribute is not a function\r\n    at getClosestIgnoredElement \\(skate-0.12.6.js:1236\\)\r\n    at MutationObserver.documentObserverHandler \\(skate-0.12.6.js:92\\)\r\n\\{code}\r\n\r\non attempt to call parent.hasAttribute where parent is a document JS object. \r\n\r\nDocument object doesn't have this method of Element. Safeguard \"parent \\!== document\" doesn't helps because two different document objects are used. Gadgets on Jira App Dashboard are shown in iframe elements \\(so gadget has his own document JS object\\). \r\nAn dropdown menu is added to main page document(not to gadget iframe\\) and because of that parent=addedNodes[0].parentNode(where addedNodes[0] is added dropdown\\) is outer page document. At the same time  'document' var in getClosestIgnoredElement\\(\\) method points to gadget iframe document object. As a result parent \\!== document is true.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Try to open this dropdown menu in the Jira Dasboard gadget provided by the Structure plugin\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nWork normally as expected\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nThe following error happens in the console on attempt to call parent.hasAttribute where parent is a document JS object (AUI 8.5.0):   \r\n\r\n\\{code}\r\nUncaught TypeError: parent.hasAttribute is not a function\r\n    at getClosestIgnoredElement \\(skate-0.12.6.js:1236\\)\r\n    at MutationObserver.documentObserverHandler \\(skate-0.12.6.js:92\\)\r\n\\{code}\r\n\r\nh3.

The node who make the change contains the correct value, and even though the other nodes receive cache invalidation message, they display the incorrect previous value.\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Setup a 2 node DC cluster (I used Jira 8.5.8)\r\n # Create a blank SCRUM project. This will create an issue type scheme: _KEY: Scrum Issue Type Screen Scheme,_ with two issue type defined within: Default, and Bug\r\n # (i) You can setup TRACE logging on _com.atlassian.jira.cluster.distribution.localq, com.atlassian.jira.cluster.distribution.localq.LocalQCacheManager, com.atlassian.jira.cluster.distribution.localq.LocalQCacheReplicator, net.sf.ehcache.distribution_ , and/or enable SQL log if you wish to review log as shared in the [Expected Results] section below\r\n # Setup two browsers, and log in one browser to node 1, the other to node 2.\r\n # Open Network Tools on each, then visit Network Tab and choose Disable cache, so that we always get the fresh page from the server\r\n # Edit the Issue Type Screen Scheme, EG, [http://NODE/secure/admin/ConfigureIssueTypeScreenScheme.jspa?id=10000|http://node/secure/admin/ConfigureIssueTypeScreenScheme.jspa?id=10000] on each browser\r\n # On node1, edit \"*Bug*\" to be the *KEY: Scrum Default Screen Scheme*\r\n # Refresh page of node 1\r\n # Refresh page of node 2\r\n # (i) Note that both nodes show the correct values\r\n # Now on node 2, edit \"*Bug*\" to be the *KEY: Scrum Bug Screen Scheme*\r\n # Refresh Node 1\r\n # (i) Note that Node 1 incorrectly shows KEY: Scrum Default Screen Scheme\r\n # You can now refresh node 1 and node 2 as much as you want and the incorrect value will stick on Node 1\r\n\r\n(i) You do not have to switch change from Node 1, to Node 2. Even two sequential change on Node 1 will cause the bug, provided that the _ConfigureIssueTypeScreenScheme_ is accessed on a different node in between changes\r\n\r\n(i) This is on an individual ITS Scheme basis. IE, if you change a scheme once, then change a different scheme once, both changes will apply to all nodes\r\n\r\n(i) This can be triggered with just a single change to the Issue Type Screen Scheme. The reproduction steps show multiple changes because this was the most reliable path to replicate the problem.\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nBoth node 1 and node 2 show the same Screen Scheme configuration. In our test:\r\n * Default = KEY: Scrum Default Screen Scheme\r\n * Issue Type Bug = KEY: Scrum Bug Screen Scheme\r\n\r\nWhen creating a new issue of type Bug in the relevant project, the fields shown are that of the scheme that was set. IE: Issue Type Bug will get fields for screen in _KEY: Scrum Bug Screen Scheme_\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\n(x) Node 1 incorrectly shows _KEY: Scrum Default Screen Scheme._\r\n\r\n(x) When creating a new issue of type Bug in the relevant project, the fields shown are that of the incorrect _Key: Scrum Default Screen Scheme_\r\nh4.

      "description": "h3. Issue Summary\r\n\r\nIt's a sort of chicken & egg problem. On restart when the system is in Upgrade Mode, we display dismissible/minor warnings in the form of a Johnson Page. In order to dismiss the warnings and continue, we first need to log in to Jira. The default redirect is to login.jsp. However, in order to login via\u00a0SSO, the login process is different. The browser also has to access the `.../plugins/servlet/samlconsumer`--a url that gets blocked by the same Johnson Filter we're trying to dismiss.\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Set up SSO in a DC instance (say on 8.5)\r\n # Upgrade a single node.\r\n ** The node should either have some sort of configuration problem that would prompt a warning Johnson Page, OR:\r\n ** start the upgraded node with the `-Djira.johnson.simulate.failure=POST_DATABASE_ACTIVATED:warning-dismissible` flag to force a dismissible johnson page to appear (note, you still have to be in upgrade mode for this to work, unfortunately)\r\n # Click the \"Ignore all warnings and continue\" button\r\n\r\n!Screenshot_2020-10-14 Jira access problem.png!\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nThe warning page gets dismissed and the admin is able to login normally with SSO.\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nA 503 is returned, and the user is directed to a blank page.\r\nh3. Workarounds\r\n\r\n1) Logging in with basic auth or some other mechanism, using the oauth fallback url (needs to be\u00a0\u00a0[enabled|https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirakb/bypass-saml-authentication-for-jira-data-center-869009810.html]\u00a0beforehand)\r\n\r\n2) Fixing the minor problems mentioned in the warning and restarting the node is another option.\r\n\r\n3) The following JAVA parameter can be added to the nodes during the upgrade `-Djira.startup.warnings.disable=true` which will effectively disable that warning page on first login to the node that's been upgraded (drawback is that the admin will not be notified of any other warnings that might be important for the upgrade)",

Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Create or Edit Issues\u00a0\r\n # Add an attachment to the issue\u00a0\r\n # Cancel creating or editing the issue after adding the attachment\r\n\r\nNOTE: This will create a temp file located in\u00a0<Jira home>/caches/tmp_attachments.\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nThe expectation is that these temp files would be cleared or deleted automatically after canceling the issue. The reason for this expectation is that when you create an issue or edit an issue with an attachment the file is created and removed automatically.\u00a0\r\n\r\nAccording to documentation [DefaultTemporaryWebAttachmentsMonitor|https://docs.atlassian.com/software/jira/docs/api/7.0.4/com/atlassian/jira/web/action/issue/DefaultTemporaryWebAttachmentsMonitor.html], the job should be clearing these tmp files automatically.\u00a0\r\n{quote}This class maintains a list of temporary attachments uploaded by a user. When the user's session expires or the user logs out, it is responsible of deleting any temporary files that were not converted to proper attachments.\r\n\r\nSince:\r\n 6.4\r\n{quote}\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nWhen canceling an issue that you are editing or creating with an attachment the temp file is not removed automatically. When logging out from the user it does not remove the temp file.\u00a0\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nThere are currently two workarounds for this issue that should delete these files.\r\n * Removing the files manually or through a task from <Jira home>/caches/tmp_attachments\r\n * Attempting to stop the Jira instance which should clear the tmp_attachment folder completely.\r\n ** Stop the Jira instance\r\n ** Confirm that tmp_attachment folder has been deleted located in<Jira home>/caches/\r\n ** Start the Jira instance (This should create again the tmp_attachment folder)",
