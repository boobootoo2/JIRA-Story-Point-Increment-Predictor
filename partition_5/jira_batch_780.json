I started with the example CSV given in the help pages:\r\n\r\nSummary,Worklog\r\nOnly time spent (one hour),3600\r\nWith a date and an author,2012-02-10 12:30:10;wseliga;120\r\nWith an additional comment,Testing took me 3 days;2012-02-10 12:30:10;wseliga;259200\r\n\r\nAnd I adopted it to work as three updates to my own sample project as follows:\r\n\r\nIssue Key,Project Name,Project Key,Summary,Worklog\r\nTEST-34,Test project,TEST,,3600\r\nTEST-34,Test project,TEST,,20130210123010;mbrown;120\r\nTEST-34,Test project,TEST,,Testing took me 3 days;20130211123010;mbrown;259200\r\n\r\nThe intent here is to have all three lines update a single JIRA item, TEST-34, in my project named \"Test project\". I had to adjust the date/time strings to match my desired format, but that was minor. Everything worked correctly except that the overall Time Spent on TEST-34 was 72 Hours, rather than 73 Hours 2 Minutes as expected. (3600 + 120 + 259200 should add to 73 hours 2 minutes, but instead the last entry of 295200 just forced the total time to 72 hours.)\r\n\r\nHere is the CSV mapping file I used. You'll note that the worklog column is mapped to field.worklog, not to Time Spent. Out of curiosity, how many fields can go into the Worklog column separated by semi-colons?\r\n\r\n{\r\n \"field.Project Name\" : \"project.name\",\r\n \"date.import.format\" : \"yyyyMMddHHmmss\",\r\n \"field.Worklog\" : \"worklog\",\r\n \"field.Issue Key\" : \"issuekey\",\r\n \"field.Project Key\" : \"project.key\",\r\n \"user.email.suffix\" : \"@medaptus.com\",\r\n \"mapfromcsv\" : \"true\",\r\n \"field.Summary\" : \"summary\"\r\n}\r\n\r\nCopied from https://ecosystem.atlassian.net/browse/JIM-908",

the Components field will cause high CPU load and 10sec+ for anything entered in the field to register.\r\n\r\n- Firefox appears to be the least affected browser. Although not as fast as one might desire, the load time is only a few seconds for both Create Issue popup and for anything to register in the Components field.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\nAny slow load time during Auto-Complete in the Components field will not be affected by this. This can be used to work around the problem in Internet Explorer, in case it is not possible to use a different browser.\r\n- Disable the Create Issue popup.

My profile was set up to receive the emails via Text. \r\n\r\nEach morning I receive the email but the formatting is off which makes the links useless.  It appears to be adding the issue key to the previous summary link.  The screenshots may tell a better story.  The 1st one is what the email looks like.  The 2nd one is of the error message and format of the link int he address bar.\r\n\r\nI did change the email format to HTML and it solved the incorrect linking but still not wild about the format b/c we're using sub-tasks. The summary section  includes the parent issue in the summary links.  \r\n\r\nPS: What happened to the issue collector on EACJ.  Those things are awesome.\r\n\r\nh5. Findings:\r\n* The problem happens to users that using plaintext for email and only happens to subscriptions.\r\n* Reported working fine in Outlook client and working fine in Ymail as well. It seems only impact Gmail client.\r\n* Ran a lots of testing and a possible cause of the problem seems to due to length of the link/base url. I tried with 51 characters for the whole link: https://localhost.ismylove.com/123/browse/TESTING-3 and the subscription render nicely. If I change the base url slightly to https://localhost.ismylove.com/1234/browse/TESTING-3 the link rendering would be broken for 52 characters.",

Provide the option to require resolution via a checkbox (because the transition or status name is some form of Close/Closed/Answered/Resolved/etc) or some form of UI element that doesn't require going back and editing the transition once it's created.\r\n\r\nTaking that a step further, being able to save elements of a transition for reuse (favorite?) or copy them from other workflows would be awesome.  Thinking similar to the move dialog for a page in Confluence... Workflowname > Transition Name copy to Currentworkflow > From Status1 to Status2. \r\n\r\nThere are ways to mitigate this by efficiently reusing old workflows, but that isn't always possible (and not everyone is always that efficient).  Something that satisfies the above I think would be a very nice admin quality of life improvement.\r\n\r\nIf any of this is unclear I can Photoshop up some ideas.\r\n",

He suggested by down-scoping the context to specific projects or removing the field altogether, performance could be improved.\r\n\r\nFor those of us with hundreds of globally-scoped fields (where global was the default, \"just in case\" it was needed) this is a large undertaking.\r\n\r\nI'd like Jira to be able to carry out a custom field \"audit\" which would do the following:\r\n# Build a tree of all custom fields, their context, and for fields with pre-defined options, the frequency of each values use.\r\n# List projects where a field has never been used, or used in less than x% of Jiras in that project.\r\n# List those fields where a global context is specified, but where the fields are used in 50% or less of all Jira projects. By \"used\" I mean issues where the given field actually has a value set.\r\n# Provide a list of fields that are not used in any filters. This is pretty extreme, but should give a good indicator of how useful a field actually is.\r\n\r\nFollowing the audit, the user should be given basic options to:\r\n# Automatically or manually down-scope the context of a given field. The automatic function would reduce the scope of the field to those projects where the field has one or more issues with the value set.\r\n# Remove options from any fields with pre-defined options if any one or more of those options was never used\r\n# Remove fields in their entirety if \r\n## They've never had a value set in any jiras OR they've only had a value set in x # jiras or less\r\n## There hasn't been a value set for that field in over x period of time\r\n## The field is not referenced by any filters\r\n",

Cause\r\n\r\nA group membership is being synchronised from the remote directory which already exists, and JIRA is attempting to add this. There are a few reasons why the remote directory would synchronise such memberships, including but not limited to the following known bugs:\r\n\r\n| CWD-3147 | If a user exists in two directories in an application, and is added to a group in one directory that it was already in the other, clients get duplicate key errors |\r\n\r\nh4. Workaround\r\n\r\nFlushing the cache of the directory will stop the error from happening, and cause the directory to synchronise fully, until the next time a duplicate group membership is sent from the remote directory. The simplest way of forcing this is:\r\n\r\n# Disable the directory\r\n# Enable the directory\r\n\r\nFor the specific causes there may be workarounds in the linked bug tickets.",
