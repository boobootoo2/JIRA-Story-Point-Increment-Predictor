Current situation\r\nCurrently, JIRA is set so that even after a custom field is added into the navigator columns in the Administrator page, it might not appear in the search columns (of the issue Navigator). This happens if the project is set to a specific context (a certain project or issue type). If the specific project or issue type is not chosen as the search criteria, it will not appear in the search columns. \r\n\r\nFor example, the user have 3 projects, Project A, Project B, Project C, and one custom field, Custom X. Custom X is set to only show in Project A. User then adds Custom X to the Navigator Columns. The user then tries searching in a global context, selecting all projects. Custom X does not appear in the search columns. However, if the user specifies the search to only search in Project A, Custom X will appear in the search columns.\r\n\r\nh3. Improvement Request\r\nIt would be useful if the custom fields would appear in the search columns regardless of the context of the custom field. So, users won't have to specify the exact project or issues and the custom fields would still appear, as long as they have been added into the Navigator Columns",

      "description": "We recently switched our project that handles \"Support Requests\" from restricting assignable users to project members (< 100) to assignable users including all employees that might use JIRA (3984).\r\n\r\nBefore this change, \"Bulk Edit\" -> \"Edit Issues\" was previously a comfortable speed of a few seconds or less. Now, if I select \"Edit Issues\" and \"Next\", for a selection of just 38 issues - it took 34 seconds to switch to the next screen just now. This is the best case as I am running this operation at 11:12pm at night. Earlier today during peak time in the afternoon, the same operation with 51 issues was not completing in several minutes (we didn't time it other than to note that several minutes had passed at which point we gave up waiting).\r\n\r\nAs the operation was taking a long time to complete, and as I knew it was happening, I began to investigate.\r\n\r\nI noted that the JIRA process was consuming 100% of one CPU core. As I know this typically means that one Java thread is running at full speed, I used \"jstack\" to view the thread stacks. I noted one thread in particular here:\r\n\r\n{noformat}\r\n\"http-8080-7\" daemon prio=10 tid=0x00007fef800e6000 nid=0x4df0 runnable [0x00007fef9145b000]\r\n   java.lang.Thread.State: RUNNABLE\r\n        at java.lang.String.toLowerCase(String.java:2390)\r\n        at com.atlassian.crowd.embedded.impl.IdentifierUtils.toLowerCase(IdentifierUtils.java:42)\r\n        at com.atlassian.crowd.embedded.impl.IdentifierUtils.compareToInLowerCase(IdentifierUtils.java:56)\r\n        at com.atlassian.crowd.embedded.impl.IdentifierUtils.equalsInLowerCase(IdentifierUtils.java:70)\r\n        at com.atlassian.crowd.embedded.api.UserComparator.equal(UserComparator.java:74)\r\n        at com.atlassian.crowd.embedded.ofbiz.OfBizUser.equals(OfBizUser.java:101)\r\n        at java.util.ArrayList.indexOf(ArrayList.java:216)\r\n        at java.util.ArrayList.contains(ArrayList.java:199)\r\n        at java.util.AbstractCollection.retainAll(AbstractCollection.java:369)\r\n        at com.atlassian.jira.issue.fields.Assignees.bulkOptionsForFrotherControl(Assignees.java:115)\r\n        at com.atlassian.jira.issue.fields.AssigneeSystemField.getBulkEditHtml(AssigneeSystemField.java:202)\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nOnce I had time to look more closely - I noticed that the above has a dreaded call to AbstractCollection.retainAll(). I checked the implementation of Assignees.bulkOptionsForFrotherControl() and found:\r\n\r\n{code}\r\n        ...\r\n        for (Issue issue : issues)\r\n        {\r\n            List<User> issueAssignableUsers = assigneeService.getAssignableUsers(issue, actionDescriptor);\r\n            if (bulkAssignableUsers == null)\r\n            {\r\n                bulkAssignableUsers = issueAssignableUsers;\r\n            }\r\n            else\r\n            {\r\n                // Keep filtering the list to only include users assignable for ALL issues.\r\n                bulkAssignableUsers.retainAll(issueAssignableUsers);\r\n            }\r\n            ...\r\n         }\r\n         ...\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nThe AbstractCollection.retainAll() implementation in Java 6 is:\r\n\r\n{code}\r\n    public boolean retainAll(Collection<?> c) {\r\n        boolean modified = false;\r\n        Iterator<E> e = iterator();\r\n        while (e.hasNext()) {\r\n            if (!c.contains(e.next())) {\r\n                e.remove();\r\n                modified = true;\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n        return modified;\r\n    }\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nTo compare two unordered lists using the AbstractCollection.retainAll() method means it must compare each element to each other element. For 3984 assignable users - to compare 3984 to 3984 users takes 3984 x 3984 = 15,872,256 operations to complete.\r\n\r\nTo make matters worse - it's not a simple comparison. As you can see from the stack trace, it is calling IdentifierUtils.toLowerCase for the left side, and presumedly the right side, before performing the comparison. So the 16 million operations are actually 16 million complex operations.\r\n\r\nFinally - the above happens for every issue except the first. Presuming that each of the issues has the same set of assignable users - 3984 users in my case - then a bulk edit of 51 issues would run the 16 million operations x 50 issues = 800 million operations.\r\n\r\nWow. :-)\r\n\r\nI believe this issue should be directed towards the new \"Enterprise\" team to fix.\r\n\r\nThanks!",

To reproduce\r\n\r\ni) type a search term into \"Quick Search\"\r\nii) press the back button\r\niii) press the forward button\r\n\r\nSome variety of confusing dialogs ensue, but the user does not return to their search. All searches have the URL, for example https://jira.atlassian.com/secure/IssueNavigator.jspa rather than a URL which is related to the search, of the style that has been popular pretty much since search engines have been invented (e.g. Google). \r\n\r\nIn the recent versions of JIRA, we now get the EXTRA dialog from JIRA itself \"Unsaved changes - confirm that you want to navigate away\" - in addition to the dialogs from the browser \"Confirm form resubmission\". This is an awkward user experience that interrupts this very common workflow. Please could you supply proper URLs at least for the case of simple searches as has been common in commercial search engines for a long time - it is understandable if complex JQL searches are not bookmarkable and degrade, but it should be possible to supply URL support for a variety of straightforward searches.\r\n\r\nMany thanks",

Symptom\r\n\r\nAttempting to startup JIRA presents the following error:\r\n\r\n{noformat}\r\n****************************************************************************************************\r\nFailed to start JIRA due to a build number inconsistency.\r\nThe data present in your database is newer than the version of JIRA you are trying to startup.\r\nDatabase version is: 6096\r\nJIRA app version is: 733\r\nPlease use the correct version of JIRA. You are running: 5.0.6#733-sha1:f48fab7a0abaa0a316c14a3fc86cdf5a6805ba12\r\n****************************************************************************************************\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\n(i) The build numbers will vary dependent upon the version of JIRA being used.\r\n\r\nh3. Cause\r\n\r\nA test/dev/sandbox instance was started up against the same database production is using. This will trigger upgrade tasks to run and will alter the database so that it is setup for the new version. As the check is not performed at runtime, the production instance will not know this has happened until a restart is attempted, at which point the check is executed and the startup will fail.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nThis can be fixed with either of the two options, *after the test/dev/sandbox instance has been pointed to the correct test database*.\r\n\r\n# Perform  an emergency upgrade on the production instance to the same version as test as per [Upgrading JIRA|http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Upgrading+JIRA].\r\n# Restore an XML backup or database backup from *prior* to the upgrade by the test/dev/sandbox server. One can be found on the test/dev/sandbox instance under {{$JIRA_HOME/export/jira_autoexport_20130530_102302.zip}} (the naming convention will vary as it depends upon the date).\r\n\r\nPlease note that if the first option is selected the integrity of the database cannot be guaranteed, as JIRA was never designed to have multiple instances utilising the same database. This can cause critical data integrity issues that may be irreparable. \r\n\r\nh3. Resolution\r\n\r\nWe have seen users frequently connect their test/dev/sandbox instances to the production database accidentally.\r\n\r\nThe use case is an admin copies their {{$JIRA_HOME}} for testing, but the {{dbconfig.xml}} file is still pointing to their production database. If the {{dbconfig.xml}} file is forgotten to be altered to point at a testing database, when that server starts up it this will then fire off upgrade tasks at the production database from the testing installation if it is on a newer version.\r\n\r\nI would like to request a database lock (maybe a table entry to the {{$JIRA_HOME}} lock file, and its pairing {{$JIRA_INSTALL}} directory, or some other method of uniquely identifying an instance) during bootup or some sort of other workaround to avoid the situation of two JIRA installs pointing at one database as this is a common occurrence.",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-29581].\n  {panel}\n\nCurrently we get a lot of support cases due to plugins and anecdotally I have seen a lot of them relating specifically to upgrades. Often when a customer upgrades they will leave their old plugins in {{$JIRA_HOME/plugins/installed-plugins}} and this can cause a number of problems during that upgrade process. We have even had one of our experts even get confused about this in the docs and raise a support case about it.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, there's some differences between docs as outlined below and it can be a bit confusing.\r\n\r\nBoth [Upgrading JIRA|http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Upgrading+JIRA] and [Migrating JIRA to Another Server|http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Migrating+JIRA+to+Another+Server] have the following in the Before You Start section:\r\n\r\n{quote}\r\nIf you have installed any additional JIRA plugins (i.e. not included with JIRA), please verify that they will be compatible with the version of JIRA you are upgrading to. You can find a plugin's compatibility information from the the plugin's home page on the [Atlassian Plugin Exchange|https://marketplace.atlassian.com]. Once you have confirmed the availability of compatible versions, you should upgrade your plugins after successfully upgrading JIRA. This can be done via the *'Plugin Repository'* in your *Administration Console*.\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nAnd then [Upgrading JIRA Manually|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Upgrading+JIRA+Manually] has the following in section 3.2:\r\n\r\n{quote}\r\n* *Plugins*\u2014 For any plugins that you had installed in your old JIRA:\r\n*# Download the plugin version for your new version of JIRA from the [http://plugins.atlassian.com] site.\r\n*# [Install the JAR file(s)|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Managing+JIRA%27s+Plugins] in your new JIRA, and carry out any other required installation for the plugin.\r\n*# If the plugin has a properties file, apply the same changes to it as you had in the old properties file (don't just copy over the old properties file).\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nAnd [Migrating JIRA to Another Server|http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Migrating+JIRA+to+Another+Server] has the following in section 3.2:\r\n\r\n{quote}\r\n* *Plugins* \u2014 For any plugins that you had installed in your old JIRA, download the plugin version for your new version of JIRA from the [http://plugins.atlassian.com] site.\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nThe main problem here is that if the customer follows the first piece of the docs, they can proceed with an upgrade that can cause problems on their JIRA instance. For example, if they try to upgrade and restore an XML backup that requires a custom field from a plugin, and that plugin isn't enabled because the plugin was disabled due to being incompatible the upgrade process can fail.\r\n\r\nIf they follow the [Upgrading JIRA Manually|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Upgrading+JIRA+Manually] part in 3.2, this is the best suggestion as it will get them to upgrade their plugins manually on the new install by putting the new JARs into {{$JIRA_HOME/plugins/installed-plugins}} before starting up JIRA, and they can avoid incompatibility problems (unless they install the wrong version).\r\n\r\nIt doesn't clearly list to do it that way, and I'm wondering if you can modify both [Upgrading JIRA Manually|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Upgrading+JIRA+Manually] and [Migrating JIRA to Another Server|http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Migrating+JIRA+to+Another+Server] so it would have something like the following, maybe even in its own section:\r\n\r\n{quote}\r\nh3. Plugins\r\n\r\nPrior to starting JIRA up, it is important to ensure the new version has the correct plugins installed. Any incompatibilities can cause significant problems during the upgrade - to avoid this, please follow the below instructions to upgrade your plugins manually:\r\n\r\n# Manually move all your plugins from {{$JIRA_HOME/plugins/installed-plugins}} to a temporary directory.\r\n# Check the [Atlassian Marketplace|https://marketplace.atlassian.com] for the most recent version of the plugin that is compatible with the new JIRA version.\r\n# Download that plugin JAR and install it into the {{$JIRA_HOME/plugins/installed-plugins}} directory.\r\n# Repeat steps 2-3 for each of your plugins.\r\n# After installing all the new versions of the plugins, start the new version of JIRA up.\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nPerhaps this isn't the ideal way of doing it, however it should help provide more information to customers on the impact their plugins can have on upgrading, and also get them to manually upgrade the plugins before upgrading so as to reduce the number of support issues we get.\r\n\r\nThanks!",
