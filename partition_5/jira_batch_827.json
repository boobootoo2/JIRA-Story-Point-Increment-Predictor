We recently implemented JRA-14369, which resolves several of the improvements described on this issue \u2013 specifically, you can now selectively add and remove values during a bulk edit operation for JIRA's system multi-select fields, including labels, components, affects versions, and fix versions.\r\n\r\nWe have decided to close this ticket because we have no plans to address the remaining requests around label management. Our intent is to ensure that there is a functional difference between Components and Labels. One is a lightweight \"tag\" that any user can create, one is a set of objects created by a project administrator. We would prefer to extend the capabilities of each of these features individually, rather than allow their functionality to overlap more than it already does.\r\n\r\nWe expect the new bulk edit functionality to make it substantially easier to correct cases where you need to \"merge\" labels. There is also a [free add-on on the Atlassian Marketplace|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/ca.uwo.jira.plugins.labelbot] to assist with this.\r\n\r\nPlease don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nDave Meyer\r\nProduct Manager, JIRA Platform\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\nWouldn't it be nice to have a way to manage Labels, maybe from the Project Administration screen? Currently there is not a way to mass manage Labels. Doing a Bulk Edit on a set of issues replaces (removes) all current Labels with only the new label for all issues, instead of adding the new label to the existing label set for each issue. This makes Bulk Editing Labels almost useless, since it is very uncommon to have issues with all existing Labels in common. Being able to Bulk Add/Remove/Rename a label, would be incredibly convenient. \r\n\r\nWouldn't it be nice to be able to merge Labels? Sometime users will create different Labels which essentially mean the same thing, management should be able to merge these Labels. For instance 'grey' + 'gray' >> 'grey'.\r\n\r\nWouldn't it be nice for management to be able to lock-down Labels? Sometimes users are just down right bad at creating appropriate Labels, and once a bad label is created, other users start using it as well. Maybe from Project Administration, administrators could create a set of Labels to be used in that project, and then users could only select from that set of Labels. If a user really feels like they need a new label it could always be requested.",

The requests go through the firewall because the baseURL variable is set to the NAT address of the instance. Of course it's possible to change the baseURL to localhost, but then links in e-mail subscriptions and notifications wouldn't work any longer. \r\n\r\nThat's why I think a seperation into an internal and external baseURL would be very helpful. External baseURL could be used in e-mail notifications. Internal baseURL could be used for operations/requests that don't leave the domain like the refresh of a gadget.\r\n\r\nI already had opened a support request https://support.atlassian.com/browse/JSP-95077. There I was pointed here.\r\n\r\nDo you need any additional information? If there's already a workaround or a another solution I really would appreciate to read about it.\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\nFalk",

We handle this by having a single Jira account appear as default reporter when the email is imported.\r\n\r\nThe problem our customer service representatives have when working these tickets is that they have no idea who the email is from or who it was sent to (other than the Jira account). To resolve this, I created a patch for CreateIssueHandler.java that modifies the recordedFromAddressForAnon method. The modification expands on the \"[Created via email received from: ... ]\" tag line and adds another line below \"[Created via email sent to: ... ]\".\r\n\r\nI would like to request that this be incorporated into future versions of Jira.\r\n\r\nHere's the updated module code:\r\n\r\nprivate String recordFromAddressForAnon(User reporter, Message message, String description) throws MessagingException\r\n{\r\n// If the message has been created for an anonymous user add the senders e-mail address to the description.\r\nif (reporteruserName != null && reporteruserName.equals(reporter.getName()))\r\n{\r\ndescription += \"\\n[Created via e-mail \";\r\nif (message.getFrom() != null && message.getFrom().length > 0)\r\n\r\n{ description += \"received from: \" + message.getFrom()[0] + \"]\"; }\r\nelse\r\n\r\n{ description += \"but could not establish sender's address.]\"; }\r\ndescription += \"\\n[Created via email sent to: \";\r\nif(message.getAllRecipients() != null && message.getAllRecipients().length > 0)\r\n{\r\nAddress[] addresses = message.getAllRecipients();\r\nfor(int i=0; i < addresses.length; i++) { description += addresses[i] + \" \"; }\r\ndescription += \"]\";\r\n}\r\nelse\r\n{ description += \"but could not establish reciever's address(es).]\"; }\r\n} \r\nelse\r\n{\r\ndescription += \"\\n[Created via email sent to: \";\r\nif(message.getAllRecipients() != null && message.getAllRecipients().length > 0)\r\n{\r\nAddress[] addresses = message.getAllRecipients();\r\nfor(int i=0; i < addresses.length; i++) { description += addresses[i] + \" \"; }\t}\r\ndescription += \"]\";\r\n}\r\nelse\r\n\r\n{ description += \"but could not establish reciever's address(es).]\"; }\r\n}\r\nreturn description;\r\n}",

This is causing even more issues when i tested an upgrade to 4.4.3.\r\n\r\nIn 4.4.3 the User Directory Sync will not even run successfully because it gets to a group which is also in the sub-domain and throws an error. \r\n\r\n2011-10-26 09:26:31,445 QuartzWorker-0 ERROR ServiceRunner     [atlassian.crowd.directory.DbCachingDirectoryPoller] Error occurred while refreshing the cache for directory [ 10000 ].\r\njava.lang.IllegalArgumentException: duplicate key: Guests\r\n\tat com.google.common.collect.RegularImmutableMap.<init>(RegularImmutableMap.java:62)\r\n\tat com.google.common.collect.ImmutableMap$Builder.fromEntryList(ImmutableMap.java:210)\r\n\tat com.google.common.collect.ImmutableMap$Builder.build(ImmutableMap.java:196)\r\n\tat com.google.common.collect.Maps.uniqueIndex(Maps.java:456)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.crowd.directory.ldap.cache.AbstractCacheRefresher.synchroniseMemberships(AbstractCacheRefresher.java:126)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.crowd.directory.ldap.cache.AbstractCacheRefresher.synchroniseAll(AbstractCacheRefresher.java:44)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.crowd.directory.ldap.cache.UsnChangedCacheRefresher.synchroniseAll(UsnChangedCacheRefresher.java:223)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.crowd.directory.DbCachingRemoteDirectory.synchroniseCache(DbCachingRemoteDirectory.java:619)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.crowd.manager.directory.DirectorySynchroniserImpl.synchronise(DirectorySynchroniserImpl.java:63)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.crowd.directory.DbCachingDirectoryPoller.pollChanges(DbCachingDirectoryPoller.java:50)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.crowd.manager.directory.monitor.poller.DirectoryPollerJob.execute(DirectoryPollerJob.java:34)\r\n\tat org.quartz.core.JobRunShell.run(JobRunShell.java:195)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.multitenant.quartz.MultiTenantThreadPool$MultiTenantRunnable.run(MultiTenantThreadPool.java:72)\r\n\tat org.quartz.simpl.SimpleThreadPool$WorkerThread.run(SimpleThreadPool.java:520)\r\n\r\nThis is going to cause major issues and hence prevents us from even thinking about upgrading to any newer version than 4.4.1.\r\n\r\nI have also looked into using the LDAP filter to filter out the sub-domain or only filter in the OUs that i want to Sync, but that is impossible.

The info note on the JIRA close issue form even states \"Closing an issue indicates that there is no more work to be done on it, and that it has been verified as complete,\" which indicates to me that zeroing the remaining time is the expected behavior. This was partially mitigated when using GreenHopper as the close/resolve screens had the default option to zero the remaining time, but this useful feature has been removed from those GreenHopper screens.\r\n\r\nRequiring every user to manually add post functions is error-prone and places an undue burden on the end-user.

Create a new, clean database. Use the schema name 'jiraschema'.\r\n2. Make sure to follow the instruction on http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Connecting+JIRA+to+SQL+Server+2008#ConnectingJIRAtoSQLServer2008-2CreateandConfiguretheSQLServerDatabase\r\n3. Restore the backup of your current database to this db/schema. \r\n4. Use the [configuration tool|http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Connecting+JIRA+to+SQL+Server+2008#ConnectingJIRAtoSQLServer2008-tool] in your 4.3.3 install to add the schema name to your configuration file.\r\n5. Try the upgrade again.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Option 2:+\r\nAlternatively, you can use the XML backup method for upgrading:\r\n\r\n1. Make a XML backup of your 4.3.3 JIRA instance.\r\n2. Run the setup wizard (connect it to a new, clean database) and log in in the new instance.\r\n3. Restore the backup in the 4.4.3 instance.\r\n4. Stop JIRA, copy the attachments folder from 4.3.3 home to 4.4.3 home folder.  \r\n\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nRuchi",

This issue listener seems to play by the same rules as the rest of the JIRA listeners, in that it is executed in a non-deterministic order with whatever other listeners have been added.  If the ordering of this system issue listener falls AFTER the execution of a listener that updates the issue in response to an event, the correct data gets overwritten in the index.\r\n\r\nNote the following scenario I have observed with one of our listeners:\r\n\r\n# User comments on an issue\r\n# Issue comment event is fired\r\n# Our custom listener is called and updates the issue (new assignee) which in turn triggers the proper events (since we are doing the update via the Jira IssueService).\r\n## A new round of events is fired due to this update\r\n## This triggers a reindex through JIRA's IssueIndexListener that appears to run successfully\r\n# JIRA's IssueIndexListener kicks in again, but now with the original IssueEvent -- the one that has the assignee value prior to our update\r\n# Index is updated with the OLD assignee value\r\n\r\nThe failure to ensure the built in IssueIndexListener runs before user specified listeners basically results in corruption of the index causing invalid data on user dashboards and search results.  What makes it even more fun is that everything can be working just fine and the addition of a new listener could cause a reordering that breaks a configuration that was working previously.",
