Expected results\r\nThe user is deleted, and can be recreated by adding them afresh as a customer within Service Desk.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual results\r\nUser Management says the user was successfully deleted, but it still exists in the \"Portal-only users\" list. From then on it can't be changed or re-added in any way. Trying to re-add the user in Service Desk's \"Customers\" page for the project gives an error saying:\r\n\r\nbq. This customer was deleted. You'll need to <a href=\"https://example.atlassian.net/admin/users\">recreate their account</a> before you can invite them to the Service Desk.\r\n\r\n(Complete with the raw HTML).\r\n\r\nTrying to click the \"Activate\" button in the user list results in a \"Could not find the specified user\" error in the UI and a 404 from {{/rest/servicedesk/customer-management/noeyeball/1/local-servicedesk-user/activate?username=<username>}} with the following body:\r\n\r\n{code}\r\n{\r\n    \"errors\": [\r\n        {\r\n

The only change I made to the help field is adding the extra '12345' characters, which pushes the help field text under the field it is intended to explain.  Previously all help field text stayed on the right side of their respective field, regardless of wiki markup and length.

Environment\r\n* CLOUD 3.3.0-OD-1000.564.0\r\n* REST API 1000.445.0\r\n* REST API latest - https://docs.atlassian.com/jira-servicedesk/REST/cloud/#servicedeskapi\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Create a ticket via REST API where the reporter is listed on the request participant's list. E.g. POST:\r\n{code}https://INSTANCE.atlassian.net/rest/servicedeskapi/request\r\n{\r\n    \"serviceDeskId\": \"2\",\r\n    \"requestTypeId\": \"16\",\r\n    \"requestFieldValues\": {\r\n        \"summary\": \"Request JSD help via REST 2\",\r\n        \"description\": \"I need a new mouse for my Mac\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"requestParticipants\": [\r\n        \"user1\",\r\n      \t\"MyReporter\"\r\n    ]\r\n}{code}\r\n# Now try to remove any other participant from the list. E.g. DELETE:\r\n{code}https://INSTANCE.atlassian.net/rest/servicedeskapi/latest/request/JSD-44/participant\r\n{\r\n    \"usernames\": [\r\n        \"user1\"\r\n    ]\r\n}{code}\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\n* The user should be removed from the request participant's list.\r\n< OR >\r\n* The error message should be clear on what the problem actually is.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nThe following error message shows up:\r\n{code}{\r\n    \"errorMessage\": \"Failed to update request participants field, errors: \",\r\n    \"i18nErrorMessage\": {\r\n        \"i18nKey\": \"sd.request.participants.error.field.update.failed\",\r\n        \"parameters\": [\r\n            \"\"\r\n        ]\r\n    }\r\n}{code}\r\n\r\nh3. Notes:\r\n* Via UI it's possible to remove that user from the request participant's list. \r\n* The problem only happens when the reporter is also into the request participant's list.\r\n\r\nh3.Workaround\r\nDo not add the reporter into the request participant's list.",
