The report is based on the date selected in the field.

The report uses the value of the field, 09/Jan/17.\r\n\r\nh3.

The installation will proceed nroamlly, and when concluded a notification will be displayed that JIRA Core must be updated to match the new application's version.\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\nHave JIRA check if the new application is compatible before the installation, and if it is not, display a warning to the admin notifing him of this.\r\n\r\nh3. Why this is important\r\nIf an admin mistankingly uploads a .obr file for a application not compatible with the current JIRA Core version, this will make it so that application stops functioning.

The current list of such characters is:\r\n{code:java}\r\n+ - & | ! ( ) { } [ ] ^ ~ * ? \\ :\r\n{code}\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nHowever, it is not working as expected. Searching like summary !~ \"*\\\\]\" fails with error \"The text query '*\\]' for field 'summary' is not valid: the '*' and '?' are not allowed as first character in wildcard query\" and summary !~ \"\\\\]\" returns all the issues. \r\n\r\nI came across to this [bug report|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRA-40790] which was eventually not closed as *Answered*. \r\n{quote}\r\nTo do this we use Lucene's ClassicTokenizer which:\r\n# Splits words at punctuation characters, removing punctuation. However, a dot that's not followed by whitespace is considered part of a token.\r\n# Splits words at hyphens, unless there's a number in the token, in which case the whole token is interpreted as a product number and is not split.\r\n# Recognizes email addresses and internet hostnames as one token.\r\n\r\nAs a result the \"[\" and \"]\" characters are neither added to the index or retained in the phrase query.\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nThere were comments about documentation update to avoid confusion but there was no follow up whether a ticket has been created for that or not.

Steps to Reproduce\r\n * Set up a JIRA instance.\r\n * Modify your database credentials via {{dbconfig.xml}} to be incorrect.\r\n * Start up JIRA\r\n * Go to JIRA (\\{\\{http(s)://<instance-url>/jira}})\r\n\r\nh3.

Summary\r\n\r\nUsers in JIRA are not notified of issues or comments created via email, even if they should. Same users are notified of issues or comments to issues if they are created in UI. We've been able to replicate this consistently in clean instances.\r\n\r\nh3. Environment\r\n\r\nJIRA Cloud, version: 1000.656.2 (not available in Affects Version/s field)\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Create a ticket via email using User A (with access) - make sure User B is notified for 'Issue Created'\r\n # Add User B as watcher to the ticket - make sure that watcher are notified for 'Comment created'\r\n ** This is an example, we could also replicate this by assigning the ticket to User B, instead\r\n # Add a comment to the ticket via UI (comment 1)\r\n # As User A send a comment to this ticket via email (comment 2). You can use the notification from comment 1.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nUser B is notified for\u00a0issue creation and both comment 1 and comment 2.\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nUser B is only notified on comment 1.\r\nh3. Notes\r\n\r\nThis is very similar to this bug:\r\n https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRA-63582\r\n\r\nHowever, that one is for JIRA Server and for Outlook, so I'm not sure if they are related.\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nFrom [~jtillett916844748]:\r\n\r\n{quote}\r\na workaround would be to create a filter to look at issues created in the past 15 minutes and create a subscription to fire every 15 minutes.

      "description": "h3. Summary\r\n\r\nLucene Search with unlimited PageFilter causes unnecessarily memory allocation for enterprise instances (1M+ issues).\r\n\r\nIn many places unlimited PageFilter is used in JQL queries (Agile board, plugins such as JQL Tricks). This leads to the allocation of an array which has number of documents items, where number of documents is typically greater than number of issues.\r\n\r\nFor 1M+ issues the object size usually is greater than G1HeapRegionSize/2 so it's humongous object. Take a look at related issue\u00a0https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRA-63315\u00a0to see why\u00a0humongous objects are painful.\r\nh3. Environment\r\n * instance with 1M+ issues\r\n * JIRA 6.4.13+\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Configure JVM to use at most 32g (exclusive, for xms and xmx). It might be easier to use less memory and then the problem should be visible with less issues.\r\n# Enable GC logging: {{-XX:+PrintGCDetails -XX:+PrintGCTimeStamps -XX:+PrintReferenceGC -XX:+PrintAdaptiveSizePolicy}} \r\n # Any search with unlimited PageFilter is fine. It can be Agile board (default filter seems to use unlimited result set) or eg. linkedIssuesInQuery function from JQL Tricks plugin.\r\n # Single request is not enough. Try to do thousands of them within a minute.\r\n # Observe in GC logs:\r\n{noformat}\r\n2016-12-23T09:35:27.143-0500: 84706.348: [GC pause (G1 Humongous Allocation) (young) (initial-mark)\r\nDesired survivor size 75497472 bytes, new threshold 1 (max 15)\r\n- age 1: 187032496 bytes, 187032496 total\r\n- age 2: 41910368 bytes, 228942864 total\r\n, 0.3112215 secs]{noformat}\r\nand eventually frequent Humongous Allocation will cause high memory pressure and could lead to frequent  Full GC:\r\n{noformat}\r\n2016-12-23T09:51:09.273-0500: 85648.478: [Full GC (Allocation Failure) 15G->5439M(20G), 22.7404778 secs]\r\n[Eden: 0.0B(1120.0M)->0.0B(1336.0M) Survivors: 0.0B->0.0B Heap: 15.8G(22.0G)->5439.5M(20.0G)], [Metaspace: 471107K->471107K(1523712K)]\r\n[Times: user=35.18 sys=0.02, real=22.74 secs]{noformat}\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nSearch does not cause Humongous Allocation without the good reason.\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nHumongous Allocations are present, and also\u00a0Full GC (Allocation Failure) may happen slowing down the whole instance.\r\nh3. Notes\r\nAs part of the fix, additional logging will be be implemented. To enable it:\r\n* {{com.atlassian.jira.issue.search.providers.LuceneSearchProvider}} should be set to DEBUG level.\r\nIt logs only queries which try to fetch more than 1000 documents. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\nh3.
