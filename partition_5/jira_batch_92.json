I know, it's WPF but i also know Visual Studio's latest versions (at least GUI parts) written in WPF and doesn't suck that much.\r\n* When i right click on the left pane, i want to see which item i've right clicked. It should be selected. But instead \"File status\" is selected momentarily. This also sucks.\r\n* Escape key does not work when i do something requires a git command to be executed. For instance after i switch a branch, i cannot press escape to dismiss that popup-ish thing.\r\n* I can tab to anything while the popup is showing up. I can focus on files in \"Log/History\" tab and i can switch to see diffs of other files. Also upper tab bar is focusable. It shows a big dashed rectangle around tab bar. Keyboard navigation is a mess.\r\n* Tab bar hover animation is bouncy. Close button and tab height have a bouncy animation but tab text have only ease in animation.\r\n* Whole application becomes unresponsive sometimes.",

This is despite the fact that in Advanced Installer I picked the option 'Admin level install if user in admin, user-level install otherwise'.\r\n\r\nI checked this with the Advanced Installer team, and it turns out that the option is somewhat badly named. What it actually does is perform an Admin-level 'All Users' install if it's *possible* to escalate to Admin, not just if the user is already Admin - this means that on Vista upwards you always get a request to escalate to Admin.\r\n\r\nIn order to truly perform a user-level install we have to add an extra dialog to the installer to let the user choose whether to install for all users, or just for themselves.",

Nowadays various technologies improve and changes so fast that many IT solutions have such implementations and configurations of the technical and software infrastructures which are impossible to have in their local PCs or Macs. It is obvious that their DEV environments have to be similar to the production ones. And yes they code remotely. \r\nAs I understand you use GIT/Mercurial output and interpret it. So As an option we could choose a repository in local drive, o to enter an SSH user, pass/private key (or pageant protocol). So SourceTree could communicate through SSH tunnel using the same git commands and getting the same git output.\r\nIT IS ABSOLUTELY MUST BE IMPLEMENTED!  \r\n\r\nGreat work by the way ;) Very sad I can't use it :(\r\n\r\nAudrius   ",
