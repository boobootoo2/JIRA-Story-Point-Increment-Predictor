This is not happening if the current user only has access to see one of the fields, for example they only have access to projects for which one of the custom fields does not have context. This especially causes problems when the type of custom field is different, causing the JQL to fail if you try to for example use the \"~\" operator because one field is of type text, but the other field is of type \"select list\" which does not support the \"~\" operator.\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n# Create Project A\r\n# Create Project B\r\n# Create two custom fields with the same name\r\n# Change one of the custom fields so that it only has context on project B\r\n# Configure separate permissions schemes on Project A and B\r\n# Create a user and change Project B's permissions scheme such that the new user does not have browse access\r\n# While logged in as that user, try to type in JQL in the advanced search, with the custom field name used for both custom fields, notice that only one of the values shows up in the list, but it includes the cf\\[#####\\] form\r\n# Hit enter to select the custom field from the list of one\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\n# The cf\\[#####\\] form should be used in the JQL query\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\n# The quoted name of the custom field is used in the JQL query, making that query ambiguous\r\n\r\nh3.Workaround\r\n\r\n# Manually type the cf\\[#####\\] form of the custom field\r\n# Use different names for different custom fields",

Problem Definition\r\nUsing [JIRA for Assets Management|http://blogs.atlassian.com/2015/03/free-ebook-jira-service-desks-guide-asset-management/] requires users to enter several issues at once. \r\n\r\nAlbeit JIRA allows users to use the \"create another\" feature to log issues one after another, that is tiresome when entering many issues, specially as you have to wait for the form to be submitted to fill another issue.\r\n\r\nAnd creating CSV files requires you to create a separate file, which becomes more and more complicate, and requires users to manage things in excel and then export to CSV and import into JIRA, which duplicates the information the user needs to store (once in Excel and then in JIRA).\r\n\r\n\\\\\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\nIt would be great if JIRA provided a \"Bulk Create\" feature, which would allow the user to select the project / issue type in which the issue would be created.\r\n\r\nThen, select what fields would be available to enter (similarly to how the Create Issue screen works with the *Configure Fields*). \r\n\r\nThe user could then simply use tab to go through all fields of the issue. Once it hits the end of the row, it would add a new line with empty fields for a new issue - similarly to how adding rows to a Confluence Table works. After filing the \"rows\" of the \"table\", the user can just submit the form once, which would create all needed issues.",

That does not only affects the footer which can be adjusted manually for each product (See end-user-agreement, 6.4 Attribution) but also the information within html headers.\r\n\r\nProviding those information even to anonymous users on any login mask could be abused to identify security flaw. So if we just remove the version out of the footer, the page it self still contains any needed information, e.g.:\r\n{code}<meta name=\"application-name\" content=\"JIRA\" data-name=\"jira\" data-version=\"6.4.1\">{code}\r\nAlso all manuell changes are not fully prove for upcoming update and increase therefore the impact of maintenance. In short: Editing templates is just _quick and dirty_ and could not be the best practice.\r\n\r\nI suggest to give end users (in administration role) the opportunity hide all internal information for not logged in users. Such a system should only provide the login mask and in addition to the EUA 6.4 the \"powered by Atlassian\" term.\r\n\r\n*Benefit and Business value*\r\nEach product become more secure and more resistant to potential attacks. In my opinion this is helpful for all of your business customer who needs there Atlassian stack or single product online. ",
