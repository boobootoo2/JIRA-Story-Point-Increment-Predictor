      "description": "As of Jira 7.13, it is understood that most, if not all functions related to a project are ruled by the Project's Permission scheme. On top of this, it is assumed by most users that Application access is on a security layer on top of the project's Permission scheme and this is generally true but there is an exception: \r\nwhen a user is involved in a ticket as the reporter, watcher or assignee, and an event is triggered, the Notification scheme checks who should receive the notification for it, and it is required that each user has the _Browse project_ permission. \r\n\r\nWhen talking about the Browse project permission, one of the sections of options is *Application Access* and from that list, we have \"Any logged in user\". In theory adding this to the Browse Project permission will allow any existent user in the database to see the issues of the project BUT it does not consider if the users have application access and this leads to users without any application access (like Service Desk customers) to technically have browse project permissions even when they cannot log in directly to Jira. This itself is not a problem, as cannot log in to Jira after all, but this in turn enables an scenario with the Jira Notifications, as the Notification scheme does not validate application access either, and when an event is triggered, the validation seems to be like this:\r\n# Event fired (let's say Issue creation)\r\n# Checks the users/groups/roles involved included in the event (Assignee, Reporter, watchers, etc) and validates they have_Browse projects_ permission and sends the notification email to all that do (regardless of application access).\r\n\r\nWhen a user creates and issue and sets another user as the reporter, if that new reporter does not have application access, and the previous scenario is met (Browse project permission including \"Any logged in user\" and Notification scheme including the reporter for the \"Create  Issue\" or any other event), the user without application access will receive Jira notifications, showing internal comments and changes that would normally not be visible to customers.\r\n\r\nAll this make sense in a logical way but since the assumption for \"Any logged in user\" is that it does not supersedes the application access, the behavior seems counter intuitive. \r\n\r\nThe suggestion is to add a note in the [Managing project permissions|https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiraserver/managing-project-permissions-938847145.html] OR in the [Configuring email notifications|https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiraserver/configuring-email-notifications-938847633.html] documentation pages, indicating that Users without application access will still receive notifications in this scenario.",

Description\r\nIf a customer wants to set up their permission scheme so only Administrators, Reporters and Watchers can Browse Issues on that project, the Watcher can only be added when creating the issue. If the issue is already created, the same user cannot be added as Watcher as he primarily doesn't have access to browse that issue.\r\n\r\nh3. Use Case\r\nCustomer wants to configure a project permission scheme where only Administrators, Reporters and Watchers can Browse Issues on that project.\r\n\r\nAt first, he changed the permission scheme like the above. When creating a new issue on that project and adding a Watcher that primarily didn't have access to the issue (because he wasn't an Administrator, nor the Reporter), the issue is created with success and the user is added as a Watcher normally.\r\n\r\nBut, if the issue is created without him added as a Watcher, and then the Administrator tries to add him, Jira returns with the message that he doesn't have access to view the issue, so it won't add him as Watcher.\r\n\r\nh3. Investigation Done\r\nWe successfully reproduced such issue internally on the latest Jira version available. We tried to work with Issue Security Schemes, where the standard Permission Scheme would have \"Browse Issues\" to anyone logged on, but setting a Default Security Scheme where the previous permissions were configured, but the same behaviour was noticed. Even if we had no security scheme on the issue, added the Watcher (as he HAD permission), but tried to edit the issue to set the Issue Security Scheme we had, it didn't work because the Watcher wouldn't have permission with that Security Scheme.\r\n\r\nWe also tested creating a \"Watcher\" role, adding users to it and configuring the Issue Security Level to allow the role to browse issue, but the same thing happens.\r\n\r\nThat being said, we speculate that when the issue is being created and a Watcher is added, either there is no validation on the Watcher field permission to view the issue, or the validation occurs after considering the user a Watcher of that issue. Differently from when an already created issue denies adding the user as he doesn't have access to it.\r\n\r\nh3. Solution Request\r\nWhen you have an already created issue which Issue Security Scheme or Permission Scheme allows the Watcher field OR role to browse the issue in that project, and you try to add someone as a Watcher to that issue, Jira should understand that I, who already have access to the issue, am adding that person as a Watcher so it can view the issue and have access to it, just like it works when creating the issue.",

Environment\r\n * Any version of Jira\r\n * Running behind reverse proxy with conservative timeout\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Go to *Administration > System > Backup System*\r\n # Start a backup of the instance\r\n # Wait a few minutes (until the proxy timeout is reached)\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nBackup is completed with no error message.\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nUser receives 504 Gateway Timeout error\r\nh3. Notes\r\n\r\nThis error happens because the backup procedure does not have a progress bar to indicate the state of the operation. When the backup is started, the browser keeps waiting for the backup to complete.\r\n\r\nIf the instance is fairly large, the backup will take longer than the proxy timeout configured and result in a 504 gateway timeout error. This is because there is no response from the application while the backup is being created.\r\n\r\nNotice that the backup operation is not impacted. If you wait for its completion, the backup will be available in the *export* directory of the local home.\u00a0However, we do not have any indication of the process\u00a0state besides checking if the backup file stopped growing and is zipped in the directory above.\r\n\r\nA possible solution would be having a progress bar to this process, as we have for the XML import procedure.\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\n(!) Increasing the proxy timeout is not feasible as the backup can take hours to complete\r\n # The first workaround is to wait for the backup to complete by checking the backup file in the *export* directory. Once the file stops growing and a .zip file is created, the backup should be completed\r\n # The second workaround is to add a non-proxy connector to server.xml, access the site using the connector and execute the backup",

      "description": "h4. Summary\r\n\r\nWhen an issue has enough comments to be collapsed, if there're comments created within the same second, they may be retrieved and displayed incorrectly by Jira.\r\n\r\n(i) This bug has a similar concept to JSWSERVER-13996.\r\n\r\nh4. Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nSo far this is only reproducible by using comment clone functions by 3rd-party add-ons e.g.\u00a0Clone Plus for Jira or Backbone Issue Sync for Jira:\r\n# Create an issue with 10+ comments\r\n# Use add-on function to clone the comments to another issue\r\n# View the issue where comments are cloned to\r\n\r\n(i) Alternatively, manually edit the db to set the comment created values to the same second for all comments.\r\n\r\nh4. Expected behavior\r\nComments are retrieved and displayed correctly as they are in the original issue.\r\n\r\nh4. Actual behavior\r\nA random comment may be missing whereas another random comment may be displayed twice.\r\n\r\nh4. Cause\r\nThis is caused by the way Jira retrieves comments from the database for the Comments tab when there're enough comments to be collapsed. Basically, Jira relies on the *created* column to sort the comments, and it assumes that there's a time gap (1 second+) between any 2 sequential comments. Due to the way comments are cloned using add-on, some comments might be written into the database having exactly the same created values (< 1 second difference), causing the comment sorting mechanism to break.\r\n\r\nh4. Notes\r\n# Without collapsing, the problem doesn't appear\r\n#* Collapsing can be disabled by setting _jira.comment.collapsing.minimum.hidden_ to 0 from Advanced Settings\r\n# The problem never appears in All tab (as opposed to Comments tab)\r\n\r\nh4. Workarounds\r\n# Vendors to modify add-on code to ensure comments are not created within the same second\r\n# Manually modify the db to set the comment created values to have at least a 1-second gap sequentially\r\n# Disable comment collapsing as per the Notes section",

They suggest that it would be more natural if they were immediately taken to the issue they just created.\r\n\r\nFurther, there have been a few cases where issues have had incorrect information entered into them, when the user hasn't realized that they aren't looking at the new issue. Sometimes the user realizes and cancels the edit, but if the current issue and the new issue look similar enough, they may not notice and then you have a lying ticket.\r\n\r\nSome other users appreciate the current behaviour, so I suggest a configuration option in the Preferences section of a user's profile. Something like a checkbox that says \"automatically open newly created tickets.\" Or, in keeping with the current screen for user preferences, a drop-down menu that would enable this feature.\r\n\r\nI've made my users aware of various workarounds, including right-clicking the 'Create' button to open the link in a new tab, thus avoiding the lightbox. However we all feel that the point of software like Jira is to minimize the potential for human error that impacts the integrity of the information in issues.\r\n\r\nThanks for your consideration,",
