If I go in ten minutes after that I will see fifteen minutes spent. When the \"Stop progress\" is pressed, the sum up will stop. \r\nThen you only need to enter the \"extra\" time spent on an issue. - And the actual spent time when working on the issue, will automatically be filled out. \r\nIt would save us coders a LOT of clicks and entering when working on small bugs and issues.\r\n\r\nJust to be crystal clear:\r\nThis is regarding starting / stopping the progress on an issue when a coder / supporter is working on an issue. Today he/she has to manually enter the time spent wheter the start/stop progress is pressed or not. - we would like a sum of the spent time to start when pressing start progress. - This way the reporter can follow the time spent and the assignee does not have to manually fill out this field afterwards since that part is done by JIRA automatically.\r\n\r\nWe could REALLY use this feature.\r\n\r\nThanks a bunch in advance. - And thanks for a fantastic tool. JIRA has already made our lives a bit easier.\r\nHave a great weekend and I hope to see this request implemented in the future.\r\nIf you have any questions do not hesitate to send me a mail.\r\n\r\n/Jens Bay\r\n\r\n",

      "description": "We get many support cases along the lines of, \"I reconfigured JIRA to use <database X> instead of HSQL, and now I get 404 errors.\".\r\n\r\nMost of these cases turn out to be one of:\r\n- missing JDBC driver\r\n- invalid XML in server.xml or entityengine.xml\r\n- wrong database username or password \r\n- database permissions problem - e.g. can't create tables\r\n\r\nI think a GUI interface to configure the database connection would make it easier for customers and help reduce the number of support cases. This GUI interface should be in two places:\r\n\r\n# In the [installer|JRA-14868], for the case when the customer wants to set up JIRA from the start to be using a proper database rather than HSQL.\r\n# In JIRA itself (in the administration interface), for the case when the customer has been evaluating JIRA using HSQL, and now wants to move to a real database to use JIRA in anger.\r\n\r\nIn this interface, we could ask the customer for:\r\n- database type\r\n- database server DNS name or IP address\r\n- database name\r\n- username \r\n- password\r\n\r\nWe could use the database type to check whether the correct JDBC driver is in the classpath, and if not, we could prompt the user for the location of the JDBC driver (and we could copy it into common/lib). We should also ship with any JDBC drivers that we are allowed to (MySQL and Postgres?).\r\n\r\nWe could also test the connection to the database, giving the customer immediate feedback of whether their parameters are valid.\r\n\r\nThe connection wizard in [DBVisualizer|http://www.minq.se/products/dbvis/] is a good example of such an interface.\r\n\r\nI realize that there are technical issues to solve around whether you would then update app server config files (e.g. conf/server.xml) and entityengine.xml, or whether you would use a completely different mechanism to save the database connection configuration. But it is all do-able.",

This would reduce the need for multiple levels to match the different combinations of Roles.  \r\n\r\nFor example, my company would like to create a Infrastructure Upgrades project.  This project will involve many outside consultants and internal staff.  I can use roles for permissions, and I can create the following issue security levels based on the roles we have - a sampling could be\r\n         Omniware Internal\r\n         Sales\r\n         Network Admin\r\n         External Gui\r\n         External Web Services\r\n         External Developers\r\n\r\nThis allows me to create issues for Sales people only that NetworkAdmins can not view.\r\n\r\nIf I want to assign an issue that both the Sales and Network Admin roles can see (e.g. a task relating to a product install at a client site), I would then need to create another security level for Sales_and_Network.  \r\n\r\nSo, if I have 5 levels representing 5 types of 'employees/security levels', I need to create 5 factorial (120!) levels to allow for all the different combinations.  \r\n\r\nInstead, I would prefer to simply select multiple security levels for an issue, i.e. \"Allow the Sales and Network Admin levels to view this issue\"\r\n",
