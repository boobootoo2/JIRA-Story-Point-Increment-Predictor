A work-around is described here: http://forums.atlassian.com/thread.jspa?threadID=12703 . As it is noted, this is very inconvenient operation. I suggest to support project key alteration within JIRA's user interface. This will eliminate all possible errors, humans can make during manual patching of XML backup and folders.\r\n\r\nA project key is very likely to be changed synchronously with the project renaming. It would be strange, if a project (say, software project) changes its name, but the key for it still contains an old prefix.\r\n\r\n*Workaround*\r\n\r\nCreate a new project, and bulk move all the issues into the new project. This way, they will still be able to be referenced by their old key and their new key.",

      "description": "There is no reasonably priced Test Case Management tool on the market - there is a big oportunity here to provide an obvious add on to Jira.\r\nThings like Mercury Test Director are enormously expesive when compared to Jira, and really, they dont do that much.\r\n\r\nI work in a medium sized software firm - about 60 employees. We have a dedicated testing team, of about 6-10 people. They mostly do manual functional testing, with detailed test cases which are derived from Use Cases and other specs.\r\n\r\nA couple of years ago we went down the path of writing our own test case management tool, because there was nothing reasonable in the market, either commercial or open source. We are now looking at redeveloping the tool, as it has maintainence problems. There is still nothing in the market.\r\n\r\nTest case management has an obvious integration with defect/issue management, so any tool would need to integrate with Jira.\r\nMuch better still would be if it was within Jira. It is the same users, projects, and generally there is a One-To-Many between test case and defect.\r\n\r\nThere are three parts to this - creating test cases, executing them, and reporting on them.\r\n\r\nIts pretty simple really - A project has many test cases, which may be linked to a Use Case (Issue type?) and maybe a version.\r\nEach test case has mutiple steps, which have an index and a description, plus some other minor fields.\r\nYou need a nice effecient interface to create these steps.\r\nEach test case can have many runs, or executions.\r\nWhen running a test case, a tester is presented with another UI that efficiently allows them to work through the steps of the test case, and mark each step as completed, or not. Where a step cannot be completed a defect may be created, which is automatically linked to the the run.\r\nThe other crucial thing is a set of reports that allows a project manager or test manager to see how many and which tests are passing, how many runs have been done, etc.\r\n\r\nAs I said, we are currently looking at redeveloping our test case tool, but would much rather use an externally developed product - and an add on to Jira would be the ideal solution. We could possibly help with the detailed requirements of such an addition to Jira. Please let me know if there is any interest.\r\n\r\nJon Nermut\r\nProject Manager\r\nDytech Solutions\r\nHobart\r\n03 6235 2222\r\n\r\n\r\n",

JSP include, using a requestwrapper etc.  In JIRA's ServletRequestDispatcher (webwork implementation), we capture the Request in a Thread Local, and use it later on in the request.  We also do the same with the action context.\r\n\r\nAfter each request has completed, it gets returned to the pool, and all of its internal state cleared.\r\n\r\nThe problem that has been introduced with the new decorator is that in the decorator gets the request out of the Thread Local (ActionContext.getRequest()): {{JiraResourcedModuleDescriptor.getDefaultVelocityParams()}}.  However, as this request has been released back into the pool, the request.getContextPath() has been cleared, which throws the NullPointerException.\r\n\r\nThe solution is for our templates to not depend on the HttpServletRequest object, but instead see what we use from it, and provide that to the velocity context instead.  A quick search shows that the request object isn't used in that many places (at least inside JIRA):\r\n{code}\r\nfor i in `find . -name *.vm` ; do grep \"\\$req\" $i | grep -v \"\\$req.getContextPath()\" | grep -v \"\\$req.contextPath\" ; done;\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nMostly we just use the contextPath, and we could find a better variable name for that.",
