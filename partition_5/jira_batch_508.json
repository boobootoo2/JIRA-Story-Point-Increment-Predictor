(This should render the \"Agent URL\" of the ticket)\r\n# Click on the issue link\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nThe page reloads and you'll be redirected to the same ticket.\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nYou'll be redirected to the Help Center (https://site.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portals)\r\n \r\nh3. Notes\r\n\r\nThis doesn't affect portal only accounts.\r\n\r\nh3.Workaround\r\n- Access the ticket via \"Requests\" in the top-right corner of the screen.",

Why this is important\r\nThe customer portal article view is too narrow. Screenshots are being resized to a point where they are not visible and unusable. For example:\r\n\r\n* In Confluence:\r\n !image-2020-01-19-10-01-32-221.png|thumbnail! \r\n* In Service Desk portal:\r\n !image-2020-01-19-10-03-47-933.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\nIn the Confluence old editor, images can be assigned a link.  This would allow images to be hosted in external storage and stored its original size. This means that a user could click on the resized screenshot in the portal view and then get a larger view of that screenshots. However, in the new editor, this is no longer possible. Images on the new editor can longer act as a hyperlink.\r\n\r\nh3. Additional Information\r\nAs the old editor is getting deprecated, it seems logical to implement this on a Service Desk portal's article OR allow the images on the Confluence new editor to be assigned a link.\r\n\r\nh3.
