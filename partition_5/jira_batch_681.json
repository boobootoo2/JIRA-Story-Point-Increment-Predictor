      "description": "I found JRA-44147 which encompasses the general issue that I've been encountering but wanted to add some other info that I have noticed about it as well and raise the priority. Overall the new feature to \"Import Issues from CSV\" under the Issues drop drop down doesn't reliably import all the data from a CSV as the \"External System Import\" does from the System admin section. In addition to certain field being imported inconsistently, such as time estimates in the linked issue, there are many custom fields that will not successfully import using the Issues import method.\r\n\r\nImporting issues from CSV files is a critical and frequent step in our projects workflow and we would like to avoid having to give so many of our team members admin privileges just for the ability to successfully import issues. Any help in resolving this would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nbq. h2.Summary\r\nbq. \r\nbq. {quote}\r\nbq. I imported the attached CSV file (which contains a single issue with a 3hr 30min original estimate) using Issues -> Import Issues from CSV, and the new issue had an original estimate of 3 hours (see screenshot).\r\nbq. \r\nbq. I imported the file using [Administration] -> System -> External System Import and the new issue had the correct original estimate of 3 hours 30 minutes.\r\nbq. \r\nbq. I assumed the behaviour of both CSV importers would be identical.\r\nbq. {quote}\r\nbq. \r\nbq. User's description explains the bug the best. Basically there is a difference between the 2 importer and the value of the time fields are not \r\nbq. \r\nbq. h2.Steps to Replicate\r\nbq. Create a new Agile project. Make sure that the *Time Estimate* field is added to the right screen and project.\r\nbq. Import using Issues -> Import Issues from CSV. Resulting ticket is refered as Ticket A.\r\nbq. Import the file using [Administration] -> System -> External System Import. Resulting ticket is refered as Ticket B.\r\nbq. \r\nbq. h2.Expected Result\r\nbq. The Remaining and Original Estimate field is showing different value. Ticket B is showing correct value while Ticket A is showing wrong value.\r\nbq. \r\nbq. *Using Issue External Import*\r\nbq. \r\nbq. !1.png|thumbnail!\r\nbq. \r\nbq. *Using Administrator External System Import*\r\nbq. \r\nbq. !2.png|thumbnail!\r\nbq. \r\nbq. The correct time estimate value is 3 hours and 30 minutes.\r\nbq. \r\nbq. h2.Current Result\r\nbq. The Remaining and Original Estimate field is showing same value for both Ticket A and B.\r\nbq. \r\nbq. h2.Note\r\nbq. There are no error logs from Jira log during the import for both tickets.

If the image contained \"http\" within its base64 binary representation, JIRA would consider it a link and ignore it.\r\nOf course the chances of \"http\" appearing somewhere in the pasted image would go up when the image size goes up, and so this explains why this rarely occurred with smaller images.\r\n\r\nThank you for reporting this. Please let us know if you encounter more issues.\r\nCheers,\r\nMina\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\nh3.

This leads to being unable to remove watchers unless there is more than 1 watcher on the issue.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n# Install the [JIRA Workflow Toolbox|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.fca.jira.plugins.workflowToolbox.workflow-toolbox/server/overview] add-on.\r\n# Configure it to add watchers no issue transition.\r\n# Add a watcher normally.\r\n# Transition an issue and add a watcher during that transition.\r\n# Attempt to remove both watchers.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nBoth watchers can be removed.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nOnly one can be (the first one). If there's only one left it can't be.\r\n\r\nh3. Notes\r\n\r\nThis is not caused by the plugin as it uses our API - the problem is when the API is called during transition:\r\n\r\n# In {{com.atlassian.jira.issue.watchers.DefaultWatcherManager#adjustWatchCount}} (this is what the API gets into) it creates a cloned issue and updates the watcher count and persists that. This is fine for {{com.atlassian.jira.web.action.issue.VoteOrWatchIssue#doExecute}} because nothing happens after that.\r\n# However in the workflow transition, {{com.atlassian.jira.workflow.OSWorkflowManager#doWorkflowActionInsideTxn}}, it's quite different:\r\n{code:java}\r\n            try {\r\n                wf.doAction(wfid, from.getAction(), inputs);\r\n\r\n                // save the issue updates - the generate change history function stores the issue as well, but if it has been modified by some post functions\r\n                // after that we need to store the issue again.\r\n                issue.store();\r\n\r\n                // commit the TX\r\n                txn.commit();\r\n{code}\r\n# The problem is inside the workflow, we perform the watch update, with the updated issue count on {{jiraissue}}, however then we store the issue again inside the transition method and it overwrites the change.

This means whatever is first in the list shows up as the default selection.  For example, if a transition only includes \"Completed\", \"Abandoned\" and \"Duplicate\", we wind up with \"Duplicate\" as the pre-selected value.  For a system with \"Fixed\" as the system default, \"Completed\" would seem to be a more reasonable default selection.\r\n\r\nThere may be a workaround for some cases, but it would involve re-ordering the global list, which may be inappropriate or unwelcome in some environments.  It seems like, since we can restrict the list at the transition level, we should also be able to set the default at the same level... say, by adding \"jira.field.resolution.default\" as a property, with the expected value being the ID of one resolution.",

This is not consistent with the behavior of the simple Edit operation. When a a field is not part of the EDIT screen - it cannot be modified when the Edit button is clicked - it cannot be modified via the inline edit, but anything can be done via bulk. If a field is not part of the EDIT screen then it's because it's not supposed to be updated via any EDIT operation.\r\nJust to provide more detail: In certain Jira implementations, some fields are supposed to be modified only during particular transitions. These fields are not supposed to be edited via the edit operation. In order to accomplish this we add these fields in the VIEW screen (so anybody can see the content at any time), but we don't add the fields in the EDIT screen (so these fields cannot be update via the edit operation / inline edit). The fields are added only to screens that are displayed during the transitions when the fields are supposed to be modified.\r\nEverything works great but the problem is that if you perform a Bulk change (Edit Issues), everything can be modified, even the fields that were NOT supposed to be editable.\r\nIt would make sense to take into account the EDIT screen for all Edit operations, including Bulk Edit too.",
