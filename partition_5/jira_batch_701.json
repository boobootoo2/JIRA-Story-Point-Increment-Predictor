      "description": "Taken from AAC:\r\n\r\nI am running JIRA server 6.3.7 and trying to test out integration with HipChat.\r\nLooking in the add-on manager, I see that I have version 1.3.4 of the HipChat for JIRA add-on installed. If I search for this add-on in the Marketplace, I see that a significantly newer version is available (6.14.0). However, there is no indication in the JIRA add-on manager that an update is available, even though my version of JIRA supports this version of the HipChat for JIRA add-on.\r\nI'm wondering what the appropriate procedure is for obtaining the latest version. Do I just download the add-on and install in manually? Or is there something I need to do to get the add-on manager to recognize that an update is available?\r\n\r\nThis is what I meant by installing manually - I'm aware that I could use that method. My question was more along the lines of: is there a reason why the UPM is not recognizing that an update to the HipChat add-on is available?\r\n\r\nIs it the intended procedure that I update manually? Or should the UPM see that an update is available?\r\n\r\nhttps://answers.atlassian.com/questions/13411651/how-do-i-get-the-latest-version-of-the-hipchat-for-jira-add-on",

Problem\r\nCurrently with the User Picker field on a custom field, you can Configure the field to be restricted to a certain group. This does seem to be an overall change, so you won't be able to use the field in more than one project with different sets of users.\r\n\r\nh4. Solution\r\nCreate permission schemes per project and allow to choose which scheme to use on each project.\r\n\r\nh4. Example\r\nProject A uses group Users A\r\nProject B users group Users B\r\n\r\nWhen selecting from that field, you only want to be able to select from Users A or B, depending on which project is using the custom field.\r\n\r\nh4.

Summary\r\nWhen we import CSV data into JIRA via System External Import, fields with duplicate names will be somehow mapped to Custom field rather than the System field even if I choose the correct field during the import.\r\n\r\nI suspect there is a bug in the CSV Importer around the name of a custom field when selecting it for import, particularly if there is a standard field by the same name.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Create a custom field named \"Status\". Not a good idea, but that's what was done.\r\n# Create a CSV file for import with Issue ID, reporter, summary, status columns.\r\n# Use the CSV importer to import the CSV file, mapping as expected. Select the standard JIRA field Status for the status column.\r\n# Note that the custom field named Status is selected since it is named as a custom field, not a standard field in the CSV Importer mapping.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nThe System field Status should have been updated.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nThe Custom field Status have been updated.\r\n\r\nh3.Workaround\r\n*Option 1*\r\n# After mapping the fields for the import, the import wizard will give you the option to _Begin import_. \r\n# At this page, click Back button on your web browser.\r\n# Choose again the standard Status field again.\r\n\r\n*Option 2*\r\n# Rename the Custom Field to a different name before the import.\r\n# Perform the CSV import.\r\n# Rename back the Custom field back to the original name.",

It have the functionality to strip and scan the email details to populate the information about the issue. But, there is still a possibilities that the feature to scan the email is missing some information on the email. Also, since JIRA is using different type of renderer for its field, it would not accept any format beside it if there is some text format such as table on the email, making the description could be not rendered properly.\r\n\r\nHence, it would be great if JIRA able to save those original email as an attachment on the created issue so the user could refer to it if there is a problem on the issue creation.",
