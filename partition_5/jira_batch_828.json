[See the corresponding bug report|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-26023].\n  {panel}\n\nHello Guys,\r\n\r\nThese problems have been reproduced on a fresh 4.4 instance.\r\n\r\nUsing the method above, it is not possible to phisically create a default membership (either while using Users or Groups). Executing it on the jelly runner only produces the message that the script ran successfully.\r\n\r\nProblems that we identified:\r\n- the script does not add groups or users to the project roles;\r\n- it does not return any errors if the user, group or ID of the role does not exist;\r\n- trying to add a user which belongs only to the jira-users group to the JIRA Administrators project role does not add it (and checking in the roles in the UI does not show the user entered);\r\n- trying to add a user which belongs only to the jira-users group to the JIRA Users project role does not add the user when browsing via UI, but using the Jelly *GetDefaultRoleActors* returns correctly the user. Restarting the instance does not change this behaviour;\r\n- changing to DEBUG level the logging of *jelly* does not produces any errors in the logs;\r\n\r\nSo, is this jelly supposed to be working like this? Is there any hidden usage to it?\r\n\r\nBest Regards\r\nThiago Prisco\r\nAtlassian Support",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-26022].\n  {panel}\n\nI wanted to share some feedback on JIRA especially as it relates to how we're prioritizing work between the Business and our IS department. I've set up a filter that pulls a view together from multiple projects that each have many tasks.\r\n\r\nAmong those projects we have an overall business priority and it would be awesome if I could edit that business priority directly in the table view provided in the above filter. I'm looking for a process like 1) Click on a cell to edit, 2) Make changes and hit enter to save, and records re-order based on sorting set. \r\n\r\nRight now the process is more like 1) Ctrl+Click a task to open it in a new tab from the filter view, 2) Click the edit link on left, 3) Change business priority, 4) Hit save button, 5) Close new tab, 6) Continue editing the filter view or hit refresh to see changes.\r\n\r\nIt seems like this would be a much easier way to enter data across multiple projects.\r\n\r\nThanks much, -Matt\r\n",

[See the corresponding bug report|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-26017].\n  {panel}\n\nOriginal issue: [JSTDEV-841|https://sdog.jira.com/browse/JSTDEV-841]\r\n\r\nThe _com.atlassian.confluence.plugins.gadgets.GadgetMacro_ (com.atlassian.confluence.plugins.gadgets:gadgets-plugin:4.0) renders an iframe pointing to _org.apache.shindig.gadgets.servlet.GadgetRenderingServlet_ (registered by the _com.atlassian.gadgets:atlassian-gadgets-opensocial-plugin:3.1.9_). The symptom is that the content does not get retrieved since _gadget.showView(true);_ in line 166 _ajs.gadget.factory.js_ (_com.atlassian.gadgets:atlassian-gadgets-publisher-plugin:3.1.9_) does not result in an invocation of the showView method being inherited from the Configured -> Standard constructor from _ajs.gadget.standard.js_ (same plugin) line 172. I do not understand why this is not happening, if I debug into that line showView references the function defined in the standard class, but if I step into it is not executed. The problem has to do with the check before, I just don't see why.\r\n\r\nAfter changing (_ajs.gadget.factory.js_ line 165-167)\r\n{code}\r\nif (gadget.getPrefs().getBool(\"isConfigured\")) {\r\n    gadget.showView(true);\r\n}\r\n{code}\r\nto\r\n{code}\r\nif (true) {\r\n    gadget.showView(true);\r\n}\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nshowView evaluates. Don't get me wrong here, _gadget.getPrefs().getBool(\"isConfigured\")_ evaluated to true before and I was on the _gadget.showView(true);_ line. \r\n\r\nAfter changing this I see a loading bar but no content is displayed. The content retrieval and insertion code from _assigned-to-me-gadget.xml_ (_com.atlassian.jira:jira-gadgets-plugin:4.4.1-studio-rc2_) is executed and the DOM is enriched with the content, but the problem is that the following style from ajs-gadgets.css line 85 (_com.atlassian.jira:jira-gadgets-plugin:4.4.1-studio-rc2_) moving the content out of the canvas (until some sort of \"ready for view\" state is reached I guess) is never removed.\r\n\r\n{code}\r\nbody.loading .gadget, body.config-active.loading .gadget, body.loading #config, body.config-active.loading #config {\r\n    left: -9999px;\r\n    position: absolute;\r\n    width: 100%;\r\n}\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nIf I remove the _left: -9999px;_ instruction I can see the content. This is not a Studio specific issue, I was able to reproduce the behaviour with a vanilla JIRA and Confluence instance of the same versions. All data indicates the problem originating in the jira-gadgets-plugin so far, also I'm unsure about why showView is not executed and if this could be a problem in the atlassian-gadgets-publisher-plugin. I've also tested the Introduction gadget which showed the same symptoms, so this might be an issue with all gadgets provided by the jira-gadgets-plugin.\r\n",

(The reason for this is that the AssignToCurrentUserFunction will only assign to the current user if they are assignable. So by having the AssignToLeadFunction come before it, then issue will fall back to being assigned to the lead if the current user can't be assigned). See !start progress post functions.png|thumbnail!\r\n# log into jira as a user who has assignment and workflow permission but who isn't the lead of the project. For example, in the data set I've attached, log in as *mickey mouse*. Password is mouse.\r\n# Find or create an issue in Open state\r\n# click Start Progress\r\n# click Stop Progress\r\n# click Start Progress again\r\n# now look at the History issue tab. \r\n\r\n+Expected Result+ the change history shouldn't have a change in assignee listed when we went executed Start Progress the second time. \r\n\r\n+Actual Result+ the change history says that the assignee changed from *mickey hart* to *mickey mouse* even though there wasn't a change in assignment for the second time that we clicked Start Progress. You can tell this is off because the previous Start Progress also shows that the issue was last assigned to *mickey mouse*. See !change history off.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\n+Resolution+\r\nWhat we have done to fix this on our system (every time we upgrade) is go into the 3 functions and change the issue.setAssignee() call to instead call this function below. (As the comment in the snippet points out it still doesn't work if invoked from SOAP, but that's fairly rare in our system.)\r\n\r\n{code}\r\n   /**\r\n    * throw away any intermediate assignee switches made by previous calls to issue.setAssignee()\r\n    * during the chain of workflow functions\r\n    * so that the change history reflects a change from start state to end state\r\n    * for the entire set of workflow functions\r\n    * @param transientVars variables passed between a set of workflow functions\r\n    * @param assignTo new assignee\r\n    */\r\n   protected void setAssignee(Map transientVars, User assignTo) {\r\n      final MutableIssue modifiedIssue = getIssue(transientVars);\r\n      User oldAssignee = modifiedIssue.getAssignee();\r\n      final Object issue = transientVars.get(ORIGINAL_ISSUE_KEY);\r\n      // if we're being invoked from SOAP, then there is no WorkflowFunctionUtils.ORIGINAL_ISSUE_KEY in memory.\r\n      // So just use what the previous set was, which defeats the point of this function.\r\n      // But that's better than a NullPointerException.\r\n      // Otherwise, this next if() statement will pick up the original assignee before all the workflow functions ran and avoid false changes in the change history\r\n      if(issue instanceof Issue) {\r\n         oldAssignee = ((Issue)issue).getAssignee();\r\n      }\r\n      modifiedIssue.setAssignee(assignTo);\r\n      modifiedIssue.store();\r\n      modifiedIssue.getModifiedFields().put(IssueFieldConstants.ASSIGNEE, new ModifiedValue(oldAssignee, assignTo));\r\n   }\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nThis is something that we noticed years ago...even before 3.13...but for some reason I just keep hacking it and never bothered to ask y'all to fix it. \r\nIf you could fix this, it would be spectacular.\r\n",

After clicking 'add' the view is returned back to 'edit permission scheme' screen, scroll position being at top of the page (a minor annoyance, it could return to same scroll position as when the 'add' was clicked). Then you need to do the cycle again for adding the permission for project lead, current assignee and once for all the 3 groups.\r\n\r\n\r\nCould it be possible to make an improvement, where you could use checkboxes (instead of radio buttons) in screen 'Permission Schemes' > 'Add New Permission' to be able to select multiple options at once.\r\n Also changing the single select menus (atleast the group menu) into a multi select menus would be helpful.\r\n\r\n(See the attachment)\r\n\r\nI understand there already is a similar request, but I thought I could provide a bit more information by creating a new one.\r\nJRA-1390 << The related issue",

Confluence faces the '&' it expects an entity reference on the sequence, but this is just the name of an option of the custom field.\r\n\r\nThe proposed resolution is to make Confluence able to automatically escape this char from the XML file or improve the error message on both sides.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\nThere currently isn't much to do other than make sure that Jira does not send to Confluence any issues containing the '&' symbol, and this means you will need to:\r\n* *Or* replace the & symbol by what it usually means, the word 'and', which is the preferred workaround\r\n* *Or* add some validation to the Jira Query Language so as *not to* include issues containing the & symbol at all. Jira does not allow searching for issues *not containing* a {{text}}, so the workaround from [this article|https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirakb/jql-queries-search-for-issues-that-do-not-contain-text-1018761257.html] could be used instead by:\r\n## Searching for {{text ~ '&'}} and saving this as a filter named like {{ampersand-symbol}}\r\n## Adding this to the JQL already in place, like this:\r\n{noformat}\r\nAND filter != ampersand-symbol\r\n{noformat}\r\nThis would exclude issues containing the '&' symbol from what Jira sends to Confluence and will fix the issue in Confluence side. The problem with this second approach is that some Jira issues will not be presented in Confluence side.",

This is consistent with the behavior we have seen here (those without the edit issue permission cannot add/edit/remove labels).\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nCasey\r\n",

Ideally, changes could be automatically pushed from active directory to JIRA/Confluence, but I realize that is a huge effort. So, a good alternative would be to have a command-line (or something of the sort) that I could run on our Active Directory server after I am done making changes, that would push an immediate sync request over to JIRA and Confluence.

However, once you create them in the diretories, you cannot change this setting anymore. \r\n\r\nBy implementing this, the users can easily solve almost any problem that might've occured during an upgrade, as well giving them the oportunity to change this setting on runtime, instead of having to do the upgrade again, or via database hacks.\r\n\r\nCheers\r\nThiago Prisco",

Description\r\n\r\nOn the View Issue screen, the Workflow button is disabled unless the maximum number of workflow items has been exceeded.\r\n\r\nHowever, if the maximum is exceeded by one, the Workflow button only has one menu option.\r\n\r\nInstead of showing the Workflow button if there is only one option, just show the extra option.  \r\n\r\nI realize this has a few extra implications:\r\n\r\n* Should the Workflow button just be hidden instead of disabled when it is not in use?\r\n* What should the max actually represent?  Max buttons including the workflow button?\r\n\r\nh3. Example\r\n\r\n*In current scenario*, given transitions of Start, Resolve, Close, Confirm for a given status and a Max workflow buttons of 3, you would get:\r\n\r\n|Start|Resolve|Close|Workflow \\\\ Confirm|\r\n\r\n*In the suggested scenario*, given the transitions of Start, Resolve, Close, Confirm for a given status and a Max workflow buttons of 3 you would get:\r\n\r\n|Start|Resolve|Workflow \\\\ Close \\\\Confirm|\r\n\r\nbut a Max workflow buttons of 4 you would get:\r\n\r\n|Start|Resolve|Close|Confirm|\r\n\r\nh3. The Benefits\r\n\r\nThe benefits would be:\r\n* No wasted space when Workflow button not needed (because it would be hidden)\r\n* No extra click when only one menu item\r\n\r\nh3. Extrapolate\r\n\r\nThis obviously could be applied to Action buttons (though I don't know if I've ever seen the action list small enough to not need the \"More Actions\" button) and any other place this menu concept is used.\r\n",

      "description": "If a workflow step is configured in the Workflow Designer to only have a global transition out, then no transitions appear in the workflow buttons on the issue's screen.\r\n\r\nBug found by adding a global transition (Cancel) to a Cancelled status.  All workflow steps except one (Cancelled) have at least one other normal transition out to another step.  They all show their normal transitions and the global transition.  Cancelled has a transition out to a step called \"Edit (after Cancel)\".  It was assumed that the global Cancel transition would show up so the user can return the Issue to Cancelled.  However, in practice, if the user transitioned to \"Edit (after Cancel)\" then the Issue was stuck there with no workflow step available.\r\n\r\nThis was fixed by noticing that \"Edit (after Cancel)\" was the only step with no normal transition out.  Moreover, even though there was a global transition in place, \"Edit (after Cancel)\" could not have any transitions added in draft, suggesting that Jira was ignoring the global transition when deciding on the rules about how to handle a step with no normal transitions out.  It was fixed by taking a copy of the workflow, then adding a circular transition from \"Edit (after Cancel)\" back to itself and hiding it with a condition.  Then a new workflow scheme was created, and the copy of the workflow added to it, and the scheme applied to the relevant projects.  \r\n\r\nOnce that was done, the global transition Cancel re-appeared as a workflow button on the Issue screen.\r\n\r\n*Replication Step:*\r\n# Copy the default workflow\r\n# Add a new status/step(eg. Test) with an incoming transition(eg. to Test) but no outgoing transition from that step\r\n# Add a global transition to Closed step(eg. to Close)\r\n# Create a workflow scheme(eg. test scheme) and associate to this workflow\r\n# Associate the \"test scheme\" to a project\r\n# Create new issue and transition to Test status.\r\n# There will be no outgoing transition in Test step.\r\n\r\n*Workaround:*\r\nadding a dummy transition with a \"Hide\"condition then allows the global transition to appear.\r\n\r\n",

The only workaround is to make the comment as a wiki comment, or encapsulate the comment (using \\{code} for instance).\r\n\r\nIs there any plans to make the automatic issue liking optional, and switcheable?\r\n\r\nCheers\r\n\r\nThiago Prisco",

Status\n\nOK The problem with this bug is that JIRA is working as intended.\n\nWhen JRA-6344 was implemented, we changed JIRA to *always* send a notification to the old assignee when the assignee changed, regardless of what Issue Event was fired as configured in the applicable Notification Scheme or Workflow.\n\nIn addition, we added this configuration property, {{jira.assignee.change.is.sent.to.both.parties}}, which allowed users who didn't want this new behaviour to have the old behaviour instead by setting the property to {{false}}.\n\nThat (old) behaviour is as follows: If the assignee is changed, then the old assignee will be notified of the change ONLY *in response to an Issue Assigned Event*. When an issue is edited (as opposed to \"assigned\"), and the assignee is changed, then the old assignee will NOT receive the notification. \n\nNote that events that are fired as a result of workflow transitions are customisable, they can be edited in post functions for workflow transitions.\n\nWhile it's perfectly reasonable to expect JIRA to not send a notification with this property set, we are still considering this as it will result in changed behaviour for existing customers who may be relying on it. \n{panel}\n\nThe application properties in this case is _jira.assignee.change.is.sent.to.both.parties_. \n\nUser wanted to disable this properties from sending notification out to previous assignee but the properties doesn't work when they make changes through jira-config.properties.\n\nTo ensure it works, user have modify the default value of the application properties from True to False via jpm.xml, however it is not working.\n\nThe documentation have stated this properties still works in latest JIRA version:[Creating A Notification Scheme|http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Creating+a+Notification+Scheme#CreatingaNotificationScheme-AboutEmailNotifications]\n\np/s: user restart JIRA instance each time after any modification happens in jira-config.properties and jpm.xml. \n\n",

Please remember to backup your instance prior to making any changes to your system.\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\nThere were somehow two issues with the issue key JSP-93880 created on SAC.  The issue key could not be accessed through the web interface, the error was understandably about expecting one value and getting multiples:\r\n\r\n{code}\r\n@400000004e92f2300f44b2f4 2011-10-10 08:24:54,255 http-172.16.3.44-8080-52 ERROR      [500ErrorPage.jsp] Exception caught in 5\r\n00 page Passed List had more than one value.\r\n@400000004e92f2300f44bac4 java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Passed List had more than one value.\r\n@400000004e92f2300f44beac       at org.ofbiz.core.entity.EntityUtil.getOnly(EntityUtil.java:62)\r\n@400000004e92f2300f44beac       at com.atlassian.jira.issue.managers.DefaultIssueManager.getIssue(De\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nOne of the two issues was a duplicate of JSP-93382. I removed the database entry for that issue, which restored access to the issue through the web interface.\r\n\r\nSearching for the deleted issue's description, as in \"convert internal directory to LDAP\" still returns two issues, JSP-93382 and JSP-93380.  The entry in that search for JSP-93380 has the wrong summary, but clicking the link goes to the sole remaining issue.  I suspect a full reindex will be required to make that bogus entry go away.\r\n\r\nTo track this down further, I would propose adding a constraint to disallow duplicate pkey values, as in:\r\n\r\n{code}\r\nalter table jiraissue add constraint pkey_unique unique (pkey);\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nOnce that's in place, a database error will thrown whenever an attempt is made to create a second record with the same pkey.  Looking at previous examples of other problems, I'd expect something like org.postgresql.util.PSQLException in our case.\r\n\r\nThe issues were not created from support requests, nor were they created from mail messages.  I suspect that someone it's possible for two threads to end up with the same new pkey.\r\n\r\nThis is happening about once a week at this point, so it's not an isolated incident.  I don't see anything telling in the logs immediately before the original error, any ideas about tracking this down would be appreciated.",
