They are jsut able to open tickets via email, receive email notifications and comment via email.\r\n\r\nAs we are also using JIRA as an IT Helpdesk / Ticketing system, we'd like our standard users to receive an email notification when their ticket is created in JIRA. I tried to add the Issue Created - Reporter notification in the notification scheme.\r\n\r\nProblem is, users don't receive their \"own\" notification as I presume the \"Do not notify my changes\" option in their profile is set by default.\r\n\r\nHow could we tackle this problem?\r\nI saw we could change this default setting but it will change it for ALL users, including \"active\" JIRA users that will also receive all those notifications as well as when they comment issues, or change other fields. This will lead to way too many emails.\r\n\r\nDo you know a way to set this email notification only for the issue creation to the reporter with the ability to notify the reporter of his own issue?\r\n\r\nThanks for your help and understanding,\r\nOlivier",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-33805].\n  {panel}\n\n* We need to be able to allow our customers to email support requests into our Jira install.\n* We cannot create users automatically when someone not already set up in Jira emails a support request in. I understand that in that case, we have to set up a dummy account, and set the \"reporterusername\" to that dummy account, so that the dummy account can create the ticket on behalf of the customer who mailed in the support request.\n\nNow, here is our problem. In this scenario, the customer, the person who sent in the email requesting support, never gets a confirmation email from the system that their request was received. They never get automatic emails from Jira informing them of comments or progress to their request, and they never get an automatic email from Jira telling them when their request is completed or closed.\n\nI see that the original customer's email address is appended to the issue description field, and that our customer support personel can copy that address and manually create email updates to keep the customer informed, but for us, that creates additional workflow issues and potential for omissions that are not acceptable to us. Is there any way to have Jira email the customer who sent in the ticket automatically when the ticket is created, updated and closed, given our environment?",

Indeed, executing the search specified in:\r\n\r\n{code} issuekey in (DS-1984, DS-1985) {code}\r\n\r\n... results in the page invoked through {{https://.../jira/issues/?filter=-2&jql=issuekey%20in%20(DS-1984%2C%20DS-1985)}}\r\n\r\nA common use case where this is limiting is when specifying an itemized set of issues using the {{issuekey in ()}} construct, very convenient when the list of issues is coming from an external source (external tool, spreadsheet, etc.). With four character project keys and four digit numbers, this amounts to about 200 issues, which is not unreasonable.\r\n\r\nThe syntax worked for much longer strings in Jira 5.0.1, presumably when the context of the query was passed using the POST method (we never had the need to closely inspect how it worked). \r\n\r\nCurrently, it is impossible to launch the Issue Navigator using the {{issuekey in ()}} syntax with more than 200 issue keys even from an external tool and using the POST method, as the Issue Navigator's UI  just shuts it off. This is rendering a number of established tools and processes inoperable.\r\n\r\nAlternative ways of describing the selection, e.g. using filters, is not a viable option because the set of issues is generally composed by methods external to Jira and thus the only straightforward way is to use an explicit listing.",

Then JIRA starts normally. That problem wasnt existed on previous version. I have checked many things, and tried to isolate the problem, and I think it is related to web.xml file or web.config file.\r\nCan you please help me?\r\nThank you!",
