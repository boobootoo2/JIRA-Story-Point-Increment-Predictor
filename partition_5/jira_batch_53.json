If you have a line selected and click in the diff it will cause there to be a double-selection. For instance, if you have line 1 selected and click to select line 6, the scroll will jump down and now lines 6 and 11 will be selected.\r\n\r\nAfter this jump has happened, you can click anywhere in the diff and it behaves as expected until you scroll to the top again, at which point the odd behavior is again present.",
