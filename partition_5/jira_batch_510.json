This would be the same value displayed for all users and include the timezone, date & time.

However without more information about your use case / setup, we cannot be sure 100%.\r\n\r\nOur recommendation is to either\r\n # share how you have configured the automation rules with SLA values (ideal solution if this is appropriate for you)\r\n # alternatively share how you are using the rules conceptually (if you cannot share the actual JQL/user generated content)\r\n # or contact Support or Christophe Capel (reporter on this ticket) with more information\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nThe Jira Service Desk team\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nP-S: To prevent SPAM, attachments have been turned off on this instance, so if you want to include attachments, please include links to Dropbox, etc. instead.

      "description": "h3. Problem Statement\r\n\r\nCurrently, if the portal has many KB categories, the categories list is very long and the option to\u00a0*raise a request*\u00a0goes off the page so customers can't see that without scrolling. This causes confusion to the customer and is not visually user friendly.\u00a0\r\n * One cause of this is having a lot of whitespace between of the categories.\u00a0\r\n * Secondly, the categories are listed in a single long row.\u00a0 This is not making good use of the available space on the portal.\u00a0\r\n\r\nh3. Proposed Solution\r\n\r\nImprove the appearance of the KB categories by,\r\n # Reducing the whitespace of the categories so the can be listed more compactly and reduce space on screen.\r\n # Allow the use of columns instead of a sinle row so that the category list is shortened.\u00a0",
