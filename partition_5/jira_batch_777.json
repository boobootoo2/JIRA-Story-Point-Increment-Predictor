Confluence).\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nAs there's no plan for activity stream being configurable in other parts of JIRA as specified [here|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRA-28739?focusedCommentId=447818&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-447818],  add an option in General Configuration for administrator to configure the default timeout for activity stream to be user specified, so it could be longer than 10 seconds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

As a Support Engineer, it makes it harder to review logs - whilst I'd prefer to go through {{catalina.out}}, specific log levels are output to {{atlassian-jira.log}} and it's a requirement to read it sometimes.\r\n\r\nh3. Environment\r\n\r\n* Mac OS X\r\n* PostgreSQL 9.1\r\n* 5.2.8\r\n* Presented on pretty much every single customer environment I've anecdotally seen.

This offers per-user visibility granularity rather than per-system (group) or per-project (role).\r\n* Roles that contain subsets of users could be merged with other roles to ensure visibility to appropriate people.  For example if we have people that are in a Tester role and issues show up on Tester dashboards for testing, then  we would make a security level that has both Tester and Manager.  Right now if they select the Tester role then managers are excluded.  Managers aren't part of the testing workflow so they shouldn't have testing issues showing up on their dashboard for example.\r\n* Ability to set default comment visibility.\r\n* Ability to restrict set of comment visibility overrides.  It doesn't just show up as some arbitrary list of groups that happen to exist in the system.\r\n\r\nComments are the most significant subdivisions of issues and not being able to control visibility properly is a recurring problem for us.",

I have 4 Permissions Schemes (15 Projects each). When I create a new project I assign a permission scheme to it. But for Confluence Space I need to do it separately (add corresponding 3-4 groups, check ~40 check-boxes). \nAnother example:\nIf I decide to add some group to Permission scheme then I need to go and modify permissions at all Confluence Spaces - which is headache.\n\nThanks.",

So I can't use a single list of Default Members for project Roles.\nFrom other side I can use different project roles for each project like Type1Developer, Type1QA, etc but it is not good as well.\n\nAnother idea is to have project role schemes (with default members), which can be assigned per project.",

With Greenhopper nested versions, this has a bad side-effect. When 'Current' is moved from a sub-version of 2.0 to 2.1, for example, all of the issues fixed in 'Current' move with it, which messes up the ability to see what was actually fixed in 2.0.\n\nInstead of relying on each developer to remember to remove 'Current' from the fix version, it would be nice if this could be enforced by the workflow, either with a post function that automatically removes it or a validator that won't let you resolve until you do.\n\nThis seems like it could be generally useful if we allow the list of disallowed fix versions to be configurable.",
