In a multi-programmer environment, whenever I pull the project, the submodules are in danger of being switched to HEAD, rather than staying on the branch I want them to be on. This is okay. But the mistake I keep making, because it is far too easy to make in SourceTree, is to make a change in sub module code and then commit, without noticing that the sub module is on HEAD, not the branch I thought it was on. The feature request I am making is to add a preference to SourceTree that will allow me to tell SourceTree to warn me if I am about to commit to HEAD. After all there is a warning popup for when leaving HEAD, so why not a warning popup for committing to HEAD? Can you think of a good reason why you might want to commit to a HEAD and create a detached branch in the process? I can't! There is no end of people asking how to undo a commit to head on the internet, so obviously I am not the only person falling into this hole. Thank you!  ",
