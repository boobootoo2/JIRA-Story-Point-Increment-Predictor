      "description": "This was discovered by having JIM-RC1 in bundled-plugins.zip and then installing JIM-final (via UPM or whatever). When you restart JIRA you get a message that looks like\r\n\r\n{code}\r\nIgnoring the Spring context that was just created for plugin X. The plugin is in an invalid state, DISABLED, that doesn't support a transition to enabled.  Most likely, it was disabled due to a timeout.\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nThe problem here is that we have a bundled-plugin that is marked a RequiresRestart. During OsgiPlugin.disableInternal we have\r\n\r\n{code}\r\n            // Only disable underlying bundle if this is a truly dynamic plugin\r\n            if (!PluginUtils.doesPluginRequireRestart(this))\r\n            {\r\n                if (getPluginState() == PluginState.ENABLING)\r\n                {\r\n                    logAndClearOustandingDependencies();\r\n                }\r\n                helper.onDisable();\r\n                pluginEventManager.unregister(this);\r\n                getBundle().stop();\r\n                treatSpringBeanFactoryCreationAsRefresh = false;\r\n            }\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nSo this code isn't going to run. What we need to do is do *most* of this but not *all*. For instance, we want to leave the bundle running. So maybe something like:\r\n\r\n{code}\r\n            else\r\n            {\r\n                if (getPluginState() == PluginState.ENABLING)\r\n                {\r\n                    logAndClearOustandingDependencies();\r\n                }\r\n                helper.onDisable();\r\n                pluginEventManager.unregister(this);\r\n                //getBundle().stop();\r\n                treatSpringBeanFactoryCreationAsRefresh = false;\r\n            }\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nHowever, we'll require manual testing in JIRA for things like workflow plugins to make sure that doesn't result in lots of exceptions all over the place.",

While it appears that the plug-in will do the job of providing a dynamic interface between the two systems, we can't find a way in Jira of being able to query issues using the SVN Commits details and hence add them to a filter/provide extracts/etc. It doesn't appear as though you can even do this with JQL?\r\n\r\nWithout this facility it somewhat limits the benefits of having what looks like a very useful tool as we can't do anything with the information that it provides.

A given filter may only take a few seconds to update, but with so many filters the page overall can take 6-8 minutes to refresh.  \r\n\r\nIf the user is trying to work just a few filters, for example to share with other users, then they still have to take the performance hit for the whole list, despite only being focused on a few filters.\r\n\r\nWe would like to request that the Manage Filters page be paginated, and show only a few filters (or a configurable bound) per page.  Or allow a user to configure which sub-set of filters is actively visible.  \r\n\r\nNote that the key feature is that the page needs to show the filter and the number of matches for the filter.  We did try and use:\r\n\r\nhttps://studio.plugins.atlassian.com/wiki/display/JOUT/Filter+List+Plugin\r\n\r\nBut it does not meet this key requirement, and its buggy/difficult to use :( \r\n\r\nHowever if pagination can be added to the Manage Filters page, it should resolve the resolve the performance issue in a reasonable way.\r\n\r\n",

How to know that the user has to change into the summary tab or into the advanced searching mode to do so.\r\n\r\nIt would be perfect (and I guess it would be very easy) also to put the filter operation sections to the \"simple\" searching mode (as it exists in the summary tab and in the advanced searching mode).\r\n",
