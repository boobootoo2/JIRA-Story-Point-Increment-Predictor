Notes\r\n\r\nThis is due to the timing of startup - the health check implements its own heartbeat that is used to propagate cache data across nodes. This heart beat scheduled is started after the plugin has started and the plugin framework is available. We also have a health check scheduler is scheduled to execute a minute after startup. Due to the timing of the various starts it's possible the health check scheduler is executed before the heartbeat has propagated the cache. Due to this the check will initially fail.",

For example, implementing a Business Epic \u2018A\u2019 requires the implementation of features \u2018X\u2019, \u2018Y\u2019 and \u2018Z\u2019. Implementation of feature \u2018X\u2019 requires work in JIRA project \u2018P1\u2019, \u2018P2\u2019 and \u2018P3\u2019, for feature \u2018Y\u2019 it requires work in project \u2018P2\u2019, \u2018P4\u2019, etcetera. So \u2018A\u2019 must be cloned to \u2018X\u2019, \u2018Y\u2019 and \u2018Z\u2019 and from there issues need to be cloned to \u2018P1\u2019, \u2018P2\u2019, etc. All hierarchy relationships require an \u2018implement\u2019 link between the parent and the child.\r\n\u201cClone & move\u201d is used to create the issues, but for each newly created issues the \u201cLink\u201d function must be used to create the parent-child relationship with the \u2018implement\u2019 link.\r\nSince it typically involves a large number of new issues, it is a lot of work switching between \u201cClone & Move\u201d and the \u201cLink\u201d function, and it is easy to make a mistake (e.g. linking the wrong issue ids, or omitting the \u2018implement\u2019 link). By including the linking in the clone function, JIRA knows exactly which issues are concerned (i.e. the original and the clone) reducing the amount of work and reducing the amount of mistakes, and the user is more likely (to not forget) to create the link.\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. *Why this is important*\r\n# The hierarchical structure has an immediate impact on the development planning, and therefore mistakes have too (e.g. missing \u2018implement\u2019 links). Similarly the mistakes have impact on the progress control of business epics.\r\n# The hierarchical structure will be used for aggregating time writing (from JIRA to Clarity) and time writing is used to account financial of projects (Clarity). Mistakes in the hierarchy will have impact on the financial accounting to projects.",

Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nThe new process needs to be detailed in the import documentation directly.\r\n\r\nSince of the Depreciation of the WebDav the new process has been added in the Cloud instance directly on the *Second Step* of the *JIRA Import Wizard* So the only way to notified of the new process is to initiate the process before reading the documentation pages as you must start the import to reveal these details:\r\n{quote}\r\nh2.Before you begin\r\n# Back up your JIRA Cloud site data using Backup Manager\r\n # Prepare an export of your other JIRA Cloud or Server instance.\r\n # If you want to include attachments, avatars, or logos in this import, create compressed copies of the following:\r\n * <JIRA_HOME>/data/attachments directory (with attachments as the top-level directory, or project keys within attachments as the top-level directory).\r\n * <JIRA_HOME>/data/avatars directory (with avatars as the top-level directory)\r\n * <JIRA_HOME>/logos directory (with logos as the top-level directory)\r\n{quote}\r\n!Screen Shot 2017-02-06 at 4.41.01 PM.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nBetween step 2 and 3 the JIRA Import File only file is uploaded from local file system to the webdav, and there is still no indication of were in the process attachments, avatars, or logos files are to be uploaded. Step 3 Notes:\r\n{quote}\r\nBefore the import is started, the JIRA export and optional archives must be uploaded to your Atlassian Cloud instance using WebDAV. For instructions on connecting to your WebDAV directory, [see this documentation | http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/Cloud/Uploading+Data+via+WebDAV]. The import data must be at the root-level of your WebDAV directory and not within a sub-folder.\r\n{quote}\r\n*Also Redirecting to the first document:* [Import and export data | https://confluence.atlassian.com/cloud/import-and-export-data-744721621.html] with no indication of how or when to do this.\r\n!Screen Shot 2017-02-06 at 4.48.33 PM.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nNext step Initiates the Restore\r\n\r\nOnce Restore is successful to upload the Attachments/Avatars/logos  you have to Do the process again but this time upload the zip of the attachments rather than the jira backup,  once complete repeat for each subsequent ZIP file so in total you will need to repeat the full migration process four time to transfer all data once for each:\r\n- jira-backup.zip\r\n- attachments.zip\r\n- avatars.zip\r\n- logos.zip\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Summary\r\nFrom [JRA-33471|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRA-33471], it is understandable that when External User Management option is turned ON, admins can still create new user/group. However, the [documentation|https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiraserver072/configuring-jira-application-options-828788218.html] still writes the following\r\n{quote}When turned ON, you will no longer be able to create, edit or delete users/groups from within JIRA (or via email or import); but you can still assign users/groups to project roles, and create/edit/delete user properties. Additionally, JIRA will not display options for users to change their password, or edit their profile.Generally you would only turn this ON if you are managing all your users from outside JIRA (e.g. using Crowd, Microsoft Active Directory, or another LDAP directory) Default: OFF {quote}\r\n\r\nThis still says that admins won't be able to create users/groups when turned ON\r\n\r\nh3.

Problem Definition\r\nCurrently you only have the options to use Monday or Sunday as your week start day depending on if ISO8601 standard is being used in look and feel. Some JIRA users will want to set a different day other than Sunday or Monday\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\nProvide a way for users to select their own start day\r\n\r\nh3. Why this is important\r\nFor unique situations where a company may start their week on a different day of the week.\r\n\r\n(i) Many customers are able to change the first day of the week by *changing the system locale*. This might cause issues if they are running on an Oracle database. The problem here is that, Oracle JDBC Driver automatically detects the\u00a0system locale, and then uses the locale information to set the NLS_SORT parameter when a database session (connection) is made between JIRA and Oracle.\r\n\r\nIn most cases, Jira detects the database session which is established, as an UNSUPPORTED session collation. This will definitely cause further issues in the future, should they run into any database related problems. Please see [Health Check: The session collation is unsupported by JIRA in Oracle Database|https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirakb/health-check-the-session-collation-is-unsupported-by-jira-in-oracle-database-828788420.html].",

However, it is not helpful when trying to find out project-based permissions:\r\n\r\n# What projects do I have Administer Projects permission on and what grants me that access (e.g. role X/group Z)?\r\n# What projects does user X have Administer Projects permission on and what grants them that access (e.g. role X/group Z)?\r\n# What projects is user X a project lead in so that we can replace them if needed?\r\n\r\nYou may be able to use:\r\n\r\n1)  The following [advanced JQL functions|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRACORESERVER072/Advanced+searching+-+functions+reference] which let you search based on roles or permissions, but the output is issue based and not easily represents the projects you have access to. \r\n\r\n{code:borderStyle=solid}project in projectsWhereUserHasPermission(\"Administer Projects\") or project in projectsWhereUserHasRole(\"Administrators\") ORDER BY project{code}\r\n\r\n2) The [getPermissions|https://docs.atlassian.com/jira/REST/7.2.3/#api/2/-getPermissions] REST call, but you would need to script it out to feed it all projects and clean the data somehow.\r\n\r\n3) SQL queries to capture the projects you have admin permissions in.\r\n\r\nThere is no user-friendly method to get this from JIRA even though this information is critical to manage an enterprise-sized instance.\r\n\r\nh3.

In addition, the Issue Types menu is not alphabetized (documented in JRA-61108).

This works fine for me.\r\n\r\nSo since I quite rarely use sprints - allthough I know exactly what it is, it doesn't really fit my requirements - I have to transition quite often Issues to \"Start Progress\", \"Stop Progress\" or \"Resolve\"... This is possible, but only thourgh the \"...\" Menu -> More Actions, where I can find the transitions....\r\n\r\nI would be nice to integrate these transitions steps directly in the popup menu when clicking on \"...\" Menu button.I can already Edit, Assign, Log Work, Attach Files and more.... But simple transition is some more clicks away....\r\n\r\nI know.... I could/or should use sprints, since Backlogs are not really there for transition... But it really depends... At least for me, this would support me in my manner of work.",

Issues and Last issue update will show you the number of issues in a project, and the date of the last update on an issue \u2014 just to give you an idea of what\u2019s going on with the projects in your Jira.\r\n\r\n!projects_columns2.png|width=100%!\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n Jakub Kurcek\r\n Senior Product Manager, Jira\u00a0Server\r\n{panel}\r\nh3. Problem Definition:\r\n\r\nFor\u00a0long established JIRA Servers, over time many projects may no longer be necessary. Knowing when they were created, who owned them, when they were last updated, number of issues, etc. would be a good addition to regular JIRA Server Administration so that unnecessary or old Projects can be pruned on a regular basis.\r\nh3. Suggested Solution:\r\n\r\nThere should be a tool for native project analysis/archival/mgmt workflow that allows administrators to\u00a0View\u00a0_all_\u00a0project characteristics, such as: project create date, last updated date, total # of issues, project owners/admins in the Administration are of the product.\r\nh3. Why this is needed:\r\n\r\nReducing the size of a large JIRA Server is good for performance, and makes the server easier to manage.",

We highly value your feedback in all forms, and through suggestions in jira.atlassian.com is not different. We use this channel often to learn the best we can with how customers use JIRA and how we can continue to improve the experience for as many users as possible.\r\n\r\nWe have revisited this issue again recently and will state that there are no plans to currently implement this suggestion. There are already a number of existing add-ons in the [marketplace|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/] that handle this use-case, and I recommend utilising them for your instance to add types or attributes the work in Log Work.\r\n\r\nPlease remember that jira.atlassian.com is one of many inputs for the JIRA roadmap. You can [learn more about our process here|https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/110373/how-does-the-jira-team-use-jira-atlassian-com].\r\n\r\nI understand that our decision may be disappointing. Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.\r\n\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nKerrod Williams\r\nKerrod (dot) Williams (at) atlassian (dot) com\r\nProduct Manager, JIRA\r\n\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\n///\r\n\r\nFor each task we need a little IMPLEMENTATION, ANALAYSIS, PROJECT MANAGMENT, TESTING, DOCUMENTATION...I wouldn't like to split one task into several tasks just to know how much time was spent on different types of work.\r\n\r\nIt would be great if user could specify what type of work was he doing in Log Work.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Problem Definition\r\n\r\nJIRA has experimental REST API operations to change and fetch issue properties:\r\n{code}/rest/api/2/issue/{issueIdOrKey}/properties/{propertyKey}{code}\r\n\r\nThis is available in [JIRA REST API documentation|https://docs.atlassian.com/jira/REST/cloud/#api/2/issue/\\{issueIdOrKey\\}/properties].\r\n\r\nThe 'set property' operation (a PUT operation) seems to require a request payload to actually set the property. Something like the response from the 'get property' operation:\r\n{code}\r\n{\r\n    \"key\": \"issue.support\",\r\n    \"value\": {\r\n        \"hipchat.room.id\": \"support-123\",\r\n        \"support.time\": \"1m\"\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nHowever, this is not described in the documentation and may be confusing.\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nLike in the [create issue|https://docs.atlassian.com/jira/REST/cloud/#api/2/issue-createIssue] documentation, add a 'request example' to 'set property'. The data above may be used.",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-63933].\r\n  {panel}\r\n\r\n*This was only checked for cloud environment yet.*\r\n\r\nAs stated in the documentation for REST API Cookie-based authentication [https://developer.atlassian.com/display/jiracloud/JIRA+REST+API+-+Cookie-based+Authentication]. You need to send a POST Call for {{rest/auth/1/session}} and\r\nIt should return the \"Name\" and \"Value\" for Tokens, like the response below. \r\n\r\n{code}\r\n{\r\n    \"session\":\r\n        {\r\n            \"name\":\"JSESSIONID\",\r\n            \"value\":\"6E3487971234567896704A9EB4AE501F\"\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nHowever while testing this in a Cloud Environment Instance. It is not returning the value for token, but only the name. The value is not coming in the response body, but in the header instead. So for other REST methods that not curl it may be hard to retrieve the token value.\r\n\r\n{code}\r\ncurl -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d \"{\\\"username\\\": \\\"sysadmin\\\", \\\"password\\\": \\\"ZZZSOMEPASSWORDZZ\\\"}\" -X POST https://instance.atlassian.net/rest/auth/1/session\r\n\r\n{\"session\":{\"name\":\"studio.crowd.tokenkey\"},\"loginInfo\":{\"failedLoginCount\":14,\"loginCount\":17558,\"lastFailedLoginTime\":\"2014-10-02T22:37:25.749-0300\",\"previousLoginTime\":\"2017-01-31T11:30:06.795-0200\"}}\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nEither documentation should be warned that does not work for cloud, or there should be provided another way to retrieve the value for token in the response body.\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nWhen calling the session endpoint just store all the cookie information in a file and use that to authenticate. E.g.:\r\n# Store the cookie in a cookie jar: {noformat}\r\ncurl -c cookie.txt -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d '{\"username\":\"XXXXXXXXX\", \"password\":\"XXXXXXXXX\" }' -X POST https://INSTANCE/rest/auth/1/session\r\n\r\nOR\r\n\r\ncurl --cookie-jar cookie.txt -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d '{\"username\":\"XXXXXXXXX\", \"password\":\"XXXXXXXXX\" }' -X POST https://INSTANCE/rest/auth/1/session \r\n{noformat}\r\n# Use that to authenticate the successive REST calls: {noformat}\r\ncurl -b cookie.txt --header \"X-Atlassian-Token: no-check\" -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -X GET https://INSTANCE/rest/........\r\n\r\nOR\r\n\r\ncurl --cookie cookie.txt --header \"X-Atlassian-Token: no-check\" -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -X GET https://INSTANCE/rest/........ \r\n{noformat}",
