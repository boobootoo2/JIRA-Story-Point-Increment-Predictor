      "description": "On JAC there has been cases where some requests that perform JQL queries (e.g. https://jira.atlassian.com/issues/?jql=) take a long time (30+ seconds).\r\n\r\nThis seems to be due to UserSearcherHelperImpl.getSuggestedUsers() performing a count of billable users unnecessarily.  It should be possible to replace this billable users count code with a limited UserSearchService query which would make it more efficient.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFrom the comment of the HOT ticket:\r\n\r\nIt seems for some users the number of billable users is being retrieved which is expensive.  The stack dump shows this call running:\r\n\r\n{noformat}\r\n        ...\r\n        at com.atlassian.jira.application.DefaultApplicationRoleManager.totalBillableUsers(DefaultApplicationRoleManager.java:554)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.jira.issue.search.searchers.util.UserSearcherHelperImpl.getSuggestedUsers(UserSearcherHelperImpl.java:134)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.jira.issue.search.searchers.util.UserSearcherHelperImpl.addUserGroupSuggestionParams(UserSearcherHelperImpl.java:77)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.jira.issue.search.searchers.util.UserSearcherHelperImpl.addUserGroupSuggestionParams(UserSearcherHelperImpl.java:69)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.jira.issue.search.searchers.renderer.AbstractUserSearchRenderer.addUserGroupSuggestionParams(AbstractUserSearchRenderer.java:225)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.jira.issue.search.searchers.renderer.AbstractUserSearchRenderer.getKickassVelocityParams(AbstractUserSearchRenderer.java:190)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.jira.issue.search.searchers.renderer.AbstractUserSearchRenderer.getVelocityParams(AbstractUserSearchRenderer.java:169)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.jira.issue.search.searchers.renderer.AbstractUserSearchRenderer.getEditHtml(AbstractUserSearchRenderer.java:88)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.jira.components.query.DefaultSearcherService.getEditHtml(DefaultSearcherService.java:412)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.jira.components.query.DefaultSearcherService.getValueResults(DefaultSearcherService.java:230)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.jira.components.query.DefaultSearcherService.getSearchResults(DefaultSearcherService.java:165)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.jira.components.query.DefaultSearcherService.searchWithJql(DefaultSearcherService.java:160)\r\n        ...\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nNormally the total billable users value is cached, but on JAC there seems to be a high turnaround of users - whenever a user is added or removed this cached count is blown away and the next request has to refresh the count.  This count probably would take 20-30 seconds on a reasonably loaded system like JAC with 400k+ users.\r\n\r\nThe code that calls it is from UserSearcherHelperImpl.getSuggestedUsers():\r\n\r\n{code}\r\n...\r\n            // JRADEV-15375 With a significant number of users in the system, a full sort is very slow and pointless to\r\n            // suggest random users anyway. On the other hand, we do like putting_something_in here for evaluators...\r\n            if (suggestedUsers.size() < limit && licenseCountService.totalBillableUsers() <= 10) {\r\n                // Suggest the first 'limit' users in the system (if they don't already appear).\r\n                List<ApplicationUser> allUsers = userSearchService.findUsers(\"\", searchParams);\r\n...\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nReally this code only needs to know if there is more than 10 users in the system or not, there are less expensive ways to work this out - using UserSearchService.findUsers() with a limit of 10 (UserSearchParams.maxResults) would be much more efficient as the limit is passed through to the database and can be performed nearly instantly.\r\n\r\nSomething [similar to this fix in project templates plugin|https://stash.atlassian.com/projects/JIRA/repos/jira-project-templates-plugin/browse/project-templates-plugin/src/main/java/com/atlassian/jira/projecttemplates/rest/ProjectTemplatesResource.java?at=ddaacde096eaa7371568f906e7b48842d390ac09#82] but with a [limit|https://stash.atlassian.com/projects/JIRA/repos/jira-project-templates-plugin/browse/project-templates-plugin/src/main/java/com/atlassian/jira/projecttemplates/rest/ProjectTemplatesResource.java?at=ddaacde096eaa7371568f906e7b48842d390ac09#76] of 10 instead of 2. \r\n",

For example, if I type \"@john\", I shouldn't have to search through all the Johns in Yahoo if I intend to reply to one who already commented on the same issue.\r\n- When typing an epic name (e.g. when adding an epic to an issue), autocomplete should prioritize epics associated with the board I'm using.

Summary\r\nPermission schemes that have non-existent users explicitly added to a permission type cannot be edited (the header and sidebar load, but where the permissions should be listed is blank).\r\n\r\nThere's two situations where this can occur:\r\n\r\n1) A user exists in a user directory, is granted explicit permission in a permission scheme, and the user directory that the user is in is subsequently disabled.\r\n\r\n2) Back in the days of JIRA Studio and Enterprise Hosted instances, there were two special users with the usernames \"enterprise-hosted-support\" or \"contegix\" (or both) that were the equivalent of the current \"sysadmin\" user. There's several places in JIRA's codebase that check for this username and exclude it from various operations.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to reproduce\r\n# Start a local JIRA, connect it to an external user directory of some sort.\r\n# Add a user that exists only in that directory (and not the internal JIRA directory) to a permission scheme.\r\n# Import that JIRA data into a Cloud instance.\r\n# Try to edit the permission scheme.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected results\r\nThe permission scheme page loads.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual results\r\nWhere the permissions _should_ be is blank, and this stack trace is thrown in the logs:\r\n\r\n{code:none}\r\n2016-02-03 14:23:31,764 http-nio-2990-exec-53 ERROR sysadmin 863x4563x1 15k3ark 103.233.242.8,104.192.140.242,127.0.0.1 /rest/internal/2/managedpermissionscheme/0 [c.a.p.r.c.error.jersey.ThrowableExceptionMapper] Uncaught exception thrown by REST service: null\r\njava.lang.NullPointerException\r\n\tat com.atlassian.jira.permission.DefaultPermissionSchemeService.updateSchemeToReturnUsername(DefaultPermissionSchemeService.java:436)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.jira.permission.DefaultPermissionSchemeService.access$2200(DefaultPermissionSchemeService.java:58)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.jira.permission.DefaultPermissionSchemeService$13.apply(DefaultPermissionSchemeService.java:331)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.jira.permission.DefaultPermissionSchemeService$13.apply(DefaultPermissionSchemeService.java:327)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.fugue.Option$Some.fold(Option.java:421)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.fugue.Option.flatMap(Option.java:287)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.jira.permission.DefaultPermissionSchemeService.getScheme(DefaultPermissionSchemeService.java:327)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.jira.permission.DefaultPermissionSchemeService.getPermissionScheme(DefaultPermissionSchemeService.java:105)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.jira.permission.management.ManagedPermissionSchemeHelperImpl.getManagedPermissionScheme(ManagedPermissionSchemeHelperImpl.java:92)\r\n\t... 3 filtered\r\n\tat java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Method.java:497)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.plugin.util.ContextClassLoaderSettingInvocationHandler.invoke(ContextClassLoaderSettingInvocationHandler.java:26)\r\n\tat com.sun.proxy.$Proxy131.getManagedPermissionScheme(Unknown Source)\r\n\t... 3 filtered\r\n\tat java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Method.java:497)\r\n[...]\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nh3.

Notes\r\n\r\nThe XML backup and restore functionality will still continue to work.\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nIf needing to project import, the database can be edited with the below steps. These were verified on PostgreSQL and the syntax may vary for different DBMS.\r\n\r\n 1. Backup JIRA.\r\n 2. Stop JIRA.\r\n 3. Run these queries to identify the rows you need to update:\r\n{code:sql}\r\nSELECT * FROM changeitem WHERE oldvalue LIKE '[%]' OR newvalue LIKE '[%]';{code}\r\n4. Execute the below SQL to remove the brackets:\r\n{code:sql}\r\nUPDATE changeitem SET oldvalue = TRIM(BOTH '[]' FROM oldvalue), newvalue = TRIM(BOTH '[]' FROM newvalue) WHERE field = '<affected field name>';{code}\r\n5. In some cases, this may cause empty values to be present. We can identify these cases with the following query:\r\n{code:sql}\r\nSELECT * FROM changeitem WHERE oldvalue = '' OR newvalue = '';{code}\r\n6. We can fix these with the below (run the first query if {{oldvalue}} is the field that's blank, and the second query if it's {{newvalue}} that's blank):\r\n{code:sql}\r\nUPDATE changeitem SET oldvalue = NULL WHERE oldvalue = '' AND field = <affected field name>;\r\nUPDATE changeitem SET newvalue = NULL WHERE newvalue = '' AND field = <affected field name>;{code}\r\n7. Start JIRA.\r\n 8. Generate an XML backup and use that for importing into the target instance.\r\n\r\nKB article related to this: https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirakb/version-picker-multiple-versions-incorrectly-persists-data-in-jira-change-history-875322422.html",

Problem Definition\r\n\r\nThe \"Description\" for a custom field is not displayed on the View Issue screen. It is only displayed on the Edit and Create issue screens.\u00a0\r\nh3. Why this is important\r\n\r\nWhen we do create new custom fields we try to give them generic names which are not project specific and can be \u2018re-used\u2019 by other projects. A custom description is then used at a project level to make the field more meaningful on the screen. However there is a limit as to how generic a field name can be before it becomes meaningless. In the situation we currently have we need 4 fields each of which can have a yes / no response. The information being captured for this project is specific to one project only so if the \u2018full\u2019 field name is used it is unlikely it will ever be re-used by a subsequent project. However if we just called the new fields very generic names (eg \u2018Check Box 1\u2019) and had a custom context field description the field could be re-used. The problem comes when the issue is \u2018viewed\u2019 rather than created / edited. In create or edit the field descriptions are displayed but in \u2018view\u2019 just the field name is shown. This means that if we had 4 new \u2018check box\u2019 fields it would not be clear to someone when \u2018viewing\u2019 the issue as to which field was which and what it related to.\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nIt should show custom field description when 'viewing' the issue.\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n * Click Create/Edit issue to see the field description",
