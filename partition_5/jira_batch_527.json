Summary\r\n\r\nThe Documentation for the [/rest/servicedeskapi/request/\\{issueIdOrKey}/attachment|https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/service-desk/rest/#api-request-issueIdOrKey-attachment-post] is incomplete and misleading. Indeed:\r\n # It is not immediate to understand that 2 different REST Calls are needed to attach a file to a JIRA Service Desk issue (one to attach the file to the Service Desk project, and one to attach it to the issue as explained in [JSDECO-10|https://ecosystem.atlassian.net/browse/JSDECO-10]\r\n # It contains a broken link to the endpoint servicedesk/\\{serviceDeskId}/attachTemporaryFile\u00a0\r\n # The example is using the key {{\"get_public\": \"boolean\"}} that does not exist. It is {{\"public\": \"boolean\"}} instead.\r\n # It says that, in order to use\u00a0experimental methods, you must include the \"{{X-ExperimentalApi: true}}\"\u00a0header in your requests. This works but when sending the request without the header to the instance, this replies saying that you should use\u00a0\"{{X-ExperimentalApi: opt-in}}\". Both headers actually work (as you can see I have used both of them in below examples) but it should be mentioned in the doc.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround/Solution:\r\n\r\n1) You can achieve the same result by using the JIRA Core REST API endpoint to add an attachment to an issue as explained in:\r\n - [https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirakb/how-to-attach-an-attachment-in-a-jira-issue-using-rest-api-699957734.html/]\r\n\r\n2) You can use 2 calls to attach the files as in the below example (adding 2 attachments first to the project and then to the issue):\r\n - *Adding the files to the project (endpoint: servicedesk/\\{serviceDeskId}/attachTemporaryFile):*\r\n{noformat}\r\ncurl -D- -u USER:PASSWORD -H \"X-Atlassian-Token: nocheck\" -H \"X-ExperimentalApi: true\" -F \"file=@/path/to/file/test2.txt\" -X POST https://INSTANCE.atlassian.net/rest/servicedeskapi/servicedesk/SERVICE_DESK_ID/attachTemporaryFile\r\n....\r\nHTTP/1.1 100 Continue\r\n.....\r\nHTTP/1.1 201 Created\r\n......\r\n{\"temporaryAttachments\":[{\"temporaryAttachmentId\":\"5ad41f7b-882a-4f12-8a08-9b401d6dd3bf\",\"fileName\":\"test2.txt\"}]} \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncurl -D- -u USER:PASSWORD -H \"X-Atlassian-Token: nocheck\" -H \"X-ExperimentalApi: opt-in\" -F \"file=@/path/to/file/test3.txt\" -X POST https://INSTANCE.atlassian.net/rest/servicedeskapi/servicedesk/SERVICE_DESK_ID/attachTemporaryFile\r\n.....\r\n{\"temporaryAttachments\":[{\"temporaryAttachmentId\":\"3f9ff4f9-99a0-4ee0-868e-8b93c8c67bee\",\"fileName\":\"test3.txt\"}]} \r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n - *Adding the files to the issue (endpoint: /rest/servicedeskapi/request/\\{issueIdOrKey}/attachment):*\r\n{noformat}\r\ncurl -D- -u USER:PASSWORD -H \"Accept: application/json\" -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -H \"X-ExperimentalApi: opt-in\" -d '{\"additionalComment\": {\"body\": \"TEST JSD ENDPOINT: adding 2 attachments\"}, \"public\": \"true\",\"temporaryAttachmentIds\": [\"5ad41f7b-882a-4f12-8a08-9b401d6dd3bf\", \"3f9ff4f9-99a0-4ee0-868e-8b93c8c67bee\"]}' -X POST https://INSTANCE.atlassian.net/rest/servicedeskapi/request/ISSUE_ID/attachment\r\n.....\r\nHTTP/1.1 201 Created\r\n.....\r\n{\"comment\":{\"_expands\":[\"attachment\",\"renderedBody\"],\"id\":\"10504\",\"body\":\"TEST JSD ENDPOINT: adding 2 attachments\\n\\n[^test2.txt] _(0.0 kB)_\\n\\n[^test3.txt] _(0.0 kB)_\",\"public\":true,...............} \r\n{noformat}",

Environment\r\n* JSD 1000.1313.0\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce.\r\n# Create new customer in JSD.\r\n# Customer accepts invitation sent via email.\r\n# Customer sets a \"Display name\" and password e.g. \"Password123\".\r\n# JIRA Service Desk admin resets customer password by hovering the mouse pointer over the customer account; More > Administer.
