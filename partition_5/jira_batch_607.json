Summary \r\n\r\nWhen using Jira Software (version < 7.10) and following the UI prompts from the *Versions & licenses* to upgrade Jira, you ultimately upgrade *only* Jira Core. With the recent UI updates with Jira 7.10, this breaks icons and other interface features when accessing Jira Software functions.\r\n\r\nAlthough Jira Core and Jira Software are not compatible when on different versions, this is not made clear in the UI. In fact, the workflow from * Versions & licenses* encourages customers to mismatch versions. Ultimately, this leads to a confusing and frustrating experience where Jira is ultimately left in a non-working state.\r\n\r\nh3. Environment \r\nJira Core 7.10 w/ Jira Software 7.9 or lower installed\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce \r\n# Install Jira Software 7.8\r\n# Navigate to *Versions & licenses* and notice the message about upgrading\r\n# Click *Download* next to Jira Core\r\n#* A window pops up, with checkboxes that appear to indicate that Jira Software will also be upgraded as part of the process\r\n# Click *Get installer*\r\n# You are taken to the Jira Core download page. Download installer and run it.\r\n# You are now running on the latest version of Jira Core, but still on your old version of Jira Software. At this point you\u2019ll notice that project icons are missing, some text fields don\u2019t work properly, and UI elements are missing colors.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results \r\n\r\nThe UI directs users to upgrade Jira Software or provides an otherwise non-breaking path.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results \r\n\r\n !1.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\n !2.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\n !3.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\n !4.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\nh3.Workaround \r\nUse the [Jira Software installer|https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/download] rather than the Jira Core installer.\r\n",

      "description": "{panel:bgColor=#e7f4fa}\r\n*NOTE:* This suggestion is for *JIRA Server*. Using *JIRA Cloud*? [See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-3821].\r\n{panel}\r\n{panel:title=Atlassian Status as of 17\u00a0November 2017|borderStyle=solid|borderColor=#3c78b5|titleBGColor=#eeeeee|bgColor=#ffffff}\r\nHi everyone,\r\n\r\nWe're excited to announce that Priority schemes were just shipped with Jira Software 7.6. As some of you have already noticed, 7.6 was released yesterday, and you can download it\u00a0[here|https://pl.atlassian.com/software/jira/download].\r\n\r\n*What we've built*\r\n\r\nAs mentioned in our previous update, after research, spikes, and user interviews, we've decided that introducing Priority schemes is the best solution for our customers. This feature uses a well-known administrative mechanism, and maintains a consistent experience.\r\n\r\n*Further improvements*\r\n\r\nWe've put a lot of effort into delivering Priority schemes as early as possible to make it for the 15th anniversary. We've decided that some further improvements will be added after the Jira 7.6 release. These will include: REST APIs to manage priority schemes, the ability to copy the priority schemes, as well as some minor UI improvements. We're planning to release them in the following Jira version (most likely 7.7).\r\n\r\n*Jira Service Desk*\r\n\r\nWe've been working closely with the Jira Service Desk team to understand the impact of Priority schemes on customers using Service Desk projects. We wanted to make sure that these customers receive the best experience when Priority schemes are introduced.\r\nTo achieve this goal, we've identified further work, and are scoping it specifically for Jira Service Desk.\r\nTo make this feature available for Jira Core and Jira Software customers as quickly as possible, we've decided to release it without the support for Service Desk projects. What it means is that admins will not be able to associate a priority scheme with a Service Desk project in the first version.\r\nThis capability will be released independently by the Jira Service Desk team. Tracked in JSDSERVER-1374\r\n\r\n*Resolutions per issue type*\r\n\r\nWe're re-adding the previous update on Resolutions per issue type here so that it's not lost in the stream of comments on this suggestion. \r\nResolutions per issue type is really a separate feature request which we'll prioritise independently. In order to track it properly, we've created a separate suggestion purely for Resolutions per issue type here:\u00a0JRASERVER-65924.\r\nIn hindsight we should have separated the two a long time ago, but we promise we will use all the comments around resolutions from this suggestion in the design of the feature, so no need to put the same comments, just make sure to vote and watch the issue! We will provide further updates in there.\r\n\r\nYou can read more details regarding Priority schemes and other capabilities that we added in Jira Software 7.6\u00a0[here|https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirasoftware/jira-software-7-6-x-release-notes-938027181.html].\r\nAs always, we would love to hear your feedback so feel free to reach out to me directly, or post a comment in this suggestion.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nJakub Lazinski\r\nProduct Manager, Jira Server\r\n{panel}\r\n*Original request description:*\r\n\r\nAs a JIRA Administrator I need more granular configuration for my projects:\r\n # I want to be able to specify different priorities for different projects instead of having a global priority list. The current global priority can be used as a default, but I would like to be able to change them per project.\r\n # Depending on the issue type, the resolution may be different. For example: in case of bugs, the resolution may be set to \"fixed\", but in case of improvements there is nothing to fix and the resolution should rather be \"implemented\". I need to be able to specify the default resolution separately per each issue type.\r\n\r\n*Potential Workarounds:*\r\n There are some workarounds that can provide some solutions to this issue:\r\n * [Custom fields|http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Adding+a+Custom+Field] for priorities and resolutions can be used on a per-project basis.\r\n * Customizing velocity templates to limit the visible priorities and resolutions per project, similar to what's [posted below|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRA-3821?focusedCommentId=212921&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-212921] (though this approach does not apply for JIRA Cloud customers).",

Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n# Create new priority scheme using eg. 3 different priorities and associate it with a project\r\n !screenshot-1.png|thumbnail! \r\n# Set up incoming mail handler and associate it with the project\r\n# Send 3 emails: one with low, other with high and the thrid one without priority set\r\n# Issues get created\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nEach mail creates a ticket and assign a calculated priority according to the associated priority scheme.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nOnly mail without priority flag creates ticket with the default priority set from project's priority scheme.\r\nOther two mails create issues and assign priorites which are non-existent in associated priority scheme, but they are defined in Default Priority Scheme.\r\n\r\nExample the ticket created from the email sent with High priority flag, the priority has been marked as \"(not available)\":\r\n !screenshot-2.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\nh3.Workaround\r\nCurrently there is no known workaround for this behavior. A workaround will be added here when available",

Expected Behavior\r\nIssue is created with the default priority defined in the Priorities Scheme.\r\n\r\nh2. Actual Behavior\r\nIssue is created with the priority defined in the middle of the entire Priorities list.\r\n Reference: http://<base-url>/secure/admin/ViewPriorities.jspa\r\n\r\nh5. Even number\r\nIf it's even number, it will select the nth priority returned by the total number divided by 2.

Notes\r\nAnother variant is that if an email is sent with the \"high priority\" flag, it creates the request with one of the highest priorities using Default Priority Scheme instead of custom priority scheme. This is not solved by any of the workarounds.\r\n\r\nh2.Workaround\r\n * You can rearrange the order of the priorities to set the one you want as default to be in the middle on the global list of priorities at Jira Administration > Issues > Priorities.\r\n OR\r\n * You can use the completely free add-on [Workflow Enhancer|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/575829/workflow-enhancer-for-jira?hosting=server&tab=overview], which adds Universal postfunction to workflows that allows you to evaluate values from fields, and you can use this in the _Create_ transition, adding a post function to evaluate if the priority is out of the project's Priorities, and to set the priority to the one you want as default. For example, setting the result of the evaluation as FALSE, from the following, should do the trick: \\{code} \\{Priority}\r\n== \"Critical\" || \\{Priority} == \"Major\" || \\{Priority} == \"Minor\" || \\{Priority} == \"Trivial\" || \\{Priority} == \"Blocker\" \\{code}\r\n",

Now, we have planned to use JIRA servicedesk in the company. We are trying to study the integration between JIRA service desk and and JIRA software. we have some questions. \r\n\r\n\r\nFirstly, how to escalate ticket to developer (who does have JIRA Software or JIRA Core license only) if the customer creates ticket by using portal, . As I know, helpdesk cannot escalate the ticket to developer directly if they doesn't have JIRA servicedesk license. Is it correct?  However, helpdesk is able to mention the name of developer in the comment and send to internal comment. After that, Jira developer will look into the issue and create new JIRA Software ticket. Then,they will link the issue to the Jira service desk ticket. Is it correct?\r\n\r\nSecondly, is it possible to escalte ticket to developer who doesn't have JIRA servicedesk license but they have jira core or JIRA software license. \r\n\r\nThirdly, do you have on-call support contact number? \r\n\r\nYour fast response will be highly appreciated.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you have any questions. Thank you. \r\n\r\nBest Regards,\r\nNathasit B.\r\n ",

Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nThis is one of the ways to trigger the user search\r\n # Create 50k users\r\n # Limit assignable permission for specific _projectA_ for a very small subset of users\r\n # Trigger assignable user search for _projectA_\r\n\r\nREST call:\r\n # Trigger call to {{user/assignable/search}} (or {{user/assignable/multiProjectSearch}})\r\n ** Eg: rest/api/latest/user/assignable/search?username=&projectKeys=AG&issueKey=AG-13&maxResults=50&startAt=0&_=1529917579021\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nMemory usage by a thread serving the request a fairly low: up to 100MB\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n * Memory usage by a thread serving the request a quite high: 500MB+\r\n * If a large number of same requests are triggered at the same time, this may lead to OOM error due to exhausting of the heap.\r\n\r\nh3. Notes\r\n * when Jira searches over user base and tries to {{findUsers}} according to specific criteria, it accumulates the different data (usernameToGroups, usernameToGroupNames,usernameToGroupNamesInLowerCase) in _requestCache_ as a side-effect.\r\n * If user search base is quite large and search criteria is too specific (too strict) than a large number of _Username_ objects will be touched, that will lead to accumulating a large number of objects in _requestCache_ and large memory usage by a thread.\r\n * Note that when a thread finishes its work memory will be released, so it's not a memory leak.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n * None\r\n * Partial workarounds (if possible):\r\n ** reduce active base\r\n ** use more specific search\r\n\r\nh3. Note about the fix\r\n\r\nThe fix is not enabled by default. It will be applied only when [setting the JVM argument|https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiraserver076/setting-properties-and-options-on-startup-945111794.html]:\r\n{noformat}\r\n-Djira.cache.request.bounded.enabled=true\r\n{noformat}\r\nJira node restart is required.\r\nTo verify that the option was enabled correctly see if the Jira application log contains message:\r\n{noformat}\r\n2019-03-19 15:06:16,969 http-nio-8080-exec-1 INFO anonymous 906x1x1 - 0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1 / [c.a.j.cache.request.RequestCacheConfiguration] System property jira.cache.request.bounded.enabled is enabled and your requests scope caches are bounded with maxsize=1000\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nThe fix is about introducing the limit to number of objects stored by http request in it's cache. The default limit is 1000, but can be modified by setting JVM argument, e.g.:\r\n{noformat}\r\n-Djira.cache.request.bounded.size=2000\r\n{noformat}\r\nThe limit won't be applied if {{jira.cache.request.bounded.enabled}} is not set.",

      "description": "Expressions like {{fixVersion > A AND fixVersion < B}} work as expected when an issue has just one Fix version. When there are multiple Fix versions the above expression is interpreted as \"has value > A AND has (another) value < B\".\r\n This causes quite a bit of a confusion - see JRASERVER-22995.\r\n\r\nIt would be useful to be able to specify a \"has value between A AND B\" kind of condition.\r\n\r\nPossible syntax could be as following: {{fixVersion BETWEEN A AND B}} or {{fixVersion IN (A - B)}}.\r\n\r\nHere is the full story.\r\n\r\nOur project has several components with their own release cycles. So there are versions like 'UI-1.0.13' and 'DL-1.7.0'.\r\n Occasionally we make a \"product release\" that includes specific versions of the components: 'R1', 'R2', etc.\r\n Product releases are \"rolling\". I.e. individual components could be updated later and \"delivered\" into 'R1'.\r\n I would like to be able to filter JIRA issues to see which fixes were delivered in 'Rn' release. And would prefer not having to add a label or an extra 'R1' fix version to every issue.\r\n\r\nSome components are quite tightly coupled with the releases. I.e. R2 will likely have 'UI-2.0.x' versions.\r\n Others are pretty independent. So R2 would have DL-1.7.3 and R3 will use DL-1.7.4\r\n So using regexp patterns as suggested in JRASERVER-22995 would not quite work.\r\n\r\nMy idea was to create \"marker\" versions for product releases: R1, R2, etc.\r\n And make sure all the components versions are sorted properly with relation to product versions.\r\n And then a query like \"fixVersion between R1 and R2\" would easily show me all the changes delivered in the R2 release.\r\n\r\nOther options I could think of are:\r\n - Provide hierarchical versions (at least 1 level deep) and turn all component versions into corresponding product versions children; then filter as {{fixVersion IN R1}}.\r\n - Implement tags for versions and then filter (quite indirectly) based on something like {{fixVersion.tag = R1}}\r\n\r\nI would appreciate if you could suggest a better way to address this.\r\n But nevertheless I think having \"value in range\" type of condition would still be useful for JQL.\r\n\r\nP.S. It would be great if you could backport this change to JIRA version 7.5.x",

      "description": "h3. Summary\r\nJIRA core as a platfrom doens't handle http/https forward proxy authentication at a platform level.\r\nJIRA relies on built in JVM functionality to handle http/https proxy host and port to initiate the connection, but the JVM doesn't handle authentication with a forward proxy.\r\nThe JVM leaved the implementation for authentication to the application code.\r\nIn short, the JIRA core code should be able to handle *http.proxyUser* and *http.proxyPassword* on a global level.\r\n\r\nh3. Environment\r\n* JIRA 7.2.15  \r\n* Configure a forward proxy using basic proxy authentication: eg: squid or apache\r\n* Configure JIRA to use a forward proxy using following start up options:\r\n{code}\r\n-Dhttp.proxyHost=127.0.0.1 -Dhttp.proxyPort=3128 -Dhttp.proxyUser=user -Dhttp.proxyPassword=pass -Dhttps.proxyHost=127.0.0.1 -Dhttps.proxyPort=3128 -Dhttps.proxyUser=user -Dhttps.proxyPassword=pass  -Djdk.http.auth.tunneling.disabledSchemes\r\n{code}\r\n* Plan to configure DVCS pluign to try to connect to github using the proxy.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# After a freshly restarted JIRA\r\n# Login to JIRA as admin\r\n# Go to Applications and try to configure DVCS to connect to github\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n* JIRA is able to connect to github and verify the user account.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n* JIRA fails to connect to github and user is faced with a connection/access error.\r\n* In the logs we see warnings like this:\r\n{code}\r\n2018-05-24 11:27:15,178 http-nio2-13032-exec-44 WARN admin 687x111223x1 1q8lhhh IP,IP,IP /secure/admin/AddGithubOrganization!finish.jspa [c.a.j.p.d.s.github.webwork.AddGithubOrganization] Caused by: Unable to tunnel through proxy. Proxy returns \"HTTP/1.1 407 Proxy Authentication Required\"\r\n{code}\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Notes\r\n* You need to avoid doing any other functionality before doing the DVCS configuration to be able to see the error.\r\n* JIRA core doesn't initialize system wide java.net.Authenticator.setDefault(.Authenticator auth) with an [Authenticator object |http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk8/jdk8/jdk/file/687fd7c7986d/src/share/classes/java/net/Authenticator.java]. \r\nThis static method could be used to populate the needed Proxy-Authorization header to allow the connection to pass through the proxy.  \r\n\r\nh3.Workaround\r\n* For the time being, a working workaround for this is to rely on lower level implementations that would set a system wide authenticator object for JIRA, a good working example for this is the *JIRA Log Analyzer plugins* (Hercules).\r\nIf we access the Log Analyzer page before getting to DVCS configuration, a system wide authenticator will be initialized and will be used by any other implementation until JIRA is restarted.\r\n\r\nWith Debug logging for {{HttpURLConnection}} enabled (see KB [enable debug logging for outgoing-http-connections|https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirakb/how-to-enable-debug-logging-for-outgoing-http-connections-in-jira-952073102.html]): \r\n* Non-working example: note  _Authentication returned: null_\r\n{noformat}\r\n17-Jun-2018 15:22:02.833 FINEST [http-nio-8081-exec-8] sun.net.www.protocol.http.HttpURLConnection$1.run Requesting Authentication: host =172.16.47.128 url = https://api.github.com/users/atlamstest\r\n17-Jun-2018 15:22:02.834 FINEST [http-nio-8081-exec-8] sun.net.www.protocol.http.HttpURLConnection$1.run Authentication returned: null\r\n17-Jun-2018 15:22:02.834 FINER [http-nio-8081-exec-8] sun.net.www.protocol.http.HttpURLConnection.getHttpProxyAuthentication Proxy Authentication for AuthenticationHeader: prefer Basic realm=\"Password Required\" returned null\r\n{noformat}\r\n* Working example: _Authentication returned: java.net.PasswordAuthentication@23fa1ec4_\r\n{noformat}\r\n17-Jun-2018 15:26:02.039 FINEST [hercules] sun.net.www.protocol.http.HttpURLConnection$1.run Requesting Authentication: host =172.16.47.128 url = https://confluence.atlassian.com/download/attachments/179443532/jira_regex_v2.xml\r\n17-Jun-2018 15:26:02.039 FINEST [hercules] sun.net.www.protocol.http.HttpURLConnection$1.run Authentication returned: java.net.PasswordAuthentication@23fa1ec4\r\n17-Jun-2018 15:26:02.041 FINER [hercules] sun.net.www.protocol.http.HttpURLConnection.getHttpProxyAuthentication Proxy Authentication for AuthenticationHeader: prefer Basic realm=\"Password Required\" returned sun.net.www.protocol.http.BasicAuthentication@6515e4a2\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nThere is currently no grantee that the above workaround would continue to work, other plugins can actually override this system wide authenticator using the above static method and prevent the system form working if the plugin have bad code.\r\n\r\n*Please note* that the above problem mainly affects code using *java.net* API eg: DVCS/Eclipse egit or Log Analyzer using the *HttpUrlConnection* class, Apache HttpClient uses different ways to implement proxy authentication.\r\n",

In the next step, the purchasing dept would create a PO pdf and use the Purchase Order custom field to attach it for review. And so on for the invoice and the receipt.\r\n\r\nThen, someone viewing the ticket can quickly identify each component, they can show the filenames (maybe even with links!) as a column in the Issue Navigator, I can put attachments on different tabs and, essentially, design and tailor things the way I can with most other aspects of Jira.\r\n\r\nAll these attachments can still end up in the big ol' attachment 'bin' shown in each Issue \u2013 that would be fine since I could now use those custom fields in the View screen to organize attachments how I want elsewhere in the view.\r\n\r\nI feel this would greatly enhance workflow flexibility, and be extremely helpful in use cases which require a lot of attachments.",

      "description": "h3. Summary\r\n\r\nWhen a notification email sent about a comment containing an in-line image is opened in the desktop version of Outlook (2010 or 2016), the image is cropped and only the bottom part of it is loaded.\r\n\r\nNote that:\r\n - this issue only occurs with the Windows Desktop version of Outlook and not the web version of Outlook.\r\n - this issue only occurs with JIRA Core Emails (and not with Service Desk Customer Emails which use a different template)\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to reproduce\r\n - Install the Outlook app on a Windows server (for example Outlook 2010)\r\n - Enable Outlook app to automatically download images from Trust Center Settings -> Automatic Download\r\n - Log in JIRA in Internet Explorer (v11) with Remember me checked, so that Outlook app can use the cookie to authenticate against JIRA\r\n - Trigger an email notification with a thumbnail attachment, then another email with a full image attachment\r\n - Open the email notification in Outlook\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nThe image from the comment is cropped and only the bottom part is loaded:\r\n !outlookapp.png|thumbnail!\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nThe full image from the comment should be loaded, like it's the case on the web version of Outlook:\r\n !outlookwebthumb.png|thumbnail! \r\n !outlookwebfull.png|thumbnail!\r\nh3. Reason\r\n\r\nWe found from [this forum|https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8980956/line-height-not-working-in-outlook-2010-for-html-email] that the reason why the cropping is happening with Outlook is because Outlook supports line-height specified in percents. For example, line-height: 20px isn't supported, but line-height: 110% is.\r\n\r\nIf we look into the source of an example of JIRA notification, we can see that the properties \"line-height: 20px; mso-line-height-rule: exactly;\" are used:\r\n{code:java}\r\n    <tr> \r\n        <td id=\"header-avatar-image-container\" valign=\"top\" style=\"padding: 0px; border-collapse: collapse; vertical-align: top; width: 32px; padding-right: 8px\" width=\"32\"> <img id=\"header-avatar-image\" class=\"image_fix\" src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/448a055777f24456a7b4cd6dc96561c7?d=mm&amp;s=48\" height=\"32\" width=\"32\" border=\"0\" style=\"border-radius: 3px; vertical-align: top\"> </td> \r\n        <td id=\"header-text-container\" valign=\"middle\" style=\"padding: 0px; border-collapse: collapse; vertical-align: middle; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; mso-line-height-rule: exactly; mso-text-raise: 1px\"> <a class=\"user-hover\" rel=\"mfilipan@gmail.com\" id=\"email_mfilipan@gmail.com\" href=\"http://localhost:8080/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=XXXXXXXX\" style=\"color:#3b73af;; color: #3b73af; text-decoration: none\">XXXXX</a> <strong>commented</strong> on <a href=\"http://localhost:8080/jira/browse/TEST-7\" style=\"color: #3b73af; text-decoration: none\"><img src=\"cid:jira-generated-image-avatar-d40e1fa1-e19a-48e2-baca-e6b4147ecd1d\" height=\"16\" width=\"16\" border=\"0\" align=\"absmiddle\" alt=\"Task\"> TEST-7</a> </td> \r\n    </tr> \r\n{code}\r\nBecause the line-height properly is in px and not in percentage, the mso-line-height-rule is not properly interprated by Outlook and the image is cropped\r\n To fix this issue, the CSS of the email template should:\r\n - either set the line-height property with a percentage value (for example, changing \"line-height: 20px; mso-line-height-rule: exactly;\" to \"line-height: 100%; mso-line-height-rule: exactly;\" fixes the issue)\r\n - or remove the properly mso-line-height-rule from the CSS if the line-height property can't be set to a percentage value\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nThe workaround would consists in modifying the CSS of the notification email located in the <JIRA_INSTALL>/atlassian-jira/WEB-INF/classes/templates/email/ as explained in [Customizing email content|https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiraserver073/customizing-email-content-861253783.html?_ga=2.150501622.1939346461.1528698174-1469285456.1509719284] but *this method is a customization of JIRA, therefore not supported by Atlassian Support*",
