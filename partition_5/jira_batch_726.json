It might be reflected in JIRA as specific version, like \"v2\", or \"next\". Issues related to that version should by default go to the person who is doing those changes (version lead), not current maintainers of previous version components.\r\n\r\nSo my proposal is to add support for version-based default assignee. To avoid conflicts with component-based default assignee it should be also possible to set priorities between those. So for v1 issues would go to component lead, and for v2 it would be version lead who gets the issues by default.",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-38928].\n  {panel}\n\nOn both the Burndown Chart report in the Agile boards and the \"Agile Sprint Burndown Gadget\" on the Dashboards, the \"Remaining Values\" line is showing misleading information. \r\n\r\nI've configured my boards to use the \"Remaining Estimate and Time Spent\" setting, which is described as: \"Track time against issues using JIRA's Remaining Estimate and Time Spent fields. *The Burndown Chart will be based on these two values.*\"\r\n\r\nHowever, when I look at the \"Remaining Values\" line on the burndown charts, I'm not seeing the sum of the remaining estimates field as expected. I'm pretty sure I'm instead seeing the \"original estimate\" minus the \"time spent\" field. \r\n\r\nI've attached a picture showing the burndown for tasks assigned to one of my users and the difference this can make. On the left, the chart filters out any closed tasks (which have their remaining estimates at 0, since no work effort remains) and only sums the remaining estimates of open or in-progress tasks. On the right, the filter is simply assignee=KB, and it shows over 100 additional hours. \r\n\r\n_(By way of explanation, this user was assigned a few tasks that were overflow when others needed to adjust their sprint commitments due to scope creep. These may have had large original estimates but the remaining effort was much less, as you can see in the charts.)_\r\n\r\nWithout getting into discussions about how we use the remaining estimate field and whether or not to update it, the issue is that in the Agile board's configuration settings, I'm lead to believe that the red \"Remaining Values\" line represents the sum of the \"remaining estimates\" field, which it is not, and should be.",

Browse to an issue, and click within the description to edit it.\r\n2. Type in the word \"foo\", so that it's not in the description.\r\n3. While the description is still being edited, press \u2318+f to search for text.\r\n4. Search for \"foo\".\r\n5. Press escape to dismiss the search.\r\n\r\nWhat should have happened, is that your edits to the description have been lost. The reason this happens is that Chrome dismiss the Find panel on ESC *keydown*, which returns focus to the description input, and then on ESC *keyup* it discards the description editing.\r\n\r\nProbably the easy fix here is to just change the description edit to bind to *keydown* rather than *keyup*.\r\n\r\nIn case you're wondering _why_ you'd search while editing a description, in my case it was because I had a very large description of bullet points, and wanted to make sure the new item I was adding wasn't already covered in an earlier place.",

In the attached example, the x axis shows the age and the y axis shows the qty of issues. Issue status is showed by different colors. The number in the colored histogram is the issue qty of each status, and with a total qty above the histogram for the calculated time base. We would like to know if you can develop such kind of report chart in JIRA. If feasible, how long do you need to have it ready? Because we need to report the feasibility and the timing needed to senior management by this Thursday. So could you please send us a detailed feedback by end of this Wednesday (June 25th)?

In this example, the workflow property allows the reporter to delete their own attachments. The first example does not work because \"Reporter\" doesn't accept a parameter or value, while the second one doesn't work because the \"Denied\" value doesn't act as a negator - but is a suffix to make each rule unique.\r\n\r\nPlease see [this comment|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-38878?focusedCommentId=1979759&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-1979759] for more details.\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\nh3.

Expected Behavior\r\nJIRA wouldn't allow the reporter to delete it.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Behavior\r\nJIRA does allow the reporter to delete the attachment.\r\n\r\nh4. Workaround:\r\nUse a group condition for example so the reporter won't be able to delete it:\r\n{noformat:borderStyle=dashed| borderColor=#6A8EB3 |bgColor=#F8F8F8}\r\njira.permission.attachdeleteown.group = bogus\r\n{noformat}",

In order to be able to, on the one hand, keep traceability as to what issue (Story, Bug, Improvement) is developed and released in what version, and, on the other hand be able to prepare and manage a single backlog of features that need implementation in, possibly, multiple artefacts (add shoppingcart on web, android, ios for example),....
