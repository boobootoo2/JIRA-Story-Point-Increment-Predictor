      "description": "The dashboard can quickly get cluttered up when there are several projects going on, everyone want their graphs and charts, tables etc. on the dashboard.   While some of the \"multiple-dashboards\" proposals address this more or less (e.g. by allowing saving/loading/sharing of dashboards), I think a project-specific dashboard, controlled by the project lead and viewable by anyone whose permissions allow them to view the project, would be helpful.  It would show up as a tab in the 'browse project' set.  There may be filters that the particular group likes to use, just for their project, graphs they want to see, handy portlets for the project processes, etc. without losing the view of the 'main' dashboard(s).\r\n\r\nExample: The 'preset filters' on the current page are somewhat limited, and there is no way to tweak them and have the tweaked version show up in the project page.  So they end up in the big global filter bucket on the main dashboard, where other project members who don't need them are forced to deal with them.\r\n\r\nExample: A project lead wants the team to see a burndown chart, time-tracking, or one of the new jfreechart created/resolved charts on the project page.\r\n\r\nThe ability to customize/add portlets to the existing 'open issues' tab would be useful as well.",

      "description": "While running a large import Jelly script (85,000 comments added), we noted what appears to be a significant memory leak.  It is problematic because this makes it a bit of a crap shoot as to whether the job will finish and because each addcomment is atomic, the incomplete jobs leave us with a messy state to sort out (e.g. figure out which comments were added multiple times because the job was rerun).\r\n\r\nSymptoms include odd behavior of the job and very high, non-decreasing memory utilization post batch.  The job runs very rapidly for a while and then mysteriously pauses for -2-3 hours before continuing at a much lower throughput.  Sometimes, the job hangs with apparently, no hope of ever finishing.  When the job is complete, memory utilization remains extremely high (e.g. > 95%) and never comes down...even when garbage collection is forced.  The only resolution is to bounce the server.  \r\n\r\nOther notes:\r\n1.  The entire job consisted of AddComment Jelly tags\r\n2.  The source file was locally stored on the server (so no funny business with network latency or something along those lines)\r\n3.  The server was bounced prior to the start of the job to insure that there was no DB lock or system resource contention\r\n4.  There was no non-Jira related activity on the system during this process (e.g. backups)\r\n5.  E-mail notifications were disabled during the running of this script\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nTed",

When I logged in to JIRA it said that the database type mapping was incorrect and to change it, which I did and then restarted JIRA.\r\n\r\nJIRA then crashed fairly spectacularly with a SQLException while executing the following:INSERT INTO propertyentry (ID, ENTITY_NAME, ENTITY_ID, PROPERTY_KEY, propertytype) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?) (Cannot insert the value NULL into column 'ID', table 'jac_production_db.jirauser.propertyentry'; column does not allow nulls. INSERT fails. For full details/pain please see https://support.atlassian.com/browse/JSP-3966\r\n\r\nSo, if JIRA can tell that the database mapping is incorrect, shouldn't it NOT create the tables incorrectly? It would have saved me quite a bit of pain. Also, if it can tell, why do we need to set it explicitly in the first place?",

(todays date > due date). For this reason a new feature should be implemented:\r\n\r\n1a. Create a Switch in \"user preferences\" called \"highlight overdue issues\"\r\n1b. Create a switch on the search issue page, where you can dynamically switch highlighting on and off.\r\n2. Highlight every row in a filter result in \"light red\" , where the due date is yesterday or older\r\n3. Highlight every row in a filter result in \"yellow\", where the due date is today.\r\n4. Do not highlight anything else.\r\n\r\nWould be great to easily see, which tasks are overdue, and which tasks are still in time.\r\n\r\nMy guess: about 1-2 days of effort. What do you think?",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-9197].\n  {panel}\n\n{panel:title=Atlassian Update \u2013 13 Jan 2016|borderStyle=solid|borderColor=#ebf2f9 | titleBGColor=#ebf2f9 | bgColor=#ffffff}\r\nHi everyone,\r\n\r\nThanks for voting and commenting on this issue. Your feedback is key to helping us understand how you use JIRA so we can continue improving your experience. We have reviewed this issue over the last few days; however there are not currently any plans to implement this suggestion.\r\n\r\nPlease remember that jira.atlassian.com is one of many inputs for the JIRA roadmap. You can [learn more about our process here|https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/110373/how-does-the-jira-team-use-jira-atlassian-com].\r\n\r\nI understand that our decision may be disappointing. Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nDaniel Franz\r\ndfranz@atlassian.com\r\nPrincipal Product Manager, JIRA Platform\r\n{panel}\r\n  \r\n\r\nh3. Summary\r\nSince sub-tasks are directly related to their parents, those should be displayed in hierarchic order on the *Issue Navigator*. Something similar is already applied on Agile boards, for example.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\nIt's possible to use the [Script Runner plug-in|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.onresolve.jira.groovy.groovyrunner] to achieve this by adding a _Scripted Field_ to the sub-tasks, storing the Parent Issue's key.\r\n\r\n{panel}\r\nHere's the script:\r\n{code:java}\r\nimport com.atlassian.jira.issue.Issue;\r\n\r\nIssue parentIssue = issue.getParentObject();\r\ndef parentIssueKey, issueKey;\r\n\r\nif (parentIssue != null) {\r\n\tparentIssueKey = parentIssue.getKey();\r\n    return parentIssueKey;\r\n}\r\nelse {\r\n    issueKey = issue.getKey();\r\n    return issueKey;\r\n}\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nAnd here's the JQL operand you should append to filters for this ordering to be applied:\r\n{code:sql}\r\nORDER BY \"Parent Issue Key\" ASC, key ASC\r\n{code}\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\n(!) _Please note that Atlassian *does not* provide any kind of support to third-party add-ons or scripting of any kind, so we *cannot guarantee* any further assistance or maintenance on this script._",

I don't really care how much about the statistics across a whole project. It doesn't help too much to know that we have 1587 closed bugs.  It would however be much  more useful to know these figures for a particular version.  When our whole team is working hard towards a milestone/version it would be very useful to see the chart of who has the most bugs assinged to them, or how many critical bugs we have left, or how many bugs we've closed so far for that release.  Those would be very useful things. \r\n\r\nIt is possible somehow to get these graphs to show the figures per version?  Currently when I click on the version name I am just brought to the issue navigator, pre-filtered for that version.  But a dashboard view of the version/release would be much more useful.  Is there a way to get this sort of information?  \r\n\r\nI found the \"Single Level Group By Report\" which helps *some*, but isn't as nice at a glance as the few bar graphs.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\nEvan Leonard\r\n",

While there is a way to set the N (http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRA-8214), it seems impossible to specify \"start\" issue, in the same way it is done in the issue navigator.\r\n\r\nThe reason I ask for this is that I need to download a large set of issues. One thing I can do is to set N high enough and then pray that Jira won't crash or throw OutOfMemory () -- and there would be enough time for a prayer, because I'll be waiting at this side of the wire for quite a long time before first bytes come.\r\n\r\nWhat I would rather do, is the set N to a fixed number, say, 100, and fire requests at the server with \"start=0\", \"start=100\", \"start=200\", etc. -- in essense, paging through the result set. The response for each step is likely to come quicker and not to harm the Jira instance. (There could be problems with concurrent paging and modifications though...)",
