I was expecting it to use the standard Windows 'arrow pointer' for most of the window.\r\n\r\nAh! Just found that after I restarted the app the mouse pointer goes to what I'd expect it to see.\r\n\r\nI think this might be a bug in the installer. During the install process I got most of the way through the various screens (sorry, cannot remember which one) before the mouse pointer changed to the 'vertical arrows'. At the end of the install process I chose to start SourceTree straight away. I'm guessing that the initial execution of the program inherited this display from the install process.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nDave\r\n",

(And I'd suggest using this same term, given that so many developers are likely to be using IntelliJ).\r\n\r\nAs a refinement, perhaps there might be an \"auto powersave mode\", whereby switching focus away from SourceTree would disable its filesystem watching, ie so that it only does this when it has focus.\r\n\r\nObviously, this feature idea applies also to SourceTree on the mac.",
