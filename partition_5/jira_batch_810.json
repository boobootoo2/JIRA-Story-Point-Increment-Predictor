Previously they were able to do this - as from the [Answers|https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/33842/jira-creates-new-users-when-importing-issues-from-csv] thread:\r\n\r\n{quote}\r\nJIRA Importers Plugin bundled with JIRA 4.4.x does not allow anymore to skip creation of the users. We decided to remove this option as the import would have failed for these rows from CVS which indicate missing usernames. That in our opinion did not make sense and we wanted to simplify the import wizard.\r\n\r\nImporter expects a username in CSV file, not Display Name. There is no easy work-around for it at them moment. You could either pre-process your CSV file by replacing all \"Display Name\" cells with corresponding users, or you could hack JIRA Importer Plugin on your own - its source it available for all JIRA commercial license holders.\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nCan you please update the the following docs to have something about that in there?\r\n\r\nhttp://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA044/Importing+Data+from+CSV\r\nhttp://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Importing+Data+from+CSV\r\n\r\nThanks!",

This could be very useful if it e-mailed the list of issues, in the same way that a filter subscription already does.  As it stands, the Share feature only sends a link to the issue...but there's already the long-standing \"permalink\" button just to the left of Share that gives me that URL already.  So, as it exists today, the Share button only saves me pasting the permalink into an e-mail, and provides almost no additional value.\r\n\r\nWhen Sharing an individual issue, most of what I've said above is true (in that case, I don't even need to click permalink, I can just use the issue's URL), but the e-mail has a little more relevant data, especially in the Text version.\r\n\r\nNote that knowing the velocity templates used by these functions (i.e. which could be customized for a JIRA instance) would be an acceptable workaround for this problem (provided the velocity template for Sharing filter results could be modified to include the results themselves).",

But a user with this rights can modify Project-Role-Membership. This is not my goal.\r\n\r\nPossibly it's easyer to separat a Project-Role-Membership-administration to a new permission.\r\n\r\nI hope this idea was accepted, because we need this subdivision.\r\n\r\nBest regards\r\nlolo",

This right should be reserve to system administrators.\r\nHowever other parts of project administration (e.g. components) are not standardized and should remain freely editable for users with project administration rights.\r\n\r\nSo we'd like to see some more granular project admin rights, where we can restrict version management rights to system admins without preventing project admins to do other project administration tasks.\r\n\r\nSee this [question|https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/53962/how-can-i-disable-the-manage-versions-link-at-the-right-by-developing-a-plugin-or-some-other-way] for more details.",

Go to a Project\r\n1. Select _Issues > Manage_ Filters\r\n2. Create and save a filter \"*TestFilter*\"\r\n3. Select Edit in 'gear' icon drop down (in order to edit \"TestFilter\").\r\n4. Select Edit link from near upper-left corner (in order to edit\r\nthe filter criteria).\r\n5. Modify anything about the filter query details.\r\n\r\n* It would be good to have a *save* button here.\r\n\r\n6. You have to press the *search* button.\r\n7. It'll appear the \"Filter modified since loading\" message.\r\n8. Now, you'll need to go to the *Summary* tab.\r\n9. And, under *Operations* click on *Save changes to filter*.",

I had posted a question on Atlassian answers but it's not being addressed : https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/48199/accepted-translations-don-t-apply-gibberish-can-t-be-the-solution\r\n\r\nThats why I'll post this here as well:\r\n\r\nthere's a problem we are facing which really is a pain in the ... - translations, in our case German translations. New features aren't translated by Atlassian when they ship their products (e.g. issue links to Confluence pages /\"is mentioned in\"), OK...I have come to understand that translations are being maintained by a community (I do contribute myself...). I regularly check on updates and upload them via the UPM. Now the question: Why do certain translations not get reflected in the system. As an example I'd like to point out the descriptions on the project administration page. In the screenshot attached you can see that the descriptions are all in English while the headings are being translated. Many translations of the descriptions have been accepted almost A YEAR AGO but won't apply. Am I missing something here? Issues have been raised and marked as solved but the problem isn't solved for me. It really is kind of embarrasing showing people and potential customers JIRA features and always having to point out that the translations are being adressed half hartedly...I could certainly live with that since I prefer the English interface, many of our customers don't.\r\n\r\nYou'll find those problems everywhere: Activity stream, administration pages, project administration pages, workflow designer....\r\n\r\nI really like your products but you should focus on your customer needs. Germany is a large customer base and people are getting pissed off...",

You will not see the Actions gear box on the screen.\r\n!Screen shot 2012-05-08 at 3.45.19 PM.png!\r\n\r\nThis is reproducible with most versions of Jira.

      "description": "When a field uses the plain-text renderer, or part of a field is inside a \\{noformat\\} block, we should not parse that text for mentions.\n\nReasons:\n* I don't think it's right to have a field type that has historically been pure, plain text; to now respond to one single markup tag in one specific way.\n* In cases where plain-text has been explicitly enabled (that is, in behind-the-firewall instances, or where \\{noformat\\} is used), it's because the admin specifically wants that value to be treated as plain-text - e.g. stack traces or logs. If we no longer respect that, eventually we'll get customers asking for a plain-plain text field.\n* Plain-text is also used for performance reasons that may be impacted by this. If large amounts of text are accidentally inserted into a wiki-rendered JIRA field, the issue becomes unviewable and uneditable. In these cases, Support switches the field renderer to plain-text to fix it up. According to Studio support, this happens roughly once a month on hosted. We need to be sure that Mentions' addition of rendering to this field type does not impact this use case. \n* The current behaviour is not that great - if you mention someone in a plain-text field, you get the raw \\[~pwyatt\\] markup appearing on the View Issue screen (which means nothing to end-users on a plain-text system) and the whole field is rendered as wiki markup in the Mentions email (which is incorrect).\n* In Confluence, text inside \\{code\\} blocks is not parsed for Mentions.\n\nThat said, disabling Mentions in plain-text mode would essentially turn off this feature for most OnDemand customers, where the default comment/description renderer is plain-text. Obviously that's not desirable.\nSome solutions:\n* In the Mentions advertising, link to the instructions for enabling wiki markup. \n* Send it out dark in 5.0 OnDemand for plain-text customers, and in the next OnDemand release, add a one-click feature for admins to convert all their comment/description fields to wiki renderer. This would get around the pain that is the Field Configuration administration pages.\n",
