For example:\r\n\r\nSay i have the following Modules in the database:\r\n\r\nModule 1\r\nModule 2\r\nModule 3\r\n\r\nNow on my report for all the issues by type for version 1.0 i have a grid that looks like this roughly:\r\n\r\n                           Bug                    Enhancement\r\nModule 1          2                         1\r\nModule 2          3                         4\r\nModule 3          1                         0\r\n\r\nNow the issue arises when say Module 3 has no issues for this given version...Module 3 doesn't even appear on the report.  Similarly if there are no bugs for this version, that column doesn't even appear.\r\n\r\nI would like it if they appeared but had 0 for a value.  This way the report looks the same all the time.  It's easier to copy & paste into excel if i need to.  i can just do more with it.  plus it looks cleaner. \r\n\r\nI'm attaching a screen shot of how it looks a little weird in my environment.\r\n",

      "description": "Since we are working heavily with the linking cabability of JIRA we need a possibility to perform bulk tasks to all linked items per link type and link direction. Currently there exists no possibility to filter for instance for linked items in the issue navigator.  A user has currently only the possibility to see all linked items grouped by link-type and link-direction in the issue detail view (which is very perfect) or within ONE CELL a list of linked items in the 'linked items' column in the issue navigator, but there not grouped by link-type and direction. \r\n\r\nA possibel solution would be to have links in the issue view above the linked items (link-type and link-direction) which leads to the issue navigator with all the linked issue in the group of selected link-typs and/or link-direction. See my idea in the attached screen-shot!\r\nThis solution should be very cheap because JIRA already knows the needed queries for these selections being used in the issue detail views. I just guess that the only obstacle is that the issue navigator has no filter criteria for searchin for linked items. My idea here is to have following search capability in the issue navigator:\r\n\r\nTo search for linked items following search field-group is neccessary (inclusive some search scenarios):\r\nSearch for all items linked to issue JIR-1000 as 'duplicates' (the link direction is of relevance):\r\nIssue-ID: JIR-1000\r\nLink-Type: Duplicate\r\nLink-Name: duplicates\r\n\r\nor a search for all items being linked to issue JIR-1000 with the link-type 'Duplicate (the link direction isn't of relevance)\r\nIssue-ID: JIR-1000\r\nLink-Type: Duplicate\r\nLink-Name: None\r\n\r\nWith best regards,\r\nAlexander\r\n",

      "description": "Currently JIRA attempts to validate the issue's reporter when it is being moved. So if the original reporter doesn't have the create issue permission in the target project, then their reporter will be changed.\r\n\r\nWhile this way maintains the integrity of the destination project (reporters always have the create permission), it's usually not that useful and not particularly intuitive. Generally, people want to keep the reporter data, even if the issue is moved.\r\n\r\nThis becomes an especially large problem when users are \"deactivated\" by having all their permissions removed, so that still have issues they reported even though they don't have the permission to. When doing things that trigger a bulk move like Issue Type Scheme migration, the reporter information for these issues are lost.\r\n\r\nThe reporter field should probably be excluded from the move process altogether.\r\n\r\n(NB Not sure if a Bug or Improvment)",

Accordingly, we've set the outgoing email address to match our incoming helpdesk mail handler queue.  That means that whenever someone at Atlassian replies to one of our support requests, an issue gets created in our helpdesk project regarding that issue.  This isn't terrible, since we usually just move the issue to our JIRA project (where we handle issues related to jira itself) and then link them to the issue we created on our end that corresonds with the support request.  \r\n\r\nHmm...  another way to deal with this would be the ability to associate a support request with an existing issue so that replies would be attached to the right issue.",

      "description": "We had a user that was created by the CreateOrComment mail handler.  Since the handler sets the username of the user to be the email address and we use LDAP authentication, we later decided we needed to delete that user and re-add it with the username that matches his LDAP user.  I reassigned the issue that had been created along with the orignal user and changed the reporter to myself, so I could delete the user.  I then deleted the user.  \r\n\r\nIt so happens that there was a .vcf file attached to the original email and JIRA had dutifully attached it to the issue.  I discovered that, after deleting the user, every time the issue was viewed, errors were being written to the log.  Deleting the attachment fixed the problem.  \r\n\r\nThe functionality of JIRA appears to have been unaffected by this issue.  All the same, it seems that there are some vestigial connections to the deleted user that should be addressed at some point.  \r\n\r\nBelow are the log entries that were generated when I viewed the issue with the offending attachment and then deleted the attachment.\r\n\r\n2006-03-01 13:04:45,501 ERROR [webwork.util.ServletValueStack] METHOD: \"user\",
