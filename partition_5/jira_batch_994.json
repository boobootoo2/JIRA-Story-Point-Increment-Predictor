That is, the changes made through interactive configuration are lost.\n- The portlets that need no input parameters still have the \"edit\" icon and link active in the interactive configuration. The link does not do anything.\n- Manage portal page has a column heading \"Operations\" missing\n- When adding a portlet to a page the \"Currently configured\" total reflects the number of portlets of that type currently configured on the current dashboard. Need to clarify the fact that the number is only a total for one dashboard page.\n- Portlet names are not shown in the \"Configure Dashboard\" page\n- Portlet descriptions are not shown correctly - need to be internationalized\n",

      "description": "The Scheduler Administration page shown that no trigger has executed since about  16/Aug/04 12:50 PM. The current date is 24/Aug/04.\n\nFrom previous experience I know that restarting tomcat will restart the scheduler however I don't want to do that. I want to know how the scheduler can be fixed so that it does not die after a while.\n\nThe last automatic backup was this: 2004-Aug-16--1250.zip. These backups should be happening every 720 minutes.\n\nThe mail queue just keeps growing. I don't want to restart tomcat as I believe this will lose the pending messages. This has been happening for a while, after each tomcat restart. It is only today that I noticed the scheduler was inactive. I suspect the dead scheduler is the cause of this.\n\nCan a jsp be supplied for me to use to restart the scheduler?\n\nI have marked this as critical as the email notifications are a critical part of our business. Currently this is not reliable.\n\nI have noted JRA-2671 \"quartz scheduler can die\" but since I'm running 2.6 Pro it may not be the same issue.\n\nBelow I have posted the Scheduler Administration page details\n and the Services page details.\n\nBelow that is an extract from catalina.out around the time of the last scheduled backup, i.e. the last time the scheduler executed a job. There are two classes of entry in this log extract. The first is an entry that occurs thousands of times in the day leading up the death of the scheduler and the second class of entry is toward the end.

We've adopted a 'Hot Potato' workflow with Jira so far, whoever has the ticket assigned to them has the Hot Potato and must assign someone else to the ticket if it needs to bounce from their court.  We do not mind working this way, but it would be nice to have the ability to assign watchers to a ticket from the onset.  There are generally a few set of eyes which should be watching a ticket from its inception, and leaving that up to them to dig into the tickets to watch it themselves is a burden for administration.\n\nIn the end it would be nice to see the same assignability that is present in most of jira, ie, having groups/other flexible assign methods.",
