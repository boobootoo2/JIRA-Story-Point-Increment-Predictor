Additional documentation in the above section would have helped. I configured the plugin to link to the Atlassian test site. The plugin did not work and threw errors into the log (every hour). The documentation suggests browsing to the Atlassian test site but I now realize this only confirms that the browser is configured to pass the company firewall and the Atlassian test site is operational. However, the plugin is not using the browser, it is using the application server (Tomcat for me) to try to access the web. Therefore Tomcat must be configured to pass the firewall, but how took me a long time to discover. Solution: In startup.bat add the following parameters to the SET JAVA_OPTS= command:\r\n\r\n    -Dhttp.proxyHost=your-proxy-address -Dhttp.proxyPort=80\r\n\r\nNote: When creating an issue with Atlassian, there is no \"Severity of Problem\" option for a documentation change. Also, the \" Customer Timezone\" option does not allow for Adelaide, South Australia which is +9:30.",

It would be nice if we could specify the group to create the new user in directly in the email handler configuration section so that we don't have to manually edit the group membership later.  We do not allow the users created via the email handler to login directly to Jira but we still want their email address and name.  As it stands we are having the users created in the Jira-Users group (as per the default behavior) and another group which does not have a permission scheme associated with it.  Then we manually remove the user from the Jira-Users group and since there are no permissions associated to the other group, the user cannot assign any issues and therefore does not show up in any of the user drop down box lists.\r\n\r\nIs there any easier way of doing this or is there some automation step that we are missing?  We have already customized some of the email handler code to tailor the response emails to our needs but I would rather stay away from any code changes.\r\n",

You must remove some gadgets before proceeding.\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nBy default, you're only allowed to have 20 gadgets per dashboard.\r\n\r\nWe should document that if admins *really* want to raise this limit, then they can edit the 'jira.dashboard.max.gadgets=20' jira-application.properties property, to a value that suits them (and restart JIRA).\r\n\r\nOn a side note: Old dashboards (from data prior to JIRA 4.0) that already have more gagdets on them than this limit, will still be displayed for backwards compatibility.

After returning {{getStatusObjectsMap()}} returns the value of the {{statusObjectsMap}} field.\r\n\r\nThe problem is, if someone calls {{refresh()}} just after the null check in {{initStatuses()}} and before the read of the field in the outer method, then {{getStatusObjectsMap()}} will return null. Other methods presume that this method never returns null so a {{NullPointerException}} is thrown.\r\n\r\nThe map should be replaced by a {{LazyReference}} that self initialises.\r\n\r\nThis is most likely to happen during a Data Import as that is where {{refresh()}} may be called concurrently while other threads are accessing it.
