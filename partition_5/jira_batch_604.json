      "description": "h4. Request Description\r\n\r\nIn regards to clickjacking protection, Jira supports an _all or nothing_ approach.\r\n You can have it enabled for the full site, disable it for selected pages or disable it for the entire site.\r\n\r\nWhen gadgets are not available for certain functionalities, the option to load Jira content in Confluence is by using the HTML Macro together with an iFrame.\r\nThis is also true when customers need to include Jira pages within an iFrame in their own applications.\r\n\r\nFor some customers, completely disabling the security headers in Jira may not be an option, even for specific pages.\r\n While browsers support an option on which you can configure specific target sites to load content in an iFrame, Jira doesn't provide a configuration for it.\r\nh4. Current Scenario\r\n\r\nAs described in JRASERVER-25143 and in [Security headers in JIRA|https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirakb/security-headers-in-jira-939919914.html], Jira uses the following response headers related to [Clickjacking|https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Clickjacking]:\r\n||Header||Value||\r\n|X-Frame-Options|SAMEORIGIN|\r\n|Content-Security-Policy|frame-ancestors 'self'|\r\n\r\nAs explained in [Security headers in JIRA|https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirakb/security-headers-in-jira-939919914.html], using JVM arguments we can completely disable these headers for specific pages or for the entire site.\r\nh4. Expected Scenario\r\n\r\nIn addition to the _current scenario_, Jira should have a configuration to allow access to the entire site for specific target applications while preventing the access to any other.\r\n This can be achieved by providing a list of allowed sites using the following response headers:\r\n * [{{ALLOW-FROM}} directive|https://www.keycdn.com/blog/x-frame-options/#3-ALLOW-FROM-uriDirective].\r\n * [{{Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors}}|https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Content_Security_Policy_Cheat_Sheet#Preventing_Clickjacking].\r\n\r\nBoth directives may be required because of different browser compatibility:\r\n * [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Frame-Options#Browser_compatibility]\r\n * [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/frame-ancestors#Browser_compatibility]\r\n\r\nh4. Workaround\r\nIf using a reverse proxy, modify the response headers with the clickjacking directives highlighted above.\r\nh4. Changes on Nginx configuration\r\nThe goal with this Nginx change is to modify the [CSP: frame-ancestors|https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/frame-ancestors] response header sent from Jira, allowing specific services to load a Jira page within an iFrame.\r\n\r\nBy default, Jira sends the following response header for all requests:\r\n{code}\r\nContent-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors 'self';\r\n{code}\r\n\\\\\r\n\r\nWhat we need to do from Nginx is to remove this response header and send a new one with the changes we need.\r\n\\\\\r\n\r\nTo remove the default response header, the following [directive|http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_proxy_module.html#proxy_hide_header] can be used.\r\n{code}\r\nproxy_hide_header Content-Security-Policy;\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nTo add the header with the needed configuration, the following [directive|http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_headers_module.html#add_header] should be used.\r\n{code}\r\nadd_header Content-Security-Policy \"frame-ancestors 'self' <external-service-URL>\" always;\r\n{code}\r\n{{<external-service-URL>}} should be replaced using the standard defined for {{host-source}} in [this link|https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/frame-ancestors].\r\n\\\\\r\n\r\nBoth of the above configuration should be added within the {{location}} directive related to Jira in the Nginx config file.",

Additionally, it can be left blank to instead use the current user as the component lead.\r\n\r\n(!) At this time, there is no ability to supply a *NULL* or *empty* parameter to identify issues which are part of a component with *no component lead*. Admins will find this handy should they ever need to identify this population of issues.\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nImplement a new function, or extend the current *componentsLeadByUser* to accept a *NULL* or *empty* type parameter in order to match against components which have no lead.\r\n\r\nh3. Why this is important\r\n \r\nFor a system which uses components regularly as part of the system's regular workflow, components which have no lead (and the issues in those components) becomes a point of interest for admins. Jira currently offers no way to bulk identify these components, and by extension, no way to identify issues which are in these components.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround \r\n\r\nIdentify all components with no lead directly from the database:\r\n* {{select * from component where LEAD is NULL;}}\r\n\r\nThe results can be used as arguments in JQL to find these issues manually.",

Summary\r\n\r\nWhen some issue that is about to appear in Activity Stream gadget has a lot of comments (e.g. 200) made after creation of a lot of history entries (e.g. 15000), the loading time can be too high for the gadget to display the results. The timeout for loading gadget data is unmodifiable and is set at 10 seconds.\r\n\r\nThe problem exists because of current way of calculating issue summary for comment is inefficient. It scales defined as number of comments times number of history entries before given comment was made.\r\nh3. Steps to reproduce\r\n # Setup Jira with some issues containing 15000 entries in history tab\r\n # Make 200 comments in the issue.\r\n # Load Activity Stream gadget\r\n\r\nOr you can use prepared backup for Jira 7.2.15:  [^JRASERVER-67865-reproduction-backup.zip]\r\n(user: admin / password: admin)\r\nNote: the backup is different than result of steps from above.\r\n\r\nh4.

Notes\r\nActivity Stream has safety mechanism that prevents instance from being flooded by Activity Stream calculation. The mechanism will not run the calculation for some time after failure. This backoff time increases with every timeout. For reproduction purposes you can turn off this mechanism by adding JVM property to your Jira: {{-Dnavlink.failurecache.initialexpiryMs=0}}.",

Scenario 2 - Issue Transitioned (the opposite behavior)\r\n# When Counter is not Two, transition ABC-1 and set Counter to Two on the transition screen -> Complete the transition\r\n(-) The WebHook is not triggered as expected.\r\n# When Counter is Two, transition ABC-1 and set Counter to One (or None) on the transition screen -> Complete the transition\r\n(i) The WebHook is triggered.\r\n\r\n{panel}\r\n(flag) This makes it impossible to achieve this requirement:\r\n* Fire the WebHook only when ABC-1 is transitioned and its Counter value is set to Two from a different value that doesn't match the WebHook JQL at the time of clicking the transition button.\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\nh3.

For example, if the WebHook is added to the post-function list of the Transition, it's not fired either (following Scenario 2), regardless of the order of the post-function.\r\n(on) One may expect that, if the WebHook Post-function is after the Issue Re-index Post-function, the WebHook should be triggered.",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-28290].\n  {panel}\n\n{panel:title=Atlassian Status as of 13 August 2014|borderStyle=solid|borderColor=#3C78B5| titleBGColor=#3C78B5| bgColor=#E7F4FA}\r\nHi All,\r\n\r\nThanks so much for your votes and comments on this feature request.\r\n\r\nAfter analysis of this issue we decided it is not something we can put on our short to mid term roadmap. Therefore we think it is only fair to not keep this issue as open and close it as \"won't fix\". We will take this feedback into account as we work on ongoing design and usability improvements to the view issue page.\r\n\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nJason\r\nJIRA Product Management\r\njwong (at) atlassian (dot) com\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\n*Original description*\r\nWhen using JIRA, I often change the attachment sort order. I would really like to have a 'default sort order' so I don't have to do it as often.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround:\r\n\r\nThis is an unsupported, and hacky workaround but hopefully it helps some people. You can use the following code in your announcement banner:\r\n{code}<script>var direction = \"asc\"; //Other option is \"desc\"\r\nvar sortBy = \"dateTime\"; //Other option is \"fileName\"\r\n\r\nvar origUrl = window.location.href;\r\nvar patt = /browse\\/[A-Z][A-Z]+-[0-9]+/;\r\nvar key = new RegExp(\"[A-Z][A-Z]+-[0-9]+\");\r\n\r\nvar sort = \"?attachmentSortBy=\"+sortBy+\"&attachmentOrder=\"+direction+\"#attachmentmodule\";\r\nif(patt.test(origUrl) && !JSON.parse(sessionStorage.getItem('hasReloaded' + key))){\r\n\tlocation.assign(origUrl + sort);\r\n\tsessionStorage.setItem('hasReloaded' + key, 'true');\r\n} else {\r\n    sessionStorage.setItem('hasReloaded' + key, 'false');\r\n}</script>{code}\r\n\r\nThis will automatically switch to sorting by Date Ascending. You can tweak it to suit your needs. \r\n(i) *This will only work for JIRA server installations. JIRA Cloud [does not support|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRA-27864] inserting custom code into the announcement banner.*\r\n\r\nIf you are on cloud, or are an individual user that wants to have this functionality without inserting it for everyone, you can use the user script: [^JIRA Order Attachments by Date.user.js] within [Tampermonkey|https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en] for Chrome, or [Greasemonkey|https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/] for Firefox.",

      "description": "h3. Summary\r\nh3. Summary\r\nJira can become unresponsive when too many concurrent \"Create Issue\" requests happen. \r\nWhile the problem is similar to JRASERVER-30528, it has some specific conditions:\r\n * The threads create new Issue and each would create a transaction as part of {{updateValues}} (and request a connection from the pool), not all would get a connection and some would be waiting.\r\n ** We will call those that acquired a connection threads 'A' to 'H'. Threads 'I' and 'J' would be waiting.\r\n * At some point one thread would cause the sequence generator to require new block of sequences\r\n * The sequence generator would request a new connection from the pool. Assume this is Thread 'A'.\r\n * Thread 'A' would then require a sequence number calling {{SequenceUtil.SequenceBank.getNextSeqId()}} and need to get a new block of ids would then request a connection from the DB pool to do so\r\n ** It needs a new connection to do this so it is not in the transaction of the calling thread\r\n * Thread 'A' is waiting for the connection from the DB pool. DB pool is full.\r\n * The remaining threads would block at {{SequenceUtil.SequenceBank.getNextSeqId()}}, which is a synchronised method\r\n * Threads 'B' to 'H\" are all now waiting on the synchronization lock of {{SequenceUtil.SequenceBank.getNextSeqId()}} which is held by thread 'A' and so will never release a connection for thread 'A' to use.\r\n * Jira becomes unresponsive\r\n ** Afterwards, the threads are in state similar to deadlocks while waiting for connection pool. After a DB pool timeout expires, connections will timeout, opening up new connections to eventually then complete the requests. During this period of time, Jira would be unresponsive.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n * Create many *global* fields with default values\r\n**  Example from local testing: created 50 select fields with default values configured.\r\n * Initiate a constant stream of concurrent requests creating issues in Jira,  a number of concurrent requests needs to be larger than the maximum DB pool size in {{dbconfig.xml}}.\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nJira creates all issues successfully\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nJira becomes unresponsive; and in large production instances, may require a restart. Depending on the scenario, Jira may also recover after a period of time.\r\n\r\nh3.

Workaround\r\n* Increasing the database pool size (in {{$jira-home/dbconfig.xml}}) can help to alleviate this problem. Increasing the pool size will reduce the impact this bug has (as there will be more connections available for other threads to complete during peak periods).\r\n* Decrease pool timeout value _\"<pool-max-wait>5000</pool-max-wait>\"_ (in {{$jira-home/dbconfig.xml}})\r\n* (!) When increasing the database pool size in Jira, be sure to take into account the hardware of your database server, the workload it might be performing for other applications, as well as how many connections it can support - for example, MySQL has a maximum of 150 connections + 1 super user; and Postgres typically has a default of 100 connections. Make small, incremental changes, testing and verifying as you go.",
