If you have 1000 clients and 1 client can't run your software at all and needs it for his mission-critical tasks, this is urgent, but (from your perspective) not very important.\n\nOn the other hand, a bug that is very severe but rarely encountered in daily use is very important but not very urgent.\n\nPriority is, by this definition confusing. If priority is \"Critical\" does this represent an important or an urgent issue?\n\nTherefore I suggest that you at least make it possible to use this feature either by:\n1. moving to important/urgent model instead of priority\n2. letting the user decide which model to use (either at install or being able to change it dinamically)\n3. at least let the user hide/rename the \"Priority\" field to - for example - Urgency and add the Importance field.",

The integrity checker reports errors regarding the Workflow integrity, but the Integrity Checker corrects the errors by itself.\n\nMy questions: \n\n1. Are there any problems in this procedure. Do i miss something?\n\n2. When creating new issues, i cant get the pcounter to be correct. If my last imported issue has no. 1000 and i don't have an issue with no. 1, then the new issue that is created from scratch in JIRA is created with no. 1 instead of 1001. I've tried to update the pcounter field in the project table, but this does not solve the problem. Could you point out where the attribute is set.\n\n3. Do i have to update some of the values manually in then SEQUENCE_VALUE_ITEM table after the import? How is this table used?\n\nThanks for your help.",

What is missing is a means to (re)assign the issue automatically.\r\n\r\nConsider the workflow we need in our organisation:\r\n\r\n1) Create Issue\r\n2) Open\r\n3) Resolve (Incomplete)\r\n   - Assign To Reporter\r\n4) Reopen Issue / Clarified\r\n   - Assign to Original Assignee / Assign Automatic\r\n5) Open\r\n....\r\n\r\nThe issue is opened normally. In step 3 the assignee discovers that the issue is incomplete, and Resolves the bug as Inclomplete. Now, the Post Function 'Assign to Reporter' takes care of assigning the bug to the reporter. The Reporter should now be able to add information that will make the issue complete, and Reopen the bug (or use some custom WF action, e.g. 'Clarified'). This should assign the issue to the orginal assignee automatically (throug a Post Function).\r\n\r\nThe reason this functionality is needed is that we do not want to give all reporters full assign rights, but want to be able to return an issue to a reporter.\r\n\r\nA new Post Function should be implemented that is equivalent to the Automatic assign that is used when an issue is created, or a fucntion that assigns it to the previous assignee (the one that sent it back to the reporter, in our example)",

Your feedback is key to helping us understand how you use JIRA so we can continue improving your experience. We have reviewed this issue over the last few days.\r\n\r\nWe've made the decision to close this request, as we do not reasonably expect to implement it in any future iteration of JIRA. Adding another event that triggers an email notification adds more complexity to JIRA's notification system. The existing options for notifying a user about an issue (using the Share button or @mentioning them in a comment) are sufficient in most cases and leverage existing patterns.\r\n \r\nI understand that our decision may be disappointing. Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.\r\n \r\nRegards,\r\nDave Meyer\r\ndmeyer@atlassian.com\r\nProduct Manager, JIRA Platform\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\nAdding (or removing?) a user from a watchers list should cause an email notification to that user.\r\n\r\nThis feature is especially desirable due to the absence of the feature requested in JRA-5493 as you need to add watchers after an issue has been created.

In fact, the user in this case had just modified the field in question and was expecting the report to NOT show the issues that were just changed.  The re-index function was run to see if that would fix the problem - it did.  The report was now correct.  How and when do indexes get corrupted?  When should the re-index function be run?  How can we know if it is corrupted?  Is this a Jira problem or a database problem (mySQL in this case)? If so, is it recommended to use another database (PostgreSQL for instance)? Can re-indexing be forced at certain times automatically?  At startup?  Thanks for your help.",

Your input in the comments helps us understand how this affects you and what you're hoping to accomplish with JIRA.\r\n\r\nAt this time, this suggestion is not on the JIRA development roadmap. Please remember that jira.atlassian.com is one of many inputs for the JIRA roadmap. You can [learn more about our process here|https://community.atlassian.com/t5/Jira-questions/How-does-the-JIRA-team-use-jira-atlassian-com/qaq-p/475688].\r\n\r\nI understand that our decision may be disappointing. Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nDave Meyer\r\n[dmeyer@atlassian.com|mailto:dmeyer@atlassian.com]\r\nProduct Manager, JIRA Platform\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\nNow that issue JRA-3454 is finally fixed, there's something missing from it:\r\nThe sort order reverts to the default \"from first to last\" everytime the session ends (i.e. the browser closes or you log in from another computer).\r\n\r\nThis is intuitive and since users wanting this feature usually want the sort order to stay the way they have set it (\"from last to first\"), I believe this to be a bug, but am marking it as an 'Improvement' anyway.\r\n\r\nSort order should be stored in some kind of per-user preference.",
