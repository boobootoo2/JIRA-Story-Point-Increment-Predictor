If you add an autorelease\u00a0pool to the interior of the loop, then the pipes and file descriptors are\u00a0cleaned up before the next iteration of the loop.\r\n\u00a0\r\nWhat does this mean for you, you might ask. From Apple's point of view the behaviour is correct and this was confirmed by multiple teams and it resulted in that the radar was closed back in 2013. Since the developer simply blames it on Apple, and Apple said it that what the developer claims as the issue works as intended.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nSo my advice would be to once again reach out to your developer and ask them to reach out to our\u00a0Developer Technical Support team\u00a0for proper code level support.
