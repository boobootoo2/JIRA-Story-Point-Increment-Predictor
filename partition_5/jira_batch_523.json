Summary\r\n\r\nJIRA\u00a0is not checking if an incoming email has an empty/missing\u00a0_MESSAGE-ID_ since this is an edge case that should never happen (by definition\u00a0each email should have a _MESSAGE-ID_ that is the unique identifier for that email).\r\n\r\nHowever, we have seen this happening and this caused issues in case a user replies to his own email having Jira in CC. In this case indeed an email with an empty _IN-REPLY-TO_\u00a0header is created and, in case this email has no issue key in the subject, instead of creating a new issue it will be added as a comment to whatever issue ever received a comment added from an email with no _MESSAGE-ID_\r\n\r\nh3. Environment\r\nThis issue happened in\u00a0JIRA Service Desk Cloud, but the class handling this if from\u00a0JIRA Core\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Somehow send an email with no message-id to JIRA, see that this will create a new issue without any problem (no errors returned)\r\n# With a different user (e.g. USER B) send an email to some other user (USERS C and D)\u00a0 and JIRA in CC\u00a0(no issue key in the subject)\r\n# As one of the other users, e.g. USER D, reply to the email from previous step leaving Jira in CC (so, still no issue key in the subject)\r\n# Still as USER D, reply to your own email from previous step. This will generate an email still having Jira in CC and no issue key in the subject. Also, in some cases this email will have an empty _IN-REPLY-TO_\u00a0header as the below one:\r\n{noformat}\r\nFrom: USER B\r\nTo: JIRA\r\nReferences: <the MESSAGE-ID of the first email of the thread is in here> \r\nIn-Reply-To: \r\nSubject: RE: test \r\n{noformat}\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n# The email with empty _MESSAGE-ID_ should be discarded and an error returned by JIRA. \r\n# The email with empty _IN-REPLY-TO_ either creates a new ticket, or adds a comment to the issue that matches the _MESSAGE-ID_ in the _REFERENCES_ header\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n# The email with empty _MESSAGE-ID_ creates a new issue and the empty _MESSAGE-ID_ is stored in JIRA DB.\r\n# The email with empty _IN-REPLY-TO_  adds a comment to the issue created from the email in previous step.\r\n\r\n\r\nh3.Workaround\r\nNone at the moment. However, again, this should never happen but as written in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message-ID:\r\n{quote}\r\nMessage-IDs are required to have a specific format which is a subset of an email address[2] and to be globally unique. That is, no two different messages must ever have the same Message-ID. A common technique used by many message systems is to use a time and date stamp along with the local host's domain name, e.g., 950124.162336@example.com.[3] On the other hand, if two messages have the same Message-ID, they are presumed to be the same one and one version is discarded. But, as Google MTAs (message transfer agents) mangle the ones of Outlook, several same messages may coexist with original and mangled ones and create problems in referencing each other for threading \r\n{quote}",

Environment\r\nJira Service Desk Cloud\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\nFirst choose which issuetype you will want to create in the automation rule:\r\n # In the project settings, go to *Fields* and edit the field configuration related to the issuetype you have chosen:\r\n   ** Make one or more fields required, in this examples, I've tested with *Priority* and *Component/s*.\r\n # In the project settings again, search for the screen scheme related to the issuetype you have chosen:\r\n   ** Remove those two fields from the create screen (Priority and Component/s).\r\n # In the project settings, go to *Automation*:\r\n   ** I've created the following as example: WHEN: Issue Created | IF: Issue matches -> type = Incident | THEN: Create Issue -> make sure you select the issuetype you've been editing the configurations related to it in the creation screen that pops up;\r\n   ** Open the inspect in your browser (I'm using Chrome).
