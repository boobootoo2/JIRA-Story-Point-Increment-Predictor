The template type does not provide a list of _com.atlassian.jira.mail.TemplateIssue_ objects resulting in severe limitations on available data. This makes it extremely challenging to support the hundreds of Blackberry users we have a Electronic Arts.\r\n\r\nThe issue with Blackberry support is the email client converts HTML messages to TEXT leaving an unreadable message if it contains tables or URL's. Table structures are removed and replaced with space delimited fields and URL's are presented in place in full, no matter how long and unreadable they are on the tiny screen. None of the HTML templates are readable on a blackberry device, and the TEXT templates only tell you the absolute bare minimum about each issue.\r\n\r\nThe documentation at [http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/JIRA+3.6+-+Velocity+Context+for+Email+Templates] does not mention the collection variable $issues, and the items it contains do not appear to be the _com.atlassian.jira.mail.TemplateIssue_ data type.\r\n\\\\\r\n\\\\\r\nTake a look at the following template.\r\n\\\\\r\n{noformat}\\atlassian-jira\\WEB-INF\\classes\\templates\\email\\text\\includes\\issuesummary.vm{noformat}\r\n\\\\\r\nIt contains statements such as\r\n\\\\\r\n{code}$issue.getNiceTimeEstimate($i18n){code}\r\n\\\\\r\nThe $issue variable is part of the velocity context in a similar way the collection $issues is part of the context in the following template.\r\n\\\\\r\n{noformat}\\atlassian-jira\\WEB-INF\\classes\\templates\\email\\text\\filtersubscription.vm{noformat}\r\n\\\\\r\nIt seems logical the following code should work in the filtersubscription.vm template right?\r\n\\\\\r\n{code}#foreach ($issue in $issues)\r\n[$issue.getKey()] Time Estimate: $issue.getNiceTimeEstimate($i18n)\r\n#end{code}\r\n\\\\\r\nAll you get is\r\n\\\\\r\n{noformat}\r\n[SM-7] Time Estimate: $issue.getNiceTimeEstimate($i18n) \r\n[SM-6] Time Estimate: $issue.getNiceTimeEstimate($i18n) \r\n[SM-5] Time Estimate: $issue.getNiceTimeEstimate($i18n) \r\n[SM-4] Time Estimate: $issue.getNiceTimeEstimate($i18n) \r\n[SM-3] Time Estimate: $issue.getNiceTimeEstimate($i18n) \r\n[SM-2] Time Estimate: $issue.getNiceTimeEstimate($i18n) \r\n[SM-1] Time Estimate: $issue.getNiceTimeEstimate($i18n)\r\n{noformat}\r\n\\\\\r\nIt would seem the logic is not the same between the two template types, and the source code proves that in _\\jira\\src\\java\\com\\atlassian\\jira\\mail\\SubscriptionMailQueueItem.java_ line 303.\r\n\r\n{code}\r\n. . .\r\nSearchResults results = searcher.search(sr, u, PagerFilter.getUnlimitedFilter());\r\nList issues = results.getIssues();\r\n. . . \r\nActionContext.setContext(oldCtx);\r\ncontextParams.put(\"baseHREF\", getBaseURLWithoutContext(baseURL));\r\ncontextParams.put(\"issueTableHtml\", issueTableHtml);\r\ncontextParams.put(\"issues\", issues);   \r\ncontextParams.put(\"constantsManager\", ManagerFactory.getConstantsManager());\r\ncontextParams.put(\"userManager\", UserManager.getInstance());\r\ncontextParams.put(\"user\", u);\r\n{code}\r\n\\\\\r\nThe $issues collection is a collection of _com.atlassian.jira.issue.Issue_ rather than _com.atlassian.jira.mail.TemplateIssue_ which has the handy formating the *documentation alludes too*.\r\n\\\\\r\n\\\\\r\n\\\\\r\n\r\n",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-15181].\n  {panel}\n\nAs an example the reporter field may require a value during the bulk issue operation. The reason why the reporter field needs a value is that this field is required. When you check the retain option, the reporters are retained where possible. Depending on your configuration this may not be the case for all issues being moved. For those issue a new (reporter) value needs to be set and that's why the reporter field needs a value set.\r\n\r\nJIRA could be a bit smarter & user-friendlier and not require a value in the case when all issues will be able to retain the original reporter. It could also inform the user that if the value is entered and _retain_ option is checked, it will only replace or set the reporter value for the issues that will require it. It would seem that at the moment the current message does not give enough confidence to the users, they fear that all values will be replaced.\r\n\r\nPlease see linked JRA-14385 for more details about the origin of this issue.",

This makes it seem like the comment will be a revision history comment, to be shown in the 'Change History' tab on the issue.\r\n\r\nInstead, comments which are made when you update an issue show up as normal comments. This looks a bit odd, when you consider that you end up with a comment stream like this:\r\n\r\n* Issue description: \"This is a bug\"\r\n* Comment #1: \"I'd really like this bug to be fixed. You can reproduce it by doing steps 1, 2, 3.\"\r\n* Comment #2: \"Updating affects version\"\r\n* Comment #3: \"This bug is really annoying. Is it currently scheduled to be fixed?\"\r\n* Comment #4: \"Increasing priority of bug\"\r\n\r\nThere's no distinction here between comments #1 and #3 which refer to the problem, and #2 and #4 which refer to changes in the issue. Comments #2 and #4 don't actually show the change that happened when the user commented -- you have to switch to the Change History tab for this.\r\n\r\nSo this view kind of mixes up change comments with comments about the issue itself. I think you should consider making one of two changes:\r\n\r\n- making change comments show up on the Change History tab, but not the Comments tab; or\r\n- removing the comment field from the edit issue screen and the workflow screens where it doesn't fit.\r\n\r\nThere might be a better solution I haven't thought of, however.",

      "description": "When configuring JIRA to create issues based on incoming emails, if an email contains an attachment that is itself an email (usually with \".eml\" extension and content-type \"message/rfc822\"), this attachment will be dropped and not attached to the resultant issue. Here is an example of headers possibly encountered:\r\n{noformat}------=_NextPart_000_0017_01C759BA.AD6C8D30\r\nContent-Type: message/rfc822\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\r\nContent-Disposition: attachment{noformat}\r\n\r\nThis was done because in some mail clients, when a user replies to a message thread, the mail client can be set to include the previously sent message(s) from that thread as an attachment. So, to avoid attaching unnecessary messages to JIRA issues, these attachments are dropped. However, this hinders the other main use case, that is, when users are forwarding an arbitrary email as an attachment as part of a new email which is to be picked up by JIRA.\r\n\r\nThere are also reported problems when doing similar attaching using Thunderbird. Under certain situations, Thunderbird will set the content type of the attached message to \"application/octet-stream\". If the attached message happens to have a long name, such that the name is split up over multiple header lines, as dictated by [RFC 2231|http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2231.html], this will cause the attached message to be dropped. Here is an example of possible headers:\r\n{noformat}--------------030108010505010604040402\r\nContent-Type: application/octet-stream;\r\n name*0=\"SUPPORT+Updated+(JSP-9445)+get+warning+message+when+issue+is+cre\";\r\n name*1=\"ated+from+e-mail+attachment+not+added.msg\"\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: base64\r\nContent-Disposition: attachment;\r\n filename*0=\"SUPPORT+Updated+(JSP-9445)+get+warning+message+when+issue+is\";\r\n filename*1=\"+created+from+e-mail+attachment+not+added.msg\"{noformat}\r\n\r\nThis is due to JavaMail not being able to parse the filename correctly (JIRA will not attach an attachment with a null filename).",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-15128].\n  {panel}\n\nThis issue just jammed me up and I think it's a terrible UI design to include the \"Screens\" operation under \"View Field Configuration\" when that operation applies to ALL field configurations across all schemes without any warning.  We're using the Enterprise Edition and setup a number of unique projects and configurations and I was shocked to find out that in the process of removing screens from one of my configurations that I had copied that I disabled functionality in my other projects.\r\n\r\nIn my example I had the following setup:\r\n------------\r\nField Configuration Schemes:\r\n\t- Issue Reporting 1 --> Project 1\r\n\t- Issue Reporting 2 --> Project 2\r\n\r\nField Configuration:\r\n\t- Issue Screen 1\r\n\t- Issue Screen 2\r\n\r\nScreens:\r\n\t- Enter Issue 1 --> Project 1\r\n\t- Assign Issue 1 --> Project 1\r\n\t- Enter Issue 2 --> Project 2\r\n\t- Assign Issue 2 --> Project 2\r\n\r\nField Configuration Issue Screen 1:\r\n\t- Assignee -->\r\n\t\t- Enter Issue 1\r\n\t\t- Assign Issue 1\r\n\t\t- Enter Issue 2\r\n\t\t- Assign Issue 2\r\n\r\n\t- Description -->\r\n\t\t- Enter Issue 1\r\n\t\t- Assign Issue 1\r\n\t\t- Enter Issue 2\r\n\t\t- Assign Issue 2\r\n\r\nField Configuration Issue Screen 2 (copied of Issue Screen 1):\r\n\t- Assignee -->\r\n\t\t- Enter Issue 1\r\n\t\t- Assign Issue 1\r\n\t\t- Enter Issue 2\r\n\t\t- Assign Issue 2\r\n\r\n\t- Description -->\r\n\t\t- Enter Issue 1\r\n\t\t- Assign Issue 1\r\n\t\t- Enter Issue 2\r\n\t\t- Assign Issue 2\t\t\r\n------------\r\n\r\nI then went and removed the Assignee and Description from the \"Enter Issue 1\" and \"Assign Issue 1\" screens in \"Field Configuration Issue Screen 2\" and ended up losing all those fields in \"Project 1\" which uses \"Enter Issue 1\" and \"Assign Issue 1\".  Had I seen some sort of warning in bold-red font that I was about to change ALL of my projects, or better yet -- if this action was not even permitted here, I would have never done this.  Putting a note in the documentation is not good enough, you need to have a warning in the UI because it's definitely not clear that you're changing all your projects..... why bother to have separate configuration areas if it's going to affect everything?

If a post function 'update issue field' is selected, (or possibly other functions which involve dropdown fields rather than user pickers) the rendered html source will include inline all dropdown options - eg. 600 projects x 1,000 users who are assignable to that project. This calculation loop can expend available memory and cause general system slowdown.\r\n\r\nSpecifically this happens when adding an 'Update Issue Field' post function in a workflow. The \"Assign to User\" field tries to build a list of all assignable users, however in this case there is no project context so it builds up a list of assignable users _per project_. If a user is assignable in multiple projects, they appear in the list multiple times.\r\n\r\nRecommendation: Change the dropdown to a user picker.",

      "description": "One of our customers (we set up and support their JIRA instance) noticed that their Excel exports from JIRA were not working properly.   They would go into Find Issues and then click the link to export the issue list to an Excel spreadsheet.   When I looked at the Excel spreadsheet, the URL for issue key was wrong.   It was http://127.0.0.1:8080/browse/AVIENH-180.     This is obviously incorrect... it should be http://tasks.aileron..net/browse/AVIENH-180.\r\n\r\nI suspected that this is related to the fact that these URLs are being generated using the incoming request URL and not the Base URL specified in the \"General Administration\" section.     To confirm, changed my Apache mod-proxy config to redirect the incoming requests to tasks.aileron.net:8080 (we run apache with mod_proxy sitting in front of our JIRA server).\r\n\r\nAfter I made this config change and bounced apache, I noticed that the spreadsheet now read:   http://tasks.aileron.net:8080/browse/AVIEN-180.   This is close (but doesn't really work for us since we do not allow direct connectivity to 8080).\r\n\r\nShouldn't JIRA be using the Base URL specified in General Configuration rather than try to use the URL from the incoming HTTP requests?
