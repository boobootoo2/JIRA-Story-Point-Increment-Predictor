      "description": "I was wondering if we can have different notification schemes for different components in a particular project or is it that a project  can have just one notification scheme associated with it. For eg: I have a project configured as follows:\r\n\r\nProject name: MYPROJECT\r\nComponents:  GeneralComponent\r\n                            DocumentationComponent\r\n                            InfrastructureComponent\r\n\r\nThe closest solution to this issue was to set a filter. However, it doesn't completely serve the purpose. The filter sends email after a predefined set period irrespective of whether a new issue in that component is created or not. I would like to have emails just when a new issue is created in that component and not after a pre defined period. Does someone have a solution to my problem.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nVenkat\r\n",

This way they can hide the not-so-common filter items. They requested if it is possible for the admin to set the default collapsed and expanded groups.\r\n\r\nJira does seem to save which groups are expanded/collapsed by an individual user, but by default all groups are expanded by default.

So I don't want to present the developers with the component if it doesn't really apply to work anymore.\r\n\r\nIt would be great if there was a mechanism to \"archive\" components just like you would with a release version, such that the user can no longer select that component for issues.",

Reporting against the Jiraissue table causes deferred defects to simply drop off of the face of the earth.  \r\n\r\nIt would be more convenient (and moderately more performant) to do these types of reports if a defect's complete lifecycle were captured in the changelog rather than everything that happened after the issue was originally entered.  Please note that this would need to apply to any kind of issue creation event (user created, import created, SOAP created, e-mail handler created).\r\n\r\nFor my purposes, all I really care about is capturing the creation event.
