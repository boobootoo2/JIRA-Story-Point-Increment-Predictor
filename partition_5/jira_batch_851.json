Fundamentally, the situation as reported on this suggestion is intended functionality. Sharing a filter or dashboard with \"Everyone\" is intended as a way to allow users who may not have accounts in your JIRA instance the ability to see certain dashboards or filters, assuming they contain issue data that has also been shared with anonymous users. There are a number of use cases for this and we know that many customers are using JIRA this way today.\r\n\r\nThat said, we are also very aware that the wording \"Everyone\" can cause significant confusion, where users do not realize the \"Everyone\" option means that the dashboard or filter will be visible to unauthenticated users. In certain situations, this can become a security concern. Therefore, we have recently introduced some changes in to mitigate this issue.\r\nh4. New global setting\r\n\r\nJIRA administrators can now disable the ability to share dashboards and filters publicly via a new global setting \"Public sharing\". This setting is available from JIRA Admin > System > General Configuration > Edit Settings. _Please note that this will not affect existing filters and dashboards. If you change this setting, you will still need to update existing filters and dashboards if they have already been shared with \"Everyone.\"_\r\n !Cursor_and_Edit_JIRA_Configuration_-_JIRA.png|thumbnail!\r\nh4. \"Everyone\" is now \"Public\"\r\n\r\nIn order to more clearly emphasize the outcome of sharing a dashboard or filter will allow unauthenticated users to see it, we have renamed the \"Everyone\" setting to \"Public\" and updated the wording in the UI to be more explicity.\r\nh4. New \"All logged-in users\" option\r\n\r\nWe know the intent of many users who selected the \"Everyone\" option previously was to share the filter with everyone in their organization. We've added a new option \"All logged-in users\" that is a more understandable way to share a dashboard or filter with _all users who have a JIRA account_.\r\nh4. Sharing options have been reordered\r\n\r\nIn order to reduce the likelihood that a user would accidentally choose the \"Everyone\"/\"Public\" option without understanding the consequences, we have reordered the sharing options so that \"Groups\" are the first sharing option in the dropdown menu.\r\n\r\n!Screen_Shot_2016-08-02_at_12_26_32_PM.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nThese changes were released to JIRA Cloud in August 2016 and in JIRA Server 7.2.2\u00a0to address the concerns laid out in this issue; therefore, we are going to mark it as resolved.\r\n\r\nThanks for your patience.\r\n\r\nDave Meyer\r\nSenior Product Manager, JIRA\r\n{panel}\r\nWe received complaints from one of our (external) customers saying that his name was found on the Internet via googling for his name. The hit was found via a JIRA-link on our internal JIRA-system.\r\nWhen investigating, we found that it was caused by the fact that he had shared filters with restriction \"Anyone\".\r\n\r\nThis is not a logical behaviour from JIRA: we don't allow anonymous access to our JIRA, so we assume that nothing is exposed to the Internet. People may for example put information in the title of the filter that should not be exposed to others. As an administrator we don't have the possibility to block this. We can't even change the filters created by others.\r\nThe best solution in my opinion, is to modify the \"Global Permission\":\r\n * Either create a new global permission called e.g. \"Browse Filters\" that an Administrator can use to block all filters.\r\n * Or use the JIRA-Users permissions to block such Filters.\r\n\r\nThis issue is related to -JRA-22207-, -JRA-17221-, but these requests do not completely reduce the risk.\r\nh4. Workaround\r\n - [How to Remove the 'Everyone' Share Option from Filters|https://confluence.atlassian.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=301663662]\r\n\r\n - Change all the \"Shared with the public\" filters to \"Shared with logged-in users\"(Jira version 7.2+):\r\n\r\n # (!) Create an XML backup of the instance.\r\n # Stop Jira.\r\n # Run the following query on the database:\r\n{code:sql}\r\nupdate sharepermissions set sharetype = 'loggedin' where sharetype = 'global' and entitytype = 'SearchRequest';\r\n{code}\r\n\r\n # Start Jira.\r\n\r\nTo update search results a re-index of Jira instance is also required.",

If the first LDAP goes down, the local admin can simply swap the order of the directories so that the \"slave\" directory has precendence.\r\n",

Set the *Issue Type* search criteria to *Bug*, *Task* *New Feature* (basically select Bug issue type combined with any other issue type(s) )\r\n2) Notice that the resulting table has the custom field column *A*\r\n(see \"Bug,New Feature & Task.PNG\")\r\n\r\nIn terms of JQL, when *issuetype in (...)* is used, the custom field column will appear. In contrast, when *issuetype in (...)* is not used (that is equivalent to using *Any* in simple search), then the custom field that is mapped to certain issue type(s) will never show.\r\n\r\nConclusion:\r\nWhether *Any* is used (as per first scenario), or whether combination of many Issue Types are selected in the search criteria (as per third scenario), the resulting table rows will include both: 1) issues of *types which are mapped with the custom field*, 2) as well as issues of *types which are not mapped with the custom field*. But the custom field column only shows in the latter case.\r\n\r\nIs this considered a bug?",

To workaround the issue, you have to remove the single quote within the zip file to succeed. \r\n\r\nThe error only happens with zip files - regular files with single quotes can be attached and viewed just fine, and also tar.gz files works as well.\r\n\r\nStrangely enough, this behaviour only happens on JIRA 4.2, and in the previous versions, it runs smoothly.\r\n\r\nBest Regards\r\nThiago Prisco\r\nAtlassian Support",

This cache is invalidated on various events, including \"Issue Updated\". When using a Post Function to set the remaining estimate to zero when resolving an issue, by default only an \"Issue Resolved\" event is fired, even if the data was changed.

So, for example, next to each table that I view, we could have a button that opens a dialog, which then lets me rename columns to my liking. This should be saved in the database only for the user that defined such mapping.\r\n\r\nI understand that most tables are displaying issues, and that the question of how to treat global columns (issue properties) would come up: the answer should be, apply globally (per user).\r\n\r\nAn example: if it bothers me that the column displaying a version number is too wide only because of its long name, I would rename it (by abbreviating); so, instead of \"Targeted Version\" I could have just \"Target\" or \"tgt-ver\", and I will then probably stopped being bothered by how wide that column is.\r\n\r\nAnother subfeature: while the user is renaming the column, allow them to force a line-break. So, for example, I might dislike abbreviated names, so instead of \"Targeted Version\", I'd like to force \"Targeted<br/>Version\" (syntax can be invented), and I'll be happier to see that column less wide (while the title row/bar would become taller).",
