Now click\u00a0*Resolve this issue*\u00a0and add a comment to complete this request.\".... there is no link to 'resolve this issue', only 2 other references to resolution on the screen and no further guide as to what is meant other than to add a comment and hope for the best.\r\n\r\nI'd have added a screenshot but it states \"JIRA could not attach the file as there was a missing token.

One finding was that people have difficulty navigating to the help they need, especially if they have access to more than one service desk.\r\n\r\nTo help people quickly navigate among service desks from any page, we added the search to the top right.\u00a0This change is the first part of bigger improvements based on these user studies. Our goal is to make it easier for people to get the help they need, and thus make it easier for your team to deflect and triage requests. Some upcoming changes include:\r\n * easier navigation across service desks and request types.\r\n * a better experience for people who only have access to one portal. They'll get the full help center experience, including front-and-center search, instead of landing in a service desk.\r\n * better browsing for knowledge base articles, so your team doesn't have to worry as much about keywords and labels.\r\n\r\nThank you again for all the feedback. We'll use your comments to iterate on designs and make sure you and your help seekers have the best experience possible.\u00a0 I will comment on this ticket soon with an in-depth preview of the upcoming improvements.\u00a0\r\n\r\nCheers,\u00a0\r\nVincent - Jira Service Desk team\r\n{panel}\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThis feature request has been created in order to get feedback on the new Search experience on the Customer Portal.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0",

Summary\r\n\r\nWhen multiple attachments are uploaded with the same name from the portal, whilst each individual image is saved to Jira itself, in the customer portal the customer see's duplicate attachments of the first image uploaded - after saving that is, the preview shows as intended. Also in the comments on the Jira side the same attachment repeats itself like in the portal. But if you go to the attachment field of the issue you can see the individual images. \r\n\r\nPresumably, because it looks for the image name, finds the first image with that name and re-uses the same image for each subsequent attachment. This is very confusing for customers who believe they uploaded the same image multiple times. This also makes it very difficult for the agent to know which attachments belong to which comment.\r\n\r\nYou notice this a lot when customers have to paste multiple screenshots into a ticket.\r\n\r\nSee attached screenshot from the portal. They are two separate images named 1.jpg but the customer see's a duplication of the first one.\r\n\r\nh3. Environment\r\nVertigo\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# From the customer portal upload multiple images with the same name\r\n# Notice the preview displays each individual image\r\n# Add the attachments\r\n# Now one attachment is repeatedly displayed for each image\r\n\r\nh3.

Summary\r\n\r\nIf you try to validate a *Date Time Picker*'s value from a portal request in the workflow (e.g. value must be <= now) it will generate conflicts with the user raising a request if the time zone in the computer is different from the default one in the instance.\r\n\r\nThe validator in the workflow will use the *now* value as the instance's date/time, but when you enter the portal to raise a request the *Date Time Picker* will get the value from your computer configuration (If you set a default value in the field configuration using the current date/time feature, it will show you the instance's current date and time. But once you go to the portal, the default value will be converted to your computer's date and time).\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\nh3.
