Current Situation\n\nWhen an image/attachments with the similar file name is being attached to a comment. The previous comment with inline image/attachments will be pointed to the latest updated image.\n\nh2. Use Case\n\nAt a support/helpdesk environment, user does not have control over the mail client that the customers use. Which in most of the case, image/attachments are pasted directly to the body of the mail. Causing the default file naming to be identical. \n\nThis has seriously crippled the usability of Service Desk as the old comments (with similar file name) no longer represents the state that it should be in. \n\nTo add to the pain, the incoming mail is being deleted upon creation. That removed the reference to track back and it causes confusion especially on a long running case where 4-5 inline image is added. They can only rely on the time recorded when the issue is added to reference it back.\n\nh2. Proposed Solution\n\nTo have the ability to configure the attachments to be appended with time stamp. There should be a toggle in project level so that user get to choose if this only applies to specific projects.\n\nAlso could consider wiki markup with a timestamp column, to place that information to point the attachment to the right one.",

The ticket will be created but the email address in CC field is ignored without any notification.\nCurrently JIRA can only create user account for new email address in CC field when public signup is enabled. However some customers do not want to expose the service desk project to every user (when public signup is enabled every user can have access to this project).\n\nh3. Suggested Solution\nAdd an option in JIRA so that when the public signup is disabled and an authorised user sends an email to create a ticket while CC a non-existing email address, a new user account should be created or a notification should be sent out to notify the sender.\nThe feature request [JSD-988|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSD-988] has been raised to notify the sender in this situation.",

Problem Definition\nAs an agent, I often need to reference different cases in my JIRA Service Desk issue to the customer. My general workflow is: \n# I have an 'original' issue with a customer, and want to link another.\n# Locate the issue though the JIRA issue navigator. \n# Identify the affected issue, open it up and get the customer portal URL. \n# Copy this link, and then paste this into the original issue.\n\nThis is is not a seamless experience for the agent. It would be easier to just copy the link from the issue navigator, and paste it in. \n\nh3. Suggested Solution\nIdeally, it would be good if JIRA just understood what permissions a user had and then direct the user accordingly if they are already logged in as a customer, but don't have JIRA access.\n\nh3. Workaround \nAs mentioned above additional steps to get the correct link. \nAnother workaround would involve using Text Expansion software that can automatically convert text in one format to another based on a script.",

Apply a label on the current issue that isn't on any Confluence page of the KB space, \"unexisting-label\" for example\n\nh3. Expected results\nJIRA issue labels shouldn't affect the Confluence pages returned in the KB panel, so applying any labels shouldn't affect the related articles list there (indeed, labels configured in the \"Auto-search on request forms\" section of the KB settings page should only restrict Confluence page search using the configured labels in the customer portal on request type form pages KB suggestions (and filtering out pages not having the configured labels) and nowhere else)\n\nh3. Actual results\nThe JIRA issue labels are used in the KB search and make the panel related articles list being empty, same for the the KB panel search feature.\n\nh3. Workaround\nTemporarily removing issue labels filtering out expected Confluence pages result should fix KB panel search.",

Then at some point down the line their email address changes or they have multiple emails pointing to the same inbox.\n\nThen, when we add a comment and they are notified, the notification goes to their original email (which they get), but when they respond, their email client sends the response using their new email address. When this happens Jira Service Desk create a new separate case.\n\nIt's difficult for us to track all the cases and comments and it's difficult for our customer to understand that they now have multiple Service Desk accounts and their issues are spread across the two.\n\nWhat can be done about this?

It will be desirable to have this feature implemented for both JEPP and JIRA Mail Handler, hence the creation of this feature request ticket.\n\nh2. Current Situation\n\nWhen an image/attachments with the similar file name is being attached to a comment. The previous comment with inline image/attachments will be pointed to the latest updated image.\n\nh2. Use Case\n\nAt a support/helpdesk environment, user does not have control over the mail client that the customers use. Which in most of the case, image/attachments are pasted directly to the body of the mail. Causing the default file naming to be identical. \n\nThis has seriously crippled the usability of JIRA as the old comments (with similar file name) no longer represents the state that it should be in. \n\nTo add to the pain, the incoming mail is being deleted upon creation. That removed the reference to track back and it causes confusion especially on a long running case where 4-5 inline image is added. They can only rely on the time recorded when the issue is added to reference it back.\n\nh2. Proposed Solution\n\nTo have the ability to configure the attachments to be appended with time stamp. There should be a toggle in project level so that user get to choose if this only applies to specific projects.",

Many Atlassian customers use the max of their licensed agents for normal daily work.  When a JIRA System Administrator is called in to help the team with Service Desk configuration or troubleshooting, that sysadmin does not have the proper permissions to assist the team.  There are also no Agent licenses available for the System Administrator to use (albeit temporarily) to assist the team either.  It would be great if those users with the global permission of System Administrator could configure a Service Desk, without consuming an Agent license.  \n\nThis is meant to be for troubleshooting purposes, or system problems which need to be worked quickly, and having the ability will help the sysadmin work the issue without worrying about lack of permissions.

For this to work, we do need the following information, which we are currently grabbing from private API's. This lead to some problems for cloud systems recently, so it'd be great if you could add this to the official API.\n\nWhat we use:\n- Groups of the RequestTypes. This is not exposed via the offical API yet. We currently use:\n/rest/servicedesk/1/servicedesk/<portalKey>/request-types (recently broke, throws 404)\n/rest/servicedesk/1/servicedesk/<portalKey>/groups\n/rest/servicedesk/1/servicedesk/<portalKey/groups/<groupId>/request-types\n\nIn addition to the groups, which are not exposed via the official call, the assigned issue type is also missing (which we need to render our form). Would be great if these two things could be added here:\n/rest/servicedeskapi/servicedesk/<serviceDeskId>/requesttype\n\nThanks!",

Summary\nWhen the Application link between JIRA Service Desk and Confluence is configured to use OAuth (without impersonation) it makes all requests anonymously. This causes problems when creating an article from the panel (as well as from the \"Create KB Article\" button on older server versions of JIRA Service Desk).\n\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\n# Link a JIRA Service Desk instance with a Confluence instance and configure the link to use OAuth (without impersonation).\n# Create a Service Desk project\n# Create a link under Project Settings > Knowledge Base to a space on the Confluence instance in step 1\n# Go to the issue view for any issue in the project\n# Click the \"create an article\" link from the KB Panel or the \"Create KB Article\" button to open the dialog.\n# Fill in the form and click \"Create\"\n\nh3. Expected Results\nThe user is taken to the Confluence editor to create a page.\n\nh3. Actual Results\nThere is a 404 error and the page shows \"Page not found\".\n\nh3. Workaround\nCreate the page in the space directly from Confluence using the Create button in the header.\n\nh3. Notes\nIf the user happens to be logged and already have a draft open then they will see the editor when clicking \"Create\".

[See the corresponding bug report|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSDSERVER-4060].\n  {panel}\n\nh3. Problem Definition\n\nIn a JIRA Service Desk, whenever an End-User submits a Request within an instance\u2019s Customer Portal, if they miss a required field in the form, the error may not be visible on the screen.\n\nFor example, if I\u2019m creating a new Request in someone\u2019s Customer Portal, and I forget to fill in a Required field that isn\u2019t visible in my window anymore, there isn\u2019t any direct prompt that would warn me of the error. Unless I scroll back up and notice the error underneath the field itself, the Request page just looks like it lagged out and isn\u2019t accepting the request.\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\n # Create request type with multiple fields, mark only the summary field required.\n # To make the form long, add field help with line breaks. The following repeated over and over will make the form long:\n ** \n{noformat}\n \\\\test \\\\test \\\\test \\\\test \\\\test \\\\test  \n\n\n{noformat}\n\n # Create request in portal. Leave summary empty and scroll to where summary is no longer visible.\n # Attempt to submit request using create button\n ** Notice the form jumps slightly the first time you click create. This is the error appearing higher in the page. The error does not become visible on the screen.\n ** Clicking the create button again does nothing. The button itself appears to respond as it flashes when clicked. Nothing else happens.\n\nh3. Expected Behavior\n\nError becomes immediately visible to customer so that they are aware that an error was encountered.\nh3. Proposed Solutions:\n * List of the errors near the Create button\n * Help message next to the Create button, for example \"Errors above! Scroll up, fix, and try submitting again\"\n * Auto-Focus the window to the closest Error.\n * If multiple errors, auto focus or auto scroll to top-most error. The user would need to scroll down to create and would encounter the other errors that need to be fixed.",

Summary\nThis feature *Include the linked issue's details* inside automation rules is not working properly. When a customer executes a transaction like \u2018resolving\u2019 an issue, the automation rule should add a comment to a linked issue. It does that but it adds a comment with wrong status.\n\nHere is an example of that happens:\n\nIssue \u2018resolved\u2019:\n\n!Screen 1.png|thumbnail! \n\nIssue \u2018comment\u2019 with wrong status:\n\n!Screen 2.png|thumbnail! \n\nh3. Environment\nJira version - 1000.110.0\n\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\n# Create a issue.\n# Link this issue to another one.\n# Resolve one of this issues. (Add a resolution)\n# See the comment added.\n\nh3. Expected Results\n\nFollowing the example above, it should be: JSD-48 RESOLVED \"2\" has been changed to a status of *Resolved* and it is actually returning JSD-48 RESOLVED \"2\" has been changed to a status of *Waiting for customer*.\n\nh3. Actual Results\n\nJSD-48 RESOLVED \"2\" has been changed to a status of Waiting for customer has been changed to a status of *Waiting for customer*.\n\nh3. Notes\nI was able to re-produce it in two other instances (dog-foods).

They could add a condition to the transition so that only a certain user or group can transition the request to waiting for dev. Then they create an automation rule that automatically transitions the service desk request into waiting for dev as soon as the dev.\n * For example the agent may use the \"Create Linked Issue\" menu option to create the linked issue directly from the JIRA Service Desk request. \n\nh3.
