Steps to reproduce\n\n# Create a project and a few issues\n# Close some of the issues (but not all)\n# Enable Service Desk for that project\n# Check the closed issues, there will not be any SLA there.\n\nAn example :\n\nThe project PNS has 5 issues :\n\n!SDS1.png|thumbnail!\n\nWhen searching for {noformat}project = PNS and \"Time to resolution\" = breached(){noformat}\nthe results contains 1 issue :\n\n!SDS2.png|thumbnail!\n\nWhen searching for {noformat}project = PNS and \"Time to resolution\" != breached(){noformat}\nthe results contains 3 issues :\n\n!SDS4.png|thumbnail!\n\nThere is one more issue missing, and that issue was actually closed before Service Desk was enabled for this project. As such, the results from the two queries does not add up to the total amount of issues contained in the project.\n\nh3. Additional Info\n\n* Although the closed issues will not have any SLA, the issues that are not closed yet will have SLA\n* If the closed issues are re-opened, then SLA will be enabled for it.

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSDSERVER-299].\n  {panel}\n\nh3. Summary\nI agree with the design decisions to make SLA a project level concept, rather then using Schemes after using the system a bit, but think there is still the need for some polish for teams that may have a single JIRA project, for both customer facing intake and backend development. (i.e. Stories and Epics along with Bugs and Support).\n\nSome tickets are just not driven by SLA. We don't track \"first response\" on developer driven stories. It does not make any sense to see SLA clocks and fields on our User Stories, Epics, or technical tasks. Those timelines are all driven by a separate queuing, priority and intake process (scrum, etc), and make the SLA Reporting of the service desk inaccurate.\n\n\nh3. Proposed Changes \n\nh3. The Bullets\n\n\n* SLAs are the global concept, not the measure (/) <-- I like this, makes perfect sense\n* The use of a Scheme, or selection of issue types might encourage bad patterns (duplicate SLA concepts) (/)\n* Goal's JQL are the only means to decide if an SLA is tracked or excluded for particular issue types (!)\n** I dislike the default \"All Remaining Issues\" Goal, and think that should be eliminated. OR\n** I think this is where a logical split between SLAs and Goals should be applied.\n\n\n# SLAs should have categories/buckets/groupings\n# Categories assign issue type\n# Unassigned types ignored (A info box can call out untracked types as a warning in case of oversight)\n# Each category has the same \"Goals\" functionality seen today.\n\n\n *Teams using a single project for both agile development and service desk should be supported*\n\nh4. Sample Structure\n{noformat}SLA - Time to Respond\n | - Category\n |    | - issues types  (Engagements, Coaching)\n |    ` - Goals (24 hours)\n | - Category\n |    | - issues types  (Incident)\n |    ` - Goals (2 hours blocker, 4 hours crtical, 8 for the rest)\n | - Category 2\n |    | - issues types (Support Request)\n      ` Goals (8 hours Critical, 16 hours all else)\n{noformat}\n\nh4. Narrative\n\nEach SLA (time to response) will have a series of groups that break up the nature of service desk work.  In my example this breaks up the work by the nature.  \n* Engagements are large efforts, and require considerable up-front analysis. First response should always include a checklist of missing items.\n* Incidents are critical issues a customer is facing, and may be blocking work.  This takes priority over engagements, and require much faster response, even if just \"We know!, we're working on it!\"\n* Support fall somewhere in the middle.\nThere is also an implicit concept here.  User Stories and Epics by not being explicitly included, are excluded. These tickets are not tracked at all, as it makes no sense to track \"first response\" on developer driven stories.\n\nSo when creating or editing an SLA I should see a section of expandable headings (impl. details I dont care about) for each category of work.\n\nFor each category defined (or I add) I should pick a mutually exclusive list of issue types not already chosen by another category.  Any issueTypes not explicity applied to a category will be ignored.  (the system could create 1 new default category for each SLA containing all issue types for the project, and there is no loss of today's current status)\n\n\nI should be able to define within those categories of work, the levels of service (Goal). This is where JQL makes sense to evaluate the priority, reporter, market, or whatever else.\n\n----\n\nThe only work-around I see meanwhile is to leave the default SLA Goal empty, or set to \"0\" one existing ones, and then define new goals (actual goals), including issue type, priority, etc, as well as a new catch-all goal that still includes issue type, but nothing else.\n!https://confluence.atlassian.com/download/attachments/408453925/Example1.png|width=400! but as I note this is a big PITA for a desk with multiple buckets of work and goals within those.\n\n\n\n\n",

This is good for categorising tasks based on various use-cases, such as Geographical Distribution of Employees, or to highlight issues that need the most amount of attention. \n\nCreating many queues causes a long list to form, which is may be difficult to navigate under some circumstances.\n\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\nIn a JIRA Service Desk:\n# Make many queues as per: [Make queues for your service desk teams|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/SERVICEDESK/Make+queues+for+your+service+desk+teams] \n# Observe that as the list gets longer, it is harder to navigate.\n\nh3. Expected Results\nA method to collapse, or arrange Service Desk queues in a logical fashion. \n\nh3. Actual Results\nNo method to arrange queues into sub-categories exists.\n\nh3. Workaround\nSome users have discovered by:\n# Clicking the *Queues* Tab\n# Create a *New Queue*\n# Using Unicode characters such as: \u21b3 {{U+2183}} in the name of the queue, meets their requirements.\n\nh3. Original Submitted Request:\n\nLike anything else, as soon as you have more than a handful of queues, having some method to group queues become important.\n\nThis is what we have right now in our SD implementation, but what we really want is to be able to group queues ( and probably reports too ). See attached.\n\nOur base scenario is that we are setting up a single Service Queue so we can have a single Customer Portal entry point, but we have multiple teams ( Systems Support, Software Support, Data, ... ) as service agents, and need to setup queues for them.\n\nWe also have multiple locations, and again want to offer a single entry point for our users, but share the backend so support teams can cover for remote locations ( which may or may not have local teams ). This could also be resolved if the customer portal was separated from the agent portal so they could be mixed and matched based on usage patterns ( one to one, many to one, one to many, ... )\n\n\n",

To find out more about this feature, check out our blog post and documentations\u00a0[here|https://confluence.atlassian.com/servicedeskcloud/blog/2016/09/group-customers-in-organizations].\n\nThis feature will also be available for Server in a future major server release.\n\nOn top of this we have also built public APIs so you can easily extend our feature to support your various usecases! Check out our API docs [here|https://docs.atlassian.com/jira-servicedesk/REST/cloud/#servicedeskapi/organization].\n\nOn behalf of the JSD team I want to thank all of you for contributing to this ticket. Your comments, feedback and interviews have all formed the feature we release today.\n\n\u2014 JIRA Service Desk Team\n{panel}\n\u00a0\n{panel:title=Update as of 15 Sep 2016}\nHi all,\n\nWe are at the tail end of the development process for this feature. We are currently performing final testing as this feature touches on many sensitive parts of our products relating to permissions and security model.\n\nWe also want to thank all of you who have joined us for the usability test, your feedback was very valuable and we have made a number of changes to the feature based on the feedback.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, this feature will be available to both Cloud and Server and will be available on Cloud first before Server as there are far less\u00a0permutations to test and QA on our Cloud infrastructure.\n\nThank you all again for your patience.\n\n\u2014 JIRA Service Desk Team\n{panel}\n\u00a0\n{panel:title=Update as of 21 Jul 2016}\nHi all,\n\nWe do have a very vibrant marketplace which our expert partners develop add-ons that extend our products. [Collection Issue View for Service Desk|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/net.seibertmedia.jira.plugins.collective-issue-view/server/overview] and [Teams for JIRA Service Desk|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/eu.prepend.jira.servicedesk-teams/server/overview] are both add-ons which aim to provide customer grouping capabilities for JSD Server. If you are on JSD Server you can evaluate these options and choose to purchase them if they meet your needs.\n\nAs mentioned before this feature is one of our highest priorities and the JIRA Service Desk team is actively developing this capability. We are building it as a core part of the product, so there will not be any additional cost for this capability - and we are building it for both Server and Cloud.\n\nUnfortunately the development of this feature is taking considerable time as the security model for users in Cloud is very different to Server. It also fundamentally changes the way our product works so we want to ensure we get it right.\n\nIf you are interested to see how the feature is progressing feel free to [leave your details|https://jsd-beta.typeform.com/to/TUqws8] to join one of our upcoming usability test and provide us feedback on the feature itself.\n\nThank you all again for your patience.\n\n\u2014 JIRA Service Desk Team\n{panel}\n\u00a0\n{panel:title=Update as of 27 Jun 2016}\nHi all,\n\nThis is one of our highest priorities and we have the best team working on the feature.\n\nThis feature fundamentally changes the way our product work and we want to ensure we get it right. We have been actively reaching out to this community for usability testing on our latest development and design work on this feature. If you are keen to see where we are up to with the this feature, you can [leave your details here|https://jsd-beta.typeform.com/to/TUqws8] to join one of our upcoming usability test and provide us feedback on the feature itself.\n\nThank you all again for your patience.\n\n\u2014 JIRA Service Desk Team\n\n\u00a0\n{panel}\n{panel:title=Update as of 3 May 2016}\nHey all,\n\nWe understand many of you will need to make business decisions around when this feature is available, however we do not have a meaningful ETA we can share. As mentioned in my previous comment this is already in active development but there are quite a few number of moving parts to implementing this feature.\n\nWe will do our best to keep everyone updated with the latest development regarding this feature and to share our designs/progress once they become available. Right now we are in the process of bringing in groups into JIRA Service Desk (Ability to add groups to tickets, JQL search for groups etc) and also making enhancements to the group infrastructure (Allowing agents to be managing groups etc).\n\nAgain I want to stress this feature requires big changes to our underlying user management and permission infrastructure. Both of these aspects are fundamental to how you manage your users and the access control of the system, and we need to take the time to make sure we are doing it in the best possible way possible. Thank you again for all your continuous feedback and I will do my best to make progress updates as we go along. :)\n\n-JIRA Service Desk team\n{panel}",
