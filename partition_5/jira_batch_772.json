Aside from this, Linked Issues appears to be a core piece of functionality in Jira, therefore being able to apply this transition seems logical.\r\n\r\nFor Example:\r\n\r\nSupport-1 is relates by Issue-2, Issue-3, Issue-4.  I would expect to add a Condition on the Moving to \"Retest\" on Support-1 that will not allow it to move unless all Issues Linked with the \"relates to\" link are at \"Resolved\" or \"Closed\".  I then add a \"Transition Linked Issue\" Post Function to the Workflow of Issue-2,3,4 that will fire that Transition.\r\n\r\nThe use case is that the Support teams who are also using the Jira system will get a notification that they need to verify that the support ticket can be closed based on the new work.\r\n\r\nWe do have various other use-cases for this same functionality, in terms of getting round the fixed hierarchy of issue types (e.g. creating an Issue-type that groups \"Story\" issues together under an \"Epic\" in Greenhopper).",

Filtering for active and inactive users has been available in Atlassian Cloud for some time.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, JIRA Server does not share the same user management system and we have not been able to implement this feature in JIRA Server; however we will continue to consider it for the future.\r\n\r\nI understand that our decision may be disappointing. Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.\r\n \r\nRegards,\r\nDave Meyer\r\ndmeyer@atlassian.com\r\nProduct Manager, JIRA Platform\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\nAdd a filter option in the User Browser to filter specifically for inactive users",

In our case, this is usually any multiline text field such as Description or other custom field we've generated. It would be great if we could activate inline edit for this fields only when the Edit icon is clicked.
