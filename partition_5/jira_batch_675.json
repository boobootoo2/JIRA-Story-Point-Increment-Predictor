Workaround\r\n\r\nThere are several available workarounds for this issue, any of the below can be applied.\r\nh5. Multiple Upgrades\r\n # Upgrade to JIRA 6.3.15.\r\n # And then to JIRA 7.0.2.\r\nh5. XML Modification\r\n\r\nEdit the problematic cron expression(s) in the XML backup. This can be done with the below:\r\n # Locate the problematic cron expression by searching the {{entities.xml}}:\r\n # Identify which are problematic by reviewing the exception and corresponding that to the {{cronExpression}}. This only applies to elements belonging to {{QRTZCronTriggers}}.\r\n # Edit the expression, zip up the {{entities.xml}} and the {{activeobjects.xml}}.\r\n # Re-import.\r\nh5. Edit the Database\r\n\r\nAfter the upgrade task fails, and throws the above exception, the upgrade can no longer proceed. However you can edit the database and restart JIRA and it will pick up where it failed and proceed without error.\r\n # Stop JIRA.\r\n # Identify the problematic expression, using the exception error message as guidance.\r\n # And then update it, using the results from the SQL above.\r\n # Restart JIRA - the upgrade task will be attempted again, if the cron is a valid expression it will proceed successfully.\r\nh3. Notes\r\n\r\nIt looks like this occurs as the upgrade task {{UpgradeTask_Build70010}} only checks for the {{JQRTZCronTriggers}} entity, and not {{QRTZCronTriggers}} which is used in older versions.",

Summary\r\n\r\nIf JIRA is configured to synch with a LDAP engine that does not have a unique ID attribute, upon synchronisation it will clobber users, causing session hijacking.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n# Connect JIRA to an LDAP engine.\r\n# Ensure there are multiple users in the LDAP that have the same User Unique ID Attribute.\r\n# Synchronise the user directories.\r\n# Login as one user.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nThe synchronisation does not pass successfully and the admin is notified that there is a problem with the external user directory.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nUsers can become 'hijacked', as the {{app_user.user_key}} will change unexpectedly and different users will become other users that share the same unique ID. This can also cause some users to be orphaned and some sessions to log out.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nThe LDAP engine should not be configured to have a 'user unique ID attribute' that is not unique. This is documented in [RFC 2307|https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2307.txt].\r\n\r\nh3.

Workaround 1.  If there is no \"Caused by: java.lang.NullPointerException\" in the exception stack\r\nPlease check if there are forward proxy settings in JIRA (setenv.sh) and if they are set correctly. Please reference this article for further details on how to configure outbound proxy for JIRA: https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirakb/how-to-configure-an-outbound-http-and-https-proxy-for-jira-applications-247857187.html\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround 2. Please notice -- this applies to JIRA Software only. If there's JIRA Service Desk installed in the same instance as JIRA Software, the steps below will disable the Service Desk application\r\n\r\nDisabling the Analytics and the below add-ons will prevent this exception from being thrown. Please note it's a spurious exception that prevents analytics being thrown however will not affect how JIRA operates outside of sending analytics.\r\n\r\n* Atlassian JIRA - Plugins - Analytics whitelist\r\n* Analytics Client Plugin and\r\n* Analytics Whitelist Plugin",

Workaround\r\n\r\nUse [Limbr Reports for JIRA Cloud|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/limbr-reports/cloud/overview] for Cloud, [SumUp|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.atlassian.cps.sumUp] for Server or [export search results to excel|https://confluence.atlassian.com/jiracloud/exporting-search-results-to-microsoft-excel-735937195.html]",

Based on the statuses of sub-task the story status should reflect.\r\n4. At one point (after 3-4 sub tasks gets to closure) upon a transition at story level, it should create another issue type called Verification Task.\r\n5. At one point even that Verif Task reaches a state upon its status the story status should get changed and at this point need another issue type to be triggered.\r\n6. Finally based on the 2-3 step process this new issue type gets done and that's when the story finally should reach Done/closed state.\r\nPlease suggest the best way to configure this workflow. \r\nThanks for your time!\r\nRaghav",

Environment\r\nJIRA 7.0.0\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Set up an Environment with JIRA 7.0.0 (bug is reproducible on Microsoft SQL Server 11.0.2100). \r\n# Create an issue with a sub-task\r\n# Create a Work log on that issue\r\n# Delete the issue\r\n# At this point the Delete fails to respond. the logs will indicate an error: {{java.lang.RuntimeException: org.apache.catalina.connector.ClientAbortException: java.io.IOException: Broken pipe}}\r\n# Observe that the instance becomes unresponsive and you are unable to access some functions of JIRA as more and more threads get blocked.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n# When the issue is deleted, the instance should still be available to users.\r\n# http threads should not become blocked.\r\n# The removal of the targeted issue should occur.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n# JIRA becomes unresponsive.\r\n# Many threads become blocked, waiting on cache.\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Verification\r\n- Many threads will be WAITING similar to the following:\r\n{code}\r\n\"http-nio-2975-exec-24\" #126 daemon prio=5 tid=0x00007f4f18008000 nid=0x786e waiting on condition [0x00007f4f456dc000]\r\n   java.lang.Thread.State: WAITING (parking)\r\n        at sun.misc.Unsafe.park(Native Method)\r\n        - parking to wait for  <0x00000000fb514400> (a com.google.common.util.concurrent.AbstractFuture$Sync)\r\n{code}\r\n- Instance will be very unstable, not responding to requests. But some components may load OK, for example a dashboard\r\n- Potentially all HTTP threads eventually get stuck waiting and the instance dies. \r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround \r\n- Remove the [Delete issues permission|https://confluence.atlassian.com/jira/managing-project-permissions-185729636.html] from projects if you are using JIRA 7.0.X.\r\n- If you must provide for deleting issues and are testing JIRA 7 in a pre-production environment, roll back to a previous version of JIRA.\r\n",

Problem Definition\r\nCurrently JIRA sets the default timeout value to 10 seconds when configuring the Outgoing mail server. This is usually good enough for users, but it is known to be the cause for a very common problem with duplicated notifications as seen [here|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRAKB/Read+timed+out+error+when+sending+outbound+mail+from+JIRA+applications].\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\nIt would be better if the default timeout was set to 5 minutes since that is the value set by the [SMTP definition in the RFC docs|https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2821.txt] for timeouts.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround \r\nManually update the timeout value in JIRA's Outgoing mail configuration",

For example an issue is cloned and moved to another project, who will solve it, but someone else looks at the orginal issue and sees no links and decides to create another child issue in another project.\r\n\r\nAlso, from a data perspective, this behaviour is very wrong. The relationship between issues does not belong to either issue. A link belongs to both sides, So when looking at an object which the user has permissions to look at, the user can see all data in that object, outgoing links is part of that.

Summary\r\nWhen using Nested Sub Groups, with multiple directories, relationships between groups are only created for the first directory server listed under 'User Directories'\r\n\r\nIf you create a relationship between {{Grandparent Group}} and {{Child Group}} using the [Adding and Updating Group Memberships|https://confluence.atlassian.com/jira/managing-nested-groups-229838542.html#ManagingNestedGroups-AddingandUpdatingGroupMemberships] process, JIRA will record this relationship for what ever directory server is listed as the first directory server. This is OK if the user is authenticated against the first user directory but fails if the user is authenticated against the 1+nth directory. \r\n\r\nh3. Environment\r\nJIRA using multiple User Directories.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Create a JIRA instance with two directories. \r\n# Enable Nested local groups for all directory servers\r\n# Create group: {{Parent}} and {{Child}}\r\n# Create relationship (nested) between these groups\r\n# Add a user from first and second directory to Child group\r\n# Set up some Global permission for {{Parent}} group\r\n# One User will have permissions (from first directory) while other will not. \r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nWhen creating relationships between nested groups, they should be applied consistently across the entire environment.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nWhen creating the relationship, only one entry is recorded in the database between {{parent}} and {{child}}, in this example the internal directory was the top group.\r\n\r\n{code:SQL}\r\nselect id, membership_type, parent_name, child_name, directory_id from cwd_membership where parent_name = 'Parent Group';\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nThe results will be:\r\n{noformat}\r\n  id   | membership_type | parent_name  | child_name  | directory_id\r\n-------+-----------------+--------------+-------------+--------------\r\n 10117 | GROUP_GROUP     | Parent Group | Child Group |            1\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\nTemporarily rotate the top User Directory, to create the relationships for each of the groups:\r\n# Move lower directories to the top and add new group memberships for each directory\r\n# After the new memberships have been added, you can revert the directory order to the original or required setting.",

      "description": "h1. Summary Note:\r\nWhile the summary was how the issue described herein was discovered, the Kanban board and filters are not the root cause.  I use this summary because it may be more helpful to others who discover the same issue.  \r\n\r\nh1.  Relevant Links\r\nRelates to [Why is a JIRA issue with an EMPTY fixversion retured in query results?|https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/55192/why-is-a-jira-issue-with-an-empty-fixversion-retured-in-query-results] and I have a comment on the OP.\r\n[Workflow assigns user but email notification doesn't say assignee changed|https://support.atlassian.com/servicedesk/customer/portal/22/JSP-253730] support ticket where I was told to raise this issue myself.\r\n\r\nh1. Steps to Discover Existing Root Cause Issue\r\nAny hits on the following query: {{fixVersion NOT in releasedVersions() AND fixVersion NOT in unreleasedVersions() and fixVersion is not EMPTY}}.  A hit on this query is the basis for this issue.\r\n\r\nh1. Steps to Reproduce\r\nAtlassian JIRA Project Management Software (v6.4.3#64018-sha1:4550402)\r\nOne set of steps to reproduce (note that once the problem is produced, there is not a known way to undo it so preferably do not perform this on something you want to appear on a Kanban board otherwise append {{OR fixVersion NOT in releasedVersions()}} to the default subfilter):\r\n# Create a test issue or navigate to an existing issue\r\n# Fill in the fix Version/s field with an existing version (a new version created from field entry was not tested)\r\n# Navigate to the project management page and manage the versions\r\n# Choose to delete the version that you associated with the aforementioned issue, as shown in attachment.\r\n# When prompted that \"there are issues related to this version, specify what is to be done with them\" select \"remove version\" (the other option of swap was not tested)\r\n# Run the following query with or without the ID for that issue and the issue will appear in the search results {{fixVersion NOT in releasedVersions() AND fixVersion NOT in unreleasedVersions() and fixVersion is not EMPTY AND ID = DMZ-48}} (where DMZ-48 is the ID of the issue being worked) or {{fixVersion NOT in releasedVersions() AND fixVersion NOT in unreleasedVersions() and fixVersion is not EMPTY}} and also the issue will drop of a Kanban board if it was there before and the board uses the default sub filter.\r\n\r\nThere may be other steps to reproduce, and they may not be isolated to the release manager.  Let me know if anyone finds other steps that reproduce the issue.\r\n\r\nh1. Workaround:\r\nThe workaround for after this issue has already occurred is to include a fix version that is unreleased OR to change the subfilter to say {{fixVersion in unreleasedVersions() OR fixVersion is EMPTY OR fixVersion NOT in releasedVersions()}} should be ok short term.  The filter change workaround may induce performance issues in the long term.\r\n\r\nh1. Preventative Action:\r\nProven proper way is to delete a version from the issues it is contained in BEFORE deleting it from the version manager:\r\n# Run the JQL query on the version you want to remove {{fixVersion = \"Test 1\"}} and may also need to be done for affected version.\r\n# Perform a bulk operation on all issues to \"Change Fix Version/s\" select field action \"Find and remove these\" and type in the version to delete.\r\n# JQL query on the issue ID itself {{fixVersion NOT in releasedVersions() AND fixVersion NOT in unreleasedVersions() and fixVersion is not EMPTY AND ID = DMZ-48}} or without the ID {{fixVersion NOT in releasedVersions() AND fixVersion NOT in unreleasedVersions() and fixVersion is not EMPTY}} should not return the issue that this operation was performed on and also the issue will stay on a Kanban board if it was there before and the board uses the default sub filter.\r\n\r\nh1. Speculation: \r\nIf there is a special flag parameter for \"fixVersion is not EMPTY\" then it may not have been changed properly.  May have something to do with NULL rather than EMPTY.   {{fixVersion NOT in releasedVersions() AND fixVersion NOT in unreleasedVersions() and fixVersion is not EMPTY}}.  It should be obvious that this query should not return any results.  If it is not in the released version list or the unreleased version list, then the fix version field should be empty because in theory the fix version is either released or unreleased.  Since the release manager maintains the version list, but the fixVersion field itself is independent of the release manager lists, then there has been some kind of decoupling that has occurred. \r\n\r\nh1. Additional Work and Speculation\r\nThe below text includes queries for a specific project, but the problem was not isolated to that project as is discovered about half way through.  \r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nAdded a fix version to an issue that never had one before, then I removed it and it did not have the issue discussed below. So simply deleting the fix version field does not break it.\r\n\r\nI thought a possible root cause is that the issue was moved to a different project, thus stripping the version fields since the versions are specific to a project.  I think the long term preventative workaround is to clear the affected and fix version fields *before* moving the issue to another project.  \r\n\r\nSince the history shows that the workflow has been changed, it is possible that the workflow was changed due to a move.  I know that I probably moved issues between projects to manually reset the state they were in rather than running it through the entire workflow or in some cases there were states that only occurred initially.\r\n\r\nThe tracking down the root cause work is described below;\r\n\r\nThe subfilter is the one filtering it out, but that is *not* the root cause.  The primary filter {{project = FFAA ORDER BY Rank ASC}} only searches for items in that specific project and then sorts them.  The subfilter (and this is set by default and can be changed) is {{fixVersion in unreleasedVersions() OR fixVersion is EMPTY}} and the description states {quote}\"Further filtering of issues for unreleased work.\"{quote}\r\nWhen running {{project = FFAA AND NOT fixVersion in unreleasedVersions() AND NOT fixVersion is EMPTY}} and just {{project = FFAA AND NOT fixVersion in unreleasedVersions()}} the only results are the issues that should be showing up on the Kanban board.  The latter search tells me that JIRA thinks the issue is involved with a fix version that is not unreleased (meaning it thinks it has been released).  Kalen Brown made changes - 01/Jul/15 4:17 PM - where the Fix Version/s field was populated with a fix version, however there are no further records showing that it was removed even though the fix version field is currently empty.  This relates to the link related to this issue.  Again, this is not the root cause.  The other place that the fix and affected versions are managed is in the release manager, so it could have been removed from there (this is very likely) and then there was an integrity problem because the release manager did not properly update the issues.\r\n\r\nThe root cause is revealed with the result of this query: \r\n{{project = FFAA AND NOT fixVersion in releasedVersions() AND NOT fixVersion in unreleasedVersions()}}  \r\nApparently the JIRA record still includes the fix version that shows up in the history, but it neither appears in \"releasedVersion()\" nor \"unreleasedVersion()\" since the release manager does not contain that version.\r\n\r\nAdded \"EP-SYS-9526 Rev A\" to the release manger but the unique ID \"[ 10002 ]\" will likely not be the same.  When adding the fix version under question, that did not fix the issue.  And when deleting the temporary fix version under question I was given this notice {quote}There are no issues related to this version. It is safe to delete.{quote} which implies that there is a check before deleting a version to make sure that is not contained in existing issues.  So a deletion from the release manager shouldn't have caused it because of this initial check, assuming the check works correctly.\r\n\r\nRan this query {{project = FFAA AND NOT fixVersion in releasedVersions() AND NOT fixVersion in unreleasedVersions()}}   and performed a bulk operation on all 15 issues to \"Change Fix Version/s\" to \"Clear field\" but that did not fix it because the query still shows those versions so the field is infact cleared...  \r\n\r\n{{project = FFAA AND NOT fixVersion in releasedVersions() AND NOT fixVersion in unreleasedVersions() AND fixVersion is EMPTY}} yields no results but {{project = FFAA AND NOT fixVersion in releasedVersions() AND NOT fixVersion in unreleasedVersions() AND fixVersion is not EMPTY}} yields the that should be showing up on the Kanban board related issues.\r\n\r\n{{project = FFAA AND fixVersion is not EMPTY}} yields includes issues that should be showing up on the Kanban board along with others from other projects, but those issues are all included even though when showing the column for the fix version it appears to be empty. {{project = FFAA AND fixVersion = \"EP-SYS-9526 Rev A\"}} yields not results so there may be a flag set somewhere that didn't get cleared when the field was cleared, and since the clearing didn't appear in the history it would seem that the field wasn't cleared properly.  \r\n\r\nwith a bulk operation to replace what was existing in those issues with a fix and affected version.  :\r\n{quote}Kalen Brown made changes - 2 minutes ago\r\nAffects Version/s\t\tEP-SYS-9526 Rev OR [ 10419 ]\r\nAffects Version/s\t\tEP-SYS-9526 Rev OR [ 10419 ]\r\nFix Version/s\t\tEP-SYS-9526 Rev A [ 10418 ]\r\nFix Version/s\t\tEP-SYS-9526 Rev A [ 10418 ]{quote}\r\nUnsure why it shows up twice.  After performing this operation and including a fix version that hasn't been released, it now shows up on the Kanban board.  But since the issues that I just performed the bulk edit on are not planned to be fixed in a release (which is why the version was deleted in the first place), the fix version will be cleared again to see if the same queries still show a hidden problem.  Bulk operation to Change Fix Version/s operation of Clear field.  This did NOT fix the problem as now it does not show up on the Kahban board and the issues that should be showing up on the Kanban board appear with the query {{project = FFAA AND fixVersion is not EMPTY}} even though the column shows it is cleared.  An XML and Excel of the query {{fixVersion != EMPTY}}  shows that there are 22.  In the excel export, the \"fixVersion\" field is infact empty and contains no characters including white space.  In the XML export, it shows the query I performed and shows fix versions on some but not on others.  The field is not even shown in the XML export for the issues that do not have anything in their fix version field.  So, as far as I can tell, functionally the field is empty.\r\n\r\nOne of the 22 was edited individually to see if a bulk operation was not fixing it.  When the fix version was added, then it was removed from the result of the following query, but once the fix version was deleted then it was a listed result in the following query.  In the log it says the Fix Version/s was changed from the original value of \"Test 1 [ 10400 ]\" and then has nothing, not even a unique identifier, in the new value column.  It seems that DMZ-26 suffers the same history problem where the Fix Version/s of \"1 [ 10100 ]\" was entered but was never shown as removed.  The history shows that the workflow was changed and that was the \"only\" change shown in the history. \r\n\r\nI have attempted the integrity check, re-index, filling in the field and then clearing it both with an individual and bulk operation, and I can't make it so that JIRA thinks the fix version field is cleared. The related link has an answer that suggests a SQL query, but I will have to request specific permission to mess with the SQL database directly.  I am the JIRA administrator for our instance, but I am not the administrator of the server itself.\r\n\r\nif {{fixVersion NOT in releasedVersions() AND fixVersion NOT in unreleasedVersions() and fixVersion is not EMPTY}} then where and what is it?  It must think there is a fix version but I can't see what it is.  ",
