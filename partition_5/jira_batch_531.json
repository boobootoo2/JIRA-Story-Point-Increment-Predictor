Issue Summary\n\nWhen an Admin schedules a maintenance window for the JIRA instance, there is no way they can announce this to all Service Desk customers or even have the announcement shown on the customer portal automatically for all projects.\n\nh5. Steps to Reproduce\n\n# Go to Announcement Banner page.\n# Add a message to the announcement banner.\n# Go to the customer portal\n\nSimilarly, adding an announcement to the Help Desk does not carry over to All projects.\n\nh5. Expected Result\n\nJIRA Service Desk would show a similar Announcement in each customer portal to match what is seen in JIRA.\n\nh5. Actual Result\n\nNothing would be shown in the JIRA Service Desk, hence users would not know that the instance is down for maintenance or even be alert before the maintenance day comes.\n\nh5. Feature Request\n\nEither have the Announcement Banner map to all Customer portals or have announcements added to the Help Desk page mapped to all customer portals.\n\nh5. Workaround\n\n{panel:title=Option 1}\n# Go to the Customer portal for each project.\n# Add an Announcement to each letting the user know that there is a scheduled downtime.\n{panel}\n\n{panel:title=Option 2}\n# Setup a URL redirect to listen for users attempting to access either JIRA or JIRA service desk customer portals, redirecting them to a page that contains a message that the site is down for maintenance.\n{panel}",

Issue Summary\n\nWhen a user configures their Service Desk create request to contain a field help, the content of the help section will always appear on a single line failing to follow even HTML descriptions like the description section of fields found in JIRA.\n\nh5. Usage Scenario\n\nIf a user want to let customer know what each option represents in an orderly manner, the ability to have each entry on a separate line would be great similar to the below:\n{code}\nLevel 1 - For JIRA Outages, Critical Functions Broken.\nLevel 2 - For Major functions breaking or impacts a large number of people\nLevel 3 - Non-major functions breaking or impacts a small number of users\nLevel 4 - For learning about specific functions.\n{code}\n\nh5. Steps to Reproduce\n\n# Go to {{Your Project > Project Settings > Request Type}} page.\n# Select the Edit field link.\n# In the page that comes up, add the field *Priority*.\n# In the field help section, attempt to add a description with multiple lines.\n#- On pressing {{Shift+enter}}, instead of creating a new line the parameter is saved.\n# If you instead add an HTML script such as the below, it would still appear as a single line:\n{code}\nLevel 1 - This is a Level 1 </br>\nLevel 2 - This is a Level 2 </br>\nLevel 3 - This is a Level 3 </br>\nLevel 4 - This is a Level 4 </br>\n{code}\n\nh5. Expected Result\n\nService Desk would obey the above and show the entries on multiple lines.\n\nh5. Actual Result\n\nJIRA Service Desk would show all entries on a single line as seen below(server result vs Service Desk result)\n\n !image-2017-03-20-17-49-10-891.png|thumbnail!  vs  !image-2017-03-20-17-49-50-533.png|thumbnail!

The CSAT email is now sent out when either:\r\n * The resolution field is set to some value (from empty) OR\r\n * The status category of the issue's status is changed to 'Done'\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nOliver Wessels and the Jira Service Management team.\r\n{panel}\r\nh5. Issue Summary\r\n\r\nWhen a service desk agent closes an issue, if they are using a customized workflow or field configuration that does not make the resolution field compulsory, when the issue is closed, not customer satisfaction survey is sent as JIRA still considers the issue as being unresolved which is the condition required to be met for surveys as stated [here|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/SERVICEDESKSERVER033/Collecting+customer+satisfaction+%28CSAT%29+feedback].\r\nh5. Usage Scenario\r\n\r\nIn a company that does not mark issues based on resolution and only worry about transitioning the ticket to the closed status, there is no way for them to send out a custom survey for the customer to fill since JIRA would in all scenarios consider the issue as resolved.\r\nh5. Feature Request\r\n\r\nAllow JIRA Service Desk to recognize the *closed* state as a point to trigger the CSAT survey rather than just the Resolve issue.\r\n\r\nThis would help ensure that teams can have notifications sent to their customers once the the issue issue is closed.\r\nh5. Existing\r\n\r\nJIRA checks if the resolution field is field when the issue is closed and then triggers the notification.\r\nh5. Workaround\r\n\r\nUsers can setup a generic resolution for their team when an issue has been resolved so that their issues would always be resolved to this generic resolution instead of having the field blank.",

Summary\r\n\r\nIn Cloud, it's possible to retrieve attachments for a request via REST API albeit being experimental (requires HTTP header \"X-ExperimentalApi\":\"opt-in\"). Example:\r\n * GET /rest/servicedeskapi/request/\\{issueIdOrKey}/attachment\r\n * GET /rest/servicedeskapi/request/\\{issueIdOrKey}/comment/\\{commentId}/attachment\r\n\r\n(i) Reference: https://docs.atlassian.com/jira-servicedesk/REST/cloud/#servicedeskapi/request/ \\{issueIdOrKey}/attachment\r\n\r\nHowever, the underlying redirection in comments to /secure/{\"thumbnail\" or \"attachment\"}/{commentId}/myimage.png?fromIssue={issueId} creates a problem for Connect Apps because Safari blocks cross-site cookies. This forces Apps to awkward and potentially unsafe proxies of the attachments.\r\n\r\nh3. Suggestion\r\n\r\nAllow Jira to process attachment calls from API clients using the `ACT_AS_USER` mechanism to respect both user permissions and browser policies. And stabilize the APIs so the experimental header and label can be removed.",

Suggested Solution\nInstead of using the fields that are configured for the Request Type in the Customer Portal view for the Customer, it would be good if the *Raise a request* feature actually picks up fields from the Create issue screen of the project.

Problem Definition\n\nAfter Service Desk 3.1 where there is no need for users to have a license in Confluence to be able to access the Confluence Knowledge Base through Service Desk, there's a few restrictions to accomplish that:\n # Have the same user base in both JSD & Confluence. You can accomplish this by using JIRA as a user directory for Confluence or by having JIRA Service Desk and Confluence use Crowd to share a user base.\n # Manually create a user in Confluence for every customer in JSD that will need access to the Knowledge Base. You can create a \"customer\" account in Confluence by not assigning it to a group. This will not count against your Confluence license.\n\nh3. Suggested Solution\n\nAdd a specific permission on Confluence to allow Service Desk customers to search KB articles without a Confluence license.\nh3. Why this is important\n\nSince SDS can be fulfilled with new customers frequently, it can be a massive task to create customers account on the Confluence side just to provide them the ability to access KB articles through Service Desk",

I've had to set this in place as i have no other way to be able to filter out with a rule to select specific users to only receive a particular scenario of incident created\n\nIt work work for my situation if we could set up users to be in the same group as all users but to be able to set up an exclusion rule so they do not receive all notifications for issues created or updated\n\nThe reason for this request is because the users are part of a senior executive leadership team and whilst they want to be able to view a ticket\u00a0as they see fit...they only want to be contacted via email notification when the problem is critical",

Problem Solution:\r\nAt the moment, when we run a GET REST API to get a request type details, the response will be shown like below:\r\n{code}GET /rest/servicedeskapi/servicedesk/{serviceDeskId}/requesttype{code}\r\n{code:xml}\r\n{\r\n  \"id\": \"18\",\r\n  \"_links\": {\r\n    \"self\": \"http://xxxxxx/rest/servicedeskapi/servicedesk/1/requesttype/18\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"name\": \"Monitor\",\r\n  \"description\": \"\",\r\n  \"helpText\": \"\",\r\n  \"serviceDeskId\": \"1\",\r\n  \"groupIds\": [\r\n    \"1\"\r\n  ],\r\n  \"icon\": {\r\n    \"id\": \"10532\",\r\n    \"_links\": {\r\n      \"iconUrls\": {\r\n        \"48x48\": \"http://xxxxx/secure/viewavatar?avatarType=SD_REQTYPE&size=large&avatarId=10532\",\r\n        \"24x24\": \"http://xxxxx/secure/viewavatar?avatarType=SD_REQTYPE&size=small&avatarId=10532\",\r\n        \"16x16\": \"http://xxxxx/secure/viewavatar?avatarType=SD_REQTYPE&size=xsmall&avatarId=10532\",\r\n        \"32x32\": \"http://xxxxx/secure/viewavatar?avatarType=SD_REQTYPE&size=medium&avatarId=10532\"\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n{code}\r\nFrom here, we could not actually find the key of the request type that is being used for JIRA when storing the Customer Request Type Custom field value in the database.\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution:\r\nTo include the key in the response or better adding the lowercase project key at the front as how it is in the {{customfieldvalue}} table.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nSee below KB article for a workaround. However, please take into account that this is not supported and it may stop working without any previous notice:\r\n- [How to set the Request Type when creating an issue using Jira Core REST API in Cloud|https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirakb/how-to-set-the-request-type-when-creating-an-issue-using-jira-core-rest-api-in-cloud-974366000.html]\r\n",

Problem Definition\nStarting with Service Desk 3.3.0 the *Subject* of Service Desk notifications no longer appears to automatically vary with the action being notified about.\n\nFor example, in JSD 3.1.x, if an Agent resolved a ticket, the Customer would receive a notification with a Subject like this: {quote}[Prefix] Request resolved as \"Done\" #EXAMPLE-3: test request{quote}\n\nHowever in JSD 3.3.0 this behavior changed and the equivalent action results in a notification with a subject as follows, using the default template: {quote}EXAMPLE-3 test request{quote}\n\nFor reference the default template is: {code:borderStyle=solid}${issue.key} ${issue.summary}{code} \n\nThe only variables available for the *Subject* are: \n* Issue key\n* Issue summary\n* Portal name\n\nh3. Suggested Solution\nMake additional variables available to refer to the action being performed.\n\nThis may not be sufficient, however, as there are cases where multiple actions are placed into a single notification, in which case I'm not sure how that would work. \n\nh3.

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSDSERVER-4901].\n  {panel}\n\n+underlined text+{panel:title=Response 15 March 2017}\nHi all,\n\nThanks for your responses.\n\nWe understand that this is a significant change for some of you. As part of making authentication and single sign-on easier across Atlassian products we have consolidated product access through Atlassian account ([https://confluence.atlassian.com/cloud/atlassian-account-for-users-873871199.html]). This means that access to our products outside the customer portal requires an Atlassian account.\n\nCustomers can still search for KB articles, view articles, bookmark articles and so on using the customer portal. This does not require an Atlassian account as it's done through the customer portal.\n\nIf you need your customers to\u00a0*directly*\u00a0access Confluence to browse through KB articles, you can either:\n # Make your space anonymous-accessible. This will mean that anyone will be able to browse your KB articles without needing to log in. If you are experiencing issues as described in\u00a0CONF-30161\u00a0then please make sure you have linked your space to a JIRA Service Desk project via Project Settings\u00a0\u2192 Knowledge Base as this fixes the problem.\n # If you do not want to make your space anonymous accessible, ie. you want customers to explicitly log in before they can see Confluence, then you must convert your customer user accounts to Atlassian accounts. You can convert them yourself using the instructions on\u00a0[https://confluence.atlassian.com/cloud/select-the-right-account-for-your-jira-service-desk-customers-873871210.html]\u00a0or you can file a support ticket and our support can bulk migrate your customer accounts to Atlassian accounts. Having an Atlassian account does not consume a license.\n\n\u00a0\n\nJIRA Service Desk Team\n{panel}\nh3. \u00a0\n{panel:title=Response 13 March 2017}\nHi all,\n\nThis is expected behavior. Updating our accounts meant we had to shuffle things around a bit.\n\nYour agents have a single account for all your Cloud products. But, your customers are special. They may not recognize Atlassian and we don't want to confuse them.\n\nTo keep your organization's branding on your help desk articles, we recommend sharing knowledge base links to your customers via the customer portal. Your customers can search for and read help articles in the portal, without needing to learn Confluence, and they don't leave your help desk experience.\n\nYour agents can link customers to this view, and avoid linking them to Confluence. To provide a portal view of articles to your customers in an issue comment:\n * View the customer issue.\n * Under Related knowledge base articles, select the article to share or select Search knowledge base.\n * Preview the article and select Share as comment.\n\nIf you want your customers to browse all of your Confluence space, we recommend migrating them to Atlassian account. If you migrate them, they can log into your Confluence space, browse the page tree, and read articles. But, they will need to learn what Atlassian is and use our log in and account management screens. We don't recommend this for teams who serve external customers. [Learn how to migrate customers to Atlassian account|https://confluence.atlassian.com/cloud/select-the-right-account-for-your-jira-service-desk-customers-873871210.html].\n\nAnother potential workaround is to open your Confluence space for anonymous view access, this will allow any user to view your Confluence knowledge base space without logging in.\u00a0[Learn how to enable anonymous access to a Confluence space|https://confluence.atlassian.com/confkb/how-to-give-non-confluence-users-access-to-a-space-779166002.html].\n - JIRA Service Desk Team{panel}\nh3. Summary\n\nPortal users cannot access knowledge base on a cloud instance that authenticates via [https://id.atlassian.com|https://id.atlassian.com/].\nh3. Environment\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\n - On an instance with SSO enabled (id.atlassian.com), create a service desk project linked with a Confluence knowledge base.\n - Enable unlicensed access : *Project Settings > Knowledge base > All active users and customers can access the knowledge base without a Confluence license.*\n - Create a portal only user via the Customers page in the Service Desk project.\n - Let the portal only user log in the portal.\n - Access the direct link to the knowledge base article (ie https://<instance>.atlassian.net/wiki/display/SK/KP_Page).\n\nh3. Expected Results\n\nPortal only user should be able to open the page.\nh3. Actual Results\n\nPortal only user will be requested to authentic via SSO (id.atlassian.com). Login will either fail or reply with a permission error :\n{noformat}\nYour account doesn't have access\nLooks like you don't have access to this site. If you think you should have access, contact your administrator.\nIf you would like to use a different email address on this site you can switch accounts.\n{noformat}\nh3. Notes\nh3.
