This approach would provide some level of filter/dash sharing privileges to all users:\r\n\r\n* Share with project (ALL) - restricted to project admins (or controlled by new permission in the permission schemes) (anyone with global permission also can share at this level)\r\n* Share with project (by role) AND Share with group - user allowed to only share with roles to which they belong (implicit permission - no special permission, but add system parameter to turn feature on/off) (anyone with global permission also can share at this level)\r\n* Share with everyone - restricted to global permission only\r\n\r\nThis approach would allow administrators of larger implementations to have more granular control over how users share filters without restricting users to not be able to collaborate.  All the while, the current behavior can still be achieved by using the global permission.  Whereas, today, it's an all-or-none approach.\r\n\r\nThis item dovetails with JRA-9997 and JRA-19780.",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-21644].\n  {panel}\n\nRecently got the 4.1.x 'new look' 'view issue' and 'edit issue' screens via JIRA Studio. I see much prior discussion, but no prior issue focused on one specific aspect: the fixed-at-top issue title and operations bar. On screens with more spare width than height -- and many laptop widescreens fall into this category -- this behavior severely cramps the interesting discussion log. \r\n\r\nIn particular, the fixed-area can take up more than half the viewport (!), with just a few assumptions (which happen to apply on my 13\" MacBook, and probably others' laptops as well). Fonts may be generously sized for the small screen -- making a long issue title wrap to 3-4 lines, and the operations tabs wrap to 2 lines  -- and other toolbars/menubars/docks/tab-bars/search-footers further cramp the viewport from top and bottom. This makes very few lines of comment logs visible. \r\n\r\nThe old layout used horizontal space more effectively, such that the entire vertical viewport could be used to view the comment-log. \r\n\r\nAt least in the current generations of Firefox (3.x) and Safari (5.x), fixating the issue title inside the page is largely redundant, because it already appears in the window title bar. (Further, this info does not need to be repeatedly consulted while browsing an issue's history.) Easy access to operations (especially the most-used 'comment' button) could be provided at top and bottom without impairing the reading of long issue histories. \r\n\r\nI know you don't want to provide an 'old look' toggle; however, simply allowing a toggle (or CSS customization) to disabl the fixed-float of the title/operations-bar would fix 90%+ of this problem on small/wide screens.

This is more of an application problem though, the fact is, nothing should ever make a remote call during start up, otherwise this will wreak havoc with circular dependencies.

Why? To avoid two concurrent cache filling? But reading from cache is still possible even it contains non actual data.\r\n\r\nMore correct behavior is to invalidate only specific elements of cache and remove it from cache and then reread only one from DB. It could be realized with ConcurentHashMap to avoid locking of actions on different projects ",

Summary\r\n\r\nWhen a session contains a search result (as a result of using any search in JIRA), there is a possibility that during standard view issue operations a bottleneck can occur on the NextPreviousPager monitor. This can result in the entire JIRA becoming unresponsive and rendering the instance unusable.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nIt is not currently known what the exact steps are to reproduce this, however it involves viewing issues when a search result is contained within a user session.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nJIRA operates as normal.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nJIRA becomes unresponsive as lock congestion occurs on the NextPreviousPager monitor.\r\n\r\nh3. Notes\r\nView issue screen is pretty fast (my measures points to 16 RPS), but only we have no active search. If the session contain a search request, updating NextPreviousPager is a significant bottleneck.\r\nEven on 1 RPS response time raise exponentially and after 1 minute of load JIRA became unresponsive.\r\n\r\nThe performance impact can be exacerbated by using complicated searches or expensive JQL functions.\r\n\r\nh3. Diagnosis\r\n\r\n[Generate a Thread Dump|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Generating+a+Thread+Dump] 6 times every 10 seconds during periods of unresponsiveness and read it with [TDA|http://java.net/projects/tda] or a similar tool. If there is a bottleneck in the NextPreviousPager monitor as per the attached screenshot there is a significant likelihood the instance is affected by this problem.\r\n\r\nThis can also be identified with the below commands - we're going to grep the thread dumps to see how many threads that are waiting to lock NextPreviousPager. If there's a high number persisting across multiple thread dumps over time, it's probably this bug.\r\n\r\n{noformat}\r\n$ grep \"waiting to lock.*NextPreviousPager\" jstack.4440.threadHigh.* | awk '{print $1}' |sort |uniq -c\r\n 24 jstack.4440.threadHigh.103649.939600529:\r\n 27 jstack.4440.threadHigh.103701.620551473:\r\n 25 jstack.4440.threadHigh.103713.178859435:\r\n 25 jstack.4440.threadHigh.103724.736087099:\r\n 25 jstack.4440.threadHigh.103736.376659166:\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nThis shows the number of threads waiting to lock the monitor grouped by thread dump.
