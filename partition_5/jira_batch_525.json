Summary\r\n\r\nWhen a ticket is moved or transition from an approval-configured status to a non-approval status, the agent view (in Jira) still shows options for approving the ticket (Approve and Decline). \r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nh5. Scenario 1 (Moving the ticket from a workflow with approval to a non-approval workflow)\r\n# Modify the workflow from an issue type on a Service Desk Project to require approval, and have at least one issue type on the same project that does not have approval as part of the workflow.\r\n# Create a ticket on the issue type that needs approval\r\n# Move the ticket to the issue type that does not require approval\r\n\r\nh5. Scenario 2 (Transition a ticket from approval status without setting approval)\r\n# Create a workflow with approval and create a transition to back from the approval status to the previous status. Publish the workflow.\r\n# Create an issue and transition to the approval status. Transition it back to the previous status. The 'Approve' and 'Decline' buttons will keep available in the customer portal.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nApproval is no longer needed for the ticket\r\n\r\nh3.

Even when we change the language on the browser or on the instance, the widget is still generated in English. The widget will follow the language configured for the Request type, request type field and the text configured in widget settings. However, for the hardcoded text, for example *How can we help?, Contact us about, Powered by JIRA Service Desk, Your contact e-mail, and Send button* can't be changed.\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nIt would be great if we could choose different languages on the widget.\r\nh3. Why this is important\r\n\r\nSome customer is not able to understand other language.

Summary\r\n\r\nWhen multiple attachments are uploaded with the same name, whilst each individual image is saved to Jira itself, in the customer portal the customer see's duplicate attachments of the first image uploaded - after saving that is, the preview shows as intended.

But if you go to the attachment field of the issue you can see the individual images.\u00a0\r\n\r\nPresumably, because it looks for the image name, finds the first image with that name and re-uses the same image for each subsequent attachment. This is very confusing for customers who believe they uploaded the same image multiple times.\u00a0This also makes it very difficult for the agent to know which attachments belong\u00a0to which comment.\r\n\r\nYou notice this a lot when customers have to paste multiple screenshots into a ticket.\r\n\r\n\u00a0---------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nI have attached two images (one is 6&nbspkB, the other is 14\u00a0kB) to this job with the same name: {{Image001.png}}.\r\n\r\nOnly the last loaded image will display for multiple references to the image.\r\n !Image001.png!\r\n\r\nThe list of attachments seems to understand that the two are different as one of them is greyed out.

So as far as DMARC is concerned no relevant validation has taken place for the domain and therefore got rejected.\r\n\r\n*Update :* Upon further investigation it looks like DMARC is not compatible with the custom email address setting in Jira Cloud. DMARC explicitly check that the domain in the From: header matches those that pass in the DKIM-Signature: header.\r\n\r\nThis is further corroborated by this [FAQ entry|https://dmarc.org/wiki/FAQ#Why_are_messages_I_send_on_behalf_of_visitors_to_my_website_being_blocked.3F] on the dmarc.org website. At this time there is no option to control the Reply-To: header in Jira Cloud. This option need to be added to in the Jira product and is raised with this feature request.\r\n\r\nThe following workaround is suggested for affected instance with this limitation.\r\n\r\n*Workaround* :\r\n # *Whitelist IP* range from this [https://confluence.atlassian.com/cloud/atlassian-cloud-ip-ranges-and-domains-744721662.html]\r\n # Use From: address the default *<user>@<instance>.atlassian.net* email address",

In that email, there is a link to view the ticket that was submitted in JIRA to see updated status and comments and respond with comments when necessary.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThis link, however, requires the user to register/login in JIRA in order to view the submitted ticket.
