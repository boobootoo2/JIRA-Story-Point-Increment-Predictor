I think current JiRA DB is not storing the version creation date. Currently I can find only the list/sequence in which they has been added.\r\n\r\n We would like to have a more column under 'projectversion' table where it maintain the version creation date, it will help us in filtering when the version has been created. \r\nIt would be great if we capture this version creation date from JiRA frontend instead of running the query on database.\r\n\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n- Vishal",

One and the same issue could have different resolutions per branch, i.e. invalid if a broken functionality does not exist anymore. Nevertheless, all branches have to be checked, likely in different time frames.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately JIRA does not support the notion of branches. You have to emulate the behaviour using different schemes like:\r\n\r\n    * One issue per version that represents a branch\r\n    * Multiple fix versions for an issue\r\n    * Subtasks for an issue or issue links to ckeck and fix the issue for different versions\r\n\r\nReal branching support could help you check on which branch an issue is done, where it has still to be resolved and so on without adding more and more (perhaps loosely connected) issues to your system or forgetting to fix the issue on some branch (no question/warning when resolving an issue with multiple fix versions).",
