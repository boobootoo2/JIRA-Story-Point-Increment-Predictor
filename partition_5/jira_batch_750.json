We use a project for my organization, and components for each of the sub teams.\r\n\r\nI have one amazing dashboard which I use to enable team members to know what to focus on, both in terms of top defects and stories for our currently Agile sprints (we use the green hopper plug in). We update our dashboard with changes to gadgets at least every 2 weeks based on sprint changes, defect changes, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nGiven that I have such a large team, the overall view is helpful for me, but a filtered view is what I would like to be able for users to set as their default.\r\n\r\nSo for instance, if I could apply a filter \"Project=AM and Component=Hello\" to all gadgets that are based off filters in the dashboard, then all users that are only working on component Hello automatically would get to focus just on their small piece of the pie instead of the whole picture.\r\n\r\n\r\nI cannot maintain multiple dashboards since overall company priorities change often, so we need a way to filter one dashboard so that a user can have a filtered view of the dashboard I want them to use as per my organizational goals.",

They closed it, pointing out that the stack trace included \"com.atlassian.jira.rest.client\" and told me to file this with Atlassian.  From the product list, I don't see anything closer than JIRA.  I'm just repeating the same report here, with some additional information.\r\n\r\nI have a Kepler workspace that I've been using for a while. I've had the JIRA connector installed and running for a long time.\r\n\r\nToday was the first time I created some projects from a cloned git workspace.  Sometime after the first project was created, I started to get error dialogs popping up every few minutes saying 'An internal error occurred during \"Synchronizing Task List\".'  This continued to happen while I had those git projects in my workspace.  After several hours of this, the error dialog popping up every synch interval, I then deleted all of the git projects.  I don't know if that's exactly what's causing the conflict, but now there are no more error dialogs.  I'm going to be checking out those projects again in the next few days.\r\n\r\nThis is the stack trace from the log:\r\n\r\n!ENTRY org.eclipse.core.jobs 4 2 2013-11-07 18:06:17.475\r\n!MESSAGE An internal error occurred during: \"Synchronizing Task List\".\r\n!STACK 0\r\ncom.sun.jersey.spi.service.ServiceConfigurationError: com.sun.jersey.spi.HeaderDelegateProvider: The class com.sun.jersey.core.impl.provider.header.LocaleProvider implementing provider interface com.sun.jersey.spi.HeaderDelegateProvider could not be instantiated: Cannot cast com.sun.jersey.core.impl.provider.header.LocaleProvider to com.sun.jersey.spi.HeaderDelegateProvider\r\n\tat com.sun.jersey.spi.service.ServiceFinder.fail(ServiceFinder.java:602)\r\n\tat com.sun.jersey.spi.service.ServiceFinder.access$800(ServiceFinder.java:159)\r\n\tat com.sun.jersey.spi.service.ServiceFinder$LazyObjectIterator.hasNext(ServiceFinder.java:892)\r\n\tat com.sun.jersey.core.spi.factory.AbstractRuntimeDelegate.<init>(AbstractRuntimeDelegate.java:76)\r\n\tat com.sun.ws.rs.ext.RuntimeDelegateImpl.<init>(RuntimeDelegateImpl.java:56)\r\n\tat sun.reflect.NativeConstructorAccessorImpl.newInstance0(Native Method)\r\n\tat sun.reflect.NativeConstructorAccessorImpl.newInstance(NativeConstructorAccessorImpl.java:57)\r\n\tat sun.reflect.DelegatingConstructorAccessorImpl.newInstance(DelegatingConstructorAccessorImpl.java:45)\r\n\tat java.lang.reflect.Constructor.newInstance(Constructor.java:526)\r\n\tat java.lang.Class.newInstance(Class.java:374)\r\n\tat javax.ws.rs.ext.FactoryFinder.newInstance(FactoryFinder.java:65)\r\n\tat javax.ws.rs.ext.FactoryFinder.find(FactoryFinder.java:155)\r\n\tat javax.ws.rs.ext.RuntimeDelegate.findDelegate(RuntimeDelegate.java:105)\r\n\tat javax.ws.rs.ext.RuntimeDelegate.getInstance(RuntimeDelegate.java:91)\r\n\tat javax.ws.rs.core.UriBuilder.newInstance(UriBuilder.java:69)\r\n\tat javax.ws.rs.core.UriBuilder.fromUri(UriBuilder.java:80)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.jira.rest.client.internal.jersey.JerseyJiraRestClient.<init>(JerseyJiraRestClient.java:64)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.jira.rest.client.internal.jersey.JerseyJiraRestClientFactory.create(JerseyJiraRestClientFactory.java:39)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.connector.eclipse.internal.jira.core.service.rest.JiraRestClientAdapter.<init>(JiraRestClientAdapter.java:159)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.connector.eclipse.internal.jira.core.service.JiraClient.createRestClient(JiraClient.java:179)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.connector.eclipse.internal.jira.core.service.JiraClient.getRestClient(JiraClient.java:154)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.connector.eclipse.internal.jira.core.service.JiraClient.getServerInfo(JiraClient.java:627)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.connector.eclipse.internal.jira.core.service.JiraClientCache.refreshServerInfo(JiraClientCache.java:321)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.connector.eclipse.internal.jira.core.service.JiraClientCache.refreshDetails(JiraClientCache.java:288)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.connector.eclipse.internal.jira.core.JiraRepositoryConnector.performQuery(JiraRepositoryConnector.java:125)\r\n\tat org.eclipse.mylyn.internal.tasks.core.sync.SynchronizeQueriesJob.synchronizeQuery(SynchronizeQueriesJob.java:311)\r\n\tat org.eclipse.mylyn.internal.tasks.core.sync.SynchronizeQueriesJob.synchronizeQueries(SynchronizeQueriesJob.java:268)\r\n\tat org.eclipse.mylyn.internal.tasks.core.sync.SynchronizeQueriesJob.run(SynchronizeQueriesJob.java:201)\r\n\tat org.eclipse.mylyn.internal.tasks.core.sync.SynchronizeRepositoriesJob.updateQueries(SynchronizeRepositoriesJob.java:186)\r\n\tat org.eclipse.mylyn.internal.tasks.core.sync.SynchronizeRepositoriesJob.run(SynchronizeRepositoriesJob.java:142)\r\n\tat org.eclipse.core.internal.jobs.Worker.run(Worker.java:53)\r\nCaused by: java.lang.ClassCastException: Cannot cast com.sun.jersey.core.impl.provider.header.LocaleProvider to com.sun.jersey.spi.HeaderDelegateProvider\r\n\tat java.lang.Class.cast(Class.java:3084)\r\n\tat com.sun.jersey.spi.service.ServiceFinder$LazyObjectIterator.hasNext(ServiceFinder.java:851)\r\n\t... 28 more",

      "description": "I'm currently using Jira to test Apache Tomcat 8. I know Tomcat 8 isn't a supported platform and the ASF isn't looking to run on Tomcat 8 in production (yet) but I have discovered a bug in Jira that will occur on Tomcat 8 and could occur on earlier Tomcat versions as well.\r\nJira ships classes from the package com.atlassian.jira.web.util in three places:\r\n* /WEB-INF/classes\r\n* /WEB-INF/lib/jira-api-6.1.2.jar\r\n* /WEB-INF/lib/jira-screenshot-applet-6.1.2.jar\r\n\r\njira-screenshot-applet-6.1.2.jar is a signed JAR.\r\n\r\nThe Servlet specification defines that classes are always loaded from /WEB-INF/classes in preference to /WEB-INF/lib\r\nThe Servlet specification defines no priority order if the same class exists in multiple JARs in /WEB-INF/lib\r\nTomcat's web application class loader extends URLClassLoader which requires that all classes in a package must be consistently signed. That means if any class is signed, they must all be signed.\r\nThe problem occurs if the application server opts to load classes from jira-screenshot-applet-6.1.2.jar before jira-api-6.1.2.jar. The sequence of events is:\r\n# Classes in the com.atlassian.jira.web.util package are loaded from /WEB-INF/classes. These are unsigned.\r\n# An attempt is made to load FileNameCharacterCheckerUtil from that package\r\n# It is not present in /WEB-INF/classes so the JARs in /WEB-INF/lib are searched\r\n# The class is found in jira-screenshot-applet-6.1.2.jar. This class is signed.\r\n# Because classes in the same package have different signatures (some are unsigned, some are signed) a SecurityException is thrown, FileNameCharacterCheckerUtil fails to load and Jira fails to start.\r\n\r\nI am currently working around this by ensuring that JARs are prioritised in an order that avoids this problem. However, Jira should not be relying on a priority order for JARs in /WEB-INF/lib\r\nBased on the name, jira-screenshot-applet-6.1.2.jar might not even be required on the server side and could be moved to somewhere else under /WEB-INF. If it is required server side, then the simplest solution may be to sign all the Jira JARs.",

Unfortunately there are just a couple of features namely creating \"common transitions\" that are missing from it. And since you can't do that from the Text editor, I have to revert to the classic mode editor. But when I try to load the classic mode editor, I get the following traceback:\r\n\r\nI am trying to edit my \"Product Change Workflow\" and the URL is \"https://instance.atlassian.net/secure/admin/workflows/ClassicWorkflowDesigner.jspa?workflowMode=draft&wfName=Product+Change+Workflow\"\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n{quote}com.exadel.flamingo.service.exception.ServiceInvokationException:

Problem Description\r\n\r\nWhen trying to make a custom field required during a transition of a workflow and this custom field has the same name of a system field, JIRA seems to be ignoring it as an option to be chosen. For example, the \"Resolution\" field exists in JIRA by default, so if we create a custom field called \"Resolution\", it won't show up on that list. The system only displays its own \"Resolution\" field. If the user is trying to make this custom field required and end up choosing the one displayed on the list, nothing happens.\r\n\r\nh4. Workaround\r\n\r\nAs a workaround you can rename the custom field (e.g. Resolution 2). Once you rename it, JIRA will start showing this field up as an option and the validator will work as expected.",
