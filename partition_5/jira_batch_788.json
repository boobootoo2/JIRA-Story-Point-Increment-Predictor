This is because the IndexWriter remembers that once upon a time it saw an OOME, and keeps a flag set that is checked in many places to deliberately prevent you from using that IndexWriter ever again.  This makes some sense, and is very clearly documented in the [IndexWriter docs|http://lucene.apache.org/core/old_versioned_docs/versions/3_2_0/api/core/org/apache/lucene/index/IndexWriter.html].\r\n\r\nAs stated there (see the first \"Note\"), this is because Lucene can't be sure that the writer's internal state is valid, and allowing a commit() to proceed could corrupt the index.  The only corrective action that can be taken is to close the IndexWriter, which can then be reopened.  Any writes to it since the previous commit are lost, but at least future writes can go through.\r\n\r\nA cursory examination and recent problem report from the support team shows that we do not do this.  The OutOfMemoryError (or IllegalStateException, if the OOME happened earlier), is passed up the call stack and the IndexWriter is not closed.  Therefore, the IndexWriter remains unusable and the index state can remain stale indefinitely.\r\n",

However, in-line editing of simple fields such as labels or Version fields can be pretty slow. \r\nWhat's actually slow is the time taken to \"save\" the field. The reason I emphasize \"save\" is that Jira is not just saving the new data, but also receiving a lot of data back from the server as part of the response. I accept there's a certain amount of latency in our case between the client and server, but there's a distinct data issue which plays a much larger part in the perception of the speed of the save action\r\n\r\nHow much data depends on the individual Jira instance, and in our case it's approx. 600kb. Looking at the http response details with the Chrome developer tools shows that it's essentially getting a fresh copy of all of the fields (system & custom) and field values that are applicable to the issue in question.\r\n\r\nThis is hugely wasteful for a simple field update. There's a couple of options here:\r\n# Improve the response so the client is only retrieving the refreshed field values, and updating/appending the DOM accordingly\r\n# When the value is submitted, check to see if any of the other issue fields have been updated (by other users working on the same issue), and retrieve those updated/added values along with the field you're currently updating\r\n\r\nEither way, the goal is have only what is being updated being returned to the browser and possibly having a little more intelligence on the client side around inserting what is effectively a diff.\r\n\r\nFWIW, we're using GZIP compression, so the 600KB is the compressed size",

This can have tremendous value in larger teams, as a recipient's understanding of their relationship drives the decision of how to react to the issue event. It also has the nice effect of providing a mechanism for fast-filtering of different types of email notifications - e.g. if a user has email folders for \"My Issues\", \"My Watched Issues\", \"My Reported Issues\", etc.\r\n\r\nTo clarify in terms of user stories, this is what we want:\r\n* As a user receiving an email notification for an issue event, I can immediately gather my relationship to the issue in the email contents.\r\n* As a user receiving an email notification for an issue event, I only see one relationship.\r\n** Ideally the most \"direct\" relationship to the issue is chosen.\r\n** E.g., If the recipient is both the issue's Assignee and in a project role configured to receive all notifications for that issue's project, the relationship in the email notification should be \"Assignee\".",
