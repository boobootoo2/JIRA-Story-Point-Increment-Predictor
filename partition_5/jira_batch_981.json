Using the workaround described in JRA-5442, \nit is possible to change the security level of the sub-task, e.g.\nto hide special tasks from your customers.\n\nHowever, it is not possible to set the (\"hidden\") security level\nupon creation of the sub-task. So, if you want to create a \nprivate sub-task, that is not accessible by your customers, you have \nto first create a sub-task that is automatically private, hence\ngenerating an automatic eMail notification of your customer. Then, \nyou have to edit the sub-task to change the security level.\n\nWouldn't it be more efficient to let the user choose the security level\nwhen creating the sub-task?\nOr could we have special security levels for different types of sub-tasks.\nE.g. create a sub-task \"private sub-task\" that automatically relates to\na certain security level \"private\".\n\n(Just to explain: We are using Jira Enterprise 3.0.3 to track new \nfeatures. It is used by us and our clients. When a new feature issue is\ncreated, we put several development/private sub-tasks under it, to\nsplit work for one feature or to assign private work that has to\nbe done in order to build the new feature. But we do not want our\ncustomer to see, what is going on \"behind the scenes\".)",

We also allow the reporting end users to be automatically created within JIRA.\n\nThe service is configured like this: \n\nName: Support Create/Comment\ncom.atlassian.jira.service.services.pop.PopService \t\nhandler:\tCreate Or Comment Handler\npopserver:\tSupport Mail\nhandler.params:\tproject=SUP, issuetype=8,\ncatchemail=support <at> <our company> <dot> com, createusers=true\n\nThe SUP project is defined like this: \n\n> > Key:  SUP\n> > URL: No URL\n> > Lead: Michael \n> > Default Assignee: Project Lead\n> > Notification Scheme: Support Notification Scheme ( select scheme | edit notifications ) \n> > Permission Scheme: Support Permission Scheme ( select scheme | edit permissions ) \n> > CVS Modules: None ( select modules ) Mail Configuration: Mail notifications from this project will come \n> > from 'support  <at> <our company> <dot> com' ( edit configuration )\n\nThe problem is that SOMETIMES the issue are not assigned to our Project Lead (Michael) but to a (as it seems random) JIRA user. \n\nThis \"random JIRA user\" seems to always be the same as the first user specified in a To: field of in the incoming email. The problem is that the To: field can origin from a quoted mail or from the mail thread of the inbound email!\n\nFor example see this inbound email creating a ticket which have incorrectly assigned to the end user Naseem.\n\n> > \"Hi Michael,\n> > \n> > Can I ask why 1 and 2 would cause the \"\"customer's pc hangs on \"The \n> > program is communicating with the server\" issue?\n> > \n> > Thanks,\n> > \n> > Glenn\n> > \n> > -----Original Message-----\n> > From: support\n> > Sent: 26 January 2005 08:24\n> > To: Naseem\n> > Cc: Glenn;\n> > Subject: Re: Error when sending messages [P3] [Ref.450757]\n> > \n> > Hi Naseem,\n> > ...\"\n\nAs you can see it is the original message that has the To: field set to Naseem. And the automatic assignment can be completed as Naseem himself DOES HAVE a user account in JIRA (from earlier reports), but he should never be assigned any issues.\n\nIt seems that the PopService is looking for the first To: field it can find and tries to assign accordingly. If this fails it assigns to default assignee.\n\nIt's a cool feature if it can assign according to the To: field, but it should never be To: fields of quoted emails. It would also be good if this feature could be turned off, so that default assignee is always used. <-- Feature Request! :)\n\nAlso the To: field sometimes is replaced with a localized field (\"Till:\" in Swedish) and this could perhaps affect this problem. So it would be good if you could define what fields to detect!\n\nI have actually ensured this already AND the PopService violates the permission scheme!!! Users - like Nassim below - was actually assigned to an issue eventhough he's only a \"jira-user\". We have set the \"Assignable User\" user permission to \"jira-developers\" group for all our permission schemes.\n\nSo it seems like a bug that the PopService by-pass the permission enforcement!\n",

      "description": "We work on a number of projects in-house, and run projects for clients as well. \n\nI set up a portal page for us and one for each client, with their projects under it by entering individual project portlets. \n\nThis looks good initially, as our dashboard is also growing to \"a half mile long\" as another user comments. Dismayed to find out that this would have to be recreated and administered on every desktop. \n\n1. GLOBAL PORTALS Portals selectable as \"global\" vs individual. Adding a project to a global portal shows up automatically on every desktop. Portal permissions would let us easily expose a customized portal to a client or vendor.\n\n2. CONFIGURABLE PROJECTS PORTLET Being able to select which projects appear on an instance of this portlet would be a big plus for portal usability. A CMS we are evaluating gives you a simple list of options which you multi-select using the shift and ctrl keys.\n\n3. PROJECT GROUPING A way to group projects, which augments 1 and 2 above, so projects/portal pages can be linked to a business unit or other useful grouping. Just like issues have types, projects can have groups. \n",

      "description": "I am trying to upgrade to 3.0.3 from 2.5.3.  However, I am not able to export the data in XML, it keeps complaining about invalid characters.\n\nI am aware of your issue 2066 which is supposed to have fixed this matter.  I have run the fix_export JSP attached in that issue for v2.5 and the same problem persists.\n\nI have also tried using unix 'tr' to trim away control characters except 9, 10 and 13 in tomcatdb.script (i am using hsql). I also tried resetting bit-7 of all characters so the file is pure ascii.  Still doesn't work.  \n\nPlease help.  I can send my tomcatdb.script separately on rquest.  Thanks!",
