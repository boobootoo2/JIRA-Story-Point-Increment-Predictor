Others have mentioned this issue in answers.atlassian; I don't think that it's been officially addressed; however, we've made the necessary additions for these charts to _start_ generating data.\r\n\r\nThe problem, then, is that our existing projects have no historical data to work with in order to populate these charts.\r\n\r\nThe formats of these custom fields are simple maps of durations or transition times between states.  As such, it would _seem_ as if it should be simple to make a utility that would do the following:\r\n\r\n* Expose a function that allows an administrator to re-generate the custom field data for a project:\r\n** Based on the recorded activity of the issue, which exists in the database\r\n** The admin can by default choose not to include issues where that data exists\r\n* Ideally, it would be nice for this not to cause X notifications of changes.",

This inconsistency led to me wasting time wondering why the query didn't work, and then going to the docs and finding that they were wrong too.\r\n\r\nThe JQL parser should treat {{\"None\"}} as a text value, and {{None}} as a keyword, just as it does for {{\"First\"}} and {{First}}.\r\n\r\nThe [docs|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA040/Advanced+Searching#AdvancedSearching-cascadeOption%28%29] say that the correct JQL for searching for {{\"None\"}} is:\r\n\r\n{quote}\r\nreferrer in cascadeOption(\"\\\"none\"\\\",\"\\\"none\"\\\")\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\n\u2026but that's wrong too. Instead it should be:\r\n\r\n{quote}\r\nreferrer in cascadeOption(\"\\\"none\\\"\",\"\\\"none\\\"\")\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce:**\r\n\r\n# Create a Cascading Select custom field called \"Test field\"\r\n# Add the following options to it:\r\n#* First\r\n#* First\r\n#** None\r\n# Create an issue named \"No child\" and set its *Test Field* value to *First*\r\n# Create an issue named \"Has child\" and set its *Test Field* value to *First > None*\r\n# Create an issue named \"No parent\" and leave its *Test Field* value undefined.\r\n# Run the advanced search: {{\"Test field\" in cascadeOption(none)}}\r\nThe issue \"No parent\" should be found.\r\n# Run the advanced search: {{\"Test field\" in cascadeOption(First)}}\r\nA JQL error should occur (more details below).\r\n# Run the advanced search: {{\"Test field\" in cascadeOption(\"First\")}}\r\nThe two issues \"No child\" and \"Has child\" should be found.\r\n# Run the advanced search: {{\"Test field\" in cascadeOption(\"First\", none)}}\r\nOnly the \"No child\" issue should be found.\r\n# Run the advanced search: {{\"Test field\" in cascadeOption(\"First\", \"None\")}}\r\nOnly the \"Has child\" issue should be found.\r\n\r\nThe JQL error message says \r\n\r\n{quote}\r\nIncorrect number of arguments specified for the function 'cascadeOption'.

This means that the error message should also be updated.

The example is selecting all status codes except for closed and on hold status codes.\r\n\r\n1)  It is very frustrating trying to select multiple when the number of items is larger than the dropdown list since the list keeps reorganizing and you lose your position where you left when trying to select multiple items..\r\n\r\n2) You need to keep scrolling back to select your next status value.\r\n\r\nI attached a mp4 video showing the issue.\r\n\r\nMy personal suggestions are\r\n1) Do not move the selection to the top of the list until the next time the dropdown list is opened.    The user continues selecting until either the user moves the user outside the dropdown area (for a long enough period of time or clicks outside the dropdown window.\r\n\r\n2) or open the selection area showing all the status codes so no scrolling will be necessary\r\n\r\n1) Provide an reverse selection similar to the clear selection to minimize the number of items that needs to be selected.\r\nThis is not an advanced item when you want to see all issues not closed.\r\n\r\n",
