When an issue is created by a customer using the portal, these sub-tasks are visible as requests in the portal. Notification emails are also sent for the sub-tasks, resulting in 3 email notifications per request. \n\nWe've tested the post functions with Bob Swift's Create on Transition plugin and Script Runner and believe this may be a bug in Service Desk. \n\nI've attached two screenshots. The transition screenshot shows the Service Desk request panel for a sub-task created via the post function. The manual screenshot shows the panel for a manual sub-task.\n\nWe do not see this behavior when sub-tasks are created manually by a Service Desk agent.",

Due to its screen scheme, issue type B has a \"Default\" screen and a screen for the \"Create Issue\" operation.\nField C is availble in the \"Default\" screen but is not removed from the \"Create Issue\" screen. Field \"C\" might, for example, be the field \"Fix Version/s\", which is not necessary when creating a new issue.\nHowever, I want field C to be visible for the customers inside the Sevice Desk customer portal. Therefore I want to add field C inside the Service Desk settings (Service Desk > Request type > Request type A > Edit fields > Add a field). But field C does not appear inside the selection. Apparently, only the fields configured for the \"Create issue\" screen appear here, even though the field selection for the request type is used for all operations inside the customer portal.\nIs this working as intended or a bug? If it is w.a.i., what is a possible workaround to not see field C when creating issue type B inside JIRA but to see field C inside the customer portal?\n{quote}\n\nHe would like  the customer portal not to follow the JIRA specified screen scheme.",

Now they will have to click on their own profile to see their own user page\n\nh3. Solution\n* Having a simple greeting message, i.e. Hello [username] or Welcome [username] on the JIRA Service desk Customer Portal. \n* Also have a small greeting message at every page of the Customer Portal which clearly shows the username (eg.

This isn't really a Bug or Suggestion, but we need support help with this question:\n\nOur scenario:\n* JIRA is available from the Internet though an Apache httpd web proxy\n* We have a multi-tenant JIRA instance. Each tenant has their own Service Desk\n* JIRA Service Desks are opened up to anyone (anyone can sign up) because the tenants don't know which of their users will access the Service Desk\n\nUsing Apache Allow/Deny directives, we tried to restrict certain Service Desks to specfic source networks (or redirect to another page). For example:\n{code}\n<Location /jira/servicedesk/customer/portal/1>\n  Order deny,allow\n  Deny from all\n  Allow from aaa.bbb.ccc\n</Location>\n\n<Location /jira/servicedesk/customer/portal/2>\n  Order deny,allow\n  Deny from all\n  Allow from xxx.yyy.zzz\n</Location>\n{code}\n\nHowever, this doesn't work because of the Single Page App nature of JIRA Service Desk. That is, if we type the URL directly into the address bar, the Apache web proxy will honor my Deny statements and block as appropriate. But if I link to those pages from directly within the app, the Single Page App bypasses the web server and the pages are not blocked.\n\nWe would like to know if there is some other way to restrict specific Service Desks to certain source networks.\n\nWe would also like to block or redirect the \"Help Center\" page from all users.\n\nThanks.",

They file a Payroll Help ticket using one of the many forms linked to that Issue Type. That issue type is linked to a special workflow my desk is using that fires off a \"Payroll Help Event Created\" event for listeners to consume. Then using the notifications settings, I have the Payroll Help SD Team project role get notified whenever that event is fired.\n\nI have this happening for about 4-5 different issue types for different aspects of the company (we do this one-desk solution so that our non-technical users aren't turned off using the system by having to go to multiple desks). I noticed the new automation feature allows you to send notifications based on issue type, but it's only on a per-user basis. I could conceivably add multiple users, condense my workflows and switch to using the automation feature while managing the user notifications on a per-user basis, but I prefer having the ability to manage all of my users via JIRA groups and/or project roles, as single-user management gets incredibly messy and hard to keep track of.

Expected Results\nAPI call returns an error about the missing agent permission.\n\nh3.

Add an automation rule with the following setup:\n* *WHEN*: Issue created\n* *IF*: Issue matches - Issue Type is \"IT Help\"\n* *THEN*: Transition issue to {{Respond to customer}}\n\n3. Add the \"Attachment\" field to the IT Help type on the customer portal.\n4. Create two issues via Service Desk > Create a Service Desk Request, one with an attachment and one without (the attachment can be anything, I've been using a text file containing the word \"test\").\n\nh3. Expected results\nBoth issues will be transitioned to {{Waiting for customer}}.\n\nh3. Actual results\nThe issue with no attachment transitions correctly, but the issue with the attachment remains in {{Waiting for support}}.\n# The Customer Request view says \"Your request status changed to Requester action Needed\" but the status isn't updated to match: [^request.png] \n# In the database, the status actually shows that its in {{Waiting For Support}}, but the transitions on the issue shows that its in {{Waiting for Customer}}. See [^TransitionsAreIncorrect.png]\n# The transition seems to have activated for a second or less, before reverting back to {{Waiting For Support}}. If you have the JIRA Suite Utilities plugin installed, you can actually see the status *was* in {{Waiting for Customer}} for one second. See [^JSUTransitions.png]\n# Running the Integrity Checker for workflows shows us exactly what the problem is: [^IntegrityChecker.png] the workflow current step have been corrupted by the automation due to the attachment bug. The integrity checker is able to fix it. \n\nh3. Workaround\nRemove the *Attachment* from the Visible Fields form so that users are forced to attach their files after the requests have been created.\nConsidering the same data from the *Steps to Reproduce* section, the workaround can be applied with the steps below:\n# Navigate to the desired Service Desk configuration screen.\n# Go to *Settings > Request Types*.\n# Select *IT Help > Edit fields*.\n# In the *Visible fields* section, remove the *Attachment* field.",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSDSERVER-2087].\n  {panel}\n\nh3. Problem Definition\n\nJIRA Service Desk currently pauses the SLA if arbitrary code is used to execute a custom event, for example a plugin fires one. This can be reproduced by using the Script Runner plugin and executing the below:\n\n{code:java}\nimport com.atlassian.jira.ComponentManager\nimport com.atlassian.jira.event.issue.IssueEventDispatcher\nimport com.atlassian.jira.issue.IssueManager\nimport com.atlassian.jira.issue.Issue\nimport com.atlassian.jira.util.ImportUtils\nComponentManager componentManager = ComponentManager.getInstance()\ndef userManager = componentManager.getUserUtil()\ndef user = userManager.getUser(\"admin\")\nIssueManager issueManager = componentManager.getIssueManager()\nIssue issue = issueManager.getIssueObject(\"DESK-1\")\nIssueEventDispatcher.dispatchEvent(10000, issue, user, null, null, null, null, true);\nImportUtils.setIndexIssues(true);\n{code}\n\nAs a third-party plugin developer interacting with JIRA Service Desk issues I do not want the SLA to be changed if I'm sending a custom event.\n\nh3. Suggested Solution\n\nOnly change SLA for system events.",
