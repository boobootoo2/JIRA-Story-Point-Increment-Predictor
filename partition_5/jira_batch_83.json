I've added 3rd repo \"repo3\", but by mistake not in a subfolder but in a root folder \"Bitbucket\".

Git supports the use of relative URLs however, so when my submodule is on the same host (e.g. Bitbucket), I can refer to it as a submodule, via a URL like '../otherproject.git'.\r\n\r\nUsing relative URLs, when using HTTPS, will not include the username in the URL, and make the submodule available to use for other users of the repository. (the context menu to change the source URL of a subrepository does however allow me to change it into a relative URL, so SourceTree blocks this only when adding a new submodule).\r\n\r\nWhen pulling the repository (which has these relative submodules), via HTTPS, SourceTree does not recognize these URLs either, as it is prompting me to enter the password (for my Bitbucket account) for each of the submodules. SourceTree doesn't recognize the host names for the submodule repositories.\r\n\r\nThis is also causing the git-remote-https.exe process to hang for devs who are pulling from the repository, after a new submodule has been added. Killing this process, and re-pull, is now the only way to get it to work.\r\n\r\nObviously these issues mainly arrise when using Git via HTTPS. When using SSH the need for using relative URLs is lower (as there is no username in the URL), and the authentication does not rely on a cached password.",

Since our company's domain network is slow, I tend to stay connected to the high bandwidth network.  However, if my computer starts connected to the company domain network, I am automatically granted access to some very slow network drives.\r\n\r\nNote I do not have any repositories stored on the network drives.\r\n\r\nIf Windows does not detect the slow network drives (started computer on high bandwidth network), Sourcetree runs spectacularly.\r\n\r\nIf Windows has access to the slow network drives (started computer on company domain network), Sourcetree sees a significant, but still workable slowdown.\r\n\r\nIf Windows detects the slow network drives but no longer has access (started computer on company domain network then switched to high bandwidth network), Sourcetree slows to a crawl and individual components see various delays.  A diff of a file may pop up before the staging area has refreshed.  It may take half a minute for a small repo to open.  If I then manually disconnect from the network drives, performance is restored.\r\n\r\nI assume this has to do with the way Sourcetree or Windows scans the file system.  The mere presence of a missing or slow drive is enough to grind work to a near halt.  It is not so much an issue for me, but it is a performance issue.  Is this a flaw in Windows or could Sourcetree exclude looking at drives that have no repository?",
