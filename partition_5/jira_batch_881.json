And it's been a while since you've done this.\r\n\r\nFirst you go to Projects and select the project you want. Oh wait. No administration functions here.\r\n\r\nThen you go to the Administration tab, then select Project. It pops up a list of projects. Great! There are 3 choices, \"View Edit Delete\". You pick \"Edit\" since you are changing something. Oh wait, it's just the main project metadata (name, picture, etc). This is confusing.\r\n\r\nFinally you go back and you pick \"View\". This shows all the project details besides the main project metadata. Here's where you can actually edit the major settings of a project, not on the \"Edit\" page but on the \"View\" page.\r\n\r\n=====\r\n\r\nSome suggestions for improved usability.\r\n\r\n1) Get rid of the separate \"View\" \"Edit\" \"Delete\" screens and the \"Operations\" column on the \"Administration\" page. Combine them together. All 3 of them allow administrators to modify a project. It's too confusing to remember when I have to use \"View\" to edit a project setting, and when I have to use \"Edit\" to edit a project setting.\r\n\r\n2) For \"Delete\", have a button or link that says Delete Project, but add a note below the button or link that says \"(You will be asked to confirm)\" or something. It's disconcerting to see \"Delete\" and think \"Wait... if I'm not 100% sure, will clicking this immediately wipe the project away forever?\"\r\n\r\n3) On the regular Projects tab, when you select a project, add an \"Administration\" tab for administrators, so that you can modify the project settings from here, and are not forced to go to the Administration->Projects page.",

Your feedback is key to helping us understand how you use JIRA so we can continue improving your experience. We have reviewed this issue over the last few days.\r\n\r\nSpeed and performance are a priority for us. While there is still room for improvement when it comes to load times of the Dashboard, we believe at this point we have made sufficient progress to close this request. We continue investment in performance and more improvements are on ther way.\r\n\r\nThere was significant effort put into transformation of Gadgets to Dashboard Items. There are still some Gadgets pending transformation. The Activity Stream gadget being the heaviest, and it is scheduled for transformation within next 6 months. We expect further high impact on Dashboard performance from this. We also made some improvements in the front-end by removing DCL handlers.\r\n\r\nIn JIRA Cloud instances, Dashboard loading time still sometimes suffers from the fact that for ~25% of user sessions it is the first page after login, and therefore it's affected by cold caches and resources download. The solution here is not to improve the Dashboard anymore but to fix cold caches and resource delivery. We\u2019re working on it.\r\n\r\nTo benefit from the above mentioned improvements we recommend for JIRA Server customers to upgrade to at least JIRA 6.4. Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nDaniel Franz\r\ndfranz at atlassian dot com\r\nPrincipal Product Manager, JIRA Platform\r\n{panel}\r\n  \r\n\r\nDashboard is taking way more time to load than previous version. Everyone noticed it here and it is a major downgrade from 3.13.\r\n\r\nOn our local network, the dashboard is noticeably slower. From outside on SSL connection, it is annoying.\r\n\r\nIt seems like there is an load of HTTP requests made each time dashboard is load. Could'nt gadget be sent with the main page instead of being loaded after?",

Customers that use the 'createusers' option in one of their mail handlers have little control over the amount of users that their instance has. This is because every user created from the mail handler is assigned to the \"JIRA Users\" global permisisons, and therefore, they are granted permission to log into Jira, increasing the number of active users by one.\r\n\r\nFor customers that only want these users to interact by email (and therefore they do not need to log into Jira) it would be useful to have an extra parameter in the mail handler to indicate that the new user should not be granted \"Jira Users\" global permission. \r\n\r\nTo make sure these new users do receive mail notifications when the issue is updated, the browse project permission for the relevant project should be granted to group (anyone)",

This judgment is based on some quick preliminary testing by myself that confirmed what is on [this page of cross-browser compliance testing|http://greenbytes.de/tech/tc2231/#attcdate]\r\n\r\nIn order of level of support it appears to go: Opera 10 is nearly perfect, Firefox 3.5 misses a few edge cases, and then a three-way fail-tie for Google Chrome, Safari 4, and IE 8.\r\n\r\nThey fail in a lot of ways but the big problem is that JIRA is passing back an encoding character set and only Opera and Firefox can handle it. If we use the non-charset encoding format of\r\n\r\n{quote}\r\nContent-Disposition: inline; filename=\"A filename with spaces\"\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nThen Safari at least (I didn't try IE because I'm lazy) appears to do the right thing.\r\n\r\nIn terms of customer experience this means something as simple as filenames with spaces in it don't work the way they expect unless they are using Firefox. And even Firefox has bugs where it handles it differently depending on whether you click on the link directly or right-click and \"Save Link As\".\r\n\r\nObviously we need more testing (I was only checking filenames with spaces, for instance), and some Selenium tests around all of this is needed, but if this is true then I don't see how including the encoding is terribly useful to our customers. It seems like a better approach might be to do browser sniffing and/or check the filename encoding and only send an encoding if it's non-ASCII. Essentially something like what Chris Owen suggests in CONF-2487 which is a Confluence bug report about the same kind of thing.",

      "description": "After purchasing JIRA, I was very disappointed to have to go through a bunch of configuration and troubleshooting and reading of scattered documentation to get JIRA setup for production use with IIS and Microsoft SQL Server. The default installation is not usable in production environments. JIRA installs on an atypical port (8080) and uses a non-production in-memory database. To setup JIRA on a publicly available URL (http://support.mycompany.com/jira) using a production database (Microsoft SQL Server), I had to endure two entirely different (IIS and MS SQL Server) and insufficiently documented series of manual steps that involved downloading third-party components (jtds, isapi_redirect), carefully manipulating a variety of configuration files scattered across a variety of configuration directories, setting permissions in Windows and IIS and MS SQL Server, adding web filters and web extensions, troubleshooting common errors, and so on. Once the steps had been figured out, it was clear that they could be automated with just a few prompts.\r\n\r\nI realize that other customers use Java app servers, Oracle, Linux, etc. But you should fully automate the installation of the most common configurations. If IIS/MSSQL is not common, then I can live with that, but I'm guessing that the vast majority of your customers are running (or would like to be running) on one of 3 or 4 common configurations.",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-19479].\n  {panel}\n\nI installed JIRA on a hosted Windows server that was running IIS and other web sites on port 80. I needed to expose JIRA on a port that was open to the firewall (i.e. port 80) and using a URL that customers would find friendly, such as http://support.mycompany.com/jira. I walked through these two docs:\r\n\r\nhttp://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Configuring+IIS+with+Tomcat\r\nhttp://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Integrating+JIRA+with+IIS\r\n\r\nbut I still had several major issues that prevented the site from working. Please add these steps and troubleshooting items to your IIS integration docs:\r\n\r\nA) Grant Windows ACL permissions to the c:\\tomcat_iis_connector folder. Right-click the folder, go to the Security tab, ensure that you grant Full permissions for the IIS_WPG group (or the Identity used by the Application Pool if it does not belong to the IIS_WPG group). Then click the Advanced button and select this option: \"Replace permission entries on all child objects with entries shown here that apply to child objects\". Click OK.\r\n\r\nTroubleshooting: Ensure that you perform step A if you have any of the following problems:\r\n  1) The ISAPI Filters tab shows a red arrow for the isapi_redirect.dll filter added earlier.\r\n  2) You receive a blank response from your custom URL (http://support.mycompany.com/jira)\r\n  3) A log file is not created within the c:\\tomcat_iis_connector folder when you restart IIS and access your custom URL.\r\n\r\nB) After creating the \"jira\" virtual directory, grant the Windows ACL Read permission to the Internet Guest Account (typically IUSR_servername) or whatever identity you have selected in your web site Directory Security for anonymous users.\r\n\r\nTroubleshooting: If you receive an HTTP 401 (access denied) error from your custom URL (http://support.mycompany.com/jira) then ensure that you have done step B.\r\n\r\nTroubleshooting: If JIRA responds on your custom URL (http://support.mycompany.com/jira) you may see the following error for each of the gadgets: \"Error loading gadget: org.apache.shindig.gadgets.GadgetException: Unable to retrieve gadget xml. HTTP error 500\". This occurs when the JIRA server is unable to resolve the domain name of your custom URL. If your server is hosted or for some other reason cannot resolve support.mycompany.com, then add the following entry to the C:\\WINDOWS\\SYSTEM32\\DRIVERS\\ETC\\HOSTS file:  127.0.0.1  support.mycompany.com\r\n",

One way for Outlook and one way for every other mail client that has ever existed. In the Outlook way we look for the string \"---- Begin Original Message ----\" to know what to strip. However, it appears that Outlook 2007 only adds this when replying to text email. If you are replying to HTML mail, then Outlook doesn't add that. The result is that the Handler can't stripquotes.",

It would be useful if the startup process verified plugin deployment and automatically repeated the process when necessary.\r\n\r\nPossible symptoms of the problems are: missing project settings such as categories, issue type schemes, issue security schemes, field configuration schemes, workflow schemes etc... \r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nEdoardo ",

Also, I just tried to build the jira-fisheye-plugin-3.0.10 tag, which has the jira dependency set to 4.0.0-RC1. This caused a build failure because https://maven.atlassian.com/repository/public/com/atlassian/jira/jira-subproject-plugins/4.0.0-RC1 does not exist. I then tried setting the jira version to 4.0, but this had missing deps as well. I finally got it to build with 4.0.0-Beta5. Just FYI.\r\n\r\nIt seems that the only version of that dep we have published is for 4.0.0-Beta5.\r\n\r\nWe should investigate why we are not publishing this for all released versions, or even if we should be publishing this at all.\r\n\r\nAs to the question of why the FishEye plugin depends on this dep at all, this is what TimP had to say:\r\n\r\n{quote}\r\njira-subproject-plugins is the parent pom for the rest plugin, which is a dependant plugin of the fisheye plugin\r\nso it should be deployed publicly if users want to be depend on the rest plugin (ie. to be able to deploy their own REST end points)\r\nwhich the FishEye plugin does for it's gadgets\r\n{quote}",

They remain in the {{customfieldoption}} table, with references to a {{fieldconfiguration}} (custom field context) that no longer exists (because it was deleted).\r\n\r\nA JQL clause that references the option \"NAME\" will look up all stored custom field options with that name, and attempt to resolve each option to its related field, in order to calculate the context of the clause.

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-19416].\n  {panel}\n\nThis API works, but does not allow you to specify the comment author. It ignores the \"author\" field and instead uses the logged-in user. Naturally, in an integration scenario, you dont want to use the logged-in user but rather be able to specify who has made the comment.\r\n\r\nPlease not that not all SOAP APIs work in that manner: the createIssue API (which is very similar in nature to addComment) takes in a \"reporter\" field and uses it to capture the user who reported the issue, this gives the external application the ability to correctly create an issue on behalf of a user, while such ability does not exist when you try to create a comment, thus, making the createComment API somewhat pointless. I think this can be easily fixed by adding a new \"reporter\" attribute to the RemoteComment object or using the existing \"author\" or \"updateAuthor\" attributes.\r\n\r\nThis is a major issue for our company as our service depends on integration with Jira over SOAP. Thank you for your attention.",
