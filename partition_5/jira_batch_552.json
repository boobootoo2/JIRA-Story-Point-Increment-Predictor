To do this, go to User management > User directories.\n* When configuring who can authenticate to JIRA via Crowd, if you have customers that do not belong to groups, make sure you select the setting that allows all users in the directory to authenticate. See [Mapping a Directory to an Application|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/CROWD/Mapping+a+Directory+to+an+Application].\n\nFor more information, please read: [Managing customers|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/SERVICEDESK/Managing+customers#Managingcustomers-NotesonusingAtlassianCrowdtomanagecustomers]\n{panel}\n\n{panel:title=Crowd Licensing|borderColor=#ccc|titleBGColor=#cccccc|bgColor=#ebf2f9}\nAtlassian Crowd is a separate product and therefore if you wish to use Crowd for SSO, you will need to purchase a Crowd license that is large enough for your user base. Customers in JIRA Service Desk, while free in JIRA Service Desk, will consume a license in Crowd.\n{panel}\n\nWhen you enable [Crowd SSO for JIRA|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/CROWD/Integrating+Crowd+with+Atlassian+JIRA#IntegratingCrowdwithAtlassianJIRA-2.2ConfigureJIRAtouseCrowd'sAuthenticatortoenableSSO(Optional)], you will only be able to authenticate as users from the Crowd server and users from the internal JIRA directory can\u2019t authenticate to access JIRA. This means both paid JIRA users, agents and free JIRA Service Desk customers need to be users in Crowd. \n\nIt\u2019d be useful to create a new authenticator that knows about JIRA Service Desk Customers in the internal JIRA directory and authenticate them differently from JIRA users. \n\nSuch a change would require changes to Crowd, JIRA and JIRA Service Desk. There are currently no plans to undertake this work in the next 6-12 months. If you are interested in this feature, please watch, vote and add a comment with your specific use case.",

Summary\nIn JIRA Service Desk, you are able to see a list of customers from the *People* tab as described in the documentation: [Managing customers|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/SERVICEDESK/Managing+customers]. This pages shows a dynamically updated list of up to 20 Customers. \n\nThis feature request is to allow for the ability to show ALL customers in a single list, or alternatively, have pagination so that all Customers can be found in a list. \n\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\n\n# Set up a Service Desk Environment with more than 20 Customers. \n# Attempt to show the complete list of customers. \n\nh3. Expected Results\n\nThere should be a method to show the complete list of Service Desk Customers, Functionally, this could work similar to the *User Browser* in JIRA with both:\n* Pagination\n* \"Customers Per Page\" dropdown option.\n\nh3. Actual Results\nNo method to t list all customers easily exists.\n\nh3.

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSDSERVER-1215].\n  {panel}\n\nCurrently it is not possible to change tickets (from imported projects) into customer request. It is now possible to manually change the Request Type; but it is currently not possible to change the *Channel* to Portal. By default; all tickets created in JIRA are not viewable in the Customer Portal.\n\nI believe that users should be given the ability to change the *Channel* from JIRA to Portal (and vice versa). While it is possible for the agent to raise a request via portal view in behalf of the customer; the same cannot be said if the project are imported into JIRA. \n\nThe *Channel* custom field should be made editable so that users can transition and change all the tickets to Portal. When the ticket is assigned to a customer; the customer will be able to see it in their portal.",

This handled by another team as a single Problem issue. When the underlying Problem is solved, the linked Incident tickets should automatically get a comment alerting the agent that they can close the issue - or even just automatically close the Incident issues on behalf of the agent.\n- *Developer/Application Support*: Many Support Requests may occur when users hit a certain problem, eg. they can't log in. This may be recorded in a Development project as a Bug. Once the Bug is fixed and the fix is deployed, the linked Support Requests should automatically get updated.\n\n{panel:title=Update as of 26 November 2015|bgColor=#f5f5f5}\nHi everyone,\n\nThe requested functionality is now available in Altassian Cloud. You can go to automation section and configure it for your needs \n(see https://confluence.atlassian.com/cloud/18-october-2015-to-24-october-2015-780870807.html for more details)\n\nThe pre-configured rule is coming soon, stay tuned to our release notes. \n\nOnce again, thanks for supporting JIRA Service Desk!\nGosha Nguyen\nJIRA Service Desk Product Management\n{panel}\n",

And it also means that it will appear on issue creation screen, and make it editable by the customers.\n\nFor example, I'd like to show the due date of a request to customers, but only Agents should be able to set it. \n\nh3. Suggested Solution\nAdd an option to allow the field to be editable by the customer or not. If the field is editable, it should appear in the Create Request screen -- otherwise, it would be read-only.",

At the beginning of an agent's day, they should be able to see a list of all issues they ALREADY have planned for the day (barring any SLAs that begin and end within that same day). This will allow the agent to easily calculate the 'remaining estimate' and ensure it does not exceed their expected hours worked for the day. If the remaining estimate exceeds the individual's expected work hours, the agent will need to call on collaborators or other agents to ensure SLAs are not violated.\n\n2. JQL already allows searching for due dates by \"end of day\" and \"end of week\" (or start of day/week). SLAs as essentially due dates (more specifically, due times) so it would make sense that people would need to search by the same criteria.\n\n3. There is a psychological element for staff to seeing a static 'end point' for the day. This is why teams \"Standup\" - to envision the day before they attack tasks. Even if they continue working on additional items, they can at least hit a major mile marker knowing they've met the day's goals.\n\n4. Our team uses a combination of SLAs and Due Dates. We find that SLAs are either too limiting or too flexible in certain scenarios. For example - perhaps a service desk agent is tasked with \"Generate XYZ Report by Friday\" (either for a manager or a customer!) - an SLA is really sloppy for this. You're left with trying to calculate the number of hours before the report is due, and then creating an SLA rule to actually make the count down accurate. This isn't practical.\n\nThus, agents need to include items \"due today\" or \"due this week\" within the same search as SLAs that will expire today or this week as well. Adding \"SORT BY SLA DESC, Due ASC\" to the JQL statement tells agents \"complete today's SLAs, then work on issues _due_ today before moving on to tomorrow's tasks (the next queue).\n\nThe closest I've come up with is \"SLA <= remaining(8h)\" but this means throughout the day, the agent will continue seeing tomorrow's SLAs, and they will never get to issues \"due today\".\n\nIn short, I want to have a \"Today\" queue for staff (so they aren't overwhelmed with upcoming requests, projects and misc deadlines).",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSDSERVER-1025].\n  {panel}\n\nWe use a custom Seraph authenticator / Seraph config to authenticate users against an external Single Sign On process to log in to our JIRA instance.\n\nStandard pages within JIRA (e.g., browsing to a specific issue) correctly respect the Seraph config and redirect unauthenticated users according to the Seraph {{login.url}}[^1^|https://docs.atlassian.com/atlassian-seraph/latest/configuration.html|] parameter.\n\nService Desk does _not_ respect this parameter, and instead, prompts unauthenticated users to log in via it's own custom login page (e.g., {{<server>/servicedesk/customer/portal/1/user/login}}).\n\nThis is problematic for us. Our users who land on the Service Desk provided login page are stuck; their accounts in JIRA do not have passwords set up, so they can never successfully login on this page.\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nSteps to reproduce *expected* behavior:\n\n1. Configure JIRA to use a {{seraph-config.xml}} Seraph configuration that includes a value for the {{login.url}} parameter.\n2. Be logged OUT of JIRA.\n3. Browse to a secure page _not_ provided by Service Desk, e.g., {{<server>/browse/DESK-2.}}\n4. Notice that JIRA redirects you to the login page provided in the Seraph configuration\n\n\nSteps to reproduce *wrong* behavior:\n\n1.

Using JIRA for problem management, you'd want to link your incidents (service desk requests) to problems (JIRA tickets), and would want a similar use-case for reporting on bugs/problems.",
