This includes login and logout all inside Service Desk without never accessing/viewing JIRA itself.\n\nh3.

Your comments, feedback and interviews have shaped this feature.\r\n\r\nA few of you have asked about disabling account creation emails (i.e welcome emails). ---JSD-218--- does not provide this capability as the welcome emails are sent per instance on account creation, not per service desk project. If this is something you are interested in, please vote for and watch the existing suggestion JSD-1708 - Disable Welcome E-Mail to New Customers, for future updates.\r\n\r\nEnjoy customizing your project's email notifications!\r\n\r\n\u2014 JIRA Service Desk Team\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n{panel:title=Atlassian status as of 27th Sep 2016}\r\n{panel}\r\nHi all,\r\n\r\nGood news!\r\n\r\nWe're moving out of beta and giving all of you on Cloud the ability to customize your customer notifications.\r\n\r\nGo to *Project settings > Customer notifications* and you should see our new feature enhancements. Now:\r\n * You can craft custom notification content using free text and variables to include dynamic information from an issue.\r\n * You can customize your email subject using free text and variables to include the issue key and summary.\r\n * You can enable or disable our default notifications with a simple checkmark.\r\n * You can finely control when custom notifications get sent out using automation rules. Go to *Project settings > Automation* and try out the *Send email* THEN action.\r\n\r\n[Read more about managing service desk notifications.|https://confluence.atlassian.com/servicedeskcloud/managing-service-desk-notifications-732528936.html]\r\n\r\nWe will provide these capabilities to our Server applications, when they are ready.

Stay tuned!\r\n\r\nThanks again for your patience, and we\u2019ll keep you posted.\r\n\r\n\u2014 JIRA Service Desk team\r\n{panel:title=Atlassian Status as of 11th Aug 2016}\r\n{panel}\r\n{panel}\r\n\u00a0\r\n{panel}\r\nHi all,\u00a0\r\n \u00a0\r\n Just want to provide a quick update regarding email customisation. The current beta program is going great. We have received lots of feedback from our beta customers and are making improvements to the feature from the feedback.\u00a0We are currently working to add an intuitive UI for variable substitution and also building out multi-language support.\r\n \u00a0\r\n This feature will be available to both cloud and server when it ships.\r\n \u00a0\r\n \u2014 JIRA Service Desk team\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n{panel:title=Atlassian Status as of 9th May 2016}\r\n\u00a0\r\n{panel}\r\nHi,\r\n\r\nJust to give you guys an update - we are continuing development on this feature request, focusing on the ability to customise the email content and control when emails are sent out.\r\n\r\nAs the feature will take considerable time to deliver in it's entirety, we plan to run an early access program so interested customers can try out some of the aspects of this feature sooner and give us feedback.\r\n\r\nThe beta program will only be available on JSD Cloud and we plan to periodically add more people to it as more aspects of the feature are built out. If you are an admin of your JIRA instance and are interested in participating in the beta program, please register your interest by filling out this form: [https://jsd-beta.typeform.com/to/Bp7STv].\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n JIRA Service Desk Team\r\n{panel:title=Atlassian Status as of 30th April 2016}\r\n{panel}\r\nWe understand that many of you are waiting for this feature and we are well aware that this is the #2 top voted issue on JSD.\r\n\r\nWe are focusing on the ability to customise:\r\n - the email content using variable replacement and fixed text, including providing different email text based on language\r\n - the email subject, as a combination of free text, issue summary and issue key\r\n - the email recipients\r\n - the ability to control when notifications get sent out, using simple on/off toggling as well as more complex automation rules\r\n\r\nWe have started development work on this feature. Unfortunately the JIRA platform doesn't currently provide the ability to configure email templates through the UI and our team has run into unanticipated complexities in trying to make this happen. This is a sizeable feature and it will take considerable time for us to deliver it - but we are working on it.\r\n\r\nWe are aiming to run a beta program so that early adopters on JSD Cloud can opt-in to try parts of the feature sooner and give us feedback. We will post more information about the program and start collecting details of those that are interested in a few weeks.\r\n\r\nJIRA Service Desk team\r\n{panel:title=Atlassian Status as of 5th February 2016}\r\n{panel:title=Atlassian Status as of 5th February 2016}\r\n{panel}\r\n{panel}\r\nThanks all for your swift feedback!\r\n\r\nWe do want to provide the ability to do all four things but as this will take some time to build we wanted to see if there's any way we can internally prioritise to deliver aspects that would be most valuable to our customers.\r\n\r\nFrom the feedback so far it's clear that customising the email content (including the subject) stands out as something many of you would like to see delivered first.\r\n\r\nWe understand that many of you need to make business decisions based on when this feature will be available but unfortunately we don't have an ETA we can share. Internally our product development approach is to build and test a few prototypes of the full solution and then start work on a phased approach to delivering that to production. We generally do not communicate ETAs about feature development because there are many factors that can set us back to square one, eg. usability tests that disprove a concept, performance bottlenecks we didn't anticipate, etc. We don't want to set expectations that can drastically change. What we can tell you right now is that we have built a prototype and are planning production development.\r\n\r\nAs some of you have noted, we do ship to Cloud first - and this is something we will continue to do - as there are far fewer permutations to test and QA on our Cloud infrastructure. It's not that we don't want to provide the functionality to server customers, rather, we want to provide the capabilities as soon as they are ready - and in general they are ready for Cloud much sooner than Server.\r\n\r\nThanks again for providing feedback on this issue - we will keep you posted with any further updates from our end.\r\n\r\n-JIRA Service Desk team\r\n{panel:title=Atlassian Status as of 4th February 2016}\r\n{panel:title=Atlassian Status as of 4th February 2016}\r\n{panel}\r\nHi all,\r\n\r\nThanks for all the comments.

We make every attempt to be as responsive / up to date as possible on our JAC tickets, but sometimes, the volume of comments / issues make responding to every ticket impossible. However, be assured that we _do_ see and listen to your comments. As much as possible, we try to make updates whenever we have more meaningful updates to provide.\r\n\r\nWe understand that some of you have been looking forward to having this capability for a long time on this, so we appreciate your patience and support over this time. With so many different features, capabilities, and enhancements we can make to the product, I hope you can understand that it is a balancing act for us. What we can promise you is that we are always trying to deliver the best value for all our customers - we've recently released CSAT survey, made improvements to automation, introduced a REST API, made access to KB articles free for customers - all capabilities and suggestions that have also been highly sought after - and with many, many votes as well.\r\n\r\nThe good news is that this is definitely one of our top priorities right now. As was posted in November, this is a feature that we are looking at seriously and prioritising in our backlog. To keep you updated of our internal development for this particular issue - I can let you all know that this is one of the highest priority right now and work has begun on implementing some of this feature. In fact, we have already produced a prototype of some features that addresses the needs we have seen here.\r\n\r\nReading through some of these comments, it does appear that there are quite a few different needs that have cropped up. In the spirit of being iterative and agile, we\u2019d love to understand better from you how we can prioritise for delivery.\r\n\r\nIf you had to pick, which option would give you the most value first?\r\n\r\n1. The ability to control when notifications get sent to customers\r\n 2. The ability to set a custom header/footer text on email notifications (eg. Powered by ACME IT)\r\n 3. The ability to control the text content of notifications (eg. when a request gets created have a custom thank you message, when a comment gets added have a different message, etc)\r\n 4. The ability to control the visual style of the email (eg. colours, fonts, CSS)\r\n\r\nThis would greatly help us figure out how we go about delivering this capability.\r\n\r\n-JIRA Service Desk team\r\n{panel}\r\n{panel:title=Atlassian Status as of 10th November 2015}\r\nHi all,\r\n\r\nThanks so much for your votes and comments on this feature request. Since our last update - we\u2019ve heard lots of feedback about what you\u2019re desiring from JIRA Service Desk, so we thank you for your input.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019re always committed to building the best product for our customers, and have been iterating (based on your feedback) on many different features - including automation, knowledge base, customer portal, just to name a few. We understand that being able to customise the customer notifications is something that you\u2019re looking for, so we thank you for your patience and understanding, especially to those that have offered different workarounds, tips, or suggestions.\r\n\r\nRegarding this particular feature suggestion, we\u2019ve been trying to strike a good balance between keeping things very simple with great out of the box capabilities, versus additional levels of complexity for customisation. We\u2019ve started this with improving how JIRA Service Desk works out of the box - with better notification templates, a notification scheme that was smarter and less noisy, and better defaults to support agents to craft a faster response.\r\n\r\nAlthough this has been successful for some of our customers, it\u2019s also clear from your feedback in this ticket that this isn\u2019t enough. We will like to continue working on this, and it is on our roadmap to address soon.\r\n\r\nWhilst I\u2019d like to give you a clear timeframe for when we can deliver this, unfortunately, I cannot make such indications at this time yet.\r\n\r\nThanks again for your patience, and we\u2019ll keep you posted as we progress.\r\n - JIRA Service Desk team{panel}\r\nUser case to explain what is needed:\r\n # I am a Service Desk Administrator for Project XYZ\r\n # I want to modify the email notification message that his user receives when his users submit a new issue into service desk.\r\n # I update the email notification message for the \"create issue\" event to say \"Thank you for submitting to project xyz. Some of our staff is on vacation, please note that service levels are longer\"\r\n # Then I update the email notification message for the \"resolve issue\" event to say \"Thank you for your request. Have a happy holiday! And submit your feedback to this project at [http://feedback/projectxyz]\"!\r\n # John submits a new issue into service desk for Project XYZ, and receives the message \"Thank you for submitting to project xyz. Some of our staff is on vacation, please note that service levels are longer\"\r\n # I resolve the issue, and John receives \"Thank you for your request. Have a happy holiday! And submit your feedback to this project at [http://feedback/projectxyz]\"!\r\n # Richard is a Service Desk Administrator for Project ABC. Richard and Joseph do not want the same email notification message. Richard wants his project to say for the \"create issue\" event - \"Thank you for submitting to project ABC.

We could limit the SLA Details only for Roles that needed to see it.\n\nThe original request from the customer:\nbq. The objective of service desk is to monitor the Service Levels and manage the Help Desk effectively,meet customer expectations and contractual requirements. At the same time, the SLA's should be visible to help desk staff and not to customer role . Few roles of the customer like IT staff required to have the visibility of SLA . With the current capability, we were not able to hide the SLA details. If this and the second question of limiting access to the Service desk managed as Global permissions using Permission Scheme. The service desk usage for customers can be practical. Is there any chance of getting these capabilities in near future. We are actively pursuing the service desk tool as we already hold JIRA. We would be willing to work with your team for any beta testing.",

We use Pareto charts to see where the most issues occur, so that if we solve that problem (software change, training, redundancy, etc.), then we get the biggest return on future call prevention.\r\n\r\nAs we discussed at the conference, it would be great to have JIRA Service Desk support Pareto charts. \r\n If a gadget were a Pareto chart, I would think that it would follow current gadget setup including: Pick the filter you want to use and pick the field to use across the bottom of the chart (example: System, location, root cause\u2026 etc.)\r\n\r\nThe black line is just the cumulative percent up to 100%, where Pareto 80-20 rule: which items together solve 80% of the problems. Chart is sorted left to right by number% of tickets. \"\r\n\r\nCheck the attachment for a visual representation\r\n\r\nCheck the following links for more details:\r\n [http://wiki.servicenow.com/index.php?title=Pareto_Charts]\r\n [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_chart]\r\n [http://asq.org/learn-about-quality/cause-analysis-tools/overview/pareto.html\r\n\r\n]\r\n{panel:title=Update - 24th November 2020}\r\nWe appreciate the feedback but unfortunately are not considering building this in the near future.

We are currently reviewing all tickets regarding reporting functionality as we build a long-term strategy on reporting capabilities. I'd love to discuss your reporting needs and what we can do to make the holistic experience better. Please reach out to me at [jdcruz@atlassian.com.|mailto:jdcruz@atlassian.com.]\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nJason and the Jira Service Management Team\r\n{panel}\r\nAs of JSD 1.0, service desk reports are just displayed on the web page. The user should be given the option to export both the graph and the underlying report data. (preferably PDF, also Word, Excel where applicable)\r\n\r\nThis became more important when I checked the DB and saw that SLA field information in the database is pretty hard to understand.",

Right now, the customer experience is like we're using two separate systems for this. Links in Example #1 go to the default JIRA UI instead of going to the Service Desk UI for customers.\n\nIt's like we need the ability to create an email handler for a Service Desk -- but I see no way to do this in OnDemand. Is this working as designed or is there a bug with the code that Brad says \"tries to suppress the fact that the reporter gets both a SD email and a JIRA email?\"\n\nAs an additional note, issues created in JIRA via email handlers do NOT show up under the \"My Requests\" view from the customer portal in Service Desk. It's like our email handler is ignoring the fact that we have Service Desk enabled. I wanted to mention that here in case the two issues are related, however I can submit a separate bug report for this particular problem if need be. FWIW, we were a Service Desk Beta user in case that has any implications on our configuration.\n\nOur SEN # is: SEN-2196722\n\nThanks,\n\n-Eric",

Each contract level has a specific set of SLAs attached to it.\n\nBased on this feedback:\nhttps://confluence.atlassian.com/display/SERVICEDESK/SLAs?focusedCommentId=420973375#comment-420973375\n\n...it looks like you can't do that w/ the current SLA tool, without having to do  a huge JQL query for each priority level and contract type combination, for instance \"priority = Blocker and reporter in (company1, company2, company3, company4, company5, etc.)\" where the list of companies is, as I mentioned, hundreds of companies long.\n\nFor us that's a non-starter, so we really need that added.",

See [comment below|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSD-107?focusedCommentId=853509&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-853509].*_\n\nAs outlined in this answer question https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/225223/does-jira-service-desk-have-a-public-rest-api# JIRA Servicve Desk does not currently have a public REST API.\n\nWe do have internal REST resources that we use in the agent view and we plan to expand that into the \"customer portal view\" soon but these do not have the strong API guarantee against change. They are there to support the \"dynamic browser front end\".\n\nService Desk is of course built on top of the JIRA platform so issue creation / retrieval REST APIs are available via standard JIRA facilities.\n\nhttps://docs.atlassian.com/jira/REST/latest/\n\nAs the JIRA Service Desk architect I am intrigued to learn more about about what type of REST APIs people would like and what use cases you are trying to satisfy and how they are more specific to JIRA Service Desk than the current JIRA public REST api.\n\nPlease use this improvement request on JAC (https://jira.atlassian.com/) or send me a direct email on brad.baker@atlassian.com to further discuss what you are after.",
