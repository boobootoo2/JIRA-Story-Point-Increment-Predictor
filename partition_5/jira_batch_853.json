Your input in the comments helps us understand how this affects you and what you're hoping to accomplish with JIRA.\r\n\r\nAt this time, this suggestion is not on the JIRA development roadmap. Please remember that jira.atlassian.com is one of many inputs for the JIRA roadmap. You can [learn more about our process here|https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/110373/how-does-the-jira-team-use-jira-atlassian-com].\r\n\r\nI understand that our decision may be disappointing. Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n Dave Meyer\r\n [dmeyer@atlassian.com|mailto:dmeyer@atlassian.com]\r\n Product Manager, JIRA Platform\r\n{panel}\r\nThe application of the auto-complete renderer to the fix/affected versions field and components field is a welcome addition to Jira.\r\n What would be even more useful is if the auto-complete renderer could also be applied to any multi-select and/or multi-checkboxes custom field.\r\n We've got one particularly large multi-checkboxes custom field that has options added to it at a rate of 1 or 2 options a week. As it stands it causes major screen real estate problems when using \"simple\" searching. \r\n The \"advanced\" searching JQL auto-complete actually already offers auto-complete for the field in question, but for our less advanced users, we'd love to see something closer to the components/versions/labels auto-completion style in the simple searching (and general issue editing/moving) views.\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nThe multi select field renderer can be changed by enabling \"multiselect.frother.renderer\" [dark feature|https://jira.atlassian.com/secure/admin/SiteDarkFeatures!Default.jspa]",

Editing the custom field description will work in a simple JIRA configuration (i.e. one project with one field configuration) but at some point this behaviour changed on me (I think it may have been as soon as other projects/field configurations were added). An update to the custom field description through the View Custom Field page no longer had any effect outside this page.  At this point you must edit the custom field description in all appropriate Field Configurations (System > Issue Fields > Field Configurations and open the proper field configuration)\r\nWhat I find frustrating is that there is no indication of this change and I spent a lot of time trying to understand why what worked before was no longer working.\r\n\r\nI have no issue with updating the custom field description in the appropriate Field Configurations because this provides great flexibility (although could mean a lot of work if you have a complex environment). What I am hoping you can do is something to reduce the confusion when it stops working the way it initially did.\r\n\r\nI would suggest:\r\n* Providing an *option* to propagate the description - allowing you to select which field configurations would be overwritten\r\n* A warning that the change will have no effect on existing field configurations (and therefore screens).\r\n\r\nMy preference would be the first suggestion as I believe it would greatly improve the user experience.\r\n\r\nI hope I have explained this clearly.\r\nRegards,\r\nJon",

The reason that I didn't place this bug into Greenhopper project is that this behaviour happened either with Greenhopper 5.2 and 5.3, integrated with JIRA 4.2. Although Greenhopper 5.2 is not compatible with JIRA 4.2, since the behaviour could be reproduced, I'm thinking that the problem may lie within JIRA itself (since you select the \"Edit in JIRA\" option, which I think it uses JIRA code to handle.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, this is easily reproduceable:\r\n* Went on Planning Board within Greenhopper\r\n* Clicked on a card, options, and selected \"Edit in JIRA\"\r\n* Clicked on the component Dropdown menu\r\n\r\nIn IE (8.0.6001) and in Chrome, the dropdown menu don't render correctly (in Chrome, it don't render at all). However, in Firefox, it renders as it should.\r\n\r\nThis behaviour was discovered through this ticket: https://support.atlassian.com/browse/EHSP-10867\r\n\r\nCheers\r\nThiago Prisco\r\nAtlassian Support\r\n",

David's description here is in line with the JIRA PM team's current thinking about subtasks. We want to strike a balance between more flexible parent-child hierarchies and the reasoning in Scott's original comment that having separate issue types allows for different sets of fields in the subtask.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, I don't expect us to address this for quite a while. We will update this issue as soon as we can confidently project a release.\r\n\r\nPlease remember that jira.atlassian.com is one of many inputs for the JIRA roadmap. You can [learn more about our process here|https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/110373/how-does-the-jira-team-use-jira-atlassian-com].\r\n\r\nI understand that our decision may be disappointing. Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nDave Meyer\r\n[dmeyer@atlassian.com|mailto:dmeyer@atlassian.com]\r\nProduct Manager, JIRA Platform\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\nTo create what should be a simple parent-child relationship between 2 issues in JIRA, you need to define a UNIQUE sub-issue type for every single type of child issue you might want.\r\n\r\nSo lets say I have existing issue types Dev Task, Ops Task, Future Planning, QA Task, Documentation.  And I want to create a parent Documentation issue that has sub-issues for each of my depts that will be contributing:  Dev Task, Ops Task, QA Task.  I now have to create a whole new sub-issue (\"sub-task\") type for each of these just so I can create a proper parent child relationship between my parent issue and sub-issues.  And for each sub-issue, I have to duplicate all my previous work on the main issue types with similar names and assign all the right field configs/screens/etc, and when searching for Eng Tasks, I now have to search for both Eng Tasks and Eng Sub-Tasks.\r\n\r\nLets get rid of the concept of \"sub-tasks\" entirely, and express parent-child relationships between issues as just that -- defining a relationship -- not entirely new issue types.",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-22932].\n  {panel}\n\nHi,\r\n\r\nI just upgraded from JIRA 4.1.1 to 4.2.\r\n\r\nIn 4.1.1, when I clicked on the \"Comment\" button at the top of the window and entered a long comment, the comment window would automatically expand so that I could see a lot of the context. In 4.2, the size of the Comment window is quite small making it difficult to enter longer comments.\r\n\r\nFrom http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRA-22046, I understand that this change in behavior was intentional. However, it is not appreciated. Our users typically add long comments and it is annoying to have to scroll all the way to the bottom of the issue to get an auto-sized comment window. The is especially true in our installation, where we have the comments sorted in descending order. The newest comment is not at the bottom of the window. It is closer to the top.\r\n\r\nIn the future, can you allow the behavior of the comment window to be a user-selectable/customizable setting? Failing that, how 'bout allowing adminstratrators to set the behavior? Or, perhaps, put a buttion next to the comment window which allows the user to allow the window to expand if they so desire?",
