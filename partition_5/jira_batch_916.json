      "description": "We get more support requests than we ought to from customers who want to export the XML of a workflow, however they have problems because they do it by:\r\n# clicking on the XML link in Internet Explorer\r\n# IE displays the XML, however it puts extra \"-\" characters in the XML\r\n# the user then copies the XML and saves it to a file, however it also contains the extra \"-\" characters\r\n# the import fails because of the extra \"-\" characters\r\n\r\nCould we modify the user interface to make it harder for a user to have this problem?\r\n\r\nA few possible solutions:\r\n\r\n1. Change the XML link to do the same as Backup Data to XML works. That is, prompt the user for a file location, and save the file there for them. This has these disadvantages:\r\n- the user will need System Administrator privilege, not just Administrator, because they will have to access the server file system\r\n- the file can only be saved to the server, not to the client computer\r\n\r\n2. Change the text of the link from \"XML\" to something like \"XML (right click and save to file)\". Might help, but I suspect it will just confuse some users.\r\n\r\n3. When they click on the XML link, take them to another screen which shows the XML in a text field. This gets around IE seeing the XML MIME type and displaying it. In the same page, under the text field, have a link to download the XML, and have text saying to right click on the link and save it to a file. This way the user can either safely copy and paste the XML, or save the XML directly to a file.\r\n\r\nI like option 3 best, but I'm open to alternative suggestions.\r\n\r\nNote that simply changing the MIME type of the workflow XML to something other than XML in order to \"fool\" IE is probably not an option, as Chris assures me that IE ignores this and displays it as XML anyway, in the same way as if you change your viewer for the XML MIME type to be something other than IE, IE ignores you and displays any XML anyway.\r\n",

These two capabilities should have distinct permissions. The current mixup drastically reduces the usefulness of granting permissions to \"Reporter\" and \"Current assignee\". A distinct \"View project\" permission should be required before any other permission is considered. The current \"Browse projects\" permission could be renamed to \"Browse issues\".\r\n\r\nCurrently if you grant \"Browse project\" to \"Reporter\", ALL users can see ALL projects, even those where they have no role. Of course you can create a permission scheme per project, but that nullifies the whole point of having permission schemes.\r\n\r\nThis subject has been extensively discussed previously (JRA-4093, JRA-4935, JRA-8950, JRA-11881, JRA-14307). A fix is identified in JRA-14307. It's great to have a patch, but much better to solve the underlying problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Workaround* \r\nThis might help in some cases : https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Current+Reporter+Browse+Project+Permission.",
