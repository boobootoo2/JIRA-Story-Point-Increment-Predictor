It displays all the data as required on web/HTML page but when I export the same report in any other format like XLS; lot of required values gets changed. For example: Original/Remaining Estimate and Time Spent appears in Person Days on Web/HTML page but the generated report for the same displays all the values in seconds. And it takes effort (little) to convert these values to Person Days.\r\n\r\nThis is very small but basic enhancement which I think needs to be there if we are using JIRA as our project management tool or its data/values to create our Project plan.\r\n\r\nI would appreciate if you could spare time and though on this proposed enhancement.\r\n\r\nThanks for your time and efforts.  \r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nSAMUEL JOSEPH | Sr. Lead QA | GlobalLogic Inc",

      "description": "Earlier this week I corrected a minor error in the JIRA Installation Guide, where the generic [Server Comparison|http://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/docs/latest/servers/index.html#Which+server+should+I+use%3F] said that we support Weblogic 7.0 and 8.1, but the [Weblogic specific guide|http://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/docs/latest/servers/weblogic.html] says that we also support 9.1. (I added 9.1 to the generic comparison page.\r\n\r\nI have just noticed that the generic page suggests using the latest Tomcat 5.0 release, but the Tomcat 5.5 guide says that we ourselves now use 5.5.9 in the standalone version. This needs updating.\r\n\r\nIt strikes me that we have an ongoing documentation maintenance issue while we have information about supported versions in both places - i.e. in the generic guide and in the app server-specific guide. Could we perhaps restructure the documentation in some way so that this information is only in one place, probably in the vendor-specific guide.\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\nIan",

Your input in the comments helps us understand how this affects you and what you're hoping to accomplish with JIRA.\r\n\r\nAt this time, this suggestion is not on the JIRA development roadmap. For the specific use case described below (users creating support tickets) we recommend [JIRA Service Desk|https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/service-desk], which is built for internal support on JIRA. For other types of customization, please check out the add-ons mentioned in the comments ([Enterprise Mail Handler for JIRA|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.javahollic.jira.jemh-ui] and [Email This Issue|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.metainf.jira.plugin.emailissue]).\r\n\r\nPlease remember that jira.atlassian.com is one of many inputs for the JIRA roadmap. You can [learn more about our process here|https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/110373/how-does-the-jira-team-use-jira-atlassian-com].\r\n\r\nI understand that our decision may be disappointing. Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nDave Meyer\r\n[dmeyer@atlassian.com|mailto:dmeyer@atlassian.com]\r\nProduct Manager, JIRA Platform\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\nCurrently, under User Default Settings, Jira allows you to decide whether users should be notified of their own changes.  We've found that it is absolutely necessary to have that setting set to \"NO\" -- that is, users should NOT be notified of their own changes.  Otherwise, entirely too many notifications are sent out.  This creates an issue, however.  Our users are accustomed to receiving an acknowledgment that their support emails have been received.  We cannot figure out a way to have such an email sent out from Jira while the \"Notify users of their own changes?\" setting is set to \"NO\".",

While I understand the need to have a valid summary, in a helpdesk situation users often send quick support emails and forget to put in a subject line.  Right now, there's no automated feedback that curbs that behavior.  Furthermore, most users don't have very descriptive subjects for their support issues anyway.\r\n\r\nI would rather have to have our support techs edit a bunch of tickets that come in with \"(no subject)\" text as the summary than to have those tickets go into limbo.  We do have someone who gets the \"EMAIL HANDLER: Error\" emails (which is not well documented, btw), but that increases the time it takes to address an issue and does nothing to help us change users' behavior.\r\n\r\nUltimately, I'd rather have the handler accept the emails and use a standard (maybe even user-configurable) phrase such as \"(no subject)\" as the summary for those issues.  Having users get a failure notice (as mentioned in issue JRA-2456) would be an acceptable, although not as desired, alternative.  Having the ability to toggle between the two and possibly the current behavior would be ideal.\r\n\r\n",

Which means I have an issue for version 1.3.0, and when I create version 1.3.1, I want to include all issues that were marked to be automaticly assigned to all version above.\r\n\r\nThe root of my request is about assigning to all version and above (including the ones not created yet). This is basic and follows real world...: if you don't fix some bug, it gets in the next version automaticly (in real world) and so it should be modelled this way in Jira (if the user selected this hypothetical option).\r\n\r\nThanks",

Some of the issues appear to have been \"moved\" into other projects(even though we didn't explicity move them) \r\n2. Some of the issue types across all projects did not migrate across.  They suddently couldn't be found in issue navigator so I organised a full re-index of JIRA and then they appeared again and I was able to manually migrate the existing issues across.\r\n3. Some of the workflows in existing issues appear to have broken. You cannot use them, although if you create a new issue the workflow is fine in that new issue.\r\n\r\nThis seems to be extremely \"buggy\" behaviour from JIRA.

For example, we need to know the Business Name, the Manager's name, the Franchisee's name, The phone number, and the fax number of the business reporting the problem. Obviously we don't want to make these Issue fields because we don't want to record the same information each time that business reports a bug!\r\n\r\nWe can add user properties to track the information - great. But the feature is actually quite useless because you can't make these fields available in the Issue screens!\r\n\r\nHow does any user of Jira track these properties of the users? Surely this lack of functionality is a glaring shortcoming of the whole system?\r\n\r\nPlease refer to my live chat session with one of your technicians below earlier....\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nYou are now chatting with Yuen Chi\r\nLeigh Morum: Hi and thanks for taking my call \r\n\r\nYuen Chi: Hi Leigh, how may I help you? \r\nLeigh Morum: We are evaluating Jira as we would like to use it to track issues. The problem we have is that after adding user properties - e.g. Company Name, Phone Number, Manager's name etc - we would like to make these new fields available to the help desk technicians. \r\n\r\nLeigh Morum: I can't find a way of adding these fields to the default screen to either display them to the technician - or to allow editing of the fields by the technician. \r\n\r\nYuen Chi: User properties? May I know what's the JIRA version you are using? \r\nLeigh Morum: It's 3.8.something \r\n\r\nLeigh Morum: The latest one I just downloaded a week ago. \r\n\r\nYuen Chi: Cool. \r\nYuen Chi: I'm sorry to tell you that, currently the user properties feature is reserved for admin use. \r\nYuen Chi: However, what I can suggest is, \r\nYuen Chi: You can write custom field to extract these values, then add them to the resolve issue screen. \r\nYuen Chi: May I know if you have any Java / JIRA API programmers at your side? \r\nLeigh Morum: OK that sounds promising! But I have no idea how to implement. I don't have any Java programmers this side so we're a bit wet behind the hears with this. \r\n\r\nYuen Chi: If that's the case, we can get one of our service partners to get in touch with you regarding this issue. \r\nLeigh Morum: please \r\n\r\nYuen Chi: If you have some techies at your side, you can get them to look at these pages:\r\n\r\nhttp://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/JIRA+Plugin+Guide\r\nhttp://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Custom+Field+Plugin+Module \r\nLeigh Morum: Can someone call me? \r\n\r\nLeigh Morum: +27824530754 \r\n\r\nLeigh Morum: or Skype username lmorum \r\n\r\nYuen Chi: Can I get them to get back to you on Monday? \r\nLeigh Morum: Sure no problem. \r\n\r\nLeigh Morum: Thanks for your help \r\n\r\nYuen Chi: Is lmorum@cosoft.co.za the point of contact? \r\nLeigh Morum: yes that e-mail is perfect \r\n\r\nYuen Chi: Do you mind to give me your company name? So that I can refer this back to my manager. \r\nLeigh Morum: Sure - it's Coherent Software Solutions (Pty) Ltd trading as Cosoft \r\n\r\nYuen Chi: Cool, thanks  \r\nLeigh Morum: ok thanks & cheers \r\n\r\nYuen Chi: Is there anything else that you'd like information on? \r\nLeigh Morum: One last thing \r\n\r\nLeigh Morum: Can I add a custom user field called Phone Number for example - to then be an available field for each user? i.e. without having to add the custom field to each and every user. \r\n\r\nYuen Chi: Based on my technical understanding, yes, this is do-able. \r\nLeigh Morum: Currently you have to go to each user and type in Custom field \"Telephone\" then the value. I want the new field \"Telephone\" to then e available for all users. \r\n\r\nYuen Chi: Oh I'm sorry, do you mean you want to apply the value through JIRA web interface on all users? \r\nLeigh Morum: You know how you currently go into edit a user - you just get the email address and the username. I want to get those two as well as the new \"Telephone\" field. i.e. Without having to add \"Telephone\" as a field property for each user record. \r\n\r\nLeigh Morum: You shouldn't have to type the word \"Telephone\" a thousand times if I have a thousand customer user \r\ns!\r\nLeigh Morum: You should be able to create a custom field called \"Telephone\" and then it's available as a property for all users - not just the one. \r\n\r\nYuen Chi: That's currently not possible in JIRA without customizing it. \r\nLeigh Morum: So it's really just a user property for a single user record? \r\n\r\nYuen Chi: \r\nYuen Chi: For time being and by default, yes. \r\nLeigh Morum: That's a great pity! The whole system looks perfect for our business - but we need to know more than just a username and password when tracking reported bugs or anything else. I would imagine other companies would be in a similar situation. \r\n\r\nLeigh Morum: Is there a way of getting around this issue? \r\n\r\nYuen Chi: Actually, our developers would like to hear from our customers about how this should be used. \r\n",

It is these _special_ versions that I need to be available in a filter that is specified across projects.\r\nBecause we mark a version as released as soon as it is installed on a specific environment (included in the version naming convention), we want to search for unclosed issues that have been fixed on released versions, so that we can easily see what needs to be retested.  The filter for _released versions_ is necessary because it can take a few days before the solution for an issue (from then on marked as resolved) is really installed on the test environments.\r\n\r\n_Special_ versions for affected version\r\n* Any\r\n* No Version\r\n* Released Versions\r\n* Unreleased Versions\r\n\r\n_Special_ versions for fix version:\r\n* Any\r\n* No Fix Version\r\n* Unreleased Versions\r\n* Released Versions\r\n\r\nA comment of mine in JRA-1538 already talks about this improvement.

Most times, when I'm looking for information on an issue, I want to see just the Comments and the Work Logged to get the best feel of what happened with an issue. But I can't view them at the same time, so I have to view two separate \"conversations\" on an issue, which is disjointed at best.\r\n\r\nIt would be great if this interface was changed so that I could selectively add/remove tabs to my current view (i.e., let me click on Comments and then click on Work Log and it would leave the comments listed and add the Work Log to the list).

When I had a look at the transitions of the issue, I saw that the transition is not available in the history list (transitions) of the issue and in the navigator, it still shows the status the issue had before executing the post function!!\r\n\r\nAfter having a look at the sourcecode I recognized that the variable 'store' (type WorkflowStore) is never used! Maybe the example is not complete at all?!? \r\n\r\nBTW, after re-indexing the database (Administration -> Indexing), the navigator shows the correct status! \r\n\r\nThanks in advance!\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nChristian\r\n",
