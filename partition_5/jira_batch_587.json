As part of the JQL->LQL translation process, we sometimes run further sub-queries (for cases like issue status change to/from). These always end up targeting the Jira-wide change-history index rather than the short-lived one created by TemporaryIndexProvider. The end result is that the translated JQL query doesn't work as expected.\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nAs part of an action in response to an issue change event, say a transition to \"In Progress\":\r\n # call `TemporaryIndexProvider.indexIssuesAndSearch(..)` with a jql query that references the change history index. Something like:\r\n\r\n{code:java}\r\n id = <changed_issue_id> and status = \"In Progress\" and status changed to   \"In Progress\"  \u00a0{code}\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nThe action returns the id of a newly-created issue when it is transitioned to \"In Progress\"\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nThe action fails to find the issue in its search results.\r\nh3. Notes\r\n\r\nThis bug initially manifested itself in JSD SLAs not being triggered.\r\nh3.

Problem Definition\r\nOn the page *Issues > Search for issues*, the JQL query is updated with an statement {{ORDER BY <FIELD>}} when clicking on a column header to sort the results by that field. For example, considering the current search is as follows:\r\n{code:none|borderStyle=solid|borderColor=#6A8EB3|bgColor=#F8F8F8}\r\nproject = \"Jira Server and Data Center\" \r\n{code}\r\n\r\nAfter clicking in the column header for field *Created*, which is a system field, the query is updated to:\r\n{code:none|borderStyle=solid|borderColor=#6A8EB3|bgColor=#F8F8F8}\r\nproject = \"Jira Server and Data Center\" ORDER BY created ASC\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nHowever, if the field in question is a custom field, the JQL will be updated with the custom field ID instead of its name. For example, when clicking on a column for a custom field called *Symptom Severity*, the JQL will be updated as follows:\r\n{code:none|borderStyle=solid|borderColor=#6A8EB3|bgColor=#F8F8F8}\r\nproject = \"Jira Server and Data Center\" ORDER BY cf[17130] ASC\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\nChange the behavior to reference the custom field by its name instead of its ID.

Issue\r\n\r\n* Currently, when Jira connects to the Oracle database in the installation wizard, it only has the option of configuring hostname, port, service, username, and password. \r\n* Because Jira doesn't have a way to point to a tnsnames.ora file or manually construct the connection string to utilize either Oracle Wallet OR the Java Keystore (JKS) methods, we are not able to use Oracle Autonomous Transaction Processing, which is very crucial to our business. \r\n\r\nh4.

Suggestions\r\n\r\n* Ideally, during the installation wizard, after you selected \"oracle\" as your DB type, there would be an \"advanced\" button, where when you clicked it, it would allow a user to input a fully formed JDBC connect string. (Or even better, an \"Oracle Cloud\" option which would just allow the user to select the downloaded wallet.zip file, read the file, and select the proper connect stanza)\r\n\r\n* In addition,  when the user clicked \"next\" on the bottom of the DB setup screen that the installer would test for a file named something like 'oracledbsetup.xml'. If the file existed, that the connect string in the file would over-ride whatever data was inputted in the DB setup dialogue and allow us to provide the connection string that way so that we would be able to use Oracle Autonomous Transaction Processing. \r\n\r\n",

Right now, JQL does not have a native way to search for issues that have been moved from another project.\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nIt seems to be something that 3rd party plugins have tried to solve, such as described in [https://community.atlassian.com/t5/Jira-questions/View-issues-that-have-been-moved-from-one-project-to-another/qaq-p/790346]\r\n However to have Jira be able to do this natively would be preferred.",
