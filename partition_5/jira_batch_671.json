      "description": "Unable to select all options in Issue Navigator screen\r\n{panel:bgColor=#e7f4fa}\r\n*NOTE:* This bug report is for *JIRA Server*. Using *JIRA Cloud*? [See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-59412].\r\n{panel}\r\nh3. Issue Summary\r\n\r\nWhen using the drop-down menus in the issue navigator screen, users receive the following prompt: 'X more options. Continue typing to refine further.' This shows up in multiple search fields and can prevent users from finding the option they are looking for if they are unsure of the exact name of that value. It can also cause some values to become un-selectable.\r\n\r\nFor example, when using List View of Issue Navigator, the user has the ability to select fields to add as Columns to the list. The Columns drop down selector can only display 25 fields at any time. In order to see more, the user is prompted with a message as follows: _+## more options. Continue typing to refine further.+_\r\n In the circumstance where a user is trying to search for a value (e.g. \"*Type*\"), but the environment has *more* than 25 fields (including Custom Fields) which have the word \"Type\" as part of the value, the user may not be able to find \"*Type*\" in the list, yet, they cannot refine further by adding more characters; they are only looking for \"*Type*\".\r\n\r\nThis impacts users with a large number of custom fields in their environment, who might stumble into this issue.\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nIn any other field, the search needs to be refined further to select certain values. This is not the cause for other fields, like the inline user picker in the issue view which displays all options. There are two existing feature requests for this issue:\r\n * https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-39700\r\n * https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-44667\r\n\r\nThe value not being selectable can be reproduced in the list view:\r\n # Create one custom field with a specific name (e.g. \"Type\")\r\n # Create at least 25 other custom fields with any combination of characters, *followed by* \"Type\" (e.g. \"Example Type\")\r\n # Go to the Issue Navigator, and be in List View.\r\n # Click the Columns dropdown, and search for \"Type\"\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nThe user should be able to select \"Type\". This could be accomplished by allowing the user to expand the search results without typing (e.g. +_Click to refine further_+)\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nThe user is prompted to continue typing to refine further. Any further typing beyond \"*Type*\" will result in a non-match for the value \"*Type*\", making it impossible to select this value.\r\nh3. Workaround 1\r\n # Rename the custom field to something else which does not cause this issue in the Column search.\r\n # Add this renamed field as a column to the List View in the Issue Navigator\r\n # Rename the custom field back to what it originally was\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround 2\r\n\r\nIncrease the number of fields displayed in the control from the default 25.\r\n\r\nNote, that this only helps if the number of status-named fields is not significantly higher than 25, where increasing the threshold will allow you to easily filter through all status-named fields without cutting off.\r\n # Modify the file\u00a0{{<JIRA_INSTALL_DIR>/atlassian-jira/includes/ajs/list/List.js}}\u00a0as below (after backing up the original file)\r\n find the line below:\r\n{code:javascript}\r\nvar maxResult = this.maxInlineResultsDisplayed;{code}\r\nand modify it as below, for example:\r\n{code:javascript}\r\nvar maxResult = 40;{code}\r\nHere 40 is the new max length of the list, instead of 25. If this is not enough you may increase it further, but too large values can cause other issues related to display, so better to keep this as low as possible.\r\n # Rename List-min.js file to List-min.js.hide.\r\n # Restart Jira, clear the browser cache, and test if you can reach the desired field.\r\n\r\n(i)\u00a0Note that if you update Jira, this procedure will have to be applied again on each node.\r\nh3. Workaround 3\r\n\r\nSelect the required field via developer tools manipulations in the browser. You can manually locate the required input control for the field from the page source code, and enable it by following these steps. In this case, we will do this with the \"Status\" field:\r\n # Perform an issue query or click \"View all issues and filters\" to cause a list of issues to be displayed.\r\n # Click on the \"Columns\" dropdown.\r\n # Scroll to the bottom of the list.\r\n # Right-click on the text \"Continue typing to refine further\". (You can actually right-click anywhere in the Columns chooser, but this puts you close to the tag you're going to be looking for in step 6.)\r\n # Select \"Inspect\" (on Chrome). This should open a browser development window to the right where you can inspect and modify the page's HTML.\r\n # In the \"Elements\" window at the top of the inspection area (on Chrome), scroll down until you see an element titled\r\n {{<select id=\"user-column-sparkler\"...>.}}\r\n # Expand \"user-column-sparkler\".\r\n # Expand \"optgroup label\" within it.\r\n # Scroll down until you find the node <option title=\"Status\" value=\"status\">Status</option> (It may be necessary to click \"Show all nodes\" to see it.)\r\n # Right-click on that node and select \"Add attribute\". Type: selected=\"selected\". The node should now read:\r\n <option title=\"Status\" value=\"status\" selected=\"selected\">Status</option>\r\n # Click \"Done\" back in the column chooser widget.\r\n # The \"Status\" column should now appear in your issues list. It should not be necessary to repeat this.",

Current Result:\r\n* JIRA will process it and mark it as read, but the ticket is not created. The information why will be found on the logs.\r\n\r\nh3. Desired Result:\r\n* JIRA will process it and mark it as read, but the ticket is not created. There will be a notification to the sender that the email has been rejected.\r\n\r\nh3.

      "description": "The incorrect locale name \"en_UK\" in the default JIRA UK language pack causes JIRA to supply an invalid Locale object for itself and for dependent plugins, which results in a wide range of localization failures when users have that language profile selected.\r\n\r\nThe correct locale string is \"en_GB\", as [defined by Java itself|http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/javase7locales-334809.html]. The language pack provided with JIRA should have its suffix changed to en_GB in order to work properly.\r\n\r\nProviding the wrong en_UK locale string causes the following problems:\r\n\r\nh3. Issue #1: JIRA provides two \"English - United Kingdom\" options in language lists\r\n\r\na- If your JVM is configured to start up with the English default locale as follows:\r\n\r\n{code}-Duser.country=GB -Duser.language=en{code}\r\n\r\nthen administrators will see *two* English options when configuring the system default language under Cog->System->General Configuration->Edit Settings:\r\n\r\n# English - United Kingdom \\[default\\]\r\n# English - UK\r\n\r\n!admin-two-locales.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\nThe first choice above will provide a legal Locale object for the UK (since it copies the system default locale). The second option results in an invalid Locale object being provided to the user. (If the JVM is not configured for the UK locale, only the invalid \"English - UK\" locale option will be presented and there will be no opportunity to receive a valid UK Locale object.)\r\n\r\nb- If the system administrator has \"English - United Kingdom\" selected as the system default language as above, then when users go to select a language in their language profile, they too will be able to select either \"English - United Kingdom\" or \"English - UK\" as their language. If the user selects \"English - UK\", the user will receive an invalid Locale.\r\n\r\n!user-two-locales.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nHowever, if the administrator selects any other default locale in the General Configuration page (such as \"English - UK\" or \"English - US\"), or if the JVM is not configured to have the UK as the default locale at all, then users will only see the one *invalid* UK locale (\"English - UK\") in the language list in their profiles, and they will not ever be able to select a correct UK locale either.\r\n\r\nh3. Issue #2: the Locale object returned for the \"English - UK\" locale is invalid and some Locale methods throw exceptions\r\n\r\nIf the user has selected the invalid \"English - UK\" locale, then the Locale object throws exceptions when trying to access some methods.\r\n\r\nFor example, this call:\r\n\r\n{code}\r\nLocale locale = ComponentAccessor.getJiraAuthenticationContext().getLocale();\r\nString country = locale.getISO3Country();\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nthrows a *MissingResourceException* when the user has the \"English - UK\" locale selected. The call works correctly (and returns the expected \"GBR\") when the \"English - United Kingdom\" locale is selected.\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Issue #3: an invalid currency symbol is provided for the \"English - UK\" locale\r\n\r\nIf we ask Java to give us the currency symbol for the user's locale:\r\n\r\n{code}\r\nDecimalFormat decimalFormat = (DecimalFormat)NumberFormat.getInstance(locale);\r\nString currencySymbols = decimalFormat.getDecimalFormatSymbols().getCurrencySymbol();\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nthen we get the correct \"*\u00a3*\" symbol if the user selected \"English - United Kingdom\", but a \"*\u00a4*\" symbol if the user selects \"English - UK\".\r\n\r\nh3. Issue #4: Calendar objects returned for the \"English - UK\" locale report wrong week numbers\r\n\r\nIn the UK, a week is defined as starting on Monday. Additionally, the first week in a year is considered to be the first week which contains at least four days of the year. (Reference: Java Calendar class, and also the defaults in the CalendarData_en_GB class in the JRE). Therefore, in the UK, week #1 of January 2016 begins on Monday 2016-01-04. If the user selects the \"English - United Kingdom\" locale and requests a calendar object with Calendar.getInstance(locale), then this is what they get.\r\n\r\nIf the user selects the English - UK locale, the locale tells us that the week begins on Sunday and that the first week must contain only one day of the new year. If the user has the invalid \"English - UK\" locale selected, Calendar objects tell us that week #1 of January 2016 begins on Sunday 2015-12-27, which is incorrect.\r\n",

Problem Definition\r\nAfter migrate JIRA from 6.x to 7.0.x, the _Created vs. Resolved_ gadget is not respecting the \"Cumulative Totals\" option previously set.\r\n\r\nIn JIRA 6.x, the gadget had the \u201cCumulative Totals\u201d option where you can set \"Yes\" or \"No\", and in JIRA 7.x has a \u201cCollection Operation\u201d with \u201cCount\u201d or \u201cCumulative\u201d options.\r\nIf you set \"Yes\" for the \u201cCumulative Totals\u201d option in JIRA 6.x, after migrate you expect to see the _Cumulative_ option there, however the system is changing it to \"Count\" instead, so you need to manually edit each Dashboard back to the _Cumulative_ option, which can be a pain if you have a quite few Dashboards.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Add a new \"Created vs. Resolved gadget\" in JIRA 6.4.12\r\n# Select a desired project name (e.g TEST) and change *Cumulative Totals:* to *YES* value\r\n# Save the gadget and create a backup out\r\n# Restore the backup to JIRA 7.0.10\r\n# Navigate back to the Dashboard page, you will get the error message below:\r\n{code}\r\nUnfortunately, one or more of your preferences are now unavailable.

Actual Results\r\n\r\nIn JIRA 6, it was configured with _Cumulative Totals = Yes_ but in the latest JIRA 7, it shows errors.\r\n\r\n \r\nh3.

The administrator is not informed of so by any means.\r\n\r\nh3.

Workaround\r\nAt this point, there's no workaround nor fix available for this.\r\n\r\nh3.

Another way to reproduce this bug is to create users in the Jira internal directory, and then migrate them to an \"Internal with LDAP authentication\" directory. When doing that, all the users migrated to the \"Internal with LDAP authentication\" directory will be automatically given a value in the external_id column. Because of that, such users can't be migrated back to the Jira internal directory, unless this column is cleared for them.\r\n",

Environment\r\nCustomers using JIRA 7.0.8 will be affected by this issue and see the broken UI.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\nAccessing JIRA and using large dialogs/modal in JIRA such as Create Issue, Log Work will demonstrate this behaviour as per the screenshot below.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nThe Modals / dialogs should be displayed without overlapping. \r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nDialogs in the User Interface appear broken as per the attached screenshot. \r\n !Screen Shot 2016-01-12 at 3.18.54 pm.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\nh3. Notes \r\nJIRA 7.0.8 has been removed from the available downloads, and is not recognised as a released version on [https://marketplace.atlassian.com] due to this bug. \r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\nIf you have upgraded to JIRA 7.0.8, you can either Roll back your Instance to a previous version as per: [Roll back a JIRA application upgrade|https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiraserver070/rolling-back-a-jira-application-upgrade-749382718.html] otherwise Downgrade your JIRA instance using the steps below:\r\n\r\n# Make a full backup of your environment as in: [Backing up data|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/AdminJIRAServer070/Backing+up+data]\r\n# Ensure JIRA 7.0.8 instance is shutdown.\r\n# Install JIRA 7.0.5 into this environment, but not into the same JIRA Install as your 7.0.8 as this will not work.\r\n# Shutdown the JIRA 7.0.5 instance once it has started.  \r\n# Any customisations and data that you have in your JIRA 7.0.8 environment should be migrated to ensure that your JIRA 7.0.5 has these configurations. \r\n## Copy over any configuration changes that you have made as per our [Upgrading JIRA applications with a fallback method|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/AdminJIRAServer070/Upgrading+JIRA+applications+with+a+fallback+method]. \r\n## Copy over Avatars and attachments to your new instance as in [Upgrading JIRA applications with a fallback method|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/AdminJIRAServer070/Upgrading+JIRA+applications+with+a+fallback+method].\r\n## Migrate any installed-plugins that you would like to install into this JIRA 7.0.5 environment. Note: do not migrate the plugins from your 7.0.8 environment, as this will contain 7.0.8 Add-ons that you should not include.\r\n# Set the flag {{-Djira.downgrade.allowed=true}} as per: [Setting properties and options on startup|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/AdminJIRAServer070/Setting+properties+and+options+on+startup]\r\n# Start JIRA 7.0.5\r\n# When asked for connection information to the database, point to the 7.0.8 JIRA database (if you did not copy the {{dbconfig.xml}} file when copying configuration files.)\r\n# The instance should now start and downgrade the JIRA database data. The JIRA version should be reported as 7.0.5.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or concerns regarding this issue or the workaround provided, please contact [Atlassian Support|https://support.atlassian.com].",

Currently when I click on the Jira logo it always redirects me to Base URL. How can I change the behavior of that? \r\n\r\nFor example: I log on internal url jira-internal.abc.com and when I click on the logo it will redirect me to dashboard and still keep my internal url.\r\n\r\nThanks and Best Regards.\r\n\r\nDung",

      "description": "There is a race condition in Atlassian's OfBiz Entity Engine fork that can result in connections being detected incorrectly as abandoned when they are actually still in use.  This is due to certain allowed changes to object visibility as a result of just-in-time compiler optimizations, with the result that the connection is enqueued as abandoned just before the thread that is using it closes it.\r\n\r\nThe most common manifestation of this is a warning message about an abandoned SQL processor:\r\n\r\n{code}\r\n!!! ABANDONED SQLProcessor DETECTED !!!\r\n\tThis probably means that somebody forgot to close an EntityListIterator.\r\n\tConnection: org.ofbiz.core.entity.jdbc.interceptors.connection.ConnectionTracker$DelegatingConnectionImpl@13af30e\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nThis is particularly likely under heavy use (such as when reindexing) and when the connection is opened and closed in a small function that is likely to inline these operations, such as this from JCHART (leading to [JCHART-462|https://ecosystem.atlassian.net/browse/JCHART-462] as a result):\r\n\r\n{code}\r\n        try\r\n        {\r\n            sqlProcessor = new SQLProcessor(ENTITY_DS);\r\n        }\r\n        finally\r\n        {\r\n...\r\n                    sqlProcessor.close();\r\n...\r\n        }\r\n...\r\n\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nIn the most extreme cases (typically under heavy load) it is even possible for the connection to be closed by another thread before its connection commits, with actual failed operations as a result:\r\n\r\n{code}\r\nException in thread \"TestThread[59]\"\r\norg.ofbiz.core.entity.GenericDataSourceException: SQL Exception occurred on commit (Connection org.hsqldb.jdbc.jdbcConnection@d1b458d is closed.)\r\n\tat org.ofbiz.core.entity.jdbc.SQLProcessor.commit(SQLProcessor.java:211)\r\n\tat org.ofbiz.core.entity.jdbc.SQLProcessor.smartCommit(SQLProcessor.java:362)\r\n\tat org.ofbiz.core.entity.jdbc.SQLProcessor.close(SQLProcessor.java:264)\r\n...\r\nCaused by: java.sql.SQLException: Connection org.hsqldb.jdbc.jdbcConnection@d1b458d is closed.\r\n\tat org.apache.commons.dbcp2.DelegatingConnection.checkOpen(DelegatingConnection.java:605)\r\n\tat org.apache.commons.dbcp2.DelegatingConnection.commit(DelegatingConnection.java:362)\r\n\tat org.apache.commons.dbcp2.DelegatingConnection.commit(DelegatingConnection.java:364)\r\n\tat org.ofbiz.core.entity.jdbc.interceptors.connection.DelegatingConnection.commit(DelegatingConnection.java:66)\r\n\tat org.ofbiz.core.entity.jdbc.SQLProcessor.commit(SQLProcessor.java:205)\r\n...\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nThis is why using a ReadOnlySQLProcessor works around the problem; the read-only connections do not attempt to commit, so the fact that it was already closed by another thread makes no difference.\r\n\r\nFor the technically savvy, there is a reasonably good and detailed explanation of this rather subtle problem in [this blog post|http://www.infoq.com/articles/Fatal-Flaw-Finalizers-Phantoms].  The fix is to reorder the volatile writes and the release of the connection guard in such a way as to disallow the visibility change.",

Summary\r\nJIRA 7 allows for the feature flag: {{jira.downgrade.allowed=true}} to be enabled which will give JIRA Admins the option to downgrade JIRA. \r\n\r\nThis feature is useful when a migration must occur for technical or operational reasons to an older version. \r\n\r\nThe feature is not documented and should be be included in some of the following documentation's perhaps as an include. \r\n\r\n- [Upgrading JIRA applications|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/AdminJIRAServer070/Upgrading+JIRA+applications]\r\n- [Migrating from JIRA Cloud to Server applications|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/AdminJIRAServer070/Migrating+from+JIRA+Cloud+to+Server+applications]\r\n- [Rolling back a JIRA application upgrade|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/AdminJIRAServer070/Rolling+back+a+JIRA+application+upgrade]\r\n\r\nh3. Environment\r\nJIRA 7\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\nThis is a request to document a new product feature. \r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nThe possibility to downgrade a JIRA version should be made publicly available in the documentation. \r\n\r\nThe limitations of this feature such as how far back the instance can be downgraded to should be indicated along with providing some sample usage scenarios.\r\n\r\nh3.

Environment\r\nJIRA 7.0.7\r\n\r\nDatabase Product Name is MySQL\r\nDatabase Product Version is 5.6.22\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\nInstall JIRA 7.0.7 using a MySQL Server Database, follow the Wizard steps (up to setting up Mail ?Notifications) where the instance will fail)\r\n\r\nRestarting the instance initially looks promising, but then continues to fail when accessing Administrative or User Management areas of the JIRA instance.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nWhen Accessing JIRA for the first time, the instance should show the System Dashboard.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nA 500 Error is displayed reporting a SQL Exception \r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\nAfter experiencing the error, restart the JIRA instance. \r\n\r\n- Install JIRA 7.0.5 Instead of JIRA 7.0.7 at this time, \r\n- Avoid using MySQL with JIRA 7.0.7.\r\n\r\nIf you have upgraded to JIRA 7.0.7, you can:\r\n-  Roll back your Instance to a previous version as per: [Roll back a JIRA application upgrade|https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiraserver070/rolling-back-a-jira-application-upgrade-749382718.html]\r\n- Upgrade to a newer version of JIRA. \r\n- Downgrade your JIRA instance. \r\n\r\nDowngrade your JIRA instance using the steps below:\r\n# Make a full backup of your environment as in: [Backing up data|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/AdminJIRAServer070/Backing+up+data]\r\n# Ensure JIRA 7.0.7 instance is shutdown.\r\n# Install JIRA 7.0.5 into this environment, but not into the same JIRA Install as your 7.0.7 as this will not work.\r\n# Shutdown the JIRA 7.0.5 instance once it has started.  \r\n# Any customisations and data that you have in your JIRA 7.0.7 environment should be migrated to ensure that your JIRA 7.0.5 has these configurations. \r\n## Copy over any configuration changes that you have made as per our [Upgrading JIRA applications with a fallback method|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/AdminJIRAServer070/Upgrading+JIRA+applications+with+a+fallback+method]. \r\n## Copy over Avatars and attachments to your new instance as in [Upgrading JIRA applications with a fallback method|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/AdminJIRAServer070/Upgrading+JIRA+applications+with+a+fallback+method].\r\n## Migrate any installed-plugins that you would like to install into this JIRA 7.0.5 environment. Note: do not migrate the plugins from your 7.0.7 environment, as this will contain 7.0.7 Add-ons that you should not include.\r\n# Set the flag {{-Djira.downgrade.allowed=true}} as per: [Setting properties and options on startup|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/AdminJIRAServer070/Setting+properties+and+options+on+startup]\r\n# Start JIRA 7.0.5\r\n# When asked for connection information to the database, point to the 7.0.7 JIRA database (if you did not copy the {{dbconfig.xml}} file when copying configuration files.)\r\n# The instance should now start and downgrade the JIRA database data. The JIRA version should be reported as 7.0.5.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or concerns regarding this issue or the workaround provided, please contact [Atlassian Support|https://support.atlassian.com].",

There's pieces of user documentation around about how to achieve similar things, but it all seems very hacky and I feel that this type of feature would be a huge benefit to the product suite",

I found something really weird about the bundle context (context class of OSGi bundles, which is what Jira plugin really are) : the bundle being called when the ServiceProxyDestroyed exception was raised was NOT the currently deployed plugin version....\r\n\r\nTo illustrate this, I put some debug points in Felix (OSGi framework implementation used by Jira) BundleContextImpl class, in the invalidate() method (called when a plugin is uninstalled), and in the constructor (called when the plugin is installed). I also place a breakpoint in Spring Dynamic Modules ServiceDynamicInterceptor class, which is were the ServiceProxyDestroyed exception is raised. At each of these breakpoints, I took a \"snapshot\" of the bundle context for the bundle being used, and here is what came of it :\r\n\r\nDuring uninstallation of a plugin, in BundleContextImpl.invalidate() method, the bundle context is as follows :\r\n{code}\r\n{org.apache.felix.framework.BundleContextImpl@41676} \r\n m_logger = {com.atlassian.plugin.osgi.container.felix.FelixLoggerBridge@38134} \r\n m_felix = {org.apache.felix.framework.Felix@38135} \"org.apache.felix.framework [0]\"\r\n m_bundle = {org.apache.felix.framework.BundleImpl@41677} \"com.ovyka.jira.tesplugin [180]\"\r\n m_valid = false\r\n\r\nNote the OSGi id of the bundle com.ovyka.jira.tesplugin : 180\r\n\r\nWhen installing the new version of the bundle, here is what I got in the BundleContextImpl constructor :\r\n {org.apache.felix.framework.BundleContextImpl@41793} \r\n m_logger = {com.atlassian.plugin.osgi.container.felix.FelixLoggerBridge@38134} \r\n m_felix = {org.apache.felix.framework.Felix@38135} \"org.apache.felix.framework [0]\"\r\n m_bundle = {org.apache.felix.framework.BundleImpl@41794} \"com.ovyka.jira.tesplugin [181]\"\r\n m_valid = true\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nNote the OSGi id of the testplugin plugin is different : 181.\r\n\r\nNow if i try to use a feature of my plugin, the ServiceProxyDestroyed exception raising breakpoint is hit, and the associated bundle context is :\r\n{code}\r\n {org.apache.felix.framework.BundleContextImpl@41970} \r\n m_logger = {com.atlassian.plugin.osgi.container.felix.FelixLoggerBridge@38134} \r\n m_felix = {org.apache.felix.framework.Felix@38135} \"org.apache.felix.framework [0]\"\r\n m_bundle = {org.apache.felix.framework.BundleImpl@41985} \"com.ovyka.jira.tesplugin [173]\"\r\n m_valid = false\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nNote that the OSGi id is 173 (so not the uninstalled one, nore the newly installed one), and the bundle context is marked as invalid (m_valid = false).\r\n\r\nWhat I concluded from this is that Jira was keeping a reference to every version of the plugin, and was calling one of them, wether or not it was the latest one.\r\nActually, after a little more digging, I found out it was not totally exact.\r\nIn fact, Jira DOES keep a reference to all the version of the plugin, but does not call one of them : it calls ALL of them.\r\n\r\nWhen, after reaching the first ServiceProxyDestroyed raising breakpoint I let the application continue its work, the breakpoint was hit once again, with a different bundle context (180 in the example above).\r\n\r\nAfter that, it is not called anymore, but the plugin feature work is done. Adding a breakpoint on the called plugin method that Jira was trying to execute, I found out it was actually called, with a different bundle context (181 in the example above), which is why no exception is raised, and the work is done.\r\n\r\nSo here is the updated conclusion :\r\nJira keeps a reference to all versions of a bundle (after multiple install/reinstall), and when the plugin is called, Jira calls all of the bundles, one by one.\r\n* For all the inactive versions, a ServiceProxyDestroyed exception is raised (sometimes also ClassNotFound or NoClassDefFound, for classes that ARE in Jira provided classpath (Jira services references by plugins)).\r\n* For the active version, the plugin does its work, without any exception.\r\nSo this exception is not blocking, as it does not prevent the work of the plugin to be done, but may be very dangerous, because if the plugin does not require any OSGi reference, no exception will be raised, and the work may done several times...\r\n\r\nNow what was left to do was to know why all bundles were kept by Jira (increasing the amount of memory used, by the way). I climbed back the call stack from the ServiceProxyDestroyed raising point, and found out the source of the call was an IssueEventListener. After a small test, I found out the reason of the problem, and of course its solution.\r\n\r\nThe reason why Jira keeps a reference to all bundle versions is that, when a plugin adds an EventListener to jira, it has to register it into the EventPublisher :  eventPublisher.register(this);\r\nThis is not a process linked to OSGi. It is done \"programatically\", and none of the OSGi bundle uninstalling processes being aware of this link, the listener is NEVER unregistered from the EventPlublisher, if the developer does not unregister it : it stays in the list of listeners registered in Jira.\r\n\r\nThat explains why my plugin was called multiple times when I was doing an action triggering an IssueEvent. The EventPublisher was calling all of the registered IssueEventListeners, including the ones registered by removed plugins. And this explains also the ServiceProxyDestroyed exception, because when a bundle version is uninstalled, the ServiceProxy provided by Spring Dynamic Modules are actually destroyed, so all the services injected in the uninstalled plugin now are obsolete and linked to nothing.\r\n\r\nThe solution to this problem (actually one of the solutions) is very simple, and is given in your tutorial page (https://developer.atlassian.com/jiradev/jira-platform/guides/other/tutorial-writing-jira-event-listeners-with-the-atlassian-event-library) : Make the listener implement DisposableBean and implement the destroy() method with the line : eventPublisher.unregister(this);\r\n\r\nI think you should emphasize the fact that this is very important, because given the number of pages about this ServiceProxyDestroyed exception around the net, I am not the only one to have missed this point :)\r\n\r\nNow another solution to this problem would be to avoid asking developers to register their listener into the EventPublisher.\r\n\r\nA very efficient way to do this would be to implement the OSGi White Board pattern. When developing a listener, the developer would just have to declare it in the atlassian-plugin.xml (for example, declare it using a <listener class=\"\"/> tag, as it is done for rest endpoints), and Jira would just have to publish it as an OSGi service, with restricted access to Jira core only. Now the EventPublisher, instead of maintaining a list of registered listeners, which as we saw does not work well with the dynamic nature of OSGi bundles, would just ask for all services published under a specific marker interface, for example PluginJiraListener (just an example).\r\nOSGi framework would then give it all services implementing this interface, which are available at the time the call is made by the EventPublisher.\r\n\r\nThis would require a modification of jira core or Jira plugin management plugin, but would avoid this problem and would be a much nicer way to deal with dynamic plugins.\r\nAnd isn't it how this is done in Confluence ?\r\n\r\nWould you consider doing this modification in Jira system ?",

Summary\r\n\r\nWhen trying to create JQL searches for issues and using user fields such as \"Reporter=\" or \"Assignee=\", JIRA is unable to have inactive users appear as selectable options from the auto complete drop down menu.\r\n\r\nThis works correctly for active users, however it seems that when users are marked inactive the auto complete cannot list that user as an option.\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Create a new users 'testuser1' for example\r\n# Assign that user to one or issues\r\n# Within User management, set that user to be inactive\r\n# Go to the Issue Navigator within JIRA and start a JQL search by typing out  \"assignee=test\" (without quotes)\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nWhen typing this out, we would expect the auto complete drop down menu to list all JIRA users that have the string 'test' in their name, including 'testuser1'\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nThe auto complete drop down menu does not list 'testuser1' as a selectable option \r\n \r\nh3. Notes\r\n# This appears to effect both Adavanced and Basic JQL searches.\r\n# If you know the exact username or email address of the user, you can still create functioning JQL queries, the issue here is specifically tied to the fact that JIRA's autocomplete/auto-fill feature does not return any inactive users as selectable options.\r\n\r\nh3.Workaround\r\nTemporarily marking all inactive users as active is one way to work-around this, but this isn't typically a desirable work-around both from a security aspect as well as from a user licensing limit aspect.  It may not be feasible to do this.",

Summary\r\nThe quick search \"Saved Filter\" inside Gadgets is not listing all available filters that match the search criteria. It returns a list of 10 items that match the search criteria and then does consecutive searches over those first 10 items, missing filters that were not included in the first results.\r\n\r\nh3. Affects\r\n* JIRA 7.1\r\n* Dashboard Gadgets\r\n* Confluence Macros with JIRA filters\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Create 11 or more Filters that start with the same word. e.g: \"Filter A\",\"Filter B\", etc\r\n# Add the \"Two Dimensional Filter Statistics\" gadget to a Dashboard\r\n# Search for the 11th filter by typing \"Filter K\"\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nThe Filter is found because the search matches the filter's name.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n* Typing the first name returns 10 filters. Good so far.\r\n* Typing the start of the second word brings no results or a sub group of the previous 10 results.\r\n \r\nh3. Notes\r\n* Doesn't affect JIRA 6.4 and previous.\r\n* Searching for \"K\" in the example, will find the 11th filter but if the site has another 10 filters with the letter K, it may not. Making it unsearchable.\r\n\r\nh3.Workarounds\r\n* Use the Advanced Search to find the filter (not available in Confluence macros)\r\n* Add a unique word to the filter.\r\n* Search for the second word. This will only work if the 10 results for the second word include the filter.",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-59262].\n  {panel}\n\nh3. Problem Definition\r\nWhenever you select a project from the \"Projects\" menu, it brings up what looks like the details view (with the issues list on the left, and the currently-selected issue on the right). You then need to click \"view all issues and filters\" to get back to the List View.\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\nI\u2019d like to have the list view to be the default each time I select a project (to avoid the need to click \"view all issues and filters\" every time I change projects) from the \u201cProjects\u201d dropdown.\r\n\r\nNote: this same question was posted here (https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/15701634/how-can-i-set-the-issue-screen-to-show-the-list-and-not-detail-view-by-default), but there isn't yet an answer.",
