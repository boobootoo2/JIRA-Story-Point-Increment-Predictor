If the headers of the notification emails are updated to include a reply to header without a name attached so they are instead like the below example\r\n{noformat}\r\nFrom: John Doe <jira@example.com>\r\nReply-To: jira@example.com\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nThis means the email still looks the same when viewed in a mail client but when a user replies to it rather than the client seeing itself as replying to \"John Doe <jira@example.com>\" it instead sees itself as replying to \"jira@example.com\"   which means the address book entry it adds doesn't include the name John Doe on it so there is no confusing second entry presented in the compose box the next time the user goes to compose an email to John Doe and no risk of the email being accidentally sent to the JIRA project address rather than John's person email address.\r\n\r\nThe above fix was implemented by the JEMH plugin author for us 3 weeks ago, we have been making use of it in production for the last 3 weeks and it works brilliantly for alerts sent by JEMH (with no problems found by the large number of people we have using our JIRA server).    Unfortunately since we still have some alert email sent natively by JIRA we are still having confusing address book entries being added in some cases when people reply to native JIRA notification emails.     So we are requesting that Atlassian implements the same simple fix natively in JIRA,   we believe as well as helping us it would benefit many of your other customers.\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration.\r\n-J\r\n",

Summary\r\n\r\nAccessing a user profile, for example https://jira.atlassian.com/secure/ViewProfile.jspa, takes a long period of time to return results. If it consistently causes timeouts the Activity Stream may ban it as a provider, meaning streams may no longer return results for a period of time.\r\n\r\nh3. Environment\r\n\r\nA larger instance for example 300,000 issues & 1000 projects.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nBrowse to a user's profile, for example https://jira.atlassian.com/secure/ViewProfile.jspa.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nThe results return quickly.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nThe results take > 10 seconds to return so a timeout is encountered. The below is encountered in {{atlassian-jira.log}}:\r\n\r\n{noformat}\r\n[atlassian.streams.internal.StreamsCompletionService] Registering failure for stream provider JIRA due to cancellation (timeout)\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nh3. Timeouts\r\n\r\nA timeout is triggered when the activity streams are not returned within the default timeout interval. This can be caused by any of the following:\r\n\r\n* The JIRA instance is performing slowly when retrieving results (it may be under load or experiencing a performance problem).\r\n* One of the providers in the stream is responding slowly.\r\n* Something on the network layer is taking a long time.\r\n* The index read speed may be slow (see our [Test the Disk Speed|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRAKB/Testing+Disk+Access+Speed] KB)\r\n* The provider may not be up and running.\r\n\r\nh3. Notes\r\n\r\nIt is possible for certain Activity Stream providers (Atlassian apps or plugin-specific apps accessible through AppLinks) to be banned from returning results if they consistently time out. This bug fix alleviates some impact of that as it will reduce timeouts on the user profiles within JIRA. If a provider is banned, there is not currently any warning of this - the fix to that is tracked in [STRM-2264|https://ecosystem.atlassian.net/browse/STRM-2264].\r\n\r\nAdditionally more information can be found about timeout behaviours in [JIRA Activity Stream returns One or more activity sources were slow to respond and are not included|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRAKB/JIRA+Activity+Stream+returns+One+or+more+activity+sources+were+slow+to+respond+and+are+not+included].\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nPrior to Activity Streams 5.4.x, it's possible to modify the query string using a front-end proxy such as Apache to rewrite it to be higher. This addresses the symptom rather than the cause (which is the change history results take a long time to return from the database). Add the following to the Apache configuration:\r\n\r\n{noformat}\r\n    RewriteEngine on\r\n    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} ^/plugins/servlet/streams\r\n    RewriteCond %{QUERY_STRING} !^timeout.*$\r\n    RewriteRule ^(.*)$ %{REQUEST_URI}?timeout=20000&%{QUERY_STRING} [R,L]\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nIf the provider has been banned, and is no longer returning results, either waiting > 24 hours or restarting the instance will address that problem.",

Once JIRA detects that the indexes are broken, it should try to restore last valid backup and do a background reindex after this succeeds.\r\n\r\nIf it can even send a message when this starts, ends is even better, but that would be an enhancement over the basic index recovery option.\r\n\r\nAlso, please note that I do find extremely counter-intuitive the fact that the restore index asks you about a filename instead of just showing you the latest available one (or a list of them.). This slows you down considerably as you need shell access to the machine to find-out the name of the archive.\r\n\r\n",
