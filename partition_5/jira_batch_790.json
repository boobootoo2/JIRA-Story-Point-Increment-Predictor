[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-30661].\n  {panel}\n\nI would like the ability to have global transitions that cross multiple workflows, and the ability to edit a transition and have it take place across multiple workflows.\r\n\r\nIt is inevitable that projects will have their own necessary workflow but what is common are the transitions that are used, whether it is a custom one, or one that is provided out of the box.  I would like the ability to use a true global transition that would allow me to define specific behavior no matter what workflow is used. Of course, I could retain the ability to have a localized transition for that workflow.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\nAfter running JIRA for nearly a year, we have had a new growth of users, projects, and workflows. It was requested, several times, that we zero out the remaining estimate when closing an issue. Since this change is global, I had to edit each customized workflow to include this post function. That was very time consuming.\r\n\r\nIn the future we plan to introduce software approvals via the workflow. Each customized workflow will have to have all the approval transitions and statuses added. If a change of any kind is needed, each customized workflow using those transitions must be modified.\r\n\r\nIn the above example, it would be great to set true global transitions so that I can add the \"Approved for Beta\" status on the design form, and drag the transition (which I have already set properties, conditions, validations, and post functions for) between my two preferred states. This way, if it was determined that we wanted a new post function to happen globally, I can go to one place, make my change, and have it become active across all workflows that use that true global transition.\r\n\r\nAnother great method is to have sub-workflows. Using the same software approval example; The approval process will start after the Resolved status and before Closed. I would like to add the \"Approval sub-workflow\" to start from the Resolved state. In the design view, I look at my available sub-workflows, select the Approval sub-workflow and drag it to the Resolved state. All the statuses and transitions the sub-workflow contains will be copied over. During the copy I will be prompted to choose to copy locally, or keep the sub-workflow linked globally (global means I modify the sub-workflow - all workflows and projects that use it is changed).  This method goes one step better than global transitions as an entire portion of the workflow can be added and I can maintain a 'change once, apply everywhere' mantra.\r\n\r\nIf there is currently a method to achieve what I want, please let me know.\r\n\r\nThanks!",

Load balancers and reverse proxy devices commonly use the \"x-forwarded-for\" [HTTP header|https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers] to enable logging of the actual visitory IP address rather than the proxy IP address.\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nEnable configuration of JIRA to log the IP address from the \"x-forwarded-for\" header to the access logs.\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nCustomers have reported that modifying the log4j configuration of JIRA is not a viable workaround. Fortunately, this can be achieved using the access logs that are enabled by default in the Tomcat container that ships with JIRA.\r\n\r\n# Edit the file {{JIRA_INSTALL_DIR/conf/server.xml}}\r\n# Insert this line before the line with \"AccessLogValve\": {code}\r\n<Valve\r\n\tclassName=\"org.apache.catalina.valves.RemoteIpValve\"\r\n\tinternalProxies=\"PROXY_IP_ADDRESS\" />\r\n{code}\r\n#* (!) Escape the \".\" characters in PROXY_IP_ADDRESS with a backlash. Example: {{internalProxies=\"1\\.1\\.1\\.8\"}}\r\n# Configure AccessLogValve to accept the substituted IP from RemoteIpValve by adding the requestAttributesEnabled attribute to the AccessLogValve: {code}\r\n<Valve className=\"org.apache.catalina.valves.AccessLogValve\"\r\n    requestAttributesEnabled=\"true\"\r\n    ... EXISTING_ATTRIBUTES ...\r\n/>\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nFor full details see the Tomcat [RemoteIpValve documentation|https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-7.0-doc/api/org/apache/catalina/valves/RemoteIpValve.html].",

We have analyzed this request and found that this bug request is quite wide in scope and does does not fit our current standards for bug reports. At this time we create bug request for specific functions not working as expected, and we can find several more specific bugs like:\r\n* [JRASERVER-67760 Click on ' Add tab ' button multiple times on issue screen configuration will cause multiple requests to be sent when ' Add ' button is pressed later on|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-67760].\r\n* [JRASERVER-67555 Duplicate system fields when creating new issue type screen scheme screen tabs|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-67555].\r\n* [JRASERVER-37267 duplicate issues created when clicking on create button multiple times|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-37267].\r\n\r\nWith this in mind, we will be closing this request and please watch/vote for the scenarios you are experiencing/being affected by, as well as to help us identify any other possible variations by reporting them to our support team.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nRen\u00e9 Chiquete - JAC Champion\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\nCurrently it's possible to click on form submissions multiple times and have JIRA post duplicate data in the database.\r\n\r\nFor example, if a user clicks on Log Work multiple times ( probably due to the server responding slowly ) JIRA will enter duplicate entries.\r\n\r\nSee attached screenshot.\r\n\r\n*Workaround*\r\nProbably the only thing we can do to prevent this is using JavaScript to hide the Post button after the user clicks it",

[See the corresponding bug report|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-30643].\n  {panel}\n\nh3. Summary: \r\n\r\nIf the default {{jira}} workflow is copied and a transition is cloned with a different name, the cloned name will appear in the issue view screen for the transition buttons.\r\nE.g when I clone a transition, and specify a new name, the new transition keeps the old transition's name, so I have two (for example) 'Start Progress' buttons.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n# Copy the {{jira}} system workflow.\r\n# Edit it with the workflow designer.\r\n# Add a new transition, cloning the Start Progress Transition, providing it with a different name.\r\n# Create a new workflow scheme, assigning the new workflow to it and then assign it to a project.\r\n# View an issue in the appropriate status for that transition. The transition will not have the new name.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results:\r\n\r\nThe transition has the name as defined within the workflow designer.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results:\r\n\r\nThe new transition has the name of the cloned transition.

We stand by our original decision to remove this feature when we redesigned issue search several years ago.\r\n\r\nPlease remember that jira.atlassian.com is one of many inputs for the JIRA roadmap. You can [learn more about our process here|https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/110373/how-does-the-jira-team-use-jira-atlassian-com].\r\n\r\nI understand that our decision may be disappointing. Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nDave Meyer\r\n[dmeyer@atlassian.com|mailto:dmeyer@atlassian.com]\r\nProduct Manager, JIRA Platform\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\nOnce again, your short sightedness on what is useful has struck again.  This is a request to put back the JQL History mechanism.   Here are some comments from the 5.2 upgrade notes page.\r\n\r\n--------------------\r\nJQL history is immensely useful. I'm often looking at issues and just wish to perform transient searches...searches that *I do not want to save*. The JQL history serves as a convenient place that automatically saves these *drafts*.\r\n\r\nAnother use case, when I'm fine tuning searches, I need to jump back and forth between statements to see what they produced.\r\n\r\nIronically, Favorite Filters are the ones I use the least because like browser bookmarks, you eventually accumulate so much that the old stuff has no meaningful purpose to you anymore, and you don't have time to unfavorite them.\r\n--------------------\r\nI totally agree with the feedback given by Anonymous on November 14th:  the JQL History is (was) incredibly useful when developing a good query...  and that fiddling comes *before* it is saved as a Filter.  I do not want to have to save my experiments as Filters.  That would cause problems in itself...  many of the experiments would be failures and thus just create clutter that needs to be cleaned up manually later.\r\n--------------------",

If the LinkedBlockingQueue was given a bounds, then trying to queue up too many clients would throw an IllegalStateException, which could be caught and mapped to a busy message. \"Unable to load the activity stream at this time.

Apparently plugins and multitenancy disagree on the plugin state.  Plugins tells us it's there, but when we try to use it the multitenancy tells us that it isn't available.  The condition is apparently permanent.  It would be a good thing to figure out why this happens in the first place, but in the meantime the I18nBean should intercept the failures instead of letting them take out the cache entirely.  If the plug-in is gone, then us not getting its translations is the right answer anyway.\r\n\r\nI'm led to understand that this has been seen before and handled much the same way.  My guess is that this was triggered by the conversion to using Google caches, which wrap the IllegalStateException in an UncheckedExecutionException.  That's silly and unhelpful and is probably contributing to the problem.\r\n\r\n{noformat}\r\n2012-11-12 18:19:01,544 StreamsCompletionService::thread-9671 ERROR anonymous 957x5545060x9 - 78.47.84.21,172.16.3.44 /rest/activity-stream/1.0/config [atlassian.streams.\r\ncom.google.common.util.concurrent.UncheckedExecutionException: java.lang.IllegalStateException: Method invoked on module descriptor after it was destroyed.

I am developing a JIRA client for Android platform, and I have a few questions. \r\nDuring first launch my app caches some data in local DB (custom fields sets, value bundles for each custom field, assignee, priority etc)\r\nThere is a request in REST API - /rest/api/2/issue/{issueIdOrKey}/editmeta \r\nand I can get all available custom fields (with values) and operations from this request. And there is a question: is there any situation, when this request will return different data within one project? I mean different custom fields or different value bundles for two issues created in one project. And is there any way to get a Project scheme (custom fields, bundles, etc), but not a Issue scheme. \r\nThank you.",
