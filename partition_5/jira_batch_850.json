It fails, throwing a NullPointerException with no clue about what has happened.\r\n\r\nCheers\r\n\r\nThiago Prisco\r\nAtlassian Support",

We did this by doing the following:  As an admin user, bring up the Jira GUI and go to Administration -> Global Settings -> General Configuration, and edit the \"Email from\" field. Give it the value: JIRA (${fullname}) .\r\n\r\nThis works great on Outlook 2007 that I run on my Windows XP host and in the native mail tool on my Mac OS 10.6 machine. However, with Mac Outlook 2011 on Mac OS 10.6, I only see \"JIRA\" in the From: field without the Jira user name. Those are getting stripped out.\r\n\r\nWould be great to find a way to fix this.

In SOAP you have the STUB so you've got a method to accomplish that. In XML-RPC I've used some python code but changed to the way the ISSUE is returned, so I just made an copy of the struct returned by getIssue to create the updateIssue one, still doesn't work even though with tons of tests.\r\n\r\nIt's seems the server is not able to update those values, it just ignore them. May anyone give me hints? It's really a bug or Am I doing something pretty bad?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.",

After looking at a support case today and doing more investigating of the insanity that is [the Unicode spec|http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode6.0.0/] I think that the current implementation is insufficiently robust.\r\n\r\nRight now we do something like:\r\n\r\n{code}\r\nFile[] files = File.listFiles()\r\nnew FileInputStream(files[0])\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nIt might seem surprising but this can still throw a FileNotFoundException. What can happen is this:\r\n\r\n# Use linux.\r\n# Set the user's encoding to ISO-8859-1.\r\n# Create the file with \u00e4.txt. This will be saved on disk as a sequence-of-bytes that includes the byte 228, since that's what a-umlaut is in ISO-8859-1.\r\n# Switch encoding to UTF-8.\r\n# Run above snippet.\r\n# listFiles will see that 228 and try to represent it as UTF-8. It's not valid UTF-8 (characters above 130-whatever can only appear after the surrogate pair marker thing). So it gets replaced with EF BF BD (the Unicode replacement character). So your list will contain the file <EF><BF><BD>.txt, which usually just gets displayed as ?.txt\r\n# When you try to open the file <EF><BF><BD>.txt the filesystem will naturally complain that no such file exists because there *is* nothing with those sequence of bytes as its name.\r\n\r\nI think the only way to be safe is to remove all \"unsafe\" characters from the attachment name. There are two possible options here:\r\n\r\n# Leave ASCII characters as-is and replace the non-ASCII stuff with some kind of escaping mechanism. Instead of \"Tr\u00eecky N\u00e5me.txt\" it might be stored on disk as \"Tr_cky N_me.txt\" or similar. That seems like a decent compromise for most European languages -- they still have some semblance of the original name available. But it screws over the rest of the world. \u5929\u624d\u3002txt would just become __.txt, which is pretty useless. So I recommend we just do....\r\n# Drop all pretense of keeping the original filename around. Just use the plain ID. Digits 0-9. Never have to worry about encoding issues again(?) The downside: people who want to access the filesystem and browse attachments that way now need to go to the database to decode files. I don't think that is nearly a common enough use case to worry about.\r\n\r\nNote that there are also possibly some [Unicode normalization issues|http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3610013/file-listfiles-mangles-unicode-names-with-jdk-6-unicode-normalization-issues] that we are currently open to but I still haven't investigated them enough to say for certain their impact on JIRA.",

One with key TST-1 and one with key CONF-1747. You use a query like this:\r\n\r\n{code}\r\nissuekey in (TST-1, CONF-1747)\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nLet's say that TST-1 does not exist. Instead of only returning CONF-1747, the search screen displays an error. This is unintuitive behavior. Consider the query in a different form. \r\n\r\n{code}\r\nissuekey IN TST-1 OR issuekey IN CONF-1747\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nThere is an issue that matches the above criteria but the JQL engine returns an error because there is no TST-1 key. \r\n\r\nThe particular use case is the {{jiraissues}} macro in Confluence. In Confluence 3.5, users will be able to use it to display info for single issue keys. I want to create a single JQL query  request for all issues on a page. However, if a user mistypes a single key, it will derail the entire search request to JIRA and no information will be returned. ",
