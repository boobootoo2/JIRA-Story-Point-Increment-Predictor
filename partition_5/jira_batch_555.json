First let me say that makes sense and I agree. \n\nHowever, in a case like we are in now, having really just got going with Service Desk and still trying to focus our SLA in the tool, it would be nice at that time to have the option to reindex *all* of the issues.  We are not changing the underlying theory of our SLAs, just trying to focus your tool to get them all as correct as possible.  This has taken a number of iterations, but would be valid for all of our data. \n\nIn closing, we just think there should be an option, not the default option at all, but a admin only option that would allow the SLA to be processed on all tickets regardless of their status.

The queues provide this, but rather than having an infinite number of queues we would prefer to be able to hand this to our users.    What we would like is the ability to : \n\na) filter within a Service Desk Queue based on fields in much the same was as auto filter works in Excel.  This should be allowed for all fields with the exception of the issue key.  In this way we could have Queues based on the workflow step, and the user being able to apply a filter to allow them to only see certain fields for say client, location, (and as we work in the oil industry) rigs, wells\n\nb) the ability to sort on any column (field) in a queue by clicking on the column header.  Options should be ASC or DESC.  In this way the user could do this rather than being set by an administrator.  Additionally setting this by an administrator appears to have a bug ( (JRA-39263) Service Desk - Unable to sort in a Queue)",

In notification scheme of a project, only assignee should get email. Also I have disabled \"SEND_EMAIL_NOTIFICATIONS\" in db table AO_54307E_VIEWPORT of the project.\n\nWhile the issue is after the updating, reporters keep getting emails from the service desk. \n\nNow I disabled two modules notifications-soy & notification-filter-impl of the plugin and reporters don't get any email any more.\n\nIs it correct way to disable reporter notification? I think assignee will not get any notification if I disabled the two modules. \n\nIs there any other better way to do this?\n\nThanks in advance\nHailin",

I apologise, it has been too long since I have provided an update for this feature request.\r\n\r\nThe bad news is that it has taken longer than expected to line up the necessary dependencies to deliver this capability. It is on its way, but we do not expect to be able to deliver it until mid 2022.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile we are working on some steps along the way that simplify customer access. Most notably helping internal customers (e.g. employees) sign-up to the help centre based on site access domain settings, and applying restrictions to external customer sign-up based on email domain (JSDCLOUD-868).\r\n\r\nTo help guide our focus on Customer Management in JSM, I have prepared a short survey (10 questions), to get a better sense of how you manage customers in your organisation. I would greatly appreciate your feedback - https://forms.gle/27CBCUC5akpgwwAL8.\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\n\r\nBen.\r\n{panel}\r\nh3. Problem Definition\r\n\r\nCurrently it is not possible to integrate sso with JIRA Service Desk, it would be better if can provide this functionality so that customer does not need to sign in to the customer service portal in order to raise a request.\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nIf the customer (portal-only user) has an email address verified with [Atlassian Access|https://confluence.atlassian.com/cloud/verify-a-domain-for-your-organization-873871234.html], site-admin can migrate the account to Atlassian account so that the customer can login with SSO.\r\n Once migrated, ensure that the site access is enabled and ensure that there is no application access. This will ensure that there are no license consumed and have the users treated as a customer.\r\n\r\n!Screenshot 2019-10-29 14.00.22.png|thumbnail! !Screenshot 2019-10-29 14.11.20.png|thumbnail! !site access.png|thumbnail!",

This means if it is changed it may not affect previous issues. For example:\n\n* JSP-1 and JSP-2 are raised.\n* The SLA is changed. JSP-1 does not appear to be updated.\n\nWhen the re-calculate SLA code runs after an SLA config change it sees that and deems JSP-1 as not ongoing and hence it does not \"re-invent\" that JSP-1 met SLA under the new rules.  Instead it clears that SLA was ever met.\n\nNow why does it do that?  \n\nWell its because the semantics of re-writing SLA history is complicated and invokes existential dilemmas that only the like of Emmanuelle Kant, Renee Descartes and [~miruflin] can answer. So instead of pretending that SLA where met or not met, SD decides they never existed. We could do a better job in informing the user of the impact of the SLA change at the time of the change and have raised issue JSD-494 for this.\n\nAt the minimum please enhance the product so that it warns users about this.",

To learn more and set this up for your service desk, [check out our release blog|https://confluence.atlassian.com/servicedeskcloud/blog/2017/04/introducing-the-login-free-portal].\r\nThank you for your feedback and suggestions on this feature, and for helping us build a better JIRA Service Desk.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nThe JIRA Service Desk Team\r\n{panel}\r\nWe're having many users that login to the customer portal and then never file a request. As a result, they take up a license that is otherwise unused. It would be preferable if customers could see all the request types and possibly even fill out the info and be prompted to login later in the sequence, so they don't unnecessarily use licenses.\r\n\r\nNote, we are using Crowd with LDAP delegated authentication where users are automatically added to the 'jira-users' group on first login.",

The create button gets disabled and re-enabled without proceeding to the issue page.\n\nNo feedback is provided to the user on the successful creation of the issue.\nNo warning is displayed indicating a hidden field will affect the issue creation process\n\nh3.How to reproduce\n# Open customer portal\n# Click any request type, e.g. \"Get IT Help\"\n# Fill in request form\n# Click \"Create\"\n# Hour glass appears and button is greyed out...\n# After a while, the \"Create\" button is re-enabled.\n# The request is created and can be seen inside JIRA.\n# The request cannot be seen by the customer under Customer Portal > Requests.\n\nAlso, on Chrome Developer Tool, the create AJAX call triggers a 404 Not Found page:\nExample:\n{code}https://<instance>/servicedesk/customer/portal/<servicedesk_id>/create/<form_id>{code}\n\nh3.Diagnosis\n* The problem occurs when the 'Customer Request Type' field is hidden in the issue type field configuration.\n* The root cause is the default Issue Type's Field Configuration has  'Customer Request Type' hidden. On creating a new service desk, the default field configuration is cloned.\n* This also happens if the issue type is not properly assigned to the 'Customer Request Type' field in the field context.\n\nh3.How to resolve\nh4.Resolving existing service desks\n# Browse to each project where Service Desk is enabled.\n# Browse to the project 'Administration' page.\n# Browse to 'Issue Types' from the left-side menu.\n# Browse to the 'Field Configuration' specified for the issue type.\n# Scroll down to the 'Customer Request Type' field.\n# If it is hidden, press the 'Show' link to make it visible,\n# Repeat for each different Field Configuration on the Issue Types page.\n\nh4.Resolving the default field configuration\nThis will prevent service desks created in the future from being affected with the same problem.\n# Browse to JIRA Administration > Issues > Field Configuration\n# The default field configuration is the one without an 'Edit' button.

We ran into a scenario where a workflow (that was shared by multiple departments) was altered in a way that ended up breaking other group's workflows.  The steps it took to recover everything were painful and long, a way to track and revert such alterations would really be helpful.\n\nThank you,\n-rob  ",

For example all of our clients pay quarterly SLA fee for lets say 100h of support. Any extra time goes by time-and-material scheme and is invoices extra.
