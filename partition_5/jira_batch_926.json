Make JIRA email handlers smarter so they learn to ignore bounce messages\r\n2. Make email address an optional field on users so an admin can remove it when they are disabled.\r\n3. Provide an official \"deactivate user\" function (removing from jira-users is clearly insufficient). This has been suggested earlier.\r\n\r\nSupport suggested doing a bulk change so nothing was assigned to those users but that doesn't solve the whole thing. If they're the reporter, they'd still get emails. Or what if they're watching things?\r\n\r\nChanging their email to a known good one (like my own) was tried, but that prevents that user from emailing in issues because JIRA doesn't know which user my email goes with.\r\n\r\nMaybe someone can suggest another solution I don't see.",

Your feedback is key to helping us understand how you use JIRA so we can continue improving your experience. We have reviewed this issue over the last few days; unfortunately we don't have any plans to support this in JIRA for the foreseeable future.\r\n\r\nPlease remember that jira.atlassian.com is one of many inputs for the JIRA roadmap. You can [learn more about our process here|https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/110373/how-does-the-jira-team-use-jira-atlassian-com].\r\n \r\nI understand that our decision may be disappointing. Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.\r\n \r\nRegards,\r\nDave Meyer\r\ndmeyer@atlassian.com\r\nProduct Manager, JIRA Platform\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\n*Original request description*\r\n\r\nI would like an option where the Priority is set to 'empty' by default and then the user has to select one of the options in the drop down list (this should be mandatory).\r\nThis functionality already exists when adding a custom field.\r\nIt is quite important that the priority should be undefined and that the user has to pick one of the options. Otherwise people might overlook the priority and just leave it automatically on the default value.\r\n",

      "description": "A support customer is using our SOAP API to talk to JIRA and integrate it with another tool. He is effectively reproducing the basic JIRA functions - create an issue, assign an issue, update an issue, and progress workflow on an issue - in that system. His system is for normal JIRA users - they do not need Administrator privilege to use it.\r\n\r\nHowever in order to do this he needs to be able to find out information such as the possible assignees for an issue (and other information). In JIRA this information is available if you have Browse Issue permission. However, in the absence of a more targetted method such as getPossibleAssigneesForIssue(), which would only require Browse Issue permission, he has to instead use getPermissionScheme() and then search the mappings to find out who has the Assignable User permission in that permission scheme for that project. \r\n\r\nHowever getPermissionScheme() requires Administer Projects permission. The users of his application will not have this permission, nor should they need it as they are only carrying out functions that are available with only Browse Issue and in some cases Create Issue permission.\r\n\r\nWe need some more targetted methods so that he does not have to go via methods that require Administer Projects permission in order to carry out operations that only require a lower security level.\r\n\r\nSee the support issue for details of which methods.\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\nIan",

      "description": "The problem is that when sending the screenshot imahe the screenshot applet has the User-Agent HTTP header set to the Java Plugin, as it should. Crowd, while trying to be ultra secure hashes the user's cookie based on a few things, but also based on the User-Agent. So when using the Crowd's SSO solution, and sending the screenshot, the screenshot's request does not get validated and the user gets logged out.\r\n\r\nTherefore, with Crowd's SSO, it is not possible to attach screenshots to JIRA.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to make the applet fake the user agent. However, we cannot hard code the user agent, it needs to be the same string as what the user's web browser sends. So we will need to parametrise it. We need to read the value of the \"User-Agent\" header on the request that is sent to show the applet. Then pass this value to the applet by adding another parameter in the attachscreenshot.jsp.\r\n\r\nWhen adding the parameter please remember that it needs to be added in 2 sections. Once for the OBJECT tag and another for the EMBED tag.\r\n\r\nThen we need to add code to the applet that calls {{connection.setRequestProperty()}} and sets the \"User-Agent\" HTTP header to the value that was passed in as a param. See how the applet sets the {{Content-type}} HTTP header.\r\n\r\nPlease test the solution works on Windows and Mac (Firefox and Safari).\r\n",

      "description": "Hi,\r\n\r\nI did the following:\r\n\r\nI cloned an issue including its subtasks in project A. The clone and each subtask has assigned component \"PLC\" in project A. Then I moved the clone with its subtask to project B. During the moving process I was told that step 2 is not necessary: components unknown ( because there are no components yet in project B, its completely empty). After finishing the moving process I had a look into the project overview. \r\nThere were now 7 open issues assigned to component \"PLC\" and one issue without an assigned component. \r\n\r\nI then went to the administration overview. There was still no component available/created.\r\n\r\n(After creating a new component \"PLC\" for project B I had two entries \"PLC\" on the project overview on the tab open issues....)\r\n\r\nReindexing didn't  help. I could reproduce it n-fold.\r\n\r\nMy opinion:\r\nI believe that the subtasks have still the component of the original project A assigned. I had a look into the database and it was like this. The issue in project B was still linked to the component in project A.\r\n\r\nSolution: Either I should be asked what component should be assigned to the subtasks (as for the main issue) or no component should be assigned?!?!\r\n\r\nHope you can follow. \r\n\r\nCheers, Irene",
