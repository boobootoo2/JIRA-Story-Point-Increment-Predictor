Steps to reproduce\u00a0\r\n\r\nGoal is to set all issue resolution field to \"Done\" in \u00a0\"Done\" project when issues were moved from other projects to \"Done\" project regardless what was the issue resolution before.\u00a0\r\n # Create new workflow\r\n # In \"Create Issue\", add post function \"update issue field\" to transition\r\n # Select \"Resolution\" as \"Done\". Add post function.\u00a0\r\n\r\n!UpdateissuePostfunction.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nh3. Expected result\r\n\r\nWhen moving issues from other project to \"Done\" project, resolution should be set to \"Done\" automatically after adding \"update issue field\" post function.\u00a0\r\n\r\nh3. Actual result\r\n\r\nWhen moving issues to the \"Done\" project with the \"update issue field\" post function to update the \"resolution\" to \"Done\", the \"resolution\" is unchanged and remains \"unresolved\"\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\u00a0\r\n\r\nwe recommend to use the \"Automation Life for Jira\" plugin(it's free) to automatic the transition, update resolution to \"Done\" when you move the issue from any project to the \"Trash\" project. \r\n [https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.atlassian.plugin.automation.jira-automation-plugin/server/overview]\r\n\r\n*Here is the step by step guide to set up the automation rules*\r\n # Install \"Automation Life for Jira\" plugin.\r\n # Create automation rule. Select \"Multiple issue events\"-> \"Issue moved\". (Make sure to select from \"Multiple issue events\" as \"issue moved \"pro\" is not free)\r\n !automationRule.png|thumbnail!\r\n Note: If you check the box \"Execute this rule immediately when the rule is triggered, instead of in the background\", when the issue is moved to \"Trash\" project, the resolution will be set to \"Done\". If the box is unchecked, you will need to refresh the page of the issue inside of \"Trash\" project in order to reflect the changes.\r\n # In the JQL condition, enter JQL as \"project = 'resolution' AND resolution IS EMPTY\" !JQLCondition.png|thumbnail!\r\n # Edit issue fields \"resolution\" to \"Done\".\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 !updateresolution.png|thumbnail!",

Summary\r\nGiven that the Description field can be moved within the Configure Screens functionality, a user would expect the View/Edit Issue screen to respect the re-ordering of fields from their configuration\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\nFollowing the Jira Server documentation, [Defining a screen|https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiraserver/defining-a-screen-938847288.html], \r\n# Log in as a user with the Jira Administrators global permission.\r\n# Choose  > Issues. Select Screens to open the View Screens page.\r\n# Click the Configure link next to the screen for which you want to re-order fields\r\n# Move the Description field:  Hover over the dotted part of the field (next to Description) and drag the field to the desired position.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nUpon saving the screen, the screen should show the Description field in the order it was configured.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nThe Description field allows displays below the other fields within the screen\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Notes\r\nWithin the Jira documentation,\u00a0[Defining a screen|https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiraserver/defining-a-screen-938847288.html], the following lines describe the possible limitation:\r\n\r\nbq.*System fields on View Issue screen* \u2014 System fields on the default 'View Issue' screen (e.g. Summary, Security Level, Issue Type, etc.) are fixed. This means that they will always appear in the same place on the 'View Issue' screen, even if you configure the Screen to move them onto a separate tab. Custom fields of related to Dates and People will also appear in their fixed section of the view issue screen. If none of the fields on a tab contain data then the tab is not shown. To make a tab show up, make sure it has a custom field with a type such as Text or Select and that the field has a value. Note, this information only applies to the screen associated with the 'View Issue' operation in a screen scheme.\r\n\r\nIf there is a limitation for Description since it is a system field, there should be a message when a user attempts to re-order that field or a modification to the Jira Configure Screen UI\r\n\r\nh3.Workaround\r\nThere is no workaround",

      "description": "I'm committed\u00a0to using Jira but I hate *how many clicks* are required in order to\u00a0achieve small things. Here are some of the things I've noticed, I wonder if you have any plan to improve on these in the future, or whether anyone has suggestions for easier workarounds?\r\n\r\n*Changing a workflow*\r\nThis small change took me about 30 minutes because apparently, you can't change an active workflow..\u00a0goodness knows why not. I thought this was supposed to be agile?\r\n\r\nMy workaround was to clone the workflow and then I had to clone the workflow, make the changes and then reassign all my projects to the new workflow.\r\n\r\n*No Scrum Templates* JSWSERVER-6790\r\nWe should really be able to set up a project template and use that going forward. My current workaround (probably about 100 clicks)\r\n * Create New Project (in order for the\u00a0Filter to be set up)\r\n * Delete the newly created Board\r\n * Make a copy of my Template Board\r\n * Rename the new Board\r\n * Change Saved Filter of the new board to the one that was originally created.\r\n * Change the Workflow scheme to use my default one in Admin Settings > Workflow Schemes\r\n * Delete the workflow in\u00a0Admin Settings > Workflow\r\n\r\n*Multi-Issue\u00a0editing*\r\nWhen working on the backlog I often want to create a batch of tasks and then divvy it up between the team. So I would like to be able to select multiple issues and quickly assign them to multiple users. I can already select multiple issues but if I assign it to a user then it only assigns one of them. Why do I have to go through the whole process of bulk editing issues just to add an assignee?\u00a0\r\n\r\n*Bulking Editing Process*\r\nThis process is quite time-consuming, I have to search for the issues that I want to change. Click bulk edit. Confirm that I want to change the issues that I have just searched for. Select the type of change. Make the changes. Confirm again. And then acknowledge.\r\n\r\nIdeally I after searching the issues and clicking bulk edit, I should be able to choose what I want to change, then see the list of issues (ideally with a git type view of the changes) and then confirm, and be taken back to my search.\u00a0\r\n\r\n*Bulk adding of stories*\r\nThis is currently my biggest frustration at the moment. Maybe I'm missing something but the only way I can add multiple issues is by doing a CSV import which takes about 20 clicks. My current workaround is that I have created a beta agile board and from there I can paste a clipboard full of tasks separated by a\u00a0line break. The popup comes up to ask me if I want to create multiple issues. Then I go into the search and go through the still somewhat tedious process of bulk moving them into the correct project. Ideally, I would love the same multiple add popup to appear in all of the backlogs.\r\n\r\n*Better use of right click*\r\nI've only been using Jira for 2 days now but if I look I'll be able to find 100 examples of places where this can be used to eliminate clicks. But I'll give one quick example:\r\n * *Adding an icon to a project*\r\nFrom the projects page, I first have to click on a project, wait for the 5 second load time and then can click on settings, why not have a right-click menu on the projects page that allows me to go straight to the projects settings page, thus saving me 5 seconds and saving your\u00a0servers the unnecessary load time, which will help someone else's request take 4 seconds instead of 5.\u00a0**\r\n\r\n*Can't import story points*\r\nNot sure why but I don't seem to be able to import story points or much else for that matter, it would be nice to be able to Create an Epic while I'm importing stories. Also would be nice to be able to label when the issue being imported is a story or a bug. Also, it would be nice when matching the assignee to either have a tip for what I am supposed to use. IE. the username. Or better a drop-down of the users.\r\n\r\n*User Dropdown*\r\nThe user dropdown is very unfriendly. Firstly it should dropdown straight away when I click assignee. Also, I have to look at all of the plugins I've added before seeing the actual users on the site. That doesn't really make sense.\r\n\r\n*Keyboard Shortcuts*\r\n * *Weird keyboard shortcuts*\r\nST, SB to move to the top or button... Why not Shift+Ctrl+ Up / Down\r\n\r\n\r\n * *Adding story points when in the backlog*\r\nI have to do this one by one. Firstly the multi assignment is missing. Secondly, why not set up a quick keyboard shortcut to add a priority. Tab + 5 to add 5 story points for example.\r\n\r\n\r\n * *Changing priority when in the backlog*\r\nAgain keyboard shortcuts would be great. Something like Alt+Up / Down to increase or decrease the priority.\r\n**\r\n * *More Shortcuts*\r\nSince I've only just started using the system these are just a few I've noticed, I'm sure I will notice many more opportunities in the future.\u00a0\r\nHere is a really great example of some really powerful shortcuts. https://asana.com/guide/help/faq/shortcuts\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nI really love your system. But there are so many small changes that can be made that will make the system much easier to use. I wish you would consider these updates.",

However, once the cursor is placed on the Comment field or anywhere blank on the screen and click, the name format will be displayed in the full name format i.e. \"Carmen Salas\". User then insert the comment and click on the button to complete the transition, the status and assignee will be changed accordingly.\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nThe statement seems to be almost true but I found a bit different behavior in Jira Core 7.8.1.\r\nI meant the following behavior.\r\n\r\nbq. once the cursor is placed on the Comment field or anywhere blank on the screen and click, the name format will be displayed in the full name format i.e. \"Carmen Salas\".\r\n\r\nIt never happened and we need to click *Assignee* field on the screen to display the assignee in the full name format.
