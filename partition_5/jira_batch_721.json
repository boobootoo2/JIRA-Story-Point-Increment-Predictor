Customer Login & Ticket History, Chat, Knowledgebase, Screensharing / Video cast / recording, Phone support, etc.\r\n\r\nWhile a few of these can be solved via add-ons and expensive API development. The fundamental backend doesn't support this. Nor does licensing.\r\n\r\nOur company is ready to switch off Zendesk. and I'm pushing for JIRA so our 200 employees could collaborate with support, dev, and all around product releases and customer reported bugs etc. But there are many deal breakers here.\r\n\r\nMaybe I'm looking at it the wrong way, But as I understand it, We'd need a couple million user license to support this.\r\n\r\nAnd yes I'm aware of mail handlers, etc.\r\n\r\nTheres got to be another way?",

This has made for a poor experience for users accessing the documentation locally (from an export that has been imported into their Confluence instance). In addition, it provides a less-than-complete experience for our many customers that also use JIRA Agile, JIRA Service Desk, etc.\r\n\r\nWe will continue to provide PDF exports of the documentation for all major versions of JIRA.\r\n\r\nIf you have concerns or comments on this decision, please feel free to comment on this ticket.",

Investigation Done\r\nAfter some research, it seems Lucene has problems parsing terms that end with special characters like double-quotes, blankets, and backslash. So, Jira might need to treats it at the code level.\r\n\r\nh2. Workaround for Monitoring Tools\r\n\r\nYou have to adapt your monitoring tools to rule this out on the monitoring tool level itself for the time being, until we can have a code fix. \r\nFor example, rule out any internal server error associated with ParseException.\r\n\r\nh2. Suggestion\r\nOur suggestion is that nowhere in the REST API should return 500 responses unless Jira is down. Various 4xx would be much better for a parseException.",

It causes a lot of confusion with our new (and old) employees who make not unreasonable assumptions, such as workflow transitions on an issue are applied to any issues that clone it.\r\n\r\nThe normal use case for the clone functionality is to speed up the creation of an issue that is substantially similar to another issue and then only have to edit the fields that differ, and the relationship between the issues is about something that happened historically.  It's still useful to maintain the information for hunting down issues that were unreasonably duplicated.\r\n\r\nI suggest that using past tense (\"cloned\" / \"was cloned by\") would be more appropriately descriptive.  I even find \"clone\" to be a misleading term for what it describes, and something like \"templated\" / \"was templated from\" might be even better.\r\n\r\nIt's not clear to me if administrators can even do this themselves.

If that is not possible they would like a Quick Filter drop-down selection instead of the more.../less... that is currently available.

This happens when using the post function \u2018Copy Value From Other Field\u2019, available with the add-on \u2018JIRA Suite Utilities\u2019.\r\n\r\nAfter investigation, I notice that the problem only occurred if different parent options had the same child option values in the Select List custom field. For example:\r\n* Value 1\r\n** Value A\r\n* Value 2\r\n** Value A\r\n** Value B\r\n\r\nIf the parent issue holds the values (Value 2, Value A), since \u2018Value A\u2019 is also present in \u2018Value 1\u2019, the value copied is actually (Value 1, Value A), which is not the expected behaviour. It seems that it only takes account of the child options to choose the value. \r\n\r\nIf we choose the second parent option created in the list, it actually chooses the first one, though it is unclear if its chosen by order.\r\n\r\n*Steps to reproduce*\r\n* Install and enable \u2018JIRA Suite Utilities\u2019 add-on\r\n* Create a \u2018Select List (Cascating)\u2019 custom field\r\n* Add 2 options (e.g. Value 1 and Value 2) and, within each one, one child option with the same name in both (e.g Value A)\r\n** Pretty much like the example above (no need for Value B)\r\n* Create a project with Subtasks\r\n* Create a specific workflow for the subtasks\r\n* Add a \u2018Copy Value From Other Field\u2019 post function to the \u2018Create Issue\u2019 transition in this workflow\r\n** Select the created custom field for both source and destination\r\n** Select the option \u2018Copy from parent\u2019 option\r\n* Create an issue in the project with the second parent option and equivalent sub-option (e.g. Value 2, Value A)\r\n* Create a Subtask for this task\r\n* Its value for the field will be the first one (Value 1, Valeu A), when it should be the second (i.e. a simple copy).\r\n\r\n*Workarounds*\r\nNo workaround available.",

Feedback from customer:\r\n{panel}\r\n- I find that the documentation of the migration is thin. It should have expressly stated that the internal directory will not serve as a *Fallback*. \r\n- The migration script should have first performed a *check* on what users are missing in the AD directory and should give a report of what users are missing to the Admin performing the migration. It should provide the opportunity to cancel the migration. In our case, we have about 330 users and the migration failed for about 40, that we know of.\r\n- Similar to the previous point, JIRA should provide a report independent of a migration process on the JIRA users missing in the external directory. Only with the knowledge of which accounts are missing can we begin the process of applying for new AD accounts.  Related to that is an issue that I have experienced probably 20 times since the migration: We get a report from a user and the user says he or she cannot log in. As a JIRA admin and not an AD admin I have no way of knowing if the problem is because the user has forgotten his JIRA internal directory password or because the AD entry is missing altogether.\r\n{panel}",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-39557].\n  {panel}\n\nDear Atlassian,\r\n\r\nMe and my company (www.bedag.ch) have been using the Atlassian products for quite some time and we have noticed the effort you have put in the quality and the user-friendliness of your products in the recent years. Nowadays it's mostly a joy to use Jira and most of the other tools.\r\n\r\nHowever there are still some parts where the work is painful especially on the administration side. We are in the process of setting up Jira projects for a big swiss customer, and they seem to be very happy it. They want more and more of their business processes and departments (that have nothing to do with SW development!) to be supported by Jira. We already have setup many projects with many custom fields and field configurations for them, we currently have about 100 custom fields (~10 pages). Since almost each project is different, we need to setup a different field configuration for each, and in this process we must a hide a lot of the fields. When clicking hide/show for a field, the whole page gets reloaded, and the page jumps to the top. One must scroll down again several times and then exactly find, where the actually changed field was and then continue from there. A setup process that could be as simple as a few minutes (when streamlined) can take now half an hour or so, with much concentration needed as well.\r\n\r\nSo here is my suggestion: *Could you please change the Show/Hide function on the Field Configuration Admin Page to work via AJAX, so that the whole page doesn't get refreshed and doesn't jump back to the top?* (Pretty many of the other Admin screens could also benefit from AJAXification, but this page would be the most important, I think.)\r\n\r\nActually the whole Field and Screen configuration is in my opinion more complex than it really should be, and nowadays I think this is the least \"user\"-friendly part of Jira.\r\n\r\nI really hope that even in the short term we can experience some \"admin\"-friendly updates to Jira, so that setting up a project gets almost as easy as using it thereafter.\r\n\r\nThanks and best regards:\r\nSzabolcs",

This is not acceptable for our company. We understand and appreciate the value in preserving comment history. However, we would like the ability to shift comments to different users altogether. We have issues with duplicate user accounts under different name formats:\r\nExample: Account Holder= John Doe\r\nUsername 1: jdoe\r\nUsername 2: johnd\r\n\r\nSince the user is actually the same person, we want the option of bulk editing all comments under one username and then changing the commenter to the other. \r\n\r\nDeactivating one account to preserve user history is simply not an acceptable option in this case. The day could come where we need to use one of the duplicate user names for a completely different person. \r\n",

Also, the spaces around the \"/\" appear to be incorrect.\r\n\r\nAccording to the [HTTP/1.1 spec, section 14.43|http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html]:\r\n{quote}\r\nThe User-Agent request-header field contains information about the user agent originating the request. This is for statistical purposes, the tracing of protocol violations, and automated recognition of user agents for the sake of tailoring responses to avoid particular user agent limitations. User agents SHOULD include this field with requests. The field can contain multiple product tokens (section 3.8) and comments identifying the agent and any subproducts which form a significant part of the user agent. By convention, the product tokens are listed in order of their significance for identifying the application.\r\nUser-Agent = \"User-Agent\" \":\" 1*( product | comment )\r\nExample:\r\nUser-Agent: CERN-LineMode/2.15 libwww/2.17b3\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nh3.
