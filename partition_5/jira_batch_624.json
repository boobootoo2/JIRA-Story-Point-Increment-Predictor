Expected Results\r\n\r\nShould report collation is correct \"SQL_Latin1_General_CP437_CI_AI\"\r\nh2. Actual Results\r\n\r\nThe below exception is thrown in the atlassian-jira.log file:\r\n{noformat}\r\n2017-06-20 18:10:46,004 https-jsse-nio-443-exec-12 ERROR Scott.Lepech 1090x309x1 15yequj 10.7.35.65 /rest/projecttemplates/1.0/create-templates/item/35 [c.a.p.r.c.error.jersey.ThrowableExceptionMapper] Uncaught exception thrown by REST service: org.ofbiz.core.entity.GenericDataSourceException: SQL Exception while executing the following:SELECT user_name FROM dbo.cwd_user WHERE (lower_user_name IN ( select item from #temp1 ) ) AND (directory_id = ? ) ORDER BY lower_user_name (Cannot resolve the collation conflict between \"SQL_Latin1_General_CP1_CI_AS\" and \"SQL_Latin1_General_CP437_CI_AI\" in the equal to operation.)\r\ncom.atlassian.jira.exception.DataAccessException: org.ofbiz.core.entity.GenericDataSourceException: SQL Exception while executing the following:SELECT user_name FROM dbo.cwd_user WHERE (lower_user_name IN ( select item from #temp1 ) ) AND (directory_id = ? ) ORDER BY lower_user_name (Cannot resolve the collation conflict between \"SQL_Latin1_General_CP1_CI_AS\" and \"SQL_Latin1_General_CP437_CI_AI\" in the equal to operation.)\r\n{noformat}\r\nh2.

Please direct any feedback related to this bug to that request.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nRen\u00e9 Chiquete - Atlassian Support.\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\nh3. Summary\r\n\r\nHealth Check is returning an error when connecting JIRA 7.4.0 to Confluence 5.9.5 although the application link is working according to the 2 following points:\r\n - in JIRA Admin > Applications > Application Links, the status of the Application Link is \"Connected\"\r\n !JIRA_ApplicationLinkToConfluence5.9.5.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\n - when trying to link a Confluence page to a JIRA issue from the Link dialog, the Confluence page is properly connected\r\n !LinkWithinIssueToConfluence5.9.5.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Install JIRA 7.4.0\r\n # Install Confluence 5.9.5\r\n # Create an Application link to Confluence from the JIRA UI\r\n # Go to JIRA Admin > System > Support Tools\r\n # Click on \"Services\" to expand it\r\n # Click on \"Application Links\" to expand it\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nThe result should be \"Your application links are all working properly\", as it's the case when linking JIRA to Confluence 6.3.1.\r\n\r\n!HealthCheck_Confluence6.3.1.png|thumbnail!\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nThe result says \"One of your application links is reporting \"Network error\".\", although the application link is working and it is possible to link Confluence pages to JIRA issues:\r\n\r\n!HealthCheck_Confluence5.9.5.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nAlso, when navigating to any other JIRA page, a pop-up shows at the top-right corner with a similar error:\r\n\r\n!HealthCheckPopUp_Confluence5.9.5.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nLastly, we can see the following warning in the JIRA logs:\r\n{code:java}\r\n2017-07-13 12:25:16,020 HealthCheck:thread-6 WARN      [c.a.applinks.core.DefaultApplinkStatusService] Unrecognized error while attempting to retrieve status of Application Link 'df6813a6-ecd0-3c00-8c59-1673445a2fc4'\r\n{code}\r\nh3. +NOTE+\r\n\r\nIt should be clearer which AppLinks versions are compatible with each other:\r\n * JIRA 7.4.0 is using AppLinks 5.3.2 while Confluence 5.9.5 is using AppLinks 5.0.4, and in the [Application links version matrix|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/APPLINKS/Application+links+version+matrix] documentation, it is not clear whether 5.3.2 is supposed to be compatible with 5.0.4.\r\n\r\nIf there is any incompatibility issue, it should be clearly specified in this documentation.\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nIt's reported that upgrading Confluence to the latest version may help, but this is not guaranteed as there's also a report that JIRA 7.4.4 shows the same warning connecting to Confluence 6.3.4.\r\n\r\n(i)\u00a0If there's no actual applinks problem, the warning may just be ignored or dismissed.",

Why this is important\r\nWhen we use email channel for an external user to create an issue in JIRA, the external user won't have any idea about wiki markup that is available in JIRA hence the original context of the issue raised by customer will be interpreted different in JIRA which can leads to confusion at external as well as internal JIRA users.\r\n \r\nh3. Workaround \r\n+Disable Wiki Render For Description Field+\r\n# Go to project settings of the affected project.\r\n# Click on *Field*\r\n# Click the edit button on field configuration scheme for the project.\r\n# Locate description field\r\n# Change the renderer from *wiki style renderer* to *text renderer* by clicking on the *renderer* button on the right of the description field.\r\n\r\n(i) Note that this option will disable all the renderer option for this description field. Hence the most convenient way would be option 1. Do test it out and let us know how it goes.",

Summary\r\n\r\nDuplicate issues are created when the mail handler has to process a mailbox with a large number of emails or a small number of emails with large attachments as the caesium threads get stuck processing emails.\r\n\r\nAlthough there is not exact figure to define  \"a large number of emails\" in an attempt to provide a guideline for future issues that can be diagnose as this bug what it was found is that the mailbox has to have more 500 emails to be processed and it was also observed that when the first job processing emails reached approximately the 200th is when duplicates issues start appearing in the system.\r\n\r\nIt is also important to note that the same problem can happen when the mail handler has to process large amounts of data rather than a large number of emails, for example a few emails with big attachments (files larger than 8 or 10 MB),  as the problem is related to the fact that if the running job on one node (job-A on node-1)takes longer than the time that the next job of the same type (job-B) is scheduled to run and it is scheduled to run on a different node than node-1 (for example node-2) then we will see both jobs (job-A and job-B) running at the same time on two different nodes (node-A and node-B).\r\n\r\nTo summarize, the problem is that the scheduler ensures that a clustered job will not run on the same node that is already running but will not check the same for other nodes in the JIRA DC cluster.\r\n\r\n\\\\\r\nh2. Environment\r\n\r\n* JIRA Data Center 7.2.9 with two or mode nodes active in the cluster.\r\n* Jira standard mail handler configured\r\n* POP or IMAP mail box\r\n\r\n\\\\\r\nh2. Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n# Create or find a POP or IMAP mailbox with either more than 25 emails having big files attached to them or more than 500 emails without attachments. (Please see the Additional notes section below)\r\n# Install JIRA Data Center 7.2.9 and start up two nodes\r\n# Go to the Incoming Mail screen (<IP>:<PORT>/secure/admin/IncomingMailServers.jspa)\r\n# Add and configure one mail server (it does not matter if it is a pop or imap)\r\n# Add an incoming mail handler\r\n# Configure the incoming mail handler as follows:\r\n## Specify a name\r\n## Select the mail server previously created\r\n## Delay --> 1\r\n## Handler --> Create a new issue from each email message\r\n## Project --> choose a project name\r\n## Default Reporter --> choose the user that will be the reporter of the created issues\r\n## Leave all other fields not mentioned above as per the respective default settings\r\n## Click on Save\r\n# Wait until the mail handler starts connecting to the mail box and starts processing email.\r\n# Monitor the issues being created\r\n\r\n\\\\\r\nh2. Expected Results\r\n\r\nIt is expected that only one issue per email processed is created in the respective project.\r\n\r\n\\\\\r\nh2. Actual Results\r\n\r\nDuplicate issues are created when having two nodes in the JIRA Data Center cluster.\r\n\r\nh2. Note\r\nProblem caused by 2 factors: \r\n* JIRA Datacenter scheduler doesn't guaranty that only one job will be running at specific moment of time across the cluster (Singleton).  See: JRASERVER-65599 \r\n* There is no cluster lock for _Mail Handler_. \r\n\r\nh2. Workaround\r\n\r\nIt is less likely to reproduce the issue when the \"Delay\" parameter (in the incoming mail handler configuration) has a higher value than 1 minute, however that also depends on how much data needs to be processed and hence in some cases increasing it to 3 minutes can workaround the issue whereas in others it has to be 5 minutes or higher.\r\n\r\n*Set the \"Delay\" parameter to a higher value than 1 minute (keep increasing it if you still see duplicates) and monitor the system until no duplicates are created.*",

It would appear that, within the context of the aforementioned element, that JiraHelper object is null. Because of this, a NPE is thrown when a call is made to the method getContextParams().\r\n\r\nTo add some context, this is in a class that extends the com.atlassian.jira.plugin.webfragment.conditions.AbstractWebCondition class. We're using it in our plugin (ScriptRunner) to determine whether some web items should display in the UI.\r\nIt looks like the jiraHelper that's getting passed to the method is null, but only when the item we're trying to hide is the \"com.atlassian.jira.jira-projects-plugin:browse-project-activity-stream\" item.

      "description": "Business Case for Suggestion:\r\n\r\nWe constantly have \"clutter\" comments being added to comments inside a JIRA Issue. \u00a0\r\n\r\nThis is often the automated posting/reposting of full email threads of a case when the case is initiated by a customer forwarding a long email of case history, manual internal posting of an entire thread to show the context of a request, etc. \u00a0This makes it very frustrating to locate \"real\" comments and leads to having to scroll through literally hundreds of lines of content to get to the \"add comment\" button that is located at the bottom of all the comments.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nSuggestion:\r\n\r\nAllow a parameter to limit the initial view of the content of all comment to X characters (e.g. 200 characters) before putting a \"Click to view more\" expand button. \u00a0In addition to that, add an \"expand all\" option for the comments tab to ensure that anyone who wants to use a \"find\" option inside a browser could quickly expand all comments to locate a key-word within longer comments.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nHopefully, this is a simplified approach from previous request for user-driven, macro-based expandable comment content: https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-33995",

Business impact\r\nSince the trusted app is deprecated since Application link 5.2 and the actual Oauth system require one token per gadget per user, the user has to go through all gadget to generate the token to grant the access.

Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Re-index JIRA, ensuring that the Health Check shows the Lucene Index is healthy\r\n # Add debug logging on {{com.atlassian.jira.issue.index\u00a0}}\r\n # Insert a JIRA issues macro onto a new Confluence page (ensure that this is the first time that issue has been linked to that page)\r\n # Refresh the support tools screen - the index shows as unhealthy.\r\n ** The database has received an update from Confluence, but has not been reflected in the index\r\n # Edit the issue that you linked, and it will be reindexed. Checking the support tools screen shows the lucene index is healthy again\r\n\r\nh3. Additional Diagnostic Information\r\n\r\nDebug logging shows the following when an issue is edited and subsequently indexed:\r\n{code:java}\r\n2017-07-05 10:55:53,554 http-nio-9733-exec-25 DEBUG admin 655x693x1 bmvmt3 0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1 /secure/AjaxIssueAction.jspa [c.a.j.issue.index.DefaultIssueIndexer] Performing an index operation: All issues provided by iterable will be specifically reloaded from the database before indexing\r\n2017-07-05 10:55:53,557 http-nio-9733-exec-25 DEBUG admin 655x693x1 bmvmt3 0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1 /secure/AjaxIssueAction.jspa [c.a.j.issue.index.DefaultIssueDocumentFactory] Indexing issue: TEST-11\r\n2017-07-05 10:55:53,575 http-nio-9733-exec-25 DEBUG admin 655x693x1 bmvmt3 0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1 /secure/AjaxIssueAction.jspa [c.a.j.issue.index.DefaultIndexManager] Reindexed 1 issues in 21ms.\r\n{code}\r\nThis debug logging does not appear for issues that have only been touched when updated via a remotelink. This behaviour can also be verified, by using Adaptavist ScriptRunner, which queries via the index:\r\n\r\nScriptRunner can be used to validate the problem. Use the following JQL:\r\n{code:java}\r\nissueFunction in linkedIssuesOfRemote(\"query\", \"pageId=xxx\"){code}\r\nIn this JQL, {{xxx}} is a page ID in Confluence. It will show all the issues that have a remote link back to that page ID - but if the issue has not been updated in the index, it cannot be found via this function (or other index based functions).\r\n\r\nIssue Linking from Confluence can lead to issues where the database is up to date, but the Lucene index is not up to date, which makes searching and reporting on issues in JIRA unreliable. This will also affect *all* JQL queries based on the index - even viewing issues in issue navigator, ordered by updated date shows the issue hasn't been touched recently, when it actually has.\r\n\r\nThis also occurs when you link an issue to a Confluence page from inside JIRA - the index is not updated in the same fashion.\u00a0\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nThe issue is reindexed, as if it has been updated manually.\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nThe issue is not reindexed, and the Lucene Health Check fails\u00a0\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nTouch the issue to perform a reindex, or reindex JIRA.",

      "description": "h3. Problem Definition\r\n\r\nCurrently, when a JIRA user has \"Administer Projects\" permission, but does not have \"Browse Project\" permission, if this user goes to a JIRA Software Project Setting page, and clicks on \"Versions\" from the left navigation bar, the following error is displayed:\r\n \"The JIRA server could not be contacted. This may be a temporary glitch or the server may be down.\", as shown in the screenshot below:\r\n !ErrorWhenClickingVersions.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\nIf we analyze the web requests from the HAR file, we see that there is a GET request going to a link containing \"projects/1.0/project/undefined/release/allversions\", that returns returns the not found (404) message.\r\n\r\nIf we put this link into a browser, we get the following error:\r\n{code:java}\r\n[\"No project could be found with key 'undefined'.\"]\r\n{code}\r\nInstead of giving an error 404, JIRA should provide a message on the screen saying that the user can't access the \"Versions\" link because this user doesn't have the \"Browse Project\" permission.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the way it is working is not intuitive, because we would think that as a Project Administrator, we should be able to access \"Versions\", since it's part of the Project Administration menu, but it is not possible without the \"Browse Project\" permission.\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n\r\n2 suggestions:\r\n - Either let the user with Project Administrator permission access \"Versions\"\r\n - Or, if a user without \"Browse Project\" permission tries to access \"Versions\", display a message on the screen explaining why this user can't access this page.\r\n\r\nh3. Why this is important\r\n\r\nI think that this feature request is important because at the moment the way JIRA is designed is not intuitive and can be confusing for the Project Administrator.\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nGrant the user with \"Browse Project\" permission, and the user will be able to access \"Versions\".",
