This would alleviate the need to do a JDK download and installation and muck around with the Jira home/path variables to get a stack trace. This download is doubly problematic because you probably have to go through Oracle's complex process for getting an older version of the JDK to match the Jira distribution because you don't want to add a Java update to the mix at [tarfu|http://www.futilitycloset.com/2009/10/03/reporting-in/] time. :)\r\n\r\nI also attach a batch file to get the tomcat PID and the other bits required to generate the stack trace, view it and save it in a text file with a time-stamped file name.  In a single click. Also works with Confluence. This version saves the file in the stack trace in the current directory, this could possibly be improved to a standard location like the log folder.

      "description": "In our plugin, I have an additional JIRA top navigation bar menu with a dynamically generated section (like in the Issues dropdown), implemented via <simple-link-factory> plugin module. The problem is that if I disable the plugin, and then enable it again, the factory no longer works. The only workaround is to reinstall the plugin or restart JIRA.\r\n\r\nThe important observation is that when the plugin is Enabled and then the drop-down link is clicked, the constructor of StructureBoardLinkFactory (our instance of SimpleLinkFactory) is not getting called -- therefore, the old instance of the module with stale references to all other components is used.\r\n\r\n(First posted as a question here: https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/26118 - assuming this is really a bug)\r\n\r\nHaving an old instance with bad links leads to the exceptions like

None of them make you able to list directly on events processed by issues over the workflow. It's a question of have a listener similar to the mail one but differing on the resulting action.\r\n\r\nThis can be incredibly helpful when you need to perform operations that can only occur, for example, when the issue's workflow entry is in a particular state.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nMatheus Fernandes",
