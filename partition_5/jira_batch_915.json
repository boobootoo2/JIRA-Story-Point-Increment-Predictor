However, we have found that watchers that do not have the group security privileges to view comments in JIRA will still receive an email with the comment.

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-14621].\n  {panel}\n\nUSE CASE\r\n1. u have a bunch of issues to organize and u want to do that via bulk changes\r\n2. u make a selection of - lets say all open issues - resulting in a few hundred items\r\n3. some will be assigned to version 1.1 and others to 1.2 and then again there are some which are to be closed/refused\r\n\r\nNOW\r\nu have go through the list of all issues thrice, one for each bulk operation for the version\r\nthis is very counter productive as when u go through the list, u often have to look @ the issue and then decide\r\nwhen u are done with version 1.1 u probably have forgotten those issues that need to go into version 1.2 and hence have to rescan that list again\r\n\r\nWHEN u can do diff. bulk changes at the same time then u can open the same list N times and select there for each bulk operation the issues.\r\n\r\nWORAROUND\r\ncurrently i have to print out the list, make notes on paper as to what bulk change i need to do on a set of issues\r\n\r\n\r\nNICER ALTERNATIVE SOLUTION\r\nit would be even nicer to add a text field column to the bulk change view (named \"bulk change tags\" )instead of the check boxes. in this TB  u can enter a space delimited list of tags which then define the set of issues for a specific bulk operation. for the example above: \r\ni enter either A, B, or R. where i have to remember that these tags stand for: A=V1.1, B=1.2, R- Refuse\r\n\r\nto expand the use case above:\r\nlets say i notice while scanning thru the tasks that i need to do for some of the task another bulk change, eg. set the component, then i could enter in that field: \"A admin\" where \"admin\" reminds me to set for these issues the Admin module while A still means that this issue goes to version 1.1\r\n\r\nthe process to iterate through the respective bulk change tags could be like so:\r\n1. choose issues (has now the added text field instead of CBs)\r\n2. choose bulk operation tag\r\nthis gives u the choice which of the issue sets u want to select for the first/next specific bulk operation\r\nthe next steps remain unchanged by this concept, except for the last\r\n3. choose operation \r\n4. op. details\r\n5. Confirmation \r\nthis step changes only in that regard that after completion u are returned to the page of \"choose issues\".\r\nthis shows the initial view from step 1 but it has kept the state of the column \"bulk change tags\". the tag that got just completed has been removed though from all those issues.\r\neg. when i just made the bulk change for A then the tag A is remove from all the TBs.\r\nhowever it could be an option on the confirmation page to either remove the tag for the just executed bulk op or leave it, as there are also cases that for the same set of issues u have to do >1 bulk ops.\r\n\r\n\r\nPS: i set the priority to critical as this would greatly boost management efficiency of issues in jira",

Rewording of section *Alternative Method*\r\nfrom this:\r\n{quote}\r\nThe alternative method will not work if you are upgrading from 3.6.5 (or earlier), as JIRA 3.7+ cannot automatically update older schemas. If you are running JIRA 3.6.5 (or earlier), and cannot use the recommended method of XML backup/restore, you will need to update the pre-3.7 database schema by hand before proceeding with the alternative method.\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nto this:\r\n{quote}\r\nThis alternative method will not work if you are upgrading from 3.6.5 (or earlier), as JIRA 3.7+ cannot automatically update older schemas. If you are running JIRA 3.6.5 (or earlier), you should use the [*Recommended Method*|http://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/docs/latest/upgrading.html#Recommended+method] as outlined below.\r\n\r\nIf for some reason you cannot use the recommended method of XML backup/restore, you will need to [update the pre-3.7 database schema by hand|http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/SQL+Scripts+for+3.6.x+to+3.7+schema+upgrade] before proceeding with the alternative method.\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nReason:\r\nMany customers get confused with the wording, for example:\r\n{quote}\r\nI am attempting to upgrade from Jira 3.6.5 to 3.11.  The upgrade path outlined on your website strongly recommends backing-up our data and then performing each incremental database upgrade before bring up the 3.11 application. \r\n{quote}\r\n",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-14588].\n  {panel}\n\nHowever, 12241 is looking at a deeper issue, in that the JIRA tracking system is rather flat, and does not contain a lot of functionality for organizing the 'project level' within the system. As well, organization by product is an imporant idea.\r\n\r\nThis is what I need to do. Currently, I\"m trying to use categories to do this, as well as the 'key' in issues, so I may have several categories representing our products:\r\n\r\nPPM\r\nEPM\r\nSPM, etc.\r\n\r\nThe key will then correspond to that, so I can see issues by product:\r\n\r\nPPM - 001\r\n\r\nHowever, this is a major workaround.\r\n\r\nThere may be a few things to consider, such as:\r\n\r\n1. Ability to have custom fields on the project itself that allows you not not only filter by issues, but also by project. As many have stated in the other three issues you listed, there may be multiple PROJECTS for a PRODUCT. At least providing a way to filter by attributes on a project could help with this, as you can say, for example, \"show me all my projects for this product\". You can't do that right now, except through maybe a category, but, again, you can't actually create a filter on that. It only shows up on the dashboard - not very helpful for reporting.\r\n\r\n2. The other issue is that there are times when a project itself may need to be broken down into smaller 'sub-projects' that then will collect their own set of issues. This is getting more into actual project management, which Planview does.\r\n\r\nMy problem I'm having here is that internally we are trying to implement our own tool, and use it in conjunction with JIRA. One of the problems is that the level of detail we want to collect issue information is at a level lower than the project....in our terminology, a 'phase' level, or possibly even the 'task' level.\r\n\r\nProject\r\nPhase\r\nTask\r\n\r\nThe ability to be able to bring more detail into the system would be very helpful. For instance, we could import into JIRA the work breakdown structure for a project down to the level in which we want to collect issue information, and be able to roll that all the way to the project.\r\n\r\nIn the example above, import down to the Task level. Issues would be attached to the Task.\r\n\r\n3. Another problem I see that people may be having is the ability to relate multiple projects to a particular version. Again, this gets back to #1 above, in that projects need to be able to have attributes on their own, outside of issues. So, you can create a filter that show you:\r\n\r\n\"show me all my projects for Version 10.x\".\r\n\r\nYou can't do that right now because projects don't have attributes, except for category, and you can't create views based on project, only on issue.\r\n\r\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\r\n\r\nThe other thing I was talking about was to have custom fields on projects, with the ability to create filters on projects, NOT just issues. People want to see, by PROJECT, not by ISSUE, what is happening for a version. You can't do that right now, because you can't create a view on projects. You can only see, by version, project information for a single project at a time.\r\n\r\nSo, what that means is, in your filtering functionality, a user could not only create a filter to see issues, based on values within fields for those issues, but also create filters to see projects. I know this is a bigger change, but it looks to me like others are asking for it.\r\n\r\nThe other limiting thing I see, which others are also running into, is your 3 level 'hierarchy'. It really isn't a 'hierarchy' per se, and it doesn't take into account complex project structures.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, JIRA is using the term 'project', and requiring that issues come off of projects, instead of just having issues and sub issues, and using fields/attributes to categorize them. When you start using the word 'project', and requiring that issues become part of a project, you begin to move toward the idea of project management, and all the overhead that comes with that.\r\n\r\nAs a project management system, JIRA, personal opinion, is not ready for. As an issue tracking system it has very good functionality. I'm running into problems with being forced to tie issues to this 'project' level, when I personally think that the idea of a 'project' is not necessary in this system - even though there is rudimentary time reporting. You want to have this, then you need to support more levels than 3 in your 'project' hierarchy.",

      "description": "The reason I feel we need this functionality probably comes from the\r\nfact that in Planview, all lists are managed centrally, as it makes it\r\nmuch easier to maintain and manage, particularly if the lists are used\r\nover and over.\r\n\r\nAnyways, I understand that companies have multiple product lines that\r\nuse different version schemes and components, however, even those\r\nproducts, I'm assuming, may have more than one project associated to\r\nthem, so it makes sense for each product to have a centrally managed\r\nversion and component list. Why, you ask? Here's at least two reasons.\r\n\r\n1. Because otherwise you are risking inconsistency in the way different\r\npeople enter the version and component list, which means your reports\r\nwill be off. \r\n2. Also, you are adding extra unnecessary effort to creating a project\r\nif everytime you create one you have to add a version and component\r\nlist. That is time people don't want to spend.\r\n\r\nI see several options for these two lists:\r\n\r\n1. Create one master list for all components and one master list for all\r\nversions, regardless of product. The user creating the project will need\r\nto know what versions and components go with what product. Not the\r\noptimum solution, but certainly the easiest to implement.\r\n\r\n2. Allow lists to be hierarchical. Planview works off of unlimited\r\nhierarchically structured lists. This will still allow for one master\r\nlist that can have versions and components separated heirarchically -\r\ntop node is 'Version', second level is 'Product', third level is the\r\nversion or component (depending on list) for that product.\r\n\r\n3. Allow for creation of multiple lists. Seems redundant. One master\r\nlist that is heirarchical, to me, would be the best answer. You can even\r\ngo so far as to provide a way to only show a certain part of the list\r\nbased on the product you are creating the project for. We have this\r\nability in Planview, where, based on the selection of a value in one\r\nlists, values in another list become selectable. In this way, you can\r\nmanage all of the same thing in one list, but narrow the end user\r\npicklist to the appropriate values.\r\n\r\n",
