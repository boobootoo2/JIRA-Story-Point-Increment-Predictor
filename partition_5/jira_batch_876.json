      "description": "Currently when you use the time tracking functionality in Jira, it assumes a 24 hour day.\r\n\r\nIn my experience when working on development/support projects, when we talk in terms of \"days\" we mean days effort (often measured as 7.5 hours to one \"day\"), not calendar days.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if there was an option to have different time tracking configurations (like is provided for other things just as field configurations).  The idea being is that you could define a time configuration that specified how many hours there are in a day.  Then, JIRA's time tracking calculations could take that into account.  This would help as when an estimate of 5d is entered, the person usually means 5 7.5-hour days, not 5 24-hour days.",

      "description": "The email template velocity variables $constantsManager and $projectManager point to\u00a0com.atlassian.jira.config.ConstantsManager and \u00a0com.atlassian.jira.project.ProjectManager, both of which have a substantial number of methods that are deprecated in v4.0 and there's no way to access the new methods indended to replace them. This means, for example, that there's no way to get the components for a project. \r\n\r\nThe Release Note template is so out of date it doesn't match your basic meta data. Tasks and Subtasks are both included outside of the issue types they're tied to. The release notes template doesn't even have the velocity variables available in the email templates. Customizing the template is virtually impossible in any meaningful way unless you have access to the source code for the ReleaseNoteManager class. In particular, there's no way to iterate over issues by issue type and then by component or vice versa. There's no way to create a set, rather than a list, so that components can be sorted per issue type. Basically, the template is unusable out of the box and impossible to customize without access to the source code.\r\n\r\nBy not allowing an automated way to produce release notes, you are literally costing your customers thousands of manhours a year. Each release requires someone to extract the relevant data and reformat it. Consider the frustration of using a software product that requires you to cut and paste fields and reformat for every release, rather than simply allowing you to export the information in a reasonable way.\r\nThe reason you don't get many votes for release note issues is because the individuals likely to have accounts with JIRA are mostly developers and not technical writers. Despite that, there is a clear trail of individuals trying to figure out how to do this over a number of years in your development forums - and failing. This seems like a feature that would take a minimum of time to fix, and be very appreciated by the customers. ",

One JIRA project exists for the entire division, and a separate project exists for the subdivision.  A single group of individuals is responsible for monitoring the work of the entire division.  Members of the subdivision should be empowered to add issues to their own project without waiting for explicit assignment by the triagers, but not without the monitors of the entire division being notified of the existence of the issue at least once (at issue creation time).\r\n\r\nThe ideal solution here would be to set it up so that members of the subdivision must create issues in the division's project, thereby triggering notification to the monitors, and then the members of the subdivision could move their own issues into their own project, thereby reducing email traffic at the division level.  To do this, it is necessary to allow members of the subdivision to move issues from the division project into the subdivision project but not allow them to create issues in the subdivision project directly, since that would bypass notification of the monitoring group.  There is no way to do this because in order to grant the subdivision users permission to move issues into their project they must be given Create Issues permissions which will also allow them to create issues directly in the subdivision project, allowing them to bypass notification to the triage group.\r\n\r\nThe solution would be to have three permissions, \"Create Issues\", \"Move Issues Into\" and \"Move Issues Out Of\" in the Permission Schemes.\r\n",

Java just assumes that if you are using 2 digits for the date it falls somewhere between 80 years before and 20 years after the date it was created.\r\n{Quote}\r\nFor parsing with the abbreviated year pattern (\"y\" or \"yy\"), SimpleDateFormat must interpret the abbreviated year relative to some century. It does this by adjusting dates to be within 80 years before and 20 years after the time the SimpleDateFormat instance is created. For example, using a pattern of \"MM/dd/yy\" and a SimpleDateFormat instance created on Jan 1, 1997, the string \"01/11/12\" would be interpreted as Jan 11, 2012 while the string \"05/04/64\" would be interpreted as May 4, 1964.\r\n{Quote}\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html\r\n\r\n",
