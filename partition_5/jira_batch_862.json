Since the Field configuration and Screens are related to a project, the Field Configuration should only show the screens that are related to that particular Configuration.\r\n\r\nTo clarify this a little more:\r\nThe field Affected Version/s is on almost every create issue Screen. We have several projects that have different Screen Schemes en Screens attached. The projects also have different Field Configurations related to them. If I choose the Field Configuration of one of the projects, all screens are shown that Affected Version/s is on. I'd like to see only the Screens related to the project here. It looks to me that the query used for creating the View Configuration Page should be altered for this. Please consider implementing this change.\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\n\r\nJohan-Kees Vliek\r\nPinkRoccade Healthcare",

Your feedback is key to helping us understand how you use JIRA so we can continue improving your experience. We have reviewed this issue over the last few days; however there are not currently any plans to implement this suggestion.\r\n\r\nPlease remember that jira.atlassian.com is one of many inputs for the JIRA roadmap. You can [learn more about our process here|https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/110373/how-does-the-jira-team-use-jira-atlassian-com].\r\n\r\nI understand that our decision may be disappointing. Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nOtto Ruettinger\r\nPrincipal Product Manager, JIRA\r\noruettinger (at) atlassian (dot) com\r\n{panel}\r\n*Original Description*\r\nWhy is it REQUIRED that I enter an email prefix when configuring an SMTP Server for JIRA? Rather presumptuous that all users want this.\r\n\r\nFor filtering in the email client, all my emails from JIRA are differentiated by the From address. I don't need (JIRA) or anything else prepended to every subject line. And furthermore, now that I can config custom subject lines per email notification type, I could always prepend whatever I want to each subject line in those Velocity templates including \"(JIRA)\" if I so wanted.\r\n\r\nPlease remove this requirement from defining the SMTP server.\r\n\r\nThe problem needs fixing in:\r\n - MailServerActionSupport.java doValidation() \u2013 remove check for isBlank(prefix)\r\n - remove \"<ui:param name=\"'mandatory'\">true</ui:param>\" from updatesmtpmailserver.jsp",

      "description": "For one of our projects, I have created two custom workflows, Simple and Testing. The Testing workflow scheme is a superset of the Simple workflow. The Testing workflow is associated with a Test Task issue type and Testing Activity sub issue type. Now the project manager wants to migrate certain existing Tasks and Sub-Tasks to the new issue task in order to take advantage of the new workflow.\r\n\r\nBased on JRA-10167 and JRA-11229, Jira does not allow issue type changes when the workflow changes. However, this brute force solution to the original problems does not allow us to do what we want now.\r\n\r\nMy expectation is that Jira should allow issue type changes across all issue types. When the issue current Status is available in the destination issue type workflow only once then the migration to the new workflow can happen without intervention. If the status is available more than once (creating ambiguity) or not at all (creating an orphan) then Jira should prompt for how to map the states.\r\n\r\nSimilar behaviour should apply to bulk changes.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime we do have the option of creating a new workflow scheme with all issue types in the same workflow, migrating the project to that scheme, moving all the issue types we want and migrating the workflow scheme back. But this is a pretty painful workaround and I can guarantee that in the future some issue will be created with the wrong issue type and this workaround is too painful for regular use on a project with over a thousand issues on the go.",

      "description": "h2. Patch Vailable For JIRA 4.1.2\r\n\r\nThere is now a patch available for JIRA 4.1.2 customers.\r\n\r\nIt consists of the following files\r\n\r\n[^jira-gadgets-plugin-4.1.2_JRA21876.jar]\r\n \r\n[^JRA-21876-4.1.2-patch-instructions.txt]\r\n \r\n[^JRA-21876-4.1.2-patch.zip]\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES : \r\n\r\nThis patch also requires that you update the jira-gadgets-plugin that has been shipped with JIRA.\r\n\r\nTo update this bundled plugin you also need to place [^jira-gadgets-plugin-4.1.2_JRA21876.jar] into\r\n'<JIRA_HOME>/plugins/installed-plugins'.  It will then be loaded and will override the \r\nversion that is shipped with JIRA.\r\n\r\nWINDOWS USERS : Do not use the built in Windows ZIP extractor to apply this patch!\r\n\r\nBy default it replaces all the files in a directory instead of merging the files in.\r\nIf this happens, JIRA will not be able to work correctly.  Use another zip tool such\r\nas WinZip or 7-Zip.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow to apply this patch\r\n==========================\r\n\r\nBefore applying the patch file, make a copy of your JIRA web application directory in case \r\nthings go wrong.  This will allow you to more easily back out any changes.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you are using the Standalone distribution of JIRA:\r\n\r\n1. Download the file JRA-21876-4.1.2-patch.zip\r\n2. Expand the zip file into  <jira_install_dir>/atlassian-jira/ overwriting the files there\r\n3. Restart JIRA\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you are using the WAR distribution of JIRA:\r\n\r\n1. Download the file JRA-21876-4.1.2-patch.zip\r\n2. Expand the zip file to <jira_install_dir>/webapp overwriting the files there\r\n3. Run 'build.sh clean' on unix or 'build.bat clean' on windows\r\n4. Run 'build.sh' on unix or 'build.bat' on windows\r\n5. Redeploy the JIRA web app into your application server\r\n\r\n\r\nThe patch zip file contains the following files :\r\n\r\nArchive:  patch-JRA-21876/patches/JRA-21876-4.1.2-patch.zip\r\n  Length      Date    Time    Name\r\n---------  ---------- -----   ----\r\n    10905  2010-08-01 16:52   WEB-INF/classes/com/atlassian/jira/security/login/LoginManagerImpl.class\r\n       44  2010-08-02 16:55   WEB-INF/classes/patches/JRA-21876.readme\r\n---------                     -------\r\n    10949                     2 files\r\n\r\n\r\nSee also http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CWD-1972\r\n\r\n\r\nh2. The Problem Description\r\n\r\nThe problem is that we have an optimisation in the JIRA code that denies and authentication attempt if there is no user known to the system\r\n\r\n{code}\r\n\r\n        LoginInfo loginInfo = getLoginInfo(userName);\r\n        if (loginInfo == null)\r\n        {\r\n            return false;\r\n        }\r\n{code}\r\n\r\n\r\nWe need to change this to handle this user case where users are lazily added on first authentication attempt.\r\n\r\n\r\n{code}\r\n        LoginInfo loginInfo = getLoginInfo(userName);\r\n        if (loginInfo == null)\r\n        {\r\n            return true;\r\n        }\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nIts a very simple fix in practice.  I have spoke to Spuddy and he is kosher that there are no extra security implications.",

At the same stage I can even create a user allocation report for the future, knowing th enumber of hours that he various users have allocated in the future.\r\nTo the number of users allocate to a user in th original estimate is would be good also to specify the timeframe such that I can cross check almost dail whether \"user a\" is working on the issue during the time I have planned him to work on.

      "description": "This is a bit of an interesting workflow case we discovered today.  If a user creates a workflow with 2 steps that are not editable (via the jira.issue.editable step property) and transitions between the two steps then in theory none of the fields should be editable, since they can't be edited in the source step and destination step.  \r\n\r\nIf fields are added to the transition screen however they can happily be edited since the fields don't care about the source & destination workflow steps or if they are editable.\r\n\r\nThe CommentAssignIssueAction should probably check if both the source and destination workflow steps are editable and if both aren't then not show any fields on the transition screen.  Similarly the validateTransition method in the issue service should do the same check and throw an error.\r\n\r\nNote however that both the source & destination steps have to be not editable for this to be the case!  If either the source or destination are editable, fields should still render and be editable (to allow users to assign when reopening/closing an issue for example).\r\n\r\nThis probably only affects a very small number of users who happened to configure their workflows this way.",

The delimiter is a comma so it thinks you are adding multiple groups to the Project Role.\r\n\r\nFor example, I have a group named \"appdev-team1,5,6\".

      "description": "+*SHORT DESCRIPTION*+\r\n\r\nWhile creating a Transition (be it a regular Transition, or a Common Transition), in the \"Add Post Function To Transition\" list (or wherever appropriate), I would like to be able to assign a (post function?) condition that, when this specific transition is clicked, it automatically assigns the issue to the step/status it was in PRIOR to the current  Step/Status\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n+*LONG DESCRIPTION WITH USER SCENARIO*+\r\n\r\nHere is the description of the user experience I am trying to create:\r\n\r\n*USERS*\r\n- User01: Business Analyst\r\n- User02: Graphic Artist\r\n- User03: Software Engineer (Coder)\r\n\r\n*STEPS/STATUSES*\r\n\r\n*REGULAR TRANSITIONS*\r\n- \"New Item\" (Regular Transition)\r\n- \"Graphics Work-In-Progress\" (Regular Transition)\r\n- \"Coding Work-In-Progress\" (Regular Transition)\r\n\r\n*COMMON TRANSITIONS*\r\n- \"Need More Info\" (Common Transition)\r\n- \"Back to Previous Status\" (Common Transition)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# Business Analyst creates an Issue Ticket.  The ticket gets a status of \"New Item\"\\\\\r\n\\\\\r\n# Graphic Artist picks up the ticket by transitioning it to \"Graphics Work-In-Progress\".  Once it's at the \"Graphics Work-In-Progress\" step, there is a transition available that's called \"Need More Info\" (this is in the case of the Graphic Artist having clarification question from the Business Analyst in order to continue his work)\\\\\r\n\\\\\r\n# Graphic Artist HAS questions for Business Analyst, so clicks on the transition \"Need More Info\".  Once in this \"Need More Info\" status, there is a transition available that's called \"Back to Previous\" Status\\\\\r\n\\\\\r\n# Business Analyst opens the ticket, provides more information, and clicks on the transition \"Back to Previous Status\".  The ticket status will change from \"Need More Info\" to \"Graphics Work-In-Progress\" (which was the previous status the ticket was in)\\\\\r\n\\\\\r\n# Graphics Artist completed the work, and click on an available transition that's called \"Ready for Coding\"\\\\\r\n\\\\\r\n# A Software Engineer picks up the ticket by transitioning it to \"Coding Work-In-Progress\".  Once it's at the \"Coding Work-In-Progress\" step, there is a transition available that's called \"Need More Info\" (which is THE SAME Transition as mentioned in #2 above)\\\\\r\n\\\\\r\n# Coder has questions for Business Analyst, so clickes on the transition \"Need More Infor\".  Once in this \"Need More Info\" status, there is a transition available that's called \"Back to Previous\" status\\\\\r\n\\\\\r\n# Business Analyst opens the ticket, provides more information, and clicks on the transition \"Back to Previous Status\".  The ticket status will change from \"Need More Info\" to \"Coding Work-In-Progress\" (which was the previous status the ticket was in).\r\n\r\n\\\\\r\n   \r\n\r\nThe \"Need More Info\" and \"Back to Previous\" transitions should probably be \"Common Transitions\"\r\n\r\n\"Back to Previous\" transition should have a post function condition of setting it back to the previous status the ticket was in.\r\n\r\nIn the current (4.1) version of JIRA's Post Function list, I do see an option for \"Assign to last role member: Assigns the issue to the last user from the specified role that had this issue assigned before\".  I'm just looking for an option that says something like \"Assign to last Status\"\r\n\r\nI saw a request for something similar back in July 2007.  I'm hoping by now, 3 years later (July 2010) this simple feature has been added.",

      "description": "The look/layout of filters on the dashboard has taken a major step backwards in 4.2, seemingly taking many of the things disliked about the View Issues screen.\r\n\r\n* The gap between rows seems excessive. This is partially because in 3.x the font size was smaller, the text was centered vertically in the row, and there were border lines between rows. The font is now larger, the borders are gone, and the centering has changed. This makes it seem like a large amount of wasted space, even though the number of rows on the screen seems about the same. This is all compounded by the loss of every-other-row shading. This is less about functionality and more about cosmetics. However, it strongly affects the next point...\r\n\r\n* Horizontal scroll bars in filters are evil. In 3.x (and I believe 4.0), I can set up a filter to fill half the page, with 8 different fields (summary, key, various date fields for release management to different environments, etc.). This all fits without issue. However, in 4.2 - EAP, instead of sizing the fields to fit it adds scroll bars. If the filter runs off the screen vertically (which is easy to have happen, see above), you have to scroll vertically to get to the scrollbar, then scroll back up to view  whatever it is you were viewing. Worse, in the situation I describe (8 fields/columns), but the time you've scrolled over to view the 5-8th field (which is where the 'Action' dropdown would be as well), you've completely scrolled past the key/summary fields. With the loss of the cosmetic clues (borders between columns, wasted space, no row shading) you easily lose track of where you are. The scrolling completely defeats the whole \"dashboard\" concept: A large amount of info displayed compactly in a single view. \r\n\r\nCombine the above with the continued inability to change column order, and it is now nearly unusable for a heavily dashboard-based workflow.
