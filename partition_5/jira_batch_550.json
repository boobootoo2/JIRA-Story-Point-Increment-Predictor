After it is being pulled it will be set as Read and the emails is converted as Request in the JIRA ServiceDesk Project. As mentioned in the [documentation|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/SERVICEDESK/Setting+up+the+email+channel]:\n{code}\nAfter the email channel is set up, JIRA Service Desk will take note of when it connected to the email account for the first time. Any new messages sent to your inbox after that time will be pulled in as new requests or comments. Customers will receive email notifications about the details of their requests. For information about notifications, see Configuring JIRA Service Desk notifications. Messages that already exist in your email account are not processed. {code}\nBut, there is still possibility that one of the new email is already \"Read\" before JIRA ServiceDesk pull it making it is not being created as a Request. Hence, just like the Standard JIRA Mail Handler where it will scan the Mail Box as it is configured and it will created any emails as JIRA Issue if the issue is not exist yet, it would be great that JIRA ServiceDesk Email Settings(Mail Handler) have the same features like Standard JIRA Mail Handler.\n\nh4.

Expected Results\nThe comment should be added as public.\n\nh3. Actual Results\nthe issue becomes shown as an Internal comment which is not accurate\n \nh3.

Desired Results\r\n * A list of suggestions will appear which you can choose the customer or request participant\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n * A list of users appears but this list does not contain the customer or any request participants\r\n ** Agents and collaborators do appear in the list.

To allow support for the various suggested functionality for email will require a major re-work of our email handler infrastructure. This is currently not on our immediate roadmap as we are looking to deliver more requested features such as email customisation.
