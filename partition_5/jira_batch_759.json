Otherwise, may possible to allow the gadget to work dynamically so it can detect the url of the instance automatically.\r\n* Create a better integration in terms of adding cross platform gadget. For instance, customer can authenticate first so he has the rights to select a application and add the gadgets into JIRA. The interface can be similar to issue linking interface.\r\n\r\nh5.

Summary\r\nCurrently our documentation instructs how create a self-signed certificate using keystore type as *JKS*, configure the SSL connector and check the certificate as in this [excerpt|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Running+JIRA+over+SSL+or+HTTPS?src=search#RunningJIRAoverSSLorHTTPS-ConfiguringyourwebserverusingtheJIRAconfigurationtool] of our documentation.\r\n\r\nh3. The problem\r\nThe problem is that there are others keystore types, such as *PKCS12* for example and when using JIRA configuration tool to insert the SSL configuration, it will always define keystore type as *JKS* into the {{server.xml}}.\r\n\r\nIf we want to define a different keystore type, the only option available is manually edit it into the {{server.xml}} file. It would be much easier if we had a field to adjust this setting in JIRA configuration tool.",

In the latter case, the context of their comment is often highly dependent on the action they are performing at a time. For example, in a comment made from a smart commit message, the comment is usually a description of the code commit being made. This breaks up the flow of the comments and often makes it difficult to unscramble what people are talking about.\r\n\r\nIt would be great if comments that were made in the context of other actions (such as reassigning issues, editing metadata, smart commits) were annotated in some way with an indication of the action. I believe that Bugzilla does this.\r\n\r\nI could use the Activity tab to see the context of a comment, but the comment text in this tab is too small for everyday use. A little annotation in the Comments tab would really help.\r\n\r\nThoughts?",

Especially because of the well integration between your products. It is easy to find relevant information and navigate between the systems. E.g I can navigate from Jira to a Bamboo build regarding the selected issue. Or I can see the build and test results of Bamboo in my build tab of the issue. Perfect!!\r\nI think the reason is, that the Atlassian strategy wants to make things easier.\r\n\r\nNo I found something which conflicts with your concept regarding Stash\r\n* I have an Issue and the regarding code changes in an Git Branch.\r\n* Now I have created a Pull Request in Stash and of course somebody should review my changes.\r\n* The review was successful and I have merged the branch into the master over Stash.\r\n\r\nPERFECT usability, but:\r\nFrom the Jira-Issue view:\r\n\r\n* Where can I see that the Pull request was approved?\r\n* Where is the \"green/red color\" which indicates the state?\r\n* How can I navigate directly to the relevant Pull request? The number is available, but not a link. I can navigate to everything (Project, Repository, Source, Commit) but not the important Pull-Request. It is possible to navigate from the Pull request to the issue but not from the issue to the Pull request.\r\n\r\nI can not believe that this is not implemented..... This follows not the Atlassian strategy \"Make things easier\"\r\n\r\nI hope this functionality will come soon. It is a must...\r\n",

Replace with actual images so as to permit users to choose their own fonts in their browser.\r\n\r\nThis applies to Confluence as well and is addressed by the [KB available here|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/CONFKB/Icons+on+Confluence+Top+Navigation+Bar+Rendered+as+Letters+in+Internet+Explorer].\r\n\r\nIf fonts are _forced_ by the browser to something not-Atlassian, your UI icons look terrible. For instance, on JIRA 6.1 (this site), the help icons have the \"E003\" UTF-like block rather than the nice, helpful question mark. To avoid this issue when persons choose their own fonts for display, I would like to see a return to images instead of leveraging \"unused characters\" in your custom font palette. ",

As a test, create a new workflow by copying an existing workflow. Then consider the following code example:\r\n\r\nJiraWorkflow jw = ComponentAccessor.getWorkflowManager().getWorkflow(\"jira\");\r\nCollection<ActionDescriptor> workflowActions = workflow.getAllActions();\r\nfor (ActionDescriptor ad : workflowActions)\r\n\tlog.info(jw.getName() + \":\" + ad.getId() + \":\" + ad.getName());\r\n\r\nIf you analyze the output, you'll see that in different workflows, all the actions have ids that start from 1, which makes 2 actions from 2 different workflows have the same id, which is very ambiguous imho.\r\n\r\nTo confirm those are really 2 different transitions, try editing a workflow, changing one of the existing transitions (change the name, destination step, etc). It will still appear with the same id as some other, completely different, transition (from another workflow).",

      "description": "Due to a bug in the Shared Access Layer, one of the libraries JIRA uses, attempts to connect over non-standard ports (such as 8443) will not work properly. This can cause AppLinks to fail when attempting to connect to JIRA as the 'Host' HTTP header is always missing the port, regardless of the actual URL.\r\nh3. Example scenarios\r\n\r\nFor affected versions in JIRA, refer to this issue. This table assumes the applications are listening on different IPs/ running on different servers so they can both listen on the same port numbers.\r\n\r\n\r\n||JIRA affected?||Port||Target affected?||Port||Can establish Application Link?||\r\n|(/)|8443|(x)|443|(/)|\r\n|(/)|8443|(/)|8443|(x)|\r\n|(/)|443|(x)|443|(/)|\r\n|(/)|443|(/)|443|(/)|\r\n|(/)|443|(x)|8443|(x)|\r\n|(x)|8443|(x)|8443|(/)|\r\n|(x)|443|(/)|8443|(x)|\r\n|(x)|443|(/)|443|(/)|\r\n\r\nThis is a bug kept in place to track the problem in JIRA - when SAL is upgraded this problem will be resolved. Other products are kept track in the following issues:\r\n * Stash: -STASH-3777-\r\n * Bamboo: -BAM-13987-\r\n * Confluence: -CONF-31627-\r\n\r\n(!) Any Atlassian application that has not had this bug fixed will require the workaround. For example, JIRA 6.1.3 is fixed however Confluence 5.3.1 is not so the applications would not be able to communicate with each other over HTTPS ports that are anything other than 443.\r\nh3. Workaround 1 - altering {{server.xml}}\r\n\r\nModify the remote application's\u00a0{{server.xml}} to include the following arguments in the HTTPS Connector and restart\u00a0the application:\r\n{code:xml|title=server.xml}\r\nproxyName=\"remote application server name\"\r\nproxyPort=\"remote application SSL port (e.g. 8443)\"\r\n\r\n{code}\r\nh3. Workaround 2 - using a Reverse Proxy\r\n\r\nHost JIRA behind a reverse-proxy, such as Apache using [Integrating JIRA with Apache using SSL|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Integrating+JIRA+with+Apache+using+SSL].\r\n\r\nThis will serve HTTPS on port 443 on Apache, however JIRA will be serving HTTP behind that proxy, effectively working around the problem. It is the recommendation of Atlassian Support to use this configuration over setting up HTTPS on Tomcat as the configuration of it is considered to be easier to achieve.\r\nh3. Workaround 3 - using Tomcat\r\n\r\nDepending upon the application(s) that are affected, running them directly on port 443 can correct the problem as per our [Application Stash seems to be offline in JIRA after creating an application link to Stash|https://confluence.atlassian.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=407725576] KB. This is only recommended for Windows installations as {{root}} access is required for Tomcat to listen on 443 - on Linux installs and this carries a significant security risk with it (if someone hacks Tomcat they have {{root}} access to the box).",
