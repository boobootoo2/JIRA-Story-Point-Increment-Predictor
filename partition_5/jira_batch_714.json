It would be convenient if JIRA also trigged webhooks on events related to users: for example, \"user created\", \"user added to group\", \"user removed from group\", \"user deleted\", etc.\r\n\r\nFor my specific use case, my company has a public-facing JIRA installation with Self Sign Up enabled, and no restrictions on domain. However, we want to automatically place users in JIRA groups based on the domain of the email address they use to sign up. (When employees of the company sign up, they should have more access and permissions than when non-employees sign up.) It would be very helpful to have an \"issue created\" webhook, so that the webhook handler could inspect the newly-created user via the REST API, and assign that user to the correct group based on the domain of their email address.",

Those are all your products, you cannot fill all of that for us instead of making us guess and go through your confluence pages (like this broken one for example from the latest version of JIRA https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/CRUCIBLE035/Configuring+Trusted+Applications+Authentication+for+an+Application+Link) to find list of URL patterns that are not even consistent.\r\nWhy does it take more than 1 click to link 2 atlassian products?\r\n\r\nSo, please, can you auto-fill all the answers for application links when linking atlassian products with each other? (or even don't even show them)\r\n\r\nthanks\r\n",

I would like to select for both the transition \"Close issue\" but I can only select one radio button of the displayed four. (They are in one \"radio button group\")\r\n\r\nSuggestion: I think there should be two \"radio button groups\". One for each workflow.\r\n\r\nWorkaround: Run the bulk change multiple times. Once for each workflow.\r\n\r\nThanks!",

Is there a way in JIRA to give all users on a given project permission to have a read-only view of all of the conditions on each of the transitions for the workflows on the project?

The solution was to edit the respective workflow and manually remove the validator from the transitions. Obviously this is really inconvenient especially if the disabled validator is used in a lot of workflows. So Jira should \"disable\" it on workflow level too and should not try to load the disabled validator. It must not modify the transitions, because when the validator is re-enabled from the \"manage Ad-ons\" cockpit, it should be activated in the configured workflows too.",

This library com.typesafe:config uses Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader() to search for configuration.\r\n\r\nExamination of this issue shown that the context classloader is set to WebappClassLoader in case when hook is applied while blueprint project is being created. If (for testing purposes) the hook is made a component module, then its context class loader is set to BundleDelegatingClassLoader which works as expected.\r\n\r\nIt's possible that other libraries that use context classloader would behave differently in different plugin modules and cause difficult to debug issues.\r\n\r\n\r\n ",
