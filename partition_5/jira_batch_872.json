When forced to choose the 'Mode' there's missing a clear short explanation for what these modus actually imply - at least not for less experienced administrators:\r\n\r\n---\r\n1. Public - Any user can sign up and post issues.\r\n2. Private - Only administrators can create new users.\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis is already slightly confusing as for less experienced Administrators the question may rise: \"So, what is it actually about? Posting issues or creating users?\". But, okay, most people should get it. And yes, I probably wouldn't have posted this if there isn't the confusing German translation:\r\n\r\n---\r\n1. \u00d6ffentlich - Alle Benutzer k\u00f6nnen sich anmelden und Vorg\u00e4nge erstellen.\r\n2. Privat - Nur Administratoren k\u00f6nnen neue Benutzer erstellen..\r\n---\r\n\r\nNo 1. translated back to English would read like : \"Any user can *log in* and create issues.\". It should correctly be translated with:\r\n\r\n1. \u00d6ffentlich - Jeder kann sich als neuer Benutzer registrieren und Vorg\u00e4nge erstellen.\r\n\r\nTo give emphasis on the idea of a \"public sign up\" I would also prefer an alternative for the original English text like:\r\n\r\n---\r\n1. Public - Anyone can sign up as a new user and post issues.\r\n2. Private - Only administrators can create new users.\r\n---\r\n\r\nMaybe last idea is a bit qirky... ;-) Anyway, just my 2 cents...\r\n\r\n\r\n",

I currently have 174 comment state stored in my cookie (4000 char). So new state can't be append to the cookie.\r\n\r\nI see 2 way to workaround that:\r\n1. Store 1 cookie per issue (I think in this case this allow a huge number of comment for an issue..) or comment.\r\n2. Add a webpage to clean the information comment by comment (I my case I could remove stored information regarding most comment because I no longer need to keep there hide/show state)\r\n\r\nBest regards,",

      "description": "{panel:bgColor=#e7f4fa}\n  *NOTE:* This suggestion is for *JIRA Server*. Using *JIRA Cloud*? [See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-20616].\n  {panel}\n\nFor the last 4 months I been using JIRA a lot.  As JIRA bug master I have a \"reason\" to really use JIRA.  And the way it works affects the way I can work.\r\n\r\nI think JIRA needs a new feature.  Lets call them Lists.\r\n\r\nA JIRA List is simply a set issues that have be \"placed\" together into the list.  Simple as that.\r\n\r\nh2. Why Not Filters\r\nFilters are \"views\" on some data.  If the issue data has matching attributes, then it presented by the filter.  When it not longer\r\nhas matching attributes, its not.\r\n\r\nLists differ in that once an issue is added to the list, it stays there.  An issue's data attributes can change as much as you\r\nlike but they are still in the list.\r\n\r\nOne does have to ensure that the data stays stable with lists compared to filters.  If you have a filter looking for unresolved bugs in v3.13.3 and some one changes the version accidently, then its out of the filter.  But with a list the inclusion condition is that at one point it was added to the list.\r\n\r\nh2. Lists Are More Personal\r\nLists are more personal and/or more specific than filters.  If I create a list its because I have decided what needs to go into it.\r\n\r\nIts not data attributes but rather human reasoning that puts issues in lists.\r\n\r\nI figure having lists in JIRA will increase its \"social value\" in a sense.  A group of people can be sharing a list, and making group decisions about whats in it or not.\r\n\r\nTo this end lists should be shareable (like filters and dashboards) but also have an \"editable\" permisson.  Hence a list can be shared with a person/group/role and optionally have a \"editable\" flag also with that person/group/role.\r\n\r\nh2. Lists Are More Transient\r\n\r\nI can imagine lists being used in an Agile teams.\r\n\r\nFor example a \"weekly iteration\" can be a list, created at the start of the iteration.\r\n\r\nTime is logged against the issues in the \"iteration\" list.\r\n\r\nOne could imagine that lists may be able to \"add\" up the time logged against the issues in them.\r\n\r\nWhen the iteration ends, the list can be kept or discarded.\r\n\r\nUnfinished tasks can be put in another \"iteration\" list by \"dragging/copying\" a list (via UI checkbox selection).\r\n\r\nCompare this to a filter scenario.\r\n\r\nOne has to have a custom field called \"Iteration\" or use something like Lables.\r\n\r\nThe field needs to be set the same value in\r\nall of the issues.\r\n\r\nThe creator of the tasks/issues has to be responsible for getting the value right to include the issues in the filter.\r\n\r\nThen when the iteration is over, the issues need to re-edited top move them to the next iteration.  A lot of management overhead for a weeks list of tasks/issues, that are transient in nature.\r\n\r\nh2. Lists Are More Work Process Oriented\r\n\r\nSo while fitlers may tell you what things are candidates to be done, lists can be used to make a \"subset\" of work you planned to do.\r\n\r\nSo from the 100 bugs you could possibly do, imagine a list of the \"most important\", a list of the \"ones needing product management review\", the ones that \"you thought had been addressed before\", a  \"watch list\", a \"performance list\" and so on.\r\n\r\nSo you can use lists as a.... wait for it... a TODO list.\r\n\r\nFilters arent really TODO lists.  Once they get large that are a less useful for this function.\r\n\r\nI can imagine that issue sin the list have a DONE status or not WITHIN the list.\r\n\r\nSo JRA-1234 might be done in list X and not done in list Y.  Contrast this with filters where once a field value is changed (say resolved) its done in all filters.\r\n\r\nh2. Simple Features Of Lists\r\n\r\nA list is an arbitary set of issues.\r\nLists have names (editable at all times like filters)\r\nLists are shareable\r\nJust like filters and dashboards\r\nNeed an extra flag to idicate that those who can see the list can edit the list\r\nThey would also be \"favouritable\"\r\nAnywhere you see an issue key, you get a like to add it to a list\r\nIn the issue nav / issue view page / whereever\r\nA pop up that shows favourite list\r\nAlso the ability to start a new list at any time\r\nList would primarily be show in portlets\r\nIssues can be created from within the list context\r\nMuch like the sub task quick create\r\nList can be created from other lists\r\nThe user goes into copy mode and \"selects\" the issues to copy across\r\nMaybe copy to existing lists or create a new list\r\n\r\nh2. Extended Features Of Lists\r\n\r\n(These are less clear in my mind or are much harder)\r\nList are sortable inside themselves\r\nA bit like the issue navigator\r\nMaybe by a standard set of fields\r\nMaybe via a set of customizeable fields (like the issue nav)\r\nLists can be part of a project\r\nNo one owns it, the project does\r\nIts on the Browse Project page\r\nMay create issues in a project can edit the lists (maybe not)\r\nList would have a TODO nature for each issue in the list\r\nSo an issue in a list of DONE/NOT DONE in terms of that list\r\nPeople can \"check\" off the issues as done\r\nLists can be retrieved/created via REST/SOAP\r\nJQL could be used on a list\r\nSelect from list='list name' where x y z",

This presents a problem for large user bases where display names are commonly in a \"surname, firstname\" format for surname sorting, typically:\r\n\r\nBirch, Jim\r\n\r\nWhere a list is displayed ambiguity arises.  This would occur in watch lists, project role lists, etc:\r\n\r\nBirch, Jim, Yossarian, John, Major, Major, Minderbinder, Milo \r\n\r\nThis is currently a problem for us and (I guess) others who copy user names from Active Directory.  It will become a problem for more people When Jira loads LDAP users from large directories.\r\n\r\nSuggested remedy: use a semicolon or a configurable character.
