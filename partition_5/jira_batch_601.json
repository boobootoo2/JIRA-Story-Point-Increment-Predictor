It doesn't make much sense to upper management to display a pie chart for one project that shows the percentage of \"In Progress\" issues in red for one project then to have another pie chart show \"In Progress\" issues in blue for another project. This can quickly get very confusing when updating upper management on project statuses. Furthermore, the color scheme does not make sense at all for the issue statuses. Associating the color green with \"To Do\" and red with \"Done\" makes zero sense to most people. It should be the other way around. Please fix this as it makes it very difficult to use Jira as a Program Management tool when its charts can cause miscommunication to upper management this easily.

      "description": "h3. Summary\r\n\r\nIn Jira's [REST API|https://docs.atlassian.com/software/jira/docs/api/REST/latest/], there are certain endpoints which accept and require a user's *UserKey* (represented in the database as app_user.user_key) as an input parameter or argument.\r\n\r\nHowever, the documentation suggests that the parameter should be the user's *UserName*, which is not necessarily the same value as the user's *UserKey*. In general, a user's *UserKey* is the first username that they were ever created with; if in the future, the user were to have their username changed for any reason, their *UserKey* will still be the original, first value.\r\n\r\nThis can confuse Admins and Users who try to use these REST API endpoints by providing a *UserName* (likely the value which they use to log in with, for example), and find that the endpoints do not function correctly.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the *UserKey* is not visible in Jira's UI. Admins can only find the *UserKey* by:\r\n* Querying against the database against the *app_user* database table\r\n* Using the *Get User* REST API endpoint, which does accept *UserName*, and returns the *UserKey* as a value (key)\r\n** $JIRA_URL/rest/api/2/user?username=<User_Name>\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Create a new Jira user (i.e. UserName = test)\r\n# Immediately change their username (i.e. UserName = newtest)\r\n# Add them to a Project Role in any project\r\n# Attempt to use the *+Delete Actor+* method for the api/2/project/{projectIdOrKey}/role endpoint to remove them from the Project Role\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nAn HTTP 204 is returned per the REST API documentation, and the user is no longer in the Project Role for the project in question.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nAn HTTP 204 is returned, but the user is still there in the Project Role for the project in question. No information is provided to the admin clearly demonstrating what has gone wrong.\r\n \r\nh3. Workaround\r\nThe behavior of the REST API endpoints which demonstrate this behavior cannot be changed. Instead, Admins and Users must first identify the *UserKey* through either of the methods described above before using these endpoints.\r\n* Querying against the database against the *app_user* database table\r\n* Using the *Get User* REST API endpoint, which does accept *UserName*, and returns the *User Key* as a value\r\n** $JIRA_URL/rest/api/2/user?username=<User_Name>",

In secure environments, administrators should have the ability to restrict the ability to copy attachments outside of the original issue.\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\nEither implement a flag to disable the copying of attachments globally, or implement it as a per-project feature.\r\n\r\nh3. Why this is important\r\nCloning of attachments may lead to the leak of sensitive data (depending on who the clone is shared with).\r\nAdditionally, when using an add-on such as [Smart Attachments|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1212507/smart-attachments?hosting=server&tab=overview] to categorize attachments (and place restrictions on them), such data is lost during a clone operation.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\nAdd the following css script in your Jira Announcement Banner (by following the steps on   [Configuring an announcement banner KB|https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiraserver/configuring-an-announcement-banner-938846985.html]), *Clone Attachments* checkbox will disappear:\r\n{code:xml}\r\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\r\n// if an XHR request completed\r\nAJS.$( document ).ajaxComplete(function( event,request, settings ) {\r\n  // if it was a click on the Clone button\r\n  if(settings.url.indexOf('CloneIssueDetails') >= 0){\r\n    // hide the attachments checkbox\r\n      AJS.$('form#clone-issue.aui > div.form-body > fieldset > fieldset.group > div.checkbox').each(function(){\r\n        if($( this ).html().indexOf(\"clone-issue-clone-attachments\") >= 0){\r\n          $( this ).hide();\r\n        }\r\n      });\r\n  }\r\n});\r\n</script>\r\n{code}",

Workaround\r\n\r\nNo workaround if Webhooks will be used. But if the aim is to increase the performance of creating issue,\u00a0then Webhooks should be disabled or JQLs should be tuned.\r\nh3. Fix\r\n\r\nAsynchronous Webhooks were introduced in version 8.19.1. They should significantly improve the performance of Webhooks with complex JQL queries. To enable them:\r\n # manually enable the \"_com.atlassian.jira.webhookEventsAsyncProcessing_\" feature\u00a0flag [with following instruction|https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirakb/enable-dark-feature-in-jira-959286331.html].\r\n # restart your Jira instance (or each node in case of DC)\u00a0",
