      "description": "When bulk merging versions either the Affects Versions field.\r\n\r\n Recently we decided to make the version list more manageable by merging our nightly build versions into their subsequent released versions. I spent a long time today doing this, for 5 years worth of builds. I then decided to mark our released versions as released in Jira - until now we've been tracking releases externally but not in Jira. One of the release screens flagged an unresolved issue: PIRATES-47084. Then I noticed something bad: the Affects Version field has been cleared out, now reporting 'None'! The Fix Version changed from a deleted version to the corresponding released version as I expected.\r\n\r\nI made a sampling of issues and found that for most issues, both Fix Version and Affects Version were cleared. (PIRATES-32690). In some issues both fields changed. (PIRATES-52709) In some issues Fix Version changed and Affects Version was cleared. (PIRATES-47084) In some issues Affects Version changed and Fix Version was cleared. (PIRATES-53104)\r\nFor some issues there is an entry in the change history, for others there is not. (PIRATES-32690)\r\nAffects Version for PIRATES-52647 changed from 1.18.59.0 to 1.18.60.0 but in the same merge transaction Affects Version for PIRATES-52631 was cleared from 1.18.55.0 to None.\r\n\r\nIt appears that if the merge from and merge into versions were adjacent in the version list the field changed and if they were non-adjacent the field was cleared.",

While you can use the FishEye plugin in JIRA to auto-update tickets based on changesets in FishEye, there is no way to do the opposite: auto-link to FishEye changesets from comments in JIRA.\r\n\r\nTrac handles this very well in that you can enter [123] or r123 and either will automatically link directly to changeset 123.  I understand that the FishEye scenario is slightly more complex in that there may be multiple projects in FishEye, so this may require adding a project key to FishEye like you have in JIRA and Bamboo.  So, I could do something like:\r\n\r\nHHH[123]\r\n\r\nin a comment in JIRA, and JIRA would automatically link it to changeset 123 within the HHH project in FishEye.",

In addition to that, please make sure that no issue that has multiple Multi Select List values. Otherwise,  the issue will have no Select List value after conversion.

      "description": "The WSDL from the SOAP RPC plugin after a call to a method returning a RemoteWorkLog will include a RemoteWorklogImpl. This is an internal class that should not be exposed to SOAP.\r\n\r\nThis problem should not cause any user visible problems, we are just exposing our implementation details as part of the WSDL which could make them harder to change later.\r\n\r\nI have been able to actually track down the cause of this issue. Basically, the {{RemoteWorklogImpl}} will not be seen until the first time a method with a {{RemoteWorklog}} is called. This is caused by a \"feature\" of Axis (our SOAP engine) in that it looks at the runtime type of the service result rather than its compile time type. For example:\r\n\r\n{code:xml}\r\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?>\r\n\r\n<soapenv:Envelope xmlns:soapenv=\"http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/\" xmlns:xsd=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema\" \r\n\txmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\">\r\n\t<soapenv:Body>\r\n\t\t<ns1:getWorklogsResponse soapenv:encodingStyle=\"http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/encoding/\" xmlns:ns1=\"http://soap.rpc.jira.atlassian.com\">\r\n\t\t\t<getWorklogsReturn soapenc:arrayType=\"ns2:RemoteWorklog[1]\" xsi:type=\"soapenc:Array\" xmlns:ns2=\"http://beans.soap.rpc.jira.atlassian.com\" xmlns:soapenc=\"http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/encoding/\">\r\n\t\t\t\t<getWorklogsReturn href=\"#id0\"/>\r\n\t\t\t</getWorklogsReturn>\r\n\t\t</ns1:getWorklogsResponse>\r\n\t\t<multiRef id=\"id0\" soapenc:root=\"0\" soapenv:encodingStyle=\"http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/encoding/\" xsi:type=\"ns3:RemoteWorklogImpl\" \r\n\t\t\txmlns:soapenc=\"http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/encoding/\" xmlns:ns3=\"http://service.soap.rpc.jira.atlassian.com\">\r\n\t\t\t<author xsi:type=\"xsd:string\">admin</author>\r\n\t\t\t<comment xsi:type=\"xsd:string\">This is a test</comment>\r\n\t\t\t<created xsi:type=\"xsd:dateTime\">2009-12-07T08:16:27.158Z</created>\r\n\t\t\t<groupLevel xsi:type=\"xsd:string\" xsi:nil=\"true\"/>\r\n\t\t\t<id xsi:type=\"xsd:string\">10000</id>\r\n\t\t\t<roleLevelId xsi:type=\"xsd:string\" xsi:nil=\"true\"/>\r\n\t\t\t<startDate xsi:type=\"xsd:dateTime\">2009-12-07T08:16:00.000Z</startDate>\r\n\t\t\t<timeSpent xsi:type=\"xsd:string\">3h</timeSpent>\r\n\t\t\t<timeSpentInSeconds xsi:type=\"xsd:long\">10800</timeSpentInSeconds>\r\n\t\t\t<updateAuthor xsi:type=\"xsd:string\">admin</updateAuthor>\r\n\t\t\t<updated xsi:type=\"xsd:dateTime\">2009-12-07T08:16:27.158Z</updated>\r\n\t\t</multiRef>\r\n\t</soapenv:Body>\r\n</soapenv:Envelope>\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nNotice that even though the SOAP reply is a {{ns2:RemoteWorklog}} (the static interface type) AXIS actually sends back a subclass {{ns3:RemoteWorklogImpl}} (the actual runtime type). By doing this AXIS updates its internal structures such that the {{RemoteWorklogImpl}} now appears in the WSDL.\r\n\r\nThis problem is related to JRA-13801. Tokes worked around the problem in JRA-13801 in a way that allowed .NET soap to work. I guess the complete solution would be to remove the RemoteWorklogImpl as we don't need it. We have to be careful with backwards compatibility.",

UserAgentUtilImpl does not check for null and throws an NPE.\r\n\r\nTo reproduce: \r\n1) From the command-line, run:\r\n{noformat}\r\ntelnet <hostname> <port>\r\n{noformat}\r\n2) Send the following command:\r\n{noformat}\r\nGET http://<hostname>:<port>/secure/Dashboard.jspa HTTP/1.0\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nYou should get an error page back from JIRA and a stack trace in the logs.\r\nI'm not sure why users are sending requests with no user-agent, but it is possible that some web crawlers are doing so.\r\n\r\nThe null user-agent value is retrieved by AccessKeyHelperImpl and passed to
