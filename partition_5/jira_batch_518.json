When a ticket is raised which requires someone's approval, then how is the approver notified ? \r\n2. How to change Issue type within the same ProjectCurrently, as per tool if we want to change te issue type let's say from Service Request to Incident, then it can be only done by moving it to different Project and then select the Issue Type\r\n3. Why the issues are coming in descending order of Key inside iDMCP2.x project, whereas it's coming in ascending order inside iDMCP Service Desk Project \r\n4. When we try to change Issue type of a particular ticket(ISD -4, from Service Request to Change), then it tells to move the ticket to another Project(from iDMCP Service Desk Project to iDCMP2.x project). After moving the ticket(ISD-4) to iDCMP2.x, the ticket is still under the queue of iDMCP Service Desk Project with changed Issue type(Change) and not iDCMP2.x project \r\n5. Time to resolution starts after default of 8hrs. How to configure that ? \r\n6. Currently there is no time out session for Jira Service Desk User. How do we configure it for security purposes ? \r\n7. Is end user notified about our actions or comments in each stage of ticket ? \r\n8. How to define SLA depending on the combination of Issue type and Priority ? \r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0Thanks.\r\n",

The expected behaviour is that(by design/expectation) JSD should share the newly created issue with members of the same organization as the reporter.\r\nh3. Environment\r\n * Jira Service Desk Cloud\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Create 2 organizations\r\n # Add a customer account to both organizations\r\n # Send in a request via email as a test\r\n\r\nh3.

Notes\r\n * When creating a request via the customer portal, a customer can only select a single organization at a time, but agents in JSD are able to associate/share a single issue with multiple organizations\r\n * If customers are only supposed to share issues with 1 organization at a time(current customer portal behaviour), then the \"Organizations\" field in the full issue view in Jira needs to be changed to a single group(organization) picker - otherwise multi-organization sharing support should be added to JSD so customers can share with multiple organizations from the portal or via email\r\n\r\nh3.
