What is the problem?\nUsers who are logged in to Service Desk are able to see KB search results through the Customer Portal, but are forced to log in to Confluence to see the full article.\nThis is counterintuitive to customers because they feel that if they can see the search results they are already authenticated.\nOnce customers sign in once with their credentials they are able to view articles.\n\nh2. Who experiences this problem?\nThis problem exists only in Server (Server/Server or Server/Cloud - if that is a thing).\nOne of the reporting customers is using JIRA User Directory for their shared user base which does not support SSO.\nThis is not a problem for Cloud/Cloud instances as they have a shared user base and SSO.\nThis is also not a problem if the customer is using Crowd and the JSD and Confluence instances have the same domain as this supports SSO.\n\nh2. Why does this happen?\nSearching and viewing use different auth contexts.\nSearch uses impersonation to fetch and return the search results from a Confluence endpoint.\nThis requires impersonation to be setup through the Applinks which is what the customer has done.\nViewing an article renders an iframe in the page from the Confluence domain which is why it requires further authentication (to get a Confluence session ID).\n\nh2. How do we solve it?\nRemove the redirection to Confluence by bringing the login prompt into Service Desk in the modal dialog which currently links to Confluence. ",

Summary\n\nIf the current assignee of a JIRA Service Desk issue does not have Assignable permissions, Customers cannot be added to the Participants field through the Customer Portal.\n\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\n\n# Create a request in a SD\n# Assign it to a user, use \"agent\"\n# Go to user and roles and remove \"agent\" as a service desk team member\n# Try to add any user as a request participant\n\nh3. Expected Results\n\n* Request participant added.\n* Assignee field should fail on its own and not blow up another field.\n\nh3. Actual Results\n\nThe error \"Failed to update participants field, errors: \" occurs and the field is not updated as per the attached screenshot.\n\nh3. Workaround\n\nProvide the assignee with the correct permissions. They may need to be unassigned / reassigned the issue for this to work.\n\nh3. Notes\n\nThis issue should be reproducible by making any other field fail to update while trying to add request participants, the steps above are just the way it was discovered in a support case.",

[See the corresponding bug report|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSDSERVER-3714].\n  {panel}\n\nh3. Summary\nWhen searching in Customer Portal, modifying/deleting a previous keyword does not auto populate search results. \n\nh3. Environment\n* Issue occurs in Firefox, Safari and Chrome, though the replication steps are slightly different. The issue is most obvious in Chrome. \n\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\n# Create a JSD project\n# Link a Confluence space to the project in project settings and make sure customers can access space/project.\n# Visit the customer portal page to your project and type in a search word. Notice that as you type, there is a spinning circle to indicate that the system is searching.\n# Once the search results auto populate, backspace to delete the word.\n# Begin typing in a new search word. If the search auto populates, complete steps 3-5 again, until you find that nothing populates or happens when you type in search words. \n\nh3. Expected Results\nWhen typing in a search word in the customer portal, articles should auto populate or a message saying \u201cNo solutions found.\u201d should appear (if nothing matches the search). The below screenshot shows an example of a search for a keyword that does not exist in the KB:\n!search_expected.png|thumbnail!\nIf I delete the word *MacBook*, and try typing in a new search term, the portal should begin to auto populate responses to my new search term. \n \nh3. Actual Results\nThe first search works, however if you delete and try typing in a new word, nothing will populate. An example of this can be seen in the following screenshot:\n!search_actual.png|thumbnail!\n\nDepending upon which browser you\u2019re using, you may need to delete and re-add keywords multiple times to replicate. In Chrome it happens typically after one time. In Safari and Firefox it can take up to 4 or 5 times of typing in a keyword, deleting, and adding a new word. \nNothing is apparent in the logs, aside from the following:\n{noformat}\n2016-04-26 20:05:36.501498500 2016-04-26 20:05:36,501 JIRA-EventThread-271 WARN rfuerst 1205x12718x1 1ekp03u 4.15.43.214 /servicedesk/customer/portal/2 [c.a.workcontext.api.WorkContextManager] Created WorkContext leniently (see: go/work-context-lenient-mode-errors) thread: JIRA-EventThread-271\n2016-04-26 20:05:37.419404500 2016-04-26 20:05:37,419 JIRA-EventThread-273 WARN rfuerst 1205x12718x1 1ekp03u 4.15.43.214 /servicedesk/customer/portal/2 [c.a.workcontext.api.WorkContextManager] Created WorkContext leniently (see: go/work-context-lenient-mode-errors) thread\n{noformat}\n\nDevelopment console does not show anything either:\n!dev_console.png|thumbnail!\n\nh3.Workaround\nThe current workaround is to completely reload the customer portal page and re-initiate a search.

Problem statement\nService Desk currently allows Agents to create requests on behalf of customers.\nThese issues are treated as if they have been created by the customer, and generate a notification that indicates this. This can create confusion on what the source of an issue has been, as there currently is no way for a customer to see the difference between issues created by them, or on their behalf. Only Agents are capable to see the difference, for which they have to check the History tab of the issue in JIRA (not Service Desk)\n\nh2. Suggestion\nWhenever an agent creates an issue on behalf of another user, send out a notification that reflects this, instead of using the current create request notification. This way, a customer can see the difference between issues created by themself, and those created on their behalf.\n",

Problem Definition\nCurrently it is possible to create two different mail handlers for JIRA SD\n# *JIRA Service Desk Project Administration > Email requests* (hereby refered to as _SD mail handler_)\n# *JIRA Administration > System > Incoming Mail* and assign to a Service Desk project (hereby refered to as _non-SD mail handler_)\n\nThis causes problem/confusion to many JIRA Administrators during troubleshooting because some are not aware of this change or its implication since JIRA 7: [Why do users need application access to create issues in JIRA 7?|https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/31663613/why-do-users-need-application-access-to-create-issues-in-jira-7]\n\nSome JIRA Administrators will attempt to create a _non-SD mail handler_ for the SD project in *JIRA Administration > System > Incoming Mail* and discover that the mail handler fails to generate the issue from their customer's email. This is due to the reasons explained in the link above (SD customers do not have application access). They are not aware that only the _SD mail handler_ will allow the creation of issues from the email of users without application access.\n\nh3. Suggested Solution\n# Prevent a _non-SD mail handler_ from being assigned to a Service Desk project\n# When JIRA Administrators clicks on \"Add Incoming Mail Handler\" in *JIRA Administration > System > Incoming Mail*, display a list of projects.Depending on the selected project, (SD or non-SD project) create the appropriate mail handler\n# Alternatively, force the creation of Service Desk mail handler in *JIRA Service Desk Project Administration > Email requests* only, but display it as read-only in *JIRA Administration > System > Incoming Mail*\n\nh3.

Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nAs such, being able to define an email domain as requirement for public signup, can provide a small degree of safety, while at the same time prevent a lot of overhead for the administrators.\r\n\r\nFor instance, if a Service Desk has public signup enabled, and an email domain has been defined, the Service Desk will only allow account creation if the source address conforms to the defined domain.",

There also seems to be no way to share a calendar even if the names are the same, no way to change the default of Repeat and no way to import so that it is easier to track bank holidays.\n- Is it possible to set a company calendar and share it for different service desks? If not, is this planned to be done at some point?\n- Is it possible to import the dates into a calendar to save manually entering into each one every time (this is getting quite time consuming, especially if importing historical issues)?\n- Is it possible to change the default for Repeat to NEVER as the dates for bank holidays are predominately not on the same date year to year and this is a pain if we cannot import or share calendars.

And we use the comments feature to send information to each other in order to clarify/find out what to do.\nSince you could add participants and remove participants along the way, it\u00b4s difficult to see in the GUI to whom the notifications has been sent to or not. So in some cases it ends up with (our customer usually) adding a new comment, and @:ing all participants again just to be sure.\n\nh3. Suggested Solution\nAdd a notification information to the comment itself and / or a notification menu. As this will somewhat demystify the notifications sent.\nExample shown as below:\n !2016-04-06 new_picture.png|thumbnail! \n",

Summary\nWhen the mail puller encounters an message in the mail channel mailbox originating from an invalid formatted \"From\" field, the mail puller will not be able to process that message, and continuously loop on this message, effectively rendering the mail pulling process broken. A correctly formatted looks like \"name@domain.extension\".\nA known source for this issue is Microsoft Outlook 365, where certain messages originate from \"Microsoft Outlook\" opposed to a valid email address in the \"From\" field.\n\n\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\n# Ensure the mailbox configured as mail channel in a Service Desk project contains an email originating from a source which does not provide a valid formatted email address in the \"From\" field as described in the summary\n# Have the mail puller pull and process the email automatically\n\nh3. Expected Results\nThe mail gets pulled into the database.\nIn this case, it is not relevant for the email to get processed further beyond this point.\nOnce the email has been pulled, the mail puller should continue to pull mails from the mail box.\n\nh3. Actual Results\nThe mail puller gets stuck on the incorrect email and will continuously loop on it, instead of moving on to the next mail in the mailbox.\nThe atlassian-jira-incoming-mail.log file will display the following error for each attempt to pull the mail in question:\n{code}\nUnable to create issue with message.\njavax.mail.internet.AddressException: Local address contains control or whitespace in string ``Microsoft Outlook''\n{code} \n\nh3. Notes\nThe relevant message in Microsoft Outlook is an automatically generated one to inform the user of certain changes on the mail platform, or the welcoming message when starting to use the product for the first time. So far, no other mail providers are known to cause similar issues.\n\nh3.Workaround\nDelete the offending message from the mail box. This will allow the mail puller to proceed from that point onwards.",

Summary\nIf an Agent adds an attachment to a customer request, and chooses \"Add to issue only\" instead of \"Share with the customer\", the attachment in question will not be visible to the customer.\nHowever, the customer *is* capable of downloading the file if it has the direct url to the attachment.\nFor instance, a direct url to an attachment is as follows:\n{code}\n<baseurl>/servicedesk/customershim/secure/attachment/10102/10102_<attachmentname>\n{code}\n\nChanging the {{/10102/}} segment to any other ID allows for the customer to download the attachment matching that ID. The last segment of the url is not relevant, so it is not required to know the exact file name in order to download the file.\n\n(!) This only works for attachments which are placed under an issue to which the customer in question has access. Attachments located under issues to which the customer does not have access, can *not* be downloaded by the customer. However, it *is* possible for the customer to download files which have been hidden using the attaching method as described above. Whether or not these attachments should be accessible for the customer is currently not certain.\n\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\n# Create a request as a customer\n# Add an attachment to the request as customer\n# Add an attachment to the request as Agent, and choose \"Add to issue only\"\n# As customer, copy the link to the attachment added it added, and increase the ID by 1\n\nh3. Expected Results\nSince the attachment added by the Agent is not visible from the customer view, it should not be accessible for the customer\n\nh3. Actual Results\nAfter inserting the adjusted url, the customer gets prompted with a download dialogue.\n\nh3. Notes\nAttachment ID increase by 1 each time one gets added to the instance. The above reproduction steps only work when between the customer and the agent adding an attachment, no other attachments have been added which are not accessible by the customer.\n",
