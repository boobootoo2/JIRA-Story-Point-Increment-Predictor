That way you can setup many projects quickly. ",

Since, the colon punctuation mark is not a special character that is supported for text searching, it is cumbersome to search for bugs that contain specifically the (RN:) text string. Also, if a separate Release Notes field (box) is available, it should also be configurable by using the Tools > Configure Columns feature. As a result, one can search for any bugs which contain any, or specific text in the Release Notes field (box) and also configure the result of the query to display the contents of the Release Notes field (box). Previous in-house bug tracking systems (Mantis or ITS) contain a separate Release Notes field, so it should be possible to add one to the JIRA bug tracking system.",

Creating a ticket - Is there a way to make a POST request to create a ticket? If not is this a feature that will be added anytime soon or is there a work-around? This is one of the most important actions and without it the API is of no use.\r\n\r\n2. More general feedback as its not critical, but it would be nice to have an action that allows me to list all the available projects in the account / or that the user has access to. I guess I would expect the response to only contain summary data such as name and project key.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nScott Sherwood",

I found out that you can't make a bulk change that easily in these kind of situations where the issues are from projects assigned in two different workflows (I also read the issues related to this matter from this Jira issue manager). But still I wanted to get the action done with that bulk change and I went to the next step, now making the change only for one issue per time. But I ran into a bug.\r\n\r\nPlease check out the attachment and you will see:\r\n- \"This change will affect 1 issues\" and in\r\n- \"Change Fix Version(s)\" there is a text: NOTE. This operation can be performed only on issues from ONE project. \r\n\r\nOnly 1 issue can hardly be recorded in two different projects, so what's this Note for and why can't I change the fix version for only this one issue? Not that this would be a major issue for me but it is better to have as few bugs in a software as possible, right?",

Summary\r\nEmail Filter Subscriptions are still sent after an user is marked as deactivated.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Create an user belonging to jira-users group\r\n# Deactivate the user\r\n# Create a filter and subscribed to jira-users group\r\n#* Filter used: issuekey in issueHistory() ORDER BY lastViewed DESC\r\n#* Ticked the option to still send an email even there's no issue found.\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nJIRA would send subscriptions only to active users.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nAll users belonging to the jira-users group receive the filter subscription email, regardless of being deactivated.\r\n\r\nh3. Notes\r\nThis happens both when deactivating the user by unchecking the 'Active' checkbox in the user edit screen, or removing the user from all groups.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround:\r\nSome sql queries would need to remove the filter subscriptions from the database with the reference:\r\n* http://wiki.customware.net/repository/display/ATLASSIAN/How+to+delete+filters+and+subscriptions+added+by+other+users\r\n",

      "description": "This is an enhancement request that would allow working with attachments much more convenient. Now if you add an attachment to JIRA issue it will only be listed above but it is very tough and confusing to guess which attachment was added where. Imagine that you work on a customer issue and support adds 3 log files at 3 different times into JIRA. You always comment: Get me the log and they comment Here it is. Then you see 3 attachments called CustomerLog or so. Now it is difficult to guess which log is which. You must compare the attachment dates to the comment dates which may be tricky if this is within one day. Also you always need to scroll down and up for it. I know that you have the option to add a comment referencing the attachment but nobody is doing that because it requires additional work. After adding the attachment you need to write an extra comment and manually create the reference which means manually typing the file name of the attachment and checking that you really did it correctly. This is so tedious that nobody is doing that which means that there is either a big mess in attachments or people put content directly to comments rather than using attachments which makes it really hard to scroll the issue all the way down.\r\n\r\nCould such a feature be added that when attaching a file to a JIRA issue it would automatically add a comment of the form\r\n{noformat}\r\nThe user XY attached the file [^File name]\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nThat would make it much easier to work with attachments.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Although the \"Preview\" button renders the text correctly, one you input the text, and go into the ticket, under Work Log tab, the text replaces Carriage Returns for spaces.\r\n\r\nCould reproduce this behaviour in both 4.2.1 and 4.2.2.\r\n\r\nCheers\r\nThiago Prisco\r\nAtlassian Support",

Each link is put together by combining a path fragment with a prefix and suffix. The utility class allows for exactly one prefix+suffix pair. This means we can't use it in Studio, because we need to point users to entirely different sites depending on whether they are in Studio mode vs JIRA Standalone mode.\r\n\r\nWould it be possible to make this more flexible? I think a simple solution could be to make defaultHelpPath and helpPaths instance fields rather than static, so that multiple instances of HelpUtil can be created for different .properties files (I can't see why those fields need to be static).",

However, when trying to create release notes for Aeroplane version 2.0, we do not capture the issues that were fixed in Wings version 1.0 and Engine version 1.2.  We can extract these issues easily using a filter.  However, the filter does not offer a TEXT view that can be used to simply copy and paste the results into a txt file.  A release notes view for the filter results that uses the release notes template would be ideal for people who wish to generate hierarchical release notes using filters.\r\n\r\nReplicating every sub-project issue into the top-level project is a time consuming and causes too many replicated issues.\r\n\r\n",

Was in light use last week with little in the way of complaints (one was I forgot the SVN plugin), it'll see normal use this week.\r\n\r\nI don't know if it helps from your side, but the two Atlassian pages that helped the most were:\r\nhttp://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Starting+JIRA+Standalone+automatically+on+Linux\r\nhttp://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Setting+up+JIRA+Standalone+and+MySQL+on+Linux\r\n\r\nPoints that I wasn't quite prepared for that were of note\r\n\r\n* starting jira with sudo is a good way to cause weird problems later (as root starts to own bits of the app directory)\r\n* uninstalling a plugin (fisheye) means repacking a .jar file without it\r\n* SQL database should be made with InnoDB and utf-8 defaults (this is mentioned in the comments of the above page but not in the main text)\r\n* the jira log tells you when it's ready for viewing (watching it with \"less +F\" was very helpful), which really helps when you're wondering when the xml import is finished (~20min for us)\r\n* the xml import process doesn't bring across the SVN password for the SVN plugin - that had to be re-entered, though the rest of the settings were imported\r\n",
