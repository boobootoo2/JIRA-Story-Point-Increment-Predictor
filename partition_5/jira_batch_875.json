This change automatically updates the clone.\r\nOr, if possible this update could be in both directions. So if the clone is updated, it updates the original as well.\r\n\r\nIs there any functionality in JIRA right now?\r\n\r\nGreetings\r\nMichael",

As this affects a large portion of our 1000-odd users, this prevents us from upgrading to 4.0.1. This is a disadvantage of the gadget architecture, and I cannot see it going away soon.\r\n\r\nI'd like to air a half-baked idea: Would it be possible to construct an *optional, alternative dashboard* rendering engine, which would render the gadget, including all its data _on the server_? It would act as a kind of \"proxy\" to the user's browser, in fact emulating a browser and sending one stream of fully rendered HTML to the client's browser. As this would all happen in one request between client and server, latency and JavaScript performance would not matter. Within the gadgets, all the same mechanisms and calls as in 4.0 would take place, but on the server, with virtually zero latency. \r\n\r\nAs said, this would be an optional alternative Dashboard, perhaps best controlled through a user setting, and/or an URL parameter.\r\n\r\nIt would keep all the API and advantages of open gadgets, without the performance penalties incurred in legacy / constrained environments.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nMartin ",

And while that was a step forward, it seems now we need an extra \"share permission\" that of \"editable by others\".\r\n\r\nThe use case is that some one in a team can create (and hence own) the shared dashboard or filter, but others in the team can \"edit/improve\" the situation by being able to edit the dashboard/filter.   This promotes better team integration.\r\n\r\nIn terms of code change, this is very doable.  Currently the dashboard service and search request service check for ownership when deciding if the person can edit a dashboard/filter.  It could check also for this new \"edit permission\" and retain the same interface otherwise.",

Problem Definition\r\n\r\nCurrently, the issue view screen is showing in sections and the custom fields are grouped under *Details* or *People* section. In some cases, we would like to reorder the section which is not possible in JIRA.\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n * Allow the ability to reposition the section based on user's needs.\r\n\r\nh3. Why this is important\r\n\r\nIn some cases, customer needs to reorder the section based on the usage. For example:\r\n * Description section which describe the issue is preferable to place on the first section.\r\n * Customer links the issues a lot and it is preferable to reorder the *Issue Links* section, else customer has to scroll down those issue links to be able to view the regular screens.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n{{*Note: Please comment to add in different scenarios*}}\r\n----\r\n{panel:title=Original Request}\r\n\"Image/File Attachments\" and \"Issu Links\" section appears on top of regular issue screens in the view issue layout. We use issue linking a lot, and sometimes we have more than 300 issues those link to a single issue and this means we have to scroll down those 300 issue links to be able to view the regular screens.It would be great if we can play around with the issue view screen sections layout just like we can do for portlets on dashboard.\r\n{panel}",

It is good to maintain the same print feature in the latest releases.\r\n\r\nAs per discussion with support developer, we decided that it is a bug in the jira 4.0 \r\n\r\nAnd we have support request for this bug- https://support.atlassian.com/browse/JSP-50228\r\n\r\nPlease find the attached dashboard PDF for reference.",

This is not the case, simply calling it will result in an error saying that the version can't be _unreleased_.  The method actually doesn't release the version, it changes the release state based on the argument passed to it, if \"released\" is set to true, it releases, if it's set to false, it unreleases.  At very least, the documentation should be updated to reflect this, better would be to rename the method to something that better describes it.",

My company uses a standard employee id to use for the JIRA username. With little knowledge, I designed a script that can cycle through employee id numbers and submit them to the reset password form. This process can repeat through an entire list of associate employee id numbers.\r\n\r\nI am in the IT Security department so my research was more of a proof of concept, however, the script could be written by anyone. This causes an annoyance for users, and could potentially hinder the performance of the JIRA server (which we are running in a VM) and might even impact our MS Exchange servers which have to process all password reset confirmation emails.\r\n\r\nThe password reset prompt should be able to share the CAPTCHA functionality that the JIRA admin can enable for the account sign-up form. The solution is not perfect, however, it is a step in the right direction for disabling bot attacks that can reset every users password.",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-20141].\n  {panel}\n\nOne thing we have a problem with from a usability point of view (as do you I realize when entering this enhancement request) is that the number of Component/s / Versions that are available in the drop downs can be very long, making it awkward to actually select components/versions. \r\n\r\nI know it is possible to search by typing, but it doesn't work that well in practice any more, as we've had to prepend e.g. our components with a category to make it possible to find anything at all...\r\n\r\nI would propose a couple of possible improvements to this, but I'm sure you can think of even better approaches - but to get you started:\r\n\r\n1. List browser sizes should be configurable for e.g. \"Create issue\" screen, allowing them to be bigger - this would be a simple change, but make things much, much better than currently (only seeing 5 items is just not usable, I'd like 10-15 - having this per-user configurable would be one option).\r\n\r\n2. Add some more sophisticated search facility that doesn't just to prefix searching, but does full string matching and restricts the displayed results, similar to how iTunes/Spotlight searches work \r\n\r\n3. Some sort of favorite history with a separate checkbox to \"show all\" for the list, with the ability to hide things over time - e.g. I'd only work with very few releases at a given point in time, although there may be a fair amount of historical releases that are still active out at customer sites and thus displayed\r\n\r\nThe main problem though, is really that the large UI workflow stumble-block, is to find the right item in these lists which can be long (we have the same problem with our \"Customer\" list where we assign which customer a case affects). Just as a reference, it took me probably 30-60 seconds just to find the right component to file this case for, as I had to slowly scroll through the list.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
