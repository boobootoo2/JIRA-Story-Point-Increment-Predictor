I try to push, pull, etc (some kind of server action). The set up auth fails, so git/SourceTree falls back to un/pw auth, prompting me for a password. Ok, makes sense, everything is good.\r\n\r\nProblem: Well, instead of using un/pw auth, I'm going to cancel and fix my setup, then try again. Oh wait, canceling the un/pw auth doesn't really work. The dialog just pops up again. And again. And again. And again. About 10 times in total it seems.\r\n\r\nIn my particular scenario, my remote is 'git@mygitserver:myuser/myrepo.git'. I have one key pair set up for msysgit on the command line and one PuTTy key pair I use for SourceTree. I have pageant loading at login. But of course it doesn't load my key at launch, without tinkering with the shortcut. Whatever. The point is, key auth fails, so git/ST falls back to SSH un/pw auth, and thus prompts me for my un/pw. Except I don't have an SSH un/pw, so I cancel. But cancelling doesn't work unless I cancel it 6 or 8 or WAY TO MANY TIMES. I really should only have to cancel once. It's a 'Cancel' button. If you press the cancel button, it should CANCEL auth. WTF?",

However, since the diff viewer and the new file status view were introduced in v1.6 most of us experience unpleasant lags (multiple seconds) and frequent hangs where we have to kill the application. Although, the new views look much nicer, they seem to update more often and to use considerably more time and memory to do so. \r\n\r\nMany of us are now frustrated up to the point where look into alternative clients or revert to the old 1.5 versions. We do appreciate SourceTree and all the work you guys have put into it and we'd love to continue using it.

I have confirmed that the executable is locatable in both the system and the user PATH environment variables.  Unfortunately the problem is usually so fleeting that further research has proved difficult -- by the time we click through the error message the problem has resolved itself.
