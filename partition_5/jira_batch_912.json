Actual Results\r\nThe following is found on the export {{<del><ins>filesz</del>---</ins>}}\r\n\r\nh3.Workaround\r\n# Open Word file on a text editor\r\n# Search for: {{<del><ins>}}\r\n# If after the {{<del><ins>}} there is some text and then a {{</del>}} then that comment was not generated correctly.\r\n#* a healthy code would close tags in inverse order that were open. e.g: {{<del><ins>SomeText</ins></del>}}\r\n#* wrong code {{<del><ins>SomeText</del></ins>}}\r\n# Find the issue in JIRA by searching any text related to that comment in JIRA search tool and then inside the issue to find the comment.\r\n# Wrap the comment or the code part in \\{noformat} tags\r\n# Export to Word again",

The requested site is either unavailable or cannot be found. Please try again later.\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nTyping the URL or using a bookmark works in Safari and Firefox.\r\n\r\nDoing packet inspection on the requests/reponses shows that the HTTP GET request is basically the same.

Why log changes of applicable workflow, and not change of applicable permission scheme, notification scheme, or issue type scheme?\r\n\r\n*In practice*: there are various disadvantages:\r\n - Messing with the issue history causes the 'Updated' date to be changed. Lots of people already complained about this and we 'fixed' it (JRA-7831).\r\n - It simply fills the change history with useless information.\r\n - It is a very mild form of security leak. When creating a workflow I never expected its name to be visible to customers.\r\n - it appears in email notifications when issues are moved to a project with a different workflow. Eg. here is a support notification that went to a customer:\r\n{noformat}\r\n     [ https://support.atlassian.com/browse/CSP-18798?page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:all-tabpanel ]\r\n\r\nJeff Turner moved JST-172 to CSP-18798:\r\n---------------------------------------\r\n\r\n    Customer Status: Unknown\r\n           Workflow: Support Workflow v.20  (was: Support Workflow - awaiting fix branch - v.23)\r\n                Key: CSP-18798  (was: JST-172)\r\n            Project: Confluence Support  (was: JIRA Studio Support)\r\n...\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nThe workflow change is just confusing and irrelevant to customers.\r\n\r\nSo overall, logging the workflow change is a bad idea in concept and also in practice.",
