Issue Summary\r\nA hidden, from the Backlog page, Story card with missing transition icons will be created while an error message happens due to a user's project permission.\r\n \r\n While trying to create a story issue card on Project A, trying to link an Epic from Project B, which this issue card owner has read-only permission, will generate an error message, preventing the issue owner to create this story card, since this user has not enough permissions regarding Project B.\r\n\r\n In Jira instances with thousands of users, it could cause a possible occult performance problem in long-term scenarios, in the case of many of these \"hidden\" tickets happening on daily basis activities from users interacting with issue creation.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n * Create two software projects\r\n * Using a test user which has read-only (browse) permissions in the first project\r\n * Create an issue with issue type \"Epic\" in the first project\r\n * Create an issue with issue type \"Story\" in the second project\r\n * On the creation screen (during Story creation) choose the first created Epic\r\n in field \"Epic link\" and submit \r\n * There should come an error message.\r\n * Clear the field \"Epic link\"  and submit again\r\n * Issue <projectKey>-*2* should be created\r\n * Browse directly for issue <projectKey>-*1*. The issue should be shown but without\r\ntransitions buttons\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nNo card creation while the configuration settings are not met.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nThe Story issue card is created, with missing transition buttons. It will be searchable but won't appear on the Backlog page.\r\n\r\nh3.

      "description": "Hello Jira Team.\r\n\r\nI would like to suggest a review of the method currently used to end Sprints with issues that span across multiple projects.\r\n\r\nIn recent tests, a customer showed an environment that had a Board with Sprints that had multiple issues, from different projects on it.\r\nOnce he chose to close the current sprint and move all the unfinished issues to the next sprint, only the issues in that project got moved to the next sprint, all other issues were moved to the backlog.\r\n\r\nWe understand that the issues are moved to the next sprint *only* when they respect the filter applied to the board that the customer is viewing.\r\n\r\nThat way, when changing the filter, we can move the other issues to the next sprint as expected.\r\n\r\nHowever, the message in the UI does not warn us that the issues not appearing in the current filter of the Board will be moved to the Backlog and also does not inform us that they will be moved to the backlog of their own project.\r\n\r\nThis causes an impact on the productivity of the customer since he needs to search for the issues across multiple projects and relocate them all to the next sprint.\r\n\r\nWe would like to suggest having a review on the process for this kind of sprint. It would be more efficient if all the issues in a current sprint would be moved to the next one independently of the filter used in the board.\r\n\r\nIf you require more information, please feel free to ask.\r\n\r\nBest Regards,\r\n{color:#0052cc}*Benedy Melo*{color} | *Atlassian Support*",

Summary\r\nUser Picker Dropdown takes an excessive amount of time to load when there are thousands of users in Jira and up to 49 users in the Assignable User permission.\r\n\u00a0\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# In the permission scheme that is being used, set the Assignable User permission to 49 users or less, either using groups, project roles or individual users.\r\n# With the user picker, whenever a user types a name into the field (assignee, reporter), the auto-complete list populates adequately.\r\n#* However, when a user selects the dropdown to try and assign a user, it encounters a _timeout at 1 minute_. \r\n#* When using the api call alone, it registers at 1.7 minutes to load. The exact call being used by the dropdown is:\r\n{noformat}\r\nrest/api/latest/user/assignable/search?username=&projectKeys=[REDACTED]&issueKey=[REDACTED]&maxResults=50&startAt=0&_=1559132212476\r\n{noformat}\r\nThis is not something where adjusting the timeout will suffice because in no way should the dropdown timeout and take that long to load.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\u00a0It should take less than a second to populate the list.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nIt takes over 2 minutes for the list to load and at times, it times out.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n* There's a good chance it will only take a few seconds for the list to populate by adding 50 users or more to the permission. This will only happen if Jira finds the 50th user relatively quickly. \r\n* If Jira needs to iterate through several batches to find the 50th users then it may still take a very long time. Each search batch goes through 10000 users. \r\n* Until JSWSERVER-20336 is fixed, the workaround that is guaranteed to work is not having any assignable permission and relying on the project browse permission. i.e. Anyone who's able to see an issue can be an assignee.

Issue Summary\r\n\r\nJira Data Center, Jira Core Data Center, Jira Software Data Center, and Jira Service Management Data Center exposed a Ehcache RMI network service which attackers, who can connect to the service, on port 40001 and potentially 40011 [0][1][2], could execute arbitrary code of their choice in Jira through deserialization due to a missing authentication vulnerability. While Atlassian strongly suggests restricting access to the Ehcache ports to only Data Center instances, fixed versions of Jira will now require a shared secret in order to allow access to the Ehcache service.\r\n\r\n*[0]* In Jira Data Center, Jira Core Data Center, and Jira Software Data Center versions prior to 7.13.1, the Ehcache object port can be randomly allocated.\r\n\r\n*[1]* In Jira Service Management Data Center versions prior to 3.16.1, the Ehcache object port can be randomly allocated.\r\n\r\n*[2]* The default Ehcache port is 40001 but it can be configured to be on a different port, see [Installing JIRA Data Center|https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiraserver/installing-jira-data-center-938846870.html#InstallingJiraDataCenter-parametersCluster.propertiesfileparameters]\u00a0for more details.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n*Affected versions:*\r\n The versions of Jira Data Center, Jira Core Data Center, and Jira Software Data Center affected by this vulnerability are:\r\n * From version 6.3.0 before 8.5.16 (the fixed version for 8.5.x)\r\n * From version 8.6.0 before 8.13.8 (the fixed version for 8.13.x)\r\n * From version 8.14.0 before 8.17.0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe versions of Jira Service Management Data Center affected by this vulnerability are:\r\n * From version 2.0.2 before 4.5.16 (the fixed version for 4.5.x)\r\n * From version 4.6.0 before 4.13.8 (the fixed version for 4.13.x)\r\n * From version 4.14.0 before 4.17.0\r\n\r\nh3.

Issue Summary\r\n\r\nBased on our documentation If you are a Jira Admin, you will also see the System tab, where you can change the columns for all users who have not set their own defaults:\r\n * [Configuring the default issue navigator|https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiraserver/configuring-the-default-issue-navigator-938847005.html#Configuringthedefaultissuenavigator-Mydefaults,filter,andsystem]\r\n On the other side, the following API call can set and returns the default system columns for the issue navigator:\r\n * [/rest/api/2/settings/columns|https://docs.atlassian.com/software/jira/docs/api/REST/8.13.4/#api/2/settings].\r\n\r\nThat said, we started comparing the columns we have returning the GET of the API and the System tab, and we stated that they should match between themselves, we assume. \r\n Also because this System tab is the only way that ADMINs can edit the default system columns through the UI.\r\n\r\nDuring some tests running these APIs in a custom filter, we found one way to create an inconsistency. \r\n We basically removed all the default columns using the API, so it started returning [EMPTY], in the other side, the \"System\" tab continued to show columns selected.\r\n\r\nThese are the issues faced caused by this inconsistency:\r\n * If you click on \"Restore Defaults\" button in \"Columns\", all the columns disappear;\r\n * If you go to \"System\" tab, it appears that we have Default columns selected.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nFor some reason, when we open a filter, and go to \"Columns > System\" it brings data from /rest/api/2/settings/columns?_=ID_HERE, instead of /rest/api/2/settings/columns.\r\n\r\nh4. +To reproduce the BUG:+\r\nObviously, this inconsistency can be created in different ways, because we started investigating it after an issue raised by a client. We are only showing that it's possible to be created:\r\n\r\nRun the following API to check the default system columns:\r\n{code}\r\n/rest/api/2/settings/columns {code}\r\nCompare with what you have on JQL filters > Columns > System.\r\n\r\nTo create an inconsistency: (Use an admin user)\r\n # Create a new filter;\r\n # Open it and Browser DevTools;\r\n # Go to Network tab (Clean it);\r\n # In Jira, click on Columns > System;\r\n # It should return a request URL with something like:\r\n # {code:java}\r\n/rest/api/2/settings/columns?_=ID_HERE {code}\r\n # Copy \"As fetch\";\r\n # Go to the console, paste it and change the method from \"GET\" to \"PUT\" and Run (you must have Admin Rights);\r\n # Run the following API to check the default system columns: (It should return empty \" [] \")\r\n# {code} /rest/api/2/settings/columns {code}\r\n # Compare with what you have on JQL filters > Columns > System.\r\n # You will see that the columns are still marked in System tab.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that the fields in \"Columns > System tab\" are marked based on somewhere I didn't figure out yet.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nMarked fields in Columns > System tab and the output of /rest/api/2/settings/columns API should match between themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nThe fields marked in Columns > System tab and the output of /rest/api/2/settings/columns API are not matching.\r\n\r\n\r\nh3.

      "description": "Issue: When retrieving issues via the REST API the \"epic name\" field is blank for issues that are linked to an epic issue.\u00a0 I have searched the forums/web and this seems to be a known issue. See:\r\n\r\n[https://community.atlassian.com/t5/Team-managed-projects-questions/Why-is-Epic-Name-blank-in-All-issues-view/qaq-p/1366207]\r\n\r\nI would like to add my name to the list of people who would like to see an \"Linked Epic Name\" field which contains the name of the linked epic and have it populated in the results returned from the REST API. Continuing to have the Epic ID in the Epic Link column is fine. I just need the linked Epic Name to be included when the issue has an Epic Link attached.\r\n\r\nWhen we search for issues via the Jira web interface, the system displays the epic name in the Epic Link column on the screen and the Epic Name column is blank. If I export from the issues page to Excel or XML, it matches what is displayed: epic link column contains name not the ID and epic name is blank. Exporting to CSV gives me same result and what is returned from REST API: Epic Link contains the ID, Epic Name is blank.\r\n\r\nThe proposed workaround referenced in the link above suggests using automation to populate a new custom field, and also an option to load the new field for all previously created stories. Can you tell me if this automation only executes when a new issue is created after the automation has been created? If so, what happens if the name of the linked epic story is changed after the fact? Will all linked stories also get updated?\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if there is a way or how to do this, but I would like to add my name to the list of people who would like to see an \"Linked Epic Name\" field as part of the \"standard/default\" functionality.\u00a0 This field should contain the name of the linked epic and should be populated in the results returned from the REST API. Continuing to have the Epic ID in the Epic Link column is fine. I just need the linked Epic Name to be included when the issue is linked to an epic.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\nJim",

Issue Summary\r\nWhenever WebHooks are triggered, during the process of building a JSON body to be sent, Jira will fetch data for certain fields directly at the database (e.g. fields from Advanced Roadmaps).\r\n\r\nThe implementation of this mechanic, returns Iterable of custom fields definitions + function retrieving data for them. It is then called two times separately to create two different data structures. It is not necessary, because data structures are not filtering the output, they are just retrieving custom fields' names.\r\n\r\nWhen a significant amount of WebHooks is set to be triggered on issue operations, this can increase the time Jira will take to finish executing issue actions, causing performance issues for end users.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Set up a Jira instance with Advanced Roadmaps\r\n# Populate a Jira issue with Advanced Roadmaps fields (e.g. Target start and Target end)\r\n# Create a few WebHooks set to be triggered on issue_updated events, then set them to be triggered at the affected issue\r\n# Add a comment at the affected issue\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nJira will query the database once to build the JSON from the issue to be sent through WebHooks.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nJira will query the database twice for each WebHook that was triggered, increasing the response time from Jira.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\nTBD\r\n\r\n",

Issue Summary\r\n\r\nThe validation step of the CSV issue-import process should at least warn and explain the consequences (if not error out) of having a subtask assigned to an epic in the CSV file. Currently, nothing gets raised at the validation stage. On some versions of Jira, we silently continue through the actual import without any errors (<8.10, >=8.13.7). On others, we blow up (~8.11-8.13.6).\r\nNeither of these outcomes is desirable. I want Jira to warn me at the validation stage if there are instances of subtasks being assigned to epics, and the warning should state that Jira will ignore these assignments and have the new subtasks inherit from the parent task. Then, the actual import process should do exactly that.\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nSame as in JRASERVER-71995 or JRASERVER-71880.\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nThe validator raises a warning when a subtask is assigned to the same Epic as its parent. Technically, subtasks cannot have their own epic assignments; they inherit them.\r\n\r\nWhen a subtask is assigned to a different epic than its parent, either:\r\n * A stronger warning is raised, and the user is informed that the affected subtask will not have the intended epic assignment.\r\n * an error is raised and the CSV data must be fixed before the import operation can be performed.\r\n\r\nh3.
