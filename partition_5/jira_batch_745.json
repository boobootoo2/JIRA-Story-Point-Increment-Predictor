It is often not a subtask, but a related issue - maybe a child, maybe an issue that is blocked by an issue I am looking at, or maybe simply a related issue.  It would make my workflow much smoother if I could create a linked issue in the same way I can create a subtask or assign a label - by click on the \"More\" button from within an existing issue, or clicking on the \"Actions\" down-arrow next to an issue when it appears in a list, rather than clicking on create issue, and linking to the existing issue from within the new issue.\n\nThanks,\n\nDaniel.",

      "description": "I have used the JQL function module quite a lot in my plugin, JQL Tricks. It is a really useful plugin module to extend JIRA's search capabilities and works well for most cases.\r\n\r\nBut with the growing list of enterprise customers, performance has become a great problem. After introducing many improvements to the new JQL functions, there still a bottleneck which appears to be coming from IssueIdValidator. \r\n\r\nThe problem comes when the return type is ISSUE. It is very convinient as it lets users search with clauses like \"issue in ..\" but SearchService adds a lot of load in such cases because of the extra validations. For example, if a query returns 40K issues, IssueIdValidator verifies that each of the issue id is a valid one. This extra validation is sometimes totally useless because permissions are already checked once. But there is no way to override it as pe the current architecture\r\n\r\nThis is completely unrelated to JQL Tricks or any other plugin as I reproduced the same issue with a simple plugin where I used the following query directly in issue navigator and in a simple JQL function that returns issues matching the same. The time taken to return the result using the JQL function is a lot more than the direct usage.\r\n{code}\r\nissuetype in standardIssueTypes()\r\n{code}\r\nTo make sure, I have added profile logs in the code and here is the result.\r\n{code}\r\n2013-12-10 22:08:42,375 http-8080-3 DEBUG jobinkk 1327x325x1 1ue9yju 0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1%0 /secure/IssueNavigator!executeAdvanced.jspa [atlassian.util.profiling.UtilTimerStack] [72132ms] - /secure/IssueNavigator!executeAdvanced.jspa\r\n  [33017ms] - IssueNavigator.execute()\r\n    [2513ms] - Test JQL Function\r\n      [75ms] - Lucene Query\r\n        [0ms] - IssueIndexManager.getIssueSearcher()\r\n        [15ms] - Permission Query\r\n          [9ms] - PermissionManager.getProjects()\r\n          [0ms] - List.iterator()\r\n          [0ms] - Iterator.hasNext()\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nOut of the 33017ms, the plugin code takes only 2513ms.

The problem is that it is assuming too much about what messages will be posted (this is a shared message bus, after all) and erroring out if the message looks different from what it expects.\r\n\r\nIn this case the Evernote Web Clipper is also using Window.postMessage but obviously its messages are not intended to be processed by Gadgets.\r\n\r\n!stack trace.png!\r\n\r\nThe gadgets code needs to be made robust:\r\n* check the {{packet.origin}} or something to filter out messages it does not expect, and\r\n* wrap a try/catch around the {{packet.data}} parsing.\r\n\r\nObviously this can happen for other browsers and other extensions too.",

Proposed Solution:\r\nChange the following part:\r\n{code:java| title=public Comment create(Issue issue, ApplicationUser author, ApplicationUser updateAuthor, String body, String groupLevel, Long roleLevelId, Date created, Date updated, boolean dispatchEvent, boolean tweakIssueUpdateDate)| borderStyle=dashed| borderColor=#6A8EB3 |bgColor=#F8F8F8}\r\n        if (tweakIssueUpdateDate)\r\n        {\r\n            IssueFactory issueFactory = ComponentAccessor.getComponentOfType(IssueFactory.class);\r\n            MutableIssue mutableIssue = issueFactory.getIssue(issue.getGenericValue());\r\n            //JRA-15723: Use the comments updated time for the updated time of the issue.  This allows users to\r\n            // import old comments (via Jelly for example) without setting the updated time on the issue to now, but to the date\r\n            // of the old comments.\r\n            mutableIssue.setUpdated(new Timestamp(comment.getUpdated().getTime()));\r\n            issue.store();\r\n        }\r\n{code}\r\nto \r\n{code:java| title=public Comment create(Issue issue, ApplicationUser author, ApplicationUser updateAuthor, String body, String groupLevel, Long roleLevelId, Date created, Date updated, boolean dispatchEvent, boolean tweakIssueUpdateDate)| borderStyle=dashed| borderColor=#6A8EB3 |bgColor=#F8F8F8}\r\n        if (!tweakIssueUpdateDate)\r\n        {\r\n            IssueFactory issueFactory = ComponentAccessor.getComponentOfType(IssueFactory.class);\r\n            MutableIssue mutableIssue = issueFactory.getIssue(issue.getGenericValue());\r\n            //JRA-15723: Use the comments updated time for the updated time of the issue.

When using Basic Search, the \"Status\" drop-down displays all Status values --- out-of-the-box as well as those we've added.\r\n\r\nh4. Usability Challenge\r\nAfter filtering on Issue Type, the \"Status\" drop-down still shows all Status values, many of which don't apply to the selected Issue Type.  _That is, by virtue of the associated Workflow(s), an Issue of the selected Type could never transition to certain Statuses._\r\n\r\nLet's say we define a \"Business Requirement\" Issue Type, and associate it with a new Workflow that allows Issues to have the following Status values:\r\n\r\n* In Progress\r\n* Ready for Customer Review\r\n* Customer Approved\r\n* Customer Rejected\r\n\r\nIf a user searches for \"Business Requirement\" Issues that have a Status of \"Closed\", there would be no matches.\r\n\r\nh4. Suggestion\r\nBecause criteria for Basic Search are applied with AND --- not OR --- it makes sense to use \"progressive disclosure\" in the drop-downs.  So if there are any values specified in the \"Type\" drop-down, the options available in the \"Status\" drop-down would be determined by:\r\n\r\n{code}select * from status\r\nleft join workflow on (status is defined in workflow)\r\nleft join issuetype on (issuetype is assigned to workflow){code}\r\n\r\nSimilarly, the \"Type\" drop-down options could be limited based on the value(s) selected for the \"Project\" drop-down.\r\n\r\nAlso, since this functionality might degrade response time, allow an Administrator to enable/disable it.\r\n\r\n(!) {color:red} *Devil's advocate says:*\r\nWhat happens when a user filters on two Issue Types, and then selects a Status value that applies only to the first, and _another_ Status value that applies only to the second?{color}\r\nThis scenario can be tested even without the suggested functionality.  It doesn't appear to be a problem...\r\n\r\nh4. Alternative Considerations\r\nIt occurred to me that a more appropriate approach might be for my team to create a Custom Field for \"Business Requirement Status\" instead of piggybacking onto the out-of-the-box Status field.  But given that we _are_ allowed to add our own values to the Status field, there is still a case for the suggested functionality.",

This would lead to an exponentially growing number of alternate transitions as number of post-functions (and conditions) grow. \r\n\r\nIt would be useful if we could define condition(s) for individual post-functions of a single transition. Something like:\r\n1-Run post-function A\r\n2-Run post-function B if user is in group X.\r\n3-Run post-function C if (mycustomfield = Y and user is in role Z)\r\n\r\nThere are some add-ons in the market that introduce post-functions that have conditions. But those conditions apply only to those specific post-functions. If JIRA supports conditions then all post-functions, both system and add-on, can become conditional.\r\n\r\nThe same mechanism and library for transition conditions can be used. This way any new transition condition functions introduced by an add-on could also be used for post-function conditions.\r\n\r\nI don't know the inner workings of JIRA of course but I believe this could be implemented without breaking anything else and would give much more power and flexibility to the already powerful JIRA workflow engine.",

However, we are to compare JIRA 6.1.5 and Bamboo 5.3 (both latest) we can see huge differences. Eg:\r\n* JIRA supporting only OracleJDK 1.7, Bamboo does support OpenJDK 1.7 and OracleJDK 1.6 and 1.7\r\n* JIRA only support Tomcat 7 , Bamboo does support Tomcat 5,6,7\r\n* JIRA support Postgresql 8.3, 8.4 and 9.0 , meanwhile Bamboo supporting only 8.2+ (can't be sure if this mean PostgreSQL version 8.2 and above)\r\n\r\nIf we are to add FishEye 3.2 to this equation:\r\n\r\n* FishEye support Postgresql 8.2 , 8.3 and 8.4 .\r\n\r\nEven though, some of the versions does match for the applications , it does not allow the customer to have a consistent versions of platform that they should use.
