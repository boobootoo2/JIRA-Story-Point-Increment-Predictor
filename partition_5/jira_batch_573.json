This\u00a0solved https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-69446. The ProjectRoleActorsZduSafeCache class has been introduced to make it work when Jira is in a mixed mode, during the ZDU.\u00a0Unfortunately it caused some problems with cache replication between the old and new cache and in some cases unnecessary cache invalidations.\r\nh3. Proposed way of testing if the Jira upgrade will solve the problem\r\n\r\nThe problem should be present only when there are a lot of project role actors modifications. The client could setup Jira 8.11.1 and trigger a lot of such operations (e.g. by some automation), upgrade, e.g. to 8.13, do the test again and see if the problem persists.",

If the tab order does not correspond to the visual representation and the logical processing order, it is difficult for the user to work efficiently.

In this context, the following problems were identified:\r\n\r\nOn many pages, content is not reached in the visual and logical order. Orientation and navigation are made more difficult for users with limited mobility. For blind users, it is more difficult to assign interactive elements to the content.

However, screen readers cannot correctly output the labels of form elements for the following reasons:\r\n \u25aa Two elements in the preview area of \u200b\u200bthe Active Sprint are not linked to the visual labeling. Screen reader users must determine the function of the elements from the context (see figure).\r\n \u25aa Further examples of form fields whose labels are not output are rich text editors (see illustration).\r\n \u25aa Search fields are not labeled and are output by the screen reader without labeling. This makes it difficult for blind users to recognize the function of these elements. All types of search fields are affected, for example the search field in the backlog (see Figure 2-32) and the issues (see Issues> Search for Issues, not shown).\r\n \u25aa Under \"Components\" the search field is labeled with a placeholder text (see illustration). However, this is not meaningful, and a placeholder labeling of an element is defined as insufficient by the W3C per specification.\r\n \u25aa In the \"Log Work\" pop-up (accessed via the \"+\" icon in the \"Time Tracking\" area of \u200b\u200ban issue), some elements are not correctly labeled, e.g. the input fields for the radio button options \u201cSet to\u201d and \u201cReduce by\u201d (see figure). To make matters worse, there is no labeling for the two radio buttons (despite correct linkage in the source code). One possible cause is that the dynamic change from non-editable to editable text fields when selecting the radio buttons is superimposed on the screen reader output.\r\n\r\n\u25aa Under User Profile > Accessibility, the reference links are titled \"Show me\" and do not describe the pages they are linking to.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n In the preview view, the fields are not linked to the labels (see illustration).\r\n \u00a0The text entry field in the editor is not linked to its \u201cDescription\u201d label, see next figure.\r\n Various search fields in different areas are without lettering.\r\n\r\n*Diagnosis*\r\n\r\nReview the guidelines for link titles:\r\n * [https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/navigation-mechanisms-refs.html]\r\n\r\nThere are various places in Jira where the link text does not follow these guidelines.\u00a0 This is important for visually impaired users using screen readers.",

This migration task moves data from {{audit_log}}, {{audit_item}} and {{audit_changed_value}} to the new table {{AO_C77861_AUDIT_ENTITY}}\r\nh4. Why this property is useful\r\n\r\nThe property should restrict the amount of entries that are migrated to the Advanced Audit Log system.\r\n\r\nThe migration task should not block the usage of Jira, however there are reports that the task is blocking the usage of Jira for non-ZDU deployment in JRASERVER-71075\r\n\r\nThis feature could be a valuable asset for customer with large audit log row count to minimise time taken to upgrade.\r\nh3.

Some problems arise in connection with access keys:{color}\r\n{color:#172b4d} \u25aa The application has its own system for keyboard operation (see figure). Access keys are called up without a control key, which causes the problem for blind users that not all access keys can be activated immediately because the screen reader does not pass the activated keys on to the browser, but uses them for its own control. Screen reader users must instruct the screen reader to allow certain commands through. This is done again using a key combination. For the JAWS screen reader, this is the key combination INSERT + 3. This means that two key combinations must be activated in order to trigger an action.

      "description": "Hi,\r\n\r\nToday we upgraded our staging Jira server from 7.13 to 8.5 as a precursor practice for the upcoming upgrading on production server next month.\r\n\r\nEverything went on smoothly, except that the upgrade package atlassian-jira-software-8.5.8-x64.bin shows the avatar file names during the process, which is a nuisance.\r\n\r\n# We cloned everything from the production system to this staging system a couple months ago so that we could do the stress test. Understandably, this system now has a huge lot of accounts / avatars, just like the production system has.\r\n# A huge portion of our engineers using the system are Chinese and Japanese. So most of them tend to name their avatar filenames using Chinese / Japanese characters.\r\n# Our Jira server is hosted on AWS EC2 node which runs CentOS. We use PuTTY to log on it and do the maintenance, upgrading included.\r\n# Clearly the Linux TTY console knows nothing about Chinese / Japanese characters. So those characters are just misinterpreted as control characters.\r\n\r\nSo when the upgrade package was doing its thing and showing those supposedly avatar file names, all strange gibberish popped up everywhere in the terminal and the cursor was moving to all directions like it was possessed. Though it might be entertaining (which it really was), what bothered us the most is that we could hardly know it actually stopped and asked us whether we wish to start Jira or exit (the last stage of upgrading) because the message was embedded in the middle of a screen full of \"funny\" characters.\r\n\r\nAlso, I can understand the need to show the Jira bundled files such as those JAR files, etc, so that if anything goes wrong we could see where it stops. But showing avatar file names really doesn't help much (they are provided by the users anyway, and they are plain data in a sense). I would suggest future Jira upgrade package should instead show a percentage of the portion of total avatar files being processed, not showing each one of their names.\r\n\r\nThank you for reading thus far. Hope you guys can consider this enhancement on future upgrade package. Hope you and your family are doing well!\r\n\r\nBest Regards\r\nTony Chu\r\nTrendMicro TW HQ",

Steps to Reproduce\r\n * Created a checkbox custom field with below options:\r\n ** AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA1\r\n ** AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA2\r\n ** ...\r\n ** AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA9\r\n ** AAAAAAAAAAAAAA10\r\n * Associate it with screens\r\n * Created a ticket with checked options: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA1 ~ AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA6\r\n * In ticket view, click pencil\u00a0in the checkbox to edit the checkbox options.\r\n * Change nothing , click \u00d7 (or the area besides edit area), back from edit view.\r\n * A view more count for folded options will be shown, for example it is 4.\r\n * In ticket view, click pencil(to edit)\u00a0again, change nothing , click \u00d7 (or the area besides edit area), back from edit view.\r\n * The view more count for folded options will change to 5(plus 1).\r\n * If doing _edit > change nothing > back_\u00a0for the checkbox repeatedly, the view more count will keep increase.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nThe view more count keeps same every time back from edit view, since there is no change.\u00a0\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nThe view more count will keep increase.\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nNo Workaround, but no harm except the showing number is not correct.",
