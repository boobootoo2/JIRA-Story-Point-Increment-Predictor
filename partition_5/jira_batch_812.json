The InternalFieldComparator method is responsible for extracting Lucene field values from documents and storing them in slots (method copy) and for doing comparisions on the values stored in the slots (compare, compareBottom)\r\n\r\n*Current Implementation*: The constructor of InternalFieldComparator creates an array that has the maximal needed size (parameter numHits). \r\n{code}\r\nvalues = new Object[numHits];\r\n{code}\r\nIf numHits is relatively small number, this is okay. However, if the maximum hit count is unlimited (Integer.MAX_VALUE),  the caller passes the total number of Lucene index documents to numHits. In our case this is around 700.000. So in this case 700.000 x 8 Byte = 5.3 MB are allocated even if the actual hit count number is far less (e.g. 20). \r\n\r\n*One Alternative Implementation*: Use a Vector instead of an array. The vector capacity can grow dynamically. In most cases the searches on Lucene return a limited number of hits (< 4000). The need of the vector capacity to grow is therefore limited.\u000b\r\n{code}\r\nprivate final Vector<Object> values;\u000bInternalFieldComparator2(int numHits, String fieldP, final LuceneFieldSorter sorter)\u000b{\u000b  values = new Vector<Object>();\u000b  ...\u000b}\u000bpublic void copy(int slot, int doc)\r\n{\r\n  if (slot >= values.size()) \r\n  {\u000b    values.setSize(slot + 1);        \r\n  }\u000b  ...\r\n}\r\n{code}\r\n",

It looks as though the Flowdock for JIRA plugin is doing some very expensive PropertySet creation in an IssueEventListener. This might not have been picked up on in regular JIRA usage, as most of the time IssueEvents are fired for only a single issue (create, update, etc). However GreenHopper updates multiple issues at a single time in a loop, and the slowdown caused by this extra code is very noticeable.\r\n\r\nOnDemand instances bundle the Flowdock for JIRA plugin by default. Thus this could be a big problem for a lot of customers. Note that I tried to disable the plugin to see if the problem went away, but it still persisted.\r\n\r\nHere is the thread profile from New Relic:\r\n\r\n{noformat}\r\n    100.0%  - java.lang.Thread.run\r\n        152 Collapsed methods (show)\r\n            97.0%  -

[See the corresponding bug report|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-27971].\n  {panel}\n\nWhilst working on JRADEV-10913 I encountered a bug which I could reproduce only in IE9 (didn't try IE8 yet).\n\nAttached is a dataset which is based on JIRA5.0_QAData.zip in which I created a simple qa-like workflow to help me reproduce the the bug in JRADEV-10913. This, and my lack of experience in setting up workflows, screens, etc, may well be the cause of the issue. However this sort of error should preferably not occur due to user error.\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n\nIn IE9: \n- Restore attached data\n- Create an issue in the QA project\n- Transition the newly created issue to \"In Progress\" by clicking Workflow -> Start Progress\n- Click \"QA Time\"\n- Enter a tester name and submit the form.\n-- Please note that sometimes the transition buttons under the Ops Bar do not update. If this occurs then it's certain that there's going to be an SQL error. In this case click Workflows -> Back to In Development\n- If no error occurs transition \"Back to Development\"\n- Repeat the above steps alternating tester value from admin to fred and back until an SQL error is displayed as follows:\n\n{quote}\nCould not move to history step for #12694: root cause: while inserting: [GenericEntity:OSHistoryStep][id,13052][caller,admin][startDate,2012-04-17 16:19:08.781][status,Not Done][owner,][finishDate,2012-04-17 16:19:32.143][actionId,791][stepId,3][dueDate,null][entryId,12694] (SQL Exception while executing the following:INSERT INTO PUBLIC.OS_HISTORYSTEP (ID, ENTRY_ID, STEP_ID, ACTION_ID, OWNER, START_DATE, DUE_DATE, FINISH_DATE, STATUS, CALLER) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?)

Set system fields through named methods like setPriority() -- not convenient for this task, and does not allow to change custom fields.\n2. Set custom field value by passing \"String[]\" argument -- not sufficient because I can't extract the correct String[] from an issue.\n3. Set action input parameters as if they were passed from the form -- ditto, I can't get those parameters from Issue\n4. Use setFieldValuesHolder() to provide a map that will be copied during creation operation -- unfortunately, it's of no use, since values stored there are ignored and overridden by the defaults or taken from the action parameters map.\n\nIf there was a way to get the correct \"action parameters\" String[] for a custom field value of a given Issue, that would solve the problem at the minimum level.

[See the corresponding bug report|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-27898].\n  {panel}\n\nTrying to @mention people on JAC is so slow that its kinda pointless.\r\n\r\nProblem number 1 is that it takes 5 seconds to do a  look up at the moment\r\n\r\nProblem number 2 is one of UX.  There is no easy way to see that a request is happening and hence you keep typing and hence it cancels the request and hence you get no results so you remove some of the typing thinking it doesnt work and then there are still no results and... you get the picture.\r\n\r\nIts basically makes you think that nothing is going to happen.  We need to tighten the UX up so that you can \"know\" that a request is in flight after a longish time (say 2 seconds)\r\n\r\n",

If the Component is allowed in the Field configuration, but, not part of any screen configuration (so not editable), then the issue doesn't occur...\r\n\r\nIt also seem that if I activate the Field Component in the field section, then *existing* issue will not be fixed immediately by this ADMIN change, instead, If I go to Screen, add the field to the edit screen, go to the existing issue, edit the component, set it to something, edit it again, set it to null (no component), then the problem is gone and I can load again the Issues tab.\r\n\r\n\r\nI haven't tried JIRA 5.0.2, so maybe this is fixed in this release, I've tried search the Atlassian JIRA for similar issue but failed to find it (sorry if I missed it).\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nJohan.\r\n",
