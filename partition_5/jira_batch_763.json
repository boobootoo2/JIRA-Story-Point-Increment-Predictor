      "description": "Since time immemorial, the standard behaviour of Atlassian's user management subsystems has been to use {{null}} to represent an anonymous user context.\r\n\r\nThis has been codified in the SAL interface javadoc for the {{com.atlassian.sal.api.user.UserManager}} interface. For example, the textual contract for the #getRemoteUser() method states:\r\n\r\n{code:lang=java}\r\n/**\r\n * Returns the profile of the currently logged in user or null if no user can be found.\r\n * <p/>\r\n * Getting the full {@link UserProfile} may have performance implications in some applications. Consider using {@link #getRemoteUserKey()} if you don't need the full object.\r\n *\r\n * @return the {@link UserProfile} of the logged in user or null\r\n * @see #getRemoteUserKey()\r\n * @since 2.10\r\n */\r\n@Nullable\r\nUserProfile getRemoteUser();\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nThe SAL UserManager API and the underlying JIRA implementation of UserManager were changed in JIRA 6.0 to support renaming users. This change has *broken* the textual contract of the #getRemoteUser() method in JIRA, which *no longer returns {{null}} for anonymous users*.\r\n\r\nThis appears to simply be an oversight in the JIRA implementation:\r\n\r\n{code:lang=java}\r\n@Override\r\npublic UserProfile getRemoteUser()\r\n{\r\n    return new JiraUserProfile(jiraAuthenticationContext.getUser());\r\n}\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nThis method should return {{null}} if the value returned from {{jiraAuthenticationContext.getUser()}} also returns {{null}}.\r\n\r\nThis subtle change in behaviour can end up with add-on developers getting a  stack-trace like this:\r\n\r\n{noformat}\r\njava.lang.NullPointerException\r\n\tat com.atlassian.sal.jira.user.DefaultUserManager$JiraUserProfile.getUsername(DefaultUserManager.java:253)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.jira.examples.ExampleServlet.doGet(ExampleServlet.java:78)\r\n\tat javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet.service(HttpServlet.java:621)\r\n\tat javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet.service(HttpServlet.java:728)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.plugin.servlet.DelegatingPluginServlet.service(DelegatingPluginServlet.java:42)\r\n\tat javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet.service(HttpServlet.java:728)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.plugin.servlet.ServletModuleContainerServlet.service(ServletModuleContainerServlet.java:52)\r\n\tat javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet.service(HttpServlet.java:728)\r\n...\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nThis change may cause unexpected side effects in Atlassian-authored and third-party JIRA add-ons and should be corrected ASAP.  This bug would only be detected through explicit testing, since this change is not mentioned in the [Preparing for JIRA 6.0|https://developer.atlassian.com/display/JIRADEV/Preparing+for+JIRA+6.0] guide or the [Renamable Users in JIRA 6.0|https://developer.atlassian.com/display/JIRADEV/Renamable+Users+in+JIRA+6.0] guide.\r\n",

Since the collector already tracks who is logged in and user profiles contain email addresses most of the data needed is already in the system.  I realize this would not work for non-account holders.  The hard part would be creating a place in the collector UI where you could use HTML to customize your reply email for each collector.\r\n\r\nThis is auto-reply feature has also been requested for JIRA in the following tickets. I'm just extending the idea a bit.\r\n* JRA-12650\r\n* JRA-21959\r\n\r\nThanks for the consideration. You are all doing great work!",

However, for some reason, clicking next after expanding possible issue types does not cause the error message.\r\n* Func Tests do not assert on that, since they use the underlying <select/> to perform changes, which is the essence of the bug - the options are not in there.\r\n* Manifests on Master, does not manifest on JDOG...",

That's a lot :).  As far as I can tell that's simply done to invalidate cache entries in the CachingFieldConfigContextPersister.  This is where I ran out of time to investigate further but given the customer data and information above should be enough for someone on bugfix to reproduce.  There's probably more efficient ways we could be clearing cache entries (using map.remove(key) rather than iterating with a predicate perhaps).",

When typing the entire name and changing focus though, an error appears. There are two distinct cases:\r\n\r\n1. Displaying an Issue on the screen makes Component field editable (pen icon allows editing). When user begins to type, auto-complete is active, the \"option\" appears clearly. Entire option is edited; enter or ok issues the error (see ManualEditComponent.jpg image).\r\n\r\n2. Creating a new Issue and editing Component field is somewhat similar, but only if focus is switched from the Component field after entirely typing to another field with mouse selection; then error appears; if focus to another field is done by pressing TAB, everything seems to work fine (see CreateIssueComponent.jpg image).\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks for resolving this,\r\nRoxana",

However, currently JIRA will required a minimum screen resolution of *1024 x 768* in order to fully utilize JIRA. \r\n\r\nh3. Customer Personal Feedback\r\n{quote}\r\nOne thing to pass on to Atlassian is that the \u201cWhat\u2019s new\u201d pop-up is not great for people using a low screen resolution. The trouble is the pop up can\u2019t be scrolled and so the only option is to zoom out (meaning I can no longer read the information contained in the pop-up). Here is how it appears on my screen:\r\n!Accessibility 01.png|thumbnail!\r\nThis is spread over two 800x600 resolution screens.\r\n\r\nSecondly trying the menus I get:\r\n!Accessibility 02.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nIt seems that it is being rendered ridiculously short with respect to the available screen height. Atlassian probably need to look at the routine used to assess this. Please do praise them for the ability to now use the scroll wheel on this menu again it is usable! Just tricky to get context form as many menu items as possible (even if you have to scroll for the final few).\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve not got much time at the moment for an extensive test but hope that these initial observations will be useful. I\u2019d be grateful if you could let me know what happens about these things as it will make Jira more difficult to use.\r\n{quote}",

Specifically this is because the multi-select fields \"Affects Version\", \"Fix Version\" and \"Components\" are rendered incorrectly [^JIRA IE8 Create Issue Stage 2.PNG].  They are also non-editable, ie. pressing TAB skips over these fields.  It's also worth noting that instead of displaying the dynamically loading Create Issue popup, an in-line Create Issue screen is displayed with two stages - first you select project and issue type, then click Next to load the full Create Issue page [^JIRA IE8 Create Issue Stage 1.PNG].\r\n\r\nThis problem is not evident on IE9 or IE10 with the same group policy, nor in Chrome or Firefox.\r\n\r\nWhy This Is A Regression:  This problem is not evident on JIRA 5.2 under the exact same environment.\r\n\r\nSpeculative Cause: The ActiveX fallback on IE8 which takes effect when native XMLHTTP is disabled does not appear to be working any more for IE8.  Note that it still works for the IE9 and IE10 browsers.\r\n\r\nThe following matrix indicates the regression:\r\n\r\n| Browser | JIRA 5.2.10 | JIRA 6.0.2 |\r\n| IE8 | OK | {color:red} NOT OK {color} |\r\n| IE9 | OK | OK |\r\n| IE10 | OK | OK |\r\n| Chrome | OK | OK |\r\n| Firefox | OK | OK |\r\n\r\n",

Not only is this quite a detour, it also makes no sense because the project lead and default assignee are *not* project roles.\r\n\r\nLet's start in a sensible place, the global project admin:\r\n\r\n!ProjectLead_01_ProjectAdmin.png!\r\n\r\nYou can see it, but you can't edit it.  Well there's an Edit button, so maybe there...\r\n\r\n!ProjectLead_02_EditProject.png!\r\n\r\nNope.  The field isn't there (and worse still, if there's something wrong with the current value, like the user was deleted by LDAP, then the edit dialog redisplays and the error isn't visible, since it is attached to a field that isn't there.  See JRA-33843, for example).  Well maybe if you view the project itself...\r\n\r\n!ProjectLead_03_ProjectOverview.png!\r\n\r\nNope, still no way to edit it.  Well this is the overview, not the administration view, so maybe that's it....\r\n\r\n!ProjectLead_04_Admin.png!\r\n\r\nNope.  I can see it in two places, and neither one lets me edit it.  To get to where I can change it I have to go into \"Roles: View Project Roles\" link, at which point I get:\r\n\r\n!ProjectLead_05_ProjectRoles.png!\r\n\r\nAnd can *finally* edit them.",
