We fully intend to support MS SQL Server 2014 in the near future and will inform everyone on this ticket once support has commenced. \r\n\r\nh5. When can I expect it?\r\nSupport for MS SQL Server 2014 will occur in the next *_minor release_* of JIRA, granted there are no unforeseen events that prevent this support. If this does occur, I will relay any information back to this ticket to keep you all informed as best I can. The next minor release for JIRA is set for *Q1 2016*. \r\n\r\nh5. I can't wait that long, what should I do?\r\nIf you or your organisation cannot wait until Q1 2016 for MS SQL Server 2014, I recommend updating to MS SQL Server 2012 in the interim. We will be ending support for MS SQL Server 2005 in the next major release, JIRA 7.0, and it is recommended you do not stay on this version of MS SQL Server when it comes time to upgrade. \r\n\r\nh5. I have more questions\r\nPlease feel free to email me or comment on this issue and I'll do my best to get back to you as soon as I can.\r\n\r\nThank you for your understanding and patience. :) \r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nKerrod Williams\r\nJIRA Product Management\r\nkewilliams at atlassian dot com  \r\n{panel}\r\n\r\n///\r\n\r\nh3. Summary\r\nMicrosoft SQL Server 2014 is not certified/supported for use with recent versions of JIRA. JIRA Administrators should able to migrate onto recent versions of Microsoft SQL Server in order to maintain compliance with internal policies within SOE's. \r\n\r\nh3.

Safari occasionally decides to be helpful and pop up alternative spellings for words it thinks you've mis-typed, and you can hit ESCAPE to get rid of the suggestion popup.  The problem is that ESCAPE also triggers JIRA into throwing away your entire edit, with no ability to undo this action.  This isn't the first time I've lost work in this way, and judging by other bug reports I've found for other parts of JIRA I'm not alone in this.  So PLEASE remove the ESCAPE-is-cancel feature from the text entry box, or add an \"are you sure\" pop-up, or add an \"undo cancel\" feature, but please don't kick this into the long grass by saying \"works as designed\" - it's the design that's at fault!

Summary\r\nBasic search is unavailable when performing simple JQL searches involving users who have been renamed in the past.  This effects both searching from a saved filter or from a gadget on a dashboard which may have previously worked. \r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Create a user with any username\r\n# Browse to the issue navigator and search for this user either in the \"reporter\" or \"assignee\" field\r\n# You will be able to search either in Basic or Advanced mode\r\n# Now rename this user with any value (adding an extra letter will work)\r\n# Browse back to the issue navigator and, in Advanced mode, search for the user either in the \"reporter\" or \"assignee\" field\r\n# The \"Basic\" search will be disabled\r\n# If you hover over the \"Basic\" link, the message \"This query is too complex to display in Simple mode\" will be shown\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nYou should be able to switch between Basic and Advanced mode\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nThe Basic search is disabled and if you hover over the \"Basic\" link, the message \"This query is too complex to display in Simple mode\" will be shown\r\n \r\nh3. Notes\r\nIf you are unsure whether a username has changed run the following SQL:\r\n{code}select * from app_user where lower_user_name='<username>'{code}\r\nand it will return the current and previous username\r\n\r\nh3.Workaround\r\nRename the user back to the original username, or use advanced search instead\r\n",

The JIRA installer ships with a JRE lacking tools.jar.  This means users who using the installer encounter runtime exceptions if addons used JAXB and didn't _add_ their own implementation jar.\r\n\r\n- https://thepluginpeople.atlassian.net/browse/JEMH-2544\r\n\r\nBamboo had the same thing: https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/BAM-12484\r\n\r\nIt would be 'useful' if the JRE bundled with the JIRA installer had the referred JAXB impl jar.\r\n\r\nI've added this into my addon, however, users upgrading are in a catch22, as it breaks startup _before_ they can upgrade.\r\n\r\n",
