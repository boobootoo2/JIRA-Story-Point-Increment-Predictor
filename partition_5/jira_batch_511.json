Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Go to the project and set English as the default language support and add Danish/Portuguese/German/Spanish as a language visible to customer.\r\n # Go to Jira settings and set system language to Danish/Portuguese/German/Spanish.\r\n # Go to the browser settings and change browser language setting to French or any other language other than English.\r\n # Make sure to clear browser cache and cookies,\r\n # Open Incognito browsing mode and go to the portal.\r\n\r\nh3.

[See the corresponding bug report|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSDSERVER-4272].\r\n{panel}\r\nh3. Summary\r\n\r\nWhen attempting to migrate from JIRA Server 7.2.X running JIRA Service Desk 3.2.X, the import process fails displaying an error that indicates JIRA Service Desk should first be upgraded before being imported into Cloud.\r\nh3. Environment\r\n\r\nJIRA Cloud - v1000.319.1\r\nJIRA Service Desk - v3.3.0-OD-1000.335.0\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Ensure your JIRA Server install is running JIRA 7.2.0 or later\r\n # Ensure you have installed JIRA Service Desk 3.2.0 or later from the Atlassian Marketplace\r\n # Run a full export of your JIRA Server install\r\n # Attempt to import this into JIRA Cloud\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nThe External System Import process should complete without error\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nThe External System Import process fails and displays the following error:\r\n{noformat}\r\n\"We can't complete your upgrade. It looks like the data you are trying to import is from an earlier version of JIRA Service Desk. You need to upgrade to JIRA Service Desk 3.0 first, then export new data and try again. Read these upgrade notes for instructions: http://confluence.atlassian.com/migration/jira-7/server_jira+jsd_upgrade\"\r\n\r\n{noformat}\r\nh3. Notes\r\n\r\n!importfailure.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nSearching in the entities.xml file, you will see that the version of Service Desk running has not been completely upgraded:\r\n{noformat}\r\ncom.atlassian.activeobjects.admin.ActiveObjectsPluginToTablesMapping : {\"AO_54307E_VIEWPORTFIELDVALUE\":{\"key\":\"com.atlassian.servicedesk\",\"name\":\"JIRA Service Desk\",\"version\":\"2.3.6\",\"vendorName\":\"Atlassian\",\"vendorUrl\":\"http://www.atlassian.com\"},\"AO_54307E_QUEUECOLUMN\":{\"key\":\"com.atlassian.servicedesk\",\"name\":\"JIRA Service Desk\",\"version\":\"2.3.6\",\"vendorName\":\"Atlassian\",\"vendorUrl\":\"http://www.atlassian.com\"}\r\n\r\n{noformat}\r\nThis is caused by the customer most likely installed at some point the JIRA Service Desk plugin jar (even though it was not licensed) OR [Skipping major versions |https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/AdminJIRAServer070/Skipping+major+versions+when+upgrading+JIRA+applicationsl]\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nThe JIRA Server install must be downgraded in order to resolve this issue\r\n # Setup a temporary install of JIRA Server 7.1.9 and [connect to a new database |https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/AdminJIRAServer071/Connecting+JIRA+applications+to+a+database]\r\n # Create an XML backup of JIRA Server\r\n ** import this backup into the 7.1.9 Server.\r\n ** When running the import, JIRA will confirm that you want to downgrade your data\r\n # Once your JIRA 7.1.9 Server is running with your 7.2 data you can proceed to install JIRA Service Desk 3.1.9 [https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.atlassian.servicedesk.application/versions]]\r\n ** Make sure a license is added. You can generate an evaluation license by going to my.atlassian.com.\r\n ** To apply this license, you will want to go here: JIRA Administration > Applications > Versions & Licenses\r\n # Once the installation is complete and you have added the license, refresh the Versions & Licenses page\r\n ** Confirm that you see the Service Desk options on the left side. This will confirm that Service Desk loaded.\r\n # Create an XML backup of your JIRA 7.1.9 Server\r\n # Import this backup into your JIRA Cloud instance\r\n\r\nh3. *New workaround*:\r\n\r\nRemoving the Service Desk Upgrade History entries of type *6* from the entities.xml file allow the import to go through as well.\r\nThe entries are like the ones below:\r\n{noformat}\r\n <OSPropertyEntry id=\"22441\" entityName=\"com.atlassian.servicedesk:Upgrade.History\" entityId=\"1\" propertyKey=\"2015-06-09T01:05:46.639+02:00\" type=\"6\"/>\r\n <OSPropertyEntry id=\"22442\" entityName=\"com.atlassian.servicedesk:Upgrade.History\" entityId=\"2\" propertyKey=\"2015-06-09T01:05:48.545+02:00\" type=\"6\"/>\r\n [...]\r\n{noformat}\r\nWe can then remove these entries running the following command:\r\n{code:java}\r\nsed -i '/<OSPropertyEntry.*com.atlassian.servicedesk.*type=\"6\"/d' entities.xml\r\n{code}\r\nAfter that, just zip the files back and run the import.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf Jira Service Desk was in the evaluation years ago and you're good to lose all data on JSD, you could also apply the steps here:\r\n* [Import to Jira Cloud failed due to unable to complete the upgrade on Jira Service Desk|https://confluence.atlassian.com/cloudkb/import-to-jira-cloud-failed-due-to-unable-to-complete-the-upgrade-on-jira-service-desk-967891526.html]\r\n\r\nh4. Note:\r\nIf you're using Mac and encounter the following error when running the command:\r\n{code}\r\nerror sed: 1: \u201centities.xml\u201d: invalid command code e\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nThis is because {{-i}} flag has a mandatory suffix, as described [here|https://markhneedham.com/blog/2011/01/14/sed-sed-1-invalid-command-code-r-on-mac-os-x/]. Whereas, the suffix is optional on Ubuntu. So, please use this command for the workaround:\r\n{code}\r\nsed -i \"\" '/<OSPropertyEntry.*com.atlassian.servicedesk.*type=\"6\"/d' entities.xml\r\n{code}",

[See the corresponding suggestion|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSDSERVER-6219].\r\n  {panel}\r\nh3. Problem Definition\r\n\r\nCurrently, it is not possible to blacklist specific email addresses in a Service Desk project to prevent specific emails addresses from being sent customer notifications.\r\n\r\nIt can be a problem when Service Desk issues are created automatically by email by a monitoring system, and then the monitoring system gets spammed with notifications coming from the Service Desk issue.\r\n\r\nDisabling all the customer notifications within the project is one way to workaround the situation, but it does not apply in the case where we want to add participants to these Service Desk issues and we want them to receive notifications (but not the monitoring system).\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nAllow allows to blacklist specific email addresses for outgoing mail:\r\n- either for the whole JIRA instance via the page \u2699 > System > Outgoing Mail\r\n- or for a specific Service Desk \r\n",
