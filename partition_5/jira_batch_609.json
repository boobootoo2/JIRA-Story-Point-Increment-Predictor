Problem Definition\r\n\r\nWhen JIRA is configured with an LDAP directory with \"nested groups\" enabled, the following message is displayed in the UI when trying to Edit Nested Group Members:\r\n{quote}\r\nNesting of groups with 'JIRA Administrators' or 'JIRA System Administrators' permission is not supported.\r\n{quote}\r\n !Admin_Group_Page.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\nThis message is a bit misleading considering that:\r\n# it *is not possible* to add a group as a member of a group which has JIRA Admin or JIRA System Admin permission, via the JIRA UI (expected behavior)\r\n# it *is possible* to do it via the LDAP directory and by syncing JIRA with it (not expected behavior)\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to reproduce the 2 scenarios listed above\r\n\r\n*Scenario 1 (expected behavior)*\r\n\r\n- Connect JIRA to an LDAP directory configured with nested groups enabled (this configuration will make the button \"Edit Nested Group Members\" visible from \u2699 > User Management > Groups)\r\n- Create a group called *jira-admin* in JIRA via \u2699 > User Management > Groups\r\n- Go to \u2699 > System > Global Permission and grant this group the JIRA System Admin permission\r\n- Go to \u2699 > User Management > Groups > Edit Nested Group Members\r\n- Notice that this group is not part of the list of groups to which nested groups can be added, since this group has the JIRA System Admin permission \r\n\r\n*Scenario 2 (unexpected behavior)*\r\n\r\n- Connect JIRA to an LDAP directory configured with nested groups enabled (this configuration will make the button \"Edit Nested Group Members\" visible from \u2699 > User Management > Groups)\r\n- Create a group called *jira-admin* in the LDAP directory\r\n- Create a group called *group-nested-under-admin* in the LDAP directory, and configured it as a member of the group *jira-admin* via LDAP\r\n- Create a user in LDAP that is a member of *group-nested-under-admin*\r\n- Sync JIRA with the LDAP directory\r\n- Notice that the user ends up being both a member of group-nested-under-admin AND jira-admin (and therefore is granted the Jira System Administrators permission)\r\n !Admin_Users_Page.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nIt would be a good idea to:\r\n- either mention clarify this behavior in our official documentation about [nested groups|https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiraserver073/managing-nested-groups-861253195.html], since there is no explanation in the documentation about the statement \"Nesting of groups with 'JIRA Administrators' or 'JIRA System Administrators' permission is not supported.\" that is displayed in the JIRA UI\r\n- or make the behavior consistent in both scenarios, to avoid any confusion\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

This implementation has some drawbacks that can be addressed if the exports are actually stored in the Jira server's filesystem, rather than streamed to the client.\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nChange the implementation, or offer an option to allow the administrators to configure, for Issue Exports to be saved to the local server's filesystem, rather than being streamed to the client. This is similar to how Support ZIPs are saved to the filesystem, and a download link is offered to the client.\r\n\r\nPossibly even allow for a *Notify me when done* functionality, to send the download link directly to the requesting user via email.\r\n\r\nh3. Why this is important\r\n \r\nThis implementation offers the following benefits:\r\n* Administrators would have access to the export anytime for diagnosis purposes\r\n* Subsequent downloads would be possible instead of having to generate an export again if another copy of the same export was desired. \r\n\r\nIt could have possible drawbacks, which would be the responsibility of the administrators, or perhaps a scheduled cleanup job to handle:\r\n* A large instance with many users requesting exports may quickly fill up the filesystem",

However, I have looked at the memory of the JAVA and found that almost memory is used. Is this the cause of the issue? If so, please suggest how to increase the memory of the Java by providing the step to configure. Also, do we need to shut-down for configure? !Performance.jpg!\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nSecondly, we would like to change the date format of the ticket.

Summary\r\n\r\nIf a group is available in both the JIRA internal directory and an external directory and was created in each directory with mixed cases, the following error will be shown in the UI when trying to remove a user from this group:\r\n{code:java}\r\nCannot remove user 'admin' from group 'jira-users-test' since user is not a member of 'jira-users-test'\r\n{code}\r\nh3. Steps to reproduce\r\n # Log in JIRA as a system admin user\r\n # Create a group called *JIRA-users-test* in the JIRA internal directory (from \u2699 > User Management > Groups)\r\n # Create a user called *admin* in the JIRA internal directory (from \u2699 > User Management > Users)\r\n # Add the *admin* user to the *JIRA-users-test* group (from \u2699 > User Management > Users)\r\n # Create an Apache LDAP directory add to this directory a user called *john* and a group called *jira-users-test* (make sure that the name of the group is in all lower case)\r\n # Add the user john to the *jira-users-test* group within the LDAP\r\n # Connect JIRA to this LDAP directory with read/write permission and sync with the directory (from \u2699 > User Management > Directories)\r\n # Go to the page \u2699 > User Management > Users and look for the 2 users admin and john. Note that the 2 groups *JIRA-users-test* and *jira-users-test* these users belong to are displayed with different cases:\r\n !Local_UsersWithSameGroup.png|thumbnail!\r\n # Go to \u2699 > User Management > Groups and note that there is only 1 version of the jira-users-test group, which is *jira-users-test* (the lower-cased version of the 2 groups):\r\n !Local_Only1Group.png|thumbnail!\r\n # Click on \"Edit Member\" next to the jira-users-test group, and try to remove the user 'admin'\r\n # Go back to \u2699 > User Management > Users, look for the user *admin*, and try to remove the *JIRA-users-test* group from this user\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n - In Step 9, the *admin* user should be removed from the group *jira-users-test*\r\n - In Step 10, the group *JIRA-users-test* should be removed from the user *admin*\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n - In step 9, we get the following error:\r\n{code:java}\r\nCannot remove user 'admin' from group 'jira-users-test' since user is not a member of 'jira-users-test'\r\n{code}\r\n!Local_CantRemoveUserFromGroup.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\n - In step 10, we get the following error:\r\n{code:java}\r\nYou can not remove a group from this user as it is not visible to you\r\n{code}\r\n!Local_CantRemoveGroupFromUser.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\n*Note that on the other hand, JIRA allows me to remove the user *john* from the group 'jira-users-test'*\r\nh3. Troubleshooting\r\n\r\nTo confirm that you are indeed facing this bug, you can look into the _cwd_group_ and _cwd_membership_ tables in the database and verify that you can see the mixed case versions of the group *jira-users-test* in these tables:\r\n !Local_Group_DB.png|thumbnail! \r\n !Local_Membership_DB.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nIt seems that JIRA treats somehow the 2 versions of the groups as 2 different groups (instead of the same group), and does not map properly users to the right group, and cause the error when we try to remove a user from this group.\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\n(!) Please make sure to create a native backup of your JIRA database before running the following query, to that you can revert the changes if anything goes wrong.\r\n Running the following query will be *at your own risk*.\r\n - Stop JIRA\r\n - Backup your database\r\n - Run the following queries to force the group_name column from the cwd_group table and the parent_name column from the cwd_membership table to be all lower cased *(note that the query to run might slightly different depending on the type of database that you are using)*\r\n{code:java}\r\nupdate cwd_group set group_name = LOWER(group_name);\r\nupdate cwd_membership set parent_name = LOWER(parent_name);\r\n{code}\r\n\r\n - Start JIRA",

Summary\r\nJIRA might see increased memory and GC pressure while responding to search requests fulfilled by Lucene used by 3rd party plugins eg: Zephyr\r\nThe plugin can allocate huge amounts of memory very fast, this memory will get collected by a Full GC which might cause increased pauses and could cause OutOfMemoryErrors if the GC was not able to keep up with the fast allocation.\r\n\r\nIt is important to note that although the Zephyr plugin is mentioned in this ticket, the same issue can be seen with other plugins as well.\r\n\r\nh3. Environment\r\n* JIRA 7.2.7  (server or Data Center)\r\n* Install a plugin that uses Lucene indexes eg: Zephyr.\r\n* Moderate sized to big JIRA instance 700k issues 400 custom fields.\r\n* Create too many search requests issued by JIRA Zephyr plugin rest API.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\nThere is no detailed steps to easily reproduce this.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nJIRA should be able to handle search requests without issues.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nJIRA will handle the requests but will progressively allocate huge amounts of org.apache.lucene.search.ScoreDoc objects under org.apache.lucene.search.HitQueue which leads to increased GC pressure.\r\nMillions of Lucene score documents are noticed.\r\n!Screenshot_20180509_201602.png|thumbnail! !Screenshot_20180509_201946.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\nh3.

Summary\r\n\r\nCreating a project in Jira can be slow, and, because Jira's front end enforces a 60 seconds timeout, even if the project creation completes successfully, if it does not do so within 60 seconds, the user will be presented with \"Request timeout when creating project\" error, and will not be redirected to the created project.\r\nh3. Environment\r\n * Projects - 2000+\r\n * Screens - 2000+\r\n * Workflows - 1400+\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Create a project from Project template (eg. Scrum)\r\n\r\nh3.

Compounding factor\r\n * The problem scales with the project scheme complexity (for example, Jira Service Management can have up to 5 workflows per project, where as Jira Software has 1 workflow per project - meaning JSM is 5x slower than JSW), and, the amount of nodes in the cluster.\r\n * If the node count > 1, then, cache flush events occur on the other nodes necessitating additional SELECT query to the db\r\n * In addition to DB queries, there can be contention on the localq - as many cache events occur resulting in many writes to the localq queue files, stored on the LOCAL_HOME volume.\u00a0 If the disk latency is poor (for example, when using a slow disk, or slow network linked disk), this contributes to the project creation time. The expectation for cache writes to disk is 1ms.\r\n * Jira's front-end Javascript code enforces a 60 seconds timeout. This is because the jQuery library being used to send the request to the server has been instructed to use a global 60 seconds timeout, in which the project creation code does not override.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nWe can address the *symptom* at this stage, but not the *cause*.\r\n\r\nTo increase the project creation front-end timeout to 300000 ms (5 minutes), add to the Jira Announcement Banner:\r\n{code:java}\r\n//\r\n// JRASERVER-67279 Workaround Start\r\n//\r\n\r\n$(document).ready(function() {\r\n//Modify the create project menu link\r\n    let observer = new MutationObserver(function(mutation){\r\n        $('#project_template_create_link_lnk').on('click', function() {\r\n            console.log(\"JRASERVER-67279 workaround triggered\");\r\n            $.ajaxSetup({ timeout : 300000 });\r\n        });\r\n    });\r\n\r\n    let container = document.documentElement || document.body;\r\n    observer.observe(container, { attributes: false, subtree: true, childList: true});\r\n\r\n//Modify the Projects List page Create Button:\r\n    $('#browse-projects-create-project').on('click', function() {\r\n        console.log(\"JRASERVER-67279 workaround triggered\");\r\n        $.ajaxSetup({ timeout : 300000 });\r\n    });\r\n}); {code}",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-36241].\n  {panel}\n\n{panel:title=Atlassian Update - 14 January 2014|borderStyle=solid|borderColor=#ebf2f9 | titleBGColor=#ebf2f9 | bgColor=#ffffff}\r\nHi everyone,\r\n\r\nThanks for voting and commenting on this issue. Your input in the comments helps us understand how your teams work and what you're hoping to accomplish with JIRA.\r\n\r\nWe have decided to close this specific request for _additional status categories_ as Won't Fix. The finite set of status categories allows us to build useful features on top of them, like completion progress indicators for Epics and Versions.\r\n\r\nWe recognize that for many teams, most of the steps in a workflow are \"In Progress\" and that it can be difficult to distinguish them. Here are some strategies:\r\n* Add additional columns to your board for different workflow states. You can have several \"In Progress\" columns to represent concepts like \"In Development\" or \"Under Review\".\r\n* Use the card colors based on JQL queries feature ([documentation|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/AGILE/Customising+Cards#CustomisingCards-colours]) to define your own colors for workflow states. I've created this suggestion in the JIRA Agile project to improve this in the future: GHS-11666\r\n* Use JIRA Agile card layouts (new in JIRA Agile 6.6) to show the workflow state on the card ([documentation|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/AGILE/Customising+Cards#CustomisingCards-fields])\r\n* To customize the display of issues within the JIRA issue navigator, consider the free third-party [icnavigator add-on|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/de.iconcept.icnavigator.jira-icnavigator] from Interconcept GmbH.\r\n\r\nWe do not plan to support arbitrary colors for status categories. The mapping of blue, yellow, and green to \"To Do\", \"In Progress\", and \"Done\" is part of [Atlassian's overall visual system|https://design.atlassian.com/latest/product/components/lozenges/]. Our intent is to improve how we use this pattern to communicate information in JIRA; however, we use the combination of colors and lozenges to represent concepts not only in JIRA, but across Atlassian's product suite.\r\n\r\nFinally, there were specific requests for a \"Red\" status color. The main use case here was situations where an issue had progressed to the end of a workflow, but the resolution was negative (e.g. \"Failed\" instead of \"Done\"). In JIRA's structure, this connects the final workflow state (i.e. \"Resolved\") with the type of resolution. While there's certainly merit in this request, it has the potential to significantly increase JIRA's complexity.\r\n\r\nI understand that our decision may be disappointing. Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nDave Meyer\r\nJIRA Product Manager\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\nThe new status colors in JIRA provides initial set of pre-defined statues. It would also be beneficial to add the ability for users to add more categories to it",

If that user no longer exists in Jira, the post function will show an entirely different workflow transition.\r\n\r\nh5. Potential Major Problem\r\nThis can cause more problems because users will not be able to perform this transition. If this was on the \"Create\" transition, users will not be able to create issues.  Admins will then be unable to determine why, as the workflow post-funcion is not apparent.\r\n\r\nh5. Steps to Reproduce\r\n* Have a workflow post function that updates the Assignee field to a specific user\r\n** the post-function list will show something like:\r\n{code}The Assignee of the issue will be set to testuser.{code}\r\n* Delete the testuser account\r\n* Check the post-function again and notice that it says:\r\n{code}\r\nOnly users with Create Issues permission can execute this transition.\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nh5. Expected Behaviour\r\nThe workflow function is still displaying the proper post-function:\r\n{code}The Assignee of the issue will be set to testuser.{code}\r\n\r\nh5. Actual Behaivour\r\nThe workflow function shows something else:\r\n{code}\r\nOnly users with Create Issues permission can execute this transition.\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nh5. Workaround\r\nYou can still edit this the  \"Only users with Create Issues permission can execute this transition.\" post-function, which will show the update field screen.  You can then change the assignee to an existing user.\r\n",

Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Add emojis to an issue header.\r\n # Display on Activity Stream gadget to make sure emojis display correctly.\r\n # Edit the issue header (e.g. Add some text to it)\r\n # Emojis should still be displayed.\r\n # Note the difference in between both, one of them has a <Summary> tag and can be displayed with no problem, against the other that cannot be properly displayed, it's all introduced on a <Title>\r\n\r\n{code:xml}\r\n<feed xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom\" xmlns:atlassian=\"http://streams.atlassian.com/syndication/general/1.0\">\r\n    <id>http://localhost:1730/jira730/activity?maxResults=1&amp;os_authType=basic</id>\r\n    <link href=\"http://localhost:1730/jira730/activity?maxResults=1&amp;os_authType=basic\" rel=\"self\" />\r\n    <title type=\"text\">Activity Streams</title>\r\n    <atlassian:timezone-offset>+0200</atlassian:timezone-offset>\r\n    <updated>2018-05-07T14:39:30.575Z</updated>\r\n    <entry xmlns:activity=\"http://activitystrea.ms/spec/1.0/\">\r\n        <id>urn:uuid:ed63b898-4506-381b-a77a-0787c8ae1855</id>\r\n        <title type=\"html\">&lt;a href=\"/jira730/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=admin\" class=\"activity-item-user activity-item-author\">Admin User [Local]&lt;/a> changed the Summary of       &lt;a href=\"/jira730/browse/BILE-81\">BILE-81&lt;/a>\r\n   to '&amp;#55357;&amp;#56613; &amp;#55357;&amp;#56613; Important important Adding some text &amp;#55357;&amp;#56613; &amp;#55357;&amp;#56613;'</title>\r\n       <author xmlns:usr=\"http://streams.atlassian.com/syndication/username/1.0\">\r\n            <name>Admin User [Local]</name>\r\n            <email>admin@example.com</email>\r\n            <uri>/jira730/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=admin</uri>\r\n            <link xmlns:media=\"http://purl.org/syndication/atommedia\" rel=\"photo\" href=\"http://localhost:1730/jira730/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10122&amp;s=16\" media:height=\"16\" media:width=\"16\" />\r\n            <link xmlns:media=\"http://purl.org/syndication/atommedia\" rel=\"photo\" href=\"http://localhost:1730/jira730/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10122&amp;s=48\" media:height=\"48\" media:width=\"48\" />\r\n            <usr:username>admin</usr:username>\r\n            <activity:object-type>http://activitystrea.ms/schema/1.0/person</activity:object-type>\r\n       </author>\r\n       <published>2018-05-07T14:06:32.647Z</published>\r\n       <updated>2018-05-07T14:06:32.647Z</updated>\r\n       <link href=\"http://localhost:1730/jira730/secure/viewavatar?size=xsmall&amp;avatarId=10303&amp;avatarType=issuetype\" rel=\"http://streams.atlassian.com/syndication/icon\" title=\"Bug\" />\r\n       <link href=\"http://localhost:1730/jira730/s/jw2r1v/73011/b6b48b2829824b869586ac216d119363/1.0/_/download/resources/jira.webresources:global-static/wiki-renderer.css\" rel=\"http://streams.atlassian.com/syndication/css\" />\r\n       <link href=\"http://localhost:1730/jira730/plugins/servlet/streamscomments/issues/BILE-81\" rel=\"http://streams.atlassian.com/syndication/reply-to\" />\r\n       <generator uri=\"/jira730\" />\r\n       <atlassian:application>com.atlassian.jira</atlassian:application>\r\n       <activity:verb>http://activitystrea.ms/schema/1.0/update</activity:verb>\r\n       <activity:object>\r\n            <id>urn:uuid:ff7a814c-3786-3e1e-8441-1168eeec0216</id>\r\n            <title type=\"text\">BILE-81</title>\r\n            <summary type=\"text\">\ud83d\udd25 \ud83d\udd25 Important important Adding some text \ud83d\udd25 \ud83d\udd25</summary>\r\n            <activity:object-type>http://streams.atlassian.com/syndication/types/issue</activity:object-type>\r\n       </activity:object>\r\n       <atlassian:timezone-offset>+0200</atlassian:timezone-offset>\r\n    </entry>\r\n</feed>\r\n{code}\r\nh3.

For example, if the move operation attempts to change the issue type of an issue, the move operation seems to succeed. Once the ticket is loaded, we see that the issue type would not have actually changed.\r\n\r\nh4. Steps to Reproduce\r\n* Open 2 different issue tickets in 2 tabs on the web browser (ie. TEST-1, TEST-2)\r\n* In TEST-1, click More > Move\r\n* Change browser tab to TEST-2 and click More > Move\r\n* In TEST-1, change the issue type and click Next\r\n* Change tab to TEST-2, change the issue type and click Next\r\n* In TEST-1, make any needed field changes and click Next\r\n* Change tab to TEST-2 and make any field changes and click Next\r\n* In TEST-1, finish the move operation by clicking Move\r\n* In TEST-2, click Move\r\n\r\nSee attached video:   [^parallel-move-problem.mov] \r\n\r\nh5. Expected Behaviour\r\nBoth move operations succeed and the issue types successfully change\r\n\r\nh5. Actual Behaviour\r\nOne of the move operations will not actually occur. It will just silently fail and not reflect any changes.",
