      "description": "h3. Problem Definition\r\n\r\nDerived from previous JRASERVER-34423 - There are times when a Jira admin might need to create a large number of issues and choose to use the REST API as a means to do this. However you don't always want to send out notifications to all the users in the notification scheme when this takes place. It would be very helpful if the issue create endpoint api/2/issue had a means to do this, much like the edit issue endpoint (api/2/issue/\\{issueIdOrKey} endpoint) has the notifyUsers query parameter.\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nImplement the notifyUsers query parameter on the issue create endpoint as well.\r\nh3. Why this is important\r\n\r\nEnd users are easily annoyed by bulk issue creation. Many users have complained about Jira being overly chatty when it comes to email. This suggested solution would provide Jira admins a quick means to create issues without flooding the inbox of everyone on your team. This implementation method would still log issue histories and trigger other events/listeners just like notifyUsers currently works on api/2/issue/\\{issueIdOrKey} endpoint.\u00a0\u00a0 The workaround can provide a solution, but it's not ideal because it is not granular enough to only limit notifications for this REST API call, it's overkill to completely change the notification scheme for this single issue creation event, and likely to leave the admin to forget to change it back.\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nIt is possible for Jira admin to temporarily modify the notification scheme in use for that project so that no users are sent out notifications for such events as Issue Created, issue assigned, etc. However this work-around is not ideal as it prevents all such notifications for any project using that scheme.",

Workaround\r\n\r\nEither one of these:\r\n # Disable the feature by setting the \"jira.dc.cleanup.cluser.tasks.disabled\" feature flag and *restart the node*. You can [follow our documentation|https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirakb/enable-dark-feature-in-jira-959286331.html] to learn how to set it.\r\n # Set the _cluster.task.cleanup.offline.node.threshold_ property to a high value, e.g. 1800000 (which equals to 30 minutes).\r\n ** *Remember to remove this override before upgrading Jira*, or else the mechanism will only clean-up tasks from nodes that are offline for ~3.5 years.\r\n # Upgrade Jira to a version containing a fix once it's available, i.e. 8.7.2, 8.8.0, or higher.\r\n\r\n(i) Please note that *the workaround needs to be applied to every node in the cluster*, because the tasks are being removed by other nodes, not the node that's executing the task.\r\n\r\nTo make sure that the first workaround works, you can enable DEBUG logs for _com.atlassian.jira.cluster.ClusterTaskCleanupService_.\r\n During the service startup (when the node starts or after a plugin system restart) you should see the _\"ClusterTaskCleanupService is disabled\"_ message logged, instead of the _\"Registering ClusterTaskCleanupService\"_ message if the feature flag is still enabled.",

The *COMPLETE_DATE* column of the *AO_60DB71_SPRINT* table is the information used at the Sprint Report (and others), and this information is always updated each time you close the sprint again.\r\n\r\nSometimes, though, the sprint is completed by mistake and the reports  should consider the correct complete date, but instead it considers the latest complete date which, on these cases, will be after the reopening.\r\n\r\nThe End Date is more accurate, but it wouldn't make sense as the complete date could be different than what is filled at the End Date. For example:\r\n\r\n# Create Sprint A and set it's End Date as 02/05/2020\r\n# Complete sprint at 03/05/2020. The Completed Date will be 03/05/2020\r\n# Reopen the Sprint A at 04/05/2020 because there were some missing stories from another sprint that were done at Sprint A. Include these stories at the sprint, and complete it again. The Completed Date will be 04/05/2020.\r\n# The Sprint Report will be generated considering the COMPLETE_DATE, which was at 04/05/2020, which is understandable, however, the correct close date was 03/05/2020. Neither END_DATE not COMPLETE_DATE stores this date for the sprint to work correctly.\r\n \r\nh3. Current Workaround\r\nIt is needed database manipulation to change this information, which is not supported by Atlassian and could lead to further errors.\r\n\r\nh3. Suggestion\r\nA few suggestions:\r\n- Have the Completed Date field at the Sprint Report to be editable so the user can input the date he wants, or\r\n- Have the COMPLETE_DATE field editable when completing the sprint, or\r\n- Have a third field like \"ORIGINAL_CLOSED_DATE\" which will always inform the date the sprint was first closed, by mistake or not.\r\n",

Issue Summary\r\nTrying to configure a new application link or loading the Application link page to list the status of existing Applinks will show \"NETWORK ERROR\" in red.  \r\nThe REST client  {{atlassian-rest-module:3.2.16}} while reading headers (eg. Content-Type) does a _case-sensitive lookup_ for them (headers name should be _case-insensitive_). So when headers are in lower case it can't parse them properly. The problem is triggered by the proxy server, which is converting all HTTP header names to lower-case.\r\n\r\nh3. Environment\r\n* Use of proxy which converts the HTTP headers to lower-case. \r\n** Example HAProxy with native HTTP representation (HTX) enabled. This will force headers internally to be stored in lowercase.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Setup two Atlassian applications behind a proxy\r\n# Setup HAProxy with HTX enabled on one of the application\r\n# Configure Application link between the two applications\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nThe application link can be configured and established\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nThe application link is not configured correctly with \"NETWORK ERROR\" due to wrong headers.\r\n\r\nh3. Diagnosis\r\nGenerate HAR file in the process of configuring or loading the Application link page. \r\n* On Application link page load, locate {{/rest/applinks-oauth/latest/applicationlink/<applinkid>/authentication}} and see *UNEXPECTED_RESPONSE* in its body.\r\n\r\nh3. Notes\r\n* As per [RFC 2616|https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec4.html#sec4.2], HTTP 1.1 expects headers name to be case-insensitive. \r\n* HTTP 2.0 enforce the requirement for the headers to be all lowercase as per [RFC 7540 about HTTP/2|https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7540#section-8.1.2], see JRASERVER-70517\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\nOn the proxy side, disable the handling of headers to all lowercase:\r\n* Example HAProxy, set {{no option http-use-htx}}\r\n* Example for Envoy - [header_casing|https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/configuration/http/http_conn_man/header_casing]",

Summary\r\n\r\nA user who is a member of the Project Role (Administrators) which has been added to the *Administer Project* permission is unable to edit the Project Lead/Default assignee, if this user is not grated the *Jira Administrators* global permission.\r\n\r\nAccording to the [documentation|https://confluence.atlassian.com/jira/managing-project-permissions-185729636.html], the *Administer Project* permission allows any user w/ the permission to edit the Project Lead:\r\n{quote}Permission to administer a project in JIRA. This includes the ability to edit project role membership, project components, project versions and some project details ('Project Name', 'URL', 'Project Lead', 'Project Description').\r\n{quote}\r\nHowever, with this bug, a user with the *Administer Project* permission is unable to edit the Project Lead. No errors appear in the UI or in the logs.\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Log into Jira as a user who has *Jira Administrators* global permission\r\n # Go to the user management page, and create a user (referred to as \"testuser\")\r\n ## Grant this user Jira application access\r\n ## (!) Do not grant this user with the *Jira Administrators* global permission\r\n # Create a new project\r\n # Go to the page *Project settings > Users and Roles*\r\n # Grant the user \"testuser\" the project role *Administrators*\r\n # Click on the *Edit defaults* button and try to set any user as the project lead\r\n # Verify that this user is properly added to the \"Project Lead\" field\r\n !Step1.png|thumbnail!\r\n # Log into Jira the user \"testuser\" and navigate to *Project settings > Users and Roles*\r\n # Click on *Edit Defaults*\r\n # Change project lead to another user and click on *Update*\r\n !Step2.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nh3.

User is able to update changes to Project Lead and you see the Project Lead correctly updated on the page:\r\n!Step5.png|thumbnail!\r\nh3.

Workaround\r\n\r\nGrant the user who is unable to edit the project lead with the *Jira Administrators* global permission.

      "description": "h3. Summary\r\nThe *atlassian-bot-killer*  plugin watches every request via a servlet Filter and checks if it has seen the session before.  If not it must be the first request for that session. It then stores the original session timeout in the session itself and sets the session _inactivity timeout to be 1 minute_.  If the session makes a second request then it gets bumped back to the original timeout of say 5 hours.  It follows the same strategy on requests with a known user however to be conservative it sets the inactivity time out to be 10 minutes instead of 1. Context [getting-rid-of-unwanted-http-sessions|https://www.atlassian.com/blog/archives/getting-rid-of-unwanted-http-sessions]\r\n\r\nDue to wrong logic, all users are considered bots and all sessions have their inactive lifetime reduced, overwriting all normally configured settings. This limits user's session to one minute or one hour. \r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\nBased on [~kczeladko] steps:\r\n# Configure session timeout to 300 = 5h in $JIRA_INSTALL/atlassian-jira/WEB-INF/web.xml\r\n# Restart Jira\r\n# Create page in $JIRA_INSTALL/atlassian-jira/secure/sessionattributes.jsp to check session attributes\r\n# Do a 1st visit to Jira http://company.xyz/jira/secure/sessionattributes.jsp\r\n# Visit 2nd time Jira - sessionattributes.jsp\r\n# Visit 3rd time Jira - sessionattributes.jsp\r\n\r\nh3.

The team thought this was weird, since if they're \"done\", why aren't they disappearing?\r\n\r\nThe kanban board sub-filter is the answer. The default behaviour for kanban is to show issues with no `fixVersion`. Since we don't use those, they'll collect there forever.\r\n\r\n(Aside: what would it mean to \"release\" a project with no versions? Does that make sense?)\r\n\r\nThe other weird thing about the filter is its mental model. The correct model: things that match the query will be *visible* on the board; everything else will be *hidden* after a period of time. The problem with this, however, is the context in which the filter is changed. If you're like my team, you're going to change it when your \"done\" column gets heavy... which means you're going there to *hide* issues, not *show* them. As a result the query can seem a bit nonsensical at first -- I accidentally made everything show up as \"done\" the first time.\r\n\r\nI think one of two things could be done here:\r\n\r\n* the description of the kanban sub-filter could be updated to more clearly state that it makes issues visible, and anything that *doesn't* match it will get hidden.\r\n* the field's purpose could be inverted; it would be about selecting issues that are \"done\". This shift can drastically simplify the mental model for end-users (no double-negatives to think about; you're selecting a discrete set intersection, rather than defining two sets and taking the difference).",
