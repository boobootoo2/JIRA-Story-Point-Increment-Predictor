Why this is important\n\nCompanies may want to use Organizations to organize their Customers but not want to make all the Developers full-fledged Service Desk Agents in order to make it possible to sort Requests by Organization.\nh3.

Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nJIRA Service Desk would use this setting when it sends out notifications to customers.\r\n\r\nh5. Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nJIRA Service Desk seems to use the username of the person who performed the change whereas JIRA projects respect the change.\r\n\r\nh5. Observation\r\n\r\nAs JIRA Service Desk notification is different from the normal one used by JIRA, could this be because this is hard-coded and this is the expected behavior?",

It's currently possible to raise an issue on behalf of another user (even just an email address), so it would be good, if follow-up responses could also be added as comments from that user.\n\nIt would probably be enough to just extend the existing comment service to allow to provide an author.\n\nThanks,\nTobias",

Summary\nAfter upgrading to JSD 3.3.0, a pop-up window which should allow users to click on a \"Migrate Now\" link to disable legacy transitions does not work with error as shown in screenshot below. \n !automation.png|thumbnail! \n\nh3. Environment\n* The affected project workflow has legacy transitions. To identify this, please follow the *Resolution: Check your JIRA Service Desk project workflow properties* as outlined in [this link|https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirakb/how-to-fix-this-service-project-may-not-work-as-expected-error-777027034.html#HowtofixThisserviceprojectmaynotworkasexpectederror-CheckyourJIRAServiceDeskprojectworkflowproperties].\n\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\n# In an instance with JSD 2.3.6, create a JSD project and make sure there are legacy transitions in the project's workflow.\n# Upgrade the instance to JSD 3.0.0.\n# Upgrade the instance to JSD 3.3.0.\n# Create an Automation rule to transition on comment (the default one).\n\nh3. Expected Results\nAn \"Automation is the future\" message will appear and users should be able to click on the \"Migrate Now\" link to disable legacy transitions.\n\nh3. Actual Results\n* An \"Automation is the future\" message will appear but when users click on the \"Migrate Now\" link, an error occurs (see screenshot) and the \"Automation is the future\" message continue to appear from time to time.\n* In the *Network* tab of the browser developer tool, there will be a PUT request send to site URL like {{http://localhost:8080/rest/servicedesk/1/servicedesk/disableLegacyTransition/1}} with status code 404, which means not found.\n\nh3.Workaround\n# Identify the transition ID from the last part of the URL of the request.\n#* For example, *ID = 1* for {{http://localhost:8080/rest/servicedesk/1/servicedesk/disableLegacyTransition/1}}\n# Update via database with the SQL query below.\n#* {code:SQL}update \"AO_54307E_SERVICEDESK\" set \"LEGACY_TRANSITION_DISABLED\"='t' where \"ID\" = 1;{code}\n#* If only _int_ is allowed for the \"LEGACY_TRANSITION_DISABLED\" column {code:SQL}update \"AO_54307E_SERVICEDESK\" set \"LEGACY_TRANSITION_DISABLED\"=1 where \"ID\" = 1;{code}\n# Restart JIRA.\n(i) Always back up your data before performing any modification to the database.

Description of Problem:\n\nJIRA Server instances that have had JSD in the past may have trouble installing JSD 3.2+  if they ever had JSD in the past and did not go through JSD 3.0/3.1 to complete the necessary upgrade tasks. \n\nIn some cases JSD data is unwanted and can be deleted. For example when JSD was previously installed as a trial.\n\nh3. Suggestion\n\nAdd a supported method for removing all JSD data from the instance. \n\nUse case and suggestion: \n# Customer upgrading from JSD 2.5.9 or under and does not wish to keep any JSD data (JSD was a trial, or any other reason)\n#* If desired, customer is able to remove all JSD data so that they can install JSD anytime in the future\n# Customer who is currently running JIRA 7.2 and up and is trying to install JSD. Unbeknownst to the customer JSD was installed in earlier version and 3.0/3.1 upgrade tasks were not completed.\n#* Customer is able to drop all JSD data so that they can install JSD without having to attempt downgrade. \n\nSuggesting adding a startup flag that tells JSD to drop all JSD data\n\nh3. Workaround\nThere is currently no supported workaround. Directly modifying the JIRA database to remove JSD data is not supported.",

Problem Definition\n\nIf the *Add Comments* project permission is removed from the *Service Desk Customer - Portal Access* role, customers sending in emails to comment on their own tickets will instead end up creating a new email with that comment, leading to confusion.\n\nh3. Suggested Solution\n\nIntroduce logging into the application logs which inform the user specifically why Issues are being created rather than the original issue being commented, such as:\n\n\"Service Desk Customer - Portal Access missing Add Comments project permission, creating issue instead\"\n\nAlternatively, if the email can be recognized as being related to an existing issue, reject the email outright with similar logging:\n\n\"Service Desk Customer - Portal Access missing Add Comments project permission, skipping...\" \n\nh3. Why this is important\n \nWhile this is not inherently a bug and is intended behavior, there could be improvements in the logging or messaging that is provided to the user, since it isn't necessarily clear that the resulting behavior is that a new issue is created, rather than the email being rejected outright. This could be done in the application logging, or via clearer errors/warnings in the UI project permissions. \n",

But, from the feedback we've received so far, we understand that this method doesn't work for all teams. To help us improve this experience in the future, we're changing this bug to a feature request so we can continue to gather feedback.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nThe JIRA Service Desk team\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\nh3. \r\nSummary\r\n\r\nThe organization field can be added to the Create Screen but once added, it actually doesn't appear in the screen when creating new issues\r\nh3.
