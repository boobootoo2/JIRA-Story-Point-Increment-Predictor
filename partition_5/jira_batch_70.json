That is something like midday for them and late morning for me. SourceTree shows \"21:22\" the previous day in the Date column. This is not only Wrong, but also incorrect.

      "description": "Cloned an existing TFS server (along with all commits and comments) to Git using Git-Tf.  Created a new repository on BitBucket, then committed the newly created local Git repo to it.  Upon trying to clone the repo to another machine using SourceTree (v 1.6.12, dl'ed from sourcetreeapp.com) the master branch would clone, but the UI would hang, and the RAM used would go over 2GB (sometimes up to 3GB in come cases).\r\n\r\nUninstalled 1.6.12 (along with all local app data) then installed 1.5.2.  Cloned repo again with no issues.  Created a few commits to master branch, and initialized git-flow.  Updated software to 1.6.12.  Noticed no hanging issues.  When I highlighted the initial commit (from previous paragraph) the same hanging occurred, which led me to believe that the UI was hanging because needing to list over 2500 files in the Log/History window.",
