This is good however it ruins the Activity Stream, which gets hard to read and takes long time to load. \r\n\r\nI'd wish I could limit the length of Activity Stream entry to e.g. 200 characters. It should work like newspaper rss feeds, where only the beginning of articles is available. \r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nLukasz",

He will also be allowed to change the team head or switch teams for a user. If an issue is assigned to a user who is the team head then the same user should be populated in the PFM field. \r\n\r\nThe main idea for such a request is because the developers and the testers works on various issues on a daily basis.

For PostgreSQL, there are currently two providers that can be used according to http://jdbc.postgresql.org/documentation/84/ds-ds.html:\r\n{quote}\r\nApplications: DataSource\r\n\r\nPostgreSQL\u2122 includes two implementations of DataSource , as shown in Table 11.2, \"DataSource Implementations\". One that does pooling and the other that does not. The pooling implementation does not actually close connections when the client calls the close method, but instead returns the connections to a pool of available connections for other clients to use. This avoids any overhead of repeatedly opening and closing connections, and allows a large number of clients to share a small number of database connections.\r\n\r\nThe pooling data-source implementation provided here is not the most feature-rich in the world. Among other things, connections are never closed until the pool itself is closed; there is no way to shrink the pool. As well, connections requested for users other than the default configured user are not pooled. Its error handling sometimes cannot remove a broken connection from the pool. In general it is not recommended to use the PostgreSQL\u2122 provided connection pool. Check your application server or check out the excellent jakarta commons DBCP project.\r\n\r\nTable 11.2. DataSource Implementations\r\n\r\nPooling\tImplementation Class\r\nNo\torg.postgresql.ds.PGSimpleDataSource\r\nYes\torg.postgresql.ds.PGPoolingDataSource\r\n\r\nBoth implementations use the same configuration scheme. JDBC requires that a DataSource be configured via JavaBean properties, shown in Table 11.3, \"DataSource Configuration Properties\", so there are get and set methods for each of these properties.\r\n\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nCan the required provider be discovered and explictly documented as the one a customer using WebSphere 6.1 connecting to a PostgreSQL DB must use.",

On save it is not validated how many chars are in that field. If there are more than 255 chars in it, JIRA throws a System Error, because the according database field seems to be text(255).\r\n\r\nINSERT INTO portalpage (ID, USERNAME, PAGENAME, DESCRIPTION, SEQUENCE, FAV_COUNT) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?)

This is related to the RSS feed.\r\nHowever, most people know what changes they've made themselves, so the major benefit of this Activity Stream would be to see other users' activities. \r\n\r\nI would like to see the option to pull down an activity stream of OTHER users, in the portlet -- and importantly for me, the RSS feed (http://jira.myhost.co.nz/plugins/servlet/streams?os_authType=basic).\r\n\r\nI suggest this could be effected by one of:\r\n\r\nA) Modify Portlet config panel, to include a checkbox \"[x] Exclude changes by current user\" (in addition to the username filters). Importantly (for me), the RSS feed would need to honour this exclusion.\r\nB) Allow operators in the username fields -- such \"!myusername\" to represent \"NOT myusername\". This would be most useful if you could use \"!currentUser()\" as a username value.\r\nC) Allow a variation to the RSS field URL, to specify exclusions .... e.g. \"...os_authType=basic&excludeuser=myusername\"\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, option (A) is probably the easiest to understand for new users to JIRA and has a simple to understand interface. B and C, while perhaps more flexible, would likely require reading a document/help text to discover (which, given the developer audience of JIRA is probably acceptable if option A is undesirable).\r\n\r\n",

This can force a major collection to be done when it may not be necessary (i.e., when a minor collection would suffice), and so in general should be avoided. The performance impact of explicit garbage collections can be measured by disabling them using the flag -XX:+DisableExplicitGC, which causes the VM to ignore calls to System.gc().\r\n\r\nOne of the most commonly encountered uses of explicit garbage collection occurs with RMI's distributed garbage collection (DGC). Applications using RMI refer to objects in other virtual machines. Garbage cannot be collected in these distributed applications without occasionally collection the local heap, so RMI forces full collections periodically. {quote}Alternatively,{quote}The frequency of these collections can be controlled with properties. For example,\r\n\r\n\t java -Dsun.rmi.dgc.client.gcInterval=3600000 -Dsun.rmi.dgc.server.gcInterval=3600000 ...\r\n \r\nspecifies explicit collection once per hour instead of the default rate of once per minute. However, this may also cause some objects to take much longer to be reclaimed. These properties can be set as high as Long.MAX_VALUE to make the time between explicit collections effectively infinite, if there is no desire for an upper bound on the timeliness of DGC activity.{quote}\r\n\r\nOriginates from [CSP-38789|https://support.atlassian.com/browse/CSP-38789]. Explicit remote GC can be completely disabled (ignored) via {{-XX:+DisableExplicitGC}} in Tomcat startup parameters, under Sun Hotspot. Recommend we add this to the distribution startup parameters. Ignoring client requests for GC should not have any impact moving forward as JIRA has already been notified that the object is dirty, or dereferenced, and will reclaim it as part of normal collections.",
