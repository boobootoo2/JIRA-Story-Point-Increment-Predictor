Browsing the issue directly, works fine, however when running a search the issue wont be displayed.  The problem is basically that when running a search, permission checks are carried out against the index.  In order for this permission check to work if the issue security level depends on a user custom field, then the value of that customfield needs to be indexed.  This however only happens if a searcher has been set for the customfield.\r\n\r\nThe boolean permissions query being constructed may look something like this (depending on the groups a user may be in):\r\n{noformat}\r\nissue_security_level:-1 (+(+issue_security_level:10000 +(customfield_10000:jira-users customfield_10000:jira-developers))) \r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nIf {{customfield_10000}} does not exist in the indexed documents (which will be the case if no searcher has been defined) then this query will always return false.\r\n\r\nThe workaround for this is to set a searcher for your customfield and and reindex JIRA.\r\n\r\nIn the long run we'll have to fix this by either:\r\n# Indexing user custom fields always (regardless if a searcher has been set or not)\r\n# Not allow users to remove a searcher for a user customfield that's being used as a permission.  Similarly not allow users to add a user customfield as a permission without a searcher.\r\n# When the permission lucene query is being constructed, query the DB directly if the user customfield has not been indexed.\r\n\r\n",

I only use Jetbrains's IDEA product, but they have many more products that are listed in Jira.\r\n\r\nThe problem I have with Quick Search is that it shows issues across all projects, it shows issues with all statuses.\r\nEventually I just got fed up with it and created a filter \"IDEA Search Template\" which has the projects, status, and resolution fields preset with a search term \"ChangeThisXYZ\". So, now what I do is click on \"IDEA Search Template\", then click Edit filter, then change the filter text, and then click View to see the jiras.\r\n\r\nThis got me thinking that maybe the Quick Search could just allow you to set a search filter as the default settings for the Quick Search. The Quick Search would use all the settings in the filter except for the query string. The query string would still be taken from the quick search textbox.",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-13776].\r\n  {panel}\r\n\r\nh3. Problem Definition\r\nEach time users that send emails to a designated mailbox from which Jira retrieves them in order to create new tickets or add comments to existing ones usually contain footers with company's logos, marketing imagery or some standard text. All these attachments are autiomatically added to tickets into file attachments therefore cluttering important content.\r\n\r\nAssume the following scenario:\r\n1. New issue created from an e-mail message (HTML) and image attachment added to the issue\r\n2. above issue.is commented from the reply e-mail\r\nResult: the images from original part of message are attached once again.\r\n\r\nWith long correspondence the amount of duplicated images becomes VERY big.\r\n \r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\nCould we have an option to create filters or a new option in Jira's ticket that allows to remove existing and ignore future content or attachments files in newly retrieved messages? Ideally in files attachments one would click option and select \"Remove and ignore\" or have a dedicated feature to manageme ignored files and text content that is being removed for each email message going into JIRA. This could be global, per project or even per ticket etc.",

Currently the Assignee field defaults to the currently assigned user, usually the resolver.  This is never the correct value for this field during a Resolve transition.\r\n\r\nWhen we reopen an issue, we want the Assignee field to select the last assigned user.  I note there is already a request for this functionality.\r\n\r\nOur plan is to install a Post Function that assigns the issue to the Reporter, and remove the Assignee field from the resolve screen.  This is less than ideal.

Then you clone it with all subtasks and move the clone to project B. \r\n\r\nSome time later you create a new subtask for the issue in project A.  If you now want the new subtask in the clone too, then there's quite a lot to do because you can't move a subtask to another project.\r\nWhat can be done is: clone the subtask. Convert it to a normal issue. Move it. Change to subtask. This ist quite a lot to do for such a simple action.\r\n\r\nIt would be really helpful to move subtask directly to another project because we need that very often.\r\n\r\nCheers and thx,\r\nIrene",

      "description": "*Use Case:* A user makes a request to application A. To complete this request, A needs to retrieve information from application B with that user's credentials.\r\n\r\n*Example:* The JIRA Issues Macro in Confluence currently can only show issues that are public (available to all users) or to a specific user/password encoded in plain-text in the macro's issue URL. Instead, we want to pass the name of the user viewing the page containing the macro to JIRA and then show all issues that user can see.\r\n\r\nWe need a secure way to pass a user's credentials around between applications. As the password is not stored, passing that around is not an option. Using Crowd, or any other SSO solution, the user's SSO token can be passed around, but we need a solution that works when not under SSO as well.\r\n\r\nIn short this involves creating trusted relationships between applications. For instance, a Confluence administrator requests a trusted connection from it to JIRA. The JIRA URL is entered and a conversation is initiated that involves a key exchange, then a JIRA administrator is required to authorise the Confluence application as trusted. Confluence is then notified that it is a trusted application, and any requests from it will contain special headers containing encrypted information identifying the application, the user and the time of the request (to stop replay attacks). The requested application should have several options to specify the security levels required such as net-mask (to tie the requesting application to a specific IP or range), time-out (for replay attacks) and secure key exchange (eg. only over HTTPS).\r\n\r\nNote: it is anticipated this is a core Atlassian component, but individual applications will need to provide client and server facilities like key persistence and configuration user-interface.",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-13713].\n  {panel}\n\nOur Jira setup uses a separate Database Server (MySQL), over the past few weeks we have had several failures. In one the whole database became unavailable, and on two more occasions the database went read only (disk full, commits not possible).\r\n\r\nWhile we obviously need to sort out the issues with the database uptime (and contractually it should be 100%, so we have a issue with the provider) we were also disappointed with Jira's behaviour during the outages. [please note: from my perspective as an admin, the logs etc.. were fine, messages were geeky but could be interpreted, and no corruption of the database has occurred].\r\n\r\nOur end users, however, were confronted with error pages simply framed the Java exception (in all it's 'glory') no real attempt was made to clarify the situation to the user, just a very complex error message and a note to call the administrators.\r\n\r\nIn particular, when the dB was read-only, there was no problem viewing issues (which is good) but submitting issues only failed when the user had already entered all their data. Causing much irritation for some who had spent time entering detailed descriptions. Our only choices were to take Jira down altogether, or add a big red announcement banner (tm).\r\n\r\nWe appreciate that there is no easy technical fix for this, and that there will always be race conditions (Db goes down while user is editing etc..) that are hard to handle, but in situations where Jira relies on an potentially fallible external resource there is an opportunity to provide much more user-friendly error notification.",

QA here would find it a time saver and paper saver to be able to print a combined view that includes Comments and Work History.  Selecting All or Change History are not options because in my workplace we have an extensive workflow which causes the All and Change History view to present many rows of data that are unimportant to us and a waste of paper when printing.",
