The process is that we first create sketches that we discuss and agree on, create the epic(s) and user stories in Jira, describe these as detailed as necessary, break them down, estimate and start the work. In the middle of this there is also an approval per issue to ensure that we haven't misunderstood each other along the way. \r\n\r\nOnce the user stories are approved the requirements are transferred to Confluence for later reference - they are also \"bound\" together to make it easier to read as a whole if needed. \r\n\r\nWhat we would like is to write the descriptions fully in Confluence and tag them with anchors or similar, and then link these specific anchors from Jira. In this way we would only have to write the descriptions once, and we do not risk the possible differences between what is described in the two different systems. \r\n\r\nI know you can write something in Confluence, \"mention\" the Jira-issue and this way get a link between the two. But that would again require the developer to go back and forth, which is not very optimal for us. ",

Userstory\r\nAs a enterprise user, using bleeding edge unreleased IE version, I want to use JIRA deployed into our intranet, without seeing red error message saying *Internet Explorer 7.0 is not a supported browser*.\r\nh4. To Reproduce\r\n# way 1\r\n## install JIRA to intranet domain address\r\n## configure IE 11 to use compatibility mode for intranet sites\r\n# way 2\r\n## add your JIRA domain to compatibility mode sites list\r\n# access JIRA\r\n# now you should see red bar at the top of the page\r\n\r\nh4. The Cause\r\nThis issue is cause by the fact, that when coding JIRA you had no idea what kind of user-agent string Microsoft would use for IE 11 and hence have no support for recognizing IE 11, when it's in compatibility mode.\r\n\r\nh4. The Fix\r\nI have added a .patch file with simple fix to detect if browser, that reports itself to be MSIE 7.0, is in fact IE 11.\r\nNote, you might want to future proof yourself by detecting that Trident version is greater than 6.0 or 7.0 and decide, that this is in fact also IE that is newer than IE 11 and doesn't need warning about IE 7.0 not being supported.",

As a web developer we often need to clear our cookies in most or all of our browsers which renders the Tempo timer useless as we lose all time when this happens. We have been using other browsers as a workaround but we usually have to clear cache in those also. A second great feature about doing this server side is that we can adjust our timers from any of our devices whether we are in a meeting, on the road, or anywhere really. One consistent timer would be a great Tempo improvement!",

And after pulling out my hair after figuring out why my iOS code wasn't handling JSON appropriately, I tried something.\r\n\r\nI entered, in a browser window, https://username:password@hostname/rest/api/2/foo , and two things happened:\r\n\r\n1: The correct data was displayed, and:\r\n\r\n2: The URL was retconned to https://hostname/rest/api/2/foo\r\n\r\nThe reason why I only got empty results was that a REST API pull of https://username:password@hostname/rest/api/2/foo does not behave as one would expect from a REST API, especially not one as simple and powerful as JIRA genuinely offers.\r\n\r\nI'm pretty much dead in the water for my original approach to getting data. I can circumvent this issue by manually copying data from JIRA to static content on my own server, but that is a workaround to a development blocker, not a solution, even a cumbersome one, to real production usage. You might be able to help me work around this difficulty, but if you're going to advertise a RESTful API, it would be nice if you didn't practically defeat the REST standby of https://username:password@hostname/rest/api/2/foo\r\n\r\nI'm open to learning cookies or whatever powers live human browser usage of your REST API, but your failure to support basic authentication over HTTPS had me pulling my hair out trying to figure out what I had done wrong in iOS to not let iOS handle your JSON properly.\r\n\r\nI think a REST API with support for basic authentication would be a major improvement.",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-35227].\n  {panel}\n\nWe've recently upgraded to JIRA 6.0.8 from 5.2.11, and one of the first things my users noticed is that the width of the Text and Free Text fields (including the built-in ones like _Summary_ and _Description_) has been reduced significantly on Create and Edit forms.\r\n\r\nIn general, we love the new interface, but this specific example is causing some pain, as the UI now makes it more difficult to enter large amounts of text.  Also, unlike in previous releases, the \"max-width\" property is being set for these fields, meaning that users aren't allowed to enlarge the text boxes for Free Text fields in browsers that provide that capability (like Chrome).  This is triggering a lot of \"workaround\" behaviour, where people are using other tools to write their text, and then pasting it into the JIRA form...this is not a good model, as it is very error-prone.\r\n\r\nMy users noticed that the new widths are being equally applied to the static Create and Edit forms, as on the QuickCreate and QuickEdit forms, even though the static forms have much more room to work with.  This used to be the favoured approach by those that didn't like the smaller fields on the QuickCreate/QuickEdit forms, but there is no longer any difference between the forms.\r\n\r\nCurrently, these fields are being styled with the \"long-field\" class.  This request is to re-classify these fields as \"full-width-field\", which does not set the max-width attribute.",

This results in not seeing all the issues (if some has been added to the concrete view) or in an empty space after the list of issues in the view.\r\n\r\nThe only solution how to solve this is to: \r\n# click on \"More\" on the view's header bar, \r\n# click on \"Edit\" and then \r\n# *Cancel* the edit (as clicking on *Save* will result in no change at all). \r\n\r\nAfter this bothering steps the view is re-rendered with height set up accordingly.\r\n\r\nI am attaching 4 screens, each containing two views:\r\n# second view is smaller than the list of issues\r\n# after the sequence of steps described above the view is re-rendered\r\n# first view is now bigger (3 tasks were closed) - after clicking on \"Refresh\" only the issues are refreshed, view remains the same height as if there were 8 issues (as before)\r\n# after the sequence of steps described above the view is re-rendered\r\n\r\nThis is really annoying so fixing this would be highly appreciated.",
