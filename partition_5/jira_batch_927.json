So it does that. \r\n\r\nHowever, if Modify Reporter privilege is set, there are two options:\r\n1. the current logged in user\r\n2. an anonymous reporter\r\n\r\nJIRA currently doesn't have the means of distinguishing between the two, so we fail with an error message.\r\n\r\nCan we please improve this? For example, could we not have an extra attribute on the CreateIssue tag that indicated specifically that we wanted an anonymous reporter?\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the [documentation|http://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/docs/latest/jelly.html#CreateIssue] needs improving as all it says it that the default value for reporter is the currently logged in user. I will create a separate issue for this documentation task.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nIan",

I have not yet proved that the customer has extra spaces in the database or email addresses, etc. I'm just raising a potential issue in the code, or an area where the code might perhaps be improved.\r\n\r\nPlease forgive me if I am off the mark here and the strings are being trimmed somewhere where I have not looked.\r\n\r\nNor have I established whether it is even possible to store blank characters around email addresses in the database, or extract blank characters around email addresses in the email.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nIan",

These links are very useful where they're already located inside of JIRA.  It would be a frustrating experience for a user to find our JIRA instance, realize they need an account to create an issue, have to navigate elsewhere to create the account, and then return back to JIRA to create the issue.\r\n\r\nIn the absence of being able to internally forward these requests to Crowd, an alternate approach would be to supply an href to JIRA in a configuration file that would cause any user-update requests to go to that link (instead of the pre-existing JIRA page).",

As most of our users have LDAP accounts (with the same name as the username in the email) it would be nice to create accounts for them that can be used with the LDAP.  This could be done in two ways that I can think of: the easier (and one I would at some level prefer) is to have an ignore domain flag in the service options.  We would set ignore_domain=example.com and it would create new users with just the local part of their email addresses. \r\n\r\nThe other way would be to do some validation/checks on the backend data source, but that is going to be a great deal more complex.",

Your feedback is key to helping us understand how you use JIRA so we can continue improving your experience. We have reviewed this issue over the last few days; however there are no immediate plans to put this suggestion on our near term roadmap.\r\n\r\nPlease remember that jira.atlassian.com is one of many inputs for the JIRA roadmap. You can [learn more about our process here|https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/110373/how-does-the-jira-team-use-jira-atlassian-com].\r\n\r\nI understand that our decision may be disappointing. Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nDaniel Franz\r\ndfranz@atlassian.com\r\nPrincipal Product Manager, JIRA Platform\r\n{panel}\r\n  \r\n\r\nI am thinking of having a field that serves as an time estimator field. That means, that the assignee can specify in days or weeks estimate of period they need to complete an assignment. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately I don't find one in the JIRA custom fields section. \r\n\r\nAny ideas for this? Or is there any alternative to this?\r\n\r\n",

An email that contains \"inline\" XML (i.e. XML as the body of the message, not as an attachment) and with MIME type text/xml, results in an empty JIRA issue being created. That is, the XML is not in the issue, neither as the description nor as an attachment. The XML data is lost.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, there is information produced in the log.\r\n\r\nThe support case is [JSP-12868|https://support.atlassian.com/browse/JSP-12868].\r\n\r\nThe customer's email is sent by Microsoft Biztalk. I managed to reproduce the problem, sending the email using Mutt (and super-Jeff). I have attached the mail Jeff and I used to reproduce the problem.\r\n\r\nIf the email instead has the XML as an attachment (not inline), and the attachment is of type text/xml, then the XML is included in the created issue (as an attachment).\r\n\r\nIf the XML is in the body of the message, but the message type is text/plain, the XML is included in the created issue (in the description).\r\n\r\nThat is, the problem only exists for inline XML with mail type text/xml.\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\nIan\r\n",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-12891].\n  {panel}\n\nImplement a new permission that lets a user have \"version maintenance \" capabilities.  This is currently only available to \"project admins\" -- but would be better delegated to \"release/project managers\".\r\n\r\nThis was originally raised in JRA-2473.  Now that more rights have been bundled under the \"Administer Projects\" permission , there really is a need for a separate \"Manage Versions\" permission for release managers.  I also saw that JRA-11884 requests that user management be a separate permission.",
