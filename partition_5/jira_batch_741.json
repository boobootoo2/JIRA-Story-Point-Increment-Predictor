However, the length of this input is not validated on the browser side. So when an object filter longer than 255 characters is entered into the field it fails against the database server causing an ugly SQL exception to be thrown at the user.\r\n\r\nIt's better to add validation for this entry on the client side for a few reasons:\r\n* Although, standard databases would reject the input, Hsql for instance, did not enforce this column constraint and accepted the entry. This may cause failure in the future, if a user tries to migrate the same instance from Hsql to a production-worthy environment.\r\n* The related bug report, regarding increasing the ammount of characters allowed for filters has been marked as wont fix (https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRA-24799), so having a user friendly message that warns the user about this limitation/restriction will be nice.",

But for those with the permission, there may indeed be a likelihood that inexperienced JIRA project administrators, while editing a workflow that is limited to their project, may assume that editing the statuses(e.g status description) is limited to their project as well, not knowing that these changes are actually global, and would affect all workflows using the status.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it's best not to allow statuses to be editable from within the workflow, or perhaps it's possible to make it a bit more obvious (perhaps by a warning) that such changes are global.",

This behavior is not reproducible against our DEV and TST environments for the upgrade, which were running 6.1.2 and 6.1.5 respectively.  The Vendor has also not been able to reproduce the issue on his 6.1.7 test instance.  Please see his note below :\r\n\r\n\"Given the situation where CLI is working fine against 6.1.2 and 6.1.5, it is most likely a server side problem. Perhaps something got messed up in the restore process that is impacting some functions. You will need to get Atlassian involved to have a look. The service that is failing is getCustomFields.\"",

      "description": "This is a classic Bugzilla migration situation where we have an externalIssueID column associated with a number of our bugs.  One of our users, here, attempted to do the following:\r\n\r\n# Start a new, empty search.\r\n# Switch to the List View in the navigator.\r\n# Open the Columns list and add External issue ID to the list.\r\n\r\nAt this point, the column absolutely appears in the navigator as you would expect.  Then he:\r\n\r\n# Clicked on the External issue ID column to sort (understanding this is expected to sort lexicographically).\r\n\r\nUpon clicking on the column header, the column vanishes from the List VIew.  Any attempts to re-add the column to the List VIew fail... the column refused to reappear until a new search is executed, though attempting to sort on it once again triggers the issue.\r\n\r\nNote, this test also fails with a saved search.  While the column is present in the saved search, sorting on the column upon opening the search causes the column to also disappear.\r\n\r\nUpdate:  Further testing seems to explain the behaviour: if any issues in the resultset *don't have the field*, then the column gets eliminated from the list view.  That is, qualifying the search by \"externalIssueId is not empty\" results in correct behaviour.\r\n\r\nWhile we *can* simply sort for issues containing the external IDs we're interested in, this is definitely a significant nuisance, as during this transition phase we're going to need to move back and forth between JIRA and Bugzilla issue IDs, as the latter are recorded in various release notes and so forth,\r\n",

As we already have a fully configured JIRA environment with everything setup, I don't want the importer to create anything new.

Context\r\nWhen using JQL with auto-complete switched on, searching for fields will always list global values. For instance, when using the IN operator in JQL, auto-complete will \"give away\" values for the majority of fields. Given that for each individual project there are schemes restricting or limiting the available fields, only context-specific values should be accessible for the user.\r\nThe current behaviour seems to be potentially problematic with regard to usability or security concerns.\r\n\r\nh4. Objective\r\nAs a user, I want the auto-complete function to only present field values relevant for my context.\r\n\r\nWith \"my context\" meaning:\r\n# Projects, I have permission to browse; or \r\n# Values for fields that are configured/enabled via a scheme configuration for that project.\r\n\r\n_In other words: the behaviour and underlying logic of JIRA's JQL search capabilities should respect project configuration and permissions to not reveal global field values._\r\n\r\nh4. Steps to reproduce\r\n# Create a user that has access only to one particular project.\r\n# Configure the project in the following way:\r\n## A basic workflow (eg. only with three statuses TODO, DOING, DONE).\r\n## No Custom Fields used on any screen or any scheme;\r\n# In JIRA, browse to \"Search for issues\" in Advanced mode and try the following:\r\n## status IN (\r\n -> Auto-complete will display a preview of all existing statuses (in addition to our three).\r\n## project IN (\"My Project\") AND\r\n -> A preview of globally existing custom fields will be displayed.\r\n\r\nOther fields which are affected by the described behaviour as well are:\r\n* Issue Type \r\n* Status\r\n* Assignee\r\n* Resolution\r\n* Component\r\n* FixVersion\r\n* Custom Fields\r\n\r\nh4.

Impact\r\n\r\nIf they are just buttons in the topnav - nothing except duplicated ids in HTML. But if they were drop-downs then they would be clashing with each other showing inappropriate content for those drop-downs.\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nThe technical solution also disallow to create drop-down items with non-unique ids. \r\n\r\nThere are few possible solutions. The best one would be namespacing those IDs with plugin's key. \r\n\r\nThere are possible dependencies on those id's (which eventually are printed out to HTML) that would need fixing. For example, Plugin vendors (and JIRA Core) may use those IDs to bind javascript actions and styling.\r\n\r\nConsequently, fixing this only seems to be viable in a breaking release (7.0 for instance)",
