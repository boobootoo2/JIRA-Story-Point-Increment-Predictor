Instead of allowing and later the instance crashes everytime the issue is loaded.\r\nIn case of avatar picker JIRA should reject request informing user that image is too big and that smaller image should be used.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to replicate\r\n\r\n# Get a huge dimension picture file (Eg, 2988 x 5312) \r\n# Upload it as an avatar\r\n# High possibility the instance will run into OOME\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Result\r\n\r\nTo have warning telling that image is too big, or alternatively, drop the thumbnail rendering for the file with error message.\r\n\r\nh3.

If the reviewer does not approve the pull request, he declines the pull request and JIRA transitions the issue back to \"In Progress\".\r\n\r\nSince an issue can only be assigned to a single user, the assignee can only be set to a reviewer if there is only one. I suggest that you add the following post functions that can only be used if Stash is linked to JIRA:\r\n\r\n- Assign to single reviewer (keep assignee for multiple reviewers)\r\n- Assign to pull request creator\r\n- Remove assignee (could be used for multiple reviewer scenarios)",

It would be nice if I could build a list of Persona's that are relevant to my project (or refine for an Epic?) so I can flesh out their details/traits/perspective of them (could be mostly free text description, a name, title and graphic), and then tie the available persona(s) to my user stories. This way when developers are completing the work related to the story they can have a solid understanding of the individual trying to do this task. To assist with project planning, it could be useful to narrow down the work that is going to be performed by focusing on a specific set of user persona's (and thus related tasks), and gradually re-introduce the other persona's in later releases of the product. This could be delivered in a method similar to the Agile \"Columns\"",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-40014].\n  {panel}\n\nWe are using ServiceRocket's SF & JIRA Cloud connector that links SF cases to JIRA issues (objects). Since the JIRA value limit for the custom field value holds maximum of 255 characters, the unique IDs generated from the linkage sums up to about 13 linkages max total. However, there are instances where there are more than 13 SF cases linked/associated to 1 JIRA ticket, this creates problems. One of the problem being that the latter links replace the older ones. Also, only actively linked SF cases to that 1 JIRA ticket get automatically synched. This causes the other inactive linked SF cases to reflect the wrong status or data - causing reporting and metric inefficiencies and inaccuracies.\r\n\r\nHere is what was suggested instructions by the Servicerocket Support rep:\r\n\"The Remote System Reference is using Salesforce Object ID and stored in JIRA database (STRINGVALUE column in CUSTOMFIELDVALUE table). The STRINGVALUE is 'VARCHAR2(255 CHAR)' so it only can store up to 13 Salesforce Object Id. \"\r\n",

It would be helpful if this page also provided the reminder that the permission scheme is shared by multiple projects.  Since this is a different page altogether, it is easy to forget that the changes you are making applies to more projects than just the one you are altering it for.  I made the mistake today of modifying permission scheme for one project, but it affected 20 projects.  I had to go back and put everything back the way it was, then copy the scheme, then modify it.
