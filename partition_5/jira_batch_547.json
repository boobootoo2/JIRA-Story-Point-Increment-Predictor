Read more about it\u00a0[here|https://confluence.atlassian.com/servicedeskcloud/blog/2017/05/translate-your-customer-portal].\u00a0\r\n\r\nThanks again for your help in tackling this problem.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nJIRA Service Desk Team\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n{panel:title=Atlassian update as of 16th November 2016}\r\n{panel}\r\nHi all,\r\n\r\nThanks for all your comments. There's certainly strong\u00a0interest behind this.\r\n\r\nWe would love to hear more from you on how your team shall add and maintain multiple languages on the portal. Understanding this will help us make the right thing that fits your needs perfectly.\r\n\r\nIf you would like to help out, please take 2 minutes to answer these questions - [https://jsd-beta.typeform.com/to/VS5QKT].\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nJIRA Service Desk Team\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n----\r\nh3. Summary\r\n\r\nIf a JIRA Service Desk is created while the Default Language is set to a certain language, the customer portal will keep this language for the _workflow step_ and _why do you need this?_ text on the customer portal even after changing it to a different language.\r\nh3. Environment\r\n\r\nI have tested this behavior with the following:\r\n * JIRA 6.4.5\r\n * JIRA Service Desk 2.4.2\r\n\r\n * JIRA Service Desk-2.5.0-OD-02-002-D20150506T043445-language-pack-de_DE.jar\r\n * JIRA Service Desk-2.5.0-OD-02-002-D20150506T043445-language-pack-es_ES.jar\r\n\r\n * JIRA-6.4.5-language-pack-de_DE.jar\r\n * JIRA-6.4.5-language-pack-es_ES.jar\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Install the German (de_DE) language pack files for JIRA and JIRA Service Desk on your test instance.\r\n # Change Default language to _Deutsch (Deutschland)_\r\n # Create a new JIRA Service Desk\r\n # Create an issue\r\n # Install the Spanish (es_ES) language pack files for JIRA and JIRA Service Desk on your test instance.\r\n # Change Default language to _espa\u00f1ol (Espa\u00f1a)_\r\n # Go to the customer portal\r\n # Go to _My Requests_\r\n # Click on the issue you had created earlier\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nThe expected result would be that the Customer Portal translates all the fields according to the selected language.\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nThe customer portal keeps the translations of the language it was created in for the following:\r\n * _Workflow Step_\r\n * _Why do you need this?_ text\r\n !not_changed.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nh3. Notes\r\n * If this is done with a language that does not have all the values translated those texts will also show up in the language the Service Desk was created in.\r\n * This issue occurs when the user profile language is different from the one the JIRA Service Desk was created in.\r\n * Even if the system default language is in english, and the user profile language is Spanish, these two pieces of text still are presented in German.\r\n * I have also verified that these 2 missing pieces of text are in fact present in bot the Spanish and German language pack:\r\n !PACK2.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nCreate the JIRA Service Desk in the language that you intend to use it in.\r\n (this might present a problem if the user profile language differs per user)",

Problem Definition\nAt the moment, only comments made in the Customer Portal view are recognised as coming from the customer. This means, for example, that automation rules can only be triggered from there.\n\nThe Reporter may have access to the same issue in base JIRA view (if they have Collaborator permissions), but at an attempt to comment there, they'll see a warning:\n{quote}Your comment will only be visible to agents and collaborators{quote}  \n\n\n- This is in accordance with the Service Desk logic, but can be confusing: users wouldn't expect completely different behaviour when accessing the same ticket in two different parts of the application.\n- Teams that work with internal requesters don't always want to use the Customer Portal. For users that are used to JIRA views, this adds additional overhead of having navigate to Customer Portal in order to add a comment.\n\nh3. Suggested Solution\nIn the JIRA view, reporters should have an option to add a comment as a Service Desk customer.",

Currently you only see an Agent's identity if they log a Comment. Is it possible to get the Assignee shown under the \"People Involved\" section - and have this as turn off and on-able for clients to choose to use? We have no power of showing this info at present and it is a negative feature of the tool.\n\nRegards\nJp",

Problem Definition\nCurrently, on the customer portal login screen, the option to login using either Google Apps or Service Desk / JIRA credentials is present. This can lead to confusion for service desk portal customers, as they might believe that they are able to log in using google credentials (which only service desk agents can use that option), and that will not work.\n\nh3.

You only need to create one status for each unique \"newvalue\"\n# Create the status in the JIRA Administration page\n# After creating the status, hover over the edit link for the new status to obtain the URL for this link. Copy down the ID that appears at the end of this URL.\n# Shut down JIRA\n# Update the issuestatus table so that the newly created status has the ID of the deleted status. \n** Run the following query. Replace the first ID with the ID you obtained from the URL when you added the status. Replace the second ID with the missing status ID that you obtained in the first SQL query.\n{noformat}\nUPDATE issuestatus SET id='10200' WHERE id='10610';\n{noformat}\n# Start JIRA",

However, my clients are independent companies and as such each want a quarterly SLA report based on how we did for their own issues. e.g. 45 clients whose metrics would fall into the SLA specs, while 5 having SLA violations that quarter.\n\nFor this I would need a way of easily grouping the individual customer-accounts into clients, so I could introduce a JQL for each of the reports filtering on the client (reporter in membersOf(\"client\"). Or a grouping on emaildomains could also fit the bill (reporter_email in (\"@client.com\", \"@client.co.uk\", \"@client.net\"))\n\nOur users are typically entered by ourselves (no self-registration).\n\nApparently users-groups have been switched off for SD customers as this did not match the licensing policy.",

I have read documentation, faqs, googled etc. but my three days experience does not pull out an answer to my questions.\n\nI want external customers to have possibility to send and receive email to/from system. So far I haven't figured out how to get emails going to (again external)customers from our pre-defined email address sent by Jira SD system. Incoming mail works as expected. There's no option to configure outgoing mail server. Why? \n\nI do not care what is the way to solve this inside your cloud but it is a show stopper for us if it is not possible.\n\nBest Regards,\n\nKimmo H\u00e4yrinen",

Add the user to the Service Desk Agents group, and go back to JIRA.  The pages should load, now.  You can then remove the user from the Service Desk Agents group.\n\n*JIRA Server*\nApparently, this bug only affects users during their first login. \nIf this problem is affecting all users (including the JIRA System Administrator), follow the steps below:\n# Stop JIRA.\n# Remove the JIRA Service Desk OBR plugin file from the {{$JIRA_HOME/plugins/installed-plugins}} folder.\n# Start JIRA.\n# Login to JIRA and install the JIRA Service Desk plugin again.\n\nIf an administrator already has access to the instance, follow the steps below:\n# Login as a JIRA System Administrator.\n# Go to *Cog Icon > Add-ons > JIRA Service Desk*.\n# Expand the list of modules (e.g. * 244 of 244 modules enabled*).\n# Find the *sdOnboardingFlow* module and click on *Disable*.",

Environment\n\nThe only occurs on IE11.\n\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\n\nI reproduced this bug on atlassian_jira_6_4_branch (6.4.2). You need to install service desk plugin in order to reproduce it. \n\n# Start JIRA instance and install service desk plugin\n# Create a service desk project and create several issues \n# Launch IE11\n# Press {{F12}} to launch F12 - the IE dev toolkit\n# Click {{Issues}} -> {{Search for issues}}\n# Select first issue\n# Select any other issue\n# Resume debugger via {{F8}} if it is paused\n# Notice that the selected issue is successfully selected\n# Select yet another issue\n\nh3. Expected Results\nThe details of the issue selected in step #7 should be rendered.\nNo unhandled exceptions.\n\nh3. Actual Results\nThe details of the issue selected in step #4 is rendered.\nAn unhandled exception after step #4: {{Unable to get property 'removeChild' of undefined or null reference}} at a {{j.parentNode.removeChild(j)}} from {{batch.js:149:394}}\nLike in attachment !Screen Shot 2015-04-15 at 6.14.02 PM.png|thumbnail!

Summary\nWhen an _issue_updated_ webhook event is triggered by an action in Customer Portal, the posted JSON misses the 'changelog' node.\n\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\n# Set up a webhook to be triggered at 'Issue updated' event, and with a JQL covering a project with Service Desk enabled. \n# In Customer Portal view of an issue covered by the webhook's JQL, add an attachment, with or without a comment.\n# Observe the JSON posted at the issue update.\n\nh3. Expected Results\nThe POST body includes the 'changelog' node with the information about new attachment:\n{code}\"changelog\": {\n    \"id\": \"11111\",\n    \"items\": [\n      {\n        \"field\": \"Attachment\",\n        \"fieldtype\": \"jira\",\n        \"from\": null,\n        \"fromString\": null,\n        \"to\": \"11111\",\n        \"toString\": \"image.png\"\n      }{code}\n\nh3. Actual Results\nThe POST is missing the 'changelog' details, only the information about the new comment is distinguished. \nThey 'changelog' information is only included in POSTs triggered by actions in JIRA Issue View or Service Desk agent views.\n \nh3. Notes\nTo see the details of Webhooks posts in JIRA logs: in *JIRA Admin > System > Logging & Profiling* add the package _com.atlassian.webhooks_ witht the DEBUG level of logging.",

Also, some users create ServiceDesk mail handlers in JIRA core side which can cause issues.\n\nh3. Suggested Solution\nWe need to have all mail handlers including Service Desk in one page to have better view of incoming mail handlers.\nOtherwise to check for Service Desk mail handlers we need to check every Service Desk project Email Setting separately which makes troubleshooting difficult.\nHowever, since Service Desk mail handler is independent from JIRA core, it is good to JUST show the mail handler at Incoming Mail page, but user won't be able to edit SD mail handler or CREATE Service Desk mail handler which makes duplication and leave it as read only.",

Summary\r\nWhen a user is typing comments in JIRA Service Desk, and subsequently goes on to assign an Assignee without saving the comment, the comment is lost. This does not happen in JIRA and is only replicable in JIRA Service Desk.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Go to an open JIRA Service Desk issue as an agent\r\n# Start typing a comment in the Comments tab and do not submit\r\n# Click on the Assignee field and change the assignee\r\n# The comment is lost\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nThe comment is not lost when assigning a user in the middle of typing a comment. This behavior is already in JIRA as this issue cannot be replicated there.\r\n\r\nh3. Notes\r\n\r\nThis behavior is also reproducible when adding labels, attachments(through control+v or drag and drop), Organizations, Request participants and so on. Basically, the comment will be lost in almost every \"update\" action on the issue.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nThe comment disappears when a new user is assigned and all work is lost (especially if its a lengthy comment)\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nThis bug should only be reproducible when accessing the issues from the queues page:\r\n{noformat}\r\nhttps://{instance}.atlassian.net/projects/{pkey}/queues/custom/1/{issue-key}\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nOr from a JQL search:\r\n{noformat}\r\nhttps://{instance}.atlassian.net/browse/{pkey}?jql=project%20%3D%20RA\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\n\r\nBut if you access the issue directly in JIRA:\r\n{noformat}\r\nhttps://{instance}.atlassian.net/browse/{Issue-key}\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nThe bug should not be reproducible.",

Steps to Reproduce\n# Create a Service Desk with default settings.\n# Add a few customers to the Service Desk, and let them create a few issues in the Customer Portal\n# Edit the Service Desk project's permission scheme so that \"Service Desk Customer - Portal Access\" security type is removed from the Create Issues permission.\n\nh3. Expected Results\nCustomers can no longer create new issues, but can still see existing issues they have reported.\n\nh3. Actual Results\n* Customer portal disappears from help center list when viewed by customer.\n* Customers can no longer see their previously reported open issues in the Customer Portal. Ofcourse as expected they are also unable to create new requests.\n* My Requests section in Customer Portal doesn't show any issues reported by the Customer.\n\nh3.

[See the corresponding bug report|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSDSERVER-1802].\n  {panel}\n\nI have a situation, where we use Active Directory to manage users and JIRA is connected to it. There are 2 users with the same e-mail in that Active Directory, where one of the users has JSD permissions and the other does not. When I try to add as participant the user that has permissions from the Customer Portal \"Add People\" function, I write his name, which is found, but when adding it it says \"Error, cannot add this e-mail .....\". If I add him as participant from within the issue in JSD backend, it works. The problem seem to be that Jira Service Desk is looking by e-mail when adding from the Customer Portal and finds the other user, which does not have permissions, although his username is different than what I write in the text box. When I changed the e-mail of the other user, I can add the user that has permissions without a problem.",
