Summary\r\nIf you start by viewing Project A and attempt to create an issue in Project A, the default priority that is specified in the priority scheme is enforced correctly, and vice-versa for viewing Project B and attempting to create an issue in Project B.  But, if you have a Default Priority scheme set on the two different projects and create an issue while in project A then switch to project B while on the create issue screen the Default priority from project A is applied to the issue being created in project B, and The priority scheme for project B is ignored.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Create 2 projects\r\n# Create 2 Priority Schemes \r\n#* associate each scheme to one of the projects\r\n#* Set Highest priority as default on one and lowest on the other EXE:\r\n!Screen Shot 2018-09-26 at 11.45.02 AM.png|thumbnail!\r\n# Navigate to Project A and select Create to trigger create issue screen Note the Default priority is set to Lowest:\r\n!Screen Shot 2018-09-26 at 12.01.24 PM.png|thumbnail!\r\n# Use the project drop down to Switch to Project B\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nDefault Priority is set to the Default value per the scheme\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nThe Default value from Project A is left behind, in the EXE priority should be Highest but is set to Lowest:\r\n!Screen Shot 2018-09-26 at 12.00.05 PM.png|thumbnail!\r\n \r\nh3. Notes\r\n- Navigate to project B and create an issue the value will be set to project B's default value\r\n- This seems to happen in the Create Issue popup only. \r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n- Manual verification is the only current validation method\r\n- Under some circumstances where this has to be avoided completely, we can disable the Create Issue popup by following this KB: [How to disable Create Issue popup|https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirakb/how-to-disable-create-issue-popup-300813780.html]. The method, \"Disable via Javascript\" is the easiest to apply in this case where it will force the issue creation in a full page instead of a popup. \r\n",

Summary\r\nPlugins/apps with expired maintenance terms can still be updated to newer versions.\r\n\r\nAfter investigation (on Jira 7.5 and latest UPM version), we\u2019ve got to the conclusion that Jira caches the status of the licenses and does not clear this cache when add-ons are upgraded/disabled/enabled.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\nGiven:\r\n* Version A of our add-on, released on 2017-07-07\r\n* A commercial license with support expiring on 2017-08-26\r\n* Version B of our add-on, released on 2017-11-17\r\n\r\n# install version A of the add-on\r\n# apply the commercial license: add-on works correctly (OK)\r\n# upgrade the add-on to the version B: add-on still works correctly  (NOK. The license maintenance expired before the release of version B, there should have been an error LicenseError.VERSION_MISMATCH)\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nThe license maintenance expired before the release of version B, there should have been an error {{LicenseError.VERSION_MISMATCH}}. (See [docs|https://developer.atlassian.com/platform/marketplace/server-app-license-validation-rules/])\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nYou can upgrade the app even if the maintenance of you license has expired and the new version of the app has been released after the maintenance expiration date.\r\n\r\nh3. Notes\r\n* If we simply disable/enable the add-on, then the license works as if it was valid (cache not cleared, pluginLicense.isValid() returns true) and this is not ok.\r\n* If we restart the Jira instance, then Jira detects the invalid license and everything is handled correctly (meaning the add-on does not work anymore, pluginLicense.isValid() returns false).\r\n* Or, if in our add-on we do, during startup:\r\neventPublisher.publish(new ClearCacheEvent(Collections.emptyMap()));\r\nall the caches are cleared and the add-on detects correctly that the license is invalid (pluginLicense.isValid() returns false).\r\n\r\nI believe every marketplace vendor uses the same api for license check. The way this work I believe it's possible to upgrade any add-on even if the maintenance is expired and the release date of the new version is after the maintenance expiration date. So I think this impacts all the server vendors.\r\n\r\nWe have also reported this on the developer community: https://community.developer.atlassian.com/t/jira-license-licensemanager-cache-is-not-cleared-when-the-add-ons-are-upgraded-disabled-enabled/13372\r\n\r\n",

Problem Definition\r\n\r\nIf a project contains many versions (over 3000), with many statuses associated with the project's workflow (over 100), the loading time of the Releases page becomes significantly slower.

Those other projects (not the one that were changed) could be reverted to the default issue type scheme during the change due to race condition. \r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Generate 2000 projects.\r\n# Create a new issue type scheme, call it '_ITS A_'.\r\n# Associate 1800 projects with the newly created issue type scheme '_ITS A_'.\r\n# Jot down the number of total projects associated with the default issue type scheme (it should be 200).\r\n# Update two of the projects associated with the default issue type scheme before with the newly created issue type scheme _'ITS A_' *simultaneously* via *Project settings* > *Issue types* > *Actions* > *Use a different scheme*.\r\n#* (i) You might need another user to do this with you at the same time.\r\n#* Example screenshot\r\n !Change_ITS.png|thumbnail! \r\n# Review the number of total projects associated with the default issue type scheme.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nThe number of total projects associated with the default issue type scheme is _reduced_ by 2.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nThe number of total projects associated with the default issue type scheme _increases_ by random number (more then 200).\r\nEnabling _DEBUG_ logging for {{com.atlassian.jira.issue.context.persistence}} will show number of deleted rows, snippet from atlassian-jira.log file:\r\n{noformat}\r\n2018-01-11 17:24:51,050 http-nio-8081-exec-13 DEBUG admin 1044x992x1 1mxuaim 127.0.0.1 /secure/admin/SelectIssueTypeSchemeForProject.jspa [c.a.j.i.context.persistence.FieldConfigContextPersisterWorker] 1 contexts deleted for field config scheme with id '11500'\r\n2018-01-11 17:26:41,157 http-nio-8081-exec-13 DEBUG admin 1046x1017x1 1mxuaim 127.0.0.1 /secure/admin/SelectIssueTypeSchemeForProject.jspa [c.a.j.i.context.persistence.FieldConfigContextPersisterWorker] 0 contexts deleted for field config scheme with id '11700'\r\n{noformat}\r\n \r\nh3.

Action for data recovery \r\n* In simple scenario you can reassign corresponding _IssueTypeSchema_ (ITS) to affected projects \r\n* In case of large number projects affected, usually the list it's not that obvious. You will need JIRA DB backup (or staging copy). \r\n** You will need a couple of tables (_configurationcontext_, _project_, _fieldconfigscheme_) and run the following SQL to get the mapping list:\r\n{code:borderStyle=solid}\r\nselect p.id as PID,p.pname as ProjectName,cc.fieldconfigscheme as ITS_ID,fcs.configname as ITS_Name from configurationcontext cc,project p,fieldconfigscheme fcs where cc.customfield = 'issuetype' and p.id=cc.project and fcs.id=cc.fieldconfigscheme;\r\n  pid  |    projectname     | its_id |                   its_name\r\n-------+--------------------+--------+----------------------------------------------\r\n 10001 | Dragons            |  10101 | DRA: Simple Issue Tracking Issue Type Scheme\r\n 10100 | PRG                |  10300 | PRG: Simple Issue Tracking Issue Type Scheme\r\n 10300 | Agile-Project      |  10805 | AG: Scrum Issue Type Scheme\r\n{code}",

Basically we have the behavior when searching as a user: the JQL using *resolution = Unresolved* will prioritize searching for issues without a resolution. On the other hand, when gadgets use the filter with *resolution = Unresolved* they will actually search prioritizing issues with a resolution with the value 'Unresolved' rather than not having a resolution set and when a user clicks in a link that redirects to the issue navigator, the 'JQL for user' behavior kicks in, showing a different number of issues than what the number in the gadgets indicates.",

      "description": "h3. Problem Definition\r\nSee related ticket: JRASERVER-64974 \r\nJIRA Datacenter (JDC) uses Ehcache as caching technology, cache server which exposes available cache operations remotely through RMI. Ehcache requires two ports for it's network operations:\r\n* port - a port in the range 1025 - 65536\r\n* remoteObjectPort - the port number on which the remote objects bound in the registry receive calls. This defaults to a free port if not specified.\r\n\r\nCurrently in JDC (7.3+) you can specify:\r\n*  *port* (default = 40001, setting: ehcache.listener.port), see [Cluster.properties file parameters|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Installing+JIRA+Data+Center#InstallingJIRADataCenter-Security]\r\n* *remoteObjectPort* (default = _dynamic_, setting: ehcache.object.port)\r\n\r\nSo by default *remoteObjectPort* is dynamically allocated and [TCP ephemeral port|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ephemeral_port] is selected. So you need to open wide range of ports at firewall. \r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\nSet *ehcache.object.port* by default to 40011\r\n\r\nh3. Implemented \r\nIn the fixed version, it's required to open two ports for each node (see JRASERVER-68652)\r\n* Ehcache port default _40001_\r\n* Object port default _40011_\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround \r\nSet *ehcache.object.port* manually\r\n{panel:title=cluster.properties}\r\n...\r\nehcache.object.port = 40011\r\n{panel}\r\n",

Summary\r\n\r\nJIRA DC might lose cluster lock while trying to unlock the lock if there is database connectivity problems .\r\n\r\nThat makes whole cluster stuck for some operations/actions that needs that lock.\r\n Specifically we saw problem with:\r\n * {{com.atlassian.jira.config.DefaultReindexMessageManager.messageLock}} lock\r\n * {{com.atlassian.upm.impl.PluginManagerPluginAsynchronousTaskStatusStoreImpl}} lock\r\n * {{NotificationBatchScheduler.sd_batch_sending_lock}} lock\r\n * {{sla_issue_update_xx}} lock\r\n * the Service Desk Mail Puller job {{com.atlassian.jira.internal.mail.services.MailPullerJobRunner}}\r\n\r\nSo there is a possible chain of events:\r\n # Node1 obtains the lock in *thread1*\r\n ** Node1 registers it in DB and internal JVM structure.\r\n # All other nodes see lock and wait\r\n ** *Thread1* unlocks the lock. While updating db it fails and release only local ref lock\r\n # All other nodes see lock and wait\r\n # Lock check at Node1 see that local ref is NULL and DB lock is present, so does nothing\r\n # All stuck\r\n\r\nh3. Environment\r\n * JIRA Datacenter\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Set up a Datacenter JIRA instance with 2 nodes\r\n # Initiate action that would obtain the lock\r\n # Break connection to the database while this node has a clusterlock and tries to unlock it\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nJIRA will recover and do the unlock query once connected back to the database\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nJIRA DC lost the cluster lock.

Normally you can check this by navigating to *Cluster Locks* check [ System > Support Tools > Instance health > Cluster Locks ].

Suggested Solution\r\nCreate separate Cluster Status space which:\r\n* will not use any lock to access it\r\n* will show _all current Cluster locks_ with following data:\r\n** Lock name - Node - Age\r\n* (Advanced) will be able to break/steal Cluster lock \r\n\r\nh3.

      "description": "h3. Summary\r\n\r\n*Background:*\r\n JIRA maintains a cache of users in Lucene in-memory index. One example of where this is used is user picker fields, including the assignee field.\r\n * This cache was introduced in JIRA 7.2.0 (see JRASERVER-65126).\r\n\r\nSearching for a user in the user picker field causes JIRA to search the cache. Users not present in this cache will not be returned by the search even if they are active users that have the appropriate permissions.\r\n\r\n*Problem:*\r\n JIRA does not add users to the cache when an external directory is enabled. JIRA does add users to the cache during startup but does not add users that are in disabled directories.\r\n * A directory that is disabled during startup will not work properly when enabled. Users will not be added to the cache and as a result will not appear in user pickers.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Install JIRA 7.2.0 or newer\r\n # Connect to external directory containing users\r\n # Create sample business project\r\n # Attempt to assign issue to one of the users in the external directory\r\n ** Observe: Assignee search works and shows the users\r\n # Disable directory\r\n # Restart JIRA\r\n # Enable directory\r\n # Attempt to assign issue to one of the users in the external directory\r\n ** Observe: None of the external users appear in the search\r\n ** Observe: Typing the entire username and clicking outside of the box will cause issue to be assigned as expected.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nUsers are cached and user pickers show correct results\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nUsers not cached and as a result users do not appear in user picker after directory is enabled\r\nh3. Notes\r\n\r\n*Behavior Notes:*\r\n * Users are able to log into JIRA. After logging into JIRA they will show in the user picker as expected.\r\n * User pickers can still be used but the username must be entered as the users cannot be searched for\r\n * This behavior will also impact\u00a0JIRA Service Desk user fields, such as the Request Participants field\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\n*Recommended workaround:*\r\n* Restart JIRA with external directory enabled\r\n\r\n*Alternate workaround:*\r\n* Create new user directory then delete that new directory. \r\n** The act of deleting a directory will cause related caches to be reset.\r\n* The directory does not need to function. \r\n** Create new directory, fill out required fields. Click \"Save and Test\" once to get connection error, click again to save the config. \r\n** After that disable the new directory then delete it.\r\n\u00a0",
