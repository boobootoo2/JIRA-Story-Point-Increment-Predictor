This will occur if a JIRA Service Desk project is deleted while JIRA Service Desk is deactivated/unlicensed because portals for the project are not fully removed from the database. Later, if we re-license JSD and try to create a project with the same key, the failure will occur.\r\nh1. Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Create a new service desk project called 'Support'\r\n 2. Update your license to only have JIRA Core (i.e. deactivate\u00a0Service Desk)\r\n 3. Delete the 'Support' project\r\n 4. Delete all of the issue types that came from service desk (IT Help, Service Request, Service Request with Approvals, possibly others depending on project template)\r\n 5. Update your license to include service desk again\r\n 6. Create a new project 'Support' (it just needs to have the same project key as the original project)\r\n 7. Creating the project will fail, if you check the logs you will get the stacktrace with the Postgres exception below\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nYou can check the all events on Splunk

Workaround\r\n\r\n-This issue is caused by upgrade tasks in Service Desk for JIRA Server 3.3.0 not having corresponding downgrade tasks.- The workaround is to run the following query in JIRA Server's database (take a database backup first) then immediately run another export. If JIRA is restarted in between the SQL command and taking the backup, the upgrade tasks are re-run again and this process needs to be repeated.\r\n{code:sql}\r\nDELETE FROM upgradetaskhistory WHERE upgrade_task_factory_key = 'com.atlassian.servicedesk';\r\n{code}\r\nThis will be fixed in an upcoming release of Service Desk Cloud.",

Expected Results\r\nThe number of issues for the month should for the calendar month. For example, March should return back all the results from March.

Actual Results\r\nIssues from February are included in March on the drilled down data, instead of 3 issues being shown 4 are displayed.\r\n \r\nh3. Notes\r\nWhen using month this results in something like:\r\nFebruary 2017 is selected\r\nPeriod calculated as March 2016 - February 2017\r\nWhen calculating from this the start and end date for only February it uses the interval duration from first month, which is March.\r\nThe problem is that March has more days than February, so it comes up with a period overflowing into March.\r\nThe problem is even worse for January, as the code somehow calculated 1 December to 1 30 January as the period, since January has 31 days so it ends up in November before flattening that to the start of the month \r\n\r\nh3.Workaround\r\nNo workaround.",
