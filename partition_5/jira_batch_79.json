Hiding it in a drop-down list not only makes discovering and toggling the current state of this option a pain, but hides its existence from the mind of the user (out of sight, out of mind).  If I'm looking over my coworker's shoulder at a diff, I can't tell if whitespace is being ignored or not.\r\n\r\nA similar issue is with the \"Amend commit\" option.  If this option is chosen in the drop-down list and then the commit is canceled, next time the user goes to commit they may not realize that they are actually amending (since the status of that option is hidden).\r\n\r\nI know there's this insidious design trend right now to make everything \"clean\" by removing and hiding things.  While that might work for uncommon or unimportant options (such as sort order or number of lines of context), the value of important states should be discernible at a glance.\r\n\r\nThanks.",

      "description": "I have recently installed the latest 1.6.1 version to replace 1.5.2, but there are several problems with the new file view.\r\n\r\n* There is no indication that work is happening when changing the 'Show only' checkbox. The combo shows the new value, but for a while the data in the grid is stale, with no indication that the application is doing something.\r\nThis doesn't apply when changing 'Sort by', but only as that seems to block the dispatcher thread and leave the context menu up until the work is complete.\r\n\r\n* Sorting via a dropdown doesn't work. When viewing all files sorted by file status any modified files appear at the bottom in the unstaged files view. I then I have to scroll through thousands of files to see the ones I am interested in and I have no way of changing this as the sort options are restricted by what is available in the drop down.\r\nIn the old version the unchanged files appeared below the others.\r\n\r\n* Double clicking on a column header in the grid opens the first file. I suspect this one could be the same underlying source as: https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/SRCTREEWIN-1910\r\n\r\n* Changing the view between 'No Staging' 'Fluid Staging' and 'Split View Staging' blocks the dispatcher thread and the UI becomes completely unresponsive until the operation comples, which can take a very long time if viewing all files.\r\n\r\n* On startup the file view defaults to showing no files, so I have to manually select one of the 'Show only' options",
