It takes up unnecessary space in the log file, like having debugging turned on full.\r\n2. It confuses customers when not viewed at full width - it really does look like line noise in an 80 char terminal.\r\n3. Surely, a marketing slogan doesn't belong in a log file\r\n4. It makes it look like no-one is leading the product from the helm. Why not add some flashing color to it too? A few pretty pictures of the developers, perhaps? \r\n\r\nGuys, if you're bored of just adding fixes, please do something both creative and useful.\r\n\r\n~Matt",

In this way the chart will be always up to date without any need of user intervention.\r\n\r\nI think it would be a major improvement to the functionality of this chart.",

      "description": "Hello, \r\n\r\n We have recently upgraded from 4.0.1 to 4.1.1. However, We surprisingly came accross that the issue screen has been changed irreversibly. As we have searched in the forums, There is no backward compatibility. Since we are using Jira enterprise-wide, major changes affect employees. Upon this, we needed to downgrade. We have run this version for about 1 to 2 hours. There have been work of employees on the new version of jira. Even though we had backups of the old version, we did not want to lose the activities since the upgrade. However, it is not possible to downgrade with the database (data) of jira 4.1.1 to Jira 4.0.1. Because there is a version check. I have checked whether there is a major database structure change, fortunately, not. I edited the propertystring table to make db and application compitable with eachother. I eventually managed to run old version of jira with new version of db (without losing the works of employees).\r\n\r\nI want to inform Atlassian that these kind of changes should not be made instantly. Now, we are in desicion not to use 4.1.1 for such a long time since the cost of coping with complaints is much more than compared to using old version. We try to look at major changes between versions, but we usually get lost on the documentation pages. We want to get informed kindly if there is any chance to use \"old version\" of issue screen with new version of jira 4.1.1. One further suggession, you should use warning mechanism, in previous versions, which informs customers that there will be changes in some of features in next releases. For example, you should be warning about the issue screen change starting from version 4.0. Again, you may offer that \"Please use a test environment, install new version there, use it, like it, then upgrade\". However, as I mentioned above by saying \"irreversibly\" , at least you should leave, as one of the forum commenters said, a legacy theme and let the customer decide whether to use new theme or not. \r\n",

This would be on a per-project basis, so they's only get added to the specific project and only if that project is configured to accept auto-enrollment.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, upon creating a new user account, the user could be presented with a list of projects, they tick the ones they want access to and then they are either added automatically, or the project manager is emailed a notification to add the user to the project.",

This is in IE only (version 8). It worked fine in JIRA 4.0, and it also works fine in FF with JIRA 4.1.\r\n\r\nWhen debugging, the error is coming from a file called ajs.js, which must be part of the JIRA installation.{quote}\r\n\r\nI've been able to validate this on a local test system.  In JIRA 4.0, there are no errors in IE8.  In JIRA 4.1, the Javascript error appears.  This is using the same plugin JAR file.\r\n\r\nJohn has also been kind enough to provide a simple test Issue tab plugin that attempts to display Wikipedia in an iframe, which I have attached to this issue.

It shows up as \"iFrame Test\" in admin.\r\n* open JIRA in Internet Explorer 8.\r\n* Go to any issue and click the \"iFrame Tab Panel\" tab.\r\n* You should get a javascript error.{quote}\r\n\r\nJohn initially created [this|http://forums.atlassian.com/thread.jspa?messageID=257341600&tstart=0] forum post to resolve his issue but received no responses.",

It can just be added to the list and the wording changed to say \"the following charts do not come bundled with 4.0\", instead of \"the following three charts do not come bundled\". That's not the exacting wording, but basically removing the reference to three charts and have it be more generic seems like it may be helpful. I'm not sure if there are other charts that are missing, but if there are then we wouldn't need to keep updating the doc if additional charts are found to be missing. \r\n\r\nI would have made the changes myself, but there are some restrictions on the page and I can't. Hope this helps, let me know if there are any questions.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\n\r\nAdam G.

      "description": "In 4.1.1, the ability to reorder transition steps was added, per JRA-5789.  The method to do so is to add a property to each step called \"opsbar-sequence\" - the integer values of this property define the order in which the steps will appear.\r\n\r\nWhile this DOES work, it definitely seems like the \"cheap way\" out, and is not easy to use.  The workflow editor does not display items in this order, so from here you have no idea if the order is correct.  Only (?) by publishing and going to an issue in the appropriate step can you confirm the ordering.\r\n\r\nIt would be MUCH more usable to either have a \"drag-and-drop\" (as was mentioned in the other issue after it was released), or maybe even simply some \"up and down\" arrows that allow me to reorder the steps.  A button to sort the list alphabetically (or reverse alphabetically) would probably also be useful for some users.\r\n\r\nWhy should I care what some arbitrary integer value is of the step after the one I'm interested?  To the user, that does not matter and gets complicated very quickly - especially if there are a decent number of transition steps involved.  What matters is that I want step A to appear after step B - that's all.  If JIRA wants to assign arbitrary integers based on how I order them in the UI, so be it.  But that is an internal implementation detail, not something to be exposed to the user.",
