I've had to disable this great functionality.  For an IE user, he/she would try to drag a file on the \"hotspot\" and be prompted to open the file.  This is, of course, not the desired result and very confusing.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you need any more detail.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nSteve",

After saving and editing it again, the values entered will reflect the correct timezone value from the user's side.\r\n\r\nNow this is of course an expected behavior since the date time picker format will follow the server date. The argument that we have here is that imagine if the instance has users from all over the world, different time zones. What will happen if the *Date Time Picker* format is overridden every time from the user's side due to different time zones? This will cause inaccuracy in terms of data.\r\n\r\nHOWEVER, (here comes the interesting part) what if the *Date Time Picker* is seen as the right format from the user's perspective of time zone BUT from the server side, it still is standardized? This can be very helpful for users who rely on this for time tracking certain issues. This means that *JIRA* is dynamic and smart to detect the time zone from the *User Profile* directly & show the right format to the user but at the same time still retains the server time zone.",

The rational is:\r\n\r\n* The differing behaviour introduces development and support costs, and makes it more difficult for users transitioning BTF \u21ff OnDemand.\r\n* Supporting HTML enables XSS attacks.\r\n* Supporting HTML for options causes problems for other features, e.g. charts (see attachment)\r\n",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-34436].\n  {panel}\n\n*Currently* when performing a {{issue in X}} search using JQL (where {{X}} could be a literal, or a function or anything else), {{X}} is validated to ensure it only contains existing issues the current user can see. If this validation fails, the whole JQL fails to validate and a search is not even run.\r\n\r\n*After this change* validation-time checking on permissions is done in the {{issue in}} clause ONLY for non-function operands. However, at search-time the normal search process ensures that search results do not contain issues the user cannot see, regardless of the types of operands. If the issue does not exist, a validation error still occurs.\r\n\r\nFor example for {{issue in watchedIssues()}} and one of the issues that you've watched become unaccessible by you, where you would have previously seen a validation error, you will now see zero results.\r\n\r\n*Currently* As part of the validation, permission to view the returned issues by the current user  is checked and any jql query that returns one or more issues that are not viewable by the current user will be considered invalid and the actual search will not happen.\r\n\r\nIn the happy path case, when the query passes validation, the search using the jql query will still perform another permission check to make sure that no issues that violate the permission constraints are returned to the user. So the same permission check is performed twice here, once during validation, another during search.\r\n\r\nIn addition, in jql functions (e.g., LinkedIssuesFunction) that return issue ids for the clauses like *issue in*, the function implementations have to perform their own permission check, in order to make sure that they return only valid issue ids to pass the jql validation. This in effect adds another round of permission check.\r\n\r\n*After this change* Since jql functions are the main ones that might return a lot of issues, if we could get rid of the step of permission check in jql validation for {{issue in _some-jql-functions_}}, and rely only on the actual search to check permissions, we could eliminate up to two rounds of duplicated permission checks (one during jql validation, and potentially another one in the jql functions) for the majority of the jql search results.\r\n\r\nNote that The relaxation of the permission check during validation time only applies to the potential search results. If the jql function accepts parameters that refer to issues, e.g., {{issue in linkedIssues(\"ABC-123\")}}, it is still the responsibility of the jql function implementation to check the user's permissions to access ABC-123.",

We have added a new {{notifyUsers}} query parameter to the issue resource. You can set this query parameter value to {{false}} when making a PUT request to suppress email notifications for your change. [You can view the documentation here|https://docs.atlassian.com/jira/REST/cloud/#api/2/issue-editIssue].\r\n\r\nThis will *only* affect email notifications \u2013 changes will still be logged, added to the issue change history, events will still be sent to listeners, webhooks will still fire.\r\n\r\nThis is currently available in JIRA Cloud and was released in JIRA Server 7.2.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nDave Meyer\r\nJIRA Product Management\r\n{panel}\r\nREST api is supposed to replace XML/RPC and SOAP APIs which are already deprecated (and contains blocker bugs).\r\n\r\nI am filing this as a bug because it is clearly a regression from using SOAP where you can skip sending notifications.\r\n\r\nThis bug makes maintenance via REST almost impossible due to the amount of emails it will send to the users.\r\n\r\nSupport suggested disabling email notifications while the scripts are running but that's not possible for two reasons: these are live systems used 24x7 and 2nd, these could be triggered at different times or scheduled to run periodially, it's not possible to disable email notifications for the entire instance just to prevent these from happening.\r\n\r\nOne possible solution to this problem is to have a special group, like jira-bots (or jira-automation, jira-silent) for which jira will skip sending email notifications if the changes were made by a user part of this group.",

Problem\r\nA search via REST api call results in a high number of database queries, which could result in database performance issues.\r\n\r\nh4. Testing:\r\nI ran a local test:\r\n* Enabled SQL Logging in JIRA\r\n* Ran search via issue navigator (HTTP)\r\n{code}\r\nproject = test\r\n{code}\r\n* confirm SQL logging\r\n* Ran search via REST api\r\n{code}\r\ncurl -D- -u admin:admin -X GET -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" http://localhost:8079/rest/api/2/search?jql=project=test > restsearch-output\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nResults:\r\n* both HTTP and REST searches returned 50 issues (there are a total 1201, but only 50 are shown at a time)\r\n* the 50 issues are all the same issue keys in both searchs\r\n* HTTP - 45 SQL queries\r\n** including checks/updates to userhistoryitem table, 12 queries\r\n* REST - 413 SQL queries\r\n** including auth for the user, 20 queries\r\n** did not seem to check/update userhistoryitem\r\n\r\nEdit:\r\n* Just ran same test with com.atlassian.jira.issue.search.providers set to DEBUG\r\n** HTTP - 5 lines of DEBUG logging\r\n** REST - 77 lines of DEBUG logging\r\n*** There seems to be extra queries relating to parenttasks.  I ran a quick check and there are 10 sub-tasks in the search results.\r\n* see attached file",
