As a result, i receive a daily mail of warnings that mostly occured some weeks ago and were already handled. But there is no indicatinon of occurence date for the warnings. I can't know if there is a new warning unless I go everyday to look for each of the warnings mentionned in the mail to check if they occured recently, or i they are just relics of the older logs!\r\n\r\nIn the support tools of the admin pages, log analyser report show the last occurence of each warning. That information would also be usefull in the mail, telling me when i need to go look for more information. But only the raw list of warnings is in the mail, with no indication of occurence dates.\r\n\r\nEven better, (but maybe not fitted for all cases), could'nt there be an option for the\u00a0plannified scanning, to remove from the mail report the warnings that occured before the N last days/scans? Or the option to logrotate atlassian-jira.log after a scan, so the \u00a0next report only show what happened since the last scan?",

I add all of them to a certain screen and want to configure the visible fields via the Edit Issue dialog's _Configure Fields > Show Fields: Custom_ tab. There, only one entry is listed for the respective Custom Field name (e.g., there are three custom fields called 'Team' but in that drop-down I only see one entry called 'Team') which is randomly mapped to just one of the multiple Custom Fields having that name. It is thus not possible to specifically select the custom field to be shown.\r\nh3. Environment\r\n\r\nJIRA Cloud 1000.552.1\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Have\u00a0at least two custom fields with the exact same name in your JIRA instance\r\n # Add all of these custom fields to the\u00a0edit\u00a0issue screen of your project (can be any screen, basically)\r\n # Edit an issue using that screen\r\n # Try to select just one of your previously added custom fields via _Configure Fields > Show Fields: Custom_\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nThere is an entry for each of my custom fields and I can toggle their visibility\u00a0individually\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nThere is only one entry for all of my custom fields which toggles the visibility of the first custom field having that name.\r\nh3. Notes\r\n\r\nThere is\u00a0a short video illustrating the problem attached to this issue\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nIt is possible to at least show _all_ custom fields of that name by switching to _Configure Fields > Show Fields: All_; however, that is not \u00a0exactly what you want since\u00a0you'd actually like to only add one specific custom field to the screen. Alternatively, you can go to the screen configuration in the admin section and hide the fields\u00a0you do not want from there. This won't work for users without admin permissions, though.",

The expectation is that this should show unresolved issues.\r\n\r\nIn looking at the Jira issues, I've found JRA-13611, which indicates this is expected. I disagree and feel this is incorrect behavior.\r\n\r\nThe Time Tracking report is supposed to be able to provide a view of work remaining on a project. There are 2 options to show issues on this report:\r\n\"All\" - This results in a mess and we have to look at things that are already done or we've decided not to even do.\r\n\r\n\"Incomplete issues only\" - This option seems like it should be exactly what we want in showing unresolved issues. Unfortunately it very unhelpfully hides all issues without time estimates. This makes it difficult to know how much work is left as there isn't a clean way to see which issues don't have time estimates at all.\r\n\r\nI understand from the comments on JRA-13611 that the way this was designed was to show anything that has \"Remaining time\" > 0. Perhaps this is useful to someone, so alternately, please add a new filter such as \"Unresolved.\"",

Example:\r\n{quote}The custom field 'Environment' requires option 'Staging' for the import but it does not exist in the current JIRA instance.\r\n{quote}\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Have a source instance that has a Select List Custom Field (single choice) with one or more\u00a0contexts and options\r\n # Configure\u00a0the same custom field in a target instance with\u00a0the same contexts and custom field options\r\n # Perform Project Import from source to target, using XML backup from source\r\n # The import is blocked\u00a0in certain cases\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nEvery project import will go fine\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nIn certain cases, it's not possible to proceed with the import. The below can be seen in the GUI under Custom Fields validation:\r\n{noformat}\r\nThe custom field 'Environment' requires option 'Staging' for the import but it does not exist in the current JIRA instance.\r\n{noformat}\r\nh3. Notes\r\n\r\nOne of the causes\u00a0is when {{fieldconfiguration.id}}\u00a0does not match {{fieldconfigscheme.id}}. By rights JIRA should use\u00a0{{fieldconfiguration.id}}\u00a0when looking up {{customfieldoption.customfieldconfig}}, but it\u00a0incorrectly uses\u00a0{{fieldconfigscheme.id}}, causing the problem. More details can be found in\u00a0JRASERVER-65734.\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nRefer to [Project Import fails due to missing Custom Field Options|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRAKB/Project+Import+fails+due+to+missing+Custom+Field+Options]\u00a0for the above problem.",

We have added \"Project != Sandbox\" to our filters but that only goes so far.\r\n\r\nIt would be helpful if there was a way to exclude these \"sandbox\" projects from widgets, schedules, etc.\r\n\r\nIdeally, a flag such as \"Exclude from reporting\", or \"Designate as Sandbox\" at the project level would be best.",

Your feedback is key to helping us understand how you use JIRA so we can continue improving your experience. We have reviewed this issue over the last few days; unfortunately we don't have any plans to support this in JIRA for the foreseeable future.\r\n\r\nPlease remember that jira.atlassian.com is one of many inputs for the JIRA roadmap. You can [learn more about our process here|https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/110373/how-does-the-jira-team-use-jira-atlassian-com].\r\n \r\nI understand that our decision may be disappointing. Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.\r\n \r\nRegards,\r\nDave Meyer\r\ndmeyer@atlassian.com\r\nProduct Manager, JIRA Platform\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\nSome tasks are allways the same, thej have same summary and description, components...like tasks for deploy. Now I solve this with tasks thet are never closed and when I need souch task I clone IT. This works fine, except that there are allways some open tasks. \r\n\r\nIt wold be nice to have something like templates in confluence, where you can define template page..",
