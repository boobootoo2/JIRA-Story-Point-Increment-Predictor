It struck such a simple thing is not present. Therefor here my humble request, please make it customizable.

      "description": "The default OR-based searches seem to rank reoccurances of a search term too high. When searching for multiple terms, a partially matching document that repeats one or more terms many times is ranked above a full match. My experience is that more complete matches are far more relevant than less complete matches, with reoccurance not being that significant.\r\n\r\nIf the results are getting 'spammed' by reoccuring terms then the problem becomes even more noticeable when you narrow your search, because adding more terms doesn't substantially affect the results.\r\n\r\nHere is an example where the most highly ranked full match goes from first to 32nd as a result of allowing partial matches. The search terms I chose aren't the most accurate but do show how much of an effect recurrences have on the results:\r\n\r\nSearching for '[CONF Error AND repository AND Exception|http://jira.atlassian.com/secure/IssueNavigator.jspa?reset=true&&query=Error+repository+Exception&summary=true&description=true&body=true&pid=10470]' points straight to CONF-8422, which solved the problem the customer was trying to report.\r\n\r\nSearching for '[CONF Error repository Exception|http://jira.atlassian.com/secure/IssueNavigator.jspa?reset=true&&query=Error+repository+Exception&summary=true&description=true&body=true&pid=10470]' shifts that hit to the 32nd result, beneath results that did not solve my problem. The first result doesn't contain the term 'error' and has been boosted 9 occurances of 'repository' and of 4 'exception', mostly from a stack trace. \r\n\r\nI believe it would make searching more accurate to lower the weight of recurring terms in Lucene, or ideally, switch to AND default searches. Does anyone else agree? Let me know if I'm wrong on any of this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-14696].\n  {panel}\n\nHi guys,\r\n\r\nLet me share some pain :)\r\n\r\nWhile scheduled backups go to JIRA backup directory specified in JIRA settings, all backup operations lauched by hand store backups in a different place (e.g. c:\\windows\\system32 - I assume it's the current dir of the JIRA service. See attached screenshot). To place a backup in other dir, admin always has to enter the destination path by hand; if there are some sequential changes pending assuming a series of backups, this may drive one nuts (especially if there's a typo and the backup file is lost somewhere in the filesystem). \r\n\r\nI'd say a preferable way would be to store backups always in the same dir - this will reduce the amount of typing to backup filename (i.e. if only filename is entered, the file goes to JIRA Backup Dir). Current implementation is so inconvenient that I prefer to RDC to the JIRA host, open JIRA in browser there, browse filesystem for the backup path and then copy/paste it into the backup UI field.\r\n\r\nIMHO this thing may save lots of nerve. Thanks for your time.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n~Nick",
