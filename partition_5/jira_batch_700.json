I've also got lots of filters set up to help us navigate to the relevant issue lists for each section of the meeting.\r\n\r\nWhat I'd like to see is a gadget similar to the \"Favourite Filters\" gadget, but instead of only showing the favourite filters (where each user can only have one list), you can specify a list of filters to use in this instance of the gadget. That way I could have a different filter list on each dashboard, and also have other information and graphs on there.\r\n\r\nAt present I've achieved this using multiple \"Filter Results\" gadgets and limiting to one item per list, but this isn't practical and a list of filters in the same format as \"Favourite Filters\" would be much better. I looked into writing my own, but apparently you can't write custom gadgets for OnDemand (accoriding to https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/Cloud/Restricted+Functions+in+Cloud+Applications)\r\n\r\nI tried searching the project for existing items but couldn't seem to find anything, apologies if I missed it.\r\n\r\nMany thanks,\r\nJames",

There seems to be no functional problem from the UI side.\r\n\r\nWhen clicking on an mp4 attachment, it will play the video in the web browser with no indication of any problem, but JIRA logs a {{ClientAbortException}}.\r\n* This doesn't seem to happen for small files that are less than 1 MB (rought estimate)\r\n* For files that are a couple MB in size, it happens upon first request, but not after. I believe this is because of caching\r\n* I've been able to always reproduce this with larger files of great than a couple hundred MB\r\n\r\nh3. Environment\r\nReproducible on the browsers below: \r\n- Chrome 42.0.2311.135 (64-bit) \r\n- Safari 7.1 (9537.85.10.17.1)\r\n\r\nThe error does not happen when streaming the video on Firefox 37.0.2. \r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Upload a .mp4 video file to an issue ticket (e.g. [^SampleVideo_360x240_5mb.mp4]).\r\n#* Use larger files for best results\r\n# Click on the video, which will cause it to start playing in your web browser\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nNo errors are written to the logs.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nThe errors below will be written to the JIRA logs:\r\n{{catalina.out}} or {{atlassian-jira.log}}:\r\n{code}\r\n2015-03-27 16:02:54,535 http-bio-8080-exec-5 ERROR admin 962x252x1

Specifically, when a pull request is merged the issue is transitioned from 'In Review' to 'Resolved'.  However, we have a slightly unusual setup in that we have more than one Stash repository per project and it is not uncommon for a JIRA issue to be associated with changes in more than one repository. As a result, it is quite common for a JIRA issue to have more than one pull request. Our problem is that as soon as the first pull request is approved the developer merges the branch without waiting for the other pull request(s) to be approved. This transitions the issue to Resolved even though there is still one or more outstanding pull request. Ideally, it should not be transitioned to Resolved until all pull requests are merged. I think the best way to achieve this would be to have a Condition that can be added to the transition which would prevent the transition if there are outstanding pull requests. ",

      "description": "Tempo Planner, Folio and Books are disabled on JIRA 6.4 after restart.\r\n\r\nWe had to remove the JIRA 6.4 compatibility for these products. Is there a workaround that we can publish to our customers that they can use until a fix is released?\r\n\r\nIt appears as everything works when we run our environment with atlas-run-standalone. Then if we restart it (just ctrl+C and run it up again) the products are not enabled. We have to manually install these plugins again in the UPM and that is quite sub-optimal.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, JIRA 6.4 server is affected. We set up a JIRA 6.4 instance to verify that this problem was only limited to using the atlas-run-standalone command but the atlassian-jira-6.4.tar.gz file provided by Atlassian must be broken since we can access everything in the Admin section except the Add-ons section. There we get a 404 error despite having the correct URL.\r\n\r\nWhen one of our Timesheets developers first tried to see if the plugin worked on JIRA 6.4 last November, he experienced these difficulties and contacted Bradley Ayers from Atlassian. He gave us this answer:\r\n\r\n\"After having a chat with the plugin system team, I've come to the conclusion that the 6.4-m09 milestone is broken, and it's something we'll need to fix before 6.4 final is released. If this is blocking your development (e.g. you need to test JIRA startup behaviour), there's a work around you can use until we fix this within JIRA:\r\nMake a copy of tenant-smart-patterns.txt, add your other plugin key to it, and then set the system property atlassian.plugins.tenant.smart.patterns to point to the new file.\"\r\n\r\nThis workaround fixes our problems, but we thought that it should have been fixed by now. Can we do something else than this workaround? What should we tell our customers who are running our products on JIRA 6.4? Should we tell our customers to add the artifact ids to the tenant file as a short term solution?\r\n\r\nThank you very much, I hope you understand that this is quite urgent.",

The bug in Stash is being tracked on [STASH-7195|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/STASH-7195].\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Set up Stash 3.4.3+ with JIRA 6.4 configured as its User Management Server. To perform that, please refer to [Connecting Stash to JIRA for user management|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/STASH/Connecting+Stash+to+JIRA+for+user+management].\r\n# Perform Synchronisation\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nSynchronisation should work just fine.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nThe below exception is thrown in the {{atlassian-stash.log}} file:\r\n{noformat}\r\nERROR [clusterScheduler_Worker-4]  c.a.c.d.DbCachingDirectoryPoller Error occurred while refreshing the cache for directory [ 229377 ].\r\ncom.atlassian.crowd.exception.OperationFailedException: Error from Crowd server propagated to here via REST API (check the Crowd server logs for details): Class type for return values ('interface com.atlassian.crowd.model.group.GroupWithAttributes') is not 'String' or 'Group'\r\n\tat com.atlassian.crowd.integration.rest.service.RestCrowdClient.handleCommonExceptions(RestCrowdClient.java:1501) ~[crowd-integration-client-rest-2.8.1-m3.jar:na]\r\n\tat com.atlassian.crowd.integration.rest.service.RestCrowdClient.searchGroupsWithAttributes(RestCrowdClient.java:574) ~[crowd-integration-client-rest-2.8.1-m3.jar:na]\r\n\tat com.atlassian.crowd.directory.RemoteCrowdDirectory.searchGroups(RemoteCrowdDirectory.java:547) ~[crowd-remote-2.8.1-m3.jar:na]\r\n\tat com.atlassian.crowd.directory.ldap.cache.RemoteDirectoryCacheRefresher.findAllRemoteGroups(RemoteDirectoryCacheRefresher.java:80) ~[crowd-ldap-2.8.1-m3.jar:na]\r\n\tat com.atlassian.crowd.directory.ldap.cache.RemoteDirectoryCacheRefresher.synchroniseAllGroups(RemoteDirectoryCacheRefresher.java:109) ~[crowd-ldap-2.8.1-m3.jar:na]\r\n\tat com.atlassian.crowd.directory.ldap.cache.AbstractCacheRefresher.synchroniseAll(AbstractCacheRefresher.java:91) ~[crowd-ldap-2.8.1-m3.jar:na]\r\n\tat com.atlassian.crowd.directory.ldap.cache.EventTokenChangedCacheRefresher.synchroniseAll(EventTokenChangedCacheRefresher.java:67) ~[crowd-ldap-2.8.1-m3.jar:na]\r\n\tat com.atlassian.crowd.directory.DbCachingRemoteDirectory.synchroniseCache(DbCachingRemoteDirectory.java:1122) ~[crowd-core-2.8.1-m3.jar:na]\r\n\tat com.atlassian.crowd.manager.directory.DirectorySynchroniserImpl.synchronise(DirectorySynchroniserImpl.java:76) ~[crowd-core-2.8.1-m3.jar:na]\r\n\tat com.atlassian.crowd.directory.DbCachingDirectoryPoller.pollChanges(DbCachingDirectoryPoller.java:50) ~[crowd-core-2.8.1-m3.jar:na]\r\n\tat com.atlassian.crowd.manager.directory.monitor.poller.DirectoryPollerJobRunner.runJob(DirectoryPollerJobRunner.java:93) [crowd-core-2.8.1-m3.jar:na]\r\n\tat com.atlassian.scheduler.core.JobLauncher.runJob(JobLauncher.java:153) [atlassian-scheduler-core-1.5.0.jar:na]\r\n\tat com.atlassian.scheduler.core.JobLauncher.launchAndBuildResponse(JobLauncher.java:118) [atlassian-scheduler-core-1.5.0.jar:na]\r\n\tat com.atlassian.scheduler.core.JobLauncher.launch(JobLauncher.java:97) [atlassian-scheduler-core-1.5.0.jar:na]\r\n\tat com.atlassian.scheduler.quartz2.Quartz2Job.execute(Quartz2Job.java:32) [atlassian-scheduler-quartz2-1.5.0.jar:na]\r\n\tat org.quartz.core.JobRunShell.run(JobRunShell.java:202) [quartz-2.2.1.jar:na]\r\n\tat org.quartz.simpl.SimpleThreadPool$WorkerThread.run(SimpleThreadPool.java:573) [quartz-2.2.1.jar:na]\r\n\t... 13 frames trimmed\r\nCaused by: com.atlassian.crowd.integration.rest.service.CrowdRestException: Class type for return values ('interface com.atlassian.crowd.model.group.GroupWithAttributes') is not 'String' or 'Group'\r\n\tat com.atlassian.crowd.integration.rest.service.RestExecutor$MethodExecutor.throwError(RestExecutor.java:660) ~[crowd-integration-client-rest-2.8.1-m3.jar:na]\r\n\tat com.atlassian.crowd.integration.rest.service.RestExecutor$MethodExecutor.andReceive(RestExecutor.java:489) ~[crowd-integration-client-rest-2.8.1-m3.jar:na]\r\n\tat com.atlassian.crowd.integration.rest.service.RestCrowdClient.searchGroupsWithAttributes(RestCrowdClient.java:570) ~[crowd-integration-client-rest-2.8.1-m3.jar:na]\r\n\t... 16 common frames omitted\r\n{noformat}\r\n \r\n\r\nh3.Solution / Workaround\r\n\r\nAs [STASH-7195|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/STASH-7195] has been closed and shipped in Stash 3.7.2 you can either:\r\n- Upgrade Stash to version 3.7.2 or;\r\n- Wait until this JRA-42566 is closed and upgrade JIRA to version 6.4.1",

Mine is a duplicate of that one-- but I don't have permission to resolve my own issue as duplicate. Sorry JIRA team about the spam!*\r\n\r\nWhen I'm creating a new issue, it's often related to the current page I'm viewing. For example, when viewing a list of issues, I may want to refer to the issue number of an existing issue in the description of the new issue. Or when reviewing a resolved issue, I may spot a problem with the solution that we'll need to address in a future release. \r\n\r\nBut because the create dialog hides a large percentage of the screen, I often can't see the info in back that I need to refer to in my issue. This means I often have to decide to either abandon my new issue and re-type whatever I've typed so far, or to save the incomplete issue and immediately edit it. \r\n\r\nI know that I can open the create form in a new tab and bypassed this problem, but often I don't realize that I need info from the page until after I'm already midway through entering info in the dialog.\r\n\r\nCould JIRA modal dialogs be enhanced to allow moving dialog boxes out of the way by making the dialog header draggable?  \r\n\r\nFWIW, most modern web apps already support this behavior, perhaps because jquery.dialog and other frameworks' dialog widgets offer this behavior by default.",

Problem\r\n\r\nUsers discover that certain issues are not able to be transitioned (e.g. Done, Fixed, etc.)\r\n\r\nFor at least one customer this problem can occur when a SQL exception happens during issue creation.  Custom fields of type URL are limited to 255 characters but in JIRA 6.4.4 this is not enforced by validation in the UI.  When using MySQL this results in a SQL exception and creation of a partial issue record which can not be indexed. \r\n!Long-URL-Exception.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\nThis is a possible regression of JRA-4241.\r\n\r\n\r\nh4. Workaround: Integrity Checker\r\n\r\nRunning integrity checker will solve the problem\r\n\r\n\r\nh4. Workaround: Field validation using Script Runner Behaviours\r\n\r\nIf users report a SQL exception when creating issues you can prevent this by adding validation behaviors to the custom fields.\r\n\r\nThis is useful for JIRA versions prior to 6.4.12 when you have many workflows and transitions so adding a validation to all of them would be too time consuming.\r\n\r\n# Install the [Script Runner|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.onresolve.jira.groovy.groovyrunner] add-on which provides the [Behaviours|https://scriptrunner.adaptavist.com/latest/jira/behaviours-overview.html] feature.\r\n# Navigate to JIRA_BASE_URL/secure/admin/Behaviours!default.jspa\r\n# Create a new Behavior\r\n# Click on the \"Fields\" link next to the newly created Behaviour\r\n# Add the field(s) you want to protect with the behavior.\r\n# For each field click \"Add serverside script\" and insert Groovy scripting to check the field length.  Example: {code}\r\ndef url_field = getFieldById(getFieldChanged())\r\nif (url_field == null) {\r\n  return 0;\r\n}\r\ndef value = url_field.getValue();\r\nif (value == null) {\r\n  return 0;\r\n}\r\nif (value.length() > 255) {\r\n  url_field.setError(\"URL is too long, must be less than 255 characters.\");\r\n} else {\r\n  url_field.clearError();\r\n}\r\n{code}\r\n!^Workaround-BehaviorFix.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nh4. Workaround: Add workflow validations\r\n\r\nIf users report a SQL exception when creating issues you can prevent this by adding validation to transitions in your workflow.\r\n\r\nThis is useful for JIRA versions prior to 6.4.12 when you do not have many workflows/transitions or you cannot purchase the Script Runner add-on.\r\n\r\n# Install the [JIRA Suite Utilities|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.googlecode.jira-suite-utilities] add-on (free)\r\n# Edit the workflow\r\n# For the Create transition add a validation.\r\n# Choose the [regular expression validation|https://jsutil.atlassian.net/wiki/display/JSUTIL/JIRA+Suite+Utilities+Workflow+Validators#JIRASuiteUtilitiesWorkflowValidators-RegularExpressionCheckValidator]. \r\n# Enter this regular expression to limit a field to 255 characters: {code}^[^\\s]{0,255}${code}\r\n#* Here's a screenshot of the configuration screen:\r\n!Regular-Expression-Length-Check.png|thumbnail!
