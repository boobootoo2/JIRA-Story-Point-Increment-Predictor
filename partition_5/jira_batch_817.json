It was very usefull. Now I don't see this. According to the support (https://support.atlassian.com/browse/JST-34176), \"this was a deliberate change that was intended for the JIRA 4.4 release but it appears to have only hit Atlassian OnDemand with JIRA 5. The reason for the change is that JIRA emails can now be more easily organised into conversations in gmail or other mobile applications.\" It was suggested to vote for JRA-7266 as a workaround. Apparently, it can take probably a lot of time to get into a roadmap for implementation. On the other hand, there is a simple principle: if a new program feature is questionable (as in this case), it should be complemented with an option to switch it off. I think this is much simplier to implement such a check-box in the Administration section than a general-purpose template editor.\r\n",

It's just a plain text field.\r\n\r\nThe user picker field could looks so much better. The text field should allow users to type a name, and the auto-complete can work just as it does now (very good).\r\n\r\nBut when a user is selected let's move them into a bar below the text field. Something more like what stackoverflow.com does for tags, for example. Or create a bullet point style list of users below the text field where you enter the user names. \r\n\r\nEach user should have an 'x' next to their name to remove them easily (the free-form editing is so ugly).\r\n\r\nFor example, when a default set of users is selected the field should look like this on a create/edit issue form:\r\n\r\n[ Enter user name ]\r\nx Joe Smith\r\nx Allen Brown\r\nx Bob Cline\r\n\r\nHere's what it currently looks like:\r\n[ Joe Smith, Allen Brown, Bob Cline ]\r\n\r\nIt's not at all obvious where to start typing in the 2nd example shown (the current status quo).

Specifically:\r\n\r\nhttp://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Migrating+JIRA+to+Another+Server indicates:\r\n\r\n{quote}\r\nThis document describes how to perform any of the following:\r\n\r\n* migrate/upgrade to JIRA 5.0.xon different server hardware or in a different server environment \u2014 for example:\r\n** a new operating system that will run JIRA,\r\n** new locations for storing your index and/or attachments, or\r\n** a new database or database system that will store JIRA's data.\r\n* {color:red}upgrade to JIRA 5.0.x from a version of JIRA prior to 4.0.0.{color}\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nAlso http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Upgrading+JIRA has:\r\n\r\n{quote}\r\n* If any of these points applies to your situation, use the migration procedure (see Migrating JIRA to Another Server) to upgrade JIRA instead:\r\n** {color:red}You are upgrading from a version of JIRA prior to 4.0.0.{color}\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nHowever http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/JIRA+5.0+Upgrade+Notes#JIRA50UpgradeNotes-UpgradingtoJIRA50fromaversionofJIRAprior400 lists:\r\n\r\n{quote}\r\n{color:red}Please be aware that you cannot directly upgrade JIRA from a version prior to 4.0.0 (for example from JIRA 3.10.3).{color} Instead, you will need to upgrade your JIRA installation to a JIRA 4.x version first before you can upgrade to JIRA 5.0. The latest JIRA 4.4.x version is recommended for this process. The following resources in the JIRA 4.4.x documentation are good places to start for upgrading to the latest JIRA 4.4.x release:\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nCan you please update the above docs so it doesn't give the impression JIRA 5.0 can be upgraded from a version prior to 4?\r\n\r\nThanks!",

Cause\r\n\r\nThis could be caused by casing changes in groups within the LDAP Directory - for example changing a group from {{space-marines}} to {{Space-Marines}}.\r\n\r\nThis may be similar to CONF-22631.  In that case, it was setup so that the synchronisation will complete even if Confluence ran into a duplicate membership. Instead of failing the sync, JIRA should log the duplicate and continue finishing the sync.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\n# Schedule a downtime window, as users will be unable to login during these changes.\r\n# Log in as an administrator within the JIRA Internal Directory. If one does not exist, create it.\r\n# Disable the problematic User Directory.\r\n# Create a new [User Directory|http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Configuring+User+Directories] within JIRA, using the same settings as the old one.\r\n# Test the synchronisation and ensure that synchronisation completes successfully. If so, use this new directory.\r\n\r\n(!) If you have a User Directory set up with the Read Only, with Local Groups [permission settings|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Connecting+to+an+LDAP+Directory#ConnectingtoanLDAPDirectory-PermissionSettings] you will no longer have the local groups set up in the database when the user directory is disabled. The project roles will not be affected.\r\n\r\nIf you are using Microsoft AD, you can try to use the [adsiedit.msc|http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc773354(v=ws.10).aspx] to change the SAMAccountName attribute for the users to lowercase in the LDAP.",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-27331].\n  {panel}\n\nWhen editing (adding) new fields for a filter result in JIRA, the newly added field appears at the end of the list. If I want to move the field to another position, I have to use the arrows to move it 1 step by 1 step. This is really frustrating, annoying, and time consumming. Especially when the layout consists of several (dozens) fields.\r\n\r\nCan't the gui be modified to allow drag'n'drop of fields? Like it is already done in some other features (issue types schemes, or screens layout...)",

couple of issues here:\r\n\r\n* Activity stream publishing fails intermittently, and for no reason.\r\n* When failure occurs, an activity entry row is still incorrectly created in the database, but

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-27289].\n  {panel}\n\nHey,\r\n\r\nThe [Integrating JIRA with Apache using SSL|http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Integrating+JIRA+with+Apache+using+SSL] documentation shows how to set up JIRA to run on https://localhost:8443/jira, whereas the default configuration is to run JIRA on http://localhost/ (the difference being the jira subdirectory). There's some conflicting documentation on this, as below:\r\n\r\n[Step 1|http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Integrating+JIRA+with+Apache+using+SSL#IntegratingJIRAwithApacheusingSSL-Step1InhttpdensureSSLProxyEngineison] has the following:\r\n\r\n{code}\r\nProxyPass           /jira       https://localhost:8443/jira\r\nProxyPassReverse    /jira       https://localhost:8443/jira\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nAnd in the [alternative configuration|http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Integrating+JIRA+with+Apache+using+SSL#IntegratingJIRAwithApacheusingSSL-NoteAlternativeconfigurationifHTTPSisterminatedontheproxyserver]:\r\n\r\n{code}\r\nProxyPass              /jira       http://localhost:8080/jira\r\nProxyPassReverse       /jira       http://localhost:8080/jira\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nWhereas [Configuring Apache Reverse Proxy Using the AJP Protocol|http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Configuring+Apache+Reverse+Proxy+Using+the+AJP+Protocol] has the following:\r\n\r\n{code}\r\nProxyPass        / ajp://JIRA_HOST_NAME:AJP_CONNECTOR_PORT/\r\nProxyPassReverse / ajp://JIRA_HOST_NAME:AJP_CONNECTOR_PORT/\r\n{code}\r\n\r\n[Integrating JIRA with Apache|http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Integrating+JIRA+with+Apache] has both:\r\n\r\n{code}\r\nProxyPass           /jira       http://localhost:8080/jira\r\nProxyPassReverse    /jira       http://localhost:8080/jira\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nand:\r\n\r\n{code}\r\nProxyPass / http://localhost:8080/\r\nProxyPassReverse / http://localhost:8080/\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nThe problem seems to be some varied differences between 3 pieces of documentation.\r\n\r\n{{/jira}} will work if the following is set in {{server.xml}}, as per the example below. The problem is that the default {{server.xml}} has the path set to \"\".\r\n\r\n{code}\r\n<Context path=\"/jira\" docBase=\"${catalina.home}/atlassian-jira\" reloadable=\"false\">\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nThis is the default:\r\n{code}\r\n<Context path=\"\" docBase=\"${catalina.home}/atlassian-jira\" reloadable=\"false\">\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nIf the path value is not set to \"{{/jira}}\" and ProxyPass[Reverse] is directed to \"{{/jira}}\" it will cause errors. It also means the client needs to access their JIRA instance differently, as above.\r\n\r\nI realise this is unsupported, however is there any chance the docs could be changed to either be {{/}} instead of {{/jira}}, (like the second example in [Integrating JIRA with Apache|http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Integrating+JIRA+with+Apache] docs) or include the {{server.xml}} changes as above?",

It is not on the appropriate screen, or unknown.\",\"description\":\"Field 'description' cannot be set. It is not on the appropriate screen, or unknown.\"}}\r\n{code}\r\n* The documentation link on this page https://developer.atlassian.com/display/JIRADEV/JIRA+REST+APIs for 'Reference' links to an apache directory listing http://docs.atlassian.com/jira/REST/ which makes you think something is broken there. Can we not set a link to 'latest' ?",
