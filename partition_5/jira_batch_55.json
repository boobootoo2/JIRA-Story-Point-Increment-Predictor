Now, however, I right-click x.txt.orig and select \"Remove,\" and SourceTree says basically \"OK, we will remove x.txt.orig AND x.txt\".  Looks to me like it is applying the selected command (Remove) to items in BOTH the staged and unstaged files list.\r\n\r\nAnd there is no way that I can see to \"unselect\" files in either list, so that I could just have the one file I need.  \r\n\r\nThe menu item needs to apply to ONLY the list (staged or unstaged) from which it was invoked.",
