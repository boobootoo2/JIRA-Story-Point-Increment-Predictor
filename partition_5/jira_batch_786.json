Summary: \r\n\r\nThe current error displayed for background indexing doesn't always accurately represent the problem with the JIRA instance. \r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n# Create a JIRA issue.\r\n# Add a few comments.\r\n# Delete the JIRA issue from {{jiraissue}}. The comments will be orphaned.\r\n# Go to the re-index page.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results:\r\n\r\nJIRA would either handle the orphaned records (in this example, comments) or display a different error.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results:\r\n\r\nThe error is displayed, as in the attached screenshot.\r\n\r\nh3. Notes:\r\n\r\nThis can be fixed with modification to the database, as in our [How to Fix the JIRA is Unable to Perform a Background Re-Index at This Time Error|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRAKB/How+to+Fix+the+JIRA+is+Unable+to+Perform+a+Background+Re-Index+at+This+Time+Error] KB.\r\n",

      "description": "Summary:  \r\ncode in JIRA 5.2's jquery.hotkeys.js is not fully handling the case where the event object passed isPlainObject.  It tries dereferencing <event>.combo which is never set in this particular case.  The versions of this code in JIRA 5.0 and 5.1 work properly.\r\n\r\nDetails:\r\nIn a plugin we're developing, we're including a library that calls jQuery.bind to bind an event handler to \"keypress\".\r\n\r\nJIRA's hotkeys JS code has registered an event \"add\" handler (see jquery.hotkeys.js -- at least in 5.1 source) for \"keypress\" which gets called to add handling for the custom keypress event registered by the 3rd party library.\r\n\r\nThe problem is, for the event we're trying to add isPlainObject = true.  This particular case never sets the .combo property on the event before jQuery.map is called passing the .combo property as a key.  Since .combo is undefined, jQuery.map fails with an unhandled JS exception -- specifically within the .map function the attempt to get .length on the first parameter passed (undefined) generates the exception.\r\n\r\nHere's the stack trace from JS where things blow up...\r\n\r\ne.extend.map (batch.js:525)\r\n(anonymous function) (batch.js:8611)\r\nC (batch.js:8614)\r\nf.event.add (batch.js:1115)\r\n(anonymous function) (batch.js:1301)\r\ne.extend.each (batch.js:483)\r\ne.fn.e.each (batch.js:348)\r\nf.fn.extend.on (batch.js:1300)\r\nf.fn.extend.bind (batch.js:1323)\r\n_fnBindAction (jquery.dataTables.js:2514)\r\n$.extend.full_numbers.fnInit (jquery.dataTables.js:3519)\r\n_fnFeatureHtmlPaginate (jquery.dataTables.js:1505)\r\n_fnAddOptionsHtml (jquery.dataTables.js:914)\r\n_fnInitialise (jquery.dataTables.js:1364)\r\n(anonymous function) (jquery.dataTables.js:3354)\r\ne.extend.each (batch.js:483)\r\ne.fn.e.each (batch.js:348)\r\nDataTable (jquery.dataTables.js:3096)\r\nArsenale.Dataplane.ReportConfig.decorateTableDataViews (reportConfig.js:41)\r\n(anonymous function) (reportConfig.js:151)\r\nn (batch.js:593)\r\no.fireWith (batch.js:638)\r\nw (batch.js:2498)\r\nd (batch.js:2667)\r\n\r\nwhere the exception is happening in JIRA's jquery.hotkeys.js...\r\n\r\nfunction C(G) {\r\nif (!(D.isPlainObject(G.data) || D.isArray(G.data) || typeof G.data === \"string\")) { return }\r\nvar F = G.handler, E = {timer: 700};\r\n(function(H) {\r\nif (typeof H === \"string\") { E.combo = [H] } else {\r\nif (D.isArray(H)) { E.combo = H } else { D.extend(E, H) }\r\n}\r\nE.combo = D.map(E.combo, function(I) { <============= E.combo undefined when D.isPlainObject\r\n return I.toLowerCase() })\r\n})(G.data);\r\n",

Sometimes they doesn't appear on the application link screen, sometimes it's impossible to remove them, sometimes you remove them and they are kept on the database. There's no pattern, but it cause many misbehaviors in JIRA itself.\r\n\r\nThere's also a [JIRA KB|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRAKB/How+to+remove+Application+link+directly+through+database] explaining how to remove a JIRA application link on the database. Would be nice if we could improve this JIRA functionality for the next versions.\r\n\r\n",

Summary: \r\n\r\nPlease improve JIRA so that when moving an issue from one project to another, if there is a custom field with different contexts for each project it will retain that value. Currently it does not.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n# Create Custom Field with different contexts for Project A & Project B (as in the attached screenshot).\r\n# Create Issue in Project A with one value in the Custom Field.\r\n# Bulk Move the issue to Project B.\r\n# Select the retain check box and complete the move.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results:\r\n\r\nThe value would be retained.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results:\r\n\r\nThe value is not retained.\r\n\r\nh3. Notes:\r\n\r\nThis happens for both move and bulk move, however move never offers the retain option. It is possible that the context for the target project will not have the same options as the source project - I'm unsure how to suggest best handling of this.",

This can be bypassed by any administrator today and violates our security policies!\r\n\r\nAlso our project charging is based on the project leads cost center, so the charging could be faked to a dummy account.\r\n\r\nIf there were some trace regarding the administrators activities the impact for us would not be that high. But the way it is now, is a real security issue for us!\r\n\r\nSo we suggest to let just the project lead or jira administrator change the project lead. Or at least have some permission \"Change project lead\" would also help.\r\n\r\nPlease consider fixing this soon! We have customers that have already complained about this.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nDieter",
