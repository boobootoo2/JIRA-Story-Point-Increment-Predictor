      "description": "h3.Description\r\nI have noticed that in one of our JIRA instances with 70k+ issues, a lot of them have wrong count of watchers which leads to wrong search results (we prioritize some items by amount of watchers because we have voting disabled).\r\n\r\nI have verified that the watches count differs from the watchissue user associations in the database and in an XML export. Even after re-importing the XML data, the count gets out of sync with the actual amount of watchers.\r\n\r\nAfter inspecting the JIRA source, the code seems quite stable except for some minor flaws.\r\n\r\nI then found that our extensive use of the clone issue operation might have caused the issue and I was able to reproduce this on a JIRA 6.0.6 instance:\r\n\r\n!cloning_watch_count_increase.png!\r\n\r\n!cloning_watch_count_increase_watchers.png!\r\n\r\nBesides fixing the bug in the clone issue operation, it would be good to provide a fix for this (probably a SQL update statement that counts the actual user watchissue associations and updates the count).\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nh3.Steps to produce:\r\n# Create a new issue and make sure you are added as a watcher to the issue (you are the only watcher for this ticket)\r\n# Clone this issue to another issue and make sure that you are added as a watcher for the new cloned issue (you are the only watcher for this ticket)\r\n# Go to the _Issue Navigator_ and add the column *Watchers* to the issue navigator\r\n# You will notice that for the cloned issue, there will be two watchers, and when you try to open the issue, you will only see one user.\r\n\r\nh3.Workaround\r\nYou can conduct either of the following for workaround:\r\n- Update 'watches' column of 'jiraissue' table and run re-index\r\n- Upgrade JIRA to 6.3.3 or later, which automatically corrects the unsyncronized watchers number\r\n\r\nh3.Workaround 2:\r\nIf even after the upgrade some issues are still showing the wrong number:\r\n- Run the following SQL query to see if this applies to your case (if it returns any results, you can proceed):\r\n{code:sql}\r\nselect * from jiraissue where id not in (select sink_node_id from userassociation where association_type = 'WatchIssue') and watches > 0;\r\n{code}\r\n- Create a backup from your JIRA, just in case ;) ;\r\n- Stop your JIRA;\r\n- Run the following SQL query:\r\n{code:sql}\r\nupdate jiraissue set watches = 0 where id not in (select sink_node_id from userassociation where association_type = 'WatchIssue') and watches > 0;\r\n{code}\r\n- Start your JIRA;\r\n- Perform a full re-index.\r\n\r\nh3. Notes\r\n\r\nThis upgrade task can take quite some time, especially depending upon the type of database used and also the issue / watch count. In some cases it takes 30+ minutes.",

      "description": "JIRA can be configured to create an issue as part of a post function, using third-party tools such as Script Runner. Additionally, when an issue is created, the \"Issue Created\" event should be fired and propagated to listeners.\r\n\r\nHowever, if an issue is created as part of a post function, the issue will not be committed to the database by the time the event is dispatched. For example, with an event listener similar to the following:\r\n\r\n{code}\r\n    @EventListener\r\n    public void onIssueEvent(IssueEvent issueEvent)\r\n    {\r\n        Long eventTypeId = issueEvent.getEventTypeId();\r\n        Issue issue = issueEvent.getIssue();\r\n\r\n        if (eventTypeId.equals(EventType.ISSUE_CREATED_ID))\r\n        {\r\n            Issue i2 = issueManager.getIssueObject(issue.getId());\r\n\r\n            // ...\r\n        }\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nWhen an issue is created normally (such as by clicking the \"Create Issue\" button), \"i2\" points to the same issue that is made available via issueEvent.getIssue().\r\n\r\nHowever, if this is executed as a post function (for example, using Script Runner 2.1.9 with the canned \"Clones an issue and links\" script), *then \"i2\" is null*.\r\n\r\nThis presumably happens because the post function is executed inside a transaction via OSWorkflowManager.doWorkflowActionInsideTxn, and the transaction does not get committed until the post function returns (which is long after the event handler has been run).\r\n\r\nThere are some scary comments in OSWorkflowManager.createIssue() indicating that transactions around a \"Create Issue\" can potentially cause deadlock or duplicate issue keys (JRADEV-7958, JRA-25914), which might or might not be relevant to this specific case...although if this listener tries to create another issue based on this event, I imagine that the end result would not be pretty.",

      "description": "h3. Summary\r\nWhen importing a project, issue status ids are mapped from the old IDs to new IDs based on the issue status names.\r\nThis leads to the Agile _Burndown_, _Cumulative Flow Diagram_ charts becoming wrong, as the change history entries are referring to different or nonexistent issue statuses.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Configure Source JIRA with <STATE> and do multiple transitions.\r\n# Make xml backup.\r\n# Import xml backup into Target JIRA\r\n# Check {{changeitem}} table _oldvalue_ and _newvalue_ values\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nThe change history oldvalue and newvalue fields are update to match Target JIRA. \r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nWhen this is done, the change history oldvalue and newvalue fields are not updated.\r\n \r\nh3. Notes\r\nI can see two ways of fixing this:\r\n* a. Change Agile to look at {{changeitem.oldstring}} and {{changeitem.newstring}} instead of {{changeitem.oldvalue}} and {{changeitem.newvalue}} when it's determining status change history\r\n* b. Change the project import process to do the equivalent of:\r\n{code}\r\nupdate changeitem set newvalue=(select id from issuestatus where pname=changeitem.newstring) and field='status' and fieldtype='jira' and groupid in (select id from changegroup where issueid in (select id from jiraissue where project = :projectid));\r\nupdate changeitem set oldvalue=(select id from issuestatus where pname=changeitem.oldstring) and field='status' and fieldtype='jira' and groupid in (select id from changegroup where issueid in (select id from jiraissue where project = :projectid));\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nh3.Workaround\r\nUpdate DB table {{changeitem}} manually for each state: <STATE> .\r\n{code}\r\nUPDATE changeitem\r\nSET oldvalue = '<TARGET_STATE_ID>'\r\nWHERE fieldtype = 'jira'\r\n  AND FIELD = 'status'\r\n  AND oldvalue = '<SOURCE_STATE_ID>'\r\n  AND oldstring LIKE \"<STATE>%\"\r\n\r\nUPDATE changeitem\r\nSET newvalue = '<TARGET_STATE_ID>'\r\nWHERE fieldtype = 'jira'\r\n  AND FIELD = 'status'\r\n  AND newvalue = '<SOURCE_STATE_ID>'\r\n  AND newstring LIKE \"<STATE>%\"\r\n{code}",

This can be very handy especially if used in conjunction with a special handler.\r\n\r\nAn example:\r\n\r\n  @Option(name=\"--index\" , aliases=\"-i\" , usage=\"index bean                (index)\"  , metaVar=\"<index>\", defaults=\"index\", handler=OptionHandlerBean.class)\r\n  private Index index;\r\n\r\nThe OptionHandlerBean accesses an application context to receive an Index instance. If it is not specified, the OptionHandlerBean is invoked as if \"index\" would be given as an option. Of course you could give a default value for the index variable but this does not address a situation where the default value must be closed.\r\n\r\nAn other example is an OutputStream:\r\n\r\n  @Option(name=\"--out\", handler=OptionHandlerOutputStream.class)\r\n  private OutputStream outputStream = new FileOutputStream(\"fufu\");\r\n\r\nhere, the benefit of a default value becomes obvious: the OutputStream to \"fufu\" will not be closed once the option is defined.\r\n\r\n\r\nRight now, I am using a patched version of args4j to address this situation:\r\n\r\nOption.java:\r\n\r\n    /**\r\n     * Defines a default value that will be applied if this option was not set\r\n     * explicitely.\r\n     */\r\n    String[] defaults() default { };\r\n\r\nOptionDef.java:\r\n\r\nprivate final String[] defaults;\r\n\r\n  public OptionDef(Argument a, boolean forceMultiValued) {\r\n    this(a.usage(), a.metaVar(), a.required(), a.hidden(), a.handler(), a.multiValued() || forceMultiValued, null);//XXX overlay\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  protected OptionDef(String usage, String metaVar, boolean required,\r\n      boolean hidden, Class<? extends OptionHandler> handler,\r\n      boolean multiValued, String[] aDefaults) {\r\n    this.usage = usage;\r\n    this.metaVar = metaVar;\r\n    this.required = required;\r\n    this.hidden = hidden;\r\n    this.handler = handler;\r\n    this.multiValued = multiValued;\r\n    defaults = aDefaults;//XXX overlay\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  public String[] getDefaults() {\r\n    return Arrays.clone(defaults);\r\n  }\r\n\r\nNamedOptionDef.java:\r\n\r\n    public NamedOptionDef(Option o) {\r\n      super(o.usage(),o.metaVar(),o.required(),o.hidden(),o.handler(), false, o.defaults());\r\n...\r\n\r\nand I am using an extended CmdLineParser that handles the defaults values. Unfortunately I am forced to use Reflection to access the \"options\" value in CmdLineParser.java (since it is private).\r\n\r\nIf you are interested I can provide the full source of my patch.",
