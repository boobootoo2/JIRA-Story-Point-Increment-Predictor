Here's the page:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/docs/v3.12.3/building.html\r\n\r\nThe documentation suggests using the following command-line options:\r\n\r\nmaven -Djira.build.bundle.plugins=false include-rpc-plugin war:webapp\r\n\r\nThis results in a build error.  As far as I can tell, the maven syntax should actually be:\r\n\r\nmaven -Djira.build.bundle.plugins=false -Dinclude-rpc-plugin=false war:webapp\r\n\r\nWhile you're there, it would also be nice to give some tip about setting an alternate repo to work around the lack of support for redirects in Maven 1.0.x:\r\n\r\nhttp://blogs.atlassian.com/developer/2006/12/maven_1_repository_changes.html\r\n\r\nAnyway, the new documentation looks great, wish there were a quick link to leave feedback like this, though... :)",

The email that we receive as a notification stating the ticket was created seems fine, it has all the information that was submitted (except for the ticket number), but when you click on the link (ticket number), it will be an outdated ticket.... It's very strange! \r\n{quote}\r\nand one more about subscription:\r\n{quote}\r\nOne of our users had a subscription set up that she had deleted, along with the filter used for the subscription, so both of these no longer exist. The subscription is still being sent on the schedule she had set up, and it's always the same old data. I posted a message on the forum but their ideas have not worked. Can anyone help me with this? I don't think there has been any info in the log on it, but I'll attach those just in case, along with one of the email subscriptions that was just sent last night.\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nPerhaps JIRA should:\r\n- on the Import page give option to manually enable the services after the restore, but by default disable them,\r\n- after restore list all disabled services,\r\n- display warning in the UI that services are disabled,\r\n- allow to manually enable the single services from the UI.",

I'd like to request adding the ability to specify a group not just one person.\r\n\r\nJustification:\r\nWe use JIRA on my team to provide support to designers.  Our component can be a single \"tool\" or a \"category\".  Regardless, often times, it's not just a single person who is supporting a particular \"component\"; it could be several people. I'd like to have the option of specifying a \"group\" (not just one person) in the \"Lead\" field so that issues are routed to that group automatically as they are filed, and not just to the \"Lead\".   In the absence of such feature, the \"Lead\" would have to continuously direct traffic and reassign issues to individual users.  This is unnecessary and time consuming.  We would like for JIRA to save us this time.\r\n\r\nThanks and regards,\r\nEddie Sneeh\r\nMarvell Semiconductor",

It should be noted that better practice is to use a separate box if possible.\r\n* It seems to mostly explain setting up a test upgrade, rather actually doing a real upgrade, but it is not clear which is which.\r\n* Section 5.2 \"Post-startup checks and tasks\", seems to be a mix-up of some final things to do when setting up a test instance, and tasks to change over the test to production.\r\n* \"If you changed machines when upgrading, change the paths to the indexes, attachments and backup directories, from within the Administration section of JIRA.\"\r\n  Actually, if you installed on a different machine, you may be able to use the same directories, however on the same machine you will definitely need to change these.",

      "description": "This doesn't have any visible issues for the user, however it is something we should address in the code soon or it may lead to some issues.  It appears that the mail code doesn't use the \"baseurl\" set via the VelocityRequestContext, but it has its own baseurl passed in.\r\n\r\nHere is one example: \r\n{code}\r\n mailingListCompiler.sendLists(recipientList, sender, getSenderFrom(event), emailSubject, templateId, (String) event.getParams().get(\"baseurl\"), getIssueContextParams(event), threader);\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nThe MailingListCompiler then uses a special method where the baseurl is passed along.  As far as I can tell, if contextParams already contains a baseurl it will override what's passed along:\r\n{code}\r\nString body = ManagerFactory.getVelocityManager().getEncodedBodyForContent(templateContent, baseUrl, contextParams);\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nIn the mail code however, the contextParams do not contain a 'baseurl', since they get created via the {{JiraMailQueueUtils}} class, which does not set the baseurl like the {{JiraVelocityUtils}} class.  \r\n\r\nOverall I think this is very confusing and *will* lead to bugs in the future.  I think we should:\r\n* Get rid of the JiraMailQueueUtils and replace them with JiraVelocityUtils\r\n* No longer call the method on the velocityManager that expects the baseUrl\r\n* Use the baseurl set in the VelocityRequestContext (Care needs to be taken that this has the right value)\r\n\r\n",
