Our analysis has shown that over time this issue hasn't collected a significant number of votes, watchers, comments, or support cases from customers and therefore has remained very low on our priority list. Given these findings we can conclude it will not be fixed in the foreseeable future and wish to be transparent about our priorities by closing it as *Timed Out*.\r\n\r\nWe understand that hearing a decision like this can be disappointing, but we hope you'll appreciate our transparent approach to product priorities and communications. We will continue to watch this issue for further updates, so please feel free to share any thoughts in the comments.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nMateusz Ostaszewski,\r\n\r\nSoftware Engineer\u00a0in Jira Server\r\n{panel}\r\nh3.

This particular issue has been causing us problems, forcing us to move an issue from one project to the intended project, but only if someone even noticed that an issue was created in the wrong project.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nI know that\u00a0JRASERVER-18199 was marked as *fixed* while\u00a0JRASERVER-1555 was marked as *won't fix*, which both seem to be related to this particular issue.\u00a0JRASERVER-18199 seems to be what's causing the issue described here, but that feature seems like it should only take effect if the *Create Another* checkbox is selected.\u00a0JRASERVER-1555 doesn't seem like the solution because it can be annoying to have to select a project every single time I create a ticket.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nWhat seems more intuitive is to just set the *Project* field based on the project for the issue/project that's currently being viewed in the active browser tab instead of setting it based on the last project that was *loaded*.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nUsing the example described in JRASERVER-36904,\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n # Open JIRA in 2 tabs\r\n # Go to the *first tab* and open *Project A*\r\n # Go the the *second tab* and open *Project B*\r\n # **Go back to the *first tab* and click *Create*\r\n # The selected project on the *Create Issue* screen will be\u00a0*Project B*\r\n # **Close the *Create Issue* screen\r\n # Refresh the *first tab* so the screen reloads\r\n # Click *Create* again\r\n # Now the selected project on the *Create Issue* screen will show *Project A* selected\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nBy setting the *Project* field based on the project that's being viewed in the active tab, this would help prevent a lot of headaches of having to hunt down issues that intended to be created for one project, but accidentally got created in another project. This would be especially helpful for teams who have *a lot* of projects.",

Issue Summary\r\n\r\nStarting in Jira 8.6 there's a new Cluster monitoring page available to Jira system administrators gathers real-time data such as node ID, address, uptime (since the last restart), load and memory. The page displays the information for active nodes in your cluster, so whenever a node is down it disappears from the list. \r\n\r\nHowever, when there are two old Hipchat classes in the {{pluginstate}} table, the Clustering page does not work as expected. There are no errors reported in the backend, but in the frontend, you can see a Javascript error in the browser Developer tools:\r\n\r\n !screenshot-1.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\n{code}\r\nUncaught Error: acm/app/models/node-collection missing ajs\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nh3.

There is a number of related cases when for all of them the root cause isn\u2019t found, for most of them DB manipulation/refreshing cache/re-adding directory and syncing it solved the problem.\r\n\r\nThis results in users unable to login, but flows/actions that could result in this state are plenty of. Mainly those are user login, directory Synchronisation.\r\n\r\nFor some customers that works only temporary so the workaround is done over and over again.\r\n\r\nInconsistency exists in DB between cwd_membership and cwd_user tables.\u00a0\r\nThe most probable reason of it is cache corruption. It was confirmed in 1\u00a0 case.\r\n\r\nThere is a KnowledgeBase article for that, number of cases with similar symptoms and the same workaround steps.\r\n[https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirakb/ldap-users-and-groups-display-unexpectedly-in-jira-server-776799341.html]\r\n\r\nThe biggest problem with pointing out the root cause is that problem show off with the delay(like a couple of months later), when there are no available logs providing information how data inconsistency was created (due to failed CRUD operation, or cache corruption -> that's why there are different workaround - manual DB update / new user-directory + resync & cache refresh)\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Problem is not yet reproducible\r\n # On affected/corrupted instances users are not able to login\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nAn active user is able to login.

Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Create a global transition in the workflow that transitions to itself in a project.\r\n # Go to all issues in that project and click \"Bulk Change\" > Select All or select a few Issues > Transition Issues. You will see multiple rows for the global transition created above.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nIdeally, there should be a single entry for the \"Available workflow action\" or a separate column indicating global transitions.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n#Confusing multiple rows for the global transition as shown in the screenshot. The user will not know if this is a global or local transition.\r\nh3.
