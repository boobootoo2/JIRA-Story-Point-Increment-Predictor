      "description": "{panel:bgColor=#e7f4fa}\n  *NOTE:* This suggestion is for *JIRA Server*. Using *JIRA Cloud*? [See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-11884].\n  {panel}\n\nAfter implementering Project Roles in JIRA 3.7 you have unfortunately introduced a _major_ security violation.\r\n\r\nIn earlier versions of JIRA the Administer Projects permission granted a user the right to edit a project, manage components and manage versions. In 3.7 this permission also grants the user the right to _Manage Project Role Membership._\r\n\r\nI know this is part of the idea behind introducing Project Roles. But it _must_ be possible to exclude users from this right even though they have the Administer Projects Permission. This could be done by introducing a Global Permission: \"Manage Project Role Membership\".\r\n\r\nIn our JIRA installation we have 12 JIRA administrators. The are the _only ones_ that are allowed to manage users and groups. We have a lot of Project Leads that are allowed to Administer Projects. They need to be able to manage components, versions and so on. We even have some _customers_ that are granted the Administer Projects permission because they run their own JIRA projects.\r\n\r\nThe problem that has been introduced is not so much, that a user with the Administer Projects permission can add a single user to a Project Role. I could live with that. The problem is, that they can also _add a group_. This means that a user by accident can add a wrong user to a project by giving them indirect access (via the group) without knowing it. The users with Administer Projects permissions have no way of knowing which users are in a given group. Only administrators can see this from the Group Browser.\r\n\r\nAnother is that the users can see the \"Assign Groups to Project Role\". Now the users can see all the groups in JIRA, not only the groups they are a member of. Users without the Global \"Browse Users\" permission (which also controls the ability to browse groups) should not be able to do this. In our JIRA installation groups represents customers. This means that some of our customers now can see the names of some of our other customers... not good...\r\n\r\nI urge you to fix this in a 3.7.x version a soon as possible. \r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nLars\r\n\r\nEdit: 2017-02-01\r\nh5. Slightly formalised summary\r\nAs Jira administrator I want to segregate two Permission: _Administer projects_ (current Permission) and _edit Roles_ (new Permission)\r\n* Project lead/administrator will not have ability to modify the roles (delegate permissions) but can manage their project for remaining admin functions\r\n",

Jira-users can only see that the project exists and the project leader. This sounds benign, but we have external partners and contractors that should not be able to know what other projects are being pursued. Experimentation revealed that using anything but a group to set \"Browse Projects\" produces the same undesirable results. \r\n\r\n  Am learning that Jira Enterprise is configurable to the Nth degree.

This happend to me where one of the date fields in the database contained the value 0000-00-00, the backup job would dump the tables up to the point where it read this record and then fail.  However, the backup job created a ZIP file anyway giving the impression that the backup was complete.  \r\n\r\nI was able to track down the problem by doing a manual database export using the GUI.  It generated an error message and by looking at the xml file, I was able to track down the problem to the table and record.\r\n\r\nI think that the scheduled backup should produce some warning when the job fails and most importantly should NOT create a resulting output file giving the impression that the job completed.\r\n\r\nThanks.",

For example, I improved my workflow to get rid of the Re-opened status, so 9 issues had to change from Re-opened to Open. In the change history, there is one entry for the workflow and status change, and the date has been updated.\r\n\r\nI can see the logic in doing so, but if you think about it, this really isn't a transition in the strict sense of workflows - it's an administrative change that does not reflect anyone touching the issue. So now, I have some issues that haven't been touched in months showing up on my most recently updated filter. Ugly. I can see this as being a gray area between bug and improvement, but IMHO it should not behave this way.\r\n\r\nBy the way, changing workflow only took about 3 minutes on 3.6.5 Tomcat 5.5 instead of about 1.5 hours (if it completed at all) on 3.6.3 Weblogic.\r\n\r\nP.S. I noticed you renamed the Test project to \"A Test project\" so it would come up first alphabetically. Try renaming it to \" Test Project\" where there is a blank in the first character - that does the same thing  ;)\r\n",

The Global Permissions can only be assigned to groups.  For things like Browse Users and Create Shared Filter where the default permission is jira-developers not having the roles means that we still have to create global groups to assign those permissions and then it has to be centrally managed.  Maybe these types of permissions could be pushed into the Project Permission schemes if using the roles does not make sense?",

I have a number of bugs that belong to more than one project, so I created a Project field in my CSV file with values like 'projA projB', 'projB projC', 'projD'.   My expectation was that there would be 4 projects created after this import, but instead I have one project created for each issue, as instead of splitting my string, JIRA took each string as a unique value.  No problem, I just rebuilt my CSV file.  BUT...\r\n\r\nNow I have a database with 116 projects, and I have to delete them all one by one!  \r\n\r\nWorse, I have the same problem with my Fix Versions and Applies to Versions fields, each of which now has over 1000 different values.  There seems to be no way to delete them 'en masse'.  So this feature would be very welcome. \r\n\r\nAlternatively, if you were to provide documentation on how to delete fields directly in the database, that would also be useful, since it will likely be an administrator doing this task, not a user. \r\n\r\nthanks\r\nS\r\n",

Then I edited my source and re-imported the data.  No issues were created!   This seems like a bug to me. I've checked the support forums and can find no other mention of this behaviour. \r\n\r\nEven though my All filter shows no issues, if I open the jiradb.script database file with a text editor, I can see all of the old issue data in there.

      "description": "Under certain circumstances on some application servers (this was observed on\r\nWebLogic 8.1), a 304 response can be closely followed by an empty content\r\npacket:\r\n\"0000\\r\\n\\r\\n\". For some reason, sometimes - not always, but reproducibly often\r\nenough - this gets interpretted as a 200 (as shown in LiveHeaders), and the\r\nbrowser then waits for the rest of the content. There is no further content\r\ncoming and eventually the server closes the socket, leaving the browser\r\ndisplaying the following (the bit in between the lines):\r\n----------------------------\r\n0000\r\n\r\nHTTP/1.1 304 Not Modified\r\nDate: Wed, 20 Dec 2006 06:24:02 GMT\r\n\r\n0000\r\n----------------------------\r\nThe server response is made up of two TCP packets, the first containing the 304\r\nand the second containing the empty content. If they are a single packet, the\r\nproblem cannot be reproduced. Turning off keep-alive and switching to HTTP 1.0\r\nalso appear to fix this (at least make it no longer visible!)\r\n\r\nBTW. I tried to file this on Mozilla core, but couldn't find the Bugzilla\r\nproduct. Please move over to there and to the Network:HTTP component if\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nI am going on holiday over christmas, any urgent follow up should be cc'd to\r\ndylan@atlassian.com\r\n\r\nReproducible: Sometimes\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n1. make request to dodgy web-server.\r\n2. web-server responds with 304 and then empty content packet.\r\nActual Results:  \r\nClient waits for server until socket is closed (20+ seconds), then shows the\r\n304 and content responses and as though they were the page content. If the\r\nrequest were for an image or javascript, the server tries to interpret them as\r\nsuch.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:  \r\nClient properly uses cached version of resource.\r\n\r\nThis was initially found in Firefox 2 on Ubuntu and Red Hat, confirmed on\r\nWindows in both version 2 and Minefield 3.0a1.\r\n\r\nThe following Java class acts as a very simple web-server hanging on port 8070\r\nand reproduces the problem. To use, point the browser to this port and then\r\nrefresh. For my Windows browser in VMWare, this could be reproduced after only\r\na couple of refreshes, on the Ubuntu host, it took up to 20 refreshes before\r\nbeing seen, but was still always reproducible.\r\n---------------\r\n{code:java}\r\n\r\n/**\r\n * Simple server that returns an HTTP Response 200 on a socket and subsequently\r\nreturns 304s with a follow-up empty\r\n * chunk.

Means you have to scroll all the way to the bottom every time you want to add one. Also, its inconsistant with the other admin pages which have the \"Add\" at the top.\r\n\r\n* Adding a new Permission Scheme takes you back to the Permission Scheme list on successful creation. 99 times out of 100, the very next thing you want to do with your newly created permission scheme is edit the permissions. Adding a new Permission Scheme _should_ take you to the \"Edit Permission Scheme\" page.. .",
