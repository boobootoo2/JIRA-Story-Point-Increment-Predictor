Issue Summary\r\n\r\nAfter changing/updating the \"CDN URL\" property (Admin \u2192 System\u00a0\u2192 Content Delivery Network) with a new URL, I noticed that some resources were still being requested by my browser which referenced the prior CDN URL, even with the browser's cache disabled or when using incognito windows. On further investigation, I found that these assets were being requested as downstream components by CSS and JS via URLs referencing the old CDN, even when loaded directly from Jira (bypassing new CDN). E.g.: when _batch.css_ is loaded from new CDN or directly from Jira, it contains references to static asset _adgs-icons.woff_ on old CDN.\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Configure Jira with a CDN URL for the Content Delivery Network feature\r\n # Browse some pages (issues, dashboards, etc) on Jira to ensure static assets which reference the CDN are created and cached by Jira\r\n # Configure Jira with a new, different CDN URL\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nNo requests should be made to load assets from the previously-configured CDN URL.\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nBrowse some pages (issues, dashboards, etc) and view network traffic via the web inspector tool; see that some resources are still requested from previously-configured CDN.\r\n\r\nThis can also be seen by directly viewing the files located at {{$JIRA_HOME/tmp/webresources}} which will contain said references to files on the old CDN.\r\nh3.

Issue Summary\r\n\r\nSome field values automatically clear when leaving a required field empty when creating issues from Admin mode, but when using the Create Issue pop-up window the behaviour does not occur. \r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n# Creating a new issue out of Admin mode pops up a Create Issue window, where unfilled required fields will be notified:\r\n#* !createpopup.png|thumbnail!\r\n# Creating a new issue from Admin mode (e.g. from Administration -> Issues) will not pop up a Create Issue window, instead, the process will go through 2 phases:\r\n#* !createadmin.png|thumbnail!\r\n#* !createerror.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\n# Step 1: Click \"Create Issue\" so that you are navigated to a separate browser tab (not pop-up).\r\n# Step 2: Fill the section with \"Linked Issues\". At the same time, leave any required field as empty.\r\n# Step 3: Click \"create\".\r\n# Step 4: Jira shows that some required field must be filled.\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nThe point is, other field values will be remained if already filled, including Epic Link, Sprint, and Linked Issues:\r\n!createremain.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nJIRA clears field with linked issues. The point is, if required fields are unfilled (and the page refreshes), then specific fields will lose their filled value or even go missing. In the following screenshot, Epic Link, Sprint, and Linked Issues are losing their filled value (automatically cleared) while Remaining Estimate is missing:\r\n!createcleared.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nh3. Note\r\n\r\nThis problem is not reproduced while trying to create an issue from pop-up \u2013 in this case, JIRA saves all filled linked issues as expected.\r\n\r\nh3.

      "description": "h3. Issue Summary\r\n\r\nThe Atlassian Analytics plugin prevents Tomcat from cleanly shutting down, as it leaves \"Analytics\" non-daemon threads that are not able to be stopped by the shutdown process.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThis results in the message in the log always, regardless of the shutdown timeout:\r\n{code:java}\r\nTomcat did not stop in time.\r\nTo aid diagnostics a thread dump has been written to standard out.\r\nKilling Tomcat with the PID: 12726\r\nThe Tomcat process has been killed. {code}\r\n*Impact*\r\n If Tomcat is able to shutdown all threads except for the Analytics threads, there is no impact.\r\n\r\nThe concern is that this problem will mask an administrators ability to set the shutdown value correctly since Jira will never cleanly shutdown. If Jira terminated while shutting down but is actually doing some useful operation, there may be a risk that operation is terminated half way through. Therefore, we should always aim for a graceful shutdown. Also, it will delay the shutdown time as the script will always wait for the timeout value to be reached before existing.\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # On Jira 8.5.3, *Jira Admin -> System -> Analytics -> Enable*\r\n # Edit {{JIRAINST/bin/stop-jira.sh}}\u00a0and modify the shutdown timeout on following two lines to 300. This allows enough time for Tomcat to attempt a clean shutdown\r\n{code:java}\r\nexec $PRGDIR/shutdown.sh 300 -force $@\r\n$sucmd -m $JIRA_USER -c \"$PRGDIR/shutdown.sh 300 -force $@\"{code}\r\n\r\n # On the console, execute {{JIRAINST/bin/stop-jira.sh}}\r\n # The script will wait 300 seconds, then eventually terminate due to stuck Analytics threads:\r\n{code:java}\r\nThe Tomcat process has been killed.  {code}\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nJira shuts down cleanly without having to be killed:\r\n{code:java}\r\nTomcat stopped.{code}\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nThe script will wait indefinitely for Tomcat to shutdown until the timeout value in stop-jira.sh has been reached. The script will then forcefully kill tomcat\r\n{code:java}\r\nTomcat did not stop in time.\r\nTo aid diagnostics a thread dump has been written to standard out.\r\nKilling Tomcat with the PID: 12726\r\nThe Tomcat process has been killed.{code}\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n{{org.apache.catalina.loader.WebappClassLoaderBase.clearReferencesThreads()}} will alert that Analytics threads to not stop, and a thread dump will be written to catalina.out showing the non-daemon Analytics threads:\r\n{code:java}\r\n07-Apr-2020 11:28:14.660 WARNING [localhost-startStop-2] org.apache.catalina.loader.WebappClassLoaderBase.clearReferencesThreads The web application [j853] appears to have started a thread named [Analytics] but has failed to stop it.

      "description": "h3. Problem Definition\r\nIn a lot of cases, Jira\u2019s Java API returns the object as a mutable object. Sometimes API returns it as immutable interface implementation, but due to dynamic-typing transformation in Groovy code, it can just bypass the interface. \r\n\r\nThis could lead to problems with data consistency when executing the Groovy code, for example: assigning a value to the _Issue Status_ (operator \u2018=') rather than the equivalence operator (\u2019=='). \r\nIn other words, the end-user _can modify arbitrary Java memory object in the heap through Groovy code_.\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\nModify Jira API for critical actions and return immutable objects to protect the application state. \r\n\r\nh3. Some examples to illustrate the problem\r\nAn example of how Groovy can violate the API contract \r\n* Given these two files:\r\n{code:Java|borderStyle=solid}\r\ninterface ImmutableCachedObject {\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass CachedObject implements ImmutableCachedObject {\r\n    void changeObm() {\r\n        throw new UnsupportedOperationException();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    static ImmutableCachedObject getObject() {\r\n        return new CachedObject();\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n{code}\r\n* from Java API perspective, the object is immutable. What Groovy code does is:\r\n{code:Java|borderStyle=solid}\r\nimport groovy.transform.TypeChecked\r\nimport CachedObject\r\n\r\nvoid test() {\r\n    CachedObject.getObject().breakJira()\r\n}\r\n\r\ntest()\r\n{code}\r\n** When you run it, you get:\r\n{code:Java|borderStyle=solid}\r\nCaught: java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException: You broke Jira.\r\njava.lang.UnsupportedOperationException: You broke Jira.\r\n\tat CachedObject.breakJira(CachedObjectImpl.java:3)\r\n\tat test.test(test.groovy:6)\r\n\tat test.run(test.groovy:9)\r\n{code}\r\n** (!) it bypasses the static type guarantees that Jira API offers \r\n*  if this code did static type checking (note the annotation):\r\n{code:Java|borderStyle=solid}\r\nimport groovy.transform.TypeChecked\r\nimport CachedObject\r\n\r\n@TypeChecked\r\nvoid test() {\r\n    CachedObject.getObject().breakJira()\r\n}\r\n\r\ntest()\r\n{code}\r\n** you get:\r\n{code:Java|borderStyle=solid}\r\norg.codehaus.groovy.control.MultipleCompilationErrorsException: startup failed:\r\n/private/tmp/aaa/test.groovy: 6: [Static type checking] - Cannot find matching method ImmutableCachedObject#breakJira().

We have more than 10 components and therefore a multiple number of releases in our project, so it is difficult to find the right releases to set to another status and keep the list tidy.

If the terms are found at all in the records being searched, the issue is always returned.  This does not allow for more restrictive search queries, such as specific word orders.   \r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\nIf Jira supported [regular expressions (regex)|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression] in JQL queries it would easily be possible to do this.  \r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Why this is important\r\nThis would provide a much more comprehensive means to search for issues in Jira. regex is already a popular means to search for records in many libraries.\r\nHaving this option would also be beneficial to various other kinds of requested searching of Jira issues, which in turn would make things like filter results, and the subsequent dashboards gadgets based on those filters much more powerful, flexible, and potentially concise in the information they can return to users.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround \r\nThe use of regular expressions (aka regex) is not currently possible to use in native Jira.  However there are 3rd party add-ons in Marketplace that make this possible today.  For example Scriptrunner has a number of these functions that accept regex queries in order to return issues in Jira. One example of this is [issueFieldMatch|https://scriptrunner.adaptavist.com/latest/jira/jql-functions.html#_issuefieldmatch]",

Issue Summary\r\nWhen creating a project version, The Java API method [VersionManager.createVersion|https://docs.atlassian.com/software/jira/docs/api/latest/com/atlassian/jira/project/version/VersionManager.html#createVersion-java.lang.String-java.util.Date-java.util.Date-java.lang.String-java.lang.Long-java.lang.Long-boolean-] does not check if there are versions with the same name in the project. This may result in duplicate version names and can cause bigger issues. \r\n\r\nThe method should now allow the creation of duplicate versions, especially that the JIRA REST API enforces uniqueness on versions names per project. \r\n\r\nSince this seems to be an omission, it's logged as a bug. \r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n* Use the method in a Groovy script to create a project version with the same name as an existing one. \r\n* Groovy scripts can be executed in Jira via the ScirptRunner app. \r\n* Here's a Groovy script to duplicate all versions: \r\n{code:java|title=duplicate_versions.groovy|borderStyle=solid|borderColor=#6a8eb3|titleBGColor=#f8f8f8|bgColor=#f8f8f8}\r\nimport com.atlassian.jira.component.ComponentAccessor\r\nimport com.atlassian.jira.project.Project\r\nimport com.atlassian.jira.project.version.Version\r\n\r\nlog.warn(\"starting\")\r\ndef projectManager = ComponentAccessor.getProjectManager()\r\ndef versionManager = ComponentAccessor.getVersionManager()\r\ndef user = ComponentAccessor.getJiraAuthenticationContext().getLoggedInUser()\r\ndef projects = projectManager.getProjects()\r\n\r\ndef versions = versionManager.getAllVersionsForProjects(projects, true)\r\nfor (version in versions) {\r\n    log.warn(version.getName() + \", \" + version.getId() + \"), \" + version.getProject().getName() + \" (\" + version.getProject().getId() + \")\")\r\n    versionManager.createVersion(version.getName(),version.getStartDate(), version.getReleaseDate(), version.getDescription(), version.getProject().getId(), version.getId(), version.isReleased())\r\n    log.warn(version.getName() + \", \" + version.getId() + \"), \" + version.getProject().getName() + \" (\" + version.getProject().getId() + \")\")\r\n    \r\n}\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nJira shouldn't allow duplicate project versions to created and the script should exit with an exception. \r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nDuplicate project versions are created. \r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\nThird-party app developers should program defensively and check for the existence of versions with the same name before creating new ones. \r\n",

If the field content is close to or meets the character limit, you will be unable to make any edits to the issue in the UI; the validator will throw an error indicating that the text entered for that custom field is too long.\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Create a new multi-line text custom field and add it field scheme of test project\r\n # Create a new test issue\r\n # Import the attached repro1.txt file via REST. You can copy and paste the Curl command from attached curl1.txt, substitute username, custom field ID, and issue key as needed.\r\n # View the newly-created record in the *customfieldvalue* table and check the character count:\r\n{code:sql}\r\nselect textvalue from customfieldvalue where id  = (select max(id) from customfieldvalue);\r\n\r\nselect length(textvalue) from customfieldvalue where id  = (select max(id) from customfieldvalue);\r\n{code}\r\n\r\n # Attempt to edit the issue in the UI, note the validation error indicating the field data is too long.\r\n # Create another test issue\r\n # Import the attached repro2.txt file via REST. You can copy and paste the Curl command from attached curl2.txt, substitute username, custom field ID, and issue key as needed. This is a much smaller file to demonstrate the injection of the carriage returns to the data.\r\n # Check the record and character count:\r\n{code:sql}\r\nselect textvalue from customfieldvalue where id  = (select max(id) from customfieldvalue);\r\n\r\nselect length(textvalue) from customfieldvalue where id  = (select max(id) from customfieldvalue);\r\n{code}\r\n\r\n # Navigate to the issue in the UI and edit the text in the the custom field to append a final \".\" character.\r\n # Check the record and character count again\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nIn the first test, Jira should allow you to save changes to the issue as the custom field data is at the limit.\r\n\r\nIn the second test, the character count of the field should only increment by 1.\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nIn the first test, Jira serializes the \"\\r\" characters into the field data, causing it to exceed the character count.\r\n\r\nIn the second test, you can see this character injection when reviewing the data in the customfield. The character count has grown more than the expected single character and you can now see the \"\\r\" characters injected into the data.\r\nh3.

      "description": "We recommend creating a test and dev instances of\u00a0Jira prod data. This helps our Enterprise customers test upgrades and features, workarounds and fixes, I'd say \"have you vetted this in a lower environment?\" is one of the most common phrases I use.\u00a0 The problem arises is we only take safety precautions in regard to the mail, we can set a flag in the JVM\r\n{code:java}\r\n-Datlassian.mail.senddisabled\r\n-Datlassian.mail.fetchdisabled\r\n-Datlassian.mail.popdisabled {code}\r\nor we can disable it upon XML restore. But this still leaves the mail server and handler data in the DB and any admin can easily re-enable these mail servers.\u00a0\r\n\r\n*There are other concerns when refreshing data:*\r\n * DVCS syncs\r\n * applinks\u00a0\r\n * cache replication issues if prod and dev can communicate over 40001 and 40011\r\n * index replication if you're doing a DB dump Jira has several bugs where it will continue to try to communicate to \"offline or inactive\" nodes even though they cannot reach the DB see\u00a0\u00a0  !https://jira.atlassian.com/secure/viewavatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=51505&avatarType=issuetype! JRASERVER-42916\u00a0-\u00a0Stale node ids should automatically be removed in Jira Data Center\u00a0IN PROGRESS\u00a0\u00a0for more information, this can even lead to dev indexing showing up in the admin/index section in other environments\u00a0\r\n\r\nh2. Suggested Action:\u00a0\r\n\r\nPerhaps we could create a \"lower environment\" exporter or importer that strips the following from the export or import or a startup/setup task that can be run manually.\r\n * DVCS data\r\n * applinks\u00a0\r\n * cluster node tables\u00a0\r\n * mail server info and mail handlers\r\n\r\nh2. Workaround for Manual DB refreshes:\u00a0\r\n\r\nIf you're _not_ using JIRA's XML you can do the following, if you're using an XML restore, you can perform the following after importing the data and stopping Jira.\r\n # Refresh the data from prod to lower environment\r\n # run the following _before_ starting Jira\r\n\r\nh2. Index related tables for Data Center:\r\n\r\nTruncate the following tables:\r\n{code:xml}\r\nclusternode\r\nclusternodeheartbeat\r\nreplicatedindexoperation\r\n{code}\r\nh2. Mail server info\r\n\r\n1. Delete all incoming and outgoing mail servers by truncating the following table:\r\n{code:java}\r\nmailserver{code}\r\n2. Remove mail handlers\r\n{code:java}\r\ndelete from serviceconfig where clazz='com.atlassian.jira.service.services.mail.MailFetcherService'{code}\r\nh2.

Find the applink ids:\r\n{code:java}\r\nSELECT SUBSTR(a.property_key,16,36) as \"Application Key\", b.propertyvalue as \"Application Name\" FROM propertyentry a join propertystring b on a.id=b.id where a.property_key like 'applinks.admin%name';{code}\r\n2. After identifying the application key of the application that requires removing using the above SQL in the diagnosis section, run the following queries exactly in this order, you'll also need to run these for _each_ result from query 1.\r\n{code:java}\r\nDELETE FROM oauthspconsumer WHERE consumer_key IN (SELECT propertyvalue FROM propertystring WHERE id IN (SELECT id FROM propertyentry WHERE property_key LIKE 'applinks.%resultsfromfirstquery%'));\r\n-- NOTE: For Microsoft SQLServer use the following query:\r\nDELETE FROM oauthspconsumer WHERE consumer_key IN (SELECT CONVERT(NVARCHAR(MAX), propertyvalue) FROM propertystring WHERE id IN (SELECT id FROM propertyentry WHERE property_key LIKE 'applinks.%resultsfromfirstquery%'));{code}\r\n{code:java}\r\nDELETE FROM oauthconsumertoken WHERE token_key LIKE '%resultsfromfirstquery%';{code}\r\n{code:java}\r\nDELETE FROM oauthconsumertoken WHERE token_key LIKE '%resultsfromfirstquery%';\r\nDELETE FROM trustedapp WHERE application_id IN (SELECT propertyvalue FROM propertystring WHERE id IN (SELECT id FROM propertyentry WHERE property_key LIKE 'applinks.%resultsfromfirstquery%')); \r\n-- NOTE: For Microsoft SQLServer use the following query:\r\nDELETE FROM trustedapp WHERE application_id IN (SELECT CONVERT(NVARCHAR(MAX), propertyvalue) FROM propertystring WHERE id IN (SELECT id FROM propertyentry WHERE property_key LIKE 'applinks.%resultsfromfirstquery%'));{code}\r\n{code:java}\r\nDELETE FROM propertystring WHERE id IN (SELECT id FROM propertyentry WHERE property_key LIKE 'applinks.%resultsfromfirstquery%');{code}\r\n{code:java}\r\nDELETE FROM propertyentry WHERE property_key LIKE 'applinks.admin.resultsfromfirstquery1%';{code}\r\n{code:java}\r\nUPDATE propertystring SET propertyvalue = REPLACE(propertyvalue,'\\n2c66970e-35f8-365f-bc65-f535d7edf1a1','') where id in (select id from propertyentry where property_key like 'applinks.global%'); {code}\r\nh2.

IF the LDAP directory has many groups this can turn into an issue:\r\nIf one of these connections run into the timeout, then the entire sync is halted somewhere in the middle. This is quite bad in grand scheme of things, as sometimes 1% of the groups are skipped, sometimes 99% and other times somewhere inbetween.\r\n\r\nThere are two scenarios that could be thought of to avoid this:\r\n * be able to configure a \"Retry count\", if a connection times out, then rety X number of times.\r\n * be able to configure the import to reuse the same connection for all group lookups. That way it is more of a \"all or nothing\" success. This should default to off to retain todays behaviour as some environment will depend on it, but for environments where the entire \"truth\" is found in one directory this would be a massive performance gain.",
