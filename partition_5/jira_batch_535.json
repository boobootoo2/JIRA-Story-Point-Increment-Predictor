There are scenarios where the customer wants to change the priority. Today they can only request this by submitting a comment and hoping that the agent acts on it. We have rules/automation that result in escalation notification if priority is set to Urgent/Highest. If the agent doesn't act on, or does so in a delayed manner, then the notification does not occur or is delayed.\n\nThere may be a workaround here though ugly (I need to test this). Transitions could be created in the workflow for each priority level setting the transition from \"All\". Then expose each of these transitions on the portal. The customer could then click on the transitions, e.g.\n* Priority = Highest\n* Priority = High\n* Priority = Medium\n* Priority = Low\n* Priority = Lowest\n\nagain...yuck!",

We typically have a major server release very 3-5 months and our last major server release (3.2) was in August so it should be available soon.\n\nThe feature will be identical to the one available on cloud right now and I will provide an update again when the server release is out.\n\nThanks,\n JIRA Service Desk team\n{panel}\n\u00a0\n\n---JSD-270--- introduced customer organizations to cloud.

If a sender of an email has TNEF enabled, the email sent (and received by the mail handler) will be TNEF-encoded\n\nQuoting from Outlooks KB: https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/290809\n{quote} A TNEF-encoded message contains a plain text version of the message, and a binary attachment that \"packages\" various other parts of the original message. In most cases, the binary attachment is named Winmail.dat, and may include the following information: \n* The formatted text version of the message (for example, font information and colors).\n* OLE objects (for example, embedded pictures and embedded Microsoft Office documents).\n* Special Outlook features (for example, custom forms, voting buttons, and meeting requests).\n* Regular file attachments that were added to the original message.{quote}\n\nThe following is quoted from the same article above as well\n{quote}*Sending and Receiving Concerns*\nWhen an e-mail client that does not understand TNEF receives a message that contains TNEF information, the following are the three common results:\n* The plain text version of the message is received and it contains an attachment named Winmail.dat. The Winmail.dat attachment does not contain any useful information when you open it because it is in the special TNEF format.\n* Note: Some users have reported receiving a Win.dat attachment.{quote}\n\nThis is exactly what is happening to JSD mail handler at the moment. If a user sends an email with attachment using Outlook with TNEF enabled, the message is added to the ticket just fine, but Winmail.dat will be attached to the ticket, instead of the original intended attachment\n\nh3. Suggestion\nHave the mail handler understand TNEF to decode Winmail.dat and attach the proper attachment",

Am happy to share that we have now actively picked up this ticket and will be resolving it shortly. Will provide another update when we're done.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThanks for all those who offered to talk to us, we've spoken to some folks and are good to go with the solution for this problem.\r\n\r\nBe in touch soon\r\n\r\nLiron and Jira Service Desk team\u00a0\r\n{panel}\r\nh3. \u00a0\r\nh3. Problem Definition\r\n\r\nThe customer creates an issue (without paying attention to the bottom of the customer portal) and this issue is being shared within their organization.\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n\r\n1. To turn off the Request Sharing within the user's Organization.\r\n 2. To change the default setting: Private or Shared\r\n for the issues being created via both the email channel and the customer portal.\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nCreate a \"dummy\" organization and add all customers to it, so when raising a ticket through the customer portal the private will be the default. When customers have only one organization, the default is to share with the organization and when the customers have two or more organizations, the default is private.\r\n * Side effect of this workaround: all customers will have access to each other's ticket since they are part of the same organization. You can simply create an [issue security scheme|https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiracloud/configuring-issue-level-security-776636711.html] with the following option and defaulting to it on creation:\r\n|*Security Level:*\r\n Private View|*Description:* Customers can access issues only they raised regardless of Organizations.|*Roles/Groups Applicable to* Current assignee, Project Role (Service Desk Team), Reporter, (Any other group/project role that requires access to the ticket)|\r\n\r\nIf a customer wants to share with an organization, they must request it from the Service Desk (e.g. in the ticket saying I want to share it with my organization) and the agent can simply *edit the security level dropdown* in the ticket to set it *None*. The ticket will still be logged within the organization and available for reporting.",

The idea is these alerts or notices can then be sent to service staff instead of one member having to forward the emails just to get lost in someones inbox.\nhowever as the appliances do not have incoming email and often don't even have real addresses (some send from servername@local.local) we would like to setup the project to never send emails (setup account, new issue, comments, resolved) to the \"customers\" instead just to accept the email and create an event. I tried changing notifications to none but it is still sending some. is there anyway at all to disable these? ",

We've added the option to make your portals login-free, so customers can:\r\n * browse knowledge base articles in the portal without logging in\r\n * read linked articles without logging in\r\n * find knowledge base articles via search engines\r\n\r\nTo learn more about login-free portals and set up your own, [check out our release blog|https://confluence.atlassian.com/servicedeskcloud/blog/2017/04/introducing-the-login-free-portal].\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nThe JIRA Service Desk Team\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\nIf an agent shares a knowledge base article with a customer and that article is anonymously accessible, then allow customers to view it without logging in to the JSD portal.\r\n\r\nThis is a common scenario for email requests, where the customer does not necessarily know how to log into the portal.\r\n\r\n*Steps:*\r\n # Create a KB link from a Service Desk project to an anonymously accessible Confluence space\r\n # As a customer, create a request on the portal\r\n # As an agent, in agent view, view the request and search for an article in the *Related knowledge base articles* panel and view it\r\n # Use the \"Share as comment\" button to share the KB article with the customer (note: the link looks something like \".../servicedesk/customer/kb/view/...\")\r\n\r\n*Desired outcome:*\r\n\r\nThe customer can click on the link to the shared article and view it without logging in.\r\n\r\n*Actual outcome:*\r\n\r\nThe customer is presented with the JSD portal login screen before they can view the article (if not already logged in).\r\n\r\n*Workaround:*\r\n\r\nIf the KB article is viewed in Confluence (not embedded inside the JSD portal), the user will not have to log in.\r\n\r\nAgents can get a link to the underlying Confluence page by opening the search results in a new tab or copying the address.\r\n\r\n!Screen Shot 2016-10-05 at 8.58.58 AM.png|width=600!",

We have just implemented this feature and is now available on your JIRA Service Desk cloud instance. For more information please read though our documentations here: [https://confluence.atlassian.com/servicedeskcloud/blog/2016/11/change-organization-for-multiple-issues|https://confluence.atlassian.com/servicedeskcloud/blog/2016/11/change-organization-for-multiple-issues]\u00a0:)\u00a0\n\nCheers,\n JIRA Service Desk team\n{panel}\n\u00a0\n\nI'd like to be able to bulk edit all of my service desk tickets and assign an organization to them. Love the new feature but don't see any automated way to assign an organization, thus existing tickets are not shared.",

Problem Definition\nThere seems to be some confusion around LDAP users being used as customers, especially if we look at JSD-1015.\n\nh3. Suggested Solution\nCurrently this is allowed, specifically you can do it with the following:\n\n# Restrict customer portal access to role-based.\n# Configure a role to have a certain group.\n# Add LDAP users to that group and sync.\n# Those users will now be treated as customers.\n\nIf we don't want them to consume licenses, they can be removed from the application access groups that are configured and only be a member of the appropriate JSD customer group.\n \nh3. Note\nThis is only for JIRA Server. If you are using JIRA On-Demand, then it's not possible and please refer to [JSD-1015|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSD-1015].",

Summary\nIt is possible to saved a broken filter to a queue when the JQL query returns an uncaught exception. This causes the Queues view to display no queues and prevent the creation of new queues.\n\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\n# Create a queue with a valid filter. e.g: {{resolution  =  Unresolved}}\n# Edit the queue\n# Change to  {{resolution  > Unresolved}}\n# Save queue\n\nh3. Expected Results\nThe queue is not saved and a message is displayed indicating the the JQL filter is invalid.\n\nh3. Actual Results\nThe screen doesn't change as if the \"Save\" didn't work but the filter was saved in the background.\nLoading the queues again shows no queues.\n\nh3. Notes:\nThe problem is actually caused by an Uncaught exception returned by JIRA when searching {{resolution < unresolved}} but JIRA Service Desk could prevent the JQL to be saved in these scenarios. JSD correctly prevents the saving a JQL that is invalid if it doesn't error.\n\nh3.Workaround\nFind the queues on the project:\n{noformat}\nSELECT * from \"AO_54307E_QUEUE\" where \"PROJECT_ID\" in (select id from project where pkey = '<PKEY>');\n{noformat}\nFind the filter that is broken by searching JIRA using the same JQL\nUpdate the queue in the database to a working JQL.\n\n",

While the cloud version already has the functionality to set up approvals. I'm referring to [https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiracloud/configuring-jira-service-desk-approvals-815569154.html].\n\nWhat I would like to know, can you share your expectation when this function will be available?\nDo you also know what will be the version of the Service Desk with the functionality for setting up approvals? We are now on JIRA Service Desk 3.1.9.\n\nThanks in advance,\n\nBest Regards,\n\nWim van Oorspronk\n\n",
