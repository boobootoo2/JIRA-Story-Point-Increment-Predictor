Summary\r\nRequired fields are not set when Issue Type is changed by an Inline Edit.\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Environment\r\n* 5.2.11, 6.0.8, 6.1.5, 6.2.4, 7.1-OD-01 \r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Take a standard JIRA installation and add a field, e.g. \"Detection Phase\", to Bug issue type. Make the field required in the field configuration.\r\n# Create an issue of some other type.\r\n# Change the type to Bug via inline edit.\r\n# Result: The required field has no value.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nRequired fields are propmted to be updated\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nIssue type can be changed via inline edit and required fields are not populated.\r\nAnother example: Changing an issue type to Epic via inline edit does not require an \"Epic Name\" to be set\r\n \r\nh3.Workaround\r\n- Use the *More* > *Move* Function to change the issue type\r\n\r\nh3. Note\r\n\r\nThat the same issue occurs when an issue type is changed via the *Edit Issue* screen. For example, when an issue type is changed from Story to Epic via the *Edit Issue* screen, the *Epic Name* field is not displayed in the screen even though it is a mandatory field for Epics. As a result, the issue is converted from a Story to an Epic without having any *Epic Name* set.\r\nSimilar issue described in JRASERVER-36946",

The content of such protocol would be for example:\r\n(with PO being the product owner, DEV being a specific developer)\r\n\r\n2012-01-13 | PO | Feature request received via phone by customer X\r\n2012-01-28 | PO |  Mail PO->customer: We need a workshop.\r\n2012-01-28 | PO | Internal discussion with DEV and  .... for creating offer\r\n2012-03-28 | PO | Customer says this is urgent, needs offer until ....\r\n2012-03-30 | PO | Workshop held with customer, results see Confluence page XYZ\r\n2012-04-05 | PO | Grooming finished\r\n2012-04-08 | PO | Offer sent, specification see Confuence page  XYZ2\r\n2012-04-10 | PO | Customer accepts offer\r\n2012-04-15 | DEV | Work started\r\n2012-04-17 | DEV | Discussion with customer about detail of specification: Customer wants 4 instead of 3 colums in report.\r\n2012-04-17 | PO | Change request accepted.\r\n2012-04-27 | DEV2 | Internal test and review of code successful\r\n2012-04-27 | DEV | Delivery to customer\r\n2012-05-10 | PO | Mail to customer: Tests done already? Can we finish issue? Waiting for feedback.\r\n2012-05-12 | DEV | Customer installed and tested product\r\n2012-05-12 | PO | Invoice sent by mail to Mr XYZ\r\n\r\nI think you get the picture.\r\nThere are several of  these entries which could be automatically created by JIRA, such as status changes (e.g, open->test->resolved), but often additional information is needed, such as about the content/result of a discussion or phone call.\r\n\r\nWe are aware that we could do all this using \"comments\", but given that comments are not exactly \"compact\", each being put into a separate box with header above, the rather compact protocol example given above wouldn't be as clear any more. This becomes especially a problem if comments also include detailed developer discussions, the complete content of mails sent etc.\r\n\r\nCurrently we have resorted to a long text field for entering the protocol. While generally suitable, this has following shortcomings:\r\n- Anybody can edit protocol entries by any other person\r\n- It can happen by accident, that parts or the complete field are emptied.\r\n- People cannot agree on one common formatting\r\n(- The list partly duplicates information shown in the JIRA issues' status change list)\r\n\r\nIdeally it would be possible to add and manage protocol entries for an issue just the way comments are created and issues, but the protocol entries would appear in a compact list separate from the comments in a far more prominent location than at the end of the issue screen. Furthermore relevant status changes would automatically be added to the protocol by JIRA.",

I found some Atlassian Answers that explain this has something to do with the cascading select, but I don't know what the issue actually IS. We did add new fields recently, including some cascading select. We have rebuilt our index since then. I am not clear what's actually WRONG with those fields.

Hovering over the lozenge shows the status name.\r\n\r\nThis is a problem because a user can no longer distinguish between two subtasks with different statuses but the same category when viewing the list of subtasks in the parent task. They now have to hover over each subtask's lozenge. With more than a couple of subtasks this is unusable.\r\n\r\nAlso, https://developer.atlassian.com/design/latest/colors.html says \"Don't rely on color alone to convey state or meaning\" and this change clearly breaks that.\r\n\r\n ",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-36135].\r\n{panel}\r\nSince MySQL 5.5+, there is support for 4 byte characters. JIRA is capable of handling these characters when using other databases. Due to some limitations in how MySQL is implemented, JIRA won't just work by setting the 4 byte encoding utf8mb4. MySQL's InnoDB engine is limited to a maximum size of 767 bytes for any field used in an index, and there are various places in JIRA that use a VARCHAR(255) field in an index. This means that JIRA will encounter an error such as the below if you try to simply install into an utf8mb4 database:\r\n{code:none}\r\n2013-10-30 11:43:23,723 localhost-startStop-1 ERROR      [core.entity.jdbc.DatabaseUtil] SQL Exception while executing the following:\r\nCREATE TABLE cwd_directory_attribute (directory_id DECIMAL(18,0) NOT NULL, attribute_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL, attribute_value VARCHAR(255), CONSTRAINT PK_cwd_directory_attribute PRIMARY KEY (directory_id, attribute_name))\r\nError was: com.mysql.jdbc.exceptions.jdbc4.MySQLSyntaxErrorException: Specified key was too long; max key length is 767 bytes\r\n{code}\r\nA full list of InnoDB restrictions including this one is listed at [http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/innodb-restrictions.html]\r\n\r\nNow that MySQL 5.7 supports utf8mb4 better, the main restriction is actually that you need to set the server encoding and JDBC URL such that the connection uses the right encoding. This is documented in workaround 2 below.\r\nh3. Workaround 1\r\n\r\nYou can switch to another of the databases supported by Jira like PostgreSQL following the guide [Switching database - Migrating JIRA's data to a different type of database server|https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiraserver071/switching-databases-802592192.html#Switchingdatabases-differenttype]. If you are having problems parsing the XML backup, then you could process the data manually and remove any 4 byte characters before importing to avoid the problem. If difficulties persist, you can reach out to Atlassian Support for assistance or to the Atlassian community.\r\nh3. Workaround 2\r\n\r\nUpgrade to JIRA 7.3 or later versions which MySQL 5.7 is supported. MySQL 5.7.9 defaults the table row format to {{DYNAMIC}} which supports indexes longer than 767 bytes and it works well with {{utf8mb4}} collation. For more information, please refer to this KB article: [https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirakb/emojis-and-special-characters-for-jira-with-mysql-952604493.html]\r\n * It is important to mention that this involves a configuration that is not supported and we cannot guarantee it will work for everyone and the reason to include it here is for users who have no choice but to use MySQL as their database to have an additional option.",

In our system some of our issues get created out of emails automatically. I need for every issue to be linked to an epic, so i need the ability to set the epic link automatically during creation. \r\n\r\nI know that this should be possible through scripting, but i could not find a way to set the epic link through a script. Your support team acknowledged that this is not possible out of the box but was not willing to help me with scripting it. So that\u00b4s why i kindly ask you now to integrate it into JIRA.\r\n\r\nThank your very much\r\n\r\nRegards \r\nChristoph",

This bug *only* affects instances that were exported from OnDemand into 5.2.11.\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\nh3.

Workaround\r\n\r\n# Backup the 5.2.11 instance.\r\n# Stop JIRA.\r\n# Remove the {{app_user}} records:\r\n{code:SQL}\r\nDELETE FROM app_user;\r\n{code}\r\n# Start JIRA.\r\n# Create an XML backup and upgrade the instance to the latest version using that backup.

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-36112].\n  {panel}\n\nCurrently the REST API supports the GET method on  api/2/customFieldOption/{id} \r\n\r\nWith support of PUT (or POST) operation on that URI additional workflows would be supported.\r\n\r\nUse Case: a system manages some mostly automatic process. When manual intervention is required the system opens an issue in Jira. Ticket resolution includes assigning a value to a field, accomplished via a Jira Custom Field.  The domain of options, however, is managed by the system and any selected option must be valid within that domain.  Since the system is used to add options to itself - stored in a database table - to ensure the automated parts and the Jira workflow parts work well together the sets of possible options need to stay in-sync.  As part of its processing the system can create new option values within itself.  Adding the ability to PUT/POST the Jira custom field option values would ensure data integrity and consistency across the automated and more manual, Jira-driven parts of the workflow.\r\n\r\nAs for needs, either a simple PUT with the full set of option values included in the request, or the ability to add and delete individual option items would work.\r\n",
