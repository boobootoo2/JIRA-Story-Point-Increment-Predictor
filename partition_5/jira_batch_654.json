[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-61976].\n  {panel}\n\nDear Atlassian, I have two queries regarding the decision to remove anonymous view access to Agile boards:\r\n\r\nFirstly, can product management please confirm that your product strategy still aligns with your company values; I specifically refer to two quoted company values that seem to, from a customer's perspective, have been ignored in the decision to remove anonymous access of agile boards and your approach to choosing not to communicate such a drastic change:\r\n*\"Don\u2019t #@!%\u0003 the \u0003customer\"*\r\n\"Customers are our lifeblood. Without happy customers, we\u2019re doomed. So considering the customer perspective - collectively, not just a handful - comes first.\" - Do you believe removing functionality that adversely affects the end user, whilst not communicating the intent before the fact in release notes or otherwise, aligns with this company value? Do you feel you have treat your customers fairly here?\r\n\r\n\"Open company, no bullshit\" - Do you believe that withholding information on drastic product changes in your release notes constitutes an \"Open company, no bullshit\"?\r\n\r\nSecondly, in the spirit of providing solutions and not just pointing out problems, I would like to know how Atlassian would view a community attempt to re-instate this functionality through a free JIRA Core plug-in released on the Atlassian Marketplace. Can you clarify and confirm that if the community does chose to create such a plug-in that allows anonymous users to view issues in a board format, functionality that was present in previous versions, that Atlassian will not remove this plug in from the Atlassian Marketplace?\r\n\r\nThank you for your responses so far and I especially look forward to Atlassian's comment on free community JIRA Core add-ons.",

This includes having pop ups appear in less obstructive places.\r\n\r\nEven better if users have an option to select in the profile page for those visually impaired. When this option is selected, JIRAs design will switch to a more user friendly interface while magnified at the same time. It should also handle pop up dialogs gracefully (eg. workflow editor when zoomed in, re-index dialog) so that it doesn't consume much UI space\r\n\r\n\u00a0",

This creates an unfriendly situation when you add a customer in JSD. When you invite/add a new customer to JSD from the customers page, JSD creates the user using the email address as a username. If you invite/add the new customer from User Management, you can choose a different username.\r\n\r\n*Scenario*\r\n1. In JSD project Customers page, Agent invites/adds customer using an email address that contains characters that are not valid in the username field (e.g. &). JSD tries to use the email address as the username, and can't because the username field does not allow &.\r\n2. Dialog throws the following err: Email address contains characters that aren\u2019t valid in the username. Add the user, then use the username to add the user to the project. (Add the user is a CTA to User Management)\r\n3. User has to go to UM, add the user, then go back to the project & invite the user using the username instead of the email.\r\n\r\nThis is confusing & also a pain because you have to leave your task, to go UM, then go back to your task.\r\n\r\n",

      "description": "h3. Summary\r\nThe @mention feature of JIRA is failing to find some users (mostly ones with names starting with the initial letter of the domain) because the javascript responsible for this feature performs a filter over the results of a query via a REST call which is limited to 10 results. The REST call returns users which match the query string (username parameter in the rest call) based on if it exists in EITHER the username, display name, or email address. Because normally the domain matches many users email address, searching for users starting with the initial letter of the domain, will be filtered out. \r\ne.g: mike@mydomain.com may be filtered out when searching for m if there are many more users with @mydomain.com email address and at least 10 users alphabetically before mike.\r\n\r\nh3. Notes\r\n\r\nThis bug is only affecting the \"Description\" field.\r\n\r\nh3. Environment\r\nAffected version: JIRA Server 7.1.9\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Create 11 users with the same domain email address. eg: @example.com\r\n# Name the first 10 users with Letters before e\r\n# Name the 11th user 'example'\r\n# Create an issue and try to mention the user on the \"description\" field.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nIf you use the complete username, or display name, the user should always appear.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nUsing the complete username or display name, doesn't show the user because the rest api is returning 10 previous users (but not displaying them as options)\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n*Partial workaround*\r\nTry with a different user value (if you tried with username, try display name, or last name). The last name value works particularly well as it is quite unique.\r\n\r\n*Confirmed workaround*\r\nTyping the first few characters of a user's name and hitting the {{TAB}} button will autocomplete and allow for the user to be mentioned (until you refresh the page) _e.g. John = Joh...{{TAB}}_",

Summary\r\n\r\nAtlassian HTTP Client's callbacks' ThreadPoolExecutor doesn't queue callbacks, so it might reject tasks submitted to it during high load (when no threads available right at the moment of submitting a task). \r\nIn such cases it throws {{java.util.concurrent.RejectedExecutionException}} from the {{execute}} method in a submitting thread.\r\nApache HTTP Client doesn't expect that, so it throws {{org.apache.http.nio.reactor.IOReactorException}} when catching {{RejectedExecutionException}} and changes IOReactor status to STOPPED therefore preventing further requests being sent by this client bean.\r\nOne of the consequences is that WebHooks stop working after it happens.\r\nh3. Environment\r\n\r\nAny JIRA up to 7.2.0\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Enable DEBUG logging for {{com.atlassian.httpclient}}\r\n # Set up an HTTP endpoint (preferably having a timeout of 30+ sec before responding)\r\n # Configure a WebHook against it\r\n # Make a bulk edit of 1000 issues\r\n # Cross the fingers\r\n # Repeat bulk edits until you see {{java.util.concurrent.RejectedExecutionException}} in the logs.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n - No {{java.util.concurrent.RejectedExecutionException}} thrown\r\n - No {{org.apache.http.nio.reactor.IOReactorException}} thrown\r\n - All JIRA's outgoing HTTP requests (including webhooks) continue working\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n - Apache HTTP client's reactor status is STOPPED\r\n - Webhooks (as well as some other functionality) do not work\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nThat might only *decrease the probability* of this issue, but not fix it completely:\r\n - Decrease the number of webhooks\r\n - Decrease the number of errors when calling webhooks (e.g. get rid of webhooks often throwing TimeoutExceptions, etc.)\r\n - Better hardware might also help *slightly*\r\n\r\nActions that help if the issue actually happened:\r\n - Disabling/enabling the Atlassian HTTP Client plugin\r\n *OR*\r\n - Restarting JIRA.\r\n\r\nNote:\r\n - Disabling/enabling the Atlassian HTTP Client Plugin will trigger other plugins to be restarted. Schedule downtime to make sure it is not affecting users that using JIRA.\r\n - Disabling/enabling the Atlassian HTTP Client Plugin will disable other Jira apps (Jira Software, Jira Service Desk).

We have read your comments and recognise the inconvenience that this bug may have caused since its initial occurrence.\r\nh4. What went wrong?\r\n\r\nJIRA\u2019s feature for exporting issues as an Excel file (.xls) works by creating an HTML file and saving it with an .xls suffix. Up until recently, this solution worked. However, a recent Microsoft Office security update ([Microsoft Security Bulletin MS16-088 - Critical|https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/security/ms16-088.aspx]) now prevents these files from being opened if the user has a high security setting in place, as the change of the file extension is considered to be a security vulnerability.\r\nh4. What are we doing about this?\r\n\r\nWe don't believe that our HTML-based Excel export option is the best solution anymore, however we appreciate that many of you have built processes around it and its immediate removal may disrupt your daily operations. The HTML-based Excel export option will, for now, remain in JIRA Cloud.\r\n\r\nThis feature will be removed for Server in JIRA 7.2.\r\n\r\n+Our intention is to eventually deprecate the HTML-based Excel export option in JIRA Cloud also.+ We will announce this prior to the removal. In the meantime, +we will change the .xls suffix to .html to reinforce that it isn't a native Excel file, and to make it easier to open it in web browsers.+ The exported .html file will also still be readable in Excel, if you have configured your environment appropriately (e.g. [Plan Trusted Locations settings for Office 2010|https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc179039(v=office.14).aspx]).\r\n\r\nRecently, a new CSV-based Excel export option was released to JIRA Cloud, and will be in JIRA Server 7.2. +We recommend you switch to this export option in the long term.+\r\nh4. Will we develop a native Excel export option?\r\n\r\nWe are unlikely to provide a native Excel export in the foreseeable future. Having said that, [there are many add-ons in the Atlassian Marketplace that provide this functionality|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/search?application=jira&category=&cost=&hosting=&marketingLabel=&q=Excel].\r\n\r\nThanks for your patience and understanding.\r\n\r\nKind Regards,\r\nKerrod Williams\r\nJIRA Product Management\r\n{panel}\r\nh3. Summary\r\n\r\nAfter a Microsoft update (described below) export Excel sheets can not be done. Excel opens up to a gray window.\r\n\r\nUpdate\r\n{code:java}\r\n***************\r\nSecurity Update for Microsoft Excel 2010 (KB3115322) 64-Bit Edition\r\nInstallation date: \u200e7/\u200e13/\u200e2016 10:28 PM\r\nInstallation status: Successful\r\nUpdate type: Important\r\nA security vulnerability exists in Microsoft Excel 2010 64-Bit Edition that could allow arbitrary code to run when a maliciously modified file is opened. This update resolves that vulnerability.\r\nMore information: \r\nhttp://support.microsoft.com/kb/3115322\r\nHelp and Support: \r\nhttp://support.microsoft.com/?LN=en-us\r\n***************{code}\r\nWindows update did an excel change for security issues.\r\nWhen the MS update is applied the warning about invalid format is not present and it opens to the blank Excel window.\r\nWhen the update is rolled back, the export works once again. A warning message \"Invalid Extension.jpg\" is thrown and the export opens up successfully.\r\nh3. Environment\r\n\r\nCloud - JIRA v1000.148.3\r\nMicrosoft Excel 2010\r\nMicrosoft Excel 2016 version 16.0.7070.2026\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Export issues to Excel\r\n # Open in Excel with the update applied\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nxls is loaded successfully without warning or blank pages.\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nExcel shows a gray page with update applied.\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n # Use other xls viewer applications.\r\n # According to a customer, the security upgrade of Excel has a selected default that prevents the spreadsheet from loading the data. The following steps to uncheck the said default setting described at the attachment below solved 100% the issue for him:\r\n [^Enable Excel Extracts from JIRA.docx]\r\n\r\n*(Please, see attachment)*",
