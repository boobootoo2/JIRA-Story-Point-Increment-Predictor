However, if the address is not associated with any user, and the handler has a reporterusername, then the comment will be added as that default user.\r\n\r\nThis ends in the absurd situation where a non existing user can add comments to a case, but an existing user cannot. This user could then create a bogus email account to add comments to the issue.\r\n\r\nIn my understanding, the logic of the handleMessage/getReporter mail handlers should be changed. For the previous case (existing user but no permissions) the logic should be:\r\n\r\n# Get user from email\r\n# If user exists, check if user has permission to perform operation\r\n# If no permissions, fall back to reporterusername\r\n\r\nI am aware that [JRA-16786] was raised in the past with a similar request, and the functionality was claimed to be like that by design. However, I think the situation I describe is a flaw in that design.\r\n\r\nIf the logic was as described before, we could have avoided creating the proxy commenter for SAC to fix [JRA-15431]. The proxy commenter performs the logic as described before (with some additional magic)\r\n\r\n",

Maybe group issues in groups by the fourth power of ten?  \r\n\r\nFor example, instead of \r\n\r\n/usr/local/jira/attachments/JRA/JRA-123456\r\n\r\nhave\r\n\r\n/usr/local/jira/attachments/JRA/120000/JRA-123456\r\n\r\nFor now we've moved the 1,000 oldest attachments to another directory, effectively deleting them from the Jira web site.  \r\nSo we have a couple weeks to come up with some patch for this or we keep effectively archiving or deleting old attachments.\r\n\r\nI understand from our OS folks that it would be possible to recompile the kernel to have a higher maximum file handle setting.

Thus, since the printable page is accessed on a fully qualified url with a base url on http it fails to display. \r\n\r\nAll other issues open on this area have been closed with statements that either using:\r\n1) ProxyPreserveHost will fix it\r\n2) Implement SSL on the Jira Tomcat instance will resolve it. \r\n\r\nIn our case as in JRA-14910 the ProxyPreserveHost setting does not fix the issue as we are proxying https requests on as http. And I don't accept that we should have to implemtent SSL listening on the Tomcat instance.\r\nWe have a number of internal and 3rd party developed applications running in our environment and Jira is the only one that has an issue with https proxying back thru apache to http in this manner. \r\n\r\nWhat I have not been able to ascertain in either my internal support request or in reviewing other issues on jira.atlassian.com is _why_ the printable page link is implemented with a absolute url yet all other links are relative?\r\n\r\nThanks & Regards ...

Or to be more exact, it's not easy to find out to which project roles (in which projects) a group is assigned to.\r\n\r\nDoes this feature already exist, and I'm only missing it?\r\n\r\nThanks for your support & Cheers\r\n\r\nBenjamin",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-19766].\r\n{panel}\r\nHi,\r\n\r\nJira users in my company report that the Project Summary page does not show all charts they would like to see. I have suggested that they could create a dashboard containing all relevant charts, but they complain that they cannot name the gadgets as they would like.\r\n\r\nFor example the chart which is presented as 'Issues: 30 Day Summary' at the Project Summary page, could be placed at the dashboard, but its name is set to 'Created vs Resolved Chart: <Project Name>'. That would be great if users could edit the title.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n Lukasz",
