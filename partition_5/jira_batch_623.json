Suggested Solution\r\nAllow [Audit Log|https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiraserver074/auditing-in-jira-applications-881684057.html] to record changes made to Priorities (or Issue Attributes as a whole) by users.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nCurrently, the only way to determine which users have made such changes is by running a grep command on all JIRA access logs using the keywords 'POST' and '_action_' (where _action_ is represented by JSP command in the URL that a user clicks to perform an action). An example would be:\r\n\r\njiraurl/secure/admin/*AddPriority*.jspa\r\n\r\nwhere *AddPriority* represents a user adding a new Priority in the Issue Attributes.\r\n\r\nAs such, to search for all POST request to add new Priority, execute the following command in the {{[JIRA-INSTALL-DIR|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/JIRA+Installation+Directory]/logs/}}\r\n{code}\r\ngrep 'POST' * | grep 'AddPriority'\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nA line from the output would look like this:\r\n\r\n{panel:title=Example of output from grep command}\r\naccess_log.2017-08-10:10.60.3.225 963x9989x1 *admin* \\[*10/Aug/2017:16:03:15 +0800*\\] \"*POST* /contextpath/secure/admin/AddPriority.jspa HTTP/1.1\" 302 - 13 \"http://jiraurl/contextpath/secure/admin/*AddPriority*.jspa\" \"Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X x_x_x) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/5x.x.x.xx Safari/537.36\" \"mb84ca\"\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\nwhere the first bold word would be the user name, then followed by the date and time of the request, the POST request and the action done.\r\n\r\nIf you wish to narrow the output to request by a particular user _user_, run the following command:\r\n{code}\r\ngrep 'POST' * | grep 'AddPriority' | grep user\r\n{code}\r\n\r\n(i) The lines outputted by grep only provides the information as stated above and does not give details as to what has been added, changed or deleted. Such details are not logged by the access logs.\r\n\r\n(!) Please note that the above grep command shows all the request attempts in the access logs that have been made, successful or failed.",

      "description": "h3. Summary\r\n\r\nJIRA has a *Date Picker* custom field, which accepts values which are formatted as described in *Administration >> System >> General Configuration >> Advanced Settings* as the *jira.date.picker.java.format*. By default, the format that is defined in JIRA is as follows:\r\n * jira.date.picker.java.format : d/MMM/yy\r\n * jira.date.picker.javascript.format : %e/%b/%y\r\n\r\nWhen a user attempts to create an issue which has a *Date Picker* custom field and enters a date in a format that is unrecognized, JIRA will throw an error and prevent the issue from being created:\r\n{quote}Invalid date format. Please enter the date in the format \"d/MMM/yy\".\r\n{quote}\r\n*However*, it is possible to reconfigure the date picker format to an alternate, desired format. Though the specifics are unknown, certain formats will cause JIRA to throw a different error, while still creating the issue. In these circumstances, users who incorrectly enter the format may unwittingly create multiple issues, while believing that the issues are not being created.\r\n\r\nSuch issues created in this fashion have the following problems:\r\n * They are not indexed, and do not come up in issue navigator searches until later reindexes\r\n * The will not have the *Date Picker* custom field properly set\r\n\r\nUsers will not realize that these issues were created until a reindex later on, where all of the erroneously created issues will spontaneously appear.\r\nh3. Environment\r\n * JIRA 7.4.0\r\n * MS SQL Server 2012\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Start with a fresh or existing JIRA instance\r\n # Create a brand new project (Project Type does not matter)\r\n # Create a new custom field of type *Date Picker* (e.g. \"Date of Birth\") and associate it with all screens in this project\r\n # Navigate to *Administration >> System >> General Configuration >> Advanced Settings*\r\n # Adjust jira.date.picker.java.format to {{MM/dd/yyyy}}\r\n # Adjust jira.date.picker.javascript.format to {{%m/%d/%Y}}\r\n # Create an issue, setting the *Date Picker* field to a value which does not align with the provided format (i.e. 01/01/14)\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nJIRA should reject the issue creation with a warning that the supplied date format of 01/01/14 does not meet the expected format MM/dd/yyyy.\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\n1. JIRA rejects the issue creation with a different warning:\r\n{quote}We can't create this issue for you right now, it could be due to unsupported content you've entered into one or more of the issue fields. If this situation persists, contact your administrator as they'll be able to access more specific information in the log file.\r\n{quote}\r\n2. The following error is thrown in the application logs:\r\n{code:java}\r\n2017-08-09 15:35:09,286 http-nio-8098-exec-19 ERROR kliou 935x880x1 1rhnhcp 0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1 /secure/QuickCreateIssue.jspa [c.a.j.bc.issue.DefaultIssueService] Error creating issue: \r\ncom.atlassian.jira.exception.CreateException: org.ofbiz.core.entity.GenericEntityException: while inserting: [GenericEntity:CustomFieldValue][parentkey,null][customfield,10203][issue,10013][datevalue,0014-01-01 00:00:00.0][id,10037] (SQL Exception while setting value:  (Only dates between January 1, 1753 and December 31, 9999 are accepted.)){code}\r\n3. The issue is *still* created, though the issue is not indexed and cannot be searched for. You may still access the issue directly via it's URL, which can be determined by the last known Issue Key and incrementing it's value by 1 (i.e. if the last issue key in this project was PROJ-12345, PROJ-12346 would have been created by this attempt). Alternatively, the database may be queried in the *jiraissue* table for the issuekey with the ID specified in the SQLException above (10013).\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n * Avoid modifying the format of the date picker in JIRA's Advanced Settings, and use the default format instead, which seems to have a better functioning handler for invalid values\r\n * Use the widget to select your date picker value, rather than typing it in. This will avoid improper formatting\r\n * For the above example specifically, adjust the format from {{MM/dd/yyyy}} to {{MM/dd/yy}}. This will accept values where only the last two digits of the year value is offered, but may lead to inconsistent results (testing results show that a year value of \"37\" will assume 1937, but a year value of \"36\" will assume 2036).",

Steps to Reproduce\r\n* Access either [Restoring project for JIRA 7.3|https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiraserver073/restoring-a-project-from-backup-861253833.html#Restoringaprojectfrombackup-restoreprojectRestoringyourproject] or [Restoring project for JIRA 7.4|https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiraserver074/restoring-a-project-from-backup-881684008.html#Restoringaprojectfrombackup-restoreprojectRestoringyourproject]\r\n* We find the following mention:  [^screenshot-2.png]\r\n\r\nh5. Expected Behavior\r\n* When trying to import a project with the project Import, JIRA creates a project when it does not exist.\r\n\r\nh5. Actual Behavior\r\n* Project import will show a message saying: \"JIRA did not find a project with key 'XXX'(project key) to import your issues into. Please create a project with key 'XXX' that contains compatible workflow and issue types\". See example  [^screenshot-1.png]\r\n\r\nh5.Workaround\r\nThere is no workaround for this issue.\r\n\r\nh5. Notes:\r\n* The test was performed making a backup, then deleting a project from that instance, and trying to restore the deleted project which makes it identical. After creating a project with the same Key, it was possible to import the project without any issues.\r\n* Since there is a specific message for this, it is very likely that the functionality changed at some point and now it simply does not create the project.",

      "description": "h3. +Scenario+\r\n\r\nWhen a (new) custom field context is created for a custom field of type Select List (single choice), JIRA creates the following entries in the database:\r\n * 1 entry in table fieldconfiguration to store the context itself\r\n * 1 entry in table fieldconfigscheme to store the context scheme\r\n * X entries in table fieldconfigschemeissuetype to link the above 2 together, plus the issue type context (restricted to which issue type/s)\r\n * X\u00a0entries in table configurationcontext to store the project context (restricted to which project/s)\r\n * X\u00a0entries in table customfieldoption to store the number of options\r\n * 1 entry in table genericconfiguration to store the default value (if any)\r\n\r\nFor example, this custom field context (created when custom field is created):\r\n\r\n!field.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nhas these entries in the database:\r\n\r\n!db.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nThe relationships between the tables and columns are as follows:\r\n * fieldconfigscheme.id = fieldconfigschemeissuetype.fieldconfigscheme = configurationcontext.fieldconfigscheme\u00a0(/)\r\n * fieldconfiguration.id = fieldconfigschemeissuetype.fieldconfiguration = genericconfiguration.datakey (/)\r\n * {{fieldconfiguration.id = customfieldoption.customfieldconfig (i)}}\r\n\r\nh3. +Problem+\r\n\r\nAccording to the above, there's no relationship between\u00a0{{fieldconfigscheme.id}} and {{fieldconfiguration.id}}, and they do mismatch. Currently, when JIRA needs to look up\u00a0{{customfieldoption.customfieldconfig}}\u00a0for\u00a0available options, it fails because it\u00a0incorrectly uses {{fieldconfigscheme.id}} instead of {{fieldconfiguration.id}}, leading to *options not found*.\r\n\r\n(!)\u00a0So far this is known to cause only Project Import problem, as in\u00a0JRASERVER-63226.\r\nh3. +Steps to reproduce+\r\n # Create a custom field as in the above example\r\n # Modify the database to make {{fieldconfigscheme.id}}\u00a0differ from {{fieldconfiguration.id}}:\r\n{code:java}\r\n1.\u00a0update fieldconfigscheme set id = 99999 where id = 10500;\r\n2. update fieldconfigschemeissuetype set fieldconfigscheme = 99999 where fieldconfigscheme = 10500;\r\n3. update configurationcontext set fieldconfigscheme = 99999 where fieldconfigscheme = 10500;{code}\r\n(!) This is for testing purpose only, but it happens in real situations.\r\n # Restart JIRA for the change to take effect\r\n # Create an issue that the field is available for, and give the field a value in that issue e.g. Peugeot\r\n # Create an XML backup\r\n # Delete the issue in step 4 to make the project ready for project import\r\n # Use the backup in step 5 to perform a project import\r\n\r\nh3. +Expected behavior+\r\n\r\nThere's no validation error regarding the custom field options, because the custom field exists with exactly the same context and options.\r\nh3. +Actual behavior+\r\n\r\nJIRA says it can't find the option Peugeot needed to import the issue:\r\n\r\n!import.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\n(x) JIRA uses 99999 to look up the options, but the options use 10500.\r\nh3. +Workaround+\r\n\r\nIt's possible to modify the entities.xml and update {{customfieldoption.customfieldconfig}}\u00a0with {{fieldconfigscheme.id}}. In this example, find the following lines:\r\n{code:java}\r\n<CustomFieldOption id=\"10300\" customfield=\"10200\" customfieldconfig=\"10500\" sequence=\"0\" value=\"Peugeot\" disabled=\"N\"/>\r\n<CustomFieldOption id=\"10301\" customfield=\"10200\" customfieldconfig=\"10500\" sequence=\"1\" value=\"Honda\" disabled=\"N\"/>{code}\r\nand replace them with:\r\n{code:java}\r\n<CustomFieldOption id=\"10300\" customfield=\"10200\" customfieldconfig=\"99999\" sequence=\"0\" value=\"Peugeot\" disabled=\"N\"/>\r\n<CustomFieldOption id=\"10301\" customfield=\"10200\" customfieldconfig=\"99999\" sequence=\"1\" value=\"Honda\" disabled=\"N\"/>{code}\r\nThen save the file, zip it back, and use the zip to perform project import.\r\n\r\n(!)\u00a0The modified zip file should only be used for project import. Once done, it should be destroyed as the custom field configuration association is already messed.\r\n\r\n(+)\u00a0For more details, please refer to [Project Import fails due to missing Custom Field Options|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRAKB/Project+Import+fails+due+to+missing+Custom+Field+Options].",

Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nAllow triggers in a chosen workflow transition to include detection of changes made to the issue such as an issue being assigned.\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nA third-party plugin ([Automation for JIRA|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.codebarrel.addons.automation/server/overview]) is able to provide a solution to the above Problem Definition. It is achieved by creating a custom rule that changes the status/transition an issue when a change to the issue (Issue is assigned) is detected.\r\n Note: The following workaround is for the plugin installed in JIRA 6.4.2\r\n\r\n# Install '*Automation for JIRA*' as an add-on through *Atlassian Marketplace* in JIRA (found under *Administration > Add-ons*). \r\n# Once you have installed the plugin, under '*Administration > Add-ons*' click on 'Automation' located in the left-hand panel.\r\n# Then, right-click on the *'Add Rule' button* on the top-right of the page.\r\n# You will need to enter a name for this rule (Eg. 'Assign to me rule'). *Click* on *'Enable rule once created?'* checkbox and click 'Next' to continue.\r\n# Under 'Select Trigger' section, choose '*Issue Event Trigger*' for the 'Select Trigger' *option*.\r\n# Under 'Issue Event' option, select '*Issue Assigned*' in the drop-down list. You may also *choose to restrict users* that can change the status when they assign the issue by clicking on the 'Restrict which users can trigger this event?' checkbox. Click 'Next' to continue.\r\n# Under the 'Add Actions' section, select '*Transition Issue Action*'. A new option called 'Workflow Transition' will appear which allows you to *choose what Status* to transition the issue. Select the *appropriate transition* from the drop-down box. You may also *choose to enable additional actions to trigger* when an issue is assigned by clicking on the *'Add action' button.* Click 'Next' to continue.\r\n# *Confirm the details* of the rule before saving it.

Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Connect JIRA to an external LDAP directory;\r\n# Set the username attribute to {{mail}};\r\n# Create a user with any e-mail address;\r\n# Synchronize the directory with JIRA;\r\n# Create a new user in the external directory with the same e-mail address as the one on step 3;\r\n# Synchronize the directory again;\r\n# Note the below errors in the logs:\r\n{noformat:borderStyle=solid|borderColor=#6A8EB3|bgColor=#F8F8F8}\r\n2017-07-05 14:49:12,210 Caesium-1-2 ERROR anonymous     [c.atlassian.scheduler.JobRunnerResponse] Unable to synchronise directory\r\ncom.atlassian.jira.exception.DataAccessException: org.ofbiz.core.entity.GenericEntityException: while updating: [GenericEntity:User][lastName,Doe][lowerDisplayName,john doe][displayName,John Doe][lowerLastName,doe][active,0][externalId,xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx][updatedDate,2017-07-05 14:49:12.067][userName,john@doe.com][lowerEmailAddress,john@doe.com][firstName,John][emailAddress,john@doe.com][lowerUserName,john@doe.com][createdDate,2016-06-17 19:34:31.885][credential,nopass][deletedExternally,null][directoryId,10300][lowerFirstName,john][id,102084] (SQL Exception while executing the following:UPDATE public.cwd_user SET directory_id=?, user_name=?, lower_user_name=?, active=?, created_date=?, updated_date=?, first_name=?, lower_first_name=?, last_name=?, lower_last_name=?, display_name=?, lower_display_name=?, email_address=?, lower_email_address=?, CREDENTIAL=?, deleted_externally=?, EXTERNAL_ID=?

      "description": "h3. Problem Definition\r\nLatest JIRA releases such as the 7.4.1 windows 64 bit exe installation package appear to be including the JAVA JRE 8u102 release.   This release works for JIRA, but there have been a number of Oracle patches since this was released over 1 year ago.   [Oracle JAVA 8u102 release notes - July 19th, 2016|http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/8u102-relnotes-3021767.html].\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\nupdate the JAVA JRE packages to use the latest release available, currently this appears to be 8u141.\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Why this is important\r\nMany JIRA installations could benefit from using this update java version both in terms of platform stability as well as bug fixes to address java bugs.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.oracle.com/technetwork/security-advisory/cpujan2017-2881727.html\r\nhttp://www.oracle.com/technetwork/security-advisory/cpuapr2017-3236618.html\r\nhttp://www.oracle.com/technetwork/security-advisory/cpujul2017-3236622.html\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround \r\nIn the mean time, server customers can certainly install their own updated Oracle JAVA versions and set the JAVA_HOME parameter in order to force JIRA to use this updated JRE.
