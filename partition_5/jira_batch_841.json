In the same time we seem to change Tomcat's binary package for *Windows* from {{apache-tomcat-6.0.20.zip}} to {{apache-tomcat-6.0.32-windows-x86.zip}}.\r\n\r\nhttps://maven.atlassian.com/content/groups/internal/org/apache/tomcat/apache-tomcat/6.0.32/\r\nhttp://archive.apache.org/dist/tomcat/tomcat-6/v6.0.32/bin/\r\n\r\nThis change introduce requirement for new way of configuring of HTTPS as Tomcat uses [Apache Portable Runtime (APR) based Native library for Tomcat|http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-6.0-doc/apr.html]. \r\n\r\n{quote}\r\n    Tomcat can use the Apache Portable Runtime to provide superior scalability, performance, and better integration with native server technologies. The Apache Portable Runtime is a highly portable library that is at the heart of Apache HTTP Server 2.x. APR has many uses, including access to advanced IO functionality (such as sendfile, epoll and OpenSSL), OS level functionality (random number generation, system status, etc), and native process handling (shared memory, NT pipes and Unix sockets).\r\n\r\n    These features allows making Tomcat a general purpose webserver, will enable much better integration with other native web technologies, and overall make Java much more viable as a full fledged webserver platform rather than simply a backend focused technology.\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nIf this is intended change we should alter our docs to indicate and warn users. Pages such as release notes and [Running JIRA over SSL or HTTPS|http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Running+JIRA+over+SSL+or+HTTPS] are just two possible candidates for the update.\r\n\r\nAs of JIRA 4.3.1 the HTTPS connector needs to be configured in a completely different way with help of OpenSSL:\r\n{noformat}\r\n<Connector port=\"443\" maxHttpHeaderSize=\"8192\"\r\n               maxThreads=\"150\"\r\n               enableLookups=\"false\" disableUploadTimeout=\"true\"\r\n               acceptCount=\"100\" scheme=\"https\" secure=\"true\"\r\n               SSLEnabled=\"true\" \r\n               SSLCertificateFile=\"${catalina.base}/conf/localhost.crt\"\r\n               SSLCertificateKeyFile=\"${catalina.base}/conf/localhost.key\" />\r\n{noformat}\r\nhttp://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-6.0-doc/apr.html#HTTPS\r\nhttp://mircwiki.rsna.org/index.php?title=Configuring_Tomcat_to_Support_SSL\r\n\r\nMoreover, we need to ensure that we are consistent across the boarder and JIRA's Linux distribution also uses Apache Tomcat Native.",

      "description": "h3. Symptoms\r\n\r\nWhen executing a webwork action on a JIRA instance on Unicorn for the first time, JIRA takes a long time, sometimes over 10 seconds to return.  Execute that same action again, and it's fast.  Execute another action for the first time, it's slow.  Execute that same action again, it's fast.  Restart JIRA, everything is slow again.\r\n\r\nh3. Investigation\r\n\r\n* First thought was JSP compilation was slow due to NFS filesystem on Unicorn.\r\n* Analysis of CPU usage showed that it tended to be CPU bound, this rules out problems due to NFS.\r\n* Disabling JVM debug mode markedly improved performance, but the first page load was still noticeably slower (0.5s).\r\n* Repeated thread dumps while waiting for the request to return indicated that much of the time was spent doing reflected method calls on {{WebworkModuleDescriptor.getImpl()}} by {{MultiTenantModuleDescriptorFactory.LifecycleInterceptor.TenantInterceptor.intercept()}}\r\n* This was mostly triggered by the {{ActionFactory}} looking up the action or the view\r\n* It was also triggered by a number of WebWork tags executing, including the if tag\r\n* Looking at the code, {{WebworkModuleDescriptor.getImpl()}} was not just being executed to look up actions, but was also being executed to look up any webwork property.  Each module descriptor is searched, in spite of the fact that it is impossible that any one of them would know the value.  The way that webwork indicates that value is not known is by throwing {{IllegalArgumentException}}.\r\n* When the action was looked up, each module descriptor when trying to find the action would look up the action extension.  This in turn would trigger each module descriptor being searched for the action extension, so there are at least n2 executions done on the module descriptors for every lookup.\r\n\r\nExample thread dump extracts:\r\n\r\n{noformat}\r\n@400000004dbe1a9a1bb6cf7c \"TP-Processor3\" daemon prio=10 tid=0x82f0f000 nid=0x15d575 waiting on condition [0x7fa51000]\r\n@400000004dbe1a9a1bb6d74c

      "description": "_Special thanks to the customer and developer Jens Doll. Technical description and impact analysis is quoted from him_\r\n*Technical description:*\r\n{quote}\r\nThe semantics of the above mentioned method is stated in the Java doc of the interface com.atlassian.jira.issue.fields.renderer.JiraRendererPlugin:\r\n{code}\r\n/**\r\n  * This allows the renderer to perform a transformation on the submitted edit value before\r\n  * storing the value in the system. This can be useful if the value being submitted is\r\n  * a different format (i.e. html markup that the edit control generates), than the system\r\n  * expects to store (i.e. wiki markup). <b>NOTE: this method need not do anything if the\r\n  * system is happy to store the value the edit control produces.<b>\r\n  *\r\n  * @param editValue is the value produced by the edit control.\r\n  * @return the value in a form that the system expects to store.\r\n  */\r\npublic Object transformFromEdit(Object editValue);\u00b4\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nBut as stated, the CustomFieldImpl class disrespects the return value of the function transformFromEdit() and thus making this method completly worthless.\r\nThe excerpt from CustomFieldImpl.java shows this:\r\n{code}\r\nprivate Object processValueThroughRenderer(FieldLayoutItem fieldLayoutItem, Object value) {\r\n  // ..\r\n    rendererManager.getRendererForType(rendererType).transformFromEdit(value);\r\n  // ..\r\n  return value;\r\n}\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nInterestingly other field implementations do indeed respect the return value. As example DescriptionSystemField.java is shown here:\r\n{code}\r\npublic void updateIssue(FieldLayoutItem fieldLayoutItem, MutableIssue issue, Map fieldValueHolder) {\r\n  // ..\r\n    // give the renderer a change to transform the incomming value\r\n    String desc = (String)rendererManager.getRendererForType(rendererType).transformFromEdit(getValueFromParams(fieldValueHolder));\r\n    if (TextUtils.stringSet(desc))\r\n      issue.setDescription(desc);\r\n    else\r\n      issue.setDescription(null);\r\n}\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nA fix for this would be just adding {{value =}} in CustomFieldImpl.java before the call to the method. Resulting in something that looks like:\r\n{code}\r\nprivate Object processValueThroughRenderer(FieldLayoutItem fieldLayoutItem, Object value) {\r\n  // ..\r\n    value = rendererManager.getRendererForType(rendererType).transformFromEdit(value);\r\n  // ..\r\n  return value;\r\n}\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nNote that this bug might be in more versions than the one stated here, 4.2.2 and 4.3 are the version where the bug was confirmed within the source.\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\n*Impact analysis*\r\n{quote}\r\nAs for the impact analysis:\r\n* For any vanilla JIRA installation (this means a out-of-the-box installation with no additional plug-ins whatsoever) the impact is negligible, since no renderer initially shipped with JIRA rely on this feature. (For example, the \"Wiki Style Renderer\" will just store the contents of the field as entered by the user in the database with no transformations applied.)  \r\nThis is probably the reason why this bug was never discovered.\r\n* As it comes to plug-in developers this may render (huh!) some custom developed renderer implementations impossible since a server side transformation from returned values is not possible without this feature. One possible way to circumvent this is to apply all transformation that are necessary for a renderer with Javascript on the client side (in the HTML document, so to speak). But this makes an implementation of an renderer rely on Javascript to be enabled in the browser and thus effectivly prevents any [unobtrusive Javascript|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unobtrusive_JavaScript] implementations.\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\n*Steps to reproduce the problem*\r\nJens Doll has created us a plug-in which has a renderer which is simply supposed to change the characters from lowercase to upper case. While it works as expected on System Fields, such as description, it does not work on custom fields:\r\n* !create issue.PNG!\r\n\r\n* !view issue.PNG!\r\n",

I have used the Set Security Level Permission to ensure that only internal users can edit it, I have added the Security Level to the edit screen for the project/screen scheme, but not to the View screen. However the Security Level still appears in the View screen as seen, both by internal users and external users. Surely it should now only be seen in the edit screen, and then only by those with the permission to edit it?\r\n\r\nAny help gratefully received.\r\n\r\nmany thanks\r\n\r\nDavid\r\n\r\n{quote}",

We were progressing this transition in response to a commit message from SVN, and were updating none of the fields, however, JIRA seems to be ignoring the fact that no issue type was set on the transition request, and updates the issue type of the issue to be null.  This later results in a NullPointerException when permissions are checked for another field.\r\n\r\nThis may be a problem for other fields, not sure.  It seems here that the assumption is that because issue type is a select list, that it will always have a value.  That's true when the transition is executed from the web interface, but its not true in any other workflow transition scenario.  It also seems that the issue type field might not be being correctly validated before being set.  What should happen is that it should be seen to be null in the transition request, and so not updated.",
