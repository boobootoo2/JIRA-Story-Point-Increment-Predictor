[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-25057].\n  {panel}\n\nThe way that Jira handles sub-tasks is inconsistent with standard project management methodology.  A sub-task, by definition, is a fractional component of a parent task.  In other words, a parent task can be broken down into multiple smaller steps, each of which is a sub-task.  Assuming there is an complete listing of sub-tasks, once all of the sub-tasks are completed, the parent task is also complete.  So that if a parent task is estimated to take 10 hours to complete, it can be broken down into, for instance, five two-hour sub-tasks.  The time required to complete the sub-tasks does not add to the total time of the parent task; rather, the time for the parent task is already inclusive of the sub-task time.\r\n\r\nJira, however, treats sub-tasks as \"related tasks,\" which is a completely different concept. When a sub-task is created and a time estimate entered, that time estimate adds to the total time of the parent task, which then results in inflated project time estimates and an inability to effectively track and report on the remaining work because time is getting double counted -- once in the sub-task and once in the parent task.  The only workaround for this situation is to enter a zero time estimate for the sub-task and to log work against the sub-task in the parent task, which does solve the problem but removes the ability to track estimate accuracy against the sub-tasks within Jira.\r\n\r\nTo resolve this situation, Jira would be improved by not adding time estimate for a sub-task to the total estimate for a parent task unless the total estimated time for all of the sub-tasks for a given parent task exceeded the original estimate for the parent task.  Logging time against a sub-task should then reduce the total remaining time for the sub-task as well as the parent task.  ",

You can't do this as a user from the directory because JIRA wont let you. Normally you would login as and admin from the internal directory and edit the crowd directory. However, as the crowd sso authenticator only allows users from a crowd directory to login. This basically means you can't change the configuration of the crowd directory.\r\n\r\nThe way to work around this is disable crowd sso (i.e. edit seraph-config.xml) and restart JIRA.

Most plugins use Velocity templates for their UI features.\r\n\r\nProblem: Velocity files in JIRA can use #parse and #macro to make them scale better. Plugins can't use #parse at all, and #macro only works within the same .vm file. \r\nThis makes it hard for plugins to scale. Developing and debugging a large, monolithic .vm file is hard to get right.\r\n\r\nIdea: modify the DefaultVelocityManager so that when it is used by a plugin it changes the Velocity engine properties and adds the resources directory as a valid TEMPLATE_ROOT for finding macros and .vm files to include. Document this with a small reference plugin that shows how to use these Velocity features to improve your own plugin.",

      "description": "Running JIRA on Tomcat with other Atlassian Applications on the same Tomcat is not recommended. This is nicely stated in these documentations:\r\n\r\n* [Running JIRA on Tomcat 6.0|http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA043/Installing+JIRA+on+Tomcat+6.0#InstallingJIRAonTomcat6.0-BeforeYouBegin]\r\n* [Running JIRA on Tomcat 5.5|http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Installing+JIRA+on+Tomcat+5.5]\r\n\r\nMoreover, running JIRA on Tomcat with any other applications is actually not recommended, especially if these applications are large or if they require libraries installed under <tomcat>/lib, as this may cause false positive XSRF attacks which is described in this link:\r\nhttp://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRAKB/%27XSRF+white+list+failure%27+When+Editing+Workflows\r\n\r\nIn order to prevent possibility of such problems, I believe we should mention this in our documentation besides it being mentioned in our knowledge base article.\r\n\r\nThis is the part where it would be suitable to change/add to, from our Running JIRA on Tomcat documentations:\r\n{quote}\r\nDeploying multiple Atlassian applications in a single Tomcat container is not supported. We do not test this configuration and upgrading any of the applications (even for point releases) is likely to break it. There are also a number of known issues with this configuration (see this FAQ for more information).\r\n\r\nWe also strongly recommend that you do not deploy multiple Atlassian applications in a single Tomcat container for a number of practical reasons. Firstly, you will need to shut down Tomcat to upgrade any application and secondly, if one application crashes, the other applications running in the Tomcat container will be inaccessible.\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nTo summarize, we should also say that it is not recommended to run any applications on the same Tomcat instance besides JIRA, especially if they are large in terms of memory or require additional libraries in <tomcat>/lib.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nAli\r\nAtlassian Support",

The \"blocks\" links typically form a directed-acyclic-graph, not a tree. A DAG can have the following structure:\r\n\r\n{noformat}\r\n       C \r\n      / \\\r\n A - B   E - F \r\n      \\ /\r\n       D\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nThe Links Hierarchy Plug-in does not handle this case well. It shows multiples of E and F, one hanging off C and one off D.\r\n\r\nPERT charts are a long-established and valuable project issue/task dependency management tool, and JIRA needs one.\r\nI will be forced to hand-copy my issues into Visio bubbles and arrows until this feature happens in JIRA.\r\n",

Set the JIRA Home Directory in JIRA\r\n\r\nCan we have the path of application.properties without having to click for it?\r\n./atlassian-jira/WEB-INF/classes/jira-application.properties\r\n\r\nOnly a small thing but I think it's more of a convention to use </suggested/paths> as such.\r\nexport JIRA_HOME = </path/to/jira/home>\r\nCan we give an example that it's usually set as something like /var/atlassian/jira ?\r\n\r\nI think exporting can be risky because the system will forget it when logged out and in again. Instead maybe something like:\r\necho JIRA_HOME=/var/atlassian/jira >> /etc/environment\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Create a Dedicated User Account on the Operating System to Run JIRA\r\n\r\nCan we suggest a dedicated user account AND group?\r\n\r\ngroupadd atlassian\r\nThen add the user jira and put it into the group atlassian:\r\nuseradd --create-home --comment \"Account for running JIRA\" --shell /bin/bash jira -G atlassian\r\n\r\nSuggestion for setting permissions\r\nchown -R jira:atlassian </path/to/jira/install>\r\nchmod 770 </path/to/jira/install> (please tighten for security if necessary)\r\nchown -R jira:atlassian </path/to/jira/home>\r\nchmod 770 </path/to/jira/home> (please tighten for security if necessary)\r\n\r\n\r\n4. Start JIRA\r\n\r\nWait until the following message appears in the application's log file: - give path to log file instead of having to click elsewhere.\r\n\r\nIf JIRA does not appear in your web browser, you may need to change the port that JIRA runs on.\r\nAlso suggest to check OS and network firewalls\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Running+the+Setup+Wizard\r\n\r\nCan we please link to a page on dragons (or wherever) that tells the customer how to set up on different databases eg: postgres...\r\n\r\nBasic Postgres setup information:\r\nyum install postgresql84-libs.x86_64 postgresql84-server.x86_64 postgresql84-devel.x86_64\r\nsu postgres\r\ninitdb /var/lib/pgsql/data\r\n* check postgresql.conf \r\n(adjust security)\r\nlisten_addresses = '*'  \r\n* check pg_hba.conf\r\n(adjust security)\r\nhost    all         all       0.0.0.0/0               trust\r\nexit\r\n/etc/init.d/postgresql start\r\nsu postgres\r\ncreateuser jira_user\r\nShall the new role be a superuser? (y/n) n\r\nShall the new role be allowed to create databases? (y/n) y\r\nShall the new role be allowed to create more new roles? (y/n) n\r\nCREATE ROLE\r\n$ /usr/local/pgsql/bin/createdb jira_db -O jira_user\r\nCREATE DATABASE\r\ntest database and enable password:\r\npsql postgres postgres\r\n\\l (lists all databases)\r\nALTER USER postgres WITH PASSWORD 'tmppassword';\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Connecting+JIRA+to+PostgreSQL#ConnectingJIRAtoPostgreSQL-databaseconfig\r\n\r\nOpen a console and execute config.sh in the bin subdirectory of the JIRA Installation Directory.\r\nCan we make a note that the costumer will need a GUI on Linux for this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Installing+JIRA+Standalone+on+Linux\r\n\r\nI thought that the name was a little generic \"Installing JIRA Standalone on Linux\" \r\nMaybe can we change it to something like \"Installing JIRA Standalone on Linux using self extracting setup wizard\"?\r\nReiterate that this will be the recommended way to perform an install\r\n\r\n If JIRA does not appear, you may need to change the port that JIRA runs on.\r\n pelase add \"Also check OS and network firewalls blocking your chosen port\"\r\n",

The style should be similar to 'Greenhopper Days Remaining' - Big Bold Number. \r\n\r\nThe information it should provide relates to Service Level Agreement commitment projections based on historical data. This concept is especially used with Kanban processes, where a commitment is made as a new task starts, that it will be complete within <statistic> days. \r\n\r\nThe commitment is based on the (recent) historical mean for the cycle time (ie.\"work started\" - to - \"done\" period) for issues [of that type] PLUS 2 standard deviations. \r\n\r\nThe problem I am striking is that JQL seems too primitive to allow me to select an appropriate set of records and perform statistical calculations based on values for certain fields in those records.\r\n\r\nWhat is needed is:\r\nWhere Project is <name>\r\n  Pick the (configurable number) most recently \"Closed\" or \"Resolved\" issues\r\n    For these issues, calculate the mean and standard deviation from the time difference between the \"work started\" and \"done\" timestamps\r\n      Display = Mean + (2 * Sigma)\r\n\r\nOf course this would also be best with additional filtering, so the set of issues calculated over would be taken from a selected Component or Version or Assignee. As we are using 'shirt size' estimates via a custom field, it would be good to filter based on that also, so that we can have a gadget that displays the current SLA commitment for each estimation size.\r\n\r\nAn additional option to display the actual mean would be useful also.\r\n\r\nI attach suggested graphic and config mockups\r\n",
