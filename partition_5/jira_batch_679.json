Restart JIRA.\r\n# Navigate to *Administration \u00bb System \u00bb Plugin Data Storage* and verify what has been imported.\r\n\r\n\\\\\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nAll entries in the active objects table would have been imported/exported.\r\n\r\n\\\\\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n* *Exporting:* JIRA creates the backup normally, but upon inspecting the {{activeobjects.xml}} file (using the grep below) not all entries are in the file.\r\n* *Importing:* JIRA fails to import the data once it reaches 90%, but after restarting JIRA it seems to have imported correctly. Inspecting the *Plugin Data Storage* shows most tables as empty, and inspecting the {{activeobjects}} file shows all data.\r\n\r\nThe following errors might be found in the Jira logs:\r\nThe following errors might be seen in the logs:\r\n{code}\r\n2020-11-06 19:19:32,337-0500 JiraImportTaskExecutionThread-1 ERROR anonymous 528x1190x1 409hrc XX.XX.XX.XXX /secure/SetupImport.jspa [c.a.j.bc.dataimport.DefaultDataImportService] Error importing data: java.lang.OutOfMemoryError\r\njava.lang.OutOfMemoryError\r\n\tat java.lang.AbstractStringBuilder.hugeCapacity(AbstractStringBuilder.java:161)\r\n\tat java.lang.AbstractStringBuilder.newCapacity(AbstractStringBuilder.java:155)\r\n\tat java.lang.AbstractStringBuilder.ensureCapacityInternal(AbstractStringBuilder.java:125)\r\n\tat java.lang.AbstractStringBuilder.append(AbstractStringBuilder.java:448)\r\n\tat java.lang.StringBuilder.append(StringBuilder.java:136)\r\n\tat java.lang.StringBuilder.append(StringBuilder.java:76)\r\n{code}\r\n\r\n{code}\r\n[2020-08-20 01:00:16,045-0400 JiraImportTaskExecutionThread-1 ERROR test 1002x937x1 1fztp06 XXXXXXXXX /secure/admin/XmlRestore.jspa [c.a.j.bc.dataimport.DefaultDataImportService] Error importing data: java.lang.OutOfMemoryError020-08-20 01:00:16,045-0400 JiraImportTaskExecutionThread-1 ERROR test 1002x937x1 test XXXXXX /secure/admin/XmlRestore.jspa [c.a.j.bc.dataimport.DefaultDataImportService] Error importing data: java.lang.OutOfMemoryErrorjava.lang.OutOfMemoryError)\r\n{code}\r\n\r\n{code}\r\n2019-03-18 07:36:01,857 JiraImportTaskExecutionThread-1 ERROR test 381x754x1 1py7sdr XXXXXXXX /secure/admin/XmlRestore.jspa [c.a.j.bc.dataimport.DefaultDataImportService] Error importing data: java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space\r\njava.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space\r\n{code}\r\n\r\n(!)

Because of this, it would be nice if the wording changed.\r\n\r\nThe button could change from {{Create with shared configuration}} to {{Clone Existing Project Configuration}} (similar to cloning plans/deployments in Bamboo).\r\n\r\nIn addition, the title of the next screen \"Create with shared configuration\" would read \"Clone with existing project configuration\".\r\n\r\nIn addition, the description of the next screen \"Select the existing project that you'd like to share configurations with.\" would read \"Select the existing project that you'd like to clone the configuration of.\"\r\n\r\nIn addition, the warning message \"When a configuration is shared with several projects, it means that any changes made to the configuration will affect all the projects.\" on the next page could say \"While project configuration schemes are shared between projects, it means that any changes made to the configuration will affect all the projects.\"\r\n\r\nIf this feature ever becomes similar to JRA-7020, this could be rolled back.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n*Update*\r\n\r\nSince the word \"Clone\" implies doing something that the functionality does not really provide, the suggestion to call it \"Shared Schemes\" or \"Use existing Schemes\" instead of \"Shared configuration\" makes it much clear to understand what exactly will be done.\u00a0",

Summary\r\n\r\nThe @mention feature of JIRA is failing to find some users (mostly ones with names starting with the initial letter of the domain) because the javascript responsible for this feature performs a filter over the results of a query via a REST call which is limited to 10 results. The REST call returns users which match the query string (username parameter in the rest call) based on if it exists in EITHER the username, display name, or email address. Because normally the domain matches many users email address, searching for users starting with the initial letter of the domain, will be filtered out. \r\ne.g: mike@mydomain.com may be filtered out when searching for m if there are many more users with @mydomain.com email address and at least 10 users alphabetically before mike.\r\nh3. Environment\r\n\r\nAffected version: 7.0.0-OD-08\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Create 11 users with the same domain email address. eg: @example.com\r\n # Name the first 10 users with Letters before e\r\n # Name the 11th user 'example'\r\n # Try to mention the user in a comment.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nIf you use the complete username, or display name, the user should always appear.\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nUsing the complete username or display name, doesn't show the user because the rest api is returning 10 previous users (but not displaying them as options)\r\nh3. Notes\r\n\r\nWhen troubleshooting, take into consideration that you may need to refocus the comment box for the search to be done: JRA-59304\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\n*Partial workaround*\r\nTry with a different user value (if you tried with username, try display name, or last name). The last name value works particularly well as it is quite unique.\r\n\r\n*Confirmed workaround*\r\nTyping the first few characters of a user's name and hitting the {{TAB}} button will autocomplete and allow for the user to be mentioned (until you refresh the page) _e.g. John = Joh...{{TAB}}_",

Problem Definition\r\nAt the moment, upgrading JIRA using installer will perform the following:\r\n# Creating backup of the installation directory\r\n# Deleting the installation directory\r\n# Extracting the installer, and so on\r\n\r\nWhen extracting the installer, it will check the available memory space. If user does not have enough space, user is required to cancel the upgrading process half way. By doing so, the next time user tries to upgrade, he will lose the \"upgrade\" option, and will be presented with new installation instead, since the installation directory has been deleted during the initial attempt.\r\n\r\nh5. Suggested Solution\r\nJIRA should check the memory space available before proceeding with the upgrading process (deleting the installation directory, and so on)",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-45820].\n  {panel}\n\nAfter a recent issue with upgrading JIRA (where older Java version was not supported anymore), I was surprised that the JIRA installer did not check for prerequisites during installation (I am talking about Windows installer upgrading an existing installation). It's my fault completely for failing to read the supported platforms page at all, but nevertheless it would still be nice to prevent people from shooting themselves in the foot (and possibly reducing number of support requests in the long run).\r\n\r\nThere are at least two places I can think of where a \"fail fast\" approach would be of more help:\r\n\r\n1. JIRA Installer should check which Java version is installed and fail if it is not supported.\r\n2. Batch scripts for the JIRA service installation should *not* try to guess the JIRA path, but instead fail immediately if {{JRE_HOME}} and {{JAVA_HOME}} are not defined. Otherwise it's easy to get the incorrect Java instance running for the Tomcat service, even though there are no warnings during installation. Right now the script checks {{JRE_HOME}}, then {{JAVA_HOME}} and then defaults to a bundled JRE installation (and the resulting folder looks \"funny\" like described [here|https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/31662205/answers/31663637]).\r\n\r\nFinally, docs on configuring {{JAVA_HOME}} should be clarified to remove ambiguities. All over the Atlassian site, it's suggested to define {{JAVA_HOME}} to point to Java *JRE* folder. On the other hand, if you install Bamboo, it requires that {{JAVA_HOME}} is pointing to Java *JDK*. Even the batch script which installs JIRA as a service first checks if {{JRE_HOME}} is defined, instead of {{JAVA_HOME}}.\r\n\r\nIt seems a correct setup would be:\r\n- {{JAVA_HOME}} - points to JDK (needed for Bamboo, and not needed at all if you are only running JIRA),\r\n- {{JRE_HOME}} - points to JRE (also including the bundled JRE)\r\n- service scripts checks if they are indeed pointing to correct folders and fails as soon as one of these variables is configured incorrectly.",

In current JIRA, each time you create new role, they appear in project role. Some role have almost same name than other role, and they aren't used by this project.\r\nIf we can choose a schema of role we can choose the role used by project only and hide unused roles (that allow to see needed role only and we aren't flooded by not needed role).\r\nThanks in advance for your help.\r\nSorry if suggestion already exist but i don't see it.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nMickael",

Environment\r\n\r\nNo Look & Feel changes were made, nor were advanced settings for dates configured - everything is left as the default.\r\n\r\nh3.

Problem Definition\r\nCurrently by default JIRA doesn't allow any two factor authentication.\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\nIt would be great if we could integrate JIRA with Radius server which will allow two factor authentication to be setup with ease \r\n\r\nh3. Customer justification\r\n{panel}\r\nWe want to open up JIRA outside of the network for external consultants, but due to strict policies we have to have two-factor authentication in place.\r\nWe used Duo Security for a while. They had made a plugin for JIRA that made this possible. If you tried to log on to JIRA outside of our network, Duo's system kicked in and asked for authentication via sms / mobile app. Upon succesfull authentication you were then routed into JIRA. \r\nUnfortunetly they havent kept the plugin up to date, so it stopped working with newer versions of JIRA.\r\nAll of our internal users have access to JIRA functions via their Active Directory user (be it jira-users or customers for our JSD), and with a Radius server in between to handle the authentication of the users we could use Duo Integration with Radius to get the two-factor solution in place using their AD users.\r\n{panel}",

I've done JIRA work for two very large, public companies and I know for a fact that they have business projects that aren't remotely related to software but still use Agile methods. I even have a personal instance of JIRA which I use to track my work and I want to use Agile boards for non-software projects. I do think it is a good idea to make Source Management project specific.\r\n\r\nAllow us to pick and choose which projects get Agile and Source Management but don't bundle it into \"Project Types\".",
