The in-line edit behavior of label-type fields is inconsistent when the field is removed from the edit screen.\r\n * This behavior has changed between JIRA versions.

Perhaps something like the following would be more appropriate:\r\n\"Thank you.

Suggestion\r\n\r\nHowever, in line with CWD-3484, a more generic wording should be used in JIRA as well:\r\n{quote}\r\nThanks! If we recognise that email address, you should receive a link to reset your password via email soon. If you don't receive an email in the next five minutes, check your spam folder or try again with a different email address.\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nOur additional suggestion:\r\n{quote}\r\nPlease also make sure to not include a leading or trailing whitespace (e.g. by copying and pasting your user name.\r\n{quote}",

[See the corresponding bug report|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-44681].\n  {panel}\n\nh3. Summary\r\nOn JIRA 7 when using the jira-misc-workflow-extensions 'Transition Parent issue', some transitions will fail if the parent transition cannot be completed\r\nh3. Environment\r\nJIRA 7\r\nPlugin: [JIRA Misc Workflow Extensions|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.innovalog.jmwe.jira-misc-workflow-extensions]\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Create a workflow with the following post function: On Open to In Progress: \"Transition Parent with ID X\" (transition parent issue from open to in progress for example)\r\n# Create a Task and put it to the 'In Progress' Status\r\n# Create a subtask and transition it from Open to In Progress (the transition where you've configured the post function in step 1)\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nIn JIRA 6.X the Sub Task transitions normally, an error will be logged but the transition completes.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nIn JIRA 7, the Parent Task can't be transition using the ID because that transition only applies to the Open status.\r\nSince the Parent Task can't be transitioned, the Sub Task now also fails to transition.\r\n{noformat}\r\n2015-08-04 10:31:09,435 ajp-nio-127.0.0.104-8009-exec-177 ERROR n06963 631x33611x2 27g572 160.67.51.136,131.103.27.33 /secure/WorkflowUIDispatcher.jspa [c.a.jira.workflow.OSWorkflowManager] Caught exception while attempting to perform action 4 from workflow 111781 on issue 'EX-1'\r\n@4000000055c078571a3be394 com.opensymphony.workflow.InvalidActionException: Action 4 is invalid\r\n@4000000055c078571a3be394       at com.opensymphony.workflow.AbstractWorkflow.doAction(AbstractWorkflow.java:559)\r\n@4000000055c078571a3c0aa4       at com.atlassian.jira.workflow.OSWorkflowManager.doWorkflowActionInsideTxn(OSWorkflowManager.java:995)\r\n@4000000055c078571a3c0e8c       at com.atlassian.jira.workflow.OSWorkflowManager.doWorkflowAction(OSWorkflowManager.java:947)\r\n@4000000055c078571a3c0e8c       at com.atlassian.jira.workflow.WorkflowTransitionUtilImpl.progress(WorkflowTransitionUtilImpl.java:417)\r\n@4000000055c078571a3c1274       at com.innovalog.jmwe.plugins.functions.TransitionParentIssueFunction.executeFunction(TransitionParentIssueFunction.java:78)\r\n@4000000055c078571a3c1a44       at com.innovalog.jmwe.plugins.functions.AbstractPreserveChangesPostFunction.execute(AbstractPreserveChangesPostFunction.java:123)\r\n@4000000055c078571a3c1a44       at com.opensymphony.workflow.AbstractWorkflow.executeFunction(AbstractWorkflow.java:1050)\r\n@4000000055c078571a3c29e4       at com.opensymphony.workflow.AbstractWorkflow.transitionWorkflow(AbstractWorkflow.java:1446)\r\n@4000000055c078571a3c29e4       at com.opensymphony.workflow.AbstractWorkflow.doAction(AbstractWorkflow.java:564)\r\n@4000000055c078571a3c2dcc       at com.atlassian.jira.workflow.OSWorkflowManager.doWorkflowActionInsideTxn(OSWorkflowManager.java:995)\r\n@4000000055c078571a3c31b4       at com.atlassian.jira.workflow.OSWorkflowManager.doWorkflowAction(OSWorkflowManager.java:947)\r\n@4000000055c078571a3c359c       at com.atlassian.jira.bc.issue.DefaultIssueService.transition(DefaultIssueService.java:500)\r\n@4000000055c078571a3c3984       at com.atlassian.jira.web.action.workflow.SimpleWorkflowAction.doExecute(SimpleWorkflowAction.java:32)\r\n@4000000055c078571a3c3984       ... 1 filtered\r\n@4000000055c078571a3c3d6c       at com.atlassian.jira.action.JiraActionSupport.execute(JiraActionSupport.java:67)\r\n@4000000055c078571a3c4154       ... 7 filtered\r\n@4000000055c078571a3c4154       at javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet.service(HttpServlet.java:725)\r\n@4000000055c078571a3c453c       ... 50 filtered\r\n...\r\n@4000000055c078572c0d90a4 2015-08-04 10:31:09,729 ajp-nio-127.0.0.104-8009-exec-177 ERROR n06963 631x33611x2 27g572 160.67.51.136,131.103.27.33 /secure/WorkflowUIDispatcher.jspa [c.a.jira.transaction.TransactionSupportImpl] Unable to commit transaction : Commit failed, rollback previously requested by nested transaction.\r\n@4000000055c078572c0da044 org.ofbiz.core.entity.GenericTransactionException: Commit failed, rollback previously requested by nested transaction.\r\n@4000000055c078572c0da42c       at org.ofbiz.core.entity.TransactionUtil.commitLocalTransaction(TransactionUtil.java:342)\r\n@4000000055c078572c0dc754       at com.atlassian.core.ofbiz.util.CoreTransactionUtil.commit(CoreTransactionUtil.java:46)\r\n@4000000055c078572c0dcb3c       at com.atlassian.jira.transaction.TransactionSupportImpl$TransactionImpl.commit(TransactionSupportImpl.java:94)\r\n@4000000055c078572c0dd30c       at com.atlassian.jira.workflow.OSWorkflowManager.doWorkflowActionInsideTxn(OSWorkflowManager.java:1012)\r\n@4000000055c078572c0dd6f4       at com.atlassian.jira.workflow.OSWorkflowManager.doWorkflowAction(OSWorkflowManager.java:947)\r\n@4000000055c078572c0df634       at com.atlassian.jira.bc.issue.DefaultIssueService.transition(DefaultIssueService.java:500)\r\n@4000000055c078572c0dfa1c       at com.atlassian.jira.web.action.workflow.SimpleWorkflowAction.doExecute(SimpleWorkflowAction.java:32)\r\n@4000000055c078572c0e0da4       ... 1 filtered\r\n@4000000055c078572c0e118c       at com.atlassian.jira.action.JiraActionSupport.execute(JiraActionSupport.java:67)\r\n@4000000055c078572c0e1574       ... 7 filtered\r\n@4000000055c078572c0e1574       at javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet\r\n{noformat}\r\n \r\nh3.

When you use transition names, if the specified transition is not applicable for the current status of the parent (or linked) issue, a WARN will be logged but the current transition (on the subtask) will complete successfully.\r\n\r\nA fix will be applied shortly to JMWE to provide the same behavior when specifying transition IDs.",
