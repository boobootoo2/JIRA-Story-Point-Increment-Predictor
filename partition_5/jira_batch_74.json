      "description": "TortoiseSVN allows doing commits across working copies. I used that quite a lot because some of our projects span multiple repositories. For example in one project the frontend and backend code is separate, but in periods we need to do development in both. In TortoiseSVN I could select both working copies (in Windows Explorer), select commit, type a message, and hit go. It would then do a commit with the same message for all selected working copies.\r\n\r\nThe other great thing about that is that I'm able to see all the changes I've done across working copies.\r\n\r\nIn SourceTree I have to perform one commit per repository I have touched, usually having to copy the commit message since it's often the same. Additionally I have to jump between repository tabs to figure out what exactly I have changed everywhere. \r\n\r\nDon't know how easy it is to fix?\r\n\r\nh3. My suggested solution\r\n\r\n- Current bookmark side panel supports creating folders for repositories.\r\n- Allow opening up a folder as a tab\r\n- The tab should show a merged view of at least File Status (not sure how easy it is to show a merged view of File History?)\r\n- The tab should allow committing cross repositories. I.e. do one commit to each affected repository with the same message",

(See what happens in Sourcetree after restart.png) It also doesn't move the tab bar to the position of the opened repo. So, although the right repo is opened after a restart, you have to move the tab bar to find which repo is shown.\r\n\r\nA more annoying issue is resetting the settings after changing the tabs from one repo to the other and coming back to the same repo. After changing tabs, the file viewer will again move the vertical splitter to the middle (tile settings are gone). (See this in sourcetree after chaning tabs.png) It also doesn't remember which file was selected to show and jumps back to the first file in the list.\r\n\r\nIt would be best to have sourcetree remember these settings. Also, please change the default setting to split the screen based on the filename lengths at least. When filenames are short it is basically wasting the space by setting the splitter to the middle.",

      "description": "The upgrade of SourceTree 1.6 in the past few months changed the way the stage/unstage screen looks. In the past it was intuitive. It contained the unstaged files in the lower section and the staged files in the upper section. If files needed to be staged, you'd select them and click the single arrow that points towards the stage screen. If all files needed to be staged, you'd click the double arrow that point towards the stage screen. The same mechanism for unstaging files. Everybody seemed to understand this right from the start. At least in our team.\r\n\r\nThen with the upgrade to 1.6 this was changed to having checkmarks. Marking a single file immediately stages it. Marking the parent checkbox, stages all unstaged files. This is very counter intuitive. Nobody in our team understand why this was done. Checkmarks are typically used for preselecting items, with which you want to do an action later on.\r\n\r\nSo in short: It would be great if SourceTree would have the old staging screen again. Not only was there, from our point of view, no reason to change it, it was also more user friendly and intuitive than the one that is currently in place.\r\n\r\nThe discussion below the release notes of 1.6 sum this up quite nicely.

      "description": "The behavior of the checkboxes next to the list of staged/unstaged files is rather confusing.  Typically a checkbox is used to indicate the status of a users selection.  As such, I do not expect that it immediately trigger an action.  Rather it should be used as part of a two step process where a user selects an item (or items) and then choose an action to take on the selected items.\r\n\r\nSince upgrading to 1.6.x I frequently find myself (mistakenly) selecting the checkbox next to an unstaged file intending to select a list of files to apply a the same action to each.  Every time I do this I'm frustrated to see the selected file immediately moved to the staged files list.  The expected behavior (select multiple items to perform an action upon) is only possible by shift-clicking the files desired, then selecting an action from the right-click context menu.\r\n\r\nI found the arrows in 1.5.x to be far less confusing than the current checkbox based UI.  \r\n\r\nPlease consider making the checkboxes behave properly as a selection control or change to another control (perhaps the arrows from 1.5.x)",

Fetch new tags and prune branches via separate commands unless some other arrangement of flags provides the intended result.  When not selecting the checkbox to fetch new tags, the prune appears to work.

The \"open in explorer\" button in the commit panel is not translated in french. The correct translation should be \"Ouvrir dans l'explorateur\".\r\n\r\n\r\nbq. Another translation issue is the \"Push changes immediately to origin/master\" should be translated to \"Envoyer les changements imm\u00e9diatement sur origin/master\".\r\n\r\nbq. The commit options dropdown looks really strange and should probably simply say \"Options\", \"Options de la validation\" or \"Options de la commission\" but the later ones looks really strange, i'd simply use \"Options\" as even the frenchies use Commit, at least thats what we do here in Quebec/Canada.\r\n\r\n{quote}\r\nAll the options under the commit options look really weird. Following strings suggested;\r\n\"Amender la derni\u00e8re modification\"\r\n\"Ne pas \u00e9x\u00e9cuter les hooks\"\r\n\"Signer la modification\"\r\n\"Cr\u00e9er un pull request\"\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nbq. You may see we are not using all french words as most developpers use anglicisms. Hooks are not \"Crochet\" in french unless you want the direct translation of \"a hook\" like in \"Peter pan\", \"Pull request\" has no equivalent in french too so would suggest just using Pull request!\r\n\r\n",
