However, in practice, Lucene's stemming strips quotes from words, so you don't need to specify a quote. Also, it's not actually searching for the quote.\r\n\r\nTry this:\r\n\r\n# Create a simple search {{chalk cheese}}. It matches both {{chalk}} OR {{cheese}}.\r\n# Add quotes around it. It now matches the exact phrase {{chalk cheese}}.\r\n# Switch to Advanced search. Notice the two sets of quotes. The _outer_ quotes are grouping the search term so JQL doesn't get confused. The _inner_ quotes, the escaped ones, are specifying an exact string match (creating a 'phrase' in our terminology).\r\n\r\nSo, actually, you can't escape a quotes character.\r\n\r\nUsually I'd do a docs fix myself, but in this case I think it's worth discussing with a developer to find the expected behavior and document it based on that. Note the related bug report JRA-21047. \r\n",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-22469].\n  {panel}\n\nWhen creating a project with the Plugin SDK (version 3.2) one gets a pom with those dependencies:\r\n{code:xml}\r\n    <dependencies>\r\n        <dependency>\r\n            <groupId>com.atlassian.jira</groupId>\r\n            <artifactId>atlassian-jira</artifactId>\r\n            <version>${jira.version}</version>\r\n            <scope>provided</scope>\r\n        </dependency>        \r\n        <dependency>\r\n            <groupId>junit</groupId>\r\n            <artifactId>junit</artifactId>\r\n            <version>4.6</version>\r\n            <scope>test</scope>\r\n        </dependency>\r\n        <dependency>\r\n            <groupId>com.atlassian.jira</groupId>\r\n            <artifactId>jira-func-tests</artifactId>\r\n            <version>${jira.version}</version>\r\n            <scope>test</scope>\r\n        </dependency>\r\n    </dependencies>\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nThe {{jira.version}} is set to 4.1.2 in this case.\r\n\r\nWhat happens is that when someone uses the servlet API in their, as it is sometimes required by JIRA's own API usage, it doesn't compile. Looking at the dependency tree for the servlet-api make it obvious:\r\n\r\nFirst running:\r\n{noformat}\r\nmvn dependency:tree -Dincludes=*:servlet-api:*:*\r\n\r\n[INFO] [dependency:tree]\r\n[INFO] com.atlassian.plugins.tutorial:jira-report-plugin:atlassian-plugin:1.0-SNAPSHOT\r\n[INFO] \\- com.atlassian.jira:jira-func-tests:jar:4.1.2:test\r\n[INFO]    \\- javax.servlet:servlet-api:jar:2.3:test\r\n\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nIt shows that the servlet-api's scope is {{test}}, when one expects it to be {{provided}}. \r\n\r\n{noformat}\r\nmvn dependency:tree -Dincludes=*:servlet-api:*:* -Dverbose\r\n\r\n[INFO] [dependency:tree]\r\n[INFO] com.atlassian.plugins.tutorial:jira-report-plugin:atlassian-plugin:1.0-SNAPSHOT\r\n[INFO] +- com.atlassian.jira:atlassian-jira:jar:4.1.2:provided\r\n[INFO] |  +- com.atlassian.ofbiz:atlassian-ofbiz:jar:2.7.3:provided\r\n[INFO] |  |  \\- (javax.servlet:servlet-api:jar:2.3:provided - omitted for duplicate)\r\n[INFO] |  +- com.atlassian.plugins:atlassian-plugins-webresource:jar:2.4.4:provided\r\n[INFO] |  |  \\- (javax.servlet:servlet-api:jar:2.3:provided - omitted for duplicate)\r\n[INFO] |  +- com.atlassian.security.auth.trustedapps:atlassian-trusted-apps-core:jar:2.1:provided\r\n[INFO] |  |  \\- (javax.servlet:servlet-api:jar:2.3:provided - omitted for duplicate)\r\n[INFO] |  +- com.atlassian.gzipfilter:atlassian-gzipfilter:jar:1.9:provided\r\n[INFO] |  |  \\- (javax.servlet:servlet-api:jar:2.3:provided - omitted for duplicate)\r\n[INFO] |  +- org.apache.velocity:velocity-tools:jar:1.3:provided\r\n[INFO] |  |  \\- (javax.servlet:servlet-api:jar:2.3:provided - omitted for duplicate)\r\n[INFO] |  \\- commons-jelly:commons-jelly:jar:1.0:provided\r\n[INFO] |     \\- (javax.servlet:servlet-api:jar:2.3:provided - omitted for duplicate)\r\n[INFO] \\- com.atlassian.jira:jira-func-tests:jar:4.1.2:test\r\n[INFO]    +- net.sourceforge.jwebunit:jwebunit:jar:1.2-atlassian-1:test\r\n[INFO]    |  \\- (javax.servlet:servlet-api:jar:2.3:test - omitted for duplicate)\r\n[INFO]    +- com.meteware.httpunit:httpunit:jar:1.5.4-atlassian-8:test\r\n[INFO]    |  \\- (javax.servlet:servlet-api:jar:2.3:test - omitted for duplicate)\r\n[INFO]    \\- javax.servlet:servlet-api:jar:2.3:test\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nThis shows that the servler-api is NOT a direct dependency of {{atlassian-jira}} when I believe it should be.

If a clause returns too many results, the entire search will fail. Please refine or remove the clause and try the search again.{panel} \r\n\r\nThis is not acceptable. \r\n\r\nDiving into the code with remote debug running, I see that the problem is that a search is being made on the comment index and then each hit from this is converted to an issue_id {{TermQuery}}. Each of these {{TermQuery}}'s are collected in one massive {{BooleanQuery}}. That query with over 65000 term queries is then run against the issue index. Since the word *bug* appears in more than 65000 comments in our Jira, this causes the TooManyClauses exception.\r\n\r\nIn Jira 3 the same query would search the comment index and then the hits were converted to an {{IssueIdFilter}} which was wrapped with a {{FilteredQuery}}.\r\nThis is faster and doesn't cause the TooManyClauses exception.\r\n\r\nPlease resurrect {{IssueIdFilter}} rather than using a {{BooleanQuery}} of individual {{TermQuery}}'s of issue id's inside {{CommentClauseQueryFactory}}.\r\n\r\nAnother improvement would be to collect the issue id's in a set since issues can have more than one comment.\r\n\r\nWith the improvement that I suggested in JRA-22448 to speed up comment searching by using a {{HitCollector}} rather than looping over the hits returned from the comment index, our {{CommentClauseQueryFactory.generateIssueIdQueryFromCommentQuery}} now looks like this\r\n\r\n{code:java}\r\n   QueryFactoryResult generateIssueIdQueryFromCommentQuery(final Query commentIndexQuery, final QueryCreationContext creationContext) {\r\n      try \r\n      {\r\n         // Now we need to execute the search and build up a new query that enumerates the issue id's found by the comment search\r\n         final Searcher commentSearcher = searchProviderFactory.getSearcher(SearchProviderFactory.COMMENT_INDEX);\r\n         final Filter filter = getPermissionsFilter(creationContext.isSecurityOverriden(), creationContext.getUser());\r\n         final Collection<String> ids = new HashSet<String>(10000);\r\n         final HitCollector hitCollector = new DocumentHitCollector(commentSearcher) {\r\n            @Override\r\n            public void collect(Document doc) {\r\n               ids.add(doc.get(DocumentConstants.ISSUE_ID));\r\n            }\r\n         };\r\n         // JRA-19306 - lets restrict this search by the permissions filter so we can try to avoid the MAX_CLAUSES limit\r\n         // Perform the search against the comment index\r\n         if(filter == null) \r\n         {\r\n            commentSearcher.search(commentIndexQuery, hitCollector);\r\n         }\r\n         else \r\n         {\r\n            commentSearcher.search(commentIndexQuery, filter, hitCollector);\r\n         }\r\n         // Create a query that will be run against the issue index with the issue ids from the search hits\r\n         return new QueryFactoryResult(new ConstantScoreQuery(new IssueIdFilter(ids)));\r\n      }\r\n      catch(final IOException e) \r\n      {\r\n         log.error(\"Unable to search the comment index - returning false result.\", e);\r\n         return QueryFactoryResult.createFalseResult();\r\n      }\r\n   }\r\n{code}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
