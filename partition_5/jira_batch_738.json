Summary\r\n\r\nCurrently it appears the /rest/api/2/user (PUT) API doesn't provide facility to set users active or inactive, or perhaps the request representation doesn't include how this is done. Currently the API works fine for the following fields:\r\n{code}\r\n{\r\n    \"name\": \"eddie\",\r\n    \"emailAddress\": \"eddie@atlassian.com\",\r\n    \"displayName\": \"Eddie of Atlassian\"\r\n}\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nCan something like {{\"Active\": 1}} or {{\"Active\": true}} be made available for this API as well to set the Activate or de-activate a user?\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nUse Crowd REST API following these steps:\r\n# Go to User Management -> JIRA User Server\r\n# Create a new one with the below details (you can use your own values):\r\n#* Application Name: app_name\r\n#* Password: app_pwd\r\n#* IP Addresses: Insert the IP/s (each on a separate line) of the client from where the subsequent REST call is to be run (to whitelist it so that the REST call is allowed to run)\r\n# Test with this command:\r\n#* If Linux:\r\n{code}\r\ncurl -D- -u app_name:app_pwd -X PUT --data '{\"name\":\"anyUsername\", \"active\":\"false\"}' <jira-url>/rest/usermanagement/1/user?username=anyUsername -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'Accept: application/json'\r\n{code}\r\n#* If Windows:\r\n{code}\r\ncurl -D- -u app_name:app_pwd -X PUT --data \"{\\\"name\\\":\\\"anyUsername\\\", \\\"active\\\":\\\"false\\\"}\" <jira-url>/rest/usermanagement/1/user?username=anyUsername -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -H \"Accept: application/json\"\r\n{code}\r\n(+) Use the right username (*anyUsername* - 2 occurences) and replace <jira-url> with actual JIRA URL",

It's been happening the past couple of versions--since around November of 2013. \r\n\r\nWhen this first happened I checked my permissions--I'm an administrator --but was given system administration permissions and I still got the error. When I went to create that project again--it said that name and ID code was already in use. After logging out and in a few times, the project finally appeared and I could apply permissions, notifications, etc. \r\n\r\nWe are running 6.1. We can't figure out what is happening. I've searched your support area and find nothing--looking at the user/ permission area of your documentation has not helped. We should be fine!\r\n\r\nWe want to upgrade to 6.2 but when we took a look at it in our dev environment we cannot successfully create a project at all. Still get the permissions violation--but no project ever, ever gets created. Though it won't let me use that project name/id. I fear that we'll lose the ability to successfully create a project if we put 6.2 into production and I know there's security vulnerability fix. The permission violation has been a pain (and haven't had a chance to raise the issue--until now) but at least the project eventually showed up.\r\n\r\nI have a sys admin dwagley@keymind.com who maintains the server/db,etc. \r\n\r\nWe are running Java 1.7.0_25\r\npostgres72 8.4.20\r\nOS: Linux 2.6.32-431.5.1.e16x86_64\r\nApache Tomcat/7.0.29\r\nJIRA: 6.1.1.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n",

Problem Definition\r\nIn support from time to time, we get users who have renewed a plugin license key, contact us about trouble updating the license key, or guidiance finding where to put the new license key. Below is a screenshot of what the plugin details screen where the license key is updated in the UPM looks like:\r\n!license.png|width=100%!\r\n\r\nExample of feedback we got from 2 customers recently is:\r\nbq. I actually checked that screen like ten times for a way to enter the new license but always overlooked that pencil button. It might make sense to provide a direct link to the license setting when a license did expire.\r\n\r\nbq. Manually installing the licence did work. But finding the Pen Button besides the licence key was not easy\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\nUpdating the license key is not something that people have to do often, it's perhaps understandable that it's a bit out of sight. However, perhaps we can create a more intuitive way to update plugin license keys, especially after a plugin license has expired? Perhaps a notification that logged in Admins can see, which when clicked, pops up a field to paste-in  the license key directly. This could then automatically direct the user to the updated plugin screen page as a confirmation.",

Steps to replicate:\r\n# Modify the default priorities to match the below:\r\n{noformat:borderStyle=dashed| borderColor=#6A8EB3 |bgColor=#F8F8F8}\r\n id | sequence |  pname  \r\n----+----------+---------\r\n 1  |        1 | Blocker\r\n 2  |        2 | 1\r\n 3  |        3 | 2\r\n 4  |        4 | 3\r\n 5  |        5 | 4\r\n{noformat}\r\n# Use the Issue Navigator to search for:\r\n{noformat:borderStyle=dashed| borderColor=#6A8EB3 |bgColor=#F8F8F8}\r\npriority = \"3\"\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Behavior:\r\nJIRA will return any issues with priority = 2 or 3 as the ID of priority '2' is 3.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Behavior:\r\nJIRA would see that \"3\" (with quotes) is a priority name and would only return results by the name. Alternatively, would show a message explaining why it is returning both.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround:\r\n* Use the following to search:\r\n{code:SQL| borderStyle=dashed| borderColor=#6A8EB3 |bgColor=#F8F8F8}\r\n priority = \"3\" AND priority != \"2\"\r\n{code}\r\n* Or rename the priorities (e.g.: \"Level 3\").\r\n\r\nh3. Dangerous Workaround:\r\n\r\nThis workaround is dangerous because it involves direct DB modification, and the order of operations is important if you are switching positions of any two items. You MUST test this on a staging environment first, and take a full backup prior to doing this in production. This is an example:\r\n\r\n{code}update priority set id = '4' where sequence = '4';\r\nupdate priority set id = '3' where sequence = '3';\r\nupdate priority set id = '5' where sequence = '5';\r\nupdate jiraissue set priority = '3' where priority = '4';\r\nupdate jiraissue set priority = '4' where priority = '8';\r\nupdate jiraissue set priority = '5' where priority = '10000';\r\nupdate changeitem set newstring = '3', newvalue = '3' where field = 'priority' and newvalue = '4';\r\nupdate changeitem set newstring = '4', newvalue = '4' where field = 'priority' and newvalue = '8';\r\nupdate changeitem set newstring = '5', newvalue = '5' where field = 'priority' and newvalue = '10000';\r\nupdate changeitem set oldstring = '3', oldvalue = '3' where field = 'priority' and oldvalue = '4'\r\nupdate changeitem set oldstring = '4', oldvalue = '4' where field = 'priority' and oldvalue = '8';\r\nupdate changeitem set oldstring = '5', oldvalue = '5' where field = 'priority' and oldvalue = '10000';{code}\r\n\r\n(i) You must restart JIRA and re-index after performing these updates.",

      "description": "Dear all\r\nwe have upgraded from JIRA 4.4.5 to JIRA 6.1.7 today. After that, we have recognized that there are problems with message custom fields (for view and edit):\r\nwe use this type of field for displaying our own workflow-figures via having an html script as standard value of the particular field with links to the corresponding figure.\r\n\r\nSome (but not all) of the existing fields are kind of broken now. We cannot save any value in this field any more and the old standard values have disappeared.\r\nWithin one field, it also happens that one of the existing context is affected and anotherone not.\r\nThe biggest problem is that we even cannot save any value for this fields any more, JIRA simply does not save the value, but without any error message.\r\nMEans we even vannot restore the fields from backup data. I would need to create all fields from scratch as it seems that new fields (created within JIRA 6.1.7) are not affected.\r\n\r\nThis happens on all migrated systems (test system and production) means is reproducable for us.\r\n\r\nWe cannot switch to JIRA 6.2 as this migration has a lot of plugin-dependencies and is quite a lot of work for us. We need a fix for 6.1.7...\r\n\r\nthanks for your help, this is really quite urgent for us as we are having lots of different projects within JIRA (approx 300) which means a lot of different workflow-fields (message custom fields).\r\n\r\nbest regards\r\n\r\nBirgit Greiffenberg\r\n",

While you can use the FishEye plugin in JIRA to auto-update tickets based on changesets in FishEye, there is no way to do the opposite: auto-link to FishEye changesets from comments in JIRA.\r\n\r\nTrac handles this very well in that you can enter [123] or r123 and either will automatically link directly to changeset 123.  I understand that the FishEye scenario is slightly more complex in that there may be multiple projects in FishEye, so this may require adding a project key to FishEye like you have in JIRA and Bamboo.  So, I could do something like:\r\n\r\nHHH[123]\r\n\r\nin a comment in JIRA, and JIRA would automatically link it to changeset 123 within the HHH project in FishEye.\r\n{quote}",

However it was not and I have now discovered that the import not only changes the project that I wish to Import to but potentially could damage other projects...\r\n\r\nI suggest giving access to the import feature per default to project leads, because it is necessary to get an easy import and that it will be more convincing in regard of moving teams from other platforms to JIRA. When migrating, the import experience is the thing that could scare people away (make it or break it) from the platform if it is to tiresome/complex.\r\n\r\nAlso change the import to be isolated to the current project so that other projects still are 'safe' when doing imports would be a good idea.\r\n",
