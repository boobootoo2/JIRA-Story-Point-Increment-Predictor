I have users that like to create issues using email and want to get an email back that contains the new issue number in the subject.  From my understanding, currently they must either use the UI or set their profile to notify them of all changes.  As a suggestion, it would be great to have a \" on create issue only\" setting.  I guess this would also have to work in conjunction with the project notification scheme as I assume having \"Reporter\" in the create issue section only works when the user creates from the UI.

Only user with JIRA Administrators or JIRA System Administrators can edit user groups. In corporate settings with many non-public projects it would be helpful to be able to delegate the management of group memberships to project leads in order to relieve jira-admins of this task.\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\nCreation of user group will still be under JIRA Administrators or JIRA System Administrators, but Project Lead can add/remove users in the user groups. Better still, if there is \"membership-edit\" permission, so that JIRA Administrators or JIRA System Administrators can grant such permission to the respective Project Lead can perform add/remove users.",

[See the corresponding bug report|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-37337].\n  {panel}\n\nh3. Summary\r\n\r\nWe're seeing an increasing number of issues where customers are reporting initial page load times in excess of 10-15 seconds, and sometimes more.\r\n\r\nh3. Cause\r\n\r\nWhen accessing a page within JIRA, a set of {{batch.js}} and {{batch.css}} files are provided that contain the batched Javascript and CSS resources for the page. Upon first load of a page this cache is created (if it does not already exist on the server), and is then stored for future loads of the page. This cache is a server-side cache and is separate from the client-side cache (ie the cached {{batch.js}} and {{batch.css}} files in the browser). The creation of the cache can take some time - 10 to 15 seconds - so on first load of a page it will take some time for the page to load.\r\n\r\nOn first load of any page in JIRA it does download quite a lot of content, which is then cached in the browser, so it is expected that the first page-load will be longer than any subsequent page loads. This is exacerbated when the cache is being recreated as it adds even more time onto that page load. \r\n\r\nThe cache is created on a language/locale basis, so for example if users access a page in English it will be generated, and other users access pages in Russian it will be generated again. The cache is invalidated when there are Look & Feel changes, or plugin changes occur. This means if these changes occur the cache will need to be recreated and will cause page load times to increase until the cache is created and stored server-side. If there are users with a variety of different languages using the server it will mean the cache is recreated multiple times.\r\n\r\nIn certain cases where multiple concurrent requests take place they can end up all running the batch generation simultaneously, leading to the CPU spiking and the instance potentially becoming unresponsive while all the requests are processed. \r\n\r\nOnce a type of page has been visited per user (e.g. the dashboard, a JIRA issue or a project page) the {{batch.css}} will be cached for that type of page until the next restart or plugin change. So the first time you view one of these pages the performance will be slow, but it will improve significantly on each subsequent visit.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to reproduce\r\n# Go to any JIRA instance - this can be easily replicated with a jira-dev instance\r\n# Disable or enable a plugin\r\n# Load the dashboard\r\n\r\nLooking at the Network tab of developer tools, you'll see that there's a long delay in loading those batch files.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nSchedule plugin changes during off-peak periods, and then visit a page in JIRA to ensure the cache is recreated during that off-peak period.\r\n\r\n(!) *Note:* It is always best practice to schedule plugin installations and upgrades in off-peak periods or during maintenance windows. For JIRA Download customers it is also recommended to perform major plugin changes on a staging instance before it is done on a live environment. \r\n\r\nh3. Diagnosis\r\n\r\nFor one of the ways of identifying this problem, this will show us the number of threads waiting to process LESS compilation. A higher number over a series of thread dumps can be considered bad.\r\n\r\nThe below is being executed in a folder with a significant number of thread dumps labelled jstack that were taken over a series of days.\r\n\r\n{noformat}\r\n$ grep -B1 \"com.atlassian.plugin.cache.filecache.impl.CachedFile.stream\" jstack* |grep \"waiting to lock\" |awk '{print $1}' | sort |uniq -c\r\n  31 jstack.13007.110759.851358689-\r\n  58 jstack.13007.110810.528822009-\r\n  54 jstack.13007.110821.172461523-\r\n  42 jstack.4440.threadHigh.103649.939600529-\r\n  44 jstack.4440.threadHigh.103701.620551473-\r\n  48 jstack.4440.threadHigh.103713.178859435-\r\n  51 jstack.4440.threadHigh.103724.736087099-\r\n  57 jstack.4440.threadHigh.103736.376659166-\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nHere we see the thread dumps taken over time continue to consistently have a higher number of threads most likely waiting to compile LESS.

For example, if the user has been deleted or no long exist anymore in the directory, the JIRA administrator cannot close that issue simply because JIRA actually check and validate if the assignee is still belong to the directory. As an alternative we will need to reassign it to other users first before we can actually close the issue however this is quite tedious and troublesome if there are multiple users involved.\r\n\r\nh3. From a customer perspective:\r\n{panel}\r\nThe improvement is:\r\nIMHO, Jira could allow me (as an Administrator) to close an issue regardless of the current status of the assignee. The action I attempted was to only close the issue. I did not want Jira to (re)verify the status of the assignee, and then block the close action if the user is not found.\r\n{panel}",
