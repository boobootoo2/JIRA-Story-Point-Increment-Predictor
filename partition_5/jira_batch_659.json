PROBLEM:\r\nOne critical feature/functionality that is missing in JIRA is the ability to define a custom field based on a JQL. This is useful to seamlessly integrate different projects/processes within JIRA.\r\n\r\nExample: A select-field (or auto-complete, etc.) that its values are based on the issues from Project X with Status Y (this is defined via a JQL).\r\n\r\nh4. Workaround:\r\nThere are two primary plugins for this purpose. Each of these have certain deficiencies and are not reliable.\r\n* Query Issues Custom Fields\r\n* JQL Issue Select\r\n\r\nh4.

Summary\r\n\r\nIf a user shares a filter or dashboard with a group or project role, that user must be a member of the group or role being shared.\r\n\r\nThis check is also performed on existing entries on the share screen - therefore, if the user sharing the filter/dashboard is not a member of +all+ roles and groups selected for sharing, the share will fail.\r\n\r\nIn addition, for roles, the role name is obscured with \"Unknown Role\", making it hard for the user to correct the problem.\u00a0\r\nh4. How to reproduce - Dashboard\r\n # On a sample project where you are Project Admin, add your own user to the project role \"Developers\"\r\n # Create a new dashboard, then visit ... in top right, and choose Share\r\n # Share to the project, role -> Developers, and click Update.\r\n # Remove the user from the role on that project\r\n # Share the dashboard again:\r\n ## Note: the project role now says \"Unknown Role\"\r\n ## Try to add another role to share, say, Project Role -> Administrators, and click Update. It will fail with:\r\n{code:java}\r\nYou do not have permission to share with Project: 'SD' Role: [Unknown Role]. {code}\r\n\r\nh4. How to reproduce - Filter\r\n # On a sample project where you are Project Admin, add your own user to the project role \"Developers\"\r\n # Save a new filter, then click Issues Menu -> Manage Filters\r\n # Find your filter in the list, then click the Cog icon, then Edit\r\n # Share to the project, role -> Developers, and click Save.\r\n # Remove the user from the role on that project\r\n # Share the Filter again:\r\n ## Note: the project role now says \"Unknown Role\"\r\n ## Try to add another role to share, say, Project Role -> Administrators, and click Update. It will fail with:\r\n{code:java}\r\nYou do not have permission to share with Project: 'SD' Role: [Unknown Role]. {code}\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nThe user is still able to share the filter/dashboard\r\nh3.

Under _My Filters_ click the Filter, then click \u2018cog icon\u2019 >> \u2018Edit\u2019\r\n ## +For Dashboards+, Visit the dashboard, then choose [ ... ] -> Share Dashboard\r\n # Click the 'trash can' icon next to each group or role that you are not a member of\r\n ## (i) Roles needing to be removed will be displayed as \"unknown role\", however, groups will not show any indication.\r\n # Click Update\r\n ## (i) If an error is still shown, there are still additional group/role shares that will need to be 'trash can'ed\r\n\r\nh4. Workaround 2\r\n\r\nAdd the user back to the group/role. (this may cause changes in permission for this user, make sure to check this first).",

It can be quite large depending on the number of columns in the grid. Some customers report that they are getting error on saving of the custom field default value on the JIRA instances which use Oracle database. I checked it and noticed, that XMLVALUE column of the GENERICCONFIGURATION table that is used for this purpose has extremely short length(4000) whereas in other databases there is no limit at all on this column.\r\n\r\nAs the result some of our customers experience inconvenience working with Table Grid Editor on Oracle. Can you expand the length of the column or remove the limit at all in future versions?",

Summary\r\nConfluence search from JIRA Issue, which uses deprecated _confluence2.search_ of _xml-rpc_, does not work with some double-byte characters. REST API should be used instead.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Install Confluence 5.9.11 and JIRA Core 7.1.7 (latest), and applink them\r\n# On Confluence, enable Remote API\r\n# On Confluence, change indexing language to \"CJK\"\r\n# On Confluence, create a space and create these 2 pages:\r\n-- Title: Title-1 Body: \u30dc\u30c7\u30a3 (FYI, it is 'body' in Japanese)\r\n-- Title: Title-2 Body: \u30dc\u30c7\u30a3 (FYI, it is 'body' in Japanese)\r\n# On JIRA, create a project and a issue\r\n# On JIRA's Issue detail view, go to \"More\" -> \"Link\" -> \"Confluence Page\" -> \"search for a page\", and search Confluence pages by keyword \"\u30dc\u30c7\u30a3\"\r\n# No search results, although you get the results if you use the same search keyword on Confluence (i.e. <CONF_BASE_URL>/dosearchsite.action?queryString=\u30dc\u30c7\u30a3)\r\n\r\nSee also attached \"theProblem.jpg\"\r\n(!) This also impacts searching Jira Issues to Link issues.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nIt should show the 2 pages created in the above step\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nNo search results.\r\nThe below exception is thrown in the atlassian-confluence.log file:\r\n{noformat}\r\n2015-07-29 17:06:44,519 ERROR [http-nio-15806-exec-8] [confluence.rpc.auth.TokenAuthenticationInvocationHandler] invokeAuthenticatedMethod Error during invocation of method [search]\r\n -- url: /confluence15806/rpc/xmlrpc | userName: admin | method: search\r\njava.lang.StringIndexOutOfBoundsException: String index out of range: -1\r\n\tat java.lang.String.substring(String.java:1955)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.bonnie.search.summary.Summarizer.getSummary(Summarizer.java:164)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.confluence.util.GeneralUtil.makeSummary(GeneralUtil.java:1733)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.confluence.util.GeneralUtil.makeFlatSummary(GeneralUtil.java:1769)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.confluence.rpc.soap.beans.RemoteSearchResult.<init>(RemoteSearchResult.java:38)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.confluence.rpc.soap.services.PagesSoapService.search(PagesSoapService.java:431)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.confluence.rpc.soap.XhtmlSoapService.search(XhtmlSoapService.java:535)\r\n\tat sun.reflect.GeneratedMethodAccessor848.invoke(Unknown Source)\r\n\tat sun.reflect.DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.java:43)\r\n\tat java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Method.java:497)\r\n\tat org.springframework.aop.support.AopUtils.invokeJoinpointUsingReflection(AopUtils.java:307)\r\n\tat org.springframework.aop.framework.ReflectiveMethodInvocation.invokeJoinpoint(ReflectiveMethodInvocation.java:182)\r\n\tat org.springframework.aop.framework.ReflectiveMethodInvocation.proceed(ReflectiveMethodInvocation.java:149)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.spring.interceptors.SpringProfilingInterceptor.invoke(SpringProfilingInterceptor.java:16)\r\n\tat org.springframework.aop.framework.ReflectiveMethodInvocation.proceed(ReflectiveMethodInvocation.java:171)\r\n\tat org.springframework.transaction.interceptor.TransactionInterceptor.invoke(TransactionInterceptor.java:106)\r\n\tat org.springframework.aop.framework.ReflectiveMethodInvocation.proceed(ReflectiveMethodInvocation.java:171)\r\n\tat org.springframework.aop.framework.JdkDynamicAopProxy.invoke(JdkDynamicAopProxy.java:204)\r\n\tat com.sun.proxy.$Proxy1329.search(Unknown Source)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.confluence.rpc.xmlrpc.ConfluenceXmlRpcHandlerImpl.search(ConfluenceXmlRpcHandlerImpl.java:485)\r\n\tat sun.reflect.GeneratedMethodAccessor847.invoke(Unknown Source)\r\n{noformat}\r\n \r\nh3.

Problem Definition\r\nCurrently it is not possible to mention customers.\r\n\r\nIn a normal setting, the 'mentions' functions allows JIRA users to mention and pull an issue to the attention of another user not involved in the ticket. However, in the case of Agents, this functionality is useful where they have thousands of users all over the globe, it would not be easy or efficient to copy exact spelling of the customers names.\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\nAllow the agents to mention customers to bring easy and efficiency to agents dealing with customers without worrying about the exact spelling. This mentions, unlike in JIRA, will not send an email notification, but would rather just assist the agent in working more efficiently.\r\n",

At the very least, this should be consistent. \r\n\r\nThe parameters that lead to this are:\r\n# Sub tasks with time listed for estimate and remaining.\r\n# Include sub-tasks box checked in time-tracking widget the main issue viewing page. \r\n# Task times set <manually to sum of all sub-tasks> for estimated and 0 for remaining. \r\n\r\nThe inconsistency is a bug and should be resolved. However, there is a much bigger usability problem here between sub-tasks and time tracking that should be resolved. See your own support forum for example: https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/28328/jira-and-sub-tasks\r\nand https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/84349/rapid-board-time-estimates-with-sub-tasks\r\n\r\nThe sub-tasks (when include sub-task time is checked) should be included in BOTH the estimate and the remaining. This has been an ongoing issue for many users at EVERY company I have worked for that uses JIRA. For, what should really not be a complicated fix, why is there not at least an option for this?\r\n",
