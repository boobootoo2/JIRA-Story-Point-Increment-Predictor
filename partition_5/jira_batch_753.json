[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-35428].\n  {panel}\n\nHi Atlassian,\r\nLet me describe my Atlassian stack administrator story:\r\nOur project has own Atlassian stack (Jira/Confluence/Bamboo/Stash/Fisheye&Cru/Agile/Structure) for almost a year. We had to move from our company's Atlassian infrastructure because it's wasn't so flexible as we wanted and this infra didnt had as much features we have wanted. So we decided to move to our own Atlassian stack and we did a realy great job - we've created fully cross-integrated  stack with a lots of custom features including own macroses and plugins. \r\nI was the one who has designed and implemented almost all the features we have at the moment. I'm very happy to use such thoughtful&flexible tool  as Jira, Confluence, Bamboo, Stash and I'm excited every time I'm updating our Atlassian stack to a new major version with a lots of cool features.\r\nStarting from Jira 4 and Confluence 4 i'm using installers for Windows  because I found them very useful for many reasons. But.\r\nBut there is a thing that causing me a discomfort and sometimes a headache...\r\nAs it was told we have a lots of custom modifications that needs to be moved manualy(Proxy ops for tomcat, config modifications, custom plugins, libs and etc) and every time I start the update process using installer I'd like to have a checkbox that will say \"Start Jira|Confluence after the update is finished\" or \"Don't start Jira|Confluence after the update is finished\" and Jira or Confluence will not start before I will want it to start. Otherwise Jira(Confluence) usualy starts to do crazy things because of missing fields, spam Exceptions in logs,two times even database was corrupted and we had to rollback. Of Course I have the workaround but it's looks like a dirty-hack. I think my life (and not only mine;) ) will be much happier if your will add the mentioned checkbox to your installer.\r\n\r\nHope for your understanding!\r\n\r\nP.S. Many thanks to Atlassian team! You do outstanding things! ",

Problem Summary\r\nWhen shutting down Jira using it's built-in scripts ('stop-jira.sh', 'shutdown.sh' or 'catalina.sh stop'), the same memory allocation settings used by Jira will be read by the auxiliary Java process (org.apache.catalina.startup.Bootstrap) spun up to execute shutdown tasks.\r\n\r\nIf the lower boundary is set too high - sometimes equals to the upper boundary as recommended by Atlassian Support - it may not be able to execute as it will require effectively double the allocated memory available on the OS.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Behavior\r\nUse a lower, default memory allocation setup for the shutdown process separate to the one used by Jira's main Java process.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Behavior\r\nThe shutdown process fails.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Configure the memory settings for Jira so that the lower boundary is significantly more than half the available memory on the OS;\r\n# Start Jira and shut it down subsequently;\r\n\r\nObserve that the shutdown process will fail and throw an error similar to the following:\r\n\r\n{noformat:borderStyle=solid|borderColor=#6A8EB3|bgColor=#F8F8F8}\r\nJava HotSpot(TM\\) 64-Bit Server VM warning: INFO: os::commit_memory(0x0000000680000000, 5368709120, 0\\) failed; error='Cannot allocate memory' \\(errno=12\\)\r\n\\#\r\n\\# There is insufficient memory for the Java Runtime Environment to continue.\r\n\\# Native memory allocation \\(mmap\\) failed to map 5368709120 bytes for committing reserved memory.\r\n\\# An error report file with more information is saved as:\r\n\\# /opt/jira/bin/hs_err_pid25290.log\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nh3.

For instance, in our JIRA instance Requirements will be created primarily by the same small number of people, they don't want notifications on modifications, so we can't add the Reporter into the notification scheme.  However, in that same project, a much large set of users can create defects (bugs), and they do want to be notified on updates to those issues, so we want the reporter to be in the notification scheme for those issue types.  Due to issues such as this, our user base has resorted to filtering out all JIRA notifications to separate folders so that their inboxes are not flooded with emails.\r\n\r\nSo, if you could provide a scheme much like the Issue Type Screen Scheme but for Notifications, then we can better manage the notifications that users get, and provide more value to the notifications coming from JIRA.\r\n\r\nPlease vote.

This is currently very misleading when it allows you to create a description on the field itself, but once the field is created, any changes to the description need to be done in each Field Configuration.\r\n\r\nI would suggest supplying a checkbox in the Edit view for the field in the Field Configuration which will allow you to inherit the description from the parent field.  Then, when viewing the field information on the global level, have a little dropdown of sorts, like you do for Field Configurations Shared by projects, but have it list all the Field Configurations which do NOT inherit the description from the parent field.\r\n\r\nThis will make it extremely easy to manage these descriptions in the future for massive changes.\r\n\r\nExample of the massive change that we had to do:  We have a Engineering specific Help document on our SharePoint environment, and the location of the document changed.  So i had to go through and change every single instance that used that link to the new URL.  It took an extremely long time to do.",

The same occurs for exports to Word, which generates files in DOC format. These files have multiple disadvantages when compared to the new file types introduced by Microsoft in 2007 (DOCX, XLSX and PPTX). That's because those new file formats are XML-based, which allows for much better compression, resulting in considerably smaller files.\r\n\r\nAlso, Excel's new file format (XLSX) adds an extra layer of security by blocking the usage of Macros, which requires the file to be saved as XLSM. XLS files allows for any Macro to be included and is being blocked by multiple System Administrators, especially in companies with higher standards for security.\r\n\r\nh3. Example\r\nExporting around 4900 issues to Excel from JIRA currently generates a file with an approximate size of 7.5 MB. If we convert that file to XLSX once it has been opened in Excel 2007 or later, the file size drops to less than 10% of the original file's size.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\nThe [Better Excel Plugin|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.midori.jira.plugin.betterexcel], developed by Midori, adds additional features for exporting issues to Excel in JIRA, including the ability to export directly to XLSX.\r\n\r\n(i) _Please note third-party add-ons, such as \"Better Excel Plugin\", *are not* supported by Atlassian. Therefore, support and maintenance is purely responsibility of the add-on's vendor._",

Atlassian Connect 1.0 [was released in March 2014|http://blogs.atlassian.com/2014/03/introducing-atlassian-connect-1-0/], and you can already get access to [more than 50 public add-ons today built using the platform|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/search?application=&category=&cost=&hosting=cloud&marketingLabel=].\r\n \r\nDue to stability and scalability reasons, we will not bundle additional third party add-ons with our Cloud offerings. But you should feel free to contact the vendors of your favourite add-ons to let them know that you would like them to create a Cloud version of the add-on! We will do our best to work together with the vendor to satisfy this request.\r\n \r\nSince we have no plans to bundle additional add-ons in Cloud, we are closing this issue.\r\n \r\nCheers,\r\nBartek\r\nJIRA Product Management\r\nbartek (at) atlassian (dot) com\r\n{panel}\r\n \r\n \r\n*Original request description:*\r\nCustomers need the following plugin install to make their tasks easier:\r\n\r\nhttps://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.wittified.jira.project-creator\r\n\r\n",
