As an example, when the create issue handler process emails that have the \"From\" header such as below, the issue will be created using the wrong email address:\r\n{noformat}\r\nDate: Tue, 23 Dec 2014 10:33:55 +0800\r\nFrom: \"'test' via support\" <support@bitbucket.org>\r\nReply-To: test@mail.com\r\nTo: \"support\" <support@bitbucket.org>\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nTherefore as a suggestion, the create issue handler should also inspect the \"Reply-To\" header when getting the reporter email address, as the \"From\" header might contain the wrong address.",

However, if endpoint identification (see SSLParameters.getEndpointIdentificationAlgorithm) is enabled for a connection or the potentially changed certificate is for the same 'identity' as the last certificate seen then the connection is permitted. If the identity of the certificate has changed then a \"javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: server certificate change is restricted during renegotiation\" exception is raised.\r\n\r\nNote: two identities are considered equal in this case if:\r\na) There is a subject alternative name specified in both certificates which is an IP address and the IP address in both certificates is the same.\r\nb) There is a subject alternative name specified in both certificates which is a DNS name and the DNS name in both certificates is the same.\r\nc) The subject and issuer fields are present in both certificates and contain identical subject and issuer values.\r\n\r\n*Possible solution*\r\nIf you encounter a \"javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: server certificate change is restricted during renegotiation\" error try restarting JIRA.

Story)\r\n- Add a subtask to this issue and attempt to move it to issue type Bug.

Create an Issue and a Version (mark it as archived).\r\n2. Create following data.txt file:\r\n{noformat}\r\n{\r\n   \"update\" : {\r\n       \"versions\" : [{\"add\" : {\"name\" : \"NAME_OF_YOUR_VERSION\"}}]\r\n   }\r\n}\r\n{noformat}\r\n3.

Check the issue in browser, it should now have this archive version added in \"Affects Version/s\" field.\r\n\r\nOnce this archived version has been added it cannot be removed via REST (neither it can be removed in UI for that matter) i.e. changing \"add\" to \"remove\" in above {{data.txt}} file and executing the PUT again with curl does not remove the version.\r\n\r\nA workaround is to unmark this version as archived and then update the issue.\r\n",

But most of the time there are not as nice integrated as the repositories which are directly supported by Atlassian. \r\n\r\nWe think it is necessary for Atlassian to support PlasticSCM natively, since it's the best SCM system on the market, at least in our opinion. The native support would add value to all Atlassian products.\r\n\r\nEspecially Fisheye would benefit of a PlasticSCM support, since there isn't a plugin available yet.

Empty body success responses are supposed to use code 204 -- http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html\r\n* An empty body is an invalid JSON response, this not being allowed.\r\n* If it is an authentication failure, this MUST return a 401 or 403 code.\r\n* This is not a real authentication failure because we are 100% sure that the credentials are right (using basic_auth).\r\n* If the server is not able to respond due to other causes it MUST reply with a 503 code and optionally with a Retry-After header that tell the client when to retry the request.\r\n\r\nAs stated above this bug uncovers several serious HTTP standard deviations, probably caused by several broken pieces of code.\r\n\r\nIt may be useful not remark this response header and the fact that, so far, all reports were happening while using basic_auth\r\n\r\n     'x-seraph-loginreason': 'OUT, AUTHENTICATED_FAILED'\r\n\r\nAtlassian support suggested, as a temporary workaround, to use alternative authentication options. Still our tests proved that other auth ways are even more prone to fail.

Have to have at least 11 JIRA projects, so that there is a scrollbar in the Project dropdown. \r\n- Click on \"Create\" button on the top;\r\n- Click on a right expansion arrow to open a dropdown Project listbox;\r\n- BUG: Clicking on \"UP\" or \"DOWN\" arrows just collapses the dropdown box.\r\n- BUG: An attempt to drag the scroll bar collapses the dropdown box.\r\n\r\nh2. Workaround:\r\nWhen using the mouse's scroll wheel, it works.",
