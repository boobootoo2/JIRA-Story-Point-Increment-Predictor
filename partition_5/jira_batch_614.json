Summary\r\nLucene Search with unlimited PageFilter causes unnecessarily memory allocation for enterprise instances (1M+ issues).\r\n\r\nIn many places unlimited PageFilter is used in JQL queries (Agile board, plugins such as JQL Tricks). This leads to the allocation of an array which has number of documents items, where number of documents is typically greater than number of issues.\r\n\r\nFor 1M+ issues the object size usually is greater than G1HeapRegionSize/2 so it's humongous object. As part of JRASERVER-63665 there was change to optimize the Lucene search and implement Debug logging. \r\nbq. Jira prepares a search with a small limit set (1000) first and checks if _totalHits_ is bigger. If it's bigger then we do a second search and we exactly know the limit now (_totalHits_ from the previous search). I also added analytics to validate this limits and also added logs (debug level). \r\n\r\nh3.

We are authenticating users via LDAP on both production and test instances, so we do not want to create a separate internal account for user and adding them to admin group. Hence we are here landed on the requirement from Jira for the single user permission addition in \"Global Permission\". \r\n\r\nWe could only assign group as part of the \"JIRA Permissions\".

      "description": "Hi,\r\nit would be very helpful if it was possible to group screens and custom fields in the admin view. We're using a fairly small Jira instance (~60 users) and the list of screens and custom fields is already getting out of hand, which makes it hard to quickly find what you're looking for.\r\n\r\nAt the moment we're working around this issue by trying to keep to a naming convention for all administrative objects like screens, screen schemes, custom fields, field schemes, etc.\r\nThis leads to very long and complex names and also doesn't make it any easier to (bulk) change the configuration once our requirements change.\r\n\r\nPlug-Ins also often create large numbers of additional screens or fields (eg. XRay Testing Plug-In) and just add to the list.\r\n\r\nIf it were possible to group these objects and maybe have a few bulk change options available (eg. like renaming parent pages together with child pages in Confluence, where you can add certain prefixes to the page-name) it would make administrating Jira much easier and less error-prone (forgetting fields,...)\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\nBest Regards,\r\nPaul",

      "description": "h3. Problem Definition\r\n\r\nJira is being used in global companies, which have offices around the globe. Jira can be deployed only in single datacenter, which means users will have large RTT to Jira from another locations.\r\n A couple of examples of network latency:\r\n * Amsterdam (Ams) - New York (NY): 70 ms\r\n * Ams - San Francisco (SF): 150 ms\r\n * Bangalore (BGL) - Ams: 200 ms\r\n * BGL - NY: 290 ms\r\n * BGL - SF: 240ms\r\n\r\nPages can have a lot of related html resources (css, png, js), so due to large RTT total page loading time can be very high. \r\n Currently due to a lot of context specific JS resources, Jira doesn't support caching at proxy level. So that also means it's not possible to use CDN providers (like Akamai , Cloudflare, AWS CloudFront) to optimise access to application, which is typical solutions to the latency problem.\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n * Enable caching for some of static or semi-static resources: _CSS_, _PNG_, _JS_.\r\n * Provide documentation which URLs can be cached and which headers should be respected to prevent caching of user specific or sensitive data\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nThere are some examples at Community page, you may want to check if those work for you - [CDN-CloudFront-and-Atlassian-Server-apps|https://community.atlassian.com/t5/Jira-discussions/CDN-CloudFront-and-Atlassian-Server-apps/m-p/731230]\r\n\r\nh3. Resolution\r\nStarting Jira 8.3, Jira Data Center supports CDN. More details can be found at [Content Delivery Network (CDN) for Jira Data Center|https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjira/content-delivery-network-cdn-for-jira-data-center-972329251.html]\r\nAfter enabling CDN, resources under \"/s/...\" url will be server from CDN server and not from Jira directly. \r\n\r\nExample:\r\n* While loading data from https://bulldog.internal.atlassian.com/browse/PSR-383 (main Jira)\r\n* Jira will return links to to load static data from CDN - https://d2mzx5lfbkaqz9.cloudfront.net/s/.../download/contextbatch/css/_super/batch.css",

This customer is also using our app to distribute attachments across categories.\r\nAnd as it happens, this customer clones issues or moves them between projects (including attachments). And the mapping to categories should be preserved.\r\nWe have reviewed your issue cloning mechanism and it does not fire an event that all attachments were copied from the original issue. This is a problem for us.\r\nIs there any way to get an event that all attachments were cloned from the source issue and now they are available in the cloned issue. So our app can apply all the necessary mappings.\r\nAny recommendations or hints about this will be greatly appreciated.\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\nBest Regards,\r\nVadim Rutkevich\r\n\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nSupporting ticket: [https://ecosystem.atlassian.net/browse/DEVHELP-923]\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nAnne Calantog",

Summary\r\n\r\nIf a user doesn't exist and you use a rest call like {{/rest/api/2/search?jql=assignee  was admin}}, then Jira will return 400 Bad Request error rather than a warning that the user doesn't exist. \r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Create a {{TestUser}}\r\n# Create an issue, and assign it to {{TestUser}}\r\n# Assign the issue to another user, or unassign it\r\n# Delete the {{TestUser}} account\r\n# Execute the following REST call (since it's a GET, you can browse to it directly):\r\n{code}\r\n$jira-url/rest/api/2/search?jql=assignee%20was%20testuser\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nThe REST API should return a {{200 OK}} response, with the warning message that the user does not exist. This is the behaviour when the query is {{assignee = testuser}} for example.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nThe REST API returns a {{400 Bad Request}} response, with the warning message that the user does not exists.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\nPerforming a {{POST}} with the JQL as JSON data should return the results correctly. For example:\r\n{code}\r\ncurl -X \"POST\" \"http://localhost:47121/j7121/rest/api/2/search\" \\\r\n     -u 'username:password' \\\r\n     -d $'{\"jql\": \"assignee was testuser\"}'\r\n{code}\r\n \r\nh3.

A single sprint in progress on Scrum Board A turns into 3 duplicated sprints (one per project) after transfer to Jira Instance B;\r\n2. The Scrum Board A backlog order (which consisted of a carefully prioritised list of tickets from the 3 projects) loses the order on transfer. It seems issues are imported by project first, so whilst the order within a single project is right, the overall order on the backlog is totally wrong.\r\n\r\n{quote}",

      "description": "h3. Problem Definition\r\nBeginning with Jira 7.6.0 a new feature was introduced to allow for the re-arrangement of subtasks on a parent issue.  See https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-24547 and https://confluence.atlassian.com/jiracore/jira-core-7-6-x-release-notes-938027190.html#JIRACore7.6.xreleasenotes-other for details.\r\n\r\nIt is possible to disable the dragging of subtask through the use of a dark feature.  \r\n # Login to Jira as an administrator\r\n # Navigate to $JIRAbaseURL /secure/SiteDarkFeatures!default.jspa\r\n # add the value of  *com.atlassian.jira.issuetable.draggable.disabled* to the enable dark feature and click Add\r\n\r\nHowever this will prevent the dragging of these subtasks both on the issue details page and through the issue navigator. BUT in the issue details view you will still see the up and down arrows that can be used to rearrange the order of these subtasks.\r\n\r\nIt appears that when using this specific dark feature to disable that draggable feature, the system is still imposing the up / down arrows on that page.   Even though there exists another feature flag by the key of *com.atlassian.jira.issuetable.move.links.hidden* It appears that both disabling the dragging and hiding those icons can not be implemented at the same time within Jira.\r\n \r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\nUltimately, we need a way to disable this feature in Jira.  Possible solutions are to change the way the first feature flag works to completely disable the ability to change subtask order.  Alternative to that would be to create a 3rd feature flag that accomplishes the same.\r\n\r\nh3. Why this is important\r\nThe problem with this is that since previous versions of Jira never allowed for this, some administrators actually created dependencies in regards to the number of subtasks an issue has and the sequence in which they appear on that issue.   As such it is important to those Jira admins to maintain the old functionality that prevented end users from being able to change the order of these subtasks.\r\n",

Root cause\r\n\r\nIn the\u00a0development of epics in\u00a0kanplan\u00a0we have added epics count to allData.json request in Jira Agile.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe code looks as follows:\r\n{code:java}\r\nServiceOutcome<EpicData> epicDataServiceOutcome = epicsHelper.loadEpicData(user, rapidView); \r\nif (epicDataServiceOutcome.isValid()) { \r\n   workData.epicData.epicsCount = epicDataServiceOutcome.get().epics.size(); \r\n} {code}\r\nThis code is very inefficient, as creating\u00a0epicDataServiceOutcome on large datasets is very expensive operation.\u00a0\r\nh2. Workaround\r\n\r\nThere is no possible workaround for this issue.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0",

Problem Definition\r\n\r\nThe URL that is suggested for use in JIRA Data Center behind a load balancer, as mentioned in [https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/ENTERPRISE/JIRA+Data+Center+Load+Balancer+examples] states to use {{/status}} and it will return {{\"state\":\"RUNNING\"}} for a healthy node that should be in the pool. It is assumed in the documentation that customers have access to their load balancer to add/remove nodes from a pool. In cases where they do not have trivial access, the process for performing maintenance on 1 to n-1 nodes in a Data Center cluster can be expensive, both in terms of time and staff cost.\r\n\r\nA suggested workaround has been to use a reverse proxy in front of each node such that the application team could drain connections by using a graceful shutdown of the proxy. This solution is\u00a0_reasonable_ but not always\u00a0_feasible_, especially in cases when, for example, the use of Apache or other web servers is not permitted within the governance framework of a customer.\r\nh2. Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nAdd functionality to the cluster node section of the System info page (or even better, provide a cluster management interface!) to allow administrators to set a node to maintenance mode, effectively taking it out of the pool and draining connections, similar to how a foreground reindex behaves, but without the reindex. This will allow customers to perform tasks such as instance stop/start, thread/heap dumps, support investigations with a live instance, etc.",

In a perfect world, you realize that you need to split an issue into more issues during planning, but I find that often happens while it is in the active sprint.\r\n\r\nAnother recent update added the create linked issue to the native actions of Jira service desk. We use a board with some custom filters (our customer request types) for managing our service desk. If that create linked issue button was in the context menu when right clicking an issue in a sprint it would help our workflows greatly.\r\n\r\nIn short, on every board screen (backlog and active sprints mainly) the context menu when right clicking a sprint should contain the split issue and create linked issue buttons (ideally they would also both be in the issues more actions button as well) for each Jira application project type (core, software, or service desk) to make it easier to use them whenever they're needed.\r\n\r\nFor example I'm usually looking at the active sprint screen all day long. When I'm working on an issue and run into a bug, I want to be able to right click and make a linked issue so I can add my bug separately in a quick linked fashion. I don't want to hit create and have to remember the key of the issue I'm working on and all the other details. And sometimes I'm working on an issue and realize that the scope of it should really be split up to be managed better, I don't want to have to go over to the backlog, filter through the versions and epics to what I'm working on, and then split the issue. I want to just right click where I'm working and split the issue and create and place the new ones accordingly.\r\n\r\nI love that these buttons exist at all, they were a great addition! I would just appreciate it if they were accessible in more places.",
