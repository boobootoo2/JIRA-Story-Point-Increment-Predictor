      "description": "When the issue clause was being implemented, a decision was made to allow relational clauses on issue keys only, and not for issue ids.\r\n\r\nI have discovered an edge case which highlights the need for relational clauses with issue ids. If you have a clause which is like so: {{issue < \"HSP-1\"}}, and you save this in a filter and share it with users who cannot see the HSP project, when they run the filter they will see this JQL query: {{issue < 10010}} (where {{10010}} is the issue id of {{HSP-1}}). This is due to sanitisation of issue clauses.\r\n\r\nThis will return no results as expected since they cannot see the project. However, if they go to edit the query, they will be presented with these error messages:\r\n{quote}Issue '10011' could not be found for field 'issue'.\r\nThe field 'issue' does not support the relational operator '<' for issue IDs.{quote}\r\n\r\nThe first is valid, but the second I think would be confusing for the user.\r\n\r\nSo, we should allow relational searching on issue ids too. My suggestion to keep the results consistent is to lookup the issue key of the issue with the id, and then generate the same query as if the key were used.",

We never made a update (neither mylyn nor jira). So where does this change come from??\r\n\r\nOur solution:\r\nWe downloaded http://download.eclipse.org/tools/mylyn/update/extras/plugins/org.eclipse.mylyn.jira.core_3.1.1.v20090411-0400-e3x.jar.\r\nRenamed it with the name of the current plugin in our installation and then replaced the current installation's plugin.\r\nWe are lucky that it is binary compatible :D\r\n\r\nI know a bad workaround, but software development seems to be working around instead of targeting the real goals. ;)",

Don't break backwards compatibility and leave RemoteIssue as is.  If a client wants to get the resolution date they'll have to make a separate SOAP call (which sucks from a performance point of view)\r\n2. Introduce a v3 of the SOAP interface which will basically be a copy of v2 but will also have things like the resolution date added.  Clients can choose to use the old v2 interface for backwards compatibility or upgrade to the new interface.  This sucks from a maintenance point of view for us though since a lot of code will be duplicated in the RPC plugin\r\n3. We go with what we have now, basically breaking backwards compatibility and forcing all our clients to re-generate their SOAP client stubs.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso we'll have to add this field to Jelly as well.",

The logic for the whole thing is:\r\n\r\n{code}\r\nif (part.content-type = \"message/rfc822\")\r\n{\r\n\tif (jira is configured to attach mail messages)\r\n\t{\r\n\t\tif (part is not a reply to the current message)\r\n\t\t{\r\n\t\t\tif (part is not empty)\r\n\t\t\t{\r\n\t\t\t\tattach it.\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t}\r\n} \r\nelse if (part.Content-Disposition = \"attachment\")\r\n{\r\n\tif (part is not empty and not S/MIME signature)\r\n\t{\r\n\t\tattach it.\r\n\t}\r\n} \r\nelse if ((part.Content-Disposition = \"inline\" AND part has filename in disposition) OR (part has content id and part is base64 encoded))\r\n{\r\n\tif (part is not empty and not S/MIME signature)\r\n\t{\r\n\t\tattach it.\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\nelse if (part.content-type = \"text/plain\")\r\n{\r\n\tif (part is not empty and part.Content-Disposition = \"attachment\")\r\n\t{\r\n\t\tattach it\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\nelse if (part.content-type = \"text/html\")\r\n{\r\n\tif (part is not empty and part.Content-Disposition = \"attachment\")\r\n\t{\r\n\t\tattach it\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\nelse if (part.content-type = \"multipart/related\")\r\n{\r\n\tif (not empty)\r\n\t{\r\n\t\tattach it.\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nThis logic is broken and quite strange. For example, the last condition can never be met since this logic is never called for multipart sections of a message. I also can't see how the \"text/plain\" or \"text/html\" conditions are relevant since they never attach parts where part.Content-Disposition != \"attachment\". \r\n\r\nThunderbird seems to see the file as an attachment. Maybe what we need to do is work out what it is doing internally, and then copy the logic?\r\n",

Features to note here are, JIRA admin screens are grouped and spread across different tabs, and the correct menu section and menu item for the current page are highlighted.  This makes working with JIRA administration so much easier, because you can easily keep track of where you are in JIRA's convoluted menu structure.  But JIRA doesn't provide a mechanism for the administration decorator to know _which_ menu item should be highlighted, so, the question is, how do we do it?\r\n\r\n{panel:bgColor=#F7D6C1}\r\nWARNING:\\\\\r\nPlease do *not* read the following code less than one hour after consuming food, if you are feeling nausea or have high blood pressure.\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\n[https://studio.atlassian.com/source/browse/JST/trunk/studio-theme/studio-theme-jira-plugin/src/main/java/com/atlassian/studio/jira/globaladmin/JiraGlobalAdminPathMapperInitialiser.java?r=31512]\r\n\r\nThat's right, a hodge podge of path fragments, regular expressions, and checking request attributes that attempts (sometimes unsuccessfully) to map the current page to web items/sections.\r\n\r\nWhat would be really nice is if JIRA could provide a mechanism to do this, for example, by setting a request attribute that says which web item should currently be highlighted.  Obviously, the highlighting in JIRA can't be implemented at once, as third party plugins provide admin items too.  But, it would mean that we could cut out so much of the crap from the above file and just leave regular expression matching to the odd case where a screen hasn't explicitly set the web item thats meant to be highlighted.",
