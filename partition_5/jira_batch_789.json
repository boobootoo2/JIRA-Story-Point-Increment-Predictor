This appears to be a bug, unless I'm not understanding how to make this work properly.\r\n\r\nNote that I can work around this by retrieving the issue key in my query result and then using jira.issue(key, expand='renderedFields').

The problem that I see is, that everybody can create his own label. In this case you have really fast really much labels. Okay, my suggestions is, to combine the \"label-field\" with \"multi-list-field\". \r\nThe result is a own labels field, in that we can configure the possible labels. And just the administration can configure a set of possible labels. I think this makes sense, because labels are only powerfull if you know the keywords. But if everybody is allowed to create own key words, you will really fast lose the overview.\r\n\r\nSo it would be great if we have in the future all three custom-fields:\r\nLabels, Multi-List and Multi-Label (or what ever :-))\r\n",
