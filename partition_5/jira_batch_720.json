[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-39797].\n  {panel}\n\nThis jira describes two defects, and one usability improvement:\r\n\r\nDEFECT 1:\r\nWhen assigning a jira by the name of the assignee, you usually start typing the name of the assignee, and then select the assignee from the filtered list.\r\n\r\nWhen a user needs to re-assign a huge number of jiras to the same person, it is cumbersome to type the name over and over. Its easier to use the filtered list the first time, then copy the full name as provided in the list, and paste it into the assignee field for all other jiras you want to assign to that same person.\r\n\r\nThe issue is that when you paste that full name into an assignee field, you are forced to re-select that person from the auto-complete field (which results in the same name being set anyway). If you remove focus from the assignee field after pasting in the full name, and without selecting the user from the filtered list, then the assignment fails with: \"User '??????' does not exist.\" - even through it is the exact name of that user.\r\n\r\nThis happens in both the Assign Dialog, and the Assignee editable field (under people) on the jira page, however the error in the Assign dialog doesn't appear until you click the Assign button on the dialog.\r\n\r\nExact steps:\r\nLocate any editable existing jira, which is currently assigned to a user (lets say \"Bob Smith\").\r\nEdit the assignee field, and copy the exact full name (Bob Smith).\r\nDelete the text in the assignee field.\r\nPaste in the copied text (Bob Smith).\r\nThe filter will come up with the match for Bob Smith. Don't select this - just click outside of the text field (shift focus) to confirm your edit of Bob Smith.\r\nRed error message is displayed underneath saying \"User 'Bob Smith' does not exist.\"\r\n\r\nI'm guessing that the actual assignee being set in the background is not the name of the user, but his email address or user Id, and to prevent accidental incorrect assignment in the case of two users having the exact same full name... however even in large organisations that is not a very likely occurrence. For usability sake, if the user makes an edit to the assignee field and the field loses focus, you could do and ajax check for an exact, distinct match on the supplied name, and if so - assign that user Id/email transparently in the background, otherwise (if no match or non-distinct match) display the usual error.\r\nOnce you remove focus from the field, there is an ajax request and a busy-spinner is displayed while waiting - in that request you could supply the entered text, and look for a distinct match on name...\r\n\r\nDEFECT 2:\r\nIn the error scenario above, if you have pasted in the exact full name, shifted focus, and received the error message \"User 'Bob Smith' does not exist.\", and you attempt to fix it by opening the dropdown box on the assignee field (which is visible while the field is in edit mode) to reselect the user from the list; then the list opens, but filtering fails, and displays \"No Matches\", even though you have the exact full name of that user in the text edit field.\r\nYou are forced to once again delete the name form the field, and type it in again.\r\n\r\nThis happens in both the Assign Dialog, and the Assignee editable field (under people) on the jira page, however the error in the Assign dialog the \"No Matched\" on dropdown-click doesn't appear until after you've tried to click the Assign button on the dialog, and received the error message.\r\n\r\nUSABILITY:\r\nWhile assigning jiras and typing in the assignee name, the list of filtered users with a partial match of the entered text is displayed, however this filtered list is very slow (we use an Atlassian hosted Jira). Surely you could keep a list of most used users in a cookie / local storage in the browser, and use that as fast filtering then assigning?\r\n\r\nAlso, if you don't use the filtered list, but just click the dropdown, a list of \"Suggestions\" are displayed. This list is not populated very well. The users I assign jiras to most ofter are not in this list... instead its got names in of users I've not interacted with for a very long time, or very infrequently. This list of suggested users should be populated by users you most frequently interact with. Possibly filtered by Jira project.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is noted on our Atlassian hosted Jira: Atlassian JIRA (v6.1.7#6163-sha1:94d557d), but might affect newer versions also.",

Summary\r\n\r\nWhen JIRA attempts to locate a user, it's possible that a [UserNotFoundException|https://developer.atlassian.com/static/javadoc/embedded-crowd-api/latest/reference/com/atlassian/crowd/exception/UserNotFoundException.html] may be thrown if the user does not exist. This can happen when:\r\n\r\n* There are multiple user directories.\r\n* The user exists in a directory lower down the list.\r\n* When JIRA attempts to locate the user, it will throw that exception for the directories the user does not exist in.\r\n\r\nThe behaviour of this before it was fixed was:\r\n\r\n* A user goes to perform an operation in JIRA, such as fetching the projects they can access.\r\n* JIRA verifies the groups they need to be in to establish permission checks.\r\n* And then iterates through the user directories, attempting to find the user in each directory until it can.\r\n* It will throw a {{UserNotFoundException}} if that user is not found and the loop through the user directories continues.\r\n* This will occur on every action that attempts to find users, so a significant amount of the exceptions can be thrown.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n# Add multiple user directories.\r\n# Place users in the bottom directory, that do not exist in the upper directories.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nJIRA operates without any problems.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nThe {{UserNotFoundException}} is thrown a significant amount of times, resulting in performance problems.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nAlter the directory order so the users directories with the vast majority of users come higher in the list, in the order of the largest to smallest. This won't necessary fix the problem, rather reduce the overall impact of it as the user directory with the smaller amount of users will still need to be accessed.\r\n\r\nHaving more directories will increase the performance impact of this issue.\r\n\r\nh3. Notes\r\n\r\nCrowd's {{UserNotFoundException}} is causing performance degradation in hi load of requests and profiling the application.\r\n\r\nWe should override the {{fillInStackTrace()}} method that calculates the stacktrace and just return it like this:\r\n\r\n{code}\r\n\r\n@Override\r\n    public synchronized Throwable fillInStackTrace()\r\n    {\r\n        return this;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nWe should also apply this to {{GroupNotFoundException}}",

In this case the only people who should see this issue would be myself(Reporter), the HR assistant (Current Assignee) and my boss (Watcher).

This is breaking Connect dialog functionality as it relies on the css class ap-dialog being present on the link.\r\n\r\nThe connect issue is https://ecosystem.atlassian.net/browse/AC-1069\r\n\r\nI reproduced this running locally with 6.4-OD-03-010.

      "description": "h3. Summary\r\n\r\nA bug in JIRA, exposed by a certain version of the JIRA Toolkit plugin, will cause JIRA to leak database connections from the Database Connection Pool (DBCP) whilst indexing. This will result in an exhaustion of available connections in the DBCP and JIRA will not function as expected. It's the same behaviour as described in our [JIRA Stops Functioning due to Timeout waiting for idle object|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRAKB/JIRA+Stops+Functioning+due+to+Timeout+waiting+for+idle+object] KB article.\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n# Install JIRA toolkit 0.35.10 or higher.\r\n# Create a \"Last public comment date\" custom field.\r\n# Go to issue search and include this field as a column on the search.\r\n# Run a search returning 50 or so issues (more than configured max connections in {{dbconfig.xml}}).\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nJIRA indexes as per normal without any failures.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nThe number of active connections in DBCP spikes and they are not released back into the connection pool. As a result of this the following exceptions will be thrown, affecting JIRA's functionality:\r\n\r\n{noformat}\r\njava.lang.RuntimeException: Unable to obtain a connection from the underlying connection pool\r\n    at org.ofbiz.core.entity.jdbc.interceptors.connection.ConnectionTracker.trackConnection(ConnectionTracker.java:59)\r\n    at org.ofbiz.core.entity.transaction.DBCPConnectionFactory.trackConnection(DBCPConnectionFactory.java:242)\r\n    at org.ofbiz.core.entity.transaction.DBCPConnectionFactory.getConnection(DBCPConnectionFactory.java:73)\r\n    at org.ofbiz.core.entity.ConnectionFactory.tryGenericConnectionSources(ConnectionFactory.java:69)\r\n    at org.ofbiz.core.entity.transaction.JNDIFactory.getConnection(JNDIFactory.java:146)\r\n    at org.ofbiz.core.entity.TransactionFactory.getConnection(TransactionFactory.java:101)\r\n    at org.ofbiz.core.entity.ConnectionFactory.getConnection(ConnectionFactory.java:59)\r\n    at org.ofbiz.core.entity.jdbc.SQLProcessor.getConnection(SQLProcessor.java:367)\r\n    at org.ofbiz.core.entity.GenericDAO.select(GenericDAO.java:584)\r\n    at org.ofbiz.core.entity.GenericHelperDAO.findByPrimaryKey(GenericHelperDAO.java:97)\r\n    at org.ofbiz.core.entity.GenericDelegator.findByPrimaryKey(GenericDelegator.java:609)\r\n    at org.ofbiz.core.entity.GenericDelegator.findByPrimaryKey(GenericDelegator.java:647)\r\n    ...\r\nCaused by: org.apache.commons.dbcp.SQLNestedException: Cannot get a connection, pool error Timeout waiting for idle object\r\n    at org.apache.commons.dbcp.PoolingDataSource.getConnection(PoolingDataSource.java:114)\r\n    at org.apache.commons.dbcp.BasicDataSource.getConnection(BasicDataSource.java:1044)\r\n    at org.ofbiz.core.entity.transaction.DBCPConnectionFactory$1.call(DBCPConnectionFactory.java:246)\r\n    at org.ofbiz.core.entity.transaction.DBCPConnectionFactory$1.call(DBCPConnectionFactory.java:243)\r\n    at org.ofbiz.core.entity.jdbc.interceptors.connection.ConnectionTracker.trackConnection(ConnectionTracker.java:53)\r\n    ... 236 more\r\nCaused by: java.util.NoSuchElementException: Timeout waiting for idle object\r\n    at org.apache.commons.pool.impl.GenericObjectPool.borrowObject(GenericObjectPool.java:1134)\r\n    at org.apache.commons.dbcp.AbandonedObjectPool.borrowObject(AbandonedObjectPool.java:79)\r\n    at org.apache.commons.dbcp.PoolingDataSource.getConnection(PoolingDataSource.java:106)\r\n    ... 240 more\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nDowngrade JIRA Toolkit plugin to version 0.35.9 (compatible with JIRA Server 6.2 - 6.3.15) or disable the plugin.\r\n\r\nTo disable:\r\n# Browse to the Add-on Manager.\r\n# Search for the JIRA Toolkit plugin and click on the disable button.\r\n# Reindex JIRA.\r\n\r\nTo downgrade:\r\n# Browse to the Add-on Manager.\r\n# Uninstall the current version.\r\n# Download 0.35.9 from the [Atlassian Marketplace|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/download/plugins/com.atlassian.jira.toolkit/version/184].\r\n# Manually upload the JAR as per [Installing add-ons|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/UPM/Installing+add-ons#Installingadd-ons-Installingbyfileupload].\r\n# Reindex JIRA.",
