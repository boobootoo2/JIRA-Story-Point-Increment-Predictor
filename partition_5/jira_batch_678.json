Suggested Solution\r\nAllow users to see tabs when using a Custom configuration for fields (e.g. either making them visible by default or providing a checkbox to make tabs visible).\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround \r\nIt is possible to configure field visibility for selected users using third party plugins such as the Behaviours functionality from [ScriptRunner for JIRA|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.onresolve.jira.groovy.groovyrunner].

Problem Definition\r\n\tAs an admin I would like our users could reset the Filter Results gadget to its default filter ordering when the page is reloaded. Once we create this gadget and a user clicks to any column to sort, the default sort definded in the filter is gone and never comes back (since the user last columns sorting is saved).\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n\tOptions to solve this problem:\r\n\t* A refresh of the gadgets page could reset the results in this gadget\r\n\t* A reset filter order option could be added to the gadget\r\n\t* The filter could have an option to block columns sorting\r\n \r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\tThe main field (used as the first field in the order by statement) used to order the filter results should always be presented as a column in the gadget. Once the user sorts the column with the correct field, the results will be sorted as defined in the filter.",

Only if you use the \"edit\" window you can reduce the flood. This is not good for anybody.\r\n\r\nSuggestion:\r\n1. Provide an option for \"digest emails\" which is ON by default, as opposed to direct.\r\n2. Provide a few values for the delay: 1 and 10 minutes, and 1, 3, 6 and 12 hours.\r\n\r\nThe digest should be the \"diff\" between time 0 and 0+delay. Meaning: I change a bug assignee from Joe to myself, set it to In-Progress, and set back Joe as assignee ... the diff is from previous state to In-progress. It is not interesting to see the 3-step dance to be able to do that state change.\r\n\r\nThe digest should be per bug, not containing several bugs. If that is interesting it is another enhancement request, outside of the scope for this one.\r\n\r\nThe digest should probably not cover more than one user. Hence I guess the longer delays could be ignore and you only go for 1 and 10 minutes. Or even just 5 minutes.\r\n\r\nThe overall idea is to minimize the email flood for when updating one small things which must be done in several steps (such as when a non-assignee want to set a bug in-progress), or when updating a few small things, such as state, assignee, add-CC and maybe a comment, whereof all are logically just one batch.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance\r\nSimon\r\n",

Also, inspection of our database reveals that the assignee and reporter are the same for 84% of our issues, i.e. 84% of the time it is better to automatically assign to the reporter than require them to manually assign to themselves. Clearly, the process that will best suit us is to have the reporter as the default assignee and allow users to assign to someone else if need be (which will be the minority of the time).\r\n\r\nCurrent workarounds:\r\n\r\n1) There is an \"assign to me\" button which is obviously pretty quick to press. However, the fact that the apparent solution also seems very straightforward means that this is something people find very frustrating. Additionally, it is open to people forgetting (we trust our team members but also accept that they make mistakes).\r\n\r\n2) A post function can be added to always assign to the current user. This is not great because it bulldozes over any actual selection the user makes (which will be very irritating 16% of the time for us) and is also not very visible/intuitive even when you do want it to happen (you have to leave the assignee field blank knowing that it is about to be assigned).\r\n\r\nProposal:\r\n\r\nAdd the option to make the reporter/current user the default assignee in a project.\r\n\r\nJustification:\r\n\r\nThis is a completely null change to anyone not making use of it, the only people who would even notice it would be project admins/leads, who would only be exposed to an extra option in a drop down if they decided to configure the default assignee (which they would probably only be doing if they want this feature!). Whereas people like myself will benefit 84% of the time that we are creating a JIRA issue.",

Valid permission types are defined in permission-types.xml\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nJRASERVER-67652 is about a similar, valid bug when using the right key, and there is a Workaround.

Summary\r\nAfter adding the {{jira.permission.create.clone}} workflow property to a Status in JIRA, it's no longer possible to create issues in the related project via REST API. \r\n\r\nh3. Environment\r\n* Using POSTMAN to test\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Edit a project's workflow\r\n# Add the following to the status just after the issue is created (eg. if a newly created issue goes to To Do status, add this property in To Do)\r\n#* jira.permission.create.clone=denied\r\n# Publish the workflow\r\n# Try creating an issue in this project which uses this workflow via REST API\r\n\r\nh3.

Current Behavior\r\n\r\nWhen a JIRA import failed, the import is stuck with a blank page with the url {{https://<domain>.atlassian.net/secure/admin/StudioImport!finished.jspa}}\r\n\r\nThe logs are spammed with the following error if the import fails before importing the AO tables: \r\n{code}\r\n2015-10-26 14:57:34.947872500 com.mysema.query.QueryException: Caught PSQLException for select \"AO_54307E_SERVICEDESK\".\"ID\", \"AO_54307E_SERVICEDESK\".\"PROJECT_ID\", \"AO_54307E_SERVICEDESK\".\"DISABLED\", \"AO_54307E_SERVICEDESK\".\"PUBLIC_SIGNUP\", \"AO_54307E_SERVICEDESK\".\"OPEN_CUSTOMER_ACCESS\", \"AO_54307E_SERVICEDESK\".\"CREATED_BY_USER_KEY\", \"AO_54307E_SERVICEDESK\".\"CREATED_DATE\", \"AO_54307E_SERVICEDESK\".\"CREATED_WITH_EMPTY_PROJECT\", \"AO_54307E_SERVICEDESK\".\"VERSION_CREATED_AT\", \"AO_54307E_SERVICEDESK\".\"LEGACY_TRANSITION_DISABLED\" from \"AO_54307E_SERVICEDESK\" \"AO_54307E_SERVICEDESK\" order by \"AO_54307E_SERVICEDESK\".\"CREATED_DATE\" \r\n{code}\r\n\r\nThis has causes confusion for the support team to troubleshoot and potentially spent more hours than they should.\r\n\r\nh3. Feature Request\r\nThe import error should be handled better. There should be an error message in the UI to indicate any unfulfilled requirement instead of giving a blank screen.\r\n\r\nThe un-relevant error message should not be appearing.",
