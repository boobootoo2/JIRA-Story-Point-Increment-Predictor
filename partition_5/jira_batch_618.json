Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Create custom field with multiple choices (eg. custom field named Browsers, can have internet browser as options - IE, Edge, Firefox, Chrome etc.)\r\n # Create a simple filter like \"project =\u00a0TEST and issuetype = Bug\"\r\n # Add Two dimensional filter statistics gadget to your dashboard specifying the filter from Step 1\r\n # Set XAxis = Issue Type\r\n # Set YAxis =\u00a0some multi-select-list custom fields,  eg. Browser(s) field that has Internet browsers as options; Sort By, Sort Direction, Number of Results and Auto refresh settings - seems it does not matter what you put there\r\n # Save the filter.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nNewly created gadget should show complete breakdown, including number that counts issues having None as a YAxis custom field's value (screenshot attached).\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nNewly created gadget doesn't include issues having None as a YAxis custom field's value. There is no row which displays None as a field value followed by issue count (screenshot attached).\r\n\r\nh3. Notes\r\nThe bug doesn't exist in versions 7.1.9 (tested by customer) and 7.3.8 (tested by Atlassian Support).\r\nIt exists in both 7.5.0 and 7.5.1 versions.\r\n\r\nh3.Workaround\r\nNo",

This only works with IMAP mail boxes.\r\n* Add a new Mail Server (every one of them can point to the same physical mailbox) in Jira for each of your Mail Handlers then associate every one of your Mail Handler with a dedicated Mail Server but you may observe symptoms of JRASERVER-65581.",

The integration with IDP works well, however it does not play well with\u00a0local system accounts, or local service accounts. As it stands, you either have to accept that your current Windows credentials session will claim your login (when set as primary auth), or you have to enter the system through the IDP site itself, leaving the option to login locally or the old fashioned way as the only option at the JIRA instance (secondary auth). The second option is not appealing, since there is no obvious indication that SAML authentication is available to a user at all, and frankly, will be rarely utilized if an additional step is needed (navigating to the IDP site to then be redirected to JIRA).\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nWhat we'd like to suggest: If secondary auth is selected, simply add a button in the login panel that gives the option to login with SAML as well. This would allow users to still login with system accounts (in our case, the main system administrator account), while still allowing\u00a0SAML functionality as an option, and\u00a0would not require users to navigate to a secondary site to do so.\u00a0",

It's not fair to miss functionalities after upgrades and be forced to pay for something that was free in oldest versions. It doesn't make any sense.\u00a0\r\n\r\nFor instance, we are using now JIRA 7.3.1 and:\r\n\r\n1.- The JIRA Suite Utilities plugin was free for previous JIRA versions (latest version that is free is v1.5.4) but this version only supports up to JIRA v7.3.8. This means that when we upgrade JIRA again, we will need to purchase a licence (so we have already requested it).\r\n\r\n2.- We have lost the Export to Excel functionality. There is a workaround so we can use it\r\n{quote}[https://community.atlassian.com/t5/Jira-Core-questions/JIRA-7-2-x-Excel-export-gone/qaq-p/231223]\r\n{quote}\r\nbut we get an error (File format does not match extension). This is because the XLS file produced by JIRA is actually a HTML file that Excel can import, but again, it was working OK in and older version and again buying a plugin [Better Excel Plugin|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.midori.jira.plugin.betterexcel/server/overview] (https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-60667) would solve the issue.\r\n\r\nThis is not the way to gain customer loyalty.

      "description": "h2. Summary\r\n\r\nIssuing a rest API call or JQL that have sub-tasks as part of their results will fail with a Null Pointer Exception if the parent of the sub-task had been deleted on a different node.\r\n\r\n\r\n Based on the stack trace written to the JIRA log files we understand that:\r\n\r\n1) A rest API call is issued on one node (lets suppose NODE_A) of the JIRA DC cluster.\r\n 2) As part of processing the results for the rest API call or JQL, a sub-task is converted into an issue.\r\n 3) To convert the sub-task, its respective parent needs to be found.\r\n 4) JIRA tries to get the parent of the subtask from cache (on NODE_A as it is the node where the rest call or JQL were issued) and does not find it.\r\n 5) JIRA then goes to get the parent of the subtask from the database and does not find it either. Instead, a NULL value is returned as the result from the SELECT statement.\r\n It is likely that the parent of the sub-task had been deleted on any other node apart from NODE_A within the JIRA DC cluster (and hence from the database) however the lucene index on that NODE_A was not yet updated.\r\n At this point is where we find the inconsistency as the value found in the Lucene index cannot be found in the database.\r\n 6) The rest API call (or JQL) fails and an exception is written to the log file.\r\n\r\n*It must be stressed that the Lucene index is eventually consistent, which means that there will be some delay in updating the index across all nodes.*\r\nh2. Environment\r\n * JIRA Data Center with more than one node.\r\n * JIRA single node (it is less likely to happen but still can happen)\r\n\r\nh2. Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nThere no specific steps to reproduce this problem. The only way to reproduce it would be in a controlled environment and setting breakpoints in the JIRA code.\r\nh2. Expected Results\r\n\r\nJIRA should handle this in a different way, detecting that a NULL value was returned from the SELECT statement and deducting (as the database is our source) that due to eventual consistency the lucene index had not been updated yet. Then, handling the inconsistency rather than throwing a NULL pointer exception.\r\nh2. Actual Results\r\n\r\nThe rest API call fails and the below exception is thrown in the JIRA log files file.\r\n\r\n(!) Please note that the below exception shows a rest API causing it as this was how it was reported however this can be caused by a JQL as well and hence the stack trace might be different. The key for this issue is the stack trace reported below \"Caused by:\".\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n{code:java}\r\n2017-08-03 01:57:46,291 ajp-nio-127.0.0.1-8009-exec-3549 ERROR srvCatalyst 117x12153229x1 1y091dw 10.147.129.135 /rest/api/2/search [c.a.j.rest.exception.ExceptionInterceptor] Returning internal server error in response\r\njava.lang.reflect.InvocationTargetException\r\n\tat sun.reflect.GeneratedMethodAccessor1098.invoke(Unknown Source)\r\n\tat sun.reflect.DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.java:43)\r\n\tat java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Method.java:498)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.plugins.rest.common.interceptor.impl.DispatchProviderHelper$TypeOutInvoker$1.invoke(DispatchProviderHelper.java:169)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.plugins.rest.common.interceptor.impl.DispatchProviderHelper$1.intercept(DispatchProviderHelper.java:83)\r\n\t... 3 filtered\r\n\tat com.atlassian.jira.rest.exception.ExceptionInterceptor.intercept(ExceptionInterceptor.java:55)\r\n\t... 1 filtered\r\n\tat com.atlassian.jira.rest.v2.issue.scope.RequestScopeInterceptor.intercept(RequestScopeInterceptor.java:39)\r\n\t... 14 filtered\r\n\tat com.atlassian.plugins.rest.module.RestDelegatingServletFilter$JerseyOsgiServletContainer.doFilter(RestDelegatingServletFilter.java:154)\r\n\t... 1 filtered\r\n\tat com.atlassian.plugins.rest.module.RestDelegatingServletFilter.doFilter(RestDelegatingServletFilter.java:68)\r\n\t... 36 filtered\r\n\tat com.atlassian.web.servlet.plugin.request.RedirectInterceptingFilter.doFilter(RedirectInterceptingFilter.java:21)\r\n\t... 53 filtered\r\n\tat com.atlassian.jira.security.JiraSecurityFilter.lambda$doFilter$0(JiraSecurityFilter.java:76)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.jira.security.JiraSecurityFilter.dt_access$218(JiraSecurityFilter.java)\r\n\t... 1 filtered\r\n\tat com.atlassian.jira.security.JiraSecurityFilter.doFilter(JiraSecurityFilter.java:74)\r\n\t... 16 filtered\r\n\tat com.atlassian.plugins.rest.module.servlet.RestSeraphFilter.doFilter(RestSeraphFilter.java:37)\r\n\t... 20 filtered\r\n\tat com.atlassian.jira.servermetrics.CorrelationIdPopulatorFilter.doFilter(CorrelationIdPopulatorFilter.java:30)\r\n\t... 10 filtered\r\n\tat com.atlassian.web.servlet.plugin.request.RedirectInterceptingFilter.doFilter(RedirectInterceptingFilter.java:21)\r\n\t... 4 filtered\r\n\tat com.atlassian.web.servlet.plugin.LocationCleanerFilter.doFilter(LocationCleanerFilter.java:36)\r\n\t... 29 filtered\r\n\tat com.atlassian.jira.servermetrics.MetricsCollectorFilter.doFilter(MetricsCollectorFilter.java:25)\r\n\t... 27 filtered\r\n\tat java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.runWorker(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:1142)\r\n\tat java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor$Worker.run(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:617)\r\n\tat org.apache.tomcat.util.threads.TaskThread$WrappingRunnable.run(TaskThread.java:61)\r\n\tat java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:745)\r\nCaused by: com.google.common.cache.CacheLoader$InvalidCacheLoadException: CacheLoader returned null for key 2276745.\r\n\tat com.google.common.cache.LocalCache$Segment.getAndRecordStats(LocalCache.java:2350)\r\n\tat com.google.common.cache.LocalCache$Segment.loadSync(LocalCache.java:2320)\r\n\tat com.google.common.cache.LocalCache$Segment.lockedGetOrLoad(LocalCache.java:2282)\r\n\tat com.google.common.cache.LocalCache$Segment.get(LocalCache.java:2197)\r\n\tat com.google.common.cache.LocalCache.get(LocalCache.java:3937)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.jira.rest.v2.issue.IssueBeanBuilder2.createParentLink(IssueBeanBuilder2.java:317)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.jira.rest.v2.issue.IssueBeanBuilder2.build(IssueBeanBuilder2.java:155)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.jira.rest.v2.search.SearchResource$IssueToIssueBean.apply(SearchResource.java:291)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.jira.rest.v2.search.SearchResource$IssueToIssueBean.apply(SearchResource.java:275)\r\n\tat com.google.common.collect.Lists$TransformingRandomAccessList$1.transform(Lists.java:617)\r\n\tat com.google.common.collect.TransformedIterator.next(TransformedIterator.java:48)\r\n\tat java.util.AbstractCollection.toArray(AbstractCollection.java:141)\r\n\tat java.util.ArrayList.<init>(ArrayList.java:177)\r\n\tat com.google.common.collect.Lists.newArrayList(Lists.java:144)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.jira.rest.v2.search.SearchResource.asResultsBean(SearchResource.java:217)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.jira.rest.v2.search.SearchResource.search(SearchResource.java:179)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.jira.rest.v2.search.SearchResource.searchUsingSearchRequest(SearchResource.java:203)\r\n\t... 237 more\r\n{code}\r\n\u00a0\r\nh2.

Note on Fix\r\nIn Jira 8.12 we have change how Index replication works and added Jira Document Based Replication (DBR), this means documents are only created on the source node (where the action triggering the change happened) and the document is then distributed to all other nodes.\u00a0 Check [Document-based replication in Jira Data Center|https://confluence.atlassian.com/enterprise/document-based-replication-in-jira-data-center-1021214730.html] page for more details. \r\n\r\nAs part of the DBR change, there are other changes, which we belive *prevent or self-heal the problem mentioned in this ticket*: \r\n * we have added *versioning of all entities* - now every change which triggers an issue, comment or worklog reindex bumps this entity version (bumping the version is only triggered by user actions, not full/background re-index)\u00a0\r\n * all index updates (except full-foreground re-index) are now doing a *conditional update*: we only update the index if the entity in the index is older/equal (in therms of versioning - not time) to the new entity: this gives us a guarantee that all update conflicts will be resolved on all nodes with the same result; when doing a full re-index we have a clean index and there are no concurrent index updates so the index updates are non-conditional;\r\n * on both server and DC there is a task running every 5sec which *checks the consistency* of the recent (last 15 sec) changes in the index and re-applies deletes if there was a late update which has overridden the delete (conditional updates do not solve this problem); this task checks for the consistency of updates as well to handle corner cases like thread was gone after updating the DB (for DC this is the index replication table, for server the entity version table) but before updating the local index",

      "description": "h3. Problem Definition\r\nIn MySQL 5.7.6, a change was made to require that the database user now needs the \"REFERENCES\" permission to be able to create the foreign key constraints.   Jira, starting with 7.3.x, does offer support for MySQL 5.7.x.   We have updated the Jira documentation to reflect this change, but it would still be helpful if Jira was more proactive in regards to halting all functions when this permission is missing.   The reason this would be helpful is that users setting up jira for the first time on this database platform could easily missing this one permission needed, and as a result it would be easy for their system to get into a broken state rather quickly without it being readily apparent.\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\nIt would be great if either Jira or the healthchecks in Jira could both detect this situation and halt the system during startup if it is missing this permission.\r\n\r\nh3. Why this is important\r\nSince MySQL changed to require this starting with 5.7.6, and Jira simply doesn't work correctly without this permission, it would be better to have Jira come to a complete halt rather than continue to work in a semi-broken state.   For example, if you setup the database this way, it does appear that Jira works, but Jira Software tends to be unable to create the Rank field correctly and provide correct lexorank marker values for that rank field when the Jira-software plugin starts up.\r\n\r\n ",

Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Setup an IIS proxy with ARR plugin in JIRA following [Integrating JIRA applications with IIS using ARR|https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirakb/integrating-jira-applications-with-iis-using-arr-313467089.html]\r\n# Access JIRA with proxy and upload PDF files\r\n# Click on the PDF file\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Behaviour\r\nPDF will be correctly displayed\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Result\r\nIt loads infinitely and throws 502 Bad Gateway Error\r\n\r\nh3. Note \r\nThe PDF is correctly displayed when bypassing the proxy\r\n\r\nh3. Workarounds\r\n* By [~jconroy]:  {quote}ARR proxy has a default chunk size of 256k.  It will download, cache and rechunk the file before it gets sent to the client. ARR also uses a response buffer with a 256k threshold.  In my analysis I've found ARR is not able to detect when the last chunk has been received (best guess is pdf-viewer is using a method not supported by ARR).  When ARR receives the httpresponse close, anything left in the response buffer is dropped and causes a 502.3 error.\r\n\r\nResolution:\r\n\r\nDisabling Disk Cache on the proxy server will complete resolve the issue.  Additionally I recommend setting the response buffer threshold to 0 and setting the proxy keep-alive timeout from 30 to 180 seconds.  Although not required to fix this issue, the response buffer is know to cause issues with real-time bidirectional techniques such as SignalR, and the 30 second keep-alive can cause too frequent disconnects with other applications.{quote}\r\n* Increasing the keep-alive time seems to help in some cases.",

Issue description\r\n\r\nWhen using a custom template, the Issue collector template preview is blank in the issue collector view page, although it is not blank in the edit page.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to reproduce\r\n # In any project, go to Project Settings -> Issue Collector\r\n # Click on add an issue collector.\r\n # From the \"Edit issue collector\" page, select \"Custom\" for the Template (note that it is not needed to tick any Custom Fields to reproduce this bug)\r\n # Notice that the template preview is working on this page.\r\n # Click on \"Update\" to save the issue collector\r\n # Go back to the Project Settings -> Issue Collector page\r\n # Click on the name of the Issue Collector under the column \"Name\"\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Result\r\n\r\nThe template preview should not be blank, like it's the case on the \"Edit issue collector\" page \r\n\r\nh3.
