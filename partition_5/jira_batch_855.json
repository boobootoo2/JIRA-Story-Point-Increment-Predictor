No actions besides hovering/clicking the original arrow target will cause it to hide again. (See attachment LayerMenu_is_broken.png.)\n\nExpected result:\n\nEither the layer manager should remember that the navigation menu dropdown is open and subsequent clicks on the document (after dragging the gadget) should close the menu, or initiating a drag gadget action should automatically close the menu.\n\nTo reproduce *Bug #2*:\n\n# Go to the dashboard.\n# Click a cog inside a gadget to drop a cog menu dropdown.\n# Without closing the dropdown, drag the containing gadget.\n\n\nResult:\n\nThe dropdown remains in its original position.

Relative paths will be based at Tomcat working directory. Absolute paths will be honored. If file is found then restore otherwise continue to next step.\n# Locate the file using {{$JIRA.HOME/import}} as the base. For this check we strip the path from the file and just look for {{$JIRA.HOME/import/$FILE}}.\n\nThis can cause confusion if the user is trying to restore a file located using 1, but they actually restore a file using 2. For example:\n\n# Adam has a file called {{$JIRA.HOME/import/backup.xml}}.\n# Adam tires to restore {{c:\\tmp\\backup.xml}} when he actually meant {{c:\\temp\\backup.xml}}.\n# [BUG] JIRA rather than returning in error restores  {{$JIRA.HOME/import/backup.xml}} without any indication this what it decided to do.\n\nAs a user I find this very strange behavior. I would expect an error or at the very least a confirmation before trying to restore {{$JIRA.HOME/import/backup.xml}} as it is not the file that I typed in. We may even want to consider skipping the {{$JIRA.HOME/import}} lookup altogether if the user types in a file with any path. Finally, it may also be useful to indicate which file JIRA was restored from both in the server log and on the import result screen. \n\n",

This highlights that we should probably log this at DEBUG level as it only pollutes the logs with messages that are caused from invalid or incorrect user [or bot in this case] input.\n\nAdditionally, it seems to be that we are not doing any client or server side validation of the lenght of this string. According to a conversation I had with Chris M about this the max lenght of a jql query is 3000 characters and the sample string above is 4187 characters long.\n\nWe should have both client and server side validation of this. I guess this will have to be investigated to confirm all of this.\n\nIt seems like the both changes, specially the logging one should be a simple fix with low-risk, so I guess it could fit into the 4.2 timeframe, but let's see what the triage team say about this.",
