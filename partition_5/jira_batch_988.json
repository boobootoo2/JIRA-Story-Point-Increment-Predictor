      "description": "I'm trying to set up a CVS connection in 3.0.2. We use SSH (:ext:) with our repository. \n\nI have given the 'jira' user appropriate keys. I can ssh to the CVS server. I can check out the repository on the command line, eg.:\n\tlogin jira\n\tcvs -d \":ext:jira@tonatiuh:/home/cvsroot\" checkout Harmony\nAnd it works just fine. The repository checks out flawlessly.\n\nTrying to use JIRA's admin console to configure CVS I have made the following settings:\nName: Harmony\nCVS Root: :ext:jira@tonatiuh:/home/cvsroot\nModule name: Harmony\nLog retrieval: Automatic\nLog file path: /usr/local/jira/temp/cvs-module1.log\n\nThis results in the error \"Error authenticating with the repository. Could not open ssh connection. Please see underlying message.\"\n\nThere are no status messages on the CVS server. It doesn't look like a connection attempt was ever made. This seems quite an important detail. Normally, the server should emit some kind of log message if a connection attempt was initiated.\n\nAs an alternative to making this work, is it possible to have a cron job gather information from CVS and make it available to JIRA? This is a major problem for us. We've been trying to get CVS integration to work ever since 2.6.0 was shipped. I'm sorely disappointed that we are still having so much trouble.\n\nIf I look in the logs, this is what I see:\n\n==> catalina.out <==\n2004-10-22 13:53:19,170 ERROR [action.admin.vcs.UpdateRepository] Error authenticating with the repository: Could not open ssh connection.

However, my users are stupid and will more than likely select 'edit issue' and only add a comment.\n\nNote: If a single field is modified in addition to adding an issue comment then the event.getComment() returns the new comment.\n\nI've written my listener to log messages for every event call - the only event which is called after the issue is modified is 'issueUpdated'. issueCommented is not called unless the user selects 'add comment' under operations.\n\nI can work around this by modifying the jsp file for edit issue and removing the lines which display the comment box.

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-5012].\n  {panel}\n\nRaised for Kyle Lucas (JSP-265):\n\n\"It is kind of ugly to have to do a filter every time I want to look for\na value in custom field. So for example if I want to find my custom\nfield called companyname(my custom field). I have to create a filter\nfor companyname equal to the value I want and run it- every time. Is\nthere a way to just type in the custom field somewhere and have it\nhappen? Like in quick search. Or even better yet. A way to specifiy\nthat I want a filter and it asks me for the data that it does not know.\n\n\nEven better is that I can have dynamic data like. If the date is today\n- 14 and the status = OPEN and the \"custom field=X:prompt\" the user\ntypes in the value and gets it.\n\nKyle \"\n\nEssentially I think what's wanted here is an Access/Rational ClearQuest styled saved search that prompts for values of certain specified fields when you run them",

We highly value your feedback in all forms, and through suggestions in jira.atlassian.com is not different. We use this channel often to learn the best we can with how customers use JIRA and how we can continue to improve the experience for as many users as possible.\r\n\r\nWe have revisited this issue again recently and wanted to reiterate that there are still currently no plans to implement this suggestion, and it is not currently on any JIRA team\u2019s roadmap at this stage.\r\n\r\nPlease remember that jira.atlassian.com is one of many inputs for the JIRA roadmap. You can [learn more about our process here|https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/110373/how-does-the-jira-team-use-jira-atlassian-com].\r\n\r\nI understand that our decision may be disappointing. Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.\r\n\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nKerrod Williams\r\nKerrod (dot) Williams (at) atlassian (dot) com\r\nProduct Manager, JIRA\r\n\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\nUsers may choose to watch individual issues. Some users however would like to receive notifications whenever anything is added or modified within a specific project. In order to set this up, currently, a new group and notification scheme needs to be created for each project, and users must be added by an administrator.
