Here are some suggestions for improvements, which are supported by DirecTV:\r\n\r\n1. It's annoying that sub-tasks can't have sub-tasks.  Sub-tasks of sub-tasks should be allowed.  Further, there should be a list in tasks (and sub-tasks) showing what sub-tasks they have.\r\n\r\n2. When email goes to jirahddvr@directv.com, with a recognizable ticket in the subject, JIRA forwards the email to the assignee for the ticket.  Helpfully, it checks to see if the assignee is the same as the sender of the email, and in that case, it does not forward the email.  It should also check the Cc: list of the email to see if the assignee is on the list, and in that case it should also not forward the email.\r\n\r\n3. JIRA believes that two issues can be linked as \"is related to\", \"is related by\", \"duplicates\", or \"is duplicated by\".  There is no semantic difference between \"is related to\" and \"is related by\" because \"is related to\" is a symmetric relation (and so is \"duplicates\").  JIRA should get rid of \"is related by\" and \"is duplicated by\".                                       -- George\r\n",

Here the issue object *has* a parentId set (because it was probably explicitly set by the webwork action or issue service)\r\n* It then triggers an update of this issue by adding a label. At some stage during this process we must lookup the issue again by ID and then dispatch the issue updated event.  Now we haven't run the doPostCreationTask() method yet which establishes the parent/child link in the DB.  The IssueImpl looks up the parentId via this parent/child link however and so now that we've looked up the issue via DB but we don't have the link yet the parentId comes back as null.   \r\n* Finally the doPostCreationTask() method runs in CreateSubTaskIssueDetails which establishes the parent/child issue link.  *now* if we retrieved the issue again from the db it would have a parent ID set but at this stage it's too late.\r\n\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nWe will need this to be fixed, as GreenHopper (amongst others) definitely makes use of listeners to synchronise Version and Component hierarchy, and this prevents 3rd party developers from using this feature in combination with the own listeners that want to work with subtasks and their parents.\r\n\r\nHaving said that though, it's not urgent as the workaround would be to not run two separate listeners like this (not run a hierarchy in GH, and disable those listeners).",

Unfortunately we don't seem to have any documentation on it and it's a bit confusing about what the functionality does and does not do.\r\n\r\nSo far, based from the case I worked on and JRA-24213 it seems to be able to:\r\n* Migrate *all users* from JIRA Internal to Delegated LDAP.\r\n* Migrate *all users* from Delegated LDAP to JIRA Internal.\r\n* Migrate *all users* from Delegated LDAP to Delegated LDAP.\r\n\r\nIt does not support (requested in JRA-27868):\r\n\r\n* Migrating a specific set of users from one directory to another.\r\n* \"Connector\" User Directories - so direct to the LDAP Server (e.g.: Active Directory).\r\n* Migrating groups only.\r\n\r\nIt seems to have the following features:\r\n* If you, the currently logged in user, are in the directory to be migrated from, your user data will not be migrated.\r\n* Users and groups will not be migrated if they already exist in the target directory. For example, if {{dcurrie}} exists in JIRA Internal and JIRA Delegated LDAP, yet has different groups in JIRA Internal, when migrating from one to the other, that user will be skipped an the groups will not be migrated.\r\n\r\nAnd of note:\r\n* Project Roles are not affected as they do not seem to be user directory specific (unlike groups).\r\n\r\nThis originally derived from JRA-24213 and now has a subsequent issue to add more functionality to the feature, JRA-27868.\r\n\r\nCan you please add some documentation for this feature? (it came in as part of 5.0.3 and somehow missed the [release notes|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/JIRA+5.0.3+Release+Notes]).\r\n\r\nThank you! \r\n",
