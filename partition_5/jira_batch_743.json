Problem:\r\n\r\nWe no longer have updated docs for classes such as https://developer.atlassian.com/static/javadoc/jira/5.1.8/reference/com/atlassian/jira/plugins/mail/handlers/package-summary.html from JIRA 5.1.8 onwards.\r\n\r\nThe code is still there, however it's not part of the official docs as the majority of JIRA code is focusing on moving to plugins and the plugin documentation is not considered to be part of the main JIRA API docs (ie the devs don't consider this to be the main API of JIRA). In JIRA we have a package that contains the main API classes and those are the ones we use ourselves. These mail handler docs rely on that API package - that is the official API. We also have a lot of classes that we expose, which means plugin devs can use them, however don't mark them as being part of the official API.\r\n\r\nPlugin devs could use the exposed classes, however they're not supposed to and should be using the API instead. This is the risk of using them - they are not official and may not continue to be documented or supported and can change any versions. Official API will always be documented and always supported. It will change, however it will be for major versions only (part of the whole stable API thing) and also have all the details displayed. I've been told this is not a deliberate decision, just a side effect of moving code out of JIRA core and into plugins. As it has been moved, docs are no longer publicly available.\r\n\r\nIn this example, they should be using https://docs.atlassian.com/jira/latest/com/atlassian/jira/service/util/handler/MessageHandler.html a it is official. We have an example at [Custom Message (Mail) Handler for JIRA|https://developer.atlassian.com/display/JIRADEV/Custom+Message+(Mail)+Handler+for+JIRA].\r\n\r\nh3. Request\r\n\r\nCan you please publish Javadocs for plugins that used to be part of JIRA core, or mention this in the JIRA release notes for plugin developers so they aren't left in the dark.\r\n\r\nThanks :)",

Apparently, the drag and drop feature works, but the \"old school\" button \"select file\" will not be followed by the popup to actually navigate to the that she wanted to upload. She was using firefox 14 and I was able to reproduce this behavior. It does work in chrome though. We have the latest plugin version installed (3.0.1) and recently updated JIRA to 6.1.5.\r\nCould you please take a look at this?\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nChris",

Some users were able to run the Java plug-in update as prompted and the popup works just fine i.e. they are able to attach a screenshot without issues. Some users are just not able to. See screenshot with the specific issue they are seeing. The users have updated their local machines to JDK7, they've uninstalled JDK7 back to JDK6 but to no avail. On systems where this feature works, we were prompted to upgrade to JDK7 and it worked without issues.\r\n\r\nWe have about 100 active users with most of them offshore and is delaying the QA process as they are now having to save the screenshots as an image and then attach it.",

      "description": "{panel:bgColor=#e7f4fa}\n  *NOTE:* This bug report is for *JIRA Server*. Using *JIRA Cloud*? [See the corresponding bug report|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-36642].\n  {panel}\n\nRecently we had to change the usernames of our user directory, so I upgraded JIRA from 6.0 to 6.1.4 to get the new feature.\r\n\r\nTo put it briefly, I have set up and run a script that invoked the JIRA 6.1.4 REST API and changed the usernames from *format A* to *format B*.\r\n\r\nEverything worked correctly and the JIRA web UI was OK, but then we had a huge problem with our integration scripts because the REST API started expanding the worklogs author incorrectly.\r\n\r\nFor instance, the following REST resources:\r\n{code}\r\nhttp(s)://jiraEndpointUrl/rest/api/2/issue/{issueKey}\r\n\r\nhttp(s)://jiraEndpointUrl/rest/api/2/issue/{issueKey}/worklog\r\n\r\nhttp(s)://jiraEndpointUrl/rest/api/2/search?jql=issueKey={issueKey}&fields=key,worklog,subtasks\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nexpanded worklog authors as follows:\r\n\r\n{code}\r\n{\"name\":\"username in format A\",\"active\":false}\r\n{code}\r\nwhich is wrong and unexpected.\r\n\r\nI did some investigation on the database and came out with the following observations:\r\n\r\n- Assumption (correct me if I'm wrong): The {{app_user}} table contains the mapping between user keys and lowercase user names and should be the source of information in JIRA to find a user by user key or vice versa. This is particularly true since there are unique constraints for each of the fields.\r\n\r\n- Looking at the table data after the renaming, the {{app_user}} table has a somewhat mixed situation (maybe because our JIRA was upgraded since 4.4 to 5.0, 6.0 and now to 6.1) where almost all entries have the structure {{(id=progressive number, user_key=old username in format A, lower_user_name=new username in format B)}}; only a few entries have user_key matched to the id and not to a username.\r\n\r\n- Now, the worklog table has the author column populated with username in format A, so matching the user_key as I expect, and the same holds for jiraissue, project, etc... everything in the database relates to user_key\r\n\r\nIt seemed clear to me that there is a bug in *the REST API implementation of the worklog object expansion, which seems to be unaware of the user_key attribute*. Seems like it's not looking up the app_user table at all.\r\n\r\nAnother \"proof\" comes from the JSON response of \r\n{code}\r\nhttp(s)://jiraEndpointUrl/rest/api/2/issue/{issueKey}\r\n{code} \r\nin which the users related to the issue object are expanded correctly (reporter, assignee) but the users expanded in the worklogs are not.\r\n\r\nAfter issuing a [question on Atlassian Answers |https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/250787/after-renaming-usernames-in-jira-6-1-4-worklogs-do-not-expand-author-correctly-in-rest-api ] I decided to do a brute-force \"fix\" at the database level, realigning user keys with user names, as reported in the link itself, and the problem of the user expansion in worklog JSON envelope went away.\r\n\r\nh4. Workaround\r\nUse the [{{/rest/api/2/user}}|https://docs.atlassian.com/jira/REST/latest/#api/2/user-getUser] endpoint to retrieve the user's username based on its key. This should return something like:\r\n{code:XML| borderStyle=solid| borderColor=#6A8EB3 |bgColor=#F8F8F8}\r\n{\r\n    \"active\": true,\r\n    \"avatarUrls\": {\r\n        \"16x16\": \"http://localhost:8080/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10122\",\r\n        \"24x24\": \"http://localhost:8080/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10122\",\r\n        \"32x32\": \"http://localhost:8080/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10122\",\r\n        \"48x48\": \"http://localhost:8080/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10122\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"displayName\": \"Matheus Fernandes\",\r\n    \"emailAddress\": \"mfernandes@atlassian.com\",\r\n    \"expand\": \"groups\",\r\n    \"groups\": {\r\n        \"items\": [],\r\n        \"size\": 7\r\n    },\r\n    \"key\": \"matheus\",\r\n    \"locale\": \"en_US\",\r\n    \"name\": \"mfernandes\",\r\n    \"self\": \"http://localhost:8080/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=matheus\",\r\n    \"timeZone\": \"Brazil/East\"\r\n}\r\n{code}",

The filters and dashboards are no longer shared for other users.\r\n\r\nTherefore, we have stopped deleting the groups. However, new employees are not added to the old groups. This will end in chaos, because we do not know exactly whether groups are still needed or not.

Expected Results\r\n\r\n# B in the internal directory gets renamed to B#1 in the app_user table\r\n# A gets renamed to B in the app_user table\r\n# Everything associated with both users becomes merged as the highest priority user\r\n\r\nh4. Actual Results\r\n\r\n# User rename appears like it's occurred fine, in the app_user table the internal user becomes A#1, and the LDAP user becomes A\r\n# Everything associated with both users becomes merged as the highest priority user\r\n# JIRA inconsistently recognises the B#2 in different aspects of the interface, it doesn't show up in the User Browser, but shows in certain Issue Attributes e.g Assignee or Reporter.\r\n# It is confusing to most Admins to suddenly see issue attributes automatically changing to B#2 when they have created no such user.\r\n# You're not able to login as B#2 to automatically regain access to the issues.\r\n# You are not able to use B#2 in the basic search, but then it shows up in Advanced JQL.\r\n# If you do a basic search with assignee set to B, then switch to Advanced JQL, the interface will not switch back to Basic\r\n\r\nh4. Notes\r\n\r\nDue to the way this handling works, you can't deliberately have a username that ends with # followed by any number. It gets created, and appears in the user list, but you can't find it in any user browser drop down, and if you try to assign anything to that user you get an error \"User 'user#1' cannot be assigned issues\".",

In this scenario, one would want to set the Affects Version field to that archived version. However, archived versions cannot be selected in version picker fields. The workaround is to un-archive the version, add it to the Affects Version, and then re-archive the version. This adds seemingly unnecessary effort that could be avoided by slightly changing the requirements for archived versions.\r\n\r\nOne possible solution would be to add another section at the end of the Affects Version drop down list for \"Archived Versions\", similar to \"Released Versions\" and \"Unreleased Versions\". Putting this section at the bottom of the list helps keep it farther out of reach, but still allows one to select archived versions if necessary.\r\n\r\nAnother possible solution would be to allow manual entry of an archived version, without displaying it in the drop down list.\r\n\r\nAllowing project administrators to enable/disable selecting archived versions would be a plus.",

This is been raised a few time in past issues here: see for instance  [\"Easy way of linking from one comment to another\"|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRA-19537] , or [\"Provide a way to link a comment to another issue's comment\"|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRA-28976] ; but the replies tend to be rather terse \"we will not be implementing this\".\r\n\r\nSo I wonder: Can you perhaps suggest, as the developers, how users should meet this need? Ie, when you need to refer someone to a previous post (one, for instance, that might be too long to quote), what is the best approach?",
