For example, if we want to add a transition to multiple workflow, wouldnt it be better if we select the workflow (which looks similar) and then add the transition instead of going through each workflow and add this?  Same for the adding versions, components for multiple projects.  I know there is the Command LIne Interface (CLI) plugin that does some of the features, but it should be built-in within JIRA.",

It's nice to have expand/collapse to save on scrolling, but it would be even nicer to see just a bit of the fields' contents as it's sometimes enough to get an idea what's in it.\r\nWhat do you think ?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nCristian",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-25898].\n  {panel}\n\nThis specifically applies to Customfield Type containing multiple fields.\r\n\r\nI've attached the Custom field plugin that helps user to store multiple addresses as part of Issue. Will take that as example to explain the problem. Please do use\r\n\r\n-> Each address is consists of Street, City and Zip code. All are three individual text fields. \r\n-> Using searcher (ExactAddressSearcher) available I can search on complete address. That's good till there.\r\n\r\nHere are couple of issues that will use as reference:\r\n\r\nIssue Number | Street | City | Zip Code\r\n--------------------------------------------------\r\nIssue 1 | Tasman | San Jose | 94533\r\nIssue 1 | Manning St. | Santa Clara | 34343\r\nIssue 2 | Cricket St  | Sydney | 11132\r\nIssue 2 | Brooks Blvd | Tasman | 22343\r\n\r\nNow if I search for \"San Jose\" I will get correct issue (issue 1).\r\n\r\nLet's say that I just want to search for all issues with with street name = \"Tasman\". Expectation is I should get only \"Issue 1\" in result. But I will get both issues in search result, this is because Tasman is available in both issues as part of Street or City name.\r\n\r\nAnd currently (as per my understanding) JIRA doesn't provide any way to do search on sub fields. \r\n\r\nCan you please add this functionality or help us to find out if there is any work around.\r\n\r\nthanks,\r\nRaju",

Yes this sounds exactly right, however, if there are many comments already existing, the comment gets lost. There's nothing indicating that comment was related to a specific image/attachment. When you click on the image, it takes over the screen showing the image, but the comment is not shown as a caption around the image. \r\n\r\nExample 2:\r\nResolving an issue with a comment does not refer back to the actual action of actually resolving. \r\n\r\nI understand that I could be labeling my comments appropriately at the beginning, but that is only if I do it.

      "description": "JIRA provides the ability to install plugins that contain custom user formats.  When you install one in JIRA 4.4.1, it appears under \"Administration\" > \"User Interface\" > \"Look and Feel\", but you don't get the option to select it when editing the settings.  In fact, no user formats (including the default) appear on the configuration screen.  See the screen shots for details.\r\n\r\nTo reproduce this:\r\n# build the jira-reference-plugin included with the 4.4.1 source \r\n# install it in 4.4.1\r\n# Navigate to \"Administration\" > \"User Interface\" > \"Look and Feel\". Note that the user formats provided by the reference plugin are all listed.\r\n# Click \"Edit Configuration\"\r\n# Expand the \"Customize Colors and Dates\" section and scroll down.  Note that the user formats do not appear and are not selectable.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if this is a flaw in the reference plugin or JIRA 4.4.1, either way, it needs to be addressed.\r\n\r\nThe documentation for the plugin module type is also out of date:\r\n\r\nhttps://developer.atlassian.com/display/JIRADEV/User+Format+Plugin+Module\r\n\r\nWhatever the correct process is for installing and configuring these, it needs to be reflected in the developer documentation when all is said and done.
