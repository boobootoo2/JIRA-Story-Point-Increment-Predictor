Note on fix \r\nSince the problem is caused by slow parsing of HTML string response (with a massive amount of whitespaces), we switched to _DOMParser API_ to parse it before passing it further. This way the faulty line with `trim` method is omitted. \r\nAlso, we spotted the same problem on the issue view page (UI was stalled for ~15 seconds). We fixed it too. (/) \r\n\r\nh3.

Issue Summary\r\n\r\nWhen trying to play any video attachment on issues by clicking on them using *Google Chrome or Safari*, the video doesn't start playing and returns http status code 302.\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # We have installed a fresh Jira Software Instance on version 8.16 (Affected Version) and also we installed a fresh Jira Software instances on versions 8.15.1, 8.15.0, 8.14.1, 8.14.0 and 8.13.4 only for troubleshooting purpose.\r\n # Created an Project new project.\r\n # Created an Issue (Bug and Task) at the project created on step before.\r\n # Attached a .mp4 video to that issue and tried to play it on Chrome and Safari.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nIt was expected that the video would start to play on both web browsers.\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nThe video doesn't start to play only on version 8.16 (Affected Version) and since the request doesn't contain JSESSIONID cookies (in case of Google Chrome), it will be redirected to login page with 302 http status code:\r\n{noformat}\r\nRequest URL: http://localhost:48160/j8160/secure/attachment/10001/Test.mp4Request\r\nMethod: GETStatus Code: 302\r\nRemote Address: [::1]:48160\r\nReferrer Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin\r\n{noformat}\r\n* In a nutshell there will be redirection loop\r\n\r\nh3. Note\r\nThe problem is a functional regression that happened in Safari/Chrome after introducing {{Content-Security-Policy}} header. This is was done as part of the improvement of Jira attachment content security. \r\n\r\n+Details:+ \r\nAfter setting {{Content-Security-Policy}} header to {{sandbox}} value, Google Chrome treat it as \"_unique origin_\", see [Content Security Policy|https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/security/csp]\r\nbq. This can have a wide range of effects on the page: forcing the page into a unique origin, and preventing form submission, among others.\r\n\r\nAnd related docs [CSP: sandbox|https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/sandbox]\r\n{quote}\r\nallow-same-origin\r\n   Allows the content to be treated as being from its normal origin. If this keyword is not used, the embedded content is treated as being from a unique origin.\r\n{quote}\r\nso this prevents a browser from sending the required cookies to Jira. \r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nIn order to enable Chrome and Safari to properly playback attachments (like videos or sounds) added to issues admin can disable a feature flag by adding a Site Wide Dark Feature called\u00a0{{jira.security.csp.sandbox.disabled}}. This will disable setting header {{Content-Security-Policy}} to {{sandbox}} for attachments and other assets.",

If they change the title to one that contains Czech characters (e.g., *{{MyText\u011b\u0161\u010d\u0159\u017e\u00fd\u00e1\u00ed\u00e9\u00fa\u016f\u0165}}*), the text displays incorrectly.\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Set up a vanilla instance of Jira, with standard encoding (-Dfile.encoding=utf-8 and -Dsun.jnu.encoding=UTF-8) in the application server and database\r\n # Develop a sample dashboard item, as per the document above\r\n # In the \"dashboard-item-tutorial.js\" file, in function\r\n\"DashboardItem.prototype.renderEdit\" create json and save properties\r\nlike this:\r\npreferences[\"TestLocalString\"]\u00a0= \"Local chars: \u0161 \u0161 \u010d \u0159 \u017e \u00fd \u00e1 \u00ed \u00e9 \u00fa \u016f \u0165\";\r\nthis.API.savePreferences(preferences);\r\n # In the same \"dashboard-item-tutorial.js\" file in the function\r\n\"DashboardItem.prototype.render\" read this properties like this:\r\nconsole.log(\"CSAS render function: \"+preferences[\"TestLocalString\"])\r\nor set the title of dashboard:\r\nthis.API.setTitle(\"Name-text from preferences:\r\n\"+preferences[\"TestLocalString\"]);\r\n # Create a .jar file for the dashboard item\r\n # Upload the .jar file to Jira\r\n # Create a dashboard, using a gadget from the newly uploaded .jar file\r\n\r\nWe could also reproduce the same sort of behaviour as follows:\r\n # Set up a vanilla instance of Jira, with standard encoding (-Dfile.encoding=utf-8 and -Dsun.jnu.encoding=UTF-8) in the application server and database\r\n # Develop a sample dashboard item, as per the document above\r\n # In the\u00a0*dashboard-item-tutorial.properties* file, set\u00a0*{{com.example.plugins.tutorial.dashboard.item.title=MyText\u011b\u0161\u010d\u0159\u017e\u00fd\u00e1\u00ed\u00e9\u00fa\u016f\u0165}}*\r\n # Create a .jar file for the dashboard item\r\n # Upload the .jar file to Jira\r\n # Create a dashboard, using a gadget from the newly uploaded .jar file\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\nh3.
