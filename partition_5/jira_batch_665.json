The 'Reject' transition has a validator that requires a comment filled in.\r\n\r\nWhen a bulk transition of 'Reject' is used, JIRA does not see that a screen is attached (I guess it can't see the difference between an empty screen and no screen at all).\r\n\r\nResult is that we can not give any comments and therefor the validation failed.

When I attempt to associate a workflow scheme with a project by selecting the \"Associate\" link next to the workflow name, it displays a box with all the projects to which I can apply the selection.  The problem is that it also shows projects ALREADY associated with said scheme in highlighted fashion.  If I am not careful, I may simply click the project I want to associate and inadvertently deselect projects already associated.  This may happen, for example, if the projects already associated with the scheme are out of view (requiring to use the scroll bar to bring them into view).  If this mistake is made, the projects will be de-associated from the scheme and set to the default scheme.  This has happened several times at my company already.\r\n\r\nA solution I propose is to show only the projects which are NOT associated with the scheme.  This will prevent projects from being de-associated by mistake.\r\n\r\nThanks",

The nature of the protocol is that a partial memento of the email is made available to Mail Handlers, and that calls to the underlying message object to obtain body content and attachments result in direct chatter back to the mailserver.  If the mailserver decides for some reason to kill the connection the client Mail Handler gets a Folder Closed Exception, which is covered in quite a few places:\r\n- https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRA-29228\r\n\r\nCurrently, what can happen is that in this situation, the mail handler cannot process the mail, because the server closed the connection.  The JIRA API for Mail Handlers currently provides a TRUE (we processed it, so mark read or delete) / FALSE (we didn't process it, leave it unread).  Unfortunately what seems to happen is that the 'broken' nature of this message is somehow cached via the IMAP connection, and is re-presented to mail handlers again, which breaks, again.\r\n\r\nIt may be possible to 'poke' the Mail Service back into life by revalidating its mail connection, but this may have unforeseen implications for other mail handers that could be in progress, hence this issue.\r\n\r\nPotentially mail handlers could return 'true' to indicate that JIRA should mark the message read and delete, it's possible that would stop the same message being re-presented to the mail handler repeatedly, but could result in message loss without processing, so isnt a good option.\r\n\r\nIt would be better if a Mail Handler API enabled support for a specific Exception to indicate the nature of the problem (generally ALL related to IMAP), to drive the connection refresh, or return some kind of enumeration, which allows for more expressive hinting about what JIRA should do in the event of a failure to process a message that occurs at a protocol level.\r\n",

Summary\r\n\r\nWhen using a CSV import to update a moved issue, it incorrectly moves the issue back to the previous project and viewing the issue is no longer possible.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n# Import or create an issue, for example MWK-1.\r\n# Move issue to another project, in this example it becomes TECH-2. This can also involve changing things such as version and component, which are project-specific.\r\n# CSV import the issue using the old key MWK-1.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nThe TECH-2 issue is updated, using the data from MWK-1 (it will correctly find the issue using the {{moved_issue_key}} table).\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nThe issue key is moved back to the old project - for example TECH-2 is moved into the MWK project, and keeps the correct issuenum (3). Additionally, the below exception is thrown when attempting to view MWK-1, and TECH-2 will 404.\r\n\r\n{noformat}\r\njava.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Passed List had more than one value.\r\n\tat org.ofbiz.core.entity.EntityUtil.getOnly(EntityUtil.java:62) [entityengine-1.2.3.jar:?]\r\n\tat com.atlassian.jira.issue.managers.DefaultIssueManager$IssueFinder.getIssueFromIssueEntityByProjectAndNumber(DefaultIssueManager.java:986) [DefaultIssueManager$IssueFinder.class:?]\r\n\tat com.atlassian.jira.issue.managers.DefaultIssueManager$IssueFinder.getIssueFromIssueEntity(DefaultIssueManager.java:982) [DefaultIssueManager$IssueFinder.class:?]\r\n\tat com.atlassian.jira.issue.managers.DefaultIssueManager$IssueFinder.getIssue(DefaultIssueManager.java:959) [DefaultIssueManager$IssueFinder.class:?]\r\n\tat com.atlassian.jira.issue.managers.DefaultIssueManager.getIssue(DefaultIssueManager.java:140) [DefaultIssueManager.class:?]\r\n\tat com.atlassian.jira.issue.managers.DefaultIssueManager.getIssueObject(DefaultIssueManager.java:340) [DefaultIssueManager.class:?]\r\n\tat com.atlassian.jira.bc.issue.DefaultIssueService.getIssue(DefaultIssueService.java:170) [DefaultIssueService.class:?]\r\n\tat sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke0(Native Method) [?:1.8.0_20]\r\n\tat sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(NativeMethodAccessorImpl.java:62) [?:1.8.0_20]\r\n\tat sun.reflect.DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.java:43) [?:1.8.0_20]\r\n\tat java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Method.java:483) [?:1.8.0_20]\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nSee [^full_stack_trace] for more info.\r\n\r\nh3.

Workaround\r\n\r\nThe issue cannot be accessed to be moved, unless through bulk edit. Then when moving the issue back to TECH, it will create a new issue key (such as TECH-3). MWK-1 will then not redirect to TECH-3 and anything linked to TECH-2 will break. As such a SQL update is needed. For example:\r\n\r\n# Stop JIRA.\r\n# Identify the appropriate project:\r\n{noformat}\r\nselect id from project where pkey = 'TECH';\r\n  id\r\n-------\r\n 10001\r\n(1 row)\r\n{noformat}\r\n# Update the issue to have the correct project:\r\n{noformat}\r\nupdate jiraissue set project = 10001 where id = 10001;\r\nUPDATE 1\r\n{noformat}\r\n# Start JIRA and reindex.\r\n\r\nThis will allow updating with CSV, however any affected issue keys will need to be restored after the import. The alternative is to not map the issue key field however then new issues will be created instead of updating old ones.",

      "description": "h3. Summary\r\nWhen setting JIRA up to run behind Apache HTTP server with SSL, as per our documentation: https://confluence.atlassian.com/jira/integrating-jira-with-apache-using-ssl-203395380.html \r\nThe redirection to the proxy FQDN does not work. \r\nReferring to step 7 of *Configure Tomcat*:\r\n{quote}\r\nTest that the new connector is working by accessing JIRA on the appropriate proxy connector, for example http://jiraserver:8080/. This should redirect to the proxy FQDN (in this example, https://jira.atlassian.com), which will fail as the proxy is not yet configured. The test is to ensure Tomcat is set up to correctly redirect to the proxy.\r\n{quote}\r\nIn JIRA 7.1.0 and 7.1.1, accessing the non-proxy port directly does not trigger the redirect. You can access JIRA over localhost:8080/ \r\nThis does not happen on JIRA 7.0.9 or 6.4.12.\r\n\r\nh3. Environment\r\n* JIRA 7.1.0 or newer.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Install JIRA 7.1.0, and configure its connector:\r\n{code}\r\n<Connector port=\"8082\"\r\n\r\n                   maxThreads=\"150\"\r\n                   minSpareThreads=\"25\"\r\n                   connectionTimeout=\"20000\"\r\n\r\n                   enableLookups=\"false\"\r\n                   maxHttpHeaderSize=\"8192\"\r\n                   protocol=\"HTTP/1.1\"\r\n                   useBodyEncodingForURI=\"true\"\r\n                   redirectPort=\"443\"\r\n                   acceptCount=\"100\"\r\n                   disableUploadTimeout=\"true\"\r\n\r\n                   proxyName=\"test.dleng.org\"\r\n                   proxyPort=\"443\"\r\n                   scheme=\"https\"\r\n                   secure=\"true\"/>\r\n{code}\r\n# Set up Apache HTTP server:\r\n{code}\r\n<VirtualHost *:443>\r\n        <Proxy *>\r\n          Order deny,allow\r\n          Allow from all\r\n        </Proxy>\r\n        SSLEngine               On\r\n        SSLProxyEngine          On\r\n        ProxyRequests           Off\r\n\r\n        ServerName test.dleng.org\r\n\r\n        ProxyPass               /       http://localhost:8082/\r\n        ProxyPassReverse        /       http://localhost:8082/\r\n\r\n        #   A self-signed (snakeoil) certificate can be created by installing\r\n        #   the ssl-cert package. See\r\n        #   /usr/share/doc/apache2.2-common/README.Debian.gz for more info.\r\n        #   If both key and certificate are stored in the same file, only the\r\n        #   SSLCertificateFile directive is needed.\r\n        SSLCertificateFile /etc/apache2/extra/example.org/apache.crt\r\n        SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/apache2/extra/example.org/apache.key\r\n</VirtualHost>\r\n{code}\r\nYou can generate the self-signed certificate and key with: \r\n{code}\r\nsudo openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout example.org/apache.key -out example.org/apache.crt\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nAccessing http://localhost:8082/ should redirect you to https://test.dleng.org/ \r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n# While JIRA is *still starting up*, the redirect to proxy works just fine. Accessing via http://localhost:8082/ redirects to https://test.dleng.org/\r\n# *After* JIRA starts up successfully, notice that the redirect doesn't work anymore. You can access JIRA via http://localhost:8082. \r\nAdditionally behaviours include being unable to log-in if you access via localhost. \r\n# The following appears in the atlassian-jira.log:\r\n{code}\r\n2016-03-12 16:17:47,112 http-nio-8082-exec-15 WARN anonymous 977x33x1 - 0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1 /rest/webResources/1.0/resources [c.a.p.r.c.security.jersey.XsrfResourceFilter] Additional XSRF checks failed for request: https://test.dleng.org/rest/webResources/1.0/resources , origin: http://localhost:8082 , referrer: http://localhost:8082/secure/Dashboard.jspa , credentials in request: true , allowed via CORS: false\r\n2016-03-12 16:17:47,160 http-nio-8082-exec-16 WARN anonymous 977x34x1 - 0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1 /rest/webResources/1.0/resources [c.a.p.r.c.security.jersey.XsrfResourceFilter] Additional XSRF checks failed for request: https://test.dleng.org/rest/webResources/1.0/resources , origin: http://localhost:8082 , referrer: http://localhost:8082/secure/Dashboard.jspa , credentials in request: true , allowed via CORS: false\r\n{code}\r\n# A warning message appears below the UI, with message:\r\n{code}\r\nWe've detected a potential problem with JIRA's Dashboard configuration that your administrator can correct.

Resolution\r\nNot a bug. It's a new behavior of JIRA 7.1. The root page no longer redirects.",

Summary\r\nWhen viewing certain content such as the average age gadget in the wallboard, you cannot tell what filter the graph belongs to as there is no title containing the filter name.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Create a dashboard\r\n# Add an average age gadget\r\n# View as wallboard\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nThe filter name should be included as a title, so that the chart is identifiable amongst other similar charts.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nThere is no title provided for the gadget\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\nThere is a workaround to enable the *Text gadget* and add it next to each chart: [Gadgets Jira applications|https://confluence.atlassian.com/jiracoreserver073/gadgets-for-jira-applications-861257078.html].\r\n(!) The text gadget is disabled by default because it is a potential security risk, as it can contain arbitrary HTML which could potentially make your JIRA system vulnerable to XSS attacks.\r\n\r\n# From the apps administration page, enable the *Text* module under the *Atlassian JIRA - Plugins - Gadgets Plugin*\r\n# Add the *Text* gadget next to each gadget in your dashboard\r\n# Add a title, and in the HTML field enter a gadget title, for example:\r\n{code}\r\n<h1>Created vs. Resolved</h1>\r\n{code}\r\n# Place the title next to it's corresponding gadget, and edit the layout if necessary\r\n",

After analyzing this issue, these are our thoughts on it:\r\n* This issue is specific to functions provided by the web browsers, not something in Jira itself. \r\n* This has only been reported for Jira 7.0.4 which reached [End of life|https://confluence.atlassian.com/support/atlassian-support-end-of-life-policy-201851003.html] some time ago.\r\n* As of now, this behavior is no longer reproducible in the latest versions for the supported web browsers:\r\n** Chrome 70: backspace is no longer linked to the  \"back\" browsing function.\r\n** Firefox 63: you get a message indicating that you will lose the data: [^TestFirefox63.png]\r\n** Internet Explorer:  [^IE11.png].\r\n** MS Edge:  [^MSEdge.png]\r\n\r\nThis was tested in Jira 7.12.3\r\n\r\nFrom these findings, we have decided to close this bug request. In case you have examples where you are experiencing this issue using supported Jira and web browser versions, please let us know!\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nRen\u00e9 Chiquete - Atlassian Support.\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to reproduce with Chrome:\r\n\r\n# Navigate around a bit so that you'r browser tab has some history\r\n# Click the create issue link on top of the page\r\n# Write something in description field\r\n# Click the white space immediately to the left of the description field (so that the field loses focus)\r\n# Hit backspace\r\n# The browser should load the previous page you visited and you'll lose whatever you wrote in to the description field\r\n\r\nh3, Actual Results\r\n\r\nBrowser navigates back and the dialog and its contents are lost.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nA confirmation message is displayed to prevent the user from losing the data in the form.\r\n\r\nh3. Notes \r\nThis does not work if the browser tab does not have any history to go back to\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\nCurrently there is no known workaround for this behavior. A workaround will be added here when available",
