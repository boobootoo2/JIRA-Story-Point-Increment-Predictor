      "description": "This is related to SRCTREE-7702. When I copy one or more paths from the list of files in a particular commit, I often want to perform some kind of operation in the repo directory: editing or zipping up those files or whatever. Probably 90% of the time, what I really want is not the full absolute path to each file, but instead the path to each file relative to the root folder. In fact, I want those paths _exactly as they're displayed in the list of commit files_.\r\n\r\nIntelliJ IDEA does a nice job of this, providing a number of options when copying paths, including absolute path, path from source root (which wouldn't really apply to Sourcetree because it's not aware of what a source folder is), and path from content root (project root, I think) or path from repository root, i.e. something like {{src/main/java/.../Foo.java}}, which is what I'd like as an alternative.",

For example, the third file in the list is named\u00a0{{BaseXnatImageassessordata.java}}, meaning the \"truncated\" version is actually four characters\u00a0_longer_ than the actual name.
