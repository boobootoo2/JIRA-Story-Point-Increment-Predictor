To be able to log in to JIRA with this configuration, users must either be created first in JIRA, or the option 'Copy User on First Login' can be checked to automatically add them to JIRA's internal directory. Copied users can subsequently be modified in Confluence, but modifications will not be reflected on the LDAP server.\r\n\r\nGroups and memberships from the LDAP server will not be used. However, users from LDAP can be added to groups maintained in JIRA's internal directory.\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nLet's say the user's info is the following:\r\n* uid=testuser\r\n* mail=testuser@ldapemail.com\r\n\r\nIf we try to change an attribute for one of the users in this delegated directory, for example, the email address (changing from *testuser@ldapemail.com* to *testuser@jiraemail.com*), next time the users logs in JIRA, the email address is set to the *testuser@ldapemail.com*. \r\n\r\nThis behaviour also can be observed by editing the user's Full Name.",

A better approach would be to use separate \"Global Fix Version\" attribute(s) but such version attributs would be a conceptual new thing in JIRA. \r\n\r\nThese things influence the way we should map JIRA projects over sections of our product structure so it is really important.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nRuchi",

Therefore, I believe there should be a configuration whereby an issue can be moved regardless of the reporter's create issue permission.  The move procedures can only be done by a JIRA administration.\r\n\r\nAs a scenario:\r\n\"I guess I think of it like this: Imagine if you guys created a project for \"Issues raised by important customers\" - and defined the permissions so that people like me couldn't create issues directly in this project, but a responsible atlassian administrator could move an issue that I raised into this project if I was discovered to be an important customer. Mr Atlassian Admin is carrying out his weekly review and moves 60 issues into this new project - and JIRA requests that he choose a new reporter for all 60 issues. Now you don't know who raised them!\"",

The new version exports packages required by A, but the dependencies for A has already been resolved. Plugin A still does not interact with B, although it could. Furthermore, JIRA administrator may not know the reason why plugin A does not work with plugin B, if that's something they expect.\r\n\r\nDisabling and then enabling plugin A does not help - the bundle is not re-resolved. The only things that help are: a) JIRA restart; b) Uninstallation/installtion of plugin B.\r\n\r\nI suggest to add manual button in the UPM that will force plugin into disabled state, re-resolve the bundle, and enable plugin back.\r\n\r\nAlso the questionable dependencies can be detected automatically and the system could suggest the admin to re-resolve plugin A after upgrade of plugin B.",

Since the screenshots also illustrate the example description (which is part of the introductory blurb about configuring field tabs), I thought it best to leave them where they were. I agree though (i.e. in reference to the other doc pages in this issue) that it's better to move tables of reference information below their step-by-step instructions, as their content is too specific and do not form part of the introductory material.\r\n\r\nhttp://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Managing+Project+Permissions\r\n\r\nhttp://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Labelling+an+Issue\r\n\r\nhttp://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Logging+Work+on+an+Issue\r\n\r\nhttp://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Modifying+Multiple+%28%27Bulk%27%29+Issues\r\n* Update outdated screenshots on this page too.\r\n\r\nCheers\r\n\r\nGeoff",
