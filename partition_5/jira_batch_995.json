The header block in the \"Printable\" browser display displays:\n\n\"Sort by: Status ascending, then by Updated ascending, then by (third column)\".\n\nWhenever one clicks on a column head, the sort is performed by this column first, then by the column selected before etc.\n\nHowever I am unable to reproduce this on other JIRA 2.6.1 Enterprise sites.  When clicking on the column header in the \"Printable\" view the table is redisplayed sorted by the new column, but it is not sorted by the previous column. Also the header block displays \"Sort by: (column)\" only, without the \"then by: (second column)\" part.\n\nThe user owning the JIRA site with the multi column sorting capability also reports that this feature does not always work.\n\nSo the two questions are:\n\n1. how do I enable multi column sorting on my JIRA 2.6.1 site?\n2. how do I make this working reliably?",

This is quite a common need, as project leaders often need to delegate certain tasks.  An example is delegation of \"defect management\" for a project.  Ordinarily, on the assignee, reporter and project lead can edit or re-assign an issue.  However the defect manager needs to be able to do this for any issue in the project. \n\nBasically what is needed is a built-in per-project group called \"Project Admins\" or similar.  It would be different for each project (like the project lead is), but could be assigned permissions globally within a scheme.  \n\nAlternatively, you could allow permissions to be assigned to the group of Component Leads (implicitely per-project).

      "description": "We run Oracle's standby server called Dataguard, which does real-time replication of live production data to a remote site.  Our current setup does a physical standby, but we want to set up a local logical standby, meaning the DB instance is actually mounted for us to hit with queries w/out affecting the primary production instance.\n\nThe problem is that Oracle for some reason will not allow a logical standby instance of live data if the datatype LONG is used... it only likes numbers.  So you ask why do they do this?  I don't know... it's Oracle, they are strange.  Anyway, what's the chance you can change the following column's data type to NUMBER instead of LONG?  Is it technically feasible?\n\nTable: PROPERTYDATA\nColumn: PROPERTYVALUE\nCurrent Datatype: LONG RAW\n\nOooohhh even more fun... I think it has to do with the customfield stuff???",
