My first priority would be unlocking the commit tree as it would allow the diff area to inhabit the entire vertical space, and it would allow a longer view of the commit tree as well.\r\n\r\nThis same effect can be experienced in GitBash which I found to be much easier to run through diff lists, resulting in more effective / efficient use of my time.  I have to keep the fonts so small in SourceTree to be able to keep larger diff blocks in view that it becomes useless in many cases.",

      "description": "This is perhaps the biggest quirk about SourceTree that I have found. I make changes to my branch and commit them. I do this a couple of times and then click the push button. By default it selects all of my branches. I may have ten or so branches but only commits on the one I am working on. I click ok and it pushes and then comes back with an error message that says my push failed. I go and pull and try it again. Still failing. Low and behold my push actually succeeded but a push to a branch with no changes failed. First I am not sure why a push of no changes should fail. Secondly why would they need to be checked anyway and why do I get a big red bar and have to click cancel when everything is just fine?\r\n\r\nThis is even more confusing if you use the check box that says push commits immediately. It will say that your commit succeeded but your push failed. In reality both succeeded and a push to a branch with no changes on it failed. I am used to this by now but i am reminded about it when people new to SourceTree are watching me. \r\n\r\nThem: \"Oh your push failed.\"  \r\nMe: \"Actually it worked it just looks like it didnt work\"\r\nThem: \"Oh, but there was a big red bar and a pop up saying it didnt work\"\r\nMe: \"Yeah I know\"\r\n\r\nYeah, so it is trainable but not very intuitive.

Now i tried it again after the 1.5 update (removing all files / appdata and fully uninstalling it to find tit once again crashing as soon as i opened the application ). The weird thing is also that their are no error logs.\r\n\r\nOriginal post: https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/263463/sourcetree-1-4-10-crashes-on-windows-8-1\r\n\r\n------------\r\n\r\nI am experiencing the following problem even after removing all appdata and reinstalling the program keeps crashing on windows 8.1 making it unusable. The weird thing at work i run it on windows 8.1 to where it works without a problem.\r\n\r\nGenerally what happens is it starts up okay, but the moment you try to open a window the content of the window is not rendered (buttons that are somewhere on the window do work though dont know why) after a few seconds though the whole application crashes.\r\n\r\nEdit: Photo for clarity:\r\nhttp://s19.postimg.org/hzt4yf8df/sourcetree_crash.png",

      "description": "Hi Adam,\r\nI\u2019d like to open a ticket for an issue we had with SourceTree version 1.4.1.0.  I guess we would call this a feature request.  It doesn\u2019t really qualify as a bug.\r\nSourceTree stores authentication information for remote servers.  If my password on the remote server changes and I fail to update it on SourceTree, operations like pull requests fail with failed authentication as the reason.  That works as expected.\r\n \r\nWhat wasn\u2019t clear is that every ten minutes SourceTree contacts the remote server for all repos.  If the password stored in SourceTree is incorrect it never notifies the user that these operations fail.   We use Stash configured for delegated LDAP so the net effect is that SourceTree asks Stash to authenticate a user with a bad password, Stash forwards to our internal LDAP directory.  Authentication fails.  LDAP detects too many failed logins and locks the account across all systems using LDAP (along with sending a nasty note about DDOS).\r\n \r\nRequest:\r\nAlert the user when authentication fails. Stop trying after several failed attempts.\r\n \r\nNotes:\r\nThere is a chance that this should be a behavior change in Stash instead of or as well as in SourceTree. \r\n  \r\n",

I will cross-post here along with suggestions from the thread that I tried and their results.\r\n\r\nI am finding that SourceTree on Windows 7 is incredibly slow to refresh after any action, whether that is staging a file, committing/pulling/pushing, refreshing after a tracked file has been updated, or pressing the commit button. As a test I added a line to a file and to stage and commit that file took at least a minute. Some details:\r\n\r\n1.  The laptop I'm using is well speced: i7, 8GB RAM, SSD so I don't think it is the problem.\r\n\r\n2.  I only have one repo in SourceTree which is 1GB on my local disk but 99% of that is in a folder which is ignored in .gitignore. I downloaded the repo as a zip file from Github, extracted it and it was 74MB. The repo is hosted on Github and but is private so I am unable to link it.\r\n\r\n3.  I am running version 1.4.1 but have experienced the same slowness on 1.4.0 and 1.3.3 (I downloaded these to test this problem).\r\n\r\n4.  The Xray unit testing framework () is included as a sub-module but the slowness pre-dates the inclusion of this.\r\n\r\n5.  I have 'Show pending' selected in the drop down menu.\r\n\r\n6.  I tried to run a few simple commands in Git Bash - add, and status - and they were slow but possibly not quite as slow as in SourceTree. Definitely a lot slower than I've seen on colleagues' identically speced computers with the same repo. I am using embedded Git - version 1.8.3. For clarity my colleagues are using Git Bash, not SourceTree.\r\n\r\n7.  I ran git count-objects and there were just under 2000 objects totally around 2MB. Foolishly I closed the window before I got the exact numbers but they were in that region. I've run git gc but haven't noticed any improvement.\r\n\r\nI would love to get to the bottom of this issue because SourceTree is by far the best Git client I have ever come across. Please let me know if you require any further information.",

There is a context menu for each Stash that will let you Apply or Delete a saved stash.\r\n\r\nThis really needs improvement.\r\n\r\nI had managed to resize my \"left sidebar\" so that it was completely hidden (well, not obvious that it was there at any rate). The only thing that looked like a \"left sidebar\" to me was the Bookmarks sidebar. As a result I spent a half hour trying to make sense of the few support answers I could find.\r\n\r\nTwo things would make this better. 1) Make the resize of the left sidebar more clear. Somehow make it obvious that there is content hidden when the sidebar is collapsed and make it easy to reset it back to appropriate dimensions. 2) Provide a GUI wizard to make unstashing as easy as stashing and put the action alongside the Stash icon in the toolbar. Additionally, provide a command in the Repository menu that is clearly the command partner of Stash.",

Developers are reporting the same thing about merge tool configurations. SourceTree was not launching the chosen mergetool, we found that if the developers copied the mergetool configs from the global .gitconfig into the local-repo .gitconfig then everything worked.

This is even more true with distributed VC -- even deleting an entire repo on one machine would not cost me too much.  That being the case, I DON'T need to be protected from screwing up.
