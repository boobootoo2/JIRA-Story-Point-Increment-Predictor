This is not correctly handled by Jira's ORM.\r\n\r\nThe issue by itself should only make it impossible to save the issue with the incorrect data, but it is also a trigger for JRASERVER-70333.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Set up Jira on PostgreSQL database,\r\n # Create new project,\r\n # Create new text custom field and add it to issue scheme for this project,\r\n # Generate any non empty string which is not allowed by the\u00a0PostgreSQL, for instance:\r\n ** based on [this|https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1347646/postgres-error-on-insert-error-invalid-byte-sequence-for-encoding-utf8-0x0] generate string with empty character,\r\n ** open developer tools in you browser,\r\n ** in console invoke \"*console.log('a\\0a')*\" function(the output will be \"*aa*\" but for real there will be an empty character between the '*a*' letters),\r\n ** copy paste the output to the custom field,\r\n # Try to create the issue\r\n # Check the log\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nEither:\r\n* The problem is handled by ORM\r\n* Null character is forbidden on the field validator level\r\n* Null character is removed from the field\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nError message presented to the user reads as follows:\r\n{noformat}\r\nWe can't create this issue for you right now, it could be due to unsupported content you've entered into one or more of the issue fields.

This works well for operations such as CSV export and indexing, which access each issue only once. However, there are some bulk operations that iterate over the same issues multiple times. So far we have identified these:\r\n * bulk issue edit\r\n * changing project issue type scheme (requires issue type mapping) (70 mins for 21k issues)\r\n\r\nIn these cases, the cache that holds values for the last 10 issues is constantly being reloaded, which makes it practically as there _is no cache_ (see notes below).\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # <TBD>\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n * Bulk issue operations are fast\r\n * DB is not overloaded with requests\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n * bulk issue operations are slow\r\n * Large number of SQL operations querying {{customfieldvalue}} table:\r\n{noformat}\r\nSELECT ID, ISSUE, CUSTOMFIELD, UPDATED, PARENTKEY, STRINGVALUE, NUMBERVALUE, TEXTVALUE, DATEVALUE, VALUETYPE FROM customfieldvalue WHERE ISSUE='<ID>'\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nh3.

      "description": "Hello,\r\n\r\nSoon, we started a collaboration with a old client of us but this time with Atlassian applications, they got a servicedesk and a Jira server license and they had a security audit ofer them, this is what they've got from it and they need to solve these issues asap.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nMany of the problems that applications are solving require limits to the number of times a function can be used or action can be executed. Applications must be \u201csmart enough\u201d to not allow the user to exceed their limit on the use of these functions since in many cases each time the function is used the user may gain some type of benefit that must be accounted for to properly compensate the owner. For example: an eCommerce site may only allow a users apply a discount once per transaction, or some applications may be on a subscription plan and only allow users to download three complete documents monthly.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nVulnerabilities related to testing for the function limits are application specific and misuse cases must be created that strive to exercise parts of the application/functions/ or actions more than the allowable number of times\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nAttackers may be able to circumvent the business logic and execute a function more times than \u201callowable\u201d exploiting the application for personal gain.\r\n\r\nIf anyone intercept the request when he try to recover any password, the application configuration permit to send unlimited request to server:\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n[http://prntscr.com/q5jfvr]\r\n\r\nIn anyone intercept the request, after completing all filed from \"Initiere\" menu, send multiple request to server with a ticket. The application permit to create another ticket without captcha security code:\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nhttp://prntscr.com/q5jg1h\r\n\r\nIn anyone intercept the request, after completing all filed from \"Maturare\" menu, send multiple request to server with a ticket. The application permit to create another ticket without captcha security code:\r\n\r\n[http://prntscr.com/q5jg85]\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nCountermeasures:\r\n\r\nThe application should have checks to ensure that the business logic is being followed and that if a function/action can only be executed a certain number of times, when the limit is reached the user can no longer execute the function. To prevent users from using a function over the appropriate number of times the application may use mechanisms such as cookies to keep count or through sessions not allowing users to access to execute the function additional times.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nWe would be very glad if this issue will be taken as a security risk.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nCristian L.",

Issue Summary\r\nWhen the *Group Object Filter* attribute in the external directory connector is used to filter out a group, this group is deleted from Jira.\r\n\r\nHowever, it there's a filter or dashboard shared with this group, the share permissions are not updated. The shared object will still be seen as shared with the group that has already been deleted from Jira.\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Connect an external directory and sync groups\r\n # Share a filter with an external group\r\n # Filter out the group so it doesn't get sync'd\r\n # Verify the group is deleted from Jira by the next sync\r\n # Go to *Shared filters* in the admin part of Jira.\r\n # View the share permissions of the filter.\r\n\r\nh3.

Actual Results\r\nDeleted group still shows in the filter permissions.\r\n +*Notes*+\r\n* If the deleted group is local, it will also be deleted from the filter share permissions.\r\n* The issue also impacts shared dashboards.\r\n* Due to this bug, changing the owner of an impacted shared filter is not possible.

Issue Summary\r\n\r\nCustomers are experiencing upon upgrading to Jira 8.0+ from 7.0+ that full lock and re-index runs into {{ResultSet closed}} error from their database (happens on SqlServer and Postgres so far).\r\n\r\nThe trend from customers is that most of the time their {{dbconfig.xml}} has default max pool size of 20 threads, and Jira 8.0+ has default re-index thread of 20.\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nUnable to reproduce, requires data and load.\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nReindex completes successfully.\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nReindex fails with the error message -\r\n{noformat}\r\n2019-11-13 15:57:44,805 JiraTaskExecutionThread-4 ERROR xxxx xxxxxxx 297u5a xx.xxx.xx.xx,127.0.0.1 /secure/admin/IndexReIndex!reindex.jspa [c.a.j.util.index.CompositeIndexLifecycleManager] Reindex All FAILED.

Workaround\r\n\r\nIf this problem affects your instance running Jira < 8.14.0, you can apply the fix yourself by setting the following values in [{{jira-config.properties}}|https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirakb/edit-the-jira-config-properties-file-in-jira-server-317194938.html]:\r\n{noformat}\r\njira.index.issue.maxqueuesize=4000\r\njira.index.sharedentity.maxqueuesize=4000{noformat}\r\nTo be double sure, you can ensure that your instance does use the default value of {{jira.index.background.batch.size = 4000}}. You can check this on the [Advanced Settings|https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiraserver/configuring-advanced-settings-938847828.html] page (requires Jira System Administrator rights).\r\n\r\nh3. September 2020 Update:\r\n\r\n_We are closely monitoring_\u00a0_JRASERVER-70327__,\u00a0and, as it is a complex issue, we\u2019ve decided to address it in parts. As a first step, we released a fix for_ _JRASERVER-65457_ _that should should mitigate some of the problem. We will continue to closely follow the current ticket and will take further steps based on how it develops._",
