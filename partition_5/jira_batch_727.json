All solutions provided on the forums were workarounds and that Jira itself was not designed to support \"soft deletes\". \r\n\r\nWe feel that ticket information is very important.  Not only you lose the ticket and its history but also every work log entries of time tracking.  Since the data really belongs to us, the customer, we feel this is unacceptable.\r\n\r\nWe would appreciate if the Jira team corrects this design flaw and not closes it as done with similar issue: JRA-21831.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance,\r\nCustomer",

This is weird because you may create issues way in advance of including them into a release. This makes an inaccurate trend line which I believe is supposed to show an anticipated completion date for all issues in a release based on velocity. It only makes sense to measure progress from the start of the first sprint, rather than the oldest issue (Based on creation date) targeting a release",

Low: Information Disclosure CVE-2014-0119\r\n\r\nIn limited circumstances it was possible for a malicious web application to replace the XML parsers used by Tomcat to process XSLTs for the default servlet, JSP documents, tag library descriptors (TLDs) and tag plugin configuration files. The injected XML parser(s) could then bypass the limits imposed on XML external entities and/or have visibility of the XML files processed for other web applications deployed on the same Tomcat instance.\r\n\r\nh5. Important: Denial of Service CVE-2014-0075\r\n\r\nIt was possible to craft a malformed chunk size as part of a chucked request that enabled an unlimited amount of data to be streamed to the server, bypassing the various size limits enforced on a request. This enabled a denial of service attack.\r\n\r\nh5. Important: Information disclosure CVE-2014-0096\r\n\r\nThe default servlet allows web applications to define (at multiple levels) an XSLT to be used to format a directory listing. When running under a security manager, the processing of these was not subject to the same constraints as the web application. This enabled a malicious web application to bypass the file access constraints imposed by the security manager via the use of external XML entities.\r\n\r\nh5. Important: Information disclosure CVE-2014-0099\r\n\r\nThe code used to parse the request content length header did not check for overflow in the result. This exposed a request smuggling vulnerability when Tomcat was located behind a reverse proxy that correctly processed the content length header.\r\n\r\nSee http://tomcat.apache.org/security-7.html#Apache_Tomcat_7.x_vulnerabilities for links to more detailed descriptions.\r\n",

Expected Behavior\r\nThe option list would be displayed showing the entire name of the options - the box width would depend on the size of the longest string option.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Behavior\r\nIf options have the same initial name (e.g. \"Client XXXXXXXXX - Operation XXX) users won't be able to differentiate one option from the other. If there are many options with the same name hovering all to find one is a painful process.",
