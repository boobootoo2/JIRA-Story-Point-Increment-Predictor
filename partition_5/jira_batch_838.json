      "description": "APPLICATION INFO\r\n\r\nJira 4.3.4 Standalone\r\nJDK 1.6.0_24\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION\r\n\r\nJira's quick search navigation (when you key in the exact project issue and it brings you to the issue) just brings you to the general search page instead of the actual issue.\r\n\r\nFor example, you can key in VOC-3 in quick search, it takes you right to that issue.\r\nHowever, if you key in V4-99 it doesn't (given that both of these project keys and issues exist within the system).\r\n\r\nWe realized that we did not have the \"jira.projectkey.pattern\" set correctly to accept alphanumeric characters, so after we changed that, we rebooted tomcat. Aftering rebooting, the quick search navigation feature won't even work on any type of project key. So, in layman's terms, it's really broken now. \r\n\r\nREPRODUCE PROBLEM\r\n\r\n1. Before starting a Jira instance, edit the \"jira-application.properties\" file and change the \"jira.projectkey.pattern\" from \"([A-Z][A-Z]+)\" to \"([A-Z][A-Z0-9]+)\" - which allows alphanumeric project keys to be created.\r\n\r\nNOTE: Before moving on, please understand that step one above was performed in an earlier version of Jira, like version Jira 4.2.*. When we upgraded to Jira 4.3, we forgot to edit this attribute to include these alphanumeric characters. After we realized this, we shutdown Jira, changed this attribute to\"([A-Z][A-Z0-9]+)\" and restarted Jira. This is when Jira's \"quick search\" functionality quick working for ALL project key types.\r\n\r\n2. Start Jira and create a project with an alphanumeric project key. We have \"V8\" for our project key. Once you have the project created, create a few test issues.\r\n\r\n3. Shut down Jira and re-edit the \"jira.projectkey.pattern\" and revert it back to its original state \"([A-Z][A-Z]+)\". \r\n\r\n4. Start Jira back up and see if the quick search navigation works by keying in the exact issue key and number you created, and seeing if the quick search will bring you to that exact project issue, or if it will just bring you to the generic Jira search page. If it brings you to the generic Jira search page, you have successfully recreated the problem, if not, then the problem has not been successfully recreated.\r\n\r\n5. If your results above were successful in recreating the problem, shut down Jira again.\r\n\r\n6. Change the \"jira.projectkey.pattern\" back to it's edited format \"([A-Z][A-Z0-9]+)\". \r\n\r\n7. Restart Jira again, and perform the same search you did before, as well as a search on a project whose key is NOT ALPHANUMERIC - not containing any numbers in the project key. If the issue from the non-alphanumeric project will not display directly from keying it in on the quicksearch, you have completely successfully recreated the problem.\r\n",

The \"add\" response is that i am no longer logged in. after i log back in, the text is gone! suggestions are 1) retain the text after log-in. i dont mind logging back in, but its a hassle to retype the text. 2) pop the log-in dialog not on the \"add\" event, but on the js event that opens the text entry box. 3) alter the GUI in some way when time-out occurs to alert the user that they are no longer logged in ",

Oh, I'm sorry, workflow transitions don't have _permissions_, they have _conditions_. I guess that's why no one thought to include them in the Permission Scheme?\r\n\r\nAnyhow, adding these \"conditions\" to each transition of each of our 22 workflows would be a mammoth task, and I shouldn't be setting these permissions there, anyhow. I should be setting them in the Permission Scheme, where I have also specified who can comment on an issue, and log work on an issue.\r\n\r\nAnother solution would be to infer who is allowed to transition issues. If someone isn't allowed to comment on an issue, why on earth would I want to allow them to resolve it??",

Ideally, jira-application.properties should contain two separate properties to add the prefix for cloning issues: one is for main ticket and the other is for subtasks.

You are able to do this in a JIRA 4 dashboard with filter list gadgets, roadmap gadgets, but to many i've talked to, the jira 3 summary page was more useful.  This is because this page is teh default landing point for clicking a fix version link,  I've ported the jira 3 version summary panel to JIRA 4 and added quick links to the green-hopper task and planning boards, version admin page, etc -  But i'd rather be able to configure that frequently trafficked view like we do with dashboards.

      "description": "h4. Introduction\r\nJIRA Charting Plugin comes with Average Time in Status chart and gadget which is purposed to illustrate the average time spent on certain status.\r\n\r\nWhat many people expect is that the date/time an issue will fall under is the date/time that the desired status have taken place in. However, the current behavior is that the date/time an issue will fall under is actually the date/time of when the issue was resolved in.\r\n\r\nh4. Usage scenarios explaining the problem:\r\nImagine a user who wants to know the average time which issues have been in Open status. Imagine that the chosen filter returns 2 issues only (for simplicity):\r\n* Issue A which has been Open in May 2011 and *resolved in May 2011, \r\n* and Issue B which has been Open in May 2011 and *resolved in June* 2011. That will cause the graph to put Issue A Open time under May 2011 and Issue B Open time under June 2011, which is not what many people would expect.\r\n\r\nIf this is the expected behavior, I would suggest that we update our documentation [here|http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Displaying+Search+Results+as+a+Chart] and [here|https://studio.plugins.atlassian.com/wiki/display/JCHART/JIRA+Charting+Plugin] to be more specific in describing this chart to avoid confusions.\r\n\r\nThank you very much.\r\n\r\nAli\r\nAtlassian Support",

I make the assumption this has to do with the fact that all (>1200) versions are retreived, every time one action (release, archive, unarchive, edit, delete) is done. Moreover, on the project overview screen, just the top 15 version are shown as read-only, and a seperate link to view them all.\r\n\r\nThe solution I propose is simple; just adding an option (Boolaan, checkbox) on the Jira Version Management screen, someting like 'Show archived versions' (default on No).When this option is No (false), the Archived versions are not retreived after every action, and not (default) shown on the Version Management page. I expect this will largely increase the performance of this functionality.\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\nHans Brouwer\r\nTriodos Bank NV \r\nNetherlands",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-24776].\n  {panel}\n\nHello all,\r\nI would like to implement a JIRA project for test management purposes, using 2 different issue types, \"Test Plan\" and \"Test Case\".\r\n\r\nOne \"Test Plan\" can have more than one \"Test Case\"\r\nOne \"Test Case\" can relate to more than one \"Test Plan\" (or if you want \"Test Case\"'s can be shared among \"Test Plan\"'s\r\nEach \"Test Plan\" should aggregate time estimates for all the \"Test Case\"'s associated to it\r\nThings I have already tried:\r\n\r\nCreate \"Test Plan\" and \"Test Case\" issue types; Link \"Test Case\"'s to the relevant \"Test Plan\"'s. OUTCOME: Works fine for sharing \"Case\"'s among \"Plan\"'s but does not aggregate time estimates\r\nCreate \"Test Plan\" as issue types and \"Test Case\"'s as sub-task of a plan. OUTCOME: Works fine for calculating overall \"Test Plan\"'s estimates but does not allow sharing of \"Test Case\"'s sub tasks among \"Test Plans\"\r\nUse Structure to organize the hierarchical model. OUTCOME: Works well for calculating overall estimates by aggregating estimates of each child \"Test Case\" but does not allow sharing of \"Test Case\"'s among Test Plan (once a \"Test Case\" is inserted in the structure under a plan, it is not available any more to be added under a second plan)\r\n\r\nWhen I submitted my issue to JIRA support (https://support.atlassian.com/browse/JSP-81631) I was told that this is unattainable at present but that I should request a new feature to make it possible to share a sub-task (in the example above a Test Case) among more than one parent task (in the example above a Test Plan) and still get the parent issue Test Plan estimates to aggregate the estimates of all the sub-tasks associated to it.\r\n\r\nThanks a million in advance,\r\n\r\nMarco",

It appears that JIRA is relying on the logic in the AssigneeSystemField to handle population of the correct default values, which is fine if the values are coming from the web UI -- but makes no sense when directly interacting with the IssueService.  This is the type of logic that should be encapsulated in the IssueService so you don't have to worry about manually applying extra business rules during issue creation.",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-24738].\n  {panel}\n\nI would like to add another voice to JRA-1528, JRA-24374, JRA-14337, and I think even BAM-3101: I would like to be able to choose a notification scheme that is automatically assigned to new projects in place of \"None.\"  It's easy to miss and then notifications don't work.\r\n\r\nI understand that it could lead to notifications that aren't expected, but the user can choose to change the project to \"None\" at creation or in the future to avoid that - to my mind missing notifications when they're needed is a bigger danger than getting notifications when they aren't.\r\n\r\nThank you.",

      "description": "We have Jira set up with a large number of projects with a small number of issues. Because of this, we have a lot of information in the project description that we frequently need to access. It doesn't appear that the quick search includes general product information in its searches, which greatly slows down the process of finding what we need. Essentially the only workaround I've found is to display the full project list and use the browser's search to find the name I want.\r\n\r\nFor example, if we have a contact name and phone number in the project description and we search for the contact name, no results are found. It appears it partially searches the project key - if I have a project with a key of MYNAME that has at least one issue, a search for \"MYNAME\" will turn up the issues, while a search for \"NAME\" won't.\r\n\r\nI would like the quick search to include the general project information.\r\n\r\nThank you.",
