Over this time, components (and their default assignees) have changed substantially from what existed in prior versions, making the list of components increasingly stagnant and useless.  Some degree of separation between major versions is essential yet it would still be nice to be able to apply an issue to more than one major version, while listing the components affected in each major version (which may differ somewhat between major versions).\r\n\r\nThe only solution we have is to create a new project for every major version, but this has many downsides.\r\n\r\nWhat would work much better is to have a new field \"Major Version\" which defines a separate category of components and versions.  In other words, each major version (\"6.x\", \"7.x\", etc.) would contain a version set (\"6.1.0\", \"6.1.1\", etc.) as well as its own set of components.\r\n\r\nPlease give this issue some consideration - I know that this type of issue has been raised before (in a different form e.g. subcomponents) but hopefully this solution is somewhat more viable.",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-24132].\n  {panel}\n\nHi Guys,\r\n\r\nHopefully you can help with this issue I have relating to permissions \r\n\r\nLet me just give you a brief background to our system setup, we are using JIRA internationally for UK, FR, DE, AU and SG.  Each country has its own projects so as you can expect the list of projects is very long and quite scary for a normal user\r\n\r\nWhat we want to do is have the projects listed related to the country so only users in FR can see FR Projects, this is obviously very easily accomplished with a group and the browse projects permissions BUT what we want to do is to also allow users to see the project from the other country if they are CC'ed or assigned to any of the bugs\r\n\r\nScenario:\r\n\r\nFR bug opened by FR user in FR project\r\nFR project and bug is hidden to UK User\r\nFR user now adds the UK user as a CC\r\nUK user can now see the relevant FR project for the bug they have been CC'ed on\r\n\r\nAt the moment if you add in \"Current Assignee\" + \"Custom Field (CC)\" into the browse permission the user cannot see the bugs themselves (unless they are the assignee or CC) BUT they see the project listed which it shouldn't be\r\n\r\nAny way around this?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance,\r\n\r\nJoe",

Cause\r\n\r\nThere is a known bug with MySQL related to MyISAM, the UTF8 character set and indexes:\r\n\r\n* [http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=4541]\r\n\r\nh4.Resolution\r\nThe resolution steps are different for new installation and for existing installations with data.\r\n\r\nh5. Resolution for a New Installation\r\n\r\nIn this case we need to configure JIRA to use InnoDB before any of its tables are created.\r\n\r\n# Before starting the application installation (i.e. none of JIRA's tables can already be created), ensure that you have followed the instructions provided in [Connecting JIRA to MySQL|http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Connecting+JIRA+to+MySQL#ConnectingJIRAtoMySQL-configuringmysql].\r\n# Ensure that the *InnoDB* Dialect is installed on your MySQL server.\r\n# Change the storage engine used by JIRA so that new tables will always be created under InnoDB. There are two main ways of doing this:\r\n** *Option 1*: Change MySQL settings*: Set the [default-storage-engine|http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/storage-engine-setting.html] to InnoDB and restart MySQL. This makes InnoDB the default engine for all new tables on your MySQL instance. This could affect other applications using your MySQL instance.\r\n** *Option2*: Change connection URL used for JIRA*: You can configure JIRA to use InnoDB by default by adding {{sessionVariables=storage_engine=InnoDB}} to your JDBC URL in the {{[$JIRA_HOME|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/JIRA+Home+Directory]/dbconfig.xml}} file. This change will be isolated to JIRA. The location of the JDBC URL has changed between JIRA [4.3.x|http://confluence.atlassian.com/x/VA0aDg#ConnectingJIRAtoMySQL-5.Configurethedatabaseconnectionmanually] and [4.4.x|http://confluence.atlassian.com/x/0QESCw#ConnectingJIRAtoMySQL-4.2ConnectingJIRAtoMySQLManually]. For example:\r\n{{jdbc:mysql://localhost/jiradb?useUnicode=true&amp;amp;characterEncoding=UTF8}} will be changed to  {{jdbc:mysql://localhost/jiradb?useUnicode=true&amp;amp;characterEncoding=UTF8&amp;amp;sessionVariables=storage_engine=InnoDB}}.\r\n# Install JIRA.\r\n\r\nh5. Resolution for existing JIRA installation having MyISAM tables with data\r\n\r\n*Option 1: Migrate the MyISAM tables in place*\r\n\r\n# Stop JIRA.\r\n# Take a backup of your database in case things go wrong.\r\n# Make sure that the *InnoDB* Dialect is installed on your MySQL server.\r\n# Change the storage engine used by JIRA so that new tables will always be created under InnoDB with the following, as from [these docs|http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/alter-table.html]:\r\n{code:SQL}\r\nALTER TABLE t1 ENGINE = InnoDB;\r\n{code}\r\n# Migrate all JIRA's current tables to InnoDB. For example, you can:\r\n** Run the following command to generate an SQL script that will migrate your tables from MyISAM to InnoDB: \r\n{noformat}\r\nmysql -NBe \"select concat('alter table ',  TABLE_NAME, ' engine = InnoDB;') from INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES where TABLE_SCHEMA = '<database>' and engine = 'MyISAM'\" -u <user> -p <database>\r\n{noformat}\r\nIn this command {{<database>}} is the name of your database and {{<user>}} is a user who can access {{<database>}}.\r\n** Check to generated script to ensure that it does not do anything you don't expect.\r\n** Run the generated script. This can take some time.\r\n# Restart JIRA.\r\n\r\n*Option 2: Perform a JIRA backup and restore*\r\n\r\nThis will require taking an XML backup of JIRA and restoring it to a new database.\r\n\r\n# Take an XML backup of JIRA.\r\n# Stop JIRA.\r\n# Make sure that the *InnoDB* Dialect is installed on your MySQL server.\r\n# Change the storage engine used by JIRA so that new tables will always be created under InnoDB with the following, as from [these docs|http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/alter-table.html]:\r\n{code:SQL}\r\nALTER TABLE t1 ENGINE = InnoDB;\r\n{code}\r\n# Create a new database for JIRA.\r\n# Configure JIRA to connect to the new database.\r\n# Start JIRA.\r\n# Restore the backup you took earlier.",

This request is already addressed and our Cloud customers can benefit from it even today. For the JIRA Server customers: the feature will be delivered in the upcoming release of JIRA, which is going to be available really really soon. \r\n \r\nWith that said, thank you all for for your patience and continued support and voting for this feature request. More enhancements to JIRA are coming soon.\r\n \r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nBartek\r\nJIRA Product Management\r\nbartek (at) atlassian (dot) com\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\n*Original request description*\r\n \r\nWhen I have queried for a list of issues, I'd like to be able to use the bulk edit abilities to add a label to some/all of the issues.

Let's say the backup failed due to invalid paths, on my machine, it took over 10 minutes for JIRA to return me this error.  So I'm shown a screen saying the restore failed, and I clicked the retry link to restore using the default paths.  It took me to the websudo login screen, and I had to login to websudo again, it then took me to the screen asking if I wanted to retry the last action.  This is weird, I just clicked retry, entered my password, and now I'm being asked to retry again?  So now I get stuck on this retry screen for half an hour waiting for my backup to be done, not being sure if I've done the right thing, or if I should go back to the backup screen and try again.\n\nThis wouldn't be an issue if the websudo filter updated the last accessed timestamp on the way out, rather than on the way in.",
