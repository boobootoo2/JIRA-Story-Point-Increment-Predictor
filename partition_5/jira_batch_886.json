We are using the method of selecting the current step as the destination step for the action.  For example, we have a transition called \"Request an ES\" that triggers a custom field value change, but leaves the issue in the \"Accepted\" state.  I have to select the \"Accepted\" state as the destination step, which is not a onerous task, but it has an unfortunate side effect:  since I need to issue a notification for this event, the notification lists the status as changed, but shows it as changed to the same status. This is confusing for the recipients of the notifications.  Here is an example:\r\n\r\nJason Developer updated TESTXIC-22:\r\n-----------------------------------\r\n\r\n    QA Blocker Review Requested: Yes\r\n                         Status: Accepted  (was: Accepted)\r\n\r\nI am aware that I can go into the XML and use \"-1\" as the unconditional result step, but I cannot do this through the workflow editor, which means I have to go through the horrible process of changing the workflow scheme for all of my projects so I can import the new workflow from XML.
