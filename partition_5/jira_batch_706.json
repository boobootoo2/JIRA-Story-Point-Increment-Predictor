What I'm looking for is the ability to pre-define a comment as a post-function and then have this comment added to the ticket as it passes through the transition. I realize this is possible using scripts, but as an OnDemand user those options aren't open to me, and this _appears_ to be a pretty simple ask. It would be a bonus to be able to put in short codes with current_user, date\\time, etc.\r\n\r\nMy use-case:\r\nWe have a \"QA\" status during which our QA people do their thing, and either pass the ticket along or send it back to devs for more work. We prompt them for a comment either way, but if they're passing it the comment is almost always the same (\"Passed QA\").",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-41728].\n  {panel}\n\nProblem:\r\nSince we upgraded from JIRA 5.2 to 6.3.12 on 23.11.2014, we see that the work logged within JIRA (or Tempo in our case) is shown in the History tab of each issue. This was not the case in the older JIRA version.\r\nWe updated to JIRA 6.3.13 to get rid of the worklog emails, but 6.3.13 did not change the History tab problem.\r\n\r\nReason:\r\nFor us, it is important that Work Log entries  are only visible to concerned persons in the company. This typically are project leaders and accounting. All others should not see the worklog of others. It is OK and helpful to see ones own work logs.\r\n\r\nBackground:\r\nTempo does a good job in hiding work logs from others. It has permissions for time sheets that fit our needs. But at the JIRA level, this high appreciated level of privacy seems to get lost: Activity Streams show worklog entries, History Tabs show worklog entries. Both shall be hidden to users without permission to do so. We managed to hide Activity Streams (which was a long struggle and not all participants were lucky with the found solution).\r\n\r\nThis is also a legal issue: In Europe, personal data must be treated in a special way. This is enforced by national and european laws. As I understand it, the current behaviour of JIRA is not conform to European law, because work logs can be seen by people that are not involved with processing this data.\r\n\r\nExpected Solution:\r\nThe worklog entries should be removed from the history tab for users that do not have the required permission for this. \"Issue View\" permission is not the right permission to use as well as \"Edit All Worklogs\". A \"View All Worklogs\" permission (vs. \"View Own Worklogs\") would be fine.",
