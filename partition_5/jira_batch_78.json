The script would show a dialog with a text box and then call the actual command.\r\n\r\nI think none of these solutions are ideal. Creating scripts for every command that need extra arguments is cumbersome. Showing a single input box and putting the value into a single variable makes the user deal with the command line options, which is exactly what I'm trying to avoid.\r\n\r\nI wish I could specify the number of non-trivial arguments needed and a message to prompt the user for each argument. Variables could be named $1, ... , $N (the name doesn't matter).",

This happens continuously.\r\n\r\nTo resolve this, I uninstalled SourceTree (v1.6.3) and reinstalled the older v1.5.2 version. Now it too crashes constantly - within 30 seconds of opening the application. I have rebooted which did not help. I have tried closing all my open git repos, it still crashes. No other changes were made to my computer in the past 24 hours except for installing SourceTree v1.6.3.\r\n\r\nIs there any error logging, any debug option/etc I can enable to try to resolve this issue?

Now, I think we can achieve doing a multiple select, then right-click and press \"Add\" action. However, this is more confusing.\r\n\r\nThe other approach to do that would be to review each unstaged file, one by one, and then stage explicitly as we go. Before 1.6, I would just enable the checkbox for each file I want to stage, and sometime later press \"stage selected\".

In the main window select \"Uncommitted changes\"\r\n2. just click ellipsis on a file that is deleted locally but not in the stage.\r\nIt crashes\r\n\r\nWhen no uncommitted changes (or may be all changes are staged - didn't try), this is not reproduced.\r\n\r\nPlease, help how to restore the previous version?\r\nThanks! \r\n\r\nP.S.
