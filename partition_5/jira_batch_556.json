Ideally an issue reported from customer is handled by operators who create the issue in tool. They transfer this issue to support team. \n\nSupport team has different levels *L1*, *L2* and *L3*. Life cycle starts with L1 support team and they can do some analysis, task retries, add more information and pass to next level (if the issue is not solved). Next level support team has more access to production environment and they can do changes to database/files for fixing the problem. \n\nSimilar to first level, second level team also adds more information and pass to next level. Third level deals with program fixes. They correct programs and redeploy it in different environments. We have different SLAs for these support levels based on the priority of issue\n{quote}",

Use case\nWe have deployed JIRA Service Desk and we have three queues created such as:\nLevel 1 Global, Level 2 Global and Level 3 Global, our IT Staff are located in each country around the world and we would like an additional queue called Level 2 Local Support.\nUse Case,\nA London based IT staff has picked up an issue from the Level 1 Global queue and discovered a Jordan based IT staff would need to visit the user in person, the London based IT staff would reassign to Level 2 Local Support.\nTherefore rather than creating a queue per country, we would like the currentuser() logged in to view tickets in the Level 2 Local queue tagged with his/her country parameter.\n\nh4. Example\nThe JQL query must compare issues custom fields values against the users parameters i.e. country.\nFor Example, if a user named John Smith located at Nigeria logged into to the Local Queue, he should only see issues where location of the reporter is equal to the same country Parameter as the user i.e. Nigeria.\nThe same applies for others users located in Jordan, only showing issues logged by Jordan users based on the Current Users parameters.",

Here are the steps:\n\n* Customer goes to the login screen.\n* Customer clicks on \"Forgot Password\"\n* Customer enters their username.\n* Customer receives the email with the rest link.\n* Customer clicks the link and goes to the reset password page.\n* Customer enters in password, hits submit.\n\nNormally, a user is then redirected to the login page. However, our client users (which have much more limited permissions) just see the password reset page refresh. If they know enough to go to the login page, the new password submission does work. However, to the end user, it appears that nothing happened and they click the submit button a second time. This throws an error \"The reset password token you have provided has timed out\".\n\nWe believe this is a bug, but it could be a simple matter of fixing a permission. Still, we would expect (given the password does reset) that the redirect should proceed.",

The annoying thing is, if I select a report for the past 7 days and run the report at say ... 10:00 AM, the date filter includes records for the past 6x24 hours. There are two things wrong with this:\n\n1- There appears to be names of 7 days shown on the report but there are actually 6 days on the report (6x24) The first and last days are incomplete. The rest of \"today\" is not lived yet and more importantly the \"first day\" only includes tickets after 10:00 AM of that day. This is not obvious for the customers, they expect full days.\n2 - As time passes through the day, I cannot have the same report again. Every minute passing changes my report from the starting point, filtering tickets according to a moving point in the middle of the day, so my reports are inconsistent.\n\nThe reports should allow me to set beginning and ending dates of reports and more importantly reports must contain full 24 hours for any day shown on report.",

We just tried the workaround mentioned in the below article by taking a backup of existing AoD instances and restoring into a standalone version. However we got stuck in the fourth step as we do not have Jira system administrator global permission to work with project import tool.\nhttps://confluence.atlassian.com/display/ONDEMANDKB/How+to+Merge+Two+JIRA+OnDemand+Instances\n\nWould like to know how to overcome this issue mentioned step 4 and proceed with step 5. Any help / thoughts around this topic will really help. Thanks.\n\n",
