More information on this [KB|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRAKB/Perforce+password+%28P4PASSWD%29+invalid+or+unset+on+JIRA+Fisheye+plugin].\r\n\r\n*Suggested resolution*\r\n\r\nJIRA should provide more ways (on the screen) to allow this authentication.",

So if you have implemented a local/intranet Gravatar compatible endpoint as we have, you can point Fisheye/Crucible at that to get avatars.\r\n\r\nHowever the Gravatar support in JIRA is hard coded. All I would like is the ability to customize the Gravatar URL which is used so I can point it at our local Gravatar service and have one source for avatar pictures across our Atlassian setup.\r\n\r\nI don't mind if this is something which needs to be configured via application properties (this is how Stash works)",

      "description": "The components list doesn't show all the available options to the users anymore.  Instead there is this thing on the bottom saying \"x more options, continue typing...\" and that line can't even be clicked on to show more options.  This is a very big problem for our users as they do not memorize all the options.  Also, this is a pre-defined list of available options that need to be selected correctly.  How is the user supposed to automatically know what all the options are?\r\n\r\nThis change was not listed in any release notes that i have found, and therefore i am creating this as a bug since it is not working as it once was prior to our upgrade.\r\n\r\nTo clarify, in the previous version we were running (5.2.6), it would say the \"x more options.  Continue typing to refine further\" message after you have started typing in the box.  However, now that shows up even if you just click the drop down and not type anything.  This doesn't make sense since i have not typed anything, so how can i continue typing.  In 5.2.6 it would still show the entire list if you didn't type anything yet.  That behavior is great and works perfect, please fix this bug so that you see the whole list if you have not started typing anything in the components box (Autocomplete renderer field).",
