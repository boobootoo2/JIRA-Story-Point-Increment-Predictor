Summary\r\n\r\nIn Jira Data Center during cache replication value of ehcache.listener.socketTimeoutMillis from clustered.properties (or a default value) should be used as read timeout for remote RMI calls to other nodes in cluster. Instead an infinity is used. Problems with communication with one node can bring entire cluster down.\r\nh3. Environment\r\n * JIRA datacenter with multiple nodes\r\n*Node A*\u00a0is unresponsive because of extremely high load or high memory pressure or any other condition that makes it unresponsive. However, at this state node is not technically down and still registered as an 'Active' member in\u00a0the cluster but not processing request either.\r\n*Node B*\u00a0still consider node\u00a0*A*\u00a0as 'Active' so it keeps performing cache synchronisation to Node A which not responding to the request and put Node B in stale position.\u00a0\r\n\r\nh3. Symptoms\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\nh3. Expected behaviour\r\nTCP and RMI handshakes will throw an exception after the specified timeout has passed.  \r\n\r\nh3. Workarounds\r\nRestart or gracefully shutdown the unresponsive node.\r\n\r\nh3.

This server runs Apache, various monitoring systems, and two JIRA application instances:\r\n\r\n ** Our [public site|https://jira.atlassian.com/] has approximately: 145,000 issues, 255,000 comments, 120 custom fields, and 115 projects. \r\n\r\n ** Our [support|https://support.atlassian.com/] site has approximately: 285,000 issues, 2,500,000 comments, 75 custom fields, and 22 projects.\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nThe values and numbers mentioned here are wildly off what we use in regards to Sizing estimates for customers such as in [JIRA Sizing Guide - Atlassian Documentation|https://confluence.atlassian.com/enterprise/jira-sizing-guide-461504623.html].\r\nThe major points I'd like to see addressed are \r\n# the phrase \"with 2GB of available RAM\".   The Server itself should just about always have 8GB of dedicated system memory, and Jira's JVM should typically have at least 1GB of xmx assigned to it, even for the smallest installations.     \r\n# Creating 100 projects creates a lot more overhead than this guide implies.  That's because each created project can create new workflows, new custom fields, new permissions schemes, new screens, etc.   \r\n# Also the information in regards to JAC and SAC/GSAC is no longer current and accurate.   I know GSAC is using datacenter deployment now.    I understand if this change might require a separate ticket, but it would be great if we can keep these updated to reflect our current use.",

Notes\r\nOur findings to date:\r\n* the menu initially loads with 0px width \r\n* JavaScript should set the width to auto \r\n* In case we don't see the menu, the value of width is not set to auto, and after manually setting it appears. We believe the JavaScript is not executed.\r\n* The menu can load broken even if we see no errors in the console, so nothing obvious breaks it,\r\n*  Both our javascript and dev tools use mutation observers and it's impossible to debug\r\n* So far we only have reports of this occurring in 7.2 and 7.3. A customer was not affected in 7.1 until they upgraded to 7.3\r\n\r\nh3.Workaround\r\nRefreshing the browser window resolves this temporarily. \r\n\r\nIf refreshing the browser window doesn't solve the issue, use the following announcement banner as a workaround. \r\n* Click on the *Cog icon* on the upper right corner in Jira, select *System*, Click on Go *Announcement Banner* on the left side, Enter *Edit Announcement Banner* page.\r\n* Paste the following script into the announcement banner page:\r\n{code:java}\r\n    \u201c<script type=\u201ctext/javascript\u201d>\r\njQuery(document).ready(function() {\r\ndocument.querySelector(\u201cdiv.aui-header-primary\u201d).querySelectorAll(\u201cul.aui-nav\u201d).forEach(function(e) { if(e.style.width == 0){ e.style.width = \u201cauto\u201d } })\r\nconsole.log(\u201cscript done\u201d)\r\n});\r\n</script>\u201d\r\n{code}",

      "description": "In Structure app, we need to closely monitor the Lucene index, especially in DC environment. The following suggestions are based on specific problems that we experienced and for which we had to invent complex and fragile workarounds.\r\n\r\n # It is important to have either _finish_ or _cancel_ event for each _start_ event. There is no such guarantee at the moment: {{ReindexAllCompletedEvent}}/{{ReindexAllCancelledEvent}} may be not fired at the end of reindexing.\r\n{code:java}\r\n// Jira 7.5.0 src: com.atlassian.jira.issue.index.reIndexAll() lines 328-330\r\n...\r\n} else if (!withReindexLock(() -> doStopTheWorldReindex(context, filterReindexAllIndexingParams))) {\r\nreturn -1;\r\n}\r\n...{code}\r\n # {{ReindexIssuesCompletedEvent}} does not have a list of the issues that were reindexed. It seems to be simple to implement. We need this in the Data Center environment because we need to know when we can safely run Lucene queries after an issue is changed on a different node.\r\n # It would be great to have project reindex events (started/completed/cancelled). Our app, as many other apps and Jira itself,\u00a0prefer to use index due to performance reasons. Project reindex process changes indices that can affect data calculation results in the app, so we have to handle this to clear caches. Currently the only way to know about project reindex is to find corresponting task in the task manager.\r\n # It is reasonable to expect that when you get an issue change event, the corresponding index has already been updated. The current implementation of\u00a0{{com.atlassian.jira.event.listeners.search.IssueIndexListener}}\u00a0is simply an\u00a0IssueEventListener implementation. It means that it can be called before or after any other listener. So some of the listeners will see the index updated while others will not. This is because event listeners are called according to their position in the issue event class hierarchy. I suggest to treat\u00a0{{IssueIndexListener}} as an exception and notify it first, before other liisteners.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\u00a0",
