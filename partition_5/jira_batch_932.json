In release 2.0.0 there are the engineers a, b, and c, while in release 2.1.0 engineers d, e and f.  What I would like to have the system allow this relationship definition.

      "description": "Jira needs sub-components, sub-projects, products, or suites.\r\n\r\nA product suite is composed of several projects.  A project can be included in multiple product suites.  A product suite has versions and each suite version is tied to specific versions of its contained projects.  For example Suite 5.2 might contain AppX 1.2, Core 10.4.1, and CoreUtils 9.3.1.\r\n\r\nI believe that the product category concept could be extended to behave more like a suite.  Add versions to categories, allow a project to be in multiple categories at once, and then allow linking of \"suite\" versions to specific project versions.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, just allowing n-level nesting of projects would do the trick and would eliminate the need for components altogether (as noted in JRA-846).\r\n",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-12211].\n  {panel}\n\nAs a manager, I'm storing certain organizational information in Jira in user groups. However, the group browser is available only to jira-administrators. I'd like to make the Group Browser available to a wider audience without having to make that audience members of jira-administrators. Is there a way to do that? I checked the configuration options from the GUI and couldn't find anything relevant.\r\n\r\nI don't see any security risk in allowing users to browse the group lists. In fact, there is value in this. We link Jira closely with our internal documentation, and we have designated specialties (e.g. Unix, Windows, Firewalls) that link to projects and components within Jira. It's incredibly useful for my staff to know who is in a group with them on a particular specialty. For example, \"I'm in the firewall group. Who else is in the group and who is the leader?\" We put that information into the groups within Jira. It would be nice to have hyperlinks from the documentation to Jira to display the group list, and that's what I was trying to do when I found this problem. So, the feature request would be to create a group browser and then have a general option in Jira as to which groups could use that browser. In my environment, I'd permission that to all jira-users. \r\n",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-12087].\n  {panel}\n\nh4. Improvement Requests\r\n* Include documentation identifying which RPC modules are required and which are optional\r\n* Include workaround steps for the problem that occured below\r\n\r\nh4.Scenario in which this would come in handy\r\nA developer within our company wanted to try and create an xml-rpc client into JIRA.  He then asked the JIRA administrator to enable the RPC plugin.   At the time we were using JIRA 3.6.1 Professional, and had the RPC plugin disabled.  It was decided that we would enable this plugin during an upgrade to JIRA 3.7.2 Professional.\r\n\r\nSo after upgrading to JIRA 3.7.2 Professional (with all of our data now imported), we decided to turn on _\"Accepting remote API Calls\"_ and enable the RPC plugin according to the instructions available at http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Creating+a+XML-RPC+Client.  Not knowing what each individual module did, we decided to _disable the admin service module_ and left everything else enabled.  Screenshot shown in instructions doesn't show this module either, so thought it would be ok.  Also thought that , if anything went wrong we could just disable the entire plugin again.  However, after restarting services the {color:red}JIRA UI is no longer available.{color}  \r\n\r\nTo get our system backup we ultimately had to restore ms sql server 2000 from a clean database.  Then when the system was up, re-import all our data (which was unfortunate, since this process is very long).  It would be nice to know what the workaround for this would be, since it seems it could be manually changed in the database.   \r\n\r\nh4.Additional Testing\r\nTested the same set of steps on the absolutely clean installation of JIRA 3.7.2.  Same issue is reproduced:\r\n# Install 3.7.2\r\n# Enable _\"Accepting remote API Calls\"_ and enable the RPC plugin \r\n# Disable Admin Service Module and leave all other modules enabled\r\n# Restart Jira services\r\n# Try connecting to http://localhost<port> : {color:red} UI no longer available{color}\r\n",
