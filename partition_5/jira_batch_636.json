The visual editor has caused frustration among my co-workers, as it encodes and displays literally text that we intended to be parsed as markdown or plug-in syntax (\\{task\\} for example). Unfortunately, the system defaults to Visual mode, and I can\u2019t find a way to set it to default as Text. I notice that the Atlassian JIRA (which seems to be running v7.3.0 sub-version 73011-sha1:3202aba:node1) defaults to Text. I also understand that previous versions only had Text mode with a Preview button, which seems like a much better solution because there\u2019s no chance of text transforming in unwanted ways when switching between what should be edit and preview modes.\r\n\r\nWe would like one or more of these options:\r\n* Turn off the visual editor and use the old editor with Preview button.\r\n* If the system has the visual editor enabled, choose whether to display text or visual mode by default.\r\n\r\nThese should be configurable by each user.

Users drag the cards from left to right during that progression. For an organization that has multiple \"done\" statuses (DONE, REJECTED / WON'T FIX, DUPLICATE, etc), all of those statuses appear in the \"Done\" column as you drag a card into that last status. The column is then divided into equal parts, vertically, with all of the available DONE statuses. The user is supposed to drag into the right DONE area for that story.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe main problem with this approach is that most of the time, we really want to mark a story as Done or Completed. We almost never drag one into rejected, dup, etc. However, as testers are rushing to get through work at the end of a sprint, very often they drag a story into the wrong done status. This creates confusion and additional overhead on checking in with the team to confirm they meant DONE not REJECTED, etc. I find this to be one of the most irritating UX aspects to the cardwall.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n*SUGGESTION*\r\n\r\nMake dragging a story into the final \"done\" column easier to mark \"DONE\" instead of the myriad other statuses that share this visual space.",

It would be nice if the list possibilities would be populated by versions which contained the input string in any part of the version. This behavior would be similar to how Bitbucket Server is able to populate a drop down list of branches matching the input text to any part of the branch name.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\nSay I have fix versions \"hello1\", \"hello2\", and \"hello3\" in my project. If I type \"1\" into the fix version field in an issue, currently the list possibilities will be empty and will only suggest that I can make a new fix version called \"1\". The desired behavior would be that the list possibilities contain \"hello1\" because the string \"1\" is contained in that fix version. \r\n\r\nThe lack of more powerful searching in this drop down becomes a problem when a project has many versions, the version strings are long, and the characters that differentiate the versions are found at the end of a whole word so many characters must be typed before the desired version shows up as one of the top results in the drop down list.",

Root cause\r\n\r\nEhcache in JIRA DC is not informed about node being removed from the cluster. As a result for about 5 minutes all nodes in the cluster will try to invalidate cache on not existing host. Resolving host name that is not existing is much slower than for existing host, this is why this problem is occurring.\r\n\r\nIn order to prevent this from happening first shut down JIRA, wait 5-10 minutes and then terminate the host itself.\r\nh3. Notes\r\n * Issue is reproducible when the node is removed by ASG or removed/terminated manually.\r\n * This not only affects AWS but also generic Data Center environments when host DNS name becomes unavailable.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nFor AWS, do not use Auto Scaling Group by configuring the Minimum number of cluster nodes *identical* to the Maximum number of cluster nodes.",

Summary\r\n\r\nWhen using text effects in the middle of a word (like aaa{*}bbb{*}ccc) from the toolbar, the word is not marked up correctly.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to Non-English languages like Japanese, one sentence is composed *without* space character (as if it is a word) in general.\r\n\r\ne.g.) The following sentences have the same meanings.\r\n* English : I'm working for Atlassian. (There are some space character in the sentence)\r\n* Japanese : \u79c1\u306f\u3001\u30a2\u30c8\u30e9\u30b7\u30a2\u30f3\u3067\u50cd\u3044\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002(There are no space character in the sentence)\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to the Japanese one, If you want to make the word \"\u30a2\u30c8\u30e9\u30b7\u30a2\u30f3\" bold, we need to use text effects in the middle of the word (I meant the sentence *without* space character).\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Open an issue\r\n# Open the editor in the description field (comment field is also fine)\r\n# Type \"aaabbbccc\" in the editor\r\n# Try to make the part \"bbb\" of the word bold from the toolbar\r\n# The word \"aaabbbccc\" is marked up as \"aaa*bbb*ccc\"\r\n# Preview the description field (or comment field)\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nFor now, we can escape the special characters which are used for the text effects with \"{}\".\r\nThen, the word \"aaabbbccc\" should be marked up as \"aaa\\{\\*\\}bbb\\{\\*\\}ccc\". (It was shown as \"aaa{*}bbb{*}ccc\".)\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nAs I described in the above, the word was converted to \"aaa*bbb*ccc\" and there was no text effect on the word. (It was shown as \"aaa*bbb*ccc\".)\r\n\r\nh3.Workaround\r\n\r\nJust type the mark up manually.",

Whatever may be the case be it OAUTH or SSO or simply the new MVW architecture you need to have application bundles that deal with proxies. In the recent work in the upgrades we see two things: 1) MVW used is incompatible with older browsers, high demands for browser upgrades are hard in enterprise environments - internal components should avoid communicating with REST though that is the new world standard it is simply not feasible  2) Proxy.. there will be a chain of proxies in an enterprise environment .. u simply have to build applications that deal with it. \r\n\r\nKISS (keep it simple) works wonderful .. Microsoft has been doing it for years and has grown to be a better choice in today computing environment",

      "description": "h2. Summary\r\nThere is a scenario where JIRA during start up detects that there is a gap between the issues in the database and the indexed issues (lucene's indexes), if that gap is lower than 24 hours the start up thread starts a a single-threaded reindex (Recover Issue Index) blocking any other threads and hence making the reindex slower and blocking any users connections to JIRA.\r\nIt is important to note that this process only happens during the start up.\r\n\r\n\r\nh2. Environment\r\nI reproduced it in version 6.4.13 as well as version 7.2.\r\n\r\n\r\nh2. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Start up JIRA\r\n# Mark log file \"Recover Issue Index Test Start\"\r\n# Create a new project\r\n# Insert 1000 issues to the new project\r\n# Goto System>>Advanced>>Indexing>>Index Recovery and enable it\r\n# Create a new backup for the indexes\r\n# Insert 10000 new issues (please note it can be less than 10000, I used 10000 issues as it gave me more time to probe that blocks any other sessions)\r\n# Stop JIRA\r\n# Goto JIRA_HOME/caches/indexes and copy all directories to a temp directory so you have a backup\r\n# Delete all the directories in  JIRA_HOME/caches/indexes\r\n# Copy the backup generated in step 6 from JIRA_HOME/export/indexsnapshots/ and unzip it to JIRA_HOME/caches/indexes\r\n# Start up JIRA\r\n# Mark log file \"Recover Issue Index Test 2 End\"\r\n# Check the log files\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nh2. Expected Results\r\n\r\nIf the start up thread kicks off a reindex and blocks any other users I would expect the process to be multi-threaded.  Ideally, the customer would be able to configure what type of reindex process they would like to have in this situation by choosing either a background reindex (single threaded and nonblocking) or foreground re-index (multi-threaded, but blocking) using a property.  I have created a separate feature request for this.\r\n\r\nh2. Actual Results\r\nThe start up thread kicks off a reindex process that blocks any other threads and is single-threaded.\r\n\r\n\r\nh2.Workaround\r\nThere is no workaround.\r\n\r\n\r\nh2.

For some reason, the password is expired but Jira APIs still let users log in. When query for issues or any other calls, error 500 is returned.\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\nIt should return a better error code, such as 401 (Authentication error).\r\n\r\nh3. Why this is important\r\nWith the correct error code, it makes us easier to identify the root so we can fix it quicker instead wasting time on investigating the wrong area.",

Originall report is [https://ecosystem.atlassian.net/browse/DEVHELP-376]\r\n\r\n\u00a0We are relying on the Velocity rendering facilities in JIRA. I guess a tons of other add-on does it, too, so this bug may affect many.\r\nFor that, we let the framework to inject VelocityManager into our service tier. We received a DefaultVelocityManager implementation class, on which we invoke the following method:\r\n{code}\r\nvoid writeEncodedBodyForContent(Writer writer, String contentFragment, Context context)\r\n{code}\r\nIt has been working perfectly for ~6 years, but recently (starting from JIRA 7.0 or 7.1) we randomly receive a rendered string that has unrendered Velocity macros. The #foreach() and #if() directives are processed, but the macro appear in their original form in the output.\r\nThis is nearly impossible to reproduce manually, but it was reported multiple times by users running large JIRA instance.\r\nOur investigation found to this issue: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/VELOCITY-776\r\nWe figured out that macros are cached to the one namespace used by multiple threads. If one of the thread decides to flush the cache, the macros are gone for the other threads, too. We wrote a Python script that triggers our rendering and the JIRA web interface simultaneously (also using Velocity), and the bug consistently appears.\r\nThe root cause\r\nThe writeEncodedBodyForContent() is using a single logTag (that acts as a sort of namespace for macros) for all threads!!!\r\nIt may be useful for most, but leads to bugs for others.\r\nSee:\r\n{code}\r\ntry\r\n{\r\ngetVe().evaluate(context, writer, \"getEncodedBodyFromContent\", contentFragment);\r\n}\r\n{code}\r\nWe should be able to pass our own logTag, to avoid namespace collisions.\r\nOur workaround\r\nWe copied the implementation of this method, hacked a Reflection based method to retrieve the \"ve\" instance, and we are now using our own namespace.\r\nThe problem disappeared.",
