For example, if the field is multi-text then Enter key means new line, while if if it is a single-text field then it will submit the form. Similarly with single select list field Enter key means opening the drop down list, however with Label field it will submit the form. If the cursor is in the number field then it will submit the form same like in user picker.\r\n\r\nSince the behaviour of the key always changing depending on the field type, we are concerned that users will find it too confusing since they could inadvertently submit the form while trying to do something else. To make it more consistent can we take away the functionality to submit the form when pressing 'Enter' key in Edit/Transition screen?",

I personally watched this & also saw the Linked Issues field with \"is contained by\" & \"A-1\" there. I also saw in the Activity tab of A-1 where the user created the link. After a couple of hours the user went back to B-1 & the Linked Issues field was missing. The field was also missing on A-1, however on A-1 you can still see the link in the Activity tab.\r\n2) While creating issue B-2 _I believe_ I also included a link to A-2 as \"is contained by\". Later I noticed that B-2 & A-2 weren't linked, so I created the link. After another couple of days I noticed that B-2 & A-2 weren't linked, so I created the link, but this time I remembered that I had already done this so I checked the Activity tab in B-2 and could see both of the times I linked these 2 tickets after creating B-2.\r\n\r\nNote: This doesn't happen with Project C or D, where C & D are structurally copies of B (set up the same, with same roles, permissions, issue types, & workflows).",

Instead of an arbitrary field that may or may not even be used, the reporter on the issue navigates to the \"Label\" field and types what they need. Instead of perusing the page for their 2-10 fields, they simply enter the 2-10 keywords into the \"Label\" field.\r\n\r\nIn the vein of ease of use, having labels that can be identical (only differentiating in capitalization) not appear within the same search/filter only complicates things. On top of this, user's often _think_ that they're adding the correct label, when in fact they are not inputting the label that will cause their issue to appear on the desired filter/board. This false sense of security then comes back to bite them later, and the user is (rightfully) very turned off from using the application for anything meaningful from that point forward. I've experienced that exact scenario (first hand, second, and third) at multiple companies leveraging JIRA.",

Expected Results\r\n\r\nThe gadget renders normally.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nThis depends how JIRA is being accessed, and also the configuration of any reverse-proxy and JIRA.\r\n\r\n* If directly (i.e.: no proxy is used), the HTTP request returns a 400 and the page rendering breaks - it appears blank.\r\n* If a proxy is being used, the proxy may return an error such as 'Request-URI Too Long' as per the attached screenshot.\r\n* Additionally if the proxy is being used, it's possible a 'Bad Request' may be displayed instead of the blank page if the proxy is configured to allow the large request however Tomcat is not.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nh5. Workaround1\r\nInclude the page from remote server.\r\n# Create html at remote server and save content\r\n# Include that page into gadget instead of whole html block, you can use *<iframe>* (or <object> or <embed>). Please see example below:\r\n{code:borderStyle=solid}\r\n<iframe src=\"http://127.0.0.1:8080/inc.html\" seamless=\"true\" style=\"width: 100%;height: 100%;\"></iframe>\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nh5. Workaround2\r\nIncrease the limits. \r\n\r\nThe limit on the HTTP request needs to be addressed on anything between JIRA and the client that the traffic may go through - for example if using Apache, the limit must be increased in Apache and *also* in Tomcat (JIRA).\r\n\r\nh5. Apache\r\n# Edit the appropriate configuration file (this may be {{httpd.conf}}, it depends how you've configured Apache).\r\n# Increase the [LimitRequestLine|http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/core.html#limitrequestline] to something larger, for example {{16380}}.\r\n# Reload or restart Apache.\r\n\r\nAn example of this is below:\r\n{code}\r\n<VirtualHost *:80>\r\n    ServerAdmin captain-planet@example.com\r\n    ServerName orion-pax.example.com\r\n    ErrorLog \"/usr/local/var/log/apache2/orion-pax.office.com-error_log\"\r\n    CustomLog \"/usr/local/var/log/apache2/orion-pax.office.com-access_log\" common\r\n\r\n    ProxyRequests Off\r\n    ProxyPass \t\t/\tajp://localhost:8009/\r\n    ProxyPassReverse\t/\tajp://localhost:8009/\r\n    \r\n    LimitRequestLine  16380\r\n</VirtualHost>\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nh5. Tomcat\r\n\r\n# Stop JIRA.\r\n# Edit the {{server.xml}} to set the {{maxHttpHeaderSize}} to be larger in the appropriate Connector as per the example below:\r\n{code}\r\n        <Connector port=\"60641\" maxThreads=\"150\" minSpareThreads=\"25\" connectionTimeout=\"20000\" enableLookups=\"false\" maxHttpHeaderSize=\"32768\" protocol=\"HTTP/1.1\" useBodyEncodingForURI=\"true\" redirectPort=\"8443\" acceptCount=\"100\" disableUploadTimeout=\"true\"/>\r\n{code}\r\n# Restart JIRA.\r\n\r\n(!) We were not able to reliably workaround this problem using an AJP connector and a proxy. The attempted steps tried were:\r\n\r\n# Increase the {{packetSize}} in {{server.xml}} as per the below:\r\n{code}\r\n        <Connector port=\"8009\" redirectPort=\"8443\" enableLookups=\"false\" protocol=\"AJP/1.3\" URIEncoding=\"UTF-8\" packetSize=\"65536\"/>\r\n{code}\r\n# Restart JIRA.\r\n\r\nIt appears the Apache proxy was not able to handle the request - increasing the [ProxyIOBufferSize|http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_proxy.html#proxyiobuffersize] allowed this to work intermittently (in some cases all gadgets were returned blank), however was not reliable enough for a functional workaround.

Case 1 - Arrays (copied)\r\nMost of the standard custom fields that JIRA ships have meta data that says they are arrays with string values. That normally means you need to provide a JSON array of option ids. Cascade select is a odd case even though it reports the same schema but needs to be handled differently. It has historically been an odd case (wink).  \r\n\r\nThe trouble is for an arbitrary custom field that reports meta data as \"array\" and with items of \"string\" there doesn't seem to be a way to know the format or content of the data that is expected to set the value of the field. Am I missing something here? One would assume meta data would give you enough information to determine that, but it doesn't. Providing an array of values results in an error. How does one create a representation of data for an arbitrary custom field that represents itself as accepting array values but does not? Also, what indication is there that it needs option ids instead of regular strings? This seems like an omission from the metadata available.\r\n\r\nFor instance, the agile custom fields look like arrays, but don't accept array values:\r\n\r\nschema\": {\r\n\"type\": \"array\",\r\n\"items\": \"string\",\r\n\"custom\": \"com.pyxis.greenhopper.jira:gh-epic-link\",\r\n\"customId\": 11261\r\n}, \r\n\r\ncustomfield_11261\": \"ZAGILE-1\",\r\n\r\nh1. Case 2 - 3rd party custom fields\r\nHere is a Tempo field with the following metadata:\r\n{noformat}\r\n\"customfield_10600\":{\"required\":true,\"schema\":{\"type\":\"account\",\"custom\":\"com.tempoplugin.tempo-accounts:accounts.customfield\",\"customId\":10600},\"name\":\"Account\",\"hasDefaultValue\":false,\"operations\":[\"set\"]},\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nThis happens to be a numeric field. However, there is no indication of that in the metadata. \r\nWorse, an update using a string value gives \"not numeric\" error even though the string value is actually a numeric value. There doesn't appear to be a generic way to determine that a numeric is required. The only obvious way is magically knowing about this specific custom field requires a numeric entry. ",

      "description": "h3. Summary\r\n\r\nAs of Java 1.8u51+ (also 1.7.0_85+ and 1.6.0_101+) making SSL connections to an IP address is no longer allowed.  Previously the JVM would do a reverse lookup of the hostname using the IP then complete the connection using that hostname.  This was a security vulnerability because an attacker that gained control of DNS could route traffic to their own server.  This change is a security feature of Java.\r\n\r\nWe have found there is a problem with the way Java creates LDAPS connections.  The way Socket.createSocket() is used results in an SSLSocket without the hostname set in it.  This results in use of an IP address to make the connection and since this is no longer allowed the connection fails.  We have reported this problem to Oracle and also forwarded the information to the Java security dev list: http://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/security-dev/2015-September/012845.html .\r\n\r\nBecause of this _*existing LDAPS connections are broken*_ and users from that user directory are unable to login including non-local administrators.\r\n\r\nThis will affect any customer using secure LDAP that upgrades the JVM.  Secure LDAP is very common to protect passwords on the internal network, particularly in enterprise environments.  This is exacerbated by JIRA 6.4.11 which ships with 1.8u51.\r\n\r\nh3. Environment\r\n* Verified: JIRA 6.3+ using the noted Java versions.\r\n* Suspected: All versions of JIRA using a noted Java version.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Configure a user directory using a secure LDAP connection\r\n# Upgrade the JDK to a noted Java version.\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nLogins and LDAP syncs should work as normal.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nUsers will be unable to authenticate and LDAP syncs will fail.\r\n\r\nErrors like this will occur in the logs: {code:borderStyle=solid}\r\n2015-07-22 12:43:05,896 WARN  [http-bio-443-exec-1] @1SDVDDx763x1x0 XXXXX \"POST /j_stash_security_check HTTP/1.1\" c.a.s.i.s.s.PluginAuthenticationProvider Could not authenticate XXXXX; authentication by com.atlassian.stash.stash-authentication:crowdHttpAuthHandler failed\r\ncom.atlassian.stash.user.AuthenticationSystemException: The remote authentication server is not available.

Suspected Cause\r\n\r\nCrowd  is resolving DNS name into IP and then connects to LDAP server using the IP instead of the hostname. As a result, the underlying Java code tries to compare the destination IP with the DN in the certificate.\r\n\r\nIf this is verified as the cause then the same issue will occur when the reverse-lookup IP doesn't match DN in certificate (DNS1 -> IP -> DNS2). This situation is quite common.\r\n\r\nh2. Fix: install a Java version equal to or newer than 1.8u65\r\n\r\nJava version 1.8u65 contains a fix [JDK-8133196|https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8133196] which addresses the problem described in this issue.  Please see [How to Use System JRE Instead of Embedded JRE|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/How+to+Use+System+JRE+Instead+of+Embedded+JRE] for instructions to change the version of Java that JIRA runs with.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\n(!) Only necessary if you do not upgrade your Java JDK.  If your version of JIRA does not support Java 8 or you cannot upgrade to 1.8u65 a workaround is necessary.\r\n\r\nh5. Add JVM startup parameter {{-Djdk.tls.trustNameService=true}}\r\n\r\nThis reverts back to the older Java behavior while preserving all the other security related changes in the newer Java release.  Your LDAP data will still be encrypted.  The risk is described by Oracle in their explanation of the change at http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/8u51-relnotes-2587590.html.\r\n\r\nh5. Disable SSL check\r\n\r\n Under the LDAP connection \"Advanced Settings\" set \"Secure SSL\" to disabled*.  As stated in the UI this will disable all verification of the SSL certificate.  Your LDAP data will still be encrypted.  (!) This workaround may represent a greater vulnerability as any SSL cert could be substituted with no need to compromise a DNS server.",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-45361].\n  {panel}\n\nThere are two issues reported related to this, JRA-16595 & JRA-39112, but I thought I'd put a general suggestion that encompasses the whole problem.\r\n\r\nh3. Problem\r\nAs long as the user has create issue permission in a project, they can move an issue to it and more importantly, to ANY workflow state in the target workflow. This creates an issue in a use case such as:\r\n\r\n-If you are using in a project (or specific issue type) a workflow that has specific restrictions as it is being used in a strict approval process. The ability to use the move issue operation to \"bypass\" any workflow conditions and validators renders the approval workflow useless. (not saying that someone would necessarily maliciously seek to do so)\r\n\r\n-Similarly, it could be moving to a different issue type within the same project that is using a different workflow as well. \r\n\r\nLooking at the consequences mentioned in the other linked issues, simply put, the \"move issue\" operation is one could say \"too powerful\" as it doesn't respect workflow conditions and permissions in the target project.\r\n\r\nh3. Solution\r\n\r\nRemoving create issue permissions to a project or move issue permissions is in a lot of cases not really an option and therefore not a solution.\r\n\r\nWhat would be a solution apart from all conditions and permissions being taken account by the code, would be the ability to disable moving TO a project/issue type either via permission or otherwise so that at least any really problematic cases can be avoided.\r\n\r\nh3. Workarounds?\r\n\r\nAt least for my case I am looking at whether it is impossible to employ a hack to remove certain projects or issue types from the ui dialogue similar to https://confluence.atlassian.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=301663662.
