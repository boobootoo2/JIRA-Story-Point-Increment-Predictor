Problem Definition\r\n\r\nWhen using a touchscreen as an input device, touch/gesture responses are inconsistent and/or behave in an unexpected way when navigating Agile Boards.\r\n\r\n(i) The issue has best reproducibility and visibility on a largely populated board with many issues and columns which cause the board to not fit in browser view, necessitating scrolling to see the whole board.\r\n\r\n(off) Using a Windows 10 laptop with touchscreen capabilities, on Google Chrome 53.0.2785.116 m:\r\n\r\nRapidly swiping across the screen when starting the swipe in blank space will scroll the page, allowing the user to navigate to offscreen portions of the board. This is expected.\r\n\r\nRapidly swiping across the screen when starting the swipe on an issue will pick the issue up and proceed with moving it around the board, which is *unexpected*. The effect of this is that largely populated boards can become difficult and unintuitive to scroll through.\r\n\r\n(on) Using the same laptop on Firefox instead:\r\n\r\nRapidly swiping across the screen when starting the swipe in blank space will scroll the page, allowing the user to navigate to offscreen portions of the board. This is expected.\r\n\r\nRapidly swiping across the screen when starting the swipe on an issue will still scroll the page, allowing the user to navigate to offscreen portions of the board. This is expected.\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nNormalize the behavior from within the application to match what is expected and happens in Firefox. It's desired that swipes scroll a page, and prolonged holds and then drags can perform a drag and drop instead. \r\n\r\nConsider revising JIRA's Supported Platforms documentations to be more explicit about using touchscreens as an input device, as well as Mobile versions of the standard supported browsers.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\u00a0\r\nConsider using a different browser, which may offer different behaviors when it comes to touchscreen behaviors.",

However, the closest I could find were suggesting firing an event on a linked issue.\r\n\r\nIt would be great to have a new link type that would allow certain fields to be mirrored between the linked issues. Specifically, I would like to see Comments and Status be mirrored. When a comment is added to one it shows up in the other. When one of the issues is closed the other is closed. I realize the status could get messy if the linked issues have different workflows. As a suggested solution If when an issue is closed, if the workflows/statuses don't align then the user could be presented w/ a 'what do you want to do with the linked issue screen'.\r\n\r\nExample use case:\r\n# A user sends in a request to JIRA Service Desk for a product issue/enhancment\r\n# The issue is cloned and moved to the development project in JIRA SW\r\n# The developer works the issue to closure in JIRA SW\r\n# Today somehow the Agent has to be manually notified to take action on the JSD issue.

Also a few more clicks.\r\n\r\nPlease also note that most browsers open links in a new tab when clicked with Ctrl key pressed.\r\n\r\nSuggestion: Currently, search box makes the search with \"Enter\" key.

For some reason highlight foreground color is white, which is not easy to see as the highlight background color is light gray. The highlight background color looks nice, but the highlight foreground color should then be black for clarity. I have noticed that in some other applications the highlight foreground color is black, too. Someone also said that the highlight foreground color could not be changed.\r\n\r\nIn adding link to an issue you can add the link target issue to a text field. The text field is also a search box, which opens a list of issues. In this list the highlight foreground color is black, like it should be.\r\n\r\nI see that default highlight background color is blue, which is quite a dark color. But it can be changed. If it is changed to lighter color, you should be able to at least also change the highlight foreground color to black. Why can you only change the highlight background color?\r\n\r\nJira v7.1.10.",

Problem Definition\r\nIn some cases it might be helpful to have JIRA be able to send out notifications to other linked issues, when the main issue is updated/closed/etc.\u00a0 Presently this is not possible within JIRA, as all changes to a single issue only follow the given notification scheme which applies to all issues in that project.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor example, if you have a project called \"ABC\" and there are three issues in the project.

Suggested Solution\r\nAllow a notification scheme event such as \"Linked issue updated\" to be created in turn fire an alert\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround \r\nIt might be possible to use a 3rd party plugin like scriptrunner in order to create a script that would check all existing linked issues when an update was made, and in turn create an edit/update on those issues in order to trigger a notification.\u00a0\u00a0 However this could be tricky since if you have a large environment with lots of issues linked to other issues, in theory you could create a tsunami of email notifications with a single change to one issue (something that could cause severe performance problems, as well as inbox problems).",

Steps to Reproduce\r\n * Have a cascading select field (i.e. testcascadefield) with at least 2 defined contexts. Let's call them ContextA and ContextBC\r\n ** ContextA is configured for ProjectA\r\n ** ContextB is configured for 2 projects: ProjectB and ProjectC\r\n * Now configure the value options of ContextA and ContextB to have overlap\r\n ** For example, let's say both allows for selecting the value \"foobar\"\r\n * Ensure that your account *does not* have \"Browse\" permissions to ProjectB and ProjectC\r\n ** This is the key trigger of the bug\r\n * Now running the JQL:\r\n{code:java}\r\ntestcascadefield in cascadeOption(\"foobar\")\r\n\r\n{code}\r\n\r\n * We get the error:\r\n{code:java}\r\nAn option provided by the function 'cascadeOption' for the field 'testcascadefield' does not exist.\r\n{code}\r\n\r\n * Now, if we grant the user account to either \"Browse\" permissions to either ProjectB or ProjectC, the error does not occur.\r\n\r\nSo the problem occurs on 2 conditions:\r\n# if there is a context containing no projects that the user account can see\r\n** As long as there's at least 1 project in the context viewable to the user, then the error does not occur.\r\n# if there is a option in the context that is the same value as another context\r\n\r\nh4. Expected Behaviour\r\nIf an user does not have access to projects defined within a field's context, this should not affect the results for contexts that the user does have proper access to\r\n\r\nh4. Actual Behaviour\r\nNo issues are returned and the user is instead presented with an error\r\n\r\nh4. Workaround\r\n# Avoid using the function. \"cascadeOption\".  So from the above example, use this instead:\r\n{code}\r\ntestcascadefield in (\"foobar\")\r\n{code}\r\n# Or check each context to ensure that the user has access to at least one of the projects listed\r\n# Or avoid having multiple contexts with the same option values",

[See the corresponding bug report|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-62590].\r\n{panel}\r\nh3. Summary\r\n\r\nWhen editing a Date Picker field (Due Date, for example), when Jira default language is set to Danish/Portuguese/Slovencina/Swedish/Russian, the date filled when the user clicks on the calendar icon and picks a day is filled with an invalid format.\r\nh4. Examples\r\n\r\nFor example, in Portuguese-PTBR it is expected a date like 6/set/16 and the date picker fills as 6/Sep/16, throwing an error for the date format.\r\n\r\nIn the Danish example, all months selected (Except Maj or May) all appear to be forcing their abbreviations with an additional period '.'\r\n{quote}14/nov/18\r\n V\u00e6lg en dato\r\n Ugyldigt datoformat. Indtast en dato i formatet \"d/MMM/yy\".\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\n However entering a value such as '14/nov./18' will work correctly (except for the month of may which is not technically abbreviated with only 3 characters).\r\n\r\nThe same happens with Russian language, forcing months' abbreviations with an additional period '.'\u00a0\r\nh3. Environment\r\n * Jira 7.2 or 7.2.1 with a translation pack (tested with Portuguese-PTBR and Slovenian)\r\n * Jira 7.12.3 with Danish default language set\r\n * Jira 8.19.1 with Russian default locale language set\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # In the system administration panel, switch the General Setting of system language to a language such as Danish, Portuguese, or Slovenia\r\n # Access a ticket on Jira\r\n # Click on Edit and modify a Date Picker field value, by choosing a date after clicking on the calendar icon next to the field.\r\n # Attempt to save the date changes\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nThe date is filled correctly according to the language pack.\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nJira returns an error message that the date format is invalid. However the javascript date picker, java input format, and look and feel settings are correctly set.\r\nh3. Notes\r\n\r\nThis bug ticket was originally indicating that the translation pack might have been the cause of this problem. However upon further investigation it appears that Jira itself is not correctly handling regional differences in regards to month names and their appropriate abbreviation to that region / locale. For Danish this is particularly difficult because the region appears to require that 3 letter month abbreviations end with a period. The Javascript date picker can be configured to adjust to that, but not for the month of May/Maj.\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nFor Portuguese, Dutch:\r\n This is not reproducible when using the d/MM/yy format (9/6/16 for example), so users can do the following to change the format:\r\n # Go to {{Administration > System > Advanced Settings}}\r\n # Change the following parameters:\r\n{code:java}\r\njira.date.picker.java.format = d/MM/yy{code}\r\n{code:java}\r\njira.date.picker.javascript.format = %e/%m/%y{code}\r\n{code:java}\r\njira.date.time.picker.java.format = dd/MM/yy h:mm a{code}\r\n{code:java}\r\njira.date.time.picker.javascript.format = %e/%m/%y %l:%M %p{code}",

Unfortunately, this plugin only enables voters to Like or Dislike a comment within issue and provides a summary tally of Comment Likes/Dislikes. It does not provide a way to see who voted for/against or who abstained vs did not vote at all.\u00a0 This would provide a simple solution for electronic configuration control board approval (or not) for all JIRA Change Requests submitted to our baseline system.\r\n\r\nRelated to this requirement is that two of the People fields are not being captured/listed in the current JIRA Issue Activity/History tabs: Votes & Watchers. Only Assignee and Reporter are captured under Activity, etc. Is there a way to add the Votes & Watchers as another tab? That would help on the reporting requirement--sort of.\r\n\r\nWhat we really need is to be able to generate Issue level and Project level queries and reports listing Users/Groups showing if and how each person voted, assuming functionality of voting For (Like), Against (Dislike), Abstain (Meh), or Not Voted (Slacker) is added. However, we can't do this now because the current JIRA VOTES field is boolean (either Voted or Not Voted) which only tells you if someone voted or not. It does not tell you if someone is voting FOR, AGAINST, ABSTAINING, is ignoring you, or just hasn't gotten around to voting yet.\r\n\r\nPlease add the ability to either customize or add additional values/options to the VOTES field or use the social apps like/dislike features already elsewhere in JIRA Comments and Confluence.\r\n\r\nWe are using JIRA version 7.2.0.\r\n\r\n\u00a0",

Therefore we need a way to filter for all issues that have been marked as \"Resolved\" but are not yet marked as \"Closed\".\r\n\r\nIn JIRA Cloud when I click on \"Issues\" it defaults to \"Open Issues\". That's a reasonable default . But in the \"Switch filter\" list, there is no filter for \"Resolved but not closed\". There is a \"Done issues\" option, but that shows both resolved and closed issues, but for this use case we don't want to see see closed issues. We need to see which issues have been \"Resolved\" but not \"Closed\".\r\n\r\nI'm aware that I can manually add some filter, and every time we add a project we can add this to some complicated Boolean expression to include that project in the filter. But that's not what I'm asking for.\r\n\r\n* I don't want to have a filter that shows such issues across all projects. I want it to be shown only for the current project. Just like the \"Done issues\" filter.\r\n* I don't want to have to add a new filter to each project. I don't have to add the \"Done issues\" filter, for example---it's just already there.\r\n\r\nSo please add a \"Resolved but not Closed\" filter that is available to each project _by default_. After all, the \"resolved->closed\" workflow is one of the default JIRA workflows, so there needs to be a filter for it.\r\n\r\nSee related service desk issue [JST-214454|https://support.atlassian.com/servicedesk/agent/JST/issue/JST-214454].",

Actual Results\r\nThe link still exists and you get the following error in the atlassian-fisheye.log\r\n{code}\r\n2016-09-15 13:18:24,965 INFO  [qtp629454893-261 ] fisheye ServletUtils-send404 - 404: Page not found referer=http://localhost:8080/plugins/servlet/gadgets/ifr?container=atlassian&mid=10200&country=US&lang=en&view=default&view-params=%7B%22writable%22%3A%22true%22%7D&st=atlassian%3A0pZdJ1vKUa8cieUy%2BKTBTmRWI9dce2zCSnBS8FMTStyyyAI%2FivdiViXcLg5YyXC06TLJwK1j2cWzoXK3MXPWwXqQjg%2Bk4CLhfGWulWE%2Fol8DaF9GrznE1nfB65%2Fr%2FkNB0mNG%2FJzgSjoqFvbAZucO9tgJhG%2Basn5HSA2BBQaSNFQgdfM5H%2BukKg3%2BY4OJLMQgxbg2JxN9PiHUtVDlPcAonxDZZZZQniV6gSlFClS8On3bhFuOMaOHfVL70Cok58WHApa9QFRiFTg2Ryz4D1LjQ10xLLGj%2BWKVPLDjcz4iyCZqWh%2BpoCZvSsLP0g21np6OPHGEeA%3D%3D&up_isConfigured=true&up_isReallyConfigured=true&up_title=Activity%2520Stream&up_titleRequired=true&up_numofentries=10&up_refresh=15&up_maxProviderLabelCharacters=50&up_rules=%257B%2522providers%2522%253A%255B%257B%2522provider%2522%253A%2522streams%2522%252C%2522rules%2522%253A%255B%255D%252C%2522disabled%2522%253Atrue%257D%252C%257B%2522provider%2522%253A%2522issues%2522%252C%2522rules%2522%253A%255B%255D%257D%252C%257B%2522provider%2522%253A%2522reviews%2540dac83311-64d8-3a12-bb69-a0128f657b0f%2522%252C%2522rules%2522%253A%255B%255D%257D%252C%257B%2522provider%2522%253A%2522source%2540dac83311-64d8-3a12-bb69-a0128f657b0f%2522%252C%2522rules%2522%253A%255B%255D%257D%255D%257D&up_renderingContext=&up_keys=&up_itemKeys=&up_username=&url=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A8080%2Frest%2Fgadgets%2F1.0%2Fg%2Fcom.atlassian.streams.streams-jira-plugin%3Aactivitystream-gadget%2Fgadgets%2Factivitystream-gadget.xml&libs=auth-refresh\r\n{code}\r\n ",

However, this is logged as a warning and would cause problems to JIRA admins trying to figure out if they should perform any corrective measure.\r\nh3.

Notes\r\nh4. Verification\r\nTaking thread dumps as per [Generate a Thread Dump|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Generating+a+Thread+Dump] during problematic periods of slowness, and searching for the below stack traces can indicate this is a problem:\r\n\r\n{code:borderStyle=solid}\r\ngrep -c 'http-bio-80-exec' thread_dump1.txt \r\n150\r\n\r\ngrep 'http-bio-80-exec' thread_dump1.txt | grep -c 'waiting on condition' \r\n145\r\n\r\ngrep -A 20 'http-bio-80-exec' thread_dump1.txt | grep -c 'getProjectContextIdsForQuery' \r\n145\r\n\r\ngrep 'http-bio-80-exec' thread_dump1.txt | grep runnable \r\n\"http-bio-80-exec-37\" #255 daemon prio=5 os_prio=0 tid=0x000000002b37d000 nid=0x1c48 runnable\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nh5. Other notes\r\nThis actual bug is not caused by large number of version, but happy assumption in cache loader {{getProjectContextIdsForQuery}} that it will take feasible amount of time\r\nto resolve queries\r\nProblem with large number of versions is mitigated in [JRA-62666|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRA-62666] bug and fixed in JIRA 7.1.2 and 6.4.14\r\n\r\nh5. Related bugs\r\n* loading cache {{getProjectContextIdsForQuery}} is exectuted as part of {{findRapidViewsByProject}} method, see JSWSERVER-16130\r\n* loading cache  {{getProjectContextIdsForQuery}} is done as part of {{board-scope-filter}}  loading data for sidebar, see JSWSERVER-16185 \r\n* combination of those 2 bugs makes any thread which needs sidebar to render the page to also wait for this cache. \r\n\r\nh3.Workaround \r\nApplicable for JIRA 6.4.x only, From JRA-45178 \r\nUse the following steps below. \r\n# Disable the {{board-scope-filter}} module in JIRA Agile Add-on ({{board-scope-filter}} module tells the sidebar the list of boards to show on the board dropdown as well as the board that is currently selected.). This will disable {{com.atlassian.greenhopper.web.sidebar.AgileBoardScopeFilterContextProvider.getContext}} method. \r\n## Navigate through Administration menu > Add-ons > Manage Add-ons > Select 'JIRA Agile'\r\n## Expand the JIRA Agile Add-on modules\r\n## Find the 'board-scope-filter' module and disable it.\r\n# Disable Project Navigation (Sidebar project navigation) for all users: Administration Menu > System > Project Navigation\r\n",
