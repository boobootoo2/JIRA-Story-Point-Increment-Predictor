I acknowledge the efforts and time you put into this project, but when comparing the Sourcetree UI on Windows to the Mac OSX screenshots, I'm a bit jealous.\r\n\r\nThe UI seems clunky, buttons are way too big, icons look like low quality GIF's w/o alpha transparency, pretty much every UI element has a gradient as background, highlighted text have often a blue background that is awkwardly big, some corners are rounded and others are not, UI elements are not aligned etc.\r\n\r\nIt works, but it isn't a joy to work with it yet. TortoiseHG proves that a simple but tidy UI is possible to implement on Windows. I would really appreciate if the Windows UI receives some love, even if that would mean to use the default Windows UI/WPF style or a clean VS2012 like design.

Keep working on those features :)\r\n\r\nCheers\r\n\r\nJames.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

It's not necessarily the most politically correct solution, but git is a Linux tool and Linux does not like paths with backslashes, so it does make a kind of sense.  If you are waiting on msysgit to address this in a different manner you will be waiting an awfully long time as they have already addressed this issue as described.\r\n\r\nThis is also something that your other Windows git tool competitors all already handle correctly because they take Windows seriously.  Git Extensions does this.  TortoiseGit does this.  Etc.  They all handle Windows UNCs silently and without complaint by simply converting the path internally by replacing backslashes with forward slashes, which git expects and handles.  SourceTree is the only major tool which does not do this.\r\n\r\nSo if you would like to match your other competitors Windows git GUI tools by supporting Windows UNCs, a vital necessity to Windows uers, then all that you have to do is internally convert the path string with a simple find-and-replace of all backslashes to forward slashes.\r\n\r\nOtherwise your Windows git tool competitors will all continue to have a significant compelling advantage over your Windows port of SourceTree.",

      "description": "WPF is very smart in that you can give it a collection of objects and implement styles to render them to your needs. However it seems that when these collections get very large, their efficiency suffers and particularly in the diff view this can cause performance issues, exacerbated by the fact that WPF always runs in the main thread (so even though we're doing all our work in background threads to avoid stalling the UI, WPF can still cause stalls in the user experience).\r\n\r\nInvestigate ways to improve this. Virtualisation can help, but has drawbacks too (we have used it in places but have had to use shims to keep things like selections working consistently). A more extreme solution might be to just manually render the diff view instead of using WPF's stylings to do it (quite a bit of work). For the moment the workarounds keep things mostly acceptable (limiting diff size for added/removed/untracked files) but there are edge cases which are noticably slow, like very large diffs caused by line ending conversions or automated tools.\r\n\r\nSee https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/SRCTREEWIN-310 for one instance of this.",
