[See the corresponding bug report|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-43280].\n  {panel}\n\nI am trying to use our instance of JIRA for asset management. I have two tables, one for service users, one for assets. I am using links to identify those assets being used by a user.\r\nWhen I create a link and add a comment (Link Asset-7224 to User-869), that is fine. It shows the comment on the Asset, and that there is a link on the user (if I look at \"ALL\" in the activitiy of the issue).\r\nHowever, If I go to the asset and delete the link to the user, what shows is\r\nASSET HISTORY: Admin made changes - 8 minutes ago\r\n                              Link \tThis issue alloc'd to USER-869 [ USER-869 ] \t \r\nUSER HISTORY:  Admin made changes - 9 minutes ago\r\n                              Link \tThis issue alloc'd to ASSET-7224 [ ASSET-7224 ]\r\n\r\nAdditionally, if I go to the user record (user-869) and then use the Activity tab within Activity on the issue (as it's a little prettier), it tells you \r\n    \"Admin: Admin removed the Link of USER-869 - JO HARDMAN\r\n                 Core10 minutes ago\"\r\nBut that is not what has happened. What has happened is the deletion of the link to Asset-7224. It makes no sense making the Activity bit unusable, and the ALL bit unusable.\r\n\r\nWhy does the ALL tab not say that the link is removed? or the ACTIVITY tab not say what has been removed?  We need to keep a history of the links for the whole service desk. Any advice would be appreciated as at present, this is unworkable and we may need to look at another solution.\r\n(see attached for examples of what the ALL and ACTIVITY tabs show for each issue being linked/link removed.)\r\n",

Problem Definition\r\n\r\nCurrently, there is no method for JIRA to perform any data validation/detection when it comes to checking the integrity of the data within JIRA. As a result, whenever there is any problems with the integrity of the data within JIRA, it does not get detected beforehand. As a result, sometimes the problem is only detected when it's too late (for example, when upgrading).\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nIt would be great if we have some sort of method or tool that can detect and validate the integrity of the data in an instance. This way many data integrity issues can be detected early and solved. The current Integrity Checker does not seem to be able to detect these issues. Perhaps a health check tool instead?",

Pop up is coming up even tho JIRA does not need the use of JAVA applet in the login page.\r\n\r\nh3. Environment\r\n* Firefox with _Java Deployment Toolkit_ installed (see [^toolkit.png]).\r\n* Windows only\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# You will need to ensure in your firefox, your java is installed. Can you checked your java here https://www.java.com/en/download/installed.jsp\r\n# Go to your firefox setting, add-on. Go to Plugins. Ensure \"Java Deployment Toolkit\" is present\r\n# Open Firefox (with the Java Deployment Toolkit installed);\r\n# Access the JIRA dashboard.\r\n# Notice there will be a red warning on the left side of the browser URL box, click on it the warning message will be displayed.\r\n\r\nThis is demonstrated in the two attached videos:\r\n* [^toolkit_warning.mov]\r\n* [^on_older_versions.mov]\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n* JIRA should not cause Firefox to try to run the Java Deployment Toolkit.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n* The warning pop-up \"Firefox has prevented the unsafe plugin \"Java\" from running on ..\" (see attachment) is displayed.\r\n \r\nh3. Notes\r\nFirefox is not blocking Java per se, instead it is blocking the Java Development Toolkit from running. [What the toolkit does|https://www.java.com/en/download/faq/deployment_toolkit.xml] in this case is simply get the version of Java installed. Consequently, there are no side effects of this not running.\r\n\r\nInternet Explorer 11 seems to be affected also by a previously downloaded java deployment toolkit. In this case, the browser will prompt the user to let JIRA run java although it's not required for JIRA to function.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\nPlease ignore the warning. The Java Deployment Toolkit plugin is known to be insecure and is unnecessary in most cases and therefore it was blocked by Firefox as per https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/blocked/p428.",

During a sprint, sometimes the scope or nature of a story changes due to new requirements or discoveries.  We sometimes need to move a portion of a story's sub-tasks in to a new one, and push it in to our backlog.\r\n\r\nThe current process involves:\r\n\r\n# Creating the story or stories we need to move the sub-tasks too (unless they already exist, which is rare).\r\n# Navigating to the story that hosts the sub-tasks we need to move.\r\n# Select the \"More \\ Move All Sub-tasks\" feature\r\n# Select the sub-tasks to move\r\n# Select the story to move them to\r\n# Then select \"Move Sub-tasks\"\r\n\r\nA simpler experience would be not to create the target stories in preparation of the move.  Rather just create the story inline with the move process:\r\n\r\n#...\r\n# Select the sub-tasks to move\r\n# Select \"Create a new story\"\r\n# Then select \"Move Sub-tasks\"\r\n# Present the \"Create\" pop-up window\r\n# Create the story and save\r\n\r\nThis helps keep the team workflow in line with the conversation and simplifies the overall effort.",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-43208].\n  {panel}\n\nWe're using JIRA 6.4.1.  Currently, JIRA uses relative dates for the first 7 days, then switches to absolute dates.  We would like to be able to configure the number of days before converting to absolute dates.  For example, it would be nice to set this to only 3 days.  It would also be nice to be able to change this setting on a per-user basis.\r\n\r\nWe know that it's possible to [disable relative dates|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRAKB/Disable+Relative+Dates+in+JIRA] completely, but that doesn't get what we want.  We are also aware that hovering over the relative date shows the absolute date.  Again, this isn't quite enough and requires action from the user as opposed to being able to quickly glance at a screen to see the right level of information.\r\n\r\nWhat we'd like is :\r\n# To be able to set a User Default value for the number of relative days before converting to absolute dates.  \r\n# To allow users to override this preference individually in their profile.\r\n# To allow users to effectively disable relative dates by setting the preference to {{0}} days, meaning always show absolute dates.\r\n\r\n*NOTE:* This is in addition to the request to [Display Relative Dates with Times|JRA-42780]",

The Apache Portable Runtime is a highly portable library that is at the heart of Apache HTTP Server 2.x.
