Problem\r\n\r\nThe issue can significantly increase JIRA's response times during user directory synchronisation. The efect is very noticable on instances with high number of inactive users.\r\nh3. Cause\r\n\r\nProblem is caused by combination of multiple factors:\r\n * JIRA leaves inactive users in user pool\r\n * Crowd has no knowledge of \"inactive users\"\r\n * Crowd throws user deletion event for every user separately\r\n * JIRA checks for licence exceed with request and not by schedule\r\n * On user delete JIRA needs to recalculate the user count again\r\n * Directory sync is not atomic operation.\r\n * Cache invalidation needs to wait for pending cache load to finish",

It is not possible to see the last login date when the user is coming from Crowd.\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\nWe need to get the information of last login from Crowd side and add it to the JIRA UI.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\nIt is possible to get this information from Crowd database by running the following query : \r\n{noformat}SELECT u.user_name, a.attribute_value as lastlogin FROM cwd_user u JOIN cwd_user_attribute a ON u.id = a.user_id WHERE attribute_name = 'lastAuthenticated' ORDER BY lastlogin DESC;{noformat}\r\nThe result will be in EPOCH time, you would need to convert it to get the exact date. Every successful login attempt from Crowd user in JIRA, JIRA will update the last login value into Crowd database.",

JIRA uses the URL the instance is connected to, so the JIRA instance needs to be able to access itself. If it's not able to do so errors will occur. This information is known to cause issues as mentioned here: https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRAKB/How+to+fix+gadget+titles+showing+as+__MSG_gadget\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\nAdd a note on the nginx documentation informing that the JIRA instance needs to be able to access itself and uses the base URL. Therefore network admins would take necessary steps during the proxy setup for this. \r\n\r\n",

This is quite troublesome for admins as admins are not necessary belong to the groups, but admins might need to filter the issues by groups for reporting/reviewing purpose.\r\n\r\n+Example:+\r\n'ABC-Company' groups is created, but admin is not the member of 'ABC-Company'.\r\nAdmin is trying to filter the issue {{project = ABC AND reporter in (membersOf(ABC-Company))}}, but ABC-Company is not showing on Suggested Groups\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Resolution\r\n# It should show all groups to the users who belong to 'administrators' group\r\n# Admin can configure whether to show all groups to admins n suggested group\r\n\r\nh3.

The exception to this are words which are stemmed.\r\nThis limitation can also be overcome using fuzzy searches.\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nJQL allows us to search only *whole words*. When it comes to \"foo-bar\", the each of \"foo\" and \"bar\" is handled as a *whole word*.\r\nOn the other hand, \"foo-123\" seems to be handled as only one \"whole word\" and we can't search for \"foo\" and \"123\".\r\n\r\nh3.Workaround\r\nNo workaround at this moment.",

Notes\r\n * From the Analysis of [~vkrupach1], confirmed on our side: the difference between Bubble Charts and other gadgets. based on 7.4.2 and 7.10.0 Jira sources, the Bubble Charts is the only configurable gadget that is defined as \"dashboard-item\" that has the _definition_ tag (see [https://developer.atlassian.com/server/jira/platform/dashboard-item-module/]) while all other gadgets are defined with \"replace-gadget-spec-uri\" tag (i.e. backward compatibility with old gadgets development approach). So in Jira prior to 7.8.3 saving settings for \"replace-gadget-spec-uri\" gadgets clears preferences for \"definition\" gadgets. This means that configurable \"dashboard-item\" gadgets developed according to the new approach (i.e. with defintion tag) loose their settings when any other gadget is configured.\r\n * This issue is not present in the latest Jira 7.12.3 and 7.13.0.",

Summary\r\n\r\nSetting an entity property value to a string longer than 255 characters fails returning error 500 if the property type is set to 'string'.\r\n\r\nThis is because, as mentioned in below documentation page:\r\n - [https://developer.atlassian.com/jiradev/jira-platform/building-jira-add-ons/jira-entity-properties-overview]\r\n\r\n{quote}\r\ntext: tokenized before indexing and allows for searching for particular words.\r\n string: indexed as-is and allows for searching for the exact phrase only.\r\n{quote}\r\nIt should be documented than the limit is 255 characters when using the type 'string' and a better error message should be returned in case a bigger value is provided.\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Set the entity property type to 'string'\r\n # Send a text longer than 255 character as the property value. E.g.

Problem Definition\r\nCurrently, when JIRA does the index snapshot, it does not verify if the index files are in a working state. When we recover the index files, it could lead to a situation where we need to rebuild the index by performing a full reindex - this will cause downtime and index recovery suppose to avoid the downtime. This defeats the purpose of the index recovery. \r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\nTo have a health checker before taking a snapshot. If the index files are not healthy, warn the System Admin and do not perform the snapshot. With this, the Admin will be able to recover the index files that is in the working state and perform a background reindex.\r\n",

Problem Definition\r\nIMAP mailbox is queried for non \u201cDELETED\u201d messages, after processing messages are marked as \u201cDELETED\u201d and removed from the server.\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\nIt would be nice to have the possibility to configure mail handlers in JIRA to leave the messages on the mail server after they have been processed.\r\n\r\nA similar behavior to the one seen in Service Desk when using IMAP:\r\n{quote}\r\nIf you use IMAP, emails are marked as read (not deleted) after they are processed by JIRA Service Desk.\r\n{quote}\r\n(source:\u00a0[https://confluence.atlassian.com/servicedeskcloud/receiving-requests-by-email-747602718.html])\r\n\r\nh3. Note on fix\r\n(i) We will introduce a new \"*mark as seen*\" checkbox in the UI for handlers using IMAP. \r\n !JRASERVER-62660_img.jpg|thumbnail! \r\n(!) If you decide to switch to \"mark as seen\" option, please make sure to delete emails from the IMAP folders periodically to prevent unlimited size growth.\r\n\r\nAlso:\r\n* The current/old handlers should have it \"off\" by default so the behaviour should be the same as before: processing should delete email from IMAP. \r\n* There is small change to the way the emails are fetched - before only \"not deleted\" has been fetched, now \"not deleted\" + \"not seen\" - this is to ensure that switching from \"checked\" to \"unchecked\" won't process the \"seen\" mail.\r\n* The previous behaviour of fetch \"not deleted\" can be restored if needed by using feature flag \"_com.atlassian.jira.mailHandlerImapMessageQueryLegacy.enabled_\" \u00a0\r\n",

Problem Definition\r\nNew Atlassian Connect add-ons create users in the application so they can perform some operations. Some of these operations can trigger notification events.\r\nFor example the new JIRA Misc Workflow Extensions (JMWE) add-on user sends a notification when a the add-on reassigns the issue to another user by way of a workflow post-function\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\nAs a JIRA admin I'd like to disable notifications from these system users from Atlassian Connect add-ons.\r\n \r\nh3. Workaround \r\nYou could remove the Issue Assigned event from the project notification scheme, but this will stop this kind of notifications from all users, not just system ones.",
