The latest issue type used to create an issue is always set as the suggested choice even if you start a new session in a different browser or in an incognito windows.\r\n\r\nThis is not working as documented:\r\n # [Associating issue types with projects|https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiraserver072/associating-issue-types-with-projects-828787733.html]:\r\n{quote}Set the Default Issue Type for the new scheme from the drop-down list. Please Note:\r\n * The 'default issue type' is the issue type displayed in the selection-box when a user creates an issue.\r\n * The issue types in this list depend on the issues in the Issue Types for Current Scheme list on the left.\r\n * The None option means that there is no default value. If this option is selected, the system will show the first Issue Type listed in the Issue Types for Current Scheme.\r\n * The Issue Type is remembered as long as you keep creating issues in the same project. Once you change projects or log off the system, it goes back to the default value.{quote}\r\n # [How to change the default issue type displayed at the Create Issue screen|https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirakb/how-to-change-the-default-issue-type-displayed-at-the-create-issue-screen-707986896.html]\r\n{quote} * The next time the user creates an new Issue, the last issue type used will be displayed. -----JRASERVER-30620----- - Setting Default Issue Type to \"None\" Ignored RESOLVED\r\n * Once a user has created an issue in a project in the current session, JIRA retains the issue type from the previous issue any time the user creates a new issue in the same project.

The URL(s) for alerts generated from the SIEM tools are not sanitized and accidental clicking on these links might impact the Laptops of professionals.\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\nIntroduce a feature to disable hyperlinks rendered on JIRA\r\n \r\nh3. Workaround\r\nOne quick way is to manually encode the first character of your URL so that the rendering engine does not recognize it as a URL. For example the letter h is encoded as:\r\n{noformat}\r\n&#104;\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nThus a link should be entered as \r\n{code}\r\n&#104;ttps://www.google.com\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nwhich will output as &#104;ttps://www.google.com",

Suggested Solution\r\nIt would help if the XML import methods would make a check against the version of JIRA this backup was created from and prevent the user from continuing when we know there is a high degree of either JIRA or Agile/JSD being able to update the customer's data successfully.   I created a screenshot with the type of dialog box to provide some feedback to the customer in regards to why we should not be able to upgrade this.\r\n\r\n!upgrayedcheck.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Why this is important\r\nCurrently JIRA does not check the version number listed in the backup that indicates what version of JIRA created this backup before it tries to then run any/all upgrade tasks on this older data.  This is a real problem for any JIRA instance running JIRA Server 6.4.x or before with Service Desk (any version) when going to any version of JIRA 7.2.0 or higher, and/or JIRA Agile 6.3.xx.x or before when trying to go to JIRA Software 7.1.0 or higher.\r\n\r\nGranted these are add-ons to JIRA, but our own [Skipping major versions when upgrading JIRA applications - Atlassian Documentation|https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiraserver071/skipping-major-versions-when-upgrading-jira-applications-802592265.html] indicates that all users should be upgrading JIRA versions from 6.4.x and before to a 7.0.x version.   The problem is many users still don't know this information.   It would be helpful if JIRA actively prevented upgrade attempts / XML restore attempts when detecting that the backup comes from a much older version of JIRA that should not be attempted to upgrade that data directly.\r\n",

      "description": "Over the last 5+ years we have received ongoing concerns from many of our users about JIRA's inability to retain and present the HTML tables, URLs, email addresses etc from the body of emails in the JIRA issues.\u00a0 When a HTML table with multiple rows and columns is converted to text format in the JIRA issue it is often illegible.\u00a0 Marek Sandomierski from our JIRA team has recently noticed that this shortcoming has been resolved in JIRA Service Desk. Will this ever be fixed in JIRA Core?\r\n\r\n[Explanation provided by Marek Sandomierski]\r\n\r\nGenerally the request concerns a problem on how JIRA mail handler deals with formatted text in the body of the email (HTML tables, URLs, email addresses etc). \r\n \r\n Currently the JIRA Mail Handler converts everything from email body into plain text before entering it to the ticket description and therefore reading some information that was included in the table is almost impossible - this is known issue and it was raised very often by our customers. \r\n Generally the description field allows some special formatting (wiki markup) so there should be some option to provide the input not only in plain text but also in wiki markup. \r\n \r\n Few months ago I was testing JIRA Service Desk and to my surprise email sent to JIRA with formatted table went through and format was kept (it was actually converted to wiki markup not a plain text). \r\n \r\n I did some research and it turnes our that Matthew McMahon, fixed this for JIRA Service Desk Mail handler (different mail handler then used by JIRA Core/Software). Therefore it is fixed for this product but not for JIRA Core/Software. \r\n https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSDSERVER-1942 \r\n https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSDSERVER-3296 \r\n \r\n It was raised for JIRA Core/Software product, however it was closed w/o any significant input. \r\n https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-20987",

Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Install JIRA 7.1.9, with JIRA Software\r\n# Create a saved filter with the operators \"NOT\" that precedes the  \"WAS IN\" (here is an example {code:borderStyle=solid}\r\n\"project = ABC AND NOT (Status was in (Done, Resolved) before -30d AND status in (Done, Resolved)) AND assignee = user1 ORDER BY Rank ASC\" \r\n{code}\r\n# Create a new board based off this saved filter\r\n# upgrade JIRA to 7.2.8 or 7.3.x\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nJIRA is able to load these boards as expected\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n# Trying to use the issue navigator when using both \"NOT\" and \"WAS IN\" in the same JQL query throws an error !result in 73x.PNG|thumbnail!\r\n# You are unable to list all the boards in JIRA when going to Boards -> View all boards. (The system just appears to spin and wait forever)\r\n# JIRA throws a 500 page error when tried to either visit the problem board directly, or even trying to visit the associated project landing page \r\n{code:borderStyle=solid}\r\nTechnical details\r\nLog's referral number: 95768191-b294-4121-bb17-df48bdb9c09a\r\nCause\r\nReferer URL: http://localhost:8080/plugins/servlet/project-config/ABC/roles\r\njava.lang.RuntimeException: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Unrecognized operator: WAS_IN\r\njava.lang.RuntimeException: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Unrecognized operator: WAS_IN\r\n\tat com.atlassian.web.servlet.plugin.DynamicAuthorizationServletForwarder.forward(DynamicAuthorizationServletForwarder.java:55) [?:?]\r\n\tat com.atlassian.web.servlet.plugin.DynamicAuthorizationServletForwarder.forwardSafely(DynamicAuthorizationServletForwarder.java:83) [?:?]\r\n\tat com.atlassian.web.servlet.plugin.SanitizingServletForwarder.forwardSafely(SanitizingServletForwarder.java:48) [?:?]\r\n\tat com.atlassian.web.servlet.plugin.RememberingServletForwarder.forwardSafely(RememberingServletForwarder.java:75) \r\n{code}\r\n \r\nh3. Notes\r\n* This query works in JIRA 7.1.x and before !result in 71x.PNG|thumbnail!\r\n* The error appears to include an underscore in the operator {{Unrecognized operator: WAS_IN}}, however when looking at the SQL data there does not appear to be an underscore in the query at all.   Hence there must be some other check/validation process within JIRA that is either adding this underscore, or is incorrectly checking for the valid operator of \"WAS IN\". \r\n* [Advanced searching - operators reference - Atlassian Documentation|https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirasoftwareserver073/advanced-searching-operators-reference-861256239.html#Advancedsearching-operatorsreference-WAS_INWASIN] still list {{WAS IN}} as a valid operator.\r\n* However instead I think we should be using the {{[WAS NOT IN|https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirasoftwareserver073/advanced-searching-operators-reference-861256239.html#Advancedsearching-operatorsreference-WAS_NOT_INWASNOTIN]}} operator here, rather than trying to negate the current WAS IN operator\r\n\r\n\r\nh3.Workaround\r\n# You can find the filters in your environment that are using this with a query such as {code:borderStyle=solid}\r\nselect * from searchrequest where reqcontent like '%was in%' and reqcontent like '%not%'; \r\n{code}\r\n# It would be best to create a [backup|https://confluence.atlassian.com/jira/backing-up-data-185729581.html] of your data before doing anything else\r\n# You will need to edit the filter query within SQL in order to change the JQL query.
