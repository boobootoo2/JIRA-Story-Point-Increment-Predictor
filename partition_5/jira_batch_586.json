Issue Summary\r\n\r\nWhen Jira is running against Java 11, TLS 1.3 requests can cause httpclient threads to become blocked\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nThis is possible with any app that uses TLS 1.3 in an environment running Java 11.x. We were able to reproduce this using the Jira Mobile app Android client.\r\n # Have Jira Mobile app plugins enabled\r\n # Have Jira Mobile Android users register/sign in via the mobile app\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nUsers can sign in and use Jira. Everything functions normally.\u00a0\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nAll http threads eventually become blocked on one I/O Dispatcher thread. The instance stops accepting incoming connections. After a restart, the instance stays online/available for some period of time before all connections are consumed again.\r\nh3.

      "description": "Hi,\r\n\r\nI know there is already some suggestions about the system filters and hiding. Mainly the reason is that when you do not use resolution then you get the error for example for \"Open Issues\". I think this is a bug and should be fixed.\r\n\r\nBut my suggestion is about the system filters itself. And I would like not only hide them but also edit or set or change its jql definition. So the administrator can customize them.\r\n\r\nThe main reason is the user experiance with Jira so the user do not see any messed filters that are not relevant even that make some error!\r\n\r\nIf the user open Filters then there is a list of system filters that are not relevant for custom projects. \r\n Pretend for example filter \"Done issues\". It has this jql definition: \r\n \"statusCategory = Done order by updated DESC\"\r\n\r\nand for our project this is irrelevant because our issues that are \"Done\" are not ony that with \"statusCategory = Done\" but also that with custom field \"MyTypeClose\" set to \"Fine\".\r\n\r\nSo our jql definition should look like: \"\r\n statusCategory = Done and MyTypeClose = Fine order by updated DESC\r\n\r\nIf there will be possible to edit the definition of system filters then then a lot of users can do anything with filters and they can fix its error with resolution and also others can set their own filter for all system filters. This would be very nice because then the Jira will again be more customizable and nice :).\r\n\r\nSo my solution and suggestion is:\r\n 1) please make editable the system filter defintion\r\n - either on the whole jira\r\n - or on the project level\r\n\r\n2) please make possible to hide the system filters\r\n - as in here: https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-63317\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPlease others see this suggestion and if you would like to have it vote for it.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nBest Regards",

Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Add a Comment to an existing issue and include an image citation with a width=100% attribute, such as:\r\n{noformat}\r\n!scales.png|width=100%! {noformat}\r\n(this could also be done in the Description field as well)\r\n\r\n # Click Save and notice that the image shows full width of that comment/description field.\r\n # Click the pencil to edit the comment.

Issue Impact\r\nThere's no impact aside from wrong information being displayed to users on their Profile. Pages and blogs are saved with the right time information.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Login to Jira as any user.\r\n# Click on the Profile Picture in the right upper corner.\r\n# Click on Profile.\r\n# Click on the Settings Tab.\r\n# Observe that Eastern Time is displayed as GMT-0500 even though from March to November it is supposed to be GMT-0400 due to DST - This is one example, other timezones may be affected as well:\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nJira should be considering the DST offset to display the right GMT on that screen when the user timezone is affected by DST.\r\n\r\nh3. Why this happens\r\nJira is leveraging the [Java Time Zone getRawOffeset|https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/TimeZone.html#getRawOffset()] method. It does return GMT-0500 as EST Timezone. It then parse it to display the information to users on screen",

Note:\r\n * The problem is related to a bug in the httpcore library that ships with Apache Httpclient used by Jira to communicate with remote services: [https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HTTPCORE-583].\r\n * The bug in httpcore was fixed in *4.4.12*.\r\n * The bug is triggered when Java 11 is used in combination with a version of httpcore that has the problem.\r\n * Jira ships with multiple versions of the httpcore library, main Jira 8.4.2 uses *httpcore-4.4.9.jar*, while some other bundled plugins use other versions:\r\n ** jira-workflow-sharing-plugin-2.2.3.jar-embedded uses httpcore-4.4.1.jar\r\n ** atlassian-remote-event-common-plugin-6.1.0.jar-embedded uses httpcore-4.4.10.jar\r\n\r\nh3. Solution\r\n\r\nUpgrade AdoptOpenJDK to version 11.0.8 which has this issue solved.\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\n * Downgrade your JDK version from jdk 11 to jdk 1.8, Java 1.8 is not known to cause this problem.\r\n * The issue is observed with Java 11 that uses TLS v1.3. TLS v1.2 is unaffected by this. It's possible to force Java 11 to use TLS v1.2 by adding the following JVM parameter:\u00a0{{-Dhttps.protocols=TLSv1.2}}\u00a0to your startup properties.",

Problem Definition\r\nOffice 365 is planning to discontinue support for basic auth on services like POP and IMAP on October 13, 2020.  As of today, basic auth (username and password) via IMAP/POP is the only way to make Jira able to use an Office 365 mailbox for receiving email.  More details about the upcoming changes to Microsoft's products can be found in https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/office/blogs/end-of-support-for-basic-authentication-access-to-exchange-online-apis-for-office-365-customers/\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\nImplement some other method of allowing Jira to authenticate to an office 365 mailbox, such as OAuth2.\r\n\r\nh3. Why this is important\r\nWithout this feature, regular office 365 accounts won't permit applications like Jira to connect to them.  It seems that the ProPlus accounts might still permit this after the set date, however it seems clear that improving security is the goal of this forced change, and perhaps it would benefit Jira to follow suit.\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround \r\nNone currently, if one should become available this will be updated to reflect that state.",

This is undesirable as it has both an implementation and operational overhead in addition to users being logged out if a node fails or is taken offline for maintenance.\r\n\r\n*Goal:* Session ID's are shared between Jira DC nodes eliminating the need for persistence records on a load balancer and in turn allow any http request to be served from any Jira DC node.\r\n\r\n*Benefits:*\r\n\r\nReduction of Jira DC implementation complexity.\r\n\r\nJira DC nodes can fail or be disabled without users loosing their sessions.\r\n\r\nEnhanced HA.",

Through enumeration, attackers can fingerprint platforms and applications that are known to use specific directory names.\r\n\r\nThese directories can also lead to exposure of sensitive information and privileged functionality. Predictable directory names and locations could expose admin interfaces, log files, configuration files, source code files and allow an attacker to add, remove or modify files.\r\n\r\nReconnaissance is a fundamental requirement for a successful attack. Predictable directory names and locations can make it very easy to map their target and obtain information essential for compromising the target.",

The size of these .js and .css files does cause inefficient client-side performance, especially when there is some network latency or on low resource client machines. After static content has been cached load times will improve significantly, but that initial experience for users who often re-login after browser cache has expired can be quite bad. The implications of this inefficiency with heavy static content handling is a lot worse on certain browser e.g. IE than others.\r\n* Agencies with old client machines tend to deal with the inefficient client-side performance more frequently.\r\n\r\nChrome's Google Lighthouse scores for a vanilla instance are lower than 20 as illustrated in screenshots below.

      "description": "h3. Issue Summary\r\nIf you open saved filter and edit it you must execute a search before you can save, this is working as intended.  However there is an error occuring on the method used to trigger the search and there a difference in outcome when you trigger the search via the enter/return key or if you click the \"Search\" button with your mouse before you save, Noting this is a cosmetic error only but does cause confusion as to wether the save was successful not leaving behind a \"Edited\" identifier intended to tell the user the filter needs to be saved although it already has been saved.\r\n\r\nh3. Environment\r\nJira Server verified on multiple 7.x and 8.x versions\r\nFor Jira Cloud See corresponding BUG: https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-73145\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Open a Saved filter in the issue navigator\r\n# edit the filter in any way\r\n# Note that next to the JQL's title a object \"Edited\" appears noting a change occurred to the filter and it needs to be saved\r\n# Click the search button with your mouse\r\n# Click Save\r\n# a popup noting the save was successful will appear in the upper right corner of the active browser window\r\n# Note the \"Edited\" notation goes away \r\n# Note that the filter is saved correctly\r\n# Make another change to the filter\r\n# Note the \"Edited\" notation re-appears\r\n# This time Hit return/enter key to trigger the search\r\n# Select save\r\n# a popup noting the save was successful will appear in the upper right corner of the active browser window\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nIt is expected that the Edited notation will go away noting the current filter displayed is correct without any pending edits needed to be saved before navigating from the page\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nWhile the filter is correctly saved it will still display the \"Edited\" object causing confusion to the end user that is not sure if the filter has actually saved correctly or not\r\n !Screen Shot 2019-10-14 at 10.59.02 AM.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nh3. Notes\r\nThe \"Edited\" notation is class \"filter-edited-object\"\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\nUsing the mouse click to search before saving will make the edited notation go away to provide verification the filter was saved, BUT it is not necessarily needed as the save action is completing and and a popup will note successful as well so the edited notation is only a cosmetic error,  But just to be on the save side you can also re-open the filter in a new tab just to verify the save was successful so you do not navigate away and loose track of the filter changes.",

Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nAny field tied to a timezone change will be affected.\r\n\r\nIt may also affect SLA for Service Desk issues.\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nOn October 20, it should keep GMT -3 for Sao Paulo's timezone.\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nIt will show the wrong information because the timezone will be GMT -2.\u00a0\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nChange the timezone manually to GMT -3 using another country's timezone, like Argentina (Buenos Aires).",
