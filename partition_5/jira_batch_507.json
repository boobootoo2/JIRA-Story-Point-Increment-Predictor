Trying to reproduce this today by following the documentation in [POST /rest/servicedeskapi/request|https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/service-desk/rest/#api-rest-servicedeskapi-request-post] I find this is not possible to do.  It appears that this endpoint is only working for users in the Agent role.  But the existing docs do not make it clear that being an agent is required here. (I understand it is required to be an Agent to use the RaiseOnBehalfOf parameter, but I'm not trying to use that one in this case).\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Create a classic Jira Service Desk project\r\n# Invite a customer to join that service desk (that is not currently in your Jira site)\r\n# Have the customer login to the customer portal successfully at least once to make sure it works and they can see the request types there\r\n# As a customer, create a REST API token for yourself as per [Basic auth for REST APIs|https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/service-desk/basic-auth-for-rest-apis/]\r\n# Try as a customer to create a request in that portal via the REST API using basic auth, this example uses curl {code:borderStyle=solid}\r\ncurl --request POST \\\r\n  --url 'https://[redacted].atlassian.net/rest/servicedeskapi/request' \\\r\n  --header 'Accept: application/json' \\\r\n  --header 'Authorization: Basic [redacted]' \\\r\n  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\r\n  --data '{\r\n  \"serviceDeskId\": \"2\",\r\n  \"requestTypeId\": \"17\",\r\n  \"requestFieldValues\": {\r\n    \"summary\": \"Request JSD help via REST\",\r\n    \"description\": \"Example description\"\r\n  }\r\n}' \r\n{code}\r\n\r\nh3.

This option is great because now it's not necessary to create automation or manually add the Request type after the ticket is created for customers to receive notifications, but not everyone wants to use this option.\r\n\r\nSome companies may use many Request types with the same name and it may be confusing for the Agent that is creating the ticket or the list is very long and it's necessary to scroll down to find the Issue types.\r\nh3. Issue creation experience\r\n\r\nWhen changing a request type, default values for fields are respected, but when changed to a request type without default values for that field, the previous request type's value stays.\r\n\r\nIf the Request/Issue type name is too long, it's not possible to view its entire name on the drop-down list.\r\nh2. Suggestions\r\nh3. Configurability\r\n\r\nTo give the administrator the right to deactivate this feature.\r\n\r\nTo give the administrator the possibility to display the issue types before the request types on this field.\r\n\r\nTo add the request type group name next to the request type in this field, without it impacting the request type name on the portal.\r\nh3. Issue creation experience\r\n\r\nBlank out fields without a default for a given request type, when that type is selected.

Issue Summary\r\n\r\nWith the new SLA system when an agent leave a public comment the comment is considered as *Comment: For Customer*, however, if the agent becomes a customer issue-level ( such as being request participant, member of an Organization the ticket is shared with, or an approver ) the comment will become *Comment: By Customer*. This is making the SLA to be recalculated and go to ongoing state, even if the SLA cycle was finished.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Have an SLA with the STOP condition as *Comment: For Customers* ( I used Time to first response SLA that had a START condition of Issue Created )\r\n# Create an issue that will trigger this SLA\r\n# Add a public comment as an agent\r\n# Add the agent as a customer issue-level ( such as being request participant, member of an Organization the ticket is shared with, or an approver )\r\n# Refresh the page\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nThe SLA will remain closed with the information of a single cycle related to the public comment of when the user was an agent.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nThe SLA goes to an ongoing state and another cycle is initiated. If another agent then leaves a public comment then there'll be 2 cycles for the SLA, even if the START event was Issue Created. It's possible to have multiple cycles for this SLA simply by adding the agents who made the public comment as request participants and then removing them. \r\n \r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nAdd all agents who are related to the STOP event of the cycles from this SLA as request participants ( to leave the SLA in an ongoing state ), then remove the agent who made the first public comment. With this, the SLA cycle that will display is the first one created. After that, you can remove the other agents from the request participant section.\r\n\r\nIt seems that if the SLA has around 9+ cycles it isn't possible to apply the workaround.\r\n\r\nh3. Note:\r\n\r\nAs this issue occurs when agents are added as customers to the tickets, to avoid this occurrence, consider adding the agents as [watchers|https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirasoftwarecloud/watch-share-and-comment-on-issues-962349057.html], once request participants is a feature to share requests with customers in a JSD project.\r\n",
