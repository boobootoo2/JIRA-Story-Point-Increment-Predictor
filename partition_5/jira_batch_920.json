      "description": "For all projects, the projects portlet sometimes displays links for Components and Versions, and sometimes doesn't. It displays them or otherwise based on whether the last project you looked at had Components or Versions.\r\n\r\nHere is how to reproduce the bug:\r\n\r\n1. Create a new JIRA instance.\r\n\r\n2. Create two projects.\r\n\r\n3. Add a component to one of the projects, but not the other.\r\n\r\n4. Make sure your dashboard contains the projects portlet (it does by default).\r\n\r\n5. Go to your dashboard.\r\n\r\n6. Click on any of the links in the project portlet for the project that contains a component.\r\n\r\n7. Go back to your dashboard (click Home).\r\n\r\nFor both the projects, the projects portlet will be displaying a Components link:\r\n\r\n!ShowingComponentsLink.png!\r\n\r\n6. Click on any of the links in the project portlet for the project that does not contain a component.\r\n\r\n7. Go back to your dashboard (click Home).\r\n\r\nFor both the projects, the projects portlet now will not be displaying a Components link:\r\n\r\n!NotShowingComponentsLinks.png!\r\n\r\nThe same behaviour occurs for versions. That is, the Versions link is displayed for all projects in the projects portlet if the last project accessed contained at least one version. If the last project accessed didn't have a version, the Version link will not be displayed for any projects.\r\n\r\nLooks like we are looking at the characteristics of the last project viewed to determine whether to display Components and Versions links, but incorrectly applying these settings to all projects.\r\n\r\nFirst reported by a customer in JRA-13782. Verified by me with the means of reproducing it that you see here.",

The optimize method in DefaultIndexManager will accquire index lock, all other changes (e.g. create, edit) won't get index lock until optimization done. In our case, optimization took 75517 ms, while the INDEX_LOCK_WAIT_TIME is only 30000 ms, that means, within about 45s after optimization started, any changes won't be indexed and definitely got index timed out exception.\r\nWe'll change INDEX_LOCK_WAIT_TIME to greater than 75517 ms, but I would like to suggest JIRA to be improved to enlarge or ignore INDEX_LOCK_WAIT_TIME when optimizing since for normal issue index, more than 75s should be recorded as an error, while not when optimizing.",

below.\r\n\r\nfrom http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/lucene-java-user/200612.mbox/%3c359a92830612270753x3d0e3511g634b8e9c145d4034@mail.gmail.com%3e\r\n\r\n{panel:title=\"excerpt from lucene mailing list\"}\r\nAlso, see the thread on this list titled \"I just don't get wildcards at all\"\r\nto see an extensive discussion of this issue, as well as wildcards in\r\ngeneral. You might also search the archive for wildcards. The short form is\r\nthat any wildcard (including prefix queries) expands under the covers to\r\ncreate a clause for each possible entry in the index for that field. For\r\ninstance, say a field had the following values:\r\n\r\nabcd\r\nabck\r\nabt\r\n\r\nSearching for ab* would expand to searching for ab, abck and abt under the\r\ncovers. When the number of possibilities gets above the default value of\r\n1024, you see a TooManyClauses exception. Expanding the number of clauses\r\n*may* fix you right up, but on any reasonably sized index, you can come up\r\nwith a query that'll exceed whatever number you set. Or you'll get to an\r\nunacceptable performance/memory footprint. Imagine your query with things\r\nlike a*\r\n\r\nThink seriously about how you're going to deal with this. There are several\r\noptions:\r\n1> use filters for all your wildcard clauses and create your own\r\nBooleanQuery. Be aware that using filters affects scoring.\r\n2> Assume that any query that throws a TooManyClauses exception (after\r\nyou've set a suitable max as Paul suggested) is too broad to be useful and\r\nrespond to the user with some polite phrase asking them to refine the query.\r\n3> Look over the SrndQuery classes. I don't fully understand these, but they\r\ncertainly behave much differently in this area. Note that SrndQuery limits\r\nwildcards to having at least three non-wildcard characters.\r\n4> Ask whether stemming is a complete or partial solution. Ditto for\r\nSoundex. There's a good chance these won't apply, but they may.\r\n5> <Insert the solution to your specific problem here>\r\n\r\nThis is a sticky wicket that will probably consume more time than you think\r\nto handle. It's easy for your product manager to claim that \"Of course, we\r\nmust support arbitrary wildcards\", but I'd urge you to seriously ask what\r\nvalue *arbitrary* wildcards bring to the product. When you start getting\r\nthousands of responses to a query, is it actually valuable to return them to\r\nthe user? Or do you give her just as much value (and deliver product sooner)\r\nby telling her up front that she's getting too many responses to be useful?\r\nWith this last strategy, you just catch the TooManyClauses exception and\r\nrespond with \"refine your query\".....\r\n\r\nBest\r\nErick\r\n\r\n\r\nOn 12/27/06, Paul Elschot <paul.elschot@xs4all.nl> wrote:\r\n>\r\n> Chris,\r\n>\r\n> On Wednesday 27 December 2006 15:42, Chris Salem wrote:\r\n> > Hi All,\r\n> >\r\n> > I'm getting a 'TooManyClauses' Exception and I'm not sure how to fix\r\n> this.\r\n> Here's a sample query that I'm using:\r\n> >\r\n> > +(+freeform_text:exhibit* +(+freeform_text:dispaly\r\n> +freeform_text:event*)\r\n> +(+freeform_text:sale* +freeform_text:sells +freeform_text:develop*)\r\n> +(+freeform_text:trade +freeform_text:show +freeform_text:trade\r\n> +freeform_text:shows)) +degree_type:5 +position_desired:ftp\r\n> +city:washington~0.5 +state:dc +ncountry:usa +last_modified:[2005-12-26 TO\r\n> 2006-12-26]\r\n> >\r\n> > Here's the exception I'm getting:\r\n> >\r\n> > org.apache.lucene.search.BooleanQuery$TooManyClauses\r\n> >  at org.apache.lucene.search.BooleanQuery.add(BooleanQuery.java:160)\r\n> >  at org.apache.lucene.search.BooleanQuery.add(BooleanQuery.java:151)\r\n> >  at org.apache.lucene.search.PrefixQuery.rewrite(PrefixQuery.java:52)\r\n>\r\n> One of the prefix queries is causing this, possibly event* or sale*.\r\n> Since they seem to be specific enough, increasing the maximum number\r\n> of boolean clauses that can be added to a boolean query appears to be\r\n> the good way to fix this, see BooleanQuery.setMaxClauseCount().\r\n>\r\n> Regards,\r\n> Paul Elschot\r\n>\r\n> >  at org.apache.lucene.search.BooleanQuery.rewrite(BooleanQuery.java:372)\r\n> >  at org.apache.lucene.search.BooleanQuery.rewrite(BooleanQuery.java:372)\r\n> >  at org.apache.lucene.search.BooleanQuery.rewrite(BooleanQuery.java:372)\r\n> >  at org.apache.lucene.search.IndexSearcher.rewrite(IndexSearcher.java\r\n> :137)\r\n> >  at org.apache.lucene.search.Query.weight(Query.java:93)\r\n> >  at org.apache.lucene.search.Hits.<init>(Hits.java:41)\r\n> >  at org.apache.lucene.search.Searcher.search(Searcher.java:44)\r\n> >  at org.apache.lucene.search.Searcher.search(Searcher.java:36)\r\n> >  at\r\n> net.mainsequence.pcr.lucene.LuceneHandler.multiSearch(LuceneHandler.java\r\n> :382)\r\n> >  at\r\n> net.mainsequence.pcr.lucene.LuceneServlet.searchIndex(LuceneServlet.java\r\n> :169)\r\n> >  at\r\n> net.mainsequence.pcr.lucene.LuceneServlet.processRequest(\r\n> LuceneServlet.java:83)\r\n> >  at net.mainsequence.pcr.lucene.LuceneServlet.doPost(LuceneServlet.java\r\n> :72)\r\n> >  at javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet.service(HttpServlet.java:709)\r\n> >  at javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet.service(HttpServlet.java:802)\r\n> >  at\r\n> org.apache.catalina.core.ApplicationFilterChain.internalDoFilter(\r\n> ApplicationFilterChain.java:252)\r\n> >  at\r\n> org.apache.catalina.core.ApplicationFilterChain.doFilter(\r\n> ApplicationFilterChain.java:173)\r\n> >  at\r\n> org.apache.catalina.core.StandardWrapperValve.invoke(\r\n> StandardWrapperValve.java:213)\r\n> >  at\r\n> org.apache.catalina.core.StandardContextValve.invoke(\r\n> StandardContextValve.java:178)\r\n> >  at\r\n> org.apache.catalina.core.StandardHostValve.invoke(StandardHostValve.java\r\n> :126)\r\n> >  at\r\n> org.apache.catalina.valves.ErrorReportValve.invoke(ErrorReportValve.java\r\n> :105)\r\n> >  at\r\n> org.apache.catalina.core.StandardEngineValve.invoke(\r\n> StandardEngineValve.java:107)\r\n> >  at\r\n> org.apache.catalina.connector.CoyoteAdapter.service(CoyoteAdapter.java\r\n> :148)\r\n> >  at\r\n> org.apache.coyote.http11.Http11Processor.process(Http11Processor.java:869)\r\n> >  at\r\n>\r\n> org.apache.coyote.http11.Http11BaseProtocol$Http11ConnectionHandler.processConnection\r\n> (Http11BaseProtocol.java:664)\r\n> >  at\r\n> org.apache.tomcat.util.net.PoolTcpEndpoint.processSocket(\r\n> PoolTcpEndpoint.java:527)\r\n> >  at\r\n> org.apache.tomcat.util.net.LeaderFollowerWorkerThread.runIt(\r\n> LeaderFollowerWorkerThread.java:80)\r\n> >  at\r\n> org.apache.tomcat.util.threads.ThreadPool$ControlRunnable.run(\r\n> ThreadPool.java:684)\r\n> >  at java.lang.Thread.run(Unknown Source)\r\n> >\r\n> > Is there anyway to increase the amount of clauses lucene can take?

Make sure that you are logged out of https://support.atlassian.com (a JIRA instance running over SSL).\r\n\r\n2. Click on the following link, which is the RSS feed for an issue filter that *has not* been saved:\r\n\r\nhttps://support.atlassian.com/sr/jira.issueviews:searchrequest-rss/temp/SearchRequest.xml?&query=field+level+security&summary=true&description=true&pid=10000&created%3Abefore=1%2FJun%2F04&tempMax=1000\r\n\r\nJIRA will return an empty RSS feed (even though some issues do match the filter), without prompting for credentials. Given that it is running over SSL, I would have thought that the browser would have prompted me for credentials. Intuitively, that is what I would expect.\r\n\r\n3. Try instead the following link, which is the RSS feed for an issue filter that *has* been saved:\r\n\r\nhttps://support.atlassian.com/sr/jira.issueviews:searchrequest-rss/11812/SearchRequest-11812.xml?tempMax=1000\r\n\r\nThe browser will in this case prompt for authentication, and after authenticating you will get the RSS feed for the matching set of issues.\r\n\r\n4. Go to https://support.atlassian.com and log out. Then close and restart Firefox.\r\n\r\n5. Try the following link, which is the one from step 2 (RSS feed from an unsaved filter), but with \"&os_authType=basic\" appended to the URL:\r\n\r\nhttps://support.atlassian.com/sr/jira.issueviews:searchrequest-rss/temp/SearchRequest.xml?&query=field+level+security&summary=true&description=true&pid=10000&created%3Abefore=1%2FJun%2F04&tempMax=1000&os_authType=basic\r\n\r\nThis time it does prompt you for credentials, and after authenticating you will get the RSS feed for the matching set of issues.\r\n\r\n(Note that for a JIRA instance not running over SSL but still requiring authentication, if you request an RSS feed without supplying an &os_authType=basic as part of the URL, you get an empty feed.)\r\n\r\nBack in step 3, when the feed was for a saved filter (without specifying \"&os_authType), after you have authenticated and received the feed, the URL in the browser is:\r\n\r\nhttps://support.atlassian.com/sr/jira.issueviews:searchrequest-rss/11812/SearchRequest-11812.xml?os_authType=basic\r\n\r\nNote the \"&os_authType=basic\" at the end. So it looks like a re-direction has happened in which we have specified that basic authentication is required, and that this re-direction does not happen if the RSS feed is for an unsaved filter.\r\n\r\nThis is confirmed by using Live Headers to look at the HTTP Headers for the request for the RSS feed for the saved filter. They include a 301 request. There is no such request in the headers for the unsaved filter RSS request.\r\n\r\n{noformat}\r\nhttps://support.atlassian.com/sr/jira.issueviews:searchrequest-rss/11812/SearchRequest-11812.xml?tempMax=1000\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGET /sr/jira.issueviews:searchrequest-rss/11812/SearchRequest-11812.xml?tempMax=1000 HTTP/1.1\r\n\r\nHost: support.atlassian.com\r\n\r\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux x86_64; en-US; rv:1.8.1.6) Gecko/20071008 Ubuntu/7.10 (gutsy) Firefox/2.0.0.6\r\n\r\nAccept: text/xml,application/xml,application/xhtml+xml,text/html;q=0.9,text/plain;q=0.8,image/png,*/*;q=0.5\r\n\r\nAccept-Language: en-us,en;q=0.5\r\n\r\nAccept-Encoding: gzip,deflate\r\n\r\nAccept-Charset: ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.7\r\n\r\nKeep-Alive: 300\r\n\r\nConnection: keep-alive\r\n\r\nCookie: jira.conglomerate.cookie=; JSESSIONID=aT9GpSjplOp98Hu8_x\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHTTP/1.x 301 Moved Permanently\r\n\r\nDate: Fri, 02 Nov 2007 05:59:57 GMT\r\n\r\nServer: Apache/2.0.52 (Red Hat)\r\n\r\nLocation: https://support.atlassian.com/sr/jira.issueviews:searchrequest-rss/11812/SearchRequest-11812.xml?os_authType=basic\r\n\r\nContent-Length: 0\r\n\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\n\r\nConnection: close\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nhttps://support.atlassian.com/sr/jira.issueviews:searchrequest-rss/11812/SearchRequest-11812.xml?os_authType=basic\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGET /sr/jira.issueviews:searchrequest-rss/11812/SearchRequest-11812.xml?os_authType=basic HTTP/1.1\r\n\r\nHost: support.atlassian.com\r\n\r\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux x86_64; en-US; rv:1.8.1.6) Gecko/20071008 Ubuntu/7.10 (gutsy) Firefox/2.0.0.6\r\n\r\nAccept: text/xml,application/xml,application/xhtml+xml,text/html;q=0.9,text/plain;q=0.8,image/png,*/*;q=0.5\r\n\r\nAccept-Language: en-us,en;q=0.5\r\n\r\nAccept-Encoding: gzip,deflate\r\n\r\nAccept-Charset: ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.7\r\n\r\nKeep-Alive: 300\r\n\r\nConnection: keep-alive\r\n\r\nCookie: jira.conglomerate.cookie=; JSESSIONID=aT9GpSjplOp98Hu8_x\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHTTP/1.x 401 Unauthorized\r\n\r\nDate: Fri, 02 Nov 2007 05:59:58 GMT\r\n\r\nServer: Apache/2.0.52 (Red Hat)\r\n\r\nWWW-Authenticate: BASIC realm=\"protected-area\"\r\n\r\nContent-Length: 0\r\n\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\n\r\nConnection: close\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nhttps://support.atlassian.com/sr/jira.issueviews:searchrequest-rss/11812/SearchRequest-11812.xml?os_authType=basic\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGET /sr/jira.issueviews:searchrequest-rss/11812/SearchRequest-11812.xml?os_authType=basic HTTP/1.1\r\n\r\nHost: support.atlassian.com\r\n\r\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux x86_64; en-US; rv:1.8.1.6) Gecko/20071008 Ubuntu/7.10 (gutsy) Firefox/2.0.0.6\r\n\r\nAccept: text/xml,application/xml,application/xhtml+xml,text/html;q=0.9,text/plain;q=0.8,image/png,*/*;q=0.5\r\n\r\nAccept-Language: en-us,en;q=0.5\r\n\r\nAccept-Encoding: gzip,deflate\r\n\r\nAccept-Charset: ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.7\r\n\r\nKeep-Alive: 300\r\n\r\nConnection: keep-alive\r\n\r\nCookie: jira.conglomerate.cookie=; JSESSIONID=aT9GpSjplOp98Hu8_x\r\n\r\nAuthorization: Basic aWRhbmllbDpIaWtXYWZhaQ==\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHTTP/1.x 200 OK\r\n\r\nDate: Fri, 02 Nov 2007 06:00:00 GMT\r\n\r\nServer: Apache/2.0.52 (Red Hat)\r\n\r\nCache-Control: no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate\r\n\r\nPragma: no-cache\r\n\r\nExpires: Wed, 31 Dec 1969 23:59:59 GMT\r\n\r\nContent-Type: text/xml;charset=UTF-8\r\n\r\nConnection: close\r\n\r\nTransfer-Encoding: chunked\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nI got the same results in the following feed readers:\r\n- Internet Explorer\r\n- Thunderbird\r\n- Feedreader (http://www.feedreader.com)\r\n\r\nThe issue is much more significant for non-browser-based feed readers (e.g. Thunderbird and Feedreader), since for browsers, when you click on the link for an RSS feed from JIRA, it is usually from within JIRA, in which case you will have authenticated already.\r\n\r\n(I was unable to test this in Outlook 2007, as I cannot get a JIRA RSS feed running over SSL working in Outlook 2007. This may or may not be a  bug. I need to do more testing.)\r\n\r\nI got the same results when using a support customer's Internet-facing JIRA instance running over SSL.\r\n\r\nSo, I think it is a bug, because intuitively, if I enter a URL for a web site that is running over SSL, and I have not authenticated yet, I expect to be prompted for authentication, either in a web page (form-based authentication), or with the browser (or feed reader) prompting me (basic authentication).\r\n\r\nIf you end up deciding that is is not a bug, however, we need to update our documentation - the *Accessing protected data* section of http://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/docs/latest/navigatorviews.html - to indicate that, even if running over SSL, you should append the \"&os_authType=basic\" if your RSS feed is for an unsaved filter. Or we could say to always do it, including when running over SSL.\r\n",

This leads to the following problem.\r\n\r\nIf data is imported into JIRA from some other system (in our case it's TrackGear, via csv importer), users are created automatically, and passwords for them are not set. As a result, once import is complete, you may have hundreds of users in the database with no passwords - this means that they cannot login anyway until passwords for them are explicitly set. This is hundreds of manual password set operations used for one thing only - to let the user do his first login and then possibly change his password.\r\n\r\nIf the system either allowed users with blank passwords to login, or provided a bulk password set functionality, it would solve the problem.",
