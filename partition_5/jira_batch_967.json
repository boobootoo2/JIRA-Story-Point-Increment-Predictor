We can do this in several ways:\n- alllow to cofnigure field defualts per screen\n- introduce a new plugin type that is called before each screen initialisation\n- allow to supply javascript that runs on screen load\n\nFor a sample use case see JRA-7456",

Version x ships and is eventually archived.\n  3. A month later, bug is reopened on a new version - it's a regression.\n  4. Test lead wants to update the version in the issue to point at the new version - it doesn't work!\n\nHere's what happens: editing \"Affects Version\" simply adds the new version, but there is no ability to remove the old version. The only workaround is to temporarily unarchive that version so it shows up in the listbox, then edit again, deselect and save, then archive the version again.\n\nI'm not sure what a good solution is. It's nice not having those archived versions showing up in the listbox. And if we pick a new version some people may want the archived version removed (as I do), whereas others may think it should be added.",

Frustrating as anything - that one is -- I hope it's really fixed in 3.3.\n\nAnyway, within Excel I used to be able to get around that by removing the picture and lines 1-6 and the last line (generated by...) leaving only a header row and the data. Now, I get an error from Excel when I try to sort:\n\"This operation requires the merged cells to be identically sized.\"\nhttp://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;813974\n\nAfter some research, it appears that the \"Components\" column is the source of the trouble - I never used that column before. It creates an additional row for each issue that applies to more than one component.\nDo you have any suggestions as to how to easily unmerge the cells as a workaround? And would you agree, this is not desirable behaviour in the first place?\nI've attached a sample excel report produced from the test project.

We highly value your feedback in all forms, and through suggestions in jira.atlassian.com is not different. We use this channel often to learn the best we can with how customers use JIRA and how we can continue to improve the experience for as many users as possible.\r\n\r\nWe have revisited this issue again recently and wanted to reiterate that there are still currently no plans to implement this suggestion, and it is not currently on any JIRA team\u2019s roadmap at this stage.\r\n\r\nPlease remember that jira.atlassian.com is one of many inputs for the JIRA roadmap. You can [learn more about our process here|https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/110373/how-does-the-jira-team-use-jira-atlassian-com].\r\n\r\nI understand that our decision may be disappointing. Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.\r\n\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nKerrod Williams\r\nKerrod (dot) Williams (at) atlassian (dot) com\r\nProduct Manager, JIRA\r\n\r\n{panel}\r\nIt would be useful if the backup service had an option to delete backups older than X days.

At daytime everything works fine, but at the next morning we are not able to connect via the web interface. The jira java process \n(tomcat) is still running and background processes, like CVS is still up and running. But all tomcat applications are not responding. Also we installed the manager and admin application on the tomcat. \nBut there are also not responding at next morning. So every morning we need to restart the tomcat server. We increased the number of http connectors but it doesn't worked. We switched the SQL Server\nconnection to another server, but it also doesn't worked.\nDo you have any suggestion about this problem?\n\nBest regards \nJ\u00f6rg Pl\u00fcmacher\n\n\nOrganisation  ORAYLIS GmbH  \nDate Purchased  24.07.05  \nLicense Type  JIRA Professional: Commercial Server  \nSupport Period  Your commercial JIRA support and updates are available until 25.07.06.  \n\n--Professional Edition, Version: 3.2.2-#",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-7475].\n  {panel}\n\nI'd like to be able to edit screens and show a field, yet not let it be editable. For example, I want to set a policy here that certain fields, once created, can never be changed (such as description and original estimate). Yet when editing a bug (or on other screens, like assign-to), I want those fields to still show up so the user has some context.\n\nFor implementation, I was thinking something really simple. The screen editor has a table with Position, Name, and Remove. This feature could be implemented by just adding another column of checkboxes after Name called Read-Only. Then the screen renderer can decide whether or not to make something editable by checking this flag.",

Your feedback is key to helping us understand how you use JIRA so we can continue improving your experience. We have reviewed this issue over the last few days; however there are not currently any plans to implement this suggestion.\r\n\r\nPlease remember that jira.atlassian.com is one of many inputs for the JIRA roadmap. You can [learn more about our process here|https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/110373/how-does-the-jira-team-use-jira-atlassian-com].\r\n\r\nI understand that our decision may be disappointing. Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nOtto Ruettinger\r\nPrincipal Product Manager, JIRA\r\noruettinger (at) atlassian (dot) com\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\nWe have different customers using our JIRA-Enterprise instance.\r\n\r\nIf we activate the user browser on the find issues screen, all users appear in the browser.\r\n\r\nThis is a problem for us, because users from customer company A can see users from customer company B.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if only users are displayed which have access to the projects the current user has access to.",
