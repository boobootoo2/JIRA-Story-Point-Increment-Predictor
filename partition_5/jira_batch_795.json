Summary\r\n\r\nWhen Creating a new issue, a button is presented that allows users to 'Configure Fields', which allows the user to show a customised sub-set of the fields that have been configured for the Create issue Screen. This functionality is further described in: [Creating an Issue|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Creating+an+Issue]\r\n\r\nThe expectation is that Required Fields are *never* hidden from the user. Some circumstances allow for Users to hide required custom fields. \r\n\r\nThis functionality of hiding fields can not be easily disabled as per: [JRA-27707|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRA-27707]\r\n\r\nMost Fields appear to function in an expected manner. \r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Environment\r\n- This behaviour was observed on a new JIRA 6.4.9 instance without any custom Add-ons installed.\r\n- The Browser used to access the JIRA instance was: Google Chrome: 44.0.2403.130.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Create a custom field (Checkbox type is a good example) and add it to the Create Issue Screen.\r\n# Create a new project using the modal style create an issue. \r\n# Observe that the user is able to customise the Fields being shown. It is possible to hide a required field (checkbox type)\r\n!checkbox02.png|thumbnail!\r\n# When the user attempts to submit the form, if the required field does not have a value, it is shown when the hidden field fails to validate.\r\n!checkbox03.png|thumbnail!\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nIf a field is required, it should not be possible for a user to hide the filed.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nIt is currently possible to hide required fields as per the screenshot below.\r\n\r\nh3. Notes\r\n# The field is shown if it does not have a value on attempting to create the issue.\r\n# The Fields can not be configured if the user is not using the Create issue Dialog box.\r\n# In my testing, using JIRA 6.4.9: I was unable to observe this behaviour with the following field types:\r\n#- Select\r\n#- Text Area\r\n#- Label\r\n#- Date\r\n#- Date Time\r\n#- Number\r\n#- Multi-line text area.\r\n# In my testing, using JIRA 6.4.9: Was able to observe this issue with:\r\n#- Checkbox\r\n",

If the user was in the context of a saved filter, it would be helpful if the bulk edit steps showed the name of the filter in the title area.\r\n\r\nFor example, we have queries for each customer - thus, numerous queries. We use the bulk edit for customer assignments. Sometimes, you forget what query you just went into to update; however, having the query name would provide us a clue as to the context of the few pages of issues we are working with.\r\n{quote}",
