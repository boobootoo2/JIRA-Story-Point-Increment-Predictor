Problem\r\n\r\nWhen working in Jira, a project avatar is one common way that admins will customize to help users quickly sort through to identify what project they are working in. When you then have to switch applications to Confluence or alike, there is no means to automatically use the same custom avatar icon for that linked space. This can cause confusion or delays until users can be sure they are working in the correct space/project\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nIt would be awesome if when you link a Jira Project to a Confluence space, if Jira would prompt you to sync the avatar between these two. Granted, it would be understood that the user creating this link would need to have admin rights in both applications likely, and there might be a question of which avatar to use when initiating the sync. However to be able to do this automatically for admins would be really helpful in making it very clear to end users which content is linked to what other content.\r\nh3. Note:\r\n\r\nThis suggestion does not seek to sync avatars of user objects.\u00a0 Just that between spaces and projects.",

editing default values, or when you're looking at the field values at creation or editing an issue. Check the database for the defaults, with the workaround below.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\nFor finding invalid default values, use the following SQL to identify them in the database:\r\n\r\n{code}\r\nSELECT customfield.id as cfid, customfield.customfieldtypekey, customfield.cfname, genericconfiguration.*\r\nFROM customfield\r\nJOIN fieldconfiguration ON fieldconfiguration.fieldid = 'customfield_'||customfield.id\r\nJOIN genericconfiguration ON genericconfiguration.datakey = CAST (fieldconfiguration.id as varchar(60))\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nThen, you can edit the field from Jira Admin > Issues > Custom Fields > Configure (and update the field in question).\r\n\r\nIdentifying issues with an invalid stored value can be accomplished with the following SQL:\r\n{code}\r\nSELECT concat(p.pkey, '-', ji.issuenum), cf.cfname, cf.customfieldtypekey, cfv.stringvalue, cfv.numbervalue, cfv.textvalue, cfv.datevalue, cfv.valuetype\r\nFROM jiraissue ji\r\nJOIN project p ON ji.project = p.id\r\nJOIN customfieldvalue cfv ON ji.id = cfv.issue\r\nJOIN customfield cf ON cfv.customfield = cf.id\r\nWHERE cf.cfname = '<Name of your custom field>'\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nWith the issues identified, you can either update those issues via the bulk tools, REST API or database. Please note that database edits are not supported. In the event a database edit is required, please ensure you've got a full database backup, Jira is offline, and that you attempt your changes on a staging server before applying to production.",

Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Have a project with enough issues in a sprint, let's say 40 issues\r\n # Go to the Reports page, and select Burndown Chart. It will show the chart, and below a list of the issues in the sprint selected and it's event status.\r\n # Right-click on the page\r\n # Select option \"Print\"\r\n\r\nh3.

Problem Definition\r\nAt the moment, to integrate JIRA Data Center with SAML, the required configuration is to have the same DC Instance connected to the same directory that the IdP is connected to. Hence, JIRA needs to be connected to the IdP and the directory at the same time. If it is not, JIRA would not be able to detect which user is currently authenticating through SAML until the user is registered.\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\nRather than connected to both, for JIRA to only connect to IdP and automatically sync the users from it so it will be easier. This appears to be available for our Cloud service as in [ACCESS-33|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/ACCESS-33] which will be great if Server has it as well.\r\n",

So I believe Atlassian could add to that framework a way for the Add-on Apps to record what they consider an instant of usage, and then record that usage to the usage area of the framework. From which Atlassian could then easily publish usage of each Add-on.\r\n\r\nFor example, when I go the \"Manage apps\" link, the Atlassian Add-on Framework could show the number of users using this app in the last month, week, day, or hour etc, that each application has passed back to it.

Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Create more than 50 users with similar names. Example:\r\n#* PersonA\r\n#* PersonB\r\n#* PersonC\r\n#* PersonD\r\n#* ...\r\n#* PersonXXX\r\n# Go to Issue View, and trigger Autocomplete by typing PersonXX\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nAutocomplete returns a suggestion which is PersonXXX.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nAutocomplete returns \"No Match\".\r\n\r\nh3. Notes\r\nThe problem happens because the Autocomplete REST API call to retrieve the user suggestions limits searches to 50 results as seen from the request URL below.\r\n{code}\r\nhttp://localhost:8080/rest/api/latest/user/assignable/search?username=lenard&projectKeys=TEST&issueKey=TEST-25&maxResults=50&startAt=0&_=1556885033278\r\n{code}\r\nAutocomplete works as expected and suggests the user if the user is within the first 50 results, sorted alphabetically. However, it returns \"No Match\" if the name is outside the first 50.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nCurrently, there is no known workaround for this behavior. A workaround will be added here when available",

The purpose behind pagination is also to improve on Performance whereby loading of items are limited.\r\n\r\n*Suggestion*\r\nMost modern graphical user interfaces are using _Built-in Interactive Search_ which can be a better way instead of _pagination_. A search function would be able to return accurate results quicker instead of having the person to click on pages based on \"guesses\" on where the items are. \r\n\r\nIf _pagination_ is still the way to go, then at least implement a global setting which defines the maximum number of entries one sees per page.\r\n\r\nP.S: This might be a good source of reading, https://www.nngroup.com/articles/item-list-view-all/\r\n",

One of the challenges of implementing a workaround for this at proxy/network environment level is that the REST API URL patterns for the public API are also often used by requests triggered from the UI. So there is a risk of blocking normal UI based requests while intending to block remote API calls.\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\nOne way to constrain remote API usage to some extent may be to limit or restrict the use of basic auth for REST API. Provide facility or configuration to restrict basic authentication requests to whitelisted IPs.",
