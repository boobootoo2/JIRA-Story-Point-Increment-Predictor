From here you can Edit, reaching the same screen as in #2.\r\n\r\nThere are two problems. First is the inconsistent naming between these, Screen vs. Transition View.\r\n\r\nSecond, using the Default Classic Workflow, we can see that there's a disconnect between these two fields (Screen and Transition View). Using method #2, edit the Close transition and note that the Transition View is the Resolve screen. Then use method #1 to edit the Close transition and note that the Screen is None.\r\n\r\nIf you change the screen using method #1 from None to Default Screen, save it, then edit the transition using method #2, you will see that the Transition View has been changed to Default Screen.\r\n\r\nThis confirms that both Screen and Transition View are the same, but for some reason, the editing window provided by Diagram Mode isn't always displaying the same data as the Text mode.\r\n\r\nThis affects previous versions of JIRA as well (back to 6.3.5 at least).",

If the user is moved to a different node, their login credentials are lost. Unless 'Remember me' is selected, users will have to log in again. This is a nuisance for customers that are using Data Center, as their users likely have not checked that box (as it isn't checked by default), and can precipitate multiple logins for their users.\r\n\r\nh3.

Problem Definition\r\n\r\nWhen Admin user renames Project and Project Key in JIRA there are a few places where the user must also edit fields in order to keep the naming convention the same across a JIRA instance. \r\n\r\nFor example, if a user has a Screens named: ABC: Default Screen Scheme, once the Project name and Key has have been changed to XYZ, the Screen name will no update automatically. \r\n\r\nThere is no smart logic that will recognize these text fields and update the related scheme names. Below is the list of fields that *may* need to be corrected after a project title/key change. \r\n\r\n* Issue Types Schemes Titles\r\n* Workflow Schemes Titles\r\n* Screens Schemes Titles\r\n* Permission Schemes Titles\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nCreate way to change Scheme Titles upon a Project Name/Key change. This will reduce the amount of manual edits the Admin user will need to make. This will also prevent confusion from legacy project keys and titles in the future. \r\n \r\nh3. Workaround \r\n\r\nUser must edit the text field manually after changing values for Project Key/Project Name via  JIRA Administration. ",

We have identified the root cause of this issue and a fix has already been deployed to JIRA Cloud production. The fix has been deployed to all instances. \r\n\r\nAt this point we consider this issue resolved. If you have any questions, please contact Atlassian Support.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nOswaldo Hern\u00e1ndez. \r\nJIRA Bugmaster.\r\n[Atlassian].\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\nh3. Summary\r\n\r\nAfter the upgrade in JIRA on Jan/3/2016, several customers were having a long delay in JIRA Incoming Email Handlers. Which didn't seem to be running.\r\n\r\nAfter analysis, we found that a code change that inadvertently bypassed some bridging code that existed between JIRA's current scheduled job parameter format and the format that existed pre JIRA 7.0.  As a result, schedules that have not been modified since before 7.0 was deployed may not be read correctly by the scheduler.\r\n\r\nEditing the service to some other delay and back to '1' rests the Service and fixes the issue:\r\n!minute_service.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\nAfter upgrade, some scheduled jobs are not running.  The Scheduler details page shows that the jobs parameters could not be read.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nRemain running as scheduled.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nAffected jobs do not run.\r\n\r\nh3.Workaround\r\n# In the Services (https://instance.atlassian.net/secure/admin/ViewServices!default.jspa) page, find the affected job.\r\n# Go to the Incoming Email page\r\n# Edit the Mail Handler\r\n# Set the delay to the desired interval the handler should be executed (in minutes).\r\nIf the value is already set to 1, simply click on *Next* and *Save*.\r\n# Check in Services page if the Service related to that was update correctly.

Proposed Solution\r\n*Email Based on Saved Filters*\r\nUsers already have the ability to write a query and save it as a filter. As an added feature, it would be nice to have a mail icon to specify email settings associated with that filter (see below).\r\n\r\n_Proposed Mail Icons_\r\n!Mail Settings.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nIn the Proposed Mail Icons (above), each color means something different:\r\n* *{color:red}Red{color}* - No Email Preferences Configured / Do Not Send Me Email\r\n* *{color:#14892c}Green{color}* - Email Preferences are Configured\r\n\r\n*Activity Stream Style Settings*\r\nIn the Activity Stream, a user can setup certain filters. For example:\r\n\r\n_Activity Stream Settings_\r\n!Activity Stream Preferences.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nI propose that if a user clicks the mail icon, then a similar menu appears. In this menu, users specifies one or more of the reasons to send a JIRA email. For Example, if a\\(n):\r\n* Comment is added\r\n* Issue Created\r\n* Issue Closed\r\n* Issue is transitioned\r\n* Issue Updated (field modified)\r\n\r\nWith this feature, a user can specify the JIRA emails that they get based on the saved filter.\r\n\r\n*Display Options*\r\nCustom fields are an important part of JIRA. Users will need the ability to specify which fields they want displayed in each email. ",

In this webhook, write a JQL query as: * issuekey=\"AS-1\" AND status changed FROM \"In Review\" TO \"Done\"* and tick mark the 'updated' checkbox under the *Issue* heading. \r\n# Create a workflow, (for example like: Create -> InProgress -> InReview -> Done)\r\n# In the transition from InReview to Done, attach the webhook as a post function\r\n# Create a workflow scheme, add the workflow created in above step to this workflow scheme\r\n# Associate this workflow scheme to the project\r\n\r\nNow, go to the issue, change the state from InProgress to InReview and then from InReview to Done. Since the webhook is attached to  the transition from InReview to Done, this fires the webhook. Again go to the respective issue and change its priority from Low to High, for example or add a comment to the issue. This will fire the webhook. So, basically any update in that issue, fires the webhook. The requirement is to make the webhook fire only when transition changes from InReview to Done and no other event/action.\r\n\r\nNow, if you edit the webhook and untick the issue-updated checkbox and then repeat the steps mentioned above (first changing transition from InReview to Done, then updating any field in the issue), the webhook isnt fired.\r\n\r\nSo basically, we are unable to achieve the requirement, which is to create a webhook which should fire only on one event, i.e. a transition change, and it should not fire on any other  action/event/change in the issue. \r\n\r\nI couldnt devise a solution for this, even with JQL. Please look into this scenario and acknowledge back if its possible to achieve it in JIRA v6.4.12.\r\n\r\nAlso you can find attached a bit more detailed document with this post.\r\n\r\nThanks & Regards,\r\nAshish",

Problem Definition\r\n\r\nAs a manager I want to be able to filter all the issues related to a specific Epic. Right now it is not possible to filter the subtasks without using a third party for this purpose. I believe this is a common need and should be added to JIRA Standard JQL search.\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nCreate a function to return all issues related to Epic, like the one provided by tempo {{parent in tempoEpicIssues(XXX-####, YYY-###, ZZZ-####)}}.\r\n This would allow searchs like: {{\"Epic Link\" in (XXX-####, YYY-###, ZZZ-####) OR parent in tempoEpicIssues(XXX-####, YYY-###, ZZZ-####)}}.\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nInstall and add-on to provide the list of issues in a given Epic so the above suggestion can be used.\r\n This thread talks about some options: [JQL to show all issues AND subtasks in the Epic|https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/177329/jql-to-show-all-issues-and-subtasks-in-the-epic].",

However, these values cannot be set during version creation. As with the UI, a version has to go through stages, where it first will have to be created. Then a created version can be *released* and then a *released* version may be *Archived*. Therefore this customer can only create with the above REST API. They will have to use the update REST call to update the version to released and then again to archive. \r\n#* User should either pass  \"releaseDate\" or \"userReleaseDate\", not both.\r\n# https://docs.atlassian.com/jira/REST/latest/#api/2/issue-editIssue\r\n#* As explained in this JAC comment: https://support.atlassian.com/browse/JSP-224338?focusedCommentId=5839137&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-583913, clarify the process of updating fixVersions using the above REST API.\r\n\r\nh3.
