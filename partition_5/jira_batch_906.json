[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-15851].\n  {panel}\n\nI have struggled with installing JIRA on solaris for almost the whole week. I came very close to giving up. I am going to have a go at doing it on Windoze using the standalone JIRA version first. I have found that there is alot more documentation on this. Plus there is a nice windoze install wizard that seems to take you from start to finish. I have high hopes about this.\r\n\r\nSo my enhancement request is, please provide an install GUI for Unix.\r\n\r\nI realise that every Unix machine is different, this may mean that the GUI has to prompt for all sorts of things that are not needed on windoze. But IMO it should still be doable. I also realise it is a pain to have to develop such GUIs because there is no standard infrastructure/machinery for installing stuff on Unix. But the pain I have experienced trying to get JIRA working on solaris is the most amount of pain I have ever experienced setting up software on Unix. Googling just revealed other people experiencing similar amounts of pain in similar areas. Hopefully a nice GUI would make that pain go away.\r\n\r\nLinux is slowly moving to install GUIs for complex software. Consider how the kernel or X11 is configured. Although it can be done by editing ASCII config files most people do it through a GUI these days. Over time I think more and more linux software will come with a GUI installer.\r\n\r\nI said all this in the JIRA forum and the response was that I should raise an enhancement issue, so here it is. Note that I did eventually get it working on solaris.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nAndrew Marlow \r\n",

      "description": "Presently all attachments fall into a single attachment bucket.  It would be more useful if these attachments could be related to a custom field so that they could be properly organized in the field / screen layout.\r\n\r\nFor example, Description Attachments would be used to describe the problem, possibly w/ screenshots.  Other attachments such as Design/Analysis attachments, Test Steps attachments, and Test Result attachments would all be useful attachment fields.  Having these as custom fields, users can more easily hide and show the relevant attachments for the proper audience on the separate screens/tabs.  Right now although the screen/tab configuration helps do this with normal fields, all of the attachments appear in one location only.  \r\n\r\nThe benefit is that supporting this in the native custom fields, users can more easily customize their existing fields.

This handler processes email message with a PROJECT_B-1234 issue key in message subject. So, handler adds this message as a comment for the PROJECT_B-1234 issue instead of creating a new ticket for the project PROJECT_A. \r\nIs this a correct flow? Is there any way to change the handler behavior via some configuration parameters (without changing of the Jira source code)?\r\nThanks.",

This validation could also be dependent on Priority and Issue Type, so a Critical issue wouldn't have this limitation.  \r\n\r\nI would want the flexibility to use different validations based on the project, issue type, priority, and possibly other factors (haven't yet determined if any others would apply).

Please review this list and contact me if there are any issues in regards to the content within this list.\r\n\r\nNote that some of the corrections listed within this table links to other issues which I have raised (JRA-15735 and JRA-15699).\r\n\r\nThe most problematic ones from what I have noticed are:\r\n1. \"with open issues due to be fixed per version\" - which is not translated within the Japanese language pack\r\n2. \"A change log of the recent versions for this project \" - which was caused by an error in the i18 parameter name within the com\\atlassian\\jira\\plugins\\projectpanels\\changelog_ja_JP.properties file, the properties should be projectpanels.changelog.description and projectpanels.changelog.name as opposed to componentpanels.changelog.description and componentpanels.changelog.name\r\n\r\nWe are currently working on modifying the Japanese language pack as an interim fix that includes the changes detailed in this issue while we wait for the official fixes.",

So as to reduce this problem, we would like to hide the Issue Security field using the Field Configurations administration page.  (Using the Field Configurations administration page is less work and far more preferable to customizing JIRA's webwork source code.)\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, when the Issue Security field is hidden in the Field Configurations administration page, issues that should have otherwise been assigned a security level of Reporter and Internal Staff by default are instead created with no security level.  Showing the Issue Security field restores proper function by having newly created issues assigned a security level of Reporter and Internal Staff.\r\n\r\nI fear that this problem may also affect other hidden fields created to maintain internal information that we would choose not to show to end users.",

Additionally, giving a group that jroper is in use permissions is not an option, because that means when users sign up, they will automatically be added to that group (why????  what does the list of groups that have use permission have to do with default groups for a new user?), but in this case, JIRA is using extranet crowd, and so new sign ups go into a different directory to the directory that jroper came from (atlassian staff), and so new sign ups will fail because the groups in the atlassian staff directory don't exist on the external directory.",
