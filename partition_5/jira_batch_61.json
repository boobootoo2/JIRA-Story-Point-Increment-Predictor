The new project gets a new version number and that gets a tag. The problem is that all of the tags from the previous versions of the base project are still around and clobber the tag namespace.\r\n\r\nGit has an option to take care of this issue: `git remote add --no-tags base /path/to/base.repo.git`. I however cannot find a way to do this in SourceTree without manually opening the repo's config and adding `tagopt = --no-tags` to `[remote \"base\"]`.

Restarting SourceTree solves the issue (temporarily). I noticed that the latest SourceTree version 1.6.22.0 still downloads the 1.9.5 preview version when I try switching to  Embedded Git.\r\n\r\nSo, is this an incompatibility issue of SourceTree with Git-for-Windows 2.x? A Fix really would be appreciated since having to restart SourceTree gets quite annoying. The issue exists on multiple machines in our company.",
