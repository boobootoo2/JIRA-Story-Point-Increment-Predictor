[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-24348].\n  {panel}\n\nIn the way we've structured JIRA issues we have 'block' links mapping the progression of a project.\r\n\r\nFor instance:\r\nPlanning issue blocks Development issue\r\nDevelopment issue blocks QA issue\r\nQA issue blocks Launch issue\r\n\r\nThe feature i'm looking for is someway for the assignee of the blocked issue to be notified when the blocking issue is resolved (or closed), so they know they can start work.\r\n\r\nCurrently I know of no way for the assignee of the blocked issue to get a notification when the blocking issue is resolved (or closed). The only way I know to do this is for the person to watch the issue, but that creates too much information flow, the assignee of the blocked issue just needs to know when they can start working (blocking issue is resolved or closed).\r\n\r\nI'm not sure the best way to do this, so I'm open to your suggestions.\r\nIf anyone has found workarounds or there are plugins out there, please post those too.\r\n\r\nThanks,",

There are project admins for each of the projects and the set of developers per project are explicitly maintained. Every now and then - it happens that one of our project admins assigns jira-users to some of the project roles (usually Developers), which leads to the result that all of our users start getting mail notifications for issues created in the corresponding project. \r\nI see several ways to solve that and am looking for your guidance on how to resolve the problem:\r\n- assignment of particular groups to particular roles is restricted (somehow - probably a flag per group, whether it's \"assignable\").\r\n- allow to filter out notifications and send them only to individually assigned users and not to groups (can be a general setting to disable traversal of groups) - will work for our environment\r\n\r\nThe root cause of the problem is of course the lack of experience of the project admins, however on the contrary - it's quite easy for them to make a mistake and we must protect the system from being so fragile and open for abuse. \r\n\r\nthanks in advance.

We have reviewed this issue over the last few days; however there are not currently any plans to implement this suggestion.\r\n\r\nPlease remember that jira.atlassian.com is one of many inputs for the JIRA roadmap. You can [learn more about our process here|https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/110373/how-does-the-jira-team-use-jira-atlassian-com].\r\n\r\nI understand that our decision may be disappointing. Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.\r\n\r\nGracias,\r\nOtto Ruettinger\r\nPrincipal Product Manager, JIRA\r\noruettinger (at) atlassian (dot) com\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\n\\\\\r\n\r\n*Original description*\r\nSimilar to CONF-21982 it would be desirable to have the ability to retrieve LDAP properties for users.\r\n\r\nWe are using JIRA as a help desk system and have attached it to a Windows Active Directory LDAP server with a plug-in (https://plugins.atlassian.com/plugin/details/16524). The plug-in implements com.opensymphony.user.provider.CredentialsProvider, is able to authenticate the user, add group memberships and store custom user properties as PropertySet attributes in the JIRA database.\r\n\r\nThe custom properties are necessary for our support team and are displayed on the user profile and issue screen (ie. for phone dialing without using an external phone book application).\r\n\r\nWith JIRA 4.3 there is a possiblity to switch to the provided LDAP integration, but there seems to be no way to retrieve additional LDAP properties.\r\n\r\nWe have also investigated in using a separate Crowd installation and delegating user security to Crowd. It is possible to create user defined user and group properties in Crowd but these properties are not synchronized into the JIRA database.",

      "description": "In bigger companies several business reasons exist that will force you to have more than one Jira instance running. Often there are dependencies between the different instances so a transfer of an existing isse from one instance to the other will be necessary to avoid duplicate work for the employees. This transfer should run on a scheduled base and as well synch changes to the orginal issue to the \"cloned\" one.\r\n\r\nI see that I'm not the first asking for this and some requests seem to be from a long time ago. Most of them are asking for a possibility to link issues between different interfaces but this would be solved by my proposel as well.\r\n\r\nHaving in mind what the external import does already provide, the changes to it would be pretty small I guess. The mapping logic that lets you choose the destination issue type and the fields is already there. So the input should not come from an excel file but from a separate Jira instance. The selection for \"what to be transported\" could be a kind of \"public\" search for issue query for example (one the other instance). The new thing would be the making use of what you already provide + some kind of scheduling module which manages the query results (= jobs, more than one of course) and execute it scheduled (seperate settings per job). The direction would be always this one: have the job on the receiver side. A synchronization of the issue might as well be a complete transfer for example (if that saves you development time).\r\n\r\nPlease let me know what you think about this. Hoping for votes would be waste I guess (as I took a look into the number of open requests, so hard for customers to scan them all I would say).",
