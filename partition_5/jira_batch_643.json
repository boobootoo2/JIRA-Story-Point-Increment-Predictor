Your input in the comments helps us understand how your teams work and what you're hoping to accomplish with JIRA.\r\n\r\nWe have decided to close this specific request for _additional status categories_ as Won't Fix. The finite set of status categories allows us to build useful features on top of them, like completion progress indicators for Epics and Versions.\r\n\r\nWe recognize that for many teams, most of the steps in a workflow are \"In Progress\" and that it can be difficult to distinguish them. Here are some strategies:\r\n* Add additional columns to your board for different workflow states. You can have several \"In Progress\" columns to represent concepts like \"In Development\" or \"Under Review\".\r\n* Use the card colors based on JQL queries feature ([documentation|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/AGILE/Customising+Cards#CustomisingCards-colours]) to define your own colors for workflow states. I've created this suggestion in the JIRA Agile project to improve this in the future: GHS-11666\r\n* Use JIRA Agile card layouts (new in JIRA Agile 6.6) to show the workflow state on the card ([documentation|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/AGILE/Customising+Cards#CustomisingCards-fields])\r\n* To customize the display of issues within the JIRA issue navigator, consider the free third-party [icnavigator add-on|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/de.iconcept.icnavigator.jira-icnavigator] from Interconcept GmbH.\r\n\r\nWe do not plan to support arbitrary colors for status categories. The mapping of blue, yellow, and green to \"To Do\", \"In Progress\", and \"Done\" is part of [Atlassian's overall visual system|https://design.atlassian.com/latest/product/components/lozenges/]. Our intent is to improve how we use this pattern to communicate information in JIRA; however, we use the combination of colors and lozenges to represent concepts not only in JIRA, but across Atlassian's product suite.\r\n\r\nFinally, there were specific requests for a \"Red\" status color. The main use case here was situations where an issue had progressed to the end of a workflow, but the resolution was negative (e.g. \"Failed\" instead of \"Done\"). In JIRA's structure, this connects the final workflow state (i.e. \"Resolved\") with the type of resolution. While there's certainly merit in this request, it has the potential to significantly increase JIRA's complexity.\r\n\r\nI understand that our decision may be disappointing. Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nDave Meyer\r\nJIRA Product Manager\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\nThe new status colors in JIRA provides initial set of pre-defined statues. It would also be beneficial to add the ability for users to add more categories to it",

Suggested Solution\r\nAt the end of that documentation it says that \"_Atlassian accounts cannot be managed via public APIs today. We are currently evaluating how best to expose these capabilities in a secure manner that best meets our customers' use cases._\"\r\nThis request is to track the re-implementation of such endpoint.\r\nh3.

Problem Definition\r\nAt the moment, Linking between epics and story (or epic and initiave) requires Edit issue permission for both issue, since it's updating issue fields. This limits the admin's ability to restrict this permission (to be able to link epics) to specific user.\r\n\r\nh5. Suggested Solution\r\nIt would be great to have a separate permission for this action. \r\n\r\nh5. Workaround \r\nIf you do not wish to give the users permissions to edit issue in the project where epics are created, you may consider one of the following options:\r\n* Manage field-level permissions in the \"program\" project via ScriptRunner Behaviours. Note this will introduce additional complexity to your setup.\r\n* Create an issue link type to simulate the epic assignment (is parent epic of /is epic child of) and add an automation rule via Automation for Jira with an issue linked trigger. This way, you may only grant users the linking permissions and not all edit permissions and let the automation user set the actual \"Epic Link\" field.\r\n* Move all epics to a separate project (that's reserved only for epics) and make them editable by all users in linked projects.",

Problem\r\nThere is a bug on the integration between IDEs like Webstorm and JIRA, although the support for IDE in JIRA was discontinued.\r\n\r\nThe bug was reported originally in our JIRA support site to be fixed since when using this integration our users were being logged out of JIRA.You can see the bug reported here:\r\n[JRA-42154|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRA-42154]\r\n\r\nSince this issue was related to a connector, the bug was moved to the Connector's project:\r\n[PL-3051|https://ecosystem.atlassian.net/browse/PL-3051]\r\n\r\nhttps://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2015/06/discontinuing-ide-connectors-support/\r\n\r\nh3. Suggestion\r\n\r\nAdd any kind of compatibility or feature where the user does not face the login intermittent issue when making API calls to JIRA.\r\n\r\nh3. Workarounds\r\n\r\n*I was able to find some workarounds on my research that might be useful, although it's necessary an additional license in JIRA, which is inconvenient for our customers*\r\n\r\n- Change the password of your own account, so if an unknown app / service was using your account and destroying the sessions it no longer could\r\n- Create a dedicated account and use it credentials to connect Webstorm and Jira. In this way, Webstorm could no longer destroy the sessions of your own account.\r\n- You can upgrade to snapshot versions in the Global Settings -> General -> Auto Upgrade section of the connector's configuration. (This workaround was suggested PL-3051 comments).",

If he wants to create a filter with basic search, he will find all the 30 status in the system, though he only will see a query when he uses the 5 he has permission for.\r\n\r\nWould it be possible to fade out all the other status?\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nBest Regards,\r\n\r\nAlex Richter",

Problem Definition\r\nCurrently we use German translation in JIRA by changing the language some of the words does not change properly but still remains in English for example\r\n\r\n# when we run reindexing the time still shows in English *2 minutes 50 seconds*\r\n# The final statement in which contains \"Heute\". This word is only then capitalized when it stands at the beginning of a sentence, after a colon, or when it stands for the present. It has to lower case here.\r\n#\u00a0 Representation of the time needs to be fixed. A correct expression of time would be, for this case: 12:40 Uhr.\r\n\u00a0\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nImprove the existing German translation so that there is less or no cosmetic error in future",
