As you noted, the word \"open\" is very important. These issues are different from unresolved issues.\r\n\r\n- I cant seem to isolate any reasons why the unresolved count is incorrect (or by so much!).\r\n\r\nHeres what I tried:\r\n- Have quickly scanned through Atlassian's JIRA and there doesnt appear to be any current bugs surrounding this functionality.\r\n- Have tried a variety of different filtering options to try and get a result of \"3\", to no avail. The smallest number I can get is 7, which is achieved by setting the filter to \"Product Support\" project, \"No Fix Versions\", selecting \"None\" for Affect versions and setting the status to \"Open\" only. This is still pointless though since 7 isnt 3!\r\n- Looked through the source for the report thats being run. At a glance (about 5 minutes), theres nothing out of the ordinary that indicates a completely different search is being run to produce the numbers.\r\n\r\nAny advise?",

These users also have email addresses that would be invalid for LDAP authentication: they do not exist on this server. However, this dual system *does work* and offers us a very useful flexibility in managing JIRA: our JIRA admins are not the same as our IT sysadmins, who manage LDAP and other backend systems, and it is useful to set up demo accounts without bothering the sysadmins for additional accounts each time.\r\n\r\n{panel}However, we have run into a problem now, because we want to change some of the passwords for these \"internal\" users (the users that are not authenticated using LDAP). This seems to be impossible: on the \"Edit User\" screen in Administration it is not possible to change these passwords, even though they are passwords set by JIRA and not by the external system (LDAP).{panel}\r\n\r\nPlease advise if this is a bug or a feature and what the Atlassian policy is: if \"external password management\" *really* means external, then the password fields should *not* be shown on user creation, *nor* should it be possible to create a user with an email address that is invalid for the external authentication system (as noted above).\r\n\r\nWe do not think that the system should be so inflexible, however: we would very much like the flexibility of managing some blocks of users using JIRA and some using an external system. However, in this case, JIRA must be able to recognize which system is managing which password.",

Your input in the comments helps us understand how this affects you and what you're hoping to accomplish with JIRA.\r\n\r\nAt this time, this suggestion is not on the JIRA development roadmap. Please remember that jira.atlassian.com is one of many inputs for the JIRA roadmap. You can [learn more about our process here|https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/110373/how-does-the-jira-team-use-jira-atlassian-com].\r\n\r\nI understand that our decision may be disappointing. Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nDave Meyer\r\n[dmeyer@atlassian.com|mailto:dmeyer@atlassian.com]\r\nProduct Manager, JIRA Platform\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\nHello,\r\nis it possible to allow JIRA to have checkboxes next to the attachments in manage attachments and allow for multiple delete?  We have received user complaints that it is tedious to delete multiple attachments from an issue by continously clicking on the delete link.\r\nThanks,\r\n-Andreas\r\n",

      "description": "Dear Atlassian,\r\n\r\nI would like a report which would display a snapshot of the progress of any version.  The x-axis would be time, and the y-axis would be number of issues.  Then, with a color-coded legend, the number of issues in each workflow state would be indicated as a bar for each day.\r\n\r\nAttached is a screenshot from our JIRA system (UnresolvedIssueReports.jpg), which displays the total number of issues in our 2.20.1 release, which of course increases over time.  Below that, in green, is the total number of 'resolved' issues.  Since the only issues which change from 'Unresolved' to 'Resolved' are those which are closed or reopened, we have difficulty tracking the progress of the project.  I need to see how many issues are submitted, open, fixed, testing, passed, reopened, or closed.  Since we only close issues before the release if they are duplicates, or 'won't fix', there is no way for me to track the health of the project.  Additionally, since the reopened issues automatically get the 'reopened' resolution, we could be in trouble, believing that resolved issues are good.  We get around this by setting passed issues to have a non-unresolved resolution, but I'ld like some more granularity.\r\n\r\nI am also attaching a screenshot from an Excel report that sort-of does what I expect.  Note the colored bars indicating total number of items in each status.  Of course, I would really want to order the bars in a workflow that makes sense (Submitted > Open > Fixed > Testing > Passed > Reopened (Failed) > Closed) and then you get into the issue that the workflow statuses must be numbered by an administrator, so that they aren't just sorted alphabetically.  You can see from the screenshot how easy it is to watch the number of submitted items decrease as the number of testing and passed items increase.  If items get moved to future versions (as they do frequently), then you can easily determine the number of issues in the release from the top line.\r\n\r\nI could prose on, but I don't want to submit more than one idea per issue.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\ngrace@geospiza.com\r\n",

That is, the issue is left in a state that does not correspond to its current workflow and hence no transitions can be performed.  Once this occurs, it cannot be fixed with bulk edit, transition or move. It can only be cloned and then deleted.  \r\n\r\nThis is not an issue if the workflow scheme maps the same workflow are all issue types (e.g. they fall under the 'all unmapped issue types\" setting) or if the same states exist in the different workflows.

Depending on which project template you choose, a fresh set of schemes will be created for you. These new schemes do not use the default issue type scheme.\r\n\r\nIf you would like to create a project that uses the same schemes as an existing project, we have introduced a new \"Created with shared configuration\" feature when creating projects. Simply select an existing project, and JIRA will create a new project that shares all the same schemes as the existing project. [Learn more here|https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiraserver070/defining-a-project-749382822.html].\r\n\r\nWhile we have kept the default issue type scheme for now, it is not used by default unless specifically selected and we expect to remove it in a future release.\r\nRegards,\r\nDave Meyer\r\nProduct Manager, JIRA Platform\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\nBy default, all newly created issue types are automatically added to the Default Issue Type Scheme.  However, we have some specific issue types for use with non-global projects that need not be shared amongst all other projects.  (Most of our projects are using the Default Issue Type Scheme for simplicity.)  It would be nice if either:\r\n\r\n1) the \"remove\" functionality was added to this scheme; or\r\n2) newly created issue types never even made it to the Default Scheme.",

Aside from stumbling over something with a search, the obvious thing that probably most of us do is to work our way down the list of most popular issues, stopping when we've had enough (way before we've seen all).  This approach is about as statistically flawed as you can get.  (The other way we do it is to sort by most-recent; that is a relatively fair sampling.)\r\n\r\nAt the top of every JIRA page, there should be a short summary of a randomly-selected votable issue, sort of like an advertisement. If you click on it, it opens in a new window, so you don't lose your place.\r\n\r\nOnly insiders should be allowed to see the list sorted by votes, and the vote count for an issue should be shown to users only when the issue is selected for the next release.\r\n\r\nIf JIRA will do these things, voting will be a better statistical sample of what users want.",

This causes various problems:\r\n\r\n - When users have to edit a config file, they have to go through all the hoopla or rebuilding the .war file. \r\n - When we ask for a file (eg. entityengine.xml or subversion-jira-plugin.properties), users can't simply give it to us. \r\n - Tomcat seems to ignore the unpackWARs=\"false\" directive, and unpacks the webapp to webapps/atlassian-jira/. Users are then tempted to edit this copy. Tomcat itself can also get confused, and ignore changes to the webapp in favour of files from webapps/.",
