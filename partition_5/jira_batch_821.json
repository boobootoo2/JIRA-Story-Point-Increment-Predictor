[See the corresponding bug report|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-26808].\n  {panel}\n\nQuartz 1.5.1 has the following code on its _org.quartz.JobExecutionContext_ constructor:\r\n\r\n{code}\r\n    public JobExecutionContext(Scheduler scheduler,\r\n            TriggerFiredBundle firedBundle, Job job) {\r\n...\r\n        this.jobDataMap.setMutable(false);\r\n        this.trigger.getJobDataMap().setMutable(false);\r\n    }\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nThe _setMutable_ method of the trigger's _JobDataMap_ implementation, _org.quartz.utils.DirtyFlagMap_, looks like this:\r\n\r\n{code}\r\n    public void setMutable(boolean mutable) {\r\n        this.locked = !mutable;\r\n        if(locked)\r\n            map = Collections.unmodifiableMap(map);\r\n        else\r\n            map = new HashMap(map);\r\n    }\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nIf the caller passes in _mutable false_ (and the state does not get changed in the meanwhile), the internal map will be decorated with the _java.util.Collections.UnmodifiableMap_.\r\n\r\nThis code is quite dangerous, because as it seems the above mentioned caller (_JobExecutionContext_ constructor) is the only caller in the framework. If a job runs with a high-frequency for a few weeks, the reference chain could grow to a level where an iteration over the map's entries could result in an exhaustions of the thread's max stack size.\r\n\r\nThe code was introduced somewhere in between Quartz 1.4.5 (the version JIRA was on before) and 1.5.1. It was removed as part of [QUARTZ-458|http://jira.opensymphony.com/browse/QUARTZ-458] for 1.6, thus upgrading to this version should remove the threat of building up a harmful state.\r\n\r\nThe caller iterating over the trigger's _JobDataMap_ is yet to be identified. This is due to the nature of the logging of the _StackOverflowError_ not containing the root stack frame anymore. It would be enough if _setMutable(true)_ is called after a couple of weeks, thus the _HashMap_ constructor would iterate over the map in order to attach the values and would thus hit the _StackOverflowError_. Now we know that the actual call has to be in the Quartz thread executing JIRA's _ServiceRunner_, since its run method does not reference the _jobExecutionContext_ anywhere. \r\n\r\nMy guess would be that it is _job = qs.getJobFactory().newJob(firedBundle)_ in _org.quartz.core.JobRunShell.initialize(QuartzScheduler, TriggerFiredBundle)_ which would either have to directly iterate over the trigger's _JobDataMap_ or construct sth. which would do that lazily in order to satisfy the contract as laid out in _org.quartz.JobDataMap_:\r\n\r\n{quote}\r\nThe _JobExecutionContext_ passed to a Job at execution time also contains a convenience _JobDataMap_ that is the result of *merging the contents of the trigger's _JobDataMap_ (if any)* over the _Job_'s _JobDataMap_ (if any).\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nE.g. org.quartz.simpl.PropertySettingJobFactory does the following:\r\n\r\n{code}\r\n    public Job newJob(TriggerFiredBundle bundle) throws SchedulerException {\r\n\r\n        Job job = super.newJob(bundle);\r\n        \r\n        JobDataMap jobDataMap = new JobDataMap();\r\n        jobDataMap.putAll(bundle.getJobDetail().getJobDataMap());\r\n        jobDataMap.putAll(bundle.getTrigger().getJobDataMap());\r\n\r\n        setBeanProps(job, jobDataMap);\r\n        \r\n        return job;\r\n    }\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nIf this theory is correct, every JIRA instance >= 4.3 will eventually run into this problem if not being restarted.",

As you type in the subject it's performing some sort of a SQL full-text comparison of what you typed to the Question table.

For example, if you change the user profile to Deutsch ([^profile-language.PNG]), the decimal separator will be \",\" (comma) and the dot will be the digit group separator which is simply ignored; logging work for \"1,5h\" (one, comma, five) will result in _1 hour, 30 minutes_ and if the same user changes his language to English or Spanish( both use dot as decimal separator), the same \"1,5h\" will result in _15 hours_ (see example: [^logged work.PNG]). The limitation of this behavior is that the decimal separator is tied to the language.\r\n\r\nNow that the current expected behavior is explained, this is considered obsolete as a bug and will be closed. We do see the value on preventing the invalid decimal separator from being used and have raised the Feature request JRASERVER-68600 Prevent using group separator/invalid decimal separator when entering numeric values where we will be gathering the interest in changing the current behavior.\r\n\r\nIn case you have additional scenarios where this behavior is inconsistent, please raise a support request for our support team to analyze and determine the next steps.\r\n * You can raise a support request from\u00a0[https://support.atlassian.com/contact/]\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n Ren\u00e9 Chiquete - JAC Champion.\r\n{panel}\r\nIn JIRA 4.2.2 When user enters '3,5h' he will run into error \"Invalid time duration entered\" as shown below :\r\n\r\n!error.png!\r\n\r\nCurrently in JIRA 4.4 when user accidentally enter 3,5h Time spent will be logged as shown below :\r\n\r\n!timespent.png!\r\n\r\nWhen I changed into German as the default language it showed the correct format when entering 3,5h :\r\n\r\n!timespent1.png!\r\n\r\nWhen I changed into English as default language and enter '3.5h' it showed the correct time :\r\n\r\n!timespent2.png!\r\n\r\nThe current issue: \r\n JIRA shouldn't accept 3,5h when the user is using English settings and show error as before in JIRA 4.2.2",
