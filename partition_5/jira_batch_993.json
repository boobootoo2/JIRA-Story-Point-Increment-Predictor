Your input in the comments helps us understand how this affects you and what you're hoping to accomplish with JIRA.\r\n \r\nAt this time, this suggestion is not on the JIRA development roadmap. While the idea is definitely solid, we're re-evaluating the entire JIRA notifications system, and that may entail new ways to customize emails that don't use velocity templates at all.\r\n\r\nPlease remember that jira.atlassian.com is one of many inputs for the JIRA roadmap. You can [learn more about our process here|https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/110373/how-does-the-jira-team-use-jira-atlassian-com].\r\n \r\nI understand that our decision may be disappointing. Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.\r\n \r\nRegards,\r\nDave Meyer\r\n[dmeyer@atlassian.com|mailto:dmeyer@atlassian.com]\r\nProduct Manager, JIRA Platform\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\nIt would be very handy if, instead of adding headers like 'Subject' programmatically, JIRA let headers be specified in the email velocity templates.\r\n\r\nThis would elegantly solve a number of problems, and open new possibilities:\r\n\r\n - Subject could be easily customized (JRA-3568) and i18nized (JRA-4419)\r\n - We could easily make the Precedence: Bulk header removeable, for users like the ASF where this triggers spam filters\r\n - The From: address could be customized easily (JRA-2315)\r\n - Custom headers could be added (JRA-3933, JRA-4440)\r\n\r\nIf this requires JIRA to parse the text to extract headers, we could read the To:, Cc: and Bcc: headers and append their values to the notification scheme targets.",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-4446].\r\n{panel}\r\n{panel:title=Atlassian Update \u2013 6 November 2017|borderStyle=solid|borderColor=#ebf2f9|titleBGColor=#ebf2f9|bgColor=#ffffff}\r\nHi all,\r\n\r\nThanks for providing your thoughts and votes on this suggestion. I know it's been a while since we last commented on this suggestion and we are sorry to have kept you so long without a clear answer.\r\n\r\nWe (the\u00a0Jira\u00a0Server team) have recently reviewed this suggestion and how it would fit alongside our strategy and other customer priorities.\u00a0I am afraid we are not planning to invest in more extensive issue hierarchies in Jira. Therefore we decided to close this issue.\r\n\r\nWhile we absolutely understand the logic behind this request, we strongly believe that we should focus on making Jira simpler and easier to use rather then introduce additional complexity on both conceptual and technical level.\r\n\r\nJira as a tool promotes agile approach to project management, where simplicity is key and\u00a0teams work iteravely to deliver small sections of a project at a time. We strongly believe that current hierarchy of epic, task (story) and subtask supports this approach.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, as Atlassian, we understand that growing teams may require more flexibility. This is why we are investing in\u00a0[Portfolio for Jira|https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/portfolio/enterprise]. Portfolio extends Jira hierarchy with the concept of initiative and helps organize and prioritize your team's work to build a realistic roadmap that spans multiple teams and Jira projects.\r\n\r\nAlso there is a commercial third party plugin available,\u00a0[Structure|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.almworks.jira.structure]\u00a0that provides the ability to create a hierarchy of issues for Jira Server customers.\r\n\r\nSince investing in more extensive issue hierarchies in the Jira platform is not aligned with our strategy and roadmap, we will be closing this issue. I understand that our decision may be disappointing, but we also hope that you will appreciate our candid and transparent approach. Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nGosia Kowalska\r\nSenior Product Manager, Jira\u00a0Server\r\n{panel}\r\n*Original request description:*\r\n\r\nAs a JIRA user I need more hierarchical organisation of tasks. As of today JIRA offers only a two-level hierarchy (if installed without plugins): stories and subtasks. But in reality the process of resolving issues can be much more complicated. During the process of analysis a simple story can be broken into a number of sub-tasks. And then each of the sub-tasks may be consequently broken into a set of even more granular entities. JIRA does not support an easy way of handling multiple levels of hierarchy in a natural way and the available workarounds require additional steps which render the solution suboptimal.",

With opening and closing tag. When our developers repro this bug, they will write ?&lt;script>  instead of <script>.\n\nNow I have to write a comment explaining that I didn't mean to type\n&lt; but the actual opening bracket.\nCan you please put this as a thing to fix for a future version?\n\nThanks,\nChris\n\nChristina Hesse\nLead Software Test Engineer\nSolutionsIQ - Professional Services\n425.451.2727 x 2440\nchesse@solutionsiq.com\n",
