The reason why 7.6.x got a fix is because it's the [current Enterprise release|https://confluence.atlassian.com/enterprise/atlassian-enterprise-releases-948227420.html] (as of Sep 11, 2018).\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\n{panel:title=Description}\r\nh4. Summary\r\n\r\nUser action failed when the URL has pipe \"|\" character and JIRA is running behind load balancer.\r\nh4. Steps to reproduce\r\n # Setup JIRA behind load balancer\r\n # Perform action, such as transition issue (or user logout)\r\n\r\nh4. Expected result\r\n\r\nIssue gets transitioned successfully\r\nh4. Actual Result\r\n\r\nTransition fails with Communications Breakdown - The JIRA server could not be contacted\" error dialog thrown in the UI\r\nh4. Explanation\r\n\r\nIn Some JIRA URL, the pipe character is not accepted, which is as per stated in the following documentation:\r\n - [rfc2396.txt|http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2396.txt]\r\n\r\nQuoting the paragraph which indicates that the pipe character is excluded:\r\n{quote}2.4.3. Excluded US-ASCII Characters\r\n\r\nAlthough they are disallowed within the URI syntax, we include here a\r\n description of those US-ASCII characters that have been excluded and\r\n the reasons for their exclusion.\r\n\r\nThe control characters in the US-ASCII coded character set are not\r\n used within a URI, both because they are non-printable and because\r\n they are likely to be misinterpreted by some control mechanisms.\r\n\r\ncontrol = <US-ASCII coded characters 00-1F and 7F hexadecimal>\r\n\r\nThe space character is excluded because significant spaces may\r\n disappear and insignificant spaces may be introduced when URI are\r\n transcribed or typeset or subjected to the treatment of word-\r\n processing programs. Whitespace is also used to delimit URI in many\r\n contexts.\r\n\r\nspace = <US-ASCII coded character 20 hexadecimal>\r\n\r\nThe angle-bracket \"<\" and \">\" and double-quote (\") characters are\r\n excluded because they are often used as the delimiters around URI in\r\n text documents and protocol fields. The character \"#\" is excluded\r\n because it is used to delimit a URI from a fragment identifier in URI\r\n references (Section 4). The percent character \"%\" is excluded because\r\n it is used for the encoding of escaped characters.\r\n\r\ndelims = \"<\" | \">\" | \"#\" | \"%\" | <\">\r\n\r\nOther characters are excluded because gateways and other transport\r\n agents are known to sometimes modify such characters, or they are\r\n used as delimiters.\r\n\r\nunwise =\r\n{code:java}\r\n\"{\" | \"}\" | \"|\" | \"\\\" | \"^\" | \"[\" | \"]\" | \"`\"\r\n{code}\r\nData corresponding to excluded characters must be escaped in order to\r\n be properly represented within a URI.\r\n{quote}\r\nDue to this, when our customer have JIRA running behind a load balancer that is RFC-2396 aware, some JIRA functionalities may not work. Some of the affected functions are:\r\n - User logout: [http://localhost:8082/jira1/logout?atl_token=B6U6-M2L6-IVGN-XXQU]|6f38bd4b12160e25f65580b3562a5c2ca3b96457|lin\r\n - Transitioning issue to a new status: [http://localhost:8082/jira1/secure/WorkflowUIDispatcher.jspa?id=10500&action=5&atl_token=B6U6-M2L6-IVGN-XXQU]|6f38bd4b12160e25f65580b3562a5c2ca3b96457|lin\r\n\r\nIn both of the above operations, the URL contains the pipe character, which means that the operation will break when we have JIRA running behind a load balancer.\r\n\r\nHence, it will be great if we can substitute the pipe character as needed so that JIRA will be compatible with RFC-2396\r\n\r\nh4. Workaround\r\n\r\nReplace the pipes with URL encoded character %07C\r\n{panel}",

If they try to raise an issue via email or add a comment to an issue via email and are signed into an email account not registered with JIRA - then JIRA doesn't know what to do with the email that it received (if you have create new users via email disabled - which we do). JIRA not knowing what to do with the unrecognizable email address is understandable. \r\n\r\nHowever we should be able to associate multiple email addresses with one JIRA user, so then JIRA will correctly be able to raise Issues or add comments to existing issues.\r\n\r\nIt is really irritating that JIRA does not support this. This means all developers need to inconveniently log out of their email and log into another email account OR mess with their email account settings and temporarily change their \"sent from\" setting to show the email address registered with JIRA. Sometimes switching \"sent from\" or email accounts means we can't do a simple cc / bcc: to our JIRA system as the email we need to send for support reasons needs to show up as sent from an email that is not registered with the JIRA user. So then it is a bunch more work to copy / paste stuff around and switch out the accounts to the correct email account registered with JIRA.\r\n\r\nThis is incredibly inconvenient and wastes a lot of time. Developers find this really annoying and say not so nice things. :-D",

Both projects exist without any problem, although they have the same project key? Further more, for testing, I've created 4-5 such projects, without any complaints from JIRA. Is that a bug or a feature? :)\r\n\r\nHere is the code used:\r\n\r\n{code:title=test code|borderStyle=solid}\r\nprivate void createNewProjectFromIssue(Issue issue)\r\n{\r\n\tProject p = ComponentAccessor.getProjectManager().createProject(\"summary\", \"TESTKEY\", \"description\", issue.getAssigneeId(), \"\", AssigneeTypes.PROJECT_LEAD);\r\n\tComponentAccessor.getPermissionSchemeManager().addDefaultSchemeToProject(p);\r\n\tComponentAccessor.getIssueTypeScreenSchemeManager().addSchemeAssociation(p, ComponentAccessor.getIssueTypeScreenSchemeManager().getDefaultScheme());\r\n\tComponentAccessor.getProjectManager().refresh();\r\n}\r\n{code}",
