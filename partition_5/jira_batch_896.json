If updateIssue is called with a single RemoteField value of key 'status,' some kind of fault should be returned.

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-17463].\n  {panel}\n\n(See linked issues for failing use cases.)\r\n\r\nAll of our indexing goes through the EnglishAnalyzer which passes the stream through several filters: lowercase, stop word removal, apostrophe removal, tokenizing on underscore and dash, and stemming. This works pretty well when you do a natural language kind of query but has numerous cases where it fails to return results that user experiences. What we need is some kind of secondary \"exact text\" index and use that to boost results.\r\n\r\nOne way would be to create a new \"exact query\" field in the SummaryIndexer, EnvironmentIndexer, and DescriptionIndexer and a PerFieldAnalyzerWrapper to use a \"dumber\" Analyzer that uses the WhitespaceTokenizer instead of the StandardTokenizer. Then we'd need to fix querying to understand that this new field exists. We could either overload the tilda operator and make it smart enough to search across both fields and combine the results in a smart way. Or we could make the equals operator handle text (right now it throws an exception). We'd also want some kind of UI configuration to enable/disable this since it changes behaviour and not everyone is going to want the new behaviour. This would likely break the existing unit tests and func tests for indexing and JQL so we'd need to fix those. We'd probably want to writer new Analyzers for German, French, and Spanish as well instead of just limiting this new behaviour to our English users. Possibly Chinese/Japanese/Korean as well. We'd want better func test coverage on searching in non-English languages to try to make sure this change doesn't have adverse effects for non-English users.\r\n\r\nWe'd also need to figure out how to handle text custom fields in all of this.\r\n\r\nAnother approach would be something more along the lines of the SynonymAnalyzer described in \"Lucene in Action\": have a single Analyzer emit multiple tokens with the same virtual position. Under the covers the Analyzer would multiplex TokenStreams from a \"normal\" Analyzer and a \"dumb\" Analyzer. I'm not sure if sharing the Reader between Tokenizers like that works, if not we'd might have to make changes to Lucene core. Having both kinds of tokens in the same index field seems like it OUGHT to end up giving better results for these \"exact searches\". But it might have adverse effects on normal search ordering. This approach would probably have less impact on JQL but has a higher risk of us running into shortcomings in Lucene APIs.",

This is caused by a mismatch between how Microsoft treats Cache-Control headers and how JIRA sets them.\r\n\r\nBy default everything goes through the JiraCachingFilter and have no-cache and no-store added to the headers. Setting those means IE doesn't allow documents served over SSL to be stored to disk. This not only means you can't right-click-save them but if they are handled by external applications (Excel, Word, etc) you get error messages that are often strange and difficult to decipher.\r\n\r\nSo far we've had a piecemeal approach to fixing this: a customer reports a problem and we fix that one thing. First it was Word documents, then Excel, then RSS, then Workflows.\r\n\r\nIt would be better to consolidate our caching strategy into a central place, much as JiraCachingFilter works today, but with the knowledge of how to handle these other resources properly. Additionally some kind of Windows based selenium tests around all of these would be nice to help verify we don't ever regress, especially since none of our normal testing involves SSL.",

We have just implemented a mechanism which locks JIRA on start up if the data is older than the minimum required version, and also prevents you from importing data which is too old.\r\n\r\nWhen these events occur, an error message is displayed to the user telling them that their data is too old, but we do not have the room to describe to them how to go about remedying the problem. And since we don't want to have change the message for every release of JIRA, we should have a standalone document which outlines the process for doing these upgrades. I have tentatively used the URL {{http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/JIRA+Upgrade+Guide+For+Old+Versions}} but of course this can change. The URL is defined in the {{external-link.properties}} file.",

Also problematic is the situation where the class and/or package name of an extension changes. While rigid change management can prevent such situations it would be comforting to have a quick sanity check within JIRA itself.

      "description": "We have a potential problem with searching for comments in JQL now because the way we do it is:\r\n# Run the comment search over the comment index\r\n# Collect the issue ids for the matching documents\r\n# Build up an issue query that will match any of the collected ids and then run it over the issue index.\r\n\r\nIf the comment query is too generic (e.g. {{comment !~ \"awordthatwontexist\"}}) we are likely to get many matching issue ids on a large instance of JIRA, which then translates to a large query for the issue index. At the moment, we have the maximum number of terms a query can contain set to 65,000. But on an instance with more than this number of issues, a query with that many terms could be a not-too-rare occurrence. Then, on top of the number of issues, there are other factors which can influence the number of terms used, namely how complex the permissions filter for that user is (which is a function of how many projects, how many issue security schemes, how many groups the user is a member of, etc).\r\n\r\nWhat actually happens is: when a BooleanQuery is being constructed and exceeds the maximum number of terms, a runtime exception is thrown ({{TooManyClauses}}). This is not currently trapped anywhere in JIRA code.\r\n\r\nWe suspect that this might happen a bit more often now with irresponsible use of the comment search, but in reality this could also occur due to say a JQL function that generates too many terms to search for. Ideally, we want a way to report back to the user how this happened, so that they can modify their query.\r\n\r\nIt would be best to handle this in a standard, preferably single way, across all ClauseQueryFactorys. However, this only monitors the queries generated for each specific terminal clause - so we would also need handling when the clauses are combined. But by that stage, we've lost the insight into which clause caused the problem (or contributed most to the excess of terms). We have a similar problem when, after combining all the queries, we then add on the permissions filter for the user.",
