Summary\r\n\r\nWhen an Agent moves an issue through a transition that has both a \"Resolve Issue Screen\" (or any other screen with the *Resolution* field visible) and an \"Update Issue Field - Resolution\", any SLA that depends on the \"Resolution Set\" event will not be closed.\r\n\r\nThis is due to the resolution update not being present in the issue history. \r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Add the post function *Update Field Value* (Resolution) to the *Resolve issue* transition.\r\n# Add a screen with the *Resolution* field to the same transition.\r\n# Have an SLA that stops on the *Resolution Set* event. (The default \"Time to resolution\" SLA should do the trick)\r\n# Create and resolve an issue.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nThe Time to resolution SLA will stop ticking, and the resolution change will be present in the issue history.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nThe SLA will continue running, and no record of the resolution will be populated in the issue history\r\n \r\nh3. Notes\r\nIn case both the post function and the screen set the same value to the resolution field, nothing will be logged on the issue history. However, if a different value is set, the history will register the change but will still miss the entry from resolution \"empty\" to the one set by the transition screen.\r\n\r\nPlease check the screenshot below for a better picture of the issue.\r\n\r\n !screenshot-1.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\nThis bug is similar to two different ones: JSDCLOUD-4038 and JSDCLOUD-6193.\r\n\r\nh3.Workaround\r\nRemove either the resolution field or the post function from the transition context.",
