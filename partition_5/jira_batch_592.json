Problem Definition\r\n\r\nWhen migrating issues from external trackers to Jira Server, it becomes very tedious to first have to create each of the issue statuses that you want to use before importing issues. For large environment that could have had several hundred different statuses in them it then takes a lot longer than it should to import this data correctly.\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nCreate REST API endpoint that allows users to create new statuses.\u00a0 Currently the endpoint [GET /api/2/status|https://docs.atlassian.com/software/jira/docs/api/REST/8.2.1/#api/2/status-getStatuses] will return all statuses in Jira.  But there is no corresponding POST verb that could be used to create these same statuses via REST.\r\n\r\nh3. Why this is important\r\n\r\nMakes it easier to migrate data into Jira. CSV importer is not able to create new statuses within Jira, and the lack of a REST API endpoint to create a new status means more manual status creation work for an admin. With such a POST or PUT endpoint and admin could create a little REST script to simply call Jira and tell it specifically what statuses should be valid within that site.\r\nh3.

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-72153].\r\n{panel}\r\nh3. Problem Definition\r\nSeveral past cases have been reported of Jira admins trying to use a user custom field value or a group custom field value to set a project permissions such as 'Create Issue' or 'Browse Project'.  The intention of the admin here is to only allow the possible users in that custom field options to have that specific permission.   This does not work though for these specific permissions, because in order to evaluate these permissions the issue has to already be created in Jira.  These custom fields would have to have a value set within them on an issue already created.  The potential values of that field are not valid as a means to impose a permission grant on those specific permission options.  In the case of creating issues, it can't possibly work because the issue is not created yet.\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\nChange the way permission schemes work and edit the screens there in to prevent admins trying to set permissions that can never possibly be valid within Jira:\r\n#  This could be done by specifically removing 'user custom field value' and 'group custom field value' from the objects that cannot possibly honor their hypothetical values yet.  We know this includes at least create issue and browse project, but there could be others in play here as well. \r\n# Another solution could be to change the current behavior of the browse project permission when granted to the 'user custom field' and 'group custom field' when these 2 fields are not set to any value. In this case, instead of allowing any user to view the issue, no one should be able to view the issue until these fields are set.\r\n\r\nh3. Why this is important\r\nLots of admins in Jira have attempted to configure this because Jira allows it, But can't possibly honor it.  It causes high levels of frustration and angry users to have Jira let you do something that it has no expectation of being able to do.\r\nhttps://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-26659\r\nhttps://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-30783\r\nhttps://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-66317\r\nhttps://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-21613\r\nhttps://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-30783\r\nhttps://community.atlassian.com/t5/Jira-Software-questions/JIRA-Bug-with-Group-Custom-Field-Permission-Settings/qaq-p/734856\r\n\r\nh3.

Using *JIRA Cloud*? [See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-61328].\r\n  {panel}\r\n\r\nh3. Problem Definition\r\nThe \"connecting JIRA to SQL Server\" documentations do not mention the autoCommit parameter in the JDBC URLs. This parameter is needed to prevent deadlocks as per https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirakb/deadlock-when-running-jira-with-sql-server-283640022.html and so it should be a required configuration in JIRA's dbconfig.xml.\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\nModify the documentation to include {{autoCommit=false}} parameter by default:\r\nhttps://confluence.atlassian.com/jira063/connecting-jira-to-sql-server-2012-683541742.html\r\nhttps://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA064/Connecting+JIRA+to+SQL+Server+2008\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nNote: \r\nJira Server \r\nFor Jira DC it might cause issues when starting the second node as mentioned on this KB [Second node fails to start due to read timed out accessing dbo.clusteredjob with MS SQL Server database|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRAKB/Second+node+fails+to+start+due+to+read+timed+out+accessing+dbo.clusteredjob+with+MS+SQL+Server+database]",

Problem Definition\r\nWhen you have a project in Jira that allows anonymous user access to things like commenting, the activity stream can become very full with anonymous user comments.  This makes it much harder to find actions or comments from other authenticated users.  The filtering options in the activity stream gadget do allow you to filter upon a username.  However since Anonymous users do not technically have a username, there is actually no way to limit or restrict those unauthenticated user's actions from the stream\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\nIt would be helpful if the activity stream had some way to filter out for anonymous users.  \r\n\r\nh3. Why this is important\r\nMany users find that anonymous comments are not as important to them as the actions of users with accounts.  This can help to make the activity stream full of more useful, directed information.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround \r\nnone",
