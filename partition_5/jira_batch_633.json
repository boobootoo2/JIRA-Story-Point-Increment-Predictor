However, you will see that server has one extra step as highlighted by the red underlines.\n\n*Screen 2 - Custom Fields*\nThis shows the custom fields screen that server has. I do not care about this feature and have no need for it to be available for OnDemand import.\n\n*Screen 3 - Fields*\nThis shows that the server adds three options for mapping imports that are not available with OnDemand. sFullName is the must have for us.\n\nsCateogry and sPriority would be very nice to have, but I can deal with not having them.\n\n*Screen 4 - Values*\nThis shows the ui for choosing what the mappings are. Once very nice thing with this is that the configuration file in the earlier steps remembers the mappings I created. So if I run through this for one of our projects we can use mostly the same configuration file for other projects. Also, since the configuration file is text I can write a script to do the user name mapping rather than having to fill in 400+ username ids :).\n\n*Screen 5 - Links*\nThis shows that the server adds two more link import options. The critical one for us is the duplicate case mapping. See also is nice but we don't actually intentionally use that much.\n{quote}",

Problem Definition\nWhen importing from an external system such as Bitbucket, basically the importer is able to map usernames to JIRA usernames correctly, and create new JIRA accounts when there is no username match in JIRA. However, sometimes usernames from the external system don't match usernames of the same users in JIRA, or on the other hand, usernames in the external system coincidentally match usernames of entirely different users in JIRA (disastrous), and there is no simple way to choose to map with other attributes.\n\nThis would probably apply to all External System Import. However, the context in the support case that led to this is Bitbucket to JIRA import. More details in the internal comment.\n\nh3. Suggested Solution\nPerform the by-username/by-whatever-it-is-the-importer-uses mapping, as it is being done now, but before the importer moves on to the next stage, allow the user to review and change the mappings manually (while validating consistency of user input, of course - no double mapping), then write the changes to the target directory.",

This might not always be desirable.\n\n\nh3. Suggested Solution\n\nProvide an option to 'do not update existing issues' and instead create new issues for these entries within the CSV file.\n\n\nh3. Workaround\n\nWhen importing issues from CSV from an external service where a parent -> Child relationship exists between different entities a user must map the Issue Id and Parent Id's. \n\nThese values are used and persisted within the External ID custom field.\n\nUnder some circumstances, it may not be desirable to persist this External ID longer term.

In our particular case, we don't want to have lots of closed/resolve bugs getting transferred (although I could see the need to filter based on other criteria).\n\nAlthough advanced filtering would be great, it would still be nice if we had the ability to simply exclude certain criteria from the transfer. For example, if the field mapping UI were to display a set of checkboxes for each mapped field value(such that we could exclude all issues with a \"closed\" status, or issues with a \"Low\" priority), this would go a long way towards solving our problem.\n\nAs it stands now, we need to import the entire remote Bugzilla project, and then run a Groovy script later to do the cleanup. This makes the import really slow, and we also have to maintain an extra script.",
