So it can pick up issues on that day, we would need to increase the date, for example:\r\n\r\n{noformat}\r\nupdated <= 2013-01-31\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nI'm not sure of the best way to explain this in the docs - can you please add this in using your magical touch?

For both browsers it works just perfect, so I believe that it may be related to some Java script issue with IE8, but I'm not sure about it. Unfortunately I don't have a VM with IE9 for testing it too, so I'm not sure if the problem is also occurring on IE9.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance,\r\nLucas Timm",

Since a few month, a signicative part of the development team moved (physically) to a customer house (as consultants).\r\n\r\nAt this company, we convinced them to use Jira and Tempo :-) So, they have bought Jira and Tempo and now, they are asking internal and consultant to encode the hours in their own Tempo.\r\n\r\nWe have now a mix system where : \r\n* employees working fully internally are encoding hours on our own Tempo \r\n* employees working fully externally are encoding jours on customer Tempo \r\n* employees working partly internally and externally are encoding in both Tempo the hours.\r\n\r\nWe would like to have a consolidated view on our internal developers (via Tempo) without asking the developers to encode both time (external and internal Tempo) the hours. We have seen that there is a possibility to use the import/export external hours but we would like to have your advice on this topics.\r\n\r\nThanks",
