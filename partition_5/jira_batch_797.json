In JIRA:\r\n# Go to Administration > System > General Configuration > Edit Configuration\r\n# Disable *Use gzip compression* > Update\r\n\r\nh5. In user's or client's end\r\nFlush the browser cache. Otherwise the workaround won't work. To verify this, you can simply try it using Chrome's [incognito mode|http://support.google.com/chrome/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=95464]\r\n\r\nh4.

Test notes\r\n- Confluence <-> JIRA = AppLink\r\n- JIRA <-> FishEye = AppLink\r\n- Each Atlassian app is located in different machine/box\r\n- All mentioned gadgets can be added in JIRA without any problem\r\n- Problem only occured when adding the gadget in Confluence, it can't be saved in the macro browser. For gadgets that has been added in Confluence, it'll still appear without any problem.\r\n- When GZIP is disabled in JIRA. Problem will not occur. This requires flushing browser cache. Force refresh through Shift+ReloadButton doesn't work for some reason. You need to flush it manually. Or simply try with Chrome [Incognito mode|http://support.google.com/chrome/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=95464] to see the result. re: JRA-28930\r\n- When GZIP is enabled in JIRA. Problem will occur straight away without having to flush browser cache. re: JRA-28930\r\n- For some reason the {{java.io.EOFException}} stacktrace will only be thrown once.",

Hence as an outcome on this, the next issue created may be using the older value for issue key.\r\n\r\nSample steps to reproduce the problem:\r\n- Create a CSV file:\r\n{noformat}\r\nIssue Type, Issue Key, Summary, Description, Assignee, Reporter\r\nBug,PCSV-14,Subject1, Description 1, admin, admin\r\nBug,PCSV-31,Subject2, Description 2, admin, admin\r\nBug, PCSV-45, Subject 3, Description 3, admin, admin\r\nBug, PCSV-60, Subject 4, Description 4, admin, admin\r\n{noformat}\r\n- Import the CSV file to a new project\r\n- The import will run successfully, and issues created will be using the issue key specified (eg: PCSV-14, PCSV-31, etc)\r\n- However when we try to create a new issue, the issue key will be assigned to PCSV-5, which is incorrect. The expected next issue key should be PCSV-61. To check the pcounter value in database:\r\n{code:sql}\r\nselect pname, pkey, pcounter from project where pname=\"project name\";\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nWorkaround:\r\nupdate the pcounter value from the database:\r\n{code:sql}\r\nupdate project set pcounter=x where pname=\"project name\";\r\n{code}\r\n(i) where x is a new value for pcounter",

Summary\r\n\r\nIf a clone operation fails during the create transition (such as when a validator on the Create transition stops the issue creation), JIRA adds a self-referencing link to the original issue (only if the Cloners link type is specified, of course).\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n# Create a validator such as Required Field(s) using [JIRA Suite Utilities|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.googlecode.jira-suite-utilities] on the Create Issue Transition.\r\n# Setup an issue so that it does not have those requirements. For example, set the requirement to affects version, then remove the affects version from the issue.\r\n# Attempt to clone the issue.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nThe issue does not create a clone and notifies the user why.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nThe issue is not cloned, however an issue link is created to itself. Nothing notifies the user of failure.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nFix the validator for that issue and then clone it. Using the above example that would mean adding an affects version.\r\n\r\nh3. Notes\r\nAfter some investigation, this appears to be caused by the following code in the _doExecute()_ method of the *CloneIssueDetails* class:\r\n\r\n{code:java}\r\n// Create link between the cloned issue and the original - sequence on links does not matter.\r\nfinal IssueLinkType cloneIssueLinkType = getCloneIssueLinkType();\r\nif (cloneIssueLinkType != null)\r\n{\r\n    issueLinkManager.createIssueLink(getOriginalIssue().getId(), getIssue().getLong(\"id\"), cloneIssueLinkType.getLong(\"id\"), null, getLoggedInUser());\r\n}\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nBy simply calling the _getOriginalIssue()_ and _getIssue()_ methods, there is a built-in assumption that the clone creation succeeded.  However, if the creation failed, these two methods will return the same issue (originalIssue is first set using the _getIssue()_ result).\r\n\r\nPlease add a check here that the clone creation actually succeeded, or at least that _getOriginalIssue()_ and _getIssue()_ are resulting in different and valid issues.",

Our customers are not very keen on browsing several release notes, when all they know is that their system was just upgraded from v1.1 to v1.2.5. They only want to read up on the delta change, which in this case would be a compilation of release 1.2, 1.2.1, 1.2.2, 1.2.3, 1.2.4 and 1.2.5.\r\n\r\nWell... for you to consider!\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n--peter",

The new Link Issue functionality does not include this feature, nor the capability to use a JQL with the order-by argument.\r\n\r\n{quote}today I was paid a visit by a rather irate development manager. When linking issues, the \"Issue Selector\" screen is gone. When we linked issues in 4.3, there was a \"+\" sign next to the issues box, and this would take you to an \"Issue Selector\" screen. From there you could choose a filter. We had filters specifically set up for this, and used it frequently - we have a certain project that makes very heavy use of issue links.\r\nNow in 5.1, the \"+\" sign is gone and is replaced by a \"search for an issue\" link. It does not appear possible to simply specify a filter as it was in the past. This is problematic. The entry of a search is cumbersome and error prone. \r\nAll in all, something that used to be pretty easy turned into something that prompted a visit from an irate manager. I'm disappointed in a loss of functionality from one version to the next. {quote}",

Current Situation\r\nThe permission 'Browse Project' sets whether or not the user can view the project overview and the issues within. If the user is not granted the 'Browse Project' permission, he/she cannot view both the overview and the issues.\r\n\r\nh3. Improvement Request\r\nAdd a new project permission that separates viewing the project overview from the issues. This way, a user can view the overview of the project without being able to view the issues",
