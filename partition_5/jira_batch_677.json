Currently, users are displaying their wallboards within their environment through TV displays as an information radiator and would like them to display for long periods of time without any interruptions. As of now, it seems the only workaround is to increase the default session timeout but this isn't viable in some situations as this increase the session timeout for all users. Maybe there is a way to remove a session for a specific user, include a feature within JIRA to refresh the session timeout for a wallboard or enable the display of a wallboard without having to login as a user.",

Summary\r\n\r\nIn JIRA, when an user renames a user A and creates a second user B with the previous username, the user A's avatar breaks.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\nPlease, to reproduce, follow this instructions exactly as they are, because we found out that small changes prevent us from replicating it. For example, redoing it with the same user (after deleting users from a previous test) doesn\u2019t reproduce this bug.\r\n\r\n# Have a clean JIRA instance with default avatar configuration\r\n# Create a user (A) with the following data:\r\n#* Username: user1\r\n#* Email: user1@test.com\r\n#* Name: user1\r\n# Rename user A this way (the email probably doesn\u2019t play a role here, but some instances use the email to set the username, so it may be required to set the username):\r\n#* Username: user2\r\n#* Email: user2@test.com\r\n#* Name: user2\r\n# Create another user (user B) with same username as A had:\r\n#* Username: user1\r\n#* Email: user1@test.com\r\n#* Name: user1\r\n# Log in as user A (currently user2)\r\n# Set a picture as the user\u2019s avatar\r\n#* This error doesn\u2019t happen with the avatars provided by JIRA, you must create an image and set as avatar to reproduce\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nThe avatar is working correctly.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nThe avatar image is broken, both in Cloud and in Server.\r\n\r\nIn the user\u2019s profile, we can see these errors in the browser console (Chrome):\r\n{noformat}\r\nhttps://instance.atlassian.net/secure/useravatar?ownerId=user1&avatarId=11504 Failed to load resource: net::ERR_TOO_MANY_REDIRECTS\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nAnd:\r\n{noformat}\r\nhttp://localhost:8080/plugins/servlet/gadgets/ifr?container=atlassian&mid=1\u20262Fgadgets%2Factivitystream-gadget.xml&libs=auth-refresh#rpctoken=499011633 Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 410 (Gone)\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nCopying the image link and trying to open it shows an error page with ERR_TOO_MANY_REDIRECTS. The image link is the one in the first error mentioned above (for example, 'https://instance.atlassian.net/secure/useravatar?ownerId=user1&avatarId=11504')\r\n\r\nThis illustrates:\r\n!missing_avatars.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nh3.Workaround\r\n*Partial Workaround*\r\nIf possible, remove user B to fix user A\r\n\r\n*Workaround 2*\r\nChange user B's username to something else\r\n\r\n*Important*: _User B is not the affected user_ (that's user A, check 'Steps to Reproduce'). User B is a user whose username is the same as user A's original username. \r\n\r\nIf you don't know user A's original username to find user B, you can use this search in the database:\r\n{code:sql}\r\nselect user_key from app_user where id = (select id from cwd_user where user_name = 'user2');\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nJust replace 'user2' by user A's current username and you'll find the original one, used by the other user.",

Ticking this box takes you to a screen where your browser will strip out your extra formatting.\r\n\r\nDepending on the formatting of your data and the field it's importing into, you may also want to wrap your incoming comment in \\{noformat} tags.\r\nh3.

I want to have a base screen, that can be included into other screens, but when the base screen is updated, it gets updated everywhere. For example, I would be able to have a \"Create\", \"Edit\", \"View\" screen for an issue type (each locked down by permissions), but each of those screens have the same \"Asset Location\" Screen as a tab within them. So instead of a \"Create_Asset_Location\", \"Edit_Asset_Location\", and \"View_Asset_Location\" screen (each of which needs updated if new location metadata is added), I want a \"Asset_Location\" screen that gets tied to each \"Create\", \"Edit\", \"View\" Screen as a tab. Only update the \"Asset_Location\" screen, and it works on the other three.",

And hundreds of projects each with their own customized field configuration. When adding a new custom field to the server it automatically adds these fields to all the field configurations and makes it visible. This makes the field show in the search view, and the excel export view. \r\n\r\nThis means that when data is exported from an issue type that should have only 12 fields. the excel file actually has 900 columns in the file making the exported data worthless. Additionally the search only shows 10 or so fields so if you don't know all the available fields it is near impossible to decide which columns you want to show in the search results. or which fields you want to search for. \r\n\r\nWe know that we could go in to all the field configurations and hide all the unused fields for all these. However the problem is when a project has a new requirement and adds a new custom field then the field automatically becomes visible in all projects. \r\n\r\nThe default behavior should be changed when new fields are added. or at very least allow the person creating the field decide which projects to apply the field to.

I would like to be able to send emails that actually look like normal JIRA emails like ones that are typically sent through the notification system. \r\n\r\nThe class https://docs.atlassian.com/jira/6.4.11/com/atlassian/jira/mail/builder/EmailBuilder.html looking at it's source seems to be exactly what I want. However, the developer kit and what not discourages use of things from the *jira-core* dependency which is where this class currently resides. In fact most of the email magic that JIRA does isn't in the API. I feel like as a developer  I am having to either depend on the jira-core and non @PublicAPI parts which doesn't appear to be a good idea for good reasons; or re-invent the wheel. \r\n\r\nI would love to be able to send emails using JIRA that actually already look like normal JIRA emails and use the *CSSInliner* class correct _which is not in JIRA API either_.

Problem\r\nCurrently, if administrators install plugins during a peak period, when many users are active on the instance, it may have severe impact on performance and even accessibility of core functionality.\r\n\r\nThe reason for this partly is having related caches reset globally, which can be a cascade operation, not only affecting the caches related to the very plugin being upgraded, but others dependent on it. This may have the effect of the instance being locked up for 10+ minutes even, depending on the number of active user sessions and the caches affected\r\n\r\nh4. Workaround\r\nBased on the facts above, we suggest not to implement major configuration changes during peak-hours. Make sure to schedule such major changes to off-peak hours (overnight or during weekend), when user activity on the instance is minimal.\r\n\r\nh4. Proposed solution\r\nOne possible solution would be to block/reject incoming user requests during plugin installation/upgrade, to have the impacted period around 30s instead of minutes.",

[See the corresponding bug report|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-46219].\n  {panel}\n\nHi Team,\r\n\r\nKindy open a ticket to investigate the below issue. Find that, 2 dimensional gadget filter forgets it filter settings and fall back to user default .. Pls find below for more details\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have discovered what we believe is a 100% repro bug with the actual Atlassian JIRA Gadgets \u201cIssue Statistics\u201d & \u201cTwo Dimensional Filter Statistics\u201d gadgets for Dashboards.  Essentially, if you drill-down using the gadgets from the Dashboards (Snip It 1 below - which is surely the intended user path) both gadgets forget their Filters and just enter a basic Search query to return the results.  Thus, each User sees the results in a search and it returns just their local \u201ccolumns\u201d JIRA settings within their view.  This means the order and fields meant to be displayed by the various Filters driving these gadgets by the creators of the Dashboards at Admin level or User level are lost.  \r\n\r\nAlso, if you fix it at local level it\u2019s OK provided the User is only accessing one JIRA project on their PC, as if you locally select the correct fields (columns) for one Gadget / Filter, the order then applies to other projects as it\u2019s your local setting, which may not be using the same fields and the Dashboards as they may be showing data for completely different things.  I\u2019ve repro\u2019d this too; Snip It 2 below.\r\n\r\nChris helped isolate the reason being that the drill-down was losing association with the Filter on these 2 gadgets.\r\n\r\nAs these gadgets are both very useful we will try to raise a request with Atlassian themselves to address; David is doing this.  Just wanted to make you aware in case other teams raise this issue as I spent considerable time trying to resolve as I thought it was something we\u2019d done wrong within our project/dashboards.\r\n\r\nIf however someone knows another way to ensure Users can see the intended field settings when using these Gadgets, please let us know.\r\n\r\nregards\r\n\r\nAndy\r\n\r\nSnip It 1 (Illustration):  clicking on any of the blue links to drill-down loses the field settings in the search results.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nSnip It 2 (Illustration):  Drill-down has forgotten the Filter and returned a Search, picking up Users JIRA settings and returning fields not applicable to that specific Filter or Project:\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\nKindly let me know if you need more information on this \r\n\r\nThanks & Regds\r\n\r\nSandeep Radhakrishnan Warrier\r\n",

Message rejected.\r\n{code}\r\nThis error obviously makes sense because the user does not have permissions to create issues. But we should allow the option to fall back to using the Default Reporter configured in the mail handler, so theres still an option of creating issues here. \r\nTechnically, the user doesn't have permission to create issues directly in JIRA, but at least have the option of doing it through mail. \r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\nA Toggle functionality in the mail handler to choose between:\r\n# Ignore default reporter and prevent issue creation if email is from a user with no Create Issue permission.\r\n# Allow issue to use default reporter and be created in JIRA. \r\n \r\nh3. Workaround \r\n\"Trick\" jira into thinking these users are anonymous users, (so it will fall back to Default Reporter), e.g. by changing their email addresses in JIRA to a different email.

This would allow us to expose the least amount of information to the public as possible, while still allowing our employees to access the information behind the firewall over an obscure port.  If the connector listening on for example  port 9111 could then connect on localhost for the API, this would help us to not have to expose the entire API and only the connector necessary for the mobile application.  I hope that makes sense.  \r\n\r\nSee the screenshot.  Maybe that will help explain better.  \r\n",
