[See the corresponding bug report|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSDSERVER-2046].\n  {panel}\n\nHello, \n\nI have a problem with service desk because i could not create an issue over \"our commercial support email\" i dont know what happened and service desk and other email handlers stoped working suddenly. \n\nour domain name is derindere.atlassian.net , we are planning to roll out servicedesk 400 person but it doesnt work with email. We couldnt pass PoC phase with jira cloud.\n\nAnother important think is you should manage service desk customers and users, when i deactive any jira user , i couldnt create any user and service desk issue  with same user name.  we started to think about jira service desk,  email handling is weekness side of jira cloud or we couldt look at the picture from true perspective. \n\nCould you please help us about this issue ? Thank you , kind regards.",

Steps to reproduce\n* Create new Service Desk\n** Confirm that by default desk is open and customer appears in customer list\n* As agent, create issue on behalf of customer \n* Customer receives email, status shows waiting for support\n* Agent adds comment using comment box and clicks \"Send Response\"\n** TWO \"Service Desk notification rendering mail item\" appear in mail queue\n* Two notifications received by customer, these are duplicates with conflicting status info. Screenshot attached\n\nh3. Expected Results\nThe customer should receive only one email.\n\nh3. Actual Results\n* The notifications show different statuses\n** Old status in one message, destination status in the other\n* Both messages show correct destination step in message \"Your request status changed to...\"\n\nh3. Workaround\nMake the Agent use the Comment field in the *Respond to Customer* screen (while doing the transition with the *Respond to customer* button) instead of using the comment field in the View Issue screen. The customer will receive only one email as *Requester action Needed*.\n\n\n\n\n !Screen Shot 2015-06-23 at 2.40.00 PM.png! \n\n\n",

Suggested Solution\nIt is good to have an option to just update the Customer without transitioning the ticket status. As  statuses of waiting for customer and waiting for support make the assumption that each comment made by customers and agents hands the ticket back to the other party. This is not always the case.\n\nh3. Workaround \n\nThe new feature on Service Desk [Introducing automation in JIRA Service Desk 2.4|http://blogs.atlassian.com/2015/04/introducing-automation-jira-service-desk-2-4/] and [Automating your service desk|https://confluence.atlassian.com/servicedesk/automating-your-service-desk-733938388.html]\n\nUsing [JIRA Automation Plugin|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.atlassian.plugin.automation.jira-automation-plugin]\nUnfortunately third-party plugins are out of our [support scope|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/Support/Atlassian+Support+Offerings].

I checked the \"Permission\" scheme and I as a Service Desk Agent, do have permission on almost everything.

Problem Definition\nCurrently *JIRA Service Desk* is keeping emails in its database up to 6 months. This will cause customer's databases (and therefore backups) to grow very fast. \n\nConsequently, this may even impact the performance of JIRA as it, by default, automatically creates backups every 12 hours. \n\nh3. Suggested Solution\nRemove emails that are older then 4~6 weeks, which would most likely be already obsolete. \n\nAlternatively, mark the email as \"already processed\" when it is processed, and delete those entries with the cleaner job.",

Summary\nWhen using a Collaborator account to modify issues in a Service Desk project via API, users won't see a permissions error response - the operation will fail silently.\n\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\n# Set up a Service Desk project.\n# Set up a user account with full access to the Service Desk project, but without the Service Desk Agent permissions.\n# Use API authenticating with the account from point 2 to attempt to modify an issue in the Service Desk project.\n\nh3. Expected Results\nAPI call returns an error about the missing agent permission.\n\nh3. Actual Results\nThe API response (201) indicates that the call is successful - it's only based on JIRA permissions and doesn't account for the Service Desk permissions override.\n \nh3. Notes\nChecking the Permission Helper indicates that the Collaborator account won't be able to edit the issue:\n{quote}You are trying to perform an agent action on a service desk project. To perform this action, you must have a Service Desk agent license and both Browse and Edit Issue permissions on this project.{quote}\nThis information should be included in the API response.\n\nh3.Workaround\nGrant the API user Service Desk agent permissions.",

Possible Workaround\n- Add a permission scheme at portal level for each Service Desk(A bit similar but not exactly the same as permission in JIRA that allows the Agent further control over customization of each portal.\n- Add an option called \"View all issues\" in the portal Settings that shows or hides a link that allows all issue in the portal so customers can view all issues n the portal.",
