This can lead to confusion for the following reason:\r\n\r\nLet's say a user wants to search for all issues created between the start of the day on June 25th, and the end of the day of June 27th. A user would likely put those two dates in the basic search on Created Date (Between dates June 25th through June 27th). This would yield the following JQL:\r\n\r\n{code}created >= 2016-01-25 AND created <= 2016-01-27{code}\r\n\r\nIn JQL, 'created' assumes the time of 00:00 unless specified otherwise (which cannot be done in the basic search), which would mean that their search yields:\r\n\r\n{code}created >= \"2016-01-25 00:00\" AND created <= \"2016-01-27 00:00\"{code}\r\n\r\nUnless a ticket was created on midnight of the 27th, that entire day will not be included in the search. A majority of users would expect the basic search to yield the following advanced JQL instead:\r\n\r\n{code}created >= \"2016-01-25 00:00\" AND created <= \"2016-01-27 23:59\"{code}\r\n\r\nWithout being able to specify the times of day in the basic search, only assumed times are used, and if a user doesn't know to configure the JQL in advanced search or search a day above the results they need, they will not be seeing all of the issues they are looking for.",

The problem is that the cloning issues makes our issues less manageable. It would carry over too much information from the old issue such as assignee, due dates, fix versions, sprint, etc. while the new cloned issue hasn't been worked on. What the user really wants to do is just copy over the summary, description, etc.\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\nSimpler way: just the ability to disable \"Clone\" function, either globally, or based on users, groups, or project role.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, allow us to specify which fields will be included/excluded when copying over information from the cloned issue to the new issue.",

Summary\r\n\r\nThe *JIRA Concepts - Issues* page is a listing of all of the various Issue Types, Statuses, etc... specific to each instance. This page is helpful for users of an environment to familiarize themselves with the various configurations and customizations in the environment.\r\n\r\nIt is uncertain what causes it, but in JIRA 7.0.0+ , this screen will not display the Subtasks in the page: \r\n\r\n !JIRA_7_Not_Working.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\nThis issue does not occur in JIRA 6.4:\r\n\r\n !JIRA_6_Working.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\nThis can result in users being uncertain of what subtasks are available in the environment, or what their purpose is. This would impact regular users as they do not have administrative privileges to view subtasks definitions in the Administration module.\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Environment\r\nConsistently reproduced in JIRA 7.0.0+\r\nNot related to browser as behavior was consistent across browsers\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Be in a JIRA 7.0.0+ environment\r\n# Click *Create* to open the *Create Issue* screen, and click the Question Mark icon next to the Issue Type field.\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nSubtasks should have an icon, title, and description\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nThe correct number of Subtasks is shown (Indicating JIRA is aware of them), but have no icon, title, or description\r\n \r\n\r\nh3.

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-59531].\n  {panel}\n\nh3. Problem Definition\r\n* The documentation  https://confluence.atlassian.com/jira/connecting-jira-to-postgresql-185729433.html cover a minimal amount of basic security configuration so that the database user ID which JIRA uses to connect to the database is properly configured. It would be great if this article be clarified and extended so a systems administrator can configure PostgreSQL for JIRA quickly, without having to do a lot of research or carefully study the dozens of comments in the link you provided.\r\n* Specifically, the existing documentation describes PostgreSQL commands to create the empty jiradb database and establish the PostgreSQL user named 'jira'. But the existing documentation neglects to describe configuring securty so PostgreSQL user id's and passwords are utilized for authentication (which is how JIRA and Confluence expect PostgreSQL to behave).\r\n* This would help numerous Atassian end users, reduce database connectivity issues and perhaps reduce end-user support requests at Atlassian. The current documentation on this process could stand to be improved.\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n* Please include how to configure PostgreSQL security in pg_hba.conf. The instructions provided by Atlasssian advise an authentication type of 'trust', which is insecure.\r\n* The documentation should be clarified and expanded to provide directions for setting up the jira database user using 'md5' type authentication in pg_hba.conf.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround \r\nRefer to the PostgreSQL official documentation :\r\n* http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/auth-pg-hba-conf.html",

It's just to give us a little bit more of the already existing information in the UI.\r\n\r\nAnother option would be to let health checker only check the tables relevant for JIRA but this could become a more difficult task since this might be hard to answer for some tables.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nDieter",

Summary\r\nRegardless of the context path setup for JIRA, accessing the *Release Notes* link from a version's details page builds a URL with context path {{/jira}}, which possibly results in a 404 error.\r\n\r\nh3.

Expected Behavior\r\nThe context path should be retrieved from the application's Base URL, and not hard-coded.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Behavior\r\nEvery time the URL for Release Notes is built, the context path is set to {{/jira}}.\r\n\r\nh3.Workaround\r\nh5.

Summary\r\nUpgrading to JIRA 7 while using the built-in (in-memory) database fails with error:\r\n{code}\r\nproblem adding Upgrade Task Deleting invalid version associations\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nh3. Environment\r\n* This affects the migration from HSQL to H2. H2 is the new built-in database introduced in JIRA7, while HSQL has been in use across all versions prior to JIRA7. \r\n* JIRA will need to perform some migration steps to move from HSQL to H2. (this is done automatically during upgrade)\r\n* Effectively, this means the bug affects any customer currently using the internal HSQL database and is upgrading to JIRA 7.0 or newer. \r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Install JIRA 6.4.11 using the installer. Complete the setup process through the browser as well, then shut down JIRA.\r\n# Upgrade the installation in step 1 using any JIRA 7.0.x version installer. \r\n# At one point during the migration from HSQL to H2 procedure (you can track this in the logs), you will be asked to restart:\r\n{code}\r\n2016-01-12 23:33:58,362 localhost-startStop-1 WARN      [c.a.jira.startup.EmbeddedDatabaseMigrator]\r\n\r\n    *****************************************************\r\n    JIRA must be restarted to complete the import process\r\n    *****************************************************\r\n\r\n\r\n    Please restart JIRA to complete the HSQL to H2 database migration\r\n{code}\r\n(i) The UI will also inform you that you need to restart JIRA.

But it would limit my ability to expand JIRA's capacity of work.\r\n\r\nAnyways, \r\n\r\nCurrently, JIRA has Epic as an \"Agile\" issue type that can gather multiple user stories and bug fixes. However, there are some users that are confused on understanding the meaning of the word *Epic*. Is Epic a requirement issue type? Super User Stories? Or something else. \r\n\r\nIn order for me as JIRA administrator is to extend the ability to create other Epic level issue types (like Requirement, etc) in order for users to get clarity on creating their tickets. \r\n\r\nP.S: As a reference, look how admins are able to create subtask-level issue types in addition to the *Sub-task*.\r\n\r\nThanks",

Summary\r\nRegardless of the context path setup for JIRA, accessing the *Release Notes* link from a version's details page builds a URL with context path {{/jira}}, which possibly results in a 404 error.\r\n\r\nh3.

Environment\r\n\r\nJIRA 6.4.12 -> JIRA 7.0.5\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n1) Import a CSV file with the following content:\r\nSummary;Fix Version;Original Estimate (in seconds);Issue Type\r\nissue 1 (estimated 8h = 1d);1.2.3;28800;Task\r\nissue 2 (estimated 40h = 5 d = 1w);1.2.3;144000;Task\r\nissue 3 (estimated 2h = 0.25 d);1.2.3;7200;Task\r\nissue 4 (estimated 15' = 0.25 h);1.2.3;900;Task\r\n\r\n2) Open the Issue navigator to see the time tracking value\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nindependent from default time tracking unit the result should be\r\nissue 1: 1d\r\nissue 2: 1w\r\nissue 3: 2h\r\nissue 4: 0.25h \r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\n(time tracking set to day)\r\nissue 1: 0d\r\nissue 2: 1d\r\nissue 3: 0d\r\nissue 4: 0d\r\nand if default time tracking is set to hour:\r\nissue 1: 1d\r\nissue 2: 5d\r\nissue 3: 0.25d\r\nissue 4: 0d\r\nand if default time tracking is set to minutes:\r\nissue 1: 1d\r\nissue 2: 5d\r\nissue 3: 0.25d\r\nissue 4: 0.25h\r\nand if default time tracking is set to weeks:\r\nissue 1: 0d\r\nissue 2: 0d\r\nissue 3: 0d\r\nissue 4: 0h\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nImporting for External Import function will import the CSV file with right time tracking value.",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-59424].\n  {panel}\n\nAs per costumer feedback:\r\n{quote}\r\nIt may be better to exclude the whole /jira-home/caches/ directory all together, as it looks like this is just temporary content as well as the indexes. There is also the tmp folder, which looks to be the same kind of thing. I'd guess those two locations are the most likely to be modified during a copy.\r\n\r\nI've tried copying the HOME folder without either of those two directories (using exclude commands in rsync) and Jira actually starts up fine without them. It re-creates them when it first runs and starts to fill them with content again. The index page says that the index is missing and that it should be restored and re-built; re-creating it only took 6 minutes or our test system.\r\n\r\nI think it would be very good to update the documentation in light of all this. Right now, it says \"create a snapshot of the data directory (including all files and subdirectories), then back up the snapshot\":\r\n\r\nhttps://confluence.atlassian.com/jira/backing-up-data-185729581.html\r\n\r\nI think it would be better and clearer to say:\r\n\r\n\"The recommended method of backing up the data directory is to copy it to another location while excluding both the /jira-data/caches/ and /jira-data/tmp folders, and then to archive the copied folder (using zip, tar.gz, etc). This is because the content in those two folders is frequently modified, which may cause the copy to fail, and because Jira will simply re-create these folders and their content if they are missing.\r\n\r\nNOTE: the Jira index is stored inside the caches directory, so will be lost using this method. You can enable \"restorable index\" in the system options to create backups of the index, which you can then restore later. Alternatively, if time is available, you can re-create the index from scratch after you have restored Jira.\r\n\r\nHere is an example rsync command for the copy:\r\n\r\nrsync -avh --delete --exclude 'caches' --exclude 'tmp' --stats --progress /jira-data/ /jira-rsync/\r\n\r\n\"\r\n\r\nThat would definately have helped me when I was configuring the backup.\r\n{quote}",
