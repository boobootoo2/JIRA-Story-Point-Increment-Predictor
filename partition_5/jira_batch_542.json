Problem Definition\nUsers that do not have the JIRA Administrator Global Permission are able to make Permission Scheme changes.\n\n# Login as a user with the JIRA Global Permission of at least JIRA Administrator or more.\n# Modify the Service Desk Project Permission Scheme. In this case, we removed all users from having the Permission to Delete Issues. Some organizations have the requirement to NOT Delete any Issues in their Service Desk Project.\n# Login as a User that DOES NOT have the JIRA Administrators Global Permission, but is a Service Desk Project Admin.\n# This User will receive a Yellow and White Pop-up box that says: \"This service desk project may not work as expected. View details and repair the problem\"\n# This User receives the \"Permission scheme error\" with the button \"Upgrade Permission Scheme\". The User that DOES NOT have the JIRA Administrator Global Permission clicks this button.\n# The ability to Delete Issues has been _added back_ to the Permission Scheme.\n\nh3. Suggested Solution\nOnly allow users that have been granted the JIRA Administrator Global Permission - just as it is in JIRA Core Projects - be able to modify Permission Schemes. No other users with lesser JIRA Global Permissions should have the ability to see the \"Upgrade Permission Scheme\" button, and be able to make changes to a Permission Scheme.\n \nh3. Workaround \nOnly have Project Admins that you want to be able to modify Permission Schemes be able to be Service Desk Project Admins. This is not the case with JIRA Core Projects. In JIRA Core Projects, you can have a Project Administrator NOT have to have the JIRA Administrator Global Permission. Those Project Admins do not have the ability to make changes to Permission Schemes. This should be the case with Service Desk as well.",

Summary\n\nWhen connecting a Service Desk project to a HipChat room, if we filter the configuration to issue types, operations carried out by customers are not generating notifications in HipChat.\n\nIt still works with agents or when there's no filter.\n\nh3. Environment\n* HipChat Cloud.\n* Tested in 7.1.0-OD-02-030\n\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\n# Create a Service Desk project with an issue type, say \u2018IT Help\u2019\n# Connect with HipChat\n# Set a room to be notified on comments in the project and filter by \u2018IT Help\u2019\n!hc_config.png|thumbnail!\n# Create an issue of type \u2018IT Help\u2019\n# Log in as an agent and comment on the issue\n# Log in as a customer and comment on the issue\n\nh3. Expected Results\nBoth comments generate a notification in HipChat.\n\nh3. Actual Results\nOnly the comment made by the agent generates notifications.\n \nh3. Notes\nThis is similar to this bug:\nhttps://jira.atlassian.com/browse/HCPUB-38\n\nHowever, that bug seems to happen regardless of filter and it\u2019s created for JIRA Server and HipChat Server.\n\nh3.Workaround\n*Partial Workaround*\nSet issue types match to all.",

Before launching this new feature, our goal was to make service desk notification more conversational. We\u2019ve made a decision to move forward with helping agents save time with a friendly greeting and sign off with the agent name to make it more personal. We acknowledge that this functionality isn't for every agent and your desire to customize these responses.\nSo far we've added additional translation strings for German, French and Japanese. \nYou can also help us in translating for your language here if it is missing https://translations.atlassian.com/. \nThe string are:\n\n{noformat}\nsd.comment.prepopulated.default.greeting=Hi {0},\nsd.comment.prepopulated.default.anonymous.greeting=Hi,\n{noformat}\n\nThe ability to edit these responses will require a bit more thought, the immediate action for us is to provide an option for agents to turn this functionality off as they wish in the upcoming release. If you want to customise further, it's being tracked at https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSD-631.\n\nThanks for your patience and we hope you appreciate our open approach to feature requests.If you have further questions or comments, please feel free to contact me directly as well at jhuynh at atlassian dot com.\n\nBests,\nThe JIRA Service Desk team\n{panel}\n\n",

It would be nice to have a configuration panel for those.\n\nh3. Workaround\nh5. Option #1 (recommended)\nUnassign the groups you want renamed from every request type and create a new group, assigning those to a new group.\n\nh5. Option #2 (unsupported)\nThis option involves data manipulation directly on JIRA's database and should be applied at your own risk. It's strongly recommended to have the database backed up before proceeding and testing such approach on a staging environment.\n\nService Desk's groups are stored in a database table called {{AO_54307E_GROUP}}, which contains the ID for the actual group and a {{VIEWPORT_ID}} column which identifies the Service Desk it's associated with. So, in order to rename a group, follow the below instructions.\n# Check the {{VIEWPORT_ID}} that corresponds to the Service Desk you want groups modified;\n{code:sql}\nSELECT \"ID\" FROM \"AO_54307E_VIEWPORT\" WHERE \"KEY\" IN ('sd-project-key');\n{code}\n(i) _Replace_ {{sd-project-key}} _with the project key for your Service Desk project *in lower case*._\n# With that ID, run the query below to show all groups associated with that Service Desk;\n{code:sql}\nSELECT * FROM \"AO_54307E_GROUP\" WHERE \"VIEWPORT_ID\" = id-from-step-1;\n{code}\n# Take note of the ID of the group/s  you want to modify and run the {{UPDATE}} query below accordingly.\n{code:sql}\nUPDATE \"AO_54307E_GROUP\" WHERE \"ID\" = id-from-step-2;\n{code}",
