This does not occur in HTTP configs. \r\n\r\nThe {{os_destination}} parameter on the {{login.jsp}} page (and other pages once logged in - see technical details below) allows you to redirect to any site if the URL is prefixed with two slashes.\r\n\r\n*Reproduction*\r\n* Browse to the following link (replacing {{jira.example.com}} with your own test server).\r\n* *https*://jira.example.com/login.jsp?os_destination=%2F%2Fatlassian.com\r\n* Log in, and see that your browser is redirected to atlassian.com.\r\n\r\n*Example reque*\r\n{code}HTTP/1.1 302 Found\r\nServer: Apache-Coyote/1.1\r\nX-AREQUESTID: 903x5883x1\r\nX-ASESSIONID: lw2agc\r\nCache-Control: no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate\r\nPragma: no-cache\r\nExpires: Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 GMT\r\nX-Seraph-LoginReason: OK\r\nLocation: https://atlassian.com\r\nContent-Type: text/html;charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Length: 0\r\nDate: Tue, 22 Apr 2014 22:03:47 GMT{code}\r\n\r\nI was only able to get redirects to work if the redirect URL begins with {{//}} (or {{%2F%2F}} when URL-encoded). Having special characters (such as the colon in {{http://}}) will redirect the user to the dashboard page, so it seems you can't redirect to the user to links with any other protocols.\r\n\r\nIf the user is already logged in, it doesn't seem to matter which page the {{os_destination}} parameter is on. Even if it's a page that doesn't exist, it will still redirect the user immediately. For example:\r\nhttps://jira.example.com/ThisCanBeAnything?os_destination=%2F%2Fatlassian.com\r\nhttps://jira.example.com/AnythingYouWant?os_destination=%2F%2Fatlassian.com\r\n\r\nI tested this on versions 5.2.11, 6.2, and 6.2.2, but other versions are likely vulnerable as well.\r\n\r\n*Solution*\r\nConfluence solves this problem by concatenating the site's URL with the contents of {{os_destination}}. So for our above example, it would redirect you to https://jira.example.com//atlassian.com which is still an example.com site.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you could have any {{os_destination}} that begins with {{//}} just redirect the user to the dashboard like what is done with special characters.\r\n",

We use a novell, and decided to use LDAP in order to allow users to login using their credentials. But, we've been running across issues. I've logged in several times with my credentials and somehow logged in with someone else's account. Although, I still have administration rights and it doesn't seem to move it to the users I log into. Another user who is also an admin is having the same issue herself, in which she logs in with my ID somehow. Also, we have testrail and integrated JIRA. When we push a ticket to our JIRA site, it'll have the issue come up then so sometimes it'll post the ticket with different user IDs than what it's supposed to be doing. \r\n\r\nI've tried re-adding the LDAP settings to make sure I'm doing it right, but this issue has become a daily issue.\r\n\r\nWe are using JIRA v6.2.2 and SuSE Enterprise Server 11 SP2 (using VMWare)\r\n\r\nPlease assist!

Although we already set up the way you instructed, which is below, the tickets are still auto assigned to one of our guys. And for some reasons, that guy actually has two names appearing in the system under the same email address.I feel this could be a problem and cause unnecessary redundancy and inconsistency to our ticketing system. \r\n\r\nBelow is the answer you gave us before, we did exactly what you told us to. But the problem is still happening.\r\n\r\nThis is actually configured in the Administration \u00bb Projects \u00bb 'Your Project' \u00bb Roles (tab) screen - you can see in the top a Default Assignee option, which you can select \"Unassigned\". Just make sure the Allow unassigned issues flag is turned on in the General Configuration settings in JIRA.\r\n\r\nI understand this is not the first time we get to you on this issue and please forgive for all those troubles. \r\n\r\nFeel free to call at 6463804320 for further questions or details. \r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nGabrielle Yang | Jr. Linux System Administrator | eXelate\r\n\r\n7 West 22nd Street, 9th Floor, New York, NY 10010\r\n",

The reason was - the docs say nothing about plan configuration in Bamboo to make the gadget work. There is only information about Application Links and Authorization. To fix this it would be great to put on this page addition information that to get the pretty picture like the one attached to page, user needs to have Clover integration enabled in Bamboo plan. Otherwise the error will be displayed and for a long time I was thinking I did something wrong with the applinks. It's good that we have Clover developer here in Gdansk (Marek Parfianowicz) who helped me with that. It would be great if the additional information about Clover could be added to this page.\r\n\r\nMy suggestion: on the https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Adding+the+Clover+Coverage+Gadget page there is information border about integrating Bamboo and JIRA. My suggestion is to add there information about Bamboo integration with Clover: https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/BAMBOO/Using+Bamboo+with+Clover",

      "description": "We have a customer with a large JIRA (1M issues) and every two weeks they have to restart JIRA because it is running out of file descriptors. We increased the system setting from 30K to 300K descriptors but it still happens eventually. We're using SSD for the JIRA home directory\r\n\r\nI've done some investigation and found that on the production JIRA using lsof and the counts on the Lucene issue index files increase every 5 minutes or so. On staging it's only once or twice per day. The rate is lower at weekends, so it is human-related. What happens is that the same 60 different index files have new file descriptors added, but the old file descriptors are not closed. There is also an error that appears at the same time in the JIRA log file:\r\n\r\n\"Tried to reopen the IndexReader, but it threw AlreadyClosedException. Opening a fresh IndexReader.\"\r\n\r\nThis comes from DefaultIndexEngine and is where a new Lucene IndexReader is created if the previous one is believed closed. I suspect that the previous IndexReader may not have been really closed.\r\n\r\nThere is a comment right in that place in the source code. It's the \"don't worry\" that makes me think there is still a problem around here!\r\n\r\n// JRADEV-7825: Really this shouldn't happen unless someone closes the reader from outside all\r\n                        // the inscrutable code in this class (and its friends) but\r\n                        // don't worry, we will just open a new one in that case.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is similar symptoms but apparently a different cause than https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRAKB/Loss+of+Functionality+due+to+Too+Many+Open+Files+Error",

There are good reasons to do that since ActionConfiguration.getActionCommand() causes a lot of requests to Configuration.get()\r\n\r\nThough in the same thread JiraWebworkViewDispatcher.getActionConfiguration() ActionConfiguration.getActionCommand() is called again later which makes the caching less useful. JiraWebworkViewDispatcher should also call the caching code within method LookupAliasActionFactoryProxy.getActionImpl(). One could factor out the the caching code into a separate module and inject it in all places where ActionConfiguration is needed.\r\n\r\nI have checked the source for 6.2.3 but likely earlier version also show this behaviour.\r\n\r\nThis is easy to fix and should make it's way into at least 6.3.x. My tests showed that the overall response time when calling a webwork action drops from 300 to 250 ms.  \r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nDieter",

The issue has now been reopened and I need to update the Sprint from the old to the current open sprint. However, I cannot do that and I am only allowed to add the new sprint, not replace it to the old completed sprint. In the past this was entirely possible.\r\n\r\nIt would be advisable to allow this based on a configuration parameter or permit the change only to a select group of people (e.g. administrators).\r\n",

This is a nice way to track a threaded conversation -- much better than email.  Sometimes the set of posts can be very long.  It would be nice to number the posts in order to refer to them.  For example, it would be nice to say something like \"see Bob's post #12 in issue XYZ-42.  \r\n\r\nFurther, it would be nice to be able to link to individual posts using post ids.  Yes, I know you can create or access a permanent link to each post, but that's not useful in a conversation. Instead of an obscure sequence of letters and numbers, posts could be referenced using the issue number and the post number.  For example, XYZ-42.12 would refer to post #12 in issue YXZ-42.\r\n\r\nThanks for considering this for a future release.",

I am very glad to see the feature being added to the new designer.  The one drawback I've noticed about the way that it has been implemented is that the transition id numbers are no longer listed next to the transition names like they were in the classic designer.  This becomes problematic when you have multiple transitions with the same name but different properties leading to the same destination step.  If you want to make a transition common with one of those, there is no good way to figure out the proper transition to choose.  Your only choices are trial and error or temporarily editing your transition names.\r\n\r\nIn short, I'd like to see the transition ids added to the \"Transition to reuse\" dropdown on the \"Reuse a transition\" tab.",

Workaround\r\n\r\nTo work around this issue, call the filter by number and apply the sort at the time of use. Example:\r\n\r\n{code}filter = 47420 ORDER BY priority DESC{code}\r\n\r\nAs reported by a customer:\r\n\r\n{quote}An Employee created a search filter. \r\nWhen run it includes the ORDER BY priority DESC.\r\nIf you go to the full url of the search string it works as expected, and you can click on the P column to sort by priority. Given the operator in the filter it appears properly as descending.\r\nIf within Jira you do a search filter=\"some sumber\"\r\nIt displays the tickets, however the priority is not shown in DESC order. There is no way of course to click on it either. \r\nThis is causing issues as we use the Jira macro to list jira tickets based on a filter. While prior with wiki mark up we could add operators, this is not possible now.\r\nIn this case with the Jira macro it truncates the url to filter=\"some number\"\r\nThis is an issue as we want to display the list properly sorted based on the search criteria. We are able to replicate this in Jira, but creating a filter, then doing a search with filter=\"Some number\"{quote}\r\n\r\nh5. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Go to Manage Filters\r\n# Identify the filterid of any filter\r\n# Go to the Issue Navigator\r\n-# In Advanced mode, enter filter=<id>\r\n# Compare to the results of clicking through to the filter from Manage Filters",

With this, all references to user names are now in lowercase.\r\n* https://developer.atlassian.com/display/JIRADEV/Renamable+Users+in+JIRA+6.0\r\n\r\nh4. Problem\r\nAfter upgrade from a previous version to 6.0+, users are not able to manage their old attachments. They are also not seen as owners of the attachments.\r\n\r\nh4. Steps to Reproduce\r\n* Have JIRA 5.x\r\n* Ensure that users can only have *Delete Own Attachments* and not the 'Delete All Attachments'\r\n* Log in as an user with capital letters in the username (e.g. Testuser)\r\n* Attach a file to a ticket\r\n** Notice that it can be managed/removed\r\n* Upgrade JIRA to 6.x\r\n* View the same attachment, as Testuser\r\n* Notice that it cannot be managed/removed\r\n* Newly attached files can be managed just fine.\r\n\r\nh4. Cause\r\nThe problem is that the *fileattachment* table is not properly updated to reflect the lowercase references. With that, users are not associated to their older attachments, thus cannot manage them.\r\n\r\nIn the database, notice the following:\r\n{code}\r\njira622=# select id, issueid, filename, created, author from fileattachment ;\r\n  id   | issueid |          filename           |          created           |  author  \r\n-------+---------+-----------------------------+----------------------------+----------\r\n 10002 |   10000 | how-to-draw-godzilla-16.gif | 2014-04-17 12:59:11.845-07 | admin\r\n 10003 |   10000 | n60mXA5.gif                 | 2014-04-17 13:02:57.969-07 | testuser\r\n 10001 |   10000 | 1313889118993.jpg           | 2014-04-16 12:58:52.348-07 | Testuser\r\n(3 rows)\r\n{code}\r\n* notice the authors:\r\n** the old attachment is listed with author \"Testuser\"\r\n** the new attachment is listed as \"testuser\"\r\n\r\nh4. Workaround\r\n* Update the database and change the author names to be lowercase\r\nor\r\n* Have an account that is able to \"Delete All Attachments\" help manage old attachments",
