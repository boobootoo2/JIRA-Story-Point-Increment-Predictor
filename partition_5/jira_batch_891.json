The issue to use is chosen from the first issue key found in the email subject\r\n\r\nAnd the [CreateOrCommentHandler|http://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/docs/latest/services.html#N1035E]:\r\n\r\nbq. If the subject contains an issue key, the message is added as a comment to that issue. If no issue key is found, a new issue is created in the default project.\r\n\r\nAll that information is not accurate enough. This is the way it works:\r\n\r\nFor the FullCommentHandler and the NonQuotedCommentHandler, first we check the mail subject for an issue id. If it is found, we attempt to add a comment to that issue. If no issue id is found in the subject, we check the in-reply-to header on the email, and cross check with all the notifications Jira has sent. If there is a match, we comment on the issue that originated the notification. If not issue is found, the email will not comment any issue.\r\n\r\nFor the CreateOrCommentHandler, we follow the same process to identify on which issue to comment, but if no issue is found, we create a new one.\r\n\r\nIt would be good to add this level of detail in the documentation, as we have had several customers confused about this functionality,",
