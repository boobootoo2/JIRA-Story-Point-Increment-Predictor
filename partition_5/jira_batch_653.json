Suggested Solution\r\n* Currently, in our upgrade notes, there is already a section for [known issue|https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirasoftware/jira-software-7-2-x-upgrade-notes-834230197.html#JIRASoftware7.2.xupgradenotes-Informationforadministrators].\r\n* I would suggest that we link Admins to this section instead rather than to the Knowlege Base\r\n* Improve the 'Known Issue' section as well to be up to date to ensure a list of known issue to be retrieved from JAC \r\n \r\nh3.

Summary\r\nIf the jira instance is restarted after adding an entry for a delayed upgrade task in the database, but before it's complete, it can end up in an invalid state whereby on next boot, it will try to add the delayed upgrade task again and fail due to a public key conflict.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce.\r\n# Have a database with values from an older version of JIRA.\r\n# Update to a version of JIRA where the last upgrade task is a delayed upgrade task.\r\n# Stop jira after the entry has been added into the database about the upgrade task, but before it has completed.\r\n# Try to start JIRA up again.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results.\r\nJIRA starts up fine and the delayed upgrade task runs at the next reasonable time.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nJIRA breaks and needs manual database entry changes before it'll work again.\r\n\r\nh3.

Summary\r\n\r\nIn a JIRA Data Center Environment, ClassNotFoundException can be seen in the logs due to an installed plugin thread initializing JIRA Data Center cache with its own classloader.\r\nh3. Environment\r\n * JIRA Data Center\r\n * Reproduced with JIRA Data Center 7.1.x with Structure Plugin 3.1\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Setup a JIRA Data Center with at least 2 nodes.\r\n # Find / build a plug-in which starts a thread in a constructor / plugin event / module event listener.\r\n # That thread inside of the 3rd party plug-in / custom made plugin should be the first who initialises the cache.

You can use the attached jira-cache-accessor-plugin.jar as a demo how to init the cache with the wrong classloader.\r\n # Observe the logs during JIRA startup. Alternative - see the logs on cache synchronization.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nJIRA webapp classloader is used to initialize and access the cache, and there are no errors with replicating the cache to other nodes\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n # Cache is initialized with the plugin's class loader, rather than the correct class loader for the code.\u00a0\r\n (i)\u00a0In the sample plug-in we can see that \u00a0see now which class loader used to init the\u00a0EagerOfBizUserCache. I.e. *initialized with class loader: BundleDelegatingClassLoader.*\u00a0To see that I've modified\u00a0EagerOfBizUserCache to log which class loader is used to initialize the cache.\r\n # Errors similar to the following are thrown in the application logs during cache replication to other nodes.

Workaround (for plugin developers)\r\n * Plugin developers may consider wrapping such calls with a class loader switching code, to ensure that the right class loader is used. For example, in a case of calling ApplicationUser's static methods, the class loader switch may be as easy as:\r\n{code:java}\r\nClassLoader previous = Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader();\r\ntry {\r\n\u2002\u2002 Thread.currentThread().setContextClassLoader(ApplicationUsers.class.getClassLoader());\r\n\u2002\u2002 ApplicationUsers.getKey() \r\n} finally {\r\n\u2002\u2002 Thread.currentThread().setContextClassLoader(previous);\r\n}\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround (for users)\r\n # Disable the plugin that triggered the cache problem: Structure or other\r\n # Restart node(s) not having mentioned error\r\n # Enable plugin again\r\n\r\nh3. Alternative Workaround (for users)\r\n\r\nIf the workaround above does not work on your case, try the following:\r\n # Disable the plugin triggering the cache problem (Structure, ScriptRunner or other).\r\n # Remove\u00a0*node1* from the load balancer and restart JIRA on that node.\r\n # When\u00a0*node1* is back up, re-add it to the load balancer and restart\u00a0*node2*.\r\n # Repeat steps 2-3 for the other nodes.\r\n # After all nodes have been restarted, enable the plugin causing the issue again.\r\n\r\nh5.

Summary\r\n\r\n\"Invite User\" function should send email out as the address set in \"Outgoing Mail\", instead of using the current logged in user's email address as the \"From\" address. Some SMTP servers will reject emails because of this.\r\nh3. Environment\r\n\r\nJIRA 7.1.x\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Login as any admin user and send out invites by using \"Invite User\" function.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nInvite email should be sent out\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nThe invite email will not be sent, SMTP server returns errors such as \"553 Mail from must equal authorized user\" or \"554 Message Rejected\" depending on what SMTP server is used. This is because the \"From\" address header does not match the user address set in JIRA's \"Outgoing Mail\".\r\n\r\nHowever, this problem does not apply to all SMTP servers, GMail for example, automatically strips & replace the \"From\" address, and still send out the email. As shown in the example email header below, the original \"From\" address header is stripped and moved to \"X-Google-Original-From\".\r\n{code:java}\r\nReturn-Path: <smtpserver@gmail.com>\r\nReceived: from apackl ([111.11.11.111])\r\n        by smtp.gmail.com with ESMTPSA id r21sm12370338pfi.52.2016.07.27.20.29.03\r\n        for <user@gmail.com>\r\n        (version=TLS1_2 cipher=ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256 bits=128/128);\r\n        Wed, 27 Jul 2016 20:29:04 -0700 (PDT)\r\nFrom: \"admin (JIRA)\" <smtpserver@gmail.com>\r\nX-Google-Original-From: \"admin (JIRA)\" <admin@example.com>\r\nDate: Thu, 28 Jul 2016 11:29:01 +0800 (MYT)\r\nReply-To: admin@example.com\r\nTo: user@gmail.com{code}\r\nTo avoid this problem, the \"Invite User\" function should really use the address set in the outgoing mail server settings as the \"From\" address (which would be the same as how JIRA notifications are being sent out), instead of using the current logged in user's email.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nThe KB article [550 5.7.1 Unable to Relay Mail From Exchange Server - Atlassian Documentation|https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirakb/550-5-7-1-unable-to-relay-mail-from-exchange-server-143884327.html] explains that it might be possible to change the configuration of your mail server to then allow for the relaying of messages",

Under the current implementation I am mapping customer issues to our product release on a JIRA project by project basis. This is fine for a customer-facing view. But there are scenarios where I have implemented a couple JIRA projects for 1 customer to accommodate their workflow. In this 2nd scenario looking at a release on a JIRA project by project basis fails.\r\n\r\n*Requested Behaviour*\r\nAllow to view multiple release version under one release view page. We can have this in board's release menu. Customer could define a product version, and under that have various releases versions. Then in any of the JIRA projects they would just tie the project to that product version(s), and thereafter be able to select fix version(s) from the list of releases that exist under that product version.\r\n\r\n",

In the case where a customer wants to include this field in an 'Issue Collector' as a 'Required' field, the customer cannot as placing this requirement on the existing 'Attachment' field would alter this fields behavior for the entire JIRA instance.\r\n\r\n\r\nh3.

Expected Results\r\nWhen clicking the 'Add custom field' button, a user should be able to search for 'Attachment'\r\nThe user should be able to apply the same type of attributes to this field as they would with the already existing 'Attachment' field: Required, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nWhen clicking the 'Add custom field' button and searching for 'Attachment' there are no results found as we currently do not allow for a custom field of the type 'Attachment' to be created\r\n\r\n \r\nh3. Notes\r\nIn the case of requiring an attachment field within an 'Issue Collector' form, this is not possible as we do not outright expose the code for the 'Issue Collector'. This means that validating the 'Attachment' field is not possible as there is no way to attach the 'onClick' event to the form submission button\r\n",
