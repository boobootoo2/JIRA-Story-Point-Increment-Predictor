[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-21176].\n  {panel}\n\nWhen creating a new issue i would like to be able to have a few lines of static text on top of the form where i create the issue, which is customizable depending on issue-type or project. In short a custom field that does not contain any input at all, just a snip of text where i might insert HTML or simple instructions about the issue the user is about to create. \r\n\r\nWhat would be the best practice for this? My workaround idea is a radio-checkbox which filled or not makes no difference, but using the descriptor field allows me to create java/html or simply text that is seen when creating the issue, but since the box fills no purpose, maybe there is a better way?

This results in the second request getting a 404 (since jfreechart already deleted it).\r\n\r\njfreechart also supports \"per-session\" images. We just need to pass in the HttpSession instead of null and jfreechart will keep the image around for the session.\r\n\r\nAndreas thinks this change was supposed to have happened in 4.0.x but it appears to have fallen through the cracks.

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-21118].\n  {panel}\n\nHi Rosie,\r\n \r\nI am introducing my employer to JIRA for the first time so have become the JIRA administrator by default. I have a good idea of what I'd like the system to do but would like a bit more reference/procedural material to help me set it up correctly from the start.\r\n \r\nThe page http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/EHOSTING/JIRA+Hosted+101 is superb - I love how you've made it possible to scan down the page using expandable links and I think the \"Why would I do this?\" question is a fantastic device! \r\n \r\nMy request is for more information (though not necessarily for hosted services customers only):\r\n \r\n1. General recommendations for setup - Include an overall workflow for new customers. Perhaps a flow diagram as well?\r\nwhat you need to do and in what order. i.e. create project first, adopt or redesign issues? add users first? design project roles first?  What not to do before another task.\r\n \r\n2. Personally, I have to set up this situation on a hosted system so I was looking for some more complex scenario documentation than that currently available.\r\n\r\n    *\r\n      e.g. For example when allocating 6 users to 3 different projects but giving them different roles in each project. Some users work in all three, some in just two. Two projects need to allow cross-project linking.\r\n    *\r\n      My PM wants to be able to export some issue data to export into another database - what do I need to do to facilitate this?\r\n\r\n \r\n3. What are schemes really designed for? What should I watch out for when setting one up? Why does the system display both the default and the customised scheme within a given project?\r\n \r\n4. Give a breakdown of a small part of a workflow and explain a typical design - what's mandatory, purpose is served by a transition,   \r\n \r\n5. If I delete a default issue etc, how can I retrieve it?\r\n \r\n6. The whole area of the default settings and how they can be customised is a bit confused especially as a given project is displayed as using a \"default...\" as well as a  \".<customised> scheme\". I cannot distinguish which settings are coming from each source and would like to understand how the customised bits work... superimposed over template default?  how the default plays into a project nevertheless?. \r\n \r\n   default groups needs more clarification - for example:\r\n\r\n    *\r\n      a detailed table about what each of the default groups can do.\r\n    *\r\n      for instance why don't my new users receive a username/password email?\r\n    *\r\n      When I click jira-developers in the default browser, I see that there are \"no permisssions/notifications/issue security or saved filters associated with this group\"  yet members of that group do receive notifications. How is that explained?\r\n    *\r\n      what are the advantages of setting up my own groups and what should I watch out for\r\n\r\n \r\nHope this makes sense.\r\n \r\nHaving said that, I think JIRA is remarkably well designed. It has such a great, simple and consistent interface. And it's got extensive help! - I love the fact I can communicate feedback to the author! \r\nBut am trying to get the hang of organising the system to suit our needs and struggling a bit.\r\n \r\nThanks, Celia \r\n",

The iframe would contain a page in JIRA. The victim would believe he was clicking on the other site but would actually be clicking in JIRA and performing actions he didn't intend.\r\n\r\nIt enables attackers to perform many actions in our apps, provided that:\r\n    * The victim has an active session or \"remember me\" is set, and\r\n    * The victim can be tricked into clicking or typing into an innocent-looking page element on a third-party site.\r\n\r\nIt requires no XSS vulnerability in JIRA in order to exploit.\r\n\r\nTwitter's solution to this was to include a line of JavaScript at the top of every page to break out of frames. This might not work as a broad-scale solution for us (GreenHopper and gadgets both use iframes legitimately) but could be used for administration pages at least.\r\n\r\nThis threat could be partially mitigated by requiring two clicks for any major administration action. e.g. Currently you can go directly to the project deletion confirmation page and delete a project in one click. If the confirmation page was also XSRF-protected (not just the deletion action itself), it would behave the same for an end-user but would be harder for an attacker to exploit.\r\n\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nExample attack: This button on some random website gives no indication of malice:\r\n\r\n!Clickjack1.png!\r\n\r\nBut clicking on it actually deletes a project in JIRA:\r\n\r\n!Clickjack2.png!\r\n\r\nThe example HTML for this attack is attached; just insert the ID of the project you want to delete into the iframe URL, and use with caution!",

That would improve usability but not solve the accessibility issues though.\r\n\r\nIt would be great if one could, for example through a plugin, swap the default CAPTCHA provider with another one. This could solve both readability and accessibility issues. The Recaptcha project at http://recaptcha.net/ \u2014 which was unfortunately dismissed without consideration in CONF-9026 \u2014 is an excellent candidate.\r\n\r\nNote that this improvement request is valid for other Atlassian products (e.g. CROWD, CONFLUENCE...)",

      "description": "Build a new gadget that would be added to one's dashboard that would show all issues that have been updated in some way that they \"typically\" would have been notified on via email (reporter, watcher - assignee would be optional).\r\n\r\nInstead of sending an email (or as an option, one could choose to only send notifications, only load into this gadget, or do both).  As the user reviews the change to an issue, they would check off that they are done with it, and it would fall off the gadget and no longer be displayed.\r\n\r\nI am desperately trying to reduce our reliance on email, and although email notifications are great for some things, it would be far better if most of this information was just contained in the JIRA tool itself, and one could go to the dashboard, review this gadget for a list of all issues that had some change to it that have yet to be reviewed, and then check it off in the gadget since you have now reviewed it.  This would allow a dramatic reduction in emails being sent.\r\n\r\nPerhaps additional functionality would be an option to have a digest sent from this gadget on some period - say daily or weekly - to remind the person to go to review this gadget, but this would be 1 email a day or week as opposed to the at least ~70+ that I get now each week due to people updating an issue in some way that I either reported or that I am a watcher on (I am in a leadership role, so I am tied to a bunch of issues in our system).\r\n\r\nI believe the ability to send out an instant email notification for someone who was just assigned an issue should still be allowed, but perhaps optionally.  I personally would leave this set to instant when I am assigned to an issue, and I would ask my team to do the same, but some users might want this to be an option.\r\n\r\nI know there is a \"to do\" list macro for Confluence that is similar to this request.  The difference is that this would be dynamically built by the JIRA gadget, and it would have to retain (persistent) all changes that you have not reviewed since the time the gadget was added to the dashboard.  Once the item was checked, it would be permanently removed from the gadget and no longer display (just like when I delete my notification email out of my inbox never to look at it again), but obviously all historical data is still retained in JIRA.",
