Appears to be wasting a lot of space on the tab bar area for open repositories.\r\n    \r\n3. Let me shrink the toolbar, its very and I only need small icon or word for those functions.\r\n\r\nmaybe 2. and 3. can be combined so together they save a lot of space they currently use....\r\n\r\n4. Commit dialog limits itself to inside the repo tab...\r\n    Can you make it fill the pane not offset shadow over background its wasting space and there is only an artistic reason of the shadow edge.\r\n\r\n5. Flipping from one repo tab to another is slow.\r\n    how about just give me a seperate window with each repo, alt-tab would be fast then.\r\n\r\n6. In Commit window - option to not show the staged changes, though you can drag lower pane to cover it - it reopens when i close and reopen commit window.\r\n\r\n7. In Commit window - prefer path/filename list not  a file column and a path column.\r\n   What im use to probably more than anything.\r\n   \r\n8. Diff's are pretty, but much space wasted in the diff view main window, and diff view in commit.\r\n   lots of gaps around edges and between diff sections.\r\n   \r\n9. Shortcut key to launch external diff ?\r\n\r\n10. Is it possible to unconfigure browser configuration ?\r\n    I selected 'configure browser integration' menu option not knowing what it did. \r\n",
