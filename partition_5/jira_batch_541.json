This however only works if the agent in question has already been provided with an Agent slot on the JIRA Service Desk license.\nAs a result, one of 3 different situations can occur:\n# If the user that the project administrator wants to invite *does not* have an Agent license, and the project administrator *does not* have JIRA Administrator permissions, the user *will not* show up in the user picker at all.\n# If the user that the project administrator wants to invite *does not* have an Agent license, and the project administrator *does* have JIRA Administrator permissions, the user *will* show up in the user picker and can get added. A subscript message will be shown that 1 additional license slot will be consumed.\n# If the user that the project administrator wants to invite *does* have an Agent license, the user *will* show up in the user picker, regardless of the fact that the project administrator has been provided with JIRA Administrator permissions.\n\nSituation 1 can cause confusion whenever project admins have been made responsible for setting up the Service Desk team. In many situations, providing them full instance administration permissions is not an option since this provides them a lot more privileges than required and wanted.\nInstead, in situation 1 all users should be possible in the user picker, regardless of their license positions. If a user can not get added due to not having the appropriate license, a message should indicate that a JIRA Administrator needs to get contacted to provide the appropriate license to these kind of users.",

Problem Definition\n\nCurrently an agent can create a JIRA Service Desk issue within JIRA without a request type specified.  You can specify the request type on the view issue screen but not the create issue screen. You can specify the issue type but it will not fill out the request type according to issue type>request match.  It will produce a \"No Match\" on the view issue screen after the issue is created even though the issue type is configured for the request type. This is because one issue type can map to several request types so this can't be done automatically. \n\nSee [Configuring request types and workflows |https://confluence.atlassian.com/servicedeskcloud/configuring-request-types-and-workflows-732528910.html] and [How JIRA and JIRA Service Desk work together|https://confluence.atlassian.com/servicedesk025/how-jira-and-jira-service-desk-work-together-754977568.html] for reference. \n!nomatch.png|thumbnail!\n\nSince you cannot specify the request type from create issue view within JIRA. It leaves a possibility that a customer may not be updated if an agent creates an issue from within JIRA.\n\nh3. Suggested Solution\n \nSince issues should be created via the customer issues should be created via the customer portal by design. Agents should be directed to a JIRA Service Desk Create issue screen where the request type can be specified via either the customer portal, a modified create issue screen, or request type appears on the create issue screen if project type = Service Desk is specified. \n\n\n\n",

Unfortunately I have to share some bad news.\r\n\r\nWe have had to redirect some of the resources on this project to an urgent need. Progress continues, but at a slower pace. As such, we are going to miss the end of year cut off, and this feature will now be pushed back to Q1 CY 2022.\r\n\r\nI know this is not what you all wanted to hear. My sincere apologies. This feature is definitely coming.\r\n\r\nCheers,\u00a0\r\n\r\nBen.\r\n{panel}\r\nh3. Problem Definition\r\n\r\nCurrently, if an attachment is included in a notification, an inline preview of the attachment is visible within the e-mail notification. Attempting to access the attachment redirects to the instance's hosted location of the attachment, requiring the user to login to the instance to retrieve the full attachment.\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nAllow the option for attachments to be included as an actual e-mail attachment within the e-mail notification so that the attachment can be downloaded directly from the e-mail without having to login to the instance.\r\nh3. Use Case\r\n\r\nMany Service Desks operate strictly via e-mail with their user base. Requiring the user to login to the instance adds extra steps and therefore making the process inefficient to work with.",

Problem Diagnosis:\nIn Service Desk, we could configure multiple SLA on one project and there is a chance that the issue will met every SLA conditions. This will make the issue show all SLA in the JIRA Issue details view regardless of the status of the SLA, hence if there is 9 SLA on the ticket and only 2 that is actually still running, the rest of the SLA will still shown when it should be less important compare to the running SLA.\n\nh3. Suggested Feature:\nHence, it will be great if we have a feature to hide any SLA that is currently not running it would be great. We could group the SLA together when it is Paused or Stopped in one section that could be expanded/collapse by the user. This will make the SLA details more neat.",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSDSERVER-3333].\n  {panel}\n\nMy organisation is currently in the process of migrating to JIRA Service Desk from our existing supplier, but one of the features that I am unable to identify within JIRA SD is the function to set the call status to automatically change on a given time/date.  For example, a request is logged but doesn't need to start until two weeks later, therefore we change the call status to 'On-Hold', but then specify the time and date when we would like the call status to automatically change to 'Open'.\n\nThis is an extremely important feature for us and would require this if we are to complete our migration.  Could I request that this feature is added at your earliest possible convenience please.  One possible way that I see this working in JIRA would be to add an Auto Status Change feature within a Workflow Transition.  However, I'm still fairly new to this so you may be able to advise of another solution.\n\nI look forward to hearing from you.\n\nMany thanks\nNathan\n\n",

However, this also gives access to all Confluence users.

Also cannot specify in Space Permissions who cannot view, only can.\n\nSo when you lock out everybody *except* admins, this will include also the SD customers.\n\nh3.

It would be even more awesome if the agents working \"behind the stage\" could also directly benefit from that, specifically with known error or workaround articles.\nA practical example from our use case:\nWe`ve linked JIRA SD with a confluence space which we feed with how-to articles tagged \"public\" and \"internal\" - the public articles help our users to solve their issues or answer their questions in self-service fashion. It would be great if JIRA SD would provide the same search/suggestion for \"internal\" tagged articles when an issue was created, so that the agent has already a set of internal articles which might fit to solve the issue.

[See the corresponding bug report|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSDSERVER-3296].\n  {panel}\n\n{panel:title=Update as of 2 February 2016|bgColor=#f5f5f5}\nThis issue was caused by Service Desk switching to preferring the html part of a mail message, over text, which was the previous default. The existing Html To Text converter produces a body that will cite links at the bottom.\n\nAn update has been made to the Service Desk Mail Handler, so that it will instead convert the HTML contained in an email into wiki markup.\n\nThis will work best in multipart mime messages that contain both a text and html part. Most modern clients will send multipart messages by default.\n\nThe change will be included in JSD 3.2.0-OD-02 but will not function immediately, as it also requires a change to JIRA that should be released in the next 2-3 weeks\n{panel}\n\n\nh3. Summary\nWhen an e-mail request is sent in to the JIRA Service Desk project's mail handler, the mail handler parses the content of the e-mail. Any URL, Phone Number, or E-mail address within the body of the e-mail gets appended with a number in the front, and then referenced at the bottom of the ticket description. \n\nh3. Environment\n* JIRA Service Desk v3.1.0-OD-10\n\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\n# Enable Email Requests on a JIRA Service Desk project\n# Send in an e-mail to the JSD mail handler that contains an E-mail address, URL, and Phone number in the body\n# Observe the change in format when the mail handler creates the ticket\n\nh3. Expected Results\nIssue Description should be formatted in the same format as when it was sent in.\n\nh3. Actual Results\nIssue is converted to a different format, causing issues with accessing the links in some cases.\n \nh3. Notes\n- In some cases, the issue is only reproducible with one of the following: URL, E-mail address, Phone number.\n- Other formatting/styling issues such as omitted line breaks are symptoms of this bug\n\nh3.Workaround\nNo known workaround.",

Problem\nIf there is an existing user with the same email address as the one set up as the email channel, the user will be added as the Request Participant for every request created from the email.\nThis is as outlined in [Adding request participants|https://confluence.atlassian.com/servicedeskserver033/adding-request-participants-861255383.html].\n{quote}\nIf you create or respond to a request via email, add a request participant's email address in the TO or CC fields. The participant receives an email notifying them that they have been added.\n{quote}\n\nh3. Suggestion\nDo not add the user who has the same email address as the one set up as the email channel as a Request Participant automatically\n\nh3. Workaround\nDisable the user in JIRA if the user account is not in use except for the email channel\n\n{panel:title=Original description|borderStyle=solid|borderColor=#6A8EB3}\nThis is similar to [JSD-2298|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSD-2298] but the scenario is creating a comment by replying to a notification email.\n\nScenario:\n1. Reporter creates an issue via email. There is a customer user with the same email address as the one used by JSD to fetch emails.\n2. Reporter receives a notification email from JSD.\n3. Reporter replies to the notification email. This reply creates a comment.\n4. The customer user with the same email address as the one used to fetch emails is added as a Request Participant.\n\nExpected result: at step 4, do not add this user as a request participant. It is unnecessary. This user is no longer added as a request participant when the issue is first created via email, as per the issue noted above. I think the same handling should be applied when responding to email notifications.\n\nI did raise this as a support issue, and was told the functionality is working as intended but that I could raise a feature request.\n{panel}",
