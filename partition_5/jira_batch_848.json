Your input in the comments helps us understand how this affects you and what you're hoping to accomplish with JIRA.\r\n\r\nAt this time, this suggestion is not on the JIRA development roadmap. Please remember that jira.atlassian.com is one of many inputs for the JIRA roadmap. You can [learn more about our process here|https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/110373/how-does-the-jira-team-use-jira-atlassian-com].\r\n\r\nI understand that our decision may be disappointing. Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nDave Meyer\r\n[dmeyer@atlassian.com|mailto:dmeyer@atlassian.com]\r\nProduct Manager, JIRA Platform\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\nThe suggestions for labels should be scoped by labels used in a given project.  Or perhaps limited to a project or group specific list.\r\n\r\nWhen multiple teams are using JIRA, they have different conventions for labels for their issues.  By using a single namespace for the suggestions, the teams are presented with potentially ambiguous or misleading suggestions.",

      "description": "It seems that version information is tied only to the Project.  Various components within a project can have a vast number of components, each of which could be versioned separately.  Is there any way to have the version list apply to a given component selection context.\r\n\r\nI understand the tool was written with a specific idea for the definition of a Project, and subsequently a definition for a Component.  I also understand that the tool was written with Software Development in mind.  The latter is a narrow view of the power of the tool you have created.  But using the tool for broader notions of Projects, presumeably with a potential difference in the definition of Project and Component, is hindered by the way certain things are managed.\r\n\r\nAs an example.  We have a project, call it SAS.  The SAS system comprises five primary subsystems, each with many components within them.  These subsystems or components are either a hardware or software component.  Each is also progressing from a version perspective independently.  It would be burdensome from the Project level, to define a project for each component so it can have its own version stream.  Not to mention if I have 100 such Projects going on, each with many subsystems and components, the project list would get crazy.  An individual working on one project would have to sift through a ton of projects to find the thing they wanted to report an issue against.  Much less of a burden if they can just refer to the component within the project they are familiar with.",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-23590].\n  {panel}\n\nThere is currently no way to prepopulate some of the fields in the \"Create Issue\" page, so the user gets the standard form to fill in his issue details but some of the fields are pre-populated. Ideally that would be possible by passing the fields as UTF-8 encoded URL params to the create issue URL like that:\r\n\r\nhttp://jira.atlassian.com/secure/CreateIssue.jspa?pid=10240&issuetype=2&Create=Create&summary=A+wonderful+title&description=something+more\r\n\r\nThis is currently not working. In contrast, it's easily possible to create whole issues, but for this case the user cannot change or add information. For our specific case, the use-case is:\r\n\r\nWe are using JIRA not only for support but also as submission tool for data publications, supplementary to conventional academic articles (see www.pangaea.de). The user can create an issue and fill in the authors, title, abstract, license of the academic article and submit the supplementary data to us using JIRA. The JIRA issue is used to track the changes and workflows of the data submission. Often this information can be partly prepopulated on issue creation from e.g. an article citation, library catalogues,... This is especially relevant for invoking CreateIssue.jspa from a library catalogue and just wants to add data to the article at our place. In this case, lots of information on the Create Issue page can be pre-populated, but the user should be able to modify and complete the information.\r\n\r\nWe have seen the confluence page about creating an issue with all fields filled out, but in that case we want to probvide the user the standard create issue form (where he can edit/enter the details) before creating the issue. Just a few fields should be prepopulated.\r\n\r\nThis should be easily possible by modifying the JSP page to simply pre-populate the value=\"\" of the <input> fields based on the URL parameters.",

'10h'\r\n- Since the time tracking does not make sense anymore, we need to re-set the remaining estimate... however, if a user instead re-sets the Original estimate, the whole time tracking does not make sense anymore.\r\n\r\nI've noted that the Original Estimate could not be editable in JIRA 4.1.2: there, you could edit the remaining estimate instead, which makes sense.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you guys need any more info.\r\n\r\nBest Regards\r\nThiago Prisco\r\nAtlassian Support",
