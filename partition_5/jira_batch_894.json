However I really think this should be fixed within JIRA, perhaps by a change of the persistance type, as URLs can get long.\r\n\r\nAnother possible workaround would be to edit {{edit-basictext.vm}} to include a {{maxLength}}-attribute.

The problem is that this means that any member of jira-developers can add \"jira-users\" as a group recipient of a filter subscription. If the filter results has 100 issues at approx 1KB text per issue and jira-users has 10K members, then JIRA is trying to send 1GB of email! Not surprisingly this causes JIRA to go to 100% cpu and become rather unresponsive for a *long* time. Long enough for my corporate customers' alarm systems to send them wake-up calls...\r\n\r\nSolutions to this accidental denial of service that I can see:\r\n\r\n1. Education - don't do that! Or warn about the expected effects.\r\n2. Set a limit on the number of members of a group that will be emailed, and make that limit adjustable\r\n3. Rate limit the email so that JIRA only tries to send the emails at a sustainable rate. Of course, the job may not finish before it is due again.\r\n\r\n~Matt",

When we do need to change the workflow (i.e., add or modify steps or transistion), we are forced to make the same changes to each workflow for each issue type.\r\n\r\nThis could be avoided if Atlassian introduced the concept of an \"Issue Type Resolution Scheme\".  This would be a scheme where each issue type could be mapped to a set of resolutions.

      "description": "The Issue Navigator used to have code that obtained the SearchContext for new searches using the \"pid\" and \"type\" URL parameters. With the introduction of the JQL, the SearchConext needs to come from \"pid\", \"type\" and the JQL. \r\n\r\nThe main problem here is that to generate the SearchContext we need the complete Query, but to correctly generate the Query we need the SearchContext. This is why the old JIRA code used to get a stupid SearchContext off the URL parameters.\r\n\r\nWe can solve this in at lest the following ways:\r\n\r\n# Use the jqlQuery, pid and type parameters to generate a stupid SearchContext before we construct the query. If we hit a Query that is too complex, then we can just jump straight over to \"Advanced Navigator\". \r\n# Create a Clause without validation initially, then validate after you get the whole query. This will probably require changes to Issue Navigator but may be cleaner but will also require us to ensure that the {{SearchInputTransformer.getSearchClause}} and {{SearchInputTransformer.populateFromQuery}} round trip correctly with invalid parameters and input. In particular, I know that the {{getSearchClause}} method do not currently work with invalid parameters, they just drop them.\r\n\r\nIn any case, we need to think about how doesItFit ^TM^ works with this again. If validation fails, should we do a doesItFit calculation and move off onto advanced or should we stay in the simple navigator and display the validation errors. I guess this really depends on whether or no the doesItFit works with invalid queries (I'm pretty sure that it does not).\r\n\r\n",

      "description": "The SearchRequestFactory (rewritten in 4.0) is used in 3 places: IssueNavigator, Jelly and SearchRequestURLHandler.\r\n\r\nIssueNavigator handles its own validation of parameters, so it is free to call the create method on the factory knowing that it will not perform any validation. The URLHandler however does not perform any validation on parameters (it does validate JQL). But, instead of throwing an exception when trying to create a SearchRequest with invalid parameters, it silently drops them (in some cases - I have not checked all searchers).\r\n\r\nFor example, access an XML view with a temporary search request, e.g. {{/sr/jira.issueviews:searchrequest-xml/temp/SearchRequest.xml?created%3Abefore=QWERTY}}. The {{created:before}} parameter contains an invalid value, but the DateSearchInputTransformer#getSearchClause() method treats this the same as if the parameter was not specified. Thus, the XML view will actually return all issues (since no other parameters or JQL were specified).\r\n\r\nThis is not ideal - we should be returning a 400 code response to the client telling them that their input was invalid. The suggested way to do this (there might be others) is to create another method on the SearchRequestFactory interface that returns a Result object, which can contain the error messages produced when trying to create the search request from the invalid parameters. This would then be called instead of the old create method, and the URLHandler could properly report back the errors to the client.",
