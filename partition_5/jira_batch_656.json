Recomended spacing would be equal to half the height of a status label. This would then work with the existing snapping to the top, bottom, and center of other status labels.\r\n\r\nIssue:\r\nCurrently, the centers or sides of statuses will snap to the center or sides other existing statuses (and display the relevant guide) for the sake of lining them up in straight lines. However there's nothing to help with spacing. This, together with the fact that you can't move the transition lines or labels (JRA-35712) adds a lot of time to the Workflow design process in order to make a complex workflow neat and clear.\r\n\r\nTo Reproduce the issue:\r\nTo reproduce the issue and demonstrate the need for a grid, grab any status label in the workflow designer and move it in any direction AWAY from other status labels. There are no guides to help ensure that spacing is clear or equidistant from other status labels, only guides that show whether a status label is in line with other status labels.",

I see that the macro uses key value pairs. If I create 2 columns containing a date field and title using the page properties macro,  could these values be used to create an event within a Team Calendar? I'd like to avoid manually creating an event if possible. Is this currently possible? \r\n\r\nPage Properties Macro\r\nhttps://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/page-properties-macro-184550024.html\r\n\r\nTeam Calendar\r\nhttps://confluence.atlassian.com/teamcal/create-add-and-edit-calendars-654213559.html\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n",

The field itself needs to be \"statable\" that is to say fields the fields must be \"fixed length lists\" for system fields.

Summary\r\nJIRA relies on Microsoft SQL Server to have the configuration 'READ_COMMITTED_SNAPSHOT'. This trips up many customers as it's not an out-of-the-box configuration for a SQL Server. This is currently documented in the [Connecting to SQL Server Config Guides|https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiraserver071/connecting-jira-applications-to-sql-server-2014-808761244.html]\r\n\r\nWithout this value, there are parts of JIRA that deadlock, which results in a poor experience for our customers. With the deadlock, the JIRA instance hangs/crashes, typically with a high number of active database connections.  \r\n\r\nh3. Environment\r\nJIRA + Microsoft SQL Server\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nVarious bugs and Documentation request on this such as: \r\n- [JRA-60928|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRA-60928]\r\n- [JRA-27019|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRA-27019] \r\n- [JRA-23622|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRA-23622]\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd KB: [Deadlocks During Operation with MS-SQL|https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirakb/deadlocks-during-operation-with-ms-sql-264045011.html]\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n- JIRA Should warn the customer of this requirement at some point in the event it is not correctly configured and is a requirement. Making this misconfiguration more obvious will prevent customers from running into a common scenario.\r\n- JIRA could avoid using database transactions in such a way which lead to the requirement to have shared locks on database objects. \r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nCustomers that use Microsoft SQL Server are currently required to enable this configuration due to behaviours in JIRA that result in 'competitive' queries in the database. \r\n\r\nThe recommendation to include this in our documentation came from: [JRA-33439|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRA-33439]\r\n\r\nGiven that other databases have some form of transaction isolation on by default, it's perhaps likely that we want to stick with the current requirement to enable it. For example, Oracle's transaction isolation is read committed data only. \r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\nFollow the documentation to set this value as part of setting up the JIRA Database. ",

Summary\r\nIf you update the issue type scheme while removing an issue type you can get into a state where there is an option in the optionset that doesn't exist. This database corruption was the cause of JRA-45161. Fixing this would be removing another way to get into this state. \r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Get an instance with an Issue Type Scheme with a set of Issue Types\r\n# Current Option Set: [1, 2, 3], In the UI I change it to [1, 4, 2, 3]. Where these numbers represent Issue Types.\r\n# During this processing, delete one of the Issue Types\r\n# Check the database table optionconfiguration and there could be a possible row with an optionid that no longer exists.\r\n# Until JRA-45161 is fixed this results in NPE in the UI. \r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nCan create Issues like usual and the database table optionconfiguration should only have valid options.\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nCannot create Issues or view workflows because of NPE and the database table optionconfiguration contains invalid options. \r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\nThis can be fixed by following the workaround in [NullPointerException when creating issue, editing issue, move issue, accessing the Screen tab from the Project|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRAKB/NullPointerException+when+creating+issue,+editing+issue,+move+issue,+accessing+the+Screen+tab+from+the+Project].\r\n",

Problem Definition\r\nUnder some situations, decoding the message subject fails due to an encoding problem with the Mail Client. Given that there are many Mail clients that don't strictly confirm to encoding standards, it would be useful to try and mitigate some use-cases. \r\n\r\nA specific example has been detailed below: \r\n{panel:title=Sample Java Application|borderStyle=solid|borderColor=#3C78B5| titleBGColor=#3C78B5| bgColor=#E7F4FA}\r\n{code:java}\r\npackage com.mimeTest;\r\n\r\nimport javax.mail.MessagingException;\r\nimport javax.mail.internet.MimeUtility;\r\nimport javax.mail.internet.ParseException;\r\n\r\nimport java.io.UnsupportedEncodingException;\r\n\r\npublic class Main {\r\n\r\n    public static void main(String[] args)\r\n    {\r\n\r\n        System.setProperty(\"mail.mime.decodetext.strict\", \"false\");\r\n        try\r\n        {\r\n            // Use method similar to JavaMail API (Fails)\r\n            System.out.println(\"--- Decoding Using method similar to JavaMail API ---\");\r\n            System.out.println(getSubject(\"=?ISO-8859-1?Q?ITSM - REASSIGNMENT: Incident mit Priorit=E4t 3 f=FCr ?=\"));\r\n\r\n            // We can test Encoding the text\r\n            System.out.println(\"\\n\\n--- Encoding using JavaMail API ---\");\r\n            System.out.println(MimeUtility.encodeText(\"ITSM - REASSIGNMENT: Incident IM1239906 mit Priorit\u00e4t 3 f\u00fcr\", \"ISO-8859-1\",\"Q\"));\r\n            // Output is: \"=?ISO-8859-1?Q?ITSM_-_REASSIGNMENT:_Incident?= =?ISO-8859-1?Q?_IM1239906_mit_Priorit=E4t_3_f=FCr?=\"\r\n\r\n            // if we try to decode the above string it passes:\r\n            System.out.println(\"\\n\\n--- Decoding Using Encoded version of string with similar to JavaMail API method---\");\r\n            System.out.println(getSubject(\"=?ISO-8859-1?Q?ITSM_-_REASSIGNMENT:_Incident?= =?ISO-8859-1?Q?_IM1239906_mit_Priorit=E4t_3_f=FCr?=\"));\r\n\r\n            // A coded workaround would be to use an alternative method to treat the text as a single word\r\n            System.out.println(\"\\n\\n --- Decoding Using alternative method ---\");\r\n            System.setProperty(\"mail.mime.decodetext.strict\", \"false\");\r\n            System.out.println(MimeUtility.decodeWord(\"=?ISO-8859-1?Q?ITSM - REASSIGNMENT: Incident mit Priorit=E4t 3 f=FCr ?=\"));\r\n\r\n            }\r\n            catch (Exception e)\r\n            {\r\n                throw new RuntimeException(e);\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n\r\n    public static String getSubject(String s) throws MessagingException\r\n    {\r\n        String rawvalue = s;\r\n        if(rawvalue == null) {\r\n            return null;\r\n        } else {\r\n            try {\r\n                return MimeUtility.decodeText(MimeUtility.unfold(rawvalue));\r\n            } catch (UnsupportedEncodingException var3) {\r\n                return rawvalue;\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n{code}\r\n\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\nIn the above Java application, we work through a few scenarios: \r\n# *Decoding* Using a method similar to the JavaMail API (https://java.net/projects/javamail/pages/Home) which we use in JIRA. \r\n# *Encoding* Using JavaMail's MIME utility. \r\n# *Decoding* the String as encoded by the JavaMail API. \r\n# *Decoding* using a different method in the API. \r\n\r\n{panel:title=Output of sample app|borderStyle=solid|borderColor=#3C78B5| titleBGColor=#3C78B5| bgColor=#E7F4FA}\r\n{noformat}\r\n--- Decoding Using method similar to JavaMail API ---\r\n=?ISO-8859-1?Q?ITSM - REASSIGNMENT: Incident mit Priorit=E4t 3 f=FCr ?=\r\n\r\n\r\n--- Encoding using JavaMail API ---\r\n=?ISO-8859-1?Q?ITSM_-_REASSIGNMENT:_Incident?= =?ISO-8859-1?Q?_IM1239906_mit_Priorit=E4t_3_f=FCr?=\r\n\r\n\r\n--- Decoding Using Encoded version of string with similar to JavaMail API method---\r\nITSM - REASSIGNMENT: Incident IM1239906 mit Priorit\u00e4t 3 f\u00fcr\r\n\r\n\r\n --- Decoding Using alternative method ---\r\nITSM - REASSIGNMENT: Incident mit Priorit\u00e4t 3 f\u00fcr \r\n{noformat}\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\nIf the Subject of an Incoming mail message includes encoding syntax, attempt to decode the subject as a 'word' instead of decoding 'text' using the JavaMail API. \r\n\r\nh3.

Summary\r\nAttempting to view a report configured for a project that does not exist causes the server to 500. The expected behaviour is to redirect back to the configure report form with an error message (as is the case if you try to view a restricted project as an anonymous user). This shouldn't occur when users navigate to a report through the configure screen, but may occur when users navigate to reports through bookmarks or shared links that go directly to the result.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Configure an Average Age report for an existing project and navigate to the formatted report (substitute Average Age report for any report that has a project picker).\r\n# Manually change the \"projectOrFilterId\" URL parameter to a project id that does not exist on the instance (e.g projectOrFilterId=project-99999).\r\n !change-project-id-to-invalid.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nThe user is redirected back to the configure report form with a \"project does not exist\" error message.\r\n !expected-outcome.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nA 500 error.\r\n !500-when-no-project-found.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\nThe below exception is thrown in the atlassian-jira.log file:\r\n{noformat}\r\ncom.atlassian.jira.util.dbc.Assertions$NullArgumentException: searchRequest should not be null!\r\n\tat com.atlassian.jira.util.dbc.Assertions.notNull(Assertions.java:25)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.jira.charts.AverageAgeChart.generateChartInternal(AverageAgeChart.java:69)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.jira.charts.AverageAgeChart.generateInlineChart(AverageAgeChart.java:65)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.jira.charts.DefaultChartFactory.generateAverageAgeChart(DefaultChartFactory.java:101)\r\n\tat sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke0(Native Method)\r\n\t... 2 filtered\r\n\tat java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Method.java:498)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.plugin.util.ContextClassLoaderSettingInvocationHandler.invoke(ContextClassLoaderSettingInvocationHandler.java:26)\r\n\tat com.sun.proxy.$Proxy165.generateAverageAgeChart(Unknown Source)\r\n\t... 3 filtered\r\n\tat java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Method.java:498)\r\n\tat org.springframework.aop.support.AopUtils.invokeJoinpointUsingReflection(AopUtils.java:317)\r\n\tat org.eclipse.gemini.blueprint.service.importer.support.internal.aop.ServiceInvoker.doInvoke(ServiceInvoker.java:56)\r\n\tat org.eclipse.gemini.blueprint.service.importer.support.internal.aop.ServiceInvoker.invoke(ServiceInvoker.java:60)\r\n\tat org.springframework.aop.framework.ReflectiveMethodInvocation.proceed(ReflectiveMethodInvocation.java:179)\r\n\tat org.springframework.aop.support.DelegatingIntroductionInterceptor.doProceed(DelegatingIntroductionInterceptor.java:133)\r\n\tat org.springframework.aop.support.DelegatingIntroductionInterceptor.invoke(DelegatingIntroductionInterceptor.java:121)\r\n\tat org.springframework.aop.framework.ReflectiveMethodInvocation.proceed(ReflectiveMethodInvocation.java:179)\r\n\tat org.eclipse.gemini.blueprint.service.util.internal.aop.ServiceTCCLInterceptor.invokeUnprivileged(ServiceTCCLInterceptor.java:70)\r\n\tat org.eclipse.gemini.blueprint.service.util.internal.aop.ServiceTCCLInterceptor.invoke(ServiceTCCLInterceptor.java:53)\r\n\tat org.springframework.aop.framework.ReflectiveMethodInvocation.proceed(ReflectiveMethodInvocation.java:179)\r\n\tat org.eclipse.gemini.blueprint.service.importer.support.LocalBundleContextAdvice.invoke(LocalBundleContextAdvice.java:57)\r\n\tat org.springframework.aop.framework.ReflectiveMethodInvocation.proceed(ReflectiveMethodInvocation.java:179)\r\n\tat org.springframework.aop.support.DelegatingIntroductionInterceptor.doProceed(DelegatingIntroductionInterceptor.java:133)\r\n\tat org.springframework.aop.support.DelegatingIntroductionInterceptor.invoke(DelegatingIntroductionInterceptor.java:121)\r\n\tat org.springframework.aop.framework.ReflectiveMethodInvocation.proceed(ReflectiveMethodInvocation.java:179)\r\n\tat org.springframework.aop.framework.JdkDynamicAopProxy.invoke(JdkDynamicAopProxy.java:207)\r\n\tat com.sun.proxy.$Proxy1958.generateAverageAgeChart(Unknown Source)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.jira.plugin.corereports.charts.report.AverageAgeReport.generateReportHtml(AverageAgeReport.java:71)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.jira.plugin.corereports.web.action.ConfigureReport.doExecute(ConfigureReport.java:167)\r\n\t... 1 filtered\r\n\tat com.atlassian.jira.action.JiraActionSupport.execute(JiraActionSupport.java:63)\r\n\t... 7 filtered\r\n\tat javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet.service(HttpServlet.java:729)\r\n\t... 49 filtered\r\n\tat com.atlassian.greenhopper.jira.filters.ClassicBoardRouter.doFilter(ClassicBoardRouter.java:62)\r\n\t... 7 filtered\r\n\tat com.atlassian.jira.plugin.corereports.filters.ReportKeyRewriter.doFilter(ReportKeyRewriter.java:48)\r\n\t... 4 filtered\r\n\tat com.atlassian.web.servlet.plugin.request.RedirectInterceptingFilter.doFilter(RedirectInterceptingFilter.java:21)\r\n\t... 58 filtered\r\n\tat com.atlassian.jira.security.JiraSecurityFilter.lambda$doFilter$0(JiraSecurityFilter.java:76)\r\n\t... 1 filtered\r\n\tat com.atlassian.jira.security.JiraSecurityFilter.doFilter(JiraSecurityFilter.java:74)\r\n\t... 36 filtered\r\n\tat com.atlassian.jira.servermetrics.CorrelationIdPopulatorFilter.doFilter(CorrelationIdPopulatorFilter.java:30)\r\n\t... 20 filtered\r\n\tat com.atlassian.web.servlet.plugin.request.RedirectInterceptingFilter.doFilter(RedirectInterceptingFilter.java:21)\r\n\t... 4 filtered\r\n\tat com.atlassian.web.servlet.plugin.LocationCleanerFilter.doFilter(LocationCleanerFilter.java:36)\r\n\t... 29 filtered\r\n\tat com.atlassian.jira.servermetrics.MetricsCollectorFilter.doFilter(MetricsCollectorFilter.java:25)\r\n\t... 27 filtered\r\n\tat java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.runWorker(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:1142)\r\n\tat java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor$Worker.run(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:617)\r\n\tat org.apache.tomcat.util.threads.TaskThread$WrappingRunnable.run(TaskThread.java:61)\r\n\tat java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:745)\r\n{noformat}",

Notes\r\nSee related https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRA-61577\r\n\r\nh3.Workaround\r\nGo to *Administration* > *System* > *Indexing* and check if you see error like:\r\nbq.
