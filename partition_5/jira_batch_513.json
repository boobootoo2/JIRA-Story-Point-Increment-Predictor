Notes\r\nIt seems the root cause of this is the handling of the *mimtype* value in the the *fileattachments* table. Currently due to the copy image in the reply not having a name attributed the mime type is stored in Jira as:\r\n{noformat}image/png; name=noname{noformat}\r\nIt seems the lack of file extension in the name parameter is causing Jira to not treat this as an image therefore it is not being flagged as thumbnailable.\r\nI have confirmed this by manually changing the value here to contain a file extension and flagging the record as thumbnailable which resolves the problem but is not a practical solution or workaround.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\nCurrently there is no known workaround for this behavior. A workaround will be added here when available",

Summary\r\n\r\nWhen modifying CSS for Customer Notification Template, \"border\" and \"background\" properties and not working as expected.\r\n If you have a property \"background\":\r\n{code:java}\r\n{ background: black; height: 50px; overflow: hidden; }\r\n{code}\r\nand you would like to add another property - \"border\":\r\n{code:java}\r\n{ border: 1em solid black; }\r\n{code}\r\nColour that is mentioned in \"background\" parameter doesn't work for \"border\". Any other colour works just fine.\r\n So there is a dependency on \"background\" colour parameter.\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Try to edit notification template for a Service Desk project:\r\n Project Settings -> Customer notifications -> \"Edit templates\"\r\n\r\n2. Add the following to CSS section:\r\n{code:java}\r\n.inner-box \r\n{ background: black; height: 50px; overflow: hidden; }\r\n.outer-box\r\n{ border: 1em solid black; }\r\n\r\n{code}\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nIt is expected that a border of the div with class \"outer-box\" will be now black colour.\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n # Email notifications are broken and Service Desk doesn't send any more notifications.\r\n # The preview window in Template section doesn't update throwing browser console errors and test emails will not be sent.\r\n # Parameter \"\\{ border: 1em solid black; }\" is ignored.\r\n If you change \"black\" to any other colour, e.g. \"red\" - CSS works as expected. There will be a red border around notification.\r\n\r\nh3. Notes\r\n\r\nThe above combination of \"border\" and \"background\" works just fine in a webpage. Colour is not ignored.\r\n\r\nThe problem seems to be with including a color shorthand (eg: black, red) in the \"border\" field when that exact same color shorthand is used elsewhere in the css.\r\nh3. Workarounds\r\n # Using \"border-color\" everywhere possible instead of including the color shorthand with \"border\" prevents the issue from occurring\r\n # Using a hex code for the colour you require prevents the bug from occurring. (eg: instead of \"black\" try \"#000000\")\r\n\r\nEither should work alone (you don't need to do both).",
