If I explain that an error occurs when a user types in {noformat}\"_xxx_\"{noformat}, I want to see the actual underscores in the issue description, not an italicized version of what's in between them: \"_xxx_\". HTML tags work because \n1) the tags/codes are not likely to be used in the normal course of typing\n2) they are ways to escape them if necessary, but only a programmer would ever need to know how to to that\nIn what is being presented here within -JIRA-, a casual user would not likely try to figure out how to get around the automatic formatting. It may be unlikely for an issue description to have phrases like noformat, but underscores, dashes, plus signs, and even curly braces are extremely common and are not suitable as tag markers in my opinion. I can easily think of when one might have an issue that gives code snippets like\n{ start }\n     code\n{end}\nand these should not present errors.\n(n)(n)(n)(n)(n)(n)(n)(n)",

So, the current assignee will get an email about an issue with a description etc. that is about to be changed. What should happen is that when you click on Clone issue, and after you edit the summary, instead of just completing the operation with the Create button, there should be another button that takes you into the standard create issue screen, where you can edit the assignee, description etc. Being able to only change the summary is very restricting. If we added a middle button called \"Edit\" or something similar, then a user could clone an issue and have all the fields identical to the original but it won't fire off the notification until the description and assignee etc. have been correctly set. Currently, the workaround I have is to assign the original issue to me before I clone it. I hope I've explained myself well enough.",

I would vote that they are made standard links which every installation has (and are undeletable).\n\nIf that was the case, you would be able to more easily build standard functionality on them. Some of this functionality might include:\n- Gantt charts, displaying dependencies between issues.\n- Dependency change notification (I'll elaborate on that).\n\nI think this is a natural progression in the direction the application is already moving in. It feels like 90% of the work for this kind of stuff is done and the application could soon start creating some of those really awesome bonus features (like Gantt charts).\n\nDependency change notification: If an issue is marked as \"depending\" on another, you could set up a default \"watch\" action. If the issue which was the prerequisite had a status change, JIRA could then send an email to the person assigned to that issue.",

You are more than welcome to create \na new feature request on http://jira.atalssian.com. Please note however \nthat it might take us some time to get to this feature as we have *a \nlot* of  feature requests. The way we implement new features and \nimprovements is described here:\nhttp://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DEV/Implementation+of+New+Features+and+Improvements\n\n > How does Confluence do this btw for its macros that show the top 10\n > issues?

For example:\nhttp://jira.atlassian.com/secure/RunPortlet.jspa?portletKey=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.portlets:filterstats&filterid=12265&statistictype=assignees&\n\nThe URL for each portlet can be obtained by turning \"Configure\" on, on \nthe dashboard and looking at link of portlet's name.\n\nAlternatively Confluence fetches the RSS view of a filter from JIRA and \nthen displays it:\nhttp://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/docs/latest/navigatorviews.html\n\nThanks,\nAnton\n\n\nScott Bilas wrote:\n> I admit the \"count\" feature is something that is too specific to be\n> useful to a lot of people.

We highly value your feedback in all forms, and through suggestions in jira.atlassian.com is not different. We use this channel often to learn the best we can with how customers use JIRA and how we can continue to improve the experience for as many users as possible.\r\n\r\nAt this time, this suggestion is not on the JIRA development roadmap. There a couple add-ons on the Atlassian Marketplace that can support this, such as [Configuration Manager for JIRA|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.botronsoft.jira.configurationmanager]. Alternatively, this is very easy to do with a simple GET of the component you want to copy and a POST of the components JSON representation to the JIRA REST API, simply change the project key and id in the rep.\r\n\r\nPlease remember that jira.atlassian.com is one of many inputs for the JIRA roadmap. You can [learn more about our process here|https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/110373/how-does-the-jira-team-use-jira-atlassian-com].\r\n\r\nI understand that our decision may be disappointing. Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.\r\n\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nKerrod Williams\r\nKerrod (dot) Williams (at) atlassian (dot) com\r\nProduct Manager, JIRA\r\n\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\nThis issue is related to JRE-501 (Shared Components) and JRE-6999 (Add ability to export/import projects):\r\n\r\nWe need a way to copy components from one project to another. This is because the projects have _nearly_ the same components.\r\n\r\nThere are several ways how this issue might be solved from my point of view:\r\n\r\n1. There might be an ex- and import of project-components.\r\n2. There might be a button in the Projects-Administration to copy a project.\r\n3. Upon creation of a new project you are asked if to take components from an existing project (and perhaps other settings, too)\r\n\r\nNow the reason why we require this:\r\n\r\nIn contrast to perhaps the normal application-development we had to create projects for each release-version of the same application. This is because after a version is released it will go into maintenance-mode thus the version is never really finished. See for example a release history like this:\r\n\r\nJanuary V 1.0 build 1 Final-Release (Components: A, B, C)\r\nFebruary V 1.1 build 1 Final-Release (Components: A, C)\r\nMarch V 1.0 build 2 Bugfix-Release\r\nApril V2.0 build 1 Final-Release  (Components: A, C, D)\r\nMay V1.1 build 2 Bugfix-Release\r\n\r\nand so on. Therefore virtually we have a new project/product with every Final-Release. It's rather hard to mirror this pre-existing handling of versions inside JIRA as the \"normal\" version-concept included into JIRA does not fit. So the application-versions are now projects while the JIRA-version-field is related to the build-numbers.\r\n\r\nTo use our workaround we now have to copy all components from one project to another. Resolving this issue would ease to handle this workaround.",
