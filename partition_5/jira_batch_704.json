When adding an user, jira will instruct remote ldap server to create it, then jira will check if \"jira-users\" group exists *in the cache* and will try to add newly created user to the non-existent group on the remote ldap server. As group does not really exist an exception will be thrown. Normally if group does not exist jira creates it first.\r\n\r\nOperations that modifies ldap should not rely on cached data at all and always use up to date information from the remote ldap server.",

      "description": "{panel:bgColor=#e7f4fa}\n  *NOTE:* This bug report is for *JIRA Server*. Using *JIRA Cloud*? [See the corresponding bug report|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-42063].\n  {panel}\n\nHi,\r\n\r\nI am Atlassian Verified vendor and developer of a couple of JIRA add-ons.\r\nI am facing a strange error which bothers me and some of my customers more than a year. A customer raised a [support ticket|https://ecosystem.atlassian.net/browse/REL-6], and finally they told me to raise an issue here indicating the reproducing steps.\r\n\r\nCustomers are getting below exception when two plugins installed at the same time.\r\n{code}\r\nCaused by: org.springframework.beans.factory.NoSuchBeanDefinitionException: No unique bean of type [com.atlassian.jira.config.StatusManager] is defined: Unsatisfied dependency of type [interface com.atlassian.jira.config.StatusManager]: expected at least 1 matching bean\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nHere are the steps to reproduce problem :\r\n- Install JIRA\r\n- Install plugin  [Issue Alternative Assignee|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.iamhuy.jira.plugin.issue-alternative-assignee]\r\n- Install plugin [Time to SLA|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/plugin.tts]\r\n- Reboot JIRA\r\n- Create custom field \"Overdue Status\" which comes with Time to SLA\r\n- Go to configuration page of custom field (click actions icon, then select Configure in custom fields listing)\r\n- Click \"Edit Including SLAs\" link, Ooops 404, and the stack trace is attached at the bottom of this issue.\r\n\r\nFinally I found the root cause of the issue. Both plugins has class named {{EditConfiguration}} and they are both extending {{AbstractEditConfigurationItemAction}}\r\n\r\n{code}\r\nclass EditConfiguration extends AbstractEditConfigurationItemAction {\r\n ...\r\n}\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nWhen I change the class name to be any value except {{EditConfiguration}} it works.\r\n\r\nAs a work around I'm gonna change all class names, but I think it will be great to fix this problem in JIRA API because all tutorials are telling to use {{EditConfiguration}} class name :)\r\n\r\nHere is the whole stack trace:\r\n{code}\r\n[INFO] [talledLocalContainer] org.springframework.beans.factory.UnsatisfiedDependencyException: Error creating bean with name 'com.blahblah.EditConfiguration': Unsatisfied

And the reader will just receive the communication in good mood.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think guys?\r\nPS: Both Heads and Feet should be written in accordance to user language.",
