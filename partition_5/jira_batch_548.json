Problem Definition\nSome request types might require being handled in an external system but the Customer Portal can't be setup to provide a link to another system in lieu of raising the request in JIRA. \n\nh3. Suggested Solution\nAllow for a *Request Type* to be defined that displays information or a link to an external system, but can't be used to create requests in JIRA. \n\nh3. Why this is important\nFor example, one Help Desk in an organization us using JIRA Service Desk, but another group in the organization may intake requests using another tool.  \n\nh3. Workaround \nRegardless of which Workaround you ultimately try to use, there are two places built in that you can provide a link to your Customers using standard JIRA markup.  These are:\n# The Request Type *Description*\n# In the *Help and instructions* section for the Request Type, edited by clicking on the \"Edit Fields\" link once the Request Type has been created.\n\nh4. Workflow Restriction\nTo prevent Requests from being created in the first place, you can create a Request Type using an Issue Type associated with a simplified Workflow with a Validator strict enough to prevent the Request from being created.  \n\nFor example: A *Permission Validator* requiring *Administer Projects* will result in \"Only users with *Administer Projects* permission can execute this transition.\"\n\nIn the Customer Portal, if a normal Customer clicks on *Create* for the associated *Request Type*, they'll receive: {quote}*Error*\n\nUser '<username>' doesn't have the 'Administer Projects' permission{quote}\nh4. Automation Rule\nThis approach doesn't prevent the creation of Requests but instead provides a way to automatically handle them while referring Customers to the correct channels.  \nIn short, create Automation Rule roughly matching:\n- *WHEN*: Issue Created\n- *IF*: Issue matches a specific *Customer Request Type*\n- *THEN*: \n-- Add a comment: {code}Please use [some other system|http://external-link.example.com] to raise this issue{code}\n-- Transition issue: Close Ticket\n\n-----\nh6. Original Description\n{quote}We have a need for some request types that rely on external systems to be created within the external system.  In order to accommodate those, I can currently create a custom field that displays the required information directing the user elsewhere, but in that case, the 'Create' button still exists.\n\nI would like to be able to create request types that display a message, but do not allow for issue submission.\n\nDisplaying a given knowledge base article for an issue type would also be a possibility.{quote}",

Diagnostic\n\nOn the logs with incoming mail debug enabled, it seems to stuck on a particular mail.\n\n{noformat}\n2015-03-20 11:25:09,133 atlassian-scheduler-quartz1.clustered_Worker-2 DEBUG ServiceRunner     [mail.incoming.jepp.processor] Starts processing mail item [id: 3063] ...\n2015-03-20 11:25:09,133 atlassian-scheduler-quartz1.clustered_Worker-2 DEBUG ServiceRunner     [mail.incoming.jepp.processor] Checking if mail item [id: 3063] is a mail loop ...\n2015-03-20 11:25:09,138 atlassian-scheduler-quartz1.clustered_Worker-2 DEBUG ServiceRunner     [mail.incoming.jepp.processor] Detected mail item [id: 3063] as a mail loop\n{noformat}\n(i) The example above shows {{ID: 3063}}\n\nVerify whether is the ID being returned from the query below:\n{noformat}\nselect count(*),\"MAIL_ITEM_ID\" from \"AO_2C4E5C_MAILITEMCHUNK\" where \"MAIL_ITEM_ID\" in (select \"ID\" from \"AO_2C4E5C_MAILITEM\" where \"STATUS\" = 'NEW') group by \"MAIL_ITEM_ID\" having count(*)>=2 order by count(*) desc;\n{noformat}\n\nIf yes, then it is most likely to hit into this bug.\n\nh3. Explanation\n\nEmail stores attachment as base64 embedded to the mail body. When the mail process trying to process, it only process the first row where it ends up halt due to the incomplete data to decode the base64 attachment.\n\nAt times when the email is detected to be added as comment, it will not halt the email processing but will return as error. The cause for it is the same, it somehow error out when decoding the base64.\n\nh3. Workaround\n\nIf you wish to recover the email content before deletion, follow the KB below:\n\n* https://confluence.atlassian.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=728138770\n\nThen you can proceed with deleting the affected ID that stuck, refer to the steps below:\n# Backup the database\n# Delete following the command below:\n{noformat}\ndelete from \"AO_2C4E5C_MAILITEMCHUNK\" where \"MAIL_ITEM_ID\" = <id from above>;\ndelete from \"AO_2C4E5C_MAILITEM\" where \"ID\" = <id from above>;\n{noformat}\n\nNOTE: For Cloud customer, please inform support team to perform troubleshooting and workaround for this bug.\n\nJEPP version {{1.0.28-D20150313T043758}}",

Lets face it, most big companies these days strive to base their processes around ITIL methodology, the last 3 I have been involved with have anyway (3000 employees, 73000 and 300).\n\nThis is the first time I have come across JIRA and as a Service Desk Manager find it quite limiting. While I understand this tool is fundamentally based around Agile PM, Service Desk functionality is very cumbersome and limiting.\n\nI know SD is only in its early stages, I just hope this gets addressed as automating process for standard changes and incidents etc should be standard in almost any service desk product.\n\nWhy is it important?\n\nIf I have a standardised task which does not change and follows the same path of implementation every time, I should be able to use a workflow to automate that entire process. Tasks we have should auto generate upon specific status changes or assignment or closure of other tickets.\nAssigning to multiple \"assignees\" is wasteful and creates too many overheads around future administration. ie. if one person leaves, you now have to update that workflow or any other workflow that person was a part of. If it was a group, then you have nothing to do whatsoever except update the one group.\n\nThe only solution for this is to allow the assignment of issues to groups.\n\nRight now, we have to manually create every single ticket, monitor queues etc. Wasting my technical resources time that could be better spent on improving processes for our customers.",

This workaround will schedule a consistency task between 30 seconds - 2 minutes of the workflow transition rule executing. If the reindex initially may have got the queues into an inconsistent state, this task will reload the issue from database and index again.\n\nHowever, the real fix will be available from JIRA 7.0.0 (JSD 3.0.0) where on every reindex, the issue will be reloaded before indexing, to prevent these inconsistencies occurring at all.\n{panel}\n\nI have a Service Desk workflow that is triggering transitions when the issue is commented upon (similar to the default Service Desk workflow).  It appears that at least some of the time, the issue does not re-index when it is transitioned by the automation.  When I view the issue in the queue, it shows one status, and when I view the issue on the normal view screen it has a different (correct) status.  Making any edit to the issue that forces a re-index brings both statuses inline with each other.\n\nAutomation details\n|| When || If || Then ||\n| Issue Commented | Status = \"Waiting for Support\"\nComment is public\nUser is agent | Transition \"Respond to customer\" |\n|| || Else If || Then ||\n| | Status = \"Waiting for Customer\nUser is not agent | Transition \"Respond to support\" |",

Awesome!\nBut if i wan`t my customers in Servicedesk to be able to searche knowledge base articles in confluence, i have to add them to my Confluence User Directory, so they waste my user licences in confluence.\nThis does not make sense!\nI don`t want to enable anonymous access to our confluence. So i have to upgrade my confluence license if my customers want to use my knowledge base in confluence.\n\nPlease create a possibility that Service Desk Customers are able to search confluence articles without wasting user licenses.\nThank you very much\n",

While this could be used for goals that is specific to Priority or the details about the issue, it does not support SLA goals that is based on time. There some users that is set the SLA Goals based on the time when it is created, in which the SLA will adapt when it is passed a specific hours. While currently we could specify multiple goals for the same JQL filter, JIRA Service Desk will refer to the most top goals if it were the same. Not to include when the SLA is passed the working hours, it would stop until the next day.\n\nFor example about the SLA that is based on time:\nbq. When a ticket is created at 17:50 the time starts to count towards the 2 hour goal until 18:00. Then at 18:00 the working hours stop and the goal is set to 3 hours with 10 minutes already subtracted from that and the time continues on counting towards the 3 hours goal.\n\nHence, it would be great if JIRA Service Desk to have an option to make goals moved or continue to a different calendar based on the time.",

This means all agents see this message:\n!Screen Shot 2015-03-30 at 12.06.58 PM.png!\n \nThis would just be a minor annoyance, except that Project Admins are able to click the error and \"upgrade\" the permission scheme:\n!Screen Shot 2015-03-30 at 12.08.07 PM.png!\n \nIs there a way to hide or dismiss this message?",

Please note:\r\n * Customers who create their own accounts receive an email asking them to verify their email address. If you prefer not to send this email, we recommend you set up a\u00a0[login-free portal|https://confluence.atlassian.com/servicedeskcloud/blog/2017/04/introducing-the-login-free-portal].\r\n * For now, this has only been implemented in JIRA Service Desk Cloud.

Problem Definition\r\n\r\nDue to reduce the number of communication between JIRA and users, some administrators would like to disable the Welcome messages\r\n * Welcome messages are also referred to as \"Activate Your Account\" emails\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nAdd the new customer welcome message as a notification type that can be edited within the notification scheme.\r\nh3. Example Use Case\r\n\r\n\"We are running into a problem with JIRA service desk whereby we need to allow for open customer enrollment, but we do not support a portal site and do not want to link customers to that site in their update emails. The entire Welcome email is entirely unnecessary for this reason, and while we can use the default JIRA notifications as a way to update customers, we would like to be able to just change the outgoing emails from Service Desk the same as with JIRA notifications. \"",

At a later moment I've installed the jira service desk plugin and configured the project for use with the servicedesk plugin. I've created an issuetype with servicedesk screen, etc.. When a customer creates an issue of the defined issuetype, the customer doesn't see the issue in his list of issues (the counter has not changed).\nI've created a new jira-project and made the issuetype I allready defined available in the new project. When the customer creates an issue (of the same issuetype) in the new project, the issue is added to the customers list of issues (the counter is changed by 1).\nDo you have any idea what the problem might be? Does it have something to do with the fact that my first project was created before I installed and configured the service desk module?\n\nWith kind regards,\nNiels Koreman",

When a unregistered user sent an email to Service Desk email channel, the email will be converted to a request and an invitation link will sent out to the sender to notify them. \n\nBut, at some situation, the sender of the email will forward the created request notification to another user that will be take part on that request, and there is a possibility that the user that received the forward email is an unregistered user as well. Then, that user will reply to Service Desk email channel with the same subject as the previous notification with intend to update/comment on the ticket. Since this user is not registered yet, Service Desk will process the email but did not do aything with it as the subject is the same and it is from an unregistered user email address.\n\nHence, it will be great if JIRA Service Desk Public Sign Up will cover those unregistered user that have an intend to comment on an existing ticket. Making the user does not need to access the portal and sign up just to do a simple comment, also it will automatically include the user as the participant of that request.\n\nIt could perhaps be good to add some sort of approve-mechanism, if an user wants to comment on an issue, but aren't allowed because the user user is not in request participant list. As if it is possible, it would make the customer to be added to the request which could lead to a security issues.\n",

Suggestion\nAllow more space for the comments column and decrease the font size, as well as making noformat scrollable and improving the spacing and padding in code blocks and panels. For example, by simply making these changes in the CSS:\n{code}\n.aui-page-panel-content\nsize: 100%\nfont-size: 15px\n\ndiv.preformatted:nth-child(4) (for the noformat with scroll)\noverflow-y: scroll\npadding: 5px\nmargin-top: 8px\nmargin-bottom: 8px\n\ndiv.panel:nth-child(3) (for the panel with light border)\nborder-style: solid;\npadding: 5px;\nmargin-bottom: 8px;\nmargin-top: 8px;\nborder-color: #CCCCCC;\n{code}\nIt would look at least a little bit better:\n!mockup.png|thumbnail, border!",
