The fields are added only to screens that are displayed during the transitions when the fields are supposed to be modified.\r\nEverything works great but the problem is that if you perform a Bulk change (Edit Issues), everything can be modified, even the fields that were NOT supposed to be editable.\r\n\r\nIt would make sense to take into account the EDIT screen for all Edit operations, including Bulk Edit too.\r\n",

This is really poor user-experience, especially as it's quite easy to overlook whether you are viewing a saved filter or not.\r\n\r\nSecondly, once a query has been saved the permalink button becomes completely non-functional unless I also share the filter with the intended recipients first. Once I've shared the filter, there is very little need for the permalink button in the first place because the intended recipients will be able to find the filter in their list of available filters. As you can only share on a group level, it can be quite tricky to work out which groups you need to share with to get all the right recipients included. You might have to share with a lot of unnecessary people, if your intended target group is quite small.\r\n\r\nThis has come about because of JRA-28914 with which I quite strongly disagree. In my opinion, the permalink button should be a *permanent link* to the *current* set of results that I'm looking at.

Whenever the required fields are not available among the default ones, you can add the fields you need by clicking the \"More Criteria\" option and add the field you require. If you often use the basic search, and often require fields not under the default ones, looking them every time becomes tiresome. Could some functionality be added in which you can customize the default fields? I tried to work around this by making JQLs and switch back to basic search, but in that case the extra defined fields in the JQL are not taken in the fields under the basic search, though the additional fields ARE checked when you go to the \"More Criteria\"option",

But I simply want to attach screenshot after clicking the PrintScreen button without any additional settings or comments... \r\n\r\n*CURRENT USING FREQUENCY:*\r\nAround 10-20 times per day or more...\r\n\r\n*EXPECTED:*\r\n# Capture screenshot\r\n# Open issue in View mode\r\n# Hit e.g:\"h\" button\r\n# Close page\r\nProfit!!!\r\n\r\n*THOUGHTS:*\r\nI understand that JIRA uses a Java applet to run the \"Attach Screenshot\" functionality in a separate browser window but I think it's OK if it will be filled in with the screenshot from clipboard and closed automatically.\r\nIf clipboard contain not an image it simply can do nothing.\r\nAdmin must be able to turn on/off this function.\r\nGood if this feature will be as a separate Operation, this will let user ability to attach screenshot in one click - see attached PasteClipboardExample.png file (or can be placed under \"More Actions\").\r\n\r\n!PasteClipboardExample.png!",

We have moved this ticket back and forth between MELSS and OpsEsc a couple times, each time it creates a new JIRA ticket number. I realize we can acccess it via any of the 4+ JIRA ticket numbers it has assigned for this one issue but it would eliminate much confusion if it would assume it's original JIRA ticket number in a project if it is moved back to a project where it has already been moved. Make sense? (it makes it difficult when we refer to the issue by a JIRA ticket number and the number is being incremented each time it is moved back and forth.) \r\n\r\nOrig: sets-5048",

Alas, you can't do that, but that's another issue.\r\n\r\nInstead, It appears I must take the cumbersome path of creating a new issue and transfer all of the data from one user to another. The Operations offered on the Admin User pane allow for Deleting, but when I choose that, it says I cannot, because they have issues assigned them.  After searching through the help, I discover that Atlassian \"strongly recommends deactivating the user instead of deleting it since deleting a user may cause database integrity problems.\"  Deactivating?  First I've heard of that.\r\n\r\nMy question: Why would you put an action that you _strongly_ recommend against on the common operations list for Users??  If you want people to deactivate, put Deactivate on that list instead, instead of making people wade through your help to discover that that feature even exists.\r\n\r\nPS - I so wish I didn't run into head-slapping issues like this every time I use Jira.  How many years has this product been actively developed?",

The problem is that ExtendedSystemInfoUtilsImpl.getPlugins() throws an IllegalStateException when run on JDK 1.7.0_13 but not on JDK 1.6.0_39. Since we need to switch to JDK 1.7 this bug has very high priority for us to be fixed. \r\nThe problem likely lies in the different behaviour of JRE 6 and 7 when adding elements to an empty TreeSet. The problem can be reproduced with the following code in the Groovy Script Runner\r\n{code}\r\nimport com.atlassian.jira.util.system.ExtendedSystemInfoUtils\r\nimport com.atlassian.jira.util.system.ExtendedSystemInfoUtilsImpl;\r\nimport com.atlassian.jira.web.bean.I18nBean\r\nimport com.atlassian.plugin.Plugin\r\n\r\nExtendedSystemInfoUtils extendedSystemInfoUtils = new ExtendedSystemInfoUtilsImpl(new I18nBean(Locale.ENGLISH));\r\n\r\nCollection<Plugin> plugins = extendedSystemInfoUtils.getPlugins()\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if this behaviour came with JDK 1.7.0_13 or has been in JDK 1.7 since the beginning.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nDieter\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nMove JIRA over to Java 6. Please note as per our [Supported Platforms|http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Supported+Platforms] Java 6 is not supported in JIRA 6.\r\n\r\n# Install Java 6 JRE/JDK.\r\n# Stop JIRA.\r\n# Change the {{$JAVA_HOME}} to point to the Java 6 JRE/JDK.\r\n# Clear our the plugin cache, as it is Java version dependent (starting up will cause failures if we don't clear it). To do so, remove the following directories:\r\n{noformat}\r\n$JIRA_HOME/plugins/.bundled_plugins\r\n$JIRA_HOME/plugins/.osgi_plugins\r\n{noformat}\r\n(i) These are temporary files and folders and will be recreated when JIRA starts.\r\n# Start JIRA.\r\n# Test you can create a Support Email.",

This requires scrolling all the time within gadgets and on the screen itself. This is awkward and time consuming. Also all the buttons and icons etc are huge.\r\n\r\nFor example, in JIRA 3 I could see 2 weeks of timesheets on screen at once. In the new time sheet I have to scroll vertically and horizontally. (I'm using a 24 inch screen in hi resolution).\r\n\r\nIt is very difficult in issue lists and other tables to quickly see data without scrolling back and forth.\r\n\r\nA compact style e.g. (2px, 2px padding on tables etc) would help user see all data.\r\n\r\nMy current workaround is to use GreaseMonkey (Firefox) and TamperMonkey (Chrome) to change the styles, but a compact style (like gmail) would make using JIRA much more efficient.",
