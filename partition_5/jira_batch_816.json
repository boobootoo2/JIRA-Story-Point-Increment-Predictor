Every Nagios alert has a url; every Noctane issue has a URL. If we had a bot that could create a JIRA issue and link it back to the remote url, this would be a start. However, we want to make sure that updates to the noctane issue/nagios alert get added to the same issue.\r\n\r\nThe cleanest way I can think of managing this would be if we can use JQL to search for \"issues that link to this remote url\"; but that's not currently possible.\r\n\r\nThe second-cleanest way I can think of managing this is to put the url (or some unique subset of it, like the Noctane issue number) in a custom field. However, the requirement that this field would have to be displayed on the issue type's issue-create screen means that this custom field would get flashed in front of humans all the time. My experience with doing this is that users get confused by this and start asking \"Why do I have to fill in this field?\", so I'd prefer to avoid having to do that if at all possible.",

In some places the servers are not as stable as others so one might go down.  \r\n\r\nIf we could group them together in Jira so that if it sees the same account(user/group) in both directories in the same directory group it recognizes them as the same account.  This would allow external user/password management to continue uninterrupted if one of the directories is not longer accessible.\r\n\r\nIn our particular case, we are unable to take advantage of the external user/password management features because several times a week at least one of our Domain Controllers goes down - I don't manage them:(.  Jira doesn't recognize one account as being the same in different directories.\r\n\r\nSo I would like to see the ability to create User Directory groups.  Accounts with the same name in each directory within the same directory group will be viewed by Jira as the same user account or user group.\r\n\r\nDoes this sound Feasible?  Most companies do not put Active Directory behind a load balancer so this feature would be helpful.\r\n\r\nThanks",

      "description": "I'm basically creating a new ticket for this JRA:\r\nJRA-24174\r\n\r\nI believe the description was confusing, which lead us to believe that the problem was manually editing the database.  In reality, this is a problem with deleting directories in JIRA's interface.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n* Create a new LDAP directory in JIRA (delegated or not, reproducible in both)\r\n* Synchronise this directory\r\n* Verify that users/groups/memberships have been added to JIRA\r\n* Check the database cwd_directory table.  Notice the new directory and it's ID\r\n* Back in JIRA's interface, disable/remove the new directory\r\n* Now query the database again\r\n* Notice that there is still data in cwd_user, cwd_user_attributes,cwd_group, cwd_membership referencing the deleted directory.\r\n\r\nThis causes no functionality loss within JIRA, but it will definitely clutter up the database.  This is leaves invalid entries, making it harder to troubleshoot.  This is especially a problem for admins testing new directory setups and have thousands of users.\r\n\r\nOn top of that, there really needs to be added are Foreign Key constraints to the tables.\r\n\r\nFor example, on the Confluence side there is this constraint:\r\n{code}TABLE \"cwd_user\" CONSTRAINT \"fk_user_dir_id\" FOREIGN KEY (directory_id) REFERENCES cwd_directory(id){code}",

Because this workflow is used by more than 15 workflow schemes and these WF schemes are involved up to 40 projects - you know already - it would be an enormous effort to change the WF, WF scheme...\r\nIs there any jelly script for removing this step?

However, {{request.getSession()}} creates a session if none is attached to the request. This results in sessions being created unnecessarily.

I'm marking this as minor because there are general workarounds afoot (JRA-27406 to rapidly expire one-request sessions, and CWD-2784 to avoid calling logout on the concrete Authenticator if there is no session). However, it would be worth fixing the root cause.\r\n",

Basically, in JIRA5 it slightly changed it's behaviour, and now, when we try to type something in the field - it's not coming up with suggestions as it should. Looks like a JS problem, but the strange thing here is that this problem persists on several machines, while working fine on other machines under very similar conditions. \r\n\r\nSure cookies and cache clearing doesn't help. It's reproduced at least on 3 PCs in our company and is quite annoying. \r\n\r\nThere is a workaround, is you type in the login of required user - it works fine, but really this is not what we want it to be.\r\n\r\nI've looked around but couldn't find this issue already posted. If there is one - please lead me to it.",
