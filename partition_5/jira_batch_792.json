This way, it would be nice if you could have an option for upgrading JIRA on the fly (or in background) with no restart required. \r\n\r\nThis improvement doesn't ask for a upgrade button as requested in JRA-26054.

It took me 30 minutes to find it in the new AOD/JIRA UI design. That's just a search for a heading, what about when I can't remember which screen an obscure but critical parameter is on? In these cases, I end up googling it, sifting through 2 or 3 old articles, finding the \"where to find this\" and then remapping this back to my own config. A little index of the screens plus some autocomplete would save a ton of work.\r\n\r\nI have ranked this as \"major\" given that every time I set about making changes in any part of my atlassian config(s), it generally loses 0.5-2 hours of my day. This in itself isn't the cure, but it would save about 25%.\r\n\r\nApplies equally to Standalone and self-hosted.\r\n\r\nThis request would be similar to apple osx settings panel.",

How to reproduce the issue.\r\n\r\nThe site we're developing has the following configuration:\r\n\r\n{code:html}\r\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no\" />\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nWhen you click the Issue collector tab/button, the popup appears centered in the viewport, but the width and height are fixed at sizes way too large for the window.\r\n\r\n\r\nh1. Proposed resolution\r\n\r\nMake the pop-up form's height and width, and layout respond to the browser frame (i.e. adaptive/responsive web design).\r\n\r\nIntroduce media queries at various standard breakpoints to offer alternative layouts for smaller screens.\r\n\r\nh1. Workaround\r\n\r\nI've been able to achieve what I need using the following snippet of CSS:\r\n\r\n{code}\r\n/* Issue collector tweaks for smaller screens */\r\n@media screen and (max-width: 740px) {\r\n  .atlwdg-popup {\r\n    left: 0 !important;\r\n    top: 0 !important;\r\n    height: 100% !important;\r\n    width: 100% !important;\r\n    margin: 0 !important;\r\n    padding: 0 !important;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nUPDATE: The pop-up is still too wide, the email field is still partially hidden and the text-area doesnt wrap below its field label, but since these elements are placed within an i-frame I have no control over their theming from my application.\r\n\r\nAs a side note, this issue appears to affect *All popups produced by Jira*, and this simple code tweak could be released for a quick win on mobile devices. ;)\r\n",
