[See the corresponding bug report|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-45747].\n  {panel}\n\nh3. Summary\r\nWhen creating a new issue from JIRA and dragging and dropping an attachment, it will prevent interaction with the currently loaded issue, whether the issue is actually created or not.\r\n\r\nh3. Environment\r\n* JIRA 7.0.0-OD-08-001\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Visit any issue in JIRA (the issue only occurs on top of another issue, not from dashboard)\r\n# Click to *Create* a new issue\r\n# Drag an attachment to the window, being careful not to drag it to the actual attachment panel. It must select the whole page, like this:\r\n!Screen Shot 2015-10-12 at 16.18.58.jpg|thumbnail!\r\n# Either submit the ticket or click cancel.\r\n# Attempt to click anything that can usually be interacted with on the ticket that remains on the screen\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nYou would normally be able to click around on the issue that remains behind.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nNo errors in the logs, nothing in Network Console.\r\n\r\nh3.Workaround\r\n* Manually attach file by clicking *Browse*\r\n* Drag directly to attachment panel",

Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Create 3 new screens (Screen A, Screen B, Screen C)\r\n# Create a new workflow that uses Screen C on a transition\r\n# Export the workflow to XML\r\n# Delete the workflow in Jira\r\n# Edit the XML and change the screen ID for Screen C to an invalid ID\r\n# Import the XML into Jira\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n* Screen A and Screen B should be deletable. Any other screens which were deletable should have the 'delete' link and deletable.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n* Screen A and Screen B are non-deletable.\r\nThe below exception is thrown in the atlassian-jira.log file:\r\n{code}\r\n2015-10-09 10:35:48,135 http-nio-8070-exec-15 ERROR admin 635x309x1 b2jps5 0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1 /secure/admin/ViewFieldScreens.jspa [webwork.util.ValueStack] METHOD: \"workflowTransitionViews\", exception: \r\njava.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Cannot find Screen with id '10322'.\r\n\tat com.atlassian.jira.workflow.WorkflowActionsBean.getFieldScreenForView(WorkflowActionsBean.java:89)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.jira.workflow.AbstractJiraWorkflow.loadFieldScreenActions(AbstractJiraWorkflow.java:503)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.jira.workflow.AbstractJiraWorkflow.getActionsForScreen(AbstractJiraWorkflow.java:487)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.jira.web.action.admin.issuefields.screens.ViewFieldScreens.getWorkflowTransitionViews(ViewFieldScreens.java:164)\r\n{code}\r\n \r\nh3.Workaround\r\nThe workaround mentioned in the Knowledge base article [Workflow error: Cannot find Screen with id 'xxxxx'|https://confluence.atlassian.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=295305313]. Below is the summary of the workaround:\r\n\r\n1. Search for the workflow with that screen ID with the below SQL:\r\n{code}SELECT * FROM jiraworkflows WHERE DESCRIPTOR LIKE '%11100%';{code}\r\n\r\n2. In the column DESCRIPTOR, there will be a line that used the screen ID from the error, for example:\r\n{code}<action id=\"791\" name=\"Resolve Issue\" view=\"fieldscreen\">\r\n          <meta name=\"jira.description\">1?????? ?? ???????.</meta>\r\n          <meta name=\"jira.fieldscreen.id\">11100</meta>{code}\r\n\r\n3. Shutdown JIRA.\r\n\r\n4. Update the database to change the screen ID, for example:\r\n{code}UPDATE jiraworkflows SET DESCRIPTOR = REPLACE (DESCRIPTOR, '<meta name=\"jira.fieldscreen.id\">11100</meta>', '<meta name=\"jira.fieldscreen.id\">3</meta>');{code}\r\n\r\n5. Start JIRA.\r\n\r\n(i) If problem still exists after applying above steps, you may also need to repeat same steps to the {{jiradraftworkflows}} table.\r\n",

I see no use cases where I would want to set up JIRA without Kanban boards. The Kanban method and Kanban boards are just as useful for business projects as for software development projects. Kanban boards for business projects should preferably be free from any software jargon and hard-coded software-specific behavior. With the announcement of JIRA 7 Software, it seems that JIRA Agile boards may become even more software-specific in future releases.\r\n\r\nHaving to go for the full JIRA Software license just to get Kanban boards available in business projects is far from ideal. Higher cost is just one reason. Added complexity for users from seeing irrelevant software features and terminology is more important.\r\n\r\nAlong with many others, I have previously requested more flexible configuration options for JIRA Agile boards, in particular more dynamic filters.\r\n\r\nPlease consider adding a generic, flexible Kanban board as part of JIRA Core, or at least as an add-on.",

Problem Definition\r\n\r\nThe @mention feature uses a \"contains\" match for the REST query to find suggested users.  The JavaScript part of the feature uses a \"starts with\" match.\r\n\r\nIn some environments this means no users will be suggested even though there are users that could be shown.  This makes it hard to use the @mention feature.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n* User types \"@joh\".\r\n* REST API returns 10 records: [^mention-rest-joh.txt]\r\n* Very few records are shown b/c this customer uses \"LastName,FirstName\" and random account IDs.\r\n\r\n!mention-joh.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n\r\n* Make the JavaScript use a \"contains\" search just like the REST call.\r\n* Split on \",\" in addition to space characters to find the parts of the Display Name.\r\n\r\n[^mention-search-contains.patch.txt]\r\n\r\n_(This patch could not be tested because I had trouble running JIRA from source.

This makes it harder to find people you want to include in work on a ticket.\r\n\r\nCompounding the problem, matches in the email address are bolded even though this is _not_ used for the list of suggested users. See JRA-59230.\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Environment\r\n* Reproduced in JIRA 6.3.12, 6.3.15, 6.4.12\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# In a fresh JIRA installation create user accounts using the data in this list: [^mention-test-users.txt]\r\n# Go to a JIRA issue and create a comment\r\n# Enter text \"@jo\" and observe which users are shown.  Also note that \"jo\" at beginning of the email address is shown in bold like the matches in username and full name:\r\n!mention-jo.png|thumbnail!\r\n# Add an \"h\" onto the @mention, e.g. \"@joh\".\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nThe JEDY235544 account should be shown in the list of suggested users due to match on \"johnston.cory@example.com\".\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nThe JEDY235544 account is not suggested, only the accounts where the first name, last name, or username start with \"joh\".\r\n\r\nh3. Notes\r\n\r\nWe can see that the REST calls are returning 10 users using a \"contains\" search.  The JavaScript component searches within those results.\r\n* [^mention-rest-jo.txt]\r\n* [^mention-rest-joh.txt]\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nMake the @mention JavaScript component search on email addresses. [^option1-SearchEmail.patch.txt]\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, we should stop bolding matches in the email address. [^option2-NoEmailBolding.patch.txt]. See JRA-59230.\r\n\r\n_(I was unable to test the patches because I had trouble running JIRA from source.  I hope they are helpful to illustrate the problem.)_",

It can be easily done because we have user context within application.\r\n\r\n*The problem:*\r\n\r\nWhen user is logged in to Jira those default values overrides real user's identity, so issue's reporter would be set based on name/email fields, +not+ on user's Jira session.\r\n\r\nIn our organization each user has many email aliases, so it is possible that email from app context will be different to Jira's account email. So finally, if we set default email when configuring collector and user is logged in, but has different email on Jira, we can lose some reliable data because reporter in this issue could be default assignee (default email not matched) instead of real Jira user.\r\n\r\n*Possible workaround:*\r\n\r\nIt could be possible to bypass this problem if determining user on the JS level (when configuring collector) would be possible. Real data isn't even required, only boolean flag if user has session. I have tried many ways, but most of them are blocked by same origin policy. I also wanted to get user from {{X-AUSERNAME}} header (additional request to collector's configuration), but without success.\r\n\r\n*Real solution:*\r\n\r\nUse Jira's session instead of name/email values passed from collector, especially since  clicking \"not you\" does not allow to provide name and email (JRA-32342 / JRA-38869).",

Problem Definition\r\nRelying on MIME type information regarding JIRA issue attachments supplied by browsers can often be unreliable, causing JIRA to store attachment data with wrong MIME types in the database. This could lead to minor issues on how this attachments should be handled when downloading from the issue since the content-header is set wrongly based on the wrong MIME type recorded in the database.\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\nA minor validation e.g. based on known file extensions should be used to determine the most appropriate file type when storing attachment data.\r\n \r\nh3. Notes \r\n* It initially appeared JIRA already had such a feature based on https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRA-871. However after a report from a customer, I was able to personally reproduce a scenario where JIRA basically stores the wrong MIME type (text/pdf instead of application/pdf) when a PDF file was uploaded to JIRA using Firefox with corrupt MIME type definitions library. Basically this caused issues when downloading the pdf files in other browsers because the browsers tried to render the PDF file as a text file based on the content headers sent by JIRA, resulting in gibberish characters outputted on the screen.",
