Expected Result\r\n\r\n* \"updated >= 2016-07-13\" should show the Date and Time component\r\n*  \"updatedDate >= 2016-07-13\" should on shows the Date component in the Last Updated column.\r\n\r\nh3. Instance Details\r\n \r\n* Any instance with JIRA are able to replicate the issue.\r\n \r\nh3. Investigation Done\r\n \r\n* queried \"updated = 2016-07-13\" and  \"updatedDate = 2016-07-13\" will produce the same result.\r\n* Asked developers regarding this behaviour. As stated by them, SystemSearchConstants.UPDATE_DATE defines two clause names for the same field which are \"updated\" and \"updatedDate\". The duplication exists for consistency with createdDate and resolutionDate. Also mentioned that it is very difficult to remove JQL, as it ends up being stored in the database. E.g. when you save a filter, that JQL is then stored in the database.\r\n\r\nh3. Suggestion\r\n\r\nSegregate \"updatedDate\" with \"updated\" clause names from SystemSearchConstants.UPDATE_DATE as this would be consistent with the query field names and expecting the followings results:\r\n\r\n# querying updatedDate JQL field will show the result of *Date only*, only looking at the date component and ignoring the time component.\r\n# querying update JQL field will show the result of *Date AND Time*, In other words, would look at both components, the date and the time.\r\n\r\n{panel}",

In order to allow for security compliance it could be a checkbox (default off) so that installations did not need to worry about the system attempting to fetch remote assets, but if this was not a concern it would be nice to not have to leave JIRA/Confluence to benefit from Atlassian documentation.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nScott Gilliland",

The original JIRA was running 6.0.8 we wanted to move to the latest 7.x.\r\n\r\nCreated a back up, but during import it had version miss match.\r\n\r\nDownloaded 6.0.8 hope that I can import the project there and upgrade to 7. Failed with a field error message. No detail what I should do, what is the error.\r\n\r\nSo decided use the Issue export button. Funny that you export issues into format, which your product doesn't support. Anyway I had a go with Excel. Generated 14mb size file. Import error: File larger than 10MB. Oh my gosh!!! It is 2016 and the file is larger than 10Mb.\r\n\r\nCreated another export dropping the tickets, which are closed. File size: 7mb. Let's start importing it at 12pm on Friday.\r\nStupid question about there is a field, which he doesn't know where to map, but until I don't map it to the summary field I cannot press Next. Wonder why the choice than. Hurray Import begins... There is 148 error or warning... no detail probably because your product has no idea as well that is why it is either error or warning. It is a thing.\r\n\r\nAny way... progress bar moves slowly... 7pm time to go home! Progress bar is 28%... Maybe it finishes on the weekend? Come in to the office. 10 am. Progress bar is at 52%.\r\n\r\nNice. 7mb 48 hour still not completed. Could you please share me that algorithm because I just cannot figure out what kind of algorithm parse 50% of 7mb in 48 hour on intel core i8.\r\n\r\nAny way. I believe it is safe to assume your product cannot import/export its own data?",

This is inconvenient.\r\n\r\nh4. +Suggestion+\r\nThe pop-up screen should be made non-modal, so that users can move it out of the view of the background screen and work on both simultaneously.\r\n  \r\n{panel:title=Atlassian Update \u2013 Jul 2016|borderStyle=solid|borderColor=#ebf2f9 | titleBGColor=#ebf2f9 | bgColor=#ffffff}\r\nHi everyone,\r\n\r\nThanks for filing, voting and commenting on this issue. Your feedback is key to helping us understand how you use JIRA so we can continue improving your experience. We have reviewed this issue over the last few days.\r\n \r\nI understand the modal dialog here can be cumbersome. Generally, making it non-modal and/or draggable is a great suggestion. Currently we don't have any work scheduled on this and cannot provide an estimate on when an improvement would be delivered. We will be looking into how we can improve screen dialogs soon, including transition use cases.\r\n \r\nRegards,\r\nDaniel Franz\r\nPrincipal Product Manager, JIRA Platform\r\n{panel}",

Summary\r\n\r\nWhen configuring a Pie Chart, users can select a *Statistic Type*. This loads a list of fields and custom fields which can be used. Custom fields are *not* sorted alphabetically. This makes it hard to locate a particular Custom Field especially if we have 100s.\r\n * This same behavior is present in the XAxis and YAxis select lists that appear when configuring the Two Dimensional Filter Statistics gadget\r\n\r\nIf this is intended, this is not convenient and should be reverted back to alphabetical order.\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Install JIRA 7 (tested in 7.1.8)\r\n # Create several Custom Fields (this is what I created)\r\n ** !7cf.png|thumbnail!\r\n # Create a new dashboard and add the Pie Chart Gadget\r\n # Configure the gadget to select a _Statistic Type_\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n # Custom fields are sorted alphabetically\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n # Custom fields are *NOT* sorted alphabetically\r\n !7pc.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\nAfter giving the focus to the select list for the _Static type,_ the user can write the name (or the initial letters) of the custom field they are looking for and the selection will move to the option matching the typed letter/combination. If a letter is pressed, after selection jumps to the first option matching the letter typed, the procedure can be repeated.\r\nExample 1: let's say you have 10 custom fields that start with \"A\", click in the select/combo  and press the letter \"A\" once, the option selected will change to the next occurrence of \"A\" in the list, if it is not the desired one, repeat the process until the option desired is found.\r\nExample 2: let's say you have 1,000 custom fields that start with \"A\", something like \"Aftercredit scenes are staple of Marvel movies\". to search for this, click in the select/combo field of the gadget and type \"After\", if the next option in the list after the currently selected option is the custom field you want, it will be selected, if not, repeat the process or type a more approximated combination.",

[See the corresponding bug report|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-61818].\n  {panel}\n\nI have this use case in Fusion DVCS Connector where I need to execute two DAO calls within the same transaction through _com.atlassian.pocketknife.api.querydsl.DatabaseAccessor_ (atlassian pocketknife query-dsl library) :\r\n\r\n{code}\r\n        return databaseAccessor.runInTransaction(connection -> {\r\n            Message<P> createdMessage = messageDao.create(message, tags);\r\n            requireNonNull(createdMessage.getId());\r\n\r\n            for (MessageQueueItem item : messageItems) {\r\n                messageQueueItemDao.create(item, createdMessage);\r\n            }\r\n            return createdMessage;\r\n        });\r\n{code}\r\n\r\n_messageDao.create_ and _messageQueueItemDao.create_ run the SQL within _databaseAccessor.runInTransaction_ as well, e.g. in _MessageDao_ implementation : \r\n\r\n{code}\r\n    public Message create(final Message message, final String[] tags) {\r\n        Integer id = databaseAccessor.runInTransaction(connection -> {\r\n             // SQL query DSL insert code goes here\r\n             return id;\r\n        });\r\n        message.setTags(tags);\r\n        message.setId(id);\r\n        return message;\r\n    }\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nProblem in the main code is that _messageDao.create_ and _messageQueueItemDao.create_ run with different connections and therefore NOT in the same transaction as expected. \r\n\r\nDigging out deeper, _databaseAccessor.runInTransaction_ calls _JiraHostConnectionAccessor.execute(false, false, callback)_ which sits in JIRA SAL Plugin :\r\n\r\n{code}\r\n    public <A> A execute(final boolean readOnly, final boolean newTransaction, @Nonnull final ConnectionCallback<A> callback) {\r\n        if (newTransaction) {\r\n            // Need to borrow a connection from the pool and start a new transaction\r\n            return borrowConnectionAndExecute(readOnly, callback);\r\n        } else {\r\n            final Connection existingConnection = CoreTransactionUtil.getConnection();\r\n            if (existingConnection == null) {\r\n                // no current transaction in OfBiz\r\n                return borrowConnectionAndExecute(readOnly, callback);\r\n            } else {\r\n                // Developer has requested to participate in existing transaction, and OfBiz actually has one running ...\r\n                // I don't think it is a good idea to set read-only on an existing transaction ... ignoring\r\n                return executeInExistingTransaction(callback, existingConnection);\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    private <A> A borrowConnectionAndExecute(final boolean readOnly, final ConnectionCallback<A> callback) {\r\n        return databaseAccessor.executeQuery(connection -> {\r\n                    // By contract must run in a Transaction\r\n                    connection.setAutoCommit(false);\r\n                    try {\r\n                        connection.getJdbcConnection().setReadOnly(readOnly);\r\n                    } catch (SQLException e) {\r\n                        throw new DataAccessException(e);\r\n                    }\r\n                    // If this returns successfully then SAL's DefaultTransactionalExecutor will commit the transaction\r\n                    // If it throws RuntimeException then DatabaseAcccessor and DefaultTransactionalExecutor will both\r\n                    // cause a rollback() ... seems harmless.\r\n                    try {\r\n                        return callback.execute(connection.getJdbcConnection());\r\n                    } finally {\r\n                        if (readOnly) {\r\n                            // Need to return the connection to the default state of NOT read-only.\r\n                            try {\r\n                                connection.getJdbcConnection().setReadOnly(false);\r\n                            } catch (SQLException ex) {\r\n                                log.error(\"Unable to unset the read-only flag on a borrowed DB Connection ... chaos will ensue.\", ex);\r\n                            }\r\n                        }\r\n                        // Connection Pool will set default auto-commit mode\r\n                    }\r\n                }\r\n        );\r\n    }\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nThe nested call does not reuse the same connection because _CoreTransactionUtil.getConnection_ tries to get \"existing\" connection from a _ThreadLocal_ variable but _borrowConnectionAndExecute_ code does not put any connection in the _ThreadLocal_ for further re-use.\r\n\r\nI resolved this problem in my code by passing the connection to both DAOs methods.\r\n\r\nOther developers may assume _databaseAccessor.runInTransaction_ and _JiraHostConnectionAccessor.execute_ handle nested calls properly therefore if you do not intend to fix this problem please update the API documentation at least.",

Suggested Solution\r\nAttempt to identify if text within E-mails is coding syntax and automatically render it as such. \r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n- Edit the description and wrap the config file in the tag: {{\\{noformat\\}}} at the start and end of the syntax specific text as that should help show a more sensible format, or escape the syntax manually using back slashes. \r\n- Configure [field renderers|https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiraserver071/configuring-renderers-802592570.html] to prevent JIRA styling the text as another workaround.

Summary\r\nDue to JIRA not being able to handle 4 byte characters when using MySQL (JRA-36135), emails which contains 4 byte characters will fail to be created. However JIRA keeps on trying to process the email and each time it does, {{issuenum}} will increase by 1 although a ticket is never really created\r\n\r\nh3. Suggestion\r\nAvoid this from happening. Some suggestions are\r\n# Either stop processing kind of mail the moment it fails once to avoid issue number from increasing OR\r\n# Change the process such that it will only increment {{issuenum}} when an issue is successfully created\r\n\r\nh3. Temporary Workaround\r\nRemove the email containing the 4 byte character by either moving it to another folder or deleting it.\r\n\r\nh3. Permanent  Workaround\r\nSee JRA-36135 - upgrade to Jira 8 or modify the database",

The fix now takes into account system settings such as proxies.\r\n\r\nTo clarify, there are two separate bugs for fixing the End of Life health check:\r\n# Proxies were not originally taken into account when accessing the [Atlassian Marketplace|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/], which is fixed in this bug, [JRASERVER-61781|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-61781].\r\n# If the {{jira-healthcheck-eol.json}} is not available, the check is unable to verify the results. This is tracked in [JRASERVER-63567|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-63567].\r\n{panel}",

Steps to Reproduce\r\n# In source project, ensure that 'create issue' does not have any users or groups assigned to it or that you are not a member of those groups\r\n# Choose an issue from the source project to move to another project, click move issue.\r\n# Note on next screen that instead of displaying a list of projects to move to, it displays the project ID.\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nThe project names are displayed in the pick list or an error is thrown to note why you cannot move the issue.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nProject ID's show in the list.

Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce*\r\n\r\n1) Configure Microsoft AD in jira 7.1.4, make sure AD has enough users ie. 10k users\r\n 2) Import few users\u00a0\r\n 3) Login to jira as local user and be on directory page\r\n 4) Configure jmeter \"http\" sessions using one of the AD user, session should repeat contentiously for 30 minute\r\n 5) Initiate 20 concurrent sessions from jmeter --e.g browsing boards , issues etc.\r\n 6) After 10 second of jemeter sessions initiate LDAP sync\r\n 7) Login to jira on another browser and keep navigating pages, after 3-8 minute you will notice slowness and LDAP sync is running forever.\r\nh3.

A FULL sync will still be affected, however.\r\nh3. Note on partial fix:\r\n\r\nWe significantly reduced the performance problem by resolving issue\u00a0--JRA-62742--, which was about skipping active user counting in cases when it was not required.\r\n\r\nAfter gathering feedback we decided to reopen this issue to look further into how can we improve user synchronisation performance.\u00a0",

Overview\r\n\r\nSimply put, the Fix Versions field is contentious and sought after, specifically on a Scrum Board as a third tier hierarchy for things like:\r\n\r\n- Good packaging and release management (ever accelerating with CI)\r\n- Tracking the release of an overall product\r\n- Tracking the progress of a milestone\r\n- Tracking a mega-epic\r\n- Tracking related work between two teams in the same project when their epics might be too focused\r\n\r\nThe Version Report in the Scrum Board is simply too good to only have teams make logical groupings of code releases with, especially as releases happen in smaller and smaller chunks as teams migrate to CI.\r\n\r\nIt is known that an issue can have multiple fix versions, but the Scrum Boards do not support this well (single version enforcement on drag and drop) and the push to use these strategically is doubling up on the desired usage of this field.\r\n\r\nI run into this conflict over and over! It's such a useful field, and I'm hoping to have more ways to extend the grouping and reporting without that conflict.\r\n\r\nh2. My Request (happy to chat about it):\r\n\r\n- Please keep fix versions as the are today, with reporting intact.\r\n- Introduce a new field (perhaps \"Milestones\") with similar:\r\n-- Interactions on the Scrum Board (drag and drop)\r\n-- Parameters for Start / End Dates\r\n-- Reporting similar to that of fix versions\r\n- Option on the Scrum Board to either show Fix Versions or Milestones as the primary drag and drop bucket (labs?).  The other would just be an editable field per issue, to not bloat the interface.\r\n\r\n",

(I say this even though I've used JIRA with wiki syntax for many many, many years; before even using markdown syntax.) Simply put, the JIRA wiki syntax time has passed.\r\n\r\nPlease provide us at least the option of choosing a markdown renderer in JIRA Cloud.",
