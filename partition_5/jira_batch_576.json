This bypasses user authentication enforced by the application.\r\n\r\nIn addition to data leakage in shared client environments, such as a public computer's browser, a cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw allows attackers to easily access sensitive data.\r\nh2. Details:\r\n\r\nConfigure your application to send the Clear-Site-Data header when the user logs out. Configure the header using the following directives:\r\n\r\n\"cache\": clear all cached files for this origin\r\n \"cookies\": clear all cookies for the domain (both HTTP and HTTPS)\r\n \"storage\": clear all locally stored data, including ServiceWorker registrations and appCache data\r\n \"executionContexts\":\r\n \"*\": all of the above, including additional future directives\r\n For example, the header shown below clears cookies and Local Storage.\r\n\r\nClear-Site-Data: \"cookies\", \"storage\"\r\n The header shown below clears everything and reloads all application contexts:\r\n\r\nClear-Site-Data: \"*\"\r\n The browser is not a secure storage area.

However, on unknown circumstances, this leads to extremely slow queries on the database if using Microsoft SQL Server. This issue seems to happen more often on older MSSQL versions such as 2012 and 2014.\r\n\r\nThe issue seems to be related to JRASERVER-65168 where it was described that single column indexes used by Jira might lead to this problem. Even though that specific bug is resolved, it wasn't created multi-column indexes for the batched notifications tables.\r\n\r\n(i) The same problem can cause delays in batched notifications delivery.\r\n\r\nExample query:\r\n{code:java}\r\nselect \"AO_733371_EVENT\".\"ID\", \"AO_733371_EVENT\".\"EVENT_TYPE\", \"AO_733371_EVENT\".\"USER_KEY\", \"AO_733371_EVENT\".\"ACTION\", \r\n\"AO_733371_EVENT\".\"ACTION_ID\", \"AO_733371_EVENT\".\"EVENT_BUNDLE_ID\", \"AO_733371_EVENT\".\"CREATED\" \r\nfrom \"jiraschema\".\"AO_733371_EVENT\" \"AO_733371_EVENT\" \r\n\r\nwhere exists (\r\n\tselect \"AO_733371_EVENT_RECIPIENT\".\"ID\" \r\n\tfrom \"jiraschema\".\"AO_733371_EVENT_RECIPIENT\" \"AO_733371_EVENT_RECIPIENT\" \r\n\twhere \"AO_733371_EVENT_RECIPIENT\".\"EVENT_ID\" = \"AO_733371_EVENT\".\"ID\" and \"AO_733371_EVENT_RECIPIENT\".\"STATUS\" = 'NEW'\r\n\tand \"AO_733371_EVENT_RECIPIENT\".\"CONSUMER_NAME\" = 'mailMentionEventConsumer'\r\n\tand \"AO_733371_EVENT_RECIPIENT\".\"SEND_DATE\" <= '2020-04-29 06:14:41') \r\nand (\"AO_733371_EVENT\".\"EVENT_TYPE\" \r\n\tin (92638,92593,92594,92594,92595,92596,92597,92599,92599,92600)) \r\nand \"AO_733371_EVENT\".\"ID\" >= 85125\r\norder by \"AO_733371_EVENT\".\"ID\" asc offset @P24 rows fetch next @P25 rows only\r\n{code}\r\nh4.

Issue Summary\r\n\r\nWhen upgrading Jira 8 between minor versions (8.6 > 8.8 for example, or 8.10 > 8.11 as another upgrade example), after the upgrade is complete, the admin will see a warning page that explains that some configuration/settings files that contained customizations could not be copied over. This is expected for any startup/installation file where the admin might have made changes. However in this case, the [$JIRAINSTALL|https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiraserver/jira-application-installation-directory-938847745.html]/bin/setenv.sh file will always appear on this list, even when the admin has made no changes at all to that file.\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # install Jira Software/Core 8.10.0 (other 8 versions likely affected)\r\n # Complete the setup and make sure Jira works\r\n # Make no changes to setenv.sh\r\n # upgrade that existing installation directory to a newer version, such as 8.11.0\r\n # start Jira after upgrade\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nExpecting that there are no actual changes to that setenv.sh file and the initial startup would not indicate there are when you first start Jira after the upgrade.\r\nh3.

Workaround\r\n* The warning page does not prevent upgrades to Jira in this case. This is just a warning message that appears to be a false positive in most cases.

      "description": "h3. Issue Summary\r\n\r\nThe warning logs were added, because starting from Jira 9 it would not be possible to use RequestCache without the context - it's incorrect and slow. Context is necessary for proper creation and termination of the RequestCache. Without it, RequestCache does not behave like a cache - it will fetch data from database for every call.\u00a0\r\n\r\nIt was straightforward task, but with unexpected results. It seems that in Jira DC incorrect usage of RequestCache is very common. So common, that it is flooding the log files of running instances & makes the testing very hard.\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Install Jira Software 8.10.0 or 8.11.0\r\n\r\nThe below exception is thrown in the atlassian-jira.log file:\r\n{noformat}\r\n2020-07-16 18:21:48,050-0300 PlatformInstrumentsLoggingService RUNNING WARN      [c.a.j.cache.request.RequestCacheImpl] From Jira 9.0 version creation/usage of RequestCacheImpl will throw the IllegalStateException.\r\n2020-07-16 18:21:48,050-0300 PlatformInstrumentsLoggingService RUNNING WARN      [c.a.j.cache.request.RequestCacheImpl] Incorrect usage of JIRA API.

Permanent way to set the package to ERROR (this setting will remain after a Jira restart)\r\n - Edit the file {{<JIRA_INSTALLATION>/atlassian-jira/WEB-INF/classes/log4j.properties}}\r\n - Add the 2 following lines at the end of the file and save it:\r\n{code:java}\r\nlog4j.logger.com.atlassian.jira.cache.request.RequestCacheImpl = ERROR, filelog\r\nlog4j.additivity.com.atlassian.jira.cache.request.RequestCacheImpl = false\r\n{code}\r\n\r\n - Restart the Jira application",

Can it be implemented to jira, it really should make our lifes easier.\u00a0\r\n\r\nE.g. New starter start on monday and I will create his account on friday, so when user receive his invitation mail, the link inside this mail is invalid because 2 days already passed.\u00a0\r\n\r\nFor your information the issue was already in solution in ticket:\u00a0https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-37072\u00a0and also in service desk\u00a0[https://getsupport.atlassian.com/servicedesk/customer/portal/20/GHS-194001].\u00a0\r\n\r\nThanks a lot,\r\nKind regards,\r\n\r\nAdri\u00e1n B\u00e1rdossy",

Issue Summary\r\n\r\nWe are facing an issue when user have a bookmarked page (JIRA admin pages e.g https://<base-url>/secure/admin/ViewApplicationProperties.jspa) and when they directly try to launch the bookmarked URL we see that there is a redirection between sign-on url and Jira url. This redirection keeps going on in a loop. The only way to come out of it is by closing the browser.\r\n\r\nNote: Disable websudo does not solve the loop.\r\n\r\nUse Case: Admin users sometimes need to sign in with a non-admin user account for test purposes. Eventually, an admin page may be incorrectly accessed, incurring in a loop solved only when closing the browser.\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n * SAML enabled:\r\n ** We used Onelogin and SSO 2.0 on Jira\r\n ** Jira Internal Directory\r\n ** We did create a domain on [https://www.onelogin.com/developer-signup]\r\n ** We set a username matching Jira's username (NameID as Username)\r\n * Bookmark an URL from the admin secure section, for instance the user management at http://<jira base URL>/secure/admin/user/UserBrowser.jspa\r\n * Open a new incognito browser and sign in using a non-admin user\r\n * Copy and Paste the URL bookmarked on 2\u00a0\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n * Permission denied error message, landing at the user dashboard page\r\n or\r\n * Permission denied error message, landing at the login page with the URL cleaned\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n * There is a redirection between sign-on url and Jira url.

Suggested Solution:\r\nAdd an option for admins to disable notifications on bulk changes for all operations across the system - this would cover bulk operations performed by regular users in the application, as such users can't opt-out of notifications being sent. \r\n\r\nIn the past, the {{jira.option.bulk.send.notifications}} property existed (but it seems like it never worked), which sounds like a useful property - this one was removed on through [JRASERVER-15660|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-15660].\r\n\r\nh3. Why this is needed:\r\nDepending on the scope of the bulk edit, hundreds of thousands of notifications might get generated by a single user. Today, Jira and the mail server are forced to take the hit if a user performs such a change. Having an option such as this one allows admins to reduce the impact of a big bulk edit without requiring temporary changes to a project's notification scheme.",
