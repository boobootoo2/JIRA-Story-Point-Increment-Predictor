      "description": "I am using cloudbees (hosted Jenkins) with the jira plugin 1.38 (latest available) and my build just started failing yesterday after I pushed a change attached to a closed ticket (in my current sprint that i just checked in but it needed a tweak).  It seems that Jira is returning invalid xml now when I try to do this causing the build to fail.  I had to remove the Jira plugin to keep working.  It stopped working May 29th.  I love JIRA but unfortunately I do not know how the Jenkins plugin works, only that it appears that JIRA is returning invalid xml to it when runs a query.  Can you be sure you didn't just push out a change to query results in soap api (and when there are no results) that has invalid xml?\r\n\r\n{noformat}\r\n[success] Total time: 31 s, completed May 29, 2014 5:27:12 PM\r\nBuild step 'Build using sbt' changed build result to SUCCESS\r\n[JIRA] Updating issues using workflow action Close Issue.\r\n[JIRA] JQL: project = Grocery and status in (Resolved, Staged)\r\nFATAL: ;

Those calls are made in a database transaction so that we can roll back the changes in case something goes wrong during the process. However, since caches are not transaction-aware our add-on may receive wrong data from the cache. \r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n# Start a thread - thread1. Within it start a database transaction (using the com.atlassian.jira.transaction.Txn API)\r\n# In thread 1 create an issue type using com.atlassian.jira.config.IssueTypeManager.createIssueType(String, String, String) - this will clear the issue types cache\r\n# Start another thread - thread2. Retrieve all issue types using com.atlassian.jira.config.ConstantsManager.getAllIssueTypeObjects() - the result will not contain the newly created issue type, because the transaction in thread1 has not been committed yet\r\n# In thread1, call com.atlassian.jira.config.ConstantsManager.getAllIssueTypeObjects() - the result will again *not contain the newly created issue type, although the call is made within the same transaction*. That's because all values are read from the cache, which was populated by thread2!\r\n\r\nIn our case thread1 is our add-on, while thread2 is JIRA Agile, which is querying the issue types. We have also observed this with custom fields, but I guess it applies to all configuration objects which are cached.\r\nThis is also a problem in the other direction - thread2 may see data from the caches which is not actually committed to the database and may be rolled back in any moment.\r\n\r\nThis is serious concurrency issue which may affect any code which uses the JIRA API for managing configuration objects within the boundaries of a database transaction and is very hard to investigate.\r\n",

Expected Behavior\r\nAs per [Viewing an Issue's FishEye Changesets|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Viewing+an+Issue%27s+FishEye+Changesets]:\r\nbq. So the key will need to be at the start of the string, or a character on each side that is not a-z, A-Z, 0-9 or the dash '-' character.\r\n\r\nAnd therefore it's expected that this commit will only appear in the Source Tab of the issue with key {{DEMO-2}}.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Behavior\r\nThe commit will appear in the Source tab of both issues ({{DEMO-1}} and {{DEMO-2}}).\r\n\r\nh3. Notes\r\nI've checked the JIRA FishEye Plugin source code - in the {{FishEyeUtil.java}} file it's mentioned:\r\n{code:Java| borderStyle=dashed| borderColor=#6A8EB3 |bgColor=#F8F8F8}\r\n    public static String makeIssueKeyRegex(String issueKey) {\r\n        return new StringBuilder().append(\"(^|[^a-zA-Z0-9-])\")\r\n                .append(issueKey)\r\n                .append(\"($|[^a-zA-Z0-9-])\")\r\n                .toString();\r\n    }\r\n{code}\r\nAnd if that's the case it should indeed be matching only the issue key then; the regex would be:\r\n{noformat:borderStyle=dashed| borderColor=#6A8EB3 |bgColor=#F8F8F8}\r\n(^|[^a-zA-Z0-9-])DEMO-1($|[^a-zA-Z0-9-])\r\n{noformat}\r\nwhich would exclude {{CR\\-DEMO-1}}.",

Introduction\r\n*How user picker works*\r\n* It figures out the group via Project -> Role -> Group (i.e. determines that the assignable users for project X are the users in the role Y, and therefore the users in the group Z).\r\n* Uses the configured User Directories (AD, Crowd...) to get a list of users that belong to group Z.\r\n* Matches the entered characters with the user name, the email address and display name.\r\n\r\n*Can you change the interval*\r\nUnfortunately no. It will do a request 75 millisecond after entering a character. If the user enters another character in that 75ms period, it will restart the timer. In other words, if the user types the name really fast, it won't do a search until the full name has been entered. A hacky way to force that behaviour is to write the username somewhere else, copy and paste it into the field: that will result in just one REST call.\r\n\r\n*Will it cause performance issue*\r\nYes, It could cause performance problems. At least, there are a two potential problems:\r\n* If the user has multiple User Directories, searching for the members of a group could be slow. Solution: reduce the number of User Directories and/or move the User Directory that will contain the requested group at the top of the chain.\r\n* If the project has a very broad assignable group, (eg: all the users in JIRA are potentially assignable, but only a bunch of them are actually assigned), retrieving the list of users and matching the characters could be expensive. Solution: create a smaller assignable group, it is better to add users when needed, than to add lots of JIRA users that never get an issue assigned.\r\n\r\nh5. Suggestion\r\nIt would be great if JIRA administrators can configure User Picker, for example the REST interval. ",

Administrators can do everything that developers can + some extra permissions (like administering the tool). I have done this in all the 6 tools (JIRA, Confluence, Stash, Bamboo, FeCru & Crowd) & it all works, but I have stumbled upon a bug.\r\n\r\nI added jira-administrators to the 'JIRA Administrators'-permission & 'Create Shared Objects'-permission. As a consequence, I can't add jira-administrators to the 'JIRA Users'-permission as this is not needed for administrators.\r\n\r\nTo be able to create a dashboard however, an account has to have the 'JIRA Users'-permission. This makes it impossible to create a dashboard as an administrator with the current permission settings.\r\n\r\nAs a temporary workaround, I added the people inside jira-administrators also to jira-users. But this is not the way I like it. I would like the jira-administrators to only be placed in the group jira-administrators and be able to do everything a user & a developer can + administration tasks.\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\nDimitri ",

Suggested Solution\r\nProvide an option to reset the default permission scheme to default, or create a Default Permission Scheme from scratch instead of having to copy one. \r\n \r\nh3.
