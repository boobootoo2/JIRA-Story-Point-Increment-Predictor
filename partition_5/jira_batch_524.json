I am evaluating this request as a part of a broader Customer Management strategy. Our focus is to improve the experience of managing customers.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe soonest I will be able to provide an update for this issue again will be the start of the new FY (July 2021).\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile I might reach out for some feedback on this issue, or one of the related \"managing customer email address\" requests.\r\n\r\nCheers,\u00a0\r\n\r\nBen.\r\n{panel}\r\nh3. Problem Definition\r\n\r\nThere's no easy way to change the customer's email address.\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nFor the Jira Service desk administrators to have the ability to change the customer's e-mail address and retain all the issues that is in progress.\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nTry migrating the customer account to \"Atlassian account\":\r\n # Login as a site-admin\r\n # Operate *migrate to Atlassian account* for the portal customer account in question\r\n ** !Screen Shot 2020-10-02 at 17.48.05.png|thumbnail!\r\n # Optional: maybe you want to disable the product access for the account. But make sure to keep *Has access on site* enabled.\r\n ** !Screen Shot 2020-10-02 at 17.49.34.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nWith that, now the user can change the email address at [https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/email].\r\n\r\nBesides, consider adding yourself as a watcher to be kept informed as to the state of this feature request moving forward.

Problem Definition\r\n\r\nThe customer wants to create a custom field where the users can select multiple values to the field.\r\nCurrently, there's the field type *Select list (multiple choices)*, but it's design is too different from every other field, it does not follow the pattern of other fields. That causes it to be *\"not user-friendly\"*.\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nIt would be great to have a custom field with the same functionality as the *Select list (multiple choices)*, but displayed like the *Component/s*\u00a0field (with limited options of values), for example (in line with dropdown, and the ability of filtering results).\r\n\r\nBasically, you would be able to create that custom field (Multiple choice dropdown list) and create it's possible values, just like you do when creating the *Select list (multiple choices)* custom field.\u00a0 \r\n\r\nIt could be described as the label field with limited possible values (the ones you create) and with no possibility of creating new values (like it happens when you type a different value in the label field).\r\n\r\nh3. Why this is important\r\n\r\nIt would make the overall design more user friendly, for it feels that the *Select list (multiple choices)* field should not even be there, his design is way more distinct and occupies too much space in the screen.\r\nKeeping patterns helps keeping the UI user-friendly.

Summary\r\n\r\nAn SLA metric will not stop counting when the status conditions are met if there is an add-on post-function as the last on the transition's post-functions.\r\nh4. Steps to reproduce\r\n # Have an add-on that provides post-functions installed.\r\n # Have an SLA metric that the condition to stop is based on a status. (ie: \"In Progress\")\r\n # Add the add-on's post-function to the transition to \"In Progress\" status.\r\n # Make it the last post-function to run on the transition.\r\n # Create a ticket that will start the SLA metric.\r\n # Perform the transition \"In Progress\"\r\n\r\nh5. Expected behaviour\r\n\r\nThe SLA metric should stop counting when the condition is met.\r\nh5. Actual result\r\n\r\nThe SLA metric continues to count regardless of the condition being met.\r\nh4. Notes\r\n\r\nThe issue is not consistent, around 15-20% of the tickets will not be impacted, but there is no specific difference between them.\r\nThe issue also causes the SLA to not show.\r\nh4. Workaround\r\n\r\nMove the add-on's post-function to an upper position on the workflow's transition.\r\n\r\nUse this knowledge base's workaround to recalculate the wrong SLA: [Missing SLA data in JIRA ServiceDesk|https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirakb/missing-sla-data-in-jira-servicedesk-828790603.html]\r\n\r\nh4.

Summary\r\n\r\nWhen a request is created via email and the reporter CC's a request participant to the email, the email will add CC'ed user as a request participant to the ticket.

Expected Results\r\n\r\nThe CC'ed user is added as a Request Participant, Request Language remains to user preferences language.\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nThe CC'ed user is added as a Request Participant, Request Language updated to Unknown\r\nh3. Notes\r\n\r\nIn the issue activity, you can see that the Request Language is set to a known value, eg: English, then when a request participant is added, the Request Language is updated to Unknown.\r\n\r\n*PS: The same problem happens\u00a0when you resolve the issue (Set the resolution field).*\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n * A possible workaround is to use automation rules after creations to re-set\u00a0issues with specific criteria to its\u00a0language.\r\n * To avoid excessive notifications when issue creation, Disable having default assignee in a project if any and assign issues after creation via automation rules. That will\u00a0result\u00a0in\u00a0having one notification only per issue.\u00a0",
