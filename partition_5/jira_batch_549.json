This plugin embellishes some custom fields with HTML generated based on REST calls to the plugin's REST endpoints. \n\nOur customer reported that their 'customer' users do not the proper embellishments, instead they get some Javascript error. It turned out that when a user who is not in jira-users (an SD 'customer') is accessing the page with our plugin on it, the plugin makes a REST call that gets 302-redirected to /servicedesk/customer/portal/1. Which means that everything gets broken. Adding @AnonymousAllowed annotation to the plugin's endpoint does not help, as it only works when the user is actually not logged-in. When they log in, apparently SD servlet filter (or whatever) redirects blindly to a bad place. \n\nThis is breaking our plugin in very bad ways and we are likely losing sales because of this. \n\nAre there any workarounds for this behaviour? I have tried injecting a serlet filter, but it is not being invoked.\n\nThe plugin in question is https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.spartez.jira.plugins.ephor-for-jira, but the behaviour can be trivially reproduced with any plugin that has a REST endpoint.

It's not fatal or not even severe but might cause frustation. Seems that it's possible to reply to customer (by transferring to Waiting for customer) by adding only internal comment. Customer will receive notification and from his point of view _nothing_ is commented but request is on his responsibility \"Requester action Needed\". He might wonder why as there is not comment visible.\n\nI would like to add a new validator (to JIRA Service Desk workflow) that when transferring issue to customer comment is mandatory and it should *not* be internal comment. I couldn't add validator (this is default vanilla JIRA installation, maybe comment presence needs some plugin?). Even there is validator for checking mandatory comment I'm not sure could it be defined that it should be public comment, not internal?\n\nUse case:\n\nFAIL:\n- Press \"Respond to customer\"\n- Add internal comment\n-> no new information is sent to customer but responsibility is transferred to him\n\nSHOULD BE:\n- Press \"Respond to customer\"\n- Require public comment (don't allow internal comment), validator is needed\n-> comment is sent to customer\n\nThanks.",

We tested JSD 1.2 \u2013 2.3 features. We have major blocking Issue for our setup JIRA + JIRA Service Desk. \n\nFirst, let me explain our business case Issue. We are using one JIRA project for supporting many different customers.  Customer information is present as custom field data.  Our plan would be having for each customer their own Request Type forms.\n\nMust have:\n-          one Customer Portal with many Individual Customer Request Types (Forms),\n-          each customer should not have permission to access Request Forms but only their own\n\nThis requires:\n-          Additional Permission Scheme with Request Type Access level,\n-          Or we can define per user access mapping restriction to each Request Type\n\nWe can\u2019t implement many projects = Customer Portals as it is current setup.\n\nIs it possible to add this suggestion as new feature? \n\n",

Summary\nResolve/Close request transitions in a Service Desk instance do not trigger the appropriate notifications to Agents/JIRA Users according to the notification scheme.\n\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\n# Define users/groups under the Issue Resolved and/or Issue Closed notification settings of a Service Desk project's notification scheme.\n# Create a Service Desk request in the Service Desk of step 1\n# Resolve the request of step 2\n\nh3. Expected Results\nThe users or members of the group as defined under step 1 should receive notifications of the request being resolved\n\nh3. Actual Results\nThe members of the group or entities do not receive any notifications of the request resolution\n\nh3. Root cause\nIn the Service Desk default generated workflow, the transition that resolves requests fires a Generic Event in the transition post-functions.\nThe notification scheme however acts on the Issue Resolved event. Since this is not defined in the post-functions, no notifications will be send.\n\nh3. Workaround\nThere are 2 possible workarounds for this issue.\n# Add the users/groups in the notification scheme to the \"Generic Event\" instead of the \"Issue Resolved\" notification. This will however trigger notifications on all Generic Events within that project to the defined user/groups\n# In the relevant workflows, change the \"Fire a Generic event\" to \"Fire a Issue Resolved event\". Ensure you do this for all resolve issue transitions in all workflows, and do not forget to publish the workflows after the changes have been made in order for the changes to take effect",
