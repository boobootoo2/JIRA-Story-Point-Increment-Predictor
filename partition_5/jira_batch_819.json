Our 5-person company has hundreds of customers. We simply cannot justify an $8000, unlimited license when in reality, only 5 people will be using JIRA on a regular basis, and the rest of the external customers will probably only once use it or twice when they have issues with our software.\r\n\r\nWe had some hope that, when we exceed our license limit, the users are still created, but without 'jira-users' and can't login or get notifications unless the entire project is public with browser permission, etc. This is also unacceptable, since a user could view another user's support request simply by playing with the issue number!\r\n\r\nWith the second option, it's impossible to correspond with the reporting users through JIRA. (We see that JIRA5rc3 now adds a line indicating the address the issue was recved from even if it was created by anonymous). This is useful info. But it's impossible to communicate with them over JIRA and have a record of the support ticket in this case because the notifications only go to the default issue creator, not the reporter.\r\n\r\nIf you are going to advertise the dual use of JIRA, you should have a permissions scheme that reflects this so that my 5-person company doesn't need to buy an unlimited license to use it as support. (There are MUCH CHEAPER support tools out there, but we were attracted by the concept of using a single product for both support and bug tracking).\r\n\r\nHow about splitting it up so that you have a jira-staff permission, and a jira-customer permission? With a n-person license, you can have up to n jira-staff (who can log in, send and recv notifications, create and update any issue, etc), and unlimited jira-customers (who can log in, but only view and comment on issues they have created, etc).\r\n\r\nThis would make JIRA so much better, would make your marketing less misleading, and make the licensing model better match this use case.",

I found references to both standars in Jira codebase. I assume that you use [ISO8601|http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=40874] about dates not [ISO8061|http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=36307] about alpine ski bindings\r\n\r\nHope this bug will be fixed soon.",

The level of slowness depends on the number of groups, users and the level of nesting.

The cause of the performance is attributed to the fact that permissions calculation in JIRA is very expensive and JIRA has a lot of lookups to do when users try to perform operations.\r\n\r\nh4.

Ensure that 'Use nested groups' is also disabled in the user directory in JIRA.\r\n\r\nIf you are using Active Directory you can eliminate this problem using filter directives to delegate the nested calculations to the Active Directory server.  This is not available for other LDAP servers.\r\n# In JIRA, go to *System > User management > User Directories*.\r\n# Edit the user directory that syncs with Active Directory.\r\n# In Advanced Settings uncheck the box nested groups\r\n# In Membership Schema Settings...\r\n#* Change *Group Members Attribute* to \"member:1.2.840.113556.1.4.1941:\"\r\n#* Change *User Membership Attribute* to \"memberOf:1.2.840.113556.1.4.1941:\"\r\n#* Check the box for *Use the User Membership Attribute* ...

This has been verified on 4.4.4, running JIRA on a windows box. It was easily reproducible on my box by refreshing the page in IE several times.\r\n\r\nThis is happening because the {{batch.js}} file is being truncated. When inspecting the logs ({{<JIRA_INSTALL>\\logs\\access_log.<date>}}) of my test environment, it appears that a key javascript resource, batch.js is being truncated:\r\n\r\n{code}\r\n172.20.7.39 1187x187x5 - [06/Feb/2012:19:47:27 -0800] \"GET /s/en_US-64k3hp/664/1/1/_/download/superbatch/js/batch.js HTTP/1.1\" 200 552757 562 \"https://172.20.9.110:8443/secure/Dashboard.jspa\" \"Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 9.0; Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; Trident/5.0)\" \"1pvk52d\"\r\n172.20.7.39 1187x547x5 - [06/Feb/2012:19:47:53 -0800] \"GET /s/en_US-64k3hp/664/1/1/_/download/superbatch/js/batch.js HTTP/1.1\" 200 346904 656 \"https://172.20.9.110:8443/secure/Dashboard.jspa\" \"Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 9.0; Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; Trident/5.0)\" \"1pf0uli\"\r\n{code}\r\n\r\n(note the size of the files, 552757 vs 346904). Some caveats about the sizes:\r\n* The bad size may vary as all we know is the connection is being prematurely terminated. \r\n* A bad size can also be caused if the user navigates away before the dashboard has finished loading, so ensure that the user did try to load the dashboard fully.\r\n* Ensure that they are trying to hit the Dashboard, and not some other page when trying to verify this as batch.js is served on multiple pages and the \"right\" size varies.\r\n\r\ninspection of the js contents actually delivered shows it is indeed incomplete, which is causing the javascript errors and the missing dashboard. \r\n\r\nThere is a workaround, which involves removing redirection from HTTP to HTTPS for js resources, i.e. removing\r\n{code}\r\n<url-pattern>*.js</url-pattern>\r\n{code}\r\nfrom the {{web.xml}} additions described [here|http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA044/Running+JIRA+over+SSL+or+HTTPS#RunningJIRAoverSSLorHTTPS-RedirectingcertainpagestoHTTPS]. While this should not result in reduced functionality, note that this means javascript resources can now be accessed via http directly, e.g. {{http://localhost:8080/s/en_US-64k3hp/664/1/1/_/download/superbatch/js/batch.js}}.\r\n\r\nInspection of the logs with DEBUG level turned on shows:\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nClientAbortException:

      "description": "{panel}\r\nThis issue deals with how JIRA manages HTTP sessions for stateless requests to the REST/SOAP API. The related issue JRA-27050 deals with session management for web Crawlers.\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\nJIRA creates a session for every request that does not already belong to a session. This creates problems on servers where the REST and SOAP APIs are used extensively. \r\n\r\nWith the REST API we encourage people to use BASIC authentication, which is supposed to be stateless. However, we end up creating a new session for each request that is authenticated with basic. This can strain the server unnecessarily.\r\n\r\nSee [JRJC-47|https://studio.atlassian.com/browse/JRJC-47] for a case where this has been reported. To fix this we need to make at least the following changes:\r\n* JIRA should *not* create a new session for requests that authenticate using basic auth\r\n* JIRA should *not* create a new session for unauthenticated REST requests\r\n",
