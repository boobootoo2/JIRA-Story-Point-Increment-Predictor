Notes\r\n\r\nIt is also possible this error may occur when performing an in-place upgrade from 3.3.1 to 4.4.5.

The expected behaviour is that changing an issue type is only allowed if the issues share a workflow and field configuration scheme. As such, we will mark this issue as \"Not a Bug\".\r\n\r\nIf we've misunderstood, or there are other factors to consider, please comment on this ticket and let us know :)\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nDave\r\nAtlassian Support\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\nA project is created that has multiple issue types.   For one issue type, the Component and Affects Version fields are not required.   For another issue type, these two items *are* required.    If you create an issue of the first type that contains no value for component or Affects Version, and then use the bulk operation to move it to the second issue type (staying within the same project), the following behavior is seen:\r\n\r\nOn the \"update fields\" screen (step 3 of 4 for the bulk operation), the component and Affects version fields will have a red asterisk, indicating they are required.   The \"Retain\" checkbox will be checked, but will be grayed out so that you can't deselect it.  When the user presses the \"Next\" button, errors will be shown on the Component and Affects Version fields indicating that these fields are required.   There's no way to enter a value for these fields, however.\r\n\r\nWorkaround:  bulk-edit the issues to add values for component and Affects Version, then do the bulk-move to change the issue type.\r\n",

      "description": "{panel:bgColor=#e7f4fa}\n  *NOTE:* This suggestion is for *JIRA Server*. Using *JIRA Cloud*? [See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-26297].\n  {panel}\n\nPlease polish the content I am providing below and include it in JIRA 4.4.4 release notes (or perhaps rather summarise it with a sentence or two and link to a separate page with more details).\r\n\r\nAs described in JRA-26239, we decided to break backward compatibility in JIRA 4.4.4 release with respect to a piece of the API related to mail handling (which, as far as we know, is not used often).\r\n\r\nh2. Incompatibilities\r\n\r\nJIRA 4.4.4 includes a dependency on {{atlassian-mail}} version {{1.25}} which is not 100% backward compatible with {{atlassian-mail 1.24}} included in previous releases of JIRA.\r\n\r\nJRIA 4.4.4 also ships with {{javamail 1.4.4}}, which we cannot guarantee is 100% compatible with {{javamail 1.4.1}} (shipped with previous releases of JIRA).\r\n\r\nHence, there are two significant points to note as a result of these changes:\r\n* The {{com.atlassian.mail.server.MailServer.getSession()}} method returns objects of the {{javax.mail.Session}} class rather than {{alt.javax.mail.Session}}\r\n* The classes from {{mockobjects-j1.3-j2ee1.3.jar}} are no longer exported (i.e. made available) to Atlassian version 2 plugins. This {{jar}} is no longer distributed with JIRA.\r\n\r\nh2. Potential Impact and Solution\r\n\r\n* We believe that very few (if any) 3rd party plugins will be affected by the two changes mentioned above and that such plugins will be broken as a result of these changes.\r\n\\\\\r\n** If your plugin uses the {{com.atlassian.mail.server.MailServer.getSession()}} method, doing either of the following should be sufficient to get it working with JIRA 4.4.4:\r\n*** Recompile your plugin against 4.4.4\r\n*** Use a higher level class like {{MailQueueItem}}.\r\n\\\\ \\\\\r\n** If your plugin depends on {{mockobjects-j1.3-j2ee1.3.jar}} (which is highly unlikely and could be considered questionable), we encourage you to either:\r\n*** Remove this dependency or\r\n*** If it is not possible to remove this dependency, bundle this {{jar}} with the plugin.\r\n\r\nAccording to the changelog for {{javamail}} (http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javaee/changes-220864.txt), we believe that these changes should not negatively impact current plugins. On the contrary, many bug fixes and compatibility improvements in this new version of {{javamail}} should make existing JIRA mail handlers more robust.\r\n\r\nh2. Rationale\r\n\r\nJIRA 4.4.4 comes with substantial mail logging improvements and capabilities, which should be valuable to customers and support personnel troubleshooting problems related to incoming and outgoing mail.\r\n\r\nPart of this feature work required the need to upgrade both the {{atlassian-mail}} and {{javamail}} libraries to the versions mentioned above. The anticipated small negative impact resulting from these upgraded libraries led us to believe that there was little or no business justification for supporting their older versions.",
