We simply need to click there, select a project and then create the issue.\n\nNow in JIRA 7 we don't have that option anymore. We need to click on _Projects > Service Desk_, select one Project and then click on the _Customer Portal_ option in the left menu.\n\nh3. Suggested Solution\nIt would be great if we can have a direct option to create a Service Desk, like we had in JIRA 6. Can be with the Service Desk menu back to the top OR a dropdown in the \"Create\" option, where we can select _Service Desk_ or _JIRA_ (not sure, but I believe we had this before in JIRA 7).\n\nJIRA Service Desk 3.0.2\nJIRA Software 7.0.0\n\nh3.Potential Work-around\nYou might be able to create a direct link to the customer portal using the [Application Naviagator|https://confluence.atlassian.com/jira/creating-links-in-the-application-navigator-346948276.html] as an alternative.

Summary\nAs a JIRA Service Desk Administrator, I would like to be able to set up my Service Desk to auto assign tickets in a Round Robin fashion. This would be extremely helpful if it offered several different ways to have auto-assignment handled \n\nh3. Environment\nCloud\nServer\n\nh3. Steps to Enable\n# Open project settings\n# Click on a menu option in the left hand menu (perhaps Auto Assignment?)\n# Select the type of auto assignment you want to enable within the Service Desk project\n\nh3. Actual Results\nCurrently there is no option to do this within Service Desk\n \nh3. Notes\nThis feature would add more value if it allowed at minimum these two types of round robin assignment:\n\n- Assignment based on number of issues each Service Desk Agent currently has\n- Assignment based on all Service Desk Agents that are part of the Service Desk queue (this would not take into consideration backlog per agent rather it would just simply go down the list and assign tickets)\t",

According to the documentation, if email is switched of in service desk then a notification scheme in JIRA can be used to set up a custom scheme. This still does not work well for us because we need notifications for some transition (e.g. a request is waiting for customer input) and some do not (e.g. it is placed on the backlog or an engineer has started work). It would be so much more elegant if an admin could check for each transition in the Service Desk if a notification should be sent or not. \r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\nCreate a customer notification scheme configuration. Admin can control the notification event and which customer should receive the notification.\r\n\r\nh3. Why this is important\r\nProvide flexibility to admin configuring customer notification.\r\n \r\nh3. Workaround \r\nNo workaround.\r\n",

This suggestion is to add a way for a customer with a JIRA license to navigate from the portal to the JIRA interface.\n* JIRA interface refers to JIRA Core, JIRA Software and JIRA Service Desk when viewing the project through the JIRA project view.\n\nh5. Example Use Case:\nAs a user of JIRA Software as well as JIRA Service Desk. I frequently find myself moving between these two applications. I would like an easy way to navigate between the customer portal and the JIRA interface.\n* Currently there is no navigation from the portal back to JIRA. I find myself going to the URL and removing the Service Desk portion so that I am taken back to JIRA. \n* When working in JIRA Software, I must enter the URL for the Service Desk portal in order to access the portal and create a request. There is no navigation I can use to access the portal. (A workaround is provided below)\n\nh5. Navigating from JIRA to Customer Portal\n* The Service Desk menu at the top of the JIRA can be used to navigate to the portal (Service Desk > Create Service Desk Request)\n* This menu was removed in JIRA 7. You can use [Application Navigator | https://confluence.atlassian.com/jira/creating-links-in-the-application-navigator-346948276.html] to link to the customer portal URL. JIRA users can then use the application navigator to reach the Service Desk portal.\n",
