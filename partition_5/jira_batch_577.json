      "description": "h3. Issue Summary\r\n\r\ncom.atlassian.jira.diagnostic.connection.DiagnosticPreparedStatement which is a PreparedStatement wrapper, maintains its own list of batch queries for reporting purposes. If the same preparedStatement object is used for multiple [executeBatch()|https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/sql/Statement.html#executeBatch--] calls without calling [clearBatch()|https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/sql/Statement.html#clearBatch--], this list accumulates batch queries. For very large updates which use multiple batch steps (like restoring an XML backup) this may cause memory pressure and in extreme cases \\{{OutOfMemoryError}}s.\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nrestoring an XML backup with large AO tables and using a debugger;\r\n # install Jira\r\n # create a table in JIRA database to test purposes named \"AO_111111_TEST\"\r\n # insert 6,000 rows to this test table (number must be greater than 5,000 as imported is using batches with the size of 5,000 i.e. 6,000 rows will use to batch inserts, first will insert 5,000 and second will insert remaining 1,000)\r\n # create an XML backup (*gg* > *Backup System*)\r\n # connect the server with a debugger and put breakpoints in method com.atlassian.dbexporter.importer.DataImporter$BatchInserter.flush()\r\n # import the XML backup generated above (*gg* > *Restore System*)\r\n # observe in the debugger that ps.batchQueries is not reset after the first batch is executed and size exceeds 5,000 on second batch step\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\ncalling {{executeBatch}} shall clear the batch, also on {{DiagnosticPreparedStatement}} because underlying Statement does that automatically without requiring explicit calls to {{clearBatch()}}. Hence calling {{clearBatch()}} between batch steps does not seem to be a requirement.\r\n Quoting [JDBC 3.0 Specification|http://java.cnam.fr/iagl/biblio/spec/jdbc-3_0-fr-spec.pdf] 15.1.2\r\n{quote}Calling the method executeBatch closes the calling Statement object\u2019s current\r\n result set if one is open. The statement\u2019s batch is reset to empty once\r\n executeBatch returns.\r\n{quote}\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\n{{executeBatch()}} does not clear the batch on {{DiagnosticPreparedStatement}}.\u00a0\r\n Even if SQL works just fine, *batchQueries* list accumulates all statements for logging purposes.\r\n\r\nIn extreme cases like an XML backup importing millions of rows per table, this may lead to an OOME. Below exception is a stack trace of an OOME resulting from above on a production system importing 9 million rows in a single table. Since we accumulate the statements, on each batch step, Jira prepares a longer string concatenating them for logging.\r\n{noformat}\r\n2020-05-08 19:52:26,888-0400 JiraImportTaskExecutionThread-1 ERROR doqinfraadmin 913x183x1 1mk8hdt 10.36.79.146 /secure/admin/XmlRestore.jspa [c.a.j.bc.dataimport.DefaultDataImportService] Error importing data: java.lang.OutOfMemoryError\r\njava.lang.OutOfMemoryError\r\n\tat java.lang.AbstractStringBuilder.hugeCapacity(AbstractStringBuilder.java:161)\r\n\tat java.lang.AbstractStringBuilder.newCapacity(AbstractStringBuilder.java:155)\r\n\tat java.lang.AbstractStringBuilder.ensureCapacityInternal(AbstractStringBuilder.java:125)\r\n\tat java.lang.AbstractStringBuilder.append(AbstractStringBuilder.java:448)\r\n\tat java.lang.StringBuilder.append(StringBuilder.java:136)\r\n\tat java.lang.StringBuilder.append(StringBuilder.java:76)\r\n\tat java.lang.AbstractStringBuilder.append(AbstractStringBuilder.java:484)\r\n\tat java.lang.StringBuilder.append(StringBuilder.java:166)\r\n\tat java.util.StringJoiner.add(StringJoiner.java:185)\r\n\tat java.lang.String.join(String.java:2504)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.jira.diagnostic.connection.DiagnosticPreparedStatement.getBatchQuery(DiagnosticPreparedStatement.java:146)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.jira.diagnostic.connection.DiagnosticPreparedStatement.executeBatch(DiagnosticPreparedStatement.java:137)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.dbexporter.importer.DataImporter$BatchInserter.flush(DataImporter.java:422)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.dbexporter.importer.DataImporter$BatchInserter.close(DataImporter.java:434)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.dbexporter.importer.DataImporter.importTable(DataImporter.java:120)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.dbexporter.importer.DataImporter.access$000(DataImporter.java:41)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.dbexporter.importer.DataImporter$1.call(DataImporter.java:71)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.dbexporter.importer.DataImporter$1.call(DataImporter.java:64)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.dbexporter.jdbc.JdbcUtils.withConnection(JdbcUtils.java:29)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.dbexporter.importer.DataImporter.doImportNode(DataImporter.java:64)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.dbexporter.importer.AbstractImporter.importNode(AbstractImporter.java:44)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.dbexporter.DbImporter.importData(DbImporter.java:70)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.activeobjects.backup.ActiveObjectsBackup.restore(ActiveObjectsBackup.java:151)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.jira.bc.dataimport.DefaultDataImportService.restoreActiveObjects(DefaultDataImportService.java:574)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.jira.bc.dataimport.DefaultDataImportService.performImport(DefaultDataImportService.java:748)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.jira.bc.dataimport.DefaultDataImportService.doImport(DefaultDataImportService.java:323)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.jira.web.action.setup.DataImportAsyncCommand.unsafeCall(DataImportAsyncCommand.java:82)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.jira.web.action.setup.DataImportAsyncCommand.call(DataImportAsyncCommand.java:64)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.jira.web.action.setup.DataImportAsyncCommand.call(DataImportAsyncCommand.java:30)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.jira.task.ImportTaskManagerImpl$TaskCallableDecorator.call(ImportTaskManagerImpl.java:176)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.jira.task.ImportTaskManagerImpl$TaskCallableDecorator.call(ImportTaskManagerImpl.java:148)\r\n\tat java.util.concurrent.FutureTask.run(FutureTask.java:266)\r\n\tat java.util.concurrent.Executors$RunnableAdapter.call(Executors.java:511)\r\n\tat java.util.concurrent.FutureTask.run(FutureTask.java:266)\r\n\tat java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.runWorker(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:1149)\r\n\tat java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor$Worker.run(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:624)\r\n\tat java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:748)\r\n{noformat}\r\nh3.

      "description": "h3. Issue Summary\r\n\r\nWhen updating a user name in Jira such as naming a user in an LDAP as the same username as an internal user, this can cause some undesirable behavior if you choose to rename one of the users back to their previous/any other username. Similar to JRASERVER-36594.\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Set up Jira to a connector LDAP directory.\r\n # Create two users, test and testtester. One in the internal and the other in the LDAP directory.\r\n # Rename the LDAP user to match the internal directory user. Jira will recognize this user as the same user since the name matches between directories.\r\n # Rename the LDAP user back to their previous username(testtester) or any other username.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nThis will update the current record inside of Jira's {{app_user}} table so it recognizes the user as its previous user.\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nWhen you change the user back to their old username in LDAP so they don't match the internal users username, Jira creates an {{app_user}} record for a brand new user and then renames the historical record of the user name with a #1 behind it but nothing gets added to {{cwd_user}} so the relationship ends up being broken.\r\n\r\n*Before Test*\r\n\r\n*app_user* table:\r\n{code:java}\r\nj890=# select * from app_user;\r\n  id   |   user_key    | lower_user_name \r\n-------+---------------+-----------------\r\n 10000 | JIRAUSER10000 | admin\r\n 10100 | JIRAUSER10100 | java\r\n 10101 | JIRAUSER10101 | test\r\n 10102 | JIRAUSER10102 | testtester\r\n(4 rows)\r\n{code}\r\n*After Test*\r\n\r\n*app_user* table:\r\n{code:java}\r\nj890=# select * from app_user;\r\n  id   |   user_key    | lower_user_name \r\n-------+---------------+-----------------\r\n 10000 | JIRAUSER10000 | admin\r\n 10100 | JIRAUSER10100 | java\r\n 10101 | JIRAUSER10101 | test\r\n 10102 | JIRAUSER10102 | testtester#1\r\n 10103 | JIRAUSER10103 | testtester\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nh3. Notes\r\n\r\nThis causes some undesirable behavior where the old user record cannot be interacted with in the GUI if they were an assignee of an issue before the username change. Example:\r\n\r\n!Screen Shot 2020-06-24 at 9.36.14 AM.png!\r\n\r\nHere, we can see the broken Assignee record in the JQL results. This user can be changed as the assignee but this shows the broken relationship between what's in the GUI compared to what's in the database since the link for the user between {{app_user}} and {{cwd_user}} gets broken.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nIf you plan to rename an LDAP user to an existing user_name of the internal directory, the following steps can avoid this behavior:\r\n# Disable the LDAP directory;\r\n# Move the internal directory to the top of the list;\r\n# Rename the internal users to something different;\r\n# Rename the LDAP users to the target username;\r\n# Enable the directory and move it back to the top of the list.",

Issue Summary\r\n\r\nAfter upgrading Jira from 7.x to 8.x, the error {{No ObjectCodec defined for the generator}}\u00a0is thrown on various functions.\r\n\r\nThe error appears to be because Jackson is being passed a list or set object to log, and it cannot serialize that object type.\r\nh4. More tech details\r\n\r\nIn the examples we have encountered,\u00a0{{atlassian-logging}}\u00a0is passing a LinkedHashSet through to Jackson, but the version that Jira uses cannot serialize that type of object and throws an error:\u00a0[https://github.com/atlassian/jackson-1/blob/master/src/java/org/codehaus/jackson/impl/JsonGeneratorBase.java#L495]\r\n\r\nIn Jira 8, the version of\u00a0{{atlassian-logging}}\u00a0in use was downgraded, to remove the dependency on Cloud libraries.\r\n\r\nSeems like this might be the fix for serializing lists:\u00a0[https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-logging/pull-requests/54/jces-227-add-list-support-for/diff]\r\n\r\nThat fix was released in {{atlassian-logging 3.1.0}}. In Jira 8 we downgraded atlassian-logging from 3.1.4 to 2.21. Jira would previously have been able to handle list/set serializisation, but not after the downgrade.\r\n\r\nh3. Environment\r\n* Jira configured with Log4J Json logging format (com.atlassian.logging.log4j.layout.JsonLayout.format). \r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nThis issue is instance specific. It occurs because people have either scripts or plugins that rely on functionality that was previously available in Jira 7, but is now gone in Jira 8, due tot the downgrade of {{atlassian-logging}}.\u00a0We therefore cannot provide steps to reproduce.\r\n\r\nI do however have an internal instance where this issue can be reproduced so please reach out to me for more info.\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nFunctionality that worked in previous versions continues to work after upgrade.\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nVarious actions can fail.

Workaround\r\n\r\nIf the stacktrace contains a reference to {{com.onresolve.scriptrunner}}, it's likely that you have a script being run by Scriptrunner that is expecting to be able to log a complex object type like a list/set. You should update or remove the script.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, as the failure is logging related, you can tune the logging level for the class that caused the error so that the failing logline is no longer called.\r\n\r\nFind and tune:\r\n # Get the stack trace and search for the first instance of log4j - whatever class is before that (the line underneath) is the one that called the logging.\r\n # Go to Admin > Logging and Profiling and set the class to a level higher than was called, ie if it called ERROR, set FATAL. You will likely need to do this from 'Configure logging level for another package.'\r\n\r\nNB: This workaround may not work in all cases",

Description\r\n\r\nWhen a user is added to a project role, when checking the Audit logs, this user is referred to by its \"user key\" instead of its username:\r\n !AuditLog_ProjectRole.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\nWith the recent [GDPR changes|https://confluence.atlassian.com/jiracore/gdpr-changes-in-jira-975041009.html#GDPRchangesinJira-userkeys] introduced in Jira 8.4, the user keys or newly created users have the format JIRAUSERXXXXX, which makes it impossible to know which users were added to a specific role from the Audit Logs. Instead, the Jira admin user needs to have access to the DB and query the {{app_user}} table to find the relationship between the user key and the user name.\r\n\r\nh3. Step to reproduce\r\n\r\n# Install Jira 8.4 or any higher version\r\n# Create a new user\r\n# Add this user to any project role\r\n# Go to the page \u2699 > System > Audit Logs\r\n# Look for the entry corresponding to the addition of the user to a project role, and verify that the user key is displayed instead of the username\r\n\r\nh3. Suggestion\r\n\r\nInstead of using user_key, the Audit Logs should show the username as it's more relevant to the users. Note that it's already the case when a user is added to a group (as shown in the screenshot below), so the Audit Logs should be consistent and show the username whenever some modifications is made to a user.\r\n !AuditLog_UserManagement.png|thumbnail!

Tempo has nice permissions to only allow Project Managers to see all team members' worklogs, but everyone else can still see the worklogs in Jira itself. Tempo claims this is a Jira Bug, because they don't change anything in the Jira configuration.\r\n\r\nIt would be great to have a separate permission in the permission schemes to allow only specific users to see the worklogs / other users worklogs.\r\n\r\nIn this case team members would still work on the same project, but don't see the other users worklogs. We have one customer in particular who is working in a SAFe environment and this missing feature is a showstopper (3k Data Center setup) at the moment!\r\n\r\nOther teams have to be able to browse other teams issues, but they should not be able to see all the worklogs.

Issue Summary\r\n\r\nConcurrent invocation of {{updateFieldConfigScheme}} on {{FieldConfigSchemeManager}} may cause a race condition which may result in IssueTypeScheme and PriorityScheme to revert to the default schemes.\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # create a project {{TestProject}} and assign a new IssueType and Priority scheme to this project\r\n # create a large number of projects (>500) using shared configuration from {{TestProject}} so that we have 500+ projects sharing the same configuration. Take care to create projects in a non-concurrent fashion (i.e. one-by-one) to not trigger the race condition.\r\n # create multiple new projects with the same shared configuration concurrently (in parallel).\r\n # notice that IssueTypeScheme and PriorityScheme for some projects may revert.\r\n\r\nSince this is a race condition it may be possible to not trigger the behaviour described all the time so this may need a couple of trials. For recreation purposes, we can use a load testing tool like JMeter for steps (3) and (4) above. For (3) we set threadpool size to 1 to and for step (4) we set it to 5 with no ramp-up time so that we try to create 5 projects concurrently.\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nAll new projects created and old projects have their schemes assigned to the schemes we've created at step (1)\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nFor some projects, priority and/or issuetype schemes revert to default schemes.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\nPerforming issueTypeScheme and priorityScheme changes, or operations that may trigger such changes automatically, like creating a project using shared configuration in a non-concurrent fashion (i.e. not in parallel but one action at a time)\r\n\r\n*Note*: this bug report looks similar to [JRASERVER-66625|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-66625], however, the execution path mentioned in this ticket (see steps to reproduce on this ticket) is already fixed and does not cause this issue. \r\n\r\nh5.

      "description": "h3. Issue Summary\r\n\r\nThe {{get}} operation on a {{DeferredReplicationCachedReference}} is deferred, hence causes a new {{DeferredReplicationStrategy}} instance to be created, registered to a {{ThreadLocal}} variable and run. The execution is almost exclusively no-op, for the majority of 'get' invocations won't cause a change in the cache to be replicated, apart from the initialization of the reference on first use.\r\n\r\nThis behaviour generates unnecessary computational overhead. Caches shall be optimized for reads as much as possible; for regular 'get's (which don't generate side-effects to be replicated) we shall have a non-deferred implementation. As an example, read-only cache operations like gets are not deferred at {{DeferredReplicationCache}} instances.\r\n\r\nIn addition, in certain JVM states like defined at JRASERVER-71058, registering {{cacheReplicationStrategy}} ThreadLocal may consume very high CPU.\r\nh3.

The user's directory is read only.\r\n{code}\r\n\r\n !Screenshot2.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\nWhen running the following SQL query, we can see that the group 'jira-administrators' exist twice in the cwd_group table, once in the internal directory (id = 1), and one in the LDAP directory (id = 10100). \r\n{code}\r\n select * from cwd_group where lower_group_name = 'jira-administrators';\r\n  id   |     group_name      |  lower_group_name   | active | local |        created_date        |        updated_date        | description | lower_description | group_type | directory_id \r\n-------+---------------------+---------------------+--------+-------+----------------------------+----------------------------+-------------+-------------------+------------+--------------\r\n 10710 | jira-administrators | jira-administrators |      1 |     1 | 2020-06-05 16:08:55.584+02 | 2020-06-05 16:08:55.584+02 |             |                   | GROUP      |        10100\r\n 10000 | jira-administrators | jira-administrators |      1 |     0 | 2013-02-28 11:57:51.326+01 | 2013-02-28 11:57:51.326+01 |             |                   | GROUP      |            1\r\n{code}\r\n\r\n(!) Note that the {{local}} column is set to 1 for the group coming from the LDAP directory (id=10100). Normally, local = 1 should mean that this group membership should be managed locally in Jira (since the LDAP group is configured as *Read Only, with Local Groups*). However, this setting seems to be ignored and instead Jira tries to add this user to the group 'jira-administrators' directly on the LDAP server. This operation fails, since Jira does not have the write permission in the LDAP directory.\r\n\r\nh3. Other symptom\r\n\r\nWhen trying to add the user to the group 'jira-administrators' from the page *\u2699 > User Management > Users* instead, nothing happens:\r\n- no error is thrown in the UI\r\n- the group is not added to the user\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nh4. Workaround 1\r\n\r\nThe workaround consists in temporarily configuring the LDAP directory as *Read/Write* in Jira, and then add the user to the group 'jira-administators'.\r\nNote that:\r\n(!) With such configuration, when the user is added to the group 'jira-administators' from the Jira UI, this user *will also be added to this group on the LDAP server side*\r\n(!) If you set the LDAP directory back to *Read Only, with Local Groups*, and then try to remove the user from the group 'jira-administators' from the page *\u2699 > User Management > Groups*, you'll get the error below. Basically, you will need to set this LDAP directory back to Read/Write, whenever you want to update the members of the group 'jira-administators'.\r\n{code}\r\nYou cannot remove user 'sa' from group 'jira-administrators'. The user's directory is read only.\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nh4. Workaround 2\r\n\r\n- Remove the group 'jira-administators' from the LDAP server. This way, the members of this group will be entirely managed locally on the Jira side.\r\n- Sync the LDAP directory in Jira via *\u2699 > User Management > User directories*\r\n- Add the user to the group 'jira-administrators' from the Jira UI",
