It is possible to change all these fields, so it's not a major issue.\r\nBut, if the user commented in several bug reports, their posts are just left without account but their nickname is left attached to the post, which can still be an issue.\r\nIt would be great if Jira could provide an option to rename the user posts on deletion to a chosen nickname (so that we can put \"Deleted user\") for instance.\r\n\r\nHere is an example bug report with said deleted user, but left nickname: https://jira.reactos.org/browse/CORE-4495\r\n\r\nWith my best regards,",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-43405].\n  {panel}\n\n*To Reproduce:*\r\nSet com.atlassian.jira.issue.search.providers to DEBUG to see how JIRA converts JQL into Lucene queries.\r\n\r\nCreate two issues with summaries:\r\nPlacer One: MBL-RFT-00063\r\nPlacer One: MBL-RFTO-000045\r\n*MBL-*\r\nSearch in navigator:\r\nsummary ~ \"\\\"Placer One: MBL-*\\\"\"\r\nConverted Lucene query:\r\n+pq_support_summary:\"Placer One MBL\"\r\n\r\n*Results:*\r\nAs you can see above, JIRA actually removes the Wildcard character when generating the Lucene query.\r\nThe removal of the Wildcard character makes sense because Lucene does not support wild card searches for phrases. See [official lucene documentation|http://lucene.apache.org/core/3_3_0/queryparsersyntax.html] for reference.\r\n\r\n- Wildcard Searches\r\nLucene supports single and multiple character wildcard searches within single terms (not within phrase queries).\r\n\r\nWhen you put \\\" \\\" it forces JIRA to convert the search as a phrase, instead of individual terms. The phrase \"Placer One: MBL\" matches the ticket's summary. \r\n\r\n*MBL-R*\r\nSearch in navigator:\r\nsummary ~ \"\\\"Placer One: MBL-R*\\\"\"\r\n\r\n*Converted Lucene query:*\r\n+pq_support_summary:\"Placer One MBL R\"\r\n\r\nAgain, notice how JIRA removes the wildcard character as its not supported.\r\nThis search fails because the phrase \"Placer One MBL R\" doesn't match the ticket summary. (that extra a without the -!)\r\n\r\n*Workaround:*\r\nOne workaround is to search on a per-term basis (so wild cards can be used) instead of searching with an entire phrase. So you need to remove the escaped inverted commas. \r\nHere's some sample JQL that successfully returns the issues:\r\nsummary ~ \"Placer One MBL R*\"\r\nsummary ~ \"Placer One MBL RT*\"\r\nsummary ~ \"Placer One M* R*\"\r\nsummary ~ \"Placer One M*  RFT*\"\r\n\r\n*Notice how removing the \\\" \\\" from the search tells Lucene to search on a per-term basis, allowing us to use the trailing wildcard characters.*\r\n\r\n*Suggestion:*\r\nThis is fixed in [Lucene 4.8.0|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-1486] JIRA 6.4 is on Lucene 3.3.0. In future versions use 4.8.0 to allow for more dynamic search functions with JQL. ",

Expected Results\r\nThe Workflow Diagram should display the translated status.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nThe user does not see the translated statuses in the Workflow diagram. \r\n\r\nh3.

This information is causing some noise at the customers and took me some time to understand what should I do. I think is important to clear this out to reduce this friction.\r\n\r\n   I'm not sure about the solution. Maybe is recommend leave the old JDBC 9.0 with newer versions of Postgres since this is the bundle driver or is recommend follow the JIRA war process to install the JDBC new driver. The comment from James Rice (at references below) resumes this inconsistence.\r\n   \r\n   References for this request:\r\n   * Issue [JSP-231367|https://support.atlassian.com/browse/JSP-231367];\r\n   * James Rice comment at Jan 28, 2015 from [Connecting JIRA to PostgreSQL|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Connecting+JIRA+to+PostgreSQL] page.\r\n\r\nThanks a lot,\r\nDaniel P Santos",

Notes\r\n\r\nThe new project sidebar makes heavy use of the {{sharepermission}} cache because it has to check the permissions of all the rapid view filters to build the rapid view select drop down.\r\n\r\n When an instance has more rapid views than the max size of the cache we just end up thrashing the cache as we continually evict entries that we just loaded. \r\n\r\nThe max size of this cache had a hard limit of 3000 which was always a problem, but it really only became apparent with the usage pattern introduced by the sidebar.\r\n\r\nThere's an additional problem in JIRA Agile that affects the rendering of the browse projects page which is documented at GHS-12109. \r\n\r\nIt is recommended that customers affected by this issue also deploy a version of JIRA Agile containing the fix for GHS-12109 as soon as it is available.\r\n \r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nDisable the new project navigation as per [Configuring Project Navigation|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Configuring+Project+Navigation] to disable it globally, or [Project Navigation Options|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Project+navigation+options] on a per-user basis.",

Problem\r\nOn JIRA Agile enabled projects, the Project Summary screen is automatically redirected to Agile boards when the new project navigation is enabled. To access the summary page, users must click the project avatar icon on the left bar.\r\n\r\nh4. Workaround\r\nDisable the new project navigation and the summary page is no longer redirected. You can do this on [per-user|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Project+navigation+options] or a [global basis|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Configuring+Project+Navigation].\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n# Access the Dark Features Administration screen via direct URL (_<INSTANCE_URL>/secure/admin/SiteDarkFeatures!default.jspa_)\r\n# Disable dark feature {{com.atlassian.jira.projects.ProjectCentricNavigation.Switch}}\r\n# Add dark feature {{com.atlassian.jira.projects.ProjectCentricNavigation.Disabled}}\r\n\r\nh4. Suggestion\r\nGive the option to users choose whether they want to automatically be redirected or not to the Agile boards.",

If all of it is part of a single batch.js file there\u2019s a significant delay before the browser can interpret the JS, which essentially prevents gadgets from doing their REST requests in parallel with other resource loading.",

I originally had the understanding that only users that had created content or been assigned issues would be kept around and simply marked as inactive.  We have recently had at least two users that have been added through LDAP, logged into Confluence that is linked with Jira (this is assumed because there are no records), checked their Confluence notifications, and accepted the OAuthtokens to allow Jira information to come through the activity feeds or other gadgets.  It doesn't appear that they had created any content nor been assigned any issues.  It doesn't even appear that they ever logged into Jira.  The users were then removed from LDAP, both Jira and  Confluence deleted the users.  I was then getting errors in the logs stating that a scheduled service was failing due to a token not being associated with a user.\r\n\r\n2015-05-03 09:04:03,268 atlassian-scheduler-quartz1.local_Worker-2 ERROR ServiceRunner     [atlassian.scheduler.core.JobLauncher] Scheduled job with ID 'JiraPluginScheduler:Service Provider Session Remover' failed\r\ncom.atlassian.oauth.serviceprovider.InvalidTokenException: Token 'IKOZsoL8SARD7liLDSEEnjaLm5kQcO2E' is an access token, but has no user associated with it\r\n\r\nI have already opened a support ticket and have a decent workaround to remove the tokens.

For example, when I set a ticket to Customer, I fill in the same Comment, set the Date to the currrent value and then click Customer. When I cancel a ticket, I set the same values every time and then click Cancel.\r\n\r\nWouldn't it be great to have a single button or link that I could press (perhaps in a sidebar) that would do it all for me?\r\n\r\nI have not found anything similar after a quick search. There are references to default templates and some rule automation in Confluence and the Cloud but that's not what I'm looking for. I want to be able to define an action or default values in multiple fields whenever I click a button or link.\r\n\r\nCan this functionality be added?\r\n\r\nMany thanks,\r\nDenis.",
