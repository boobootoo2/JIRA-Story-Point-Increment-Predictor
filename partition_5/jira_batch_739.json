Could it be possible to add a new filter to this kind of widgets to allow select the range of time that I would like to consider per each widget?.

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-37151].\n  {panel}\n\nFrom working with just a small influx of bug report on a few of my project i noticed it can be difficult to deal with the report. Mainly duplicate bug reports, and poorly created bug reports can be a main. I've found this is mainly due to users not knowing how to check for duplicate issues, and how to generate reports. So my suggestions to solve this are as follow\r\n\r\n### 1) Custom section for report types\r\nThe idea is to allow repo owners to divide up the bug report area into different pages. Say one page for actual issues, another for tweeks to settings, and another for suggestions. This way users don't get confused on what is a bug and was is a request. Currently i've been handling this with filter but that only helps the devs out. Most basic users don't use filters to search threw bugs. \r\n\r\n### 2) Bug report templates\r\nRepo owners should have the option to setup a report template that auto fills into the bug report. This way the user can answer simple questions that we always ask them. For example the version number of the software they have. \r\n\r\n### 3) FAQ , and instruction page \r\nIt would be very useful for a FAQ & instruction page to open up for users before they report an issue. This way users can see that we want a set guide line for report. I've tried handling this with an issue report that list guide lines, but it floats to the bottom of the report list.\r\n\r\n### 4) Sticky report\r\nCommon bug report should have the option to be stickied to the top of the report list. This way users can find the report faster, and i can keep basic info report in sight. ",

I can understand that this is needed for layout purposes but I think that truncation should happen at a different length, depending on the screen resolution, not a fixed one, as it is now.\r\n\r\nCould you please look into this?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nPetru",

Summary of Bug\r\n\r\nIf the Confluence which JIRA is linked to is migrated, then under certain circumstances, issue links from JIRA to Confluence would still be pointing to the old server instead of the new one\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n# Create an applink between my JIRA and Confluence\r\n# Export a Confluence backup, and restore it in a different PC\r\n# Change the URL of the applink to the IP of that new PC\r\n# Try accessing the link from a JIRA issue to a Confluence page\r\n\r\nIt should be showing this link :\r\n\r\n!proper URl.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nBut, if the user is not logged into JIRA, it is showing the old link :\r\n\r\n!wrong URL.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nh3. Additional Info\r\n\r\nThere is a case where the link does not work if the user is not a member of the 'confluence-users' group.
