For instance, it's not unrealistic to consider a given issue assigned at the SAME TIME to V2.12 for maintenance purposes, to V3.0 for back-porting reasons to the major release and to the Sprint 4 for the team planing purpose.\r\n\r\nHaving that is place, I clearly see multiple advantages:\r\n\r\n1- The ability to filter by Release Type (All next maintenance releases content or current and next Sprints plans)\r\n\r\n2- Given the first point, I would see a simple way to simplify the planning board right hand view given the ability to restrict the view selected release types only.\r\n\r\n3- In the planning board again, the ability to reschedule issues between releases of the same type while keeping the other assignment unchanged: for instance changing the Maintenance Release of an issue doesn't change its Major release and its Sprint assignment.\r\n\r\nLast but not least, it's an elegant way of solving GHS-945\r\n",

      "description": "Hi,\r\n\r\nWhen JIRA (3.13.5-#360) had been put into production at Gazprombank, the requirement of JIRA administrators and information security administrators was that Project Administrators should not be able to change project role membership. \r\n\r\nAccording to the approach used at Gazprombank any changes to user rights and permissions (in case of JIRA, project role membership) are performed only by administrators who act according to applications confirmed by information security administrators.\r\n\r\nSo we were forced to customize JIRA functionality in this part.\r\n\r\nNamely, we replaced DefaultProjectRoleService.class (\\atlassian-jira\\WEB-INF\\classes\\com\\atlassian\\jira\\bc\\projectroles) with a changed class (the modifications include calls to hasAdminPermission(currentUser) function):\r\n\r\n1) method removeActorsFromProjectRole\r\n\r\nif (hasProjectRolePermission(currentUser, project) && hasAdminPermission(currentUser) )\r\n\r\n2) method updateActorsToProjectRole\r\n\r\nif (!internalError && hasProjectRolePermission(currentUser, ProjectRoleProject ) && hasAdminPermission(currentUser) && actors.size() > 0)\r\n...\r\nelse if (!hasProjectRolePermission(currentUser, projectRoleProject) || !hasAdminPermission(currentUser) )\r\n\r\nWe needed a quick way to do that so we acted like this (sorry!).\r\n\r\nHowever, our suggestion for future versions of JIRA is to divide Administer Projects permission into two separate permissions:\r\n\r\n1) Administer Projects (ability to edit project components, project versions, and some project details ('Project Name', 'URL', 'Project Lead', 'Project \r\nDescription'));\r\n\r\n2) Administer Project Role Membership (to edit project role membership).\r\n\r\nPlease, consider this suggestion to be implemented in JIRA.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nRoman Volynets\r\n",

If I select a single project it works correctly and the calendar only displays issues from a single project not all in the instance.\r\nI'm listing this as a major loss of function as the customer noted that if you have a larger instance that makes strong use of version information then the Calendar becomes useless as it is so cluttered with information from projects that don't apply.\r\n\r\nOriginal support case is https://support.atlassian.com/browse/JSP-51818\r\n\r\n*Steps to Reproduce*\r\n\r\n1.

This white spaces scrambles the layout of the portlets on the right compared to the layout in JIRA3 where the portlets had more space on the screen. \r\n\r\nFor this reason there should be some way to switch to a horizontal dashboard selector or a popup selector that that preserves the layout of portlets.

We would rahter like to use \"resolution.name\" (Fixed, Added, ...), since that is the part, which is important to the customer, not the title of the issue, which was entered while creating. Many different issueType.names can lead to a single resolution.name (Bug, To Clarify, Question -> Fixed etc.)\r\n- defining of issue-Types and resolution-types, which shall be considered by the creation of release notes instead of taking all of the issues for the current version or to edit the templates all the time\r\n- defining / formatting of the fields, which shall be used and visible for each entry (issue.key, resolution.note (should be available by default and be a \"must fill in\"-field instead of creating a selfdefined field), issue.summary, resolution.date, ...)\r\n- storing of different templates and the ability to choose one them before generation (one should be defined as default). For example: that way it would be possible to easily generate public release notes for customers and then private release notes with inetrnal entries and comments etc.\r\n\r\nSo basically some some text and structure templates with some variables / place holders and storage / selection of several templates defined that way.\r\n\r\nMore or less the same, what users are asking about on the forums many times.\r\n\r\nThat would make Jira much more enjoyable than it is already.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nMark",

Cause\r\n\r\nPlugins using their own threads to perform some form of searching either through the SearchProvider or the SearchService.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nEach thread started by the plugin needs to cleanup after it has finished its processing. If its a thread pool then it should be cleaned before it executes its next task or is added back into the pool. The way to do this is to wrap your threads like:\r\n\r\n{code}\r\ntry\r\n{\r\n  doWork();\r\n}\r\nfinally\r\n{\r\n  JiraThreadLocalUtils.postCall(log, new JiraThreadLocalUtils.ProblemDeterminationCallback()\r\n  {\r\n    public void onOpenTransaction()\r\n    {\r\n        log.error(\"Thread has left transaction open.\");\r\n    }\r\n  });\r\n}\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nh3. Details\r\n\r\nIn JIRA 4.0 we keep a reference to all open Lucene IndexSearchers in the WaitableContainer. If the indexer is not closed correctly, then we end up with lots of IndexSearcher objects. They in turn hold onto the sorting arrays used by JIRA in the FieldSortHitQueue and as such chew up large amounts of memory.\r\n\r\nNormally in JIRA we open on IndexSearcher per thread and close it in a Servlet cleanup filter. This works fine until plugins start using their own threads. If a search is performed from a non-request thread it will leave the IndexSearcher open as the cleanup filter will not run on that thread. In JIRA we make sure we close the searcher on our thread pools, however, plugins don't know to do this. \r\n\r\nWe should fix it so that we don't need to cleanup the IndexSearchers in all these different ways. We should \"open\" the searcher and then immediately \"close\" it as you would a database or other resource.

When they receive the email, they apparently encode it in TNEF and forwards it to a internal domain where it is relayed to the Jira mail SMTP->POP boxes. Exchange 2003 does not support re-formatting the email to a different format when it forwards emails. My guess is, that sometime back in the days, Exchange for some reason was set to TNEF for this specific customer and HTML for our other customers. BUT, this is a production system in the banking world, so people are very reluctant to change anything that is in production and running unless one can prove the change will not break anything else in the systems. Which I can't. Roadblock.\r\n\r\nSo for now, the only option is to get Jira to eat TNEF encoded emails. Perhaps some kind of preprocesser that is initiated by the mail handler before it actually tries to parse the email?",

NetApp also has a number of facilities that better allow the management of files in backups to provide mminimum downtime on the server as well as the minimal amount of space used for backups.\r\n\r\nThe mount was successful on both the Linux and the Windows systems. We were able to copy files from the local filesystems on the Linux host to the NFS mount and read them from Windows.\r\n\r\nThe JIRA attachments directory was changed to use the NFS mount. JIRA failed to create the attachment with a permission denied error. We tried a different locally-mountd attachments directory which worked fine.\r\n\r\nWe were able to resolve this by using a CIFS mount of the same LUN. This is not ideal as smbmount is generally considered to be less secure on Linux than is NFS. We would like to have this addressed so that we can use properly use NFS in the future.",

However after upgrading to 4.0.1 we found that the front page takes a long time to load. It appears that the cause is the AJAX rendering, and also the way that AJAX sends separate HTML requests for all the individual gadgets. This overhead causes the page to take excessive time to load.\r\n\r\nWe don't really use the AJAX features that much. The ability to re-arrange the gadgets with click and drag is nice, but you only need to do that once and after that you don't touch it much. These small features doesn't seem to be worth the extra long loading time.\r\n\r\nOn firefox, the loading time can be up to 16 seconds before the Dashboard is fully loaded.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to have an option to disabled the AJAX features and go back to the static dashboard of Jira 3.0",

Symptoms\r\n\r\nWhen running JIRA on Windows and selecting Turkish as OS regional format, JIRA can't save some Gadget configurations change (e.g. filter id, project id). \r\n\r\nWhen saving the configuration of 'Filter Results' Gadget, the 'filterId' is passed as '' in backend Insert SQL and saved blank in gadgetuserpreference table at DB side.  SQL logging shows entries like the following in the logs:\r\n\r\n{noformat}\r\nINSERT INTO dbo.gadgetuserpreference (ID, PORTLETCONFIGURATION, USERPREFKEY, USERPREFVALUE) VALUES ('10523', '10051', 'filterId', '')\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nWhen accessing a dashboard after it's saved, messages like the following will appear in the logs: \r\n\r\n{noformat}\r\n[atlassian.jira.dashboard.JiraDashboardStateStoreManager] Stored state for dashboard with id '10051' is not the same as in memory state.

Go to Windows Console Panel, open 'Regional and Language Options', change Regional Format to 'Turkish'\r\n3. reboot JIRA instance\r\n4. Go to an own Dashboard, click 'Add Gadget' and add 'Filter Results' Gadget\r\n5.

I understand this was done to eliminate a customer's ability to configure things in a way that would cause a loop where Jira creates an email that generates a comment which generates another email and so on until someone stops it.\r\n\r\nThe business/Jira processes we have in place rely on Jira being able to process its own messages and the upgrade from 3 to 4.0.1 broke parts of our processes.  We understand the risks associated with the Jira 3 behavior and while we appreciate Jira becoming more idiot-proof, we need the Jira 3 functionality.\r\n\r\nThe only short term workaround we've been offered so far (in JSP-52456) is for us to comment out a section of the code in AbstractMessageHandler.java and then build, install and test the new jar.  We are hesitant to do this for a few reasons:\r\n\r\n* it sounds like it will leave us in unsupported territory if we run into any new problems after making this change\r\n* those changes would likely be lost in our next Jira code update\r\n* we don't have any Java resources in house to manage this\r\n\r\nThere are two things we'd like from Atlassian.\r\n\r\nShort term: We would like Atlasian to provide a new jar file or whatever the appropriate thing would be that we could drop in place that would have the section of code referenced in JSP-52456 commented out. \r\n\r\nLong term: We would like Jira to have a configuration option available that will allow us to have the Jira 3 behavior, enabling Jira to process its own mail.\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n\r\n",
