Therefore it is expected that the on top of the activity stream tab of the issue, you should see the comment and the last should be issues created as it is the fist task:\r\n!correct.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nSometimes this is logged correctly, however at times it appears the other way around:\r\n!incorrect.png|thumbnail!\r\nWhere the comment is logged as added first in activity stream.  \r\n\r\nh3. Notes\r\n* From the database from the jiraissue and jiraaction table, we see that it has the exact time stamp to the millisecond, therefore it seems that JIRA isn't able to determine which is the first event. \r\n* perhaps for this case, we can make JIRA always have create issue the first item in the activity stream to avoid this incorrectness in the future.\r\n\r\n",

What we'd like to happen (again as an additional feature, not a change to the core functionality of a session timeout) is an automatic redirect to a log in screen.\r\n\r\nThe end goal is to not leave potentially sensitive information visible to unauthorized users.\r\n\r\nPreferably, enabling this setting in crowd would apply this behavior to all products involved, e.g., Jira, Confluence, etc.. That said enabling this setting on individual components is acceptable as well.\r\n\r\nThe support ticket that this is in reference to is CWDSUP-12774",

Also, that searching in my email lets me search for my own words and findings as well, and I don't have to go somewhere else to search for them (unlike what many services like, say, Github do with their notifications: not sending me mine, which I hate). I love this!\r\n\r\nBut:\r\n\r\nIt does get annoying sometimes to do a bunch of actions in JIRA and immediately get many emails in my inbox. So I'd like emails for actions triggered by me to be treated specially somehow, so that I can filter them in Gmail (e.g. automatically mark them as read).\r\n\r\nIdeas for \"treated specially somehow\" may be: they could contain a particular string, which I could filter on. Another cool idea is what Github has started doing recently: if you're getting a notification because you were mentioned, the email you get is cc-ed to {{Mention <mention@noreply.github.com>}}. If you're getting a notification because you were the author, the email you get has a cc to {{Author <author@noreply.github.com>}}. \r\n\r\nMay it be possible for JIRA to do something similar, e.g. the email's \"from\" address could be \"<UserName>-JIRA <jira@zenefits.com>\" with the text in the from changing based on whose action triggered the email? (Right now, the from header is always: \"Notifications (JIRA) <jira@zenefits.com>\".)",

Summary\r\nSharing a single issue from within JIRA the email address of the user that has shared the issue is being displayed in the \"From\" field.\r\nIn contrast, when sharing the results of filter query, the outgoing mail server \"From\" field is being used.\r\nThis behaviour is unexpected and inconsistent. Whenever a notification is being triggered from within JIRA, the outgoing mail server \"From\" field should be used.\r\nIt appears this behaviour is also showing when inviting a new user to JIRA, where the initiator is used instead of the outgoing mail \"From\" setting.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Open an Issue in JIRA, and use the share button to share the issue with another user\r\n# Create a filter query, and share the results of it with another user\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nIn both cases, the \"From\" address should be set as defined under the outgoing mail server configuration\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n# The filter result share uses the address of the user sharing the issue in the \"From\" field\r\n# The single issue share uses the outgoing mail server \"From\" address\r\n\r\nh3. Notes\r\nThe mail headers will display the information as follows:\r\nWhen sending a filter result:\r\n{code}\r\nFrom: \"admin (JIRA)\" <outgoing mail server address>\r\nX-Google-Original-From: \"admin (JIRA)\" <user email address>\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nWhen sending a single issue:\r\n{code}\r\nFrom: \"admin (JIRA)\" <outgoing mail server address>\r\nX-Google-Original-From: \"admin (JIRA)\" <From address as configured under the outgoing mail server>\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nThis has been tested with Gmail.\r\nCertain mail servers/clients will only accept the \"Original-From\"\r\n",

Summary\r\n\r\nWhen you attempt to release a version in JIRA with your language set to French, the date box will autocorrect the month with a dot (ex : oct.), but the validation of the box needs the month without a dot (ex : oct). This makes it impossible to release a version.\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Set profile or system language to French\r\n # Attempt to select a Start Date or End Date when creating a version in a project\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nThe format should follow the date picker format set in Advanced Configuration.\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nEven when selecting the date from the calendar popup, the month will always have a \".\" at the end, which the system will not accept. Attempting to change it does not work, as when you click out of the box, the \".\" reappears.\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nChange the Date format parameters (or contact Atlassian Support to do this for Cloud customers) to a format that only uses numerals for months, such as to d/MM/yy\r\n\r\n[https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/Cloud/__date+and+time+formats]\r\nh3. Workaround.2\r\n\r\nChange the system language to English;\r\n\r\nPerform the change in the version date;\r\n\r\nChange back de language to French.\r\n\r\nh3.

Then, if we refer to the page at _JIRA Administration > User Management > User_ we could see the \"Failed Login Count\" is increasing and Admin will be able to reset it. But, this will remain until the user is using the right credentials to login or an Admin resets the failed login count.\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution:\r\nHence, it will be great if there is a Configuration that will resets the failed login count automatically in a set period of time. Just like most login feature where the user needs to wait for 5 minutes for them to make another attempt to login, this will reset the failed login count.\r\n",

The restrictions are:\r\n* To add a status, the status must already exist in the JIRA instance i.e. the project admin can't create new statuses or edit existing statuses\r\n* The project admin isn't allowed to delete a status from the workflow\r\n* The project admin can create, update or delete transitions, but they can't select or update a screen used by the transition, or edit a transition's properties, conditions, validators or post-functions\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\nh3.

[See the corresponding bug report|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-62872].\n  {panel}\n\n+Issue Summary+\r\n\r\n* [Time Reports and Gadgets plugin developer/vendor, Andriy Zhdanov|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/vendors/120] has reported that they are experiencing a malfunction of the IssueLinkManager API in JIRA 7. \r\n* The problem is that issue object returned by IssueLinkManager is somewhat incorrectly initialized and is considered as SubTask, and has itself as parent issue.\r\n* Basically the observation is that the issue object is incorrectly initialized in the *IssueLinkManager API* as a subtask. Notice from screenshot of a live debugging, how linkedIssue.isSubTask() is true, while cleanLinkedIssue.isSubtask() is false for the same issue.\r\n!linkedIssue.png|thumbnail!\r\n* According to customer same code works fine in JIRA 6, and only has this behaviour from JIRA 7.x. If there's at all need to make any reference to the plugin's source code, it is available at https://bitbucket.org/azhdanov/jiratimesheet, however, since it's our java API issue I'm assuming that may not be necessary. Relevant or affected code from our API can be seen from screenshot to some extent. \r\n\r\n*Worth to mention:*\r\nBug is in the method {{IssueLinkManager#getLinkCollection}}. All outgoing issues have parameter {{parent}} set to itself.\r\nIntroduced in [this|https://stash.atlassian.com/projects/JIRA/repos/jira/pull-requests/5475/overview] PR.",

Jira did not accept these, only parts of that expression.\r\n\r\n*Actual behaviour*: Setting a biweekly trigger for a selected day of week seems to be a missing basic feature at the moment. \r\nWhen we add e.g. second and last Mondays for trigger, sometimes it takes 3 weeks sometimes 2 weeks in between. Its not acceptable.\r\n(second monday  of october is oct.10, last is october 31, that is 3 weeks, but for november the trigger would work)\r\n \r\n*Expected behaviour*: Possible scheduled issue trigger biweekly on a chosen day of week, please. Would be nice as \"Days per Biweek\" as a preset schedule.\r\n\r\nThank you!",
