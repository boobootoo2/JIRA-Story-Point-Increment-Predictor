A consistent way would be to fix it at the API level (but this may require quite sensitive work).\r\n\r\nAttached, the log on issue DDI-1784, showing that the user has attached quite a number of PDFs and JPGs (via D & D), while in the same time pressed the transition button.\r\n\r\nThe integrity checker naturally complains that:\r\n\r\n........\r\nCheck workflow current step entries\r\n   ERROR: \tDDI-1784 - The current step associated with the workflow entry with id 74133 has an incorrect stepId.\r\n........\r\n\r\n\r\nFYI, I searched the reported bugs, couldn't find anything close to it; hope it's not duplicate.

But not very convenient for use if we need to take all fields excluding Comments and Description.\r\n\r\nWe don't need those fields cause they eat too much traffic, but excluding them create enourmous GET request.\r\n\r\nWould be nice to have opposite feature\r\nexcludefield=comment&excludefield=description - return all fields excluding Comments and Description.\r\n\r\nThx",

But we will use same crowd service for this JIRA instance before migrating projects. \r\n* I need to export all projects from JIRA 4.3, then import these projects into JIRA 4.4\r\n\r\nMy questions are:\r\n\r\n* Do you have any special documentation for migrating projects from JIRA 4.3 into JIRA 4.4? Is it same process in this article? http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Restoring+a+Project+from+Backup\r\n\r\n* As the users' account and groups are considered mandatory for importing projects. As both JIRA instances are connecting to CROWD (not configured at same time).So can users'account & groups from JIRA 4.3 still be found by JIRA 4.4 via CROWD?\r\n \r\n** If no, is it possible to export DB (userbase) from JIRA 4.3 (or from CROWD?), importing into JIRA 4.4 (or into same CROWD?) with remaining same users' password?\r\n** Do you have any other way to make this work?\r\n\r\nThanks. \r\n\r\nRegards\r\n\r\nSjedi",

Is the plugin present and enabled?\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nHere's the answer from Atlassian. For more details and a discussion around this issue, see JSP-94659. \r\n\r\n{quote}\r\nHi Peter,\r\n\r\nThe error is actually due to the process JIRA uses to load functions/plugins and is harmless. Basically JIRA first loads the system required bundled-plugins, then it is followed by user-installed plugins. The error occurs between this process, before the user-installed plugins are loaded.\r\n\r\nThe Charting plugin adds multiple functionalities to JIRA, this includes adding 2 custom field types: 'First Response Time' and 'Time in Status'. This means that it is necessary for the plugin classes to be loaded for these customfield types to work. So basically when you restart JIRA, it will load the system bundled plugins and detect the customfields. This is where JIRA sees these customfields, but cannot match it with an associated class. After this, the user-plugins loads, aka the Charting Plugin and its classes, and everything works fine.\r\n\r\nSo in short, the error is thrown due to the startup procedures taken by JIRA. This is a harmless error.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nDavid Chan\r\nAtlassian Support\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nEven though the suggestion is to ignore it, it is still an error and proper care should be taken of this. Unfortunately, as long as errors are logged, they should be addressed -- and not ignored. ",

Notes\r\n* JIRA ships with wstx-asl-3.2.4.jar (Woodstox) in {{WEB-INF/lib}}. This JAR registers itself with the JVM to provide implementations of XMLInputFactory, XMLOutputFactory and XMLEventFactory from its {{META-INF.services}}. Basically, once we put this JAR in {{WEB-INF/lib}} we end up with com.ctc.wstx.stax.WstxInputFactory, com.ctc.wstx.stax.WstxOutputFactory and com.ctc.wstx.stax.WstxEventFactory being the default implementations of these classes.\r\n* The problem is that we don't expose the wstx-asl-3.2.4.jar classes to plugins even though we expose its {{META-INF.services}} (we boot delegate META-INF.services)).\r\n* The solution *is NOT* to simply add the wstx-asl to the packages that we expose to plugins (what happens we change the JAR and replace with a different implementation?). \r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\nCurrently there is no known workaround for this behavior. A workaround will be added here when available",

[See the corresponding bug report|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-26208].\n  {panel}\n\nh3. Summary\r\nThere is currently no method to prevent sub-task creation on a specific workflow status.\r\n\r\nThe following Workflow Properties have no effect on users being able to create sub-tasks.\r\n* {{jira.permission.create}}\r\n* {{jira.permission.subtasks.create}}\r\n\r\nAdministrators are unable prevent users from creating Sub-tasks with this current bug. When viewing an issue in the state where that permission _should_ be locked down, there is still an option for creating a sub-task.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\nJIRA 6.3 was used to replicate this issue:\r\n\r\n# Open the Workflow Editor (\"Administration -> Projects -> <SELECTED-PROJECT> -> Workflow -> Edit)\r\n# Add the following Workflow Properties to one of the steps: \r\n* {{jira.permission.create}} and set to {{denied}}\r\n* {{jira.permission.subtasks.create}} and set to {{denied}}\r\n# Publish the edited workflow\r\n# Create a new issue for <SELECTED-PROJECT> and transition to the edited Step (Issue Status).\r\n# Attempt to create a new \"Sub-task\" for the issue. Observe that the user is able to do so.\r\n# Observe that this \"Sub-Task\" is created and linked to the issue.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nThe workflow property should have prevented the Sub-Task from being created.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nThe workflow property had no effect on the User's ability to create a new Sub-Task.\r\n\r\nh3. Notes\r\n* Attached Screenshots for all windows showing the settings applied when demonstrating this issue. (JIRA 4.4)\r\n* Specifically: One of the permissions is the Create permission, which was denied to everyone.\r\n* When viewing an issue in the state where that permission should be locked down, there is still the option for creating a sub-task.\r\n* User was able to click on \"Create Sub-Task\" and create a sub-task which looks fine and shows that it is a sub-task of the parent issue.  However, when you go back to the parent issue, you do not see any sub-tasks for that issue. (JIRA 4.4)\r\n* The last part of the parent not knowing of it's sub-tasks is not very important because the first part of a sub-task still being able to be created shouldn't even be available or allowed based on the permissions that i set in the state of the workflow. (JIRA 4.4)\r\n* [JRA-10077|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRA-10077] - Mentions a suggestion to refactor some of the permissions relating sub-task creation.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\nIn some circumstances users can prevent all edits to an issue at a specific workflow status:\r\n# Edit the project Workflow, as per: [Configuring Workflow|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA063/Configuring+Workflow]\r\n# Click \"View Properties\" for the targeted step.\r\n# Add a new property {{jira.issue.editable}} with value {{false}} (as per [Workflow properties|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA063/Workflow+properties])\r\n# Publish the edited workflow.\r\n\r\nThis will prevent *all* edits being made to an issue when at the defined state. The workaround can be used to prevent the user from creating sub-tasks on closed or resolved issues.",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-26175].\n  {panel}\n\n    Jira uses binary ordering for the project name instead of using better alphabetical order even if the database is set otherwise. For example in Oracle we set our database so that NLS_SORT is French. This causes the database to not make the difference between accentuated letters and non accentuated ones. This means that an \"\u00c9\" is like an \"E\".\r\n\r\n    This means that if you have the following project names : \"Assurance\", \"Cadre de gestion\", \"Engagement\", \"\u00c9valuation\" and \"Suivi des dossiers\", the order written before is the good one. But Jira will write \"\u00c9valuation\" as the last one. Since we have around 30 projects it's annoying that the \"\u00c9valuation\" project does not appear where it belongs in the alphabetical order.\r\n\r\n    This happens in all the place where projects are listed, i.e. the create issues screen, the project list page, in the project gadget, etc.\r\n\r\n    Jira should rely on the order set by the database or have a parameter to set the way Jira works.\r\n\r\n\r\n    I've contacted customer support, who told me to open an improvement request. If you want to see the support ticket it's JSP-95853.\r\n\r\n    I also included a screenshot that shows the top and the bottom of the project list. You will see the \"\u00c9valuation financi\u00e8re des conditions de travail\" project at the end of the list instead of before the \"Formulaire d'admissibilit\u00e9 44/48\" project.\r\n\r\n",

Install the bic plugin (it's a type 2 plugin) - Please see the README.txt found in the sources archive\r\n2. Create a workflow scheme \"WF-SCHEME-STRESS-TEST\" (*)\r\n3. Create transition \"Create other issue\" and set the issue creation postfunction on this transition (*)\r\n4. Start JMeter and load the stress test project.\r\n5. Execute it.\r\n\r\n(*) You can easily import in a JIRA instance the xml dump we used for test (jira_4.3.4_lock_problem.zip).\r\n\r\nOutput with the problem:\r\n(SQL Exception while executing the following:UPDATE project SET pcounter=? WHERE ID=? (Lock wait timeout exceeded; try restarting transaction))\r\n        at org.ofbiz.core.entity.GenericDAO.singleUpdate(GenericDAO.java:253)\r\n        at org.ofbiz.core.entity.GenericDAO.singleStore(GenericDAO.java:300)\r\n        at org.ofbiz.core.entity.GenericDAO.storeAll(GenericDAO.java:318)\r\n        at org.ofbiz.core.entity.GenericHelperDAO.storeAll(GenericHelperDAO.java:221)\r\n................................\r\n\r\n\r\nRelated to: support issues: JSP-93481 and JSP-93314\r\n\r\nNote 1: Our temporary workaround was to create the issue on another thread. However, I cannot wait for that thread to finish in the original post-function because I will run into the same problem. On the other hand, I also cannot always create the issue independently because I will need its id in the 'originating' issue for further processing.\r\nNote 2: Please do not say it's our fault (unless we have made a HUGE mistake :) ). To preserve consistency, I must use your API, so I'm kinda constrained to it (I do not want to go directly on the database). Please notify us if you think your API is not used correctly.\r\nNote 3: IMHO, the update \"UPDATE project SET pcounter=? WHERE ID=?\" can be avoided. This will boost a bit the performance at issue creation. Use the reservation technique, similar with what Oracle does on sequences. In this matter, you are already greatly helped by the fact that you cannot cluster Jira (but a similar solution should be used when you finally decide to make it cluster aware).",
