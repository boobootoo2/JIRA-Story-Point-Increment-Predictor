This would help engineers and PMs to quickly prioritize. Currently we can't tell the difference between P2 and P3s without navigating out of the epic or clicking into the defect which is time consuming when we have 10+ bugs. This has come up multiple times in multiple standups so I figured it was worth reporting. Thanks!",

I really don't think a single, rigid format is sufficient.\n\nIdeally these should all be handled the same, for example:\n* 8/30/16 4:30 pm (this is the one that works in our setup)\n* 8/30/16 4:30pm\n* 8/30/16 4:30p\n* 8/30/16 16:30\n* 8/30/16 1630\n\nPerhaps it could just reuse the existing date format, with an option for smarter time parsing?\n\nThe date portion is less critical I think (since the picker for this is intuitive), but it would still be nice if you could enter 8/30 and it would assume the current year.",

There are many groups of projects with same character, therefore they have got same request types configuration.\n\nWe would like to have ability to define request type scheme, and share it for multiple projects. Same as Issue Type Scheme, Screen Schemes,...\n\nHowever, some projects are isolated. And, their PM would like to have an access to the request type configuration.\n\nTherefore I suggest, that it would be possible to define request type scheme, which would work in two modes:\n * *project local request type scheme* - users with permission to administer project (project manager, project administrator) should be able to modify the request type scheme\n * *shared request type scheme* - only JIRA administrators have the ability to modify these request type scheme",

An example:\n\n{quote}\ncolor: Color value is invalid\n\nHello,\ncolor: Color value is invalid\ncolor: Color value is invalid\n\nCan you guys please take a look at this and that?\ncolor: Color value is invalid\n\nIf you need some help, just let me know!\ncolor: Color value is invalid\ncolor: Color value is invalid\n\nBest regards,\nDennis\n{quote}\n\nThese errors are outputted the same as the content: same size, same color so they are essentially part of the body. Why these errors have to be shown here, I don't know. In my opinion they do not add anything useful and makes working with JSD a lot more impractical.\n\nAtlassian support recommended to change the renderer to \"Default Text Renderer\" but this results in seeing the raw wiki code instead, including all the color tags. \n\nIf one provides an incorrect color (as there is no validation) in Confluence its simply shown in the default color (black). However, JSD outputs all errors in the body, where it shouldn't be.\n\nPlease hide these errors from the description.",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSDSERVER-4239].\n  {panel}\n\nh3. Problem Definition\n\nAs per the [JIRA Service Desk 3.2.x Release Notes|https://confluence.atlassian.com/servicedesk/jira-service-desk-3-2-x-release-notes-830281732.html], it is currently not possible to upgrade directly from JIRA 6.4.x and Service Desk 2.5.9 to JIRA Core 7.2.x with JIRA Service Desk 3.2.x. Hence, customers running on JIRA 6.4.x will have to *upgrade twice, increasing their downtime* and also the upgrade effort to go to JIRA 7.2.x and JSD 3.2.x.\nh3. Suggested Solution\n\nAs a JIRA administrator, I would like to be able to upgrade from JIRA 6.4.x and JSD 2.5.9 to JIRA 7.2 and JIRA Service Desk 3.2 directly so that I can perform a single upgrade.\n\nh3. Workaround\n\nThe following [jira-config.properties|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/AdminJIRAServer070/Advanced+JIRA+application+configuration#AdvancedJIRAapplicationconfiguration-jira-config.propertiesThejira-config.propertiesfile] parameters can be used when upgrading from JIRA 6.4 to 7.0 and Service Desk 3.0:\n{code}\njira.upgrade.force.manual.schedule=true\njira.autoexport=false\n{code}\n\nThis will cause the intermediate upgrade path ( JIRA 6.4 -> JIRA 7.0 -> JIRA 7.2 ) to occur much faster as JIRA performs an export and re-index normally as part of the upgrade which takes a long time in larger environments and is unnecessary for intermediate upgrade versions. These parameters can be removed when upgrading JIRA 7 to JIRA 7.2",

[See the corresponding bug report|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSDSERVER-4182].\n  {panel}\n\nh3. Summary\n\nThe 'resolution' field is not indexed by JIRA when hidden. This has two main consequences in Service Desk reports:\n# The 'resolved' series in reports, such as Created vs Resolved don't show issues in this case\n# If an issue is resolved while the resolution is hidden, if we change it to 'show', these issues are not shown in report as resolved, unless system is re-indexed\n\nh3. Environment\nVersion: 3.3.0-OD-1000.212.0\n\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\n# Create an SD project\n# Make resolution hidden in Fields Configuration\n# Create tickets and resolve them\n# Check Created vs Resolved reports\n# Make resolution visible again \n# Check Created vs Resolved reports\n\nh3. Expected Results\nThe resolve tickets show in report both in steps 4 and 6.\n\nh3. Actual Results\nBoth won't show any resolved issues. \n \nh3. Notes\nThere's a similar bug [here|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRA-38224]. \n\nNotice that you resolve a ticket *before hiding the field*, hide it and show it again, the ticket will show once the field is not hidden. That's probably because it was indexed by resolution, since it was visible when the ticket was resolved.\n\nOn the other hand, if you resolve the ticket *while the field is hidden*, it won't show unless you run a re-index.\n\nAlso, re-indexing while the field is hidden is useless and may just remove the existing indices for tickets created before it was hidden.\n\nh3.Workaround\nIf you need to see the field in reports:\n# Make it visible again\n# Lock JIRA and re-index\n# Keep it visible (otherwise, the problem will occur again)\n# If you don't want users to see/edit this field, simply remove it from screens (Created/View/Edit)",

Problem Definition\n\nYou can change Issue Types in JIRA using the *Move* function in the issue screen. When you use this function to move Service Desk issues, then the request type is lost when you change the Issue Type in the move.\n\nThe workaround would be that to set the request type right after the move in the issue view by editing the request type field inline.

Just as well each customer has different SLA and KPI and the JSD features are perfect for tracking this.  Therefore would like to know if JSD would consider separating SLA breach tracking into a separate module that can priced differently (perhaps similar to tempo plugins).\n\nI understand that I could purchase JSD and have all my engineers and the customers acting as agents, but the pricing for that is just too high.

Expected Results\n # Queues are created\n\nh3. Actual Results\n\nNo Queue is created. In Basic projects, the errors mentioned before are shown.\nh3. Partial Workaround\n\n*This workaround will make you project be entirely in English*\n # Change 'Default Language' to English\n # Create the project\n # Change it back to Spanish/German\n\nh3. Workaround (JIRA Server Only)\n\nA file inside of the JIRA Service Desk .obr file must be modified.

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSDSERVER-4150].\n  {panel}\n\n*Background*\n\n1. We use JIRA and Service Desk.\n 2. For each client we have an internal JIRA project and an external Service Desk project.\n 3. JIRA issues and Service Desk requests display on an internal Kanban board.\n 4. Both JIRA and Service Desk use matching workflow.\n\n*Problem*\n\nFor our Service Desk projects, *designers* and *developers* are Service Desk Agents because the Service Team Member role is too\u00a0restricted. Specifically, these internal staff members can't:\n\n1. Update the Assignee field\n 2. Transition issues through the workflow (even through\u00a0customers can do this)\n\nHaving so many Service Desk Agents is expensive and was not our intended outcome when we set up Service Desk.\u00a0\n\n*Workaround*\n\nThe workaround offered by Atlasssian support is to create a linked JIRA issue for each relevant Service Desk request. This is not acceptable as it creates duplicate issues and we will mess with time-tracking.\n\n*Desire outcome*\n\nExtend the Service Team Member permissions to include the following items:\n\n1. Ability to update the assignee field\n 2. Ability to transition an issue through a workflow",

Automation doesn't currently allow for auto assignment based on the from e-mail reply of an agent. \n\nh3. Suggested Solution\nBuild automation feature to evaluate e-mail replies and auto assign to agents. \n\nh3. Workaround \n# Create statuses for each agent. \n# Create transition from waiting for support to each agent status (i.e. Agent1, Agent2, Agent3). \n# Create automation rules for each agent that transitions the issue to each agent status based on a specific value (i.e. #agent1 #agent2 #agent3)\n# Create post function that auto assigns agent for each transition to agent status. \n# For each request type be sure to rename Agent statuses to \"Waiting for customer\"\n\nAlthough you now have different statuses that would replace \"Waiting for customer\" status. From the customers perspective it will appear as Waiting for customer. \n\nReferences: \n\n- [Customize status for request type for reference|https://confluence.atlassian.com/servicedeskcloud/configuring-request-types-and-workflows-732528910.html#Configuringrequesttypesandworkflows-CustomizingWorkflowCustomizetheworkflowstatusesforarequesttype]\n- [Configuring Workflows|https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiracloud/working-with-workflows-776636540.html]\n- [Automating your Service Desk|https://confluence.atlassian.com/servicedeskcloud/automating-your-service-desk-732528900.html]\n",
