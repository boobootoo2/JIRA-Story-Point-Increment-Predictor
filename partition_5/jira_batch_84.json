      "description": " Hi,\r\nI'd like to suggest two enhancements for sourcetree for windows\r\n\r\n1. <search> functionality in git history\r\n\r\nVery often I need to retrieve something I have done in the past whether by commit id, or simple keywords. Sourcetree doesn't provide this functionality and I believe this is a loss because it would be a very very simple and powerful tool to have. A simple textbox search box at the top right corner of the <log/history> tab would do.\r\na. Search by commit id\r\nb. Search by keyword\r\nc. Search by author\r\n\r\n2. <search text> functionality in blame and file log\r\n\r\nWhen I go in blame or file log, very often, it is to look at a specific class method change. If the file I'm looking at is really big, it can take a little while to find what I'm looking for. So having also a search box would be a very convenient tool to have.\r\n\r\nThis suggestions are not product essential I agree, but these little tools is what makes the difference between a frustrating and nice use experience.\r\n\r\nAnd to finish on a good note, I've been evaluating the sourcetree software for a few months now and find it really powerful. Not necessarily intuitive in every aspects, but powerful and flexible enough to make a really good tool for git. Congratulations.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nJulien ",

Now it will say \"Displaying all changes between x and y\", seems good right?\r\nAt first I didn't see the path for the patch file. So when clicking \"Create Patch\" I expected a popup window to ask me where to save it.\r\n\r\nAfter I found the patch.diff in the root directory of the repository, it only listed one change to one file.\r\nI went back to the Create Patch window and found out you had to highlight all the changesets you wanted included in the patch.\r\nOkay, Ctrl-A works in this field so let's generate the patch again.\r\n\r\nAnd now here's a bug. For some reason *only* the changesets of the first and last commit I selected are included in the patch.\r\nFunny thing is that the first selected commit is actually not displayed in the patch changesets window (since it calculates the *difference* between the changesets x and y).\r\n",

This forces me to use an alternate Hg software to dig up the history.\r\n\r\nSecond, my request is that when launching the external merge tool, automatically two windows should be launched showing the commit history in each branch. Just as shown in the attached picture.\r\n\r\nIdeally, ST would remember the positioning of each window, so that every time I move on to the next file, the log windows maintain their layout (which is very useful for those using multi monitor setups + Windows' advanced window positioning system)\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the per-file log history is missing:\r\n * A column telling which branch the commit is from.\r\n * A dropdown menu to filter to a particular branch\r\n\r\nThe attached png was composited in GIMP (The merge tool is showing a different file though, it should be showing the same file in all 3 windows, you get the idea).\r\n\r\nSomething like this would greatly enhance the merging experience.\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\nMatias",

      "description": "I have two related branches A and B. When a file X (which existed in both branches) was removed in branch A and I merge A into B, then the file X is marked as conflict. When selecting the file in SourceTree the diff view is empty and it says that there are no modifications. There is no indication whatsoever that this file was removed in one of the branches.\r\n\r\nIf I open the git bash and do a git status I clearly see that the file was deleted and in which branch. So git knows about this. It would be nice if this information would also be visible in the SourceTree UI.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, when resolving the conflict by chosing \"Resolve using theirs\" (theirs being branch A where the file was originally deleted) the conflict is just cleared and the file disappears from the index. This has the effect that committing this merge does not delete the file but keeps it. I would have expected that chosing theirs would instead mark the file as to-be-removed (and shows it as this in the index) because it was removed in that branch.\r\n\r\nSo in order to handle deleted files correctly during a merge I currently have to run git status in parallel to identify deleted files and then manually click Remove in SourceTree instead of resolving/merging the conflict. This is very inconvenient and error prone.",

We are currently provisioning all our dev tools (100+) on those machines using Puppet so that our developers spend their time on coding rather than configuring.\r\n\r\nWe are currenlty stuck with the SourceTree install automation. Even though we managed to make the installation work silently and into the desired folder, the product still needs some configuration (git.exe, email, Mercurial option, putty, license, etc.) upon first launch.\r\nWould it be possible to specify those options during the installation process - or a file somewhere where we could set them post-install ?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nNicolas\r\n",

      "description": "hi\r\n\r\nWe are paid Stash users, and love this tool with its high integrated to support Stash.\r\n\r\nBut we cannot use this tool during our production environment. It seems when building a project with sourceTree GUI opened, the whole Windows OS become extremely slow and lagged to further response any actions( I called this as the \"disaster\"). Once this happen, I had been patient to see if the situation could recover. with almost 10 minutes passed, the computer was still not responding to me. (normally an expecting time for an incremental build would last for 10~ seconds.) Then I had to reset my laptop by pushing power buttom for 6 seconds, with tears.....)\r\n\r\nOur environment is mingw32 with some private C compiler from silicon vendor.\r\n\r\nSeveral clues:\r\n1. this only happen when sourceTree GUI was opened in background. \r\n2. during the disaster, the hard disk access indicator (the LED on my laptop) always kept lighting.  \r\n3. the app (and other app windows actions) are so slow, that I cannot close sourcetree or switch to windows task manager to watch(or kill) any other suspected processes.\r\n4. the git repository have added .gitignore witih well defined policy that all built files have been ignored. \r\n5. I disabled \"Refresh automatically when files change\" in sourceTree according to SRCTREEWIN-760. but this issue is still randomly appeared with a frequency one per dozens builds. or say, I can meet this issue everyday with sourcetree.\r\n6. this issue appreared since v1.0.x\r\n\r\nI understand I reported some  issue with unclear description. Could you please advice if any actions that I could take?\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nAlan",

Unfortunately I did this using my own username password credentials.\r\n\r\nA week ago I had to change my passwords.  Immediately I then would have to reenter the CAPTCHA in Stash every few minutes to continue working in SourceTree.  Finally figured out that in just the browser on logout/login I would have to reenter the CAPTCHA every few minutes as well.\r\n\r\nThose machines I had used my credentials on were still polling using those credentials causing the CAPTCHA flag to get thrown on my account in Stash.  The developers using those machines were unaware that this was even going on since they were not prompted for the failed password.\r\n\r\nThis literally took tracking IP numbers from the Stash log to the individual developer machines to figure out what had happened.  After about 5 other possible resolutions.  Ouch.\r\n\r\nWould be awesome if you could make it prompt for the password on background login attempts.  *Thanks!*",
