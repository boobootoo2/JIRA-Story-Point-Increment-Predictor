      "description": "Issue Summary\r\n Adding Jira Issues Dates event types to Team Calendars is extremely non performant, and can cause outages by consuming threads that can take hours to return. It causes high CPU on the processing nodes which can also result in performance impacts and system outages, as system resources cannot be used to respond to other requests.\r\n\r\nThis issue was recently resolved in Jira Cloud by upgrading the Fortuna ical library. The issue is caused by the library creating thousands of date objects per date, and checking each against a call to the system date, to determine timezones.\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\nh4. Confluence and Jira\r\n # Create a custom field in JIRA of time Date/Time Picker.\r\n # Set this field for a few issues (5 was enough for production instance).\r\n # In Confluence open Calendars and add a new calendar\r\n # Click '...' and Add event\r\n # Select Jira Issue Dates, and the Jira project with the custom fields you set\r\n # Select some date fields including the custom field you created and submit\r\n # It will take a long time to add the events, or if the project is large they may never be added to the calendar\r\n\r\nh4. Jira only\r\n # Create a custom field in JIRA of time Date/Time Picker.\r\n # Set this field for a few issues (5 was enough for production instance).\r\n # Call {{/rest/ical/1.0/ical/config/fields?jql=project=<project_key>}} Jira endpoint to find out the custom field id (customfield_XXXXX).\r\n # Call {{/rest/ical/1.0/ical/search/jql/events.ics?jql=project+%3D+%22<project_key>%22&dateFieldName=<custom_field_id>&includeFixVersions=false&start=1598572800000&end=1609977600000&maxIssue=1000}} endpoint to retrieve a list of events in iCal format (set Jira project key, custom field id, and start/stop timestamps in parameters). Events are generated based on the value of the custom field. So make sure that this date is within the timeframe set by start and end arguments.\r\n # You will see a 20+ second delay even though the number of issues/events is small.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nRequests to Jira REST endpoints return in a timely manner.\r\nh3.

Notes\r\n\r\nCurrently we are aware of couple of problems related to *ical4j*:\r\n # High CPU load (current ticket - JRASERVER-71803)\r\n ** this is a contention due to frequent {{getProperty}} calls\r\n # Thread being blocked/stuck trying to contact [http://tzurl.org|http://tzurl.org/], this is not related to current ticket\r\n ** this is a contention in the network and there is a feature flag to prevent the call by disabling the TZ update definition (see [https://ical4j.github.io/ical4j-user-guide/timezones/] for more details), to do that:\r\n ** Set the property \"_-Dnet.fortuna.ical4j.timezone.update.enabled=false_\" on [Jira startup options|https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiraserver/setting-properties-and-options-on-startup-938847831.html].\r\n ** Restart Jira\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n * Restarting the affected nodes kills the threads and will return the system to performing normally.\r\n * * As an extreme measure, the {{/rest/ical/1.0/ical/search/jql/events.ics}} REST endpoint can be blocked at the proxy layer (or disable \"JIRA iCalendar Plugin\"). This will break Team Calendar functionality that relies on this endpoint.\r\n\r\nh3. Resolution\r\n\r\nUpgrade to Jira 8.15 once it is released.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, for Jiras on\u00a0{{8.5.10}}\u00a0and above, update {{Jira iCalendar Plugin}}\u00a0through the Universal Plugin Manager\r\n # Go to Admin > Manage Apps\r\n # Search for\u00a0{{JIRA iCalendar Plugin}}\u00a0(you may need to expand the list to All Apps)\r\n # Confirm there is an update to\u00a0{{v1.8.2}}\u00a0or above\r\n # Click Update",

Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Browse to the Issue View of any JIRA issue.\r\n # Use the Tab key to navigate to and select the 'More' menu.\r\n # Use the Down Arrow key to attempt to navigate to an option in the list below 'Attach Files.'\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nYou should be able to reach and select an option like 'Add vote,' 'Create sub-task,' etc. using your keyboard.\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nThe options below 'Attach files' are inaccessible via keyboard navigation.\r\nh3. Workaround\r\nh5. Option 1\r\nDisable the 'Attach screenshot to this issue (show-attach-screenshot-popup-button)' module under the Jira Drag and Drop Attachment Plugin in the JIRA Administration (cog icon) -> Manage apps tab -> Manage apps page.\r\n(!) You will need to filter by 'System' plugins in order to find it; as this is a built-in Atlassian plugin.\r\n(flag) This could limit endusers' options for uploading attachments easily (i.e., through drag-and-drop). \r\n\r\nh5. Option 2\r\nA customization to override this behavior has been identified using the Scriptrunner plugin:\r\n# Navigate to Manage Apps -> Script Runner -> Script Fragments\r\n# Click on Create Script Fragment and select Show a Web Panel\r\n# Select atl.jira.view.issue.right.context and enter the following code to the Provider class / script section: {code}writer.write(\"<script>\\$('#attach-screenshot-html5').attr('hidden','true'); JIRA.bind(JIRA.Events.ISSUE_REFRESHED, function (e, context, reason) { \\$('#attach-screenshot-html5').attr('hidden','true');});</script>\") {code}\r\n# Click save. \r\n\r\n(i) This resolves the navigation issue without impacting endusers' ability to drag-and-drop attachments.",

Issue Summary\r\n\r\nStarting on Jira 8.7, we can no longer edit labels if the field is removed from screens, however, +we still can reach the label's dialogue and add a label when we press the \"L\" key.+\u00a0\r\n\r\nWhile makes sense that after removing the labels field from the screen we can no longer edit it, it is still a contradiction that we can edit the same field using the short key \"L\".\u00a0\r\n\r\nReviewing the issue JRASERVER-28788, Nick Menere [Atlassian] (Inactive) added a comment - 23/Jul/2012 1:38 AM states:\r\n{quote}We aren\u2019t ignoring the setting. Any time the screen is used (except in view issue) it will only show fields defined on the screen.\r\n The problem is occurring because we calculate whether a field can be inline edited by checking if it appears on the edit screen. This is wrong for labels. It should be defined by whether they have permission to edit labels for an issue. (as it used to work).\r\n{quote}\r\nLater on, at the same issue JRASERVER-28788, David Elkan (Inactive) added a comment - 07/Aug/2012 3:41 AM explaining:\r\n{quote}I\u2019m sorry to say this however we won\u2019t be able to bring back the edit button for the Labels field unless it is in the active Edit Screen. Instead the Labels field will operate as any other field and respect the Edit Screen configuration on the View Issue page.\r\n To make the Labels field inline editable it must be added to the active Edit Screen. Also, as discussed above, you can press the \u2018L\u2019 key to bring up the Edit Labels dialog.\r\n The issue JRA-28243 will track the creation of a Knowledge Base entry to cover ways to work around this issue in future.\r\n{quote}\r\nThis was said for Jira 5.1, however, the Labels field was visible up to Jira 7.13.8, then on 8.0, it was not more visible.\r\n\r\nWhat\u2019s the indented design, shall labels be editable inline on issue views?\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Using Jira 8.0 or above, remove the Labels field from the screen used to view an issue type, for instance, bug\r\n # Create a new issue\r\n # View the issue\r\n # Hover the Labels field\r\n\r\nh3.

Issue Summary\r\n\r\nWhen doing a background reindex in Jira 8.13, it is slower than background reindex operations in older Jira versions (in this example, we used 8.8.1).\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Deploy Jira 8.13 & Jira 8.8.1\r\n # Use data generator to create 60k+ issues with ~15 comments each\r\n # Perform a lock and reindex operation on both instances (as background reindex won't be available due to the discrepancies between the jiraissue table and the index issue count)\r\n # Perform a background reindex and compare the results between them\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nThe time to complete the reindex should be similar between two Jira instances in the same product release (8 in this case).  \r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nJira 8.13 takes at least twice the time. \r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Not a bug.\r\nAfter upgrading to JIRA 8.10.0 and later, including the LTS release 8.13.0, the new background reindex process *works differently*. All index updates are checking the version of the entity in the index. This *guarantees index consistency when there are concurrent index updates*. Previously, any concurrent user actions modifying those entities would be potentially overwritten (in the index) by the old data. So a task was executed in the end of the background re-index process to try to fix that possible inconsistent index.\r\n\r\nHowever, with versioning background reindex introduced in Jira 8.10, we do a conditional update when updating the index like any other user action modifying the index. Thus we have a consistent index but with a _slightly higher cost_. This check happens for each item and during this, the index is constantly flushed to the disk.\r\n\r\nFurther information has been provided at the KB below: https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirakb/background-reindex-is-slow-after-upgrading-to-jira-8-10-and-later-1027126085.html\r\n\r\nAlso, please check JRASERVER-72196 for some improvement in this area. \r\n",

Issue Summary\r\n\r\nWhen custom POP3/IMAP servers are being used to handle the incoming mail, trying to change the password through Jira UI will result in the error message:\r\n{noformat}\r\nUnfortunately no connection was possible. Review the errors below and rectify:AuthenticationFailedException: LOGIN failed. Invalid login/password for user id <username> {noformat}\r\nIf debugging the connection from the mail server side, it can be seen that Jira submits the original password and not the new one. This makes it impossible to update the mail server password should there be a need for it.\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Setup Greenmail as a test mail server and set a user with a password:\r\n {noformat}java -Dgreenmail.setup.test.all -Dgreenmail.users=catchall:abc -Dgreenmail.verbose -jar greenmail-standalone-1.6.0.jar{noformat}\r\n # Configure POP3 or IMAP server in Jira pointing to Greenmail (host=localhost, port=3110 for POP3)\r\n# Test connection, make sure it works, save.\r\n# Try editing the connection, enable \"Change password\", and provide whatever password.

Workaround\r\n\r\nThe easiest workaround is to never rotate passwords for the mail server. If that is not possible, you can do one of the following:\r\n- Delete this mail server, and create it a new. You will need to repoint all mail handlers to the new mail server.\r\n- Update the password directly in the database, encoding it with a [base64 encoding|https://www.base64encode.org/]:\r\n{code:sql}UPDATE mailserver SET mailpassword='<base64-encoded password>' WHERE name = '<mail server name in Jira>';{code}",

There are DOMExceptions with blocked iframe, however the domain is the same on the base URL and the resources failing to load. \r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nYou have to have an iframe present on the page. eg. go to https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiraserver/configuring-an-announcement-banner-938846985.html and add \r\n{code}\r\n<iframe id=\"cross-origin-iframe\" style=\"height: 200px;\" src=\"http://example.com\"></iframe>\r\n{code}\r\nThen go to pages listed below and trigger error.\r\n\r\nA few examples where this problem occurs:\r\n\r\n# in Admin UI, click on a Manage Permissions - Edit link, or Grant Permissions button\r\n# on Sprints page, click on Start Sprint button\r\n# JSD ticket image attachment functionality and the ability to edit comments on JSD tickets.\r\n\r\nh3.

For example, this is currently used by Slack and Zoom to create user accounts when a new user is created, and to deprovision accounts when the user account is disabled or deleted.\r\n\r\nThe System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) specification is designed to make managing user identities in cloud-based applications and services easier. The specification suite seeks to build upon experience with existing schemas and deployments, placing specific emphasis on simplicity of development and integration, while applying existing authentication, authorization, and privacy models. Its intent is to reduce the cost and complexity of user management operations by providing a common user schema and extension model, as well as binding documents to provide patterns for exchanging this schema using standard protocols. In essence: make it fast, cheap, and easy to move users in to, out of, and around the cloud.\r\nMore details can be found at http://www.simplecloud.info/\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\nSupport SCIM 2.0 implementation in Jira as a server. \r\n \r\nh3. Workaround \r\nUse 3rd party Apps which implement this. ",

Issue Summary\r\n\r\nWhen removing an Issue Type from an Issue Type Scheme, Jira will need to perform a migration task for all issues of that Issue Type in the Projects that use that Issue Type Scheme.\r\n\r\nAs of Jira 8.0.0, it is possible to archive specific issues in a Data Center environment, per [Archiving an issue|https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiraserver/archiving-an-issue-968669980.html], which prevents them from being searchable and edited.\r\n\r\nWhen an Issue Type is removed from an Issue Type Scheme, and there are *archived* issues of that Issue Type in a project that uses that Issue Type Scheme, the entire migration will fail, as *archived* issues cannot be edited, and thus cannot be migrated to a different issue type.\r\n\r\nHowever, the administrator will receive an unhelpful error that does not explain that the root cause of the migration failure is due to an archived issue, and instead receives the following message:\r\n{quote}You do not have the correct permissions to move the issues from project Software for issue type Bug{quote}\r\n !image-2020-10-23-14-22-05-234.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# In any project, archive an issue. Note that issue's Issue Type.\r\n# Attempt to remove that Issue Type from the Issue Type Scheme for the project\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nA clear error explaining that archived issues exist for the Issue Type being moved is shown.\r\n\r\nh3.

Workaround\r\n\r\nSince there are no project permissions that can control someones ability to move only issues of *specific* issue types, if the administrator can verify that they have the ability to migrate *other* issue types and just not certain affected ones, then it is likely that archived issues are the culprit. They may then unarchive the issues in order to proceed.",

However manually duplicating the list of groups a user belongs to in a custom G suite attribute is a lot of overhead when we consider doing this for hundreds of users. It's also error prone (groups have to be typed in, not selected from a list when adding to the custom attribute) and is also a security risk (eg: not removing the group name from the custom attribute when the user's been removed from the Google group could result in a user still having access to resources they're not supposed to have access to). We also reached out to Google to see whether there's a way to fetch the actual Google groups as an attribute, however they said it's not possible at this time and that the application needs to fetch the group information using the Directory API (please see here: https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/directory/v1/reference/groups/list). Is supporting G Suite as an IdP in the SSO settings using this mechanism something we can request as a feature?",
