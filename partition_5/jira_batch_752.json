Tempo does not convert the date and time you enter to your server TZ before saving it to the database; JIRA does.  When work is logged with Tempo, JIRA\u2019s worklog tab converts the worklog dates \u201cback\u201d to the user TZ with those results.\"\r\n\r\nMy company uses Tempo, as we find the timesheets very handy for seeing what team members need to log their time, and where each team spent their time each week.\r\n\r\nOur JIRA is hosted in UTC-4, we have offices in UTC-8, UTC and UTC+8, so we are noticing that our Burndown charts and other reports are not accurate due to the way Tempo logs time.\r\n\r\nTempo have stated (on the link above) \"Unfortunately we have not had much luck with Atlassian on this matter. We are still pushing it, and hope to resolve this soon.\"\r\n\r\nI can't find any JIRA-XXXXX task or bug to reflect this so I would like to raised this as a customer, as it has been as issue for almost a year now from what I can see - we are not receiving clear feedback from Tempo on this.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if I should raise this elsewhere.

Please contact the Publisher for more information._\r\n\r\nAdditionally, it may display a SecurityException, causing the screenshot functionality to fail.\r\n\r\nh5.

Resolution\r\n\r\nThis has been fixed in JIRA 6.1.7, and will also be included in JIRA 6.2.\r\n\r\nh5. Workaround\r\n\r\nThe following workaround is available for customers on older versions of JIRA as an interim measure until an upgrade is performed:\r\n\r\n# Download the attached screenshot.jar file.\r\n# Replace the existing file in {{<jira-install>/atlassian-jira/secure/applet}}.\r\n# Restart JIRA.\r\n\r\n*Important*: Please make sure to test these changes in a staging/test environment before doing it in the production system. \r\n\r\nWe have internally tested the workaround against JIRA 4.4.5, 5.0.7,5.1.8,5.2.11,6.0.8, 6.1.6 and no problems observed.\r\n_Please note that under jira 4.x The screenshot applet window will not close upon attaching the issue due to a javascript error.

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-35469].\n  {panel}\n\nEdit: Sorry, the previous description was technically incorrect. I have updated this with a better one.\r\n---------------------------------\r\n\r\nCurrently the user name picker only matches the beginning letters of a whole word. For example, you can find \"John Smith\" by typing \"Jo\" or \"Sm\", but not \"th\" even though \"th\" is a part of \"Smith\". This is not a problem with Western names.\r\n\r\nThis, however, doesn't work well with East Asian names (Chinese, Japanese, Korean) in which the family name and given name are not separated by spaces. For example, if there's a person with family name \"\u5f20\" and given name \"\u65e0\u5fcc\", the full name appears as \"\u5f20\u65e0\u5fcc\". Now you can't find this person in the user name picker by just typing his given name \"\u65e0\u5fcc\". You must type \"\u5f20\" to find him.\r\n\r\nAs a workaround, we have to add a white space into the user name and make it look like \"\u5f20 \u65e0\u5fcc\". This makes it searchable, but is against the language. The extra white space also looks really weird when appearing in sentences which doesn't have word separators at all.",

Please contact your administrator to make sure that Notify Hipchat post-function is the last in the list.\r\n\r\nI had to click on the down arrow 7 times to get it to the bottom of the list, and didn't see an easier way to move it around.  Would be nice if they could be reordered more simply or allow the user to enter the position in the list.\r\n\r\nBest case would be to automatically optimize the order.  In this case, the error indicates that you know what the problem is, so might be possible to just correct it.",
