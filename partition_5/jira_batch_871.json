We want to use JIRA as one source of issue management tool within our development group. So I would like JIRA to integrate with the following tools:\r\n\r\n(1) Quality Center (HP)\r\n(2) BMC Remedy\r\n(3) CA Clarity\r\n\r\nI know there are tools to integrate with Quality Center. I am not sure about the other two.\r\n\r\nAre there tools to do that. Basically if one group creates an issue in Quality Center, it should automatically be routed to the developer in JIRA. All the tools share the NT authentication.\r\n\r\nI would also like to know what are the best ways to integrate with Share point servers.\r\n\r\nAny help in this regard will be greatly appreciated.\r\n",

A sub-task generates an entirely new Jira number. So, for example, I am being queried about Jira XXX-48197 - which means nothing to me, and it's not on any of my personal lists of \"what I'm doing with Jira.\" I have to go look it up, and it turns out it's a sub-task of XXX-47931. Now, 47931 means something to me. But its sub-task numbers and titles certainly do not.\r\n\r\nThis gets very cumbersome and confusing with multiple sub-tasks on multiple tickets.\r\n\r\nCouldn't the Jira system assign sub-tasks sequential identifiers of some sort, like XXX-47931c....which would tell me this was the 3rd sub-task associated w/Jjira 47931? Or XXX-47931-2, which would mean the 2nd sub-task associated w/ Jira 47931? Or really anything so the originator can look at the deluge of emails and say, \"Ummmm...okay. All 22 of these emails apply to my one ticket. What's going on w/it?\"\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nOur users also noticed that subtask e-mails do not contain parent task number it their subjects and bodies. Including the parent task number in sub-task e-mails will make it easy for user to seach for all parent task's sub-tasks.",

The Notes application will create remote JIRA tickets, and we'd like to know if there's a way to retrieve the list of options for selectable fields (Select List, Multi Select and Components) through the RPC API. I've been browsing through the Atlassian forums and the web, but haven't had luck with finding any info so far.\r\n\r\nAny input will be greatly appreciated. I set the Priority to 'Critical' because we really need to sort this out in order to successfully implement our interface.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!!!",

An unintended side effect of this implementation is that linefeeds are stripped from short descriptions, which can severely impact their legibility.\r\n\r\nThe \"smart twixie\" has some edge cases which make it appear inconsistent - if we show the linefeeds but hide the twixie, then we can have a \"long\" description without a twixie in some places but not others.  If we add a twixie for any description with a linefeed, then we have some short descriptions with twixies and some without.\r\n\r\nThe latter solution is preferable, because it maintains behaviour with a description that starts with several linefeeds and then continues for >255 characters.  \r\n\r\nA very low-risk solution might be to remove the \"smart twixie\" implementation altogether, and go back to showing a twixie regardless of the length of the description field.
