Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Generate an XML backup by navigating to *Cog Icon > System > Backup system.*\r\n# Place the generated zip file inside {{JIRA_HOME/import}} and unzip it in order to expose the files {{entities.xml}} and {{activeobjects.xml}}.\r\n# Navigate to *Cog Icon > System > Restore system* and fill in the value *{{entities.xml}}* for the field *File name*.\r\n# Click *Restore*.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nJira should only accept a zip file containing both {{entities.xml}} and {{activeobjects.xml}}, aborting the process if a different file type is specified.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nJira will only import the entities in the provided file, and nothing else. ActiveObjects import will be completely skipped.\r\n\r\nThis will cause all information stored in AO tables to not be imported.

Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nI found 2 distinct situations in which the line breaks vanish in the preformatted box:\r\n # HTML content. That means when you copy some content and it goes as HTML content to the clipboard. It happens on Word, Visual Studio, Web browsers... anything that keeps the formatting over the clipboard.\r\n # When there is\u00a0*more than one line break with carriage return in a row*, it removes all of them instead of at least leaving one behind. This applies to Windows notepad, putty, and so on.\r\nOn Mac, for example, it's common to have only line breaks without the carriage returns, and it removes\u00a0_only_\u00a0the several in a row, leaving one behind.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nIn all cases, the text paste should behave in the same way.\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nDepending on the text line breaks form, it behaves differently.\r\n\r\nFor example, let's take the text:\r\n{noformat}\r\n        <name>Issue Comment Deleted</name>\r\n        <template>issueupdated.vm</template>\r\n\r\n\r\n        <templatetype>issueevent</templatetype>\r\n    </templatemapping>\r\n{noformat}\r\nIf it has only line feeds, and it's copied to the preformatted box, we get the expected result:\r\n{noformat}\r\n        <name>Issue Comment Deleted</name>\r\n        <template>issueupdated.vm</template>\r\n        <templatetype>issueevent</templatetype>\r\n    </templatemapping>{noformat}\r\nIf it uses line feed+ carriage return, we get an extra line break removed:\r\n{noformat}\r\n        <name>Issue Comment Deleted</name>\r\n        <template>issueupdated.vm</template><templatetype>issueevent</templatetype>\r\n    </templatemapping>{noformat}\r\nIf copied from Visual Studio Code, or any browser that does it in HTML in the clipboard:\r\n{noformat}\r\n        <name>Issue Comment Deleted</name>        <template>issueupdated.vm</template>\r\n\r\n        <templatetype>issueevent</templatetype>    </templatemapping>{noformat}\r\nh3.

Steps to reproduce\r\n - Create 2 Jira projects using different Issue Type Schemes. For example:\r\n -- 1 project only has 1 issue type (Bug) -> let's call this project \"Awesome\"\r\n -- 1 project only has 1 issue type (Story) -> let's call this project \"Awesomeness\"\r\n - Go to the page *\u2699 > System > Incoming Mails*\r\n - Configure a Mail Server (POP or IMAP)\r\n - Click on the *Add incoming mail handler* button to create a new mail handler\r\n - Select the type *Create a new issue or add a comment to an existing issue*, and click on the *Next* button\r\n - Select the project \"Awesome\" and the issue type \"Bug\"\r\n !Step1.png|thumbnail!\r\n - Change the project from \"Awesome\" to \"Awesomeness\"\r\n -- (!) Notice that the issue type field is now empty, because the \"Bug\" issue type does not exist in the project \"Awesomeness\"\r\n !Step2.png|thumbnail!\r\n - Click on the *Add* button to save this mail handler (with an empty issue type)\r\n -- (!) Notice that the mail handler was created with the Project \"Awesomeness\" and the issue type \"Bug\" *which does not exist in this project\r\n !Step3.png|thumbnail!\r\n - Click on the *Edit* button next to this mail handler\r\n - Click on the *Next* button to edit the configuration of this mail handler\r\n\r\nh3. Expected behavior\r\n\r\nWe should be redirected to the page that allows us to configure various settings such as Project, Issue Type, Strip Quotes, Catch Email Address, etc...\r\nh3. Actual behavior\r\n - We are redirected to the page *\u2699 > System > Incoming Mail* and the screen is frozen/greyed\r\n - The only way to get out of this page is to hit the *Esc* key\r\n - The following error is displayed in the Browse Console logs\r\n{code:java}\r\nUncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'get' of undefined\r\n    at d.setSelectedId (batch.js?agile_global_admin_condition=true&healthcheck-resources=true&jag=true&jaguser=true&locale=en-US:33)\r\n    at d.changeSelected (batch.js?agile_global_admin_condition=true&healthcheck-resources=true&jag=true&jaguser=true&locale=en-US:39)\r\n    at HTMLSelectElement.dispatch (batch.js?locale=en-US:44)\r\n    at HTMLSelectElement.v.handle (batch.js?locale=en-US:44)\r\n    at Object.trigger (batch.js?locale=en-US:44)\r\n    at Object.c.event.trigger (batch.js?locale=en-US:64)\r\n    at HTMLSelectElement.<anonymous> (batch.js?locale=en-US:44)\r\n    at Function.each (batch.js?locale=en-US:33)\r\n    at c.fn.init.each (batch.js?locale=en-US:29)\r\n    at c.fn.init.trigger (batch.js?locale=en-US:44)\r\n{code}\r\n!Step4.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nh3.

      "description": "We have various Jira instances - production, staging, UAT. They all have different base urls. And also different header colors to make it easy to tell them apart. Making changes in a prod Jira when you thought it was staging is not good.\r\n\r\nAs I was using the Jira Server mobile app I realized that the only way you can tell which Jira instance you are connected to is to look at the Settings gear, where the Admin, Settings, Title is shown. The problem with this is that we don't change that title in our different Jira instances because doing that can break Application Links, and the title isn't really shown anywhere in the UI.\r\n\r\nSo at the moment it's easy to make a change in a Jira instance without knowing which one you are connected to.\r\n\r\nMy suggestion is to add some way to tell mobile users when they look at an issue that they are not connected to their production Jira. Production Jira issues should not look any different\r\n\r\nOne way to do this would be to have a custom renderer that adds a prefix to the content of some field saying \"Non Prod\" based on checking the base url. But that's pretty specific to each customer.\r\n\r\nIf there were a setting in Jira admin properties that by default says the Jira is production, and then admins change that setting in non-prod instances, then the mobile app could use this info to change something about how the issue appears.\r\n\r\n",

Issue Summary\r\n\r\nIn \"Issue Edit screen\" the options for 'Select List (cascading)' being defaulted to (not available) which is not being recognized by Jira, neither the value was inserted manually.\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Create a custom field of type\u00a0'Select List (cascading)' and give the options for the select list, this happens only for the second level value in cascading list.\r\n # Go to filed configuration and make the field as \"required\" that we just created.\r\n # Create a new issue where give the parent value of cascading list an option, and secondary value leave as 'None' and click on \"create\".\r\n # Once the issue gets created click on \"Edit\" button on the left side and try to update this will throw an error stating \"The filed is required\" and the secondary field where we left the option \"None\" will be defaulted to \"(Not available)\" which you can't see while creating an issue and this value is being defaulted only in the \"Edit issue\" screen.\r\n\r\nAttached screen recording while reproducing the issue and this seems to be related to the bug JRASERVER-62455 where it was introduced to prevent the data loss. and this was introduced in Jira version 8.8.1\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nWhen the field value is set to \"None\" this should not default to \"(not available)\" in the Edit screen.\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nWhile clicking on the \"Edit\" option the values which have \"None\" as default being changed to (Not available), make Jira treat the not-empty field as empty. And issue editing is only possible when the value is manually changed to None. This thing is the main problem.\r\nh3.

Issue Summary\r\nUnder a very high load and a large number of Lucene operations on a large Lucene index, JVM starts having contention in reading {{java.lang.ThreadLocal}} variables.\r\nTo be specific {{java.lang.ThreadLocal$ThreadLocalMap.getEntry}} and {{java.lang.ThreadLocal$ThreadLocalMap.getEntryAfterMiss}} calls become very contended which leads to high CPU usage (and high LA). \r\n\r\nIn short, it\u2019s a combination of 3 factors:\r\n* High *allocation rate* of _ThreadLocal_  - caused by Lucene lib (it's tracking index segments in {{org.apache.lucene.util.CloseableThreadLocal}})\r\n** and as consequence very high number of {{java.lang.ThreadLocal$ThreadLocalMap$Entry}} in the corresponding {{java.lang.ThreadLocal$ThreadLocalMap}}\r\n* *Slow GC collection* of ThreadLocal since they are weakly referenced - a \"feature\" of modern GC (see [JDK-8182982|https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8182982])\r\n* High *pressure* on  _ThreadLocal_ by doing high concurency reads from cache\r\n** Jira uses _EhCache_, which uses _ReentrantReadWriteLock_ internally, which uses _ThreadLocal_ \r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n* Large Jira instance with large Lucene (to have many segments)\r\n* Apply high load:\r\n**  a lot of Lucene operations \r\n** large number of cache reads (eg. CachingProjectRoleAndActorStore.getProjectRole)\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n* Application is stable under load \r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n* Application is not stable, large CPU usage\r\n* Growing number of {{java.lang.ThreadLocal}} and corresponding {{java.lang.ThreadLocal$ThreadLocalMap$Entry}} \r\n\r\nh3.

When short-lived ThreadLocals are created and die at a rate linear to application throughout, this leads to ThreadLocal maps inactive threads holding thousands or millions of entries, to extremely long collision chains, and to situations where half the CPU is spent walking those chains in ThreadLocal.get().\r\n* https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-6625724\r\n\r\nNote on ThreadLocal:\r\n* ThreadLocal variables use WeakReferences as internal implementation, which are subject to different cleanup rules than normal references. \r\n** On G1GC, we have a time budget for maximum GC pause (a soft goal), and JVM may opt to delay the collection of WeakReferences to a cleanup of tenured space to meet that goal (it will only clean up a subset of cleanable weak references in young GC). This may cause a build-up of entries in the ThreadLocalMaps of threads.\r\n* the following JVM parameter will give more details in GC logs about how much _WeakReferences_ are cleaned up:\r\n** -XX:+PrintReferenceGC\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\nA couple of options are available here:\r\n* upgrading to Jira 8.x\r\n** due to changes in Lucene and Jira it produces less _ThreadLocal_\r\n\r\n* tuning G1GC\r\n** give it less aggressive goal to allow more _WeakReferences_ to be collected\r\n* switching to CMS\r\n ** based on Elastic Search examples, resolve the problem as it collects _Weakeferences_ more aggressively\r\n ** It's an old GC algorithm, may have more frequent peaks and longer average collection time",

      "description": "h4. Problem Summary\r\n\r\nThe Jira EventPublisher service continually evaluates whether a user was deleted or not upon synchronization with Crowd. If a third party plugin is listening for these events and logging them in a table or log, then this can result in a huge number of entries being recorded.\r\nh4. Problem Scenario\r\n\r\nHere are the conditions by which we were able to trigger the UserDeletedEvent being repetitively published for any disabled user in Jira:\r\n * Within Crowd:\r\n ** Add a user to a local Crowd directory.\r\n ** Add the local Crowd directory to a Jira application configuration.\r\n * Perform a sync between Crowd and Jira.\r\n * This user now appears in Jira listed under Crowd directory.\r\n * Assign this user to an issue. If the user is not assigned to anything and doesn't have any content, this problem doesn't appear to occur.\r\n * Next, deactivate the user in Crowd\r\n * Again, sync Jira with Crowd.\r\n * The user appears in Jira as inactive.\r\n * In Crowd, remove the Crowd internal directory from the Jira application configuration.\r\n sync with Jira\r\n * Again, sync Jira with Crowd.\r\n * The user does not display in the Jira user listing though content still references his (inactive) name.\r\n * After the sync, one UserDeletedEvent entry appears in the _Customfield Editor for Jira_ plugin's\u00a0__\u00a0AO event table.\r\n * But then, each time a sync occurs with Crowd, the Jira EventPublisher executes the UserDeletedEvent event and the _Customfield Editor for Jira_ listens for and reads this event and records it into its AO table. Over time, this table will fill up quickly.\r\n\r\nThis behavior affects not just the _Customfield Editor for Jira_ plugin, but any plugin listening to the\u00a0UserDeletedEvent event executed by the EventPublisher.\r\n\r\nh4. Possible Workarounds\r\n* If the plugin has the option to disable it's event logging, do so and only enable the event log when needed to gather troubleshooting information for a specific problem.\r\n* Another work around option might be to periodically purge old records from the AO event log table, if used.",

Issue Summary\r\n\r\nThe clustering monitoring page does not work in case the node name has capital / upper case characters hence not providing CPU/Memory/Uptime information. for eg: (jira.node.id = Node1)\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Deploy JIRA Datacenter 8.7.1\r\n # In the cluster.properties file, add the node name (jira.node.id) as \"Node1\". Different combination tried (Node1, oNOde1).\r\n # Another point to note is, even the node name includes upper case letter the UI displays it as lower case letter.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n * CPU/Memory/Uptime information to be displayed:\r\n !Screen Shot 2020-05-11 at 6.55.53 PM.png|width=521,height=86,thumbnail!\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n * CPU/Memory/Uptime information *is not displayed*:\r\n !Screen Shot 2020-05-11 at 6.44.46 PM.png|thumbnail!  \r\n!Screen Shot 2020-05-11 at 6.44.29 PM.png|thumbnail! \r\nh3. Workaround\r\n * Remove the capital characters from the node name (jira.node.id in cluster.properties file). node name should be only with lower case characters.",
