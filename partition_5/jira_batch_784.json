It just adds complexity. \r\nFor example, you can say\r\n{code}assignee is currentuser(){code}\r\nand\r\n{code}assignee is in (currentuser()){code}\r\nand\r\n{code}assignee is in membersof(jira-users){code}\r\nand\r\n{code}assignee is in (membersof(jira-users)){code}\r\nand\r\n{code}assignee is in (currentuser(), membersof(jira-users)){code}\r\nbut not \r\n{code} assignee is membersof(jira-users){code}\r\n\r\nI understand why the last one doesn't work, but really adding the \"in\" into all these examples is purely just aesthetic. The meaning could be derived by a parser purely by the subject of the sentence without the IN or WAS IN. Certainly by the time the search makes it to Lucene's language the IN part is lost.\r\n\r\nI bring all this up because I have written a Javascript parser for all this in the [HP/Palm Jira Search Plugin|https://studio.plugins.atlassian.com/wiki/display/HPPSP]. When it gets down to breaking up the WAS IN (...) clause, you have to inspect each item in the list to determine whether IN applies or not. It would be easier to just not have to worry about whether to apply an IN.\r\n\r\nAnother way to look at what I'm trying to say is, just make the singular operators = and WAS also include IN and WAS IN",

For example we defined a transitions with a screen, with 10 custom fields and corresponding validation rules. So a user can only perform the transition if he fill out all fields. \r\n\r\nSo if a employee tries to perform this transition a transition screen pops up which contains all 10 fields. The employee will fill out the first 9 fields. Now he realizes that he has not the information for the 10th field. This is a big problem, because he must press the cancel-button. The validation rule of the 10th field does not allow to perform the transition and a save/update of the current fields is not possible. So he has to discard all changes....\r\n\r\nThis is not really fine for the usability, because this is \"idle power\". He has to fill out all 9 fields again, if he knows the information of the 10th field... :-(\r\n\r\nIt would be great if we can have a save/update button (or a Cancel & Save-Button whatever) to prevent unnecessary work.\r\n\r\n",

Though, what we've learned is that people tend to forget about the other tabs when creating a new issue since when scrolling down the tabs bar disappears. \r\n\r\nI think it would we of great help if the tab bar would have a fixed position (same as for the \"Create Issue\" banner at the top of the screen).\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nPetru ",

But it looks like there is a Jira OAuth filter that is preventing me to complete my request for the Request Token.\r\n\r\nWorkaround:\r\n-I had to change my plug-in filter weight so my code runs before the Jira filters.\r\n-I had to modify my code, so when the oauth request arrives in the context of my plug-in, I stop the filter chain (something that I do not really wanted to do) so Jira does not eats the request and prevent that the process flows. If the filter flows naturally after my code is reached, Jira filters eat my request.\r\n\r\nJira Server logs\r\n[INFO] [talledLocalContainer] 2012-12-18 15:05:18,403 http-2990-8 WARN anonymous 897x945x1 8po31g X.X.XX.XXX /rest/oslc/latest/oauth/request_token [remoteapps.modules.oauth.OAuth2LOAuthenticator] Exception authenticating request\r\n[INFO] [talledLocalContainer] net.oauth.OAuthException: Unknown consumer: f51bccc75a1f82c2cc514f8fe92e1b2d\r\n[INFO] [talledLocalContainer] at com.atlassian.labs.remoteapps.OAuthLinkManager.validateOAuth2LORequest(OAuthLinkManager.java:123)\r\n[INFO] [talledLocalContainer] at com.atlassian.labs.remoteapps.modules.oauth.OAuth2LOAuthenticator.authenticate(OAuth2LOAuthenticator.java:86)\r\n[INFO] [talledLocalContainer] at com.atlassian.labs.remoteapps.modules.oauth.OAuth2LOFilter.mayProceed(OAuth2LOFilter.java:100)\r\n[INFO] [talledLocalContainer] at com.atlassian.labs.remoteapps.modules.oauth.OAuth2LOFilter.doFilter(OAuth2LOFilter.java:58)\r\n[INFO] [talledLocalContainer] at com.atlassian.plugin.servlet.filter.DelegatingPluginFilter.doFilter(DelegatingPluginFilter.java:74)\r\n[INFO] [talledLocalContainer] at com.atlassian.plugin.servlet.filter.IteratingFilterChain.doFilter(IteratingFilterChain.java:42)\r\n\r\nMy plug-in does have a consumer registered with the key showed in the log, but as the Jira server does not (and I do not need to register it) the app fails to continue with the OAuth process.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance",

As a result, descriptions can extend beyond the CSS borders, creating scroll bars. \r\n \r\nAlso, the description field is 1 continuous field without formatting options. We have a customer inquiring about how to add a line to the description:\r\n\r\nhttps://answers.atlassian.com/questions/102740/project-versions-how-can-i-add-a-new-line-in-the-description-of-a-version?page=1#124356 \r\n\r\nIMO, if the description field was limited in character size, it might also make adding descriptions more intuitive. It does not seem intuitive to allow  a lot of text into the field unless we compliment it with formatting options (line breaks, bolding, italics, etc). \r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nJason | Atlassian",

[See the corresponding bug report|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-31291].\r\n{panel}\r\nh4. Summary\r\nBy default Jira ships with settings to accept only 2 digits for year values in dates.  This causes ambiguity for dates of events that are several years in the future or past because of the inherit loss of precision that comes with trying to store a four digit value like a year with only two digits.\r\n\r\nh4. Steps to reproduce:\r\n # Create or edit an issue and set the Due Date to 12/31/2031 or any date after that.\r\n\r\nh4. Expected behavior:\r\n\r\nJira should set the correct date.\r\n\r\nh4. Actual results:\r\n\r\nYou pick a date after 12/31/2031 it will yield a date from early 1900's.\r\n\r\nFor example, picking 12/31/2032 yields 12/31/1932 when the field is saved.\r\n\r\n !Screenshot 2020-12-18 at 16.17.32.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\nh4. Workaround:\r\n\r\nA Jira Administrator can change the input settings and the look and feel setting so that all dates in Jira will always use 4 digit years instead of 2 digit years.  This will help to avoid the problem when users are setting values going forward.\r\n\r\n1. \u2699\ufe0e -> System -> General configuration -> Advanced settings:\r\n\r\n!advancedset1.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nChange 4 values on this page\r\n # *jira.date.picker.java.format*\r\n # *jira.date.picker.javascript.format*\r\n # *jira.date.time.picker.java.format*\r\n # *jira.date.time.picker.javascript.format*\r\n\r\nFor the java fields change the 'yy' portion to 'yyyy'. For the javascript entries, the syntax is different, you have change '%y' to '%Y'.\u00a0\u00a0 So for example if\u00a0*jira.date.picker.java.format* has a current value of 'd/MMM/yy' (without quotes) you would change this to 'd/MMM/yyyy'.\r\n\r\n2. \u2699\ufe0e -> System -> User Interface -> Look and Feel\r\n\r\n!lookfeel1.png|thumbnail!\r\n The look and feels settings also need to be updated. Change the year values here from 'yy' to be 'yyyy'.",

Summary\r\nThe documentation on [Using Quick Search|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Using+Quick+Search] should be edited to prevent misleading guide. This is because Quick Search does not support searching multiple words.  For example, searching for resolution like \"Cannot Reproduce\" will not shows all results with the same resolution. Other issues with not \"Cannot Reproduce\" will also be shown. However, in documentation, the resolution, for instance, consists of two words: {{cannot reproduce}}.\r\n\r\nh4. Improvement Request\r\nThis has been raised here: [JRA-5114|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRA-5114]",

Summary\r\nBrowser Information is not being collected at all the Issue Collector when the environment field is not on the default screen in the given project.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Create an empty JIRA instance\r\n# Create a new project on that instance\r\n# Create an issue collector inside the project making sure that the \"Collect browser information\" checkbox is checked\r\n# Embed the issue collector on some website (e.g. http://jsbin.com/)\r\n# Create issue using embeded collector\r\n# Navigate to the issue\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nThe new issue should have the browser information stored in the environment field.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nThe new issue doesn't have the environment field and it doesn't have the browser information.\r\n \r\nh3. Notes\r\nThe reason it happens seems to be that the environment field is no longer on default screens for projects and therefore is discarded during issue creation.\r\n\r\nh3.Workaround\r\nTo work around this issue add the environment system field to the *default* create screen in the project you set up the issue collector. New issues created in this project using issue collector will have the browser information collected in the environment field.\r\n\r\n",
