Here's a summary of the changes:\r\n * Pagination is fixed\r\n * Organization members are now ordered by their accountId\r\n * Performance improvement on instance with large number of users\r\n * {{name}} and {{key}} fields are no longer returned\r\n * {{emailAddress}}, {{displayName}}, {{timeZone}} and {{locale}} might be null / masked depending on profile privacy settings\r\n\r\nPlease refer to [https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/deprecation-notice-user-privacy-api-migration-guide/]\u00a0for more information regarding user privacy changes.\r\n{panel}\r\nh3. Summary\r\n{noformat}\r\nGET /rest/servicedeskapi/organization/{organizationId}/user{noformat}\r\nUsing this API endpoint to retrieve customers returns duplicates across pages of paginated results.\r\nh3. Environment\r\n * 150+ customers in org\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Create a service desk project.\r\n # Create an organization.\r\n # Add 150 customers to this organization.\r\n # Run the following cURL:\r\n{code:bash}\r\ncurl -X GET \\\r\n  'https://skahol.atlassian.net/rest/servicedeskapi/organization/5/user?limit=10&start=0' \\\r\n  -H 'Accept: application/json' \\\r\n  -H 'Authorization: Basic <authToken>' \\\r\n  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \r\n{code}\r\n\r\n # Make note of the response.\r\n # Now run this cURL:\r\n{code:bash}\r\ncurl -X GET \\\r\n  'https://skahol.atlassian.net/rest/servicedeskapi/organization/5/user?limit=10&start=11' \\\r\n  -H 'Accept: application/json' \\\r\n  -H 'Authorization: Basic <authToken>' \\\r\n  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \r\n{code}\r\n\r\n # Make note again of this response.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nthe results returned in each response should be different.\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nSome of the same users are returned in each result set suggesting the order they are retrieved is not consistent meaning pagination does not work as expected.\r\nh3. Notes\r\n\r\n[The Jira Service Desk Cloud REST API - Get users in organization|https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/service-desk/rest/#api-rest-servicedeskapi-organization-organizationId-user-get]\r\n [The Jira Service Desk Cloud REST API - Pagination|https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/service-desk/rest/#pagination]\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nCurrently there is no known workaround for this behavior. A workaround will be added here when available",
