Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nEither:\r\n * Create a REST API endpoint that can in some manner provide the binary data stream of the attachments themselves in such a manner that this REST APi endpoint could be called and those attachments downloaded using this personal access token\r\n OR\r\n * Change the check that appears to be forcing any such requests using this token for authentication/authorization so that these requests can be made successfully without redirecting to a login page.\r\n\r\nh3. Why this is important\r\n\r\nThis is something you can do in Jira Cloud today with a REST API token. The fact this does not work in Server is a lack of feature parity. Personal access tokens would be more useful if they could be used in this manner to also gather attachments on Jira server issues.\r\n This is also something that works if your curl call uses a basic authorization (supplying username and password with the -u switch)\r\nh3.

Issue Summary\r\n\r\nIf a failure occurs during a particular part of the _Create project based on shared configuration_ process, other projects associated with the Issue Type Scheme of the project may be reverted to \"Default Issue Type Scheme\"\r\n\r\nThe failure occurs because from a SQL perspective, Jira DELETE's existing Issue Type Scheme associations before INSERTing the updated list again, in batches. The associations are stored in the {{configurationcontext}} table.\r\n\r\nFailures that could trigger the problem include database problem,(for instance, an INSERT query failing due to UNDO table space error, on Oracle) or network outage between Jira and the database.\r\n\r\nThis DELETE-then-INSERT process is not protected by a transaction, which is why the scheme associations can be reverted in this way.\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Create 1000 projects, all on the one Issue Type Configuration Scheme\r\n # Select Projects -> Create Project -> _Create based on shared configuration_\r\n # Select one of the 1000 projects, and start the creation process.\r\n # While the creation is in progress, simulate a failure to the database during the store() method of FieldConfigContextPersisterWorker.java during\u00a0storeAllContexts()\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nJira should fail gracefully - the Issue Type Scheme for the project selected in _Create from shared configuration_ is not changed.\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nThe Issue Type Scheme for the project selected in _Create from shared configuration_ from no longer lists all projects. Some previously assigned projects are reverted back to _\"Default Issue Type Scheme\"_\r\n\r\nThe {{createshared}} REST endpoint used to process the project creation may throw an error with associated stack trace, for example:\r\n{code:java}\r\n2020-05-07 14:42:25,692 http-nio-8080-exec-600 url:/rest/project-t...createshared/17370 username:admin ERROR admin 881x8509894x120 11pz9go 0.0.0.0,0.0.0.0,127.0.0.1 /rest/project-templates/1.0/createshared/17370 [c.a.p.r.c.error.jersey.ThrowableExceptionMapper] Uncaught exception thrown by REST service: org.ofbiz.core.entity.GenericEntityException: while inserting: [GenericEntity:ConfigurationContext][fieldconfigscheme,13400][project,25117][id,3705875][key,issuetype] (SQL Exception while executing the following:INSERT INTO configurationcontext (ID, PROJECTCATEGORY, PROJECT, customfield, FIELDCONFIGSCHEME) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?)

Notes\r\nSee JRASERVER-71178 for description of the underlying problem\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nCurrently there is no known workaround to prevent this behavior. A workaround will be added here when available.\r\n\r\nHowever, the scheme associations reverted can be set back.\r\n\r\n*Recovering the Issue Type Scheme associations*\r\n * In simple scenario you can reassign corresponding _IssueTypeSchema_ (ITS) to affected projects\r\n * In case of large number projects affected, usually the list it's not that obvious. \r\n ** If a stack trace of the failure is found, it may include the Issue Type Scheme ID. The following example tells us the {{issuetype}} scheme ID is *13400*, which means that we need to re-associate projects to the Issue Type Scheme with id *13400*{code:java}\r\norg.ofbiz.core.entity.GenericEntityException: while inserting: [GenericEntity:ConfigurationContext][fieldconfigscheme,13400][project,25117][id,3705875][key,issuetype]{code}\r\n ** You can use a recent JIRA DB backup or staging copy to obtain the list of correct assignments. You will need a couple of tables (_configurationcontext_, _project_, _fieldconfigscheme_) and run the following SQL to get the mapping list:\r\n{code:java}\r\nselect p.id as PID,p.pname as ProjectName,cc.fieldconfigscheme as ITS_ID,fcs.configname as ITS_Name from configurationcontext cc,project p,fieldconfigscheme fcs where cc.customfield = 'issuetype' and p.id=cc.project and fcs.id=cc.fieldconfigscheme;\r\n  pid  |    projectname     | its_id |                   its_name\r\n-------+--------------------+--------+----------------------------------------------\r\n 10001 | Dragons            |  10101 | DRA: Simple Issue Tracking Issue Type Scheme\r\n 10100 | PRG                |  10300 | PRG: Simple Issue Tracking Issue Type Scheme\r\n 10300 | Agile-Project      |  10805 | AG: Scrum Issue Type Scheme{code}\r\n * Once the affected Issue Type Scheme, and a list of projects to be fixed has been determined, set them back to the correct Issue Type Scheme via Jira Admin > Issues > Issue Type Schemes, or programmatically via the REST API: [PUT /rest/api/2/issuetypescheme/(schemeId)/associations|https://docs.atlassian.com/software/jira/docs/api/REST/latest/#api/2/issuetypescheme-setProjectAssociationsForScheme]\r\n* If users have created new issues that have issue types that do not exist in the issue type scheme you are trying to associate in the REST API, you will need to navigate to manually update the issue type scheme for these projects manually in the project settings. \r\n",

Issue summary\r\n\r\nThe owner of a dashboard can't be changed if the dashboard had been shared with a user who was synced from an LDAP directory and then removed from that directory.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to replicate\r\n\r\n- Install Jira 8.13.0\r\n- Configure Jira with an LDAP directory in *\u2699 > User Management > User Directories*\r\n- Ensure that the LDAP directory has at least one user\r\n !Step1.png|thumbnail! \r\n- Sync Jira with the directory\r\n- Verify that the user was synced in Jira from the LDAP\r\n !Step2.png|thumbnail! \r\n- Create a new dashboard, and grant the edit permission to the LDAP user\r\n !Step3.png|thumbnail! \r\n- Go to *\u2699 > System > SHARED ITEMS > Dashboard*, and verify that you can see the new dashboard, along with the user it was shared with:\r\n !Step4.png|thumbnail! \r\n- Go to the LDAP server and remove the LDAP user\r\n- Sync Jira with the directory in *\u2699 > User Management > User Directories*\r\n- Verify that the LDAP user is no longer in Jira:\r\n !Step5.png|thumbnail! \r\n- Go to *\u2699 > System > SHARED ITEMS > Dashboard*, and now observe that the dashboard is shared with \"User: User is invalid (EDIT)\"\r\n !Step6.png|thumbnail! \r\n- Click on *\u2699 > Change owner* next to this dashboard\r\n- Select a new user to be the owner of this dashboard\r\n- Click on *Change owner*\r\n\r\nh3. Expected results\r\n\r\nThe owner of the dashboard should be changed to the new user.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual results\r\n\r\nThe owner of the dashboard is not changed, and the following error is displayed in the UI:\r\n{code}\r\nUser: 'XXXXX' does not exist\r\n{code}\r\n !Step7.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nh4. Workaround 1\r\n\r\nLog in as the user who currently owns the dashboard, log into Jira as this user, and remove the LDAP user that the dashboard is shared with:\r\n !Step8.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\n(!) If the current owner of the dashboard no longer works in your organization, the Jira System Admin can reset the password of this user provided that *this user is from Jira's internal directory*. If that's the case, go to *\u2699 > User Management > Users*, look for the user, click on it, then go to *Actions > Set password*.\r\n\r\n\r\nh4. Workaround 2\r\n\r\nRemove the dashboard share with the LDAP user directory from the database:\r\n- Stop Jira\r\n- (!) *Backup your Jira Database*, so that you can revert the changes made to the database if anything goes wrong\r\n- Run the following SQL query to list all the users the dashboard is shared with, after replacing <DASHBOARD_NAME> with the name of the dashboard:\r\n{code}\r\nselect * from sharepermissions where entitytype = 'PortalPage' and sharetype = 'user' and entityid = (select id from portalpage where pagename = '<DASHBOARD_NAME>');\r\n{code}\r\n-- Example of output below (only for your reference):\r\n{code}\r\n  id   | entityid | entitytype | sharetype |    param1     | param2 | rights \r\n-------+----------+------------+-----------+---------------+--------+--------\r\n 10619 |    10301 | PortalPage | user      | JIRAUSER10840 |        |      3\r\n{code}\r\n- Search for the row where the value in the \"param1\" column corresponds to the user that the error was complaining about (it should correspond to the user_key of the deleted LDAP user). Note the value in the ID column (which is 10619 in the example below)\r\n- After you identify the ID of the row that needs to be deleted, run the following delete query after replacing <ID> with the id identified above:\r\n{code}\r\ndelete from sharepermissions where id = <ID>;\r\n{code}\r\n- Start Jira\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Note\r\n\r\nThis bug only occurs if the the user the dashboard was shared with is deleted from a sync with the LDAP directory.\r\nIf the user is from the Jira internal directory and is deleted from the Jira UI, the dashboard share with this user will properly be deleted in the database (from the sharepermissions table), and the bug won't occur.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "description": "h3. Issue Summary\r\n\r\nWhen performing some functions in the Android Jira Mobile App, calls to the server are duplicated. This results in double the load on the application node, which could result in performance degradation. Actions identified thus-far are related to boards:\r\n * Enter a board\r\n * Click and issue from a board, then go back to the board\r\n\r\n*Impact*\r\nThe affected endpoint has the ability to consume a non-trivial amount of memory, so if a user accesses one of these functions and it is loading slowly, they may make repeat actions which could result in the application node consuming all available heap and going unresponsive. The Mobile app allows such repeat operations, which result in repeat request to server, which results in excessive heap consumption. \r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Install Android App (I tested 0.16.2)\r\n # Setup the app to connect to a local Jira instance\r\n # Tail your Jira access log and observe request coming through\r\n{code:java}\r\ntail -f JIRA_INSTALL/logs/access_log.2020-01-18 \r\n#replace JIRA_INSTALL with your jira install directory, and 2020-01-18 with today's date{code}\r\n # Click into a board\r\n\r\nh3.

      "description": "h3. Issue Summary\r\n\r\nOne of the reasons why a Jira System Administrator removes the *Extended Project Administration* permission/feature is to prevent other users associated with the project from editing its workflows, and this is supported by the usage of the following article available in our documentation:\r\n * [Project Permissions Overview - Extended project administration|https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiraserver0813/managing-project-permissions-1027137825.html#Managingprojectpermissions-Extendedprojectpermissions]\r\n\r\nThis permission allows users to edit a project's workflows under certain conditions. However, with this feature *disabled*, a user that has been inserted into the *Administrators* role for this project and is listed as a *Board Administrator* still is able to alter the *Simplified Workflow* of the board (if it is being used), causing the *project's workflow* to be altered in this process.\r\n\r\nEven though, this information is properly listed in the *Benefits of using the Simplified \r\n Workflow* section of the documentation article associated with *Simplified Workflows*:\r\n * [Using the Simplified Workflow|https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirasoftwareserver/using-the-simplified-workflow-938845286.html]\r\n\r\nWe can find a quote from the article below:\r\n{quote} * Can be edited via the board configuration (see Adding a new status on the [Configuring columns|https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirasoftwareserver/configuring-columns-938845277.html] page), provided that you are the project administrator for the project that is on the board.{quote}\r\nThis can lead to confusion, as this feature can allow these users to alter the project's workflows, by altering the board's column configuration. Therefore, we should update our documentation article ([Managing Project permissions|https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiraserver0813/managing-project-permissions-1027137825.html]) to address this situation and to better inform our customers of this use-case. Having that said, we need to be more explicit under conditions this feature is not valid for *Simplified Workflows*, to prevent this confusion.\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Create a sample Scrum or Kanban project, which will be created with a simplified workflow.\r\n # Disable the Extended permissions for the project.\r\n # Go to the board configuration. # Create a new status or new column.\r\n # This will create a new step on the project Simplified workflow.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nThe [Managing Project permissions|https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiraserver0813/managing-project-permissions-1027137825.html] would accurately outline this exception.\r\nh3.
