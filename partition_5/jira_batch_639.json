Summary\r\n\r\nThe current warning about data overwrite for users performing import is rather insufficient. The warning should state that the import will overwrite all JIRA data including the current userbase which will affect other application in the same subscription e.g. Confluence.\r\n\r\nCurrent message:\r\n{noformat}\r\nPlease note that this process will delete all existing JIRA data in your site and replace it with data from the selected file. If you only want to import specific content (such as attachments, avatars, or logos) without deleting all site data, you must make sure that you upload a file with those entities only.\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nThe message seems to be focusing on JIRA only and it doesn't mention about userbase overwrite which can affect other running applications.\r\n\r\nh3. Suggestion\r\n\r\nAll critical information that are related to data overwrite should be warned specifically in the first step of import process as this can be destructive. Further details can be further communicated in documentation.",

      "description": "JIRA 7.2 changed how customfield gets rendered using the `NEW_CONTENT_ADDED` event. It was a pain before but now, it is unmanageable and causes a lot of issues in IE/Edge and sometimes in Firefox (browser freeze). For a simple static field, rendering is completely done on server and it works fine. However, for fields having complex logic on the client side, it's not working at all.\r\n\r\nBefore 7.2, it was possible to apply different hacks. In 7.2 and beyond, freezing issues are unavoidable, especially since you started to be able to browse issues on the project view.\r\nThere is no solid and simple way (at least that I am aware of) to properly determine when your field is being rendered or discarded from the screen. In order to initialize my field on the client-side, I need to rely on JIRA.bind. One of the major problem is that as the user browse issues, I keep attaching watchers and I am never notified when the field is removed from the page so I cannot remove the watchers. This causes a multiplication of watchers which ends up freezing the browser. Also, sometimes, call backs do not get called in specific views (e.g. Dialogs).",

Summary\r\n\r\nExported CSV file from JIRA with issues that contain multi-line description can't be properly imported into Microsoft Excel. \r\n Only way to open CSV files with multi-lines in Microsoft Excel is to do so with \"Open\" option, which doesn't recognize UTF-8 encoding and can expect different separator than comma (,) depending on region set in operating system.\r\n\r\nCSV export from JIRA currently can't be customized. It is always encoded in UTF-8 and has separators fixed to comma (,).\r\nh3. Environment\r\n * Tested with Microsoft Excel 2016\u00a0for MacOS 10.11.1\r\n * JIRA 7.3.0\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to reproduce\r\n # Create new issue that has:\r\n ** Multi-line description\r\n ** Some regional characters (e.g. \u017e\u00e9\u00ed\u00fd\u0161\u00e1\u010d\u00fa\u0159\u00da\u0148\u011b\u010c\u0105\u0119\u0107\u015b\u017a\u017c\u0142\u00f3\u0144) in description or summary\r\n # From the issue navigator, export the issue to a CSV file (e.g. Export > CSV (All fields))\r\n # Case 1:\r\n ** Open CSV in Microsoft Excel 2016.\r\n # Case 2:\r\n ** Import CSV into Microsoft Excel 2016\r\n *** Select delimited columns\r\n *** Select UTF-8 as encoding\r\n *** Select comma as delimiter\r\n\r\nh3. Expected result\r\n\r\nIn at least one case Excel should show data in proper cells while rendering correctly all of regional characters.\r\nh3. Actual result\r\n\r\nCase 1: Data will go to proper cells if region in operating system is set to one that uses commas as delimiter in CSV. UTF-8 encoding is always not recognized.\r\n\r\nCase 2: New lines in multi-lined text split rows making data go to improper cells\r\nh3. Workarounds\r\nh4. Workaround 1\r\n\r\nOpen CSV file in other spreadsheet software (e.g. [LibreOffice|https://www.libreoffice.org/] or [Google Spreadsheets|https://www.google.com/sheets/about/]) and export it to XLS or XLSX file\r\nh4. Workaround 2\r\n # At the beginning of the CSV file put\r\n{code:java}\r\n sep=,{code}\r\n\r\n # Use some external tool to change file's\u00a0encoding to some that would be recognized by Excel\r\n # Open new file directly into Excel\r\n\r\nh4. Workaround 3\r\n # Open the CSV file with Notepad (default text editor in Windows)\r\n # Click File -> Save as -> Ensure Encoding is UTF-8 -> Save\r\n # Open the new file with\u00a0Excel\r\n\r\nh4.

Summary\r\n\r\nUnable to remove group from default member of project role when group was added using different case than actual group name.\r\n\u00a0\r\nh3.

For sake of testing, you can move the issue manually.\r\n# Create a new issue in project Test A and Test B. For example, the issue keys of the 2 new issues will be TA-1 and TB-1.\r\n# Send email to the Test A mail handler.

      "description": "h3. Summary\r\nIn JIRA datacenter, LexoRank Rebalance causes read/write amplifications on Lucene which may cause performance degradation if cluster doesn't have IO/CPU capacity. \r\n\r\nh3. Environment\r\n* JIRA Datacenter \r\n* Large number of issues 1M+\r\n* Large number of custom fields: 1k+\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Setup JIRA Datacenter\r\n# Trigger or wait for LexoRank Rebalance\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nJIRA Datacenter performance will be not affected and no replication lag\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nJIRA Datacenter performance could be affected and there will be replication lag. That will cause data discrepancy between nodes. \r\nYou will have following health-check error:\r\n{code}\r\n[\"Index replication for cluster node 'node3' is behind by 2,991 seconds.\",\"Index replication for cluster node 'node1' is behind by 1,501 seconds.\",\"Index replication for cluster node 'node2_0004' is behind by 2,123 seconds.\"]\r\n{code}\r\n \r\nh3. Notes\r\nProblem is caused by set of conditions/problems:\r\n* LexoRank Rebalancing requires rebalancing of all records in Rank field\r\n* In case of JDC that required reindexing of all issues with all related customfields/comments\r\n* That causes read and write amplification, as all nodes needs to update their Lucene index for all issues\r\n* JDC uses same {{replicatedindexoperation}} mechanism for all updates.\r\n** That means that critical replication updates from at other nodes initiated by user action compete with non-urgent _LexoRank_ updates. \r\n\r\nh3. Workarounds\r\n* Reduce the number of nodes in the cluster. Testing reveals diminishing returns in performance in clusters larger than 4 nodes.\r\n* Avoid closing a sprint with > 200 issues in an unresolved status. This requires a new Rank value for all these issues and can trigger a Lexorank rebalance.\r\n* If you are planning to import hundreds of issues, delay this until you have tested and resolved performance bottlenecks. A Rank must be generated for every issue and this can trigger a Lexorank rebalance.\r\n* Leave only one node in LB to prevent serving stale data from other nodes. This negates the high availability value of Data Center so is considered a last resort. This also requires that each node is capable of handling the full concurrent user traffic for your organization, as is the best practice for an HA cluster.\r\n\r\nFull details on workarounds and solutions are available at [JIRAKB/JIRA Software Data Center Lexorank Indexing Lag|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRAKB/JIRA+Software+Data+Center+Lexorank+Indexing+Lag].\r\n\r\nh3. Note on Fix\r\nProblem mitigation:\r\n* We have worked on reducing the need of LexoRank balancing being triggered (JSW-15710). \r\n* Also a number of improvements to LexoRank balancing has been implemented that reduce impact of it running on JIRA cluster. \r\n** We have addressed replication lag in JSW-15703. \r\n\r\nThat said, a running LexoRank balancing will still cause some read and write amplification. More details about resolution are available at [JIRAKB/JIRA Software Data Center Lexorank Indexing Lag|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRAKB/JIRA+Software+Data+Center+Lexorank+Indexing+Lag].\r\n",

Summary\r\nA user who is a member of the Project Role (Administrators) which has been added to the *Administer Project* permission is unable to edit the Project Lead. According to the [documentation|https://confluence.atlassian.com/jira/managing-project-permissions-185729636.html], the *Administer Project* permission allows any user w/ the permission to edit the Project Lead:\r\nbq. Permission to administer a project in JIRA. This includes the ability to edit project role membership, project components, project versions and some project details ('Project Name', 'URL', 'Project Lead', 'Project Description').\r\n\r\nHowever, with this bug, a user with the *Administer Project* permission is unable to edit the Project Lead. No errors -appear in the UI or- in the logs.\r\n\r\nAs of JIRA 7.2.0-OD-05, receiving the following Error when trying to change the Project Lead or Default Assignee as a Project Admin:\r\n!EditProjectLeadorAssignee.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Create a project and grant the user Project Administration permission\r\n# Login to the instance as the user and navigate to project settings > Users and Roles\r\n# Click on \"Edit Defaults\"\r\n# Change project lead to another user\r\n# Click \"Update\"\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n-The update completes and pop-up window closes.- User is able to update changes to Project Lead and you see the Project Lead correctly updated on the page. \r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n-The update button does not respond. You will see a brief spinning wheel, but the \"Update\" button does not actually update the user.-\r\n\r\nReceiving an error indicating \"You must have global administrator rights in order to modify the project key.\"\r\n\r\nLooking in the logs with {{com.atlassian.jira.security}} DEBUG, all the permissions clear:\r\n{code}\r\n2016-03-04 17:28:28.883949500 2016-03-04 17:28:28,881 http-nio-2990-exec-227 DEBUG rfuerst 1048x24557x1 39fl15 4.15.43.214,10.85.161.148,127.0.0.1 /secure/project/EditProjectLeadAndDefaultAssignee.jspa [c.a.jira.security.WorkflowBasedPermissionManager] BROWSE_PROJECTS permission granted by permission scheme\r\n2016-03-04 17:28:28.883951500 2016-03-04 17:28:28,881 http-nio-2990-exec-227 DEBUG rfuerst 1048x24557x1 39fl15 4.15.43.214,10.85.161.148,127.0.0.1 /secure/project/EditProjectLeadAndDefaultAssignee.jspa [c.a.jira.security.WorkflowBasedPermissionManager] ADMINISTER_PROJECTS permission granted by permission scheme\r\n2016-03-04 17:28:28.883991500 2016-03-04 17:28:28,881 http-nio-2990-exec-227 DEBUG rfuerst 1048x24557x1 39fl15 4.15.43.214,10.85.161.148,127.0.0.1 /secure/project/EditProjectLeadAndDefaultAssignee.jspa [c.a.jira.security.WorkflowBasedPermissionManager] BROWSE_PROJECTS permission granted by permission scheme\r\n2016-03-04 17:28:28.883997500 2016-03-04 17:28:28,881 http-nio-2990-exec-227 DEBUG rfuerst 1048x24557x1 39fl15 4.15.43.214,10.85.161.148,127.0.0.1 /secure/project/EditProjectLeadAndDefaultAssignee.jspa [c.a.jira.security.WorkflowBasedPermissionManager] ADMINISTER_PROJECTS permission granted by permission scheme\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nh3.Workaround\r\nIf you add the user to the {{administrators}} group, they will be able to edit the Project Lead.

We highly value your feedback in all forms, and through suggestions in jira.atlassian.com is not different. We use this channel often to learn the best we can with how customers use JIRA and how we can continue to improve the experience for as many users as possible.\r\n\r\nWe have revisited this issue again recently and wanted to reiterate that there are still currently no plans to implement this suggestion, and it is not currently on any JIRA team\u2019s roadmap at this stage.\r\n\r\nThere are several third party add-ons that solve many of the use cases mentioned below:\r\n* [Profields|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.deiser.jira.profields]\r\n* [JIRA Metadata Plugin|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.osoboo.jira-metadata-plugin]\r\n* [JIRA Project Specific Select Field|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/jira.plugin.projectspecificselectfield.jpssf].\r\n\r\nPlease note that these add-ons are for Server only at this stage. We're looking to improve our JIRA Connect capabilities in the future to enable developers to provide this kind of capacity to Cloud customers, but there are no concrete dates at this stage for the release of these capabilities.\r\n\r\nPlease remember that jira.atlassian.com is one of many inputs for the JIRA roadmap. You can [learn more about our process here|https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/110373/how-does-the-jira-team-use-jira-atlassian-com].\r\n\r\nI understand that our decision may be disappointing. Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.\r\n\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nKerrod Williams\r\nKerrod (dot) Williams (at) atlassian (dot) com\r\nProduct Manager, JIRA\r\n\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\n*Original request description:*\r\n\r\nAs JIRA Administrator I need the ability to create custom fields for project in pretty much the same way as for issues.

We highly value your feedback in all forms, and through suggestions in jira.atlassian.com is not different. We use this channel often to learn the best we can with how customers use JIRA and how we can continue to improve the experience for as many users as possible.\r\n\r\nWe have revisited this issue again recently and wanted to reiterate that there are still currently no plans to implement this suggestion, and it is not currently on any JIRA team\u2019s roadmap at this stage.\r\n\r\nThere are several third party add-ons that solve many of the use cases mentioned below:\r\n* [Profields|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.deiser.jira.profields]\r\n* [JIRA Metadata Plugin|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.osoboo.jira-metadata-plugin]\r\n* [JIRA Project Specific Select Field|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/jira.plugin.projectspecificselectfield.jpssf].\r\n\r\nPlease note that these add-ons are for Server only at this stage. We're looking to improve our JIRA Connect capabilities in the future to enable developers to provide this kind of capacity to Cloud customers, but there are no concrete dates at this stage for the release of these capabilities.\r\n\r\nPlease remember that jira.atlassian.com is one of many inputs for the JIRA roadmap. You can [learn more about our process here|https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/110373/how-does-the-jira-team-use-jira-atlassian-com].\r\n\r\nI understand that our decision may be disappointing. Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.\r\n\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nKerrod Williams\r\nKerrod (dot) Williams (at) atlassian (dot) com\r\nProduct Manager, JIRA\r\n\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\n*Original request description:*\r\n\r\nAs JIRA Administrator I need the ability to create custom fields for project in pretty much the same way as for issues. This way I will be able to store additional information per project and search for projects and issues based on these additional criteria.",

Problem Definition\r\n\r\nThe Base URL Health Check in JIRA makes an HTTP request to the base URL. However, in some scenarios, the request will get caught in a circular reference to itself due to redirects in the SSO and SAML configuration.\r\n\r\nThe following appears in {{atlassian-jira.log}}:\r\n{code:java}\r\n2017-01-02 14:15:57,020 SupportHealthCheckThread-4 ERROR ServiceRunner     [c.a.j.p.healthcheck.support.BaseUrlHealthCheck] An error occurred when performing the Base URL healthcheck: \r\norg.apache.http.client.ClientProtocolException\r\n\tat org.apache.http.impl.client.InternalHttpClient.doExecute(InternalHttpClient.java:186)\r\n\tat org.apache.http.impl.client.CloseableHttpClient.execute(CloseableHttpClient.java:82)\r\n\tat org.apache.http.impl.client.CloseableHttpClient.execute(CloseableHttpClient.java:107)\r\n\tat org.apache.http.impl.client.CloseableHttpClient.execute(CloseableHttpClient.java:55)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.jira.plugins.healthcheck.support.BaseUrlHealthCheck.doCheck(BaseUrlHealthCheck.java:52)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.jira.plugins.healthcheck.support.AbstractSupportHealthCheck.check(AbstractSupportHealthCheck.java:27)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.support.healthcheck.impl.PluginSuppliedSupportHealthCheck.check(PluginSuppliedSupportHealthCheck.java:41)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.support.healthcheck.thread.HealthCheckCallable.call(HealthCheckCallable.java:32)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.support.healthcheck.thread.HealthCheckCallable.call(HealthCheckCallable.java:15)\r\n\tat java.util.concurrent.FutureTask.run(FutureTask.java:266)\r\n\tat java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.runWorker(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:1142)\r\n\tat java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor$Worker.run(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:617)\r\n\tat java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:745)\r\nCaused by: org.apache.http.client.CircularRedirectException: Circular redirect to 'base-url/jira'\r\n\tat org.apache.http.impl.client.DefaultRedirectStrategy.getLocationURI(DefaultRedirectStrategy.java:176)\r\n\tat org.apache.http.impl.client.DefaultRedirectStrategy.getRedirect(DefaultRedirectStrategy.java:220)\r\n\tat org.apache.http.impl.execchain.RedirectExec.execute(RedirectExec.java:121)\r\n\tat org.apache.http.impl.client.InternalHttpClient.doExecute(InternalHttpClient.java:184)\r\n\t... 12 more\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nh5. Environment:\r\n * JIRA, listening on a context path of {{https://base-url/jira/}}\r\n * A SAML/SSO product responding to {{https://base-url/saml/}}\r\n\r\nh5.Diagnosis\r\nPerforming a cURL to the base URL shows a redirect loop (extraneous headers stripped for clarity):\r\n{code:java}\r\n% curl -I -L https://base-url/jira\r\n\r\nHTTP/1.1 302 Found\r\nDate: Mon, 09 Jan 2017 08:52:28 GMT\r\nServer: Apache\r\nLocation: https://base-url/saml\r\n\r\nHTTP/1.1 302 Moved Temporarily\r\nCache-Control: private\r\nDate: Mon, 09 Jan 2017 08:52:28 GMT\r\nLocation: https://base-url/jira\r\n\r\nHTTP/1.1 302 Found\r\nDate: Mon, 09 Jan 2017 08:52:28 GMT\r\nServer: Apache\r\nLocation: https://base-url/saml\r\n\r\nHTTP/1.1 302 Moved Temporarily\r\nCache-Control: private\r\nDate: Mon, 09 Jan 2017 08:52:28 GMT\r\nLocation: https://base-url/jira\r\n\r\nHTTP/1.1 302 Found\r\nDate: Mon, 09 Jan 2017 08:52:28 GMT\r\nServer: Apache\r\nLocation: https://base-url/saml\r\n\r\nHTTP/1.1 302 Moved Temporarily\r\nCache-Control: private\r\nDate: Mon, 09 Jan 2017 08:52:28 GMT\r\nLocation: https://base-url/jira\r\n{code}\r\nIn the scenario this issue is derived from, the customer had whitelisted calls to the REST API to not go through the SAML/SSO configuration. This means that while gadgets worked correctly, the Health Check failed due to the circular reference.\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nUpdate the check to query the gadget spec URL instead of the base URL, and rename it appropriately.\r\n\r\nAlternatively for customers who are not able to make the modifications to exclude all requests from JIRA, it'd be great to either allow or just test an extra URL, either in addition to or instead of the current URL for testing which is the base URL.\r\n\r\nBeing able to detect circular redirects or too many redirects would also be a really good improvement to this health check.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\nFor customers who do not wish to see or be alerted by the failing health check, you can take the following steps:\r\n # Go to Manage Add-ons\r\n # Select All add-ons and search for \"Instance Health Plugin\"\r\n # Expand the plugin and then expand the modules\r\n # Disable {{jira.healthcheck.baseurl.name}}",
