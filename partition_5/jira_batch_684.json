      "description": "h3. Summary\r\n\r\nWhen opening pages in JIRA such as the dashboard or issues, the initial GET on the Dashboard.jspa or the issue can take considerable periods of time, for example greater than 10s.\r\n\r\nWhen there is a change in the Crowd directory (for example, logging in, synchronisation and so on), the Add-on Manager (UPM) clears the agent count cache. As a result of this when code references this cache it must be rebuilt each time. This can cause significant performance problems in JIRA as the construction of pages references Service Desk code to determine which URLs should be added.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n# Setup a large instance with JIRA Service Desk and a large number of users.\r\n# Load a page.\r\n# Make a change to a user in Crowd (such as logging in).\r\n# Reload the page.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nThe page loads quickly.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nPage loads, such as GET on a issue or dashboard can take greater than 10s.\r\n\r\nh3. Fix\r\n\r\nUpgrading the Add-on Manager (UPM) to 2.18.5 or higher will resolve this problem. This can be done by browsing to the Manage Add-ons page and selecting upgrade.\r\n\r\nh3. Verification\r\n\r\nTaking thread dumps as per [Generate a Thread Dump|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Generating+a+Thread+Dump] during periods of slow responsiveness in JIRA will display threads similar to the ones below. An easy way to parse them to find if this is a problem can be searching for the following:\r\n\r\n{noformat}\r\ngrep -c GlobalPermissionUserCountCacheImpl.resetAll *\r\nthread_dump_20150831_01.txt:2\r\nthread_dump_20150831_02.txt:11\r\nthread_dump_20150831_03.txt:12\r\nthread_dump_20150831_04.txt:2\r\nthread_dump_20150831_05.txt:11\r\nthread_dump_20150831_06.txt:2\r\nthread_dump_20150831_07.txt:3\r\nthread_dump_20150831_08.txt:8\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nA higher number of threads consistently can indicate this is a problem.

Summary\r\nWhen the customer creates a version, either in JIRA or JIRA Agile board, after deleting this version, all issues using it as fix or affected version will still have a reference to it in the database. \r\n\r\nThis results in some incorrect JQL searches for Fix Versions or Affected Versions. For example, if an issue ABC-123 had only the 'version1' as its fix version and this one is deleted (doesn't have a fix version anymore), this search won't return the issue when it should:\r\n{code}\r\nfixVersion is empty\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nSince that was the only fix version the issue had, now it should be null or empty, but the search fails as there's still a reference to the old version in the database.\r\n\r\nThis is also happening to affected versions.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Have a project in JIRA\r\n# Create a version (either in the board in case of Agile or not) and an issue \r\n# Add the version as the issue's fixVersion (or affectedVersion)\r\n# Delete the version _without removing it as the fixVersion (or affectedVersion) in the issue itself_:\r\n#* Go to the versions page in the project\r\n#* Click '...' >> 'Delete' >> 'Delete' \r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n# This JQL search should return the issue, as it was the only fixVersion:\r\n{code}\r\nfixVersion is empty\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nThough the fixVersion is no longer visible in the issue, the following JQL won't return it even if it was the only fixVersion and it should:\r\n{code}\r\nfixVersion is empty\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nWhen deleting the version, even though the warning says the links will be removed, they're not completely.\r\n \r\nh3. Notes\r\nThough the fixVersion/affectedVersion is not shown, there's still an entry in the 'nodeassociation' table to the non-existing version. They can all be found with these searches:\r\nFor FixVersion:\r\n{code:sql}\r\nselect distinct(n.sink_node_id) as fix_version_id from project p, jiraissue i, nodeassociation n where n.source_node_id = i.id and p.id = i.project and n.sink_node_id not in (select id from projectversion) and n.association_type = 'IssueFixVersion' order by fix_version_id asc;\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nFor AffectedVersion:\r\n{code:sql}\r\nselect distinct(n.sink_node_id) as affected_version_id from project p, jiraissue i, nodeassociation n where n.source_node_id = i.id and p.id = i.project and n.sink_node_id not in (select id from projectversion) and n.association_type = 'IssueVersion' order by affected_version_id asc;\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nThis was replicated in JIRA Cloud instances, but there are reports in JIRA Server instances as well.\r\n\r\nh3.Workaround\r\n*JIRA Server instances*\r\n# Search for the orphan links as per above and copy their IDs\r\n# Remove it directly from the database using the IDs found in the search above\r\n#* Fix Versions:\r\n{code:sql}\r\ndelete from nodeassociation where association_type = 'IssueFixVersion' and sink_node_id in (<list of IDs>);\r\n{code}\r\n#* Affected Versions:\r\n{code:sql}\r\ndelete from nodeassociation where association_type = 'IssueVersion' and sink_node_id in (<list of IDs>);\r\n{code}\r\n# Reindex JIRA to be sure the changes are applied\r\n# To avoid this in the future, bulk edit issues to remove the fix/affected versions before deleting versions.\r\n\r\n*Cloud instances*\r\n# Open a support request at [Atlassian Support|https://support.atlassian.com] to have this workaround be applied",

Summary\r\nIn our [Connecting to an LDAP Directory|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Connecting+to+an+LDAP+Directory] documentation, we have the following description for the *Default Group Memberships*: \r\n{quote}\r\nThe first time a user logs in, their group memberships will be checked. If the user does not belong to the specified group(s), their username will be added to the group(s). If a group does not yet exist, it will be added locally. On subsequent logins, the username will not be added automatically to any groups. This change in behaviour allows users to be removed from automatically-added groups. In Confluence 3.5 and 3.5.1, they would be re-added upon next login. \r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nHowever, if the first login attempt for the user is not successful (e.g. typing the wrong pass), then the user will never be able to login unless an admin updates the user group membership.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Connect JIRA to an LDAP server as per [Connecting to an LDAP Directory|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Connecting+to+an+LDAP+Directory], using the settings below:\r\n#* LDAP Permissions: *Read Only, with Local Groups*\r\n#* Default Group Memberships: *jira-users*\r\n# After the directory is synchronized, try to login with an LDAP user, but typing the wrong password.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nThe user should be able to authenticate normally so that after the first login it is added to the {{jira-users}} group.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nAny subsequent login (even with the right password) will fail.\r\n\r\nh3.Workaround\r\n* If this problem has happened only with small number of users, the easiest way to resolve it is by logging in as an JIRA System Administrator and manually add the users to the {{jira-users}} group.\r\n* If this problem is affecting several users, you may consider one of the options below:\r\n*# *Manage JIRA access on LDAP / Active Directory directly* by creating a group similar to the {{jira-users}} group there and adding all relevant users to these groups.\r\n*# *Creating a new User Directory* so that the users on the new directory won't have any login information and hence would be added to the {{jira-users}} on their first login.",

This seems to be a missing functionality at the moment, and are not configurable at the moment.\r\n* Inconsistency of configuration as if through Create Issue Screen Popup, user have configured custom-fields-visibility, when access the create issue screen from a URL link will remove this custom-fields-visibility setup\r\n* To access the URL : https://<your jira URL>/secure/CreateIssueDetails!init.jspa?pid=1234&issuetype=6 , change PID with appropriate project ID and issue type.\r\n!URL_access_createissue_popup1.png|thumbnail!\r\n!URL_access_createissue_popup.png|thumbnail!\r\n!URL_access_createissue.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\n{quote}\r\nThis is needed in order to retain the user preference for the fields on the Create Issue Screen. When we try to create issue using link, Jira looses the custom field preference by the user on the create issue screen and displays all the fields on the screen. Which is annoying for the users who do not want to see all the fileds or all the fields are not useful for users and they have hidden those fileds from screen. It is not necessary to have \"Configure Field\" button on the screen while creating an issue from link, but Jira must retain the field preference and should only show the fileds which are selected by user through Configure Fields option.\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\n\r\nh2. Suggested Solution\r\n* To introduce this button in the 'Create Issue Screen that is access by URL' so that consistency can be achieved here.\r\n* To ensure the user preference for the fields on the Create Issue Screen via Screen Popup coexist on the Create Issue Screen via URL",

Problem Definition\r\nCurrently, the [Search Request View|https://developer.atlassian.com/static/connect/docs/latest/modules/jira/search-request-view.html] module returns a 403 Forbidden error when attempting to export more than 1000 issues. \r\n\r\nThe issue number export limitation is well known per [CLOUD-6544|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CLOUD-6544]. However, plug-ins developed to leverage this module return a 403 when a user is trying to export a search with more than 1000 issues with plug-in specific exporting options created with the search request view module. The 403 error may cause the user to assume the plug-in has failed in some way rather than JIRA enforcing a documented limitation.\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\nIt would be better if JIRA could send the plug-in the control and, as long as the maxIssues parameter is set for the search request view module, the issue export restriction can be managed.",

This is undesirable on certain circumstances.\r\n\r\nh5. Suggestion\r\nThe idea is to provide aliases for project keys. For instance assume you have the process of having two distinct projects in JIRA for a single project \"Foo\". One for development and one after the project was released:\r\n\r\nProject key: FOO (for released builds)\r\nProject key: FOODEV (for development builds)\r\n\r\nBefore the project goes live, you only set-up the FOODEV project in JIRA.\r\n\r\nIt would be great if you could specify a project key alias to FOODEV called FOO which can then be used to look-up FOODEV issues as long as the alias is active.\r\nAt the point the project is released you can then remove the alias and add a FOO-project.\r\n\r\nThe net outcome is that all your employees will always work with the \"FOO\" project key and it will automatically use the FOODEV-project during the early development phase while later it will automatically use the FOO-project.\r\n\r\nNo more need to rectify the long project key names for administrators.",

Problem Definition\r\nIt's currently not possible to easily change the order in which you would like Stash Servers to be displayed on the \"Where do you want to create the branch\" dialog screen for Creating Branch in JIRA, especially when you have multiple Stash Servers. The screen only allows a maximum of 3 Stash Applications to be displayed at once, but allows you to scroll to find other hidden Stash Servers. Sometimes even the Primary Stash Server configured is hidden in the bottom of this list.\r\n\r\nProblem is that the visibility of Servers that are at the bottom of the list and need to be scrolled to reach is quite low, so this becomes an inconvenience when your mostly used Stash Server is always hidden by default from the screen until you scroll to reach it.\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\nImplement more intuitive arrangement order for Stash Servers in the \"Where do you want to create the branch\" dialog screen.\r\n* One way to do this is to allow the Stash Servers to appear in the same order set in the Application Navigator.\r\n",

Summary\r\nConfluence's external macros from JIRA and JIRA Agile aren't working (existing ones) and if new ones are added to Confluence pages they're unable to retrieve JIRA's projects and saved filter, a required step of their configuration, which leads to the following error upon an attempt to save it: {color:red}No project or filter specified.{color}\r\nMacros such as _Issue Statistics_ and _Two Dimensional Filter Statistics_.\r\n\r\nh3. *Update*\r\nConfluence is having trouble contacting JIRA whenever an action to fetch JIRA information is required.\r\nIn case the user wants to create an issue in JIRA using Confluence quick issue creation, he/she won't be able to browse the Projects available on JIRA due to a problem with the applink.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Have JIRA and Confluence Cloud on the same instance\r\n# On a Confluence page add the _Two Dimensional Filter Statistics_ macro\r\n# Search for the JIRA's project or saved filter\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nA drop-down list of available JIRA project or saved filter should appear according to what was typed\r\n\r\nh3.
