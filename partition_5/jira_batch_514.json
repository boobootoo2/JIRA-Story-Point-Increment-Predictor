This is a problem as some inbound emails form services or certain email clients such as monitoring services, phone systems, etc. may come into Jira with the \"Content-Disposition\" header value of \"inline\" or \"voice-message\".\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\nAllow support for all valid \"Content-Disposition\" header values.\r\n\r\nh3. Why this is important\r\nJira is not adding any attachments to newly created tickets or presenting inline media within tickets.\r\n \r\nh3. Workaround \r\n* Forward the original email to a \"conventional\" user mailbox which then forwards on to Jira - the aim is to change the \"Content-Disposition\" header value to \"attachment\"\r\n* Try to change the \"Content-Disposition\" header on the original outbound email, some services may have options to configure the outbound email headers",
