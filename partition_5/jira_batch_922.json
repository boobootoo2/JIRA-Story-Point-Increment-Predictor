This behaviour is to restrictive because this makes it very complicated to display a mix of different issue types with all important information (columns). When I select to display a custom field X and the search criteria is more general and includes also issue types which haven't the custom field X this column isn't displayed. This behaviour makes it necessary to create much more filters as normally needed and as result we are unable to create one view with all needed information.\r\n\r\nI guess it is very easy to show also columns (when selected for view) which are not part of every issue type - in the affected case as empty cells.",

This is weird because when an issue gets to a certain state, it often has to be auto-assigned the The Guy In Charge first who will decide what to do next. (E.g. if an issue gets to \"To Be Regressed\", it should be assigned to QA Lead first (automatically), and then reassigned by the lead to a particular resource.)\r\n\r\nWhat would be nice to have from this standpoint is: \r\n\r\n- Capability to define a \"Default Member\" / \"Lead\" of a Group \r\n- A post-function to auto-assign issue to a Lead of specified Group (selected from a dropdown list) \r\n\r\nThe \"Assign to Group\" plugin does not qualify because it requires explicitly specifying the Group Lead in transition properties which's a maintenance problem. Defining users and groups must be located entirely in User Management section, else evey time a group lead is hired/fired, the admin would have to swicth workflows (which may take up to hours if the databse is big enough) and modify every certain transition to change the user defined there. \r\n",

In this case we set the Field to optional in the \"Field Configuration\". When the Issue follows a workflow path where the Issue will be fixed then the FixedVersion must be always required. Now we can make the Field value required in the \"Step Transition\" Validator but when a user selects a \"standard\" JIRA action (i.e. Edit) then the FixedVersion field is optional again and can be set to \"NUL\". The next step validation will fail because the field value is not set.\r\nActually it makes more sense to associate the Conditions,Validators and Functions with the \"Step\" because many \"Transitions\" can lead to a step, but the \"Step\" occurs only once. \"Transitions\" configurations that lead to the same \"Step\" are redundent if the configuration is defined in the Step. The \"Edit\" and \"Bulk Edit\" actions would then also refer to the configuration of the \"Step\". This would also solve the problem applying \"Conditions\" to the \"Create Issue\" action.\r\n ",

Not all people have the rights to migrate solutions to the next test stage or even the production system. So it would be nice to be able to assign issues to the corresponding \"migrator\" for the specific server. Having manually editable lists here is not a really good solution.

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-13575].\n  {panel}\n\nWe recently had a severe issue where our mail service was giving us lots of warnings in the log file and it was intermittently creating JIRA tasks. Sometime it would create a task and sometimes it wouldn't, and the log files didn't give us enough info to point us in the right direction. The problem was a typo in the \"handler parameters.\" We had \"reportusername\" instead of \"reporterusername\" and we had lots of difficulty discovering this.\r\n\r\nThis enhancement request is, first, to make all handler parameters into either select lists, radio buttons, or text boxes, etc. This way the parameter name and syntax doesn't have to be \"known\" by the user and doesn't have to be looked up in the documentation. Currently, the \"Handler,\" \"Uses SSL,\" and \"Server\" parameters are select lists, so please continue that format for all other parameters. Thus, it will be much more user friendly and less error prone.\r\n\r\nBy the way, the \"Uses SSL\" could be a radio button, since there are only two options. How about \"SSL: Yes    No\".\r\n\r\nNext, check each parameter value with JavaScript (or the like), so that invalid values aren't stored. In other words, the \"delay\" is already checked to make sure that it's numeric. Other values should be the same. It could be that if all other values are controlled, then there won't be any checking necessary.\r\n\r\nThe implementation of this will almost make a service bullet and fool proof. Thanks!\r\n",
