In my eyes it would be helpful to draw the active repository persitently within a different coloured box (green for example) - or choose a different text style (italic), size (slightly larger?) ... or... or ...\r\n* Make the active branch within the branch list (left side of file status tab) more prominent (Surronding green box? Different font attributes (size, color, style?)?, different coloured branch or tag icon? ...)\r\n\r\nI think this makes Sourcetree more ergonomic: you start \"reading\" on the left side: you can easily identify the active repository (if it would be recognizable within the bookmarks) - then you can easily identify the branch you are currently on (you already can do it now - but it's not noticeable enough in my eyes ...).

I would be good if you can choose lists of bookmarks locations really.  I like to sync my laptop to my desktop.  The folder locations of the repos are the same for both so they are a mirror ad I can now already just copy the bookmark.xml from one to the other, but if I could keep it in a central location, I can skip the copy paste stuff and both will sync up. I have quickly made a mockup of the display to help make it clear how I mean it can works and would be great for us that switch machines a lot. can't imagine it being to hard of a request.
