Perhaps it is there, and I've just missed it.  I find no documentation on setting up an environment in which JIRA can be used effectively.  Such a document should include things like \"search the bug list before submitting a new one\", etc. etc.  All the typical procedures that all your customers will have to put into place.  \n\nWriting this stuff, and making it available (perhaps with a license: you may use this documentation if you have a license for JIRA), would make even more managers want to buy your product - it makes our lives easier.  Of course, we will want to adapt the documentation, but these kinds of guidelines are pretty general and embraced by most that use this kind of product.  I am a strong believer in reuse.  It strikes me that all of your customers are doing something similar here.  Prime refactoring material.\"",

As some of you have already noticed, 7.6 was released yesterday, and you can download it\u00a0[here|https://pl.atlassian.com/software/jira/download].\r\n\r\n*What we've built*\r\n\r\nAs mentioned in our previous update, after research, spikes, and user interviews, we've decided that introducing Priority schemes is the best solution for our customers. This feature uses a well-known administrative mechanism, and maintains a consistent experience.\r\n\r\n*Further improvements*\r\n\r\nWe've put a lot of effort into delivering Priority schemes as early as possible to make it for the 15th anniversary. We've decided that some further improvements will be added after the Jira 7.6 release. These will include: REST APIs to manage priority schemes, the ability to copy the priority schemes, as well as some minor UI improvements. We're planning to release them in the following Jira version (most likely 7.7).\r\n\r\n*Jira Service Desk*\r\n\r\nWe've been working closely with the Jira Service Desk team to understand the impact of Priority schemes on customers using Service Desk projects. We wanted to make sure that these customers receive the best experience when Priority schemes are introduced.\r\nTo achieve this goal, we've identified further work, and are scoping it specifically for Jira Service Desk.\r\nTo make this feature available for Jira Core and Jira Software customers as quickly as possible, we've decided to release it without the support for Service Desk projects. What it means is that admins will not be able to associate a priority scheme with a Service Desk project in the first version.\r\nThis capability will be released independently by the Jira Service Desk team. Tracked in JSDSERVER-1374\r\n\r\n*Resolutions per issue type*\r\n\r\nWe're re-adding the previous update on Resolutions per issue type here so that it's not lost in the stream of comments on this suggestion. \r\nResolutions per issue type is really a separate feature request which we'll prioritise independently. In order to track it properly, we've created a separate suggestion purely for Resolutions per issue type here:\u00a0JRASERVER-65924.\r\nIn hindsight we should have separated the two a long time ago, but we promise we will use all the comments around resolutions from this suggestion in the design of the feature, so no need to put the same comments, just make sure to vote and watch the issue! We will provide further updates in there.\r\n\r\nYou can read more details regarding Priority schemes and other capabilities that we added in Jira Software 7.6\u00a0[here|https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirasoftware/jira-software-7-6-x-release-notes-938027181.html].\r\nAs always, we would love to hear your feedback so feel free to reach out to me directly, or post a comment in this suggestion.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nJakub Lazinski\r\nProduct Manager, Jira Server\r\n{panel}\r\n*Original request description:*\r\n\r\nAs a JIRA Administrator I need more granular configuration for my projects:\r\n # I want to be able to specify different priorities for different projects instead of having a global priority list. The current global priority can be used as a default, but I would like to be able to change them per project.\r\n # Depending on the issue type, the resolution may be different. For example: in case of bugs, the resolution may be set to \"fixed\", but in case of improvements there is nothing to fix and the resolution should rather be \"implemented\". I need to be able to specify the default resolution separately per each issue type.\r\n\r\n*Potential Workarounds:*\r\n There are some workarounds that can provide some solutions to this issue:\r\n * [Custom fields|http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Adding+a+Custom+Field] for priorities and resolutions can be used on a per-project basis.\r\n * Customizing velocity templates to limit the visible priorities and resolutions per project, similar to what's [posted below|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRA-3821?focusedCommentId=212921&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-212921] (though this approach does not apply for JIRA Cloud customers).",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-3803].\n  {panel}\n\nRunning an open JIRA installation or an huge in house installation with a lot of issues the maintenance of the issues cost a lot of time and it is not easy at all.\n\nIn general you have to go through all the issues and clean up all issues every couple of weeks. You or the project lead have to relate issues and close any duplicates and so on.\n\nA logical issue checker (LIC) can improve the life of this person. The LIC can perform a lot of checks which can not be provided by the common filter functionality. The following checks are possible:\n\n1) Issues with Status = Closed and Resolution = Duplicate\na) These issues should have a linked \"duplicates\" issue. => Otherwise the resolution \"Duplicate\" doesn't make sense.\nb) The Fix Version field should be empty. => Otherwise a lot of same issues would be appear in a release note which makes no sense. Or different \"Fix Versions\" in several duplicated issues would mismatch the road map.\n\n2) Issues with Status = Closed and Resolution = Fixed\na) The \"Fix Version\" should be set with a specific release version otherwise no one knows in which release the issue was closed. Sometimes a \"Fix Version\" will never be set (e.g. using JIRA as a ticketing system), so this check should be optional.\nb) Linked issues of type \"incorporates\" or \"is part of\" should have the same \"Fix Version\"s or at least one same \"Fix Version\". Otherwise why could this issue be fixed, while incorporated issues aren't fixed or not in the same release (\"Fix Version\").\n\n3) Further ideas are welcome.\n\n\nThese checks maybe very project specific hence everybody has to decide to enable them or only enable some of the checks in his project.\n\nThe \"Logical Issue Checker\" should be a new \"Permission Type\", which is associated to the \"JIRA Administrators\" by default. I think the \"Logical Issue Checker\" is an enhanced filter functionality which is not covered by common filter in the \"Find Issue\" menu. The enhanced filter functionality should have the same benefits like the common filters, e.g. bulk edit. The functionality should be extendable by a new JiraService (e.g. LICService), so that any person can implement its own checks. Furthermore the project administrators can enable and disable the different check services, because not each service is relevant for a project.\n",

We do hope to address JIRA's notification system with more customizable notifications, but the improvements we are seeking to make are more accurately described in JRA-2565. We have no plans to introduce additional scripting capabilities.\r\n\r\nAs always, please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nDave Meyer\r\nProduct Manager, JIRA Platform\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\nthe notification scheme stuff is very cool, but could be better.\r\n\r\non several occasions now, I've wanted something where a notification would be sent in certain situations, but I'm unable to express the situations using a scheme.  in particular, although I can trigger a notification on issue create, I can't say \"trigger on issue create, if the issue is in component X, and was not created by user Y\".\r\n\r\nit's hard to see a simple way of enabling this from the GUI.\r\n\r\nhere's one possibility.  allow the list of notification triggers to be edited.  instead of having a single \"issue created\" trigger, with some number of notifications attached to it, allow any number of \"issue created\" triggers.  each trigger could have an optional attribute, which is  a boolean valued expression in some simple language.  the notifications for the trigger would fire if the expression evaluated to true in the context of the issue in question.\r\n\r\nso, for example, you could have some number of primitive operators:\r\n\r\n component C  <-- true if the current issue is in component C\r\n reporter R <-- etc.\r\n beforetime T <-- true if the issue was created before time T\r\n \r\nand some boolean connectives, and you're done.  when an issue is created, JIRA looks for all \"issue created\" triggers, executes their condition expressions in the context of the current issue, and fires the notifications if the condition is true.  or better, the \"issue created\" trigger type could just be incorportated into the expression.\r\n\r\nthere are probably other places in JIRA that could use this sort of thing.  listeners, for example, could be configured to fire only for a certain project.\r\n",
