[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-41520].\n  {panel}\n\nHi dear JIRA team!\r\n\r\nFirst of all I would like to describe what I'm doing. I'm extending my extension for the google chrome browser called *jironimo*. Problem I have is that too often JIRA replies with 500 status to a linked ajax query. For example: I'm searching and getting 100 issues and then I'm doing *mypermissions* call for each of them. The purpose is to show the \"play\" button(time-log feature) icon. (reproducible on different JIRA instances)\r\n\r\nWhat I've tried to google is how to get *mypermissions* data withing the *search* call. Something like this: &expand=mypermissions, which is eq. to: mypermissions?issueId=SearchResultIssueId. But I didn't manage to find it. \r\n\r\nCould you complete one of them:\r\n1. Improve the docs, add this section to the rest API if there is an option.\r\n2. Implement this functionality if possible.\r\n\r\nThe positive sides for JIRA project:\r\n1. Less calls to the REST API\r\n2. More logical output of a search result entry\r\n\r\nThank you!",

But since we're stuck with the new one, at least for the time being, I'd like to suggest one specific, simple improvement:\r\n\r\nCurrently, when clicking on any of the menu items (Dashboards, Projects, Issues etc) there's a bit of a lag, and then the menu drops down with a list of options. Only then is one able to get to the desired destination. It drives me absolutely nuts.\r\n\r\nInstead, it would be great if a single click on any of those menu items sent me straight to the last page/view I was viewing within that context. If I want the list instead, I either do a mouseover or hit the arrow.\r\n\r\nExample #1: A click on \"Dashboards\" would get me straight to the last dashboard i was viewing.\r\n\r\nExample #2: A click on \"Issues\" would get me straight to the last filter view\r\n\r\nExample #2: A click on \"Projects\" would get me straight to the last project I was viewing.\r\n\r\nThis tiny fix would make navigating the new menu bar UI so much easier.",

I would like to be able to create workflows that have approval steps requiring approval from multiple users. For example in an issue type 'product change request' the workflow might require an approval from at least one user in the QA management group, at least one user in the Engineering group, at least on user in the production management group, and the CEO. For another issue type 'QC procedure change' the workflow might require an approval stage only requiring one user in the QA management group. This would really extend the useful capabilities of Jira OnDemand and make it useful to our organisation. In fact as a recent subscriber to the OnDemand service I am surprised and a bit disappointed not to find this level of functionality.\r\n\r\nI left this comment on issue JRA-6182 but as that is a very old issue and was generated in relation to an older installed version of JIRA i though it sensible to create the issue afresh.\r\n\r\nI notice that the issue has been resolved for customers using the installed version of JIRA via an add-on \"Group Sign-Off for JIRA\".

The link take them to apage not found error on https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/AOD/JIRA+OnDemand?utm_campaign=qAwr63Ru&utm_medium=navbar&utm_source=inproduct. Even though the correct link is directly below this error it has already caused a bit of confusion with some evaluators.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nMarian",

However, according to AOD-41704, this feature is not available in OnDemand instances because it uses crowd for user management (and not \"internal directory with LDAP Authentication\" / \"delegated LDAP\"). Therefore, it is only available in JIRA Standalone. \n\nThis would be helpful as an attribute for any user, whether it is using Crowd or for separate instances as it provides a much cleaner approach to administrators to turning off users if they are not able to delete them; often, the latter is not possible as most contribute at least once within the product. \n\nCurrently, in OnDemand, a user must remove the application links, change the user's password, and change the email address to something else (we put it as an invalid email).   It would be cleaner and safer, from a security standpoint to avoid missing a step, if inactivation were available and it guaranteed that the user could not login and they would not receive emails associated with any watches or subscriptions they have.  The latter is a huge security hole if information is shared that the user should not have access to. ",

We have custom issue types for requirements and for specifications, each of which has custom workflows. Everything works well except for links.\r\n\r\nI have a state in the workflows called \"Approved\" where I set jira.issue.editable=false. This locks all fields of the issue except the links. \r\n\r\nUnder normal circumstances it is good to leave open the ability to edit links after an issue is rendered uneditable with the above flag. However, for traceability and consistency of our system for an ISO auditor it would be great if there was an extra property to set on a state like: jira.issue.linkseditable=false. This would allow us to force a user to open an issue in order to change links. This in turn would allow the workflow to properly reset all of the \"review\" fields we maintain that allow us to communicate which parts of the issue need review before it can again be approved.\r\n",

Benefits\r\n{panel}\r\n * Team members receive constant non-intrusive guidance, on how best to use certain fields, every time they create an issue. e.g. teams using Gherkin syntax for Stories, could be reminded of this by 'As...When...Then' placeholder text in Summary field.\r\n * Different teams working on different projects retain flexibility to follow their different processes.\r\n * Non-intrusive way to remind team members to follow chosen conventions/best practices.\r\n * Placeholder text is better than default text, as it doesn't require deleting or editing of default text. Team members can just click/tab into fields and immediately start typing.\r\n * Allows admins to also offer guidance on use of fields such as Summary, and other project-specific custom free-text fields.{panel}\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n{panel}\r\nIt's possible to add a script into the field description (note this is disabled by default since Jira 8.7) to add the placeholder:\r\n{code:java}\r\n<script>\r\ndocument.getElementById(\"customfield_10222\").placeholder = \"Type text here..\";\r\n</script>\r\n{code}\r\nJust replace the {{customfield_10222}} by the respective customfield id in the custom field description and in every {{Field Configuration}}\u00a0required.\r\n\r\nAlso note customizations like this should be applied with caution as they may impact other UI aspects and elements.\r\n{panel}",
