There is only \"Reply to me\". Please refer to attachment image named \"emailOptions.png\".\r\n\r\n2. I also find \"Send copy to :\" checkboxes on the \"Email This Issue\" tag, please refer to attachment image named \"sendCopyTo.png\". So if there is really no such \"CC to me\" checkbox on our \"Email options\" tag, could you default check \"Send copy to: me\"? ",

The difference is that AL32UTF8 is more appropriate for XML data.\r\nI would be great if someone could test compatibility between JIRA and this character set encoding, and if it's not, make it compatible.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you need further explanation.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n____________________\r\nFelipe Kraemer\r\nAtlassian Support",

      "description": "Basically when you edit a custom field you invalidate all cached field configuration. This means that it has to be read from the DB again and re-cached. Unfortunately, JIRA will read the configuration for each field individually which can lead to many (thousands) of SQL queries and slow page loads for people using JIRA after the configuration change.\r\n\r\nFor example. I have and instance with 558 custom fields and 771 field configurations. If I edit the description of any custom field these are the >2500 queries (you may need to scroll to see the query count column) that JIRA runs to just show the custom field list. \r\n\r\n!change_description_313.png!\r\n\r\nIf I then goto the issue navigator I run the following queries.\r\n\r\n!view_navigator_313.png!\r\n\r\nThis time well over 3000 queries are run (again you may need to scroll to the right to see the column). If I then re-load the issue navigator then no SQL queries are run because things are now cached.\r\n\r\nThis number of queries can cause significant delays even on very fast database servers. Some pages can take 5-10 seconds to load after a field configuration change. This causes significant pain to users who change their field configuration regularly.\r\n\r\nMaybe JIRA should be eagerly loading the cache  (i.e. all the configuration for all the fields in a single query) rather than lazy loading it (i.e. lots of queries per field configuration) as the configuration will be used in most operations in JIRA. \r\n\r\nThis problem does not appear to be fixed in 4.1 (maybe it got worse). Check out the ~2000 SQL queries executed to view the \"Custom Field Page\" after changing a field description.\r\n\r\n!change_description_41.png!\r\n\r\nFurther, notice the the ~4000 queries executed when viewing the issue navigator for the first time after the description change.\r\n\r\n!view_navigator_41.png! \r\n\r\nAgain if you then view the navigator again no queries are run as all the information is cached.",

We published the REST API documentation for 4.3 and 4.4 releases here:\r\n\r\n* [JIRA REST API documentation 4.3|http://docs.atlassian.com/jira/REST/4.3/]\r\n* [JIRA REST API documentation 4.4|http://docs.atlassian.com/jira/REST/4.4/]\r\n\r\nIn the JIRA 5.0 release we plan to take the JIRA REST API out of beta.  As always, we would love to hear your feedback and comments about this feature. To keep the discussion centralized (both past and present), feel free to comment on this issue with your feedback.\r\n\r\nPlease note that the JIRA 5.0 version of the REST API has changed significantly from the alpha and beta API from previous releases.  The JIRA 5.0 API goes well beyond the read-only API from previous versions.  The new REST API should include {{create, update, delete, search}} for Issues and manipulation of individual issue fields.\r\n\r\n* [JIRA REST API Tutorial|http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/JIRA+REST+API+%28Alpha%29+Tutorial]\r\n* [JIRA REST API documentation 5.0-m3|http://docs.atlassian.com/jira/REST/5.0-m3/]\r\n",

I reccomend to increment issue key only when issue creation is succeful. \r\n\r\nHow this may happen (according to what experienced in JSP-63263)\r\n-We have jira configured with create or comment mail handler and \"forwardTo\" correctly set.\r\n-At a point we had the smtp server down during three days, so no outgoing mail from Jira. \r\n-During these period we have recived (at least) one incoming email producing an error at the issue creation time (related to a mySql DB ecoding issue)\r\n-in this case normally Jira pops the email from the mailbox and sends a \"EMAIL HANDLER: Error handling:\" notification\r\n-it seems that being impossible to send the notification (smtp down) jira leaves the incoming email in the mailbox and therefore it tries again one minute after to create the issue, incrementing each time the issue key (I suppose this because if you look at the main gap in JSP-63263 (MMSHD-5757 vs. MMSHD-632) you have ( 5757-632=5125 ) / 1440 (minutes per day) = 3.5 days. That is exactly the duration of the smtp sever downtime.)\r\n\r\nthis is very annoyng because for the final user the impression is that the number of issues has explosed and the system is unstable\r\n\r\nI reccomend to increment issue key only when issue creation is succeful. \r\n\r\n ",

Please add an id (id=\"xxx\") to all html elements in Jira that are used when users can create issues.\r\n\r\nI have (in various projects) customized Jira to prevent certain issue types from being visible to certain users. In 3.x this was easy for example with editing secure\\views\\createissue-start.jsp and adding a javascript that hides the element from the options list for certain users. In Jira 4.x this still works, but there are 2 new create issue places - both of which do not allow for equally easy customization.

      "description": "Hi Atlassian,\r\n\r\nWhen i search issues in JIRA i often note CPU spikes on the server, especially on a VMWare guest. I guess this is caused by the Lucence search engine. \r\nFor this reason I wondered if indexing and searching could not be offloaded to a remote dedicated index server like Solr. Probably it would not be too difficult to use Solr instead of Lucene since Solr is a superset of Lucene regarding the search query syntax. \r\n\r\nAnother advantage would be that one can better scale with distributed Solr servers and also one obstacle towards a clustered JIRA installation would also be taken since the the index files are not local to a JIRA server anymore.\r\n\r\nProbably one could also address the problem that JIRA isn't available during indexing but i must confess that i currently don't know how to do that with Solr. For large installations it is really annoying to see JIRA unavailable while it is reindexing since a lot of users are affected.\r\n\r\nWhat about this idea? \r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nDieter",
