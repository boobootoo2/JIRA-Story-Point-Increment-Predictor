So far so good. Please observe screenshot 'origin.png'.\r\n\r\nIn here you will see that as part of all my branches, branch 'master' is to be pushed to remote branh 'master'. This is what is expected, as my local branch master tracks 'origin/master'. Now please observe screenshot 'project.png'.\r\n\r\nIn this screenshot, I've selected 'project' as the remote to push to. However, instead of 'project' pushing to remote branch 'project/master', it seems that the dialog is suggesting that 'master' will be pushed to 'project/master'. That sounds dangerous, but frankly I have no idea what that would do, if it would do anything at all.\r\n\r\nI would expect 'project' to push to 'project/master' and 'master' to not push at all, to this origin.

The registration dialogue insisted that brent+bbk etc was an invalid email address. So:\r\n\r\n1. It's wrong. Read the RFC - + is a perfectly valid character before the @-sign in an email address.\r\n\r\n2. As a result, I've given you my longborough@outlook.com, which is my general purpose emails-here-don't-matter email for any old commercial entreprise that happens to need my email.\r\n\r\n3. That's fine for me, but I hope you can see that from your point of view I'm now somewhat less engaged with Atlassian than if I had been using my 'real' email address.\r\n\r\nFor me, this is a trivial bug, and I have created it as such (even though many, many organisations manage to irritate me with this incorrect restriction). But you may feel that you would like to cherish our relationship more.\r\n\r\nThanks for accepting my boring you.\r\nKind regards,\r\nBrent  ",

To support hgsubversion requires the installation of a Subversion client and the Python bindings to support this. Right now there's no simple way to do this on Windows, it's quite a fiddly process requiring sizeable extra downloads & configuration. On Mac it's easier because OS X comes with both Subversion and Python out of the box.\r\n\r\nSince the user base for hgsubversion is quite a lot smaller than git-svn, we have split this task out and just supported git-svn for now. If there's enough demand we may consider adding hgsubversion support later.",
