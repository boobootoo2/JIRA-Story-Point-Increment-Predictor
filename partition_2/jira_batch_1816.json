The most obvious place they appear (and it's not very obvious) is way at the bottom of the Dashboard. Nowhere else are they readily accessible.\r\n\r\nUser favourites could be so much more useful!  Why not add a dropdown menu to the header that lists them?  Or add them to a sub-menu under the user menu (not as good as user experience, however)?\r\n\r\nYes, we could create a plugin, but the favourities feature seems core to the product, and is relatively useless currently.\r\n\r\nMaybe there's a straightforward way to do this now w/o the bother of a plugin or without using something as heavy as Builder?\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\n/mcr",

      "description": "Hi,\r\n\r\nwhen I add a PDF attachment to a page, there is a different behaviour depending on the case of the file extension. The only happens when I use Mozilla Firefox, in Opera 10.1 everything works as expected.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n* Attachment with file name {{attachment.pdf}} has content type {{application/pdf} - everything is fine.\r\n* Attachment with file name {{attachment.PDF}} has content type {{text/html}}. I noticed it because the attached file has the default HTML icon instead of the normal PDF icon. Please see the attached screenshot for an example. \r\n\r\nSome other observations:\r\n\r\n* This only happens with Firefox, it works with Opera.\r\n* It only affects PDF files, MS Word files work with uppercase or lowercase extendsion.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if this also has an impact on attachment indexing and if the PDF file with MIME type \"text/html\" gets indexed correctly.\r\n\r\nCan I configure anywhere that .PDF files should have the same MIME type as .pdf files? Or is this configured inside Confluence?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance and kind regards,\r\n\r\nStephan Vollmer\r\n",

Upload attachment checkout plugin. \r\n2. Disable attachment checkout plugin. \r\n3. Verify confluence attachment plugin is enabled. \r\n4. View a wiki page with attachments macro, you will receive a warning \r\n{code}\r\n\"unknown macro - {attachments}\".\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nh4. Workaround\r\n\r\nThe workaround is to disable and re-enable Confluence Attachment plugin:\r\n\r\n# Go to Administration as a Confluence system administrator\r\n# Click on 'Plugins' in the navigation menu on the left hand side\r\n# On the 'Manage Existing' tab, click the link to 'Show System Plugins'\r\n# Search for 'Attachments', and find the 'Confluence Attachments Plugin'\r\n# Click the 'Disable' button to disable the plugin\r\n# Click the 'Enable' button to reenable the plugin.\r\n",

There are two ways to do this:\r\nEither,\r\nGo to the user's Profile and click the 'Administer User' link on the user's profile screen. (This link is available in Confluence 2.8.2 and later.)\r\nOr,\r\nGo to the Confluence 'Administration Console'. To do this:\r\nOpen the 'Browse' menu and select 'Confluence Admin'. The 'Administration Console' view will open.\r\nSelect 'Manage Users' in the left-hand panel.\r\nAll members of the Confluence-Users group are listed in alphabetical order, by first name. To find a user, you can either browse through the pages or do a search on the user's 'mail ID' or the group to which they belong.\r\nClick the user link.\r\nNow you should be able to see the user's current details and links allowing you to edit them. \r\n\r\nClick 'Edit Groups'. This will display two lists of groups:\r\n'Not a member of groups' \u2014 All groups to which the user does not belong. To add the user to a group, select a group and click 'Join'. Hold the Ctrl key down and click to select more than one group. \r\n'Member of groups' \u2014 All groups to which the user belongs. Select a group and click 'Leave' to remove the user from the group.\r\n You cannot use the 'Edit Groups' option to add or remove users in external groups, as Confluence access to LDAP and JIRA groups is read only.\r\n-------------------------------------------------------- End of your instructions-------------------------\r\n\r\nWhen I go to the Manage Users and select a user, I can view their profile but there are no links or buttons to \"Edit Groups\" as your instructions indicate. \r\nSee Screenshots attached.\r\n",

      "description": "I've done a bit of research all documented in https://studio.atlassian.com/browse/AMPS-237\r\n\r\nDuring development, passing through appropriate directories with the {{plugin.resource.directories}} property signals to the plugin framework that changed resources can be read directly from the filesystem.  This allows developers to change things like velocity templates and simply refreshing the page.\r\n\r\nIn Jira, this works great, in confluence, not at all.\r\n\r\nFrom what I can see in the code, the rendering pipeline does not request the resource in the manner the plugin framework expects i.e. {{Plugin.getResource() or Plugin.getResourceAsStream()}}.  At no point during debugging did I find that any of the theme plugin templates or decorators were accessed through this.  So it appears that it may not be just a caching issue for development, but that the rendering code is going around the plugin framework to access the resource (just speculation on my part).\r\n\r\nI mark this bug as critical, because tweaking html in trivial ways in a velocity template only to require a re-build/re-deploy is still painful.  Thank you for dynamic plugins, but it could still be easily better.\r\n\r\nAgain, Jira already works this way, it appears that Confluence is lagging behind on this issue.",
