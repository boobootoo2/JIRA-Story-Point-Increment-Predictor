Summary\r\nThe *Spaces* menu in the top bar has a drop-down which shows each space of the instance. However, when we minimize the window of the browser so that the _Spaces_ item shows inside the *More* drop-down list, the *Spaces* button loses it's drop list.\r\n\r\nThe interesting part here is that if the Spaces menu is working and we minimize it, the list will still show up even though the Spaces button is under *More*. However, if we refresh the page the list is gone. The same happens if the problem is occurring and you maximize the window so that the spaces gets back to the top bar, the problem still happens until the page gets refreshed.\r\n\r\nh3. Environment\r\n* Happens with any browser in any OS.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Open the dashboard page in a browser;\r\n# Check that the Spaces drop-down menu works;\r\n# Minimize the page so that the Spaces button goes under the *More* button, becoming accessible through the More drop-down list;\r\n# Refresh the page\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n* The Spaces button inside the *More* list should show the list of the spaces just like it shows before refreshing the page.\r\n!Working1.png|thumbnail!\r\n!Working2.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n* The Spaces button doesn't have the drop list to show the spaces.\r\n!NotWorking1.png|thumbnail!\r\n!NotWorking2.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nh3. Notes\r\n* There's no error entries in the logs and neither network errors in the developer tools of the browser.\r\n* I noticed that the CSS class is different when the Spaces button is in the top bar compared to when it's under the More button. Thus when we refresh the page the Browser's cache gets overwritten with the new class that doesn't have the drop list.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n# Keep the window big enough so that the Spaces menu doesn't go under the *More* button;\r\n# Zoom out the page so that the Spaces menu doesn't go under the *More* button.",

      "description": "h2. Problem summary\r\nThe functionality which generates a page tree for customized space exports is taking much longer in 5.8, 5.9, and even more so in 5.10. This page tree can be observed at Space Tools > Content Tools > Export > Any Option > Custom Export, with the specific request URL being http://<confluence_url>/spaces/exportspacetree.action?key=SPACEKEY.\r\n\r\nWith a large enough space, the request will time out after hitting a Confluence or proxy server timeout, and prevent users from customizing the space export. Smaller spaces do not run into this issue, but then again there is less need to pick-and-choose pages to export in a smaller space to begin with. Many customers use this feature to export a subset of a large space to PDF, and this performance regression blocks that functionality.\r\n\r\nh2. Speed comparison\r\nSince this issue is about a performance regression since 5.7, we need to compare the load times in each major Confluence version for http://<confluence_url>/spaces/exportspacetree.action?key=SPACEKEY given the same set of data. The below are the times I captured using [Profile Logging|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Troubleshooting+Slow+Performance+Using+Page+Request+Profiling], and also links to XML backups to the datasets I used should someone desire to reproduce for themselves.\r\n\r\nAlso included are screenshots taken using [JProfiler|https://www.ej-technologies.com/products/jprofiler/overview.html] showing a sampling of methods in 5.7, 5.8, and 5.10. This is sorted by average time.\r\n\r\nEach data set is identical in terms of pages. There is a single space (\"FOO\") containing 2023 randomly generated pages that are deeply nested. The credentials to login for is admin/admin:\r\n||Version||Time||XML Backup||Method Avg Times||\r\n|5.7.5|22909 ms|[^conf575.zip]|!conf575_cpu_method_runnable.png|thumbnail!|\r\n|5.8.13|36238ms|[^conf5813.zip]|!conf5813_cpu_method_runnable.png|thumbnail!|\r\n|5.9.9|32865ms|[^conf599.zip]|N/A|\r\n|5.10.3|42128ms|[^conf5103.zip]|!conf5103_cpu_method_runnable.png|thumbnail!|\r\n\r\nFull profile logging results for all versions are available here: [^profiling.txt] \r\n\r\nh2. Steps to reproduce\r\n# Download a version of Confluence you'd like to test\r\n# Create a space and generate at least 2000 pages within (or use a backup XML file above)\r\n# Turn on [Profile Logging|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Troubleshooting+Slow+Performance+Using+Page+Request+Profiling]\r\n# Go to http://<confluence_url>/spaces/exportspacetree.action?key=SPACEKEY\r\n\r\nh2. Workaround\r\nPerform the request to generate the page tree once and wait several minutes. Even if a request times out from the client side the first time, the query is still fully executed on the server (although you won't have any feedback on when it finishes). On subsequent requests, Confluence may use the now-cached query results, thus reducing the time to generate the page tree on a second attempt and allow the request to complete in the UI.\r\n\r\nh2. Notes\r\n* There appears to be 2 performance regressions. One in between 5.7 and 5.8, and another between 5.9. and 5.10. Looking at the methods, it looks like the one between 5.7 and 5.8 may be due to changes in permission checking in regards to Edit and View page restrictions. This is possibly a result of CONF-17523\r\n* Implementing a solution such as CONF-33751 may help so that the entire space's page tree is not loaded at once",

We need to avoid these collections where possible.\r\n\r\nTo briefly explain what this param does - G1GC splits the heap into regions and allocates those regions to Eden, Survivor and Tenured. When an object needs to be promoted from Eden to Survivor (for example), there needs to be enough room in a region which has been allocated to Survivor, or the heap needs to allocate a new region. If all regions are allocated, you get these failures, and you will then see 30s-1m long pauses (or worse).\r\n\r\nThe heap maintains a certain percentage of regions free in order to try to mitigate this scenario - 10% by default. This parameter will bump that up to 20%. On our internal instances this was enough to eliminate to-space allocation failures entirely, and stopped our outages.\u00a0\r\n\r\nFYI, this is the bug I raised with Oracle, which they have fixed for Java 9: [https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8155256]\r\nh3. Diagnosis\r\n\r\nThis parameter is helpful if you are experiencing long to-space allocation pauses in your garbage collection. To determine if this is the case:\r\n # [Enable GC Logging|https://confluence.atlassian.com/confkb/how-to-enable-garbage-collection-gc-logging-300813751.html]\r\n # After a few days, or if you experience any outages, review the GC logs:\r\n -- Download [GC Viewer|https://github.com/chewiebug/GCViewer/wiki/Changelog]\r\n -- Open your GC logs in GC Viewer\r\n -- Click on the Event Details tab\r\n -- Check the pause types you are experiencing. If you have long 'to-space exhausted' pauses, this parameter can help.\r\n !gcviewer.png|height=180!",

      "description": "We recently upgraded our Confluence Server to 5.10.2. Our JIRA install is still at 6.4.13 and we can't upgrade to 7.x due to plugin requirements.

Our previous version of confluence was 5.6 (with as supposed deprecated xmlrpc endpoint) and the IssueLinks was working with with that with the TrustedApps auth mode. Confluence Remote API plugin is still present and enabled and is still trying to respond (throwing that exception) instead throwing a 404 on that URI. That's why I assumed OAuth was the issue. Was this not the case?\r\n\r\nSome more follow up questions:\r\n* Am I understanding correctly that there's no way to set the current version we have of JIRA to use REST instead of XMLRPC for this functionality?\r\n* Does this mean that the change to REST calls from XMLRPC are already on the newer JIRA versions (7.x) or are you saying Issue Links itself is deprecated?\r\n\r\nh3. Update\r\nWe got 5.9.12 running and OAuth seems to be working there with XML RPC with the same settings on the JIRA side. The settings on the confluence side have different options but I think it's comparable.\r\n\r\nThe request/response tcpdump for reference:\r\n{code}6:25:44.850412 IP pm-internal.46789 > team-internal.8090: Flags [P.], seq 3879219930:3879220700, ack 2504221957, win 229, options [nop,nop,TS val 1205973718 ecr 1206062209], length 770\r\nE..6..@.@.\"(..\r\n...\r\n......82..Ce............\r\nG...G...POST /rpc/xmlrpc HTTP/1.1\r\nAuthorization: OAuth oauth_token=\"\", oauth_consumer_key=\"\", oauth_signature_method=\"RSA-SHA1\", oauth_timestamp=\"\", oauth_nonce=\"\", oauth_version=\"1.0\", oauth_signature=\"Rpx47ZrmNZN40ax6LDadmCXAk8E4NxP648I7CV3VWp8wADQ3FNm008C70HQcRFFUoh3UBuwgagmRALadxnEhoGx9vmZ%2FIkbbw7%2F4jJ0rtJziH%2FdAAoylghe%2FlO4hGt1bfcv6nu%2FUq2ykWu4s1aPMi0K3UT1M49sUO%2FgFm5094%2BY%3D\"\r\nConnection: close\r\nUser-Agent: HttpClient/3.1\r\nHost: \r\nContent-Length: \r\nContent-Type: application/xml;

Suggested Solution\r\nAs a Confluence administrator, it would be better if I was prevented from removing the *Confluence administrator* global permission for the last user group that has this permission (not counting the *confluence-administrators* and *system-administrators* groups are they are reserved for Atlassian Support in Cloud).\r\nA warning could also be displayed in case users are about to lose this permission as the only way to get it back is via Atlassian Support.\r\n \r\nh3. Workaround \r\nCurrently, if users lose the *Confluence administrator* permissions in Confluence Cloud, they will need to create a ticket to Atlassian Support so we can grant this permission back.",

However, the documentation is not clear on what actions are included in the batched notifications and what actions will result in an e-mail to be sent out immediately.\r\n\r\nMore info on the feature here: [Confluence 5.10 Release Notes|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Confluence+5.10+Release+Notes#Confluence5.10ReleaseNotes-Moretimeforeveryone].\r\nh5. Suggested solution\r\n\r\nPlease update the documentation to mention the kinds of actions are part of the batched notifications and which are not.\r\n\r\nFor example, adding an attachment to the page (not the body of the page) or adding an inline comment to an attachment will immediately send out an e-mail to users watching the page/space. Editing the page content, however, will wait until the next batch window to send out the batched notifications e-mail to users.",

Problem Definition\r\n\r\nConfluence allows us to add as many pinned comments to attachments like PDFs as we want.\r\n\r\nHowever, due to a limitation in REST API, it can only load 100 of these, so adding more than 100 will cause these to not be loaded the next time the attachment is opened, even though they are present in the database.\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\nTwo changes:\r\n# Prevent users from adding more than 100 pinned comments to a single version of an attachment.\r\n# Add this limitation to the [documentation|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Share+and+Comment+on+Files]",

      "description": "{panel:bgColor=#e7f4fa}\n  *NOTE:* This suggestion is for *Confluence Server*. Using *Confluence Cloud*? [See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFCLOUD-43391].\n  {panel}\n\nThe current documentation do not sufficiently cover the technical details of the index recovery feature introduced in Confluence 5.9:\r\n* https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Confluence+Data+Center+Technical+Overview\r\n* https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Confluence+Data+Center+disaster+recovery\r\n\r\nAn important item to note about the index recovery process is that it is performed only on node startup. The first document does touch upon this, but also contains some misleading information, namely:\r\n{quote}\r\nIf you need to reindex Confluence for any reason, this is done on one node, and then picked up by the other nodes automatically. \r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nThis is because if you rebuild the index on one node, other exist nodes will not actually pick it up unless those nodes are new or require index recovery. Additionally, the recovery is only done on startup, and will not affect nodes currently running. The way index recovery works in 5.9 and higher is as follows:\r\n{quote}\r\nOn start up, a node will check the status of each of its indexes in its local home to see if it is missing, corrupt or out of date.\r\n\r\nIt does this by comparing the index entry id stored in the local journal file, e.g. journal/main_index file, in the journal folder in the node's local directory, with the index entry id in the database:\r\n* If the local journal file is missing or has an entry id of 0, the index is missing.\r\n* If the local journal entry id is not found in the database table \"journalentry\", then the index is out of date.\r\n* If the index cannot be read programmatically by lucene API, the index is corrupt.\r\n\r\nIf any of the above scenarios are found to be true, the node will attempt to recover the index in the following order:\r\n* Try recover search index by checking the shared home directory for a valid index backup file.\r\n* Try ask other nodes in the cluster for an index backup.\r\n* Perform a reindex.\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nAdditionally, there are optional JVM parameters that affect index recovery which should be documented:\r\n{code}\r\nconfluence.cluster.index.recovery.generation.timeout\r\n{code}\r\nDefault: *120* seconds. The amount of time, in seconds, that the confluence node needing index recovery will wait for an index snapshot to be created by another node, before it gives up and fails the index recovery attempt.\r\n\r\n{code}\r\nconfluence.cluster.index.recovery.query.timeout\r\n{code}\r\nDefault: *10* seconds. The amount of time, in seconds, that the confluence node needing recovery will wait for an index snapshot offer from any of its peers, before it gives up and fails the index recovery attempt.\r\n\r\n{code}\r\nconfluence.cluster.index.recovery.num.attempts\r\n{code}\r\nDefault: *1* attempt. The number of attempts the node will try to recover its index.\r\n\r\nNote that if this is set to 0, then effectively the 5.9 index recovery feature is disabled. If an index is found to be out of date, unavailable, or corrupt, then that node will automatically rebuild its own index after startup.\r\n\r\nFinally, because of the 5.9 index recovery feature, if an administrator needs to rebuild from scratch the index across all nodes in a cluster (i.e. if all nodes are suspected to have untrustworthy index files), they'll need to temporarily disable the index recovery feature. Otherwise, on startup the node without the index will simply try to recover from another node which defeats the purpose of reindex from scratch. This process is laid out in the following KB: https://confluence.atlassian.com/confkb/how-to-rebuild-the-content-indexes-from-scratch-on-confluence-data-center-833941594.html",

With those two factors combined, the way that the inline comment editor / viewer currently renders as a right sidebar makes for a bit of a \"scrunched\" display (see attached - not even at most comfortable magnification for me). On a 24\" monitor, even with the tools sidebar closed, the comments are blocked into a relatively narrow column down the right side.\r\n\r\nWhat would be really helpful is an option to render the inline comment editor / viewer _underneath_ the text that was highlighted. I've provided a very simplistic mock-up, showing the comment view pane below the paragraph that is highlighted with the inline comment. While a non-modal pop-over would be very cool, a bottom-docked pane for viewing and editing the comments associated with a marker would do the trick (almost like a split editor window). ",

Let me explain:\r\n\r\nLet's say your roadmap is on a year (1st January to 31st December). It will be a long roadmap and so, it will show you a scrollbar (horizontally). We're in August now. It would be great to see the roadmap \"from\" August and not from \"January\".\r\n\r\nWDYT?\r\n\r\nThank you for your attention\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nRapha\u00ebl Dehousse",

Summary\r\n\r\nThe file conversion service in Confluence could cause OutOfMemoryError due to a bug incurring a sustained CPU spike in -CONF-38233- which was subsequently fixed in Confluence 5.10.4\r\n\r\nThe file conversion service leverages the API provided by Aspose.Pdf for Java. The Aspose library might consume many memory for PDFs having either lots of objects or many contents, especially for large PDF files, say >100Mb. If the memory required is not able to be fulfilled, the OutOfMemory will occur, as a result of that, the system will be very slow to response to user's requests, and the system could be restarted to recover from this situation.\r\nh1. How to reproduce\r\n\r\nThe issue can be reproduced with the following steps,\r\n # Startup a Confluence instance with the memory setting:\u00a0-Xms256m -Xmx1g.\u00a0\r\n # Create some test pages, then attach some PDF attachments with size more than 100Mb. Note you need to adjust the \"Attachment Maximum Size\" via the General Configuration.\r\n # Click the thumbnails to view the attached PDFs\r\n # Continue the #2 and #3 until the OOM comes up\r\n\r\nh1. Workaround\r\n\r\nAt this stage, the primary\u00a0workaround for this issue is to *upgrade to Confluence 5.10.4*\u00a0as the\u00a0bug\u00a0causing the CPU to spike and subsequently OOME was fixed as part of\u00a0--CONF-38233--\r\n\r\nOther, workarounds if you are already running on Confluence 5.10.4 are as the following:\r\n # Increase more memory to Confluence instance if possible, as the issue is caused by the short of heap memory\r\n # Reduce the memory spike consumed by restricting the maximum size of attachment\u00a0allowed",

Although I realize that it does not have an official API, we still found it reasonably straightforward to extract data from JIRA and our other tracking systems and automatically create custom roadmaps that help us understand how our work rolls up across 30 scrum teams.  (Note that the JIRA product roadmap tool will not work for us because we also need to display custom operational data, for which we use confluence's chart functionality to get it all into one place.)\r\n\r\nIn order to understand how the work rolls up, we define two levels of epic - larger ones that span across teams and smaller ones that belong to one team.  We really would like to be able to show the larger and smaller epics together in the same lane but in different colors so that someone viewing the page is clear that these are different things.  Different colors would also help us convey other levels of information - for example, the product or target release for an epic, or which team is actually working on it.\r\n\r\nNote that this is *not* a request to support individual bar colors in the UI.  I realize that would likely end up being more work and introducing potential usability problems.  This request is just to support optionally including a color as part of the JSON data for the bar and displaying the bar in that color if it is present.\r\n\r\nThe lane is already being used to group related items together, so we would prefer not to have to separate these issues into different lanes.

      "description": "h4. Summary\r\n\r\nUsers with short names can not be @mentioned in Confluence if many other users share the *root* of the user name.\r\nh4. Symptoms\r\n\r\nA problem exists when username and full name are both short and similar to other names within Confluence. If a user is named with a short name such as:\r\n # Sue\r\n # Lin\r\n # Bob\r\n # Tom\r\n or others, then the user may not return when there are many similarly named individuals in the instance when attempting to @mention the user. Instead, you will find lots of other users, but *not* the user you are seeking to @mention.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\nh4. Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nBulk upload a large list of users with the same *root* of the user name. In my case, I used the name *Lin Lin* with a username of *lin* (an actual case of an individual having the issue). I created users named lin, lina through linz using the [User Management Util - Bulk User Upload|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.artemistech.confluence.plugins.bulkuserupload/server/overview] plugin which allowed me to quickly upload some 250 users, many with similar names to *lin* to test my theory that the search failed on discrete searches when a user has a very short name that is a root of a lot of other names:\r\n # Lino\r\n # Linda\r\n # Lindon\r\n # Linmeyer\r\n # Linq\r\n # Link\r\n # Lincoln\r\netc.\r\nh4. Expected results\r\n\r\nAfter uploading, I ran Content Indexing in the instances and attempted to @mention Lin Lin. With a small number of users in the system each with unique names and not sharing the same root of their name, this does not fail to isolate the user in question. This is to be expected, that the user *Lin Lin* would be found without issue.\r\nh4. Actual results\r\n\r\nHowever, when there are a large number of users sharing the same root to their name, the user can not be found for placing into a page, a calendar, a task assignment, etc. through the @mention method.\r\nh4. Screen Capture of the issue\r\n\r\n\u00a0 !lins.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nAs you can see, there is no way to select *Lin Lin* for the purposes of an @mention in this case. This points to a defect in the discrete nature of the text search in the application. Even when using the full user name, this search fails for @mention of the user in question, and no amount of reindexing will resolve the issue:\r\n\r\n!lin2.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nh4. Workaround:\r\nYou can use an alternative method with a more robust searching option. It will link to the user's profile which will in turn mention the user as if using the @mention. Details from [Notes on Using Mentions|https://confluence.atlassian.com/conf54/confluence-user-s-guide/sharing-content/using-mentions#UsingMentions-Notes]:\r\n{quote}\r\nLinking to a user profile. You can use a square bracket '[' and a person's name to trigger Confluence autocomplete and link to a person's user profile or personal space. Confluence will send the person a notification just as if you had used @mention (unless the administrator has disabled the user mention feature).\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nIn the editor you can:\r\n# Press \"[\"\r\n# Then start typing the name (not username) of your user  !type_name.png|thumbnail! \r\n# If they don't come up you can select to do a further search  !search_for_name.png|thumbnail! \r\n# And you'll get a window to do a full search for user profiles  !search_for_profile.png|thumbnail!
