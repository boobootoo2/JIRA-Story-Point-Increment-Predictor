(In my case, ZTE T83 with the Firefox web browser.) Not only does the UI need lots of screen real-estate (a problem even on many laptops with 1366\u00d7768 pixel screens), but in the backlog, the (small!) elements respond to dragging events almost instantly.\r\n\r\nThis is exacerbated by having minimal space to stick ones finger that isn't a task entry. The end result being when tapping on tasks or attempting to scroll, the task is often moved to a wildly different position. Add some lag, and you've got a recipe for making a right dog's breakfast of the carefully curated ordering of tasks.\r\n\r\nThe tasks should be *fixed* in their position, unless the user explicitly tells JIRA that they wish to alter positions, indicated by a padlock icon or similar, at which point the old behaviour should be restored allowing re-arrangement of tasks. The same UI element should also make it possible to re-enable the lock.\r\n\r\n(Thanks to Nic Brough for pointing this JIRA instance out to me.)",

Summary\r\nDrag and drop of issues on Kanban board is triggering a javascript error: Exception: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'top' of null\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Create a sample project of Kanban type.\r\n# Visit the Kanban board for the first time, select any issue to Expand the Issue Details View in right sidebar.\r\n# Navigate away from the Kanban board and then return to the Kanban board by selecting it from the Board menu. The last viewed issue should still be active (selected), and Issue Details View should be expanded for this issue (Jira remembered this for us).\r\n# Try to DRAG any OTHER issue on the board by click and HOLD of the left mouse button. It is important to take this step right after opening the Kanban board, and not to left-click any issue beforehand on this screen.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nThe dragged issue should becomes selected in the Issue Detail view, and you can transition the issue by dragging it to another column.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nA Javascript error pops-up \r\nbq. \"Exception: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'top' of null\" \r\npops up, and the issue can't be moved.\r\n \r\nh3. Notes/Workaround\r\n# The error is triggered only when Issue Details View in right sidebar is already expanded when user visit the Board. If it's collapsed (hidden), the no error will be thrown.\r\n# The error is triggered only when user tries to Drag issues that aren't shown in the Issue Details View, i.e. all issues except the currently selected one.

      "description": "Currently if you disable an User Directory within JIRA, JSW removes any of those users from being a board admin. Re-enabling the directory does not restore the Admin privileges.\r\n* This behaviour differs from JIRA core where disabled users are removed from project roles, but once the user is re-enabled, the project roles are also returned.\r\n\r\nh4. Expected Result\r\nWe expect consistency across user configurations. Currently Project Roles/Project lead get retained through a directory being disabled, so it is expected that Board Admins are also retained\r\n\r\nh4. Actual Result\r\nBoard Admins is removed, thus re-enabling the directory does not restore their admin status.\r\n\r\nh4. Steps to Reproduce\r\n* Have JSW installed with JIRA using Crowd or LDAP\r\n* Create Agile boards and set the external accounts as admin\r\n* Disable the Crowd/LDAP user directory, but *do not remove*\r\n* Re-enable the directory\r\n* Check the boards, none of the users are listed as board admins\r\n** Again, this behaviour differs from other JIRA behaviours\r\n\r\nh4. Cause\r\nExamining the database, it looks like when users are disabled, this is detected by JIRA and Project Roles are simply ignored for this user. For JSW, we see entries are actually removed from the \"AO_60DB71_BOARDADMINS\" table. Thus JSW is unable to restore the admin privileges.\r\n\r\nh4. Workaround\r\n\r\nSee this KB article:\r\n- [Board administrators are suddenly removed|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRAKB/Board+administrators+are+suddenly+removed]",

Moreover, merges are done by the QA team which is not involved in details of the development.\r\n\r\nWe could easily prevent a mistake of merging a wrong PR if the ones that are associated based on title texts (PR title/source branch) were made much more prominent than those associated on mentions in 'prose texts' (PR description, commit message, code review discussions, if ever implemented).\r\n\r\nSome implementation options:\r\n * Have a separate main list for when ticket occurs in branch name or PR title, and a separate 'Mentioned in' list with all the rest\r\n (This would be the preferred solution for teams like ours, because of the importance we attach to the main group.)\r\n * Add pictogram flags next to a PR that show the types of associations which were found",

      "description": "h1. [WIP] Pending: Reproduce on a clean instance\r\n\r\nh3. Summary\r\nUpon importing a project in JIRA 7.0 and up, the Project Import wizard will map fields used for Ranking issues to import the data. However, if the source backup contains LexoRank fields which context does not include the project being imported, the process will fail with a {{NullPointerException}}.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Behavior\r\nh5. 1st option\r\nIgnore the Rank fields that use context not applicable to the project.\r\n\r\n*Downside:* LexoRank doesn't care about field contexts, but rather assigns Rank values to all issues in the system. Ignoring those fields may have JIRA perform a {{rankInitially}} operation later on.\r\n\r\nh5. 2nd option\r\nMap the field configuration for additional Rank fields.\r\n\r\n*Downside:* It may be necessary to create extra fields as preparation for import.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Behavior\r\nIt is not possible to import a project from a backup that contains LexoRank fields which context does not include the project in question. The process fails with the below stack trace in the logs and a similar error message in the interface.\r\n\r\n{code:none|borderStyle=solid|borderColor=#6A8EB3|bgColor=#F8F8F8}\r\n2016-07-26 14:56:46,049 JiraTaskExectionThread-4 ERROR jiraadm 896x294x1 5xbt1o 192.168.10.176 /secure/admin/ProjectImportSelectProject.jspa [c.a.j.imports.xml.DefaultBackupXmlParser] Unexpected import failure\r\njava.lang.NullPointerException\r\n\tat com.atlassian.greenhopper.imports.LexorankPreImportHandler.addFieldMapping(LexorankPreImportHandler.java:94)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.greenhopper.imports.LexorankPreImportHandler.handleEntity(LexorankPreImportHandler.java:78)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.jira.imports.project.ao.handler.ChainedAoSaxHandler.endRow(ChainedAoSaxHandler.java:286)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.jira.imports.project.ao.handler.ChainedAoSaxHandler.endElement(ChainedAoSaxHandler.java:190)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.jira.imports.project.ao.handler.ChainedAoSaxHandler.endElement(ChainedAoSaxHandler.java:148)\r\n\tat org.apache.xerces.parsers.AbstractSAXParser.endElement(Unknown Source)\r\n\tat org.apache.xerces.impl.XMLDocumentFragmentScannerImpl.scanEndElement(Unknown Source)\r\n\tat org.apache.xerces.impl.XMLDocumentFragmentScannerImpl$FragmentContentDispatcher.dispatch(Unknown Source)\r\n\tat org.apache.xerces.impl.XMLDocumentFragmentScannerImpl.scanDocument(Unknown Source)\r\n\tat org.apache.xerces.parsers.XML11Configuration.parse(Unknown Source)\r\n\tat org.apache.xerces.parsers.XML11Configuration.parse(Unknown Source)\r\n\tat org.apache.xerces.parsers.XMLParser.parse(Unknown Source)\r\n\tat org.apache.xerces.parsers.AbstractSAXParser.parse(Unknown Source)\r\n\tat org.apache.xerces.jaxp.SAXParserImpl$JAXPSAXParser.parse(Unknown Source)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.security.xml.RestrictedXMLReader.parse(RestrictedXMLReader.java:103)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.jira.imports.xml.DefaultBackupXmlParser$XmlParser.parseXml(DefaultBackupXmlParser.java:115)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.jira.imports.xml.DefaultBackupXmlParser.parse(DefaultBackupXmlParser.java:64)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.jira.imports.xml.DefaultBackupXmlParser.parseXml(DefaultBackupXmlParser.java:52)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.jira.imports.xml.DefaultBackupXmlParser.parseAoBackupXml(DefaultBackupXmlParser.java:46)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.jira.imports.project.DefaultProjectImportManager.getAoProjectImportData(DefaultProjectImportManager.java:358)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.jira.imports.project.DefaultProjectImportManager.getProjectImportData(DefaultProjectImportManager.java:252)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.jira.bc.imports.project.DefaultProjectImportService.getProjectImportData(DefaultProjectImportService.java:578)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.jira.web.action.admin.importer.project.ProjectImportSelectProject$MappingResultCallable.call(ProjectImportSelectProject.java:252)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.jira.web.action.admin.importer.project.ProjectImportSelectProject$MappingResultCallable.call(ProjectImportSelectProject.java:233)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.jira.task.TaskManagerImpl$TaskCallableDecorator.call(TaskManagerImpl.java:453)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.jira.task.TaskManagerImpl$TaskCallableDecorator.call(TaskManagerImpl.java:421)\r\n\tat java.util.concurrent.FutureTask.run(FutureTask.java:266)\r\n\tat java.util.concurrent.Executors$RunnableAdapter.call(Executors.java:511)\r\n\tat java.util.concurrent.FutureTask.run(FutureTask.java:266)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.jira.task.ForkedThreadExecutor$ForkedRunnableDecorator.run(ForkedThreadExecutor.java:216)\r\n\tat java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:745)\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nh3.
