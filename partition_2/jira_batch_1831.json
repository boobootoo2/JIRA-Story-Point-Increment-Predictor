Note that the folder for the attachment is the folder for the *page the attachment is on* not necessarily the *page being viewed*.\r\n\r\nMy theory is that there's a race condition happening here and hence a spurious error message.  I'll comment the code appropriately.\r\n\r\n{code:java}//...\r\n        // Two threads get here at about the same time.\r\n        File thumbnailsFolder = new File(getThumbnailPath() + attachment.getContent().getId());\r\n\r\n        // Both threads get here and the folder doesn't exist.\r\n        if (!thumbnailsFolder.exists())\r\n        {\r\n            // So both threads get here and the folder doesn't exist.

This should be fixed in the plugin repository; maybe with an 'Installed Plugins' as the first tab, and an 'Available Plugins' as the 2nd (IDEA style)\r\nIf we did this we could drop the 'Plugins' part.

In that case it is logged into google analytics as \"userA\".

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFCLOUD-16649].\n  {panel}\n\nWe are a very large organization, using many live-templates (Scaffolding). We are passing meta-data values to other pages. However, when running a metadata-report, it shows all results with a particular label (or specificy MaxRestults=30). Suppose we have 3000 pages total that we are calling, and we only show 30 in the report, then it will show 30, and nobody will know the other 2970 even exist.\r\n\r\nSo if you look at the contentbylabel macro, it says \"Showing 1-30 out of 3000\", so you know the other 3000 exist. \r\n\r\nTo take it one step further, it would be spectacular if it were possible to get this message on meta-data report AND get some arrows for pagination, so it keep me on the same screen and using Ajax (or something similar) allow us to click arrows to see the next 30 results. Similar to the jira-issues macro.\r\n\r\nGood USE CASE: Teams at a company want to use Scaffolding and Metadata for project or action tracking. At the end of those projects or actions, they ddon't want them to populate in the table anymore (because they are old), but they don't want to delete them either. They all want an archive of everything they do for future reference. Like many company's the users don't have great adoption with utilizing the labels (nor the knowledge of how the macros interact with the labels), so it's not a simple fix of the end users changing the labels. Hence the need for pagination.",
