For example:\r\n{code:none}\r\n{flowchart}\r\nYksi -> Kaksi -> Kolme -> Yksi;\r\n{flowchart}\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nIs converted to this just by clicking Rich Text Editor tab:\r\n{code:none}\r\n{flowchart}\r\nYksi \\-> Kaksi \\-> Kolme \\-> Yksi;\r\n{flowchart}\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nwhich, of course, spoils the diagram and that, in turn, makes the Rich Text Editor next to unusable (in our case, anyway).\r\n\r\nFortunately, there is a simple solution to this. I suggest that you improve Rich Text Editor by adding some filtering capabilities there so that certain macros will be bypassed by Rich Text Editor. This filter could be a simple list where a Confluence admin can add all the macros to be bypassed. Or maybe the list should contain macros that can be handled by the Rich Text Editor. But to put it simply, there should be a way to manage what Rich Text Editor is allowed to \"edit\".",

The name of the attachment isn't shown when the mouse hovers over, it remains 'hidden'. Foreground and background color are the same. You can select the filename.\r\n\r\nEdit in word (via the tools menu) is working, as well as the WebDav functionality.\r\n\r\nIs there something which needs to be configured (and which I overlooked) ?\r\n\r\nI included the generated html page as an attachment (home.htm).\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n\r\nRegards, Herman.\r\n",

At least it could be acceptable workaround for Airbus.\r\n\r\nIs there a way to patch Confluence 2.10.3 in such a way? If it's possible could you help us for this point, delivering class or configuration elements?

Problem\r\n\r\nDiscovered during user sessions... \"The Add Table dialog is hard and slow for me to use.\"\r\n\r\n- When entering letters into the row and column fields and clicking \"OK\", blank space is inserted into the editor. An error message would be more useful.\r\n- Some users would find it faster and easier if they could select a number rather than type it in.\r\n- \"First Row is Heading\" label is grammatically incorrect and too long.\r\n\r\nh3. Solution\r\n\r\nUsing the new lightbox style (e.g. macro browser), implement something like this:\r\n\r\n!insert_table.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nThis will align the dialog with the current direction and make it less confusing for the confused users.\r\n\r\nIf someone wants to do something _FANTASTIC_ for _FUN_, Microsoft Word 2004 has a pretty good implementation for inserting dialogs. But it's probably a time consuming implementation and one not worth the time (which is why I haven't proposed it as the primary solution).",
