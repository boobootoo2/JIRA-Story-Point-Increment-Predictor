It even reaches that far:\r\n\r\nEditor\u00a0A and B are working on the same page. A closes the page without publishing it, but clicks *Keep draft*. If A starts editing the page again, the draft is there, everything is OK. If, on the other hand, B closes\u00a0the page and selects *Discard everyone's changes*, this will alter A's draft as well, removing everything A has worked on.\r\n\r\nThere should at least be a way (or automatism) for all other concurrent editors to save their work or either some sort of a voting mechanism.\r\n\r\nThere will be nothing more frustrating than working heavily on a page and then get the own work \"destroyed\" (accidentally or on purpose, doesn't matter) by\u00a0another person.\u00a0\r\n\r\nI already expressed my concern about this way of doing it while Confluence 6.0 was still in EAP, but sadly you did not listen (at all).\r\n\r\nSo... to set Collaborative editing as the new feature of all features (which it is... IMHO), PLEASE, for gods sake, rework the way changes are discarded!",

But the key of working in confluence is to know which macros you can/should use. And that information is hard to see as a new user (or existing one) as the features are \"hidden\" in the +\u00a0-> other macros menu. Also it takes many clicks to get to the correct macro sometimes...\r\n\r\nAnd it takes time to get the knowledge on which macros should be used...\r\n\r\nSo my suggestion to fix this is to take inspiration from the ribbon used in office. Imaging having a similar menu in confluence where you could group the macros/plugins and having a small image for each macro for example.\r\n\r\n!ribbon.png!\r\n\r\nBut since you have user data of users: why not also add a menu group bar with the \"top used macros\", trending macros, admin suggested macros aswelll..\r\n\r\nAnd also add to the most right in the menu a quick search for macros, which could function just like the Search tool \"Search JIRA admin\" which is used when logging in to\u00a0the administration section of lira.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nBy doing the above changes I think the plugin usage in confluence would not only get easier for existing users, but for new users it would boost their confluence usage from the beginning.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0",

There appears to be a maximum of 1000 set on the user entity query.\u00a0Could this indeed be causing the false negative?\r\nh4.

Notes\r\nIt looks like the macro uses the actual current space even if the page is included in a different space.

The preview of the macro does work properly, which is why this seems to be unexpected behavior. \r\n\r\nh3.Workaround\r\nChange 'Current space' to instead point to the name of the space where the macro originally was embedded",

Problem Definition\r\nRemoving page restrictions on a space is quite time consuming and not user friendly for Confluence administrators especially if there are many restrictions for multiple pages. The user has to click on all locks, preferably in a new tab otherwise they get redirected to a restricted access page, in order to remove all page restrictions to finally get access to the restricted pages.\r\n\r\nFor instance, it is an issue during Confluence migration as the new admin will not necessarily have permissions to view all pages and the previous user that has set the restrictions does not exist anymore.\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\nProvide a solution, either as a button in the *Restricted Pages* tab in *Space permissions*, in order to remove all restrictions for one page or all pages at once.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround \r\nRight-click and open in a new tab when clicking on a lock will allow to stay on the Restricted Pages tab to continue removing all restrictions. However, this workaround is quite time consuming on Confluence instances with lots of restrictions on lots of pages in different spaces.",

Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Login to Confluence\r\n# Create Application Link with JIRA (this is to be used for JIRA Issue Macro)\r\n# Create a new Page on Confluence\r\n# Insert a JIRA Issue Macro on that page (with a filter on a JIRA project that has tickets)\r\n# Write some random text in another paragraph\r\n# Insert a Code Macro with some random code inside\r\n# Insert a table with some entries\r\n# Insert a couple of tasks in a Task list\r\n# Insert a Symbol\r\n# Insert an Info Macro\r\n# Save the page\r\n# Go to Confluence *Administration* -> *PDF Stylesheet* -> *Edit*\r\n# Insert the following:\r\n{code:borderStyle=solid}\r\nbody {\r\n    font-size: 20px;\r\n}\r\n{code}\r\n# Save and Export the Page as PDF\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nThe PDF will be generated with all its content having the font size as 20px\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nThe PDF is generated with all text (outside of a macro) font changed to 20px, however all texts in a macro is still using the default CSS settings.\r\n\r\n\r\nh3.Workaround\r\n(!) For Confluence 5.4.2, these stylesheets do not apply for tables as well, but this was fixed in later versions.\r\nNo workarounds are available for the moment.",

Workaround\r\n # Edit the <confluence-install-folder>/confluence/WEB-INF/classes/log4j.properties file\r\n # Add these entries at the end of the file:\r\n{code:java}# Suppress analytics.client.listener.ProductEventListener WARN logs\r\nlog4j.logger.com.atlassian.analytics.client.listener.ProductEventListener=ERROR\r\n{code}\r\n # Save the file and restart your Confluence instance.\r\n\r\n{panel:title=Atlassian Update February 2018|borderStyle=solid|borderColor=#3C78B5|titleBGColor=#3C78B5|bgColor=#E7F4FA}\r\nThanks for your interest in this issue.\r\n\r\nWe have made a number of improvements to this warning.\r\nIn 6.0.1 we fixed a bug that causes the overflow of the ProductEventListener to put additional analytics events into the very same queue.\r\nIn 6.5.0 we suppressed a full site re-index from sending analytics, thereby removing one of the major causes of spamming the application logs.\r\nWe are holding simply changing the debug level by default as this is a valid warning.\r\nIf you can post what feature/trigger caused you to receive this error message then we can better determine whether to suppress additional analytics events, increase the queue size, or reduce the frequency of the log message.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nConfluence Product Management\r\n{panel}",

      "description": "Problem:\r\n\r\nWhen using an external gadget (e.g., JIRA gadget \"Pie Chart\") in a Confluence page, every user who views the page\u00a0is prompted to \"Login and approve\" the gadget in JIRA before they can see the content.\r\n\r\nThis happens *for every user for every gadget,* meaning that if I create a Confluence page using Pie Chart, Filter Results, Average Age Chart, and Two-Dimensional Issue Statistics and send it to executives for review, every executive has to \"Login and Approve\" every gadget. Worse, sometimes the \"approval\" token doesn't stick, and a user has to go through the process again.\r\n\r\nWe have tried single sign-on, creating a trusted application link, setting up 2-way oauth with impersonation, and combinations of all of the above, to no avail.\r\n\r\nAtlassian support has confirmed there is currently no way to bypass or automate the approval.\r\n\r\nThis is unacceptable for our 10,000 user base and makes our Confluence look unprofessional.\r\n\r\n*Please allow 2-way oauth with impersonation to automatically approve external gadgets.*\r\n\r\nNote: We never experienced this problem on Confluence 5.6. We cannot roll-back our upgrade, but we are severely regretting it.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce:\r\n# Integrate JIRA with Confluence through Application link.\r\n# On the create application link wizard, check the same user base option and make sure the user used for the integration is exist on Confluence.\r\n# After it, an applicaiton link with Oauth(Impersonation) will be created.\r\n# On JIRA Dashboard, add a new gadget to find JIRA Gadget XML e.g. Filter Result Gadget.\r\n# Copy the XML link and navigate to Confluence _General Configuration > External Gadgets_.\r\n# Add the gadget by using the XML link.\r\n# Create a new Confluence page and add a gadget by using \"Other Macros\"\r\n# Choose the newly added JIRA \"Filter Results\" gadget.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Result:\r\n- Just like JIRA Issue Macro, the filter will be researchable or issues for JIRA Issue Macro.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Result:\r\n- \"Login & Approve\" will come out and user need to authenticate to retrive filters in JIRA.\r\n\r\nh3. Note:\r\nReferring to the documentation [Oauth Security for Applinks|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/APPLINKS/OAuth+security+for+application+links] that using impersonation would not be needed for the user to authenticate as long the user is not redirected to the linked information:\r\nbq. they're automatically authenticated on the other application and don't get asked to authorize requests.\r\n",

Summary\r\nUsing some operations are causing vertical spacing between the macros to be stripped out as {{auto-cursor-target}} class is applied.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n# Start creating a newpage\r\n# Insert a block macro (e.g. the info macro)\r\n# Insert another macro below the first (e.g. another info macro)\r\n# In the space between the two macros, add a line break (in the editor DOM there are now two paragraphs between the macros - one with the {{auto-cursor-target}} class and one without)\r\n# Click on preview and observe that there is vertical spacing between the macros\r\n# Perform one of the \"user operations\" listed below - do this below the two macros to make the effect clearer to observe (in the editor DOM, both paragraphs between the macros now have the {{auto-cursor-target}} class applied)\r\n# Click on preview and observe that the vertical spacing between the macros has been stripped out\r\n\r\nUser operations known to cause this issue:\r\n* Wiki autoformatting (e.g. when you type {{h2.}} followed by a space to trigger heading formatting)\r\n* Cutting content (e.g. via {{cmd + v}} shortcut)\r\n\r\nThis issue is only reproducible on instances that do *not* have the collaborative editing feature enabled.\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nThe spaces are not modified\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nVertical spacing between the macros were stripped out.\r\n\r\nh3.Workaround\r\nUse operations on the top menu when available, such as selecting a text and making it title, instead of using {{h2.}}.\r\n\r\n",
