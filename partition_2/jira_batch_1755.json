[See the corresponding bug report|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFCLOUD-26765].\n  {panel}\n\nh4. Symptoms\r\n\r\nWhen a page name contains a special character, this character is included in the ID of any anchors on the page. When generating the URL for such anchors, Confluence is encoding any text to the right of the \\# using HTML entity escaping, but for this link to work, it must use URL encoding. This also happens if an anchor name contains a special character.\r\n\r\nFor example the apostrophe character:\r\n\r\n* The URL is currently replacing it with &#39;\r\n* The URL should be replacing it instead with %27 like it does on the left side of the \\#\r\n* The anchor is showing up correctly in the page source, as the apostrophe is not encoded inside the id attribute\r\n\r\nNote that whilst using special characters in an ID is [prohibited in XML|http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/#NT-NameStartChar] and thus XHTML, it's [perfectly fine for HTML5|http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/elements.html#the-id-attribute], which is used by Confluence, so any special characters do not need to be encoded inside the id attribute.\r\n\r\nh4. Steps to reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Create a page named \"User's Resources\"\r\n2. Add an anchor to it, say \"shares\", a link to the anchor in the same page (or any other) and save\r\n3. Click the link\r\n4. No redirect is made (or if the link is in a different page, redirect is made only to the page, not the anchor)\r\n\r\nThis is the link:\r\n{code}<confluence_instance>/display/<space_name>/User%27s+Resources#User&#39;sResources-shares{code}\r\n\r\nThis behavior happens because of the special character used in the title - If the page is renamed without it, everything works.\r\n\r\nh4. Workaround\r\n\r\nIf this is caused by the page name, the only workaround is to rename that page to not have a special character.\r\n\r\nIf this is caused by the anchor name, you can work around this by manually URL-escaping the special character in the \"Link\" value in \"Advanced\" when creating the link.",

      "description": "We experienced an unusual growth of our nonspaced attachments that appears to be a DoS vunerability both in an accidental way (with a workaround) and intentional (not easily worked around). This is under Confluence 4.0, but appears to probably apply to 4.3.1 as well.\r\n\r\nIt appears the growing nonspaced attachment area is due to anonymous (or an authenticated local crawler such as GSA) having limited edit access and therefore having the Copy option appear in the Tools menu. The Copy page options is a standard link rather than a form POST and is therefore followed, and Confluence will then copy the page into a draft including all the attachments. This can quickly result in hundreds of copies of each document and attachment (a copy every time the crawler hits it).\r\n\r\nThis also seems to be a Denial of Service vulnerability even if it's not editable (so the link does not appear), as synthesizing the edit link based off page metadata still creates the draft copy in the database and on disk but just warns it can't be saved. There does not appear to be an obvious way to prevent this from happening. The drafts appear to stay around for at least a month if not longer.\r\n\r\nI can confirm this on a local 4.0 install, but it appears to at least be possible to open the edit page on a 4.3.1 install (https://confluence.atlassian.com/pages/copypage.action?idOfPageToCopy=204049164&spaceKey=SUPPORT in a fresh Chrome Incognito session).\r\n\r\n-This appears to have been reported as an XSS vulnerability- -and supposedly fixed in 2.7.3- (-CONF-11027-), -but apparently this regressed with some update as no key is required for copypage.action.-\r\n\r\nHowever even with an +XSRF+-XSS- prevention key the anonymous (default demonstration space) or authenticated (internal) crawler issue would still be an issue with drafts living a month or more, and possibly on the view-only side if the key was not short lived and or tied to only sessions with edit access.",

      "description": "h4. Symptoms\r\nRequesting certain JavaScript resources can be quite slow. The problem is even worse on instances where plugins add a lot of JavaScript to the batches or where user lookups are slow.\r\n\r\nh4. Technical Explanation\r\nWhen certain resources are requested, the thread local caches does not get initialised because the {{UrlRewriteFilter}} forwards the request and the {{ThreadLocalCacheFilter}} never runs.\r\n\r\nThis causes certain calls (such as {{getLocale}} in {{DefaultLocaleManager}}) not to use any caching. Then, transformers such as the i18n JavaScript transformer, which use things like the {{LocaleManager}} end up running very slowly because they end up doing an uncached {{getUser}} call for each and every instance of {{getText}} in the JavaScript.\r\n\r\nh4. Fix\r\nThe fix is to edit the {{web.xml}} file and move the following snippet:\r\n{code:xml}\r\n<filter-mapping>\r\n    <filter-name>UrlRewriteFilter</filter-name>\r\n    <url-pattern>/s/*</url-pattern>\r\n</filter-mapping>\r\n{code}\r\ndown so that it is right above this line:\r\n{code:xml}\r\n<!-- Plugins 2.5 filter changes -->\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nIf the log messages continue upgrading to Confluence 5.0 or higher will fix it, or if that is not an option, you can add this to your log4j.properies file and add:\r\n{noformat}\r\nlog4j.logger.com.atlassian.confluence.cache.ThreadLocalCache=ERROR\r\n{noformat}\r\nTo avoid restarting Confluence for it to pick up the change, you should also add this to your \"Logging and Profiling\" admin page:\r\n|| Class/Package Name | com.atlassian.confluence.cache.ThreadLocalCache |\r\n|| New Level | ERROR |",

In confluence a lot of things are relying on bandana including core things like plugins state. When we made bandana caching persister fully transactional then we were getting plugin inconsistent states and other test failures across our builds. Decision was to leave it `as is` since other products (like jira) do not provide transactional caches anyway (like confluence does) anyway and values in caches will be poisoned on transaction failure.\r\n\r\nIf you still need transactional aware key->value storage you can use raw bandana manager (not wrapped with cached) and wrap it with transactional cache. It still will work for plugin code, it's just transactional bandana doesn't work for core confluence features.\r\n\r\n----\r\n*Side thought*\r\nGiven that transactional bandana manager is problem for confluence core we might just exposed two beans - one for plugin devs(transactional) and one for confluence core (non-transactional).",
