So if you later decide it makes sense to link e.g. BackLink to a page that describes it, you dont have to touch the pages with this word.\n",

If a licensed organization like ourselves are able to download a particular version of the source, we may rebuild the war at any time without making changes to Atlassian source. We are currently rebuilding the war because of changes to an authentication mechanism we use for SSO. This only requires a change to a seraph xml file in the Atlassian source and the inclusion of a new package from our organization.\n\nIn addition, it seems like if I were to rebuild our 1.3.X war which we have used for the last year,  now it would also not work. The licensing information on your website (http://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence/pricing.jsp) states (or at least to us it does) that we can use any release that comes out during the maintenance period we paid for. It seems dangerous to have clients that can download a particular verion of the source and have it build and run and then because they rebuild it after a certain date, the application no longer works. Luckily, this has only affected our development/test environment and not our production environment. \n---------------------------",

      "description": "Hi,\nI'd like some advice on how best to handle this permission setup.\nWithin a space, we have a variety of projects for a client, each with their own pages, which in turn have child pages. The home page of the space also has summary information about the status of all projects. On one of these projects, we're working with another company, and we need to grant them access to a few of the child pages in one project. We don't want them to be able to see the home page (summary), project home page, or any of the other projects.\nI can see how to do this with page level permissions if both the space home page and project home pages only contained a list of children (then the other children just wouldn't show up)- but in this case these home pages contain sensitive information that we don't want to reveal.\nAny suggestions on how best to set this up?\n\nthanks\n\nBen",
