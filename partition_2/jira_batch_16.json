If I don't enter anything, it will continue to pop up more and more dialogs. On earlier versions of SourceTree I've seen these coincide with fetch events in the Process Viewer / Log. I guess when it goes to fetch from Bitbucket every 10 minutes, it opens a dialog for each of my local repos.\r\n\r\nI've been testing the SourceTree 3.0.0 beta branch for a week or two now hoping that this was fixed but\u00a0I came to my computer this evening (which I last logged into this morning) to find hundreds of Bitbucket credential dialogs open (see screenshot; each of those windows has ~20 behind it in the same spot). These were also slowing my computer to a crawl so logging in took minutes instead of seconds.\r\n\r\n\u00a0The worst part of all of this is that even if I'm here and enter my log in information, it doesn't accept it. Manual remote operations will fail and I end up having to go into the terminal to successfully complete the operation. The only way I've been able to get it to work is to go into the remotes section and resync my oauth token for Bitbucket. However, this doesn't last more than a few days at best.\r\n\r\nI never have this issue with Github and I really don't understand why the two Atlassian products are so broken with one another. I have several staff as well and I've seen this on every one of their computers.",
