      "description": "I had originally reported a bug that produced an error message when attempting to navigate past the 10th page in the Manage Groups page.  I was directed to to this issue:\r\n\r\nhttp://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONF-6184\r\n\r\nwhich appears to be resolved.\r\n\r\nHowever, with version 2.2.8, I am only seeing 100 groups from my Active Directory server.  After the 100th group (the 4th page in the manage groups navigation), on the 5th page I only see the 3 confluence standard groups.  When viewing users, I do see most of their group membership (including groups not viewable in manage groups), although it still caps their list at 100.\r\n\r\nCould you please verify how LDAP integration should work in Confluence?  There were a number of issues reported over the last few months, in terms of the 100-group limit -- (1) couldn't navigate past the 100th group without seeing an exception, (2) users who were members of more than 100 groups had problems with authentication, when it required membership in groups past the 100th group mark, (3) couldn't view more than 100 groups in a user's profile.\r\n\r\nI am having a difficult time figuring out which of these has been fixed and whether the fixes involve configuration settings that we should be using.\r\n\r\nThank you.",

      "description": "I believe that this issue duplicates CONF-5867.  Sorry for the new bug, but I was unable to reopen the existing issue.\r\n\r\nWhen a user is already logged into jira, visiting the confluence login page from a seperate browser window launched from the \"File->New\" option of the browser window that is displaying jira will log the user out of jira.  The same is true if the user is logged into confluence and visits the jira login page.\r\n\r\nJira is installed as the standalone version running at http://hostname:8080.  Jira is running against mysql with a database name of jiradb\r\nConfluence is installed as the standalone version running at http://hostname:9090.  Confluence is running against mysql with a database name of confluencedb.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1) Launch a new instance of either IE 6 or fFirefox 1.5 and clear all cookies\r\n2) From within the browser window select \"File->new\" in order to launch a second browser window\r\n3) In the first browser window navigate to the jira installation (http://hostname:8080) and log in.\r\n4) Optionally click the \"Home\" link in the top left corner of the jira page to verify that this does not log the user out\r\n5) In the second browser window navigate to the confluence installation (http://hostname:9090) which is automatically redirected to http://hostname:9090/login.action?os_destination=%2Fhomepage.action\r\n6) In the first browser window (the jira browser) click the \"Home\" link in the top left corner of the page.  At this point the user is consistently logged out of their jira session.\r\n\r\nPlease note that we are consistently able to reproduce this bug when a new browser window is launched via the \"File->new\" window or is opened by visiting a link that opens a new window from within the first browser window.  We are not able to duplicate this issue if the second browser window is launched by clicking on the \"exe\" file corresponding to the browser that is being tested.\r\n\r\nThanks for your help resolving this issue.  Please don't hesitate to contact me if you require any further information or assitance in duplicating this issue.",

After the number on line 3 I think there is a non-ASCII character or something. Pasting this text into a Confluence page results in the text being truncated after this character, so the final line isn't saved.\r\n\r\nIf you remove the character at the end of line 3, the content saves OK.\r\n\r\nI would expect Confluence to strip out, escape, or barf on the dodgy character (if it is indeed such) - but not just truncate....",

      "description": "I often get complaints from users with complex document composition needs that once they break up their complex documents into a page hierarchy in Confluence (for maintainability and linkability), they can't easily print out the whole thing to read on on their commute as an example (or take an export of it for that matter). So it would be great if there was an easy to get a printable view of an entire page hierarchy. The current workaround I give them is to go to Browse Space -> Advanced -> Export space -> check, check, check... which quickly (and understandably) gets very old. This feature would therefore be a tremendous boost to adoption, as this limitation is one of the few reasons why people fall back to using MS Word for complex/long documents.",

This would make space creation and permissioning more intuitive for the common user.  Currently the only member of the \"confluence-users\" group in our Confluence instance is the administrator.  All other user/group permissions are managed by our LDAP server.

We use a light grey as our page background colour, which means that I have to edit the site-css.vm file to change the background colour and the appropriate contrasting colours (darker grey, etc.)\r\n\r\nSecondly, it would be great if the background (and other) colours were defined in a consistent way.  Some are listed as white others as #FFFFFF.  Some are called grey or lightgrey, others are hex codes, which makes it tricky to do a global search and replace.  Externalising these should also ensure greater consistency.\r\n\r\nAnd thirdly, the background colour is also hard coded into different sections of code, apart from the site-css.vm file, making it very tricky to track down all the instances that specify the background colour.\r\n\r\n",
