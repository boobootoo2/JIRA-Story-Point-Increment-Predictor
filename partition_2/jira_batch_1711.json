The following will appear in the atlassian-confluence.log:\r\n{code}\r\n2013-09-12 01:44:15,408 WARN [scheduler_Worker-9] [atlassian.crowd.directory.DbCachingRemoteChangeOperations] findGroupsToUpdate remote group name [ group1 ] casing differs from local group name [ GROUP1 ]. Group details will be kept updated, but the group name cannot be updated\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n(I am using Crowd for this example but this could also occur when using AD or any other LDAP)\r\n# Set up Crowd 2.7 and Confluence 5.4.1 (these are the versions I used, but this bug has been apparent since at least Confluence 5.3.1 and JIRA 6.1.2)\r\n# Create a Crowd user \r\n# Create a group in Crowd called 'group1'\r\n# Add the user to the group in Crowd\r\n# Create a group in Crowd called confluence-administrators and add the user to it\r\n# Set up Crowd as a directory in Confluence (or JIRA) and sync it\r\n# Change the name of the group in the Confluence (or JIRA) database to 'GROUP1' and sync again\r\n(This is to simulate the casing being changed in an external directory, eg AD. You cannot change the case directly in Crowd, but if AD is connected to Crowd and Crowd is connected to Confluence, when the casing changes in AD this issue occurs)\r\n# Log in to Confluence as the user. \r\n# Go to Admin > Users in Confluence (confirm the password when prompted)\r\n# View your group memberships and confirm you are a member of GROUP1\r\n# Go to the Dashboard\r\n# Click in the top banner to drop admin rights \r\n# Go back to Admin > Users, confirming password again when prompted\r\n# Confirm that you are no longer a member of GROUP1\r\n# Repeat steps 11 - 13 and confirm that you are a member of GROUP1 again\r\n# Repeat again and confirm the membership is gone\r\n\r\nNB: This is similar to old issues that used to occur when the casing changed, but they all occurred on intermittent directory syncs. That does not appear to be occurring anymore, and it is now only authenticating into the admin section of both JIRA and Confluence that causes this issue.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n# Remove and recreate the directory in Confluence. NB: Only do this if you are not using [read only with local groups|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Connecting+to+an+LDAP+Directory#ConnectingtoanLDAPDirectory-PermissionSettings] (that is, so long as all the group memberships are stored in the external directory, not in Confluence), as this will cause you to lose the local group memberships.\r\n# Avoid renaming groups to change casing in external directories. If this must be done, co-ordinate with the person making the change, and proactively remove and recreate the directory in Confluence once the group is renamed.",

But the users should be able to manage their attachment versions themselves, as the space admin is the IT guy most of the times.\r\n- There's also the permission \"Delete Attachments\" - why doesn't this permission also cover deleting the versions?

When searching for a page in another space it will return the result in this format: spaceKey:pageName and searching for a page in the same space it will only return the page name. \r\n\r\nSo if I create a page called \"Test\" in a space with the key DS. And then go to an other space and create a page called \"DS:Test\".\r\n\r\nIf I use a confluence-content macro field to search for those two pages I will get the same result:\r\nDS:Test\r\nDS:Test \r\n\r\nAnd there is no way of separating them.  \r\n\r\nFurther more, it can not handle page titles with special characters like \"\u00e5\u00e4\u00f6\" properly. \r\n\r\nIt would be much better if it would return the pageId instead. \r\n\r\nThe attachment macro parameter is not working either.  https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/100824/attachment-parameter-in-confluence-plugin-issue\r\n\r\nThe attachment type would ideal just deliver a drop down list containing all attachments. \r\n\r\nCurrently, we can not use any of these macro parameters which makes the User Experience of the macro browser very poor. Fixing this would really boost the usability of macros and make it much easier for plugin developers to develop user friendly macros. \r\n\r\nBest Regards\r\n\r\nEmil Sj\u00f6din,  RefinedWiki",

Included are the following recommendations but please see the document for more details.\r\n * Text editor: since text editor is inherently broken and unusable by a screen reader user, the text editor should be completely overhauled and/or replaced with an accessible alternative.\r\n * For dynamic content: ARIA (Accessible-Rich Internet Applications) alert to indicate to user that the content has been dynamically changed.\r\n * For semantic structure (headings): all pages should be reviewed to ensure that no heading levels have been skipped. Specifically, on search results page, search results should be h2 instead of h3.\r\n * All images should have appropriate alt tags.\r\n * Developer should use ARIA landmarks to help screen reader users identify main content and navigation regions on pages.\r\n * Alt text of images should be searchable as this is what the image will be called when a screen reader is used",

They all have the same label. I would like to collect all data in 1 page properties report. If I understand the documentation well, this should work (as long as the labels are the same). However, it seems that only the last one or the one in the righthand section is included in the report. I have tried without mentioning the column headers and with mentioning them. In the latter case, no values are displayed for the columns that do not belong to the last page properties macro. In the first case, only the columns belonging to the last or the right-hand macro are included. Please, advise.\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nCurrent functionality is that when there are multiple Page Properties macros (with the same label specified) on a page the Page Properties Report macro only reports the data contained in ONE Page Properties macro in the report.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Create a page with a page properties macro. In that macro, add a table that looks like this:\r\n|| a | 1 |\r\n|| b | 2 |\r\n2. In that macro, give it a label 'prop1'\r\n3. Add another page property macro on that page, give it the same label 'prop1' with the contents:\r\n|| c | 3 |\r\n|| d | 4 |\r\n4. Save the page. Now create a new page in the space.\r\nIn that new page, create a page properties report macro and give it the label 'prop1'.\r\nOutcome: It reports on ONE table only  (c and d)\r\nThis feature request is so that it displays all data (a, b, c and d) because the label 'prop1' is specified on both. \r\n\r\nThis appears to be the reverse of the use case in https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONF-28776",

The improvements are:\r\n* Personalization option for a user to create a filter for such list of links that belong to that user, i.e. adding personal label to the filter.\r\n* This filter should be able to be updated without losing the personal label attached to it.\r\n* Extend the ability of link collection to be compiled not only limited for each space but throughout the whole site.\r\n\r\nMain goal for this improvement is to provide a centralized list of links of customer's company wide resources that can be selected by each wiki user for their dashboard.\r\n\r\nThank you and regards,\r\nLazuardi",
