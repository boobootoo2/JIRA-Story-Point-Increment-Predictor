Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nIf we change the filter to display a number of users from 10 to any other number (20, 50, or 100), Confluence should be able to stick to those settings next time when the admin comes back to the _Users_ page.\r\nh3. Why This Is Important\r\n\r\nFor a Confluence site with a large number of users, it can be ineffective for admins when Confluence always goes back to the default number 10, and they need to make changes to the list every time they visit the page.\r\nh3.

Environment\r\nTests performed with Confluence versions 6.13.4 and 6.13.10, specifically for Data Center version to reach a similar environment to the customer.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n* Create a page with random content (customer used Lipsum Generator) and add the _Info, Note, Tip and Warning macros_ that come bundled with Confluence. Issue can also be reproduced with the Message Box Macro that is bundled with the Content Formatting for Confluence plugin version 6.4.3 from Adaptavist. \r\n* Add any of those macros to the page with the random content, and add inline comments to the plain text but also to the macros content, since those macros are meant to enhance the plain text.\r\n* While navigating the multiple inline comments, it is noticeable the inline comments added to the text inside the macros, either the _Info, Note, Tip and Warning macros_ or the _Message Box Macro_ makes the positioning in the page be completely lost, since navigating through the inline comments seems to either ignore the inline comments inside the macros or makes the positioning of the page focus, that was supposed to be over the inline comment highlighted text, goes either to the beginning of the page, or to some random place in the middle or all the way to the bottom.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nNavigating through inline comments should allow the page focus to be over the highlighted text for the inline comment.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nNavigating through inline with macros _Info, Note, Tip and Warning macros_ or the _Message Box Macro from Adaptavist_ shows the same behaviour, which is the wrong focus for the page that contain inline comments inside those macros, making the navigation through the page erroneous.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\nNo workaround available. Removing the macros allow the navigation through the inline comments to work properly, but it defeats the purpose of making it possible to focus the positioning of the page over the highlighted content.\r\n\r\nh3. Notes\r\n\r\nCustomer test data and instructions:\r\n- Confluence 6.13.10 (Data Center).\r\n- Chrome version is currently 79.0.3945.88 (although the problem exists across other Chrome versions and at least on the Safari browser as well from one user on a Mac).\r\n- The testing shows that there seems to be a bug with the Message Box macro from Adaptavist's app called Content Formatting for Confluence (currently running v6.4.3). The behavior is that although clicking the up/down arrows jumps the highlighting to the appropriate comment, it does not \"give focus\" to that comment if the comment is within a Message Box macro. Instead it either scrolls all the way to the top of the page, or the bottom of the page (seemingly determined by whichever is closer to the current position on the page). The only deviation from this is when the next comment is \"in view\" (visible) in the current browser window (adjusting the window size can be helpful to demonstrate this).\r\n- The testing shows that there seems to be a bug with the Info, Note, Tip and Warning macros that come bundled with Confluence. The behavior is that although clicking the up/down arrows jumps the highlighting to the appropriate comment, it does not \"give focus\" to that comment if the comment is within one of those four macros. Instead it simply stays at the current position. The only deviation from this is when the next comment is \"in view\" (visible) in the current browser window (adjusting the window size can be helpful to demonstrate this).\r\n- As the behaviors are very similar between the Adaptavist and Confluence macros, I suspect there is some underlying code (from the Confluence macros) that Adaptivist is using (or some of the same classes?).",

Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nFor a given image embedded within a Confluence page:\r\n # Edit the page.\r\n # Select the image and click on _Properties_.\r\n # Click on *Title*.\r\n # Leave the *Alt text* field blank.\r\n # Save the page.\r\n\r\nh3. Desired Results\r\n\r\nIf you right click on the page to view the rendered HTML and locate the image tag containing the image, there should be a reference to the _alt_ property within the image tag like this:\r\n{code:java}\r\n<img class=\"confluence-embedded-image\" height=\"250\" src=\"/conf/download/attachments/10059777/157%26MY_IMAGE.JPG?version=1&amp;modificationDate=1573766869993&amp;api=v2\"  title=\"My Title\" alt=\"\">\r\n{code}\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nIf you right click on the page to view the rendered HTML and locate the image tag containing the image, you'll notice that there's no reference of the _alt_ property within the image tag:\r\n{code:java}\r\n<img class=\"confluence-embedded-image\" height=\"250\" src=\"/conf/download/attachments/10059777/157%26MY_IMAGE.JPG?version=1&amp;modificationDate=1573766869993&amp;api=v2\"  title=\"My Title\">\r\n{code}",

They are inserted at the respective level (i.e. level 1 of the markdown is also level 1 of the page) and thus break the existing page layout.\u00a0\r\n\r\nAlso, the links then don't work.\r\n\r\nThe only way to work around this is to exclude all headings from the markdown in the TOC macro. But as the Markdown file is obviously edited on Bitbucket, this filtering will not work for long...\r\nh1. steps to reproduce\r\n # create a page with the TOC macro and some headings (best shown if you have mutliple levels)\r\n # include a markdown file with some headings using the {{Bitbucket file}} macro\r\n # Check the generated TOC\r\n\r\nh1. expected behavior\r\n\r\nThe markdown file is not parsed and not included in the TOC, keeping the page layout intact.\r\nh1. suggestion\r\n\r\nEither:\r\n * provide a filter to exclude the content of specific macros from being parsed and used in the TOC macro\r\n\r\nOr:\r\n * parse the content of the macro and insert it a level below the current header level.\r\n\r\nh1. background\r\n\r\nI wasn't sure whether to post this as a bug or as a suggestion. Seeing that [creating the TOC from HTML pages (see bullet under \"Notes and known issues\"|[https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/table-of-contents-macro-182682099.html]] seems to describe a similar but wanted behavior, I guess that having this could also be considered expected behavior.\r\n\r\nIf you create your page from multiple other pages, this seems fine. But for documentation purposes including markdown files (README.md, mostly) but having them collapsed is something we do quite often. This provides all required info in one place, but having this content show up in the TOC is distracting and creates more confusion.\r\n\r\nIf required, I'm happy to provide more details and / or\u00a0 screenshots of a sample page which illustrates the issue.",

But, in some cases, it will be helpful to directly present links to such content in page tree (ideally with a pad lock in front of Title to directly inform content is indeed restricted for given user), so user can easily request access to content owners.\r\n\r\n*Reasons :*\r\n * Broader awareness of restricted content (Spaces or sections are not \"empty\" or \"missing info\", users simply don't have access to content due to restrictions)\r\n * Avoidance of restricted content duplicates (Users are recreating similar content thinking it doesn't exist)\r\n * Ease access request as users can directly see content which is indeed restricted for them.\r\n * Ability to distinguish restricted content for limited users (not visible at all) and restricted content for larger audience (links in page tree).\r\n\r\n*Limits:*\r\n * It should remain possible to not show restricted content titles in Page tree. \r\n\r\n*Look'n feel*\r\n\r\nAn extra option in current restriction drop down menu.\r\n\r\n\"Limited viewing and editing restricted - Everyone can view Titles in Page tree, only some can fully view and edit\" to be placed 3rd position between \"Editing restricted\" and \"Viewing and editing restricted\".\r\n\r\n\u00a0",

      "description": "h3. Issue Summary\r\n\r\nWhen the sandbox conversion fails (OOM, timeout, etc), the JVM kills the sandbox abruptly instead of killing it gracefully. I suspect the Aspose conversion library uses something like\u00a0deleteOnExit(), which means that for the temporary font files it creates, no delete method is ever called given how we kill the sandbox so suddenly.\r\n\r\nThis might have other negative side effects that we don't know about, so we should attempt to kill the sandbox gracefully before we SIGKILL it.\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nBy looking at the java.io.tmpdir while we kill the Sandbox, we can see the difference between killing gracefully and not killing gracefully:\r\n{code:java}\r\n# kill sandbox gracefully, does clean up \r\n$ ls | grep .tmp | wc -l \r\n25 \r\n$ kill 30667 \r\n$ ls | grep .tmp | wc -l \r\n0 \r\n\r\n# kill sandbox with SIGKILL, does not clean up \r\n$ ls | grep .tmp | wc -l \r\n25 \r\n$ kill -9 30883 \r\n$ ls | grep .tmp | wc -l \r\n25\r\n# when another sandbox is created, there will now be 50 tmp files {code}\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nFiles are always cleaned up, even when sandbox crashes.\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nNot killing gracefully means that Aspose conversion library does not clean up tmp files properly. See above for how to reproduce.\r\nh3. Workaround\r\nThe location these tmp files are saved comes from the java.io.tmpdir parameter. A possible workaround for this issue could be to set that to a directory that gets cleaned up regularly by a scheduled job, for example <confluence-home>/temp.\r\n{code:java}\r\n-Dconversion.sandbox.java.options=-Djava.io.tmpdir=<confluence-home>/temp{code}",

Problem Definition\r\n\r\nWhen a long URL is included in a Jira issue and displayed in the Jira Issues Macro, the wrapping behavior makes the table much wider than desired in Chrome/Safari. The table is so wide that users must scroll sideways within the table.\r\n\r\nIn Firefox, the wrapping behavior is as desired and no sideways scrolling is necessary.\r\n\r\nIt appears this long URL wrapping issue can be reproduced outside of Atlassian products by putting a long URL into this test site:\r\n\r\n[https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/tryit.asp?filename=trycss_text_white-space]\r\n\r\nThe {{white-space: normal}} property wraps the long URL onto three lines in Firefox:\r\n !GoodWrap_Firefox.png|thumbnail! \r\n The {{white-space: normal}} property wraps the long URL onto just two lines in Chrome:\r\n !BadWrap_Chrome.png|thumbnail!\r\nh4.

Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nMake long URLs wrap in Chrome and Safari at a length that does not make the user need to scroll sideways.\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nView the page in Firefox.\r\n\r\nWe notice that tables in Confluence are forcing a wrap on the cells based on a percentage or pixel value, which seems to avoid this issue.\r\n (?) Can we take advantage of this fact to get the Jira Issue Macro to behave similarly?\r\n (?) As a workaround, can we make a custom macro or modify the CSS wrap to get the desired behavior?",
