[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFCLOUD-7789].\n  {panel}\n\nWikipedia (Mediawiki) search has both a \"Search\" and a \"Go\" button.  Search works a lot like the Confluence search, but Go looks for a single page with an exact title match (aided a lot by user creation of redirect pages) and takes the user to that page if it exists.  This is the biggest frustration our users have.  Salespeople and others looking for glossary-type pages want to type, say, \"Postgres\" and have a definitive Postgres page returned that defines the term.  I asked about this on the forums a while back, so here's a possible (very) high-level spec that I think  would work:\r\n\r\n* Add a Go button to the main search box in front of the Search button, and give the Go button the focus so it's used by default.\r\n* When the user clicks \"Go\" instead of Search, the search is assumed to be a title search and a request for an exact phrase match, and to be a Pages search only.\r\n* If there is a single result, the system immediately redirects the user to the page that matched the search.\r\n* If there are multiple pages with the same title and one of them is in the same space the user searched from, the system redirects the user to that page.\r\n* If there are multiple pages with the same title and none are is the space the user search from, or if the user searched from the dashboard, show the regular search results page.\r\n* If there are no exact titles matches, execute a regular search and show the result.  Ideally this also would default to searching the current space, which I believe is another request.\r\n\r\nPeople would go nuts over this - guaranteed!  Please add it ... \r\n\r\n",

If someone is editing a page in their personal space, and forgets to save, they are prompted that a draft copy exists and would the like to recover it. So far, so good. The problem is, when they click to recover or trash the draft, a page comes up saying they don't have permission to do so.\r\n\r\nA couple of things to note - the user in question is not an administrator, they are just a regular confluence user. This may or may not effect things...\r\n\r\nI don't know if this has been solved in later versions, could you confirm this one way or the other?\r\n\r\nThanks.",

While it is working, all users are locked out of confluence. On a web with 600 pages, (and perhaps 5000 total page revisions in the histories), doing a remove makes the rest of the wiki unavailable for 10-20 minutes. We are doing a series of conversion projects of moving webs from other wikis to confluence, and as we improve the converter, we need to be able to remove previous versions of webs from confluence before we rerun the converter on those webs.\r\n\r\nConfluence needs to minimize the amount of time the system is locked down, and do most of the remove on a background thread. It would be ok if a new space could not be created with the same space key until the remove is complete. A status screen would show the progress, and an API call to tell if the system is busy removing spaces, and which spaces it is removing.\r\n",

Some pages (like main pages or portal pages) on a site don't need comments. It isn't appropriate. Not only can you not disable commenting on a page (like through a simple checkbox on the edit page), but even if you disable editing of a page entirely, that still won't prevent commenting.\r\n\r\nPlease improve this situation. Best of all would be a simple checkbox: [ ] Users can comment on this page. I would also be ok with tying it to page permissions.\r\n\r\n{panel:title=Atlassian Status as of 1st November,  2011|borderStyle=solid|borderColor=#3C78B5| titleBGColor=#3C78B5| bgColor=#E7F4FA}\r\nHi Everyone,\r\nThanks for all your feedback on this issue. After much discussion we've concluded we won't be implementing this feature request. Our goal is to continue to simplify the product, by focusing on building for the majority of our customers. Whilst the ability to disable comments on a specific page or blog is a completely valid feature request, we believe it just crosses the line in terms of adding an extra level of complexity to the product and is a use case that isn't catering for the majority of our customers.  \r\n\r\nIn saying this, there are several ways in which this can still be achieved. For example, David Simpson [has written up a blog post of how this can be done with a simple user macro on a page|http://davidsimpson.me/2011/01/23/more-flexible-commenting-in-atlassians-confluence/]. Alternatively you could write a plugin to hide the comments block on a page. We welcome the plugin developer community to tackle this problem as it won't be something we will make core to the product.  \r\n\r\nThanks for your patience with this issue. \r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nSherif Mansour\r\nConfluence Product Manager\r\nsmansour at atlassian dot com\r\n\r\n{panel}",

However if I wish to find and refactor pages according to specific criteria (for example using a keyword filter), I could generate an RSS feed or a list of pages from the search engine but cannot extract or move this list of pages together to another space.  (or correct me if there is some way unknown to me of doing so)\r\n\r\nSuch ability to refactor based on filters would enable information modelling and architecture. Existing engines such as the hyperapplet-plugin or Touchgraph could then be used to develop 3D and 4D navigation models from within Confluence (without going through the RPC interface).\r\n\r\nGoing further, the ability to dynamically mirror (virtual refactoring) the pages into specific filters would allow to build and embed various space navigation models into the wiki to best suit each users desired perspective (without duplicating/changing the actual pages).\r\n\r\nI understand this may be going too much ahead for many users but our wiki has become so crowded with pages that the traditional navigation schemes are becoming inefficient. The search engine remains a good alternative but fails to show the inter-relations and global view of all available wiki pages. Therefore a solution is needed to FILTER/VIEW/NAVIGATE the wiki in a non-linear way.",
