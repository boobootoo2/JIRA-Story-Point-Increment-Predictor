      "description": "{panel:title=Atlassian Update - 26 Jan 2021|borderStyle=solid|borderColor=#ebf2f9 | titleBGColor=#ebf2f9 | bgColor=#ffffff}\r\nHi everyone,\r\n\r\nStarting from version 8.16.0, Jira will display an inline error message next to the \"Epic Link\" field if a user tries to use an Epic that they don't have edit permissions to.\r\n\r\n !Screenshot 2021-01-26 at 16.10.12.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nDaniel Rauf\r\nSoftware Engineer, Jira Data Center\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\nOVERVIEW\r\n\r\nThe \"Epic Link\" field on screens (e.g. during issue creation or editing) shows all Epics in projects for which the user has the \"Browse Projects\" permission. However, in order to actually create the link the user needs the \"Edit Issues\" permission for both the Epic and the issue being created/edited (note: not the \"Link Issues\" permission). If the user attempts to create/edit an issue and link to an Epic that the user does not have permission to link to (i.e. in another project with different permissions), no error or warning is given on saving the changes and the resulting Epic Link field is left blank.\r\n\r\nSTEPS TO REPRODUCE\r\n\r\n# Create two projects PROJA and PROJB.\r\n# Create an epic in PROJA.\r\n# Create a user and grant them *only* the \"Browse Projects\" permission for PROJA, and all permissions for PROJB.\r\n# Log in as the above user.\r\n# Create an issue in PROJB and use the \"Epic Link\" field to find the epic created in PROJA.\r\n# Having created the issue, verify that no warning/error was given to say that the user doesn't have permission to link to the selected epic, and that the Epic Link field has been left empty.\r\n\r\nUSE CASE\r\n\r\nWe have a large number of teams working on a single JIRA instance across multiple projects. For reasons I won't go into (but can if need be), it is common for work in one project to be linked to an Epic in another. We also want to allow everyone to be able to \"view\" what is going on across the business in all projects, but want to control who can link to Epics in specific projects. Hence, all users are granted the \"Browse Projects\" permission, but further permissions are granted on a project by project basis, and users are only able to link to a small fraction of the projects which they can view.\r\n\r\nThe problems this bug causes with this use case are:\r\n\r\n# A large number of Epics (several hundred in our case) are made available to a user even though they can't link to them in reality. Some other recent changes have made finding Epics easier, but it is still frustrating to have so many irrelevant Epics in the field.\r\n# If a mistake is made (very easy when many projects have similarly named Epics) and an unlinkable Epic is selected, the lack of warning/error means that this can go unnoticed by users, and can be much harder to rectify in hindsight.\r\n\r\nSUGGESTED FIXES\r\n\r\nMy preferred solution would be for the Epic Link field to only show Epics which the user can link to. If there is a reason I can't foresee for wanting to have unlinkable Epics in the screen, then at least providing a warning or preferably an error when the link is attempted would also be helpful, but would in the end only serve to highlight the underlying problem with the Epics shown in the Epic Link field.",

We've now migrated our issues to JIRA, but this means that the new JIRA ID (for example XYZ-123) no longer matches and so we don't get the link in Fisheye.\r\n\r\nMy initial plan of attack was to edit the history in our source control so that the old FogBugz issue was replaced by the JIRA issue. However, we use Mercurial and changing history is quite complex.\r\n\r\nIt would be great if each issue had a 'Fisheye Issue ID' field which defaulted to the JIRA ID but could be changed. That way we could go through the imported issues and change this value to the old FogBugz issue ID and get the Source tab integration working as normal.

      "description": "We have cases where many Jira projects use a large group of repos. This use case causes us huge effort in creating the links between Jira and Fisheye. Assume there are 10 Jira projects and 50 repos. The fisheye plugin now requires us to create 500 applinks by hand:(. We are now facing a support case that may require us to recreate several thousand applinks: https://support.atlassian.com/browse/FSH-9879.\r\n\r\nWhat can be done?\r\n\r\nI can think of a few things:\r\n\r\n* Fisheye has projects. If there is one Fisheye project that already includes the 50 repos (this is in fact the case for us), then it would suffice to link the 10 Jira projects with the 1 Fisheye project. This would reduce the number of manually created links to 50, a 10x saving in effort. Our experience, however, is that the Jira project must be linked *both* to the Fisheye project *and* the repos.\r\n\r\n* I have found out that the fisheye plugin in jira-4.2 and below allowed you to link a repo with many projects in one action (see https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/uYCQDg and comment of 10.9 below), but this is no longer possible. This functionality would reduce our 500 actions to 50!\r\n\r\n* Why are project-specific repo applinks needed at all? We assume this is because it would take too long to search all repos in Fisheye for a given issue, but surely this is a problem that can be solved by an appropriate index in Fisheye, something Atlassian is very good at:).\r\n\r\n* Failing all this, how about an API call that creates the applinks so at least we can script this?\r\n",

      "description": "I am using the \"no unreviewed changesets\" and \"no Open Crucible reviews\" transition conditions to prevent tickets from being closed if commits have not been reviewed in Crucible. This works really well *until* there is a merge commit that has a commit message containing the JIRA issue id. This commit will show up on the issue page because the merge commit message contains the JIRA issue id. This is expected, however, this merge commit will block the ticket from being closed because the \"no unreviewed changesets\" wants it to be reviewed but Crucible does not support reviewing merge commits (see FE-4004). \r\n\r\nSo, there is a chicken before the egg type problem.... \"no unreviewed changesets\" wants the commit to be reviewed but this isn't possible because there is no way to review it.\r\n\r\nAt least, this is what I think is happening. \r\n\r\nh3. To Reproduce\r\n\r\nReproduce steps are a little complicated because it requires a lot of configuration, but it will look something like:\r\n\r\n# Setup Fisheye and JIRA\r\n# Configure a JIRA workflow transaction to require \"no unreviewed changesets\"\r\nIt will look something like\r\n!Transitions.png|thumbnail!\r\n# Commit some code to an JIRA issue. Include at least one merge commit.\r\n#* Make sure there is a merge commit message that contains the JIRA issue id.\r\n# Review the non-merge commit. See commit list screenshot... the non-merge commit has a closed code review, but the non-merge commit does not\r\n!Commits.png|thumbnail!\r\n# Try to transition the issue...\r\n\r\nExpected Behavior: Can successfully transition issue\r\nActual Behavior: The transition button does not appear. Presumably because the merge commit has not been reviewed.\r\n\r\nThis is becoming a problem for us when we create feature branches in Stash, and then try to use Crucible to review the changes. All Stash created branches have the JIRA issue id contained in the branch name by default, which is interfering with the  \"no unreviewed changesets\"  condition.\r\n\r\nThere are 2 workarounds:\r\n\r\n# Make sure branch names don't contain JIRA issue ids. This is sub-optimal because it breaks the new JIRA 6.2 stash branch list support\r\n# Or, disable the \"no unreviewed changesets\" condition.

After this expired, JIRA was very slow to respond, and resource utilization on the database was greatly increased. Load times for issues went from < 1 second to 15-20 seconds average.\r\n\r\nImmediately after applying a new evaluation license for Crucible, performance went back to normal, and load times / resource utilization dropped.\r\n\r\nUpdate: This only affected JIRA users that had access to Crucible. When non-crucible users viewed a page, load times and resource utilization was normal. I am assuming this is because of the source and review tabs in JIRA.\r\n\r\nLinked Applications:\r\nJIRA v5.2.10#853-sha1:c0ba268\r\nFECRU 2.10.4 Build:20130403093648 2013-04-03\r\nConfluence 5.1.1",

Steps to reproduce:\r\n- Setup a JIRA and a FishEye (I've used 2.7.10) instance;\r\n- Set the Application Links between them (I've used Trusted Application);\r\n- In FishEye, configure two (or more) repositories.\r\n-- It could be any kind of repo, I've tried with SVN and GIT, both in the file system, but it happens on a remote repository as well.\r\n- Add some files on the repository and create a commit with a comment linking to an issue;\r\n-- Make sure that it will be displayed under the \"Source\" tab from an issue;\r\n-- Make sure that the \"Source\" tab (from the \"Project\" screen, not from an issue) is working and displaying data from all repositories;\r\n- Now, in FishEye, stop a repository;\r\n\r\nh3. Current Behavior:\r\n- Browse to the \"Source\" tab from an issue and it will display an error regarding to the stopped repository; However, the content from the repository which is working is being displayed;\r\n!IssueSourceTab1.png!\r\n- Browse to the \"Source\" tab from the Project screen: It will stop showing only the error message from the stopped repository. Nothing else (see image below)\r\n!SouceTab1.png!\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Behavior:\r\n- The \"Source\" tab should display the content from the running repository.\r\n\r\nTested from JIRA 4.4.5 to 5.1.8.",
