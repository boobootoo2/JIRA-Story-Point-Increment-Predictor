So at your team/project you need to put your vacation information for example on two systems.\r\n- So managing personal Calendar information in only one system (the personal one in outlook) would be nice. --> Team calendar should only aggregate calendar information.\r\n\r\nTo integrate Outlook I see following possibilities:\r\n- It gets an adapter to fetch MS-Exchange Calendar Information (providing server and authentification information)\r\n- there is a plugin/modus via export/import\r\n- There is a Module/Plugin for Outlook to bind it into Outlook Client and set up write/read permissions to the Team Calendar... :)\r\n- maybe other more ideas.\r\n",
