Other people receive emails without a problem. I have tried 'Send test email' through Adminisitration->Mail Servers which works just fine. I am also receiving e-mails when other pages I am watching are modified. I have tried to 'stop watching' and 'watch' again several times but to no avail. I also checked to see if leaving it at 'stop watching' would fix it (in case the bit was flipped) and that did not help either.\r\n\r\nThis is repeatable. I created a calendar with account A. When account B created new events, account A would *not* receive watch notifications. But when account A edited that calendar account B would receive emails. I tried with two accounts, two calendars.  \r\n\r\nMy workaround right now is that I created a new account which subscribes to the calendar. That new account is affiliated with a different e-mail address.\r\n",

Other than that, from our findings Google Calendar macro is displaying fine in any cards of deck.\r\nThus, we suspect the issue comes from Team Calendar Plugin itself, which is not compatible in tabs.

However, restriction checking on usernames in Team Calendars is not case insensitive. Usernames {{test}} and {{TEST}} are treated different by Team Calendars.\r\n\r\nThis proves to be a problem when Confluence content indexing is corrupted/not updated, because Team Calendars acquires user names from auto-complete widget, which is based on index. For example, assume the following scenario:\r\n# Username in the index: {{USER1}}. Username in {{cwd_user}} table is: {{user1}}\r\n# A user applies an edit restriction on a calendar for {{USER1}}\r\n#* Team Calendars saves the information in the database, specifically in the {{BANDANA}} table ({{__edit_events_users__}} key): {code}<set>\r\n  <string>USER1</string>\r\n</set>{code}\r\n# When {{USER1}} tries to edit, it is not able to edit the calendar because of the difference in casing\r\n# Updating the record in the database from {{USER1}} to {{user1}} fixed the issue\r\n\r\nConclusion: Team Calendars should behave the same way as Confluence when it comes to restriction checking. Usernames with different casing should be treated the same.",
