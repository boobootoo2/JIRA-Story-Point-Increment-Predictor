Our confluence instance is tied to AD, so his account was deactivated. I ended up going through the AD team to reactivate his account, reset his password, then log in as him in order to see his drafts (which in turned allowed us to save some other content he had started but not saved). Is there no way for a Confluence administrator to view and delete drafts for a specific user? That feature would be incredibly helpful.",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFCLOUD-35903].\n  {panel}\n\nWe are looking forward to live editing within Confluence.  In order to support group editing of meeting notes during our public forums, where anyone around the world may join and we want to encourage everyone to help edit the notes, we'd like to have the option to put the page into an \"edit by default\" state while the meeting is taking place.  Rather than requiring everyone to navigate to the meeting notes _and_ be brave & motivated enough to hit an edit button, we would appreciate the option, while the notes are being taken, for users who navigate to the page (assuming they have edit privileges) to start in the collaborative live editing mode.\r\n\r\nOne of the powers of etherpad (and Google Docs) for community note-taking is people are instantly in edit mode as soon as they navigate to the page.  While clicking an edit button may seem trivial, it can represent a real barrier to getting contributions from those who have never edited a wiki page before, are new to the community and uncertain if they should be editing the page, or regular attendees only partially engaged in the meeting.\r\n\r\nSo, as live editing comes to Confluence, please consider adding an \"edit by default\" option for pages being actively edited by others.  This could be implemented as a general configuration option (e.g., \"When live editing, newcomers join live editing automatically\") and/or a page-specific option (e.g., \"Newcomers join live edit automatically\" checkbox somewhere near the \"Invite others\" link).",

Invitations is a great option; however, please make collaborative live editing the default behavior when editing.  In other words, invitations should not be required to collaborate.\r\n\r\nOur use case is online community meetings where anyone in our community may join.  We can have 10 or 20 attendees, we don't know who is going to show up ahead of time, and we want to encourage everyone who does attend to help with meeting notes.  We are currently using an etherpad instance for notes and copying notes into Confluence after the meeting.  We are hoping  live editing within Confluence can replace etherpad; however, if invitations are required to collaborate, it will not support our ad hoc collaboration.\r\n\r\nA natural and intuitive approach would be to allow anyone with privileges to edit the page to join in collaborative editing without an invitation.  Invitations could still be used to send notifications to specific people and edit restrictions on the page could be used to restrict editing. ",
