This was done under the banner of cluster cache optimisation, but it in effect it completely bypasses the transactional semantics of the caches in question.\r\n\r\nThe most noticeable effect of this is a recurrence of the \"user already exists\" and \"directory removed during iteration\" errors that used to plague the builds before they were fixed by the introduction of transactional caches.\r\n\r\nWhile this change did go into stable, at this point we do not believe that it is likely to have a noticeable impact on production systems. If it does, it'll most likely have similar impacts to the test failure messages mentioned above, where caches related to users or user directories go stale.\r\n\r\nHowever, we should be alive to the possibility that customers will report issues along these lines (cc [~shaffenden]).\r\n\r\nFor now, we'll get this fixed ASAP on stable and get it merged to master toot sweet.

Steps to reproduce:\r\n# Install a Confluence 5.5.2 instance;\r\n# Install a JIRA instance 6.2.6, and add a single line text field with name *Length* and global context;\r\n(i) This issue also occurs when defining name *Length* in the [customfield translation|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Configuring+a+Custom+Field#ConfiguringaCustomField-Translatingacustomfield].\r\n# Setup an application link between Confluence and JIRA;\r\n# Create a page and open the JIRA Issues Macro, and try and run any sort of query. \r\n\r\nThe results will return, but attempting to click the \"Insert\" button won't do anything. Checking the JavaScript console in the browser should show the error above. \r\n\r\nh4. Additional information:\r\nAfter some debugging we narrowed it down to the fact that Confluence doesn't appear to escape some field names that can be misinterpreted as array method names. In this case, the Jira custom field was called *Length* and appears to be misinterpreted as a call to the {{array.length()}} method of a given array r[]\r\n\r\nThis didn't happen with Confluence 5.1.5, so the bug was introduced since then.\r\n\r\nh4. Diagnosis:\r\nRunning this SQL Query on Jira Database should yield the easiest diagnosis if there is a custom field called *length*:\r\n{code:title=Run on Jira Database}\r\nselect * from customfield where lower(cfname) = 'length'\r\n{code}\r\n\r\n\r\nh4. Workaround: \r\n# Access the URL {{http://<JIRA_URL>/rest/api/2/field}} and use the search functionality in your browser to find the word *Length*, or execute the query bellow to identify the custom field that is causing this issue: \r\n{code:sql} \r\nselect ps.propertyvalue as \"Translation\", cf.cfname as \"Custom field\" from propertystring ps join propertyentry pe on pe.id=ps.id join customfield cf on cf.id=pe.entity_id \r\nwhere pe.property_key like'%jira.translation.custom.fieldcustomfield%' and lower(ps.propertyvalue)='length' or lower(cf.cfname)='length'; \r\n{code} \r\n# Rename the custom field or custom field translation.",

We're are plan to roll out on better memory calculation algorithm and better handling of concurrent macro rendering however there is no ETA.\r\n\r\n*BTF workaround*:\r\n  For BTF (Behind The Firewall) admins could start confluence with -Dpdf.render.memory.guard.disabled=true property in order to disable memory guard. That will make all pdfs to be rendered.\r\n(!) Note: Disabling this memory guard can cause [OutOfMemoryErrors|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/CONFKB/How+to+Fix+Out+of+Memory+Errors+by+Increasing+Available+Memory] if a high resolution image is embedded in a PDF. \r\n\r\n\r\n*EDIT 21/04/2015*\r\n  Current pdf macro is deprecated and replaced by `Files and Images` (available from toolbar). More details are onto https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/Cloud/Displaying+Files+and+Images\r\n\r\n*Update 23/11/2015* \r\n  Condition was reversed. You won't need to put system property and by default images size within pdf is not limited for BTF installations.",

For now that means French, and maybe other languages later on.\r\n\r\nThis means that we need to get the How-To and Troubleshooting templates translated. What I did first was un-promoting the original templates, and creating new templates based on what the original ones contained (ctrl-A, ctrl-C, ctrl-V), then promoting those custom templates. Works great!\r\n\r\nSadly, that means that the Page Template Wizard does not act the same at all with the \"copied\" templates: \r\n* Instead of a modal window with the Title and Labels fields to fill, I get a full-page with two small fields for the $descriptionHtml and $contentbylabelMacro variables\r\n* Instead of a page pre-filled with the correct title and the correct Content-by-label Macro setting, I get the text from the variables as-is, within the content.\r\n\r\nReading the documentation (https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Adding+a+Template), I understand that this is the way variables are supposed to work for now. But I find it odd that the default templates would benefit from a pretty modal window and pre-filled sections, when custom templates have to fallback on something less ideal.\r\n\r\nIn the end, instead of un-promoting the default templates and promoting my own translated templates, I simply translated the default templates (save for the template title, which apparently cannot be changed).\r\n\r\nStill, I do hope Atlassian is planning on pushing this Template Wizard feature further. This would be of tremendous help for KB administrators.\r\n\r\nThank you for reading.",
