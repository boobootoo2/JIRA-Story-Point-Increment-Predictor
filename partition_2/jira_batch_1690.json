Provide example kickstarts to get new users up and running more quickly on starter licenses\r\n2. Provide the ability to spin up development/DR environments on demand (by pointing to restore files etc as part of the kickstart).\r\n3. Decrease the time it takes to prepare a new installation and make \"Here be Dragons\" an easier quest for all future questorians.",

Note\r\n\r\nThis error message is the catch-all exception for the JIRA Issues Macro, so there are a number of possible causes for this. The below example is one way of triggering the problem. Another known cause is the response from JIRA taking too long and exceeding the timeouts in Confluence.

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFCLOUD-34783].\n  {panel}\n\nConfluence bundles a copy of tomcat in its installer. Right now, administrators have to directly modify several files in a tomcat install, including the server.xml (or corresponding web-app-name.xml file), log4j.properties, catalina.properties, and any other configuration files read during service startup (e.g. setenv.sh in unix environments). None of these customizations are carried across to the next upgrade, which requires more manual intervention by the administrator installing the upgrade to resolve.\r\n\r\nConfluence should provide a standard way of configuring these settings so that administrator customizations are cleanly separated from installation defaults, and so that we can detect if there are any conflicting changes during upgrades, and so that we can carry those customizations across to upgraded installs, and minimize the amount of work an administrator has to do for a typical upgrade.",

      "description": "*Scenario:*\r\n\r\n- You start editing a page, and the server gets restarted. You have a persistent auth cookie (\"remember me box checked on login\") so your periodical heartbeat keeps working, but your XSRF token (tied to the session ID) has expired.\r\n- If you are editing the page and hit \"preview\", the REST resource will respond with 403 (it does the anti forgery check). Also the periodical \"save draft\" will fail for the same reason so you get stuck in a situation where the only way out is try saving the page (the action will fail but a new xsrf token will be issued), which sucks.\r\n\r\n*How to reproduce it easily:*\r\n\r\n- Create a blog post or page\r\n- Go to Chrome tools and change the xsrf token value by editing manually all the  \r\n{code}\r\n<meta name=\"ajs-atl-token\" content=\"49a13104891a700a54406dfdf3437cb4275dc167\">\r\n<meta id=\"atlassian-token\" name=\"atlassian-token\" content=\"49a13104891a700a54406dfdf3437cb4275dc167\">\r\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"atl_token\" value=\"49a13104891a700a54406dfdf3437cb4275dc167\">\r\n{code}\r\n (not sure why we have so many different meta tags containing the xsrf, this ticket may a good opportunity to find out)\r\n- Now hit preview and you will get something similar to the screenshot attached.\r\n\r\n*Potential fixes/improvements:*\r\n\r\n- Better notifications. We can check the status code of the response error. If it is 403, we can tell the user what's going on.\r\n- Or better, we can reissue a new XSRF token from the server, and resubmit. Or get a new XSRF and ask the user to resubmit.\r\n- As mentioned above, this needs to be addressed in both preview and save draft.\r\n- A similar solution can be applied to fix CONFDEV-24392 (XSRF token expiration when hitting save)",

Using this example, the report should show 4 incomplete tasks (from the default home page)\r\n\r\nh5.Actual Result\r\nThe Task Report Macro doesn't show the tasks that are incomplete. Marking a task as complete and then incomplete doesn't show the task either.\r\n\r\nThe task does not appear in the database. \r\n\r\nh5.Workaround (not applicable to Confluence Cloud)\r\n# Perform a full backup of the Confluence Database\r\n# Shutdown Confluence\r\n# Execute the following SQL Queries: {code:sql}\r\ndelete from \"AO_BAF3AA_AOINLINE_TASK\";\r\ndelete from bandana where bandanakey = 'com.atlassian.confluence.plugins.confluence-inline-tasks:build';\r\n{code}\r\n# Start Confluence\r\n\r\nConfluence will re-migrate any inline tasks to the new inline task format, which will correctly re-add the tasks not handled when importing.\r\n\r\nh3. Notes\r\n\r\nIt is possible to tweak the migration task thread number to speed up the process.

A simple change - changing the text from 'Additional Instructions' to 'Additional Instructions to Adstream' - would make it foolproof. \r\n\r\nI had to check myself whether this fed through to the Broadcaster interface (and so was somewhere for clients to write instructions for the Broadcaster) or whether it only fed through to Adstream Traffic (and was intended for instructions only for them). \r\n\r\nIf a client believes it feeds through to Broadcasters, we could get stuck if they enter an important instruction in good faith and we miss passing it on to the Broadcaster or flagging to the client that the Broadcaster won't see the comment  and they'll need to contact them themselves. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nCharlotte",

Our displayName attribute is in the format of \"Lastname, Firstname\" which doesn't look very nice when doing user mentions. And at this point, we can't change the format of our AD attribute.\r\n\r\nSo I followed [this Atlassian article|https://confluence.atlassian.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=296094848] which describes how you can change your User Directory config to make Confluence instead use \"givenname + sn\" for displaying user's names (by putting in a bogus attribute). I did that, resync'd the directory with AD, and restarted Confluence and all the user's Profile pages now show a nice \"Firstname Lastname\" for their Full Name, which is great. But...\r\n\r\nWhen I go to do a user mention with \"@\", they still show up and auto-complete using the old \"Lastname, Firstname\" format. How do we get User Mention's to reflect an LDAP user's new Full Name?\r\n\r\nNote: If I create a LOCAL Confluence user, and change his 'Full Name' (and clear the User Properties cache), it's friendly name in the User Mention reflects the change correctly. Just doesn't seem to work with LDAP users.\r\n\r\nI asked this on Answers, but haven't gotten an answer and I think it could be a bug. https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/329713/change-user-mention-display-name",
