While this is set to fully release for spaces in early 2022, this GIF problem should be resolved at least for page level exports in Q4 2021.\u00a0We acknowledge that this has run into delays as the development team wants to ensure that we will not regress on functionality with the architectural improvements.\r\n\r\nWe know you have been waiting eagerly for this fix as we are, and we will be providing any updates as they come. Thank you again for your patience.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\n\r\nSteven\r\n{panel}\r\nh3. Issue Summary\r\n\r\nIn some cases, a specific attachment (PNG or GIF) will prevent the page and the entire space from being exported to PDF.\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Create a page\r\n # Insert the GIF or PNG image (we were only able to reproduce this using specific GIFs and specific PNG images)\r\n # Set the image to a lower pre-defined size (small or medium)\r\n # Publish the page\r\n # Try to export the page or the entire space to PDF\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nIt should export the page/ space without problems\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nThe following error is thrown, generally at 50% for the export:\r\n{code:none}\r\nThere was an error in the export. Please check your log files.{code}\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nThere're three available workarounds:\r\n *For the new editor*:\r\n * Individually export the affected page instead of using the space export.\r\n\r\n*For both editors*:\r\n * Remove the image or replace it with a different image (other than the affected GIF/PNG)\r\n * Set the image to its original size or a manual value - it seems to fail only with the preset sizes (small, medium) (Legacy editor only)",

Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Create a page with a phrase written inside eg \"This is Test\", \"Hello World\"\r\n # Create a page with a title of the same phrase. Use the advanced search option to enter the phrase in double-quotes.\r\n # [https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/confluence-search-syntax-158720.html]\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nIt should only search for the pages containing this phrase or title.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nIt considers every single word to search. \r\n\r\nPlease note: Considering the imitations with the exact match search in Confluence where \r\n Confluence ignores common words (stop words) and \r\n Phrases with special characters\r\nh3.
