Click on *switch back*\r\n # Close the browser\r\n # Open it again, and access the Instance. You will be logged with the original account, but the pop up will still appear, and the *switch back* link will not do anything\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nA manual workaround is to have the admin to navigate to\u00a0{{<siteurl>/impersonate}}, which will reset the impersonate function. e.g. [acme.atlassian.net/impersonate|http://acme.atlassian.net/impersonate]",

The \"_jQuery_\" is one of them: when we add a header name with this term, our pages do not behave well.\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Create a new page;\r\n # Add a title to it;\r\n # Chose any header style and type \u201c_jQuery_\u201d in it;\r\n # Publish the page;\r\n # Refresh it.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nThe page is refreshed with no issues.\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nThe page breaks with a random error code, like the message below:\r\n!image-2021-01-18-09-55-02-433.png!\r\n\r\n*Notes*:\r\n * This behavior is presented with all the header options on Confluence;\r\n * Apparently, after publishing the page the error doesn't come up at the first moment, but eventually when the browser needs to refresh the cached session, then it will happen without the need to force the browser refresh;\r\n * It also happens on already published pages;\r\n * Confluence seems to read \"_jQuery_\" as an HTML object when it is added to a header, as it names the header ID with the same title as the header text:\r\n{code:html}\r\n<h1 id=\"jQuery\" data-renderer-start-pos=\"1\">jQuery </h1>{code}\r\n\r\n * Once the page is refreshed, then Confluence will try to get this object, but as it is not about jQuery itself, it throws an error in the backend (also possible to see it in the browser console):\r\n{code:java}\r\nTypeError: Object(...) is not a function{code}\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nEither remove the header format or add more text to the header (instead of \"_jQuery_\", for example, you can add \"_The jQuery_\". You can do this from your browser by accessing the editing mode of this page directly from the URL: {{https://<SITENAME>.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/<SPACEKEY>/pages/edit-v2/<CONTENTID>}}",

By default, only Confluence admins can change page restrictions, but that gets tedious when several system administrators are making pages that need different restrictions for their teams. When I give a user the ability to change restrictions, they can change restrictions on all pages. There is no middle ground for restriction settings.\r\n\r\nWhat would help is the ability to permit page creators to change restrictions on pages they create and child pages under those pages. These user-imposed restrictions could be overridden by a space admin as need be. The ability for a user to change restrictions on pages they've created could be added/removed by a space admin via permissions, and it might even be controlled on a page-by-page basis if needed. The default permission would be what it is currently: users lacking permissions to change restrictions. Like the \"Delete Own\" permission, it could be the \"Restrict Own\" permission.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what the perfect implementation would look like, but these are the thoughts I have.

Issue Summary\r\n\r\nCurrently, when a free user imports a space into their Confluence site and try to then export it again, it may not be possible.\r\n\r\nThis happens when the imported space does not have a group or user under its permissions that is common between Confluence sites.\r\n\r\nIf you are a user in both sites and you also have enough permissions on the exported site on the Confluence of origin, you will be able to export it when it is imported into another Confluence Site.\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Create a space in Confluence A\r\n # Add the desired permissions (make sure that both groups and users are not the same between Confluence Sites)\r\n # Export it\r\n # Import the recently exported space into Confluence B\r\n # Go into Space Settings > Content Tools\r\n # Try to export the space\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nThe export option is present and active\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nPermissions carry over from the other Confluence site and the users who imported the space is unable to export it if needed.\r\nh3.
