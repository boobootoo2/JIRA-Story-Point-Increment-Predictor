Issue Summary\r\n\r\nWhen selecting a quick filter in an active sprint or kanban backlog board that filters sub-tasks of a ticket that shows up in the swimlane will result in hiding the parent's status label and issue type icon.\r\n\r\nh3. Environment\r\n\r\nReproducible on Jira 8.0.2\r\nNot reproducible on Jira 7.7 and 7.13\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Login with the administrator account\r\n # Create a Jira Software scrum or kanban project\r\n # Create a story and assign it to User A\r\n # Create a sub-task of that story and assign it to User B\r\n # Add swimlane to the stories, and add two quick filters - one to look for issues assigned to User A, and another to look for issues assigned to User B\r\n # At the active sprint view or kanban backlog, select the first quick filter to User A. The parent ticket will still have it's issue type icon and status label information in the swimlane\r\n # Unselect the quick filter, and select the quick filter to look for ticket assigned to User B (assignee of subtask)\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nThe parent ticket will persist with the ticket's information of issue type icon and status label.\r\n\r\nh3.

Overview\r\n\r\nCurrently in Jira Service Desk projects and (according to [documention|https://confluence.atlassian.com/jiracoreserver073/linking-issues-861257339.html] ) Jira Core business projects you can use an issue action called 'Create linked issue' to create a new issue that will be linked to the current one. I would like this functionality on Jira Software Project issues. Ideally this would exist as an action in the More menu that could also be accessed with the '.' issue actions keyboard shortcut to be accessed from the kanban/scrum boards and backlogs as well.\r\nh2. Example\r\n\r\nOften in our \"software\" projects (we use them for IT management operations) we are creating issues and then manually linking them as we find an issue creating new work. A bug that is resolved by changing settings in a few different systems, a task for doing an audit\u00a0 of something and then a whole bunch of problems to fix, and so forth. It would be very helpful to not have to manually add a link after or during the creation of an issue. Especially since this functionality already exists for Jira Service Desk and Jira Core. We use it in Jira service desk, but more often need it on Jira software projects.",

This allows users to quickly populate a board with issues.\r\n\r\n !image-2019-04-01-23-49-46-788.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\nHowever, when a board uses a filter which contains multiple projects, users cannot take advantage of this quick issue creation, and are required to use the full issue creation screen. This is due to Jira being unable to determine the intended project the issue should be created under.\r\n\r\n !image-2019-04-01-23-51-29-504.png|thumbnail!  \r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nAdministrators and Board Owners may wish to preserve the ability to use the quick issue creation in boards with multiple projects. To do so, they would need to be able to configure a default project for the board. This could be implemented in the Board Configuration.\r\n\r\nh3.

Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Create a project\r\n# Create a new workflow, that has To Do, In Progress, Done (along with one outgoing transition from each status\r\n# Create a new workflow scheme, and add your workflow scheme to it. Make sure to only use \"All unassigned issue types\"; rather than \"All issue types\" as per JSWSERVER-8720.\r\n# Change the project to the new scheme\r\n# Assign a non admin user to the \"Administrators\" role in the project.\r\n# Ensure the \"Administrators\" role has the \"Administer Project\" permission and that \"Extended Project Permission\" is enabled\r\n#* This is the default permission scheme in Jira software\r\n# As the Project Administrator (but not System Administrator) visit the board and choose \"Configure Board \u00bb Columns\"\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nThe \"Simplify Workflow\" button should be enabled.\r\n\r\nh3.
