However, this does not allow me to create these calendars for historical data. \r\n\r\nI think it would be good if we can get Team Calendar to use the created field that is native to issues in JIRA to display from.\r\n\r\nScreenie attached.",

This test is causing us to waste a lot of time in the moment since Team Calendars changes the DOM of its UI on a regular basis, and due to the separate repositories it is hard to fix a test ahead of a release.\r\n\r\nWe just had the case where Matt fixed the test to work for TC 2.4.1, but the 5.0-OD-4 release contains TC 2.3.0. Thus his fix worked for our [CBAC build|https://confluence-bamboo.atlassian.com/browse/COD-MODAT-1601], which takes the confluence-production-integration branch from the ondemand-fireball repository and bakes that together with a snapshot from the Confluence master branch. In the same time, that broke the [BEAC build|https://bamboo.extranet.atlassian.com/browse/JST-JSTGIT21-1] which runs against a released version of Confluence in order to prepare integration into OnDemand. Having to maintain a separate branch where this fixes can be applied against a snapshot of Confluence would be too much effort imo, as the person releasing would have to know which commits to merge in. Instead, we should write the above mentioned test in a backwards-compatible manner, that is to reuse the page objects of TC. If that is not possible the spec of that test should be extracted and re-written in TC.\r\n",

Just spoke to Sam and she suggested the following:\n* instead of an alert, just have a checkbox next to the \"Add\" button like we do in comments:\n* (nice to have) have that checkbox tie into the user's autowatch settings...so that it's checked by default if the user has autowatched turned on and un-checked by default if the user has turned off the autowatch setting in Conflunence.\n\n!https://img.skitch.com/20110722-d5g6nr89hakhemdngnm2ak82sa.png!",

Its recurrence function is elegantly simple and very powerful. As it is, to create the calendar I want, I have to create them in outlook, export as iCal and then import into Team Calendars. It's nice to be able to do that, but this seems like a feature that should exist within the Team Calendars recurrence functionality.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n{panel:title=Atlassian Status as of January 9, 2018|borderStyle=solid|borderColor=#3c78b5|titleBGColor=#3c78b5|bgColor=#e7f4fa}\r\nYou'll be pleased to hear that we've shipped this improvement in our latest Team Calendars release (5.5.0).

However, the performance impact is huge.\nFrom what I can tell the performance slow down is a combination of re-loading all calendar information for changes that affect only a single calendar, and the browser then parsing the returned calendar data, generating the DOM, and re-painting.

This is a slightly different set of API requirements than the ability to create, edit and update calendar events.\r\n\r\nThis issue is to track the general requirements to:\r\n* Get a listing (or sub-set) of calendars based on some query \r\n* Get some calendar metadata \r\n** Creator\r\n** Last updated \r\n** # of events\r\n** etc...  \r\n\r\n{panel:title=Atlassian Status as of January 2019|borderStyle=solid|borderColor=#3c78b5|titleBGColor=#3c78b5|bgColor=#e7f4fa}\r\nHi all,\r\n\r\nThanks for all of your votes and comments on this suggestion.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, this suggestion isn't currently on our roadmap. We do though understand the value such an API would bring, and and will consider this suggestion at a later date.\r\n\r\nFor those of you who aren\u2019t aware, in our Team Calendars 5.5 and 6.0 releases we brought a range of new improvements, including a fresh new look and feel, better event frequency options, and CalDAV \u2013 the ability to use Team Calendars in your favourite calendar app. For more information on these improvements, see:\u00a0[5.5 release notes|https://confluence.atlassian.com/teamcal/team-calendars-5-5-0-release-notes-942863254.html], and\u00a0[6.0 release notes|https://confluence.atlassian.com/teamcal/team-calendars-6-0-release-notes-947182030.html].\r\n\r\nBest wishes,\r\nJenny | Confluence Server Product Manager\r\n{panel}",
