Tested with JIRA 6.4.13 and 7.2.4 with the same results.\r\n\r\nh3.Workaround\r\nMove the issue macro outside the panel. Upgrading to Confluence 5.10.8 or higher should solve the issue.",

Publish it.\r\n* Click edit to start a new draft.\r\n* Go to the attachments screen of the page and delete the attached image\r\n* Go back to the page and press edit\r\n\r\n*Actual behaviour*\r\n\r\n* The editor still shows the attachment\r\n\r\n*Expected behaviour*\r\n\r\n* The editor should show \"Unknown attachment\"\r\n\r\nThis happens because the editor format of the page changes even though the page does not get edited. However, Synchrony still has the old editor format.\r\n\r\nThis is also true for links and macros. For example, deleting a page that was linked to from another page results in this same behavior, as well as deleting a plug-in while one of its macros is used on a page. The page in edit mode still looks like the macro is present even though in view mode it shows up as \"Unknown macro.\"\r\n\r\n*Workaround*\r\n\r\nThe workaround is to publish the page if this happens. Publishing the page forces Synchrony to get the new editor format. The editor format will now say correctly \"Unknown attachment\" or \"Unknown macro\" or will point to a non-existent link. The real solution in that case is to remove that part of the page or replace it with the new attachment or link.",

      "description": "After about an hour or two I tried to edit another page in our Confluence 6.0 rc5 test instance.\r\nI got an error when trying to edit the page. This seems to be a timeout issue with our JDBC JNDI pool used for communicating with the Confluence database. I attach a combined log of atlassian-confluence.log, atlassian-synchrony.log and MySQL server log.\r\n [^synchrony-communication-error.log] \r\nThe MySQL server seems to abort a connection after some time because there was no response to data delivered to the synchrony client. I made sure that the MySQL server was running. There was definitely no connection problem to the server as several page where retrieved and open in Confluence.\r\nIs this due to a misconfiguration or a general error in Synchrony?\r\nWhen I retried editing a page another hour later, the problem didn't exist any more. Might be an issue with reusing a database connection which has been idle/closed when not being used for some time.\r\nRegards,\r\nJan-Peter\r\n\r\n\r\n*Solution:*\r\nWe will make the connection pool's parameters of Synchrony configurable via the system properties. Basically, a Confluence administrator can set the following properties:\r\n* synchrony.database.test.connection.on.checkin (default: true)\r\n* synchrony.database.idle.connection.test.period (defualt: 1800 seconds, or 30 minutes)\r\n* synchrony.database.max.idle.time.excess.connections (default: 1800 seconds, or 30 minutes)\r\n* synchrony.database.max.idle.time (default: 10800 seconds, or 3 hours)",

Problem summary \r\nAccording to https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Page+Restrictions, the Request Access feature works by notifying users who are able to grant restriction access to a page, using this logic in order:\r\n{quote}\r\n# The last person to edit the page\r\n# *All* non-admin users that can set permissions on the page (given that an admin user can always set permissions)\r\n# The page creator\r\n# *All* the space administrators\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nStep 4 is failing. No space admins are notified despite space permission settings. What appears to be happening instead is that a single Confluence superuser (i.e. a member of the \"confluence-administrators\" group) will be notified. If there are more than one user in this group, the first username on this list, sorted alphabetically, will be sent the request access notification. This user does not need to be in a space administrator for the relevant content. In fact, it doesn't matter who is a space admin on that space, as that configuration does not appear to affect the behavior.\r\n\r\nh2. Steps to reproduce\r\n# Set up a Confluence\r\n# Create 5 users:\r\n** UserA\r\n** UserB\r\n** UserC\r\n** SuperX - place this user in confluence-administrators group (superuser)\r\n** SuperY - place this user in confluence-administrators group (superuser)\r\n# Create a space with UserA, so that this user is automatically a space admin\r\n# Create a page with UserB within this space\r\n# Using SuperX, restrict the page so that only SuperX can view it\r\n# Using UserC, try to view the page by going to the page URL directly. The user cannot see it, and will be asked to request access. Click through.\r\n\r\nh2. Expected behavior\r\nUserA receives the notification, because although he is not the page creator or the last person to edit the page, he is a full space admin and can set page restrictions.\r\n\r\nh2. Actual behavior\r\nSuperX receives the notification, because he is the first superuser alphabetically.\r\n\r\nNow rename SuperX to SuperZ, and repeat step 6. Observe that now SuperY is the one who receives the notification, since that is the first superuser alphabetically.\r\n\r\nh2. Additional notes\r\nThere are actually two parts this is issue:\r\n* Space admins are being ignored in the Request Access logic\r\n* Only one admin is notified, not all, as detailed in the documentation",

Problem Definition\r\n\r\nIt would be useful for some customers to have the ability to force Confluence to show only absolute dates, instead of relative ones. The main reason is to avoid the inherited confusion that relative dates can cause, particularly in scenarios where people work from different time zones.\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nJIRA currently have this option as documented on the following page:\r\n\r\n* [Disable relative dates in JIRA applications|https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirakb/disable-relative-dates-in-jira-applications-414187622.html]\r\n\r\nThe solution could be similar to the one available on JIRA.\r\n\r\nh3.

      "description": "h3. Summary\r\nConfluence Application Status Servlet return HTTP 200 when the node is in cluster panic mode and the header {{Accept-Language}} is missing. Hazelcast at this point is not active for this node, and having an http status check on a load balancer will cause this check to fail and still consider the node to be active while it is not.\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Environment\r\nConfluence Data Center with Load Balancer (this was tested with HAProxy)\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Configure Confluence Data Center with more than 1 node\r\n# Configure HAProxy with\r\n{code:java}\r\noption httpchk GET /confluence/status\r\nhttp-check expect status 200\r\n{code}\r\n# Try to trigger a panic mode for one of the nodes\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nTwo options:\r\n# The ApplicationStatusServlet will return an HTTP 500 error and HAProxy will stop redirecting requests to the node in Panic\r\n# The ApplicationStatusServlet will return an HTTP 200 OK with the status page reflecting the status STOPPED of the node\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nHAProxy is still redirecting requests to that node because it received an HTTP 200. On the other hand, accessing the status page from the browser does indeed return an empty page with a 500 HTTP response code\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is an example of a call initiated from CURL:\r\n{code:borderStyle=solid}\r\ncurl -i -X GET <base-url>/status\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nResponse:\r\n{code:borderStyle=solid}\r\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\nServer: Apache-Coyote/1.1\r\nX-ASEN: SEN-L123456\r\nX-Confluence-Cluster-Node: d1111f1\r\nContent-Type: application/json;charset=ISO-8859-1\r\nContent-Length: 19\r\nDate: Fri, 04 Nov 2016 11:12:02 GMT\r\n{code}\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, simulating the call from the browser, the following header is specifically added to the request\r\n{code:borderStyle=solid}\r\ncurl -i -X GET -H 'Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.8' <base-url>/status\r\n{code}\r\n\r\n\r\nResponse: \r\n{code:borderStyle=solid}\r\nHTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error\r\nServer: Apache-Coyote/1.1\r\nSet-Cookie: JSESSIONID=319B13A07E775E53BBAD5E72445B2308; Path=/; HttpOnly\r\nContent-Type: text/html\r\nContent-Length: 0\r\nDate: Fri, 04 Nov 2016 11:10:14 GMT\r\nConnection: close\r\n{code}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe

We used the \"align\" macro from the Adaptavist Content Formatting plugin, but, in the latest version (4.4.3) they have removed the wiki markup functionality from their macros since wiki markup is being depreciated in Confluence. Since this has been done, we can no longer align the text since the space footer requires us to use Wiki markup. \r\n\r\nSo this request is that you provide a solution that we can use another coding format that will be recognized by Confluence and the macros OR have the ability to insert macros into the footer.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nLisa",

Problem\r\n\r\nWe are not able to insert thumbnails for the attachments in the attachments screen of a page, it would make much easier to identify images if you have a big number of attachments.\r\nh3.

When a TOC macro is added to a page, it will always display with the default Confluence font and size.\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\nAdd functionality to make this configurable, or toggle whether the macro inherits styling or not.\r\n\r\nThis macro used to inherit styles and headings of the rest of the content in Confluence, and some customers were used to this behavior. It would be useful to have a configuration option for this: https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONF-32959?focusedCommentId=579537&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#comment-579537\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround \r\nAt this point, the only way to change this would be through custom CSS as explained here: [Font Style and Color in Confluence Table of Content Macro - Atlassian Answers|https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/188860/font-style-and-color-in-confluence-table-of-content-macro]",

If you use the \"tags\" expansion, the script is not downloaded when adding this content to the DOM (unlike CSS). However, if I create script tags manually, then the scripts are downloading and executed in the order that they finish downloading (which causes javascript errors). It would be great to see documentation for a recommended approach to render content from the content API on the client-side.",

Problem Definition\r\nCustomer reported that, in Confluence pages, links are distinguished by color only. \r\n\r\nConfluence Cloud version does not allow CSS Customization. You are able to change links color (look and feel configuration settings), however, it changes All links within Confluence application, this is only regarding the ones on pages text. \r\n\r\nThere is also a best practice, for accessibility, from w3 on how to display links described here: [https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/F73.html]\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\nIt would be better if we add something like underlining or shading, into the style that links are displayed, even better if we make an option to change default link styles (for pages only)\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround \r\nThe only suitable workaround for this would be to manually format links in a way that differs it from the text.\r\n\r\n",

It is very important as I explained. When you remove it, users start to download documents and then they start also to break formulas that cross documents.\r\n3) Optionally, you can leave the prompt if the user has not even read access, this will alert him something is wrong.",
