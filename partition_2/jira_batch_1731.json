This is 2 redirects just by accessing the base URL.\r\n\r\nGoogle in some cases drops out such sites from search indexing, since they have too many redirects and this is very problematic in the case when Confluence is used as public facing Wiki and the homepage itself would be the entry link from where Google would proceed crawling through the links.\r\n\r\nThe solution would be to eliminate any redirects when accessing the site without login.\r\n",

It means that every page with lots of subpages is very cluttered and the comment section of that page is virtually unusable, since you'd first have to scroll for half a year before getting down there.\r\n\r\nIt seems odd that in a wiki where I can create templates and adjust the look and feel there is one element to each and every page I create that I can not influence at all. Please add a UI setting to disable Child Pages display for all pages (or a setting for each page with a global default setting).\r\n\r\nThanks",

Why the redundant page name? \r\nThis means the anchor will change the name with the page. If I use a link like the above it's not a big inconvenience , but all short links will be invalid, and also links of type 'viewpage.action?pageId=12313#pagename-prices' will become invalid if the 'pagename' is changed to lets say 'changedname'. Now the links would be 'viewpage.action?pageId=12313#changedname-prices' also short links will change like '/xTxY/WszA#changedname-prices'. If the anchor was not prefixed all those links would still be valid. I am also talking about the heading anchors that are generated automatically. \r\n\r\nCan this be made configurable, so that we can choose if Confluence should add prefix to the anchor name or no prefix at all?",

These are used in the generation of thumbnails, for example by the gallery macro. These files are being held open by Confluence, and eventually Confluence's process runs out of available file handles, and produces \"Too many open files\" errors in the log.\r\n\r\nh4. Cause\r\n\r\nThe imageio objects are not being finalised correctly, holding both the file handle and the object open. This results in a file handle leak, but also in a memory/object leak.\r\n\r\nh4. Solution\r\n\r\nThis issue does not occur in any version later than 3.5.x",

They would have to get into the complexity of {{setMacroJsOverride}}.\r\n\r\nBut not all plugin developers live in the macro browser. Sometimes they write forms on pages too. For example, a plugin that asks people to enter comma-separated usernames. Adding a class to the field would greatly improve the UX.\r\n\r\nWe currently don't have any public documentation on the Confluence.Binder components, and for that reason we didn't document the new \"Multi-user selection fields\" feature either.",

And in case that it does break users have a title and the name Wiki to go and search.\r\n\r\nMy request would be to have this as a complete formatted string available in the \"Link to this page\" popup that you get when pressing the \"k\" in view mode. Possibly by making the mask configurable per space.\r\n\r\nA plugin or macro that would give me the same effect would be good too. But I prefer it to be in the standard product.
