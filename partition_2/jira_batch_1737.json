Background of Request\r\n\r\nAs of now, Confluence send out an e-mail of recommended updates according to the popularity of the content(s). This feature will search the whole Confluence instance and pick the most popular content based on votes and comments. Since this feature include the whole Confluence instance, there is a big possibility that Confluence missed important updates from spaces they have included as their favorite space(s). \r\n\r\nBy having recommended updates for each user favorite space(s), Confluence user will get a more specific updates from their preferred content genre such as IT Department Space or Accounting Department Space.\r\n\r\nh4. Proposed Implementation\r\n\r\nI proposed, recommended updates per favorite space which can be configured, for example:\r\n\r\n* Space A -- Recommended Updates -- Send out in Monday\r\n* Space B -- Recommended Updates -- Send out in Wednesday\r\n\r\nFor example, a Confluence content regarding an event discussion such as dinner get more votes and comment compared with a procedure updates from talent department.",

To find the page, the user needs to search for the full expression \"MyClass.Method\".\r\n\r\nThis happens because confluence (like other search engines like google) only searches for whole words, not substrings of words. Most search engines (like google) consider the period character \".\" to define a break in search tokens so that from an indexing perspective \"appserver28nyc.dbpool.servers.domain.com\" would be considered as 5 seperate tokens appserver28nyc, dbpool, servers, domain, and com. Confluence does not.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Using wildcards could be a workaround+ only when searching for the first item in a dot-separated string: \"MyClass.MyMethod()\" can be found by querying _MyClass*_, but _*MyMethod()\" won't work (as per CONF-9158).

      "description": "I have had a stupendously shitty experience trying to import OnDemand data into local JIRA and Confluences. In this bug report I've documented the problems, what I think OnDemand developers could do to fix them *in bold*, and how I worked around them.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe problem is that after importing a Confluence Could export into Confluence (5.0.2), you'll find all jiraissues macros broken (note: I had previously migrated JIRA data to its new home):\r\n\r\n!al0.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nand a cryptic error in the logs:\r\n{noformat}java.lang.NullPointerException: currentApplication\r\n\tat com.google.common.base.Preconditions.checkNotNull(Preconditions.java:204)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.applinks.core.auth.trusted.TrustedApplicationsRequestFactory.<init>(TrustedApplicationsRequestFactory.java:31)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.applinks.core.auth.trusted.TrustedAppsAuthenticationProviderPluginModule$1.getRequestFactory(TrustedAppsAuthenticationProviderPluginModule.java:80)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.applinks.core.auth.ApplicationLinkRequestFactoryFactoryImpl.getApplicationLinkRequestFactory(ApplicationLinkRequestFactoryFactoryImpl.java:53)\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nWith a bit of thinking one might figure out the error: the applinks are all broken, as is to be expected with the change of host.\r\n\r\nh4. Suggested fix 1: improve the jiraissues error message when applinks have problems\r\n\r\nSo off we go to the applinks page:\r\n\r\n!al1.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nApplinks are not editable, because they are marked 'system'.\r\n\r\nh4. Suggested fix 2: The Confluence Cloud exporter should remove the 'system' flag from the applink, so mortals can edit them\r\n\r\nThe 'system' flag can be removed manually in the database:\r\n\r\n{code:sql}\r\nmysql> select BANDANAKEY,BANDANAVALUE from BANDANA WHERE bandanakey like 'applinks.%.system';\r\n+------------------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------+\r\n| BANDANAKEY                                                       | BANDANAVALUE          |\r\n+------------------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------+\r\n| applinks.admin.30e7e368-6e59-357d-b986-d3374f95a205.system       | <string>true</string> |\r\n| applinks.application.30e7e368-6e59-357d-b986-d3374f95a205.system | <string>true</string> |\r\n+------------------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------+\r\n2 rows in set (0.00 sec)\r\nmysql> delete from BANDANA WHERE bandanakey like 'applinks.%.system';Query OK, 2 rows affected (0.01 sec)\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nNow I can edit the applink:\r\n\r\n!al2.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nAnd then my problems _really_ began.\r\n\r\nFor a start, the applink URL isn't editable:\r\n\r\n!al3.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\n(Questionable design decision here: sure, changing the URL to a different JIRA would break everything, but most times it's the _same JIRA_, just under a different URL.)\r\n\r\nSo anyway, let's edit the URL in the database, first by finding the applink ID, finding the applink's properties, then changing the URLs:\r\n\r\n\r\n{code:sql}\r\nmysql> SELECT BANDANAVALUE FROM BANDANA WHERE BANDANAKEY = 'applinks.global.application.ids';\r\n+------------------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n| BANDANAVALUE                                                           |\r\n+------------------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n| <list>\r\n  <string>30e7e368-6e59-357d-b986-d3374f95a205</string>\r\n</list> |\r\n+------------------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n1 row in set (0.00 sec)\r\nmysql> update BANDANA set BANDANAVALUE=replace(BANDANAVALUE, 'somecompany.atlassian.net', 'jira.somecompany.com') where BANDANAKEY like '%30e7e368-6e59-357d-b986-d3374f95a205%.url';\r\nQuery OK, 2 rows affected (0.01 sec)\r\nRows matched: 2  Changed: 2  Warnings: 0\r\n{code}\r\n\r\n(and whatever you do, don't change the applink's title--even though it contains an incorrect URL too--the title is embedded in hundreds of Confluence page jiraissues macros. That is a job for bulk-rewriting.)\r\n\r\nAfter a Confluence restart, the applink appears with the correct link.\r\n\r\n!al4.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nSwitching to the 'Outgoing Authentication' tab, it claims to be in Status: Configured. Just to be sure let's disable and re-enable it. Clicking 'Disable' is easy enough, but then:\r\n\r\n!al5.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nWhere is the 'Enable' link??\r\n\r\nThis is a UI bug (affects Firefox 16.0.1, Chrome 26.0.1410.63) - the link is actually there, and can be seen by clicking on the last form element (the timeout field) and pressing tab:\r\n\r\n!al6.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nh4. Suggested fix #3: Atlassian should use a sane, modern JS library that sizes popups appropriately\r\n\r\nSo we click 'Enable', and:\r\n\r\n!al7.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\n{noformat}java.lang.NullPointerException\r\n\tat com.atlassian.security.auth.trustedapps.filter.TrustedApplicationsFilter$CertificateServerImpl.writeCertificate(TrustedApplicationsFilter.java:201)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.security.auth.trustedapps.filter.TrustedApplicationsFilter.doFilter(TrustedApplicationsFilter.java:90)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.confluence.util.AbstractBootstrapHotSwappingFilter.doFilter(AbstractBootstrapHotSwappingFilter.java:30)\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\n\"But hang on\", I hear you say, \"why are you trying to fix this obviously borked applink? Just delete it and start again\". No such luck:\r\n\r\n!al8.png|thumbnail!\r\n(and, in case you were wondering, it breaks the same way if you don't change the URLs in the database as I did)\r\n\r\n\"Okay, what about that 'Upgrade application link' button?\" It dies with the JS equivalent of a NullPointerException:\r\n\r\n!al9.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nSo we're left with an applink we can't fix and can't delete.\r\n\r\nFortunately, Googling the exception brings up [this KB article|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/CONFKB/Cannot+Add+JIRA+as+a+Trusted+Application+Due+to+Multiple+Trusted+Applications], which points to the cause: the #@#%! Confluence Cloud exporter has erased all the {{KEYSTORE}} records, which trustedapps depends on:\r\n\r\n{code:sql}\r\nmysql> select * from KEYSTORE;\r\nEmpty set (0.00 sec)\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nThe KB article points to [CONF-11074|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONF-11074], which helpfully includes a JSP to recreate the KEYSTORE.\r\n\r\nSo I run the JSP, which populates my KEYSTORE table with a public/private keypair, and now - hurrah - I can enable Outgoing Authentication. After a restart, the jiraissues macros that rely on the applink work too.\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested fix #4: if you have to wipe the KEYSTORE table, replace its values with something else!\r\nDon't just leave them blank when doing so results in a broken, undeletable, unfixable applink. Create a new unique keypair using the code from the CONF-11074 JSP and put the keys in KEYSTORE.\r\n\r\nThank you for reading.",

In the end, the customer would be rejected due to wrong password or missing due to being point to a different domain.\r\n\r\nSome solution should be implemented to avoid different user with same username are having conflict on login into Confluence.\r\n\r\nCurrent Workaround:\r\n* Use a different attribute for username such as email during the setup of second directory in Confluence.

And in some cases, folks will put links to these attachments on wiki pages.\r\n\r\nHowever, when browsing, it's cumbersome to have to download the files to view them (depending on the browser you are using and whether or not it has a preview option for that type of document).\r\n\r\nBut since Confluence is rendering the link anyway, perhaps it could make the default target of the link be the viewfile viewer (which has a download link in the bottom left).  Alternately, clicking a link to an attachment could have a popup similar to in the editor, where it gives you the option to either download the file or navigate to the viewfile viewer for it.\r\n\r\nThis could potentially be something at the global and/or space default level to enable this mode or not, since some installations/spaces might prefer to have direct links.  Or it could even be an option on the link itself (default action on click = preview/download).\r\n\r\n(My apologies if this is a duplicate, I tried searching and didn't find anything that exactly met what I was hoping for).",

A sort-of fix: You\r\ncan do a \"find\" (in the browser; not in the editor) to grab certain buttons\r\non the page (for example searching for \"Save\" allows you to see and click\r\nthat button at the bottom of the editor), but then the top is cut off still\r\nwithout the ability to scroll to it.\r\n\r\n2. The text won't wrap. When putting text into a column and setting the\r\ncolumn width it seemed as though the column width was disregarded so the\r\ntext would all fit and wouldn't wrap.\r\nhttps://wiki.getjive.com/display/CS/Failover+Extension+For+Line+Dial+Plan is\r\nan example.
