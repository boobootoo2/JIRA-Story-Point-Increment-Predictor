In the JIRA issue, I was seeing the *Page Failed to load* under the *Issue Links* opposite the *mentioned in* option. That's the same way the customer is seeing it.\r\n\r\n*Second Approach*\r\n # I created a JIRA issue in another dev instance ([https://stan.jira-dev.com/browse/BUR-5]) and mentioned in and Confluence page ([https://stan.jira-dev.com/wiki/display/ds/M%2Cz%3E%2Cxz%3Exz]) and the display was fine from both side.\r\n # I exported JIRA and Confluence from [https://stan.jira-dev.com|https://stan.jira-dev.com/] and imported it into: [https://adiallo.jira-dev.com|https://adiallo.jira-dev.com/].\r\n # After a successful import and reindex, the same error appear in the JIRA Issue ([https://adiallo.jira-dev.com/browse/BUR-5):] *Page Failed to load* and from Confluence side it throws: *JIRA Issues Macro: Unable to locate JIRA server for this macro.

Actual Behavior\r\nThe values to the Issue ID field during a CSV import are saved to an \"External Issue ID\" field. When performing new imports, they will usually not work properly because it's rather difficult to find unique ID values. We should have two different options upon import: \"Issue ID\"  - a value that will only be used within that import process to link issues; and \"External Issue ID\" for when users want to map the ID that came from the source system.\r\n\r\nh3.

[See the corresponding bug report|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-59868].\n  {panel}\n\nh3. Summary\nDuring a JIRA import, if the export is from a JIRA that has a pending upgrade task in the database, this entry is migrated and causes the JIRA Upgrade task (after the import) to fail and permanently Lock JIRA.\n\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\nUpgrade Tasks may appear as \"Pending\" in the *upgradehistory* db table if the DelayedUpgradeJobRunner introduced in JIRA 6.4 delayed the task.\n# Export a JIRA that has a \"Pending\" task in the *upgradehistory* table.\n# Import to latest JIRA\n\nh3. Expected Results\nJIRA imports and runs upgrade tasks\n\nh3. Actual Results\n*Update: 7/7/2016* - JIRA will allow the export, but will raise a validation error before beginning to import the backup file. This should allow the workaround to be applied directly and the import restarted.\n\nUnder the previous behaviour JIRA imports data but fails to run upgrade tasks with the following error in the logs:\n{noformat}\n2016-02-18 11:55:59.008981500 2016-02-18 11:55:59,008 JiraImportTaskExecutionThread-1 ERROR sysadmin 712x574x1 2fzgw2 103.233.242.8,165.254.227.130,127.0.0.1 /secure/admin/StudioImport!import.jspa [c.a.jira.upgrade.ConsistencyCheckImpl] Could not find Mail Queue Service, adding.\n2016-02-18 11:55:59.026175500 2016-02-18 11:55:59,026 JiraImportTaskExecutionThread-1 INFO sysadmin 712x574x1 2fzgw2 103.233.242.8,165.254.227.130,127.0.0.1 /secure/admin/StudioImport!import.jspa [c.a.jira.upgrade.ConsistencyCheckImpl] The Server ID for this JIRA instance is: [BJEV-O0EK-BZH3-N1YN]\n2016-02-18 11:55:59.026836500 2016-02-18 11:55:59,026 JiraImportTaskExecutionThread-1 INFO sysadmin 712x574x1 2fzgw2 103.233.242.8,165.254.227.130,127.0.0.1 /secure/admin/StudioImport!import.jspa [c.a.j.bc.dataimport.DefaultDataImportService] Importing data is 92% complete...\n2016-02-18 11:55:59.265240500 2016-02-18 11:55:59,265 JiraImportTaskExecutionThread-1 INFO sysadmin 712x574x1 2fzgw2 103.233.242.8,165.254.227.130,127.0.0.1 /secure/admin/StudioImport!import.jspa [c.a.jira.upgrade.UpgradeManagerImpl] Detected that an upgrade is needed; existing data at build 64015\n2016-02-18 11:55:59.265681500 2016-02-18 11:55:59,265 JiraImportTaskExecutionThread-1 INFO sysadmin 712x574x1 2fzgw2 103.233.242.8,165.254.227.130,127.0.0.1 /secure/admin/StudioImport!import.jspa [c.a.jira.upgrade.UpgradeManagerImpl] ___ Performing Upgrade ____________________\n2016-02-18 11:55:59.368595500 2016-02-18 11:55:59,368 JiraImportTaskExecutionThread-1 INFO sysadmin 712x574x1 2fzgw2 103.233.242.8,165.254.227.130,127.0.0.1 /secure/admin/StudioImport!import.jspa [c.a.jira.upgrade.UpgradeManagerImpl] Performing Upgrade Task: Drops the entityproperty_identity index in entity_property table\n2016-02-18 11:55:59.376612500 2016-02-18 11:55:59,374 JiraImportTaskExecutionThread-1 ERROR sysadmin 712x574x1 2fzgw2 103.233.242.8,165.254.227.130,127.0.0.1 /secure/admin/StudioImport!import.jspa [c.a.jira.upgrade.UpgradeManagerImpl] Problem adding upgrade task Drops the entityproperty_identity index in entity_property table to the upgrade history\n2016-02-18 11:55:59.376614500 com.atlassian.jira.exception.DataAccessException: org.ofbiz.core.entity.GenericEntityException: while inserting: [GenericEntity:UpgradeHistory][targetbuild,64016][upgradeclass,com.atlassian.jira.upgrade.tasks.UpgradeTask_Build64016][downgradetaskrequired,Y][id,10700][status,complete] (SQL Exception while executing the following:INSERT INTO public.upgradehistory (ID, UPGRADECLASS, TARGETBUILD, STATUS, DOWNGRADETASKREQUIRED) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?)
