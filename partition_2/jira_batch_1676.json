The SSLv3 communication problem in java & confluence is actually caused by java changing its 'client_version' in the TLS handshake. This can be fixed by setting the ' com.sun.net.ssl.rsaPreMasterSecretFix' system property to 'true' or by enabling TLSv1.1 or higher (in java 7+). See https://ecosystem.atlassian.net/browse/SAL-280 & https://ecosystem.atlassian.net/browse/SAL-299.\r\n\r\nI suggest that this issue be fixed by updating SAL and using the httpclient SAL provides instead of creating a new instance. Note: because of [SAL-300|https://ecosystem.atlassian.net/browse/SAL-300] if confluence wants to support SSLv3 then it will need to set the {{https.protocols}} system property to one that contains SSLv3. We suggest not enabling SSLv3 as it is an old and insecure protocol.",

Most of our users do not understand the structure of permissions and spaces and have accidentally added a blogpost to another user's personal space because those permissions are default.\r\n\r\n{panel:title=Atlassian update: Advanced permissions management released in Confluence Data Center 7.3|borderStyle=solid|borderColor=#6554c0|titleBGColor=#6554c0|bgColor=#eae6ff|titleColor=#ffffff}\r\n\r\nHi everyone\r\n\r\nThanks for your comments and feedback on this issue. In [Confluence Data Center 7.3|https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/confluence-7-3-release-notes-983794557.html], we released a set of features relating to advanced permissions management for easier administration that may help with the use cases raised here. We understand that once your site reaches a certain size, permissions management can be a challenge. We now provide the tools you need to manage, troubleshoot, and audit permissions.\u00a0\r\n\r\nAlthough, setting a default permission scheme for personal spaces is not resolved, these new features may make it easier to diagnose issues and fix them. In the interests of being open, we have decided to close this issue as we won\u2019t be addressing it in a more comprehensive way in the foreseeable future.\r\n\r\nHead to\u00a0[Inspect permissions|https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/inspect-permissions-992678939.html]\u00a0to learn more, or check out our new\u00a0[Permissions best practices guide|https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/permissions-best-practices-992678945.html].\u00a0\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nMakisa | Senior Product Manager, Confluence Server and Data Center\r\n\r\n{panel}",

In the first pass, the page has just been loaded and the Excel file is launched normally.\r\n\r\nIn the second half of the video, after viewing a preview, clicking the Edit in Office button launches the file...but two copies appear, which can be really confusing for the user.\r\n\r\nThe problem seems to stem from the fact that the Office Connector is binding the \"onclick\" event for \"Edit in Office\" twice: once in com.atlassian.confluence.extra.officeconnector:editinoffice, and a second time in com.atlassian.confluence.extra.officeconnector:file-viewer-plugin.\r\n\r\nThe latter binding appears to have been designed to target the edit-in-office link in the \"...\" dropdown menu within the file browser itself, but the jQuery selector for \"office-editable\" class is DOM-wide and not scoped to the file browser, so it ends up attaching the onclick handler to all elements on the page, including those in the Attachments macro that already have their own onclick handler already set up:\r\n\r\n{code:java}\r\n/* module-key = 'com.atlassian.confluence.extra.officeconnector:file-viewer-plugin', location = 'templates/extra/editinword/editInOffice.js' */\r\nAJS.toInit(function ($) {\r\n    var contextPath = AJS.Data.get('context-path');\r\n\r\n    var editInOfficeLinks = $('#edit-in-word, #edit-in-word-pathauth, a.office-editable, a.office-editable-pathauth');\r\n    editInOfficeLinks.click(function (e) {\r\n        [...]\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nNote that this bug also causes problems with third-party plugins that have a <dependency> on the Office Connector's file-viewer-plugin component, since the dependency can also cause this behavior to appear every time the page is loaded, without even needing to access the file previewer.\r\n\r\nh4.Workaround\r\n\r\nThe following workaround should resolve the problem until the issue is able to be formally fixed in an upcoming version of the product.\r\n# Navigate to Confluence Admin > Manage Add-Ons > System (in the dropdown)\r\n# Locate the Office Connector plugin and expand it\r\n# Expand the modules, locate the module labeled \"file-viewer-plugin\" and disable it.\r\n# Try the Edit in Office functionality again and let us know how it goes\r\n",

Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n# Upload Office file which contains Japanese characters to a page in Confluence. \r\n# Click on the document (See attached capture.jpg)\r\n\r\nh4. Actual results\r\nJapanese characters are displayed as squares.\r\n\r\nh4. Findings \r\nThe problem could be solved by the following knowledge base if it were Confluence Server (not Confluence Cloud).\r\n- [Non-ASCII Characters display as Square Characters in Confluence|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/CONFKB/Non-ASCII+Characters+display+as+Square+Characters+in+Confluence]\r\n\r\nThe knowledge base article tells the problem could be solved by installing proper font files to both OS and JVM. It seems the OS of Confluence Cloud already has proper font files installed, however, JVM is not. Users cannot install font files to JVM because the instance is Confluence Cloud (not Confluence Server).\r\n\r\nh4. Workaround\r\n- Use Office macro instead (See attached capture.jpg)\r\n\r\nh4. Notes\r\n- [CONF-36557|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONF-36557] is similar problem but it is different. The cause of this problem is that font files cannot be installed to JVM of Confluence Cloud, while the cause of [CONF-36557|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONF-36557] is that the solution of the knowledge base does not work only when using Excel spreadsheet even after installing font files to JVM of Confluence Server.",

This causes text to appear in a different location when compared to say a background template image and can cause text to wrap onto multiple lines, when it originally displays within the same line.  The text wrapping contributes to the phenomenon where lines of text are cut off and not displayed when the presentation is embedded in the page.\r\n\r\nNote: I spot checked a handful of font faces (including the default theme fonts) and sizes  varying from 12 to 32 and the font size was enlarged regardless of my selection.\r\n\r\n3) Dimensions\r\nUnless you either a) set the powerpoint page setup to use a custom width of 10 inches and a height of 8 inches or b) explicitly set the macro properties for height and width accordingly, the embedded image will be resized with different ratio dimensions, resulting in grey matting above, below, to the left, and or to the right of your presentation.  This may also exacerbate the cropping issue where partial text appears on the screen.\r\n\r\nNote: Why hard code the macro to change the default ratio of the presentation versus preserving the ratio?  If a default ratio must be set and not at 100% by 100%, then consider the fact that Microsoft defaults the on screen ratio of 4:3 to 10 by 7.5 inches.\r\n\r\n4) Fullscreen Cropping\r\nSwitching to the fullscreen mode crops additional portions of the text that would otherwise appear.\r\n\r\nSee attached for an example powerpoint and resulting screenshots that exhibits these issues.\r\n\r\nNote: The second issue is similar to https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONF-28606, but I wasn't sure if we were reporting the same issue or even talking about the same macro.",

Can you at least indicate that this page has child pages that are being hidden? As an OnDemand (and therefore not a true) administrator, it's quite confusing to find that there's a page you can't see or find in any way.\r\n\r\nMy Use Case:\r\nI was trying to copy a page into a space, but the first attempt appeared to time out. After copying, I got an error message saying that there was already a page with that name in the space, but direct browsing, searching, and looking in 'Restricted Pages' resulted in nothing. I ended up needing to enter a support request as I thought the timed out copy attempt had created a ghost page I couldn't access. In the end, it turned out that another manager had created a page with the name I was trying to use, however as it was a child page I had no way of knowing where this page was or even that it was an actual page.",

I know that SailPoint did this when we had many hundreds of clients running Oracle who added indexes for performance reasons through the Statistics and Query Analyser tools that improved performance in our application.  This made the upgrade tasks run smoothly to finish without upsetting the clients who had already added indexes by halting their upgrade tasks.\r\n\r\nI would like to have this issue revisited as our largest clients are running Oracle backends and will see this issue in their environments. If we checked for the existence of an index on the table and column that we are about to index and then did not do so if it already exists, then the upgrade experience would be smoother overall.",

Other pages work fine.\r\n\r\nDuring our tests, we\u2019ve moved manually the child pages though Browse Reorder. Almost all of them were moved except one that has 2 child pages under it with several child pages under each of the child pages.\r\nThis bug may be related to [this fixed bug|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONF-31879]. However, it was fixed on version 5.4.x and we are getting the same behaviour on version 5.6.6\r\n\r\n*Workaround*\r\nThe steps below are the same from [this bug|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONF-31879] that was affecting version 5.4.x.\r\n\r\n# Stop Confluence\r\n# Backup Confluence database and Home Directory.\r\n# Run the following SQL query to copy the PAGEID values into the CONTENTID column\r\n{code}\r\nUPDATE NOTIFICATIONS SET CONTENTID = PAGEID WHERE PAGEID IS NOT NULL;\r\n{code}\r\n# Run the following query to drop the PAGEID Foreign Key constraint (double check the actual key name in the NOTIFICATIONS table)\r\n{code}\r\nALTER TABLE NOTIFICATIONS DROP FK594ACC88C38FBEA;\r\n{code}\r\n# Run query to drop the index on the PAGEID column\r\n{code}\r\ndrop index NOTIFICATIONS.n_pageid_idx;\r\n{code}\r\n# Run this query to drop the actual PAGEID column\r\n{code}\r\nALTER TABLE NOTIFICATIONS DROP COLUMN PAGEID;\r\n{code}\r\n# Start Confluence\r\n# You should now be able to purge the trash, able to successfully delete any space and the page watchers are listed in Watch > Manage Watchers",
