In the first top level, the documents are all older than one year, so the top level is red.

I feel like I can scan down a page and get a vibe from the page comments too, which I'm now missing with inline comments.\r\n\r\nFor me, I feel like it's taken away some of the inclusive and easy nature of collaboration that Confluence is amazing for.\r\n\r\nIdeas:\r\n# Have a way as the author to change an inline comment into a page comment, and start it with the highlighted text in a quote. That way if something becomes a vital discussion it can be moved to a place it will be more visible to casual page viewers\r\n# Have a 'view all' button that does the above for all inline comments for the current viewer only\r\n# Have a user setting that does the above for all pages by default (ie disable inline comments per user)\r\n# Display a count of comments in the top right of the highlighted text so it's easy to see where the discussion is",

Modification logs claimed it is not clear enough*\r\n* From his description, the logs statement is not being very clear. For example, the log says MySQL jdbc driver is not added into the file and requires to be applied manually, but in fact the previous jdbc driver file still exist.\r\n** there should have an additional checking if the jdbc driver already exist in the folder.\r\n\r\n*2. Installer should also check for {{conf/}} and {{/bin}} modifications, since we will have several modifications*\r\n* setenv.sh, setenv.bat, server.xml, web.xml and others\r\n\r\n*3.The wizard compares and copies modification files to another folder*\r\n* compared file with differences will by copied into a new folder. Example:\r\n** {{changes/conf/server.xml-modifications}}\r\n** {{changes/bin/setenv.sh-modifications}}\r\n\r\n*4. The wizard prompts to replace modified files to installation directory*\r\n* After step 3, installer prompts if user wants to copy the modified files into installation directory or not (one by one)\r\n** it's like copying \"test.txt\" into another folder with \"test.txt\" file exist in Windows, it will then prompt if you want to replace or not.\r\n!http://i.stack.imgur.com/Iz7Dr.png!\r\n\r\nIt sounds tedious and I am sure there are several factors we need to take into consideration, but if done correctly, it may save Confluence administrators other amount of time to re-customize Confluence and configuration settings.",

When I click the macro to create a decision from the decision template, I get no visible response. I do however see that I'm getting an HTTP 400 response from the AJAX call that it's trying to make. My response is as follows:\r\n\r\n{code}\r\n{\"errorCode\":400,\"errorType\":\"NOT_FOUND:SPACE\",\"errorData\":\"10536\",\"errorMessage\":\"No space found for spaceKey '10536'\"}\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nWhen I start editing the macro which is supposed to create a template I notice that it does not specify a space key, it's left blank, which according to the description right below the parameter field should mean it's using the space that the decision log lives in. What's interesting is that when I try to specify a space key while editing the macro, it will autocomplete for me to \"*0*10536\" not \"10536\". However, even if I save the space key parameter for this macro to be \"010536\" it still gives me the error above. On top of all that, this works just fine for other spaces (i.e. one that has a space key of \"10536WG\"). From my very limited standpoint, it would appear there is a bug with this macro related to numerical space keys that start with a leading zero.\r\n\r\nLet me know if I can provide more detail in any way.
