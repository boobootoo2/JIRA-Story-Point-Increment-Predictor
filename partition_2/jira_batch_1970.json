If CORS is not in place (e.g. you wish to embed an image within an {{<img>}} tag)\r\n\r\nCall either of the following APIs with {{AP.request}}:\r\n{code:java}\r\n/rest/api/content/{attachmentId}\r\n{code}\r\n{code:java}\r\n/rest/api/content/{containerContentId}?expand=children.attachment\r\n{code}\r\nand get the {{_links.download}} path of the corresponding attachment. Since the call is made in the browser, one can use this value to construct a URL to download the attachment.\r\n\r\nFor example,\r\n{code:java}\r\n<img src=<baseURL + downloadURL> />\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nh4. 2. If CORS is in place\r\n\r\nMake a request to this API from the Connect app server, then serve the result to the client.",
