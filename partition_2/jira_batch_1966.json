If a conflict exists, the app that was installed first is the one that is displayed in the macro editor, the other is disabled.\r\n\r\nAn example of this is the Button macro in [Content Formatting for Confluence|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/247/content-formatting-macros-for-confluence?hosting=cloud&tab=overview] and the Button macro in [MacroSuite for Confluence|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1222649/macrosuite-easy-html-button-hide-content-divider-tabs?hosting=cloud&tab=overview].\u00a0\r\n\r\nAs the cloud marketplace matures further, there are likely going to be more clashes between apps (especially for common element names like buttons).This isn't a great experience for our customers.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThis bug was closed previously but we believe should be considered given the current requirements of migrating to Cloud -> \u00a0CONFCLOUD-58419\r\n\r\nAll the best,\r\n\r\nDylan",

Problem Definition\r\n\r\nConfluence Cloud currently does not track or restrict specific terms that an organization might want to avoid, such as curse words or culturally inappropriate language.\r\n\r\nA few examples: \"Whitelist/Blacklist\", \"Master/Slave\", \"Blackout\", \"Man Hours\" etc.\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nImplement a new Feature to better control the usage of specific terms and suggest alternatives:\r\n # Create a list of terms to be watched\r\n # Provide a field for alternative terms to be suggested (Eg.: \"Whitelist\" can be changed to \"Allowlist\" instead)\r\n # Automatically scan new content (create and update) for the listed terms (from Pages, Blog Posts, Questions, Calendar Events etc)\r\n # Add Inline comments on top of the listed terms providing alternatives (Eg.: highlight a new \"Whitelist\" entry and add an Inline comment mentioning \"Please consider using 'Allowlist' instead\")\r\n # Create a Job to scan existing content and search for the listed terms\r\n # Provide a structured report based on the scanned results with metadata (Eg.: term used, number of times it is used, content where the term appears, link to the content, etc.)\r\n # Create a banned terms list and avoid content to be saved if it contains any of those.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\n1. Create reports based on SQL queries to be ran against the Confluence database to find those terms and provide related content metadata, such as:\r\n{code:sql}\r\nselect * from BODYCONTENT \r\nWHERE body LIKE '%Whitelist%';\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nThe results can be joined to the CONTENT table by using the corresponding *contentid*s for better results (Title, Creator, Creation Date etc).\r\n\r\n2.

Issue Summary\r\n\r\nThere is a myriad of macros that can be used in the Confluence Server/DC that are not compatible with the Cloud environment.\r\n\r\nWhen you migrate a space that contains pages with macros that are not compatible with Cloud the macro breaks and start showing a warning box with \"unknown macro\":\r\n\r\nAn example:\r\n\r\n!a7efabfb-dc73-48ae-b686-d1ee0086fb28.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nThe incompatible macros code would be stripped during import, leaving the text part inside the macro intact.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nA warning box is shown saying the macro is unknown.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nYou can remove the macros on the server prior to migrating to the Cloud.",
