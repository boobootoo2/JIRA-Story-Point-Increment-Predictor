Unfortunately, while we could identify them during the migration, we have no place to save that information. We can't save it in our own storage because if the customer clones a workflow, we'll have no way of knowing that the workflow copy also requires changes.\r\nOn the other hand, we can't just go over each workflow and check each JMWE workflow extension while building the page, because the only available REST API for that can only return a few workflows at a time, with pagination, and we're talking about large payloads therefore slow REST calls, and some migrating customers have hundreds of workflows...\r\nWhat we need is a way to \"tag\" workflows that require changes, and have that tag being copied along when cloning a workflow. Having workflow entity properties would work, but they don't currently exist (or at least there's not API for that). And of course we'd need a way to list workflows that have a particular workflow entity property value.\r\n\r\nAnother problem is that this REST API doesn't even allow getting the workflow rules only for one workflow, so even if we had the list of workflows requiring changes, we couldn't quickly get to the JMWE \"rules\" for a particular workflow, which is also a big issue when you have a lot of workflows (the only solution right now is to iterate through each page until we encounter the desired workflow)\r\n\r\n",

Expected Results\r\nMigration goes through.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nIt fails with the error below:\r\n{noformat}\r\n100:Memberships contain groups that are not part of groups being migrated. \r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\nCurrently, JCMA has a bug in its Scoped Users/Groups migration that will cause JCMA to fail if any of the groups to be migrated has JSD/JSM only access.\r\n\r\nTo workaround this, one could leverage the URL below to see which groups will be migrated as part of a project scoped migration:\r\n{code}\r\n<BASE-URL>/rest/migration/latest/debug/export/users-groups?projectKeys=<PKEY>&mode=<REFERENCED>\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nThen with the list of groups, access one by one in Jira and check which ones have JSD/JSM access only. For those, the option is to either remove JSD/JSM access leaving the group without access to any apps or to add a JSW/Core access to the group.\r\n\r\nOnce that's done, re-try the migration and it should go through. :)",

Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Run a Migration Plan through JCMA;\r\n # When reviewing the Migration Checklist, admins running the assistant can receive the before-mentioned message.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\n- The message \"We are currently updating the migration service\" should not appear, or in case the destination cloud site is for some reason unavailable/unreachable, a better/self-explanatory/complete message should be displayed to the customer running the migration plan, such as:\r\n\r\n\"<Destination Cloud Site> is unreachable at this moment. Please try again or contact the Migration Support in case the issue persists.\"\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nCustomers end up getting a really generic message \"We are currently updating the migration service\" that is not very helpful for an initial analysis.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nSome workarounds that were found to be effective:\r\n- Make sure you are using the correct JIRA's base url before migration;\r\n- Please re-migrate the project by re-authenticating to the cloud instance (Jira server Administration > System > Migrate to cloud > Create new migration > Connect to cloud > click \"Choose cloud site\" button > click \"Change Account\" > re-enter the login credentials -> select cloud site);",

Additional Note\r\n\r\nIt seems that when the page reference is updated, Confluence thinks that the custom content is linking to itself, because the page that it is linking to has the same title as the custom content itself.\r\n\r\nThis also happens on Server.\r\nh2. Impact\r\n\r\nThe issue significantly affects our current efforts to provide a migration path for Scroll Versions to Cloud via Scroll Documents.\r\nh2. Background\r\n\r\nDue to the complexity of integration of Scroll Versions with Confluence Server it is not possible to migrate it to cloud as is. Therefore we, at K15t, have decided to use one of our existing Cloud apps - Scroll Documents, to be the cloud alternative for Scroll Versions.\r\n\r\nIn doing so, we have had to make substantial changes to the underlying data model of Scroll Documents. This was necessary in order to be able to support the various functionality that Scroll Versions provides.\r\n\r\nScroll Documents is available on both Confluence Cloud and Server providing 100% feature parity. This is partly made possible by the use of Custom Content Entity Objects to persist information. But in doing so, we have hit a roadblock due to a bug that exists both on Confluence Cloud and on Confluence Server.\r\nh3. Cloud\r\n\r\nOn Cloud we have a\u00a0[custom content module|https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/confluence/modules/custom-content/]\u00a0configured that looks something like this:\r\n{panel}\r\n{panel}\r\n|{{\"modules\"}}{{: {}}\r\n{{\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0}}{{\"customContent\"}}{{: [}}\r\n{{\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0}}{{{}}\r\n{{\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0}}{{\"key\"}}{{:\u00a0}}{{\"document-family\"}}{{,}}\r\n{{\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0}}{{\"name\"}}{{: {\u00a0}}{{\"value\"}}{{:\u00a0}}{{\"Scroll Documents\"}}\u00a0{{},}}\r\n{{\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0}}{{\"uiSupport\"}}{{: {}}\r\n{{\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0}}{{\"contentViewComponent\"}}{{: {\u00a0}}{{\"moduleKey\"}}{{:\u00a0}}{{\"k15t-docs-document-manager\"}}\u00a0{{},}}\r\n{{\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0}}{{\"listViewComponent\"}}{{: {\u00a0}}{{\"moduleKey\"}}{{:\u00a0}}{{\"k15t-docs-documents-overview-page\"}}\u00a0{{},}}\r\n{{\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0}}{{\"icons\"}}{{: {}}\r\n{{\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0}}{{\"item\"}}{{: {\u00a0}}{{\"width\"}}{{:\u00a0}}{{16}}{{,\u00a0}}{{\"height\"}}{{:\u00a0}}{{16}}{{,\u00a0}}{{\"url\"}}{{:\u00a0}}{{\"/static/assets/imgs/documents_icon_item.svg\"}}\u00a0{{},}}\r\n{{\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0}}{{\"list\"}}{{: {\u00a0}}{{\"width\"}}{{:\u00a0}}{{24}}{{,\u00a0}}{{\"height\"}}{{:\u00a0}}{{24}}{{,\u00a0}}{{\"url\"}}{{:\u00a0}}{{\"/static/assets/imgs/documents_icon_sidebar.svg\"}}\u00a0{{}}}\r\n{{\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0}}{{}}}\r\n{{\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0}}{{},}}\r\n{{\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0}}{{\"apiSupport\"}}{{: {}}\r\n{{\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0}}{{\"bodyType\"}}{{:\u00a0}}{{\"storage\"}}{{,}}\r\n{{\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0}}{{\"supportedContainerTypes\"}}{{: [}}{{\"space\"}}{{],}}\r\n{{\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0}}{{\"supportedChildTypes\"}}{{: [}}{{\"attachment\"}}{{]}}\r\n{{\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0}}{{}}}\r\n{{\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0}}{{}}}\r\n{{\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0}}{{]}}\r\n{{\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0}}{{}}}|\r\n\r\nWe are then using the\u00a0[Create Content API|https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/confluence/rest/api-group-content/#api-api-content-post]\u00a0to create such content.\r\nh3.

Problem Definition\r\n\r\nThe new Atlassian App Migration Platform (currently under development) will enable all Atlassian Marketplace Partners apps to build automated migration paths for their apps.\r\nh3. Current Status\r\n\r\nNEW APIs are active and available today! No migration is required. Read below.\r\nh3. Solution\r\nh4. Subject: Zephyr for Jira Cloud 7.1.1 Release - End of Support for ZAPI, Jenkins and Bamboo plugins\r\n\r\nNow you can import test results from test automation frameworks directly into Zephyr with the revamped Test Automation Integration (formerly A.T.O.M.) It is important to update to the latest version to support these changes.\r\nh4. What will change?\r\n\r\nZephyr for Jira is no longer supporting the the ZAPI, Jenkins and Bamboo plugins. The latest release includes built-in REST APIs, scripts for integrating with Jenkins/Bamboo and native BDD/Cucumber support.\r\nh4. What does this mean?\r\n\r\nYour existing integrations need to be transitioned to the new offerings to avoid disruption. Please find more information at the following:\r\n\r\nBamboo: [https://zephyrdocs.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ZFJCLOUD/pages/1997438994/Bamboo+Integration]\u00a0\r\n\r\nJenkins: [https://zephyrdocs.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ZFJCLOUD/pages/1996685380/Jenkins+Integration]\u00a0\r\n\r\nREST API: [https://zephyrdocs.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ZFJCLOUD/pages/1925120024/REST+API]\u00a0\r\n\r\nBDD: [https://zephyrdocs.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ZFJCLOUD/pages/1250558034/Zephyr+BDD+Feature]\r\n\r\nTest Automation: [https://zephyrdocs.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ZFJCLOUD/pages/1234960420/Test+Automation]\u00a0\r\nh4. Why are we ending support for the ZAPI, Jenkins and Bamboo plugins?\r\n\r\nWith this release there is no more dependence on ZAPI for any API's to function, Zephyr currently supports all API's natively without the need to install ZAPI.\r\n\r\nZephyr for Jira integrations with BDD/Cucumber and modern test automations tools unlocks continuous testing throughout the software development lifecycle reducing the feedback loop and costs associated to testing.\r\nh4. What happens if I don't take action?\r\n\r\nIf no action is taken and users continue to keep the ZAPI add-on, there will be no impact/issues, as the dependency of REST API with the add-on has been removed. The REST API's will continue to function as earlier. However, we recommend users to uninstall the ZAPI add-on from the Jira instances, as when the add-on is removed from the Atlassian marketplace, the Jira instance will hit a 404 Not found error. \r\n \r\nFor Jenkins and Bamboo, when the plugins are removed, the configuration options will not be present to publish the results into Zephyr for Jira. Users will have to use the post build scripts provided as part of the Continuous Integration.\r\n\r\nHow can I get more information?\r\n\r\nCheck out the release notes [here|https://zephyrdocs.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ZFJCLOUD/pages/21757974/All+Release+Notes].\r\n\r\n\u00a0",
