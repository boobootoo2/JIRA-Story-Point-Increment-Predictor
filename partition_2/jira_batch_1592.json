(similar to cars, meeting rooms, laptops...except that those resources blindly accept requests, where people to varying degrees (dependent on how empowered they are in their workplace) manage their own commitments and availability.\n- each user has their own personal calendar.\n- calendar items sync across multiple calendar views (events, team, personal...)\n- a team calendar is not about adding things to the current people calendar...but about a user sharing their personal calendar (controls needed about sharing details of events in personal calendar - i.e. I'll share I have a meeting..but not share a sensitive medical appointment...but availability should still be blocked out.) Users are added to the team calendar and availability/calendar items flow across.\n-events (such as a meeting) allow aggregation of multiple users into one item on a team calendar\n\nInitial key here is that every user gets a personal calendar...adn the people calendars become about adding people...not people adding personal events...they add those in their personal calendar and may choose to sync with iCAL or Exchange.\n",

If we could solve one of these problems what would it be? What is the most painful part about organising a roster?\r\nCheers, \r\nTeam Calendars team\r\n\r\nCustomer Feedback from Pieter:\r\n{code}\r\nGood day,\r\n\r\nI would like to use the Team Calendars to automate our standby process. \r\nThe current process involves a Excel spreadsheet macro where the macro automatically fills in the next team member on standby (it iterates through a list of available members). It also flags the standby as a problem if there is a conflicting task such as leave.\r\n\r\nNote:\r\n- There can be different sets of groups consisting of the same people\r\n- You can specify which group of people is active from which period onwards\r\n- The calendar can have different sets of standby's (qa, live, south africa, namibia etc) which can use a group of people.\r\n\r\nPlease do ask me if you have any questions. I've attached an example which might assist.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n  Pieter\r\n{code}",

But they would be awesome if they provided what is now expected functionality for any calendar system - Reminder Notifications!\r\n\r\nUnless reminder notifications are implemented, it will be up to individuals to continually review their multiple calendars in Confluence to know when events are happening.  This is not practical and for many would ultimately mean that it is not practical to put important information into Team Calendars, especailly those events which you MUST recieve a reminder about so you don't forget them.\r\n\r\nThe implementation options for this are various, but I don't think anything fancy is required.  Maybe each event can have a specific reminder option where people and a time can be assigned and an email is sent to those people when that event time period occurs.  To improve upon this, an entire calendar reminder option would be nice where you could set up your own calendar reminder which sent you a personal email based on your preference for when you wanted to be notified, about how far into the future of the Calendar and how frequently.\r\neg. Reminder for MRoff - Birthday Calendar - Remind me Weekly about all events coming in the next two weeks\r\n\r\n{panel:title=Atlassian Status Update, March 2015}\r\nFor those watching this ticket: We now have a simple version of reminders deployed to Cloud instances. You can create/modify reminders by editing a calendar's event types. Please try it out and give us feedback (either leave a comment here, or feel free to contact me directly: snorrish@atlassian.com). We'll make Reminders available to Server customers in coming week(s).\r\n\r\n[~snorrish] {panel}",
