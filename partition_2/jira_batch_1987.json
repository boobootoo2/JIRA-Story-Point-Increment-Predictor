This is a request for Confluence Cloud.\r\n\r\nAn example use case would be the embedding of Glossary terms in a statement on a Confluence page. It would be nice to create a term in the glossary, and then reference the definition for the term in the text I am writing.\r\n\r\nHaving hard-coded text in the mouseover would not be very useful for this use case, since the glossary definition could be referenced across many pages and needs to be the same on each reference.\r\n\r\nOur current workaround is to place the glossary terms each in separate pages, then referencing definitions where needed using Expand macros and URL links to the anchors in the definitions.\r\n\r\nFinally, here is an example of functionality that is similar to what we would like to see. We would implement this in a user created macro, but are unable to do that in Confluence Cloud.\r\n\r\n[Building a Glossary in Confluence|[http://jodiem.com.au/2011/08/13/building-a-glossary-in-confluence/]]",
