However, there is no explanation around the breadcrumbs setting, nor are there any related tickets visible in [http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Issues+Resolved+in+Confluence+4.0], nor is there any additional details provided in [http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Confluence+4.0+Upgrade+Notes].\r\n\r\nI recognize that an ellipsis is provided that can be clicked to completely expand the breadcrumbs.  However, this requires an additional click, and having this expanded by default doesn't use any additional screen real estate for most pages and browsers.\r\n\r\nPlease add this back, either as a global configuration setting, and/or possibly as a per-space setting (such that it can be configured to match different themes, etc. used by different spaces), and/or even as a per-user setting such that it can be controlled to match individual user preference.\r\n\r\nAt the moment, all I can see is that the ellipsis require an additional click to expand, without seeing any positives to having the \"Number of Ancestors to Show in Breadcrumbs\" setting removed.\r\n\r\nThanks!",

Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Create a PowerPoint file in Office 2007. Add a slide with text, a slide with a chart, a slide with SmartArt, and a Slide with an image. Save as PPTX\r\n# Upload to a Confluence Page and insert an Office Connector\r\n# Slides with Charts and SmartArt appear blank. Other slides with images/text look fine.\r\n\r\nThis is consistently repeatable, even when using other people's PPTX files.\r\n\r\nI have inserted the Test.pptx (fails), Test.ppt (works), and a screenshot of how they appear on the page when viewing the same slide (PPTX on top, PPT below that).\r\n\r\nI believe this is an extremely important bug to fix, as otherwise it severely limits the viability of using the Office Connector to view PowerPoint files as time goes on.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n# Open the PPTX in PowerPoint and save as a Office 2003-2007 PPT\r\n# Upload to a Confluence Page and insert an Office Connector\r\n# Slides with Charts and SmartArt display correctly (as do all other slides)\r\n\r\nNB: The workaround may not work in all cases, we have examples of files that are saved as PPT that also display the problem. In that case, some alternatives are:\r\n* Save the file as a PDF instead\r\n* Take a screenshot of how the image looks when displayed in Powerpoint directly, and insert that as an image instead of the Chart or SmartArt.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Example of exception thrown:*{noformat}\r\n2012-05-29 17:47:16,521 ERROR [DefaultSlideCacheManager:thread-5] [com.benryan.conversion.AbstractSlideConversionTask] call problem while converting ???????_?????_?????_???????_????_new.pptx\r\n -- url: /plugins/servlet/pptslide | userName: admin\r\njava.lang.NullPointerException\r\n\tat com.benryan.pptx.record.AbstractSingleShape.getPredefinedShape(AbstractSingleShape.java:169)\r\n\tat com.benryan.escher.EscherRenderer.renderAutoshape(EscherRenderer.java:565)\r\n\tat com.benryan.escher.EscherRenderer.walkShapes(EscherRenderer.java:233)\r\n\tat com.benryan.ppt.PptRenderer.render(PptRenderer.java:128)\r\n\tat com.benryan.conversion.PPtDocumentConversionTask.convertFile(PPtDocumentConversionTask.java:54)\r\n...\r\n{noformat}",

Inserting a link using the v4 RTE shows the untranslated category \"Advanced\" -> \"Weitere\".\r\nWhen opening this category there's the translated text for \"Link\" (\"Verkn\u00fcpfung\") next to the input field, but it is not completely visible ... the \"g\" is missing.\r\nOn this very page, the help text is untranslated as well:\r\n- \"To insert a link to a new page, type in the desired page title.\" -> \"Zum Einf\u00fcgen eines Links zu einer noch fehlenden Seite, geben Sie den gew\u00fcnschten Seitentitel an.\"\r\n- \"To insert an anchor link, type #anchorname.\" -> \"Zum Verlinken auf einen Textankers, geben Sie #ankername ein.\"\r\n\r\nThe category \"Web link\" has also an untranslated help text:\r\n\"Web, email or any other internet address\" -> \"Webadresse, E-Mail oder andere Internetadresse\"\r\n\r\nThe category \"Recently visited\" shows a table with untranslated table headers:\r\nTitle -> \"Titel\"\r\nSpace -> \"Bereich\"\r\nLast Modified -> \"Zuletzt ge\u00e4ndert\"\r\n\r\n3. The toolbar is partly untranslated too:\r\n- Table -> \"Table\"\r\n- Hold shift for a table without a heading -> \"Dr\u00fccken Sie Schift f\u00fcr eine Tabelle ohne \u00dcberschriftszeile\"\r\n- Insert -> \"Einf\u00fcgen\"\r\n- Other Macros -> \"Andere Makros\" or \"Weitere Makros\"\r\n\r\nIn the paragraph style dropdown:\r\n- Preformatted -> Vorformatiert\r\n- Quote -> Zitat\r\n\r\nIn the text style dropdown:\r\n- Subscript -> Tiefgestellt\r\n- Superscript -> Hochgestellt\r\n- Monospace -> Feste Breite\r\n- Clear formatting -> Formatierung entfernen\r\n\r\nAlign left / center / right -> Links / zentriert / rechts ausrichten\r\nMerge table cells -> Tabellenzellen zusammenf\u00fchren\r\nSplit merged table cells -> Zusammengef\u00fchrte Tabellenzellen wieder auftrennen\r\nRow / Column / Cell highlight -> Zeile / Spalte / Zelle hervorheben\r\n\r\nThat's all I found so far.

I cannot proceed and cannot escape this screen, even after restarting the service. I see the little spinning circle I am told that less than a second elapsed endlessly. It does say:\r\n\r\n\"Local administrator account created.\r\n\r\nWe have created a local administrator with the same username and password as the JIRA system administrator you provided. This will ensure that you can always log into Confluence to update the system configuration.\"\r\n\r\nThe next button is visible but cannot be clicked.\r\n\r\nIf I refresh the page I get one of the following next to the spinning circle (in no particular order): \"Synchronisation completed successfully.\", \"Synchronisation started.\", and \"embedded.crowd.directory.caching.sync.full\"\r\n\r\nI noticed something else odd - in JIRA, on the Configure Other Applications screen. I had created an application named \"confluence\" with IP address ::1, 127.0.0.1 and the actual IP address of my machine. This had worked find with Confluence 3.5. However after setting up Confluence 4.0 beta 2 there is a new application here with the following application name:\r\n\r\n\"Confluence - localhost - c2f77bbd-57fe-3852-bda6-8bfc6c0cdca9\"\r\n\r\nThe only IP address on that is the real IP address, it doesn't have the local addresses. I tried adding these and restarting confluence (from init.d) but it didn't help.\r\n\r\nI have confirmed this is not a problem with Confluence 3.5 (though this is post-setup in that version). I have tried recreating the confluence database and deleting the application data - this allows me to run through setup again but it hangs at the same place.\r\n\r\nh4. Workaround:\r\n# In Chrome right click the greyed out button and select 'Inspect'\r\n# The HTML should read:\r\n{code}\r\n<input class=\"aui-button aui-button-primary\" id=\"nextButton\" type=\"submit\" value=\"Next >>\" disabled=\"disabled\">\r\n{code}\r\n# Remove the disabled attribute so it will looks like:\r\n{code}\r\n<input class=\"aui-button aui-button-primary\" id=\"nextButton\" type=\"submit\" value=\"Next >>\">\r\n{code}\r\n# The Next button will be enabled for the next page.",

See suggestion from Tim below:\r\n\r\nSuggestion: Action Item overview (tasklist item overview) in dashboard\r\nThe idea is to have an additional tab in the dashboard of each of our employees, where either:\r\n- all action items\r\n- only action items of a particular space\r\ncreated via dynamic tasklist are summarized and shown\r\n\r\nThe action items should be shown in a table (searchable, filterable/hideable and sortable). \r\nTable-Fields:\r\n- status\r\n- Priority\r\n- additional responsibles (besides me), \r\n- when created\r\n- deadline\r\n- topic (maybe via the name of the sub-page and dirct link to it)\r\n\r\nBenefit: I as a user do not have to search for all my action items on 1mio wiki pages, but have them all in one table (searchable, filterable and sortable).",

The suggestion from support was to have each of the 500 Confluence users individually set their language preference to US English. This is not practical and seems unnecessary, since the global language setting has already been changed to US English.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if this only affects the Team Calendar plugin/macro, but that option wasn't available to select as a component.",
