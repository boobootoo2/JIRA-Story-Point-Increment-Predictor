      "description": "{panel:title=Issue Partially Fixed}\r\nThe root cause of this issue has been addressed in the following versions of Confluence:\r\n * Enterprise release 6.6.x stream: Confluence 6.6.12+\r\n * Enterprise release 6.13.x stream: Confluence 6.13.1+\r\n * Regular release stream: Confluence 6.14.0+\r\n\r\nPlease do note, however, that this is a data corruption issue. If you are on one of the releases mentioned above, new data corruption will not occur, but existing stale drafts that have had their modification date wrongly updated will continue to show. We are currently working on an upgrade task to fix this. Please see\u00a0CONFSERVER-58285. In the mean time, the workaround\u00a0 mentioned below can be applied on a page by page basis.\r\n{panel}\r\nh4. Issue Summary\r\n\r\nIn some cases, After clicking on the _Edit_ button of a page, the user has the impression of editing an old version of it.\r\n Checking the content of the current published page and the content that appears while editing it, they are different, but seems to match exactly what it was in one of the previous versions.\r\n\r\nFor example, this is the content of the latest published version of a page while on the _view mode_:\r\n !current-page.png|thumbnail! \r\n When clicking on the _Edit_ button, this is the content you get while on the _editing mode_:\r\n !editing-page.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nThis only occurs when Collaborative Editing (CE) is enabled.\r\n If you *disable* CE, and edit the same page, then you get the current content in the _edit mode_, such as the image below:\r\n !editing-page-full.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nThis only affects some pages on a very specific situation (which is described in the next session), meaning that you don't see this behavior on all pages of the Confluence instance.\r\n\r\nThis issue was confirmed in versions *6.6.3* and *6.12.1*, meaning that it may affect any version with Collaborative Editing before and including *6.12.1*.\r\nh4. How to Reproduce the Issue\r\n # Have a Confluence instance configured with CE enabled.\r\n # Create a blank space.\r\n ** Space Name: _Space A_.\r\n ** Space Key: _SPACEA_.\r\n # Create another blank space.\r\n ** Space Name: _Space 1_.\r\n ** Space Key: _SPACE1_.\r\n # In _Space 1_, create a blank page with title _Page 1_.\r\n !page1_img001.png|thumbnail!\r\n # In _Space A_, create a page named _Page A_.\r\n ** Add any content you like, but make sure to include a [link|https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/links-776656293.html] to _Page 1_.\r\n !pageA_img001.png|thumbnail!\r\n # Start editing _Page A_, but don't publish the contents, save it for later.\r\n !pageA_img002.png|thumbnail!\r\n # For now we have the following scenario:\r\n ** Collaborative Editing enabled.\r\n ** _Space 1_ with page _Page 1_.\r\n ** _Space A_ with page _Page A_ with a link to _Page 1_ as part of its contents.\r\n ** A draft of _Page A_ with _unpublished changes_.\r\n ** If we check the {{CONTENT}} table for _Page A_, there are 2 records, one for the page and the other related to its draft.\r\n !pageA_img003.png|thumbnail!\r\n # [Turn CE *off*|https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/administering-collaborative-editing-858772086.html#AdministeringCollaborativeEditing-Changetheeditingmode] using the Confluence UI.\r\n # Start editing _Page A_ again and publish the modifications.\r\n ** Since CE is off, it will not use the modifications that were in the shared draft.\r\n !pageA_img004.png|thumbnail!\r\n # If we check the {{CONTENT}} table for _Page A_, now we have 3 records.\r\n !pageA_img005.png|thumbnail!\r\n # Move _Page 1_ from _Space 1_ to any other Space, such as _Space A_.\r\n !page1_img002.png|thumbnail!\r\n # If you check the storage format of _Page A_, the source related to the link to _Page 1_ has changed.\r\n !pageA_img006.png|thumbnail!\r\n # If you check the {{lastmoddate}} value of _Page A_'s draft, it was changed.\r\n ** Note that the {{lastmoddate}} value of the current version hasn't changed.\r\n !pageA_img007.png|thumbnail!\r\n # [Turn CE *on*|https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/administering-collaborative-editing-858772086.html#AdministeringCollaborativeEditing-Changetheeditingmode] using the Confluence UI.\r\n # Start to edit _Page A_ and it will use the shared draft of the old version, prior to disabling CE.\r\n !pageA_img008.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nh4. Expected Behavior\r\n # When editing a page with CE enabled, Confluence gives you a draft based on the last version of the page.\r\n # Move page actions doesn't update the shared draft if the {{lastmoddate}} of the shared draft is older than the published page.\r\n ** No matter if CE is off or on, Confluence should compare the timestamp of the current page version and the draft.\r\n\r\nh4. Workaround\r\n\r\nIf you identify a page is using the wrong shared draft, you can discard the draft as follows:\r\n # Click on the _Edit_ button of the page.\r\n # Add any modification to the page and click on the _Close_ button at the bottom right of the editor.\r\n # In the _Close the editor_ pop-up, select _Discard all changes_.\r\n ** (!) If you discard changes, your unpublished changes will be deleted. You can't undo this action.",

Steps to reproduce\r\n * Set up Confluence 6.6.7 with a SQL Server 2014 v12.0.5589 database (may affect other versions of SQL Server as well)\r\n * Populate the database with data with dimensions similar to this:\r\n ** Over 2 million rows in the content table\r\n ** At least one user with ~10,000 documents or versions of documents modified\r\n * Visit the recently worked on tab in the dashboard\r\n\r\nh2. Expected results\r\n\r\nDashboard tab loads in a timely manner.\r\nh2. Actual results\r\n\r\nDashboard tab never loads. The database CPU spikes for a long time and the query takes about 30 minutes to return. Due to the database being so busy this can cause stability issues causing the rest of Confluence to stop working as well.\r\nh2. Workaround\r\n\r\nThe best workaround at the moment is to disable the feature. This involves 2 steps:\r\n # Modify your reverse proxy settings to block requests to the search endpoint when the any requests matching this pattern is issued:\r\n{noformat}\r\n/rest/api/content/search\\?.*recentlyModifiedPagesAndBlogPostsByUser.*{noformat}\r\nUnfortunately there is no way to do this within Tomcat or Confluence itself.\r\n # Add the following CSS to remove the link from the dashboard:\r\n{code:java}\r\n.confluence-dashboard li.nav-item-container-recently-worked {\r\n    display: none;\r\n}\r\n{code}",

When a link to Jira issue is posted on the page, it automatically creates issue link in the following storage format\r\n\r\n{code:none}\r\n<ac:structured-macro ac:name=\"jira\" ac:schema-version=\"1\" ac:macro-id=\"638accfe-f49a-48c6-94dd-6923005b2ad8\">\r\n    <ac:parameter ac:name=\"server\">Your Company JIRA</ac:parameter>\r\n    <ac:parameter ac:name=\"serverId\">986c17b5-1e77-3526-a338-fd866f770849</ac:parameter>\r\n    <ac:parameter ac:name=\"key\">MEOW-1</ac:parameter>\r\n</ac:structured-macro>\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nOn different Confluence installations the ServerId and ServerName might be different for the same external Jira. And after exporting and importing page content, the system might end up in the state when the page has issue link to some system that is not configured as an application link.\r\n\r\nWhen such page is opened, there's an error macro placeholder in the place of issue links, which is logical because the system doesn't know anything about the external instance. But it also causes another problem, which is the subject of this issue. If you have correct issue link in the beginning of the page and then broken issue link somewhere in the middle, correct issue link will not work as well and display macro placeholder.\r\n\r\nPlease see the attached screenshot.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to reproduce\r\n* create a page with two correctly set issue links in it\r\n* go to database and change server id and server name for the second link to invalid values (alternatively you can import pages from another system with issue links to unknown Jira location)\r\n* flush all caches\r\n* refresh the page and check issue links\r\n\r\n_Expected_: first normal issue link works as expected, while the second throws an error\r\n_Actual_: both issues don't work\r\n\r\nh3. How the problem should be fixed\r\n\r\nThe problem reproduces because Jira macro tries to resolve multiple issues in single batch. When it fails on invalid issue because can't find a server, it will also corrupt macro representation for correct one. This also explains why only the first application link was corrupted.\r\n\r\nThe problem happens in {{confluence-jira-plugin}}:\r\n{code:java}\r\n// Collect all possible server IDs from the macro definitions\r\nfor (MacroDefinition singleIssueMacroDefinition : singleIssueMacroDefinitions) {\r\n    String key = singleIssueMacroDefinition.getParameter(JiraIssuesMacro.KEY);\r\n    String serverId = getServerIdFromKey(singleIssueMacroDefinition.getParameters(), key, new DefaultConversionContext(entity.toPageContext()));\r\n\r\n    if (serverId != null) {\r\n        macroDefinitionByServer.put(serverId, singleIssueMacroDefinition);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n{code}\r\n\r\n If there's an issue link with invalid server info in the system, it shouldn't affect other correct issue links. This is not the case right now because of batch nature of confluence-jira-plugin. We need to add correct error handling.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nThe easiest way to fix broken links is to create application links to missing system. Luckily, when Jira macro resolves server information, it first tries to find application link with given ServerName and only in the case of failure fallbacks to ServerId. Because of this you can create application link with exactly the same name as you see in a page storage format parameter {{<ac:parameter ac:name=\"server\">}} pointing to the correct Jira location.",

Summary\r\nIn instances where nodes have *not had downtime* or required a restart, but the index has been rebuilt on one node, automatically replicating the index in the background to the other nodes is useful to administrators who wish to maximize uptime. \r\n\r\nIf a manual index rebuild is triggered, it should be sufficient to flag that node's index as the most current copy for replication to the other nodes without downtime.\r\n\r\nIn this scenario, only the node with the already-rebuilt index will have a current index, and thus it would be recommended to load balance users to only that node during said index replication process, to ensure their search results are current and complete.\r\n\r\nh3. Environment\r\nConfluence Data Center 6.x\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Current State\r\nCurrently, the index replication only occurs on startup of a node, thus requiring a node to be restarted in order to either automatically pull a fresh copy of the index.

Summary\r\nWhen attempting to add information to a user's profile, it's not possible to save the changes if there's no write permission all the way through the origin of the user (the final directory that this user comes from).\r\n\r\nAn example of a scenario in which the problem happens:\r\n# Confluence is set with Read/Write permissions to Crowd;\r\n# Crowd is connected to the internal or to an external directory in order to provide users to Confluence;\r\n# The confluence application inside Crowd does not have permissions to write to the directory that the users come from.\r\n\r\nIn this scenario, if we update the *About Me* section of a user's profile in Confluence, the application throws an error related to a lack of permissions as Crowd does not allow updates in the directory. However, the profile details are only stored locally in Confluence, so the application should never try to update Crowd.\r\n\r\nIf we set Confluence to connect to Crowd/Jira with Read Only permissions, Confluence will not try to update the external directory and will successfully update the user's profile.\r\n\r\nh3. Environment\r\n* Confluence connected to Crowd or Jira\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Connect Confluence to a Crowd with Read/Write permissions;\r\n# Create an application in Crowd for Confluence and add the internal directory as a source of users in that application;\r\n# Into the created application in Crowd, go to the *Permissions* tab and uncheck all permissions there, then save;\r\n# Now go to Confluence, log in with a user from Crowd, go to the Profile of this user and try to add anything in the *About Me* field, for example, then save the changes.\r\n\r\nh3.

This should apply when using the search from the Service Desk portals as well.\r\n * When viewing a page, a user should see links to the different language versions (like Wikipedia does.)\r\n * The translated pages should know which language should be considered the \"primary language\". The primary language should have a Space-level default and be switchable per page.\r\n * When a user views a\u00a0secondary language version, the\u00a0page should display a warning indicating when the primary version has been updated more recently (i.e. \"This page may no longer be current\").\r\n * Admins should be able to see a list of pages which have either not yet been translated into a given locale (e.g. \"How to Cook Tacos\" is available in English but not Japanese) or have had updates to the primary version.\r\n * Provide API hooks when a translated page was updated, along with change list (e.g. to facilitate marketplace integration of translation services.)\r\n * Admins should be able to define locale fallbacks at the space-level, for example, \"Simplified Chinese\" falls back to \"Traditional Chinese\" if available, otherwise falls back to \"English\" (meaning that Chinese users will see English content if the Chinese version isn't available.)\r\n * Ideally, URLs for other language versions would use the same slug as the primary version, could be something like /my-blog-post?lang=en and\u00a0/my-blog-post?lang=fr\r\n\r\nWikipedia should be considered a reference for this functionality. There is also a requirement doc from 2006 here [https://confluence.atlassian.com/pages/viewpage.action?spaceKey=DISC&title=Translation+of+content] which is still relevant.\r\n\r\n*Current Workarounds*\r\n\r\nCurrently, the recommended solution is to make multiple Confluence Spaces, one for each language. This approach is fraught with problems, for example, since one Service Desk can only be linked to one Confluence space, you effectively can't use Service Desks in multiple languages with Confluence.\r\n\r\n*Note about Marketplace*\r\n\r\nThe related tickets CONFCLOUD-1076 / CONFSERVER-1076 were closed 5 years ago with a note saying this would be handled by the marketplace, However, in 5 years the marketplace has not produced a tenable solution in either the cloud or server versions.\r\n There are some translation management solutions such as Appfusions ([http://www.appfusions.com/display/LNGOTKC/Home]) however these are not substitute for the core issue here, which is that Confluence lacks the proper datastructure. If Atlassian makes the proper datastructure (described above) then it will facilitate more translation solutions (e.g. human, machine, etc) being made available on the marketplace, especially if API hooks are made when content changes.",

      "description": "h1. Background\r\n\r\nWhen Confluence starts up, it verifies schemas for all tables with active objects (AO), and modifies / adds fields if required. For example, if a new version of a plugin is installed, and this plugin introduces a new field in AO class, the corresponding table will be updated and new column will be created.\r\nh1. The problem\r\n\r\nFor MySQL, migration procedure has a bug and updates several tables on every boot like this:\r\n{code:java}\r\n [[SQLAction{statement='ALTER TABLE AO_BAF3AA_AOINLINE_TASK CHANGE COLUMN BODY BODY LONGTEXT DEFAULT NULL', undoAction=null}]]\r\n\r\n\r\n[[SQLAction{statement='ALTER TABLE AO_88BB94_BATCH_NOTIFICATION CHANGE COLUMN PAYLOAD PAYLOAD LONGTEXT NOT NULL', undoAction=null}]]\r\n\r\n\r\n[[SQLAction{statement='ALTER TABLE AO_21D670_WHITELIST_RULES CHANGE COLUMN EXPRESSION EXPRESSION LONGTEXT NOT NULL', undoAction=null}]]\r\n\r\n...etc...{code}\r\nIt is not a serious issue for Confluence with one node (it only increases boot time), but in case of 2+ nodes it could lead Confluence to deadlock. Example:\r\n # The first node is executing slow query (which takes a lot of time) on\u00a0AO_BAF3AA_AOINLINE_TASK table\r\n # The second node is being restarted and is trying to modify\u00a0AO_BAF3AA_AOINLINE_TASK. But this operation is blocked while the first node does not finish all SQL queries on\u00a0AO_BAF3AA_AOINLINE_TASK\r\n # The first node tries to run more SQL queries on AO_BAF3AA_AOINLINE_TASK, but all of them are blocked by\u00a0DDL operation on the second node.\r\n\r\nAs a result, all threads could be blocked.\r\nh1. Expected behaviour\r\n\r\nConfluence should not run any DDL operations on boot if tables do not require changes.\r\nh1. Technical details\r\n\r\nIt happens in\u00a0SchemaGenerator.migrate",

      "description": "h3. Problem Definition\r\nOn a super high-level description, Confluence occupies a database connection from the connection pool throughout the entirety of the HTTP request. Once that HTTP request returns, the database connection is returned to the pool.\r\nThis is a very complex topic on how Confluence handles database connections. Several enhancements and optimizations were done throughout the years to make sure we don't hold up a database connection for long. However, the first statement still holds. \r\nWhen an HTTP request is required to interact with an external system, that database connection will still be held until a response is received from the remote server. In the case where you have a slowness with getting the response, the new incoming HTTP requests will open more database connections in Confluence.\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\nIt would be nice to have Confluence use a database connection only when it is needed within the lifespan of an HTTP request.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\nUnfortunately, there are no workarounds at the moment.",
