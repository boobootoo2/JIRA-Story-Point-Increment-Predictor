I manage versioning by creating a copy of a live page to restrict and work on until it is time to publish (this technique is used when doing individual ad hoc pages, e.g., for a small point release, rather than when we copying and versioning an entire space for a large release or UI changes).\r\nA drawback is that once the new page is 'ready' you cannot just delete the old one, as you lose your attachment links even though the attachments _appear_ to be on the copied page. So, you need to go through and manually reassign every attachment that you still need before deleting the original, which can be like looking for a needle in a haystack if you have copied screen shots (ok if working with images with naming conventions).",

I manage versioning by creating a copy of a live page to restrict and work on until it is time to publish (this technique is used when doing individual ad hoc pages, e.g., for a small point release, rather than when we copying and versioning an entire space for a large release or UI changes).\r\nA drawback is that once the new page is 'ready' you cannot delete the old one, as you use your attachment links even though the attachments appear to be on the copied page. So, you need to go through and manually reassign every attachment that you still need, which can be like looking for a needle in a haystack if you have copied screen shots (ok if working with images with naming conventions).",

A stop-gap measure was put in place to temporarily set the number of threads used to 1. This bug was fixed in 4.0.1, but the stop-gap was never removed. Confluence still defaults to 1 thread when an upgrade is occurring on a SQL Server database. Some upgrades are taking upwards of 40 hours to complete due to this.\r\n\r\nh3.

You'll need to download the same version as your existing installation before you can setup Confluence Data Center. {quote}\r\nAfter attempting this locally, the reason was discovered: The Data Center Build Number (5790) is *not* in sync with the Server edition (5788).  \r\n\r\nh5. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Install Confluence 5.7.4 standalone server with an example site content\r\n# Download Confluence 5.7.4 Data Center edition\r\n#  Migrate the existing 5.7.4 to the Data Center edition\r\n#  The install fails as shown\r\n\r\nh5.

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFCLOUD-37903].\n  {panel}\n\nFirst of all: the macro doesn't behave as expected. It's documentation says: \"List the related labels for a given set of labels, or for the current page\"\r\n\r\nI understand related labels as following:\r\nThe relation between labels exist since they are attached on the same page describing either a topic (e.g. quality, improvement, software_confluence, ...) or a type (issue, meeting-note, abbreviation, security-bulletin, ...) There is no hierarchie so that's the only relation implicitly given. If I enter one or multiple labels into the macro parameter then I expect to see all labels that are attached to all pages carrying this one/these multiple stated label.\r\nThe current output is designed with a different understanding so it actually works correct to your concept. BUT it has operational weaknesses!\r\nHow it works now:\r\nSELECT all labels FROM all pages WHERE pages have ('label1' OR 'label2' OR ...)\r\nHow it should work:\r\nSELECT all labels FROM all pages WHERE pages have ('label1' AND 'label2' AND ...)\r\n\r\nThis has to be understood:\r\n* With 'OR' one gets all occurances of labels. If one enters more labels the list increases. This functionality therefore gets less useful the more content develops. That's why I suppose this macro to be rarely used (check it in your cloud and state the result, I'm highly interested): It deliveres too much lables increasingly related to the amount of content.\r\n* With 'AND' the number of labels decreases with every added label. Principle: reduce to the max. with potential for fuzzy topic-based search.\r\n\r\nHow to improve:\r\n# output related labels of pages containing all stated labels using 'AND' in the select statement. One can decrease the amount of labels using more labels in the parameter and then reduce this amount again with another label and so on.\r\n# Allow choice of outputting 'list' or 'heatmap'.

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFCLOUD-37900].\n  {panel}\n\nFirst of all: the macro doesn't behave as expected. It's documentation says: \"List the related labels for a given set of labels, or for the current page\"\r\n\r\nI understand related labels as following:\r\nThe relation between labels exist since they are attached on the same page describing either a topic (e.g. quality, improvement, software_confluence, ...) or a type (issue, meeting-note, abbreviation, security-bulletin, ...) There is no hierarchie so that's the only relation implicitly given. If I enter one or multiple labels into the macro parameter then I expect to see all labels that are attached to all pages carrying this one/these multiple stated label.\r\nThe current output is designed with a different understanding so it actually works correct to your concept. BUT it has operational weaknesses!\r\nHow it works now:\r\nSELECT all labels FROM all pages WHERE pages have ('label1' OR 'label2' OR ...)\r\nHow it should work:\r\nSELECT all labels FROM all pages WHERE pages have ('label1' AND 'label2' AND ...)\r\n\r\nThis has to be understood:\r\n* With 'OR' one gets all occurances of labels. If one enters more labels the list increases. This functionality therefore gets less useful the more content develops. That's why I suppose this macro to be rarely used (check it in your cloud and state the result, I'm highly interested): It deliveres too much lables increasingly related to the amount of content.\r\n* With 'AND' the number of labels decreases with every added label. Principle: reduce to the max. with potential for fuzzy topic-based search.\r\n\r\nHow to improve:\r\n# output related labels of pages containing all stated labels using 'AND' in the select statement. One can decrease the amount of labels using more labels in the parameter and then reduce this amount again with another label and so on.\r\n# Allow choice of outputting 'list' or 'heatmap'. The heatmap indicates with it's size another information useful for searching.\r\n# Allow choice of space (empty=all spaces, @self=current space, one or more spaces). That enables space navigation or topic-oriented navigation within a wikipage itself.\r\n# if one clicks on one of these labels then without page reload the new label cloud is delivered and the selected label is shown in a separat list of 'selected labels' as well as the number of (visible) content items that contain all selected labels. If the user clicks on the number of content items then these are displayed for him to choose (which then actually can be connected with a page reload).\r\n\r\nRecommendation: This macro should be used in the space navigation as an option to the page tree and on the site-search (if you adapt these suggestions one can use it also as a better topic navigation). When you click a label the label heatmap reloads and the labels shown are dependent on the label(s) clicked before. If one has the interesting labels then he receives the result pages. We can have a conference to talk about that idea in detail.\r\n\r\nWith this you'll lift label usage. I am sure!

Resolutions\r\nh5. Option 1: Add property to data source\r\n# First, restore your pre-upgrade backups. The upgrade has likely failed, and your data may be in an inconsistent state that could cause problems further down the track.\r\n# Add {{accessToUnderlyingConnectionAllowed=\"true\"}} to the data source configuration in server.xml (this worked with ojdbc6.jar). Eg:\r\n{code}\r\n         <Resource\r\n         name=\"jdbc/confluence\"\r\n         auth=\"Container\"\r\n         type=\"javax.sql.DataSource\"\r\n         driverClassName=\"oracle.jdbc.OracleDriver\"\r\n         url=\"jdbc:oracle:thin:@//hostname:port/sid\"\r\n         username=\"username\"\r\n         password=\"password\"\r\n         connectionProperties=\"SetBigStringTryClob=true\"\r\n         accessToUnderlyingConnectionAllowed=\"true\"\r\n         maxActive=\"25\"\r\n         maxIdle=\"5\"\r\n         maxWait=\"10000\"\r\n         />{code}\r\n# Run the upgrade again\r\n\r\nThis fix works for the error above, and the error I described in the comments below.\r\n\r\nIf you're interested in the technical detail about this parameter and what it does:\r\n* http://tomee.apache.org/datasource-config.html#accessToUnderlyingConnectionAllowed\r\n* https://community.oracle.com/thread/281238\r\n* https://cyntech.wordpress.com/2009/02/05/cant-get-that-underlying-connection/\r\n\r\nWe have confirmed that we are closing the connections in the correct way in the Confluence source, and all of our automated testing has passed, so we are confident this change is low risk.\r\n\r\nh5. Option 2: Use Direct JDBC instead of a Data Source\r\nThis may not be feasible in all cases, but you can [configure Confluence to use a Direct JDBC resource|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Database+Setup+for+Oracle#DatabaseSetupforOracle-Step6.DownloadandinstalltheOracledatabasedriver] rather than a data source. \r\n# First, restore your pre-upgrade backups. The upgrade has likely failed, and your data may be in an inconsistent state that could cause problems further down the track.\r\n# Set up Direct JDBC on the pre-upgrade instance\r\n# Run the upgrade again",
