Issue Summary\r\n\r\nTeam Calendars attempts to perform a search for subcalendars that a user is entitled to see when attempting to add a calendar using the \"Team Calendars\" macro in Confluence. By normal behavior, this returns 10 most relevant results. However, if more results are to be generated either through changing search parameters or it uses a common search term, the sorting in the search field results will break.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Create a Team calendar (any version of the plugin is fine)\r\n# Create 11 calendars with similar names (see screenshot)\r\n# Go into a page editor, and add the \"Team Calendars macro\"\r\n# Attempt to add the calendars by name, in any order\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nCalendars will sort alphanumerically (sometimes the numerical sorting is weird due to how ordinals are treated):\r\n\r\n!image-2020-08-27-19-11-35-319.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\nh3.

Workaround\r\n\r\nCurrently there is no known workaround for this behavior. A workaround will be added here when available.\r\n\r\n- That said, you can just change all your calendars to have fully distinct names and codes so they are more readily searchable. Using generic calendar names could cause you to run into this situation.",

This should not happen:\r\n * the end-user experience can be improved by adding upfront checks directly in Confluence XML Backup code.\r\n * the end-user experience is currently impacted by such failure\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nThe Confluence site XML backup and restore processes should have a consistent level of data integrity checking so that Confluence administrators and end-users can be confident to restore their Backup successfully. This can be improved by:\r\n -  Either Adding data integrity checking to the backup process so backups fail with a warning about data integrity issues \r\n -  Or Remove data integrity checking in {{user_mapping}} from the restore process - even with duplicate user mappings Confluence ran fine\r\n\r\nh3. Why This Is Important\r\n\r\nHaving a look at these 2 Knowledge-Based articles:\r\n * *[Restore of a site XML backup fails due to duplicate entry '' for key 'unq_lwr_username' error|https://confluence.atlassian.com/confkb/restore-of-a-site-xml-backup-fails-due-to-duplicate-entry-for-key-unq_lwr_username-error-998896818.html]*\r\n * *[Confluence site XML import fails with \"duplicate key\" error|https://confluence.atlassian.com/confkb/confluence-site-xml-import-fails-with-duplicate-key-error-438993638.html]*\r\nAnd the number of support tickets that have been resolved thanks to them can give you an idea of how this had (and keep) affect the Confluence end-users experience in recent history.\r\n\r\nh3.

It happens on new pages as well as old. I created a new page and dropped in a super simple code block with no issues, but as soon as I added our custom Macro, the issue started popping up intermittently.\r\n2. The only setting that seems important here is the Syntax Highlighting, and the error will happen when its set to one of our custom languages. The rest of the options can be blank, as seen in the screenshot.\r\n3. At the moment I see it happening in Chrome and IE, though I dont have Firefox/Edge/Safari to test with.\r\n4. Create a new page. Add in a Code Block using the custom language. Anywhere else on the page, add in the custom macro. This should make the error intermittently appear.\r\n\r\nh3.

Cause:\r\nBy default, the _mywork-confluence-host-plugin_ do have preventive mechanism which will force refresh this cache value should the existing value is {{NULL}} as shown in the code snippet below.\r\n{code:java|title=HostServiceImpl.java}\r\n    private Option<ApplicationLink> lookupAppLink(final HostType hostType) {\r\n        final Option<ApplicationId> hostId = hostIdCache.getHost(hostType.name());\r\n        if (hostId != null) {\r\n            log.debug(\"HostIdCache contained [{}] {}\", hostType, hostId);\r\n            return hostId.flatMap(toAppLink);\r\n        } else {\r\n            log.debug(\"HostIdCache didn't contain any info on [{}]; forcing a refresh of host info\", hostType);\r\n            return updateHostAvailability().get(hostType);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n{code}\r\nHowever, as what we've observed from the log snippet above - the {{HostIdCache}} is currently being recognised as *not {{NULL}}* since its current value is set to *{{none()}}*. Because of this, the force refresh mechanism then won't be triggered by _mywork-confluence-host-plugin_ automatically. This is a bug in the _mywork-confluence-host-plugin_.\r\n\r\nh3.

Environment\r\nReproduced in Confluence version *7.4.x* and *7.6.x* and/or using UPM version *4.0.17*\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n* Configure the Confluence JVM to run with *-Dupm.pac.disable=true*\r\n** This will disable the *Connect to the Atlassian Marketplace* checkbox in the UPM Settings\r\n* Tick back the *Connect to the Atlassian Marketplace* checkbox. \r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nConfluence should not be able to call the Marketplace when *-Dupm.pac.disable=true* is set, regardless of UI settings. It should be a hard stop for all calls.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nConfluence is able to call the MarketPlace even when *-Dupm.pac.disable=true* is set, by tweaking the UI.\r\n\r\nh3.

      "description": "h3. Issue Summary\r\nOracle provides a feature called Native Network Encryption: [ORACLE\\-BASE \\- Native Network Encryption for Database Connections|https://oracle-base.com/articles/misc/native-network-encryption-for-database-connections] This feature was previously part of the Advanced Security Option license, and provides connection encryption without requiring client side configuration. \r\n\r\nWhen this feature is enabled, it adds 350ms+ to the time required to establish a database connection. This alone will cause noteworthy performance degradation, but when combined with the default database connection pool manager in Confluence, c3p0, it can cause intermittent outages and extreme performance degradation.\r\n\r\nOracle have stated that this latency is working as intended: [Slow Connection Using 12c Client When Network Encryption Is Enabled|https://support.oracle.com/knowledge/Oracle Database Products/2247689_1.html]\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Install any version of Confluence\r\n# Install Oracle DB 11g or later with Native Network Encryption enabled\r\n# Introduce load to the system\r\n# Monitor Confluence for delayed or timeout responses\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nConfluence should work as per normal.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nThere is a prolonged delay in establishing database connections that causes c3p0 to get stuck in a loop of attempting to obtain additional database connections. As obtaining these database connections is slow, this will take longer than normal.\r\n\r\nConfluence will remain unresponsive until it reaches the c3p0 maximum pool size for the node.\r\n\r\nThis issue will not be visible in the logs by default, but the following KB provides additional details on how to diagnose this issue: [Confluence Unresponsive Due to High Database Connection Latency|https://confluence.atlassian.com/confkb/confluence-unresponsive-due-to-high-database-connection-latency-983794798.html]\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nA workaround is detailed on this KB: [Confluence Unresponsive Due to High Database Connection Latency|https://confluence.atlassian.com/confkb/confluence-unresponsive-due-to-high-database-connection-latency-983794798.html]\r\n\r\nHowever, it may be preferably to implement SSL to the database with proper certificate exchange, or disable Native Network Encryption entirely.

This is due to a Hazelcast exception that occurs due to the detected difference between the cache sizes.\r\n\r\nThis only affects Confluence 7.0.1 Data Center onwards.\r\n{panel}\r\n*Local* or *hybrid* cache size changes do not trigger this issue, only caches marked in the advanced view as *Distributed*.\r\n{panel}\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Start with all nodes in the cluster running\r\n # Modify one of the distributed caches:\r\n ** *Confluence Administration >> General Configuration >> Cache Management >> Show Advanced View* -> Find 'Content Properties' -> Change size from 10000 to 10050.\r\n # Shutdown Confluence on one of the nodes\r\n # Start Confluence on the node that was shutdown. When starting, it will attempt to configure the distributed cache with the new size of 10050 (specified in *cache-settings-overrides.properties* in the shared home directory) however this won't match the existing size that the other nodes are using (10000) and the error below will occur.\u00a0\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nLike pre-7.0.1 versions (Hazelcast 3.8.6 and below), Confluence cluster nodes should start with no errors after cache tuning.\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nFrom 7.0.1 onwards (Hazelcast 3.11.4 and 3.11.6), after distributed cache sizes are modified, cluster nodes will not restart.\u00a0 The below exception is thrown in the atlassian-confluence.log file:\r\n{noformat}\r\ncom.hazelcast.config.ConfigurationException: Cannot add a dynamic configuration 'MapConfig{name='atlassian-cache.Cache.com.atlassian.confluence.user.ConfluenceUserPropertySetFactory.propertysets', inMemoryFormat=BINARY', backupCount=0, asyncBackupCount=0, timeToLiveSeconds=3600, maxIdleSeconds=3600, evictionPolicy='LFU', mapEvictionPolicy='null', evictionPercentage=25, minEvictionCheckMillis=100, maxSizeConfig=MaxSizeConfig{maxSizePolicy='PER_NODE', size=10050}, readBackupData=false, hotRestart=HotRestartConfig{enabled=false, fsync=false}, nearCacheConfig=NearCacheConfig{name=default, inMemoryFormat=OBJECT, invalidateOnChange=true, timeToLiveSeconds=3600, maxIdleSeconds=3600, maxSize=10050, evictionPolicy='LFU', evictionConfig=EvictionConfig{size=10050, maxSizePolicy=ENTRY_COUNT, evictionPolicy=LFU, comparatorClassName=null, comparator=null}, cacheLocalEntries=true, localUpdatePolicy=INVALIDATE, preloaderConfig=NearCachePreloaderConfig{enabled=false, directory=, storeInitialDelaySeconds=600, storeIntervalSeconds=600}}, mapStoreConfig=MapStoreConfig{enabled=false, className='null', factoryClassName='null', writeDelaySeconds=0, writeBatchSize=1, implementation=null, factoryImplementation=null, properties={}, initialLoadMode=LAZY, writeCoalescing=true}, mergePolicyConfig=MergePolicyConfig{policy='com.atlassian.confluence.cluster.hazelcast.AlwaysNullMapMergePolicy', batchSize=100}, wanReplicationRef=null, entryListenerConfigs=[], mapIndexConfigs=[], mapAttributeConfigs=[], quorumName=null, queryCacheConfigs=[], cacheDeserializedValues=INDEX_ONLY}' as there is already a conflicting configuration 'MapConfig{name='atlassian-cache.Cache.com.atlassian.confluence.user.ConfluenceUserPropertySetFactory.propertysets', inMemoryFormat=BINARY', backupCount=0, asyncBackupCount=0, timeToLiveSeconds=3600, maxIdleSeconds=3600, evictionPolicy='LFU', mapEvictionPolicy='null', evictionPercentage=25, minEvictionCheckMillis=100, maxSizeConfig=MaxSizeConfig{maxSizePolicy='PER_NODE', size=10000}, readBackupData=false, hotRestart=HotRestartConfig{enabled=false, fsync=false}, nearCacheConfig=NearCacheConfig{name=default, inMemoryFormat=OBJECT, invalidateOnChange=true, timeToLiveSeconds=3600, maxIdleSeconds=3600, maxSize=10000, evictionPolicy='LFU', evictionConfig=EvictionConfig{size=10000, maxSizePolicy=ENTRY_COUNT, evictionPolicy=LFU, comparatorClassName=null, comparator=null}, cacheLocalEntries=true, localUpdatePolicy=INVALIDATE, preloaderConfig=NearCachePreloaderConfig{enabled=false, directory=, storeInitialDelaySeconds=600, storeIntervalSeconds=600}}, mapStoreConfig=MapStoreConfig{enabled=false, className='null', factoryClassName='null', writeDelaySeconds=0, writeBatchSize=1, implementation=null, factoryImplementation=null, properties={}, initialLoadMode=LAZY, writeCoalescing=true}, mergePolicyConfig=MergePolicyConfig{policy='com.atlassian.confluence.cluster.hazelcast.AlwaysNullMapMergePolicy', batchSize=100}, wanReplicationRef=null, entryListenerConfigs=[], mapIndexConfigs=[], mapAttributeConfigs=[], quorumName=null, queryCacheConfigs=[], cacheDeserializedValues=INDEX_ONLY}'\r\n{noformat}\r\nThe actual 'name' in MapConfig will differ, depending on which cache value was adjusted.\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nPlease use one of the following workarounds to temporarily fix the problem:\r\n # Change the modified cache setting back to the previous value\r\n _or_\r\n # Shutdown all cluster nodes, then restart them one by one.\r\n # Adding the JVM parameter '-Dhazelcast.dynamicconfig.ignore.conflicts=true' to all cluster nodes's startup command (in setenv.sh/bat).",
