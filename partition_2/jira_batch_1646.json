Summary\r\n\r\nWhen using the Page Properties Report macro will not show results if used with a Page Properties macro that has a Page Properties ID that begins with zero (0)\r\n\r\nh3.

Expected Results\r\n\r\nWe would expect that the information from the page properties macro would generate in the page properties report macro.  We can even see the correct information in the preview of the Page Properties Report Macro, but it does not render once saved.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nNo information renders and a message 'No Content Found' is displayed\r\n \r\nh3. Notes\r\nThis issue appears to have began in version 5.8.16.

      "description": "h3. Summary\r\n\r\nUser directories do not work as expected. Internal Confluence Directory and Internal Delegated LDAP directory are not treated as separate when adding a user manually to the Internal Delegated LDAP directory.\r\n\r\nIf a username (_USERA_) exists in the Confluence Internal directory, the same username cannot be manually added to the Internal Delegated LDAP directory unless the user in the Confluence Internal directory is deleted. In some cases accounts may not be deleted because they have created content. Disabling the account does not work either. When you attempt to manually add _USERA_ to the Internal Delegated LDAP directory, Confluence will display the \"A user with this username already exists\" error. The end result is that the LDAP user is unable to be added, and Confluence is not shadowing the accounts. The intended functionality is that the account should be able to be added. It is possible to add the account if the *Copy user on login* functionality is selected in the Internal Delegated LDAP directory settings.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Add _USERA_ to Confluence Internal Directory\r\n# Create an Internal Delegated LDAP directory\r\n# *Do not* select \"Copy user on login\"\r\n# Ensure the Internal Delegated LDAP directory is in the first position\r\n# Attempt to add _USERA_ to the Internal Delegated LDAP directory (Note: _USERA_ is an existing valid LDAP user)\r\n# Receive \"A user with this username already exists\" error message\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nConfluence should allow the creation of _USERA_ in the Internal Delegated LDAP directory even if _USERA_ also exists in the Confluence Internal directory because they are separate directories. Confluence should then shadow the accounts and treat them as one profile because the usernames are the same.\r\n\r\nConfluence should be querying the cwd_user table when checking for the duplicate username, but it appears it may be querying the user_mapping table instead. However, we were not able to confirm the queries being run with DEBUG logging on the crowd logs.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nConfluence will not allow the creation of _USERA_ even though the Internal Delegated LDAP directory is in the first position. Instead, Confluence displays \"A user with this username already exists\" error.\r\n\r\nThe same error is displayed even if you disable _USERA_ in the Confluence Internal directory.\r\n \r\nh3. Notes\r\nIf we rename _USERA_ in the Internal Confluence directory to something else, ex: _USERA1_, Confluence then allows the _USERA_ to be added manually to the Internal Delegated LDAP directory, however then the accounts are not shadowed. If _USERA_ in the Confluence Internal directory had any user information, it would now be treated as a second account.\r\n\r\nWe were not able to confirm the queries being run as enabling DEBUG logging on:\r\ncom.atlassian.crowd.directory\r\ncom.atlassian.crowd.embedded\r\ncom.atlassian.confluence.user.crowd\r\n\r\nOnly logged:\r\n{code}\r\n2016-02-05 17:59:44,443 DEBUG [http-nio-5814-exec-1] [confluence.user.crowd.CachedCrowdMembershipDao] isUserDirectMember checking direct membership for user [ admin ] and group [ confluence-administrators ]\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nh3.Workaround\r\nTo workaround this issue, you can use the \"Copy user on login\" function. Then when _USERA_ logs in with their LDAP credentials, it will automatically create the account without error, even though _USERA_ already exists in the Confluence Internal Directory.\r\n\r\n# Go to *General Configuration* > *User Directories*\r\n# Ensure your Internal Delegated LDAP directory is in the first position\r\n# *Edit* the Internal Delegated LDAP \r\n# Check the *Copy users on Login* box\r\n# Enter in your desired *Default Group Memberships* for the users who are able to successfully authenticate, such as *confluence-users*\r\n# Select *Test Settings*\r\n# Select *Save Settings*\r\n# Have desired users log in, and an account will be created in the Internal Delegated LDAP directory, and will shadow the account from the Confluence Internal Directory\r\n# If you would not like to continue automatically copying users on login, go back to the Internal Delegated LDAP settings and uncheck the box and test and save the settings",

Could same be used in attachments too? If I have for example 5 versions of attachment.docx and versions 4 and 5 were created in parallel and changes in version 4 are huge and version 5 contain only some minor changes (based on version 3). In that case I would like to \"revert\" back to version 4 (it would become version 6) and use that as a base for future changes.\r\n\r\nI can do that manually now by opening version 4 and reuploading it as version 6, but could same be just automatized by \"Restore this version\" feature just like in page history?",
