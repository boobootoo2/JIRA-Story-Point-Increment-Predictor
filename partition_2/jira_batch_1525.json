      "description": "Currently, Crucible requires that code be checked in before it can be reviewed. While this works in the early stages of development, it does not work well during late stages just before bit release where some changes might be refused from entering the build. In this latter case, we must have developers perform their change on their own private branch, check in the work, and then create a code review based on that if we want the right to refuse the change. This branch, review, merge model introduces the problem in that if the branch and merge are not done correctly then other problems could be introduced into the build. Also, developers generally strongly prefer not to work on private branches in Peforce in our environment. Working on tip is just much easier, especially when continuous builds are taking place.\r\n\r\nSo, I would like to see Crucible have the feature where the developer could identify files open for edit in their client workspace for a code review. This would solve a lot of process related problems for us.\r\n\r\nBrian Jones",

Furthermore, other forms of the word will always be listed after any pages with \"stemmed\" version, no matter how recent or popular.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Create a page with word \"Loader\" in title (i.e. \"Loader not working\")\r\n # Create another with word \"Load\" in title (i.e. \"Load a page\")\r\n # Create a third page with word \"load\" in title (i.e can't load)\r\n # Search for \"loader\" (no quotes)\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nYou get a page with word \"Loader\" in the title on top of your search results\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nYou get search results for all pages containing the word \"Load\" because lucene stemmed the word when indexing, however, page with \"Loader\" in the title will not be in any way prioritised.\r\n!Screenshot 2021-12-22 at 19.42.11.png|width=590,height=292!\r\n\r\nIn fact, if you have more pages containing the word \"load\" in the title than can fit into quick search results, page title \"Loader not working\" will not appear in quick search at all\r\nFurthermore, adding a new page called \"Loading something\" and searching for \"loading\" will not prioritise the new page either, despite it being more recent and closer matched keyword. It will also go to the bottom of the results after all the pages with \"load\" are listed\r\n\r\n!Screenshot 2021-12-22 at 19.52.02.png|width=586,height=294!\r\n\r\nIt appears that search algorithm prioritisation is ignoring exact matching as well as stemmed versions of the word\r\nh4.

We have customers who create large tables in Confluence and run into large input delays when editing solo. We have requested they break up the tables into smaller pages, but the reality of this is limited. I figured, instead of turning of collaborative editing site-wide, could we have it engage under certain conditions?\r\n\r\nIf this isn't feasible, could we have the option to turn off collaborative editing on a single page/space rather than Confluence-wide? That way pages that need collaborative editing can have it on and larger pages that a single person is updating at a time would run a bit smoother with it off.",

So when it find username in the first directory it does ignore the same username from second directory.\r\n\r\nSo 'Jack' was not able to login Jira until we renamed his account in the first directory to 'Jack2').\r\n\r\n(FYI [https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiraserver/managing-multiple-directories-938847057.html)]\r\n\r\nWould it be possible to improve working with multiple directories so users won't have issues when they try to login from another directory?\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThank you!",

Issue Summary\r\n\r\nWhen you create an event that is set to repeat monthly, you can set whether the event repeats on the same date each month ({*}Same date{*}), or whether it repeats on a certain day/week of the month ({*}Same day each month{*}).\r\n\r\nIf you select the *Same day each month* setting, there are 2 drop-downs to fill up, one of which is empty by default. If you leave it blank and create the event, then you won't be able to edit the frequency of the event any longer and you see this message:\r\n{quote}(i) This event was set to repeat in another calendar app. To make changes you'll need to edit this event in that app.\r\n{quote}\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Create a calendar.\r\n # Create an event of any type.\r\n # For the *Repeat* field, select {*}Monthly{*}.\r\n # Ensure the *Same day each month* option is selected.\r\n # Don't alter the drop-down values for that option. Ensure the first drop-down is blank.\r\n  !1.png|thumbnail!  !3.png|thumbnail! \r\n # Save the event.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nThe event should repeat according to the frequency you've set (monthly). If you edit the event, you should be able to edit its recurrence.\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nThe event repeats weekly. When you edit the event, you see this info message near the \"Repeat\" field.\r\n\r\n!2.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nh3. Note\r\nThis does not occur for other repeat frequencies - daily, weekly, yearly. If you create a monthly event and populate the first drop-down for the *Same day each month* option, then this issue doesn't come up as well.\r\n\r\n !4.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\nTo prevent this from happening, by default, this drop-down should *not* be blank.\r\n\r\nh3.

This breaks the default sort order set and displayed in the parent Page Properties Report Macro. However if the heading of the column is manually toggled, the correct sorting is activated.\r\nh3.

Summary\r\nCurrently, when user enter text with special text mode (monospace, subscript, superscript, strikethrough), Confluence does not highlight the button to indicate user what special text mode is currently being used. This may cause confusion to user if a mode is being use or not when entering content to page.\r\n\r\nh3. Suggestion\r\nImplement feature to highlight the special text mode button when it is being used. This feature is available in Cloud but not available in Confluence server/DC.\r\n*Example of requested feature in Confluence server/DC*\r\n !Screenshot 2021-12-01 at 10.28.04.png|thumbnail! ",
