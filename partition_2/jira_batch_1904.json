[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFCLOUD-7003].\n  {panel}\n\nWe are soon migrating all of our documentation to a Confluence site, and the strategy we had planned for new page creation by users was to have them prepare drafts in their own personal space, and then move the final page to the appropriate global space, according to a pre-defined structure.  Such a strategy prevents us against having DRAFT pages in our production spaces.  In order to enforce the strategy, we need to be able to track MOVES, so that we check if users put their pages at the right location.\r\n\r\nIn their present state, the Watch and Daily Summary e-mails are not helping us much for that purpose.  When a page has been created and modified in the last 24 hours, it appears as CREATED in the Daily Summary e-mail, which is great!  However, if a page was created yesterday, and then completed and moved today in the proper global space, it will only appear as LAST EDITED... in the Daily Summary or in the Watch e-mail subject.\r\n\r\nWe DON'T want to monitor every EDITED page, only when they're MOVED.  Is there any way to realize this with the present Confluence versions?  If not, it would be of great help if we could watch MOVED pages in any way (Watch, Daily Summary, RSS Feed or whatever else).\r\n\r\nThanks for letting me know if it can be realized now, or else what could be the timeframe within which we could expect this improvement to be done.",

      "description": "Currently, if you change a page name or move it to a new space, any refernences such as [page] or [space:page] or even [alias|page] are renamed, and I haven't tested it deeply, but I think {include:page} are also renamed.\r\n\r\nHowever, my own {edit-include:page} is not renamed, so links are often broken. Also, the {metadata-from:page|key} macros and many many others are not renamed. \r\n\r\nReferncing a page is a common activity.  I would like a 'weakly-typed' (or even strongly-typed if you want) page refernece parameter for *all* user macros, which supports page renaming.\r\n\r\nAny named user macro parameter that is 'page' or 'pages' or 'target' or 'targets' or 'root' (and perhaps a few other common words) almost exclusively refer to a page (or perhaps a comma or semicolon delimited list of pages.)  Therefor this sort of change would be almost certainly backwards compatible in most cases, and would also enforce people using these parameter names carefully in the future macros.\r\n\r\nI propose if there is a named parameter of one of the above, the content of the parameter is treated as though it is a page reference, and it is updated when the page name changes. Also, if there is a unamed parameter which corresponds to the name of an existing page, it should also be treated as a page reference.\r\n\r\nThese references are also not counted in the 'incoming-links', and in most cases it would also be good to have the association between two pages that is made by a macro indexed in the incoming links table.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n",

      "description": "After clearing an obsolete group of its members and removing the group itself, I was no longer able to access any of the spaces to which the group was permissioned (before being removed), except as an admin user. Attempting such access was giving an immediate system error (complaining about getActiveGroups() not being able to find a SpacePermission object with a particular ID - presumably that of the removed group).\r\n\r\nAfter getting that error, and going past the initial shock and horror (at the downtime this would have caused to a lot of people the next Monday morning at work), I looked around the spacepermissions table, finding that there was indeed no record with such an ID in the table. This made suspect a problem with caching not being invalidated. I then went into the administration console and flushed all caches. Thankfully that immediately fixed the problem and I was able to access all those spaces again as a non-admin user.\r\n\r\nAnyway,  looks like your group removal code is not invalidating the caches it should...\r\n\r\nClose call, and it also made me realize that backups hadn't been happening recently due to backup volume permissioning problems ironically: so maybe this was a blessing in disguise!",

Unlike all other popular blog sites and wikis, the Confluence RSS feeds seem to be working to a different standard that isn't widely supported, or there is some problem with their content type or something?\r\n\r\n\"The content type is definitely set wrong (most browsers and other readers offer to save the file to disk) and the fact that there is no .rss extension to the action also causes some problems in badly written RSS readers (where they expect a .rss extension on the URL - sloppy, I know, but there are lots of them out there).\r\n\r\n\"It might be worth taking the format of RSS feeds from a popular blogging site, etc., and using the same format XML as they do as well as the same sort of content type.\r\n\r\n\"It should be noted that the problems seem to apply to the Feed Builder (which is pretty much useless as nothing can read the feeds, regardless of what version of RSS or Atom I choose) and also the elusive RSS feeds that are available in the \"Advanced\" tab (and, from memory, the {globalreports} macro or something like that).\"\r\n",

      "description": "I have seen many requests for hiding some of the user functionality (change password, for example) when Confluence uses LDAP authentication. I'm more interested in having that function (again, specifically change password) actually work with LDAP.  \r\n\r\nThe LDAP server we are using is strictly for our development environment...it's not tied to a corporate LDAP server.  Instead of developing or installing more tools to manage a simple task like allowing a user to have the ability to change their password, it would be preferable for us to have one of our existing tools support that functionality.  In our case, Confluence (or JIRA, really) seems like the ideal candidate.",

These users show up with just their surname.\r\n\r\n 2. Typically a Dutch problem: surnames here often consist of a prefix (in my case 'van') and a 'main' surname (Zwetselaar). At this company, the prefix is stored in a separate attribute (snPrefix), and the main surname in the sn attribute. As a consequence, I show up as \"Marco Zwetselaar\" which isn't right either.\r\n\r\n 3. Not a problem here, but I guess it would be in other countries, where surname is customarily shown before given name.\r\n\r\nThe solution would be if, instead of givenName + sn, the cn attribute would should be shown as the display name of the user. AFAIK, convention ally LDAPs use precisely that attribute to store the full name of the user. \r\n",
