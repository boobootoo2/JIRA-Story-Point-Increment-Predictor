      "description": "I wanted to test Confluence 3.0 so I downloaded confluence-3.0.0_01-std.zip, extracted it and ran it, as usual. I told Confluence to install the Standard Site and HSQL. \r\nAfterwards, when I first saw the Demonstration Space it showed many errors of missing macros (plugins). The Dashboard shows many missing macros as well.\r\nI can't even easily access the Administration Menu, because the Javascript libraries are missing. I was able to access the Administration Menu over the known URL for the Admin-Menu. Still, like this, I can't really test the new version, since it even misses the plugin repository and I'm not able to install missing plugins for macros.\r\n\r\nThis error seems  to have slipped through quality assurance - or am I doing something wrong?",

      "description": "Confluence allows its users to specify a \"Profile Picture,\" an image that appears on many pages related to the user.  A user can either upload a custom image, or select one from a set provided by Confluence.  Confluence uses the /users/doeditmyprofilepicture.action path to process requests to change a user's Profile Picture.\r\n\r\nThe doeditmyprofilepicture.action hander does not sufficiently validate the contents of the userProfilePictureName parameter, however.  While Confluence does check the parameter to ensure that it begins with \"/images/icons/profilepics/\", which is the path to the built-in set of images, it does not reject \"..\" and similar strings.  As a result, a user can use directory traversal to specify any URL on the Confluence web server as his or her Profile Picture.\r\n\r\nMany (all?) Confluence administrative tasks can be accomplished using GET requests, so there are URLs on the Confluence web server that correspond to many administrative tasks. For example, this path:\r\n\r\n/admin/users/adduserstogroup.action?usersToAdd=joeschmo&membersOfGroupTerm=confluence-administrators\r\n\r\nAdds user joeschmo to the Confluence administrators group.\r\n\r\nIn order for an attacker to gain administrative access, then, all he or she must do it specify the appropriate adduserstogroup.action URL as a Profile Picture, and wait for an administrator to view a page that displays the Profile Picture.  It should not be a very long wait, since many pages fit that description.\r\n\r\nWhile Confluence 3.0 does not fix the validation of the userProfilePictureName parameter to doeditmyprofilepicture.action, it does\r\ncontain cross-site request forgery protection that makes exploiting it much more difficult.\r\n\r\nAll requests that actually \"do things\" require an additional parameter called atl_token, which is randomly generated and tied to a specific session.  Without knowledge of their values for this parameter, it is not possible to cause other users to carry out actions when viewing a page with your Profile Picture.\r\n\r\nSee also a draft security advisory I would eventually like to release:\r\n\r\nhttp://userwww.service.emory.edu/~ekenda2/EMORY-2009-02.txt",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFCLOUD-16124].\n  {panel}\n\nThe tab is horrible. The \"details\" are in the advanced tab. The most advanced features (\"orphans\", etc) are at the top, the rarely-used ones are in the middle, and the most practical ones (RSS, Watch, PDF export) are at the bottom, more or less. The main page real estate is used by the description.  Some functions like converting to personal space are only visible in edit mode (wtf!?), and you also only see the default page in edit mode (it should be displayed in view mode at least).  And it is UGLY.\r\n\r\nIt will be impossible to make it much worse, so let's try to make it nicer. For example by promoting the most important features. we could for example move the main actions to the right and give them larger buttons, and a brief textual description, so they are more obvious. We should probably rename the menu item from \"advanced\" to something like \"space actions\", and then have a little \"advanced\" tab inside the screen. I don't think that \"watching a space\" or getting a RSS feed should remain hidden away in an \"advanced\" tab these days anymore. We need to promote them!",

I guess it'd be much better to give distinct names for such operations (getPage and getPageById for example).\r\n\r\nFor testing please use SvcUtil.exe from .NET FW 3. not wsdl.exe from .NET 2.0 (which is almost depricated).\r\n\r\nFor the wsdl from above SvcUtil creates the following code (C#). Please notice two method getPage and getPage1. It's impossible to call a service via getPage1 method because server side doesn't know such method.\r\nSo in general the result client .net code is much more complex than it could be (notice wrappers and messagecontracts).

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFCLOUD-16118].\n  {panel}\n\nCurrently the new User Status updates and Follower functionality is not implemented (from what I can see in the Confluence 3.0 API) with the ability to create custom Listeners for events (e.g. there are no Events such as UserStatusUpdateEvent or UserStatusCreateConnectionEvent).\r\n\r\nThis feature is available for other content types (such as pages and blogs) which makes it easy to create plugins which do tasks when these events are fired (e.g. PageEditEvent).\r\n\r\nIf this feature was implemented it would make it very easy to create plugins which integrated with other applications/services which have similar User Status and follower features (e.g. it could integrate with Twitter, Facebook, Google Waves). There are heaps of other plugins which could be written with this functionality.",
