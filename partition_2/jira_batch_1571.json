Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nAdd the *date of the version* (that is typically displayed on the page history summary page) to the top of the page *panel* that displays the revision number.\r\nh3. Why this is important\r\n\r\nThere is no way to see to see the date of this page version unless going back to the page history summary page. The panel that displays the revision number has space available for this added field and it would be convenient to view how old or new the page is next to the revision number.\r\nh3.

      "description": "h3. *+Background+*\r\n\r\nVendor's P2 plugin bundles lots of font files that their app asynchronously loads, and they want Confluence to serve them with gzip compression.\r\n\r\nThe font files are JavaScript files, but they don't have an extension.\r\n\r\nThey were hoping to be able to make Confluence/Tomcat interpret them as {{application/javascript}} and serve them gzipped by specifying this parameter:\r\n{code:java}\r\n        <resource type=\"download\" name=\"fonts/\" location=\"/fonts\">\r\n             <param key=\"content-type\" value=\"application/javascript\"/>\r\n        </resource>\r\n{code}\r\nThe [documentation|https://developer.atlassian.com/server/confluence/adding-plugin-and-module-resources/#values-for-param-element] suggests that this should work, but it doesn't for them.\r\nh3. *+Workaround+*\r\n\r\nThey have enabled HTTP compression in Confluence\r\n\r\nExample resource definition:\r\n{code:java}\r\n    <web-resource key=\"lucid-confluence-resources\" name=\"lucid-confluence Web Resources\">\r\n        <resource type=\"download\" name=\"images/\" location=\"/images\"/>\r\n        <resource type=\"download\" name=\"fonts/\" location=\"/fonts\"/>\r\n        <context>lucid-confluence</context>\r\n    </web-resource>\r\n{code}\r\nExample path to an individual file:\r\n{code:java}\r\nresources/fonts/bundles/0c/c5/c5/39/20/f8/61/fd/fe/4a/b4/be/11/4c/f0/68/fallback/BasicLatin\r\n{code}\r\nNote that the file BasicLatin has no extension, so Tomcat is unable to determine its MIME type automatically, so it won't serve it compressed (instead it serves the file with a generic Content-Type {{application/octet-stream;charset=UTF-8}}).\r\n\r\nThey ended up going through two iterations of solutions:\r\n 1. Renamed all font files and added a .js extension to them (e.g. BasicLatin.js). After the change Tomcat began serving the files gzipped with Content-Type: application/javascript. Change the application code to use the updated URLs.\r\n 2. Vendor agrees that serving resources pre-compressed is even better. But again, Confluence's plugin framework doesn't make that straightforward. They ended up compressing all the font files with Brotli compression and implementing a custom Servlet that either serves the pre-compressed font files as is (with correct HTTP headers) or decompresses them on the fly if the browser doesn't support Brotli compression (e.g. IE11).\r\n\r\nServing static files via a custom servlet adds some overhead unfortunately (compared with serving them via an efficient static file web server), but it was still a net win overall for them.\r\nh3. *+Suggested Solution+*\r\n\r\nConfluence plugin framework should automatically handle serving pre-compressed static resources in the following way:\r\n * It should correctly detect the original MIME type of the files and have the ability to have it specified explicitly in atlassian-plugin.xml\r\n * It should support serving pre-compressed files with either gzip or brotli encoding and automatically decompress the files for clients that don't support them\r\n * If a pre-compressed resource has a filename of resources/fonts/BasicLatin.br, it should be accessible via HTTP at <plugin_resources_base_url>/fonts/BasicLatin (without the .br extension) so that I don't have to change client-side application code depending on the content encoding\r\n\r\nh3.

Information\r\n_tested in Jira 8.5.3_\r\nWhen the *HTTP Dump Log* is enabled in Jira during the request of Jira Issue Macro, we can see the below information coming from Jira:\r\n{code:title=example information for a single issue}\r\n    \t\t\t<item>\r\n    \t\t\t                <link>http://localhost:8853/j853/browse/MST-1</link>\r\n    \t\t\t                    <key id=\"10000\">MST-1</key>\r\n    \t\t\t            <summary>Do this</summary>\r\n    \t\t\t                <type id=\"10000\" iconUrl=\"http://localhost:8853/j853/secure/viewavatar?size=xsmall&amp;avatarId=10318&amp;avatarType=issuetype\">Task</type>\r\n    \t\t\t                                <priority id=\"3\" iconUrl=\"http://localhost:8853/j853/images/icons/priorities/medium.svg\">Medium</priority>\r\n    \t\t\t                        <status id=\"10000\" iconUrl=\"http://localhost:8853/j853/images/icons/status_generic.gif\" description=\"\">To Do</status>\r\n    \t\t\t                    <statusCategory id=\"2\" key=\"new\" colorName=\"blue-gray\"/>\r\n    \t\t\t                                    <resolution id=\"-1\">Unresolved</resolution>\r\n    \t\t\t                                        <assignee username=\"-1\">Unassigned</assignee>\r\n    \t\t\t                                    <reporter username=\"admin\">The Mighty Administrator</reporter>\r\n    \t\t\t                            <created>Wed, 21 Apr 2021 12:15:48 +1000</created>\r\n    \t\t\t                <updated>Fri, 14 May 2021 15:34:44 +1000</updated>\r\n    \t\t\t                                <due></due>\r\n    \t\t\t                                                                                <customfields>\r\n    \t\t\t                                                <customfield id=\"customfield_10207\" key=\"com.atlassian.jira.plugins.jira-development-integration-plugin:devsummary\">\r\n    \t\t\t                        <customfieldname>Development</customfieldname>\r\n    \t\t\t                        <customfieldvalues>\r\n    \t\t\t                            \r\n    \t\t\t                        </customfieldvalues>\r\n    \t\t\t                    </customfield>\r\n    \t\t\t                                                                <customfield id=\"customfield_10102\" key=\"com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.customfieldtypes:userpicker\">\r\n    \t\t\t                        <customfieldname>Pick Someone</customfieldname>\r\n    \t\t\t                        <customfieldvalues>\r\n    \t\t\t                            <customfieldvalue>caliburn</customfieldvalue>\r\n    \t\t\t\r\n    \t\t\t                        </customfieldvalues>\r\n    \t\t\t                    </customfield>\r\n    \t\t\t                                    </customfields>\r\n    \t\t\t    </item>\r\n{code}\r\n(i) Here, we can see that although the field {{*Development*}} is returned from Jira but there is no value in it for Confluence to display. Thus, Confluence is able to find this field, but no data is displayed in it:\r\n !screenshot-2.png|thumbnail! \r\n !screenshot-1.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\n{panel}\r\nThis is likely a limitation where Jira also plays a part and needs to be updated\r\nEg: JRASERVER-67299 is a request to have the development information exported into CSV. With this implementation, the information should also be exported into XML as well where this will resolve part of the issue from Jira's end\r\n{panel}",

Problem Summary\r\nIf the \"Confluence JIRA Plugin\" is disabled for whatever reason, the Confluence Editor will break in various ways:\r\n* If Collaborative Editing is enabled, the Editor title and body fields cannot be clicked on\r\n* If Collaborative Editing is disabled, the Editor will load for existing pages, but for new pages only the title field can be filled in\r\n\r\nAdditionally, this failure does not produce any sort of errors in the logs or in the UI, which leads to difficult troubleshooting.\r\n\r\nh2. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Install Confluence and from scratch with Collaborative Editing enabled\r\n# Go to Confluence Admin > Manage Add-ons and set the dropdown to \"All add-ons\"\r\n# Locate the \"Confluence JIRA Macro\" (plugin key: confluence.extra.jira) and Disable it\r\n# Try to create or edit a page\r\n\r\nh2.

Actual behavior\r\nTitle and Body fields in the Editor cannot be clicked on. There are no errors in the UI nor the Confluence logs.\r\n\r\nh2.

According to\u00a0[https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=829224]\u00a0and\u00a0[https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=826615], this bug is resolved in Chrome 67.0.3387.0. Target stable release for Chrome 67 is May 29 ([https://www.chromium.org/developers/calendar]).\r\n\r\nWe have confirmed the bug is fixed in current [Canary|https://www.google.co.jp/chrome/browser/canary.html] version (67.0.3390.0).\r\n{panel}\r\nh3. Summary\r\n\r\nWe cannot type Japanese characters correctly in a table with Chrome 65+ in case that the more left cell is not empty.\r\n\r\nJapanese character is generally composed of consonant+vowel letter combination like \"k\" + \"i\" = \"\u304d\" and Japanese IME helps the conversion.\r\n However, such conversion doesn't work as expected in the specific condition.\r\n\r\nAlso, this problem is not reproducible with Chrome v63 and the prior versions. This problem might be related to some spec change in Chrome.\r\nh3. Environment\r\n\r\nClient that runs the browser is\r\n * Windows and macOS\r\n * Chrome (Tested with ver. 65.0.3325.162)\r\n * Microsoft IME (Japanese) , Google Japanese IME, and Mac IME (Japanese) (This means this occurs in any IME.)\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Create a blank page.\r\n # Create a table with more than two columns.\r\n # Type some character (e.g. \"a\") in a cell in the first column.\r\n !screenshot-3.png|thumbnail!\r\n # Set IME to Japanese.\r\n # Try to type some Japanese character (e.g. \"\u304d\") in a cell more right from the cell in Step 3.\r\n (i) You need to type \"k\" + \"i\" in order to compose the Japanese character \"\u304d\".\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\n\"k\" + \"i\" should be always converted to \"\u304d\" with Japanese IME. (\"ki\" = \"\u304d\" in Japanese)\r\n [^Firefox.mov]\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\n\"k\" + \"i\" becomes \"k\u3044\". The initial consonant letter is auto-committed. (\"i\" = \"\u3044\" in Japanese)\r\n !screenshot-4.png|thumbnail! \r\n [^GoogleIME.mov] \r\n [^MicrosoftIME.mov]\r\nh3. Notes\r\n * Please note this symptom is different from the issue CONFSERVER-54326 because it reports that first letter is \"ignored\" while the letter is \"auto-committed\" in this case.\r\n * This occurs only at the Chrome environment, and IE11 also has another issue(Cannot type double byte characters in Section through IE11). Firefox works fine.\r\n * As mentioning in the above, this problem might be related to some spec change in Chrome.\r\n ** This has not occurred on Chrome v63.x and prior.\r\n ** The very similar behavior can be seen in different products (e.g. Slack) aside from Atlassian's ones\r\n *** [Latest Chrome 65 update breaks start of CJK IME input \u00b7 Issue #2009 \u00b7 quilljs/quill \u00b7 GitHub|https://github.com/quilljs/quill/issues/2009]\r\n *** [576573 - Japanese IME: First character is auto-committed on office extensions - chromium - Monorail|https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=576573] (This is a bit old report, however still opened.)\r\n *** [Google Groups \u2013 Chrome 65 \u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30c7\u30fc\u30c8\u5f8c Slack \u3067\u4e00\u6587\u5b57\u76ee\u304c\u610f\u56f3\u305b\u305a\u78ba\u5b9a\u3055\u308c\u308b\u554f\u984c\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066|https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/chrome-ja/toeoosmoBdo]\r\n\r\nh3.

This is by no means an exhaustive list, but the main points are included below:\r\n * Database port connection check\r\n ** If Synchrony is unable to connect to the database port, it will still start up anyway. It will not log any failures to either the Synchrony logs on the Confluence nodes or on the Synchrony Data Center nodes.\r\n * Database bind credentials check\r\n ** If Synchrony's startup script does not contain a valid database username/password then the startup will fail and the process will exit without a clear reason.\r\n * Version checks of Synchrony JAR and Database JAR\r\n ** On startup, Synchrony does not post what version of Synchrony is running, nor the database driver it is using. We would like to have this included in startup logs.\r\n * JWT Key check\r\n ** Synchrony requires JWT keys to startup properly. If they are not defined in environment variables or in the startup script, the startup will fail and the process will exit without a clear reason.\r\n * Cluster node connection type not logged\r\n ** On startup, Synchrony does not post the type of connection it is anticipating (tcpip, aws, or multicast). It also does not log if none of these are properly defined, or there is an error in the definitions.\r\n * MD5 Mismatch\r\n ** Synchrony will still startup if its MD5 does not match if the JAR is malformed.\r\n * Other generic script errors\r\n ** A malformed startup script can start up as long as the RUNJAVA details are correct for the Synchrony JAR, but will not function properly in the Confluence UI. No log output will mention missing variables or other malformed startup parameters.",

We should automate the creation of the start-synchrony.sh script including all variables by allowing the Admin to input all of the variables in the cluster setup UI screen.\u00a0\r\nh2. Recommendation\r\n\r\nImprove the Confluence cluster setup page, which appears when you input a Data Center license into Confluence either on initial setup or when migrating to Data Center, to include user-input boxes for Synchrony configuration parameters:\r\n !Screen+Shot+2017-10-23+at+7.52.49+PM.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nThis would include details such as the Synchrony cluster members IP, multicast address, or AWS IAM role details, plus all other relevant details needed to properly configure Synchrony standalone.\r\n\r\nThen, take the inputs received there along with the database connection details in the existing confluence.cfg.xml and inject them into the start-synchrony.sh (and .bat) script.\r\n\r\nThe result would be a start-synchrony.sh script which is ready to go and just needs to be copied over to the server on which Synchrony will be installed.",

Upgrading a Data Center install since this release does not trigger upgrades of this xml file, which can lead to new nodes having an old build number in their local home directory (since they copy the file from shared home as part of their initial setup process). This in turn can lead to fast-failing upgrades later, due to the 3-way validation check on the build number in the local home directory, and the database, and the code being deployed.\r\n\r\nConfluence must update the xml file in the shared home after any upgrade tasks are executed - ideally by the node that executes database upgrade tasks.\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nAfter completing an upgrade on a single node, the system administrator can manually copy the confluence.cfg.xml from a properly upgraded local home into the shared home. This will ensure that further fresh nodes will have an upgraded configuration.",

When clicking on \"Ask Question\", a row in CONTENT is inserted immediately with the following content (e.g. CONTENTID 3407882)\r\n{code:java}\r\ncontentid hibernateversion contenttype title                 lowertitle            version creator                          creationdate        \r\n--------- ---------------- ----------- --------------------- --------------------- ------- -------------------------------- ------------------- \r\n3407882   2                CUSTOM      ignorable draft title ignorable draft title 1       2c96b0bc61791f10016179204cb80000 2018-03-12 14:56:06 \r\n{code}\r\n2. Once the attachment is uploaded into the Question and the Question is Saved, the above row is eventually updated and deleted and a new row in CONTENT is created with a *brand new contentid* (e.g. 3407884)\r\n{code:java}\r\ncontentid hibernateversion contenttype title                lowertitle           version \r\n--------- ---------------- ----------- -------------------- -------------------- ------- \r\n3407885   1                ATTACHMENT  jstack_analysis3.png jstack_analysis3.png 1       \r\n3407884   2                CUSTOM      3407882              3407882              1       \r\n{code}\r\n3.

Right click on the broken image of the initial Confluence Question post and the ID after the attachments does not match to the above Question URL, e.g. image is linking to *3407893* and not the above *3407895*:\r\n{code:java}\r\nhttp://localhost:8090/download/attachments/3407893/jstack_analysis2.png?version=1&modificationDate=1520827628523&api=v2\r\n{code}\r\nh2. *Workaround 1 - for New Questions*\r\n\r\nThe following procedure is not a scalable workaround, but works.\r\n # Create a new question and save it _without_ any images in it.\r\n # Browse to that question again and *edit* it.\r\n # Upload the images required in the question and *save* it.\r\n\r\nh2. *Workaround 2 - for Existing Questions*\r\n # Open the _faulty_ Question.\r\n # *Right Click* on the broken image of the Question and *Open Image in a New Tab*.\r\n !right-click.png|thumbnail!\r\n # Match the URL of the _Question_ and the _New Tab_.
