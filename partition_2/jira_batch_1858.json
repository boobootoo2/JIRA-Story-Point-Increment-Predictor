      "description": "In an environment where there is thousands of pages, the PageNotFound action is extremely CPU intensive when the alternative page search hits many pages.\r\n\r\nOne such example to be considered is the space home page in an environment with thousands of spaces. If the home page of a space (EXAMPLE) is changed from \"Home\" to some other page and the URL {{mywiki/display/EXAMPLE/Home}} is visited, the alterative page search will hit every other \"Home\" page in all of the other spaces. From stack traces it appears that this operation will spend much time in the permission checking code path, triggering constant Hibernate session flushes to the DB.\r\n\r\nSuch operations may last tens of minutes in production environments and are often exacerbated when frustrated users constantly click refresh in an attempt to elicit a response from the application.\r\n\r\nThe options are to limit the number of alternatives we propose (useful in a general sense anyway, 2000 alternatives is not really helpful) and/or reduce the cost of permission checks in this case.\r\n\r\nh4. Patch available\r\n\r\nTo apply the patch (tested in Confluence 2.6 and later):\r\n\r\n1. Shut down Confluence\r\n2. Find the file {{alternativepages.vm}} in the pages/ directory of your Confluence application. Replace it with the [attached version|^alternativepages.vm].\r\n3. Find the file {{xwork.xml}} in the WEB-INF/classes/ directory of your Confluence application. Find the following lines in the file:\r\n\r\n{code:xml}\r\n<action name=\"pagenotfound\" class=\"com.atlassian.confluence.pages.actions.PageNotFoundAction\">\r\n    <result name=\"error\" type=\"dispatcher\">/fourohfour.action</result>\r\n    <result name=\"success\" type=\"velocity\">/pages/alternativepages.vm</result>\r\n</action>\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nChange the class in the first line to \"com.atlassian.confluence.core.ConfluenceActionSupport\" as shown below:\r\n\r\n{code:xml}\r\n<action name=\"pagenotfound\" class=\"com.atlassian.confluence.core.ConfluenceActionSupport\">\r\n    <result name=\"error\" type=\"dispatcher\">/fourohfour.action</result>\r\n    <result name=\"success\" type=\"velocity\">/pages/alternativepages.vm</result>\r\n</action>\r\n{code}\r\n\r\n4. Start Confluence again. The \"Page not found\" page should now load quickly, irrespective of how many spaces are in the instance.\r\n",

      "description": "Cache tuning should be more automated; when a cache size needs to increase, the cache admin page should provide a recommended value (and an easy way to enter it).\r\n\r\n{panel:title=Atlassian Status as of 18 Oct 2010|borderStyle=solid|borderColor=#3C78B5| titleBGColor=#3C78B5| bgColor=#E7F4FA}\r\nHi All,\r\nThanks for your votes for this issue. The Confluence team had spent some time attempting to provide a recommended cache setting in the admin user interface. After careful consideration, we have come to the conclusion that this is something we cannot implement. Despite our efforts, we came to understand there is no cheep, automated, accurate method to provide cache size recommendations.\r\n\r\nThere are several factors that input into providing an effective cache recommendation strategy. These are: \r\n* Memory size allocation\r\nSimply increasing the cache size could lead to more memory usage and an increase in full garbage collections performed by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). This could consequently lead to even worse performance.\r\n* Selective cache tuning\r\nSome memory caches are more important than others. Changing those that are used more extensively would provide more benefits. This should be done through a manual tuning process. \r\n* Other cache considerations \r\n** Size of an object stored inside a cache should be considered when recommending the size.\r\n** Cache entries expiry time.\r\n* The tuning process \r\nWhen changing cache it is important to check how the change affected hit/miss/usage - It's important to keep an eye on the performance of the application after the cache sizes have been changed (see [related documentation|http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Cache+Performance+Tuning#CachePerformanceTuning-CacheTuningFollowUp]) - there is no cheap way to automate this.\r\n\r\nWe recommend that all customers spend some time going through our [Cache Performance Tuning|http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Cache+Performance+Tuning] documentation and conduct a manual tuning process - there is no hard and fast rule to solve this problem.\r\n\r\nSherif Mansour\r\nAtlassian Product Management\r\n{panel}",

We already provide two different colors for our comments, so a highlight color that grabs your attention needs to really be ridiculously eye-catching.\r\n\r\nAnd, this is still not an ideal solution. For instance, I open a lot of new tabs through links - hopefully the fade effect would not kick in until I actually looked at that tab for the first time - often, I open the tab 'in the background' without immediately switch over to view it.\r\n\r\nBasically, I thought comment permalinks were broken - I thought we needed to provide a lot of whitespace at the bottom of each page, but I guess this is the new way to do it. I probably would not have been as confused if we really highlighted the comment I was heading to.\r\n\r\nUse Javascript to highlight selected comment on permalinks\r\nhttp://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONF-11903\r\n\r\nExample link:\r\nhttp://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Known+Issues+for+Resin+3.x?focusedCommentId=147187#comment-147187\r\n",

This feature is currently present in Mediawiki where you can create a Category and sub-categories. An example of this may be that we would like to label pages with CRM that have to do with CRM and when clicking this label see Microsoft Dynamics, Salesforce.com etc as sub-labels to this label. Vice Versa if you click on a MS Dynamics label you would want to see that it is a sub-label of CRM (and maybe also of Microsoft)\r\n\r\nThe user benefit lies in the fact that it allows to group labels into subsections.\r\n\r\nIt would also be nice if the output could be such that like in the Wikipedia it gets ordered alphabetically and shows all the subpages etc http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Cartilaginous_fishes",
