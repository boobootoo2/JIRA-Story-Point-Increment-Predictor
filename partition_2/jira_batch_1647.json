Also perhaps add a permission helper similar to the one in JIRA. \r\n\r\nh3.

I was going to raise it against Connect, but that's on EAN and I don't have access right now. Please feel free to move it if required.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n\r\n# Create a connect add-on listening to the \"page_updated\" webhook event.\r\n# Create a page which contains a link to another page.\r\n# Delete the page containing the link.\r\n# Edit and rename the other page (which was linked to by the now-deleted page)\r\n\r\n*bug* A webhook page_updated event is fired for the deleted page. Whilst this may seem useful, it just causes confusion as requesting the URI for the page returns a 404. \r\n\r\nCheers.\r\n\r\n~Dave",

If this is deemed a good suggestion could I ask that it's implemented for Jira Cloud.\r\nHopefully that's clear, cheers and good work!\r\n- A",

STATUS\r\nTest Case: Do something\r\nTest Case: Do something else\r\n\r\nLike if table of contents is being generated before everything has been fetched from JIRA.\r\n\r\nBut scrolling down the page, the actual content is displaying the title and status bar as supposed to. And if I edit the table of content settings, I see both title and status in the preview pane.\r\n\r\nh5. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Confluence connected to JIRA\r\n # Create/Edit a page\r\n # Add/create a JIRA issue on the page\r\n # Before this JIRA issue macro add a heading text eg: \"issue :\"\r\n # Add a Table of contents macro\r\n # Save the page\r\n\r\nh5.

Suggested Solution\r\n# The Office Connector should use the \"Content Type\" parameter instead of \"File Name\" in case end users change the File Name.

      "description": "h3. Summary\r\nWhen running Confluence 5.9.4 on MySQL 5.6.x, content indexing takes much longer (anywhere from 6-10 times as much time) compared to when running on MySQL 5.5.x or any other version of MySQL running on a Confluence version 5.8.x\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Environment\r\n* Ubuntu 14.04\r\n* Confluence 5.9.4\r\n* MySQL 5.6.27\r\n* MySQL 5.5.46\r\n* MySQL 5.6.21\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Stand up a Confluence 5.9.4\r\n# Fill it with content\r\n# Reindex (from scratch or otherwise)\r\n# Compare the amount it takes for the same content on Confluence 5.8.x or Confluence 5.9.4 with MySQL 5.5\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nIn a Confluence 5.9.4 instance running on MySQL 5.5, indexing from scratch takes about 9 seconds.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nWith this same amount of content (restored from backup) running on MySQL 5.6 the indexing takes around 1 minute. This is not such a significant change, but this occurs when indexing ~3500 pieces of content. We have multiple tickets with much larger instances in support reporting upwards of 40 hours to complete a re-index.\r\n\r\nh3.Workaround\r\nAt this point, we have been unable to find a workaround. The following has been attempted to see if it addresses the issue from a mysql bug: https://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=74739\r\n{quote}\r\nMeanwhile you have two options to avoid this problem: either disable query caching on server (by setting 'query_cache_size=0' or 'query_cache_type=OFF' http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/query-cache.html) or stop using cursor fetch in client (connection property 'useCursorFetch=false').\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nThis could be a regression of the following bug found immediately after upgrading to Confluence 5.9.x, but it seems like there is a more general issue with indexing and MySQl in Confluence 5.9: [CONF-39746|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONF-39746]\r\n\r\nOther related bugs have also been closed as support requests, but so far support has been unable to find a solution to this issue:\r\nhttps://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONF-40134\r\nhttps://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONF-40399",

Summary\r\n\r\nOn Confluence 5.9.x, when on a page that requires scrolling to see the end, the header bar (Confluence, Spaces, People, Browse, Create) stays along the top of the page when you scroll. However, when the Table of Contents Zone or\u00a0Roadmap Planner macro is added to the page, when scrolling, the bar does not stay along the top of the page but scrolls like the rest of the content. This has been verified to be the case when using the default them. When using the documentation theme, the header bar stays along the top of the screen when scrolling.\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Create a Confluence page with enough content that you will need to scroll to see the end of it\r\n # Scroll to the bottom and notice that the top bar stays locked to the top of the page\r\n # Add a Table of Contents Zone or\u00a0Roadmap Planner macro to the top of the page (you do not need to set any variables in the macro)\r\n # Scroll again, and notice that top bar is missing when scrolling down.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nWe would expect to see the top bar remain locked to the top regardless of the macros on the page\r\nh3.
