It would be nice to be able to import these requirements into Confluence and have those requirements turned into requirement blueprints. Given that we have over 1,000 requirements, manually creating 1,000 wiki pages based off the Requirements Blueprint is not realistic.\r\n\r\nPerhaps something similar to the Jira CSV importer. We could export all of our requirements into a CSV file and then import that CSV file into Confluence to have the Requirements Blueprint pages created for us. Even if you guys defined how the CSV file needed to look, it would still be far easier than manually entering in 1,000's of requirements by hand.\r\n{quote}",

For example this \"eye\" could turn red inside when page is being watched (kind of like the eye of Sauron from the LOTR)\r\n* Change label from _Watch_ to _Stop watching_ or _Manage watches_\r\n* Make a little check mark in the \"eye\" to indicate that user is watching the page and to encourage user to click there, in case he/she wants to stop watching that page\r\n* Have your UX engineer come up with even better solution\r\n\r\n_Disclaimer_ This is not support issue, as I already figured out, that:\r\n*In order to _stop watching_ I have to click _watch_* -- fortunately MS taught us, that in order to turn off computer you have to click _start_ ;)",

      "description": "I can type a certain amount of text into a Confluence Comment field in response to an article posted there. At a certain point near the bottom of the text area box I can no longer see what I type. Each press of the keyboard will jump the display of text down then auto-scroll back up so that I can't see what I typed. This forces me to use an external tool to type up my full comment and then copy/paste it into the Comment box in Confluence... a pain. At that point I still don't see all the text. If I arrow down to the text  that is out of sight, it jumps down for a split second then auto-scrolls back up, hiding the display of that lower text. If I Preview the comment I then see it's all there. I can post the comment and it's all there. But in edit mode, it's broken. There needs to be a scroll bar for oversized text content and a grow-box-size handle in the bottom right corner of the Comment text box to increase the box size displayed.\r\n\r\nI made a screen capture movie of this issue in action. Hope this helps illustrate the issue: http://screencast.com/t/r4e17crdacc\r\n\r\nh4. Workaround\r\nUninstall the \"Confluence browser fixes\" plugin or \"Confluence editor height fix\" plugin from versions that already have these fixes bundled.",

      "description": "In the attached screenshot 10.42.15, notice that the entire contents of the Attachments macro is underlined. This seems to happen if a Viewfile macro for a Word document is placed on the same page.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the \"browse for files\" link to upload a file in the Attachments macro no longer works. The file does seem to get uploaded, but the spinner remains on the page forever and the page never refreshes.\r\n\r\nTo reproduce:\r\n\r\n# Create a new page in a space\r\n# Add the testdoc.docx attachment (included here just in case, although it seems that any Word doc will do).\r\n# Edit the page again to add a viewfile macro.\r\n# Add an Attachments macro (or anything else) *after* the viewfile macro.\r\n# Notice that all of the text on the page is turned into a link with hover-underlines (see the attached underline.mov for an example).\r\n\r\nIt appears that the Word Viewfile macro somehow causes a new \"<a name=\"_GoBack\">' tag to be inserted around content on the page, including the attachments macro, even though that content resides outside of the frame of the viewfile macro. See screenshot 10.40.33.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned above, this also breaks the \"browse for files\" to upload feature in the Attachments macro. After attempting the upload, I get the following errors in the JS console (from com.atlassian.auiplugin:aui-header):\r\n\r\n{code}\r\nTypeError: menuItems[i] is undefined\r\nremaining -= menuItems[i].itemWidth;\r\nbatch.js (line 17127)\r\n\r\nTypeError: menuItems[i] is undefined\r\nremaining -= menuItems[i].itemWidth;\r\nbatch.js (line 17127)\r\n{code}",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFCLOUD-32867].\n  {panel}\n\nIn corporate settings with many non-public spaces it would be helpful to be able to delegate the management of group memberships to space admins in order to relieve confluence-admins of this task.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\nSpaces: X, Y\r\nGroups: X-admins, X-developers, X-users, Y-admins, Y-developers, Y-users\r\n\r\nAs it is, only confluence-admins can edit membership in all three groups.\r\n\r\nIt would be better to be able to assign membership-edit privileges regarding X-developers and X-users to the members of X-admins and those regarding Y-developers and Y-users to the members of Y-admins. \r\nThat way, confluence-admins would only need to create the groups and assign privileges once and the space admins could do the rest.\r\n\r\nIt is, of course, possible to assign individual privileges to users per space, but using groups is much superior when a lot of users are involved.",
