      "description": "h3. Issue Summary\r\n\r\nWhen a user writes JQL queries via Jira's Advanced Search, certain fields support autocompletion, which will suggest values as the user types.\r\n\r\nAs the user types, Jira will use a thread to perform a search against what they've typed and return possible results back to the user. In large or slow instances, and depending on the field being autocompleted, this functionality may not return quickly, and can take multiple seconds.\r\n\r\nIt is possible for the user to continue typing and end up making multiple autocompletion requests before the previous requests ever complete and return to the user. Jira will not cancel or otherwise terminate previously ongoing autocompletion threads in this case.\r\n\r\nThe instance may experience high CPU load and thread utilization if too many of these threads are working on these autocompletion tasks.\r\n\r\nExample fields include, but aren't limited to:\r\n* Epic Link\r\n* Components\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nThis issue is best reproduced in environments with high concurrent user load and activity, as well as large datasets. Otherwise, the issue may be partially induced in a stock Jira instance per the following:\r\n # Create a new Software project.\r\n # Using the [Data Generator for Jira|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1210725/data-generator-for-jira?hosting=server&tab=overview] (do not use in Production), create at least 100,000 Epics in this project.\r\n ** More will cause the issue to reproduce more severely, but will take more time to generate and index the issues.\r\n # Using the Issue Navigator, begin creating a new JQL query (i.e. \"Epic Link\" = )\r\n # Through multiple windows and perhaps through the help of other users, begin typing values into the Epic Link field. They do not have to be real values (i.e \"Epic Link\" = abcde...\"). Avoid typing more quickly than 2-3 characters/second.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nWhen users stop typing, suggested results will be shown.\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nObserve that CPU usage on the instance elevates, with the severity and duration depending on the frequency that new characters are being typed, and how many concurrent submissions are being made (i.e. other windows or users).\r\n\r\nThread Dumps taken during this time will show many threads consuming CPU with stack traces containing (in the below example, for Epic Links):\r\n{code:java}\r\n...\r\n\tat com.atlassian.greenhopper.service.issue.IssueDataServiceImpl.findImpl(IssueDataServiceImpl.java:183)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.greenhopper.service.issue.IssueDataServiceImpl.find(IssueDataServiceImpl.java:46)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.greenhopper.service.issuelink.EpicPickerServiceImpl.listEpicNames(EpicPickerServiceImpl.java:68)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.greenhopper.customfield.epiclink.EpicLinkClauseValueGenerator.getPossibleValues(EpicLinkClauseValueGenerator.java:27)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.jira.rest.internal.jql.FieldAndPredicateAutoCompleteResultGenerator.generateResults(FieldAndPredicateAutoCompleteResultGenerator.java:82)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.jira.rest.internal.jql.FieldAndPredicateAutoCompleteResultGenerator.getAutoCompleteResultsForField(FieldAndPredicateAutoCompleteResultGenerator.java:53)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.jira.rest.v2.search.SearchAutoCompleteResource.getFieldAutoCompleteForQueryString(SearchAutoCompleteResource.java:136)\r\n...\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nThe following HTTP requests can be seen made against the Access Logs, showing an individual GET request per character typed:\r\n{code}GET /node0/rest/api/2/jql/autocompletedata/suggestions?fieldName=component&fieldValue=c&_=1571178278998\r\nGET /node0/rest/api/2/jql/autocompletedata/suggestions?fieldName=component&fieldValue=ci&_=1571178279798\r\nGET /node0/rest/api/2/jql/autocompletedata/suggestions?fieldName=component&fieldValue=ciw&_=1571178280504\r\nGET /node0/rest/api/2/jql/autocompletedata/suggestions?fieldName=component&fieldValue=ciwo&_=1571178281180\r\nGET /node0/rest/api/2/jql/autocompletedata/suggestions?fieldName=component&fieldValue=ciwor&_=1571178281744\r\nGET /node0/rest/api/2/jql/autocompletedata/suggestions?fieldName=component&fieldValue=ciworh&_=1571178282340\r\nGET /node0/rest/api/2/jql/autocompletedata/suggestions?fieldName=component&fieldValue=ciworhe&_=1571178282909{code}\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nAvoid creating or editing multiple JQL queries at the same time, or in rapid succession.\r\n\r\nDisable *JQL Auto-complete* per *Administration >> System >> General Configuration*\r\n\r\nh3.

Issue Summary\r\nNo post-commit webhooks added to Bitbucket Cloud repositories after adding DVCS account to Jira as described in https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/connect-bitbucket-cloud-to-jira-server-applications-814208991.html#ConnectBitbucketCloudtoJiraSoftwareServer-DVCSConnectionnotes\r\nbq. When you link an account using the DVCS Connector, the connector adds a post-commit web hook to all the repositories owned by the account in Bitbucket Cloud. When a commit happens, the web hook passes commit information to the DVCS Connector for processing.\r\n\r\nh3. Environment\r\n* Jira Server 8.3, 8.0.2, 7.10 where tested, but probably all Jira Server is affected.\r\n* DVCS connector plugin v5.2.5, 5.1.3, 4.3.6 (latest compatible for Jira 7.x) all affected.\r\n* Bitbucket Cloud\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\nAdd a DVCS account owning some repositories in BBC to Jira following [Connect Bitbucket Cloud to Jira Software Server|https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/connect-bitbucket-cloud-to-jira-server-applications-814208991.html]\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nUnder Repository > Settings > Webhooks, there should be post-commit and pull-request webhook configurations added automatically with Jira endpoints, for each of the repositories owned by the DVCS account.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n* No webhooks to be seen under the DVCS account's repositories. However, POST and Pull Request POST Services (which are now deprecated in favor of Webhooks) are duly created under Repository > Settings > Services\r\n* The implication of this is that changes to Bitbucket Cloud don't get pushed to Jira immediately, leading to delayed updates to Jira's development panel only after the scheduled sync job pulls data from Bitbucket cloud.\r\n\r\nh3. Notes\r\n* Tested this with a Jira instance that wasn't accessible via the internet (not accessible from BBC), so not sure it's a factor. However, this didn't prevent the services from being created in BBC.\r\n* Considering the wide variety of Jira and DVCS add-on versions affected, this may well be a BBC bug.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\nManually creating the webhooks work, although you may hit into a bug with post-commit webhooks [JSWSERVER\\-16054: JIRA DVCS fails to update Commits sent by Bitbucket Cloud Webhooks|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSWSERVER-16054].",

Actual Results\r\nThe below exception is thrown in the atlassian-jira.log file:\r\n{noformat}\r\n2019-08-27 08:19:31,087 devstatus.dvcs.githube:thread-1234 ERROR xxxxx 499x10442828x9 xxxxx 128.161.38.16 /rest/dev-status/1.0/issue/detail [c.a.j.p.devstatus.provider.LoggingDecorator] Call 'repository details for [TEST-123]' has thrown an exception\r\njava.util.concurrent.RejectedExecutionException: Task com.google.common.util.concurrent.ListenableFutureTask@49e1f380 rejected from java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor@58ffde96[Running, pool size = 20, active threads = 20, queued tasks = 0, completed tasks = 150373]\r\nat java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor$AbortPolicy.rejectedExecution(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:2047)\r\nat java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.reject(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:823)\r\nat java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.execute(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:1369)\r\nat com.google.common.util.concurrent.MoreExecutors$ListeningDecorator.execute(MoreExecutors.java:550)\r\nat java.util.concurrent.AbstractExecutorService.invokeAll(AbstractExecutorService.java:277)\r\nat com.atlassian.jira.plugin.devstatus.provider.source.DrainableListeningExecutorServiceImpl.invokeAll(DrainableListeningExecutorServiceImpl.java:95)\r\nat com.atlassian.jira.plugin.devstatus.provider.source.dvcs.ChangesetDetailsFetcher.getChangesetsWithFileDetails(ChangesetDetailsFetcher.java:80)\r\nat com.atlassian.jira.plugin.devstatus.provider.source.dvcs.DvcsCommitDetailHelper.getCommitInfoMappedByRepository(DvcsCommitDetailHelper.java:78)\r\nat com.atlassian.jira.plugin.devstatus.provider.source.dvcs.DvcsDataProvider.lambda$getDetailDataFutureFor$0(DvcsDataProvider.java:160)\r\nat com.atlassian.jira.plugin.devstatus.provider.LoggingDecorator.call(LoggingDecorator.java:56)\r\nat java.util.concurrent.FutureTask.run(FutureTask.java:266)\r\nat java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.runWorker(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:1142)\r\nat java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor$Worker.run(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:617)\r\nat java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:745)\r\n{noformat}\r\n \r\nh3. Notes\r\n* When viewing the commits information, 1 DVCS thread is responsible to retrieve 1 commit. In most cases, the retrieval is quick enough that the same thread can be re-used.\r\n* The error is due to insufficient available threads when requested by the DVCS plugin. In this scenario, it uses all 20 of the default threads at a time and when trying to request for another failed.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\nIncrease the default DVCS threads \r\n# Edit {{jira-config.properties}}\r\n# Add the following property respective to the integration tools\r\n{code}\r\n// Bitbucket Cloud\r\njira.devstatus.dvcs.bitbucket.max.threads = 40\r\n// Github Enterprise\r\njira.devstatus.dvcs.githube.max.threads = 40\r\n// Github \r\njira.devstatus.dvcs.github.max.threads = 40\r\n{code}\r\n# Restarts Jira",

      "description": "h3. Issue Summary\r\n\r\nThe problem is tricky and manifests in quite a specific setup only. Here's a summary:\r\n * In NTFS there\u2019s ADS (Alternate Data Streams) mechanism that allows storing additional meta-data with files\r\n * The name of a stream is <original_file_name>:<stream_name>, e.g. {{foo.jar:Zone.Identifier}}\u00a0is a stream named\u00a0{{Zone.Identifier}}\u00a0appended to\u00a0\\{{foo.jar\u00a0}}file\r\n * When one unpacks content of a ZIP file downloaded from the Internet via IE, Windows attaches \u201cZone.Identifier\u201d stream to\u00a0_every_\u00a0extracted file; the stream stores info on original archive it comes from and the fact it was downloaded from the web. This is to show \u201cthis file was downloaded from the internet\u201d warnings\r\n * When a file is copied, it\u2019s copied along with all the streams\r\n * The streams are not (by default?) listed with original files. This is however not true when a *directory is mounted via NFS*, in which case they\u2019re listed just like regular files\r\n * *Jira, when upgrading, copies plugin files* from it\u2019s installation directory to shared home\r\n * The result is that *if shared home is mounted via NFS*, Jira plugin system that lists\u00a0{{installed-plugins}}\u00a0directory, finds not only original files, but also their additional streams and tries to load them, which causes exceptions like:\u00a0{{The artifact URI [file:////10.116.134.232/mnt/home/plugins/installed-plugins/jira-software-language-pack-en_US-7.6.15.v20190827165849.jar:Zone.Identifier|file:///10.116.134.232/mnt/home/plugins/installed-plugins/jira-software-language-pack-en_US-7.6.15.v20190827165849.jar:Zone.Identifier] is not a valid plugin artifact}}\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\nh3. Example\r\n\r\nHere's a real-life example. The initial state is Jira 8.3.2 DC installed on Windows box with shared home mounted via NFS. Adding {{/r}} switch to {{dir}} command causes it to show streams along with regular files and we can see there are none yet:\r\n{code:java}\r\nC:\\Users\\Administrator>dir /r

It will tell you that 2 issues were incomplete (I would expect to see 1)\r\n   # Choose to move the incomplete issues to a new sprint.\r\n   # See how there is only 1 issue showing in the backlog for the sprint.\r\n   # Look at ISSUE-1, see how it says it's in the new future sprint.\r\n   # Start the new sprint.\r\n   # See how the sprint report for the new sprint does not include ISSUE-1 in the list of issues added to the sprint.\r\n   # Check the Burndown Chart for the new sprint, ISSUE-1 is showing there.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nEither the unmapped issue would be considered added/not added to the sprint by both reports.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n# For the previous sprint:\r\n#* Burndown will show ISSUE-1 as issue completed\r\n#* Sprint report will show ISSUE-1 as removed from sprint\r\n# For current/next sprint\r\n#* The issue is considered to have been added to the sprint by the Burndown Chart.\r\n !Screen Shot 2019-09-02 at 11.20.34.png|thumbnail! \r\n#* The issue is considered to not have been added to the sprint by the Sprint Report.\r\n !Screen Shot 2019-09-02 at 12.23.36.png|thumbnail! \r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nMapping the statuses to a column (if the status is \"Cancelled\", map the status to the \"Done\" column).\r\n",

      "description": "h3. Issue Summary\r\nWhen clicking on the Boards link in the top navigation bar is showing a section of 'Recent Boards'.  In Jira Software 8.1.2 and higher (possibly other versions), it appears that this recent board list is no longer showing unique results to each user, but instead it looks like this resource is sharing the recent boards of other JSW users (provided that your account also has access to that same board).\r\n\r\nh3. Environment\r\nTested in 8.1.2, 8.2.3 and found this unexpected functionality happens.\r\n\r\nHowever when trying to replicate in 7.13.1, and 8.0.2, this behavior does not happen. In these older versions each user appears to have their own recent boards values that are only generated by the boards they view.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Create a new board (AAA project key for this example)\r\n# Create a second Jira software licensed user\r\n# Login as the newly created 2nd user, and then create a new board with board name (TEST)\r\n# In a new browser (incognito) login as user 1 again, then visit the Boards -> recent boards\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nIf user #1 has not recently been to board TEST, they should not see it in the recent list\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nUser #1 sees TEST board in the recent boards list\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Notes\r\nThis does not appear to leak names of ALL boards exactly.  Your user account can still only see in the recent boards entries that your account actually has permissions to see.  However this recent board should be bound to the currently logged in user and that is not what appears to be happening right now.\r\n !Screen Shot 2019-08-28 at 5.07.47 PM.png|thumbnail! \r\n^ shows recent boards of other users, not the current user right now\r\n\r\n\r\nh3.

      "description": "*Defining the problem:*\r\n\u00a0 1. It is not obvious to the user that entering multiple words in the Quick Search will not find the issue if each word is in a different standard text field. This is also an issue if one word is in a standard text field and the other is in a custom text field. The only reference to this behavior I saw is the blue information box in the NOT section of this page:\r\n\u00a0\r\n[https://confluence.atlassian.com/jiracoreserver073/search-syntax-for-text-fields-861257223.html#Searchsyntaxfortextfields-NOT]\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0 2. In order to search for multiple words, each of which can appear individually in separate standard (or custom) text fields, users must write JQL. There should be an easier way to tell the system to search for multiple words and include JIRAs where the words appear in separate text fields.\r\n\u00a0\r\n*Suggested solution:*\r\n\u00a0 If a user enters multiple words in the Quick Search, there should be a popup message (like the Smart Search popup) or an info box stating \"Only showing JIRAs for which all words appear in the same text field (all words appear in the Summary, or all words appear in the Comments, etc). To search for JIRAs without this restriction, click here\". Clicking the link should change the JQL from:\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 text ~ \"word1 word2\u00a0[... wordN]\"\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To:\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 text ~ \"word1\" AND text ~ \"word2\" ... AND text ~ \"wordN\"\r\n\u00a0\r\nAdditionally, there should be more robust options for doing a text search on the JIRA Search page. I would suggest there should be a \"Text Search\" button next to the Basic/Advanced link. This should show options (maybe right on the page, maybe via a popup, or maybe on a separate page altogether) to allow users to do a text search exactly the way they want, without having to enter it in the quick search and then click the link from the popup/info box I am suggesting. And also without having to type in all the JQL themselves. These options should allow users to enter multiple words and phrases, along with AND and OR options, including an option to turn on and off the \"all words and phrases must appear in the same text field\" functionality.\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0I feel that both the proposed popup/info box for the Quick Search, as well as the suggested \"Text Search\" button should be implemented. The Quick Search popup will inform users of how the Quick Search handles multiple words. And the \"Text Search\" button will provide a robust way to enter text search criteria so users can go directly there if they know the Quick Search won't do what they need.",

Note\r\n\r\nThe Dev status plugin has a guaranteed delivery feature, so in case Jira does not receive an update from Bitbucket and / or Fisheye for some time, Jira reaches out to Bitbucket and / or Fisheye and requests an update, to which Bitbucket and / or Fisheye replies with a list of issues that should be modified. Then, Jira reaches out again to seek all of the updates (which is what is failing in this case).\r\nh3. Workarounds\r\nh4. Option 1 (preferred)\r\n\r\nDecrease the fetch size on Jira side for guaranteed delivery, so even if some fetches induced by webhooks fail, guaranteed to deliver will deliver them later. For doing that:\r\n # On Bitbucket side add the following into {{bitbucket.properties}} file:\r\n{code:none|bgColor=#f4f5f7}\r\nplugin.jira-development-integration.issues.updated.max=200\r\n{code}\r\n\r\n # Adjust this number up and down to find the maximum fetch size that doesn't fail for your particular case, remembering that issue keys vary in length so there may be more or less output added to the URL.\r\n # Restart Bitbucket\r\n\r\nh4. Option 2 - change headers size\r\n\r\nIf there is a reverse-proxy in front of Bitbucket and / or Fisheye, follow both Step 1 and Step 2. Otherwise, follow only Step 1.\r\nh4. Step 1\r\n # On Bitbucket server, increase Tomcat header size by editing\u00a0{{bitbucket.properties}} and adding:\r\n{code:none|bgColor=#f4f5f7}\r\nserver.max-http-header-size=32768\r\n{code}\r\nOn Fisheye side, increase Jetty header size by setting the {{jetty.http.requestHeaderSize}} [system property|https://confluence.atlassian.com/fisheye/jvm-system-properties-960155689.html] with the value 32768.\r\n\r\n # Restart Bitbucket and / or Fisheye\r\n # This will change Tomcat's / Jetty's max HTTP header size to 32kb. If you still experience the error, you can set higher header size.\r\n\r\n*References:*\r\n * [Bitbucket Server config properties - Server Connectors|https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/bitbucket-server-config-properties-776640155.html#BitbucketServerconfigproperties-ServerConnectors]\r\n * [Fisheye JVM System Properties|https://confluence.atlassian.com/fisheye/jvm-system-properties-960155689.html]\r\n\r\n{panel:title=Please note:}\r\n(!) When implementing the workaround in Bitbucket, if you have\u00a0{{server.tomcat.max-http-header-size}}\u00a0defined in your {{bitbucket.properties}}, you should remove it and replace with\u00a0{{server.max-http-header-size}}.\r\n\r\nThe values are functionally the same, so to avoid conflicts, only one should be present. As\u00a0{{server.tomcat.max-http-header-size}}\u00a0will be removed in a future version of Bitbucket, we recommend you go with\u00a0{{server.max-http-header-size.}}\r\n{panel}\r\nh4. Step 2\r\n\r\nIf you are using a reverse-proxy, you also need to make sure to set request line limit to the same size (32768 or larger):\r\n * Apache: [http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/core.html#limitrequestline]\r\n * Nginx: [http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#large_client_header_buffers]",
