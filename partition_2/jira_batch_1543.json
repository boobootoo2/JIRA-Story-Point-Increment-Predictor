Problem\r\n\r\nWhen accessing a header/anchor on a page from a Table of Contents Macro, the header title will be either cropped by the Confluence top bar menu or hidden by the Confluence white floating banner menu.\r\nh3. Environment\r\n\r\nWe can reproduce the issue locally on Confluence Server latest version v7.3.4 and also tried on v7.2.0 and Confluence Data Center v6.15.7.\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nCreate a new page that contains:\r\n - a Table of contents at the top of the page\r\n - some headers h4: the number of sections has to be big enough so that the pages cannot be displayed in a single instance in the web browser. You have to scroll up or down to access\u00a0\r\n - a Table of contents at the bottom of the page\r\n - publish/update the page\r\n - Scenario1: access some of the headers section/anchors via the top ToC Macro. The header title will be cropped/not visible due to the blue/top menu banner.\r\n - Scenario2: access some of the headers section/anchors from the bottom ToC Macro. The header title will be hidden by the floating/white banner.\r\n\r\nTo illustrate the 2 scenarios you will find attached, a video where I show how I reproduce the issue on my *Chrome Version 80.0.3987.149 (Official Build) (64-bit)*\u00a0with a local Confluence v7.3.4 Server instance. You will also find attached an example of page content in storage format (to be imported via source editor plugin) to speed-up the testing.\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nWhen accessing a section from a Table of Contents Macro, the title of the section that is accessed should always be displayed/visible at the top of the page. We should offset the blue/top menu banner and the floating/white banner in Confluence in all cases.\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nPlease find the recording attached.\r\n \u00a0\r\nh3.

Not only does this put that bullet at the wrong level, it also means all later bullets are shifted by one level. Add this up over a long series of meeting notes, and the end result looks very little like the original. I have attached a picture showing the issue.

      "description": "We are taking the inspiration from this link: [https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/dc-deployments-automation] to automate both server and DC installations of Atlasssian applications. This has worked really well with JIRA but we are having some issues with confluence mainly because of the way information are stored in the file system. JIRA for example does not store the information like server id, license information and cluster details in the dbconfig.xml. Whereas confluence has all those information in the confluence.cfg.xml.\u00a0\r\n\r\nFor that reason, we where able to automate the installation of JIRA server and DC easily. We were also able to automate the installation of confluence server with a special trick to not copy the [confluence.cfg.xml|https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/dc-deployments-automation/src/master/roles/confluence_config/templates/confluence.cfg.xml.j2] file on every build of our code. Because a copy of the template without license and server id will assume a fresh install.\r\n\r\nWhen doing the server installation,\u00a0\r\n{code:java}\r\n <?xml version=\"1.0\"

Problem Definition\r\nCustomers may face e-mail storms from Confluence due to notifications being sent for pages and blogs watched.\r\nAs Confluence generates one individual e-mail for each user, this can escalate to several users being notified for several pages, causing a heavy load on e-mail servers.\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\nBulk e-mail notifications so that instead of one message per user, it could send one message for the total watchers or grouping them for configurable number if the watcher list is large, for instance, one message for each 30 watchers. (BCC them?)\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\nNone at the moment, but you can consider:\r\n* Reducing the events notified:\r\n[How to globally disable e-mail notifications with page content|https://confluence.atlassian.com/confkb/how-to-globally-disable-e-mail-notifications-with-page-content-718670714.html]\r\n* Increasing the time for batching e-mails:\r\n[Email Notifications|https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/email-notifications-145162.html?_ga=2.217851798.1001520385.1583151685-296208751.1582325698]",

      "description": "h3. Issue Summary\r\n\r\nDuring a group deletion, Confluence retrieves all space permissions (for each space) from DB, and then filters them by that group. \r\n Eventually, it means that Confluence loads permissions for all spaces from DB. \r\n In the case of a Data Center instance, it takes even longer because all this information is loaded to the distributed cache.\r\n In broad terms, that explains why it may take so much time to confirm the deletion of a group: Confluence is calculating space permissions prior to the deletion. Screenshot below.\r\n The deletion itself is pretty fast. But depending on the number of spaces and groups an environment has, the space permissions calculations can take from several seconds to several minutes.\r\n\r\n!screenshot-1.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\n\r\n*Environment*\r\n\r\nObserved in these versions:\r\n * Confluence 6.13.4, 6.13.6,\u00a0but this is also observable in any 6.x versions.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n*Scenario 1 (single space/group)*\r\n # install a vanilla instance\r\n # create a sample space, named SpaceA\r\n # create a sample group, named GroupA\r\n # create space permission in SpaceA related to GroupA\r\n # flush Cache to ensure data will be loaded from DB\r\n # now go to *Confluence Administration > General Configuration > Groups*\r\n # delete GroupA\r\n ** it will show a confirmation screen, loading all the spaces permissions that are related to this group\r\n ** this time will load pretty fast because there are just one space and one group\r\n ** in a controlled test, this scenario took 600ms to complete\r\n # cancel the deletion\r\n\r\n*Scenario 2 (multiple spaces / single group)*\r\n This is not a real scenario but we tested it to illustrate an increase in complexity. \r\n However, it's still far from a customer real environment due to scalability (customers tend to have thousands of spaces/groups instead of hundreds)\r\n # install a vanilla instance\r\n # create 100 spaces, named Space1 \\{2,3,4 etc}\r\n # create a sample group, named Group1\r\n # create space permission in each Space(N) related to Group1\r\n # flush Cache to ensure data will be loaded from DB\r\n # now go to *Confluence Administration > General Configuration > Groups*\r\n # delete Group1\r\n ** it will show a confirmation screen, loading all the spaces permissions that are related to this group\r\n ** this time it may take a little longer due to space permissions calculations showing the behavior\r\n ** in a controlled test, this scenario took 2.1 secs to complete\r\n # cancel the deletion\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n * Scenario 2\r\n ** The group deletion confirmation screen to load without any further delay.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n * Scenario 2\r\n ** The group deletion confirmation screen took a longer time than Scenario 1 due to space permissions calculations.\r\n (!) This only gets worse the more spaces/groups you add to the scenario (we tested 100 spaces related to 100 groups and it took around 4.5 seconds)\r\n In a real situation with a prod environment from a customer, ~6600 groups related to ~790 spaces, it takes +2 minutes to complete the space permissions calculations.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nSince the problem lies in the space permissions calculations, you can bypass it and go straight to the actual group deletion action, using the RPC-API SOAP call. \r\n Example below.\r\n For reference: [Confluence XML RPC and SOAP APIs|https://developer.atlassian.com/server/confluence/confluence-xml-rpc-and-soap-apis/]\r\n{code:bash}\r\n#!/bin/bash\r\n\r\nADMIN_USRNAME=<adminuser>\r\nADMIN_USRPWD=<adminpwd>\r\nCONFLUENCE_BASE_URL=\"http://<host>/confluence\"\r\nGROUP_NAME=<group_name>\r\nAPI_METHOD=removeGroup\r\n\r\necho \"Deleting group ${GROUP_NAME} ...\"\r\ncurl \\\r\n    --user $ADMIN_USRNAME:$ADMIN_USRPWD \\\r\n    -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\r\n    -H \"Accept: application/json\" \\\r\n    -X POST \\\r\n    -d '{ \"jsonrpc\" : \"2.0\", \"method\" : \"'${API_METHOD}'\", \"params\" : [\"'${GROUP_NAME}'\", \"\"], \"id\": 7 }' \\\r\n    ${CONFLUENCE_BASE_URL}/rpc/json-rpc/confluenceservice-v2?os_authType=basic 2>/dev/null | jq -r '.'\r\n{code}",

Based on the [documentation|https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/database-jdbc-drivers-171742.html], it is recommended to use the bundled Type 4 JDBC driver since it is the driver version that has been tested with Confluence. \r\n\r\nAs an example faced by a user, updating the JDBC driver version causes Confluence to not start up with the new JDBC driver because Windows authentication to the SQL Server is not working. However, it is possible to start Confluence with the new version when the {{.dll}} was renamed to the old name as {{sqljdbc_auth.dll}}. In regards to this, it may be seen that Confluence only recognizes the old naming of the {{.dll}} file. Confluence should be able to recognize the {{.dll}} file that is stored in {{<confluence-install>/confluence/WEB-INF/lib}} without the change of the naming.\r\n\r\nAs a suggestion, Confluence should be able to support the newer version of JDBC drivers.",
