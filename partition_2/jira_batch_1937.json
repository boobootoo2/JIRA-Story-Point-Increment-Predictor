[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFCLOUD-3191].\r\n{panel}\r\nIt'd be really very handy to be able to duplicate a space. Export/import only works on 1 space I think (it seems to have lots of integer ids in there so I dare not try exporting, twiddling things and reimporting).\r\n\r\nWhat would be really nice would be a 'copy space' option where you can duplicate an entire space as a different name/key.\r\n\r\ne.g. setting up projects at codehaus; it'd be good to use an existing space as a base, then copy the entire thing, then after that either export/import to search/replace, or just manually modify pages after that.\u00a0\r\n{panel:title=Atlassian status as of November 15, 2018|borderStyle=solid|borderColor=#3c78b5|titleBGColor=#3c78b5|bgColor=#e7f4fa}\r\nHi all,\r\n\r\nThanks for all your votes and comments on this suggestion.\r\n\r\nAs previously mentioned, we fully appreciate the value copying a space will bring. This is something we\u2019d ideally like to implement in the future, but it's not currently on our roadmap for the next 12 months. . We\u2019re instead focusing on bringing you a new search experience, and are investigating improvements to permissions.\r\n\r\nFor more context on this, take a read of the Community blog\u00a0[A renewed approach to highly voted Server suggestions for Jira and Confluence|https://community.atlassian.com/t5/Jira-articles/A-renewed-approach-to-highly-voted-Server-suggestions-for-Jira/ba-p/688117].\r\n\r\nThere are multiple workarounds available for this issue though - we recommend reading through the related\u00a0[Confluence documentation|https://confluence.atlassian.com/confkb/how-to-copy-or-rename-a-space-in-confluence-169578.html]\u00a0for more information.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, as many of you are aware, we implemented the related feature, copy page hierarchy, in 6.0. We hope that you\u2019ll be able to utilize this functionality as an alternative workaround in the meantime.\r\n\r\nI apologise for the disappointment and will ensure we provide you with an update on this feature request within the next 12 months.\r\n\r\nBest\r\n Jenny Millman | Product Manager - Confluence Server\r\n{panel}",

There were many different types of exceptions appearing on the console, and one of them mentioned a concurrency error.

      "description": "I want to use Confluence for communication on a wide range of ongoing projects.  One useful feature would be to have a capability for a \"management dashboard\" where, on a single page, there would be some visible summary information from many pages deeper in the hierarchy.  It seems to me that you have many of the building blocks to do something like this, and just need a few missing pieces to be able to offer a pretty cool new capability.  (And maybe it can be done with what I have and I just don't know how to use it!)\n\nMy vision is to have a new macro that would function a lot like the tasklist macro, except that I want \"radio button\" like behavior instead of checkboxes.  So I would expect the macro to look something like this:\n\n{radiobutton:Project Status}\nOn hold\nIn progress, high risk\nIn progress, normal risk\nIn progress, low risk\nComplete\n{radiobutton}\n\nAs well as presenting the common radio button user experience, this macro would render in XML as the title of the page it came from and the current selected button.  \n\nThen, in the high level management dashboard, there would be a RSS macro with a query string appropriate to \"filter\" just the \"Project Status\" content from the Confluence space in question.  So the management dashboard could provide a very simplistic summary of all the projects in the Confluence space.\n\nI know this is pretty sketchy, and probably needs a lot of refinement.  But it seems like something like this might be pretty easy to create in your product and it might have a lot of market appeal.\n\nAnother possible design might use a more specific \"status\" macro:\n\n{statusreport:Project Status}\nOn hold\nIn progress, high risk\nIn progress, normal risk\nIn progress, low risk\nComplete\n{statusreport}\n\nAnd the statusreport macro might generate a user interface with the radio buttons and a text \"log\" for explanatory detail; the statusreport could render XML that included the page title, the radio button selection, and the most recent \"log\" entry.  Again, the management \"dashboard\" page would use an RSS macro to harvest the statusreports from an unknown number of project pages deep in the space.",
