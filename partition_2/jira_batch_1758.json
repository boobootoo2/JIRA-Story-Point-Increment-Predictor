XSS vulnerabilities allow an attacker to embed their own JavaScript into a Confluence page.

This patch has also been tested against Confluence 3.5.16, and should work for all Confluence 3.5.x releases. However, as with any patch, this should be tested thoroughly first, and initially monitored after being installed in production.\r\n\r\nTo install:\r\n\r\n1. Download the attached zip file\r\n2. Shutdown Confluence\r\n3. Move the zip file <installation-directory>/confluence/WEB-INF/classes\r\n4. Extract the zip file\r\n5. Verify that the file <installation-directory>/confluence/WEB-INF/classes/com/atlassian/confluence/servlet/ConfluenceVelocityServlet.class exists\r\n6.

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFCLOUD-26306].\n  {panel}\n\nAs a wiki administrator, I would like an option for my users to be able to select permission schemas to restrict pages to their particular workgroup during page creation. \r\n\r\nThe reason this feature would be useful is incorrectly defined permissions at page creation can cause delays and problems as an administrator needs to manually fix the permissions, and with a large user base incorrect permission definition can be a problem that occurs regularly and is time consuming to resolve.\r\n\r\nSimplifying the process of assigning page permissions by providing pre-defined schemas would help to resolve this problem.",
