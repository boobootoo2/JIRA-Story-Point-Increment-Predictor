Reviewing it as per my original report, it seems like:\r\n\r\nselect * from cru_recipient where cru_email in (1, 2)\r\n\r\nIn our environment, we have:\r\n\r\ncrucible=# select cru_email, count(1) from cru_recipient group by cru_email;\r\ncru_email | count\r\n----------+-------\r\n1 | 46\r\n3 | 127346\r\n0 | 9465\r\n(3 rows)\r\n\r\nAs per the original report, due to the query being prepared - PostgreSQL prepares a conservative plan that makes no assumption about the selectivity of the cru_email field. As a result, the query is particular slowly. It should only scan 46 rows based on selectivity - but without knowledge of selectivity, it does a sequential scan through the 127k rows as well.\r\n\r\nWhy would it do this query repeatedly?\r\n\r\nNote that this is just one specific symptom. Crucible is still slow for us, although it is now \"usable\".\r\n\r\nIf I click around through a review against a quad-core Intel Xeon X3330 2.66 Ghz, 4 Gbytes of 800 Mhz RAM, with me being the only user on the system, and I use Firebug - I see that it often makes two or more AJAX calls. In one particular case - clicking on a file in a review, it issues 2 or more AJAX requests, with each taking 200+ milliseconds to complete. Result is that for what should be a simple update - it takes 0.5 seconds to complete. This is a quite noticeable lag.\r\n{quote}",
