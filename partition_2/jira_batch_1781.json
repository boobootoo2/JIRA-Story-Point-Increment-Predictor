Unsupported Workaround\r\n\r\n*Disclaimer: We can't provide any support if you use this method and run into any issues*\r\n\r\nAs seen in the comments, some customers have had success in getting this working by ensuring all links are in the following format:\r\n\r\n# Type \"File:///\" not \"File://\"\r\n# use \"/\" and not \"\\\" for the path (for exampe \"file:///J:/Projects/...\"\r\n# Alternatively you can write \"file://server/folder/Projects...\" instead of \"file:///J:/Projects/...\"\r\n\r\nThis was achieved by exporting to XML, running search/replace over it, and then importing it back.",

      "description": "h3.Affected Platforms\r\nJira 4.4, Confluence 4.0\r\n\r\nh3.Symptoms\r\nSome JIRA Directory users in Confluence might occasionally complain that they encounter the \"Not Permitted\" error while using Confluence, *occasionally*. You will notice this happening after a scheduled/manual sync of JIRA directory in Confluence. \r\n\r\nh3.Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Create an internal user in JIRA (in JIRA Internal Directory) that would have a similar user name with a user in Crowd (Make sure the user in Crowd has multiple group memberships while the user in JIRA only has membership with jira-users group). (Let's call the 2 users \"DuplicatedUsers\")\r\n# Add the Crowd directory in JIRA.\r\n# Sync the Crowd directory (Crowd users will be fetched into JIRA, including the user with the same username as the user in the JIRA internal directory) \r\n# Add the JIRA user directory to Confluence\r\n# Sync the JIRA user directory in Confluence (Notice that only one of the \"DuplicatedUsers\" is synced, but the group memberships are aggregated - DuplicatedUsers would be member of jira-users, as well as all the groups that it is member of in Crowd).\r\n# Try to sync the JIRA directory again, notice that all group memberships except jira-users is gone (and sometimes, even jira-users is gone as well, so zero group memberships).\r\n# Sync the JIRA directory again, and notice that the group memberships are all back again\r\nNotice the logs would have something like this:\r\n{code}\r\n2011-10-11 20:24:47,726 ERROR [scheduler_Worker-7] [crowd.embedded.hibernate2.HibernateMembershipDao] addAllUsersToGroup The following group memberships could not be processed:\r\n2011-10-11 20:24:47,726 ERROR [scheduler_Worker-7] [crowd.embedded.hibernate2.HibernateMembershipDao] addAllUsersToGroup horatio nelson into jira-users\r\n2011-10-11 20:24:47,726 ERROR [scheduler_Worker-7] [crowd.embedded.hibernate2.HibernateMembershipDao] addAllUsersToGroup Please try to resolve any errors with these users and groups, and try again.\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nh3.Cause\r\nAffected users appear twice in JIRA; one in the JIRA internal directory, and one in external user management such as Crowd. During sync of the JIRA directory in Confluence, Confluence pulls one user, and aggregates the group memberships of the user from both directories in JIRA (Jira Internal Dir, and Crowd). The aggregation causes constraint violation in Confluence's database, and Confluence will then discard the group membership altogether during synchronization. Since the group membership is discarded in one sync, the next sync will re-add the membership again. Hence, the symptoms described above\r\n\r\nh3.Expected Result\r\nConfluence only pulls one user from the higher priority directory in JIRA. The group memberships should not be aggregated, but should only follow the group memberships defined in the higher priority directory. \r\n\r\nh3.Workaround\r\n# Delete the duplicate users by first disabling the Crowd directory (in JIRA)\r\n# Browse for the duplicate Jira internal directory users, then remove them one by one\r\n# Re-enable the Crowd directory in JIRA\r\n# Browse to {{Confluence Admin >> User Directories}}\r\n# Disable the JIRA directory\r\n# Add another JIRA directory with similar settings (but different names)\r\n# Sync the new JIRA directory",
