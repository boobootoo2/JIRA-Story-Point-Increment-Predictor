However, other operations that use labels don't generally work for metadata tags, particularly the wide array of plugins, because attempting to add a metadata tag via the labeling UI evokes a complaint that the colon separator is an illegal character.  Strictly speaking, of course, this isn't true, because labels can be prefixed with \"my:\" without complaint.\r\n\r\nIf the metadata plugin were to use the labeling subsystem's storage space, and filter (as it does today) values that have syntactic elements used for metadata tags, then metadata tags could take advantage of all the plugin support that today is being offered for labels, which are, after all, just one simple subset of metadata tags.  Thus, instead of replicating all of the labeling plugins' enhancements in the metadata plugin (such as one thing that I really want right now, which is the ability to put metadata on a page without having to invoke the plugin on the page itself), it comes for free as a part of labeling.\r\n\r\nIf the name field of the name/value pair could be qualified with an XML namespace, this would open vast possibilities, but it really deserves its own issue, which will be moot unless this basic idea is approved.",

      "description": "A response template goes through several stages of decoration, using the #applyDecorator macro specifying a template name.  This goes through the sitemesh decorator logic and eventually ends up in the class loading implementation to find the decoration template.  Confluence implements the plugin classloaders to scan through the plugins to find the actual resource that satisfies this name.\r\n\r\nThis involves scanning each plugin jar for the required template resource.  If there are a lot of plugins, this can take quite some time.\r\n\r\nThe three main problems with this implementation are:\r\n# During the scan, the individual plugin class loaders (JarClassLoader) is synchronized, meaning *all other plugin resource or class loading is executed sequentially*\r\n# The result is not cached, or recorded in any way, meaning this will happen *multiple times on every request*\r\n# The surrounding DynamicPluginResourceLoader that velocity uses to bridge to the DefaultPluginManager, is synchronized as well, meaning *all plugin resource loading that originates from velocity is executed sequentially*\r\n\r\nA typical stack trace showing this behavior:\r\n\r\n{noformat}\r\n\"http-127.0.0.1-48080-Processor3\" daemon prio=5 tid=0x011248e8 nid=0x23 runnable [0xb7e7c000..0xb7e7fc28]\r\n  - locked <0xb91ac448> (a java.util.zip.Inflater)\r\n  ...\r\n  at java.util.jar.JarInputStream.getNextEntry(JarInputStream.java:114)\r\n  at com.atlassian.plugin.loaders.classloading.JarClassLoader$InnerJar.scanForPrefixes(JarClassLoader.java:53)\r\n  ...\r\n  at com.atlassian.plugin.loaders.classloading.JarClassLoader.getFile(JarClassLoader.java:190)\r\n  - locked <0xc18644e0> (a com.atlassian.plugin.loaders.classloading.JarClassLoader)\r\n  at com.atlassian.plugin.loaders.classloading.PluginsClassLoader.findResource(PluginsClassLoader.java:79)\r\n  at com.atlassian.plugin.loaders.classloading.PluginsClassLoader.getResource(PluginsClassLoader.java:149)\r\n  at java.lang.ClassLoader.getResourceAsStream(ClassLoader.java:995)\r\n  at com.atlassian.plugin.impl.DynamicPlugin.getResourceAsStream(DynamicPlugin.java:33)\r\n  at com.atlassian.plugin.DefaultPluginManager.getDynamicResourceAsStream(DefaultPluginManager.java:676)\r\n  ...  \r\n  at com.atlassian.confluence.setup.velocity.DynamicPluginResourceLoader.getResourceStream(DynamicPluginResourceLoader.java:23)\r\n  - locked <0xbd47f420> (a com.atlassian.confluence.setup.velocity.DynamicPluginResourceLoader)\r\n  at org.apache.velocity.Template.process(Template.java:136)\r\n  at org.apache.velocity.runtime.resource.ResourceManagerImpl.loadResource(ResourceManagerImpl.java:466)\r\n  ...  \r\n  at com.atlassian.confluence.setup.sitemesh.ConfluenceSpaceDecoratorMapper.getDecorator(ConfluenceSpaceDecoratorMapper.java:57)\r\n  ...\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

You can only use a page title once in the project... e.g. we have different teams... but I can 't use Meeting Minutes as page title for all\r\nUser (8:01:15 AM):  I have to say: Arch Meeting Minutes, Dev Meeting Minutes...\r\nTim Colson (8:01:17 AM):  yeah, that is true, and is a problem.\r\nUser (8:01:35 AM):  no elegant workaround, huh?\r\nTim Colson (8:01:51 AM):  I tried to convince the Atlassian folks to create name spaces.. but not enough people supported the idea.\r\nTim Colson (8:02:05 AM):  My proposal was that a page would have a fully qual'd name that inclued it's parents.\r\nTim Colson (8:02:23 AM):  so ANC:Arch:Meeting and ANC:Dev:Meeting\r\nTim Colson (8:02:29 AM):  but only display the \"last part\"\r\nUser (8:02:44 AM):  Right... that would make sense.\r\n\r\nI brought this topic up on the list a while ago... but as I said in the IM conversation above, it didn't seem to gain ground. ;-)\r\n\r\nMy proposal: behind the scenes, store pages with a fully qualified name which includes the parent(s), but only display the \"last part\" in the Title and Location.\r\n\r\nPage names might be-\r\n\"ANC>Architecture>20050105 Meeting\"\r\n\"ANC>Development>20050105 Meeting\"\r\n\r\nWhere ANC is the space, Architecture and Development are pages, BOTH of them have a child \"20050105 Meeting\" page -- i.e. two pages with the same \"name\".\r\n\r\nIf somebody searched for \"20050105 Meeting\" -- they would get both pages, but would be shown the heirarchy so they could pick the \"correct\" one.\r\n\r\nAnd in the Location, instead of this-\r\nLocation:Dashboard>ANC>Pages>Architecture>20050105 Architecture Meeting\r\nLocation:Dashboard>ANC>Pages>Development>20050105 Development Meeting\r\n\r\nWe'd have this-\r\nLocation:Dashboard>ANC>Pages>Architecture>20050105 Meeting\r\nLocation:Dashboard>ANC>Pages>Development>20050105 Meeting\r\n \r\nLastly -- links would need a fully qual'd name -- only if there is more than one \"20050105 Meeting\" page, perhaps using \">\" as a divider\r\n\r\n[Architecture>20050105 Meeting]\r\nhttp://server/confluence/display/ANC/Architecture%3E20050105+Meeting\r\n\r\nIf someone used the unqualified name [20050105 Meeting] -- two things could happen..\r\n1) saving the page would validate, and show the link as an error -- and give the two(or more) possible fully qual'd alternatives.\r\n2) when clicking on the link, the user could be prompted, \"The link you clicked is ambiguous, because there are more than one page with that name. Select the one you would like below:\" (and then list the pages)\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nThis proposal would probably be short-term PAIN to implement by Atlassian folks, but it would vastly improve navigation, site organization, and even pretty up PDF/HTML exports of page heirarchies. \r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nTimo\r\n",

We could do this via styles (e.g. a different heading colour for archive spaces) or other means.\r\n# Doc title (as well as page title) prominent on every page. Configurable. Not necessarily the same as the space name.\r\n# Styling to mark the space as a doc space e.g. on CAC to differentiate documentation spaces from discussion spaces.\r\n\r\nMany of the above options should be optional.

Confluence does not.\r\n\r\nA few years ago, this might have been a \"nice to have\" feature, but as more workers are upgrading to Web browser-capable BlackBerry devices that give them access to e-mail notifications on updates to their watched Confluence pages or on responses to their Confluence comments, they want to be able to see those changes or respond back to those comments without having to be logged back into their computers.\r\n\r\nConfluence sites are visible via mobile device browsers, but they aren't very navigable, and they are nearly impossible to edit or comment on.\r\n\r\nThe existing WAP plugin for Confluence is a start, but it's really unusable.  Showing the first few words of a page and then bundling the rest up as a link to the wiki markup language source is not my idea of user-friendly.\r\n\r\nIf Traction can provide a usable WAP interface to their Enterprise Wiki, I'm hoping we can, too.\r\n",

The idea is the Confluence server can receive emails, and depending on the email address, archive each email to the appropriate space.  An email mailed to MyPersonalSpace-archive@confluence-server would be archived in the space MyPersonalSpace.  In this way, users could selectively archive specific mails by CC'ing the email address for the appropriate space.  This could be used to complement the current POP based archiving, or it could be used as a more lightweight alternative.\r\n\r\nA related mechanism could allow you to post an email as a page to a space.  For example, MyPersonalSpace-page@confluence-server would create a page based on the contents of the email.  This would be a great mechanism if you know you're sending an email to a mailing list with important information that you know will need to be referenced later.\r\n\r\nMyPersonalSpace-news@confluence-server would add a news item.

The information provided in CSP-8957 was very helpful, but I though it might be good to suggest an enhancement to the app to handle some of this if possible. If nothing else, we may learn a new way to customize confluence by logging this. :)\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\nGary",

This seems very neat and efficient, yet we do not implement a specific error checking on individual entries. ( *not always* )\r\n\r\nHence, if in this example the {{confluencedb.properties}} file is corrupted for whatever reason (values missing), there is no notification provided of this corruption for the user. Instead you see a similar error as per the screenshot.\r\n\r\nSay the 'version' tag is missing? Or is set to a 'string' ? \r\n{noformat}\r\n  Properties p = new Properties();\r\n  String propertiesPath = homeLocator.getHomePath() + \"/database/confluencedb.properties\";\r\n  p.load(new FileInputStream(new File(propertiesPath)));\r\n\r\n  String versionString = p.getProperty(\"version\");\r\n\r\n  versionString = versionString.substring(0, versionString.indexOf('.') + 2);\r\n  double currentVersion = Double.parseDouble(versionString);\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nThis would generate a run time NPE exception which is not indicative to customer re the actual error in the {{confluencedb.properties}} file.\r\n\r\nProposed Solution:\r\n* Use the .properties file parser to create a Properties object (as presently implemented)\r\n* Add specific set of classes to handle each individual Properties objects (hash tables of the actual .properties file)\r\n* Allow for i18n - create a separate or common error_message.properties files that would contain a specific set of customised exception messages (error message lib)\r\n* Allow for resolving some of the corrupted configuration issues by correcting the invalid/null values and notifying the users about it too\r\n\r\nHence in the example above I could nicely use the lets call it {{ConfluenceDBPropertiesHandler.class}} - can think of a better name :-)\r\n\r\n...pseudocode...\r\n{noformat} \r\n-  create a new ConfluenceDBPropertiesHandler  call it 'handler'\r\n-  pass the confluencedb.properties files to it\r\n-  let it process it (notify errors, i18n, default corrective values ...)\r\n-  call a valid() function on it or similar to get the status of the properties file (corrections would be performed within that class)\r\n- if all good - proceed ... \r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nHence if the version tag is missing, I could add it and print out notification of the error and correction too.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n              ",

Currently there is no way that the People Directory can be overridden with our own action.\r\n\r\nWhat we need is a way to specify that actions in our plugins are \"alternate\" versions of existing actions (and specifically which actions). Note: It's possible that one action in our plugin could be used to replace several standard actions.\r\n\r\nIn the admin area, a site admin could then display a list of all inbuilt actions that support overriding and against each action there would be a drop-down list showing the Confluence standard action (default selection) and a list of any other alternate actions available in the installed plugins.  The admin would simply select the desired replacement from the list and any requests to the inbuilt action would then be sent directly to the alternate version.\r\n\r\nShould the third party plugin be uninstalled or otherwise become unavailable, Confluence would fall back to the original Confluence version of the action until the plugin is restored or an admin chooses an action from a different plugin.\r\n\r\nAdaptavist have a growing need to replace the following items:\r\n\r\n* People directory\r\n* Create space screen\r\n* User profile (just about everything in here LOL)\r\n* Browse space - specifically the tree, recently updated, index actions\r\n\r\nThere will be lots of others, but those listed above are our main priorities. For example, if we can take over the personal profile, we'll be able to use our Bubbles Plugin to create this very quickly indeed: http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DEVNET/Personal+Homepage\r\n\r\nWe've got everything lined up and are ready to rumble, but not being able to override those default actions is preventing us from doing anything more than cludgy hacks. We want the personal profile to be the \"personal home page\" - a dashboard for the user.\r\n\r\nOn other projects we've tried making the home page of the personal space in to this sort of dashboard but it didn't work well as users then get very confused between their personal profile, their personal space and their personal \"dashboard\" living on the home page of their personal space.",

In my version of Confluence though, \"my:favorite\" does not actually make the page a favourite, and there's no other way (from the Profile for example) to remove the label.\r\n\r\nTo replicate:\r\n\r\n1. Open a page in Confluence.\r\n2. Click \"EDIT\" next to the labels.\r\n3. Add the label \"my:favorite\". Note that it's not added to the list of labels.\r\n4. Click \"Done\".\r\n5.

You can see the \"favorite\" label with the associated page, but no way to delete the label.\r\n\r\nAdditional steps:\r\n\r\n8. Go back to your page and manually add \"my:favourite\".\r\n9.
