      "description": "Smart Commits are great, but unfortunately Smart Commits can be dangerous in some environments. Here is why:\r\nh5. Fictional scenario 1: You're maintaining a product from the 90's called 'Don 3000'\r\n * Your\u00a0Jira project has the key _DON3000_\r\n * The workflow has a transition called _Done_\r\n\r\nh5. Fictional scenario 2: You are inventing R2D2\r\n * Your Jira project has the key _R2D2_\r\n * The workflow has a transition called _Resolve_\r\n\r\nOK, there might be better product names or project keys, but the point is, that a project key might be a prefix of a transition name - if you ignore the digits in the project key...\r\n\r\nWhat happens if someone commits with a message like this one:\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n{noformat}\r\nAdd awesomeness ref #DON3000-1, #DON3000-23{noformat}\r\nAccording to [Using Smart Commits|https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/using-smart-commits-in-bitbucket-server-802599018.html] nothing would happen, because the issue key is prefixed with '#'. Thus the developer is not referencing the issue key correctly.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nBut luckily Smart Commits is smart, because nowadays everyone is referring tickets with a hash symbol.\r\n\r\nEven Atlassian uses the '#' notation in email notifications on the customer support portal:\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n{panel}\r\nSee request details and updates for [ #GHS-109386|https://getsupport.atlassian.com/servicedesk/customer/portal/20/GHS-109386?sda_source=notification-email] - \"Unexpected smart commit behaviour\"\r\n{panel}\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nWhen I open the tickets DON3000-1 and DON3000-23, I see the commit in the development panel. Great!\r\n\r\nBut wait.... What happened?!?\r\n\r\nThe ticket DON3000-1 is now done! According to the activity panel, the commit closed DON3000-1. Well, that's unexpected!\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nI would say the hash notation for tickets are common and should not be considered as a bug. Jira and Bitbucket accept this notation and link issues with commit messages using this notation. But the command parsing of Smart Commits is really lousy.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nLooking at com.atlassian.jira.plugin.devstatus.smartcommits.DefaultCommitMessageParser you know why:\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n{code:java}\r\nprivate static final String COMMAND_TEXT = \"([A-Za-z][A-Za-z\\\\-]*)\";\r\nprivate static final String COMMAND_EXTRACTION_PATTERN = NON_CAPTURING_WHITESPACE + \"(?=#\" + COMMAND_TEXT + \")\";\r\n{code}\r\nThe parser simply stops at the first character not being a letter or the dash character. If at least the pattern would allow digits... Can't transition names have digits?\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nNote: I haven't tested what happens if you extend the pattern for digits like \"([A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9\\\\-]*)\", but if you accept any code contribution I would be happy to write some tests (maybe you already have some, tests are not part of the dependency sources... but that's another topic...)\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nNote: This bug is related to JRASERVER-60746 which would also solve this issue, but that issue might be considered as a feature, so that the lazy programmer only has to write #c instead of #close...\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nFinal note: We have a client suffering from this issue. So it is not just a fictional edge case scenario. It does happen already and who knows how many issues have been closed or whatever by accident.\r\n\r\nFinal final note ;): Affects Version is probably every 7.x version. I just tested it on my own test instance which had version 7.5.3.\r\n\r\nArgh: I think this is a bug and would like to file it here, but your instance is broken:\r\n # Creating a bug ticket for project\u00a0JRASERVER is unusabe as you provide no description field or other multiline textfield\r\n # Creating a bug ticket for project JSWSERVER fails on submission complaining that my user does not have the 'Assign Issue' permission\r\n # I'll try submitting it as a \"Suggestion\" - please consider it as a bug and let me know if you're taking care of it. Otherwise feel free to close it immediately and say something like \"we don't care\".",

Epics are hidden from Kanban board, because of using of Backlog Board.\r\n\r\nh3.*Suggested Solution*\r\nTo add an Epic panel to Kanban board as it is presented in Backlog board\r\n\r\nh3.*Why this is important*\r\n\r\nIt will be very convenient to use JIRA, if you use one project for a lot of products.   \r\n\r\n !boards.png|thumbnail!

You don't assign Priority Scheme to Products like with every other Scheme, no you assign Products to Priority Schemes. To change a projects Priority Scheme you have to go to the Priority Scheme and link the project in a multi-select\u00a0box where I can see 5 of x-hundred project entries. If I don't hold down CMD while editing this form the whole configuration is gone.\r\n\r\nPlease change it the way you assign everything else to a project.

Creating new Priority Schemes\r\n\r\nIf you create new priorities like DefCon1 to DefCon5 they are automatically added to the default Priority Scheme, that is linked to all projects by default. But you can't edit the Default Priority Scheme to remove the newly created priorities. So you have to create a new \"Custom Default\" Priority Scheme assign all projects and then you can add new priorities.\r\n\r\nThis is completely unnecessary.

All of them got rejected, due to the policy, that Jira sicks with 1 assignee.\r\n\r\nMy request is not to break this, but to add a functionality to the agile board only, that for example, the username behind an avatar is part of a user picker (multi users) custom field. The assignee can stay as it is (first drag&drop of avatar will fill assignee, next goes into custom field).\r\n\r\nDuring the past years, working as an agile coach, I have seen many times that teams, working with a physical agile board, mark issues with multiple avatars (magnetic white-board, post-its and individual magnetic avatars).\r\n\r\nIt absolutely make sense, because the whole agile movement is all about \"individuals and their interaction\". +Reviews+, +knowledge transfer+ and +pair programming+ (XP) are best examples for marking an issue with more than one worker. Not only the solo work on one issue.\r\n\r\nImplementing this feature will make Jira Software come very close to the physical boards.",

Suggested Solution\r\n\r\n* Allow for administrators to be able to configure the maximum rank length via the UI, or at least via a configuration that can be set upon restarting JIRA.\r\n* Or, allow administrators to bypass the rank limit in order to be able to continue ranking issues while the balance is ongoing.\r\n\r\nh3. Why this is important\r\n \r\nLarger instances can face balance times of days, or even weeks. If this rank length limit is encountered, users will be unable to rank issues until the balance is complete. Administrators need a way to mitigate this.\r\n\r\nh3.

These all have different resolutions,\u00a0_Rejected, No longer required,_\u00a0and\u00a0_Done._\u00a0Ideally, these transitions should all occur from different points in the work flow but I've found myself\u00a0putting extra transitions in just to make it clear to the user which transition it is they're using.\u00a0\r\n\r\nBeing able to select the option to have the transition label appear in the column all of the time (a check box on\u00a0the board configuration screen perhaps?) would be amazing. Is there anyway of achieving this that you're aware of? Otherwise are you aware of anyone raising this already because I can't believe that I'm the only one - but I haven't been able to find it.\u00a0\r\n\r\nAny help/suggestions would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\n\r\nBleddyn\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nPlease reconsider this behaviour - offering some choice on when labels are shown through a toggle or a transition property would be a great improvement, and likely the default behaviour could simply be changed, to the benefit of most users.",

JSWSERVER-15307's problem is coming from View Board Screen.\r\n\r\nh3. *Workaround*\r\n\r\nJira Administrators can hide logging on the package by increasing logging level to ERROR.\r\n\r\nYou can achieve this by adding these lines into *log4j.properties*:\r\n{code:java}\r\nlog4j.logger.com.atlassian.ozymandias  = ERROR, console, filelog\r\nlog4j.additivity.com.atlassian.ozymandias = false\r\n{code}\r\nFor changes to make an effect, Jira restart is required.\r\n\r\nThe file log4j.properties is located at JIRA_INSTALL_DIR/atlassian-jira/WEB-INF/classes (as of Jira 7.12.x)\r\n\r\n(on) Mind, this would make the log lines disappear, yet would not address the root cause.\r\n The actual case had to be addressed by the plug-in vendor.\r\nh3. *For Plug-in Vendors*\r\n\r\n*Background*\r\n\r\natlassian-ozymandias is used to unify interaction Jira with the plug-ins.\r\n\r\nFrom the internal documentation:\r\n{quote}While any piece of code can be made safe by try/catches, as we all know, try/catch handling is verbose in Java.\r\n\r\nOzymandias attempts to codify a standard call pattern and logging response to runtime exceptions.\r\n\r\n*What safety is applied*\r\n\r\nThe ozymandias code catches all RuntimeExceptions and a handful of Errors that indicate code versioning problems, such as java.lang.LinkageError. It then logs a single line at warning level and logs the stack trace at debug level. This is a balance between knowing that a bit of code has problems and over-whelming the logs with stack traces.\r\n{quote}\r\n*Finding the errors*\r\n{quote}*Getting low level errors*\r\n If you are really interested in what went wrong, then many methods return List<Option<? extends ModuleAccessError>> and other variations.\r\n{code:java}\r\nList<Option<? extends ModuleAccessError>> errList = SafePluginPointAccess.to().descriptors(descriptorList, visitor);{code}\r\nThere will be an Option.none() for every successful access and an Option.some() of ModuleAccessError for every one that failed.\r\n{quote}\r\nAdditional tips for plug-in vendors:\r\n * use DEBUG level on com.atlassian.ozymandias to get stacktrace details\r\n * use debugger on the classes from the package, i.e. SafePluginPointAccess to see interactions with the plug-in.",

      "description": "h3. Problem Definition\r\nThere is a Misleading Recommended Filter Query in the document *[Using Manage Sprints permission for advanced cases | https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiraserver/using-manage-sprints-permission-for-advanced-cases-938847165.html]* across all versions of the Doc both Cloud and Server\r\n\r\nThe following section is highly situational and misleading as an overall suggestion:\r\n{quote}\r\nIn summary, we recommend that queries contain OR clauses in which AND clauses can be sub-clauses, and not the other way around.\r\n\r\nSimply put, make sure:\r\n\r\nyour OR clauses are outside the brackets, and\r\nyour AND clauses sub-clauses are inside the brackets.\r\nRecommended query format: <clause> OR (<clause> AND <clause>) OR <clause> OR (<clause> AND <clause>)\r\n\r\nComplex query format: <clause> AND (<clause> OR <clause>) AND (<clause> OR <clause>)\r\n{quote} \r\n\r\nas an EXE for the \"Recommended query format: <clause> OR (<clause> AND <clause>) OR <clause> OR (<clause> AND <clause>)\" query if any of these sections were missing a project definition it would be complex and should be rewritten as:\r\n{code}\r\n<project clause> OR (<project clause> AND <clause>) OR <project clause> OR (<project clause> AND <clause>)\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nThis is only useful for passing in multiple projects where some of the projects have an additional restriction such as a component:\r\n{code}\r\nProject = projectA OR (Project = projectB AND component = test) OR Project = projectC OR (Project = projectD and Component = test)\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nThe Logic of OR clauses connecting groupings of bracked queries is still good but the project association in each section is the main factor  Another example of this logic witha  simpler filter to collect the same data as the one above would be as follows noting (clause) OR (Clause) but a defined Project set at each section:\r\n{code}\r\n(Project in (projectA,projectC)) or (Project in (projectB,projectD) AND component = test)\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nNEXT the statement *\"your AND clauses sub-clauses are inside the brackets.\"* with the example Query *\"Complex query format: <clause> AND (<clause> OR <clause>) AND (<clause> OR <clause>)\"* is only partially correct as an example the following Logic is *NOT COMPLEX* and project A and B would be applied to all the following OR subclauses:\r\n{code}\r\n(Project in (projectA,projectB) AND (<clause1> OR <clause2> OR <clause3> OR <clause4>)\r\n{code}\r\nAs a comparison to how the AND outside the Brackets is a more valid solution Using the Current recommendation of the documentation the query above with the *\"(project clause) AND (multiple or clauses without project associations)\"* would be written as the following if using the \"(clause) OR (Clause And Clause)\" format:\r\n{code}\r\n(Project = projectA and Clause1) OR (Project = projectA and Clause2) OR (Project = projectA and Clause3) OR (Project = projectB and Clause1) OR (Project = projectB and Clause2) OR (Project = projectB and Clause3) OR (Project = projectB and Clause4)\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\nThe major stress point of the examples needs to be stated in a way that more clearly indicates the Project association needs to be distributed across every OR section or uniquely defined in each OR section\r\n\r\nAlso the AND clause outside the Brackets with OR clause inside the brackets is also a good approach to simplify the JQL as long as the Project definition is passed to the OR clause via the AND clause as a *\"(project clause) AND (multiple or clauses without project associations)\"*\r\n",
