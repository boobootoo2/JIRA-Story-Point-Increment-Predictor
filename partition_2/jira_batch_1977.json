      "description": "h3. Issue Summary\r\n\r\nInline dialog web items don't update context when navigating to another page\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nIn our app we have configured an inlinedialog web item like so:\r\n{code:json}\r\n        \"webItems\": [\r\n            {\r\n                \"location\": \"system.content.button\",\r\n                \"url\": \"/static/index.html?contentId={content.id}\",\r\n                \"context\": \"addon\",\r\n                \"target\": {\r\n                    \"type\": \"inlinedialog\",\r\n                    \"options\": {\r\n                        \"width\": \"450\",\r\n                        \"height\": \"70\"\r\n                    }\r\n                },\r\n                \"icon\": {\r\n                    \"width\": 24,\r\n                    \"height\": 20,\r\n                    \"url\": \"/static/assets/imgs/documents_icon_toolbox_cloud.svg\"\r\n                },\r\n                \"name\": {\r\n                    \"value\": \"Document toolbox\"\r\n                },\r\n                \"key\": \"k15t-docs-document-toolbox-dialog\",\r\n                \"conditions\": [\r\n                    {\r\n                        \"condition\": \"has_page\"\r\n                    }\r\n                ]\r\n            }\r\n        ]\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nThe way that this behaves is that if you click on it early in the page loading process, you end up on a non-existing page such as:\r\n{code:html}\r\nhttps://cdauth.atlassian.net/plugins/servlet/ac/k15t-scroll-document-versions-for-confluence/k15t-scroll-document-versions-for-confluence__k15t-docs-document-toolbox-dialog?page.id=1804730381&space.key=%7E490128752&content.id=1804730381&content.version=1&page.type=page&page.title=Test%20pages&space.id=1408663554&content.type=page&page.version=1\r\n{code}\r\nwith an error message.\r\n\r\nLater in the page loading process, when you middle-click on the item you still end up on the broken page, but when you left-click on the item, an inline dialog opens and loads an iframe with the specified URL inside it. In our case it looks like the attached image.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nIf you click on the button again or click somewhere outside of it or keep the mouse cursor outside of it for a couple of seconds, the inline dialog opens. If you click it again soon, it opens again and still shows the same iframe. However, if you leave it closed for like 30 seconds and then open it again, it shows the iframe for a brief moment, then removes the iframe, and then generates it again, reloading the specified URL.\r\n\r\nAs you can see in the configuration, I have configured the context parameter {content.id} in the iframe URL, which correctly passes the ID of the currently visible page to the iframe. However, if I open the inline dialog on one page and then navigate to another page by using the sidebar (which causes the other page content to be rendered without a proper page reload) and then open the inline dialog again, it is still in the context of the old page. Even when I wait for 30 seconds and then open it again, the iframe is recreated, but the page ID passed to it is still that of the previous page.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nWhat I would expect is that the first time I open the inline dialog on the new page, the iframe is recreated with the new page ID.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nFor a workaround, I had a look if there is some kind of event that I can listen to to detect the change of context, but I could not find something like that. Maybe someone knows something?\r\n\r\nIt would also be nice if the web item button didn\u2019t link to a broken URL. I can\u2019t count the number of times that I have clicked on it when the page was not fully loaded yet\u2026",

Suggestion\r\n\r\nTo have the article matching with the current UI, this is a suggestion to update the steps to import a word document. For example:\r\n{quote} # View an existing page. The page chosen becomes the parent page of the document imported.\r\n # From the top right of the page, choose\u00a0\u00a0\u2022\u2022\u2022, hover the cursor over\u00a0*Advanced details* and select *Import word document*\r\n # Choose\u00a0*Select file to import*,\u00a0locate the Word document you want to import, then choose\u00a0*Import*. The\u00a0 take you onto the Import configuration step.\r\n # Choose the import options you want (see below for more info), and then\u00a0*Import*.\u00a0{quote}\r\n(i)\u00a0Alternatively, the instructions to import a word document while creating a page could also help. For example:\r\n # Tap the\u00a0*Create*\u00a0button at the navigation bar.\r\n # From the draft, under the template navigator, select\u00a0*Import*\r\n # Select\u00a0*Word document*\r\n!import_beta.png|thumbnail!\r\n # Select the file to upload",
