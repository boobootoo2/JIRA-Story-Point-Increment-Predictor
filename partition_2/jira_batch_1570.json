I love this, it's really handy.\r\n\r\nIt would be great, right after having reloaded the page, to have a quick highlight (a few seconds) of the\u00a0updated area/text/section so that I can focus and acknowledge the edit(s) instead of having to go to the history section or having to read the whole page.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThanks a lot!",

This macro, among other functions, provide users with a table view created upon a specific filter provided by the user. Among the columns available for this table, there's one called \"Epic Link\". The \"Epic Link\" column is supposed to provide a link to an Epic Issue related to the issue being displayed in the table, however, it is currently pointing to the issue itself, not to the Epic, which is wrong.\r\nh4. Steps to Replicate\r\n # Create an application link in between Confluence and Jira.\r\n # Access Jira and create a project. Now, create three issues and an Epic Issue.\r\n # Relate these three issues to the Epic Issue.\r\n # Now, get back to Confluence and create a page.\r\n # Add a Jira Issues macro to this page.\r\n # Filter it by pulling all issues from the project previously created.\r\n # Add the \"Epic Link\" column in the table view.\r\n # Save the Macro. It should look like this:\r\n !Screen Shot 2018-04-11 at 17.27.04.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nIn this scenario, MAR-4, MAR-3 and MAR-2 are regular issues linked to MAR-1 (Epic).

Environment\r\n * Reproduced in Chrome 65.0.3325.181 and Firefox 59.0.2\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Go to the *Custom HTML* admin page\r\n # Insert an HTML element onto the page in the *At end of the BODY* field:\r\n{code:java}\r\n<h1>test</h1>\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nA header with the word \"test\" will appear at the end of the page with no other elements after it.\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nThe header is shown, and the footer \"Atlassian\" logo is duplicated below it.\r\n !duplicate-footer.png|thumbnail!\r\nh3. Notes\r\n\r\nThis happens for adding any HTML page element (even just plain text with no html tags), but does not appear to affect scripts entirely encapsulated in a {{<script>}} tag.\r\nh3. Workaround\r\nh4. Remove duplicate image (preferred)\r\n\r\nYou can remove the duplicate logo with the following code. This workaround most directly resolves the root cause:\r\n{code:none}\r\n<script type=\"text/javascript\"> $(\"#footer-logo\").hide();</script>\r\nAdd whatever you want to show in the footer here.\r\nYou should see all this text, and only one logo.\r\n{code}\r\n\u00a0\r\nh4. Scripts\r\n\r\nIf the entire custom HTML is a script, be sure all the code is inside {{<script></script>}} tags.\r\nh4. HTML Elements\r\n\r\nIf you do have HTML elements to add to the footer, this issue will not happen if the content is added through a script. You can use the following templates to add HTML elements to the end of the page with jQuery (note: these have the possibility of having unintended visual side-effects, and are suggested here only if the \"Remove duplicate image\" workaround does not work for you):\r\n{code:javascript|title=Insert above Atlassian logo (may cause duplicate logos if any links are used)}\r\n<script>\r\n  const textToAdd = `\r\n    <p>Here is some HTML that will show at the bottom of the page.</p>\r\n    <p>No duplicate footer here!</p>\r\n  `;\r\n  $('#footer-logo').prepend(textToAdd);\r\n</script>\r\n{code}\r\n{code:javascript|title=Insert below Atlassian logo}\r\n \r\n<script type=\"text/javascript\"> \r\n  let textToAdd = ` \r\n    <p>Here is some HTML that will show at the bottom of the page.</p> \r\n    <p>No duplicate footer here!</p> \r\n  `; \r\n  $('body').append(textToAdd); \r\n</script> \r\n{code}",

As a result, the browser receives the content with gzip compression on top of brotli compressed javascript.\r\n\r\nh3.

      "description": "h3. Summary\r\nConfluence is shipped with Cluster Safety mechanism in which is designed to ensure that its data cannot become inconsistent. \r\nThis mechanism runs as a scheduled task - _ClusterSafetyJob_, which runs every 30 seconds by default. The scheduled task operates on a safety number \u2013 a randomly generated number that is stored both in the database and in the distributed cache used across a cluster. These random numbers were then compared to ensure data consistency. However, should the number differs, Confluence will then trigger a cluster panic event. \r\n\r\nIn a specific event where the safety number update (_UpdateTimestampsCache_) on either one of the sources failed, the following issue will then occurred:\r\n# _HazelcastClusterSafetyManager_ updates numbers in database and cache\r\n# _HazelcastClusterSafetyManager_ runs sanity check\r\n# During sanity check, _Hibernate_ fails to update UpdateTimestampsCache_v5\r\n# _Hibernate_ rolls back transaction\r\n# Safety number in the database is rolled back to previous value, but number in the cache remains updated.\r\n# Next run of cluster safety job forces cluster panic, as numbers in the cache and database are different\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nInstead of triggering cluster panic event, Confluence should handle this error more gracefully, e.g. Confluence should evict the bad node(s) from its cluster instead.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nThe below exception is thrown in the atlassian-confluence.log file, which then led to cluster panic:\r\n{noformat}\r\n2018-04-06 12:17:05,038 ERROR [Caesium-1-2] [org.hibernate.internal.ExceptionMapperStandardImpl] mapManagedFlushFailure HHH000346: Error during managed flush [No response for 120000 ms.

Workaround 1: Use production backup strategy (recommended)\r\nAs the XML backup can become less efficient as the content grows, Atlassian does not recommend using the XML backup for production disaster recovery.

Workaround 2: Use Java's date format\r\nYou can use a date format in the filename to name the file with the day of the week, month or year, so when Confluence tries to do this again, it is overwritten the next time Confluence needs to use the file name (e.g. \"backup-Fri.zip\" will be overwritten on Friday each week):\r\n\r\n# Go to !https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/files/590259974/590058056/1/1398739558493/Cog.png! > *General Configuration* > *Backup Administration*\r\n# Click *Edit*\r\n# Replace the information in the *Backup File Date Pattern* with a single letter:\r\n#* Overwrite after a week: {{E}}\r\n#* Overwrite after a month: {{d}}\r\n#* Overwrite after a year: {{D}}\r\n# Click *Submit*\r\n\r\n{panel:bgColor=#fff8c9}\r\n(!)*CAUTION (!)*\r\nAs this is not a native feature of Confluence, any issues caused by this workaround may fall outside the scope of [Atlssian Support Offerings|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/Support/Atlassian+Support+Offerings].

      "description": "At the moment a big issue for enterprise is being able to push a managed config out with the application to streamline the user eqperiexpe (and even maybe some custom restrictions in the future. But let's start simple)\r\n\r\nA good starting point would be being able to deploy the URL of your confluence instance out with the app so that when the user opens the app they are simply asked to sign In vs being asked to enter a server url.\r\n\r\nThis is critical for a lot of enteprises.\u00a0\r\n\r\nNot all companies are tech companies with tech savvy staff. If we were to push the app to our 8000 sales reps - regardless of what training / resources / instructions are provided I can guarantee that the helpdesk would be inundated with tickets and calls along the lines of \"I can see the confluence app on my device but now it's asking for some server url thing?\"\u00a0\r\n\r\nYou'd have people that fall Into the group above and a good majority of the rest would put it into the 'too hard' basket without even attempting to try or get help.\u00a0\r\n\r\nI know it sounds silly but try not to have the attitude of 'Its just a web url who cant do that's - because I can assure you a lot of people would struggle.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThis isn't hard to implement on a code side at all. Apple makes it really easy with their Managed App Configuration framework. What this allows is for a company to push out a plist dictionary with the app (XML) that would configure this setting.\u00a0\r\n\r\nIt would look something like this\u00a0\r\n\r\n<boolean keyName=\"confluenceUrl\">\r\n <value>https://my.confluenceserver.com</value>\r\n </boolean>\r\n\r\nAt which point if the app detects this dictionary key when being opened they are taken straight to authenticate instead of being asked for the url .\u00a0\r\n\r\nThis isn't difficult to implement either, realistically your looking at a few hours of work in the hands of a skilled iOS developer to implement this feature.\u00a0\r\n\r\nApple even provide a code sample that can be pretty much copied and pasted into your app and then bam.. the beginning of being able to fully support managing your confluence app behaviour in enterprise environments.\u00a0\r\n\r\nYou can find a quick into as well as the code samples directly from Apple here [https://developer.apple.com/library/content/samplecode/sc2279/Introduction/Intro.html]\r\n\r\nFor more in depth you can just google 'Apple mdm managed app config' and you'll find lots of resources.\u00a0\r\n\r\nSuch a small investment of time has such a huge payoff when it comes to user experience. That's one less thing the user needs to do when they get their device on their first day. They open the confluence app and log in , then off they go. Instead of being asked for a server url / address.\u00a0\r\n\r\nLess steps for the user = a better user experience = happier users = more adoption\u00a0\r\n\r\nPlease oh please consider piroritising / bumping up the urgency of this.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThen you've lasted the ground work to manage any aspect of the app in the future , but this one simple feature is a huge step in the right direction.\u00a0\r\n\r\nPlesse try and remember that your customers are not all just developers who are competent of such a basic task. There's hundreds of thousands of users who are using products like confluence in marketing, hr , etc\u00a0\r\n\r\nThis not only benifits the users, it saves the It department valuable support time and lays the way forward for more advanced management in the future\u00a0\r\n\r\nThanks",

Summary\r\nInstead of requiring manual configuration of Synchrony for Confluence Data Center, implement the same feature as Confluence server where a Synchrony child-process is started on each node in the cluster.\r\n\r\nWhen the admin clicks \"Enable Collaborative Editing\" in the UI, the process is simply started and collaborative editing is enabled with little to no effort required by the admin.\r\n\r\nh2. Benefits\r\nImplementing a change like this would allow data center customers to use their existing Confluence nodes, and a child process will simply be started on each cluster node when Collaborative Editing is enabled in the UI. If this were to use the synchrony-proxy to handle traffic transparently to the user. \r\n\r\nTaking an approach like this would only require a small tweak to the reverse proxy configurations of most customers. No editing of config files, no installing services, no copying scripts from one machine to another. Simply click a button in the UI and each node starts a child process for Synchrony. This still provides the HA aspect of the cluster, as it would occur on all nodes. \r\n",

      "description": "(!) This issue does not affect Data Center users. Confluence Data Center is currently able to run the clean-up job without problems.\r\n\r\nh2. Issue Description\r\nThere's a scheduled job executed by Confluence job handler called {{Service Provider Session Remover}} accountable for removing expired OAuth tokens from {{BANDANA}} table. This job is not working properly, and expired tokens are not being cleared as expected. With enough expired tokens in the database, this can eventually lead to an {color:#ff0000}application crash{color} as the logic to handle tokens is negatively impacted by the number of expired and useless entries stored in the database.\r\n\r\nh2. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Set up JIRA + Confluence applinked together through an OAuth relationship\r\n# Add Confluence gadget feed to JIRA\r\n# Create new JIRA Dashboard and add Confluence Page Gadget, do *not* \"Login and Approve\"\r\n# Every time the Dashboard/Gadget is loaded, observe that a new {{com.atlassian.oauth.serviceprovider.ServiceProviderTokenStore.token.<somestring>}} row gets added in BANDANA table in Confluence, e.g.:\r\n{code:title=bandanakey}\r\ncom.atlassian.oauth.serviceprovider.ServiceProviderTokenStore.token.5IWZaCCOpzibZTUboRNaJU5WmddxePSe\r\n{code}\r\n{code:title=bandanavalue}\r\n <properties>\r\n   <property name=\"token\" value=\"dqgAd6Oc9JU2G4ZuM6ec0PLmkIMf670w\"/> \r\n   <property name=\"creationTime\" value=\"1521048328968\"/> \r\n   <property name=\"tokenSecret\" value=\"ZAN3c7Yu6zEP8pUQVWB25e5odUrsRNbi\"/>   \r\n   <property name=\"authorization\" value=\"NONE\"/> \r\n   <property name=\"version\" value=\"V_1_0_A\"/>\r\n   <property name=\"properties\" value=\"   \r\n xoauth_app_url=http\\://confluence.example.com/rest/gadgets/1.0/g/com.atlassian.confluence.plugins.gadgets\\:confluence-page-gadget/gadgets/confluence-page-gadget.xml\r\n \"/> \r\n   <property name=\"type\" value=\"REQUEST\"/>   \r\n   <property name=\"callback\" value=\"http://jira.example.com/plugins/servlet/gadgets/oauth-callback\"/> \r\n   <property name=\"consumerKey\" value=\"jira:2f5ae229-2135-43a8-bfd4-77f1cd14b3cc\"/>  \r\n   <property name=\"timeToLive\" value=\"600000\"/>  \r\n </properties>\r\n{code}\r\n# Load the JIRA Dashboard and Gadget several times and observe there are now several such entries in the BANDANA table.\r\n# Leave Confluence running for 8 hours or more to ensure {{Service Provider Session Remover}} runs. It will not and you will be able to see evidence on logs that it has failed to execute. You should have an entry like the one below:\r\n{code}\r\nrunJob Scheduled job CompatibilityPluginScheduler.JobRunnerKey.Service Provider Session Remover#CompatibilityPluginScheduler.JobId.Service Provider Session Remover completed unsuccessfully with response JobRunnerResponse[runOutcome=ABORTED,message='Job has unexpected run mode RUN_LOCALLY'].\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nh2. Expected Behavior\r\nThe {{Service Provider Session Remover}} runs every 8 hours and clears out the OAuth tokens from BANDANA\r\n\r\nh2. Actual Behavior\r\nThe {{Service Provider Session Remover}} attempts to run every 8 hours but is aborted. The {{scheduler_run_details}} table shows:\r\n{code}\r\n   id    |                               job_id                                |       start_time        | duration | outcome |                 message                 \r\n---------+---------------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------+----------+---------+-----------------------------------------\r\n  428282 | CompatibilityPluginScheduler.JobId.Service Provider Session Remover | 2018-03-27 02:56:11.413 |        6 | A       | Job has unexpected run mode RUN_LOCALLY\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nh2. Technical details\r\nThe above means that if the dashboard is loaded 1000 times, there will be 1000 such entries in the database. These tokens are supposed to be cleared from {{BANDANA}} via the scheduled job {{Service Provider Session Remover}} which runs every 8 hours, however the job is currently broken.\r\n\r\nAs expired/unused tokens are not removed, instances will eventually hold a huge number of tokens in their database. Due to the logic used in the [OAuth Plugin|https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-oauth] and documented in [OAUTH-321|https://ecosystem.atlassian.net/browse/OAUTH-321], as the number of tokens in the database grows, so does the complexity of the problem it needs to resolve. This is because when inserting a new token to the database, it will iterate through a list of existing tokens to validate each one of them before inserting a new one.\r\n\r\nThe intent of this logic is to validate duplicated entries as well as keep the list of usable tokens up to date, however, as the set of data ( n ) that the algorithm needs to resolve gets bigger, so does the complexity of the problem, which demands more computational resources to get resolved, making the algorithm an O (n\u00b2) [complexity class|http://bigocheatsheet.com/] one, leading to eventual outages depending on the instance usage and available resources.\r\n\r\nh2. Symptoms\r\nThe Confluence instances that run into the performance/stability problems due to high number of stored OAuth tokens will observe one or more of the following symptoms:\r\n * High CPU Usage.\r\n * High Memory Usage.\r\n * A huge number of entries in {{BANDANA}} table related to {{Service Provider}} tokens. This can be confirmed by running below query:\r\n{code:sql}\r\n select count (bandanaid) from bandana where BANDANAKEY like '%com.atlassian.oauth.serviceprovider.ServiceProviderTokenStore.token%';{code}\r\n * Reports of long-running/stuck threads in Tomcat and Confluence logs for /plugins/servlet/oauth/request-token, e.g.:\r\n{code}\r\n14-Mar-2018 00:40:18.482 WARNING [ContainerBackgroundProcessor[StandardEngine[Standalone]]] org.apache.catalina.valves.StuckThreadDetectionValve.notifyStuckThreadDetected Thread \"http-nio-8101-exec-12\" (id=232) has been active for 69,763 milliseconds (since 3/14/18 12:39 AM) to serve the same request for https://confluence.example.com/plugins/servlet/oauth/request-token and may be stuck (configured threshold for this StuckThreadDetectionValve is 60 seconds).

Workaround\r\nAs a workaround, we need to clear tokens stored in {{BANDANA}} table manually, since the Scheduled Job is not doing it for us. To do that:\r\n # Shutdown Confluence.\r\n # Connect to your database client.\r\n # {color:#FF0000}Take a backup{color} from your Confluence database in case we may need to revert it to its pre-delete statement state.\r\n # Execute below query:\r\n{code:sql}\r\ndelete from BANDANA where BANDANAKEY like 'com.atlassian.oauth.serviceprovider.ServiceProviderTokenStore.token%' and bandanavalue like '%value=\"REQUEST\"%'\r\n{code}\r\n # Restart the application.\r\n\r\nAfter this is done, you should no longer observe the symptoms caused by this issue, however, users may be prompted to re-authenticate against applications that were relying on the OAuth tokens previously stored in the database once the clean-up is completed.\r\n\r\nIt is important to highlight that this workaround may need to be repeated from time to time until this bug is solved if symptoms re-occur. Instance administrators may want to setup a trigger in their database clients to execute this routine automatically based upon certain circumstances, like for example, {{BANDANA}} table going full of records if they intend to automate this task.",

Try highlighting plain text.* \r\n\r\n!Screen Shot 2018-03-28 at 7.26.42 PM.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\nh3.Steps to reproduce\r\n# Create a new Confluence page.\r\n# Create a table with a heading\r\n# Type the text \"Kind\" in any heading cell.\r\n# Type the text \"Kind\" anywhere else in the page.\r\n# Save the page.\r\n# Highlight on the text \"Kind\" from step 4 above and create an inline comment\r\n# Type any comment on the inline comment text box and click Save\r\n \r\nh3.Expected Result\r\nOnce the user clicks on save, the inline comment should be available.\r\n\r\nh3.Actual Result\r\nThe error message *We can't add your inline comment; the section you highlighted may contain a macro or user mention. Try highlighting plain text.* will be displayed.\r\n\r\nh3.Notes\r\n# This issue only occurs if the page has only one section and that section is a Single Column Section.\r\n# The issue described here is case-sensitive. For example, if the table header has the text \"Name\", users will still be able to create inline comments for the text \"name\" \r\n\r\nh3.Workaround\r\nIt seems that this issue only occurs if the page has only one section and that section is a Single Column Section. So a workaround on this would be to head over to Edit > Page Layout > Add Section. Users do not need to input any data in the new section.",

This set of symptoms are not yet fixed in Confluence 6.8.0.\r\n* CONFSERVER-52441 tracks broken *emoticons*, which describes editing pages changes macro into hard links. \r\n\r\nIn local testing, this requires Collaborative Editing to be *enabled* to reproduce.\r\n\r\nh2. Steps to reproduce\r\n# Install Confluence without any context path. Version 6.8.0 was used in this test. Make sure Collaborative Editing is enabled.\r\n# Create a couple of test pages\r\n# On one of the pages, create a link to another page.\r\n# Drag an example attachment such as a zip file into the editor.

      "description": "h3. Problem Definition\r\nIt would be beneficial to add a macro on a parent page that can provide the last date, time, and the username the parent page along with its child pages was modified. This way the administrator can track pages that have been created but was not recently updated or referenced. This is useful for organizations with large deployment to clean up their instances and keep them up-to-date.\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\nAdd a macro on the parent page that will provide the last updated date/time and username for that page and its child pages.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\nUsing a database query, we can list all versions and modified dates of each page within a space:\r\n{code:sql}\r\nselect s.spacename, c.title, c.lastmoddate\r\nfrom content c\r\njoin spaces s on s.spaceid = c.spaceid\r\nwhere contenttype = 'PAGE'\r\nand prevver is null\r\nand spacename =\u00a0\u2018<SPACENAME>';\r\n{code}\r\n* The {{<SPACENAME>}} must be replaced with the\u00a0particular Space\u00a0name in concern.\r\n* If you want the information to be reported on a page, you can do so using a third-party plugin [Bob Swift's SQL for Confluence|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/org.swift.confluence.sql/server/overview].",

Actual Results\r\nPage will be exported with without styling and background colors for status macro.\r\n !export.jpeg|thumbnail! \r\n [^680-testpdfexportbackground-260318-1107-6.pdf] \r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\nThere is no known workaround (with or without context path set).\r\nUsing HTML export will only work correctly for emoticons but not for status macro.\r\n\r\nh3. Note\r\nIssue was not present in the Confluence 6.5.1",
