(I checked, and the function is not available when you upload a new space logo in 5.0.1).\r\n{quote}",

This is an easier to implement and flexible approach than changing the descriptor to allow additional CSS classes on the property-panel elements, as this would be static by default and I'd assume that for the majority of use cases you'd need to assert a state at runtime.",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFCLOUD-28313].\n  {panel}\n\nSometimes macros are reasonably simple in terms of what they output, e.g. the [Status Macro|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Status+Macro]. In order to approximate to [WYSIWYG|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG], the only choice these macros currently have is to use the [EditorImagePlaceholder|https://developer.atlassian.com/display/CONFDEV/Providing+an+Image+as+a+Macro+Placeholder+in+the+Editor] in order to create an image of the rendered output. \r\n\r\nThis is suboptimal for several reasons:\r\n\r\n* Browsers render HTML/CSS slightly differently, the image output will always be just an approximation\r\n* There are no good JVM-based HTML/CSS render engines out there, the best bet would be to either use [Flying Saucer|http://code.google.com/p/flying-saucer/] (only supports CSS 2.1) or to ship with one of the Browser's rendering engines (e.g. WebKit wrapped in QtWebKit via [Qt-Jambi |http://qt-jambi.org/]\r\n\r\n\r\nAny solution using this approach will be unnecessarily complex when the goal is to just use the output of the macro in the editor. There is also a CustomHtmlEditorPlaceholder interface available, but the implementation is also restricted to img and object tags.\r\n\r\nI've identified the following reasons for why the editor applies these restrictions so far:\r\n\r\n* the custom HTML should not be editable, as it gives the user the impression that whatever he puts inside the placeholder will be persisted for the page, but that code is just \"thrown away\"\r\n* images are single elements without a text node, thus the cursor never jumps in, and drag&drop is easy to implement\r\n\r\nAs for the first restriction, imo that should be a decision made by the plugin developer. One possible implementation I envision for this is to utilize TinyMCE's [noneditable|http://www.tinymce.com/tryit/noneditable_content.php] to signalise the user that the content is not editable. Also this plugin has its quirks, if the user somehow gets into the placeholder and starts editing the only effect is that this edit gets lost. If that happens often we can iterate on making the plugin better or even add supplying JS signalising the user that he's in the wrong spot.\r\n\r\nAs for the second restriction, it is easy to identify the placeholders root element as it contains all the attributes a normal macro contains in the editor (e.g. data-macro-name), thus Drag&Drop should be relatively easy to implement for that.\r\n\r\nI'd suggest modifying the CustomPlaceholderEditorMarshaller to allow custom HTML beyond <img> and <object>. For the old tags it should just behave like it did before, but for anything else it should just make the content not editable with the above mentioned noneditable plugin.",

Response from Product Managers\r\nThis is not a bug but rather a naming change that came about during the new header implementation. What Confluence previously called the \"global logo\" was really just a \"default space logo\" since it could be overridden on a per-space basis. When the new global header came along, it required us to introduce a true global logo that always appears in the header and doesn't change on a per-space basis. Therefore we renamed \"global logo\" to \"default space logo\" and introduced a new, true global \"site logo\" that's consistent with the other products.\r\n\r\nClosing this as 'Not a bug'.",

The majority (84%) of example logos provided were rectangular in shape, so simply preventing the rounding of space logos (as some requested) would not solve the problem for these 84%. Therefore, we have built a new uploader which works for both square and rectangular logos.\r\n\r\nWith the current uploader, you can only select a portion of a rectangular logo, e.g.:\r\n!before.png!\r\n\r\nWith the new uploader, you can zoom out and crop \u2018beyond\u2019 the border of the image, allowing you to fit the entire logo in, e.g.: \r\n!after.png!\r\n\r\nThis works for a square logo as well, and allows you to adjust it inside the area that was previously clipped due to the circular mask.\r\n\r\nThese changes will be shipping in Confluence 5.6 and in a Confluence OnDemand update in the next few weeks.\r\n\r\nThanks again to all for your input and feedback, I'll now be marking this issue as closed.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nJohn\r\nConfluence Product Manager\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\nWith Confluence 5.0, rounding of space logos was introduced and enforced as the only option.\r\n\r\nSome logos do not lend themselves to rounding and look quite bad with it. There should be a way to set space logos without modification as before.\r\n\r\nh5. Workaround\r\n\r\nFor a workaround involving CSS (as well as background on why rounded logos were introduced), please see [this comment|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONF-28275?focusedCommentId=450941&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-450941].",

Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n# Create a full system XML backup from Confluence running on PostgreSQL\r\n# Install a new Confluence instance on Oracle, and import the data exported from the PostgreSQL instance\r\n\r\nh4. Cause\r\n\r\nThe data types saved in the activeObjectsBackupRestoreProvide.pdata file are defined exactly by the physical schema of the database. When restoring, Confluence attempts to reconstruct the tables using the column types of the source database.\r\n\r\nIn the case of Oracle importing from PostgreSQL, this triggers the Hibernate bug [HHH-6759|https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HHH-6759].\r\n\r\nh4. Workaround\r\n\r\nIn the case where there are boolean values causing the issue, you can fix by:\r\n\r\n# Unzip the backup file\r\n# Edit plugin-data/com.atlassian.activeobjects.confluence.spi/activeObjectsBackupRestoreProvider.pdata\r\n# Replace any occurrence of {code:xml}<boolean xsi:nil=\"true\"/>{code} with {code:xml}<integer xsi:nil=\"true\"/>{code}\r\n# Re-zip the backup\r\n# Import the new fixed backup\r\n\r\nh4. Test notes\r\n# After importing backup created on PGSQL to Oracle, make sure that AO data has been restored from previous instance and that you can add, edit, delete AO data - WD notifications are an example of these.",

Saving the page to local hard drive (containing the multimedia macro) renders a proper behavior: The mp4 file is played despite not having QuickTime plugin installed. \r\n\r\nCan't figure out what might be causing this as the source code is exactly the same, local vs Confluence, with the exception of where the mp4 file is being played from (in Confluence, it's played from the attachments link, while in the local hard drive, the mp4 file is loaded from the hard drive itself).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
