This issue can prolly be broken up into sub issues - but I will leave that up to someone else to do. \r\n\r\nI really love what jira and confluence has done to our workflow but at the same time it has also hurt our workflow with simple, yet missing, features.\r\n\r\n1: Reminders. It is ultimately important that people get reminded about an events if a reminder is setup in a calendar. Many people are mobile now days and subscribe to the team calendars or a personal calendar. For instance I am out of the office in meetings all the time and with the new team calendars I never get reminded of my next meeting. This is quite annoying as it is something that I rely on a daily basis. Why such a simple and powerful feature is missing escapes me.\r\n\r\n2: Making changes to the calendar. Again being mobile quite a bit I may have a client call and want to change their appointment to another time. I have my phone subscribed - but I can't make changes in my phones calendar and therefore I have to resort to going to the website and putting in my login information etc and making the change. This adds time and unnecessary steps.\r\n\r\n3: Adding the time to the fields is a bit cumbersome sometimes. When I enter time into the team calendars I always have to remember to type it in properly in military time. When in other systems a simple drop down of time broken up in 15 minute blocks I can easily select from.\r\n\r\nThese 3 above are so utterly important - not just to use (who come from using Google Calendar) but I am almost certain for many other people as well.\r\n\r\nI hope that these get implemented soon.",

This means these are HTTP URLs, and when being handed over to the Java Mail framework as being wrapped in a DataHandler [com.atlassian.confluence.extra.calendar3.notification.DefaultCalendarNotificationManager.createWebResourceDataHandler(String)] for a MimeBodyPart, this will result in an HTTP request being send to its own server for resolving the resource during message construction.\n\nA typical stack looks like this:\n\n{code}\nat sun.net.www.protocol.http.HttpURLConnection.getInputStream(HttpURLConnection.java:1436)\nat java.net.URL.openStream(URL.java:1010)\nat javax.activation.URLDataSource.getInputStream(URLDataSource.java:92)\nat javax.activation.DataHandler.writeTo(DataHandler.java:290)\nat javax.mail.internet.MimeBodyPart.writeTo(MimeBodyPart.java:1403)\nat javax.mail.internet.MimeBodyPart.writeTo(MimeBodyPart.java:874)\nat javax.mail.internet.MimeMultipart.writeTo(MimeMultipart.java:444)\nat com.sun.mail.handlers.multipart_mixed.writeTo(multipart_mixed.java:102)\nat javax.activation.ObjectDataContentHandler.writeTo(DataHandler.java:869)\nat javax.activation.DataHandler.writeTo(DataHandler.java:302)\nat javax.mail.internet.MimeBodyPart.writeTo(MimeBodyPart.java:1403)\n{code}\n\nYou see that the java.net.URL.openStream is called which uses the standard lib's primitive HTTP client in order to resolve the resource.

However, there is no key (as there was in the old calendar macro), to distinguish the variously-colored entries from one another. The only way to determine what the difference is between the purple entries and the pink entries (for example) is to click on an entry of each color and read the description. There should be a way to quickly at-a-glance see what each color means.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't necessarily need to look like the old key. The key could just have a small colored box with a description next to it. It could be above or below the calendar. If you want to save space, it could be a slide-out panel from the side of the calendar, or even a simple \"Key\" button which opens a pop-up key in a modal window.\r\n\r\nJust some suggestions, but I think a key is really necessary.",

Export space from old instance\n2. Import space to new instance\n3. Export the Calendar associated with the space in the old instance\n4. Import the Calendar to the new instance, and associate it with the space\n\nI then noticed that all usages of the calendar in the pages of the space were broken - it seems that this is because they rely on the calendar id, and this gets changed during the export/import process. This means I now have to identify all uses of the calendar macro, and update them.\n\nMy suggestion is to include the calendar information in the Space export for any linked calendars, meaning that they get restored with the same id in the new instance after being imported. Failing that, another workaround would be to manually set the id for the calendar after importing to the new instance.\n\n\n",

An option to at least allow switching between 12h and 24h mode would be preferable, or perhaps an option to supply the preferred time format for a view.\r\n\r\nFor now our workaround in the monthly view (which is the one we use) is to patch the default for timeFormat in fullcalendar.js from \"h(:mm)t\" to \"HH:mm\" which gives us 24 hour time, so the functionality is there.

They should be represented on the same date.\n\nPart of this issue is due to TEAMCALs not representing what field the Jira calendar item is linked to (TEAMCAL-432; even if they appeared on the same day, it would still be pretty confusing)",
