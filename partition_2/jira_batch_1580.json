(As far as I know the \"Move page\" feature has been rewritten in some Confluence version released around that time.)\r\n\r\nOur profiling results:\r\n\r\n|| Operation ||\t1.014M pages in Confluence 5.7.6 || 5.8.18 metric ||\t380K pages in Confluence 5.10.1 ||\r\n| Page archiving with MOVE | 40 minutes (for 1555 pages) | N/A | 1.1 hours (for 400 pages - stable, but slower!) |\r\n\r\n1555/40 = 39 page moved per minute in Confluence 5.7\r\n400/66 = 6 page moved per minute in Confluence 5.10 \r\n\r\n_6/39 means it is 85% slower than it used to be!_\r\n\r\nIs there any chance to accelerate page moves in Confluence core? \r\nOr offer an API to batch-move multiple pages?

      "description": "Hi,\r\n\r\nWe're slowly but surely molding confluence into a great system for our site and are now fine tuning performance. One thing we've noticed and sort of mitigated (in a good but not ideal way) is that whenever viewing a page a POST request get's made to synchrony/rest regardless of permissions... If the user has sufficient permissions they get a status 200 back and everything works fine. However if the user does not have sufficient permissions, it returns back a status 401. In different proxy / single-sign-on scenarios this can cause some difficulty and different products try \"solve\" this 401 which proved annoying.\u00a0\r\n\r\nInitially it was through that it was another product calling this method as they were listed as the referrer/instigator in the web tools, however in a completely add-on-less testing instance this rest POST still tries to occur.\r\n\r\nIt took quite a bit of investigation to figure out that it was the confluence product AND confluence permissions that call call the method and cause that result (users with high access tend to also have high network access, making \"permissions\" as a whole the thing to troubleshoot).\r\n\r\nThe weird thing is that if a user who does not have edit rights will always fail and get 401's but they also will never get to the edit function which the one scenario where the method makes more sense. So I'm not sure what the synchrony/rest POST in a viewing window achieves? Are you able to explain why this occurs in a viewing session with no edit rights, and what it achieves? If it needs to occur, is it possible to detect permissions of the user and know that it will not succeed to stop an average user having 401's in their web session and/or logs?\r\n\r\nI've attached an example of the code 200 response from the method.\r\n\r\n!request.png!\r\n\r\nAny answers around this would be great, as\u00a0it was quite a \"red herring\" for our organization to narrow down and fix, and even after raises the question of why that method would even occur in that situation.\r\n\r\nKind Regards,\r\n\r\nKurt.",

When it finally fails, the error message can be seen as in the screenshot, and the macro is greyed out.\r\nh3.

Expected results\r\n\r\nMacros render correctly in all cases.\r\nh3. Actual\u00a0results\r\n\r\nMacros fail when there's a custom field on them.\r\n\r\nh3. Recommended Resolution\r\n\r\nUpgrade to Confluence 7.7.4 or above, which contains a performance fix for Jira Issues Macro. This is detailed under CONFSERVER-56017.\r\n\r\nNote that an initial attempt to fix the performance issue was made in Confluence versions 7.4.1 and 7.5.0. However, it caused other problems and was reverted in Confluence 7.4.3 and 7.6.2. A proper fix was introduced in Confluence 7.7.4.\r\n\r\n19 Oct 2020 Update - For customers who would prefer to stay on long term support versions such as 7.4.x, Atlassian is currently looking into backporting the above fix to existing LTS release streams, so stay tuned.\r\n\r\nh3. Workarounds\r\n\r\nh4. Workaround - Increase Jira timeout (Confluence 7.4.1+)\r\n[Set the system property|https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/configuring-system-properties-168002854.html] {{confluence.jira.connection.timeout}} to a value higher than the default of 30000 (30 seconds)\r\nThis will increase the connection timeout for Confluence to fetch the results of a query from Jira.\r\n\r\nh4. Workaround - Clean up Jira custom fields (all versions)\r\nWhen Jira has a large number of custom fields, it can cause performance problems. [Cleaning up the custom fields|https://community.atlassian.com/t5/Jira-questions/What-is-best-way-to-delete-unused-custom-fields-from-JIRA-System/qaq-p/57790] that aren't used can improve performance.\r\n\r\nh4. Workaround - Use Jira Filter Results Gadget instead (all versions)\r\n\r\nIf you are unable to upgrade, the Jira [Filter Results Gadget|https://confluence.atlassian.com/jira064/adding-the-filter-results-gadget-720416922.html] can be added to Confluence via [Registering External Gadgets|https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/registering-external-gadgets-204050482.html] to load custom fields.",

This behavior occurred using Chrome 59.0.3071.115 (Official Build) (64-bit) while it does not happen in Firefox or Safari.  Also, this same page had previously worked in Confluence 5.7.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Restored a space XML export from a customer that contained a page with 14 MP4 files attached via the Multimedia macro, \r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n# # Using a Chrome browser, I performed the following tests:\r\n##  When I first opened the page, a blank white space was displayed in each section of the page where you used the Media Macro to embed the MP4 videos. Additionally, if I clicked the play button for a video, nothing would happen as the browser displayed a \"Processing request\" message at the bottom of the browser window.  Furthermore, the page continually clocked as if it were stuck loading content. This occurred for over 10 minutes with no change in the display of the video content.\r\n## However, when I reloaded the page, let it clock, and then hit the 'X' to stop page load, the behavior changed. The video splash images for all of the videos on the page would appear and if I hit the play button, the video would play.\r\n## Along with these tests, I tried to create a HAR file to inspect the page requests that occurred when opening the page. While I could see 206 Partial Content error messages for each of the video files, the resulting HAR file was not viewable in a HAR viewer and there were no other errors listed.\r\n## Next, I saved off each video to my file system and created a new page in a new space and embedded all of the videos using the media macro. Initially, the page displayed all videos with no problem. But, after leaving this new page and returning to it after a short while, the video splash images would not appear and clicking the play button did nothing. This behavior was exactly like that which I observed with your page.\r\n## As a final test, I removed several of the embedded videos from my new page. The result? The page started displaying all of the embedded videos again.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nExpected behavior is for the video splash images to display and be playable when the page opens up.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\nThere appears to be two workarounds.  \r\n# One way would be to remove several of the videos until the page starts displaying all embedded videos again.  \r\n# A second way, which doesn't always work, hit the 'X' in the URL bar to stop the page load and then click on refresh.

      "description": "h4. Issue Summary\r\nThe [Confluence Chart Macro|https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/chart-macro-163415075.html] can be rendered based on the input of tables. Inside these tables that will serve to render the Chart Macro, instead of typing numbers, customers usually rely on JIRA Macros to get a count of issues based on JQL Queries, using this count as input for the tables and consequently as input for the Chart Macro. This is a problem when using Confluence 5.10.8 Version, since the chart does not render anymore when using the above mentioned combination.\r\n\r\nh4. Replication Environment\r\nConfluence 5.8.6 - Clean Instance.\r\nConfluence 5.10.8 - Clean Instance.\r\nJIRA 7.2.7 - Clean Instance.\r\n\r\nh4. Replication Steps\r\n# Open your JIRA Instance and create three issues. Assign one of them and leave the other two unassigned. We will use this scenario to replicate the issue, however, you can setup JIRA as you want, as long as there are issues there to query.\r\n# Create an Application Link between your Confluence 5.10.8 and JIRA 7.2.7.\r\n# Once that's done, create a Test Page in your Confluence 5.10.8.\r\n# Insert the Chart Macro in the Page.\r\n# For explanation purposes, select Type = Bar and Display Orientation = Vertical.\r\n# Hit the Show in 3D Check-Box.\r\n# Save it.\r\n# Now, inside the Chart Macro Area, insert a 2x3 Table.\r\n# Name it as below Screenshot:\r\n !PS-15992 - Table.png|thumbnail! \r\n# Right next to the 'Two Issues' column, insert the Jira Charts Macro. On its Dialog Box, select Jira Issue/Filter option.\r\n# Search using the following filter:\r\n{code}\r\nproject = HTP AND issuetype = Bug AND status = \"To Do\" AND assignee in (EMPTY)\r\n{code}\r\n# Click on Display Options and select the combo box called 'Total Issue Count' and then hit Insert.\r\n# Right next to the 'One Issue' column, insert the Jira Charts Macro. On its Dialog Box, select Jira Issue/Filter option.\r\n# Search using the following filter:\r\n{code}\r\nproject = HTP AND issuetype = Bug AND status = \"To Do\" AND assignee not in (EMPTY)\r\n{code}\r\n# Click on Display Options and select the combo box called 'Total Issue Count' and then hit Insert.\r\n# At this point, your Editor should be looking like this - Screenshot is showing a 'X' instead of a number because JIRA was offline during the screenshot capture time:\r\n !Screen Shot 2017-09-07 at 18.17.55.png|thumbnail! \r\n# Save the Page. The Chart won't render and will be looking like below:\r\n !Screen Shot 2017-09-01 at 19.34.49.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\nh4. Expected Behaviour\r\nRepeat above steps using Confluence 5.8.6 instead of Confluence 5.10.8 and it will work fine. It should look like this:\r\n !Screen Shot 2017-09-07 at 18.21.01.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\nh4. Differences in between the Versions\r\n* Confluence 5.8.6 uses the following versions:\r\n{code:java}\r\n<plugin>\r\n    <key>confluence.extra.chart</key>\r\n    <name>Chart Plugin</name>\r\n    <version>2.0.5</version>\r\n    <vendor>Atlassian Pty Ltd</vendor>\r\n    <status>ENABLED</status>\r\n    <vendor-url>http://www.atlassian.com/</vendor-url>\r\n    <framework-version>2</framework-version>\r\n    <bundled>Bundled</bundled>\r\n</plugin>\r\n{code}\r\n{code:java}\r\n<plugin>\r\n  <key>confluence.extra.jira</key>\r\n  <name>JIRA Macros</name>\r\n  <version>5.6.12</version>\r\n  <vendor>Atlassian Pty Ltd</vendor>\r\n  <status>ENABLED</status>\r\n  <vendor-url>http://atlassian.com</vendor-url>\r\n  <framework-version>2</framework-version>\r\n  <bundled>Bundled</bundled>\r\n</plugin>\r\n{code}\r\n* While Confluence 5.10.8 uses the following plugin versions:\r\n{code:java}\r\n<plugin>\r\n    <key>confluence.extra.chart</key>\r\n    <name>Chart Plugin</name>\r\n    <version>2.1.1</version>\r\n    <vendor>Atlassian Pty Ltd</vendor>\r\n    <status>ENABLED</status>\r\n    <vendor-url>http://www.atlassian.com/</vendor-url>\r\n    <framework-version>2</framework-version>\r\n\t<bundled>Bundled</bundled>\r\n</plugin>\r\n{code}\r\n{code:java}\r\n <plugin>\r\n    <key>confluence.extra.jira</key>\r\n    <name>Confluence JIRA Plugin</name>\r\n    <version>6.0.11</version>\r\n    <vendor>Atlassian Pty Ltd</vendor>\r\n    <status>ENABLED</status>\r\n    <vendor-url>http://atlassian.com</vendor-url>\r\n    <framework-version>2</framework-version>\r\n\t<bundled>Bundled</bundled>\r\n</plugin>\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nh4. Workarounds\r\nThere are two workaround for this case. You can either add a Dark Feature to disable JIRA Macro async render or you can downgrade the plugins version. First option is strongly recommended.\r\n\r\nh5. Option 1 - Dark Feature\r\n# Access the following URL: http://<Confluence-Base-URL>/admin/darkfeatures.action\r\n# Add the following Site Dark feature and save:\r\n{code}\r\nconfluence.extra.jira.async.loading.disable\r\n{code}\r\n# There's no need to restart your application, just try accessing your page again and it should work fine.\r\n\r\nh5. Option 2 - Downgrade Plugin Version\r\n(!) This workaround was tested in a clean instance and no side effects were observed. However, in an enterprise instance, it is interesting to first apply this workaround to a test instance first and observe it for any side effects.\r\n\r\n*Objective:* \r\nDowngrade JIRA Macros from version 6.0.11 to version 5.6.12.\r\n\r\n*How to:* \r\n# Stop Confluence.\r\n# Access {{Confluence-Instalation-Directory/confluence/WEB-INF/atlassian-bundled-plugins}} on Confluence 5.10.8 and delete the {{confluence-jira-plugin-6.0.11.jar}} file after backing-up the above mentioned folder.\r\n# Access {{Confluence-Instalation-Directory/confluence/WEB-INF/atlassian-bundled-plugins}} on Confluence 5.8.6 and copy the {{confluence-jira-plugin-5.6.12.jar}} file.\r\n# Paste it to {{Confluence-Instalation-Directory/confluence/WEB-INF/atlassian-bundled-plugins}} on Confluence 5.10.8.\r\n# [Clear Plugin Cache|https://confluence.atlassian.com/confkb/how-to-clear-confluence-plugins-cache-297664846.html].\r\n# Start Confluence.\r\n# Charts will render properly.",

      "description": "Dear Atlassian Team,\r\n\r\nI have an suggestion for new module and it is \"subscribe button\". I think it would be great if you would have possibility to put such button on your\u00a0page in confluence. I don't mean sending emails about each and every change, but maybe user could define level of tracking. If he wants verbose watching of some subtree of pages or just high importance updates from admin of pages. Imagine I do product documentation in confluence and I want to announce something important to all subscribed users who use my product. Such a function would be of big help.\r\n\r\nI\u00a0have in my mind something like distribution lists from open source projects. You have \"users group\" and \"developers group\" and you can choose which one to join. That would provide streamlined way of communication, new integrated communication channel with email.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nIt would basically automate maintenance of email lists.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nBest Regards,\r\n\r\nDamian Baran",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFCLOUD-32555].\r\n{panel}\r\nh2. General Description\r\n\r\nWhen you invite a user or group to edit a page, there is no sanity check or confirmation in place to verify that this won't cause a large amount of spam to users.\r\n{panel:title=Example}\r\nExample: If there is a group called \"{{all}}\" and someone attempts to invite \"{{Allison}}\" to invite a page, they may instead invite everybody in the \"{{all}}\" group, which could be potentially thousands of users. Same thing for email as well.\u00a0\r\n{panel}\r\nh2. References\r\n\r\nIn our [Release Notes for 6.2 Notes|https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/confluence-6-2-release-notes-894219485.html], it notes that you can invite any user, or email, or group to edit.\r\n\r\n*There is no known workaround to prevent this behavior from happening other than removing the permissions to invite for a given Confluence user.*\r\nh2. Suggestions\r\n\r\nThis feature request to add some type of \"hey, wait a minute\" confirmation dialog or restriction to prevent these kinds of issues.\r\nh3. Possible things to add\r\n - add a confirmation dialog that tells them explicitly that their action will send an email to the users and/or groups selected with the consequences\r\n - add a configurable threshold to disallow inviting more than X users or groups with more than Y users in a given timeframe (invite flood protection)\r\n - enhance permissions (per CONFSERVER-7089 ) in order to let users only invite users and not groups or emails (or some combination thereof)",

Details of the problem\r\n\r\nIt is possible that multiple nodes are updating the table concurrently, because the table is not for clustered job.\r\n\r\nThe current implementation of SchedulerRunDetailsDao increases contention as it does purge (delete outdated job details) every time when a new record is added to the table:\r\n{code:java}\r\n    @Override\r\n    public void addRunDetails(JobId jobId, RunDetails runDetails) {\r\n        purgeOldHistory();\r\n        purgeJobHistory(jobId, runDetails.getRunOutcome() == RunOutcome.SUCCESS);\r\n\r\n        SchedulerRunDetails record = SchedulerRunDetails.fromRunDetails(jobId, runDetails);\r\n        save(record);\r\n    }\r\n{code}\r\n{code:java}\r\n   private void purgeJobHistory(JobId jobId, boolean success) {\r\n        Date threshold = new Date(System.currentTimeMillis() - PURGE_JOB_OFFSET_MILLIS);\r\n        if (success) {\r\n            // The current write is a SUCCESS, purge everything older than threshold.\r\n            JdbcTemplate jdbc = DataAccessUtils.getJdbcTemplate(getSession());\r\n            jdbc.update(\r\n                    \"DELETE FROM scheduler_run_details WHERE job_id = ? AND start_time < ?\",\r\n                    new Object[]{jobId.toString(), threshold}\r\n            );\r\n        } else {\r\n            JdbcTemplate jdbc = DataAccessUtils.getJdbcTemplate(getSession());\r\n            String successOutcome = String.valueOf(SchedulerRunDetails.runOutcomeToChar(RunOutcome.SUCCESS));\r\n            jdbc.update(\r\n                    \"DELETE FROM scheduler_run_details WHERE job_id = ? AND start_time < ? AND outcome <> ?\",\r\n                    new Object[]{jobId.toString(), threshold, successOutcome}\r\n            );\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n{code}\r\nNormally, the database should be able to handle these kind of concurrent transactions (as we are deleting things rather than updating the same record). However, it is not handled perfectly by MS SQL Server or MySQL. The situation is escalated and one transaction is chosen to be rolled back as a deadlock victim. This may lead to other symptoms.\r\n\r\nThese are two queries frequently being deadlocked:\r\n{code:java}\r\nDELETE FROM scheduler_run_details WHERE job_id =  @P0  AND start_time <  @P1\r\nDELETE FROM scheduler_run_details WHERE job_id =  @P0  AND start_time <  @P1  AND outcome <>  @P2\r\n{code}\r\nThe lack of the indexes is very likely to cause a full table scan during the execution of the delete statements. Adding the indexes in the workaround should significantly reduce the chance of deadlocks.\r\n\r\nAnd another thing is, the design of addRunDetails is not optimal. The purge should be implemented as a cluster wide job rather than part of the add logic. It would eliminate contention completely. Or at least it should be made less frequent (on a daily basis, for example).\r\nh2. Workaround\r\nh4. Option 1\r\n\r\nAdd the following 2 composite indexes to the SCHEDULER_RUN_DETAILS table, based on the predicates of the two delete statements.\r\n{code:java}\r\nCREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX IX_scheduler_run_details_jobib_starttime ON confluence.scheduler_run_details (job_id, start_time);  \r\nCREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX IX_scheduler_run_details_jobib_starttime_outcome ON confluence.scheduler_run_details (job_id, start_time, outcome);  \r\n{code}\r\nh4. Option 2\r\n\r\nAfter performing the above, deadlocks are still possible if the size of the table is very large (i.e. over 100k rows) due to the frequency of the purge request.\r\n\r\nYou can try deleting entries in the scheduler_run_details older than 1 day. The SQL query to do this would be something like below, replacing the date with one day ago:\r\n{code:sql}\r\nDELETE FROM scheduler_run_details WHERE start_time < ?\r\n{code}\r\n(!) *Important:* You should not run this in production without first testing in your staging environment. You should also take a database backup or dump prior to running this in production. If anything does not work as expected, you can then restore from the backup.\r\n\r\nh4. Option 3\r\n\r\nYou may also try to apply one of the below DB changes:\r\n # Disable lock escalation for the table scheduler_run_details\r\n # Disable page lock for the table scheduler_run_details\r\n\r\nThe final option would prevent the possibility of a deadlock caused by concurrent purges. Since the purged jobs are obsolete, this shouldn't be a problem. See also the below articles for more details on this:\r\n * [http://www.sqlpassion.at/archive/2016/10/31/disabling-row-and-page-level-locks-in-sql-server/]\r\n * [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15073547/avoid-deadlock-for-concurrent-delete]\r\n\r\n(i) Your DBA may have some experience in these options too.",
