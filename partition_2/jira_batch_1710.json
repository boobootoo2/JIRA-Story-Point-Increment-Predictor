Specially to documentation. A clear case is when we want to have links to a library reference manual from the examples, like you get with sphinx or doxygen.\r\n\r\n- What we would REALLY want is to have this done automatically. For example, any word (likely functions and/or classes) in the source code that matches a page in the space with that name should be shown as a link to it (eg, function \"foo()\" should always be shown as a link to the page titled \"foo\", if it exists).\r\n\r\nThe problem we are trying to solve here is how to migrate users off sphinx or doxygen offering them something *at least close* to what they have at the moment.

We are in the process of merging them all into one. \r\n\r\nThe admin of the other instance accidentally gave me the export of the whole install instead of just for that one space.\r\n\r\nI had imported a space before so I didn't check as I should have. I imported this file and it replaced our entire instance. \r\n\r\nWe managed to restore the backup and did not loose much. But we did have some downtime.\r\n\r\nI suggest the following to avoid other admins to make that same mistake:\r\n* have a separate page for importing a single space and one for importing the entire install\r\n* whenever anybody imports a full restore, there should be a warning message about what is about to happen and most likely ask for the password again. \r\n",

[See the corresponding bug report|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFCLOUD-32367].\n  {panel}\n\n*Symptoms:*\r\nOn the Page Properties Report macro either: \r\n\r\n*A)* Content is missing:\r\n!missing.jpeg!\r\n\r\n*B)* Columns are duplicated:\r\n!duplicated.jpeg!\r\n\r\n*Cause:*\r\nWhen manually modifying a Page Properties table, a hidden tag  (like <p> or <span>) might be present in the field text, making fields with same text be treated as different. This also makes impossible to list a column by it's name.\r\n\r\nSee the differences in the Storage Format of:\r\n{code:html|title=Project Page 3 <SPAN>}\r\n<ac:structured-macro ac:name=\"details\"><ac:rich-text-body>\r\n<table><tbody><tr>\r\n<td><p>Priority</p></td>\r\n....\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td><span>Status</span></td>\r\n....\r\n{code} vs\r\n{code:html|title=Project Page 1}\r\n<ac:structured-macro ac:name=\"details\"><ac:rich-text-body>\r\n<table><tbody><tr>\r\n<td>Priority</td>\r\n....\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Status</td>\r\n...\r\n{code}\r\n\r\n*So:*\r\n* in A) there is a Column Filter applied (Status, Priority) but the Report doesn't find those Columns in \"Project Page 3 <SPAN>\" because those fields have other characters in it.\r\n* in B) the columns are listed separately because although they look the same, they are different to the Report macro.\r\n\r\n*Expected:*\r\n* Special tags to be ignored. If rows look the same, to be treated like the same.\r\n\r\n*Steps to reproduce:*\r\nTo get the <p> or <span> values in the table you have to:\r\n# Write two lines of text anywhere on the page\r\n# Copy the lines inside the table\r\nEditing the field names from now on, will keep the <p> or <span> value on them.\r\n\r\n*Workaround:*\r\n* Remove the table's row and create it again, for every row with the problem.\r\n\r\n",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFCLOUD-32364].\n  {panel}\n\nThe biggest user problem I've run across since the death of wiki markup in Confluence is that it is now just as easy to make a link via a URL as a page name, and for naive users who don't know much about wikis it is, in fact, easier and more obvious to use the URL.  It also is harder to detect this, since a URL link and a correct page link look exactly the same.\r\n\r\nAdd a feature where, when the user puts in a link to a page as a URL link, the link is re-written to a page link (perhaps with an option to override) or the user is at least warned. It shouldn't be too hard to detect when the base URL points back into the wiki.\r\n\r\nOther options would include making URL links look different from page links in some way, or a tool that audits links and detects when pages have these bad links and allows them to be fixed from a central location.\r\n",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFCLOUD-32350].\n  {panel}\n\nA feature that I've always found lacking in Confluence is the ability to simply create a new Office document directly from within a confluence page.\r\nAt present, the only option is to create a new Word, Excel, or PowerPoint file directly within the office application and save it locally to your disk before having to then navigate around and drag it onto a confluence page. But what if users could simply choose a attachment/document template?\r\nI'd like to see the attachments macro and backend enhanced to support predefined document templates...not just specific to Microsoft documents though.\r\n\r\nThe system administrator/space administrator should have the ability to upload empty or templated files into the Admin section of Confluence, with assigned document type name and icon.\r\nThen, when a user views the attachments macro within a page, the user would be presented with the option to either Upload/Drag an attachment (existing) or Create a new document from the below attachment templates. Please refer to the attached mockup image.\r\nWhen the user clicks a template icon, they would be prompted for an initial 'filename' (required) and optional Comment and Labels before being presented with a refreshed screen containing the empty attachment. At this point the user would edit the document via their normal means...either Edit in Office, GoEdit or 'Unlock'. If 'Edit in Office' is the standard practise for the organisation, perhaps the named blank document would automatically open as though clicking 'Edit in Office' and lock it for exclusive use.\r\nImplementing such a feature would not only assist with user acceptance and uptake of Confluence but also save time for those staff who already regularly use it.\r\n\r\nSuggested features to include:\r\n* System Admin - Ability for the system admin to upload template files, icon and name\r\n* System Admin - Ability to set 'Global attachment templates'\r\n* System Admin - Ability for Space Admins to set use of 'Global attachment templates' or attachment templates specific to their team..i.e PDF, JPG etc\r\n* system Admin - Ability to set global method of editing Office documents...such as 'Edit in Office'. This option then identifies if the newly created file with automatically open for use once created.\r\n* Attachment Macro - When viewed inside a page, macro allows the user to click the attachment template to use. User is prompted for a required Filename. Comments and Labels or optional\r\n* Attachment Macro Options - Show/Hide  'Attachment Templates'\r\n* Add dropdown menu - within this menu, provide link to 'Add new attachment from Template' which executes the Attachments macro.\r\n\r\nThat's about it really... I hope there's enough detail to understand where I'm going with this. This enhancement should not cost more to your customers and should be covered within a maintenance release.\r\nFeel free to email for any further clarification.\r\nthanks\r\nTim",

However, there doesn't seem to be any reason to for this feature as the additional integration features that this enabled (auto-linking) have since be deprecated from APPLINKS and were decided [not to fix|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONF-23693?focusedCommentId=276546&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-276546] as the feature is provided by the jira issues macro.\r\n\r\nThe [applinks documentation|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/APPLINKS030/Application+Links+Documentation] clearly states that textual linking would be available once the space integration is created between applications.\r\n\r\nThere is also much confusion in the community about what the Integrations feature is supposed to do:\r\nhttps://answers.atlassian.com/questions/131303/difference-between-application-link-and-linked-space-between-jira-and-confluence\r\n\r\nAs there is no documentation referencing the features available from creating an Integration link in Confluence to another application, I suggest that we remove the feature or update the documentation so that the added feature set is clear to customers:\r\n\r\nhttps://confluence.atlassian.com/display/APPLINKS/Creating+Links+Between+Projects\r\n\r\nI've added some screenshots of the successful connection to JIRA with some text to show the lack of auto-linking and successful JIRA issues macro rendering.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

The problem is that when I go back to select research grants from the menu, I cannot see my entries, so I cannot correct them.
