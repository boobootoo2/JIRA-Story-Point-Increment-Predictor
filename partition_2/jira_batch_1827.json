[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFCLOUD-17323].\n  {panel}\n\nThere's discussion of this at CONF-17005.  There have been some complaints about the reported supported level of core macros that aren't also \"system\" plugins.  The solution to this isn't clear.\r\n\r\nOne possibility is that the plugin manager page should not depend on the plugin's isSystem flag to decide whether or not to show it.\r\n\r\nIt seems that the plugin manager page will only show plugins that are not explicitly marked as system plugins. That means, any plugins that are marked as a system plugin (the {{system}} attribute in {{atlassian-plugin.xml}}) will not show there. When that happens, the plugin cannot be disabled/enabled by Confluence admins.\r\n\r\nI think that logic is fine, but it might be semantically wrong for plugins that are _not_ marked as system plugins but sit in the application class path. One such plugin would be the Profile Macros. It was intentionally marked as a non-system plugin because users want to be able to enable/disable it.\r\n\r\nAlso, this raises a few questions:\r\n\r\n* If a plugin that sits in the application class path is not a system plugin, what type of plugin is it? Note: Plugins in the application class path cannot be upgraded or downgraded.\r\n* Can system plugins be enabled/disabled?\r\n* How should Confluence differentiate system plugins that can be enabled/disabled from those that can't be?\r\n\r\nSee also discussion in CONF-17005.\r\n",

It doesn't matter if we try to login as \"gweiss\" or \"gwei\u00df\" - in both cases only the password of the AD-user \"gwei\u00df\" will be accepted and in both cases the AD-user \"gwei\u00df\" will be logged in. \r\n\r\nIn user administration, a click on \"gwei\u00df\" correctly shows the user details of \"gwei\u00df\", but also a click on the user \"gweiss\" shows the user details of \"gwei\u00df\". Although the URL says \"/admin/users/viewuser.action?username=gweiss\", the displayed user is \"gwei\u00df\".\r\n\r\nNext strange thing: as user \"gwei\u00df\", you can't edit your personal profile. The shown profile is correct, but there is no edit link and no \"labels\", \"watches\", \"drafts\" and \"settings\" tab. Instead, you can follow yourself.\r\n\r\nThe users \"gwei\u00df\" and \"gweiss\" have the same Full Name and the same e-mail address (the e-mail address only differs in upper/lower case: \"Gweiss@xy.com\" and \"gweiss@xy.com\")\r\n\r\nPerhaps you can tell me what's wrong - we will try to rename the user \"gweiss\" in the local database and hope, that this will allow the AD-user to edit his user profile.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nSebastian H\u00f6hne",
