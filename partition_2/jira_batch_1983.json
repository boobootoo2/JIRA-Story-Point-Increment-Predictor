We fetch the renderedBody content from specific pages from your Confluence REST api, persist all attachements and convert the complete rendered body which you send into a responsive layout with the most popular Twitter Bootstrap CSS Framework and classes.\r\n\r\nI would like to share with you the component i created to transform your body content in a properly working Bootstrap layout, including a working TOC if it is set in the content.\r\n\r\n[https://github.com/GoGentoOSS/confluence-components/blob/master/BootstrapConverter.php]\r\n\r\nMaybe this is something you might want to implement as a converter because your format for most professional webdevelopers is way off standards and Twitter Bootstrap is basically THE most widely used CSS framework on the planet.\r\n\r\nThe converter converts the css classes to twitter bootstrap classes, strips those which are not needed and sanitizes the document by removing all the *data-*\u00a0attributes to prevent indecent exposure and style tags which may mess up both your SEO rating aswell as your page layout.\r\n\r\nOutside the scope of this suggestion (and not in the code) i just wanted to mention that after the document is converted, we persist all attachments and change the image src tags to the persisted versions, adding a width and height html attribute if they were set in your old src URL.\r\n\r\nExamples to our Confluence Space + Website end result are available on request by your team via our known means of communication.\r\n\r\nI hope this is of use of your team and may help others in their endeavours to connect their websites to your outstanding platforms of which some of them i been using for probably well over a decade now.",

      "description": "h2. Issue Background\r\n\r\nThe Trello Ecosystem team is building a Trello Power-up that would provide a better user experience for Confluence users with Trello. One of the power-up features is the attachments section that lists the Confluence links in a friendly manner, showing some basic data, like the page name, creation date, author name, along with the thumbnail image for the pages that have image attachments.\u00a0\r\n\r\n!Screen Shot 2020-09-02 at 10.44.44 PM.png!\r\n\r\nTo fetch data from Confluence, our app implements the 3LO authorization flow. So, once authorized, using the access token we make the API requests via the `https://api.atlassian.com/ex/confluence/\\{cloudid}/\\{api}` endpoint.\r\n\r\nThe images URLs we use for thumbnails, are the attachments download URLs, and this doesn't work well in a couple of cases. (Not working in Safari, and doesn't work if the browser doesn't hold the authentication cookies to that specific confluence site, where the image belongs to.)\r\n\r\nA much more reliable approach would be using the confluence-files API to fetch data about page attachments, so we can get direct image URLs.\r\nh2. Problem\r\n\r\nUsing confluence-files API works fine via `api.atlassian.com`, even without any access tokens, only if we request data for unrestricted pages (publicly visible, that do not need site authorization).\r\n\r\nExample:\u00a0[https://api.atlassian.com/ex/confluence/fff89a1a-52c8-11e5-91b2-3c15c2bd8caa-ecosystem/rest/files/1.0/files/content/431882386]\r\n\r\nFo the restricted spaces, if we don't apply authorization, we get the 403 error, which is fine. However, as it turns out, the `wiki/rest/files` endpoints are not supported through\u00a0OAuth 2.0 (3LO). So if we apply the same authorization flow to this endpoint, we get the 401 error.\r\n\r\nExample:\u00a0[https://api.atlassian.com/ex/confluence/a436116f-02ce-4520-8fbb-7301462a1674/rest/files/1.0/files/content/795320709]\r\n\r\nAdding 3LO support for the\u00a0`wiki/rest/files` endpoints would allow external apps to have a much better content experience.",

Issue Summary\r\n\r\nWhen OR operator is used on the title field with the tilde fuzzy match operator, results are not returned from both clauses. If one clause is exact match =, then the results will be from the title= search. If both clauses are ~, results will be returned from the first clause.\u00a0\r\n\r\nWhen I run\u00a0[https://ecosystem.atlassian.net/wiki/rest/api/search?cql=title%20~%20test]\u00a0I get a totalSize of 142\r\n When I run\u00a0[https://ecosystem.atlassian.net/wiki/rest/api/search?cql=title%20=%20new]\u00a0I get a totalSize of 39\r\n When I run booth in the same query\u00a0[https://ecosystem.atlassian.net/wiki/rest/api/search?cql=title%20~%20test%20or%20title%20=%20new]\u00a0I get a totalSize 25 Shouldn\u2019t be more than 142?\u00a0Looks like it have something to do with the use of ~\r\n If I use = instead it seems to work.\r\n When I run\u00a0[https://ecosystem.atlassian.net/wiki/rest/api/search?cql=title%20=%20test]\u00a0I get a totalSize of 133\r\n When I run\u00a0[https://ecosystem.atlassian.net/wiki/rest/api/search?cql=title%20=%20new]\u00a0I get a totalSize of 38\r\n When I run booth in the same query\u00a0[https://ecosystem.atlassian.net/wiki/rest/api/search?cql=title%20=%20test%20or%20title%20=%20new]\u00a0I get a totalSize 170 which feels like the right number (One page with both test and new in the title 133 + 38 = 171)\r\nh3.
