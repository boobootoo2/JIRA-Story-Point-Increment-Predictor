[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFCLOUD-27907].\n  {panel}\n\nHello Atlassians,\r\n\r\nI'd really like to request an increment macro.  Here is an example in a table:\r\n\r\n|increment|Apples|\r\n|increment|Bananas|\r\n|increment|Coconuts|\r\n\r\nWhen the page is parsed, it would be shown as follows:\r\n\r\n|1|Apples|\r\n|2|Bananas|\r\n|3|Coconuts|\r\n\r\nIn addition, you should be able put the increments in groups so you can have several on a page.\r\n\r\n|{increment:group=fruit}|Apples|\r\n|{increment:group=fruit}|Bananas|\r\n|{increment:group=fruit}|Coconuts|\r\n|{increment:group=veg}|Aubergines|\r\n|{increment:group=veg}|Beans|\r\n|{increment:group=veg}|Carrots|\r\n\r\nBecomes\r\n\r\n|1|Apples|\r\n|2|Bananas|\r\n|3|Coconuts|\r\n|1|Aubergines|\r\n|2|Beans|\r\n|3|Carrots|\r\n\r\nAlso, specifying a unique ID for a counter would mean you can reference an increment instance.\r\n\r\n{increment:group=list_of_presents} Teddy bear\r\n{increment:group=list_of_presents:id=my_favourite_present} Optimus Prime\r\n{increment:group=list_of_presents} Box of chocolates\r\n\r\nYou can now put:\r\n\r\n\"Please see present #{increment:value_of=my_favourite_present} which was my best ever!\"\r\n\r\nIn addition, you'd be able to attach child-increments into parents and have decimal-based numbers like 1.4, 5.3.21 etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you for your time.  Keep up the good work!  d:-)",

As described in https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Global+Permissions+Overview, members of the confluence-administrators group can't see restricted pages in {children} macros. (\"They cannot immediately see the pages that exclude them via page restrictions without knowing the direct URL to the page. ... For example, they will not see restricted pages displayed by the children macro. But they are able to access restricted pages directly using the page URL.\")\r\n\r\nI've tested this, and my members of confluence-administrators can see all pages (even pages that another user restriced to himself) - in the pagetree (Documentation Theme) and also in children macros .\r\n\r\nAs i understand the documentation, this shouldn't be possible. Can you reproduce this behavior?  \r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nSebastian H\u00f6hne",

Instead, I propose that we simply disable these attachment indexer modules by default in OnDemand.\r\n\r\nIn my experience, OnDemand customers do not commonly use this functionality. If customers do want it, they can submit a Support request to have us enable it. This would provide good information on how much it's being used and how much an effect turning it off by default would improve overall Unicorn stability and memory usage.",
