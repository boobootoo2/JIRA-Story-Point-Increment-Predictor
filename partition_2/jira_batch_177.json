      "description": "Have you ever been engaging fully in the international trading community and comprehend just how Forex and Cryptocurrencies trading works? Then you should know that there is no get-rich-quick solution or approach for this.\r\n Wondering why I am saying this? Well [Quantum Hybrid Trader|http://www.socialleadfreak.com/quantum-hybrid-trader-review/] program is trying to convince trading experts like you and I we will make thousands of dollars a day by following signals generated by using their trading robot.\r\n\r\nI am talking about, there is really a whole bunch of profits to be made in trading that's why many men and women engage fully init but who has ever earned $5000-$10000 in daily using those robots?\r\n The programmers with the dirty app may possibly believe people are fools by asserting unrealizable profit that no legit app can offer. What they do not know is that people are wiser and brighter now. No matter how conartist name, package and present their own trading apps like this Quantum Hybrid Trader software, we can smell it for what it really is, a crappy robot.\r\n\r\nQuantum hybrid dealer\r\n\r\nWhen I discovered about this particular app, it didn't use up to a hour investigate, analyze, and also conclude that it is the introduction of hungry scammers aimed at duping trading beginners in the business.\r\n Most dealers, obviously, are asking for management regarding whether there's hope with this one but from what I have gathered thus far, this software is just a total waste of time, waste of effort and a profound hole of nothingness.\r\n Ah! Don't mind that the legit-looking packaging because after looking over this Quantum Hybrid Trader review, you are going to realize that the whole issue is like a white-painted sepulcher.\r\n Quantum Hybrid Trader Scam Exposed With Proofs!\r\n\r\nMore Details: [ http://www.socialleadfreak.com/quantum-hybrid-trader-review |http://www.socialleadfreak.com/quantum-hybrid-trader-review/]\r\n\r\nQuantum Hybrid Trader is a cluttered scam system at which you can spend and invest all of your money after an artificial robot made available from thieves.\r\n Yeah! That the summary I could provide about it. The thief behind it's one name called Austin Morrison. I used a name and not just a man because that is what we have a name without any solid proof existence. You know as a human body filled with muscles and blood, a address or even a voice except for an presenter from the name of Paul Scott. The layers of concealment are a lot of for a program that is offering investment information. Is this not an evidence that these fraudsters will not rest?\r\n\r\nI'm appearing all unwanted but read on out Quantum Hybrid Trader inspection and let us analyze each red flag about it trading software.\r\n Austin Morrison doesn't exist\r\n\r\nLike I said earlier, the fools gave a name and also expect to find investment information from their website. Who's Austin and where is his base? Nobody knows since there is no company name, address or anything that could point us where we will get him. He is a fictitious character represented with a arbitrary name which doesn't have any link into trading.\r\n\r\nOh! I heard the voice from the presentation that you'll find articles specialized in Morrison in Forbes, Business Insider, along with Wall Street Journal.\r\n I looked for those articles, however I really couldn't see any, but if you'd like, you can try your luck too.\r\n\r\nWhen anonymity gets who owns a trading program, it is always a very clear sign the burglars are hiding something. Any platform where you can deposit your money needs to be transparent.\r\n If they can not actually offer that much, then, you have no business working with such crooks if you don't want to eliminate all and gain only dust.\r\n There are many exaggerated claims\r\n\r\nHave you heard with the 2 words \"big talks\"? That's what you should receive from the con artists behind the Quantum Hybrid Trader scam app. There are various claims that I would like to analyze after the other.\r\n The first one is that dealers have the chance to earn $5000 to $10000 as profits every day. Do you believe that does this sound as dumb as I watch it? Besides scam trading apps that offer massive profits on a regular basis, no regulated platform will let you know this kind of lie. Whenever you see a get-rich-quick offer, do not even think about it because it's a fraud. The ideal trading robots like Choice Robot may generate hardly 58 percent of the amount every day.\r\n\r\nexaggerated claims\r\n\r\nThe second claim is the fact that the app is incorrect but offer accurate trading signals that guide you about the instrument to exchange.\r\n Where do you have ever seen software that does not lose a commerce? According to Austin, the software is secure, and it's just a ticket to financial freedom. I wonder financially free he could be since he has the opportunity to dupe people on line. If you are a newcomer the concept of trading and not lose a single one will seem interesting but hey! It's a snare and not anything more. Thus, discount them. In fact, he strove hard to confirm that claim by saying Quantum Hybrid Trader program is designed to analyze bidding data using a wonderful frame. Ask him what that means and see if knows what they have been describing.\r\n\r\nAnother argue worth mentioning is that Austin featured in some highly professional and established media platforms such as Forbes and Business Insider.\r\n I hunted for him on the web sites but didn't observe any article related to him or his scam robot. This assert is to seem recognized and important. There's absolutely no truth whatsoever to it.\r\n [Quantum Hybrid Trader|http://www.socialleadfreak.com/quantum-hybrid-trader-review/] reviews\r\n\r\nWell, this one shouldn't become considered a surprise because every thing is really a complete lie. All the reviews you see about Quantum Hybrid Trader are imitation and also lies.\r\n Those pictures of huge amount in reviews section are stolen out of Google, and every result you visit is just a lie aimed at alerting you. One funny thing is that those reviews only appear on their own site and nowhere else (such as YouTube, Facebook or about any other blog). Sounds fishy? It is also possible to check their credibility by doing a reverse image look of any one of the pictures added under the testimonials section.\r\n\r\nFake testimonials\r\n\r\nYou can find no real folks supporting those testimonials. Maybe once you enroll and make your deposit, then you will be the first proper dealer with this scam Quantum Hybrid Trader software. Would you like to try? I really don't believe so.\r\n Contradictory Website Agreement\r\n\r\nAs soon as I came across this red flag, I concluded that the Admin is stupid or he is hoping to engage in safe.\r\n Take a little look at the disclaimer section of Quantum Hybrid Trader and notice how they admitted that what there is a imitation. Based on the same men and women who want one to make countless couple months, their presentation accounts are imitation, the results are somewhat fake, as well as the celebrities are also not on the app. Can't you note Quantum Hybrid Trader is a production of dumb fools who don't understand what they have been doing? No, tell me, can you tell your intended market that the product you're offering is really a comprehensive fake? That's to prove that they are complete nincompoops.\r\n\r\nThey are using scam agents\r\n\r\nDo you know that every broker needs to operate within government regulations? The thieves behind the program have a deal with VipWayZone, an overseas agent to fool dealers, steal their income and share one of themselves.\r\n\r\nWhy will you enrich a burglar that doesn't have any conscience or will to follow due process? If you get the mistake of depositing this particular software, you may lose every thing. Oh yes!\r\n I heard that the app is free but could it be? Just how come you have to deposit before it is possible to access the right and never-losing trading signal? Please be wise and maintain your time and effort and money safe from fraudsters.\r\n\r\nVerdict -- Avoid Quantum Hybrid Trader Scam!\r\n\r\nMore Viral Scams -- Tesler, Bit Coin Trader, Bit-coin Code\r\n\r\nFinal Words\r\n\r\nI am hoping that this Quantum Hybrid Trader review helps you in choosing right choice. It's only a dirty scam out of unscrupulous elements which will do such a thing to defraud rookie traders.\r\n Everything regarding the useless app is imitation beginning the ownership to the reviews on the site.\r\n\r\nRegardless of how excited you are to generate income through Forex trading or maybe crypto trading, you must be very wise in selecting the platform to use.\r\n Online scammers are growing daily, and if you aren't smarter than them, you eventually become a victim in these antics.\r\n\r\nSearch for a legit trading app and stick to a regulated broker that is answerable to the legislation guiding investments. Runaway from Quantum Hybrid Trader because it's reductions to provide you with.",

Neither of these issues has any commits associated with them.\r\n# Make a SVN commit with MYPROJECT-1 in the commit message, and wait for the commit to display in JIRA on the issue dev panel as expected.\r\n# *Change the commit message* in SVN. Remove MYPROJECT-1 and insert MYPROJECT-2.\r\n# Reindex the revision properties of that rev in FishEye.\r\n\r\n_EXPECTED:_ \r\n* The dev panel no longer appears on MYPROJECT-1\r\n* The dev panel and this commit appears on MYPROJECT-2\r\n\r\n_ACTUAL:_\r\n* The dev panel still appears on MYPROJECT-1 and shows \"1 commit.\" Clicking this link throws an error: \r\n_\"You don't have access to view all related commits. Please contact your administrator.\"_\r\n* MYPROJECT-2 displays 1 commit and it is this commit. As expected, clicking on the link brings up the commit and it can be viewed.\r\n\r\n*Scenario 2: \"Oops! I did it again.\" Now the commit count is wrong.*\r\n# Make a new SVN commit with a message linking to MYPROJECT-1.\r\n# *Observe and note:* MYPROJECT-1's dev panel no longer displays the error message described above, and it now displays the commit that was just sent.\r\n# *Change the commit message* in SVN to point to MYPROJECT-2.\r\n# Reindex the revprops of that revision in FishEye.\r\n\r\n_EXPECTED:_ \r\n* MYPROJECT-1 no longer has a dev panel because it has no commits\r\n* MYPROJECT-2 displays two commits, and the dev panel says \"2 commits\" at the head\r\n\r\n_ACTUAL:_\r\n* MYPROJECT-1 has a link in the dev panel which reads \"1 commit\" and an error is displayed when clicking on it:\r\n_\"You don't have access to view all related commits. Please contact your administrator.\"_\r\n* MYPROJECT-2 displays two commits as expected, but the dev panel header reads \"1 commit\"\r\n\r\nh3. *Workaround*\r\n\r\nThe fix described in [FE-6953|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/FE-6953] works to address these scenarios as well. Specifically, you can manually delete cached data from the JIRA database. \r\n\r\n{panel}\r\nFor example, if you discover that issue ABC-123 is affected (it has 1 commit but DevPanel doesn't show), you may:\r\n # Run this REST call to confirm it has 1 commit:\r\n{code:java}\r\n<FeCru_BaseURL>/rest/remote-link-aggregation/latest/aggregation?globalId=ABC-123{code}\r\n # Run this SQL query in Jira db to confirm Jira has an outdated record of it (no commit):\r\n{code:java}\r\nselect * from entity_property where json_value like '%ABC-123%';{code}\r\n\r\n{code}\r\nFor JIRA 7.9+, run this query instead:\r\n{code:java}\r\nselect * from AO_575BF5_DEV_SUMMARY where json like '%\"ABC-123\"%';\r\n{code}\r\n\r\n(+)\u00a0If the above are confirmed, it's safe to delete the db entry for it to be rewritten with up-to-date data:\r\n{code:java}\r\ndelete from entity_property where id = <ID from the above SELECT query>;\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nFor JIRA 7.9+, run this query instead:\r\n{code:java}\r\ndelete from AO_575BF5_DEV_SUMMARY where id = <ID from the above SELECT query>;\r\n{code}\r\n\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\nh3. *Notes*\r\n\r\n* These issues do not appear to occur in JIRA 7.8.1.\r\n* FE-6953 was reported as fixed in FishEye 4.5.1, but the issue described here is occurring with FishEye 4.5.2.",

Problem Definition\r\nRelated to JSWSERVER-15051 and JRASERVER-65602 \r\nJIRA will have memory pressure (and may hit OOME) in case user creates board with filter with large number of issues (20k+). This might lead to performance problems at busy instance. \r\nWhile ticket JRASERVER-65602 focuses on empty filter to prevent simple mistakes, it's possible to create filter with large result set. \r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\nCreate a new application variable _BOARD_ISSUES_COUNT_LIMIT_ (suggested default value 5000), similar to  jira.bulk.edit.limit.issue.count in jira-config.properties\r\n\r\nWhile opening any board or changing board filter, check the issues count return by board filter and compare it with BOARD_ISSUES_COUNT_LIMIT.\r\n* Display board only when it has less issues than limit.\r\n* Display warning message if condition fails and redirect users to contact Jira admins.\r\n** see also related JRASERVER-66791\r\n\r\nh3.

That makes SQL execution slow. That being said, we will keep the ticket open for some time to monitor the problem. \r\n{panel}\r\n\r\nh3. Summary\r\nAs part of Lexorank rebalancing, each rank value needs to be updated in {{AO_60DB71_LEXORANK}} table.  At the same time, individual ranking operation has _1500 ms_ timeout for rank lock. \r\nDue to slow DB operation, issue ranking operation fails to save new rank since rank lock expires.
