      "description": "{panel:bgColor=#ffe6e6}\r\nNB: This bug has been\u00a0incorrectly used as a catch-all for indexing problems, so I want to be a little clearer about the specifics of this issue.\r\n\r\n*This issue will only ever be experienced in a scenario where Confluence Data Center is used to display READ ONLY content that is almost never modified.*\r\n\r\nIn a Data Center instance, all nodes are running the indexing job at 30s intervals, despite this issue. This issue means that a node which has not had any content created or modified directly on itself, will still run the indexing job, but does not processing items in the index queue which were created by other nodes. As soon as content is created/modified on that node however, the entire index queue is processed, and all items are indexed. No content will be left unindexed.\r\n\r\nThis issue will therefore never be noticed on an instance where content is regularly created/modified. As soon as content is created/modified on subsequent nodes, ALL items in the index queue are processed. The only way this issue would be experienced in production is in an instance with almost no editing or addition of content. An instance with almost no use is not usually a good candidate for clustering, so it's unlikely an instance with little to no content modification would be using Data Center.\r\n\r\nIf you are using Data Center with almost no content modification and are experiencing this bug in production, please comment to give us some detail about your use case.\r\n\r\nIf, however, you have a normal usage pattern of both reading and writing, and you are experiencing problems with indexes not matching between nodes for more than 30s, this bug is not at fault. You are experiencing a different issue, and should [contact Support|https://getsupport.atlassian.com/].\r\n{panel}\r\nh3. Scenario\r\n\r\nA piece of content is created/modified on Node 1. It is indexed at the next scheduled index on Node 1. However, the index job runs on Node 2, and the item is not indexed. This will continue indefinitely, until a piece of content is created/modified on Node 2, at which point both the original piece of content and the new one are indexed on Node 2. However, Node 1 will not index the new piece of content until something else is created/modified on Node 1 again.\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Set up a 2 node cluster\r\n # Enable [DEBUG logging for indexing|https://confluence.atlassian.com/confkb/how-to-turn-on-debugging-for-indexing-213523707.html] on both nodes and watch the logs\r\n # Create a page on Node 1\r\n -- Observe the page being indexed on Node 1, and nothing happening on Node 2.\r\n # After a minute or so, create a page on Node 2\r\n -- Observe that *both* pages are now indexed on Node 2, but Node 1 does not get the new page\r\n # Create another page on Node 1\r\n -- Observe that Node 1 now has all 3 pages but Node 2 is missing the last one\r\n\r\n(and so on)\r\nh3.

Sample .ppt file,  [^conf - format skew-2.ppt], attached to use to replicate the issue.\r\n\r\nh5. Steps to Reproduce\r\n1. Install Confluence 5.10.8 on Windows, database type does not matter.\r\n2. Create an empty page in a space, attach the file,  [^conf - format skew-2.ppt], to the empty page. Then, insert the Office PowerPoint macro and for the File Name select the file  [^conf - format skew-2.ppt].

Besides Confluence inbuilt emoticons, we noticed it happening when there are macros of the [Talk for Confluence|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.stiltsoft.confluence.talk.confluence-talk-plugin/server/overview] add-on on the page. Talk macros are rendered as icons, which makes it similar to the case with emoticons.\r\n\r\nCould you look into this issue and improve the behavior of the new editor?\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\n\r\nKaterina Kolina",

Summary\r\n\r\nAttempting to edit a document in Office using the Edit in Office link in a Firefox 51 browser will always prompt to install the WebDAV extensions.\r\nh3. Environment\r\n\r\n(Optional - If Applicable)\r\n * Windows\r\n * Firefox 51\r\n * MS Office\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Attach a word document to a page in Confluence\r\n # Install Firefox (updated to latest version)\r\n # Attempt to Edit in Office\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nThe extension installs and the document opens in Office for editing.\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nThe extension is installed, but when you click on Edit in Office again it asks to install the extension again. You can then repeat the loop until you get bored enough to stop. See the video below:\r\n [^firefox51_webdav_install_loop.mov]\r\nh3. Notes\r\n * This currently is only affected in the latest release of Firefox (51)\r\n * Currently verified in Windows 7\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n # Use a different browser/version\r\n ** Use Edit in Office in Internet Explorer\r\n ** Uninstall Firefox 51, install [Firefox 50.1|https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/firefox/releases/50.1.0/], disable autoupdate\r\n # Disable autostart:\r\n ## Go to \"about:config\" in firefox address bar\r\n ## Search \"browser.tabs.remote.autostart\"\r\n ## Double click the entry to make the value false.\u00a0If you see \"browser.tabs.remote.autostart.x\" entries, make them false too.\r\n ## Restart firefox\r\n ## Go to \"about:support\" and make sure the value of \"Multiprocess Windows\" is \"0/1 (Disabled)\"\r\n\r\nh3. Notes for the fix\r\n * You don't have to upgrade to 6.0.7 or 6.1.0. The fix is just the firefox add-on and it is backward compatible.\r\n * The new version hosted by Mozilla\u00a0is still under review and there is no timeline for when it will be public. Thus you can not install it using standard update of Firefox at this moment.\r\n * To get it installed:\r\n ** You can download it from [here|https://update.atlassian.com/office-connector/URLLauncher/latest/webdavloader.xpi]\u00a0and manually install it\u00a0\r\n ** Or you can remove the existing add-on from Firefox and then confluence will prompt the installation.\r\n\r\n\u00a0",
