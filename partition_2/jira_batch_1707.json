This returned that there was no such table as 'confluence.bandana' \r\n\r\nThen we followed a commenter's suggestion to clear the plugin cache. We followed this article:\r\nhttps://confluence.atlassian.com/display/CONFKB/How+to+Clear+Confluence+Plugins+Cache\r\nJust two notes on this:\r\n- The article does not mention to backup directories before nuking.\r\n- The <confluence-home> was actually in /var/applicationdata instead of the assumed /opt/ directory.\r\n\r\nI hope this has been of help for your team.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nPat\r\n",

We also have to use this because it is the only option provided to have footers and headers for all pages. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, due to volume, that option has become unusable.  It takes approximately 5 minutes to even render a page when selecting the option. Then, when you select Custom Export, it takes another 5 minutes because the solution renders ALL PAGES, ALL Expanded....\r\n\r\nWe want to be able to get to our hierarchy and then display the children upon request = similar to our sidebar where we retrieve upon request. \r\n\r\nWe need a solution to help improve the performance of just trying to create a custom export; and then, address the issues of how long it takes to generate and download. \r\n\r\nRight now, our users are getting very frustrated with the performance. \r\n\r\nWe would appreciate advice on how to resolve. \r\n\r\n",
