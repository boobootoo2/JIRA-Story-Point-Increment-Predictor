We\u2019ve noticed that this has been raised as both a suggestion CONFSERVER-9443 and as a bug CONFSERVER-59931.\r\n\r\nThe main causes for the images not rendering properly are all related to the fact that in order to view attachments in Confluence, the user has to be authorised:\r\n\r\nthe user viewing the email message is not logged in\r\nthe user's email client doesn't allow for a session to be set up with Confluence for authentication purposes\r\nthe user\u2019s email client no longer has access to the attached image\r\nthe configured outgoing mail server caches images, but is unable to authorise in Confluence, and caches the 403 responses (e.g. when Gmail with the default settings is used as the outgoing mail server).\r\nWhile we don\u2019t have plans to address this currently, we will update this suggestion to be a bug as we understand that images not being viewable in the emails is not an ideal experience and can be confusing for the mail recipient. We\u2019ll also update the linked issues and the description.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nMakisa | Senior Product Manager, Confluence Server and Data Center\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\nh3. Summary\r\n\r\nImages are not shown in email notifications.\r\nh3. Steps to reproduce\r\n # Integrate Confluence with a Mail Server\r\n # Create a test user and ensure that you are watching a space. Additionally, edit the user profile settings to ensure that your mail subscriptions/email settings will ensure that you will be notified for updates.\r\n # Log in as an admin or another test user and create a blog post OR page with no restrictions in the space that your other test user watches so that they will receive an email notification.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected behaviour\r\n\r\nThe email notification would show the attached image.\r\nh3. Actual results\r\n\r\nThe notification does not display the image attached. You are able to see the content (text) of the notification email but the images are broken. Page is secured with page permissions, so requires a login to view. The images which aren't displayed are attachments on the page. Logging in with Safari and selecting \"Remember me\" doesn't make a difference.\r\nh3. Notes\r\n\r\nThe image URLs are the correct relative URLs, but the\u00a0HTML\u00a0has a <base> tag in the header.\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nIf you're using Google Apps for your organisation you may want to check [Google Support|https://support.google.com/a/answer/3299041?hl=en]. Information is provided for how you can whitelist your Confluence/JIRA base URL to allow it to show embedded images.

However, With Confluence 2.6 and Builder 3.0 we decided to start using main-action.css again as it's now much cleaner.\r\n\r\nThere are however, some items that could be cleaned up and I will create sub-tasks to this issue to list them.

      "description": "(Copied and pasted from Benjamin Naftzger [Atlassian] under CONF-8704, relogged as a bug since it is unexpected behaviour causing loss of work)\r\n\r\nThis applies to the Image-popup which apparently only gets triggered from the wysiwyg-editor. \r\n\r\nI was wondering why attaching images was failing, however it turns out we just have some rather poorly designed UI. \r\n\r\nWhen you go to add an image to an existing page, the course of action that I attempted (wanted) was to:\r\n\r\n1. Browse and select an image to attach\r\n2. Click ok\r\n3. See my image attached to the page\r\n\r\nInstead, the attach file / browse operation is presented in the middle of the screen. If I click on this and click ok, I am presented with an alert that I need to enter a filename (which also means we have two fields on the one screen referring to filenames (one remote and one local) which could be deemed as confusing and not friendly for business users). This in itself is slightly annoying and should be improved by resolving CONF-6597.\r\n\r\nBut the absolute _worst_ thing is that, if you then click OK, it closes the window and displays a broken image icon in the rich text editor.\r\n\r\nThe problem, is due to the fact that there is another button called \"Attach\", which must be clicked, before clicking \"OK\".\r\n\r\nAlso, the Attach File 'Browse' operation should be at the top of the screen, given that this is what you are actually trying to do. You want to work out which file to attach and then just attach it so no doubt this should be prioritised to the top of the screen. ",

The Xss Approach\r\nBy increasing the stack size via {{-Xss}} option let's say:\r\n{code}\r\n-Xss512k\r\n{code}\r\nThe optimal stack size is platform and JVM dependent, so some research/consulting needs to be done when  changing this value. Increasing the stack size makes is possible to resolve longer URLs, but it works only until the next limit is hit.\r\n\r\nh4. Regex Pattern Approach\r\nThe Confluence code can be modified to prevent the issue from occurring by simplifying the URL pattern. \r\n\r\nInstead of ({{confluence/confluence/src/java/com/atlassian/confluence/renderer/radeox/filters/UrlFilter.java}})\r\n{code}\r\nPURE_URL_PATTERN = \"((\" + protocols + \")(%[\\\\p{Digit}A-Fa-f][\\\\p{Digit}A-Fa-f]|[-_.!~*';/?:@#&=+$,\\\\p{Alnum}\\\\[\\\\]\\\\\\\\])+)\";\r\n{code}\r\nyou could use\r\n{code}\r\nPURE_URL_PATTERN = \"((\" + protocols + \")\\\\S+\";\r\n{code}\r\nor some similar, simple pattern.\r\n\r\nThe downside of this approach is that the matching is not as strict as it used to be which might or might not break something else - Atlassian guys, you should be able to determine this.\r\n\r\nI'm attaching a simple java app that I wrote to simulate what happens inside Confluence when this error occurs.

      "description": "'d like to report critical vulnerabilities in 3 of your macros - Column, Image, Block and Code macros.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerabilities are classified as XSS Type 2 (stored) and the details with example exploits are in the pdfs attached.\r\n\r\nBecause of similarity of the vulnerabilities assume that it is more than likely that more of your, as well as contributed plugins suffer from exactly the same problem.\r\n\r\nThe fix for all the macros is very simple, just make sure that all the user input (should it be input via body of the macro, or macro attributes) that gets injected into html is encoded or escaped.\r\n\r\nNo user input should be allowed to be interpreted as a html element or attribute (or css in the case of the Code macro). Some suggest sanitizing the input by replacing characters like \"/\\>< with a space or something similar, but such a approach is error-prone and can break usability of your products, so I suggest that you stick with encoding the output into html entities when creating the output. Atlassian has multiple utility methods that can be used for this. Check out GeneralUtil for example. (http://docs.atlassian.com/com/atlassian/confluence/atlassian-confluence/latest/com/atlassian/confluence/util/GeneralUtil.html)\r\n\r\nEvery single vulnerability should be rated as critical, because these macros can be exploited by users having write access to wiki pages, or even by users having access to creating comments. Possible exploits can lead to stealing protected information and user passwords, changing user profiles, vandalizing wiki content or even DoS attacks.\r\n\r\nBTW I looked at your JIRA issue tracker, but there is no way to submit bug reports like this without exposing them to the world. Your documentation suggests, creating an JIRA issue and setting the visibility to developers and reporter only, but this feature is not available at jira.atlassian.com\r\n\r\nJust keep in mind that the macros that I mentioned in this tickets are only 4 out of 5 macros that I tried to break. Due to time constraints I didn't test the rest of the macros, but I hope that you'll do so because I'm sure that there are more vulnerabilities in those macros.\r\n\r\nbtw the Dynamic Task macro v2 (the new one) is also vulnerable, I reported that to Jonathan Nolen\r\n\r\nI also found multiple vulnerabilities in Create Page macro from Adaptavist.

      "description": "When entering the first character into the {livesearch} search box, an exception is thrown, which is displayed in the results area of the macro (it is the standard \"A system error has occurred - our apologies! \" error message). After entering the second character everything is normal and I can see the usual list of matches.\r\n\r\nThe confluence website is very large, probably a few hundred MByte of text. I tried the same {livesearch} macro on confluence.atlassian.com and it does not throw an exception even though I think your site has even more text.\r\n\r\nThe installed Confluence release is 2.5.3, but it is heavily modified. It is fully possible that this problem is caused by missing or modified properties, or by other side effects of the customisation. However I am not sure how to attack this problem.\r\n\r\nMy guess so far is: On entering the first character, for example an \"e\", the lucene search attempts to execute a \"e*\" wildcard search which returns so many matches that some limit is exceeded. But then why does this not happen on confluence.atlassian.com which should also have a large number of matches for this particular search?\r\n\r\nIs there a way to start the search only after at least two characters have been entered?\r\n\r\nMaybe the livesearch JavaScript code is supposed to suppress such exceptions, but the code does not work as expected in our environment, the error message is not suppressed but displayed to the user.\r\n\r\nHere is the full exception:\r\n\r\norg.apache.lucene.search.BooleanQuery$TooManyClauses\r\n at
