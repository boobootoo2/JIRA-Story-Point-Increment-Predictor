Please feel free to review and edit it.\r\n\r\nThis issue is a request to do the same change in the previous Confluence version spaces as they're locked for editing. I think we only need to do it for version 3.4 - 4.3 (CONF34 to CONF43 Spaces) as 3.3 and lower are already EOL-ed, but I'll leave it that to you guys.",

      "description": "h1. Problem\r\n\r\nWhen documentation theme is enabled in both IE9 and Firefox, the user can't select only a part of the content from a page and choose the \"Selection\" option in the Print dialogue. Firefox yield white pages, while IE9 yields only the first page of the selection. \r\n\r\nIf the documentation theme is disable, IE9's \"Print Selection\" is perfectly as expected and Firefox's \"Print Selection\" is printed, but there's an offset which is equivalent. \r\n\r\nh2. Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nIn order to reproduce the problem, first enable the Documentation Theme for the Confluence instance (Confluence Admin > Look and Feel > Themes > choose \"Documentation Theme\") and then: \r\n\r\nWith Firefox: \r\n\r\n# browse a Confluence page\r\n# drag the cursor through text, in order to select it for printing\r\n# do Firefox > Print\r\n# in the Print dialogue, select the option \"Selection\"\r\n\r\nWhatever the length of the selected text is, the output will be only blank pages, with Firefox header and footer. \r\n\r\nWith IE 9: \r\n\r\n# browse a longer Confluence page (that would contain more than one printed page)\r\n# drag the cursor through text, in order to select text that will need more than one page once printed\r\n# do File > Print\r\n# in the Print dialogue, select the option \"Selection\"\r\n\r\nOnly the first page of the selection is printed (Page 1 of 1), the rest is discarded. \r\n\r\n*Without the Documentation Theme*:\r\n* IE9's \"Print Selection\" is perfectly as expected.\r\n\r\n* Firefox's \"Print Selection\" is printed, but there's an offset which is equivalent.\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround \r\n\r\nPreview the document and manually determine which pages the user wants to print (but still, don't get ONLY the text wanted). \r\n\r\nAttachments to better understand it below.\r\n",

Workaround\r\n\r\nThe underlying issue was partially resolved in Confluence 3.5.11, so the warning message does not occur for many csv files uploaded in Confluence 3.5.1.0 or above. However, any csv files that were uploaded in versions older that Confluence 3.5.11 will still have the incorrect Content-type, as do some csvs that were uploaded post 3.5.11, and when Confluence performs a re-index those warning messages still occur.\r\n\r\n*To fix the Content-type and resolve the warning message for older documents, you will need to run this command against your database:*\r\n{code}\r\nUPDATE PUBLIC.ATTACHMENTS SET CONTENTTYPE = 'text/csv' WHERE TITLE LIKE '%.csv' AND CONTENTTYPE LIKE '%excel%';\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nFor more information, please see [this KB article|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/CONFKB/com.atlassian.bonnie.search.extractor.ExtractorException%3A+Error+reading+content+of+Excel+document].\r\n\r\nh4. Resolution\r\nThis issue is resolved in Confluence 6.0.6. To get the fix, upgrade to that version.\r\n\r\nNB: The fix contains two parts - an upgrade task that changes the 'media_type' for *all* csv attachments to 'text/csv', no matter what they were previously, and a change to intercept save on any csv attachment and enforce media_type of 'text/csv'. If for any reason the upgrade task needs to be run again (eg after a space import which has attachments with incorrect media_types, it can be run manually by going to <your-confluence-url>/admin/force-upgrade.action, and selecting 'CorrectCsvAttachmentMimeTypeUpgradeTask'.",
