      "description": "Currently the XML backup of active objects data stores the data based on the physical schema specific to the database from which is was exported. This means that the import of the data into a different database which supports different data types could result in a type conflict.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\nPostgres supports the boolean type but Oracle does not. If we attempt to write a null value to the Oracle database and specify it as type boolean, an error will be thrown.\r\n\r\nTo avoid this the data should be first converted into logical types before being stored in the XML file. This will mean it will be possible to convert the data types back to the appropriate physical type depending on the destination database.\r\n\r\nThis issue has led to previous bug:\r\nhttps://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONF-28272",

The feature could be improved by ignoring those special characters when typing and filtering (as it is for example not so cool to type those on a english keyboard). For example:\r\n\r\nWe have a user with the name 'C\u00e9line'. When I do enter know 'Cel' Confluence does not propose me 'C\u00e9line' as it appears that the characters must match exactly. It would be nice that C\u00e9line gets proposed even though I am just entering a normal e instead of the \u00e9.\r\n\r\nI am not sure if my proposal is clear but in SQL this is related to the collation.\r\n\r\nThanks for listening and have a nice day!",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFCLOUD-28720].\n  {panel}\n\nWe heavily use macro \"containers\" like the Numbered Headings plugin, and I noticed that page version comparisons don't seem to present the same \"terse\" delta of changes within a \"container\" that it does with content outside of a container.\r\n\r\nFor a decently large page where much of the content is inside a container, targeted changes end up with version comparisons distributed by email that are very hard to skim to understand the often small set of changes.  The same holds for comparisons pulled up in the Confluence web site.\r\n\r\nI established a test page for this that included a block of content that was at the top level of the page, a block of content inside an \"Info\" macro, and a block of content inside a NumberedHeadings macro.  After making a targeted change to each block, a version comparison tersely presents the delta for the top content block (that wasn't contained in a macro), while it includes the entirety of the two containers.\r\n\r\nIf my memory serves, an older version of Confluence might have had a \"jump to next difference\" set of anchor links on the left hand side, so re-introducing something like that could help mitigate this, but I would also think that it is probably reasonable to just show the same focused delta view within a container.\r\n\r\nI created a sample page in a Sandbox wiki space in my install.  I exported that page to the attached SANDBOX-120416-2.xml.zip, and I also attached a screen capture of the page contents itself, and a screen capture of the diff. I just changed the word \"fox\" to \"dog\" in each of its 3 occurrences on the page.\r\n\r\n_NOTE: I had originally brought this up under the Atlassian Answers forum, and hence the following thread could be commented on at https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/151202/suggestion-question-about-breakdown-in-terse-version-comparisons as this issue moves through its lifecycle._",

      "description": "h4. We have been unable to reproduce this error message, except when the mail server is misconfigured:\r\n\r\nThis error message is the result of no authentication mechanisms returned from the mail server. Exchange doesn't provide authentication mechanisms when using plain connection, or when only anonymous connection is supported.\r\n\r\nThe solution is to *establish a TLS connection when authentication mechanisms are supported, _or_ to remove the username and password from the mail server configuration when only anonymous connection is supported*. We weren't seeing this problem before the upgrade from javamail-1.4.1 as it would silently assume anonymous connection when no authentication mechanisms are matched.\r\n\r\nIt's preferable to correct the mail server config rather than programmatically retrying without credentials every time mail is sent, so I'll update the log message (shown in the Confluence UI when sending test email) with better troubleshooting information.\r\n\r\nWe have had reports of these workarounds not working, but unfortunately haven't been able to reproduce such a scenario yet. If this is the case for you, please raise a [support request|https://support.atlassian.com/secure/Dashboard.jspa] so that we can investigate further.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nh4.

Atlassian Connect 1.0 [was released in March 2014|http://blogs.atlassian.com/2014/03/introducing-atlassian-connect-1-0/], and you can already get access to [more than 50 public add-ons today built using the platform|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/search?application=&category=&cost=&hosting=cloud&marketingLabel=].\r\n \r\nDue to stability and scalability reasons, we will not bundle additional third party add-ons with our Cloud offerings. But you should feel free to contact the vendors of your favourite add-ons to let them know that you would like them to create a Cloud version of the add-on! We will do our best to work together with the vendor to satisfy this request.\r\n \r\nSince we have no plans to bundle additional add-ons in Cloud, we are closing this issue.\r\n \r\nCheers,\r\nBartek\r\nJIRA Product Management\r\nbartek (at) atlassian (dot) com\r\n{panel}\r\n \r\n \r\n*Original request description:*\r\nPlease bundle [Flowdock for Confluence|https://plugins.atlassian.com/plugin/details/37109] plugin.",

Confluence OnDemand uses this configuration.\r\n# Users sometimes cannot load remotely hosted content, either in the editor or when viewing pages. Affected content can include (but is not limited to) Skitch or OpenPhoto embedded images, gadgets or CloudApp shared files.\r\n# Remote services are available.\r\n# Confluence logs contain warning messages from org.apache.commons.httpclient.SimpleHttpConnectionManager \r\n{noformat}\r\nSimpleHttpConnectionManager being used incorrectly.  Be sure that HttpMethod.releaseConnection() is always called and that only one thread and/or method is using this connection manager at a time.\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nh3. Details\r\n\r\nHttpClient requires that its HttpMethod.releaseConnection method is called for it to fully release the underlying resources and allow configuring correct proxy settings for the connection. When the caller fails to call this method, the message above is logged by org.apache.commons.httpclient.SimpleHttpConnectionManager at the WARN level.\r\n\r\nConfluence wraps this in a HttpResponse.finish method, but this is only ever called in the BaseHttpRetrievalMacro. Every other use of HttpResponse in Confluence (core or bundled plugin) needs to release its connection correctly too.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nA possible workaround for this issue is to use the same proxy settings for all remote connections, and to ensure that the proxy can reach all required hosts.",
