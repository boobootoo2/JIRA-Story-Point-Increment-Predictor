Default space templates differ from ordinary page templates in that they do not present the user with a form to complete, so variables should be limited to those listed above.\r\n\r\n(Source - [Customising Default Space Content|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Customising+Default+Space+Content?focusedCommentId=405046471#comment-405046471])\r\n\r\nIt feels like a pretty serious limitation to me. If custom fields can be prompted when creating a new page within a space, why can't there be custom fields when creating a new space? I'd argue that sometimes it's even more useful. Because every space is usually attached to a project, it makes sense to speed up project bootstrapping by providing coworkers with a form that requests things like:\r\n* Project URL (e.g. test server, production server, etc.)\r\n* Brief project description\r\n* JIRA URL (though it's a shame I have to manually assign links between JIRA and Confluence every time, jumping between the two within the same project should be easier)\r\n\r\nAnd use that information to generate a more useful space homepage. \r\nThis would obviously be faster than first creating a homepage with default contents, hitting edit and inserting information into appropriate places inside the page (which can be long).\r\n\r\nBut besides speed considerations, it would also be a mechanism to *require* people fill out some minimal project information when starting.

As documentation says that we need to do upgrades incrementally across major version, but that is the following exception. So we would fix by adding this message:\r\n\r\n{quote}\r\nThe only exception to this rule is if you are upgrading from 3.5.x to 5.0.x or above, and you have file system links in your pages. In this case, we recommend that you go directly to 5.0.3 from 3.5.x.\r\n\r\nFor more information see: CONF-23575\r\n{quote}\r\nAs site note, we already added the message [here|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Upgrading+Confluence].\r\n\r\nFor the Tech Writers, do you guys agree about having a note there? If yes, could please apply to the previous versions?",
