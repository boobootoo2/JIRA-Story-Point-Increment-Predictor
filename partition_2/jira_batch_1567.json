Currently, there are no preview of all available groups/user and the search feature for the groups/user is not smart enough to detect the full group/user name if the user input is a substring of the name. \r\n\r\nFor example: In a Confluence instance with the following groups: hr group, finance group. If a user types \"group\" in the Add People field of the search dialog, Confluence will not retrieve the above groups as options the user can choose from. The user must start his search with \"finance\" in order for Confluence to retrieve finance group as one of the options.\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n* Given a Confluence instance that has the following groups: finance group, hr group\r\n** Navigate to a page and then click \"Share\"\r\n** In the panel, under Add People, type group\r\n\r\n !Screen Shot 2018-06-12 at 10.16.49 PM.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nConfluence will give a list of all groups that has the text \"group\" in it. \r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nConfluence does not retrieve any group. \r\n\r\nh5. Improvement Suggestions:\r\n# Make group search \"smart\" enough to be able to retrieve all groups that has a particular sub-string from the search parameter.\r\n# Display all groups in the dropdown for easy access.\r\n\r\n",

Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nIn the Health Check section, add a scanning tool similar to the one below:\r\n * [https://www.atlassian.com/blog/archives/scanning-confluence-for-content-errors]\r\n\r\nWhile this script is useful, it is quite old and is not reliable for finding problems with attachments references, for example. Also, it uses the deprecated APIs, so the built-in tool could rely on REST to check the content while having all features that this existing script provides.\r\nh3. Why this is important\r\n\r\nThis would be very important for companies that rely on Confluence to release large document sets alongside their software releases. Since we don't have a scanning tool, the admins need to manually search for problems in order to fix them. This is not scalable and almost impossible based on the number of pages.",

So I assume that Confluence is trying to delete the page before deleting the JsonContentProperty. As JsonContentProperties are stored as custom content, I assume the issue appears with other types of custom content as well. I can reproduce the issue with Confluence 6.0 until 6.7 (didn't test any other versions).\r\n\r\nDeleting the JsonContentProperty makes it possible to delete the page again.\r\n\r\nOne strange discovery that I made is that the issue doesn't come up if I run {{pageManager.deepCopyPage()}} with the page (without copying content properties) after creating the content property. I haven't been able to narrow down why this is, but I assume it is somehow connected to the transaction magic that is happening there.",

Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Install Confluence with normal SQL auth\r\n # Completed setup\r\n # Change to integrated security\r\n # Remove username and password entries from *confluence.cfg.xml*\r\n # Add the path to *sqljdbc_auth.dll* to Confluence and Synchrony system properties\r\n # Change owner of the service to the Windows account\r\n # Start Confluence (and Synchrony manually if running DC)\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nBoth Confluence and Synchrony start as expected and are able to connect to the database.\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nSynchrony does not start and this is the error thrown in *atlassian-confluence.log* with *com.atlassian.confluence.plugins.synchrony* set to DEBUG:\r\n{code:java}\r\n2018-05-30 15:14:45,373 WARN [synchrony-interop-executor:thread-1] [plugins.synchrony.bootstrap.DefaultSynchronyProcessManager] lambda$startProcess$1 Failed to setup Synchrony, turn on debug for stack trace: null\r\n2018-05-30 15:14:45,373 DEBUG [synchrony-interop-executor:thread-1] [plugins.synchrony.bootstrap.DefaultSynchronyProcessManager] lambda$startProcess$1 \r\njava.lang.NullPointerException\r\n    at java.util.Hashtable.put(Hashtable.java:460)\r\n    at java.util.Properties.setProperty(Properties.java:166)\r\n    at com.atlassian.confluence.plugins.synchrony.bootstrap.DefaultSynchronyProcessManager.setupEnvironment(DefaultSynchronyProcessManager.java:343)\r\n{code}\r\nh3. Notes\r\n\r\nNotice that *setupEnvironment* is mentioned, this is the method that retrieves the database connection settings for the Synchrony JVM. Here is the code snippet from *DEFAULTSYNCHRONYPROCESSMANAGER.JAVA*:\r\n{code:java}\r\n        env.setProperty(SynchronyEnv.JdbcUrl.getEnvName(), connectionUrl);\r\n        env.setProperty(SynchronyEnv.JdbcUser.getEnvName(), credentials.getLeft());\r\n        env.setProperty(SynchronyEnv.JdbcPassword.getEnvName(), credentials.getRight());\r\n        env.setProperty(SynchronyEnv.JwtPublicKey.getEnvName(), (String) config.getProperty(JWT_PUBLIC_KEY));\r\n        env.setProperty(SynchronyEnv.JwtPrivateKey.getEnvName(), (String) config.getProperty(JWT_PRIVATE_KEY));\r\n        String internalBaseUrl = computeInternalBaseUrl();\r\n        if (!serviceUrl.equalsIgnoreCase(internalBaseUrl)) {\r\n            serviceUrl = Joiner.on(\",\").join(serviceUrl, internalBaseUrl);\r\n        }\r\n        env.setProperty(SynchronyEnv.ServiceUrl.getEnvName(), serviceUrl);\r\n        return ImmutableMap.<String, String>builder()\r\n                .putAll((Map) env)\r\n                .build();\r\n{code}\r\nSynchrony should check that the integrated Windows Authentication is in use and not look for the username and password in this situation. It should only fetch the credentials on *confluence.cfg.xml* when normal SQL authentication is in use.\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n # Add this two lines back to *confluence.cfg.xml*:\r\n{code:java}\r\n<property name=\"hibernate.connection.password\">dummy</property>\r\n<property name=\"hibernate.connection.username\">dummy</property>\r\n{code}\r\n\r\n # Restart Confluence and Synchrony should start as expected\r\n\r\n(!) Notice that the username and password lines don't need to be valid, they just need to be present in the file to avoid the NullPointer.",
