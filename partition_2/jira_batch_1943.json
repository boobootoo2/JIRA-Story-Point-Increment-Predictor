Blog comments and no page comments would be fine as a quick fix so long as it was configurable at the space and not global level.  \n\nSo far, I can't find any way to make Confluence distinguish between the two.  Either a user has permission to comment or they don't.  The trouble is, I don't want silly comments littering up places of my site where they add no value.  I had hoped that simply locking the page would be enough to prevent a user from commenting, but the lock doesn't appear to apply to comments.  As such, I've had to disable the commenting permission entirely in order to prevent babble, and that reduces the value of the Blog feature.\n\nAm I missing a configuration option somewhere?  If not, I hope this distinction can be added to a release in the very near future.  Thank you.",

They come through the first time, but then seem to cache- I am assuming that this is to do with some kind of content cacheing?\n\nSteps to replicate:\n1. insert a table of Jira issues eg:\n{jiraissues:url=http://mydomain.com.au:8080/secure/IssueNavigator.jspa?view=rss&pid=10019&resolutionIds=-1&resolutionIds=4&sorter/field=updated&sorter/order=DESC&tempMax=25&reset=true&decorator=none&os_username=balh&os_password=blah|columns=summary;status;assignee;res;updated;priority}\n\n2. Click through to Jira and change status/close/delete/make a new issue that should appear in that filtered view\n\n3. go back to the original confluence page, edit, and copy & repeat the {jiraissues: ... tag, but change something in the string eg: tempMax=30\n\n4. I now get 2 similar tables of Jira issues, but the second will show the updated tasks\n\n\nI'm not sure if I'm being impatient here :) or is there a cacheing property that we can change to prevent this?",

      "description": "{panel:bgColor=#e7f4fa}\r\n*2017-Jun-13:* Hello friend! You\u00a0probably\u00a0stumbled upon this issue after\u00a0trying to create two pages with the same\u00a0name in a Confluence space and the system complained. Bummer, right? It's okay, breathe. We've all been there. We've moved on. ;)\r\n\r\nWay way back\u00a0in 2004, the\u00a0Confluence wiki I setup under my desk was being adopted by *thousands* of people at Cisco, so I heard this frustration\u00a0*a lot.*\u00a0I created this\u00a0issue to suggest an alternative, and lots of folks chimed in with ideas.\u00a0\r\n\r\nAtlassian is a\u00a0*great company*\u00a0that does listen, and\u00a0in Nov 2011 Sherif Mansour, the Confluence Product Mgr chimed in to put this issue to rest. (see below)\r\n\r\nIt's time to [let it go|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moSFlvxnbgk&feature=youtu.be&t=56s]. :)\u00a0\r\n\r\n-Tim Colson\r\n{panel}\r\nh2. Problem Overview\r\n\r\nWiki page names must be *unique* within a space. This makes organization painful if a space contains similar topics, e.g. \"Meeting\" pages for multiple teams or projects within a single space.\r\n\r\nUpdate 2008-Jul-11: Tim updated this description to be more succinct, readable and incorporate some ideas from the three and a half years of comments below.\r\n\r\n_Update 2017-Jun-13: Tim added a quick note to let folks who want this feature know they should \"[let it go|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moSFlvxnbgk&feature=youtu.be&t=56s].\"_ :)\r\nh2. History\r\n\r\nIn December 2004, Tim Colson noted many user questions with respect to creating pages with the same name under different \"parents\". Tim brought the topic to the Atlassian mailing list where it was suggested that a Jira case would allow people to vote on the improvement if it was important to them relative to other issues.\r\n\r\nPlease vote for this improvement if you think it would be beneficial.\r\nh2. Proposal\r\n\r\n_*NOTE:* This proposal is at a high level. Obviously this problem does not have a simple solution and there are many use cases that must be carefully considered before implementing such a significant change._\r\n\r\n*Request:* Confluence should allow pages with the same name in a space *if* they have different \"parent\" pages.\r\n\r\nFor example, two \"Status Report\" pages could exist if they are for separate project teams:\r\n{code:java}\r\nANC:Q&A Testing Team/Status Report\r\nANC:Development Team/Status Report\r\n{code}\r\nWhere ANC is the space key, Q&A Testing Team and Development Team are pages and BOTH have a child page, \"Status Report\".\r\nh2. Additional Considerations\r\n\r\nSearches for \"Status Report\" would return both results, and would need to also display the hierarchy context so the user could pick the page.\r\n\r\nLinks would need a _fully qualified name_ *if* there is more than one \"Status Report\" page, perhaps using \"/\" as a divider, in similar fashion to traditional website links.\r\n{code:java|title=Fully qualified page name link}\r\n[Q&A Testing Team/Status Report]\r\n{code}\r\nNew and existing links to the *non-qualified name* (i.e. [Status Report]) would trigger one of two actions:\r\n 1) if saving a page, Confluence could validate and ask the user to select the correct alternative\r\n 2) if clicking an existing link that has become ambiguous - the user could be prompted, \"This page name is not unique, please select the correct link from these options: <list>}\r\nh2. Advantages\r\n\r\nWith this feature page names can be re-used in the hierarchy and navigation will be improved because there will no longer be a need for duplication of the parent name which creates long and redundant \"breadcrumbs\" and page titles, e.q.:\r\n\r\n*Current unique name restriction*\r\n Dashboard > Q&A Testing Team > Q&A Testing Team Status Report\r\n Dashboard > Development Team > Development Team Status Report\r\n\r\n*Improved version, no unique restriction*\r\n Dashboard > Q&A Testing Team > Status Report\r\n Dashboard > Development Team > Status Report\r\n\r\n*Summary:*\r\n Enabling non-unique page names through the use of \"namespaces\" would improve space organization, breadcrumb navigation, and PDF/HTML exports of page hierarchies.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n Timo\r\n{panel:title=Atlassian Status as of 1st November, 2011|borderStyle=solid|borderColor=#3c78b5|titleBGColor=#3c78b5|bgColor=#e7f4fa}\r\nHi everyone,\r\n\r\nFirstly, thanks for your helpful feedback on this ticket. On behalf of the Confluence team please accept our apologies for allowing this issue to remain open for some time without any Atlassian feedback.\r\n\r\nThis issue has been open for quite some time because we would really like to address this issue in Confluence. However, after looking at it in depth and discussing it internally and with external plugin developers, we've realised we won't be able to make this change to the product.\r\n\r\n*Why have we taken so long to respond to this?*\r\n With the upcoming release of Confluence 4.0 and a move to a unified editing experience, we wanted to make sure that we have exhausted all possible options to resolve this issue. As we discovered, it is much more difficult to implement than we would have hoped for with significant consequences touching every plugin, macro and every link that is in Confluence.\r\n\r\nWhen Confluence was designed initially, it shipped with the idea of \"spaces\" as a container for wiki pages related to one area of your organisation. The name \"space\" was an intentional allusion to \"namespace\", the word used by other early wiki software to indicate a group of pages where each has a unique name. This didn't seem like an unreasonable restriction; you can have as many spaces as you like, and it allows the user interface to remain simple - you can find or identify a page in a particular space simply by its title.\r\n\r\nSince then, a huge amount of development has taken place in and on Confluence with the assumption that a space key and a page title uniquely identify a page in the wiki. As Guy mentioned below, breaking this assumption would require thousands of changes to areas as wide ranging as macro parameters, APIs used by plugins, remote APIs and page list UIs. Not only would a change like this impact the large majority of plugins create and every plugin developer, but we believe this change would also have an unreasonably large impact on our end users. Every non-trivial plugin that ran in Confluence would be broken by a change to the fundamental way that you retrieve pages. Every piece of content would have to be updated for the new macro parameters, requiring an extremely long upgrade process. Many operations that require the simple selection of a page by name would have to be redesigned to account for the fact that multiple pages in a space can share the name, complicating the use of the product for all our users.\r\n\r\nWe know that many of you are asking \"but what about the suggestions on this issue\"? We've spent some time looking at all of them (and several other options). The most realistic solution would have been the \"page hierarchy in the page name\" option. However, this also has several significant implications:\r\n * It causes major confusion between parent/child hierarchies and namespaces: (Page called Foo/Bar with parent called Foo, move it to a different parent but it's still called Foo/)\r\n * Pages that might otherwise naturally have a slash in their title: (Create a page called \"Website A/B Testing\". Becomes page called \"B Testing\" in namespace \"Website\r\n * This solution would still require hundreds of UI updates everywhere a page is selected, searched for or displayed. (When do you display the full qualified title? When to do you just display the post-slash title? etc...)\r\n\r\nIn general, implementing any of the the options would come with a very large cost to the product roadmap as well. All work on other aspects of the product would have to stop for a long time in order to implement this, blocking our ability to continue to deliver improvements and other feature requests you have raised.\r\n\r\n*If we're not going to implement this feature, what will we do instead?*\r\n We still believe that organising large amounts of content is one of the main features of Confluence and we need to improve this experience. To that end, we're planning to work in the following areas that help with this problem:\r\n * scaling to larger numbers of spaces.\r\n * managing large number of spaces more easily (link to issue)\r\n * improvements to the page tree to better support organising content in large spaces\r\n * introducing the ability to create template page hierarchies (--CONF-2814--)\r\n\r\nThank you again for your long-standing interest and feedback on this issue. I can assure everyone that this was not a decision we took lightly. We're confident that the improvements we have planned will address these issues in the best way for all our customers.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n Sherif Mansour\r\n Confluence Product Manager\r\n smansour at atlassian dot com\r\n{panel}\r\n{panel:title=Timo says goodbye...}\r\nAfter nearly seven years waiting for a reply, it comes to an end.\r\n\r\nThere is a tradition amongst the Old Guard IT guys at Cisco to write a haiku when something moves on....\r\n\r\n_Same Named Pages_\r\n _Lively you were from O' four._\r\n _Seven years on...gone._\r\n\r\n(I'll need to write a haiku for wiki markup next... ;) )\r\n{panel}",

We have decided to close this issue as something we can't see ourselves doing in the foreseeable future, and I wanted to take a moment to explain why. \r\n\r\nConfluence has gone on quite a journey since the early days as an enterprise wiki - we're always a little in awe of the many wonderful and varied ways Confluence is used. In the past few months, we've done a lot of soul searching about the future direction of Confluence. We've researched how our customers use Confluence today and identified ways we can better serve all Confluence users.  We're determined to improve Confluence as platform for all teams, but have decided to concentrate our efforts specifically on helping teams collaborate on software and IT projects.  \r\n\r\nGlobal find and replace can be used in many situations, but we know the main requirement for this feature is for producing and publishing technical documentation. Focusing our development effort on helping software and IT teams collaborate means that this, and other features more typically found in help authoring and publishing tools, won't be making it onto our roadmap.  This doesn't mean that Confluence is no longer a great platform for producing documentation and we hope many teams will continue to use Confluence to write and collaborate on their internal and external documentation.\r\n\r\nWe have a vibrant and growing ecosystem of add-on developers, some of which are already developing fantastic add-ons to extend Confluence for the world of technical documentation.  In the spirit of openness and transparency, we wanted to clearly communicate that we won't be implementing global find and replace in the foreseeable future and are happy to offer up this feature for vendors in our ecosystem to implement.  We have already begin working with some vendors to see what can be done in this space. \r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nSherif Mansour\r\nConfluence Product Manager\r\nsherif at atlassian dot com\r\n{panel}",

Couldnt create the database schema. \njava.lang.NullPointerException at \ncom.atlassian.confluence.setup.ConfluenceHibernateSetup.configureDatabase(ConfluenceHibernateSetup.java:84) \nat com.atlassian.confluence.setup.ConfluenceHibernateSetup.configureDataSourceDatabase(ConfluenceHibernateSetup.java:61) \nat com.atlassian.confluence.setup.actions.SetupDatasourceDatabaseAction.execute(SetupDatasourceDatabaseAction.java:60) \nat com.opensymphony.xwork.DefaultActionInvocation.invoke(DefaultActionInvocation.java:171) \nat com.atlassian.confluence.setup.actions.SetupCheckInterceptor.intercept(SetupCheckInterceptor.java:27) at\n\n\n\nWhat's wrong?\nIt is WASv5.1 product's bug. Here is the code snippet of Confluence web.xml:\n\n<listener>\n        <listener-class>bucket.container.ContainerContextLoaderListener</listener-class>\n</listener>\n\n\nWhen confluence application startup, Web Container should initial ContainerContextLoaderListener.java and call contextInitialized method to create SpringContainerContext.\nBut there is fatal bug in WASv5.1, WAS web container only can initialize classes which you explicitly declare implements ServletContextListener. \n\nIf you code like this:\npackage bucket.container;\n......\npublic class ContainerContextLoaderListener\n        extends ContextLoaderListener{\n           ....\n        public void contextInitialized(ServletContextEvent event) {\n              .....\n        }\n           ....\n}\n\n\nWebSphere will not initialize this class & its' method contextInitialized.\n\nHow to resolve this issue?\n\nAdjust the listener like below:\npackage bucket.container;\n......\npublic class ContainerContextLoaderListener\n        extends ContextLoaderListener\n           implements ServletContextListener{\n           ....\n        public void contextInitialized(ServletContextEvent event) {\n              .....\n        }\n           ....\n}\n\n\nTry it, you will resolve such problem.",

This would allow the macro to clean up any properties, etc which it had stored against the page/space/whatever.\n\nI'm guessing this won't be too simple to add, however. The only way I could think of is to scan the diff to see if a {macro} has is no longer included. Problems which may occur are:\n\na) typos (either new or corrected ones).\nb) how do you tell if it's a start or end macro marker (may be solved with V2 renderer).\nc) what happens if someone just modifies a macro's parameters? Should the macro be notified?\n\nAnyway, it would be an incredibly useful addition, if it can be done. Otherwise, as macros become more complex, you will end up with lots of garbage hanging around the system.",

Let's say we name it \"Home of \u010d\u017e\u0161\" (without quote marks).\n3. Go to the dashboar.\n\nIn the \"Your Spaces\" portlet, there are two ways of accessing the space's home page. One is a link the \"Space (Key)\" column, another is the home icon in \"Operations\" column. Second method works, as the URL has been changed to \"webapp style\", e.g. http://example.com/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=99. The first method sends you to space URL (e.g. http://example.com/confluence/display/PES, where PES is the space key), which then redirects you (via HTTP 302) to the \"wiki style\" URL, in this case http://example.com/confluence/display/PES/Home%2Bof%2B%25C4%258D%25C5%25BE%25C5%25A1). \n\nThe problem with this URL is that it does not conform to RFC 2396, paragraph 2.4.1. In practice, this screws Apache's mod_proxy big time.\n\nI suspect that in the first method the URL went twice through URLEncoder. Java's URLEncoder encodes \"Home of \u010d\u017e\u0161\" as \"Home+of+%C4%8D%C5%BE%C5%A1\". That would explain why letter \u010d is encoded as %25C4%258D instead of %C4%8D.

I think a standalone version of your presentation would show them the light.\"\n\nAnd from a sales email:\n\n\"do you have a guide or something similar, that explains how to work with a wiki? (something like a process description, that defines how many people work on the same pages, how to see what changed, how to aviod conflicts...)\"\n\nSome kind of step by step presentation that works as a graphical walk-through of Confluence's features, explaining how and why you would use them would be good for our users, and probably also a good sales tool.",

When a comment is deleted, it's placed in this trash, and a \"view deleted comments\" link appears in the page operations bar. Space admins can view/purge/restore these comments per page.\n\nTrashed comments do not show up in the space-level trashcan (too much clutter), except as a count at the top (also 1234 deleted comments), and an option for additional purging (Purge all... (Including comments)).\n\nThe existence of a comment trash should be optional (and default to off), as it imposes an unnecessary manual management burden on the general use-case, which is that comments are ephemeral and their deletion not really much of an issue.",
