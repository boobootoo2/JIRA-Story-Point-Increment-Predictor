Guy Fraser from Adaptavist also has a comment on this system problem which I will add to this issue.)\r\n\r\nProblem:\r\n\r\nThat is, the repository is not correctly showing that new plugins are available for all relevant plugins it lists. In this case, the new CB 1.1rc1 plugin is listed but there is no upgrade link. And, the only way to upgrade this plugin (and some others too) via the repository is to first uninstall the plugin and then reinstall it (1.1rc1 is then the version that is listed for installation).\r\n\r\nAtlassian said that it may have something to do with metadata being upload or not by developers but I think something else might be broken in the PR plugin itself.\r\n",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFCLOUD-14144].\n  {panel}\n\nI urge you to develop a standalone GUI executable (i.e. Swing) that can configure our servers, so we can handle all Confluence configuration without having to open a single .xml, .properties, or .out file. Things like connection strings, LDAP, license hash, logs, etc.\r\n\r\n75% of the problems we've had with Confluence have involved some sort of config file issue, and it's been a complete nightmare to figure out which file does what. To make matters worse, even though we have a lot of Linux servers, people at my company have very little Java and Tomcat expertise (don't ask).\r\n\r\nIdeally, between a nice install wizard and this standalone configuration GUI, I would never need to know a thing about Tomcat, Java, XML, etc. and would never need to fire up PuTTY or struggle with vi.\r\n\r\nHaving a separate GUI-based configuration program would also solve the \"bootstrap\" issue, where Confluence needs to be working in order to make certain changes to Confluence.\r\n\r\nAtlassian could avoid a lot of support costs if you had a tool like this. A lot of the issues we've needed to contact Atlassian support for could have been avoided had we had an easy-to-use Microsoft-like config GUI. (Microsoft SQL Server is a particularly good example.)\r\n\r\nIf I get some time, maybe I can mock up a UI.\r\n\r\nThanks for listening,\r\nBill",

This is to differentiate between a user's session before they have logged in and after they have authenticated and have a valid authenticated session on the server. At the moment the JSESSIONID value is the same for when a user first navigates to the site and after they have authenticated. There is a small chance that a hacker etc. could spoof a user's session and masquerade as them on the site once the user has authenticated.\r\n\r\nWe recently had a penetration test performed on our Confluence installation and this was raised as an issue, however small.\r\n\r\nMatt\r\n",

The only way to go about doing this is to go to the user's profile page, right click on his profile picture, copy the image location, and then embed the profile picture as an image in the page. Not only is this time consuming and inelegant, the image on the page doesn't get updated when the user updates his/her avatar.\r\n\r\nWe make it easy to link to a person's profile page by typing \\[~username]. Perhaps we could embed a profile image with a macro like \\!~username!. If we're going to make Confluence 3.0 more people-centric it might be an opportune time to introduce this enhancement.\r\n\r\nThis seems to be a very common use case as seen in the following EAC pages:\r\n* http://extranet.atlassian.com/display/MAR/Home\r\n* http://extranet.atlassian.com/display/PS/Pre-Sales+Team+Home\r\n* http://extranet.atlassian.com/display/INTSYS/Internal+Systems+Home\r\n",

I haven't confirmed this but a user has reported it in 2.10.\r\n\r\nThe rename workaround is undocumented but apparently already used by the Doc importer ( http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Navigating+to+the+Doc+Import+Option ). It will split a Word document into multiple Confluence pages based on headings, but if there are two headings that are the same, it'll create two pages with the same name, and they'll be identified with a \"pageId\" instead of by the name. \r\n\r\nWhile you can't add a page with a duplicate name via XML-RPC, you can rename an existing page to a duplicate name. To reproduce:\r\n\r\n{code}\r\n# create page 1\r\npage1 = {'content': 'some content', 'title': 'test', 'space': 'TEST'}\r\nres1 = xmlrpc.confluence1.storePage(token, page1)\r\n\r\n# try to create page 2 with same name, as sub page of page 1\r\npage2 = page1.copy()\r\npage2[\"parentId\"] = res1[\"id\"]\r\n# fails with com.atlassian.confluence.rpc.RemoteException:\r\n# The page you are trying to create already exists.\r\n\r\n# give it a unique name and create\r\npage2[\"title\"] = 'test2'\r\nres2 = xmlrpc.confluence1.storePage(token, page2)\r\n\r\n# rename page 2 to same as page1 name\r\nres2[\"title\"] = page1[\"title\"]\r\nres2 = xmlrpc.confluence1.storePage(token, res2)\r\n{code}\r\n",

A good practice would be to include the master scripts and the -min versions in the source, but let the production release use only the -min versions.\r\n\r\nYou can find the YUI Compressor here:\r\nhttp://developer.yahoo.com/yui/compressor/",
