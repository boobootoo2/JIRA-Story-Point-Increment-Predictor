[See the corresponding bug report|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFCLOUD-47192].\n  {panel}\n\nh3. Summary\r\nAnonymous/Limited users may see private questions (questions that are linked to a private space) in the _Popular_ tab or in _Topics_ counters.\r\n\r\nNote: Limited users are users without permission to view the private space that contains questions.\r\n\r\nh3. Environment\r\n* Confluence 5.8.18 \r\n* Questions plug in 2.4.11\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# *Prepare test scenario*:\r\n## enable anonymous user\r\n## add several global questions\r\n## answer them while they are still global and unrestricted\r\n## create a private space\r\n## create and configure a limited user (no view access to the private space)\r\n## restrict visibility of the private space\r\n## move one answered question to the private space\r\n## leave at least one global question as it is\r\n## create a new question and answer it in a private space (same topics as before)\r\n## add the topic \"private\" to all questions that belong to a private space\r\n\r\n* Test *Symptom #1* - anonymous/limited users see private questions on _popular_ tab:\r\n*# log in with anonymous or limited user\r\n*# navigate to questions and observe popular and recent questions tabs\r\n\r\nActual results (anonymous user): In the Popular tab, the anonymous user sees questions that belong to a private space. Clicking on a restricted question redirects the user to the login page. See attached screenshot for example:\r\n !anonymous_view_popular_tab.png|thumbnail! \r\nActual results (limited user): In the Popular tab the limited user sees questions that belong to a private space. Clicking on a restricted question redirects the limited user to a \"Page Not Found\" page.\r\n\r\nExpected results: neither anonymous nor limited users should see questions/answers that belong to a private space. This seems to work as expected in the Recent and Unanswered tabs. See attached screenshot for example:\r\n !anonymous_view_recent_tab_OK.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\n* Test *Symptom #2* - anonymous/limited users see topic counters that include private questions when browsing questions by topic:\r\n*# log in with anonoymouse or limited user\r\n*# navigate to questions > Topics\r\n*# Click on \"private\" topic\r\n\r\nActual results (anonymous/limited users): Even though the \"private\" topic has a counter indicating a number of questions greater than 0, clicking on that topic leads the user to a potentially empty page. See attached screenshots below for an example of \"private\" topic leading the user to an empty page:\r\n !anonymous_view_private_topics_counter_01.png|thumbnail! \r\n !anonymous_view_private_topics_counter_02_empty_page.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\nExpected results: The topic counter should not lead users to empty pages. Ideally the counters would include only questions that are visible to the current user.\r\n\r\nh3. Notes\r\nWhen anonymous/limited users click on the private question link, they are prompted for credentials or redirected to a \"page not found\". Therefore, this bug report was raised with \"Minor\" symptom severity.\r\n\r\nh3.Workaround\r\n\r\n* Create the questions directly in a private space to avoid symptom#1 (symptom #2 still happens).\r\n* I could not find a way to \"fix\" view permissions whenever symptom#1 is observed.\r\n\r\n",

      "description": "h3. Symptoms\r\n\r\nAnswered questions restricted for a space are duplicated when viewing it by Expert. The issue happens only when Confluence is configured over MS SQL Server.\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n# Create a question in Confluence Questions and restrict it for *any space*.\r\n# As a different user, answer it.\r\n# It appears correctly displayed (just once).\r\n# However, when you go to at the \u201cAnswers\u201d tab for the person answering the question, the one answer is duplicated.\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Diagnosis\r\n\r\nMS SQL Server uses the following SQL query to generate the list of answered question in the question tab:\r\n{code}\r\nselect * from (\r\n  select distinct \"answer\".\"CONTENTID\", \"answer\".\"CREATIONDATE\", row_number() over (order by \"answer\".\"CREATIONDATE\" desc) as \"rn\"\r\nfrom \"CONTENT\" \"answer\"\r\njoin \"CONTENT\" \"question\"\r\non \"answer\".\"PARENTCCID\" = \"question\".\"CONTENTID\" and \"answer\".\"PLUGINKEY\" = 'com.atlassian.confluence.plugins.confluence-questions:answer'\r\nleft join \"SPACES\" \"SPACES\"\r\non \"question\".\"SPACEID\" = \"SPACES\".\"SPACEID\"\r\nleft join \"SPACEPERMISSIONS\" \"SPACEPERMISSIONS\"\r\non \"SPACES\".\"SPACEID\" = \"SPACEPERMISSIONS\".\"SPACEID\"\r\nwhere \"answer\".\"PREVVER\" is null and \"answer\".\"CONTENTTYPE\" = 'CUSTOM' and \"answer\".\"CONTENT_STATUS\" = 'current' and \"answer\".\"PLUGINKEY\" = 'com.atlassian.confluence.plugins.confluence-questions:answer' and \"answer\".\"CREATOR\" = '<USERKEY>' and (\"question\".\"SPACEID\" is null or \"SPACEPERMISSIONS\".\"PERMTYPE\" = 'VIEWSPACE' and (\"SPACEPERMISSIONS\".\"PERMGROUPNAME\" is null and \"SPACEPERMISSIONS\".\"PERMUSERNAME\" is null or \"SPACEPERMISSIONS\".\"PERMUSERNAME\" = '<USERKEY>' or \"SPACEPERMISSIONS\".\"PERMGROUPNAME\" in ('<ALL_THE_USER_GROUP>')))) a where rn > 0 and rn <= 20 order by rn\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nThe query is selecting the distinct combination of the 3 column (CONTENTID, CREATIONDATE , row_number()). The row_number() function basically assign a number to the selected row. Since this number is always distinct, the combination of the three column will always be distinct which result in the duplicated result. \r\n\r\nThe issue does not occur in the MySQL, for example, because it rely on limit to limit the number of selected row:\r\n{code}\r\nselect distinct 'answer'.'CONTENTID', 'answer'.'CREATIONDATE'\r\nfrom 'content' 'answer'\r\njoin 'content' 'question'\r\non 'answer'.'PARENTCCID' = 'question'.'CONTENTID' and 'answer'.'PLUGINKEY' = 'com.atlassian.confluence.plugins.confluence-questions:answer'\r\nleft join 'spaces' 'spaces'\r\non 'question'.'SPACEID' = 'spaces'.'SPACEID'\r\nleft join 'spacepermissions' 'spacepermissions'\r\non 'spaces'.'SPACEID' = 'spacepermissions'.'SPACEID'\r\nwhere 'answer'.'PREVVER' is null and 'answer'.'CONTENTTYPE' = 'CUSTOM' and 'answer'.'CONTENT_STATUS' = 'current' and 'answer'.'PLUGINKEY' = 'com.atlassian.confluence.plugins.confluence-questions:answer' and 'answer'.'CREATOR' = '<USERKEY>' and ('question'.'SPACEID' is null or 'spacepermissions'.'PERMTYPE' = 'VIEWSPACE' and ('spacepermissions'.'PERMGROUPNAME` is null and `spacepermissions'.'PERMUSERNAME' is null or 'spacepermissions'.'PERMUSERNAME' = '<USERKEY>' or 'spacepermissions'.'PERMGROUPNAME' in ('<ALL_THE_USER_GROUP>')))\r\norder by 'answer'.'CREATIONDATE' desc\r\nlimit 20\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\n* Do not restrict the question for a specific space.\r\n* Use a different database, but MS SQL Server",
