[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFCLOUD-9332].\n  {panel}\n\nI have created a user macro which mimics the regular confluence loginform on a normal page (I needed this to allow login via a space which is using Adaptavist Theme builder). It is a simply copy of the html login form + a parameter to the return page when logged in:\r\n\r\n{code}\r\n<form method=\"POST\" action=\"login.action\" name=\"loginform\">\r\n  <div align=\"center\"><div style=\"width: 500px;\"><div style=\"text-align: left;\">\r\n    <br>\r\n    <div class=\"form-header\">\r\n      <p>Enter your account details below to login to the A-Server Customer Portal.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"form-block\">\r\n      <p><div class=\"steplabel\" style=\"width: 150px;\"><u>U</u>sername: </div><input type=\"text\" name=\"os_username\" tabindex=\"1\" accesskey=\"U\" size=\"30\"><br/></p>\r\n      <p><div class=\"steplabel\" style=\"width: 150px;\"><u>P</u>assword: </div><input type=\"password\" name=\"os_password\" tabindex=\"2\" accesskey=\"P\" size=\"30\"><br/></p>\r\n      <p>\r\n        <div class=\"steplabel\" style=\"width: 150px;\"><input type=\"checkbox\" name=\"os_cookie\" id=\"os_cookie_id\" value=\"true\" tabindex=\"3\"/></div>\r\n        <label for=\"os_cookie_id\" accesskey=\"r\"><u>R</u>emember my login on this computer</label>\r\n      </p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"form-buttons\">\r\n      <input id=\"loginButton\" name=\"login\" type=\"submit\" value=\"Log In\" tabindex=\"4\"/>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"os_destination\" value=\"/pages/viewpage.action?spaceKey=CORP&title=$param0\"/>\r\n   <div class=\"form-block\">\r\n     <div style=\"float:right;\">\r\n       <p><a href=\"/forgotuserpassword.action\">Forgot password?</a></p>\r\n     </div>\r\n   </div>\r\n   </div></div></div>\r\n</form>\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nusage: {code}{loginform:returnpage}{code}\r\n\r\nI also copied the css to theme builder custom css. The form works perfectly fine unless I type a wrong password.\r\nWhen this happens I get a *HTTP Status 405 - HTTP method POST is not supported by this URL* (from Apache Tomcat/5.5.15)\r\nIs there a way to evade this problem and send the user to a page which shows the loginform again and tells the user that he entered a wrong password? Or could this loginform macro be added as a new feature with some more possibilities, like a parameter were you can tell the form where to go when something went wrong?\r\n\r\nthx",

So simulaneously the same user can be hitting the cluster via the load balanced hostname in one window of firefox, and in another window be not logged in in another window of firefox on the same box. This state can be maintained also (one firefox window can be adding anonymous comments, while the other window is editing pages in the same cluster as a logged-in user). To recreate this you may have to hit one of the nodes directly and click login (I forget if I did that or just went to the load balanced hostname).\r\n\r\nThis seems like a bug, but maybe it is just a byproduct of the way that firefox does things.

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFCLOUD-9269].\n  {panel}\n\nThere are getting to be more and more ways to create and edit pages in Confluence using third party plugins, WEBDAV, imports, as well as the builtin RTF and wiki markup modes.  Recently WordDAV was added to the mix.  Each method has its merits and drawbacks as well as ideosyncracies, so they don't play well together in the same page under many circumstances.   Just switching back between RTF and wiki markup modes has been known to cause havoc.\r\n\r\nI suggest what I hope to be a minor improvement that enables users who create pages more control over which method can be used to edit a page in order to avoid conflicts between editing techniques, causing reformatting errors,  wiki markup ceasing to function, or markup being inadvertently removed from the page.  It could be especially helpful to novices in certain environments\r\n\r\nFor RTF vs wiki markup, a user could set a new property of the page being edited that future edits would have to be done only with a particular method RTF or Wiki Markup.  The creator (and revisor ?) could also prohibit the remote API from updating a give page.  (The property would also prevent switching between editing modes.)  For 3rd party plugins, it probably becomes more difficult without the plugin author cooperating to implement a new feature, but the idea is the same.  For pages that are generated or edited through the remote API from such software as the Word AddIn, there would need to be a way for detecting (and setting ?) what was permissible.\r\n\r\nAn administrative enhancement might even allow global and space administrators to set a property that determines which method(s) are permitted by default.\r\n\r\nThis improvement could potentially mitigate many problems users are having by enabling them to work around issues instead of Atlassian trying to identify and fix many open issues that are currently in this Editing issue section one by one.",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFCLOUD-9268].\n  {panel}\n\nThe search capability of Confluence is starting to fall behind that offered by many commercial knowledge products.  In particular there is no ability in Confluence to specify synonym rings (a ring is a set of terms which have equivalent meaning - a term meaning a word or a phrase).  This is useful for many reasons in particular knowledge domains (for example a user could enter either an acronym or its equivalent long form or other predefined synonym into the search box and the indexed Content Entity Objects would return documents that contain any of them).  Also there is no ability to predetermine that certain Content Entity Objects  are always matched to particular search terms in order to guarantee that desired content is returned if someone uses a particular search term.  There are no extensions employed by Confluence to allow search to provide faceted search capabilities (for example, see [http://drupal.org/project/faceted_search] or SOLR )\r\n\r\nThese features are important to enhancing the functionality of knowledgebases and providing users with more fine tuned search capability that, if used skillfully, are more likely to produce useful and quick access to content for the average non-technical user without having to be a search query guru.\r\n\r\nThese features should be implemented in search in such a way that they can be configured per space or globally and that plugins such as metadata and advanced search can take advantage of the added features, being able to extend or modify their behavior for particular purposes.\r\n\r\nFinally, there should be the option to index rendered wiki pages such that wiki markup is never shown to the user in search results.\r\n\r\nMake custom metadata (ala metadata plugin) capability and metadata reporting/searching an integrated part of the base Confluence product\r\n\r\nIncorporate these features into the Remote SOAP interface.\r\n\r\nThe features should be configurable primarily by either site and/or space administrators depending on scope.\r\n\r\nSome of these features have various open source implementations that are demonstrated or have become commercial products.  Products such as Sharepoint 2007 and others have implemented some of these features or are rumored to be adding them in the near future.\r\n\r\nNote: I was reminded that this is probably too broad for a feature request.  I apologize for that.  I just wanted to tie a lot of related aspects of the search improvements I was requesting together (as a wish list).",

Please see attached Excel sheets summarizing the {color:red}current behavior{color} and the {color:green}required behavior{color} for [single-byte|^Character requirement (single).xls] and [double-byte|^Character requirement (double).xls] Japanese strings.

This would especially be great for Confluence installations with public signup enabled. For example, taking Atlassian's own Confluence - there is nothing to prevent users from signing up with a username such as \"atlassian\", or \"atlassian.sales\", or \"atlassian.staff\", etc (not to mention rude words). Similarly with full names - there is nothing to prevent a user from changing their name to \"Atlassian Staff\" and such.\r\n\r\nAs far as I can tell, the only ways that the problem can currently be avoided for usernames are either disabling public signup, or painstakingly creating users with disallowed usernames (not ideal as they would count toward licenses - also a problem if a 'disallowed' username authors content before it is picked up).\r\n\r\nFor full names the problem is even worse, as anybody can change their name at any time and there is nothing preventing multiple people from choosing the same name. For example, 20 people could all change their full name to \"Atlassian Support\" regardless of whether they work at the company or not.\r\n\r\nThe blacklist should be ignored for administrators, perhaps with a warning/confirmation screen if their choice of username/full name is picked up by the blacklist.",
