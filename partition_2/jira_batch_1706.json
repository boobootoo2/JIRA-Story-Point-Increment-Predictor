[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFCLOUD-32832].\n  {panel}\n\nYo guys!\r\n\r\nSorry to say thous hard words, but: Your editor sucks! No really, I like the concept of confluence, I like the way it is connected to JIRA and step for step every bit of our documentation is moving to confluence. \r\n\r\nBUT!\r\n\r\nWriting an article, especially a technically one with a lot of code snippets, sucks! How can I write several lines of monospaces code?\r\n\r\nLook here: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2721576/demo.mov\r\n\r\nOr even worse, just try to make a list and get the spaces right ... everytime!\r\n\r\nThe best thing you've done recently to improve the editing experience in confluence is the new _Page Layouts_ feature. I think the reason why it's so awesome, is that you can always predict what's going on, because it is clearly visible.\r\n\r\nIt's like the editor im using right now here in JIRA: If I wanna write {{some monospace}} I just put some of these brackets {} here and they are clearly visible until I hit the blue (preview) button down there.\r\n\r\nThis is predictable behaviour and this is why writing {{markdown}} is getting so much attention right now: Predictability instead of Microsoft Word.\r\n\r\nSo please Atlassian, add the best {{markdown}} editor of all times to Confluence and make you product score in its core discipline! \r\n\r\n!https://raw.github.com/dcurtis/markdown-mark/master/png/208x128.png!\r\n\r\nThanks, Markus",

I would like to modify them by doing simple things like arrows, boxes, lines circles, etc. to enhance a particular piece of the pic.  This is great when editing documents that will be used as tutorials or guides.  Adding other things would be nice like being able to darken the image except for the circle or rectangle that you have selected to better enhance your point in the image, etc.  Again I really appreciate how easy it's to use confluence and how little time it takes to create great looking documents and such so this would be icing on the cake.",

I eventually restarted and downloaded the completed git, and discovered that the code you had written was for 5.1.4, although there are indications that the tutorial was updated for 5.3, and if you start the plugin as described in the \"Simple\" tutorial you will be using 5.4.  I believe (though I'm not sure, since the working code in the git uses 5.1) the problem is that the code tries to subclass a blueprint class that isn't there in 5.4, so it wouldn't work.  However, I can't be sure, since there's no version information in the tutorial.\r\n\r\nAs pretty much a Java newbie, I want to point out that Java is a language with very complex structures of files and dependencies, and in a case like this it is virtually impossible to figure out what the problem is.  You really need to indicate to your users which versions work with the code in the tutorial, so learners (and who else would be using a tutorial?) can have some hope of understanding whether they've made some mistake that needs to be tracked down, or there's a version problem.\r\n\r\nI noticed that the pom.xml file in the downloaded code specified the Confluence version, and Maven automatically downloaded that and built to it.  You could provide a step to modify the POM (to specify a Confluence version) so that the tutorial user can be sure she is using a version of the Confluence code that works with the code in the supplied tutorial.",

Just think how discouraging it must be to have to tell their customers 'No!' and turn them away day after day, I've got a lump in my throat just thinking about it... \r\n\r\nIt would be best to be able to purchase licenses in 10-packs but, if that's too much trouble,100-packs would be at least reasonable and somewhat in line with our needs. :-) \r\nThanks!\r\nChris",

I understand from that issue that there is some debate about whether this is Confluence's issue or a browser issue.  Let me explain my experience.\r\n\r\n# I take a picture with my iPhone, it displays it the correct way up\r\n# I email it to myself, Gmail displays it the correct way up\r\n# I accidentally import it into my Google Drive, it displays it the correct way up\r\n# I download it to my Mac, it display it the correct way up\r\n# I import it into Confluence, it displays it the wrong way round\r\n# I start writing this ticket, and have an idea or two...\r\n# I access it in Chrome using a file:// URI, it displays it the right way up\r\n# I boot a Windows 7 VM and ping it over there, it displays it the right way up (perhaps a file:// URI in IE6 would be the nail in the coffin?)\r\n\r\n\r\n{panel:title=Atlassian Status as of February 14, 2017|borderStyle=solid|borderColor=#3C78B5| titleBGColor=#3C78B5| bgColor=#E7F4FA}\r\n\r\nHi All,\r\n\r\nThank you for your feedback on this issue thus far. This is certainly an issue which has done its round on the internet over the years for many browser and application vendors alike, with each pointing the finger at each other as to whether the application or browser should observe the EXIF rotation metadata.\r\n\r\nThe obvious solution is for all browsers to support the 'image-orientation' CSS, however after many years this is still only supported by Firefox.\r\nWe have explored no less than 6 different solutions to this issue as each brings pros and cons in terms of performance, behaviour and complexity.\r\nAs a result of this exercise, it has been decided that image rotation would be done server side based on the EXIF rotation metadata.\r\n\r\nThe actual implementation is somewhat different for Server and Cloud deployments, and thus the rollout/delivery may occur at different times, however is high up in the queue right now.\r\n\r\nConfluence Product Management\r\n{panel}",
