Note\r\n* For this fix to work you need to set *\"Disable empty JQL queries set\"* to +ON+.\r\n* Please note that fix in JRASERVER-65602 would partially fix the current problem.

      "description": "h3. Summary\r\nWhen the Release Hub page for any version is loaded at least once, it will register a cache named {{com.atlassian.jira.plugin.devstatus.releasereport.column.devtool.DevelopmentWidget.issueHtml.English (United States)}}.\r\n\r\nEvery time a new issue is loaded on the \"Backlog\" view of an Agile board, it will trigger an event that requires existing Development Summary caches to be removed, so that new ones can be generated with new content. However, due to a malformed URL, result of not escaping the above cache name, the removal of this cache is not replicated across nodes in a Data Center installation.\r\n\r\nWe are unsure about the impact of this problem, as we couldn't replicate any caching inconsistency. However, the logs are spammed with messages similar to the below.\r\n\r\n{noformat:borderStyle=solid|borderColor=#6A8EB3|bgColor=#F8F8F8}\r\n2016-09-28 16:41:09,011 devstatus.dvcs.bitbucket:thread-9 ERROR admin 1001x2629x1 1lf8hnp 0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1 /rest/dev-status/1.0/issue/summary [c.a.j.cluster.distribution.JiraCacheManagerPeerProvider] Looking up rmiUrl //localhost:40002/com.atlassian.jira.plugin.devstatus.releasereport.column.devtool.DevelopmentWidget.issueHtml.English (United States) through exception . Urls are not well formed. Please fix this.\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nIn that log entry, we can see the URL for the remote cache peer is {{//localhost:40002/com.atlassian.jira.plugin.devstatus.releasereport.column.devtool.DevelopmentWidget.issueHtml.English (United States)}}, which is clearly invalid due to unescaped spaces.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Behavior\r\nProperly escape spaces on cache peer URLs or ensure caches do not have spaces in its name.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Behavior\r\nWhen building URLs for caches, JIRA does not escape the URL properly and causes occurrences of {{java.net.MalformedURLException}} when listing remote cache peers for replication of caches.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Install JIRA Data Center;\r\n# Create an application link with any Development Tool. I did with Bamboo and Bitbucket Cloud;\r\n# Create a new project of type *Scrum software development*;\r\n# Under that project:\r\n## Create one or more issues;\r\n## Create one or more versions;\r\n# Access the *Releases* page of that project and click any version;\r\n# Go to the *Backlog* page of the project and click any version, which will trigger the error;\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\nTo avoid spamming the logs, disable logging for that specific class following the below instructions:\r\n# Go to *Administration > System > Logging and profiling*;\r\n# Under *Default Loggers*, click *Configure logging level for another package*;\r\n# Input the below details:\r\n||Package name|com.atlassian.jira.cluster.distribution.JiraCacheManagerPeerProvider|\r\n||Logging Level|OFF|\r\n# Click *Add*;\r\n\r\n(!) This change will be lost upon a restart. To persist this setting across application cycles, follow the below steps:\r\n# Edit the {{log4j.properties}} file, located under {{<[JIRA_INSTALL|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/JIRA+Installation+Directory]>/atlassian-jira/WEB-INF/classes}};\r\n# Locate the section named {{CLASS-SPECIFIC LOGGING LEVELS}} and add the below lines to the top of the list under that section;\r\n{code:none|borderStyle=solid|borderColor=#6A8EB3|bgColor=#F8F8F8}\r\n# Workaround for JRA-62638\r\nlog4j.logger.com.atlassian.jira.cluster.distribution.JiraCacheManagerPeerProvider = OFF\r\nlog4j.additivity.com.atlassian.jira.cluster.distribution.JiraCacheManagerPeerProvider = false\r\n{code}\r\n# Restart JIRA;",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSWCLOUD-14982].\n  {panel}\n\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nIf you create a board based on a jql query the issues that are displayed come from many projects. The board configuration then mentions \"The projects in this board cannot be listed because of the complexity of the board filter\"\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\nIn such a configuration, the sidebar only mentions Kanban board/Reports/Invite your team but not any of the other links that you usually have on a board.\r\n\u00a0\r\nIf the query returns only one (or a few) projects, bug\u00a0JSW-13650\u00a0is\u00a0applicable; but when the query is returning many jira-projects then JIRA cannot automatically deduce\u00a0what needs to be shown. In such a situation, the Board configuration must contain options so that the board designer can specify what needs to be shown.\r\n\u00a0\r\nAt the minimum the shortcut list must be configurable. Best also if the board dropdown list can be reused to link to other boards.\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nExample: specialisation across development teams.\r\nAcross the JIRA projects a specific subtask can be used (eg \"infrastructure subtask\"); or issues can be labled with \"performance\"\u00a0.\r\nDevelopers with that specific skillset need to (also) work across the teams. Hence they want a board showing all issues that eg require such a specialist to work on.\r\n\u00a0\r\nFor such a board the releases link probably makes no sense as it would end up showing the\u00a0releases of the entire company. But the board can contain shortcuts to sites that are frequently used by performance devs.\r\n\u00a0\r\nExample 2: Make a board to have an overview for a business program with all showstoppers / with all ongoing stories.\r\nJQL: epic_link= \"my epic\" and type=bug and priority=Blocker\r\nJQL: epic_link = \"my epic\" and sprint in opensprints()\r\n\u00a0\r\nWhile the issues may be scattered across the enterprise, the 80/20 rule dictates that most are inside a few JIRA projects. So it makes sense that next to the icon/name of this blocker-board\u00a0there are links to the core-related\u00a0JIRA boards.\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0",

Actual Results\r\n\r\nThe Sprints follow the order in which their SPRINT IDs and if populated, their SEQUENCE IDs follow\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n{noformat}\r\njira=> select * from \"AO_60DB71_SPRINT\" where \"NAME\" like '%TSSI%';\r\n CLOSED | COMPLETE_DATE | END_DATE | ID |     NAME      | RAPID_VIEW_ID | SEQUENCE | STARTED | START_DATE | GOAL\r\n--------+---------------+----------+----+---------------+---------------+----------+---------+------------+------\r\n f      |               |          | 33 |    Sprint 1   |            30 |          | f       |            |\r\n f      |               |          | 34 |    Sprint 2   |            30 |          | f       |            |\r\n f      |               |          | 35 |    Sprint 3   |            30 |          | f       |            |\r\n f      |               |          | 36 |    Sprint 4   |            30 |          | f       |            |\r\n(4 rows)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{noformat}\r\nThe above table shows the Sprints prior to being started and reordered in the Backlog. Notice there is no SEQUENCE ID populated for any of the Sprints.\r\n{noformat}\r\njira=> select * from \"AO_60DB71_SPRINT\" where \"NAME\" like '%TSSI%';\r\n CLOSED | COMPLETE_DATE | END_DATE | ID |     NAME      | RAPID_VIEW_ID | SEQUENCE | STARTED | START_DATE | GOAL\r\n--------+---------------+----------+----+---------------+---------------+----------+---------+------------+------\r\n f      |               |          | 36 |    Sprint 4   |           30  |       35 | f       |            |\r\n f      |               |          | 34 |    Sprint 2   |           30  |       36 | f       |            |\r\n f      |               |          | 33 |    Sprint 1   |           30  |       34 | f       |            |\r\n f      |               |          | 35 |    Sprint 3   |           30  |       33 | f       |            |\r\n(4 rows)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{noformat}\r\nThe above table shows the Sprints after being reordered. You will notice that the Sprints all have SEQUENCE IDs populated now which fall in line with their updated position in the overall order of Sprints. After starting all of these Sprints the SCRUM UI would render them in this order:\r\n{noformat}\r\nSprint 3\r\nSprint 1\r\nSprint 4\r\nSprint 2\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{noformat}\r\nh3. Feature Request\r\n\r\nIt would be extremely helpful if it was possible to do one or all of the following within the SCRUM UI Backlog:\r\n - Reorder Sprints once they have been started\r\n - The ability to change the SEQUENCE ID of each Sprint\r\n - The ability to see the SEQUENCE ID in relation to the SPRINT ID\r\n - JIRA ordered solely based on the SEQUENCE ID and did not take the SPRINT ID into consideration in this case",

Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Install JIRA 7.2.0 or 7.2.1\r\n # Create sample Scrum or Kanban Project\r\n # Navigate to Board -> Active Sprints or Board -> Kanban Board depending on type\r\n # Click on one of the Issues there\r\n\r\nh4.

People will see only the information that they have permission to see. This includes OAuth and Trusted Applications authentication.\r\n{quote}\r\nTake the following example: (I tested this with JIRA 6.2.6 and Confluence 5.4.4. Impersonation is *enabled* in Confluence's incoming OAuth authentication)\r\n# Lets say I am trying to link a Confluence page in a JIRA issue via the Link Confluence page option.\r\n# I have User_A in JIRA and User_B in Confluence.\r\n# As User_A, I click on the \"authenticate\" button in JIRA to authenticate with Confluence.\r\n# I log in as User_B. \r\n# Token is approved and I can now link the page without problems.\r\n\r\nIn this case, how does enabling Impersonation make any difference ? The docs say that we should be authenticating *as User_A*, because *that is the user that I am currently logged in as in JIRA*. User_A has no token in confluence because the token was approved for User_B anyway. \r\n\r\nAs a test, I disabled user impersonation again, and the behavior is *exactly* the same as having it enabled.

Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nShow the total number of all builds that have a commit referencing the JIRA issue.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, add text to the link for clarity: \"1 build of the latest commit\"\r\n\r\nAlternatively, add a \"?\" icon which explains the meaning on hover or click.\r\n\r\nh3. Detailed Explanation\r\n\r\nTested with JIRA 6.3.15, Stash 3.10.2 and Bamboo 5.9.3\r\n\r\nTo display builds JIRA uses the same definition that Stash does to display builds associated with a pull request.  From the Stash documentation, [Checks for merging pull requests|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/STASH/Checks+for+merging+pull+requests]:\r\n{quote}\r\nSelect this option to stop pull requests from being merged if they have any unsuccessful builds. _For a pull request, this checks builds that run against the latest commit on the source branch._ (emphasis added)\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nThe number of builds shown in JIRA is builds of the last commit of that branch.  This makes sense in a pull request context because each commit is a different state of the code and only the final state of the code will be merged.  When a build is triggered these variant builds can be run in parallel, resulting in multiple successful builds of the same version of the code.\r\n\r\nIn the JIRA issue context the total number of builds referencing the JIRA issue would be more useful.  This gives a relative idea of how much activity has occurred for the issue.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nMorgan Knicely\r\nAtlassian Premier Support - Austin, TX\r\n",

Here's what I did, as far as I can remember:\r\n\r\n1. I had 3 issues with 3 BitBucket pull requests associated with them, visible through the Development panel on the Issue page.\r\n2. I accepted the pull requests into the {{develop}} branch. The Version page showed no warnings, as no issue was under review any longer.\r\n3. I created another pull request to merge {{develop}} into {{master}}. BitBucket detected the issues as being associated with the pull request.\r\n4. The Version page showed 3 warnings, saying that there are unmerged pull requests.\r\n\r\nAt this point, hovering over \"Under Review\" for each issue on the Version page showed a popup stating that there is 1 pull request. Clicking \"Under Review\" reveals 2 pull requests, one of which is the original pull request for the issue, and the other one is the one from {{develop}} into {{master}}. On the Issue page for any of the 3 issues, similar behaviour could be observed: the \"Development\" panel shows 1 pull request with status \"Open\". Clicking it reveals 2 pull requests, one of which is the {{develop -> master}} pull request with status \"Open\" and the other one is the original issue pull request with status \"Merged\".",

We know it's been a while since this suggestion was raised and we're sorry to have kept you so long without a clear answer.\r\n\r\nYour feedback has really helped us better understand the varied challenges you face with inability\u00a0to see branch information in the list\u00a0of commits in the development panel. Despite our lack of communication, this problem is actually one of those areas we plan to improve in Jira. Right now we've decided to prioritise it on our roadmap.\r\n\r\nThank you again for all your feedback on this suggestion and we look forward to providing you with more updates as we work on improving user experience\u00a0of the\u00a0Development panel.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\n Anton Genkin\u00a0| Product Manager - Integrations\r\n{panel}\r\nThis was requested to be entered as an improvement per [https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Viewing+the+Code+Development+Information+for+an+Issue?focusedCommentId=457704004#comment-457704004]\r\n\r\nAfter conversion to the new Development panel with upgrade to Jira 6.2, the Commits tab no longer shows (since we are connected to GitHub, which is expected). The old Commits tab, however, listed the branch name in the commit detail view. The new Development tab does not list the branch name along with the commit in the commits detail overlay. This was extremely valuable information, since not all of our branches follow the \"feature branch\" format (for example our \"prerelease\" and \"bugpatch\" branches). For those branches that are not tagged with the issue number, we now can no longer tell which branch the commits have been pushed to, since that information does not show up anywhere in the Development panel. As a side note, our QA department used the Commits tab in this manner: Click on it in one issue, go through the list of open stories for testing to see which branches things were on. Because the \"last selected\" tab was automatically selected when opening another issue, that allowed QA to flip through the issues with minimal interaction. That is now also not possible with the Development panel, as you must click on the commits link in every issue in order to view the information.\r\n A configurable flag to *also* show the Commits tab would be an acceptable improvement, but showing the branch identifier in the Commits detail list is really a better improvement (although more clicks, we have other ways to flip through the list)\r\n\r\n*JIRA Version v 6.1.7*\r\n !screenshot-1.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\n*JIRA Version v 7.1.2*\r\n !screenshot-2.png|thumbnail!",
