      "description": "h2. Problem summary\r\nThe JIRA Issues Macro can fail to render in Confluence when a contains special characters that are not XML-safe. This issue was discovered when such a character was found in a field provided by a third-party JIRA plugin. While in JIRA this issue displays fine, Confluence was not able to render the issue.\r\n\r\nConfluence should sanitize invalid XML characters so that the macro is not impacted by characters it cannot render.\r\n\r\nh2. Steps to reproduce\r\n# Install JIRA 7.2.7 + Install Confluence 6.0.7 and create an Applink between the two apps\r\n# In JIRA, install [Zephyr for JIRA|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.thed.zephyr.je/server/overview] plugin\r\n# Create a project and a new issue of type \"Test\"\r\n# In the issue, add the following to the \"Test Step\" field (provided by Zephyr), which is the [special character|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Unicode_characters] representing \"Shift-In\":\r\n{code}\r\n&#15;\r\n{code}\r\n# In Confluence, create a test page with a JIRA Issues Macro which searches for the above JIRA project\r\n# Select \"Labels\" to be one of the fields returned\r\n# Save macro and publish page\r\n\r\nh2. Expected results\r\nConfluence renders the macro successfully\r\n\r\nh2. Actual results\r\nConfluence shows the following error in the UI:\r\n{code}\r\nData cannot be retrieved due to an unexpected error.\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nConfluence logs show the following stacktrace:\r\n{code}\r\n2017-07-13 16:02:00,072 ERROR [JIM Marshaller:thread-16] [extra.jira.helper.JiraExceptionHelper] throwMacroExecutionException Macro execution exception: \r\n -- url: /confluence/display/SR/child | page: 3604487 | traceId: b0b4e1173e350e37 | userName: admin | referer: http://localhost:5611/confluence/pages/resumedraft.action?draftId=3604488&draftShareId=bcfe5fcf-9f6d-4363-bf27-d3a1c06dcb93 | action: viewpage\r\njava.lang.RuntimeException: java.io.IOException: Error on line 38: An invalid XML character (Unicode: 0xf) was found in the CDATA section.\r\n\tat com.atlassian.confluence.extra.jira.JiraIssuesManager$ByteStreamBasedSupplier.get(JiraIssuesManager.java:166)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.confluence.extra.jira.JiraIssuesManager$ByteStreamBasedSupplier.get(JiraIssuesManager.java:146)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.confluence.extra.jira.JiraIssuesManager$Channel.getChannelElement(JiraIssuesManager.java:116)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.confluence.extra.jira.JiraIssuesMacro.setupContextMapForStaticTable(JiraIssuesMacro.java:1029)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.confluence.extra.jira.JiraIssuesMacro.populateContextMapForStaticTable(JiraIssuesMacro.java:961)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.confluence.extra.jira.JiraIssuesMacro.createContextMapFromParams(JiraIssuesMacro.java:479)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.confluence.extra.jira.JiraIssuesMacro.execute(JiraIssuesMacro.java:1276)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.confluence.extra.jira.executor.StreamableMacroFutureTask.renderValue(StreamableMacroFutureTask.java:86)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.confluence.extra.jira.services.DefaultAsyncJiraIssueBatchService$2.call(DefaultAsyncJiraIssueBatchService.java:212)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.confluence.extra.jira.services.DefaultAsyncJiraIssueBatchService$2.call(DefaultAsyncJiraIssueBatchService.java:201)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.sal.core.executor.ThreadLocalDelegateCallable.call(ThreadLocalDelegateCallable.java:38)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.confluence.vcache.VCacheRequestContextOperations$$Lambda$482/1202230221.perform(Unknown Source)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.confluence.impl.vcache.VCacheRequestContextManager.doInRequestContextInternal(VCacheRequestContextManager.java:87)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.confluence.impl.vcache.VCacheRequestContextManager.doInRequestContext(VCacheRequestContextManager.java:71)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.confluence.vcache.VCacheRequestContextOperations.lambda$withRequestContext$1(VCacheRequestContextOperations.java:59)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.confluence.vcache.VCacheRequestContextOperations$$Lambda$481/1654958417.call(Unknown Source)\r\n\tat java.util.concurrent.FutureTask.run(FutureTask.java:266)\r\n\tat java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.runWorker(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:1142)\r\n\tat java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor$Worker.run(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:617)\r\n\tat java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:745)\r\nCaused by: java.io.IOException: Error on line 38: An invalid XML character (Unicode: 0xf) was found in the CDATA section.\r\n\tat com.atlassian.confluence.extra.jira.JiraChannelResponseHandler.getChannelElement(JiraChannelResponseHandler.java:60)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.confluence.extra.jira.JiraIssuesManager$ByteStreamBasedSupplier.get(JiraIssuesManager.java:161)\r\n\t... 19 more\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nh2. Notes\r\n* Note that the actual custom field data stored by JIRA/Zephyr does not need to be displayed in the macro for the error to occur. Only the Labels field is required, probably due to some mechanism in the plugin\r\n* On the JIRA/Zephyr side, the special character is stored in AO table \"AO_7DEABF_CHANGE_ZJEITEM\" rather than in \"customfieldvalue\" like standard custom fields. I'm not sure if this has any bearing to the issue but wanted to note that just in case\r\n* I cannot reproduce this with standard JIRA custom fields such as single or multi-line text fields",

      "description": "h3. Summary\r\n\r\nUpgrading to Confluence 6.2.3 is taking a long time for large instances\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Existing Confluence 6.0.5 and below\r\n # You should have a large set of data (specifically in {{CONTENT}} and {{CONTENTPROPERTIES}} tables)\r\n # Upgrade Confluence to 6.0.6 or above\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nThe upgrade should be done within reasonable time\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nThe upgrade takes a long time to finish because of the following upgrade task {{correctCsvAttachmentMimeTypeUpgradeTask}} which fixes the following bug --CONFSERVER-26926--.\r\n This upgrade task is executing the following query\r\n{code:sql}\r\nUPDATE CONTENTPROPERTIES SET STRINGVAL = 'text/csv' where PROPERTYNAME = 'MEDIA_TYPE' AND CONTENTID in (SELECT CONTENTID FROM CONTENT WHERE CONTENTTYPE = 'ATTACHMENT' AND LOWERTITLE LIKE '%.csv');\r\n{code}\r\n(!) *Note: We have customers who took 15 hours for the upgrade to finish successfully. Others took more than 50 hours and did not finish.*\r\nh3. Workaround\r\nh4. Disabling correctCsvAttachmentMimeTypeUpgradeTask\r\n # Stop Confluence\r\n # Go to this directory {{<confluence-install>/confluence/lib}} and locate the file {{confluence-6.x.x.jar}}\r\n # Take a backup of {{confluence-6.x.x.jar}}\r\n # Open this jar file and locate the file {{upgradeSubsystemContext.xml}}\r\n # Remove any occurrence of the following task {{correctCsvAttachmentMimeTypeUpgradeTask}}\r\n # Save and make sure the jar file is updated\r\n # Reattempt the upgrade\r\n\r\nThe upgrade now should skip that upgrade task.\r\nh4. Manually apply the upgrade task\r\n\r\nAfter the upgrade is completed successfully, we have to apply this task. What we are going to do is to split the query into 2 separate parts.\r\nh5. Part 1 - Fetch Content ID\r\n\r\nWe first need to run the following query to get the list of all content ids that need to be updated\r\n{code:java}\r\nSELECT CONTENTID FROM CONTENT WHERE CONTENTTYPE = 'ATTACHMENT' AND LOWERTITLE LIKE '%.csv';\r\n{code}\r\nSave this into a text file and separate the content ids with a comma like this\r\n{code:java}\r\nid1, id2, id3...\r\n{code}\r\nh5. Part 2 - Update Content Properties\r\n{code:java}\r\nUPDATE CONTENTPROPERTIES SET STRINGVAL = 'text/csv' where PROPERTYNAME = 'MEDIA_TYPE' AND CONTENTID in (<list-of-ids-fetched-before>);\r\n{code}\r\nThis should split the heavy work of LIKE and IN and make this update query faster since we have the list of IDs pre-fetched.\r\n\r\n*Split the updates*\r\n\r\nIn case Part 2 is still taking a long time, some customers have also benefitted from splitting the UPDATE statement into individual updates instead of using the IN clause:\r\n{code:java}\r\nUPDATE CONTENTPROPERTIES SET STRINGVAL = 'text/csv' where PROPERTYNAME = 'MEDIA_TYPE' AND CONTENTID = <first-id-from-part-one>;\r\nUPDATE CONTENTPROPERTIES SET STRINGVAL = 'text/csv' where PROPERTYNAME = 'MEDIA_TYPE' AND CONTENTID = <second-id-from-part-one>;\r\n...\r\nUPDATE CONTENTPROPERTIES SET STRINGVAL = 'text/csv' where PROPERTYNAME = 'MEDIA_TYPE' AND CONTENTID = <last-id-from-part-one>;{code}\r\n\u00a0",

Specifically, hibernate when being asked what the id of an entity is (which is what we do to get a handle during export), it returns the entire entity object as the id.\r\n\r\nWe keep around these \"transient\" ids in our xml export to make sure we don't duplicate etc. The code that uses these ids assume that they are small.\r\n\r\nWe will have to re-implement it with a composite id class, and hopefully, that will fix the issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Summary\r\nRunning Confluence 6.3 and upgrading from MySQL 5.6 to 5.7 will cause the following error disallowing Confluence to start\r\n{code}\r\njava.sql.SQLException: Unknown system variable 'storage_engine'\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nh3. Environment\r\n* Linux\r\n* MySQL 5.6\r\n* MySQL 5.7\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Install Confluence 6.2.3 against MySQL 5.6. Note to leave the connection URL with the {{sessionVariable}} parameter\r\n# Upgrade to Confluence 6.3\r\n# Upgrade MySQL to 5.7 in place or through a dump/import. Again noting to leave the connection URL with the {{sessionVariable}} parameter\r\n\r\nTheoretically a faster way to reproduce this would be to start Confluence 6.3 against MySQL 5.7 with a {{sessionVariable}} parameter in place. The above is intended to reproduce the upgrade flow admins will proceed with\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nConfluence starts up correctly connected to MySQL 5.7\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nConfluence fails to start, and the below exception is thrown:\r\n{noformat}\r\n2017-07-07 14:03:18,634 WARN [C3P0PooledConnectionPoolManager[identityToken->z8kfsx9p8k5ul21q6rg1z|5ca418bc]-HelperThread-#1] [mchange.v2.resourcepool.BasicResourcePool] log Having failed to acquire a resource, com.mchange.v2.resourcepool.BasicResourcePool@45c5dcf5 is interrupting all Threads waiting on a resource to check out.

Last acquisition attempt exception:\r\njava.sql.SQLException: Unknown system variable 'storage_engine'\r\n{noformat}\r\n \r\nh3. Notes\r\nThis will trigger in practise due to the {{sessionVariable}} parameter being applied by default by the Confluence installer when initially running MySQL 5.6 and then leaving the parameter in the {{confluence.cfg.xml}} file when upgrading to MySQL 5.7\r\n\r\nh3.Workaround\r\n# Back up your {{confluence.cfg.xml}} file\r\n# Edit your database connection URL to remove {{sessionVariables=storage_engine%3DInnoDB}}.
