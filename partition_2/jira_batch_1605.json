We do though understand the value in being able to export Team Calendar data for an entire instance, and and will consider this suggestion at a later date.\r\n\r\nFor those of you who aren\u2019t aware, in our Team Calendars 5.5 and 6.0 releases we brought a range of new improvements, including a fresh new look and feel, better event frequency options, and CalDAV \u2013 the ability to use Team Calendars in your favourite calendar app. For more information on these improvements, see: [5.5 release notes|https://confluence.atlassian.com/teamcal/team-calendars-5-5-0-release-notes-942863254.html], and [6.0 release notes|https://confluence.atlassian.com/teamcal/team-calendars-6-0-release-notes-947182030.html].\r\n\r\nBest wishes,\r\n Jenny | Confluence Server Product Manager\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\n\r\nAs of now, Confluence Team Calendar does not have a feature to allow Confluence administrators to export the whole Calendar data and import it into another Confluence instance.\r\n\r\nWhen Confluence administrators would like to combine two team calendar into calendar, having this feature will definitely make their life a lot easier.",

For example, if a very important demo is scheduled or if a period of 24/7 support is in place.  This calendar is a mix of project and operations events.\r\n\r\nWe also have a calendar that tracks similar events for a subset of projects.  This calendar is accessible by a specific group only and does not include operations events nor all project events.\r\n\r\nI'd like to be able to display events that should appear on both calendars by selecting the calendars, rather than having to create two events and maintain these separately.  And it's not appropriate to give a particular group access to the other calendar (so that it can overlay the events) due to the fact that they shouldn't have permission to view all the other events too.\r\n\r\nIs this functionality available?  If not, it is a new feature that we would very much like to see included in a future release of Team Calendars.\r\n\r\nThanks",

Problem Definition\r\nCurrently the only way to tie JIRA issues together with Team Calendars is to add specific JIRA event types (JIRA Issue Dates, JIRA Agile Sprints, JIRA Project Releases). In the event you simply want to be able to reference a JIRA link in a standard Team Calendar, these types just don't work. Currently you would have to login to JIRA, find the issue, copy the link, paste into the related page field for a Team Calendars event. However this just shows a link to click to take you to the issue in JIRA.\r\n\r\nh4. Suggested Solution\r\nOffer something similar to the JIRA Issues Macro, where if an application link is setup for JIRA there is a new field in issues to search the JIRA instance. For example, if I wanted to find TEST-10999 I could enter that into the field, it would pop down, I would click that and save the event.\r\n\r\nFurther, once the saved event is clicked on it will show the JIRA issue similarly to how the JIRA Issue Macro displays a single issue.",
