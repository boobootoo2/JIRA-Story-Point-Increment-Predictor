Storing a fake password is risky- it should allow a user to have a null password which indicates that user cannot login via credential (since there is none) but could login via authenticator, such as an SSO authenticator.

And cross-posted in [UPM-1619|https://studio.atlassian.com/browse/UPM-1619].\r\n\r\nFor some reason, new UPM duplicates listener modules when you try to install existing plugin. Consequence is quite bad. You can reinstall plugin 5 times and listener will be executed 5 times.\r\n\r\nh5. Steps to Reproduce:\r\nUse the attached [^test-listeners.zip] which contains:\r\n- test-listeners-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar\r\n- test-listeners-2.0-SNAPSHOT.jar\r\n- test-listeners-3.0-SNAPSHOT.jar\r\n- README.txt\r\nAnd follow the quoated README.txt\r\n{quote}\r\nDESCRIPTION\r\n\r\nTest listener plugin contains a listener, which is executed on template update event.\r\nAll in all, three versions of plugin are provided.\r\nWhen listener method is executed, each of three versions displays version-specific message:\r\nv. 1.0-SNAPSHOT: '@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@ Executed in TemplateImportedListener v1!'\r\nv. 2.0-SNAPSHOT: '@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@ Executed in TemplateImportedListener v2!'\r\nv. 3.0-SNAPSHOT: '@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@ Executed in TemplateImportedListener v3!'\r\n\r\nSTEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\n- Run confluence 4.0.5.\r\n- Install Test listeners plugin v. 1.0-SNAPSHOT by uploading test-listeners-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar file.\r\n- Go to Import Templates in Confluence admin and import any template to Global templates or some space.\r\n- Check that log file contains WARN level message '@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@ Executed in TemplateImportedListener v1!'.\r\n- Uninstall Test listeners plugin v. 1.0-SNAPSHOT.\r\n- Install Test listeners plugin v. 2.0-SNAPSHOT by uploading test-listeners-2.0-SNAPSHOT.jar file.\r\n- One more time go to Import Templates and import any template to Global templates or some space.\r\n- Check that log file contains 2 WARN level messages:\r\n\t1) '@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@ Executed in TemplateImportedListener v1!'\r\n\t2) '@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@ Executed in TemplateImportedListener v2!'\r\n- Uninstall Test listeners plugin v. 2.0-SNAPSHOT.\r\n- Install Test listeners plugin v. 3.0-SNAPSHOT by uploading test-listeners-3.0-SNAPSHOT.jar file.\r\n- Go to Import Templates and import any template to Global templates or some space.\r\n- Check that log file contains 3 WARN level messages:\r\n\t1) '@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@ Executed in TemplateImportedListener v1!'\r\n\t2) '@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@ Executed in TemplateImportedListener v2!'\r\n\t3) '@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@ Executed in TemplateImportedListener v3!'\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nh5. Workaround\r\nThe current workaround is to shutdown Confluence, remove plugin caches and restart Confluence. Unfortunately, this is not practical users.",

If I recall right, our attachment file size in OnDemand is set to 100mb (CONFDEV-3606), but I've got no idea if it is enforced if using this API and if so it's probably after the deserialisation. The limit wouldn't have mattered anyway in the above mentioned case.\r\n\r\nPlease investigate if a limit of 100mb is still feasible (imo it's way too high, I would even suggest reducing it to ~10-15mb) as the production max heap size is 512mb. Please also ensure that the limit is enforced when using the above mentioned API *before* it's getting deserialised since it'll cause a memory footprint of at least double the size.\r\n\r\nMaybe we should enforce the setting of the Content-length header via a filter for these requests, and enforce the limit via that (even if it's not accurate). We could also experiment with just setting the [maxPostSize|http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-6.0-doc/config/ajp.html] on the container.",

Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nTwo factors authentication can be adopted to add more security to Confluence login action.\r\nMany solutions are available, like *Gmail* approach for two factor:\r\n* SMS based, no new hardware needed\r\n* Can authorize a browser for up to 30 days from a single two factors auth (e.g. only pw is needed for 30 days, and on day 31 you have to do the whole two factors dance)\r\n* Gmails approach is a nice combination of security and ease of use but others are available too.\r\n\r\nh3. Plugins as workaround \r\nThere is 2 plugin offering this features\r\n# [2-Factor Auth Secure Login - Confluence|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/de.syracom.confluence.plugins.securelogin/server/overview]\r\n# [Duo for Confluence|https://duo.com/docs/confluence].

The anchor tag is empty and the URL is not saved into the BODYCONTENT table.\r\n\r\nSimilar behavior occurs when inserting an image from the web with an URL containing an invalid character.

For example: http://www.google.com/* (this is a bogus URL)\r\n* Click Insert\r\n* Save page\r\n\r\nh4. Workaround:\r\n\r\nUse an encoded entity in the format \"%<hexit><hexit>\" ([reference|http://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_urlencode.asp]) in place of the invalid character when injecting the URL.\r\n\r\nOR a simpler way would be:\r\n\r\n# Go to Google Shortner at https://goo.gl/\r\n# Paste the URL\r\n# Google will generate a *short url* for your URL which you will be able to link.\r\n# Google will also be change your *long URL* to alphanumeric characters, which can also be saved.",

However this is not the case with applied formattings in Confluence.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, when inserting a new line (row) into a table whose columns have certain alignment and format, the new line will always have the default formatting and alignment, which means that every time a new line is inserted alignment and formatting have to be manually restored.\r\nSee screenshot of a typical result.\r\n\r\nI am aware that in a wiki having formatting without content might be somewhat problematic (in contrast to an office suite).\r\n\r\nStill I feel that at least the alignment should be inherited from the line where the cursor previously was. This is simply what users expect and what reduces unnecessary formatting work.\r\n\r\nThis behaviour might be configurable in case some users prefer it the current way.",

One of the columns holds the status macro (green,yellow, red) for every line within these tables.\r\n\r\nIt takes 9 seconds for Confluence to insert one new table line using either the toolbar or the shortcut. \r\nDeleting the very same lines only takes the fraction of a second, though. Also, on small tables inserting a new record is quick as well. So it's seemingly the table length and number of tables on the page that slows it down.\r\n\r\nJoe Wai Tye [Atlassian] tested this and found that it took him 2s on a page with one 150 row almost empty table, so with two tables we would be talking about the same order of mangnitude.\r\n\r\nHe also tested on Chrome and found it to be significantly faster in this respect.\r\n\r\nSo this looks like a browser specific performance issue.",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFCLOUD-24274].\n  {panel}\n\nVia the tickets I can see Atlissian does not want customers using one instance of Confluence for multiple domains.\r\n\r\nPlease consider the scenario where Enterprise customers would be willing to pay for this feature via some kind of licensing model.\r\n\r\nI am in talks with a large Bank on CMS/Wiki solutions beyond SharePoint. I brought Confluence up but the big concern is not being able to use multiple domains. The second is no support for virtualized cluster, but I can deal with that creatively.\r\n\r\nHosted solutions are not options due to the sensitivity of the data. Starting on the IT side,\r\n\r\nhttps://webcash.bank.com\r\nhttps://trade.bank.com\r\n\r\nWould point load different spaces based on the domain name. Each space should not have awareness of the other. I know I can simulate this via Apache redirects, Virtual Hosting and removing the Dashboard link... but they want simplicity and some divisions are very territorial.\r\n\r\nInfrastructure costs are very very high (requirements for redundancy, DR, networking, staff to monitor the systems, ect.. ect..) so they would have no issue paying for additional licensing for this feature.\r\n\r\nI can see that to support this feature, Confluence simply needs to stop hard coding the base url. Instead, allow us to unlock more base urls if we purchases some kind of domain license and set corresponding \"Site Homepage\" urls with an option to remove the Dashboard link.\r\n\r\nPlease consider this as an option for all your products provided Atlissian is targetting the Enterprise market.",
