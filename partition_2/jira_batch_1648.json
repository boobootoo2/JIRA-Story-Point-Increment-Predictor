Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nIt would increase the functionality of task features exponentially if there was the ability to add a tag/label to each individual task, similarly to the way the @mention can be added to any task that has a checkbox in front of it.

Problem Definition\r\nThere is not currently integration between Confluence and HipChat that allows for users in HipChat to select certain data or chat messages and relay it to a specific Confluence page. The purpose of this functionality would be to allow for important information shared through HipChat to be archived in a central location (a Confluence page) where users can view important information and leave comments/inline comments. Copied chats would include the date/time stamp as well as the sender.\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solutions\r\n* Include an option to highlight text in HipChat, or select a message in HipChat and send to a specific Confluence page.\r\n** A more integrated/advanced version of having better copy/paste features between HC and Confluence: https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONF-25753\r\n* Allow auto archiving of all chats in a HipChat room to a corresponding Confluence Page\r\n* Create a tag, and use the predetermined hashtags in HipChat messages to designate which HipChat messages should move to which Confluence page",

Solution\r\nIf you have an active support license with Adaptavist, you can track this issue with reference {{CONTENTF-251}}. Wait for the bug to be fixed and install the plugin version that contains it.\r\n*Update:* The issue was reportedly fixed in version 4.2.16 of the plugin.",

Only watches on pages and blog posts are relevant here.{quote}\r\n\r\nBy allowing page edition to be included into the notification feature, Confluence could discard e-mail notification altogether and rely on the notification feature. This will make working with Confluence completely independent of email system if i want to keep track of changes of pages i care about.\r\nThis would also solve the digestion mail issue (https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONF-14485), due to many small updates (which i think should be encouraged), because you will be able to simply replace the notification already created, regarding editting of page, with a new one, which is difficult to do with email. It should of course be optional to recieve notification on this, as it should be optional to recieve notifications about likes.\r\n\r\nIf you ask me, email notifications should just be an extra option on all the different types of notifications you want in your WorkBox. Maybe WorkBox should be split into a \"Work\"-box with things that require some action or has high attention like mentions, comments to things i have written, or changes to jira elements i am assigned to. low attentions notificaiton could be updates to pages/spaces i am watching and likes of comments or pages. \r\n",

Suggestion\r\n\r\nThe deprecated [XML-RPC and SOAP APIs|https://developer.atlassian.com/confdev/confluence-rest-api/confluence-xml-rpc-and-soap-apis] used to have an {{exportSpace}} functionality, however they are deprecated since Confluence 5.5. The [REST API|https://developer.atlassian.com/confdev/confluence-rest-api] functionality does not include an option for creating space/site exports. Even if the exported XML is not transferred via the REST interface, the action could trigger the backup of any given space or the instance to the export directory, optionally providing a download link for it\r\nh5. Workaround\r\n # The [Confluence CLI|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/org.swift.confluence.cli/cloud/overview] provides such functionality, but it is a paid third-party add-on. The above functionality would be important to automate migration/backup tasks for administrators.\r\n # Although deprecated, you may still use the [RPC-API|https://confluence.atlassian.com/conf613/enabling-the-remote-api-964961434.html] to export the entire Space \u2013 see the examples below.\r\n ** [Confluence JSON-RPC APIs|https://developer.atlassian.com/server/confluence/confluence-json-rpc-apis]\r\n ** [Remote Confluence methods|https://developer.atlassian.com/server/confluence/remote-confluence-methods/]\r\n ** [Remote API Specification for PDF export|https://developer.atlassian.com/server/confluence/remote-api-specification-for-pdf-export/]\r\n\r\nh4.

Problem Definition\r\nCurrently Confluence only strips out a limited number of media files embedded in a Microsoft Word document before indexing it:\r\n* {{.png}}\r\n* {{.emf}}\r\n* {{.wmf}}\r\n* {{.jpg}}\r\n* {{.jpeg}}\r\n* {{.gif}}\r\n\r\nIf a document has an embedded file not listed here, it may not get indexed if it is too large.\r\n\r\nh3. Background\r\nCurrently Confluence does not index files if the content with the removed media listed above is greater than 16Mb. There's a system property that can be set to make this larger, but this isn't used. See [CONF-40176|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONF-40176] for more details.\r\n\r\nh3.

Problem Definition\r\n\r\nCurrently there isn't a streamlined way to apply permissions to a collection of spaces to user groups.\r\n\r\nYou can manage global permissions to a degree and you could manage individual space permissions. \r\n\r\nWhat's more you have to micro manage page restrictions if you only want users to edit particular pages. Child pages do not inherit permissions recursively from parent permissions. This creates a head ache for the use case if you have parent pages that have thousands of child pages different restriction requirements. You essentially would have to make each Parent page a space to meet the requirement. \r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nProvide method similar to Permission schemes in JIRA for Projects for Spaces in Confluence that fits the permission structure spaces and pages. \r\n \r\n",

Summary\r\n\r\nWhen copying a  page with a large amount of attachments (Either in high number or large in size) in the same space. It generates an error \"Saving is not possible at the moment.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Step 1 Attach 100+ attachments or several Large (1GB +) attachments to a page and save it. \r\n# Attempt to copy the page in the same space and save it.\r\n\r\nI was not able to reproduce it if I saved and moved it to another space. It only reproduced if I was making a copy, renaming it, and saving it within the same space. \r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nPage copies with attachments successfully. \r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nPage will error in saving is not possible at the moment. It will finally save if you wait for a short period of time. It doesn't appear to copy over all the attachments. In my testing it seems that it copies only the active attachments in the body content. \r\n\r\nThe below exception is thrown in the xxxxxxx.log file:\r\n{noformat}\r\nERROR [http-bio-1990-exec-627] [sf.hibernate.impl.SessionImpl] execute Could not synchronize database state with session\r\n2016-01-07 14:16:17.333558500  -- referer: /wiki/pages/copypage.action?idOfPageToCopy=57016452&spaceKey=CCDS | url: /wiki/rest/api/content | traceId: 2d946ca43934ef2e | userName: sysadmin\r\n2016-01-07 14:16:17.347602500 2016-01-07 14:16:17,337 ERROR [http-bio-1990-exec-627] [rest.api.model.ExceptionConverter] convertServiceException No status code found for exception, converting to internal server error : \r\n2016-01-07 14:16:17.347604500  -- referer:t/wiki/pages/copypage.action?idOfPageToCopy=57016452&spaceKey=CCDS | url: /wiki/rest/api/content | traceId: 2d946ca43934ef2e | userName: sysadmin\r\n2016-01-07 14:16:17.347605500 org.springframework.orm.hibernate.HibernateSystemException: could not update: [com.atlassian.confluence.pages.Attachment#63407099]; nested exception is net.sf.hibernate.HibernateException: could not update: [com.atlassian.confluence.pages.Attachment#63407099]\r\n2016-01-07 14:16:17.347634500 \tat org.springframework.orm.hibernate.SessionFactoryUtils.convertHibernateAccessException(SessionFactoryUtils.java:597)\r\n2016-01-07 14:16:17.348686500 Caused by: net.sf.hibernate.HibernateException: could not update: [com.atlassian.confluence.pages.Attachment#63407099]\r\n2016-01-07 14:16:17.348690500 \tat net.sf.hibernate.persister.EntityPersister.update(EntityPersister.java:693)\r\n2016-01-07 14:16:17.348691500 \tat net.sf.hibernate.persister.EntityPersister.update(EntityPersister.java:630)\r\n2016-01-07 14:16:17.348691500 \tat net.sf.hibernate.impl.ScheduledUpdate.execute(ScheduledUpdate.java:52)\r\n2016-01-07 14:16:17.348691500 \tat net.sf.hibernate.impl.SessionImpl.execute(SessionImpl.java:2476)\r\n2016-01-07 14:16:17.348697500 \tat net.sf.hibernate.impl.SessionImpl.executeAll(SessionImpl.java:2462)\r\n2016-01-07 14:16:17.348698500 \tat net.sf.hibernate.impl.SessionImpl.execute(SessionImpl.java:2420)\r\n2016-01-07 14:16:17.348698500 \tat net.sf.hibernate.impl.SessionImpl.autoFlushIfRequired(SessionImpl.java:1837)\r\n2016-01-07 14:16:17.348698500 \tat net.sf.hibernate.impl.SessionImpl.getQueries(SessionImpl.java:1594)\r\n2016-01-07 14:16:17.348699500 \tat net.sf.hibernate.impl.SessionImpl.find(SessionImpl.java:1559)\r\n2016-01-07 14:16:17.348703500 \tat net.sf.hibernate.impl.QueryImpl.list(QueryImpl.java:49)\r\n2016-01-07 14:16:17.348704500 \tat com.atlassian.hibernate.HibernateObjectDao.lambda$findNamedQueryStringParams$5(HibernateObjectDao.java:507)\r\n2016-01-07 14:16:17.348704500 \tat org.springframework.orm.hibernate.HibernateTemplate.execute(HibernateTemplate.java:370)\r\n2016-01-07 14:16:17.348705500 \t... 370 more\r\n2016-01-07 14:16:17.348705500 Caused by: net.sf.hibernate.StaleObjectStateException: Row was updated or deleted by another transaction (or unsaved-value mapping was incorrect) for com.atlassian.confluence.pages.Attachment instance with identifier: 63407099\r\n2016-01-07 14:16:17.348710500 \tat net.sf.hibernate.persister.AbstractEntityPersister.check(AbstractEntityPersister.java:513)\r\n2016-01-07 14:16:17.348710500 \tat net.sf.hibernate.persister.EntityPersister.update(EntityPersister.java:673)\r\n\r\nERROR [conversion-thread-cloud-0] [plugins.conversion.impl.TimeoutConversionRunnable] run Cannot convert.

Problem Definition\r\nSometimes cached authentication data in Confluence prevents users from seeing updated changes (such as group memberships). To resolve this, users will need to log out, clear their cookies, and log back in.\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\nCreate an 'Expire all cookies' task that can be run by users in the scheduled jobs. There is already a task that does this for expired RememberMe tokens.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround \r\nPlease follow these steps to expire all cookies in Confluence:\r\n(!) Shutdown Confluence and backup your database before making any of these changes.\r\n# Run the following on your database. This will set the 'created' date for the cookies to 11/01/2015 (in epoch time):\r\n{code:sql}\r\nUPDATE remembermetoken SET created = 1446337357;\r\n{code}\r\n# Go to !http://i.imgur.com/jGuDYP2.png! -> cache management -> flush all\r\n# Go to !http://i.imgur.com/jGuDYP2.png! -> General configuration -> scheduled jobs -> Clear Expired Remember Me Tokens -> Run\r\n# Restart Confluence\r\n(!) If you've set the rememberMe token expiration higher, you will need to create a new date using epoch time that exceeds that period. \r\n\r\n",
