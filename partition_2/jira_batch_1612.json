It was just addictive, it makes you want to participate just for the sake of pushing the cursor upwards. It also displayed your inactivity periods, so you didn't want to look like a slacker and you'd make the effort of answering one or two questions every fortnight. Which is an addiction trigger.\r\n\r\nNow it's gone. You might want to check what's user engagement since the transition.\r\n\r\nBest of luck Sam,\r\nAdrien",

In one recent case, I redirected the asker to Bitbucket support, but they categorized the question as \"development-related\", and told them to take it back to Answers (according to policy). However, the question went unanswered for days because staff didn't happen to notice it. In the meantime, they helpfully answered other questions that didn't require their attention.\r\n\r\nI imagine this issue would be more useful for Confluence Questions customers, who may often have staff that spend no time monitoring the site except to moderate spam.",

The Unanswered filter is useful for finding questions with 0 answers, but in some cases a question may be truly unanswered even though it has \u201canswers\u201d posted. For example, Paul just responded to many of the unanswered questions with an answer that was just asking if it still needed to be answered. Because of that, these questions no longer show up in the Unanswered filter. We should probably discourage people from doing that, but with this alternate sort order you could look at questions with only 1 \u201canswer\u201d.\r\nAn alternative (or in addition) would be to make Unanswered (or a new filter) include any questions without a \u201cselected\u201d answer regardless of how many \u201canswers\u201d have been posted and encourage people to choose a selected answer when their questions are answered. Most people don\u2019t seem to select an answer currently though so this might not be good enough by itself\u2026might still need the Number of Answers option.",

The question is just higher on the page. Does the voting change anything visually besides the vote counter? With Atlassian Answers, having the question hold more weight (bigger, bolder font) made sense. And maybe higher voted answers rise to the top of the rank, get a bigger font as well... but having the same weight throughout is visually confusing.

I added a recent questions list with a topic \"visual_statistics\" on my page and both in the preview as in the page after saving it shows a topic that doesn't have a tag \"visual_statistics\", but \"visual_analytics\" (which is a different product).\r\n\r\nSee screenshots.\r\n\r\nThanks for investigating,\r\n\r\nGianni",

Remove the 100 cap!\r\n2. Implement pagination.\r\n3. Sort questions by score, low voted questions will naturally fall off the page.

Additionally, we also have some customizations in place that reward users with Atlassian merchandise at certain reputation levels.\r\n\r\nWhen users begin to accrue over 1,000 reputation points, Confluence Questions displays an abbreviated value in their user profile for points earned.  I assume this was done to save on horizontal space used and because digits become less significant as the magnitude of points accrued increases.  Confluence Questions will round up or down to the nearest significant digit to to this.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately this can be very confusing as a user when you're working towards a specific point level.  We give away a T-Shirt on Answers at 1,500 points, but the profile will display \"1.5K\" before the user has actually reached 1,500 points.  \r\n\r\nTo avoid this confusion, the rounding algorithm should only ever round down. \"1,499\" points should display as \"1.4k\", not \"1.5k\".\r\n",
