Running any version of Confluence between >= 5.1 and < 5.4 (tested with JIRA macro plugin up to 5.3.4).\r\n2. Create an application link to a JIRA server (was tested running JIRA server 6.1.9 but I believe this to be independent from the actual JIRA server).\r\n3. Copy a JIRA link to an issue and paste it into a new document in Confluence.\r\n4. Save the document.\r\n5. Check out the documents storage format.\r\n6. Note that looking at the storage format, the severID-parameter is missing.\r\n7. Upgrade Confluence to >= 5.4 (tested when upgrading to 5.4.3, but I assume the issue persists even when upgrading to the latest Confluence version including 5.8.13)\r\n8. Check out the storage format of the test page.\r\n\r\nActual result:\r\nThe storage format does not specify the serverID for that issue to the JIRA server.\r\n\r\nExpected result:\r\nThe storage format shows the proper serverID.\r\n\r\nThe problem is here as follows (at least all according to my assumptions/observations):\r\nIn Confluence 5.1-5.3.4 there was a bug resulting in the serverID not being added when copy-pasting links directly from Confluence.\r\nThere is actually an upgrade task (\"jiraIssueMacroServerParamsUpgradeTask\") which correctly adds the missing serverID. However, this upgrade task is only run when upgrading from Confluence <= 5.0.x.\r\nDue to the bug in Confluence 5.1-5.3.5 upgraded Confluence instances can however still contain JIRA issues which are missing the serverID.\r\n\r\nTherefore I'd suggest to perform the jiraIssueMacroServerParamsUpgradeTask as part of one of Confluence upgrade tasks for one a following version (Confluence 5.9 or 5.10 for instance). That way any older remains of this old bug are fixed correctly and won't cause problems in the future.\r\n\r\nThe issue is related to CONF-25329 and the support request I had a while ago (CSP-146293).\r\n\r\nh1. Workaround\r\n# upgrade your instance to Confluence >= 5.4\r\n# go to admin/do-force-upgrade.action\r\n# manually run \"jiraIssueMacroServerParamsUpgradeTask\"",

      "description": "Hi,\r\n\r\nAfter upgrading confluence to latest version(_5.8.13_) from _5.7.1_, we got an issue with links which were created(before Confluence upgrade) with Page Titles. If a link has Page IDs(not contains Title of the page), problem is not observed. We have tested the other Turkish characters ('\u00d6', '\u00f6', '\u00fc', '\u00dc') and problem not occurs with them.\r\n\r\nFollows the given steps below to reproduce the issue:\r\n1. Have a Page or create under any space with Title contains Turkish characters '\u0130' or '\u0131'.\r\n2. Link this page with its title in another page. Or try to browse the link in any browser.\r\n3. Link is not reachable. Page not found error occurs at Confluence.\r\n\r\n+For i.e.:+ \r\n*Space Code:* SBP\r\n*Page Title:* Yaz\u0131l\u0131m Destek\r\n\r\nWrite the URL, which contains title instead the Page ID, in a browser and enter: https://<domain>/confluence/display/SBP/Yaz\u0131l\u0131m+Destek\r\nThe above example fails to browse into the mentioned page.\r\n\r\nBut if you have a link without \"\u0130\" or \"\u0131\" the following works fine: https://<domain>/confluence/display/SBP/Uygulama+Destek\r\n\r\nWe have lots of links created previously at our system, so after upgrade we have trouble with this and it is not possible to change all of the links with their Page IDs as workaround.\r\n\r\nMoreover some existing links, which contain '\u0130' or '\u0131' and works fine before upgrade, seem corrupted like as below:(so when a user click the link, confluence tries to create a new page):\r\nhttps://dev.obss.com.tr/confluence/pages/createpage.action?spaceKey=OP&title=%C4%B0dari+B%C3%B6l%C3%BCmler&linkCreation=true&fromPageId=9864257\r\n\r\nI should also say that we have lots of customers at Turkey as we are an Atlassian Platinum Partner, if they upgrade their confluence instances, they will also face with this issue too. \r\n\r\nThe issue has side effects to cause another problems. One of them can be reproduced like as below(blocker cannot create child pages):\r\n1. Go to a page which contains \"\u0130\" or \"i\" (i.e.: \u0130klim Sorunu)\r\n2. Try to create a child page under the page mentioned at step 1.\r\n3. Give any name to child page(even with English Characters.i.e.: Software)\r\n4. Enter Save button to finish creation process.\r\n5. Observe that the following Exception occurs at the page screen.\r\n{code}The following error(s) occurred:\r\nThe parent page specified does not exist. It may have been renamed or deleted since you started editing.{code}\r\n\r\nWe think that this is one of the side effects caused by link issue.\r\n\r\n\r\nI give some information at Environment Field about Server System and Confluence:\r\n\r\nPlease feel free to ask if you have more information.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nOBSS RCM Manager\r\nBaki \u00dcNL\u00dc",

Sample is below\r\n\r\nstatic void Main()\r\n{ string url = @\"http://dubconfluence800:8090/rest/api/content/?os_authType=basic/?spaceKey=DOL&title=Dolphin+Test+Cases\"; Uri myUri = new Uri(url); WebRequest myWebRequest = HttpWebRequest.Create(myUri); HttpWebRequest myHttpWebRequest = (HttpWebRequest)myWebRequest; string uN = Base64Encode(\"Brannick\"); string pW = Base64Encode(\"Brannick\"); NetworkCredential myNetworkCredential = new NetworkCredential(uN, pW); CredentialCache myCredentialCache = new CredentialCache(); myCredentialCache.Add(myUri, \"Basic\", myNetworkCredential); myHttpWebRequest.PreAuthenticate = true; myHttpWebRequest.Credentials = myCredentialCache; WebResponse myWebResponse = myWebRequest.GetResponse(); Stream responseStream = myWebResponse.GetResponseStream(); StreamReader myStreamReader = new StreamReader(responseStream, Encoding.Default); string pageContent = myStreamReader.ReadToEnd(); responseStream.Close(); myWebResponse.Close(); Console.WriteLine(pageContent); }\r\npublic static string Base64Encode(string plainText)\r\n{ var plainTextBytes = System.Text.Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(plainText); return Convert.ToBase64String(plainTextBytes); }\r\n\r\nI'm writing this in C# as it is a requirement for the task i'm doing. As you can see from the code the url in question is the folllowing\r\n\r\nhttp://dubconfluence800:8090/rest/api/content/?spaceKey=DOL&title=Dolphin+Test+Cases\r\n\r\nwhen I try that manually in the browser or via code I get the following\r\n{\"statusCode\":404,\"message\":\"No space with key : DOL\"}\r\n\r\nwhich is as expected as per manual steps as the page has authentication enabled. However. I would have thought via code I would be ok based on content in the folllowing link\r\n\r\nhttps://developer.atlassian.com/confdev/confluence-rest-api/confluence-rest-apis-prototype-only/using-the-rest-apis-prototype-only\r\n\r\nWould you have any guidance on the above as to what I may be doing wrong? thanks in advance.\r\n\r\nBtw I got redirected to yourselves by a person from a different team...you can see the details in the folllowing link\r\n\r\nhttps://ecosystem.atlassian.net/browse/REL-325",

      "description": "We have an in-house custom plugin which generates tables with extra functionality. The \"autoTotal\" option causes it to generate a footer row containing totals for any columns of appropriate data types. This plugin works fine in Confluence 5.7.5. \r\n\r\nDuring testing with Confluence 5.8.10 we discovered that tables with a total row are being modified such that the total row is displayed at the very top of the table (above the header row). When the page first displays it looks right for a second or two, but when it finishes loading the footer row jumps to the top of the table.\r\n\r\nI was able to reproduce the problem without the custom plugin, by pasting an HTML table into the source editor. The problem occurs when there are *th* elements in the *tfoot* block. \r\n\r\nThe original HTML is being modified in two phases. In the first phase the header row is put into a *thead* block, and the *tfoot* row is moved to the top of the table (above *thead* and *tbody*). The table still displays fine. The HTML at this point is the final state in Confluence 5.7.5, but is just an interim state in Confluence 5.8.\r\n\r\nIn the second phase (which occurs in Confluence 5.8 only), the *tfoot* block content is moved to a new *thead* block at the very top of the table, which is then followed by an empty *tfoot* block, the original *thead* block, and finally the *tbody* block. At this point the table is displayed incorrectly, with the total row at the top.\r\n\r\nIf the *th* elements in the *tfoot* block are changed to *td* elements, the problem does not occur. If the table is ineligible for sticky headers (eg. in a Documentation Theme space, or no header row, or in a page layout section) then the the problem does not occur.\r\n\r\nI'm attaching:\r\n* the original HTML\r\n* the HTML as it appears in that first stage when the footer row is still at the bottom of the table - this is also how it looks after loading finishes in Confluence 5.7.5\r\n* the HTML as it appears when the page is finished loading in Confluence 5.8.10\r\n\r\nIt looks like the sticky headers functionality doesn't allow *th* elements in *tfoot* blocks, and moves them into a *thead* block. I think this is a bug. ",

However the current state of REST API is far inferior to the XML=-RPC API and there appears little movement in improving it to bring its functionality to an equivalent level. \r\n\r\nWhen flaws are found the XML-RPC API where there is no equivalent in the REST API I would have expected some positive response - fix the XML-RPC API or add to the functionality  to the REST API. Recently I raised a call (CSP-15699) and have been told that the DOCUMENTED (but clearly untested) functionality is not actually present in the product and there is no intention of changing this situation (other than updating the documentation I assume). \r\n\r\nI find the current approach very unprofessional.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

They have a similar functionality within a separate system of theirs that allows them to embed a Seurity label that allows them to define groups that may access a set of content by virtue of their group memberships and denies anyone accessing the content that is not a member of the approved group.\r\n\r\nBasically, anyone who is a member of the approved group can view the page, anyone who is not a member of the group is denied. By placing this label in metadata, the creator is freed from the extra work of granting or denying users from accessing content that they should never access. Using this method they can easily create content without worry that any material will be viewed by parties that should not have access to that content.\r\n\r\nThis enables them to share sensitive data and meet requirements for regulatory and compliance that are in place without the overhead and burden of managing thousands of users and requests to access content (which costs time and effort to insure that the user should access the content or the potential mistake of a human granting access where it should not be granted).\r\nThis would be a feature that could benefit many clients and expand the footprint of the application as it could ease many of the security concerns present in the current access methods alone.\r\n\r\nThe implementation should be built such that a metadata label can create a restriction and access control on the page. Ideally this would be able to be embedded within templates within Confluence as well.",

Its easier to write multiple stories in quickly, review and edit before making them into trackable items in Jira. \r\n\r\nOne issue is that the Jira import module only supports one field when importing multiple rows in a table. It would be very helpful if the Jira import module supported multiple columns; specifically... \r\nUser Story\r\nAcceptance Criteria \r\n\r\nAdditional/optional fields would be great but at least two would be huge!\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\nJon",

      "description": "h3. Summary\r\nAs of Java 1.8u51+ (also 1.7.0_85+ and 1.6.0_101+) making SSL connections to an IP address is no longer allowed.  Previously the JVM would do a reverse lookup of the hostname using the IP then complete the connection using that hostname.  This was a security vulnerability because an attacker that gained control of DNS could route traffic to their own server.  This change is a security feature of Java.\r\n\r\nWe have found there is a problem with the way Java creates LDAPS connections.  The way Socket.createSocket() is used results in an SSLSocket without the hostname set in it.  This results in use of an IP address to make the connection and since this is no longer allowed the connection fails.  We have reported this problem to Oracle and also forwarded the information to the Java security dev list: http://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/security-dev/2015-September/012845.html .\r\n\r\nBecause of this _*existing LDAPS connections are broken*_ and users from that user directory are unable to login including non-local administrators.\r\n\r\nThis will affect any customer using secure LDAP that upgrades the JVM.  Secure LDAP is very common to protect passwords on the internal network, particularly in enterprise environments.  This is exacerbated by Confluence 5.8.8 which ships with Java 1.8.0u51.\r\n\r\nh3. Environment\r\n* Any version of Confluence using one of the noted Java versions.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Configure a user directory using a secure LDAP connection\r\n# Upgrade the JDK to a noted Java version.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nLogins and LDAP syncs should work as normal.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nUsers will be unable to authenticate and LDAP syncs will fail.\r\n\r\nErrors like this will occur in the logs: {code:borderStyle=solid}\r\n2015-07-22 12:43:05,896 WARN  [http-bio-443-exec-1] @1SDVDDx763x1x0 XXXXX \"POST /j_stash_security_check HTTP/1.1\" c.a.s.i.s.s.PluginAuthenticationProvider Could not authenticate XXXXX; authentication by com.atlassian.stash.stash-authentication:crowdHttpAuthHandler failed\r\ncom.atlassian.stash.user.AuthenticationSystemException: The remote authentication server is not available.

Note that if the name service is not trustworthy, enabling reverse name lookup may be susceptible to MITM attacks.{quote}\r\n* Under the LDAP connection \"Advanced Settings\" set \"Secure SSL\" to disabled\r\n** As stated in the UI this will disable all verification of the SSL certificate.  Your LDAP data will still be encrypted.\r\n** (!) This workaround may represent a greater vulnerability as any SSL cert could be substituted with no need to compromise a DNS server.\r\n\r\nh3. Resolution\r\n* Upgrade Java to Java 8u65 (if running Confluence 5.7 or above)\r\n** This version includes a fix for the bug that causes this issue [JDK-8135194|https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8135194]",

[See the corresponding bug report|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFCLOUD-39308].\n  {panel}\n\nI tried to ask this question on the community board and received a question in response, but since this is the first time I've participated in that board, I can only post a response every 24 hours until I've posted 3 times, so I'm going to try this way. Please help. This is important to us.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Original Question:*\r\n\r\nWe are using Atlassian Confluence 5.8.8.\r\nI have been using the Include Page Macro a lot and it's essential to our documentation model.\r\nNow we have started using multiple spaces and it is not working for me.\r\nI created a New Space and created several documents within that space. On my master document page, I tried to use include page macro and it only finds pages from our original space, not New Space.\r\nIt does not see any pages from the New Space. \r\nOther macros I've tried to use seem to work. Just not that one. I created another space and the same thing happens there.\r\nWhat I've tried:\r\n\u2022\tI have played around with titles of the pages, permissions, different pages, etc.  \r\n\u2022\tI've tried using the space key/space/colon for the New Space. That didn't work.\r\n\u2022\tI tried a work-around I read about to insert a page I could access and edit it. That didn't work.\r\nThank you for any suggestions to solve this problem. It's huge for us.\r\n________________________________________\r\n*Nic's  answer:*\r\n\r\nTo use pages from other spaces, you have to specify the target page's space key.\r\nE.g. for a page called \"Stuff to include\" in a space keyed with NIC, you need to tell the macro NIC:Stuff to Include\r\nNote that the space key is case sensitive.\r\nIf that is not working, then can you describe what happens when you save a macro with such a macro embedded in it?\r\n\r\n________________________________________\r\n*The response I want to give him:*\r\n\r\nI am trying to use the macro include a page that is in the same space as the master document (New Space) and it's only finding pages in another space (Original Space).  \r\nSo one of the troubleshooting things I tried in desperation was treating the current space (New Space) like it was another space. It was just a shot it the dark.  \r\n\r\nEverything works great in the Original Space. We create original documents and include pages in them all they time. The content appears in the master document seamlessly. We love the way it works. I just need it to also work within New Space.\r\n\r\nThank you for any help you can give me.\r\n",
