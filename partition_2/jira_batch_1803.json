Findings\r\nI think this happens because Rich-Text Editor will take square brackets '[ ]' as a link. So any characters before the colon ':' within the square brackets '[ ]' will be considered as a Space Key. If there are more than 255 characters for that part - ie. before colon ':' within the square brackets '[ ]', this will cause an error because {{DESTSPACEKEY}} column in {{LINKS}} table can only hold 255 characters value as shown below:\r\n{noformat}\r\nmysql> desc links;\r\n+---------------+--------------+------+-----+---------+-------+\r\n| Field         | Type         | Null | Key | Default | Extra |\r\n+---------------+--------------+------+-----+---------+-------+\r\n| LINKID        | bigint(20)   | NO   | PRI | NULL    |       |\r\n| DESTPAGETITLE | varchar(255) | YES  |     | NULL    |       |\r\n| DESTSPACEKEY  | varchar(255) | NO   | MUL | NULL    |       |\r\n| CONTENTID     | bigint(20)   | NO   | MUL | NULL    |       |\r\n| CREATOR       | varchar(255) | YES  |     | NULL    |       |\r\n| CREATIONDATE  | datetime     | YES  |     | NULL    |       |\r\n| LASTMODIFIER  | varchar(255) | YES  |     | NULL    |       |\r\n| LASTMODDATE   | datetime     | YES  |     | NULL    |       |\r\n+---------------+--------------+------+-----+---------+-------+\r\n{noformat}\r\nThis bug has been tested in MySQL, Postgre and SQL Server.

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFCLOUD-20547].\n  {panel}\n\nThere seems to be some inconsistencies in the edit/view page-level restriction permissions.\r\n\r\nI searched the previously submitted bug reports and a lot of them have been resolved as \"Not a bug\". I at least disagree. Take the following example:\r\n\r\nWe have 2 administrators, admin1 restricts the page with the the view restriction to himself. This means that admin1 is added to the list of people who are able to view the page, all other users can not see the page except admin2 user (as he is an administrator, but he also cant see the page in the spaces page tree for example). \r\n\r\nNow, lets say the admin1 is on holiday and the restricted page needs editing. The admin2 user can not edit the page until he removes the restriction that admin has placed for himself. This is quite simple to do, but a small amount of unnecessary work. \r\n\r\nBut what if there were restrictions for 10 people? What if the groups and users are retrieved through LDAP and no logical group can be used, and 10 single restrictions were required? The admin2 user would first have to remove the 10 people from the restrictions, edit the page, then add the 10 people again (since no logical LDAP group can be used) This is totally unnecessary overhaul for the administrators. Administrators should be able to edit the page even though it is restricted to whoever. Of course we could create a LDAP group with those 10 users, but this too is an overhaul that some companies can not afford, and even with this resolution, the admin2 user would first have to remove the restriction, edit the page, then add it again. \r\n\r\nI understand from the previous submissions that this is how it is supposed to work, that the user does not accidentally see (i.e. in the spaces pagetree view) or accidentally edit a page (a restricted edit page) that he/she isnt supposed to edit, but the administrator should be on top of this and know the details. \r\n\r\nTo help the administrator notice the restriction, as a solution I suggest a new feature, that all restricted pages (view or edit) have a noticeable panel to the administrators that this is a restricted page, either view or edit, without removing the edit function from the page, because this creates unnecessary overhaul, one way or another.",

Run JIRA 4.2-SNAPSHOT standalone\r\n(https://jira.bamboo.atlassian.com/browse/QA-ENT-717/artifact/Standalone/atlassian-jira-enterprise-4.2-SNAPSHOT)\r\n2. Run Confluence 3.3 standalone\r\n(http://filehost/releases/confluence/downloads/confluence-3.3-std.tar.gz)\r\nchoosing the evaluation install during setup.\r\n3. Setup trusted apps between the two instances.\r\n4. Add the JIRA Pie Chart gadget as an external gadget in Confluence\r\n(e.g., http://cardinal.sydney.atlassian.com:8880/rest/gadgets/1.0/g/com.atlassian.jira.gadgets:pie-chart-gadget/gadgets/piechart-gadget.xml)\r\n5. In confluence, add a new page and in RTE mode, insert the JIRA pie\r\nchart gadget.\r\n\r\n*Expected*\r\n- The JIRA pie chart gadget macro text should be inserted into the RTE textarea.\r\n\r\n*Actual*\r\n- After clicking insert at step 5, nothing is added to the RTE textarea\r\n- Instead, there is a 403 response to a POST to\r\nhttp://cardinal.sydney.atlassian.com:7073/json/convertwikimarkuptoxhtmlwithoutpagewithspacekey.action\r\n- Adding any other macro after this 403 response also generates a 403 response.\r\n\r\nIf you use the wiki markup editor instead of the RTE, then inserting\r\nthe gadget works as normal.\r\n\r\nI came across this when verifying the bugfix for\r\nhttp://jdog.atlassian.com/browse/JRADEV-1903 (which is covered by\r\nhttp://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONF-20106).\r\n\r\nAny ideas on what is going wrong here? I'm not sure if it's a bug on\r\nthe JIRA side or not.\r\n\r\nIf you want a quick reproduction of the bug, feel free ping me and I\r\ncan setup up the instances for you to try it against.\r\n\r\nCheers\r\nNic",
