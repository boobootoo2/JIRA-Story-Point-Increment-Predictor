Summary\r\nThe _Main Header_ (the one with the breadcrumbs and action buttons) stays in front of the text when coming from a link that is below in the page.\r\n\r\nFor example, if we have an anchor in the middle of the page, then at the bottom of the page we have a link to that anchor, as soon as we click on that anchor link the page will scroll up to that anchor. Along with that automatic scrolling, the _main header_ will stay in front of the content.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Create a page with content\r\n# Add the Anchor macro in the middle of the page\r\n# Now keep adding content until you can't see the anchor without scrolling up\r\n# Add a link to the created anchor\r\n# Save the page\r\n# Access the page, scroll down to the word with the link to the anchor and click on it\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n* The page will scroll up and you'll see the content.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n* The page will scroll up but the main header will stay in front of the anchored content.\r\n \r\nh3. Notes\r\n* This also happens if you use the TOC macro.

This process is dramatically slower when Confluence Questions is installed - 2 hours+, vs 10m. This can lead to the thread being interrupted and the ancestors table being left completely empty, which causes permission issues.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to reproduce\r\n # Install CQ\r\n # Create some content, restrict a parent page, but do not restrict the children\r\n -- Confirm that the child pages inherit the restrictions from the parent\r\n -- Run\u00a0select count\\(*\\)\u00a0from CONFANCESTORS;\u00a0and confirm the count is > 0\r\n # Install Brikit Theme Press\r\n # Go to Configure Theme Press and click Install\r\n -- Run\u00a0select count\\(*\\)\u00a0from CONFANCESTORS;\u00a0and confirm the count is 0\r\n -- Test the child pages and confirm they are no longer restricted (NB: the parent page will still be restricted, but the children will not)\r\n # Run some thread dumps and confirm that the process is still running.\r\n\r\nThe issue seems to be in this section of the code path:\r\n{code}\r\nat

Currently, only copy & paste is possible to move a section.\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n- Make sections dragable. This way, you would drag the whole section to a different location, either on the same page or a different page, so long as both pages are in Edit mode.\r\nh3.

I was able to login and `systemctl restart confluence` to get it back online, but it would be helpful if Confluence's SysV-style init scripts were supplemented with systemd-aware service-management components. If Confluence were systemd-aware, then crashing of the main Java process likely could be made to auto-restart.\r\n\r\nYeah, we can construct our Confluence deployments to re-deploy on service-loss, but letting systemd handle simple cases such as this morning would be quicker than a re-deployment and make the question of clustering about scale rather than about availability.",

The workbox notification tray in the upper right of Confluence does not appear to be updated, and still references the old username. Clicking the link leads to an invalid profile page for a username that no longer exists.\r\n\r\nh2. Steps to reproduce\r\n# On a Confluence page, add a comment mentioning a user\r\n# Using the admin account, re-name the mentioned user (e.g., to user2)\r\n# In a separate browsing session, log in as the mentioned user. There should be a notification in the workbox tray from the mention.\r\n\r\nh2. Expected behavior\r\nThe workbox notification should have updated the user reference so that it is now showing user2\r\n\r\nh2. Actual behavior\r\nThe workbox notification is still showing the original username. Clicking it will point to the user profile page for the username that no longer exists, resulting in a page not found error.\r\n\r\nThe screenshot below demonstrates the stale username behavior in both the workbox notification tray as well as the link it is generating on mouse hover.\r\n\r\n !workbox_stale_username.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\nh2. Additional notes\r\nIt appears that these in-app notifications are stored in the table \"AO_9412A1_AONOTIFICATION\". The text is stored in the \"DESCRIPTION\" column, e.g.:\r\n{code}\r\n<p>hi&nbsp;<a class=\"confluence-userlink user-mention\" href=\"http://localhost:9002/display/~myuser\">myuser</a></p>\r\n{code}\r\nA comparison of the database before and after the rename shows that these entries are simply not being modified at all following a rename.",

Environment\r\n * Confluence 6.2.3\r\n * Team Calendars 5.3.19\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n*Environment setup*\r\n # In Confluence, add a valid mail server so that calendar event reminders and notifications can be emailed\r\n # Install Team Calendars Add-on\r\n # Create a Team Calendar\r\n\r\n*Steps to reproduce issue*\r\n # Create a team calendar event\r\n # Add a user to the event in *Who*\r\n # Add a reminder *5 minutes* before\r\n # Hit *OK* to save the event (save this with enough time before the event reminder should be sent)\r\n # Wait for the reminder email to be sent out\r\n # When the *Team Calendars Reminders* email is received\r\n # Try both links:\r\n ** Turn off reminders\r\n ** Link to the calendar event (event name)\r\n ** The link will direct to a page that.... looks all kinds of broken and not functional\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nThe links in the reminder email should take the user to the respective pages to view the event and/or turn off the reminders\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nSee screenshot for the page the links direct to. The page is not functional. The spinner keeps spinning. The buttons don't work.\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nThe user can login and navigate to the event manually to view the event details but they can't \"turn off reminders\". \r\n This documentation says there should be a \"Stop reminding me\" link in the email, but that doesn't exist. \r\n See: [https://confluence.atlassian.com/teamcal/reminders-693899708.html] (\"You can also opt-out of reminder emails for an event type by clicking the 'Stop reminding me' link in the reminder email.\")",

This can be a problem when the Mail Server or Mail Gateway considers the attachment as a potential risk and blocks the email.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Install Team Calendars 5.3.19 in a Confluence instance\r\n2. Configure a valid Mail Server\r\n3. Create two users:\r\n* user1, no profile picture, valid email\r\n* user2, upload a profile picture, valid email\r\n\r\n4. Log in as user1.\r\n5. Create an event and add both users as participants (\"Who\" field)\r\n6. Check the email configured in user2\r\n\r\nh3. Results\r\n\r\nThe generic profile picture linked to user1 comes with .png extension. The uploaded profile picture linked to user2 comes without extension.\r\n\r\nThere's no workaround since we cannot set the email format as Plain Text (https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFSERVER-23907) nor delete the existing user profile pictures once they have been uploaded (https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFSERVER-39313).",
