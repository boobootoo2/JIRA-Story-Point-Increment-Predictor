Issue Summary\r\n * When a user updates their timezone in their profile, the events in Team Calendar should update for their account, to show the event time according to their timezone. This is not happening, and the event time remains the same as before their timezone was updated.\r\n * Due to\u00a0ID-7800, even though some users have a timezone manually configured in [the Atlassian account preferences|https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/account-preferences], when looking at the timezone of the profile in Confluence (via profile picture >\u00a0*Settings*\u00a0/\u00a0 https://<SITE-NAME>.atlassian.net/wiki/users/viewmysettings.action), it shows \"site default\u00a0- UTC/GMT+0000). This causes the events to be displayed at the wrong time and/or day.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Log in as a user, and confirm that a time-zone value is set under the Account preference.\r\n ** [https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/account-preferences]\r\n # Confirm that the timezone on the site matches the time-zone above.

Actual Results\r\n * Event time remains the same despite the user's timezone being updated.\r\n * This is for new events as well, and no matter what, we cannot get the event times to sync between users.\r\n * For the root cause tied to ID-7800, events are displayed on a different day/time than is currently expected.

In this specific scenario, re-updating the timezone in\u00a0\r\n * [https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/account-preferences]\u00a0might help after around 24 hours.\r\n\r\nh3.
