After careful thought and analysis, we wish to advise that we will not be implementing any form of forum functionality in Confluence.

For the first 2, it works correctly, but for new comments, the title is always \"Comment Added for <SPACE>:Home\" (where <SPACE> is the name of the space), even though the comment was added to some other page (not Home) within that space.  I have seen this consistently, i.e., *all* RSS items for added comments say Home instead of the actual page name.  Interestingly, the link is correct, so when I click on the link for these items it takes me to the correct comment on the correct page (where the comment was actually added).\r\n\r\nHere's the source of the RSS item:\r\n\r\n<html>\r\n\t<head>\r\n\t\t<style type=\"text/css\">\r\n\t\t\tbody {font-family:Verdana,Sans-serif; font-size:10pt; margin:0; padding:0; background:#fff; color:#000}\r\n\t\t\ttd,form {font-family:Verdana,Sans-serif; font-size:10pt;}\r\n\t\t\tA {color:#66c; text-decoration: none;}\r\n\t\t\tA.black {color:#000; text-decoration: none;}\r\n\t\t\tA:hover, A:active {text-decoration: underline;}\r\n\t\t</style>\r\n\t\t<base href=\"http://myserver/confluence/display/FOO\">\r\n\t</head>\r\n\t<body>\r\n\t\t<table width=\"100%\" bgcolor=\"#cccccc\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"0\">\r\n\t\t\t<tr><td>\r\n        &nbsp;<a href=\"http://myserver/confluence/display/FOO\" class=\"black\"><b>Feed: </b>Foo - Comments</a><br/>\r\n        &nbsp;<a href=\"http://myserver/confluence/display/FOO/My+Page?showComments=true#comment-9110\" class=\"black\"><b>Title: </b>Comment Added for FOO:Home</a>\r\n\t\t\t</td><td align=\"right\">\r\n\t\t\t</td></tr>\r\n\t\t\t<tr bgcolor=\"#666666\" height=\"1\"><td colspan=\"2\"></td></tr>\r\n\t\t</table>\r\n\t\t<table width=\"100%\" cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"2\" border=\"0\"><tr><td>\r\n\r\n<p>Page contents.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t</td></tr></table>\r\n\t</body>\r\n</html>",

The Confluence team is proud to announce that we will have this feature implemented in the upcoming Confluence 4.0 (due out in a few weeks).\r\n\r\nPlease note that this feature has been implemented for Chrome and FireFox. Unfortunately, we could not implement this in Internet Explorer due to IE not having the appropriate support for the Clipboard API. We do intend on implementing this for IE once this is complete. You can track that issue here: CONF-23235 \r\n\r\nPlease note: Confluence does have [existing drag-drop functionality|http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Drag-and-Drop] which will allow you to easily drag-and-drop images into the editor (which works for Internet Explorer 8. Note: It does [not work in IE9 due to similar limitations|http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/CONFKB/Drag+and+drop+does+not+work+in+Internet+Explorer+9+%28IE9%29]).\r\n\r\n{panel}",

It should be possible to let specific people (not admins) to manage specific groups - add/remove users.\r\n2. It should be possible to add users to a group when displaying a group and not only add groups to a user\r\n3. The navigation, filtering, etc. of the list of users is very difficult and inconsistent.\r\n4. It should be possible to delete users even if they added content. They could remain hiding underneath for the content to be related to them but even this should be optional, and any way as an admin I shouldn't need to manage them.\r\n5. It should be possible to diasble a user from the user display\r\n6. A user should be able to rename his user name.\r\n7. It would be great if I could consolidate users. Like in the case when a user signed in, edited content, and then changed his login and added more content. Then I'd like to combine the two users into a single one. (that's a bonus after all previous elements will be implemented)\r\n",
