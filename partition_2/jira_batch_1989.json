PLEASE SEE RELEVANT TICKETS BELOW|borderStyle=solid|borderColor=#ff7f7f|titleBGColor=#ff7f7f|bgColor=#e5e5e5}\r\n*Status Update 28 July 2021*\r\n Hi all,\r\n\r\nThis is Ethan from the Atlassian Editor Team. Thank you for the continuous feedback on performance improvement needs within the Confluence editing experience. This is a top priority for Atlassian teams.\u00a0\r\n\r\nI want to direct your attention to some new tickets that have been created to provide more focused updates on specific performance related issues.\u00a0We will be actively monitoring the tickets below, and ask that you you to vote and follow the tickets which detail the specific performance issue affecting you and your team:\r\n||Theme||Ticket||\r\n|1. Slowness rendering Non-Content PAGE FEATURES when\u00a0VIEWING a Confluence page\u00a0|CONFCLOUD-72517|\r\n|2. Slowness rendering IN-PAGE CONTENT when VIEWING a large Confluence page|CONFCLOUD-72518|\r\n|3. Slowness initially rendering a large Confluence page in EDIT mode|CONFCLOUD-72519|\r\n|4. Keyboard typing delays while trying to EDIT a Confluence page|CONFCLOUD-72520|\r\n|5. Changes are lost and unsaved after EDITING a Confluence page|CONFCLOUD-72521|\r\n|6. Inability or delay of publishing EDITS to a Confluence page|CONFCLOUD-72522|\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nBecause not all performance issues stem from the same cause, we are aggregating potentially disparate issues within this ticket. We can continue to do so with your help in providing additional details on what your page contains. If you are able to remove elements and see performance improvements, sharing that information can help us narrow our focus on key elements that are slowing page performance.\r\n\r\nThanks all and stay safe,\r\n\r\nEthan\r\n{panel}\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nWe are experiencing very slow page load time. Looks like it's not only us but lots of users are seeing same experience. See this thread (has 6.4k views as of April 2020)\u00a0 [https://community.atlassian.com/t5/Confluence-questions/Jira-and-Confluence-Cloud-is-toooooo-slow/qaq-p/744373|https://community.atlassian.com/t5/Confluence-questions/Jira-and-Confluence-Cloud-is-toooooo-slow/qaq-p/744373#U1340387]\r\n\r\nTop poster even posted Google pagespeed score of 4.\r\n\r\nWe measured our instance and it has page speed score of 13 for mobile and 27 for desktop. I think this is too low for such a top product like Confluence or Jira. See report: [https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbitwelt.atlassian.net%2Fwiki%2Fspaces%2Fbit%2Foverview%3Fmode%3Dglobal&tab=desktop]\r\n\r\nWe have another private instance where about 500 JS files are loaded on each page load. A lot of them seem to come from team calendar (which we have disabled but js files are still loaded), see screenshot.\r\n\r\nPlease prioritize page speed/performance.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0",

Expected Results\r\n\r\nRequest received on your backend app should include the\u00a0*space.key*.\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\n*space.key*\u00a0is not passed.\r\n{noformat}\r\n...\r\n{noformat}\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nCurrently there is no known workaround for this behavior.

Expected Results\r\nAfter creating the issue, the page reloads and the *JIRA Links* button is shown at the top of the page, linking it to the just created issue.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nThe page reloads, but the JIRA issue link is not there.\r\n\r\n*Notes* \r\n* In the JIRA issue, the page is also not linked there.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\nCopy the JIRA issue URL and paste it into the Confluence page (you can also manually link the page within the JIRA issue).",

If I spend the time to individually show/hide the fields, through the current arduous process, to create a specific field configuration and associate it with a scheme, shouldn't it only be affected by directly modifying it? However, if a custom field is created it will not only appear in the setup I just created, but all other setups in our Jira instance.\r\n\r\nWhat is the point in configurations and schemes for fields then? When creating a custom field, one of the steps is to select a screen to associate it with but there is no step to select a field configuration to associate it with. Afterwards the field you create will perpetuate itself throughout all the configurations.\r\n\r\nSuggestions:\r\n # When creating a field configuration, would it be possible to do this as a bulk selection process instead of showing/hiding one field at a time?\r\n # When creating a custom field, would it be possible to have an additional step to select the field configurations you would like to associate it with?\r\n # With the help of suggestion 2, if Jira's base behavior was set to hide all incoming custom fields, then current field configurations would not be affected by the creation of new fields. This will add value to the setup of fields, as they are currently affected by indirect influences where all the other setups are not.\r\n\r\n\u00a0",
