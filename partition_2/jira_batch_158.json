Summary\r\nWhen importing to the Cloud, the import fails on the validation stage with this error:\r\n{code}\r\nImport error\r\n\r\nThere was an error importing file jira-export (4).zip: Validation failed. Following issues were reported:\r\nCannot complete the import because one of the import files contains the following duplicate workflows: 'workflow 1'. Search the Atlassian Administrator Knowledge Base for instructions on how to fix this, or contact Atlassian Support for help.\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nThis happens when there are Workflows with the same name in the Backup file.

Custom content objects have no specific prefix in server, but a prefix of 'ac:' in cloud. For example, a server app may have a custom content object {{app-foo-document-for-confluence:document}} but the cloud version of the app will have a custom content object {{ac:app-foo-document-for-confluence:document}}.\r\n\r\nWhen exporting spaces on server and importing them into cloud (which is what the migration assistant does by default), the {{ac:}} prefix is not added to the custom content objects. As a result, the documents are not picked up by the APIs and therefore not available in the cloud version of the app.\r\n\r\nAtlassian should take care of adding this prefix as part of the Migration assistant task.\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Install Scroll Documents on Confluence server\r\n # Create a document in any space from the Document Library\r\n # Migrate the space to a cloud instance using the Atlassian Migration Assistant\r\n\r\nh3.

Actual Results\r\n\r\nThe Document is not available in the Document Library on Cloud.\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nThe following workaround exists, but is not scalable:\r\n # Create a space export from server that has a Scroll Document created\r\n # Unzip the space export zip file\r\n # In the {{entities.xml}} file manually add the prefix to all occurrences of the custom content instances in the {{CustomContentEntityObject}} object\r\n{code:xml}\r\n    <property name=\"pluginModuleKey\"><![CDATA[ac:k15t-scroll-document-versions-for-confluence:document]]></property>\r\n    {code}\r\n\r\n # Repackage the space export archive\r\n # Import to Cloud\u00a0\r\n\r\nh3.

Examples may be.\r\n * When users have left the company, it no longer makes sense to have to fix their email address and have them created in Cloud\r\n * There are thousands of user preflight checks and the time / effort to fix these is high but data loss is likely to be very low to nil.\r\n * Users are not relevant to the migration as they come from external directories.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThis feature would be providing an option for the blocking pre-flight check to be converted in to a softer pre-flight check, where the user could dismiss the invalid/duplicate user preflights.

Actual Results\r\n\r\nThe migration completes partially, and some issues will be missing attachments.\r\n\r\nThe below exception is thrown in the atlassian-jira.log file:\r\n\r\n{noformat}\r\n020-08-01 14:04:49,878-0400 pool-419-thread-5 WARN xxxxxx 659x6686x4 1w4yjib xxxxxx /rest/plugins/1.0/installed-marketplace [c.a.j.m.workers.attachments.AttachmentProcessor] xxxxxxxxxx-attachmentsUpload#xxxxxx$xxxxxxx: error in attachments upload task for project key xxxxxxxx\r\ncom.atlassian.jira.migration.workers.attachments.AttachmentUploadException: com.atlassian.jira.issue.attachment.AttachmentReadException: com.atlassian.jira.migration.mediaclient.MediaClientErrorException: request to Media failed\r\ncom.atlassian.jira.migration.workers.attachments.AttachmentsUploader.uploadAttachments(AttachmentsUploader.kt:89)\r\ncom.atlassian.jira.migration.workers.attachments.AttachmentProcessor.process(AttachmentsWorker.kt:97)\r\ncom.atlassian.jira.migration.workers.attachments.AttachmentsWorker.process(AttachmentsWorker.kt:52)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.jira.migration.tracking.polling.Poller.dispatchTask(Poller.kt:116)\r\ncom.atlassian.jira.migration.tracking.polling.Poller.pollForTaskAndDispatch(Poller.kt:111)\r\ncom.atlassian.jira.migration.tracking.polling.Poller.pollForTaskAndDispatchNoThrow(Poller.kt:65)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.jira.migration.tracking.polling.Poller.doPoll(Poller.kt:50)\r\ncom.atlassian.jira.migration.tracking.polling.AbstractPoller.execute(AbstractPoller.kt:62)\r\ncom.atlassian.jira.migration.tracking.polling.AbstractPoller.access$execute(AbstractPoller.kt:16)\r\ncom.atlassian.jira.migration.tracking.polling.AbstractPoller$startPolling$1.invoke(AbstractPoller.kt:35)\r\ncom.atlassian.jira.migration.tracking.polling.AbstractPoller$startPolling$1.invoke(AbstractPoller.kt:16)\r\ncom.atlassian.jira.migration.tracking.utils.ThreadUtils.safeExecutePeriodicallyUntilStopped(ThreadUtils.kt:43)\r\ncom.atlassian.jira.migration.tracking.polling.AbstractPoller.startPolling(AbstractPoller.kt:34)\r\ncom.atlassian.jira.migration.tracking.MigrationTracker$addAndStartWorkPoller$1$1.run(MigrationTracker.kt:77)\r\n\tat java.util.concurrent.Executors$RunnableAdapter.call(Executors.java:511)\r\n\tat java.util.concurrent.FutureTask.run(FutureTask.java:266)\r\n\tat java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.runWorker(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:1149)\r\n\tat java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor$Worker.run(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:624)\r\n\tat java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:748)\r\nCaused by: com.atlassian.jira.issue.attachment.AttachmentReadException: com.atlassian.jira.issue.attachment.AttachmentReadException: com.atlassian.jira.migration.mediaclient.MediaClientErrorException: request to Media failed\r\n\tat sun.reflect.NativeConstructorAccessorImpl.newInstance0(Native Method)\r\nsun.reflect.NativeConstructorAccessorImpl.newInstance(NativeConstructorAccessorImpl.java:62)\r\nsun.reflect.DelegatingConstructorAccessorImpl.newInstance(DelegatingConstructorAccessorImpl.java:45)\r\n\tat java.lang.reflect.Constructor.newInstance(Constructor.java:423)\r\n\tat java.util.concurrent.ForkJoinTask.getThrowableException(ForkJoinTask.java:593)\r\ncom.atlassian.jira.migration.workers.attachments.AttachmentsUploader.uploadAttachments(AttachmentsUploader.kt:74)\r\nCaused by: com.atlassian.jira.issue.attachment.AttachmentReadException: com.atlassian.jira.migration.mediaclient.MediaClientErrorException: request to Media failed\r\ncom.atlassian.jira.issue.attachment.store.DefaultFileSystemAttachmentStore$3.call(DefaultFileSystemAttachmentStore.java:152)\r\nio.atlassian.util.concurrent.Executors$DefaultSubmitter$CallableRunner.run(Executors.java:85)\r\n\tat io.atlassian.util.concurrent.LimitedExecutor$Runner.run(LimitedExecutor.java:94)\r\nCaused by: com.atlassian.jira.migration.mediaclient.MediaClientErrorException: request to Media failed\r\ncom.atlassian.jira.migration.mediaclient.MediaClient.updateUpload(MediaClient.kt:128)\r\ncom.atlassian.jira.migration.workers.attachments.AttachmentsUploader$uploadAttachmentContent$1.withInputStream(AttachmentsUploader.kt:169)\r\ncom.atlassian.jira.migration.workers.attachments.AttachmentsUploader$uploadAttachmentContent$1.withInputStream(AttachmentsUploader.kt:31)\r\ncom.atlassian.jira.issue.managers.DefaultAttachmentManager$7.apply(DefaultAttachmentManager.java:731)\r\ncom.atlassian.jira.issue.managers.DefaultAttachmentManager$7.apply(DefaultAttachmentManager.java:727)\r\ncom.atlassian.jira.issue.attachment.store.DefaultFileSystemAttachmentStore$2.apply(DefaultFileSystemAttachmentStore.java:127)\r\ncom.atlassian.jira.issue.attachment.store.DefaultFileSystemAttachmentStore$2.apply(DefaultFileSystemAttachmentStore.java:124)\r\ncom.atlassian.jira.issue.attachment.store.DefaultFileSystemAttachmentStore$3.call(DefaultFileSystemAttachmentStore.java:150)\r\nCaused by: com.atlassian.jira.migration.httpclient.exceptions.UnexpectedStatusCodeException: Received an unexpected status code;

      "description": "h3. Issue Summary\r\n\r\nWhen a role is migrated using JCMA, there are situations where roles are migrated again with a <role_name> + (migrated) appended to each subsequent migration. This causes a lot of post-migration cleanup. The de-duplication process is tedious & risky as all of the duplicated role references in (multiple) project settings needs to be carefully remapped to the original role before deleting the duplicates. This gets onerous when many roles and projects are migrated.\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Run a migration with a few projects\r\n # When a role is migrated the first time along with these first few projects, the Jira Cloud Migration Assistant records the mapping and for subsequent migrations, it re-links to the role as per\u00a0[https://confluence.atlassian.com/cloud/how-the-jira-cloud-migration-assistant-links-your-data-993925217.html]\r\n # At times, Atlassian Support may be contacted for troubleshooting and the mapping logic (scope table) is reset\r\n # This the results in\u00a0<role_name> + (migrated 2)... and then (migrate 3), (migrated 4) each time the mapping logic is reset\r\n # De-duplicate roles in Cloud post-migration.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\n\u00a0We are conducting customer interviews to develop improvements to:\r\n * *Default behaviour*\u00a0as documented in\u00a0[https://confluence.atlassian.com/cloud/how-the-jira-cloud-migration-assistant-links-your-data-993925217.html]\u00a0\r\n * *<role_name> + (migrated) being appended*\u00a0often results\u00a0from re-migration or clean up situations where roles are being deleted and then migration scope tables are reset by Atlassian Support. We expect this to be mostly addressed in\u00a0MIG-163\u00a0Better handling of deleted objects with the Jira Cloud Migration Assistant\r\n * *Potential improvements to enable you to make a decision on whether to merge an object or not.*\u00a0Our current defaults are designed so that the migration does not disturb existing data already in your Jira Cloud site ie. by default we currently do\u00a0not perform data merges on unrelated objects\r\n\r\nPlease comment if you have use cases you would like us to consider.",
