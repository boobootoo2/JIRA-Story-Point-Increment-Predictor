It seems to always be about halfway down the list, which I suspect is an artifact of the number of commits I have; SourceTree will sometimes say it's loading 300 commits, which would put it at about the halfway mark.

Here's what I did:\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n1) Have some changes in the working dir.\r\n\r\n2) Realize I'm on the wrong branch\r\n\r\n3) Switch to default branch\r\n\r\n4) Get an erro saying that I have uncomitted changed. So what?? Switch the goddamn branch!!\r\n\r\n5) Give up and shelve my changes\r\n\r\n6) Switch to default branch\r\n\r\n7) Make the branch I'm suposed to commit in\r\n\r\n8) Switch to it\r\n\r\n9) Unshelve my changes\r\n\r\n10) This produces some conflicts\r\n\r\n11) Solve the conflicts\r\n\r\n12) Commit\r\n\r\n13) Error: unshelve already in progress. WTF? Just let me commit my goddamn code!! SourceTree, if you get this error, solve it yourself. Don't tell me to execute some command.\r\n\r\n14) Try the suggestion (hg unshelve \u2013continue). Doesn't work. The \"unshelve\" command doesn't exist. So don't bloody suggest it then, FFS!!\r\n\r\n15) I also can't update to a previous commit. Same error.\r\n\r\n16) Ohh, I can strip to a previous commit. But any path will lead to the same error again.\r\n\r\n17) Delete the shelve and try yet again. Same error. An unshelve is already in progress... with 0 shelves existing. Absolutely bloody brilliant this.\r\n\r\n18) Try the same thing from WLS. Doesn't work. Unshelve can be installed from there, but it says it's the wrong version. I'm done with this now. I'm going to resort to unreasonable force.\r\n\r\n19) Go into my repo\\.hg, and DELETE every file that has the word \"shelve\" in the name.\r\n\r\n20) Fixed. FINALLY.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPlease, Atlassian, this is utterly ridiculous. It shouldn't be so goddamn hard to switch branches while already having some changes. Test those features, and test them well please.\r\n\r\nI almost lost my work a few times. That's quite the opposite of SourceTree's purpose, innit. Good thing I created a patch file.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nBtw, I'm on 2.4.8.0, but this Jira says that version doesn't exist. It sure does.",

Refreshing the account password via SourceTree UI (Tools>Options>Accounts) shows as succeeded, but does not resolve authentication error.\r\n\r\nThe only fairly reliable workaround we've found is to remove the \"passwd\" file located at \"C:\\Users\\<user>\\AppData\\Local\\Atlassian\\SourceTree\", restarting SourceTree, and then re-doing the operation.

The login fails with the message \"failed to check login for user [{username}]\".\r\n\r\nThe log has the following entries:\r\nERROR [timestamp] [1] [SourceTree.Exceptions.RemoteHostException] [.ctor] - Insufficient authentication credentials\r\nERROR [timestamp] [1] [SourceTree.Exceptions.RemoteHostException] [.ctor] - Failed to check login for user [{username}]\r\n\r\nThe root URL ( \"https://\\{server\\}.\\{domain\\}/\\{context\\}/\" ), username and password are the same ones I use when successfully logging into Bitbucket in Internet Explorer on the same PC.\r\n\r\nMy username does not include any special characters such as the '@' symbol.\r\n\r\nI have tried the suggestions in the following:\r\nhttps://community.atlassian.com/t5/Sourcetree-questions/Getting-this-error-quot-Something-went-wrong-while-attempting-to/qaq-p/805220\r\nhttps://community.atlassian.com/t5/Sourcetree-questions/Looking-for-more-details-on-login-error/qaq-p/802237\r\n\r\nWhat additional authentication credentials should be supplied, and how?\r\n\r\nIt seems rather over the top to raise a bug when I suspect all I'm missing is some documentation on how to set SourceTree up correctly, but I can't seem to find anything and the community question I raised hasn't received any responses (https://community.atlassian.com/t5/Sourcetree-questions/SourceTree-Enterprise-quot-failed-to-check-login-for-user-quot/qaq-p/810106).\r\n\r\nh2. *Cause*\r\n\r\nAs of Sourcetree for Windows v2.5.5, it appears that the login to local Bitbucket Server instance will fail with \"failed to check login for user [{username}]\" when Bitbucket Server is on a context path (e.g. https://internal.mysite.com/bitbucket).\r\n\r\nh2. *Work around*\r\n\r\n# Use Sourcetree for Windows v2.4.8.0; or\r\n# Temporarily drop the context path by changing the Base URL of Bitbucket to say just https://internal.mysite.com. e.g.\r\n#* Update reverse proxy *from* \"/bitbucket\" -> http://<bitbucketserver>:<port>/bitbucket *to* \"/\" -> http://<bitbucketserver>:<port>/\r\n#* Deleted the {{server.context-path}} line out of bitbucket.properties\r\n#* Updated the Bitbucket Administration \u00bb Base URL to just https://internal.mysite.com\r\n#* Restart Bitbucket\r\n#* Perform the login into Sourcetree and hopefully it succeeds this time\r\n#* Once all the users have installed Sourcetree, you can revert Bitbucket back to the Context Path /bitbucket\r\n#* Now that you are in Sourcetree, you should be able to Clone a REPO from https://internal.mysite.com/bitbucket and do all things branch, commit, push, pull, etc...\r\n",

      "description": "EDIT: This probably is about the newline chracters used: The offending lines are separated by just CR instead of CRLF, in other places in the file there is a CR&LF used - As \"only\" CR is also a valid newline character it is still a bug, imo.\u00a0 btw: Bitbucket displays the solo CR as a special character in the same line, and does not do a newline, so that is inconsistent with ST, too.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nORIGINAL POST\r\n\r\nI overwrote a .tex file with another version of it. The version on disk is now exactly as i want it. Sourcetree is showing the file as altered, but not all alterations are shown, and some nonexistent alterations are shown. Additionally the line-numbering is off.\r\n\r\nSee attached Screenshot: (yellow highlighted regions)\r\n\r\nI opened the file in Notepad++ to show the real content, and you can see in the background the Sourcetree diff, with wrong line numbering (observe that the real /begin->/end block is four lines from 40 to 43 and the Sourcetree diff is a weird /begin->/end/end block) and, very importantly: *A line that does not exist anymore (Sourcetree line 36) is not marked as missing!*\r\n\r\nI tried commiting, the commit works with the real file, and also reverts fine, but the shown diff is always wrong. Altering stuff in N++ and saving resulted in a still wrong diff, that some times showed a +/- of lines that were unaltered and mostly showed the altered line (i experimented with the Windows 8 line ) as unaltered.\r\n\r\nA diff using the diff tool from TortoiseGit was normal and correct.\r\n\r\nJust to be clear: I doublechecked that N++ and Sourcetree are seeing the same file, by altering it in N++ and seeing the file change in Sourcetree - so this is not about looking at different files, this is some bug(?) in the ST-Diff (not the actual storing of files, just the showing of the differences)\r\n\r\nIn Bitbucket, the file is shown in a way that makes me think this is about encoding: See attached screenshot: \"Line 33\" in reality is four lines (and shows, if copy pasted into N++, as four lines), but some weird special characters are shown at the linebreak. (See Screenshot of old version of the file, with \"Windows 8\"-line still in)",
