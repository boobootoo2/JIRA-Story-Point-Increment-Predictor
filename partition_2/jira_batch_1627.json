Scenario\r\n\r\nTwo users are editing a newly created page, whereby user A created the page and passed the URL {{<base-url>/pages/resumedraft.action?draftId=xxxxx&draftShareId=xxxxx}}\u00a0to user B.\r\nh5. Outcome #1\r\n\r\nIf user A closes the editor (as the creator of the page draft), user B will not be able to publish the changes or close the editor.\r\nh5. Outcome #2\r\n\r\nIf user B closes the editor, the user gets an error in the top-right corner of the editor that says, \"There were errors discarding your draft. An unknown error has occurred. Please check your logs.\"\r\nh3. Steps to reproduce\r\n # Login as user A in a browser and login as user B in incognito browser.\r\n # As user A, create a new page.\r\n # Copy paste the link in incognito browser so user B can join the editing session.\r\n # Add some text.\r\n\r\nh5. For outcome #1\r\n # Get user A to click on 'Close' and 'Discard everyone's changes'.\r\n # Afterwards, get user B to try to publish the page.\r\n\r\nh5.

All other browsers and Operating Systems will not exhibit this behavior.\r\n\r\n!Screen Shot 2017-01-06 at 11.16.14 AM.png|thumbnail!\r\nh3. Environment\r\n * OS - Windows 10\r\n * Browser - IE11\r\n * Database - MS SQL\r\n * Confluence - 6.0.x, 5.10.x (Since this issue is related to Windows Policy, it will occur on any version that has untrusted fonts)\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to reproduce\r\n # Install Confluence on a Windows 10 machine\r\n # IE 11 is installed on Windows 10, you can search for IE to open the browser\r\n # Log into Confluence\r\n # Along the navigation bar, you will notice the icons are missing\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nIcons appear in the navigation bar\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nIcons are missing (please see screenshot)\r\nh3. Failed Resolution Steps\r\n * Adding Font CSS - [Styling Fonts in Confluence|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Styling+Fonts+in+Confluence]\r\n * \r\n{quote}To fix your apps by installing the problematic fonts (recommended)\r\n\r\nOn each computer that has the app installed, right-click the font name, and then click Install.\r\n\r\nThe font should automatically install into your %windir%/Fonts directory. If it does not, you have to manually copy the font files into the Fonts directory and run the installation from there.\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nh3. Cause\r\n\r\nWindows 10 has a default security feature that blocks certain fonts: [https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3053676]\r\nh3. Workaround 1\r\n\r\n*Disable this feature:*\r\nh5. Using Group Policy\r\n # Open Local Group Policy Editor.\r\n # Under Local Computer Policy, expand Computer Configuration, expand Administrative Templates, expand System, and then click Mitigation Options.\r\n # In the Untrusted Font Blocking setting, you can see the following options:\r\n ** Block untrusted fonts and log events\r\n ** Do not block untrusted fonts\r\n ** Log events without blocking untrusted fonts\r\n\r\nh5. Using Registry Editor\r\n # Open Registry Editor (regedit.exe) and go to the following registry subkey:\r\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Session Manager\\Kernel\\\r\n # If the MitigationOptions key is not there, right-click and add a new QWORD (64-bit) Value, naming it as MitigationOptions.\r\n # Update the Value data of the MitigationOptions key, and make sure that you keep your existing value, like the important note below:\r\n ** To turn this feature on. Type 1000000000000.\r\n ** To turn this feature off. Type 2000000000000.\r\n ** To audit with this feature. Type 3000000000000.\r\nImportant Your existing MitigationOptions values should be saved during your update. For example, if the current value is 1000, your updated value should be 1000000001000.\r\n # Restart your computer.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround 2\r\n\r\n*Install the svg icons plugin:*\r\n # This workaround affects all users of your site and adds about 58KB of compressed CSS. For comparison, we already load 150KB of CSS and 700KB of JS on a View Page. These will be cached by the browser most of the time.\r\n # Download the plugin here:\u00a0[^confluence-svg-icons-0.1.1.jar]\r\n # Install the plugin on your instance.\r\n # The plugin replaces the icons loaded by the font with icons from the custom css provided by the plugin. The icons are base64 encoded svg background-images instead of the atlassian-icons font.\r\n # Clearing the browser cache might be required to see the effect.\r\n # Note that this plugin will not make the CSS3114 error disappear as the font will continue to be blocked by the security policy.\r\n # As this plugin will affect all the users of the site, even users using Confluence on other browsers will get this change.\r\n # This plugin is provided as-is and is not supported by Atlassian.\r\n\r\n(!) In Confluence 6.11 and 6.12 the plugin will hide some icons. Not suitable for these versions.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround 3\r\n\r\n*Install the font and custom CSS*:\r\n # This workaround could work for individual users who are using Confluence with IE11 on Windows 10.\r\n # This workaround is designed specifically for Windows 10 with Internet Explorer 11, and stems from this Microsoft article about the security policy. [https://technet.microsoft.com/itpro/windows/keep-secure/block-untrusted-fonts-in-enterprise]\r\n # For this Workaround to work the font files will need to be installed on every computer affected by the Security Policy that is using IE11.\r\n # Download the .ttf file that corresponds to your Confluence version\r\n ** \r\n *** Confluence Latest:\u00a0[https://aui-cdn.atlassian.com/aui-adg/6.0.6/css/fonts/atlassian-icons.ttf]\r\n *** Confluence 6.0: [https://aui-cdn.atlassian.com/aui-adg/5.10.1/css/fonts/atlassian-icons.ttf]\r\n *** Confluence\u00a05.10: [https://aui-cdn.atlassian.com/aui-adg/5.9.24/css/fonts/atlassian-icons.ttf]\r\n *** Confluence 5.9:\u00a0[https://aui-cdn.atlassian.com/aui-adg/5.7.34/css/fonts/atlassian-icons.ttf|https://aui-cdn.atlassian.com/aui-adg/6.0.6/css/fonts/atlassian-icons.ttf]\r\n *** Confluence 5.8:\u00a0[https://aui-cdn.atlassian.com/aui-adg/5.7.26/css/fonts/atlassian-icons.ttf|https://aui-cdn.atlassian.com/aui-adg/6.0.6/css/fonts/atlassian-icons.ttf]\r\n *** Confluence 5.7:\u00a0[https://aui-cdn.atlassian.com/aui-adg/5.7.20/css/fonts/atlassian-icons.ttf|https://aui-cdn.atlassian.com/aui-adg/6.0.6/css/fonts/atlassian-icons.ttf]\r\n *** Confluence 5.6 and 5.5:\u00a0[^atlassian-icons-confluence-5.6.ttf]\r\n # Install the font locally on Windows (Right-click > Install, or move it to the C:\\Windows\\Fonts directory).

      "description": "h2. Problem summary\r\nIn comparison to Confluence 5.8.x (and possibly earlier versions), Confluence 5.9.x and 5.10.x is much slower at the following events as part of an LDAP Connector directory sync. These are two of the events that are part of {{UserIndexingListener.java}}:\r\n* Pulling in large numbers of new users (\"onUserAddEvent\" in both 5.8 and 5.9+)\r\n* Removing larger numbers of users from a group (\"onMembershipDeletedEvent\", added in 5.9+).\r\n\r\nh2. Steps to reproduce the slow \"onUserAddEvent\"\r\nAs this is a bug report for a performance regression, we must compare 5.8 performance with later versions by carrying out the same steps:\r\n# Create an LDAP server with a significant amount of users. The one I used contained 50k, for reference.\r\n# Add these users into a single LDAP group\r\n# In Confluence, navigate to Confluence Admin > Logging & Profiling and set package \"com.atlassian.confluence.user.crowd\" to DEBUG\r\n# In Confluence, navigate to Confluence Admin > User Directories and create a new user LDAP or AD user directory\r\n# Configure directory to be able to see all of the users and the one group\r\n# Save the directory, which will begin the sync\r\n# Tail the logs and look for the \"onUserAddEvent\" event, e.g.:\r\n{code}\r\n...\r\n2017-01-05 19:40:20,346 DEBUG [scheduler_Worker-1] [confluence.user.crowd.UserIndexingListener] onUserAddEvent User added: example_user_1\r\n2017-01-05 19:40:20,718 DEBUG [scheduler_Worker-1] [confluence.user.crowd.UserIndexingListener] onUserAddEvent User added: example_user_2\r\n...\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nh2. Steps to reproduce the slow \"onMembershipDeletedEvent\"\r\n# In a 5.9+ environment, first go through the above steps to sync a large number of users and one group\r\n# After the on the LDAP side, remove all users from the group\r\n# In the Confluence UI, sync again\r\n# Tail the logs and look for the \"onMembershipDeletedEvent\"\r\n\r\nh2. Performance comparisons between versions\r\n* In Confluence 5.8.18, about 80-100 of the \"onUserAddEvent\" records would be printed per second, reflecting the rate of users being added. The rate of processing appears to be consistent and does not slow down. \"onMembershipDeletedEvent\" does not appear at all in 5.8 (but users are still removed from group as expected).\r\n* In Confluence 5.9.12 or 5.10.8, the \"onUserAddEvent\" and \"onMembershipDeletedEvent\" both start out relatively fast at 50 users per second, before quickly dwindling down to 15 per second, 8 per second, 3 per second, etc. This has a significant impact on overall directory sync duration. During this time the User Directory UI will show \"Adding X users to the cache\" and \"Removing X users from group\", respectively.\r\n\r\nOne can also use the command below to quickly see how many user records are processed per second on each event, by parsing Confluence logs:\r\n{code}\r\ngrep 'onUserAddEvent' /path/to/confluence/logs/atlassian-confluence.log | cut -c 1-19 | uniq -c\r\n{code}\r\n{code}\r\ngrep 'onMembershipDeletedEvent' /path/to/confluence/logs/atlassian-confluence.log | cut -c 1-19 | uniq -c\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nOutput will look like the below, grouped by each second. The first line, for example, indicates that during the 19:48:00 second, just 2 instances of \"onUserAddEvent\" were recorded:\r\n{code}\r\n   2 2017-01-05 19:48:00\r\n   3 2017-01-05 19:48:01\r\n   2 2017-01-05 19:48:02\r\n   2 2017-01-05 19:48:03\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nh2. Notes\r\n* I do not suspect this to be a problem with underlying Crowd libraries, rather how Confluence processes new users. Hence, this bug is not filed against Crowd.\r\n* This is not related to the 5.10 audit logging feature, as the problem can be reproduced in 5.9\r\n* This is possibly related (but not confirmed) to Embedded Crowd versions between each application, or an issue within Confluence itself. See table below\r\n||Confluence version||Crowd library version||Embedded Crowd library version||User processing speed||\r\n|5.8.18|2.8.3|1.8.1|Fast (/)|\r\n|5.9.12|2.8.3|2.0.1|Slow (x)|\r\n|5.10.8|2.8.8|2.0.1|Slow (x)|",

It's possible to click on the next page, but nothing changes after clicking on the next page.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# (_Optional_) Create a space to hold this test in Confluence\r\n# Create 2 pages using the *Product requirements* template\r\n# Create another page and add the *Page Properties Macro* in it, then edit the macro and set *1* on the *Number of items to display* field\r\n# Now go to one of the 2 pages created in step 2, edit the page and add 25 lines in *QA* column inside the table in the Page Properties macro. In my case I added a new line to each number from 1 to 25. Example:  !pagination.png|thumbnail!\r\n# Go back to the page with the report macro and minimize the browser until it creates a horizontal scrollbar within the report macro:  !browserScrollbar.png|thumbnail! \r\n# Refresh the page now that the horizontal scrollbar was _created_\r\n# Click to change the page\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n* The page will show the next result\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n* The number of the page shows that it changed, but the report macro still shows the same results of the first page.\r\n \r\nh3. Notes\r\n* In this example I tried to simply the most the steps to replicate this issue, so only two pages are needed to replicate it. The bug affects any quantity of items displayed per page.\r\n* The QA field was randomly picked to receive the text.\r\n* I noticed that when the Report macro has less than 25 lines in the item, the problem did not happen. This is not constant, though. I'm not entirely sure how the number of lines trigger the bug, neither how many lines is needed to trigger it.\r\n* The problem *only* happens when the horizontal scrollbar exists, independently of the number of lines the item has in the column.\r\n\r\nh3.Workaround\r\n* As the problem only happens when the horizontal scrollbar is there, we can either:\r\n*# Collapse the Sidebar so that it gives space on the page. Then refresh the page.\r\n*# Reduce the number of columns showing in the report macro (edit the Page Properties Macro and specify the columns you want to be there in the report). Then refresh the page.\r\n*# Zoom out the page display in the browser and refresh the page",

Although a number of us on the Confluence development team use the LastPass chrome extension, our attempts to investigate the root cause of this issue have been hampered by not being able to reproduce it ourselves.\r\n\r\nWe have noticed that LastPass' [release notes|https://lastpass.com/upgrade.php?fromwebsite=1&releasenotes=1] for version 4.1.40 mention fixing an issue that _\"impacted a handful of sites\"_.\r\n\r\nCould anyone who is still impacted by this issue please check the version of LastPass they have installed in Chrome? Typing {{chrome://extensions}} in your browser's address bar will show the version numbers for extensions you have installed.\r\n\r\nIf this issue has persisted for you and you are using LastPass 4.1.40 or later, please reach out to us again via [support.atlassian.com|https://support.atlassian.com/].\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n Edith\r\n{panel}\r\nh3.

      "description": "h2. Problem summary\r\nThe Restrict Page dialog can be mislead an administrator into thinking he/she has view/edit privileges when the admin is in fact restricted from doing so. This leads to confusion such as thinking that the \"Edit\" button is erroneously missing from a page.\r\n\r\nh2. Scenario\r\nImagine a scenario where an admin has permissions to modify page restrictions, and goes to view a page which contains a page restriction. The admin is not currently page of list of privileged users that are allowed to edit the page, and notices that the \"Edit\" button is (correctly) missing. The admin then clicks the Padlock on a given page, and confusingly sees that his/her username is *already listed* among the other privileged users.\r\n\r\nThe admin thus believes a bug has been encountered (since the \"Edit\" button is missing) when really it's an issue with the Restrict Page dialog design. Consider the following two examples:\r\n\r\nh2. Example 1 - When there are no page restrictions initially\r\n* Create a page without any restrictions\r\n* Log in as a user who can modify restrictions, and click the Padlock icon\r\n* Change the dropdown to \"Viewing and Editing restricted\". Observe that your username is automatically shown in the dialog below\r\n\r\nIn this example, it is easy for the user to understand that while the username is shown with \"Can view and edit\", the changes are not committed until the Apply button is pressed. In other words, the dialog is showing you *what the restrictions config will update to if the Apply button is pressed*, rather than what is currently set for the page (which is nothing).\r\n\r\n|Unrestricted page|What admin sees when clicking padlock and selecting\r\n\"Viewing and Editing restricted\" in the dropdown|\r\n|!unrestrictedpage.png|thumbnail!|!norestrictions.png|thumbnail!|\r\n\r\nh2. Example 2 - When there are already restrictions on the page\r\n* Create a page and restrict editing to yourself (but allow everyone to view)\r\n* Log in as a different user who can modify restrictions, navigate to the page and hit the Padlock button\r\n\r\nIn this example, there are already existing restrictions on the page. The Restrictions dialog shows everyone that is part of the existing restrictions, however (just like in Example 1) it _also_ shows the current who is not currently part of it. The dialog is once again showing what the restrictions config for the page will look like *if the Apply button is pressed.*\r\n\r\n|Page with existing restrictions|What admin sees when clicking padlock|\r\n|!restrictedpage.png|thumbnail!|!existingrestrictions.png|thumbnail!|\r\n\r\nThis is a display problem is because the user, at this moment, is not actually part of the restrictions configs, and cannot edit the page. If the user presses Apply, that *will* in fact update the restrictions configs such that the user can edit the page afterwards. *The confusing part here is that there's nothing in the UI which clearly indicates what are the current settings, and what are the new changes that will occur if the button is pressed.*\r\n\r\nIn the case of Example 2, we can avoid this confusion by simply not auto-listing the current user viewing the Restrictions dialog, except when the user is factually part of the page restriction configs.",

It is slow to launch and process, and takes up too much space. When just searching for text, I'd much rather just use the built-in browser find.\r\n\r\nI typically hit Cmd-F, and start typing, but because it takes so long to come up, you actually type the text you want to search for into the page you're editing. So you have to train yourself to hit Cmd-F, but wait. With the built-in browser find, that is not necessary.\r\n\r\nSearch and replace is a rare function and I'm fine to launch it another way, or even without a keyboard shortcut. This should not own Cmd-F. Please make this be a user preference at least, thanks.",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFCLOUD-45632].\r\n  {panel}\r\n\r\nThe Confluence editor has always behaved in the worst possible way when a session expires \u2013 namely, it provides no hint that anything is wrong, until it's time to save, when you're redirected to the login page and lose all your work.\r\n\r\nSome developers might consider losing customer data under normal circumstances a hideous bug, but no, it was resolved as \"won't fix due to limited demand\" on -CONF-29379-.\r\n\r\nWhat's new is that Synchrony behaves\u00a0even _worse_\u00a0than the old editor. When a\u00a0session expires mid-edit, as one types, Synchrony still displays a 'Saving changes' message:\r\n\r\n!synchrony_saving.png!\r\n\r\nthen replaced by a 'Changes saved' message when one stops typing:\r\n\r\n!synchrony_saved.png!\r\n\r\nBut this is a filthy lie, as can be seen if one watches the developer console. The changes aren't being saved:\r\n\r\n!confedit_errors.png!\r\n\r\nWhen one finally clicks 'Update', one just gets a spinner and nothing is saved.\r\nh2. Steps to Replicate\r\n # Load up Chrome and edit any page (assuming Synchrony enabled)\r\n # Hit F12 to open the developer panel, go to the 'Applications' tab and view the page's cookies:\r\n !conf_cookies.png!\r\n # Delete the\u00a0JSESSIONID and 'seraph.confluence' cookies to simulate a session timeout with no 'remember me'.\r\n # Continue editing.\u00a0The editor will keep reporting 'Changes saved' despite obviously being unable to.\r\n \u00a0\r\n\r\nSome Q&A:\r\nh2. This must be wrong. Doesn't the editor display a warning when it can't save a draft?\r\n\r\nConfluence's editor displays a nice 'Error saving draft. No draft has been saved' message if it _loses connection_ with the server. If it merely gets 403 errors, it continues happily pretending to save.\r\nh2. If this bug is so terrible, why have I never encountered it?\r\n\r\nBecause normally developers tick 'Remember me' when logging in. Also, the chances of having an editor open at the point of session expiration (5h) is moderately low.\r\nh2. Why don't users tick 'Remember me'?\r\n\r\nBecause it's unticked by default, and somewhat cryptic to the uninitiated.\r\n\r\nAlso, some SSO systems like Okta work by storing users' credentials for them, providing an alternative login screen (e.g. [Okta SWA|https://support.okta.com/help/articles/Knowledge_Article/28328856-Overview-of-Managing-Apps-and-SSO]), and logging in on behalf of users. Okta users in particular never get to set the 'Remember me' checkbox.\r\nh2. Why isn't 'Remember me' ticked by default?\r\n\r\nYou tell me.",

Summary\r\n\r\nWhen consulting restrictions of a child page through the REST API, it returns in an empty response even though it inherits restrictions from the parent page.\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Create a parent and a child page\r\n # Apply group restrictions to the parent page\r\n # Restrictions are inherited by the child page as expected (see attached screenshot)\r\n # Perform a REST call to check the restrictions of the child:\u00a0\r\n\r\n{code:java}\r\nhttp://{host}:{port}/{context-path}/rest/api/content/{id}/restriction/byOperation/read{code}\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nThe inherited restrictions are listed, just as they are when you read the parent page restrictions. Output example from the *parent* page:\r\n{code:java}\r\n{\r\n\"operation\": \"read\",\r\n\"restrictions\": {\r\n\"user\": {\r\n\"results\": [\r\n{\r\n\"type\": \"known\",\r\n\"profilePicture\": {\r\n\"path\": \"/{context-path}/images/icons/profilepics/default.png\",\r\n\"width\": 48,\r\n\"height\": 48,\r\n\"isDefault\": true\r\n},\r\n\"username\": \"admin\",\r\n\"displayName\": \"Admin User [Local]\",\r\n\"userKey\": \"ff8080815917ff18015917ff679d0002\"\r\n}\r\n],\r\n\"start\": 0,\r\n\"limit\": 100,\r\n\"size\": 1\r\n},\r\n\"group\": {\r\n\"results\": [\r\n{\r\n\"type\": \"group\",\r\n\"name\": \"confluence-users\"\r\n}\r\n],\r\n\"start\": 0,\r\n\"limit\": 100,\r\n\"size\": 1\r\n}\r\n},\r\n\"_links\": {\r\n\"base\": \"http://{host}:{port}/{context-path}\",\r\n\"context\": \"{context-path}\",\r\n\"self\": \"http://{host}:{port}/{context-path}/rest/api/content/65575/restriction/byOperation/read\" \r\n}, \r\n\"_expandable\": { \r\n\"content\": \"/rest/api/content/65575\" \r\n} \r\n}{code}\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nNo restrictions are listed for the child page. Here is the output for the *child*:\r\n{code:java}\r\n{\r\n\"operation\": \"read\",\r\n\"restrictions\": {\r\n\"user\": {\r\n\"results\": [],\r\n\"start\": 0,\r\n\"limit\": 100,\r\n\"size\": 0\r\n},\r\n\"group\": {\r\n\"results\": [],\r\n\"start\": 0,\r\n\"limit\": 100,\r\n\"size\": 0\r\n}\r\n},\r\n\"_links\": {\r\n\"base\": \"http://{host}:{port}/{context-path}\",\r\n\"context\": \"{context-path}\",\r\n\"self\": \"http://{host}:{port}/{context-path}/rest/api/content/65577/restriction/byOperation/read\"\r\n},\r\n\"_expandable\": {\r\n\"content\": \"/rest/api/content/65577\"\r\n}\r\n}\r\n{code}\r\nh3. Workaround\r\nh4. Option 1\r\n\r\nConsult the parent page to check for restrictions.\r\nh4. Option 2\r\n\r\nRun the same request that the web UI does, with a little help of [{{jq}}|https://stedolan.github.io/jq/] and [{{sed}}|https://linux.die.net/man/1/sed] commands, then we get the users that have {{read}} access to a target page:\r\n{code}\r\nADMIN_USRNAME=admin\r\nADMIN_PWD=admin\r\nCONFBASEURL=http://localhost:8090/confluence\r\nTGT_PAGEID=6553611\r\nTGT_PAGE_SPCKEY=~admin\r\nPARENT_PAGEID=6553609\r\n\r\n$ curl -u $ADMIN_USRNAME:$ADMIN_PWD $CONFBASEURL'/pages/getcontentpermissions.action?contentId='$TGT_PAGEID'&parentPageId='$PARENT_PAGEID'&spaceKey='$TGT_PAGE_SPCKEY 2>/dev/null | jq -r '.users[] | select(.report==null) | (.entity.name)' | sed -e ':a' -e 'N' -e '$!ba' -e 's/\\n/,/g'\r\nuser001,admin\r\n{code}",

Problem Definition\r\nCurrently there is no option for canceling or killing already started PDF export. \r\n Ability to cancel PDF export is required when\r\n * PDF export of a large space is started accidentally\r\n * Large PDF export is started on a server instance and resulted in performance impact or resource constraints\r\n * _Back_ button is clicked after PDF export started and export is initiated again by the user\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\nAn ability to cancel any ongoing PDF export process via WebUI.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n*Confluence Data Center* version has [External Process Pool|https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/external-process-pool-for-confluence-data-center-958779098.html] that minimises performance impact and potential system outages for large space export by letting external process crash without an impact on Confluence process. However, It doesn't offer an ability to cancel ongoing PDF export.\r\n*Confluence Server* server version offers no option of killing space export to pdf task other than restarting the whole Confluence process.\r\n\r\nh3. Notes\r\nOn top of ability to cancel already started export, a confirmation dialogue and a warning about potential large space PDF export impact would also be beneficial and is tracked separately here: CONFSERVER-59553",

Summary\r\n\r\nWhen using Confluence 6.0 with Collaborative editing enabled on a Server\u00a0with non-Western locale we see\r\n{panel}\r\nLoading the editor's taking longer than usual. Give it a few moments, then refresh your page if it still doesn't load. Speak to your Confluence admin if that doesn't fix it.\r\n{panel}\r\nh3. Environment\r\n * Language *{{zh_CN.UTF-8}}*\u00a0on the server (also seen in Japanese and Korean)\r\n * No Forward or Reverse Proxy - {{server.xml}} is correct with no proxy information (reverse proxy tends to throw 404 errors but is the same cause and resolution)\r\n * Firewall and anti-virus is turned off/not installed\r\n * Running on VM\r\n * no add-ons (i.e. fresh install)\r\n * Tested access on different networks\r\n * Accessing Confluence though the default port 8090 (Base URL as [http://confluence.mycompany.com:8090/]\r\n * using the Synchrony proxy though {{/synchrony_proxy}}\r\n\r\nh3. Root Cause\r\nSynchrony-proxy uses Jetty Proxy to handle HTTP requests/responses, and it only recognizes a certain range of characters as legal. Synchrony's date formatter uses the user's default locale, so some non-western (in support cases, mostly Chinese, one Korean case), characters are treated as 'illegal', which results in an HTTP protocol violation, i.e. 502 Bad Gateway error in the browser, 400 internally.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\nh5. Linux\r\n# Change the Confluence environment to\u00a0*{{zh_CN.UTF-8}}*. On Linux, you can do this with\r\n{code}\r\nsudo locale-gen zh_CN.UTF-8\r\nLANG=\"zh_CN.UTF-8\"\r\n{code}\r\n# When you run {{date}} you will see\r\n{code}\r\n017\u5e74 01\u6708 10\u65e5 \u661f\u671f\u4e8c 16:48:32 AEDT\r\n{code}\r\n# run {{start-confluence.sh}} in this environment\r\n# run\r\n{code}\r\ncurl -i -N -I http://localhost:8091/synchrony/resources/js/vendor/sockjs.min.js\r\n{code}\r\nand check the headers, the date format will be in Chinese, or garbled Chinese\r\n{code}\r\nDate: \u001f\u001f\ufffd, 10 2017 05:56:51 GMT\r\n{code}\r\n# Create a new page in Confluence, error will appear in browser and developer tools / network tab\r\n\r\nh5. Windows 10\r\n# Go to \"Start Menu\" > \"Settings\" > \"Time & language\"\r\n!Settings.png|thumbnail! !Time&language.png|thumbnail!\r\n# Select \"Region & language\"\r\n!Region&language.png|thumbnail!\r\n# Select Chinese (If Chinese is not an option, select 'Add a language' to add it to the list) > \"Set as default\" (if this option is greyed out, select \"Options\" instead -- you may have to download the language pack) and restart the machine\r\n!SetAsDefault.png|thumbnail!\r\n# Start Confluence as normal, and the result should be the red loading banner for collaborative editing and the 502 Gateway errors in the Developer Tools console (if you had Confluence working before, you may have to clear the cache, otherwise the browser will used the cached js files)\r\n\r\nh5.
