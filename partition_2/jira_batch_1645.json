Trying to run the new purchased copy with the license key and rather than taking me through the start up wizard it keeps prompting me for username and password when I cannect to it through my browser on localhost:8090...it looks like it thinks I'm still using an eval copy and not the newly purchased with license key. Could you provide some guidance on this please? The service starts but I can't log into it",

      "description": "h3. Summary\r\n\r\nEverywhere in Confluence DB tables, the creator is now set as the user hash. This username hash is stored in the table user_mapping which is made of three columns (user_key, username, lower_username). The last column has a unique index.\r\n\r\nNow in cwd_user, there is no index on column lower_user_name. The only index there is on lower_user_name is composed with the other column directory_id.\r\n\r\nSo this means that for every action where Confluence looks up for creator information, it makes a full table scan on cwd_user. (Unless the caching in Confluence helps to avoid this ? )\r\n\r\nh3. Environment\r\n\r\n* Confluence 5.9.4\r\n* PostgreSQL 9.3.10\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nThere are many actions in Confluence which could cause this to occur. One such query which has been found is the below one:\r\n\r\n{code:sql}\r\nselect internalgr2_.id as id,\r\ninternalgr2_.group_name as group_name,\r\ninternalgr2_.lower_group_name as lower_gr3_,\r\ninternalgr2_.active as active,\r\ninternalgr2_.local as local,\r\ninternalgr2_.created_date as created_6_,\r\ninternalgr2_.updated_date as updated_7_,\r\ninternalgr2_.description as descript8_,\r\ninternalgr2_.group_type as group_type,\r\ninternalgr2_.directory_id as directo10_\r\nfrom cwd_membership hibernatem0_,\r\ncwd_user internalus1_,\r\ncwd_group internalgr2_\r\nwhere hibernatem0_.parent_id=internalgr2_.id\r\nand ((internalus1_.lower_user_name=:v2 and hibernatem0_.child_user_id=internalus1_.id)\r\nand(internalgr2_.directory_id=:v1 and hibernatem0_.parent_id=internalgr2_.id))\r\norder by internalgr2_.lower_group_name;\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nAn explain plan on that shows a table scan is run on the lower_user_name field in cwd_user, if there is enough data in the tables being queried (in a fresh install there is no table scan, probably due to optimization from analyze statistics).\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nDatabase query returns quickly without performance impact, by using an index lookup.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nDatabase query returns slowly, and causes a performance hit, as it's using a record lookup (table scan).\r\n\r\nh3.Workaround\r\n\r\nManually add an index on lower_user_name in the cwd_user table, for example:\r\n\r\n{code:sql}\r\ncreate index idx_user_lower_user_name on cwd_user (lower_user_name);\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nNOTE: If any future fix adds a new index, you may need to manually remove this index before that.",

Environment\r\n * Confluence 6.0.0-OD-2016.08.1-0001\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Create a Custom Template within Confluence\r\n # Add a \"Create from Template\" button to a Page with the following settings:\r\n -- Select the Custom Template from Step 1\r\n -- Prepend {{@currentDate}} to the \"Title of page to be created\" field\r\n -- Space key of the current Space\r\n # Click the \"Create from Template\" button to create a page, add content, and save changes\r\n !Step3.png|thumbnail!\r\n # Go back to the Page in Step 2 and click \"Create From Template\" button again, change the date, change content, etc, and save\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nA new page is created and other existing pages are unaffected\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nWhen the 2nd Page is created from Template, the editor opens in what appears to be a new page based on the Template however the page is opened in Edit Mode. \r\n !Step4.png|thumbnail!\r\n When changes are saved, it overwrites the previously created page rather than creating a new page. \r\n !AfterCreating2ndPage.png|thumbnail! \r\n Reviewing the Page History, the \"creation\" of the new page can be seen as Edits on the initial page. \r\n !PageHistory.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nh3. Notes\r\nThis only appears to affect the creation of new pages using a Custom Template; stock blueprints/templates are unaffected\r\n\r\nh3.

Other Notes (BB)\r\nIf you continue to try to create from template after the initial overwrite, the behavior changes to what we would expect to see. \u00a0The pages do not overwrite, but new pages are created. \u00a0This seems to only be affecting the initial save.",

I believe this is a bug behavior, as it only takes place when attempting to provide a web link.\r\n\r\nClearing cookies for our internal wiki url in my browser seems to fix it... but I've been clearing cookies for every few months since February 2015 (when our internal Helpdesk jira \"HD-16170\" was filed) \r\n\r\nTwo distinct behaviors are seen; \r\n\r\nIt is not possible to just create the external web link, the save button does not work if I create link, paste in URL for the web link (for example http://www.cloudera.com/documentation/enterprise/latest/topics/cm_sg_guide_ssl_certs.html ) I have to click between the link types, and then come back to the web link (re-pasting the URL) to get the save button to activate.\r\n\r\nOnce this starts happening, I can no longer create links without cycling through up to 5 save/try to fix/save attempts, before I get a working link.  Clearing cookies at this point makes things go away for a bit, but invariably it always returns.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

To prevent it causing out of memory errors in your site, we don't show page excerpts when there are more than 200 pages in the space, and don't list any pages if there are more than 5000 in the space.  This 5000 page limit can be reduced further by setting the system property page.index.macro.max.pages to a lower value.  For example to lower the limit to 500 set the system property to:\r\n\r\n-Dpage.index.macro.max.pages=500\r\n\r\nMore info on how to set system properties for Confluence can be found [here|https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/configuring-system-properties-168002854.html].\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\nh3.

I did figure out that I could search in the context menu for \"{\" which is great, but still not perfect since I could find no way except using the mouse (click on the macro box and then click edit) to click an option check box for the macro (which pretty much negates the ease of inserting a macro that way).\r\n\r\nIt is nice that you can highlight text and it will wrap the macro around that but only if you go the long, click-heavy, route of using the Insert-more-content menu, and (with some difficulty) you can copy/paste macro insertions with the attributes set, but it obviously then also comes with the existing text data as well.  It seems like there could be some syntax that would let me invoke a macro myself.  Something like &#123;macro:No Markup, nopanel=\"true\"&#125;text&#123;macro&#125; or something, which I could paste from the clipboard (I would paste only the initial &#123;macro...&#125; and then move to the end of the text I wanted to wrap and put in the ending code).  \r\n\r\nI'm guessing this from other comments that hint that maybe you used to be able to do that, and, in fact, [your own wiki-markup tutorial|https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/confluence-wiki-markup-251003035.html#ConfluenceWikiMarkup-TextEffects] mentions &#123;color:red&#125;text&#123;color&#125; which works in Jira, but apparently no longer works in the wiki (if it ever did).  All-in-all I really wish you would provide a \"wiki markup\" view of the page, so that I could edit all the codes myself (like Wikimedia does) even if you translate them in and out of the codes under the hood to some internal format.",

Search is always done from the current page as root, instead of searching based on the configured root page\r\nh3. Environment\r\n * Confluence 5.10.1\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nThese are the steps I performed to reproduce the problem:\r\n # create this page structure:\r\n ** other page: othercontent (page id 557069)\r\n ** parent page: parentcontent (page id 557065)\r\n ** child page: childcontent (page id 557067)\r\n # on parent page, create pagetreesearch macro wiki markup in all possible fields:\r\n Parent page root search:\r\n \\{pagetreesearch:root=parent page} \r\n !pagetreesearch_doctheme_wikimarkup.png|thumbnail!\r\n # navigate to other page and search for childcontent (should find)\r\n ** *actual result*: search does not find anything (uses ancestorIds:557069 AND childcontent) \u2013 wrong\r\n # navigate to child page and search for parentcontent (should find)\r\n ** *actual result*: search does not find anything (uses ancestorIds:557067 AND parentcontent) \u2013 wrong\r\n\r\n * Note: this error happens regardless of the position of the pagetreesearch macro (header, footer, sidebar).\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nIn all cases the search should have been \"ancestorIds:557065 AND <content>\", because the parent page id is 557065 and it is specified as the root in the pagetreesearch macro.\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Notes\r\n\r\nThe pagetreesearch macro seems to work normally if embedded into the body of a page:\r\n # Navigate to \"other page\"\r\n # create pagetreesearch macro and point the search to start at root \"child page\"\r\n # try to search for contents belonging to \"child page\"\r\n ## Results as expected: (ancestorIds:557067 AND childcontent) \u2013 correct\r\n\r\nAs a test, I changed to default theme and configured wiki markup in sidebar, header, and footer. Got this error:\r\n\r\n{{The selected context is not a valid hierarchical page}}\r\n\r\nThe error disappears after browsing around, but the problem remains the same \u2013 not possible to use the root page filter in this macro. Therefore, the problems happen both in the documentation and default theme.\r\n\r\nNote: This bug was updated to reflect that the pagetreesearch macro works in 5.10.1, but the root page function does not.\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nThere is no known direct workaround for this other than embedding the pagetreesearch macro in the actual pages (which defeats the purpose of having it available in the sidebar). The [LiveSearch|https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/livesearch-macro-163415902.html] macro may be an alternative, but it does not allow filtering based on root page (only on space key and labels)\r\n !livesearch_alternative.png|thumbnail!",

I found https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/36183540/how-to-downgrade-sourcetree-to-2.0-or-2.1 and followed steps someone put to uninstall both versions, reboot, then reinstall 1.7 using the link provided.  Every time I try to open Sourcetree it crashes.  \r\n\r\nCould someone please take a look at this urgently? Without sourcetree I'm unable to do my job.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\nSan ",

Summary\r\n\r\nWhen trying to add a label to a newly created template, the user will receive an error if they are only in the system administrators group (and not confluence administrator)\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Create a global permission group that has all rights except Confluence-administrator ('test' in the attached screenshot 1).\r\n# Place a user in that group\r\n# Log into Confluence with that user\r\n# Access the administration console - *Global Templates and Blueprints*\r\n# Create a new template and save it\r\n# Edit the new template and try to add a label\r\n# First, the error in screenshot 2 will appear - *Unable to fetch current labels from the server*\r\n# If you continue to add the label (which will appear in the search bar), you will get the error in screenshot 3 - *error*\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nThe template would add a label\r\n\r\nh3.
