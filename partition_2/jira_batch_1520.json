Thus, the changeset selection page says, \"Files in P4-production:/ \" the changesets that are first presented are global, and not usually useful.\r\n\r\nThe list can be manipulated by time with the \"Remove all revisions | \u00ab Earlier Changesets | later \u00bb \" options, or filtered with \"Author\", \"Branch\", or \"Tag\" text boxes, but nothing allows me to navigate directly to a give changeset number (\"change list\" in Perforce).\r\n\r\nIf I navigate directly to a Changeset through Fisheye to a URL like \"http://balius:18060/changelog/P4-production/?cs=66106\", then there is no check-box to add the changeset to the review.\r\n\r\nBTW, what is a \"tag\" in a Perforce-based Fisheye installation? Is it equivalent to a  P4 Label?",

When they create reviews via Jira this automatically attaches JiraProjectKey-issuenumber to the title of the review. \r\n\r\nHowever if JiraProjectKey is the same as the Crucible project key (before it was changed to due to the conflict), rather than showing a link to jira, it shows a link to Crucible (to a non existant project within crucible). \r\n\r\nHowever if you have defined a [Linkers|http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/FISHEYE/Linkers] in the fisheye, this will override the bad url.
