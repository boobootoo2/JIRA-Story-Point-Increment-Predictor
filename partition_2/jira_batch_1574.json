      "description": "The Lucene searcher pruner thread is responsible for cleaning up index snapshots that are used to ensure a consistent pagination when searching. This thread is created per Lucene connection (i.e. for each index). It is observed that sometime the thread crashes during a Confluence initialization so obsolete index snapshots aren't clean up and retain in memory after using, which causes a memory leak.\u00a0\u00a0This memory leak can lead to exhaustion of the heap space and eventual crash of Confluence.\r\n\r\nThe way to verify if this thread is alive is to take a thread dump and check if there is one pruner thread for each Lucene index. Usually you will see 2 threads one for main index and another for edge index. But a plugin like CQ maintains its own index in that case the number of pruner thread should be increased accordingly.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0E.g.\r\n{noformat}\r\n[confluence@ip-vv-xx-yy-zz~]$ jstack $(pgrep java) | grep prune\r\n\"lucene-tracked-searchers-pruner-pool-26-thread-1\" #370 daemon prio=5 os_prio=0 tid=0x00007f3b644a0800 nid=0x867 waiting on condition [0x00007f3658966000]\r\n\"lucene-tracked-searchers-pruner-pool-21-thread-1\" #195 daemon prio=5 os_prio=0 tid=0x00007f3ab4bc8000 nid=0x75a waiting on condition [0x00007f3a5776e000]\r\n\"lucene-tracked-searchers-pruner-pool-19-thread-1\" #193 daemon prio=5 os_prio=0 tid=0x00007f3a70210000 nid=0x757 waiting on condition [0x00007f3a5804c000]\r\n\r\n{noformat}\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nIt is possible that this problem also occurs in earlier version of Confluence despite less frequently.",

Notice that you need to be logged in as an internal system administrator account to follow the second option\r\n\r\nIf the Job ID on the error message is *TaskQueueFlushJob*:\r\n # Restart Confluence and attempt to import the space\r\n # If that does not help, disable the scheduled job Task Queue Flush Job at *General Configuration > Scheduled Jobs* while you import the space\r\n\r\nMore details on the following KB:\r\n * [https://confluence.atlassian.com/confkb/confluence-space-xml-import-procedure-fails-with-timeout-884357177.html]",

      "description": "As a Confluence user, I want to be able to Copy and / or Move pages and have the option to overwrite already existing pages in the destination and keep previous versions of the document\r\nh3. Problem Definition\r\n\r\nCurrently, when content needs to be updated (or changed in general) with confidentiality, the page must be copied to another restricted space and then, copied back (after deletion of old version). However, this takes quite some time from the content editor and also *Loses all previous versions* of the document.\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nCreate a page operation that consists of overwriting existing page but keeping previous versions under Page history\r\nh3. Why this is important\r\n\r\nWith this feature, content update will be much faster and friction-less for the user.\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\n1 - Copy page that needs to be changed to restricted space\r\n 2 - Apply changes to the copy\r\n 3 - Delete original Page\r\n 4 - Copy Updated Page to original space\r\n 5 - Rename page to the same old name\r\n\r\n(!) Page history will be lost after this procedure",

I only seem to be able to set a static list where system is listed and the employees connected to it.

      "description": "h3. Problem Definition\r\nCurrently when a Confluence Administrator view a page's *Restrictions* they see themselves listed with *Can view and edit* permissions as they have this capability from that group's [super user|https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/global-permissions-overview-138709.html#GlobalPermissionsOverview-supergroup] ability.\r\n\r\nThis is confusing as the Administrator then expects to be able to perform changes like exporting that page tree to PDF, Word, HTML, or a custom XML export, but they are unable to as they still need to explicitly grant themselves permission. It is unclear that the admin can still add themselves though they are listed.\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\nAdjust the *Restrictions* page to show when the permissions someone has are just from the Confluence Administrators super user group so that admins know they will need to add themselves explicitly for full permissions. (To perform actions like the exports mentioned above.)\r\n\r\nh3. Note\r\nWith the super user permissions the admin can still perform single page exports and the full space or site XML backups without issue\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround \r\nAdministrators can actually still add themselves explicitly to the page restrictions though they are listed via their implicit permissions from their admin superuser group:\r\n# Access the page *Restrictions* as a Confluence Administrator:\r\n!temporary_admin.png|thumbnail! \r\n# Though your permissions are listed, you can actually explicitly add yourself:\r\n!add_admin.png|thumbnail! \r\n!add_admin_2.png|thumbnail!\r\n# After pressing *Add* for the permission it may seem like nothing was added, but after applying this you should be able to export \r\n !save_admin.png|thumbnail!

This file value is persisted into the Administrator's user interface when the update is made and is persisted to the file. However, the actual value does not show in the Administrator's UI once the nodes are restarted at the application level.\r\nh4. Steps to reproduce the issue\r\n\r\nThe following steps will easily reproduce the issue for you:\r\n * Login to *any node*\u00a0of Confluence Data Center\r\n * Go to *General Configuration > Cache Management*\r\n * Click on the *Advanced View*\r\n * Choose the cache entry for *Content Attachments*\r\n * Adjust the size to *2* and observe the *0/2* value\r\n * Save the change\r\n * Observe that the change has persisted to both nodes in the Cache Managment Advanced View\r\n * Observe the file _cache-settings-overrides.properties_ has the field adjusted to *2*\r\n * \r\n{code:java}\r\n/var/atlassian/shared-home6/config$ vi cache-settings-overrides.properties\r\n#Saved by com.atlassian.confluence.cache.DefaultCacheSettingsManager\r\n#Thu Jan 11 13:43:46 CST 2018\r\ncache.maxEntriesLocalHeap.com.atlassian.confluence.core.ContentEntityObject.attachments_v5=2{code}\r\n\r\n * Shutdown both nodes in the Cluster\r\n * *Verify* that the file _cache-settings-overrides.properties_ has not changed\r\n * Wait for the nodes to go offline\r\n * Restart the nodes, one first, then a few seconds later the second node\r\n * Navigate to to *General Configuration > Cache Management*\r\n * Click on the *Advanced View*\r\n * Observe that the UI now shows the *0/25000* value again\r\n * Move to a test space\r\n * Create a Test Upload page\r\n * Add an Upload attachment macro\r\n * Attempt to upload 3 or more attachments\r\n * You should receive two (2) successful uploads, with an additional failure\r\n * You exceeded the cache set by the override, and now the issue is occurring because the override file is in control as we have stipulated.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the UI is showing a hard-coded default value, and the changes that you make to the cache *persist* as we expected them to, although there is a display issue that needs to be addressed with our developers to correct the value to pull from the overrides when present in the shared home.\r\n\r\nScreen Captures\r\n\r\n\u00a0Original Cache:\r\n\r\n\u00a0 !original.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nUpdated Cache:\r\n\r\n!updated.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nAfter Restart\r\n\r\n!after-restart.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nCache Exceeded ERROR:\r\n\r\n!attachment-upload-fail.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\nh2. *Workaround*\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nAn easy workaround for this would be to access the\u00a0_cache-settings-overrides.properties_ file\u00a0mentioned above (usually in the shared-home folder of the installation) and remove the \"_v5\" suffix from the each cache name that has it.\r\n For example, change this:\r\n{code:java}\r\ncache.maxEntriesLocalHeap.com.atlassian.confluence.core.ContentEntityObject.attachments_v5=2\r\n{code}\r\nTo this:\r\n{code:java}\r\ncache.maxEntriesLocalHeap.com.atlassian.confluence.core.ContentEntityObject.attachments=2\r\n{code}\r\nSettings will take effect the next time that the caches are restarted.\r\n(Note that 2 as a cache size is not valid, a minimum of 50 is enforced.
