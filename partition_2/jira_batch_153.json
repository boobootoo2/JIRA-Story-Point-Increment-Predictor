Issue Summary\r\n\r\nWhen migrating with Confluence Cloud Migration Assistant, app users are not added to the Space so apps are unable to make REST calls via Connect to access content.

This is similar to MIG-303, however that relates to Custom Content and Restricted Pages.\r\n\r\nEach app in Confluence Cloud has a dedicated user. After installing an app in Cloud, you can see the app user by going to a Space -> Space Settings -> Space Permissions, and under *Individual Users* you will see a user for each installed app. This user is also added to the default group, but this is not visible in the UI.\r\n\r\nOn migrated Spaces, the app user does not appear under {*}Individual Users{*}. Also, the Space does not have a default group applied.\r\n\r\nThis is the *Individual Users* of a Space migrated with CCMA\r\n\r\n!image-2021-12-14-16-52-07-330.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nThis is the *Individual Users* of a Space created in Cloud, you can see the app user *com-atlassian-devhelp-jrichards* has been added automatically.\r\n\r\n!image-2021-12-14-16-54-08-711.png|thumbnail!\r\nh3.

It would be helpful if JCMA could do this check as well.\r\n\r\n*Current functionality*\r\n\r\nJCMA only marks users of the following configuration as duplicates:\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n||Username||Email address||\r\n|username1\u00a0|email@domain.com|\r\n|username1\u00a0|email@domain.com|\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n*Desired functionality*\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nFor site import migrations, it would be helpful if JCMA could also mark the configuration below as duplicate so that customers can check ahead of time what type of user consolidation they need to do before actually importing the data:\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n||Username||Email address||\r\n|username1\u00a0|email@domain.com|\r\n|username1\u00a0|email2@domain.com|\r\n\r\n*Additional details*\r\n\r\nHaving this additional functionality would be helpful as clients can consolidate users at the database / AD level instead of relying on various methods to bulk data into XML files.\r\nIt would be helpful to provide a mechanism in the JCMA UI to enable / disable this mechanism when importing a site after migrating users and groups.",

Issue Summary\r\n\r\nWhile migrating\u00a0Jira Service Management\u00a0project, some SLAs (time metric) fail to export because of dependence on invalid issue statuses.\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Go to Jira Administration -> Issues -> Statuses. Create a new Issue Status, say \"Dismissed\".\r\n # Select any workflow that is used in the project. Edit it such that it now includes the newly created status \"Dismissed\"\r\n # Go to Project Settings -> SLAs. Create a new SLA such that one of the Start/Stop/Pause conditions have the \"Dismissed\" status selected. Save the SLA.\u00a0\r\n # Edit the workflow (the one modified in step 2) such that it does not contain the \"Dismissed\" status anymore.\u00a0\r\n # Go to Jira Administration -> Issues -> Statuses. Delete the status \"Dismissed\"\r\n # Migrate the project.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nThe project should be migrated successfully. The migrated SLA does not refer to the deleted status.\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nThe below exception is thrown in the export error logs file:\r\n{noformat}\r\n2021-10-27 12:43:58.592 ERROR PROJ project-export We couldn't export Time Metric 12. Reason: java.lang.IllegalStateException: Entity mri:mig:jira/classic:issueStatus:10017 is expected to be exported, but it was not. {noformat}\r\nh3. Verify the issue\r\n\r\nThe following SQL query (written for PostgreSQL) should ideally return an empty response. If the query returns one or more IDs, each ID represents a reference to an invalid status.\u00a0\r\n{noformat}\r\nSELECT \"CONDITION_ID\"\r\nFROM \"AO_54307E_METRICCONDITION\"\r\nWHERE \"FACTORY_KEY\" = 'status-sla-condition-factory'\r\nAND \"CONDITION_ID\" NOT IN (SELECT ID FROM issuestatus);\r\n{noformat}\r\n(The query returns the IDs of those statuses that are referred to in SLAs but are not found in the status table (do not exist - likely because they were deleted)).\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nNOTE: It is recommended to create a backup your server before executing the workarounds.\u00a0\r\nh4. Workaround 1 (Using UI - recommended)\r\n # Open project settings for the particular project.\r\n # Go to SLAs.\u00a0\r\n # Select each SLA one-by-one. If the SLA contains invalid status reference, an error message should be displayed similar to attached image {{1.png}}\r\n # Edit the SLA. Remove the problematic statuses from the conditions and save the SLA. ({{{}2.png{}}})\r\n # Once all SLAs are fixed, click the {{update}} link below the SLA menu (shown in image {{3.png).}}\r\n # Attempt to migrate the project again.\r\n\r\nh4. Workaround 2 (Using DB)\u00a0\r\n # Remove the references to invalid statuses using the following query. Note: This query will also remove similar invalid status references in SLAs across all project.\u00a0\r\n\r\n{noformat}\r\nDELETE FROM \"AO_54307E_METRICCONDITION\"\r\nWHERE \"FACTORY_KEY\" = 'status-sla-condition-factory'\r\nAND \"CONDITION_ID\" NOT IN (SELECT ID FROM issuestatus){noformat}\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a02.

Expected Results\r\nMigration goes through with all data moved over to Cloud.\r\n\r\nh3.

Reason: You cannot create a new field of type 'Parent Link' as it is locked..

Potential Workaround\r\nOnly workaround is to try using the EAP to migrate *all* instance data in a single batch (Advanced Roadmaps + Jira), however, that can fail with the following error:\r\n{code}\r\n2021-11-01 12:25:37.132 ERROR BLAH project-import We couldn't import Workflow Scheme 'BLAH BLAH Workflow'. Reason: IllegalStateException: Duplicate key BLAH BLAH Workflow. This caused 34591 other items to fail.\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nInteresting to note that one could create a new plan and re-migrate each of the failed projects. This would move them correctly to Cloud, but would cause duplicated workflows with the _*(migrated)*_ tag on it.

Have a migration saved in the source system, then click a button and the JCMA would take the projects/issues diffs, find the corresponding in the target system, and just apply the changes.
