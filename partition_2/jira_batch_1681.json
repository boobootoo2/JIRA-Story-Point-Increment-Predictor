[See the corresponding bug report|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFCLOUD-36044].\r\n{panel}\r\n*Summary*\r\nWhen I insert a JIRA Issue/Filter macro on a Confluence page as a table, a long text is not wrapped and the width of the column is fixed by the length of the text. \r\n If the the page is then exported to Word or PDF, the table either runs off the page (Word) or columns are missing entirely (PDF).\r\n\r\n*Update*: The Change History macro is causing this issue. After removing the Change History macro from the Confluence page, the text is wrapping as expected and all the table columns I have defined are visible on the page even after exporting to Word and PDF formats.\r\n\r\nNote: Depending on the number of columns defined,JIRA Issue/Filter Macro tables are prone to overflow the page when exported.\r\n\r\n*Steps to Reproduce:*\r\n # Add the Jira Issues macro to a page. Include a field in the configuration that contains a long text description.\r\n # Save the page and note that the text does wrap correctly.\u00a0\r\n # Edit the page again. Add the Change History macro to the page and save.\r\n\r\n*Expected Results:*\r\nThe text wrapping will correctly render on the page.\u00a0\r\n\r\n*Actual Results:*\r\nThe word wrapping is removed from the issues macro and you have to scroll horizontally to read the text.\u00a0",

Any help would be much appreciated.\r\n\r\n*Issue:* I have a couple of epics and some stories associated with each of them in JIRA. When I created a wiki page in Confluence, I inserted some issues from JIRA using \"JIRA Issue/Filter\" built-in macro to display all the Epics and their respective stories in a table. \r\nWhile all the other attributes appear correctly +I am not able to get to display, the names of the Epics in the table+. I have included +Epic Name+ and +Epic Link+ both the columns, but Epic Name column in the table is empty, while Epic Link just populates the JIRA Id of the Epic in question.\r\n\r\n*Ultimately, I need to display Epic Names in the table and not their ids.* Please suggest how this could be fixed.\r\n\r\n+*Also, for your reference, please find the screen shot attached with the ticket*+\r\n\r\nh3.Update\r\n\r\nThis issue seems to also affect other fields like Version. When user generates a report; instead of showing the version number; it shows the version ID instead.\r\n\r\nFor example. \r\n\r\n{code}\r\njira=> select * from projectversion where id = 17718;\r\n  id   | project | vname | description | sequence | released | archived | url | releasedate | startdate \r\n-------+---------+-------+-------------+----------+----------+----------+-----+-------------+-----------\r\n 17718 |   11200 | 1.9   |             |       10 |          |          |     |             | \r\n(1 row)\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nWhen a report is generated; instead of showing version 1.9 for an issue in a report; it shows 17718 instead.

Diagnosis - is this affecting you?\r\n\r\nFirst, try a content reindex. If this doesn't help, run this query (on any version). If it returns any results, this bug is the cause of your duplicates.\r\n{code:sql|title=Diagnosis 1 - NULL users}\r\nSELECT  * FROM user_mapping where lower_username is null;\r\n{code}\r\nIf this query returns nothing, have a look at CONF-30050 as well.\r\n\r\nNow you need to determine if you have single records or duplicated records, and which scenario types that you are affected with. The workaround you perform will depend on this.\r\n{code:sql|title=Diagnosis 2 - Determine Single/Duplicated records}\r\nselect u.* from user_mapping u where lower(u.username) in (select lower(nullrecord.username) from user_mapping nullrecord where lower_username is null) order by u.username;\r\n{code}\r\nProceed to the appropriate workaround based on whether you see single or duplicated records. If you have both, apply the single records workaround first, then duplicated records.\r\nh3. Diagnosis - Why is this affecting you?\r\n\r\nThis issue is observed when there are duplicated users that are originated from across different user directories. For example, if Confluence is connected to LDAP, and also connected to Crowd that's connected to the same LDAP with the same sets of users.\u00a0\r\n !confserver36018_diagnosis.png|thumbnail! \r\n The issue may rises when renaming users takes place. As a best practice, clean up the user directories first before going through the cleanup below.\u00a0\r\nh1. SINGLE RECORDS Workaround\r\n\r\nSet the lower_username value for single records only. This will not affect nulls for duplicate records.\r\n{code:sql|title=Single Records Workaround - Scenario type 1 (tested on PSQL and MSSQL)}\r\nupdate user_mapping set lower_username = lower(username) where lower_username is null and lower(username) in \r\n(select LOWER(nullrecords.username) from user_mapping as nullrecords group by LOWER(nullrecords.username) having count(*) = 1);\r\n{code}\r\n_(i)\u00a0This query will search for all single records and update its lower_username with a lowercase of its username._\u00a0\r\n\r\nNow run the diagnosis query again to ensure you are no longer affected with the single records issue/Scenario 1 type issue.\r\nh1. DUPLICATED RECORDS Workaround\r\n\r\n(!)\u00a0From the diagnosis query, if you see that you are affected by\u00a0Scenario type 2 issue, run the following SQL query first. Otherwise, proceed with #1 - Clean up null user records.\r\n{code:sql|title=Single Records Workaround - Scenario type 2 (tested on PSQL)}\r\nselect username, lower_username, count(*) as count into temp1 from user_mapping group by username, lower_username having count(*) > 1;\r\nselect username into temp2 from temp1 where lower(username) not in (select lower(username) from user_mapping where lower_username is not null);\r\nselect username, max(user_key) as keeping into uniqueone FROM user_mapping where username in (select username FROM temp2) group by username;\r\nupdate user_mapping set lower_username = lower(username) where user_key in (select keeping from uniqueone);\r\ndrop table temp1;\r\ndrop table temp2;\r\ndrop table uniqueone;\r\n{code}\r\n\u00a0_(i)\u00a0This query will search for records that has a scenario type 2 issue, and give one of the record to have a lower_username._\r\nh2. #1 - Cleanup null user records without content associated.\r\n\r\nFirst, try to remove the null values. If there is no content that has been created by the users, this set of queries should work. If you run into any Foreign Key constraint errors during this process, *proceed to #2.*\r\nh3.

Step One: Find the affected users\r\n\r\nFirstly, run the below query, and save the results. You'll need the *oldKey* and *newKey* from the results.\r\n{code:sql|title=KeyPair Generator (tested on PSQL, MSSQL, MYSQL and Oracle)}\r\nSELECT \r\n    user_key AS oldKey,\r\n    (SELECT \r\n            user_key\r\n        FROM\r\n            user_mapping u\r\n        WHERE\r\n            lower(u.username) = u.lower_username\r\n                AND lower(u.username) = lower(um.username)) AS newKey,\r\n    um.username,\r\n    um.lower_username\r\nFROM\r\n    user_mapping um\r\nWHERE\r\n    user_key IN (SELECT \r\n            user_key\r\n        FROM\r\n            user_mapping\r\n        WHERE\r\n            (lower(username) != lower_username))\r\n        OR (lower_username is null){code}\r\nh3. Step Two: Validate your Keys:\r\n\r\nCheck if the result of the *Keypair Generator*\u00a0produces any *NULL*\u00a0values for the *newkey* column. NULL newkey values could exist when *Scenario type 2 issue*\u00a0exists in the database. Go back to the beginning of this report to ensure that the scenario 1 and 2 has been ruled out.\r\n\r\nOnly proceed with *Step Three*\u00a0when there are no NULL values in the newkey column.\u00a0\r\nh3.

      "description": "Background\r\n==========\r\nI was working in two different spaces; the keys are WOL and RIT. I created 4 how-to articles (using my edited template) in the RIT space, which\r\nautomatically produced an index page (Content Report Table).\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce\r\n==================\r\n1. I moved the index page from the RIT space to the WOL space using the\r\nTools->Move menu item, which appeared to move all the how-to articles\r\nautomatically with it (nice, I thought).\r\n2. Now in the WOL space, I added a new how-to article but found that it does not appear in the index.\r\n3. Tried adding a new how-to in the RIT space; a new index was generated but it showed no content.\r\n4. Edited the index page to ensure that the Content Report Table macro was referring to the correct label and space; it was (kb-how-to-article and RIT or WOL as applicable). Couldn't see any problem there.\r\n5. Moved everything back to the RIT space. I could see the 4 original articles now in the index; but not any new ones I added.\r\n\r\nAs far as I can tell something happened in the backend when I did step 1. Now no matter what I do I cannot get any new how-to articles to appear in the index page.\r\n\r\nI feel like something needs to get reset in the backend. What's weird is even\r\nif I go to my third space (key WOLDOC) and try to create a how-to article, it also doesn't show up in the index! So it seems like something is messed up in all of my spaces. \r\n\r\nTried the following:\r\n1. Went to the WOL space.\r\n2. Created a new template (from scratch) for the index page, called \"Concept Article Index\". Modelled it on the existing similar index templates, with a create button, horizontal rule and content report table macro.\r\n3. Created a new template for a \"concept article\", giving it a label of\r\n\"wol-concept-article\"\r\n4. Edited the \"Concept Article Index\" template so that the create button\r\ncreates a page with label \"wol-concept-article\"\r\n5. Created an page based on template \"Concept Article Index\", called\r\n\"Concepts\"\r\n6. Used the \"Add Concept article\" button on this page to create a concept\r\narticle \"Concept 1\". Verified that it has the correct label \"wol-concept-article\" and it is obviously in the WOL space.\r\n7. Checked the \"Concepts\" page to see if \"Concept 1\" shows up. It doesn't.\r\n8. Added the \"wol-concept-article\" label to 4 other pages. None of them show up in the \"Concepts\" page either. It simply says \"No content found\", which is obviously not true!\r\n\r\nSomehow, ALL of my index pages (whether created from scratch like above, or via a canned template and auto-generated) have this issue of not showing any of the content they are supposed to be showing!!\r\n\r\nThis is a huge issue for our team, because we use index pages as the first\r\npoint of entry for all our content areas. \r\n\r\nNote that the page tree in the sidebar shows that the child pages exist, and\r\nthey are in the right place (not that place should matter in a content table\r\nreport which only seems to need the label). But we don't want to use the\r\nsidebar for navigation; we only want to use the panels and links shown on the top-level \"home\" page.\r\n",

Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Create a new page with a code block macro\r\n# Enter this text into the code block (two lines are required because it strips whitespace from the first line):\r\n{code}\r\nline 1\r\n        line 2\r\n{code}\r\n#- NB: This was created by typing ordinary spaces with the space bar\r\n# Save the page\r\n# Double click inside the code block to highlight all the text. \r\n#- NB: You will see the text indent slightly, and the numbers that were green are now black (syntax highlighting is off). This is the copy mode I am referring to.\r\n# Copy the text\r\n# Paste it into [this character identifier|http://www.babelstone.co.uk/Unicode/whatisit.html] and convert it\r\n# You will see that the indenting spaces are no-break spaces:\r\n{code}\r\nLATIN SMALL LETTER N\r\nLATIN SMALL LETTER E\r\nSPACE\r\nDIGIT ONE\r\nSPACE\r\nNO-BREAK SPACE\r\nNO-BREAK SPACE\r\nNO-BREAK SPACE\r\nNO-BREAK SPACE\r\nNO-BREAK SPACE\r\nNO-BREAK SPACE\r\nNO-BREAK SPACE\r\nNO-BREAK SPACE\r\nLATIN SMALL LETTER L\r\nLATIN SMALL LETTER I\r\nLATIN SMALL LETTER N\r\nLATIN SMALL LETTER E\r\nSPACE\r\nDIGIT TWO\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nh3. Explanation\r\nThis is by design. [This article|http://listarchives.libreoffice.org/global/users/msg37200.html] explains the behaviour of browsers and why they require non-breaking spaces in order to not compact all the spaces into a single whitespace character. Some text editors will display these characters as non-breaking spaces, while some will not.\r\n\r\nh3. Workarounds\r\n# You may not need to do anything at all - if you want to retain the formatting, these characters will simply ensure that the whitespace is exactly as intended.\r\n# Edit the page and copy the contents of the code block from there.\r\n# Click outside the code block to take it out of copy mode (so the syntax highlighting returns), and copy the contents of the code block by clicking outside of the box and dragging the selection area over the entire block. Repeat the same character identification test and you will see the characters are simply 'SPACE'.\r\nSee the attached video for a demonstration.\r\nNB: This will not work for OpenOffice/LibreOffice, as explained [here|http://listarchives.libreoffice.org/global/users/msg37200.html].\r\n# Copy and paste into a different text editor (eg Sublime Text), and then copy/paste the text again from there into your final destination (eg OpenOffice).\r\n# Find and replace the characters in your text editor, eg find  '\\u00a0' and replace with ' '",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFCLOUD-35980].\n  {panel}\n\nConfluence's WebDAV is very convenient to work with attachments. Also Confluence provides an ability to edit page content as text file in WebDAV folder.\r\nAdmins can hide {{URLs}}, {{@versions}}, {{@exports}} using advanced options, described [here|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Configuring+a+WebDAV+client+for+Confluence]. These options make view of WebDAV folder more clear, only folders for pages/spaces and attachments are visible.\r\n\r\nBut it is possible to edit pages as text files. Historically, WebDAV server was implemented in Confluence 2.3 (CONF-3431). Confluence pages had content in wiki format, and it was easy for human to open it, understand its content, edit it and save.\r\nThe main difference between Confluence 2.3 and Confluence 5.6 from this point of view is storage/edit format. Current format is not for manual editing, but for WYSIWYG editing style. And it is hard for user to *edit* these text files, unlike it was with old good plain wiki. Especially for non-tech users. Users became confused when see text files with abracadabra in WebDAV folder.\r\n\r\nPlease, add an option to hide these text files from WebDAV view, like ones for {{URLs}}, {{@versions}} and {{@exports}} virtual folders. Additionally, I think, it worths to make this option turned off by default, because most users in most installations anyway can't edit these file directly.\r\n\r\nThere are still use cases for showing text files - for example to publish auto-created pages (build tool, report tool, etc) in Confluence. But these cases are not widely used. System admin can turn on described option in its installation. In other cases these files should be hidden.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, please, see [this comment|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Configuring+a+WebDAV+client+for+Confluence?focusedCommentId=695238827#comment-695238827].",

Would it be possible for you to build a feature next to the zoom in/out buttons at the bottom of designs that allows you to show the image at 100%? The \"Fit to Page Width\" feature kind of sort of does this; however, if we are looking at an image that is 700 pixels wide and my screen width is 1400 pixels, then all of a sudden we are far too zoomed in, hence the \"zoom to 100%\" request.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, would it be possible to adjust my user settings so that when I click from one design to the next, each design remains zoomed in at 100% (or however far I have zoomed in or out), in essence remembering where I left it when I clicked away?",

When an application or an application link's 'rpcurl' does not contain a trailing '/' (e.g. https://foobar.com) and it does not explicitly specify a port then a uri of a domain that starts with either the current application or a application link's domain (and scheme) is considered valid. For example, if https://foobar.com is a configured application link then https://foobar.com.attacker.domain is matched and allowed. \r\n\r\nThe atlassian-whitelist-api-plugin includes a [CorsFilter|https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-whitelist/src/9ba2728450d8fe880d3d30e74cc0c75a427e66fb/atlassian-whitelist-api-plugin/src/main/java/com/atlassian/plugins/cors/CorsFilter.java?at=master] which adds CORS headers to whitelisted origin responses that are under its configured url path (/rest/*). The CORS headers the CorsFilter adds allow CORS requests to be sent with credentials and set a custom content-type header. \r\n\r\n*Impact*\r\nWhere a context path or a port is not specified for the current application or a application link, an attacker can setup a site such that they can make CORS requests in a victim's browser to confluence's rest api (read and write from confluence's rest api). As the CORS response headers will permit a CORS request with a custom content-type header XSRF/CSRF protection depending upon the content-type header of an incoming request can be bypassed.\r\n\r\n*How to fix:*\r\nThe in addition to the URI path the scheme, domain and port should be used to check if a uri matches an application link. e.g.\r\nFor ApplicationLinkMatcher\r\n{code}\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    public boolean apply(final URI uri)\r\n    {\r\n        try\r\n        {\r\n            final URI normalizedUri = MatcherUtils.normalizeUri(uri);\r\n           return (applinkRpcUrl.getHost().equals(normalizedUri.getHost()) && \r\napplinkRpcUrl.getScheme().equals(normalizedUri.getScheme()) && \r\napplinkRpcUrl.getPort() == normalizedUri.getPort() &&  \r\napplinkRpcUrl.getPath().equals(uri.getPath()))\r\n\r\n        }\r\n        catch (URISyntaxException e)\r\n        {\r\n            return false;\r\n        }\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nFor SelfUrlMatcher:\r\n{code}\r\n    @Override\r\n    public boolean apply(final URI uri)\r\n    {\r\n        try\r\n        {\r\n            final URI normalizedUri = MatcherUtils.normalizeUri(uri);\r\n            final String baseUrl = Strings.nullToEmpty(applicationProperties.getBaseUrl(UrlMode.CANONICAL));\r\n           return (baseUrl.getHost().equals(normalizedUri.getHost()) && \r\nbaseUrl.getScheme().equals(normalizedUri.getScheme()) && \r\nbaseUrl.getPort() == normalizedUri.getPort() &&  \r\nbaseUrl.getPath().equals(uri.getPath()))\r\n        }\r\n        catch (URISyntaxException e)\r\n        {\r\n            return false;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nAlso the URI path comparison check is not overly useful when used in the CorsFilter because \"The Origin header includes only the information required to identify the principal that initiated the request (typically the scheme, host, and port of initiating origin). In particular, the Origin header does not contain the path or query portions of the URI included in the Referer header that invade privacy without providing additional security.\" (http://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-abarth-origin-03.html)\r\n\r\nNote: confluence implicitly trusts itself and so if confluence is configured with an empty context path, e.g. http://confluence.domain.com, then this issue can be exploited without any configured application links.",

Fortunately, one of the other nodes remained unaffected and was able to continue serving requests, so it did not bring down the whole cluster.\r\n\r\nHere is the scenario:\r\n\r\n*node1*\r\n* All hazelcast listener threads were attempting to process near cache entry invalidations messages\r\n* In order to do this, they need to deserialize the class of the cache key.\r\n* This, in turn, requires loading of the correct key class\r\n* The ConfluenceUberClassLoader delegates out to the pluginClassLoader, which is synchronous.\r\n\r\nSo by this point we have all the listener threads all waiting for the class loading lock. Now:\r\n\r\n* One thread holds the lock, is attempting to load the class of the cache key to invalidate.\r\n* In order to fetch the correct classloader, it needs to check that the right plugin is enabled.\r\n* To check a plugin is enabled, it queries the PluginStateStore\r\n* The CachingPluginStateStore is stored in a near cache, so usually this call is fast. However in this case the near cache had been invalidated\r\n* So in order to read the state of the plugin system, the PluginStateStore had to be reloaded from the cache.\r\n* The partition of the cache needed was on another node, so Hazelcast attempts to read it with a remote operation\r\n\r\nSo by now we have all the threads on node1 waiting for the classloader, which in turn is waiting for the PluginStateStore, which is stored on another node so is waiting for a remote cache operation.\r\n\r\nThe stack trace for the thread attempting the

(node1's). Since all of node1's HZ listener threads were used up waiting, node2's threads got stuck too, waiting for a response from node1. *Deadlock*\r\n\r\n*What we can do about it:*\r\nThe crux of the problem is what is happening on node1:\r\n\r\nCache Operation -> load class -> read plugin state -> remote cache operation\r\n\r\nThis circular dependence on cache operations is what leaves us open to deadlocks. This is particularly an issue because the PluginStateStore is needed for pretty much everything.\r\n\r\n[~oburn] had a great idea: Make the PluginStateStore NOT a regular cache, but a local data store, always. Have it listen to application events to keep itself up to date asynchronously (we do this anyway with plugin events). Ensure it always has a value, so reading the plugin system state is always reliable, and fast. This would allow the threads on node1 to untangle themselves and \"bottom out\" at a local call, rather than a remote one.",
