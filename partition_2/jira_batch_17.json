After using the button many times, when I was new to SourceTree, it was suddenly disabled and I didn't realise at first that it had a connection to the selection.

This feature is currently not really available. There is the \"Actions -> Show In Explorer\" action in the toolbar but that only does the desired behavior when nothing is selected.

I wan't only put entire new text (old not needed)... that text I see independently than commit option: amend lastest commit\r\n * \u00a0improvement: performance: when in file status/all filese (also automatically set from pending files when search), to not autorefresh entire list on activate form(focus) (we have thousands of files and when search and leave it so, then: after activate it back, as window, it refresh a log of time).\r\n * improvement: after of a lot of merges {color:#172b4d}from 200M{color} it consumes a lot of RAM, over 1.3 GB.\r\n\r\nThank you a lot and sorry again\u00a0:(",

      "description": "Hi Atlassian Team, \r\n\r\n:-) \r\n\r\nAs I was writing about our issues with remote tab [SRCTREEWIN-8845|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/SRCTREEWIN-8845] where account manager operations were included, I spotted as I was trying to help the remote tab to perform that an credentials prompt was provided to me. (y)\r\n\r\nIt should be noted that a part of the fact it didn't popped up and it stood standing ashamed somewhere in the behind of other windows it emerged on very much arbitrary time when I was not concerning this functionality any longer, my impression was it emerged with a very long delay. (n)\r\n\r\nI was very much trying to persuade the account manager to behave in numerous ways.... \r\n\r\nFirst of all it seemed to me that it is starting to do at least something (have some minimal reactions to my actions) where there are more then one accounts defined. (on)\r\n\r\nI was really angry with the behaviour of the (first experience) setup account configuration where there it is a must to click login (pressing enter doesn't do the same thing and) when the credentials prompt (in sourcetree's widget) comes up (the user name is missing there and even if I fill it) after passing it my password as well it replies with \"user not found\" / \"username missing\" warning and it fails. (n) (n)\r\nThis behavior is presented when I reach the account manager / credentials prompt by other means as well. :(\r\n\r\nIt also doesn't distinguishes between the same accounts entered with more or less same serverurl ... (n)\r\nas there are multiple entries of servername:port as well as username@servername:port which refers to a same account. \r\n\r\nThere is also an account starting with \"Git:\" which I assume is the master account I have used when prompted by first experience setup.\r\n\r\nAll of the accounts presented in the accounts tab / account manager window are possible to edit / delete or set as default, but none of there options doesn't make sourcetree to reconsider the accounts a part of one of them being changed to default. (n)\r\n\r\nSourcetree also doesn't care if I let it store the passwords or not, it doesn't use those passwords as it doesn't reload the remote tab when trying to reach the server's repositories (not yet cloned). (n)\r\n\r\nThere is a slight chance that switching between accounts and trying to switch to remote tab or refresh its contents with the button that a credentials prompt in window widget will be displayed where there is a chance to issue a password which will be used on next refresh button press. (Y)\r\n\r\nThere is also a chance (not being so slight unfortunately) that sourcetree will crash during the accounts mengling which results in some corruption of the profile related files which in turn prohibits sourcetree to start at all. :(\r\n\r\nIt is also possible to achieve the profile corruption by removing the \"Git:\" tagged account which will again prohibits sourcetree from starting up. (occurred only once)\r\n\r\nThere is also second profile files corruption variant when user tries to install and use sourcetree EE on several client machines on the same network.\r\nAfter such attempt is made the sourcetree  profile is corrupted in the way that the first experience setup will appear everytime sourcetree is run. Second variant of the corruption again prohibits sourcetree from starting at all everagain on the same client machine unless the profile files are completely removed.  \r\n\r\nThank you very much for your support.\r\nBest Regards,\r\n\r\nAdam Dedek\r\nCommerzsystems",

But as we were testing the absolute basics before providing package to our users we have found that  the Remote tab doesn't behave as we think it should be ... \r\n\r\nWhile it is possible to reach the accounts menu thru various paths and adding an account basically works. It also seems that the \"set as default\" button somehow works and is able to switch between the accounts.\r\n(The account management it self has its own issues - I will report in other issue)\r\n\r\nHowever the remote tab never works properly and is not able to display nor freely accessible repositories at bitbucket server nor the repositories my account is able to access. \r\n\r\nIt sometimes displays one repository of many, where it is completely arbitrary selection which repo is displayed and there is noting to do about it.\r\nSometimes it displays a lot of repositories of again very much arbitrary selection where there is also \"load more\" option displayed under the list and pressing that button sometimes adds more entries and sometimes it doesn't. \r\n\r\nOn top of it all regardless the scenario it had went thru there is a \"clone\" button which is impossible to press (and trigger it to start cloning the repository).\r\n\r\nOnly way to clone a repository with sourcetree for us is to either define all manually or go to bitbucket server ui and press \"Clone in SourceTree\" button there which works. \r\n\r\nTesting the behavior earlier I was provided with I was provided with number of popup windows mentioning exceptions or warnings, but I 'm not able to see / find / reach them again. \r\n\r\nIs it possible to turn on somewhat debug mode in sourcetree? \r\n\r\nIs it for example possible to redirect all the messages and exceptions to some file to see where t is struggling and when ? \r\n\r\nAs I was going thru it to confirm the issues are valid and started to fill this ticket form, getting back to sourcetree window on arbitrary occassions clicking here and there along writing the issue text I spotted sourcetree provided me with credentials prompt in an window's widget. When I was able to provide credentials there and clicked refresh several times it was able to load some repositories then. \r\n(seems that the account manager also cannot reuse the stored password!)\r\n\r\nBest Regards,\r\nAdam Dedek\r\nCommerzsystems",

I even tried switching from Embedded git version to system.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe issue is not with the diff tools as I am able to open the diff files just fine from the explorer or on its own.\u00a0\r\n\r\nAny help to resolve this issue is greatly appreciated as it is extremely frustrating to not be able to diff it directly from sourceTree.",
