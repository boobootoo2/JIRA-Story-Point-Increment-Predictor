Note - as of Confluence 5.1.3 you can make an SSL LDAP connection that doesn't verify that the hostname and certificate match by unchecking this box when configuring your user directory:\r\n\r\n!Screen Shot 2013-04-16 at 3.10.37 PM.png!\r\n\r\n----\r\nh5. Original issue description\r\n\r\nStarting Confluence 4.2, the embedded crowd has been upgraded from version 2.3.2 to 2.4. This includes the security fix [CWD-2690] (won't be visible to public) that has been announced in Crowd 2.3.6 release notes - [Crowd 2.3.6 Release Notes|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/CROWD/Crowd+2.3.6+Release+Notes].\r\n\r\nIn Confluence, this has caused a lot of issues to customers with SSL-ed LDAP integration. Mainly because Confluence used to not verify that the server's SSL certificate is valid for the host name in the LDAP connection URL.\r\n\r\nIn Crowd, one can still have the old behaviour by workarounding it:\r\n{quote}\r\nAs a workaround for deployments where there is an expected difference, using an 'ldaps' connection URL and leaving 'Secure SSL' unchecked will preserve the previous behaviour and make an SSL connection but will not verify that the hostname and certificate match.\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nHowever, in Confluence, once you enable \"Use SSL\", there is no way we can fallback to the old behaviour like Crowd above.\r\n!SSL_UserDirectory.png!\r\n\r\nThis feature request is to propose to have similar config/option like Crowd to allow an SSL LDAP connection but without verifying that the hostname and certificate match (fix of CWD-2690).\r\n\r\nh5. Workaround options\r\n\r\n# Fix the certificate to contain the correct name. This is the preferred (and most secure) fix.\r\n# Edit /etc/hosts on the LDAP server to allow you to use the incorrect name in the certificate. Add the FQDN on the certificate and match it to the IP address of the server.\r\n# (!) Backup Confluence database beforehand for safety purpose\r\n#- Run the following SQL query:\r\n{code}\r\nUPDATE cwd_directory_attribute\r\nSET attribute_value='false'\r\nWHERE attribute_name='ldap.secure'\r\nAND directory_id  = <desired_directory_ID>;\r\n{code} \r\n#- Restart Confluence\r\n#- (i) *Note*: The above option will always reverted to its default ('true') whenever you edit the user directory settings. Therefore, you'll need to run that query every time you do any changes on the user directory settings.",

Strangely enough, this page links to [Installing Java for Confluence|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Installing+Java+for+Confluence] which only mentions about JRE, not JDK. This is confusing.\r\n* [Setting the JAVA_HOME Variable in Windows|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Setting+the+JAVA_HOME+Variable+in+Windows] --> JAVA_HOME should be pointed to JDK directory. JRE_HOME should be pointed to JRE directory. Please fix this documentation. For proof, check {{<confluence-install>/conf/setclasspath.bat}} or the {{setenv.bat}} of any installer folder.\r\n\r\nMy two cents:\r\n* Fix the inconsistencies above\r\n* [Installing Java for Confluence|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Installing+Java+for+Confluence] should be modified to provide a guide to install both JRE and JDK... and explains that Confluence can run with either JRE or JDK.\r\n* Provide a separate page on how to set JRE_HOME (or merge the two into one)",

You have a page where there is a wall of text and a excerpt macro, alright now you think hey \"I could be able to make this page _less_ confusing with just  hiding the excerpt macro.. no biggie..\" and you start to hide the macro:\r\n# You have to click *edit*\r\n# You have to *select* the excerpt macro\r\n# You have to click *Edit*\r\n# You have to check the box that says *Hide Excerpted Content*\r\n# You have to click *Save*\r\n# Then you have to write to the \"What did you change?\" text area\r\n# THEN you have to uncheck the \"Notify watchers\"\r\n# Then you think \"PHEW this was hard..

This means people are not going to be aware of it, and therefore less likely to be used: if it were visible all the time then it would be more likely to be used.\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nand another point:\r\n\r\n{quote}\r\nAnother thing I notice with the current position of the Like icon is that it gets a bit lost if there's other things below it, such as comments (check attachment).\r\n\r\nIf it was on the right of the screen, where the Labels icon is, it wouldn't be so lost.

This was a major feature for us, and a significant factor in choosing Crucible over other code review systems.\r\n\r\nWhat we used to be able to do was to create a review, browse Confluences as a 'repository', and select the pages we wanted to review. If a reviewer had a comment, then in Crucible they could insert that comment right at the lines/paras that the comment applied to - i.e. exactly like source code. It also meant we could review design docs and code alongside each other.{quote}\r\n\r\nAs noted [here|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/CRUCIBLE/Crucible+2.7+Upgrade+Guide] the plugin was unbundled from Crucible 2.7 as it was made to work with Wiki Markup.\r\n\r\nTo return, a version would need to be created which supported the new Storage Format.",

The links become unclickable and the URL address is gone when you try to edit it\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Create a link URL address [http://test.com/doc=\\{123\\}|http://test.com/doc=\\{123\\}]\r\n# Save the page\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n# The URL link is clickable\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n# The URL is not clickable. This is what's shown in the source: {code:html}<a rel=\"nofollow\">LINK TEXT</a>{code}\r\n\r\nh3. Notes\r\n# This also happens when adding the link through the Link Macro\r\n\r\nh3.Workaround\r\nEscaping the curly brackets with a backslash would not work. However, replacing the curly brackets with a valid ASCII format would work. This means that open curly bracket *{* is converted to {{%7B}} and closed curly bracket *}* is converted to {{%7D}}. For example [http://test.com/doc=%7B123%7D|http://test.com/doc=%7B123%7D]\r\n\r\nIn case of MS SharePoint another workaround is using [SharePoint ShortUrl|https://store.office.com/en-gb/app.aspx?assetid=WA104368123&ui=en-US&rs=en-GB&ad=GB&appredirect=false]",

I know that I must have been doing something wrong the first time around for the link to the profile image to have been created, but I am afraid I cannot recall the exact keystrokes.)\r\n\r\nAfter receiving the error (and hence, being unable to save the page), I deleted what I thought might be the problem (the link), and then opened the Source Editor plugin to view the XML. The second paragraph, that had contained the link, had the following class attribute:\r\n\r\n{code}<p class=\"confluence-link\">{code}\r\n\r\nI deleted the class attribute, returned to the rich text editor, re-created the link to the user name, and saved the page without further ado.\r\n\r\nIn my attempts to reproduce this error, I managed to create XML with the following (to me, extraneous - and, certainly, as far as the view presented by the rich text editor is concerned, invisible) span element around the ac:link:\r\n\r\n{code}<p>jhdfkjhdfkdfj <span class=\"confluence-link\">\r\n    <ac:link>\r\n      <ri:user ri:username=\"grahan01\"/>\r\n      <ac:plain-text-link-body><![CDATA[~grahan01]]></ac:plain-text-link-body>\r\n    </ac:link>\r\n  </span> dkjdfkjdfkjdf.</p>{code}",

Cancelling the save action, leaves the original link text intact.\r\n\r\n*Steps to reproduce (Scenario 2)*\r\n# Create a new page\r\n# Insert a new link and search for any existing page. Make sure you edit the \"Link Text\" to something else, for example \"Link Test\".\r\n# Click insert and save the page\r\n# Edit the page\r\n# Edit the newly created link and click save\r\n# Save the page\r\n# The link text is automatically changed and the name of the page of the link is automatically appended into this text\r\n",
