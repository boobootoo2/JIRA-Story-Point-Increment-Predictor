[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFCLOUD-9192].\n  {panel}\n\nIt would be really helpful if there was an automated nightly build service for https://svn.atlassian.com/svn/public/contrib/ projects.\r\n\r\nWhy it might make sense:\r\n\r\n* The cost of setting up and maintaining the build environment would be outweighed by the showcasing of clover in a number of real projects to potential clover buyers, and if you use continuum there is no licensing cost.\r\n* The quality of available maven plugins provided by the community (collaboration!) would increase through clover reporting in builds of those projects.\r\n* You would have better quick insight into what is going on in community provided plugins through clover reporting of those projects, and could send out nag emails (if requested) when builds are broken thereby keeping developers of those plugins engaged in its development.\r\n* You would incent more developers to become involved in plugin development for atlassian, because it would be cool.\r\n\r\nOne way to do this:\r\n\r\n* Setup a server at atlassian (or use an existing one) that has nothing better to do to run continuum and make its reports publicly accessible (probably via publishing to some other server).\r\n* Edit http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DEVNET/Developer+Subversion+Repository and tell people to talk to you if they are interested in this new service, and that they will have to upgrade their build to Maven 2 if they are interested. Also, send something out to confluence-developer@lists.atlassian.com saying the same.\r\n* Information on how to do upgrade a maven 1 project to maven 2 is here. It may need a little work, but I'd be happy to assist in maintaining it or providing whatever info I can to help get people started: http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DISC/Developing+Confluence+Plugins+with+Maven+2\r\n* Tell developers to add a profile similar to the following to their pom.xml which would look for a clover license file that would only exist on the build server (for example, in the java.home dir) and only runs this profile if that license exists:\r\n\r\n <project>\r\n   ...\r\n  <profiles>\r\n    <profile>\r\n      <id>atlassian-nightly-build</id>\r\n      <activation>\r\n        <file>\r\n          <exists>${java.home}/clover.license</exists>\r\n        </file>\r\n      </activation>\r\n      ...\r\n    </profile>\r\n  </profiles>\r\n  ...\r\n</project>\r\n",

Access Confluence through a different URL to the standard URL (to trick pages into thinking that an incoming link is an external referrer). I edited my \"hosts\" file in Windows to point the address \"test\" to 127.0.0.1.\r\n2. Create a comment on a page with a link to any page in Confluence.\r\n3. Go to the comment permlink.\r\n4. Follow the link in the comment to a page.\r\n5. Check the Info tab of the target page and a referrer should have been added.\r\n6. Ban this referrer.\r\n7. In \"Manage Referrers\" of admin, you can't delete the newly banned referrer.\r\n\r\nI confirmed that I could not delete the following referrer URLs:\r\n\r\n1. http://test:8080/display/DEMO/Home?focusedCommentId=1933313#comment-1933313\r\n2. http://test:8080/display/DEMO/Home?showComments=true&showCommentArea=true\r\n\r\nMaybe the code is tripping over the question mark?

Content that is only restricted to this user will become available to all confluence users. Are you sure you want to delete this user?\"\r\n\r\nThe thing that scares me about this is \"Content that is only restricted to this user will become available to all confluence users.\" One of the main reasons we bought Confluence was because certain documentation should be limited to one or more individuals.\r\n\r\nIf someone on our support team removes a user and by doing so opens up content that the user owned to everyone out there, this could expose sensitive information and cause huge headaches.\r\n\r\nA suggested alternative to this (which would work for bulk user deletes also) would be to show a table (could be paged) of the following when an administrator tries to remove one or more users and those users have content that only they have permissions to:\r\n\r\nTable column headings:\r\nUserid - Page (or Object that users has sole permissions to) - Reassign to Group/User\r\n\r\nReassign to Group/User cells under heading would contain a dropdown with values: \"User\" and \"Group\" and then an empty text field with a \"lookup\" button next to it.\r\n\r\nThen you could also have two links next to Reassign... for each row called \"reassign all for user\" (that will fill in the reassign field for all content solely owned by that user, and something at the top called \"reassign all\" (or similar) that lets you just bulk reassign everything (regardless of user who owns it) to a single user/group.\r\n\r\nI know that sounds like a lot, but I think that is one way to do it more safely. You might also state something like \"You should encourage your users to always have more than one person assigned to private content to avoid this page.\"",

If they have not created any favourite pages or spaces yet, they will not be able to see where to go to do so.  Coupled with shortcomings in the Browse alphabetically (eg, no all pages, defaults to pages beginning with A, rather than all pages) and by hierarchy (treeview should default to expanded) functions which both hinder content navigation, this is a negative experience when trying to increase wiki adoption.  It is also usually one of the first obstacles a new user has to face, and, well, first impressions do last (especially with non-technical users) ...",
