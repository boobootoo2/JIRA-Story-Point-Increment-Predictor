Problem Definition\r\n\r\nIf you use an external tool for user management(Jira, LDAP or other) in Confluence and intend to create a group called 'confluence-administrators' there instead of the internal one(let's say you deleted it), you can. But, when you go in Confluence Global Permissions to add it and edit its permissions, you can't edit the group permissions. See attached.\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nConfluence admins should be able to create a group with this name, even know that this is the name of one of the 2 special groups of Confluence. See [Confluence Groups|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Confluence+Groups].\r\n \r\nh3. Workaround \r\n\r\nThe only workaround possible is to set a similar name like \"confluence-admins\". ",

      "description": "h3. Problem Definition\r\nWhen migrating from Confluence Single Node to Confluence Data Center, the 'Remember Me' option is set to true by default. This behavior is to ensure session affinity in case the load balancer was not properly set with session stickiness.\r\nThis is not properly communicated neither in our [Confluence Cookies Documentation|https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/confluence-cookies-160794071.html] neither from the UI\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\nWe can handle this in multiple ways:\r\n# We can display the 'Remember Me' automatically checked by default and the user can uncheck it if needed\r\n# In case, where we need to enforce this, we can show it checked but greyed out and the user cannot unckeck it. We can also add a link to a KB where we explain why we have set this to true by default\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\nIf you want to disable the Remeber Me by default in Confluence Data Center, our initial KB article [How to disable the 'Remember Me' feature in Confluence|https://confluence.atlassian.com/confkb/how-to-disable-the-remember-me-feature-in-confluence-118686062.html] did not include the Data Center option.
