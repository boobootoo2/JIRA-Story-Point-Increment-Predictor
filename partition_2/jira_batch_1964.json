It also means you could access the same snip under different category navigation directions (when it rightly satisfies both categorisations).\n\nEven cooler would then be the next step of auto-generation of categorisation metadata from the snip/page contents (if you happened to have some natural language (bayesian) means of categorisation - ala Autonomy)",
