[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFCLOUD-6542].\n  {panel}\n\nTo meet new requirements originating from Privacy legislation and regulatory bodies in the financial services sector, my company has decided to introduce a Data Classification policy. The policy will specify the levels of sensitivity of various types of data/documents and the access controls required for each level. Confluence can already support this using Space and Page level security controls. However, we believe it would be much more convenient to have the ability to apply (pre-defined) access controls according to a document's data classification within a single space. I think this would be similar to the \"issue level\" security in JIRA. ",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFCLOUD-6523].\n  {panel}\n\nThis feature request would greatly add to the usability of Confluence for less technical users.\r\n\r\nWe would like to be able to easily add a pulldown to the edit toolbar that could contain plugins or macros.\r\n\r\nAs an example, we added the Table of Contents plugin that allows you to auto-generate a TOC from the headings in the document. The \"command word\" for this is: {toc}\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if this could be added to a pulldown in the edit toolbar so users could easily see what extened functionality was available from plugins or macros. In the toolbar it would use a descriptive word such as \"Table of Contents\" and when selected would add \"{toc}\" into the document for them.\r\n\r\nOptionally you could create and assign this to a new icon on the edit toolbar instead of a text pulldown.\r\n\r\nAlso, it would be nice if the plugin SDK was extended to allow plugins to have an option for adding an icon/pulldown text. If the plugin had this option, it would show up in the admin/plugins panel as maybe checkboxs (\"show icon on edit toolbar\" / choose an icon) and/or (\"show in pulldown\" \\ \"Pulldown text: \").\r\n\r\nBeing able to extend the edit toolbar in this way would make editing much easier- and because you will always/ know/remember what functionality is available to you, make better pages in the process.\r\n",

I can't go back and click on pages 1-10 cause then it goes back to previous behavior (only showing 1-10 and NOT in alphabetically order). Click on page 20 and magically 4 more pages are possible - from 1-24 and next button. Looks alphabetical. Then I click on page 21 and now its starting to show me my Confluence defined groups in alphabetical order EXCEPT for confluence-user and confluence-administrators which show on the LAST page at the end.

I tried to access it via http, and received an error that the proxy was unable to respond to /GET.\r\n\r\nI logged into the host and checked; the process was still running. So I collected the log files, then ran bin/shutdown.sh and bin/startup.sh. Confluence is running ok. Below is email from the user, describing her actions (which you can also reconstruct from the access log, attached).\r\n\r\nThe user's complaint that Confluence's clock is off by an hour is a daylight savings time issue.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nCheryl\r\n\r\n----------------------  user email about hang -----------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\tFrom: \t  rmathias@4tginc.com\r\n\tSubject: \tConfluence Crash\r\n\tDate: \tJune 28, 2006 12:21:23 PM PDT\r\n\tTo: \t  cheryl@mathiastechnology.com\r\n\r\nThank you for fixing Confluence.\r\n\r\nI was editing this page in rich text mode using Firefox:\r\nhttp://confluence.mathiasconsulting.com/display/mkt/MMIS+Conference+Theme\r\n\r\nI had already successfully inserted CooksIllustrated0001.jpg in the page. I wanted to put another graphic next to it. I clicked on the insert graphic icon. The 4 graphics attached to the page were displayed. I selected CooksIllustrated0002.jpg and clicked Thumbnail. I believe that I got as far as clicking on the insert button. After that, there was a long pause. I thought that it might take a while to insert the graphic, so I switched to a different screen while I was waiting (using Desktop Manager).\r\n\r\nOn the new screen, I saw that there was a Firefox page open where I had been looking at a PDF a few days ago but no longer had security access for that page (this was a secure page which had timed out). I clicked the red button to close that window. Firefox crashed. When I tried to restart Firefox and reload the session, Firefox crashed again.\r\n\r\nI rebooted my computer.\r\n\r\nAfter reboot, I opened Firefox again, this time without restoring the last session. At that point, I realized that Confluence had crashed.\r\n\r\nThe page I had been editing (http://confluence.mathiasconsulting.com/display/mkt/MMIS+Conference+Theme) appears to be fine despite the crash. The graphic was not inserted. The Recent Changes list shows that the last change to the page was at 10:04.\r\n\r\nThe Confluence clock is one hour later than our clock, which is why I thought the crash was later.\r\n\r\nRobin\r\n--\r\nRobin Mathias\r\nExecutive Consultant\r\nFourThought Group, Inc.\r\nVoice: 707-636-0418\r\n\r\nhttp://4tginc.com\r\n\r\nWant to know more about MITA?

Global colour scheme should be labelled as \"global colour scheme\" not \"custom colour scheme\".\r\n2. Global colour scheme should not say \"choose a colour scheme\" when there isn't a choice\r\n3. Global colour scheme should not use the label \"selected\" next to a colour scheme when there's no way to select any other.\r\n4. Space colour scheme should be clearer in showing what is the default (global) colour scheme, and what is the custom. A colour scheme can either be customised or it can be default, but the UI implies there are more options.\r\n\r\nIt looks like the interface of both space and global colour scheme pages was designed for a situation where there are more than 2 options to choose from. For colour schemes, there is only default or custom. The interface should reflect this better.\r\n\r\nSome other ideas:\r\n\r\n1. Make it easy to reset a single colour back to either the global default or the saved value. Put two colour boxes on the right of the colour picker in columns labelled 'Global default' and 'Current value', where clicking on them changes the text box value.\r\n2. Hide the unnecessary top row of colour boxes when editing a colour scheme.\r\n",
