Summary of Bug\r\n\r\nShowing results of JIRA Macro as a table (when the result is only 1 issue) is not possible, even though the macro version is 5.1. This should be possible, as stated in the release statement of this version :\r\n\r\nbq. Added the ability to insert issue table when there is none or one issue returned from search query.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n# After linking Confluence with JIRA, try using JIRA Issues Macro\r\n# Search for something that would only return one result\r\n# Try showing the results as a table\r\n\r\nh3. Additional Findings\r\n\r\nThis is only able to be reproduced sometimes. It depends on the query used to find the issues :\r\n\r\n* If I search with key = <issuekey>, then the result is not able to be shown as a table\r\n* If I search with issue = <issuekey>, then the results would still be able to be shown as a table\r\n* If I search with just the issuekey, then the results is not able to be shown as a table",

In this case, I install Confluence under following folder hierarchy:\r\n\r\n{code}/home/confluence\r\n  |_  current/   = INST_DIR\r\n  |_  .home/     = HOME_DIR\r\n  |_  backups/   = Location where old backups are held, everytime I upgrade{code}\r\n\r\nIt all works good. When using MySQL as the production RDBMS, I first install {{libmysql-java}} library which fetches JDBC drivers:\r\n\r\n{code}sudo apt-get install libmysql-java{code}\r\n\r\nThe latest driver is generally linked through {{/usr/share/java/mysql.jar}} file. In all my Atlassian product installations, I just link to that file. For example, in the case of Confluence, I link to that location from {{INST_DIR/confluence/WEB-INF/lib/mysql.jar}}. Generally it works with other Atlassian software, but for some reasons Confluence doesn't like this method. The error in log file is evidently permission related, although I have target file on 0777:\r\n\r\n{code}Dec 09, 2013 8:34:55 PM org.apache.catalina.startup.Catalina start\r\nSEVERE: Catalina.start:\r\nLifecycleException:  start: :  java.io.IOException: Failed to access resource /WEB-INF/lib/mysql.jar\r\n        at org.apache.catalina.loader.WebappLoader.start(WebappLoader.java:709)\r\n        at org.apache.catalina.core.StandardContext.start(StandardContext.java:4575)\r\n        at org.apache.catalina.core.ContainerBase.start(ContainerBase.java:1057)\r\n        at org.apache.catalina.core.StandardHost.start(StandardHost.java:840)\r\n        at org.apache.catalina.core.ContainerBase.start(ContainerBase.java:1057)\r\n        at org.apache.catalina.core.StandardEngine.start(StandardEngine.java:463)\r\n        at org.apache.catalina.core.StandardService.start(StandardService.java:525)\r\n        at org.apache.catalina.core.StandardServer.start(StandardServer.java:754)\r\n        at org.apache.catalina.startup.Catalina.start(Catalina.java:595)\r\n        at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke0(Native Method)\r\n        at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(Unknown Source)\r\n        at sun.reflect.DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(Unknown Source)\r\n        at java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Unknown Source)\r\n        at org.apache.catalina.startup.Bootstrap.start(Bootstrap.java:289)\r\n        at org.apache.catalina.startup.Bootstrap.main(Bootstrap.java:414){code}\r\n\r\nIs there any way to fix this behaviour?",

      "description": "It has been reported that the navlinks plugin seems to be running database queries to lookup information about certain application links very often (over 4 times per second). This seems to be opening up new connections to the database pool which then becomes saturated to the point of failure - java.lang.InterruptedException. \r\n\r\nThis seems to be related to CONFDEV-17389, however it is unsure whether the root cause was fixed for that.\r\n\r\nThis can cause performance issues and affect the page load times. In a extreme case it could even bring down the server and cause database connection pool starvation.\r\n\r\n\r\nErrors in the logs: \r\n{code}\r\nERROR [Navlink Plugin Executor:thread-3] [sf.hibernate.util.JDBCExceptionReporter] logExceptions An SQLException was provoked by the following failure: java.lang.InterruptedException\r\n{code}\r\n{code}\r\nWARN [Navlink Plugin Executor:thread-4] [mchange.v2.resourcepool.BasicResourcePool] prelimCheckoutResource com.mchange.v2.resourcepool.BasicResourcePool@ -- an attempt to checkout a resource was interrupted, and the pool is still live: some other thread must have either interrupted the Thread attempting checkout!\r\njava.lang.InterruptedException\r\n\tat java.lang.Object.wait(Native Method)\r\n\tat com.mchange.v2.resourcepool.BasicResourcePool.awaitAvailable(BasicResourcePool.java:1315)\r\n\tat com.mchange.v2.resourcepool.BasicResourcePool.prelimCheckoutResource(BasicResourcePool.java:557)\r\n\tat com.mchange.v2.resourcepool.BasicResourcePool.checkoutResource(BasicResourcePool.java:477)\r\n\tat com.mchange.v2.c3p0.impl.C3P0PooledConnectionPool.checkoutPooledConnection(C3P0PooledConnectionPool.java:525)\r\n\tat com.mchange.v2.c3p0.impl.AbstractPoolBackedDataSource.getConnection(AbstractPoolBackedDataSource.java:128)\r\n\tat net.sf.hibernate.connection.C3P0ConnectionProvider.getConnection(C3P0ConnectionProvider.java:33)\r\n\tat net.sf.hibernate.impl.BatcherImpl.openConnection(BatcherImpl.java:292)\r\n\tat net.sf.hibernate.impl.SessionImpl.connect(SessionImpl.java:3388)\r\n\tat net.sf.hibernate.impl.SessionImpl.connection(SessionImpl.java:3348)\r\n\tat org.springframework.orm.hibernate.HibernateTransactionManager.doBegin(HibernateTransactionManager.java:422)\r\n..\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nh3. Workarounds\r\nThe below are mitigation steps that could be taken to minimize the impact of this issue.\r\n* Reduce the number of threads in Navlink Plugin Executor (which defaults to 12), to 4. This requires the below JVM startup parameter to be passed, in the manner as described in [this page|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Configuring+System+Properties]:\r\n{code}\r\n-Dnavlink.executor.threadpool=4 \r\n{code}\r\n* Review Confluence Admin > Application Navigator, and remove invalid applications (if any). E.g. any that are offline or no longer in use\r\n* Increase the database connection pool. See Step 4 in the Resolution of [this KB article|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/CONFKB/Confluence+Slows+and+Times+Out+During+Periods+of+High+Load+Due+to+DB+Connection+Pool?src=search]\r\n\r\nh3. Disabling the plugin\r\nIf the above workarounds aren't working for you, it may be necessary to disable the plugin:\r\n\r\n# Shut down Confluence\r\n# Perform a full database backup\r\n# Obtain the current plugin state map:\r\n{code:sql}select BANDANAVALUE from BANDANA where BANDANAKEY = 'plugin.manager.state.Map'{code}\r\n\r\nIf it's an empty map ({{<map/>}}) then you can use the following value to update the table:\r\n{code}\r\n<map>\r\n  <entry>\r\n    <string>com.atlassian.confluence.plugins.confluence-nav-links</string>\r\n    <boolean>false</boolean>\r\n  </entry>\r\n</map>\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nOtherwise, you'll need to add the entry {{<entry>}} to the existing map, and then save that.\r\n{code}\r\nUPDATE BANDANA SET BANDANAVALUE = 'xxx' WHERE BANDANAKEY = 'plugin.manager.state.Map'\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nReplace {{xxx}} with your updated map. For example, here's the change I made in my local instance:\r\n\r\n{code}\r\nUPDATE BANDANA SET BANDANAVALUE = '<map>\r\n  <entry>\r\n    <string>com.atlassian.confluence.plugins.confluence-nav-links</string>\r\n    <boolean>false</boolean>\r\n  </entry>\r\n</map>' WHERE BANDANAKEY = 'plugin.manager.state.Map'\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nAfter making the change, restart Confluence. You'll notice that the application switcher (The three lines in the top left hand corner of the screen) are now gone - that's the application switcher that's been disabled as a result of disabling the Navlinks plugin.\r\n\r\nTo revert the change, either update that value with {{<map/>}} again, or restore the database backup.\r\n\r\nh5.Excessive Logging\r\nYou may receive a lot of logging stating that the Navlinks plugin has been disabled. You can add the following statement to {{log4j.properties}} to suppress the message (as it's not particularly helpful). Please note that Confluence will need to be restarted to pick up this logging change:\r\n{code}\r\nlog4j.logger.com.atlassian.confluence.plugins.soy.VelocityFriendlySoyTemplateRenderer=ERROR\r\n{code}",

      "description": "h3. Summary\r\nIf I take a single file and drag-and-drop it into the Attachments macro, and then take the very same file and click the \"Browse for files\" link to upload it again to Confluence, I end up with two files on the page with what seems to be the same name.\r\n\r\nh3. Environment\r\nThis occurs with WebKit browsers (tested with Chrome 31.0.1650.57 and Safari 7, both on OS X 10.9). This does not appear to be a problem with Firefox.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Download the attached file \"Les Mis\u00e9rables.txt\".\r\n# Since this is a coding issue, verify that your browser hasn't munged the coding of the file as uploaded to (or downloaded from) JAC. For example:\r\n\r\n{code}\r\n# cd ~/Downloads\r\n# ls \"Les Mis\u00e9rables.txt\" | od -t x1\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nThe results should show this:\r\n\r\n{code}\r\n0000000    4c  65  73  20  4d  69  73  65  cc  81  72  61  62  6c  65  73\r\n0000020    2e  74  78  74  0a                                            \r\n0000025\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nNote in particular the \"65 cc 81\". If it says \"c3  a9\" then the coding got munged somewhere along the way.\r\n\r\nIf you can't download this file successfully with the right name, you can also create one from a Mac in Terminal.app by typing:\r\n\r\n#cat >\"Les Mis\u00e9rables.txt\"\r\nfoo^D\r\n\r\nto enter the accented \"e\", type \"<option-e>e\" on any Mac that is using the standard US keyboard layout.\r\n# Go to a page containing the attachments macro. Click the \"browse for files\" link and select the file you just downloaded/created to upload it.\r\n# On the resulting page, copy the filename from the attachments macro to the clipboard with command-C.\r\n# Open Terminal.app, type \"pbpaste | od -t x1\" and you should see:\r\n{code}\r\n0000000    4c  65  73  20  4d  69  73  c3  a9  72  61  62  6c  65  73  2e\r\n0000020    74  78  74                                                    \r\n0000023\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nNotice that the \"65 cc 81\" has disappeared.\r\n# Go back to Confluence and drag and drop the same file into the same attachments container.\r\n# Notice that there are now two copies of the file on the same page! See screenshot.\r\n# Copy the text from the most recently-uploaded file to the clipboard.\r\n# In Terminal.app, type \"pbpaste | od -t x1\" again and notice that the file has an extra byte in the filename:\r\n{code}\r\n0000000    4c  65  73  20  4d  69  73  65  cc  81  72  61  62  6c  65  73\r\n0000020    2e  74  78  74                                                \r\n0000024\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nIn this case, you will see that the correct \"65 cc 81\" is still there.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nConfluence should pick up on the fact that they are logically the same filename\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nThe difference in encoding causes two different filenames.\r\n \r\nh3. Notes\r\nThe underlying issue is that when uploading with a particular name using the \"Browse for files\" link in the attachments macro, something is transcoding a Unicode \"combining mark\" and combining it with its base letter to an entirely new Unicode codepoint, which results in a logically different filename.",

      "description": "Possibly there is an underlying bug in the upgrade task to 5.3.x when the database in use is MS SQL Server. In 5.3.x, PAGEID column should be replaced with CONTENTID instead in NOTIFICATIONS table, but for this case somehow both columns exist and the value in CONTENTID column is all NULL. Somehow the migration task did not migrate PAGEID data in NOTIFICATIONS table to CONTENTID column and drop the PAGEID column.\r\n\r\nThis causes three different issues so far:\r\n# Unable to purge a trash or any trash at all. The issue occurred after an upgrade to 5.3.x and the following appears in the atlassian-confluence.log:\r\n{code}\r\n2013-10-22 13:33:13,681 ERROR [http-8090-2] [sf.hibernate.util.JDBCExceptionReporter] logExceptions The DELETE statement conflicted with the REFERENCE constraint \"FK594ACC88C38FBEA\".

CONTENTID is all NULL instead.\r\n\r\nh5. Resolution\r\nAll of the above can be fixed by implementing the steps below:\r\n# Stop Confluence\r\n# Backup Confluence database and Home Directory.\r\n# Run the following SQL query to copy the PAGEID values into the CONTENTID column\r\n{code}\r\nUPDATE NOTIFICATIONS SET CONTENTID = PAGEID WHERE PAGEID IS NOT NULL;\r\n{code}\r\n# Run the following query to drop the PAGEID Foreign Key constraint (double check the actual key name in the NOTIFICATIONS table)\r\n{code}\r\nALTER TABLE NOTIFICATIONS DROP FK594ACC88C38FBEA;\r\n{code}\r\n# Run query to drop the index on the PAGEID column\r\n{code}\r\ndrop index NOTIFICATIONS.n_pageid_idx;\r\n{code}\r\n# Run this query to drop the actual PAGEID column\r\n{code}\r\nALTER TABLE NOTIFICATIONS DROP COLUMN PAGEID;\r\n{code}\r\n# Start Confluence\r\n# You should now be able to purge the trash, delete any space, and see a list of page watchers in Watch > Manage Watchers.\r\n\r\n\r\nh5. Important note\r\nThe original bug in the upgrade task has been fixed. This means customers upgrading from Confluence versions lower than 5.3 to 5.4.4+ should no longer be affected by this.  \r\n\r\nHowever if you have previously upgraded from an older version of Confluence and are affected by this problem upgrading again to Confluence 5.4.4+ will NOT rerun the upgrade task. Therefore for customers in this situation it is still necessary to run the workaround, since upgrading alone is not sufficient to fix this problem.",

Workaround\r\nCheck that all of the third-party plugins have been upgraded to the latest compatible version in accordance with https://marketplace.atlassian.com. Disable/remove any that do not have a version compatible with your Confluence version.\r\n\r\nIn some cases we've seen, simply disabling the incompatible plugins is insufficient to resolve the issue. The plugins must be uninstalled completely. One of these is the \"Adaptavist Rate Macro\" plugin.

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFCLOUD-31865].\n  {panel}\n\nI've been actively using Confluence for the last 5 years, with peripheral exposure to Confluence admin for the last 2 years.  In that time, I've developed a love/hate relationship with blog posts.\r\n\r\nThe love comes from the usefulness of this feature, i.e. managing date-oriented content separately from the page hierarchy.  In addition to the usual blogging uses (i.e. individuals spouting their personal opinions on a variety of topics), blog posts are wonderfully useful to document any date-centric event, such as product release notes or meeting notes...and this is particularly true when coupled with an intelligent labelling strategy and the Blog Posts macro on a related page.  Meeting Notes are especially handy to implement with blog posts, because doing them with pages would mean indefinitely adding items to an ever-growing page hierarchy (especially for daily or weekly meetings).\r\n\r\nSadly, the hate comes from how Atlassian continues to lag blog post capabilities behind page capabilities.  Looking at CONF-234, I can see that blog posts have existed in Confluence since Release 1.0.  However, every additional capability has been implemented later than the equivalent capability on pages (in some cases, much, much later!):\r\n\r\n* CONF-1307: Add comments (fixed in Release 1.1)\r\n* CONF-1712: Remote API support (fixed in Release 1.1)\r\n* CONF-2025: Blog Attachments (fixed in Release 1.4)\r\n* CONF-3768: Labels for blog posts (fixed in Release 2.0)\r\n* CONF-1989: Blog version history (fixed in Release 2.1.5)\r\n* CONF-6599: Display blog labels (fixed in Release 2.2.7)\r\n* CONF-1576: Rename blog post (fixed in Release 2.6)\r\n* CONF-12915: Change comment when editing blog post (fixed in Release 3.3)\r\n* CONF-5307: Include macro supports blog posts (fixed in Release 3.5)\r\n* CONF-5599: PDF Export support (fixed in Release 5.0)\r\n* CONF-2455: Move blog post to another space (to be fixed in Release 5.5)\r\n\r\nToday, blog posts still:\r\n\r\n* can't have permissions set independently of the space permissions (unlike pages)\r\n* can't be created using templates (or the newer Blueprints)\r\n* in the most recent releases of Confluence, the date-based navigation features appear to have been *removed*\r\n** I used to be able to click through the blog a month at a time, with handy title-based links...now, I have to select _Browse_ \\-> _Blog_ in the header bar and scroll through months of blog posts at once (without any navigation links), or click the month in the header of an existing blog post to see that month's blog posts, with no way to move from month to month other than modifying the URL directly!\r\n\r\nSo, this \"improvement\" request is my plea for Atlassian to stop hating on blog posts.  Blog posts have just as much utility as Pages, but they're continuously treated as second-class citizens of the Confluence feature set.  Please, please, please bring some equality to Confluence!",
