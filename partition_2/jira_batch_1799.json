I basically followed the instructions here, but replaced JIRA with Confluence:\r\n\r\nhttp://confluence.atlassian.com/display/CRUCIBLE/Using+Gadgets+in+Crucible\r\n\r\nAfter following the steps for setting up OAuth (as the document suggests), I wasn't able to view data.  In the Confluence logs the following error would appear:\r\n\r\n{noformat}\r\n2010-10-19 03:55:11,324 WARN [http-8080-5] [shindig.gadgets.oauth.OAuthResponseParams] logDetailedWarning OAuth fetch fatal error\r\n -- url: /plugins/servlet/gadgets/makeRequest | userName: dhansen | referer: http://confluence:8080/plugins/servlet/gadgets/ifr?container=atlassian&mid=32212516864&country=GB&lang=en&view=default&view-params=%7B%22writable%22%3A%22false%22%7D&st=atlassian%3A82Pv4Sf6klrwo%2Btupa5wh7GGNdb1hbdJMxmBd4Yo3dBYwWSv3eAXhxciSgzCb9DQ1jQqWlNWPxjStVyESovbNlRVwxuX1PEuAu8B5a%2FtZmpNHHitiqWBi9uYiQRgYI3bVLsESX1ajAxZihXpg56X6H3M7NqE9WHAGu%2FSnjZlpdwOxQBva2fJoRuuNw6kC9BHLutpH6oedGsUIxChwi0y5cehL%2BLRIwOl4me2uIzn9Lev1onJrcZf2cdJdIQ4JiIYZ5pS3xCRmAkUSC59AxGRv2BUL03IpQV1vGod3rs0HmSX2sG0LZg54EXUjV9xdaQevPBBWg%3D%3D&url=http%3A%2F%2Fdevtools%3A8060%2Frest%2Fgadgets%2F1.0%2Fg%2Fcom.atlassian.fecru.fecru-gadgets-plugin%3AoverdueReviews%2Fgadgets%2Ftodo.xml&libs=auth-refresh\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nHowever, once I configured the Trusted Applications link between the two applications, the widgets were viewed properly.
