      "description": "We use JIRA with Bitbucket's pull request process and the DVCS auto-transition of issues (in our JIRA workflow from In Progress -> Review when a PR is opened) generally works very well for us.\r\n\r\nHowever we have occasions where we will keep a feature under development on its own feature branch, separate from master and/or one of our release branches for a significant amount of time.  In order to keep these feature branches \"fresh\", we occasionally will do a pull request *from* the master branch into the feature branch.  In these cases we have sometimes observed that the DVCS auto-transition incorrectly transitions \"in progress\" issues that were noted in commits on *master* (and that we're previously merged in via PR, but still have additional work or merges in order to complete, hence they are still \"in progress\") to review, as well as any issue keys for commits on the feature branch, including from merge commits from master.\r\n\r\nAt the very least, it would be nice if in this scenario, the issue keys in the merge commits were ignored rather than auto transitioning all issues as it has caused some confusion among our developers.\r\n\r\nSome more specifics on what we observed can be found in [this service desk case|https://support.atlassian.com/servicedesk/customer/portal/23/JST-117861]\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you have any questions or need more clarification about what we're looking for.\r\n\r\nThanks!",
