[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFCLOUD-7316].\n  {panel}\n\nMacros that implement org.radeox.macro.Macro get wrapped by a com.atlassian.renderer.macro.RadeoxCompatibilityMacro at runtime. This compatibility wrapper sets an attachment path in the render context which, once set, becomes fixed for the entire page render. Our embedded image renderer checks this context path and uses it without question once a value has been set. As the compatibility macro sets the path to be the attachment path for the current page, it breaks embedded images from other pages. In essence any macro that implements org.radeox.macro.Macro will break images embedded from other pages.\r\n\r\nWe don't want to \"fix\" this behaviour as doing so would affect all macros that implement this interface and we would recommend that macros now implement the com.atlassian.renderer.v2.macro.Macro interface instead.\r\n\r\nIn light of this we should migrate the macros that confluence ships with to use the new interface as well.",

This is fine for a standalone client code/script, but if you want to make use of xml-rpc in a php served web page that just needs to check that you are logged in, and pull back your username, there is no way to access the token. The login token should be available via the seraph.confluence cookie.  Also, it would be great if this cookie had a configurable path/realm so that you can choose to expose it to the rest of your site.\r\n\r\ne.g. If I have a site as  http://mywebspace/. and confluence is setup as  http://mywebspace/wiki/  then the cookie will only be pathed to /wiki and not /\r\n\r\nThere appears to be no ability to configu to expose the confluence user session cookie data to a larger cookie realm. This would be nice as it would allow for development off a single-sign-on environment where the core of that SSO is confluence's existing session management.\r\n\r\nIn the past there was a bug fix to restrict the cookie path to the context path of confluence to ensure that the cookies don't colide with JIRA and other Seraph authenticating web applications. This was a good fix, but it's ultimatly removed the ability to pass the cookie to a PHP coded page, that could decode the cookie, get the authentication token, and use that via the XML-RPC or Soap Remote API to perform tasks knowing the use it logged in.\r\n\r\nThere are plenty of examples on writting my own single sign on code, but why go to that effort when the framwork is in place within confluence itself, I just need to be able to talk to it.\r\n\r\nI'd like to see the authentication token, stored into the cookie, to be able to configure the cookie to default to the context path, but allow for this to be set as '/'. \r\n\r\nUnless there is a way to configure this, but it's just buried somewhere in the config files. I haven't had much success finding it as yet.\r\n\r\nAny ideas, could the previous bug fixes be modified to make it a little more admin-configurable?\r\n",

Activities include last login, inactivity, successful and unsuccessful log-in actions and attempts. \r\nFor user account activity we want to be able to track this user login information from an administrative console, account, log file or application so the response \"Last login is already recorded. A user can view their last login date by going to their user preferences page\" is not what we are looking for. \r\n\r\n2) How can we track and log authenticated HTTP access requests? Since Confluence does not use HTTP BASIC authentication there is no record in the access log of what authenticated user is associated with an individual HTTP request.   For logging in general we need an understanding of all the logging options for Confluence which can produce log records. \r\n\r\n3) How can we lock out users after three unsuccessful login attempts (i.e. brute force attack)? \r\n\r\n4) How can we apply password policy controls (expiration, minimum length, re-use,...)? \r\n\r\nFor life cycle management, I have included two examples in which meta-tags were used. \r\n  \r\nExample 1 - what we used for the policy driven lifecycle meta-tags in HTML pages \r\n\r\n  <meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=iso-8859-1\"> \r\n   <meta name=\"title\" content=\"Apache Web Server\"> \r\n   <meta name=\"description\" content=\"Apache Web Server\"> \r\n   <meta name=\"creator\" content=\"John P.

Such 'island' pages (isolated wiki pages with no visibility into the space beyond/no birds-eye view on the wiki) can be shared within a team/community/group of users (by sharing the URL) without having to share the whole space with everyone at once/the same time (unlike personal space pages).  Rely on word-of-mouth interlinking to other pages in the space, for making pages accessible from each other only within some kind of context (vs. cold search results).  \r\n\r\nBenefits:\r\n- Allows topics to emerge on one or more related pages ('islands') before moving out of the incubator into a relevant \"traditional\" (and searchable) team space.\r\n- Encourages interlinking between pages which are related (results in better inter-page browseability and provides more metadata for search relevance and \"related pages\" functionality - once the content moves to a searchable space).\r\n- Encourages using red (undefined) links to first map out future related/children pages (i.e. top-down mental process).\r\n- Allows unrelated pages to remain invisible to each other within the same space, in turn allowing to share a page (and those it links to) without necessarily sharing the whole space.  This can also reduce the overall number of spaces required.\r\n\r\nOf course Space admins would still have god-like browse and search access to everything, and 'Browse & Search' would be ON by default to keep current standard behavior.\r\n\r\nI know it sounds contrary to wiki philosophy to wish to restrict page browsing (i.e. content discovery) but as mentioned above, it can make sense in some cases.\r\n\r\nNote: Comparable functionality is available in Picasa Web albums: one can elect to make a photo gallery public (visible on the user's public gallery index page) or private (gallery still publicly accessible without logging in, but URL obfuscated so it's hard to guess and virtually impossible to randomly discover).  The key is obscurity (content hard to find unless you've received a link to it), not restriction (i.e. read/write permissioning unaffected).",

I'm sorry we haven't provided you with an update in such a long time.\r\n\r\n\r\n We understand that for many of you, there is a close correlation between author and page ownership. With that in mind, we unfortunately don\u2019t see ourselves working on this issue within the near future, but do have a several workarounds for the issues you\u2019ve described:\r\n\r\n\r\n 1. Displaying a page owner - we recommend using an info macro or table labelled \u201cpage owner\u201d and tagging the relevant user. For more complex applications, Comala Workflows offers alternative solutions.\r\n 2. Deleting a previous employee's account (which is tied to existing pages) - we do not recommend you delete users from Confluence, as that would complicate your database (e.g. deletion of the user\u2019s previous comments) but you can[ deactivate previous user accounts|https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/delete-or-disable-users-138318.html] for security purposes and still keep track of the pages they\u2019ve worked on. Deactivating a user ensures they no longer count towards your license tier.\r\n 3. Redirecting notifications to the page owner - notifications are handled through watching the page. If you no longer want to receive notifications, you can unwatch the page and have the new page owner start watching it to receive the relevant notifications.\r\n 4. Finally, you can also change a page creator through the database. We recommend retaining an instance of your previous DB and doing this with a DBA present.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe\u2019ll be revisiting this suggestion in around a year, and reconsidering the request.\r\n\r\n\r\n Best,\r\n Jenny Millman | Product Manager, Confluence Server\r\n{panel}",
