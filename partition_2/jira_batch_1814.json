[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFCLOUD-19054].\n  {panel}\n\nTo improve Confluence's search, please provide an option to resolve all {include} and {excerpt-include} macro content before Confluence indexes whole page content.\r\n\r\nh4. Problem\r\n\r\nWhen Confluence indexes page content for searches, it doesn't resolve the content of these inclusions into the page first. Hence, when the user attempts to search for a page based on a term that's actually part of an inclusion's content, then the page that 'hosts' the inclusion will not show up in the search results.\r\n\r\nAs far as the user is concerned, those terms _are_ on the page when they view it. It's not until the user looks at the page's Wiki Markup when they'll realise that the content is only being referenced via an inclusion macro (and why the search didn't retrieve the 'host' page).\r\n\r\nIt's often more useful to see _the names/titles_ of these 'host' pages in search results, rather than those of the actual 'inclusion pages' themselves, since 'inclusion pages' (and titles) are typically out of context.\r\n\r\nh4. Solution\r\n\r\nTo improve Confluence's search efficacy, Confluence could provide an admin console option to makes it resolve the content of all \\{include\\} and \\{excerpt-include\\} macros first, before it indexes the whole page content.\r\n\r\nIf Confluence could resolve all inclusions before indexing whole page content, this will provide the following benefits:\r\n* If a user searches for text contained within \\{include\\} or \\{excerpt-include\\} macros, the names (and links) of pages that include this content will appear in the search results, rather than just the 'inclusion pages' further down the list of search results.\r\n\\\\ \\\\\r\n* If a space uses the new 'Documentation Theme' and a user searches for text contained within \\{include\\} or \\{excerpt-include\\} macros using the search box in the TOC column (for example, any one of our product documentation spaces on [CAC|http://confluence.atlassian.com/]), the pages that include this content will appear in the search results, rather than not at all.\r\n\\\\ \\\\\r\n*Why would these searches show no results?*\r\n\\\\ \\\\\r\nThe Documentation Theme requires a 'root page' within the space (from which the TOC is generated) to be set. When you start viewing pages within the space, the search box in the TOC column (by design) will only search pages contained within the 'root page' hierarchy. 'Inclusion pages', however, are typically kept outside this hierarchy to prevent them appearing in the TOC. Hence, if you use this Documentation Theme search box to look for terms contained within an 'inclusion page', you're likely to get no results.",

For now, I've disabled it by disabling the Activity Stream Plugin--we have over 1000 users, and it isn't acceptable for our server to be jammed up for a minute every time someone loads this gadget.\r\n\r\nI looked on your website for some inforamtion, and found none.  It looks like anything that was there was removed  (google reports a link to the plugins.atlassian.com, but searching for the plugin there turns up nothing).  The web link from the plugin repository similarly leads to a dead end.  Searching on your doc site turns up a description of the gadget, but nothing else.\r\n\r\nThis is an important gadget (for Jira dashboards), and we'd like to be able to use it.  I'm told that the initial release of the Jira activity stream gadget had a similar problem that was soon fixed.  Can the same fix be applied for Confluence?  Can we get information on the plans for this feature?",

Possible Cause and Resolution\r\n\r\nFrom some previous support cases, we found that this error can occur when Confluence's web.xml is out of date. So if you have updated the web.xml and just copied that file when you upgraded to 3.2 you will see this problem. Essentially, the following entry must exist in web.xml:\r\n\r\n{code:xml}\r\n<filter-mapping>\r\n    <filter-name>servletcontextthreadlocal</filter-name>\r\n    <url-pattern>/rest/*</url-pattern>\r\n</filter-mapping>\r\n{code}",

But this functionality seems to be lost with online storage solutions such as confluence and teamspace. As Simon was explaining the other day, this stems from the fact that an Endnote library is a collection of many files.\r\n\r\nThere is a version of Endnote called 'Endnote WEB' that seems to be set up to provide online file sharing, but one key feature that is lost in this version is the PDF file attachments. (I'm not sure if this is for copyright reasons)\r\n\r\nSo in a ideal world, we would like to be able to drag and drop a fully functional endnote library onto a online shared drive, enabling all members to access, add to and download PDF references from this resource.\"\r\n\r\nFrom my interpretation from the above (which was composed by the end-users), users could edit and attach files to a standard Confluence page which could then be exported (both the references and attachments) in an EndNote-readable format. This would operate similarly to the current \"PDF Export\" option, etc.\r\n{quote}",

Your instance is capable of generating automatic support requests that include your log files, environment information and more. This information helps the support team give you a quicker and more effective response.\r\n\r\nThis feature can be found in your Administration Console. For more information please see the directions for [Raising a Support Request|http://confluence.atlassian.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=12#TroubleshootingProblems%26RequestingTechnicalSupport-RaisingaSupportRequest].\r\n\r\nPlease consider using this feature if possible rather than manually creating the issue here.\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nIf you then visit your Confluence's Support Utility section under the Admin Console, the directions for raising an issue are as follows:\r\n{quote}*Support Utility*\r\nIf you are having a problem and need to contact support, please:\r\n1) Create a support request at http://support.atlassian.com\r\n2) Turn on debugging at Logging and Profiling\r\n3) Reproduce the issue\r\n4) Create a support zip (below) and attach the support zip to the case.\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nThen further down, this:\r\n{quote}\r\n*Raise Support Request*\r\nIf you cannot download the support zip and upload it to the support case, or cannot create a support case at http://support.atlassian.com, you may prefer to create a support request via the confluence administration. However, please note that this should only be done if you cannot create a support request or download the support zip (created above), as your mail server may not forward the message properly or in a timely manner, thus making the process more error prone than manually attaching the support zip to the case.\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nAlso, if you click the link for raising issues in the initial popup on SAC, you get this recommendation:\r\n{quote}\r\n* (Recommended) Raise a support ticket directly via our support site on the Internet and then create a support zip using the Support Utility below. The advantage of this method is that it includes all the relevant files confluence support need. You can also be sure that the support case has been created and includes your logs.\r\n* Complete the support request form via your Confluence Administration Console. The disadvantage of this method is that your mail may not be forwarded correctly due to restrictions imposed by your mail server. For example, the zip of your log files might be too large for your mail server to forward them on.\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nWe recommend one thing on SAC, and another in Confluence and in the docs.  One consistent recommendation should be represented and the other noted as an alternative.  Due to the possibility of send mail issues mentioned in Confluence's Support utility page, it is probable better to remove the popup from SAC and sticking with the manual generation as the preferred step.",
