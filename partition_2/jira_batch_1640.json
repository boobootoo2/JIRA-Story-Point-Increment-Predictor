I have a status board showing pie charts of various aspects of a broad effort. Filtering on the total effort, or one of the two aspects results in three separate pie charts where the colors map to different statuses! This makes the pages significantly less easy to interpret. \r\n\r\nThe current implementation appears to assign colors based upon the magnitude of various aspects of the project, which might be fine for filtering on other things, but on status it makes multiple pie charts on the same page difficult. A fix for this would be to assign colors based upon the order the statuses are enumerated... in such a way the statuses wouldn't change from one chart to the next, and you could again interpret the charts as \"too much blue\" or \"all green means everything is closed\", etc.\r\n\r\nSome examples follow.\r\n\r\n*Total work effort:*\r\n!image-2016-05-06-08-02-18-756.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\n*One of the two aspects:*\r\n !image-2016-05-06-08-03-24-197.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\n*The other aspect:*\r\n !image-2016-05-06-08-03-48-096.png|thumbnail!

I am going to try the workaround recommended in the bug, but would love to see the 'Export to Word' function working seamlessly - OR - remove the menu choice.\r\n\r\nWe moved to Scroll PDF exporter, and that plug-in has been helpful for PDF. Perhaps this feature should require a configurable plug-in as well?\r\n\r\nIf you want to contact me to discuss further, I would be open to that.\r\n\r\nSteve Abel\r\nsteve.abel@twcable.com\r\nSenior Technical Writer (and on our team of Atlassian Administrators)\r\nTime Warner Cable",

This would be especially beneficial for large files, with Git LFS that was recently introduced.\r\n\r\nThrough branch permissions and application links, permissions could be managed as well and many of the problems that currently exist in attachment handling in Confluence would be solved by this.\r\n\r\nFile versioning would also be solved by the basic concepts of SCM.\r\nh5. Possible implementation\r\n\r\nThere could be a\u00a0Bitbucket project per Confluence instance, creating a repository for each space. Branch permissions could be used to maintain permissions outside of Confluence as well, but alternatively the project/repository could be limited to the integration only.\u00a0",

Any help would be much appreciated.\r\n\r\n*Issue:* I have a couple of epics and some stories associated with each of them in JIRA. When I created a wiki page in Confluence, I inserted some issues from JIRA using \"JIRA Issue/Filter\" built-in macro to display all the Epics and their respective stories in a table. \r\nWhile all the other attributes appear correctly +I am not able to get to display, the names of the Epics in the table+. I have included +Epic Name+ and +Epic Link+ both the columns, but Epic Name column in the table is empty, while Epic Link just populates the JIRA Id of the Epic in question.\r\n\r\n*Ultimately, I need to display Epic Names in the table and not their ids.* Please suggest how this could be fixed.\r\n\r\n+*Also, for your reference, please find the screen shot attached with the ticket*+\r\n\r\nh3.Update\r\n\r\nThis issue seems to also affect other fields like Version. When user generates a report; instead of showing the version number; it shows the version ID instead.\r\n\r\nFor example. \r\n\r\n{code}\r\njira=> select * from projectversion where id = 17718;\r\n  id   | project | vname | description | sequence | released | archived | url | releasedate | startdate \r\n-------+---------+-------+-------------+----------+----------+----------+-----+-------------+-----------\r\n 17718 |   11200 | 1.9   |             |       10 |          |          |     |             | \r\n(1 row)\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nWhen a report is generated; instead of showing version 1.9 for an issue in a report; it shows 17718 instead.

The blue part is not rendered and due to the font colour being white, it's not visible in the email.\r\n\r\nYou can generate this problem by either sending an invitation to an Lotus Notes user or a password reset request.\r\n\r\nI understand, that Lotus Notes is not officially supported by Atlassian, however as a administrator, I do not necessarily have the control over my clients email applications, i.e. I do not know what they use or it's not my decision. Basically, if I send out invitations, I do not know if the email is readable or not.\r\n\r\nOne easy solution to this could be to just send an link without any style applied. Could be implemented as an option for customers who face this problem.",

      "description": "The following are the issues that users are facing after inserting the ppt file in a page\r\n1) Numbered lists\r\nNumbered lists in powerpoint appear as bullets and in few slides bullets gone missing when embedded in the page.\r\n2) Font Resizing\r\nFont size is enlarged from original. This causes text to appear in a different location when compared to say a background template image and can cause text to wrap onto multiple lines, when it originally displays within the same line. The text wrapping contributes to the phenomenon where lines of text are cut off and not displayed when the presentation is embedded in the page.\r\n3) Graphic related issues - 3D pictures are not being displayed properly.\r\n4) Colours of diagrams/figures are being changed. \r\nYou can refer the attached ppt in which everything has been explained clearly and also attached the original ppt to reproduce the issue.\r\n\r\n1) Name of the attachment which describes the issue: ExamplesOfIncorrectDisplayPPTpreview.pptx\r\n\r\n2) Name of the attachment to reproduce the issue: CollaborationStrategy2015.pptx",

After having moved quite a lot of items, I found out I couldn't open the attachments that where attached to the moved items!

In some cases, the new paragraph is also bold.\r\n* In the case where the new paragraph _is_ bold, insert a bulleted list with the keyboard (Shift+Cmd+B)\r\n\r\nExpected behaviour:\r\n* New bulleted list appears. Doesn't really matter if the content is bold or not.\r\n\r\nActual behaviour:\r\n* It is not possible to position the cursor in the new list, and cursor jumps down to the following text.\r\n\r\nThe markup created by the editor is {{<ul><li><strong></strong></li></ul>}}, with no content inside the {{<strong>}} tag. This seems to prevent cursor placement either with the mouse or keyboard.\r\n\r\nTo me this actually looks like two independent bugs:\r\n\r\n* inline formatting isn't cleared when hitting enter at the end of a paragraph in Safari\r\n* when creating a bullet list in an empty paragraph with inline formatting, the inline formatting in the li prevents cursor positioning.\r\n\r\nI could fix this locally by inserting a non-breaking space into the {{<strong>}} element with the inspector.\r\n",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFCLOUD-41519].\n  {panel}\n\nWe noticed today that a link, where the https:// was mistyped and was missing the final slash, got redirected as if it were a directory on the local web server, instead of just being a broken link.  Would it be better to leave it broken, or to repair the link, instead of prefixing the local server to it?\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Edit this page:  https://wiki.cac.washington.edu/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=72219641\r\n2. Insert a mistyped link:  http:/washington.edu/calendar/trumba\r\n3. Click Save\r\n4. Go visit your link and see where it goes.\r\n\r\nExpected:\r\n1. Link would be \"fixed\" and extra / would be added after the http:/ so the link would go to its intended destination\r\nor\r\n2. Link would go to broken link that I typed in\r\nor\r\n3. I would have been notified after step 2 (or possibly after step 3) that I entered an invalid link\r\n\r\nActual:\r\nhttps://wiki.cac.washington.edu/ is affixed to the beginning of my link making it:\r\nhttps://wiki.cac.washington.edu/https:/washington.edu/calendar/trumba\r\nI can understand why the software thought that the \"https:/\" could have been a directory, but this has been confusing for some of our users.\r\n",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFCLOUD-41502].\n  {panel}\n\nI want to add my voice to the many others who have expressed a desire to have more fine-grained control over notifications on a per-space (and perhaps per-page too).  This is to support the situation when a private space is set up to contain sensitive information (passwords, private keys, etc.) and we don't want page edits to trigger email containing the sensitive information (as that will open up many more ways in which that info can be sniffed or hacked by 3rd parties).\r\n\r\nThe ideal solution will implement the same Notification Scheme setup available in JIRA (where each JIRA project can be assigned its own notification scheme... similar, each Confluence space should have the ability to be assigned its own notification scheme also.\r\n\r\nMany others have asked for this before:\r\nCONF-174\r\nCONF-29996\r\nCONF-27567\r\nCONF-28326\r\nCONF-30826\r\nCONF-33698\r\nCONF-35985\r\nCONF-41394\r\nCONF-33887\r\n\r\nI think this is a basic/fundamental functionality for a wiki software designed to support multiple spaces with different access rights.\r\n\r\nThank you.",

      "description": "I have confluence and jira installed on a server, with connectors set for http and ssl through proxy, and I have an apache server acting as the proxy sending my requests to the appropriate software. Linking the two in this configuration is difficult, but I've got it working for jira by setting the application link as http://localhost:8091/confluence (the http port). When it redirects me to confluence it can't automatically make the link in the opposite direction, but I can form a working link by pointing confluence at http://localhost:9114/jira. The problem comes from confluence's jira integration. Linking a single issue from jira works, but the created jira widget uses the http://localhost:9114/jira address to try to access an image. This causes confluence pages with single jira issue widgets to be marked as insecure, and of course the image will not load because the local user does not have the image file accessible. Can this please be fixed?",
