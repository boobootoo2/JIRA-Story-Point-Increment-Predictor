Often, due to the way that the gallery shows three columns almost perfectly in the default theme, it's not clear that there is a fourth column at all, unless one scrolls down the entire gallery and notices the horizontal scroll bar at the bottom. As a result, employees sometimes miss an entire column of images.\r\n\r\nWould it be feasible to move the scroll bar to the top of the gallery when there are too many columns to display onscreen? This would be a quick and easy visual indicator that the employee will need to scroll to see the full gallery.\r\n\r\nThanks for considering it,\r\nJoe",

The directory may be read-only.\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nThe _active_ column in _cwd_user_ table (Embedded Crowd cache) indicates if a user is disabled as _F_(alse). If a user is disabled, he is not counted towards the license since he is not able to use Confluence. Currently, this property is not synchronised back to the LDAP directory (e.g. in form of a custom attribute). \r\n\r\n[CWD-995|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CWD-995] is going to change this behaviour for Active Directory connectors, meaning that disabling a user would synchronise back to the [User-Account-Control|http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms680832(v=vs.85).aspx] attribute. Once this is implemented, we will be working on getting it shipped in Confluence.\r\n\r\nIn order to currently disable a user which is sourced from a read-only LDAP directory, one must remove the user from the groups granting him use permission (e.g. _confluence-users_) or configure the directory with _Read Only, with Local Groups_ and only assign use permission to those local groups. \r\n\r\nThis issue tracks a possible feature allowing disabling users which are sourced from an LDAP directory configured as read-only from within Confluence. Before voting on it, please make sure you've read [Connecting to an LDAP Directory|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Connecting+to+an+LDAP+Directory#ConnectingtoanLDAPDirectory-AddingUserstoGroupsAutomatically] and have considered alternative solutions.
