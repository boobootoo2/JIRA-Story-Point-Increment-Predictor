      "description": "Raised by Sarah:\r\n\r\n\r\nIt would be very useful, and I think very simple, to have a configurable big bold warning when a page has restricted viewing. The administrator, or space administrator, should be able to turn this feature on/off.\r\n\r\nUse case:\r\n\r\n    * At Atlassian, we create draft pages to document a forthcoming release. We hide them from the general public using page restrictions. But we allow Atlassian staff to see them, because they are useful in all sorts of ways. (Blitz testing, preview of forthcoming release, other people need to review new content, etc).\r\n    * However, these hidden drafts can cause confusion because the support staff or pre-sales, or just about anyone, may not notice that the page is restricted and may give incorrect information to a customer or may send out a link which other people cannot view.\r\n    * To prevent the above possible confusion, we add a big red note at the top of the draft page, or we add something like \"(hidden draft)\" in the title of the page.\r\n    * As a result, on launch day we cannot simply remove the page restrictions via the Admin screen. Instead, we have to edit each and every single page.\r\n\r\nIf we could display an automatic warning that a page is restricted to the \"Atlassian-staff\" group or whatever, that would greatly improve things.\r\n\r\nProbably there are at least some of our customers in the same boat.\r\n",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFCLOUD-12729].\n  {panel}\n\nThe show-stopping nature of many legacy plugins needs to be emphasized in confluence documentation - downloaders are currently led to believe that the plugin issues are limited only to the odd potential failure of a legacy macro to work properly.\r\nBefore upgrading users must first review every single plugin in the Plugin Repository *in the previous version* to verify continued Atlassian support, and *purge all unsupported plugins from the previous installation before even attempting to upgrade*. Otherwise unsupported - and probably unnoticed and unwanted - legacy plugins *persisted in the external database* will prevent would-be migrators from even reaching first screen in confluence - unless outdated plugins have been fully purged. The new 2.9 release of Confluence will not even start.\r\n\r\nThis is not documented clearly in [our upgrade docs | http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Upgrading+Confluence+Standalone+Edition#UpgradingConfluenceStandaloneEdition-ReapplyingCustomisationstoyourNewConfluence]\r\n{quote}If you were previously using any plugins, install the latest compatible version and disable any plugins that are incompatible with your new version of Confluence.

Possibly a 'lock' icon in the title. I would like to be able to mouse over and get an idea of what those restrictions are. Why?\r\n\r\n    * Because I find myself forgetting to open up pages after they're ready. I need to check for restrictions before I send a link or, if I forget, I get an email from the person saying they need to be given permission. That adds up.\r\n\r\n    * Also, if a page has sensitive information, I find myself putting '(restricted)' in the title so that I remember that a page has sensitive information\r\n\r\nAlso, here is optimisation of something I do frequently: I find myself often emailing links to people, asking them to subscribe. I would like to have a form that pops up the email with a complete TO and CC field, where I use the user/group picker to select from users who have permission to view the page. The message body should be rendered HTML like on a page watch. Also I would also optionally like to be able to add them as page watchers.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Tests with the \"luke\" tool do confirm major issues. Due to this, we had to set the indexing language to \"OTHER\", because then confluence will not use the GermanAnalyzer() but the  SIMPLE_ANALYZER (see ConfluenceAnalyzer.java). \r\n\r\nBug:\r\nAfter setting the indexing language to \"other\" searches for words with \"umlauts\" (eg. Geb\u00e4ude) will work when used in the left panel, but will not work when used in the dosearchsite.action result-page! The difference between these to searches is according to the HTML-Code is the *method* (GET/POST) used. \r\n\r\nWorkaround:\r\nWe have edited the file apache-tomcat/confluence/confluence/search/searchpanel.vm and replaced the method \"GET\" with \"POST\".\r\nThis works probably because the url-encoding of the form parameters (when GET is used), seems not work correctly. I would assume\r\nyour url-encoding or url-decoding is not 8bit safe! Please check your code.\r\n\r\nRegards\r\nTobias\r\n",

The problem we face is that all of this goes to waste when we need to upgrade the application, because in order to do that we need to shut down the entire cluster.\r\n\r\nThis is becoming more and more unacceptable as our user base grows because a 5-10min outage often translates to thousands of missed page views.\r\n\r\nI understand that sometimes it is not (easily) possible to deliver this feature - mainly in cases when the new version of the application depends on a database schema, which is incompatible with the previous version.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, changes like this don't happen very often and in many cases database schema changes often don't break the previous application (the old application just can't take advantage of the new schema features because it is not aware of them).\r\n\r\nWhat I suggest is to allow cluster upgrades without the requirement to shut down the cluster whenever possible. IMO this means most of the time if the version of the application used in the cluster is not very outdated.\r\n\r\nI realize that this will most likely require someone to watch schema changes or other changes that would make \"hot\" cluster upgrade impossible (incompatibilities in the serialized objects, coherence upgrades, etc), but it shouldn't be too difficult for anyone who is heavily involved in the Confluence development.\r\n\r\nHigh availability is not an optional feature for Enterprise applications, so please consider this request and make necessary changes to the application as well as to the development/release processes to make Confluence more Enterprise friendly.",

I realize that this means it was therefore not a valid plugin, but Confluence should have recognized this and refused to enable it when it was uploaded.  It did not.  It enabled the plugin.  This caused the Plugin Repository to fail with a JavaScript error (on Firefox, it's reported as \"this.installed.pluginInformation has no properties\", on other platforms it manifests itself as a random null value error).   Additionally, attempting to disable the plugin via the \"Plugins\" console resulted in a java.lang.NullPointerException, presumably again due to the missing <plugin-info> section.\r\n\r\nAgain, I realize this was due to an incorrectly written plugin, but it would be best if Confluence could sanity-check the atlassian-plugin.xml file and refuse to enable the plugin if any essential metadata is missing.\r\n\r\nIt seems that the <plugin-info> section only needs to be present to avoid this error.  Even if the section contains no content (ie: no <version>, no <description>, no <vendor>) the repository will work as long as the section is there.  \r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n\r\n1) Create a plugin which has an atlassian-plugin.xml as follows:\r\n\r\n{code}\r\n<atlassian-plugin name=\"This Plugin Will Break\" key=\"com.example.bogusPlugin\">\r\n\r\n</atlassian-plugin>\r\n{code}\r\n\r\n2) Create a .jar which contains this file.\r\n\r\n3) Upload the .jar via the \"Plugins\" page of the admin console (not the \"Plugin Repository\" page)\r\n\r\n4) Confirm that confluence installed and enabled the plugin\r\n\r\n5) View the \"Plugin Repository\" page.\r\n\r\n6) Receive the JavaScript error.\r\n\r\n",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFCLOUD-12663].\n  {panel}\n\nI have had a discussion with some colleagues who currently use [Twiki|http://www.twiki.org] and are evaluating Confluence.  Currently pages cannot be 'frozen' to prevent future modification.  \r\n\r\nScenario:  a monthly status page contains dynamically generated information from other sources.  eg a jira issue list.   After 6 months we want to see the first report, but it is executing the jiraissues list again and shows _current_ data.\r\n\r\nI use the _jiraissues_ macro as an example, but any dynamically retrieved value (eg metadata, SQL etc) could equally be used.  I wonder how hard it would be to for example 'save' the post-rendered page content that could be retrieved and rendered 'as was' rather than 'as is'.  \r\n\r\nSuch 'frozen pages' could be available in a similar way to page revisions.\r\n\r\nTinylink support could could also be extended to support not only 'frozen pages' but also revisions, allowing 'permanent tinylinks to always resolve given content at a point in time.",

In the private space, link to a page in the public page.\r\n3. On the public page, add an attachment.\r\n4. Whenever a new version of the same file is uploaded, the user uploading the file is listed as having modified not only the public page, but also the page in the private space linking to the public page.\r\n\r\nWith Confluence 2.5.7, deleting or adding attachments or editing the public page does not have an effect on the page in the private space. I think this is the expected behaviour.\r\nWith Confluence 2.8 it is even worse: modifying the page text, modifying or adding an attachment (but not deleting an attachment) lists the user as someone who has tampered with the private page.\r\n\r\nI have marked this bug as critical because users may think that Confluence's permission system is broken which would be a big problem for Atlassian, at least PR-wise.",
