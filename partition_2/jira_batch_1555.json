      "description": "h3. Problem Definition\r\n\r\nSpace admins are giving other individual users admin privileges within spaces they control. \r\n Permissions in this environment are managed using an automated tool (AGS) and it is not desired to grant permissions to individual users on the root of the space without approval or potentially at all.\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nThe desired outcome is to allow the Global admin to restrict a Space admin's ability to grant the \"admin\" privilege of a space to individual users while still allowing the space admin to grant other permissions to individual users.\u00a0\r\n Stated differently, the desired ability is for the Global admin to remove the \"admin\" privilege as an option for Space admin's to select. The Global admin would be the only one who can grant admin privilege at the space-level\u00a0\r\nh3. Why this is important\r\n\r\nGlobal admins should have the ability to determine who can fill a space admin role, as individual space admins potentially give this right to users that should not have it.\r\n The unauthorized admins then have rights not controlled via automation.\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nAs a workaround, the Confluence administrator can hide the UI elements that are used to assign/remove the Space Admin permissions in the Space Tools page.\r\n Note that this will not remove the functionality, but just hide the element so that users can't see these and, therefore, change its value.\r\n The elements will be hidden from all users, also applying to Confluence administrators.\r\n # Go to *Cog icon* > *General configuration* > *Stylesheet* to open the [_Global Stylesheet_|https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/styling-confluence-with-css-166528400.html] admin page.\r\n # Click on the _Edit_ button, add the code below and then _Save_ it.\r\n ** You may use any combination of the following options to hide one or multiple elements.\r\n{code:java}\r\n/* Hide the checkbox of space admin permissions related to groups */\r\n.permissions.aui input[name^=confluence_checkbox_setspacepermissions_group]  \r\n{    \r\n  visibility:hidden !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\n/* Hide the checkbox of space admin permissions related to users */\r\n.permissions.aui input[name^=confluence_checkbox_setspacepermissions_user]  \r\n{    \r\n  visibility:hidden !important;    \r\n}\r\n\r\n/* Hide the checkbox of space admin permissions related to anonymous users */\r\n.permissions.aui input[name^=confluence_checkbox_setspacepermissions_anonymous]  \r\n{    \r\n  visibility:hidden !important;    \r\n}\r\n\r\n/* Hide the button to check and uncheck all options in the permissions row */\r\n.permissions.aui button.aui-button.aui-button-text.row-selector\r\n{\r\n\tvisibility:hidden !important;\r\n}\r\n{code}\r\n\r\n(!)

      "description": "h2. Problem Summary\r\n\r\nPerformance bottlenecks can be triggered by Label related queries on large Confluence instances.\r\nh2. Problem Details\r\n\r\nConfluence provides users with a handful of Label related macros. These macros can be used to find the most popular labels in a space, find recently used macros, to get a comprehensive report of pages that have specific labels and so goes on.\r\n\r\nThe main action behind such functionalities consists of the application going to the database to retrieve a list of labels based on the input provided by the macros. This is exactly where the problem happens, given the nature of the queries. Symptoms observed have been:\r\n * Overall application slowness.\r\n * Increased response time on the database size due to what seems to be a huge amount of data returned by the Label queries.\r\n * Stuck threads waiting to interact with the database - This happens because the Label related threads make the database busy.\r\n * Need to restart the application to make it usable once again.\r\n\r\nh4. Thread Dumps\r\n\r\nThread Dumps generated during situations like the above mentioned one show the application stuck for long time executing an Hibernate Statement in the database. The statement comes from the _findMostPopular_ method:\r\n{code:java}\r\n\"http-nio2-8443-exec-277\" #512 daemon prio=5 os_prio=0 tid=0x00007f354c055800 nid=0x389c runnable [0x00007f323d893000]\r\n   java.lang.Thread.State: RUNNABLE\r\n\tat java.net.SocketInputStream.socketRead0(Native Method)\r\n\tat java.net.SocketInputStream.socketRead(SocketInputStream.java:116)\r\n\tat java.net.SocketInputStream.read(SocketInputStream.java:171)\r\n\tat java.net.SocketInputStream.read(SocketInputStream.java:141)\r\n\tat sun.security.ssl.InputRecord.readFully(InputRecord.java:465)\r\n\tat sun.security.ssl.InputRecord.read(InputRecord.java:503)\r\n\tat sun.security.ssl.SSLSocketImpl.readRecord(SSLSocketImpl.java:983)\r\n\t- locked <0x00000005dc024f38> (a java.lang.Object)\r\n\tat sun.security.ssl.SSLSocketImpl.readDataRecord(SSLSocketImpl.java:940)\r\n\tat sun.security.ssl.AppInputStream.read(AppInputStream.java:105)\r\n\t- locked <0x00000005dc024ff8> (a sun.security.ssl.AppInputStream)\r\n\tat com.mysql.jdbc.MysqlIO.readFully(MysqlIO.java:3008)\r\n\tat com.mysql.jdbc.MysqlIO.reuseAndReadPacket(MysqlIO.java:3469)\r\n\tat com.mysql.jdbc.MysqlIO.reuseAndReadPacket(MysqlIO.java:3459)\r\n\tat com.mysql.jdbc.MysqlIO.checkErrorPacket(MysqlIO.java:3900)\r\n\tat com.mysql.jdbc.MysqlIO.sendCommand(MysqlIO.java:2527)\r\n\tat com.mysql.jdbc.MysqlIO.sqlQueryDirect(MysqlIO.java:2680)\r\n\tat com.mysql.jdbc.ConnectionImpl.execSQL(ConnectionImpl.java:2487)\r\n\t- locked <0x00000005dc025160> (a com.mysql.jdbc.JDBC4Connection)\r\n\tat com.mysql.jdbc.PreparedStatement.executeInternal(PreparedStatement.java:1858)\r\n\t- locked <0x00000005dc025160> (a com.mysql.jdbc.JDBC4Connection)\r\n\tat com.mysql.jdbc.PreparedStatement.executeQuery(PreparedStatement.java:1966)\r\n\t- locked <0x00000005dc025160> (a com.mysql.jdbc.JDBC4Connection)\r\n\tat com.mchange.v2.c3p0.impl.NewProxyPreparedStatement.executeQuery(NewProxyPreparedStatement.java:379)\r\n\tat net.sf.hibernate.impl.BatcherImpl.getResultSet(BatcherImpl.java:89)\r\n\tat net.sf.hibernate.loader.Loader.getResultSet(Loader.java:880)\r\n\tat net.sf.hibernate.loader.Loader.doQuery(Loader.java:273)\r\n\tat net.sf.hibernate.loader.Loader.doQueryAndInitializeNonLazyCollections(Loader.java:138)\r\n\tat net.sf.hibernate.loader.Loader.doList(Loader.java:1063)\r\n\tat net.sf.hibernate.loader.Loader.list(Loader.java:1054)\r\n\tat net.sf.hibernate.hql.QueryTranslator.list(QueryTranslator.java:854)\r\n\tat net.sf.hibernate.impl.SessionImpl.find(SessionImpl.java:1570)\r\n\tat net.sf.hibernate.impl.QueryImpl.list(QueryImpl.java:49)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.hibernate.HibernateObjectDao.lambda$findNamedQueryStringParams$5(HibernateObjectDao.java:432)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.hibernate.HibernateObjectDao$$Lambda$479/1754201883.doInHibernate(Unknown Source)\r\n\tat org.springframework.orm.hibernate.HibernateTemplate.execute(HibernateTemplate.java:370)\r\n\tat org.springframework.orm.hibernate.HibernateTemplate.executeFind(HibernateTemplate.java:341)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.hibernate.HibernateObjectDao.findNamedQueryStringParams(HibernateObjectDao.java:408)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.hibernate.HibernateObjectDao.findNamedQueryStringParam(HibernateObjectDao.java:308)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.confluence.labels.persistence.dao.hibernate.HibernateLabelDao.performNonMySqlMostPopular(HibernateLabelDao.java:352)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.confluence.labels.persistence.dao.hibernate.HibernateLabelDao.findMostPopular(HibernateLabelDao.java:345)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.confluence.labels.DefaultLabelManager.getMostPopularLabels(DefaultLabelManager.java:571)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.confluence.labels.CachingLabelManager.lambda$getMostPopularLabels$0(CachingLabelManager.java:219)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.confluence.labels.CachingLabelManager$$Lambda$1442/1161219258.apply(Unknown Source)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.confluence.internal.labels.MostPopularCache.valueWrapper(MostPopularCache.java:51)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.confluence.internal.labels.MostPopularCache.lambda$getMostPopularGlobal$0(MostPopularCache.java:39)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.confluence.internal.labels.MostPopularCache$$Lambda$1445/643250503.get(Unknown Source)\r\n{code}\r\nh4. Database Logs\r\n\r\nAs far as the database logging goes, there are queries that correlates with the above thread dump (they are triggered by _findMostPopular_ method) and that takes a long time to be executed - Usually something in between 5 to 10 minutes:\r\n{code:sql}\r\nSELECT *\r\n  FROM (  SELECT label1_.LABELID AS col_0_0_,\r\n                 CAST (COUNT (labelling0_.LABELID) AS NUMBER (10, 0))\r\n                    AS col_1_0_,\r\n                 label1_.LABELID AS LABELID1_43_,\r\n                 label1_.NAME AS NAME2_43_,\r\n                 label1_.OWNER AS OWNER3_43_,\r\n                 label1_.NAMESPACE AS NAMESPACE4_43_,\r\n                 label1_.CREATIONDATE AS CREATIONDATE5_43_,\r\n                 label1_.LASTMODDATE AS LASTMODDATE6_43_\r\n            FROM CONTENT_LABEL labelling0_, LABEL label1_, CONTENT contentent2_\r\n           WHERE     labelling0_.LABELID = label1_.LABELID\r\n                 AND labelling0_.CONTENTID = contentent2_.CONTENTID\r\n                 AND label1_.NAMESPACE = :1\r\n                 AND contentent2_.CONTENT_STATUS <> 'deleted'\r\n        GROUP BY label1_.LABELID,\r\n                 label1_.NAMESPACE,\r\n                 label1_.OWNER,\r\n                 label1_.NAME,\r\n                 label1_.LASTMODDATE,\r\n                 label1_.CREATIONDATE\r\n        ORDER BY CAST (COUNT (labelling0_.LABELID) AS NUMBER (10, 0)) DESC)\r\nWHERE ROWNUM <= :2\r\n{code}\r\nAnother example would be:\r\n{code:sql}\r\nselect labelling0_.ID as ID, labelling0_.LABELID as LABELID, labelling0_.CONTENTID as CONTENTID, labelling0_.PAGETEMPLATEID as PAGETEMP4_, labelling0_.OWNER as OWNER, labelling0_.CREATIONDATE as CREATION6_, labelling0_.LASTMODDATE as LASTMODD7_, labelling0_.LABELABLEID as LABELABL8_, labelling0_.LABELABLETYPE as LABELABL9_ from CONTENT_LABEL labelling0_, LABEL label1_, CONTENT contentent2_ where (labelling0_.LABELID=label1_.LABELID )and(label1_.NAMESPACE='global' )and(contentent2_.CONTENT_STATUS!='deleted'  and labelling0_.CONTENTID=contentent2_.CONTENTID) order by  labelling0_.LASTMODDATE\r\n{code}\r\nAlso, the following query represents yet another example:\r\n{code:sql}\r\nSELECT  *\r\nFROM\r\n        (\r\n                SELECT  labelling0_.ID             AS ID1_13_            ,\r\n                        labelling0_.LABELID        AS LABELID2_13_       ,\r\n                        labelling0_.CONTENTID      AS CONTENTID3_13_     ,\r\n                        labelling0_.PAGETEMPLATEID AS PAGETEMPLATEID4_13_,\r\n                        labelling0_.OWNER          AS OWNER5_13_         ,\r\n                        labelling0_.CREATIONDATE   AS CREATIONDATE6_13_  ,\r\n                        labelling0_.LASTMODDATE    AS LASTMODDATE7_13_   ,\r\n                        labelling0_.LABELABLEID    AS LABELABLEID8_13_   ,\r\n                        labelling0_.LABELABLETYPE  AS LABELABLETYPE9_13_\r\n                FROM    CONTENT_LABEL labelling0_,\r\n                        LABEL label1_            ,\r\n                        CONTENT contentent2_\r\n                WHERE   labelling0_.CONTENTID           =contentent2_.CONTENTID\r\n                        AND labelling0_.LABELID         =label1_.LABELID\r\n                        AND label1_.NAMESPACE           ='global'\r\n                        AND contentent2_.CONTENT_STATUS<>'deleted'\r\n                ORDER BY labelling0_.LASTMODDATE DESC\r\n        )\r\nWHERE   rownum <= :1\r\n{code}\r\nh2. Suggested Root Cause\r\n\r\nDepending on the size of the Content Table, above queries can be quite expensive and take a long time to run. To know the size of one's instance, run the following query:\r\n{code:sql}\r\nselect content_status, count(*) from content group by content_status;\r\n{code}\r\nTests show that instances with 15M entries in the Content table can take up to 90s to have the above queries returning results, regardless of indexes. Therefore, the problem is related to the scalability of the Label logic in Confluence.\r\nh2. Which action can trigger such queries?\r\n * Through a call to _/labels/autocompletelabel.action_ - This is a call to retrieve a list of labels to auto complete an user input when one is adding labels to a page. This call will only jeopardise the application health if there's no Contend ID in the URL - For example, when adding labels to an unpublished page where Content ID is still not referenced in the URL.\r\n * When using the _Popular Labels_ Macro without a Space Key defined on it:\r\n !Screen Shot 2019-05-15 at 17.53.32.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nh2. Workaround\r\n\r\nThere are a few things we can do to mitigate the impact of this problem:\r\n # To block calls to __/labels/autocompletelabel.action__ in a Proxy/Tomcat level. Downside is that auto-completion of labels won't work.\r\n # To enforce users to define a Space Key when adding the _Popular Labels_ Macro.\r\n\r\n*Extra:*\r\n In order to know which pages have the _Popular Labels_ Macro without a Space Key set to it, one can run the query below - It has been tested in PostgreSQL and there may be a need to tweak it a little bit for other database flavours:\r\n{code:sql}\r\nselect c.title, c.contentid, s.spacekey from content c, spaces s where contentid in (\r\nselect contentid from bodycontent where body like '%ac:name=\"popular-labels\"%' and body not ilike'%<ac:parameter ac:name=\"spaceKey\">%') \r\nand c.prevver is null and c.spaceid = s.spaceid;\r\n{code}\r\nWith the above list in hands, one can go to each page and edit the Macro to have a Space Key on it to workaround the performance issue.",

Problem Definition\r\nWhen disabling a Confluence App (aka plugin or add-on), Confluence will automatically disable any other App that has a strong dependency on the former (or a module of it) with no warning messag in the UI.\r\nFor example, when disabling _Confluence Jira Plugin_, _confluence-software-blueprints_ will be disabled because the latter has a strong dependency on the {{jqlHelper}} module of the former.\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\nBefore disabling an App, Confluence should check if any other has a dependency on it.\r\nIf there's any, then Confluence should advise that disabling _App A_ will cause _App B_ to be disabled.\r\n\r\nh3. Why this is important\r\nThere's no clear definition on Apps' dependency on the Confluence UI when administering Apps.\r\nThat means Confluence admin might take an action without knowing the full consequences of it.\r\n \r\nh3.

Issue Summary\r\nIn Confluence [Audit log|https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/audit-log-829076528.html] documentation it says that enabling or disabling Apps actions are recorded in the Audit log.\r\nWhen an App is automatically disabled, because of a dependency for example, this is not recorded in the audit log.\r\n\r\nh3. Environment\r\nThis was validated on Confluence Server *6.6.12* and *6.13.2*.\r\nThe test below uses  _Confluence Mobile App Plugin_ just as an example. This will affect other Apps as well.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Install a Confluence vanilla instance.\r\n# Make sure audit log is enabled (it is by default).\r\n# Disable _Confluence Mobile App Plugin_.\r\n# As a result, _Workbox - Host Plugin_ is also disabled.\r\n# Go to the _Audit log_ admin UI.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nThe following entries are logged:\r\n # Add-on disabled: Confluence Mobile Web Plugin.\r\n # Add-on disabled: Workbox - Host Plugin.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nOnly the action related to the App manually disabled is recorded -- in the example, _Confluence Mobile Web Plugin_.\r\nThere's no entry saying the _Workbox - Host Plugin_ was disabled as a result of this action.\r\n\r\nh3. Additional Notes\r\nIn addition to the example above, an event is not recorded in the audit logs when an App is automatically disabled because of any internal problem within Confluence (or the App itself).\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n_Currently there is no known workaround for this behavior. A workaround will be added here when available_",

If rpm is used to detect the package there is no problem.\r\n\r\n",

      "description": "h3. Issue Summary\r\nOn Confluence, when creating a new page comment it will notify page watchers about the added comment.\r\nIf the page has too many watchers (thousands), then adding the new comment may take a long time to complete.\r\nThis also occurs if you have few watchers (dozens) and nested groups is enabled and in use.\r\n\r\nh3. Environment\r\nThis was validated on Confluence Server 6.6.8, but might impact Data Center deployments and more recent versions.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Install a Confluence vanilla instance.\r\n# Add 5,000 users to this instance.\r\n# Create a sample page and add thousands of users as watchers to this page.\r\n #* For example, test it with 2k and 4k watchers.\r\n# Add a comment to the page.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nEven with a large number of watchers, adding a comment should instantly save the comment and release the UI to the users so they can continue to navigate on Confluence.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nIt may take several seconds to save the comment and release the UI to the user and, depending on the configuration, the operation will timeout, although it will still continue on the backend giving the perception to the user that it failed.\r\nDuring the tests, it took ~30s to save the comment with 2k watchers and ~150s with 4k.\r\n \r\nh3. Notes\r\nIf we take a thread dump while the operation is still running on the UI, the below stack trace may be captured:\r\n{code}\r\n\"http-nio-2667-exec-8\" #43 daemon prio=5 os_prio=31

You can find a sample query below:\r\n{code:java}\r\nSELECT DISTINCT\r\n    space1_.SPACEID       AS SPACEID1_59_,\r\n    space1_.SPACENAME     AS SPACENAM2_59_,\r\n    space1_.SPACEKEY      AS SPACEKEY3_59_,\r\n    space1_.LOWERSPACEKEY AS LOWERSPA4_59_,\r\n    space1_.SPACEDESCID   AS SPACEDES5_59_,\r\n    space1_.HOMEPAGE      AS HOMEPAGE6_59_,\r\n    space1_.CREATOR       AS CREATOR7_59_,\r\n    space1_.CREATIONDATE  AS CREATION8_59_,\r\n    space1_.LASTMODIFIER  AS LASTMODI9_59_,\r\n    space1_.LASTMODDATE   AS LASTMOD10_59_,\r\n    space1_.SPACETYPE     AS SPACETY11_59_,\r\n    space1_.SPACESTATUS   AS SPACEST12_59_\r\nFROM\r\n    SPACEPERMISSIONS spacepermi0_\r\nINNER JOIN\r\n    SPACES space1_\r\nON\r\n    spacepermi0_.SPACEID=space1_.SPACEID\r\nWHERE\r\n    (\r\n        spacepermi0_.PERMUSERNAME='user-key-1'\r\n    OR  spacepermi0_.PERMGROUPNAME IN ('group-1' ,\r\n                                       'group-2' ,\r\n                                       'group-3' ,\r\n                                       'group-4')\r\n    OR  spacepermi0_.PERMALLUSERSSUBJECT='authenticated-users'\r\n    OR  (\r\n            spacepermi0_.PERMUSERNAME IS NULL)\r\n    AND (\r\n            spacepermi0_.PERMGROUPNAME IS NULL)\r\n    AND (\r\n            spacepermi0_.PERMALLUSERSSUBJECT IS NULL))\r\nAND spacepermi0_.PERMTYPE='EDITSPACE'\r\nAND (\r\n        space1_.SPACESTATUS IN ('CURRENT'))\r\nORDER BY\r\n    space1_.SPACENAME,\r\n    space1_.SPACEKEY limit 1\r\n{code}\r\nThese permission queries don't scale well, especially in MySQL. Below you can find average query time for a dataset of about 6,000 spaces and 300,000 records in\u00a0SPACEPERMISSIONS table:\r\n||DBMS||Avg query time (ms)||\r\n|Postgres|40|\r\n|{color:#ff0000}MySQL{color}|{color:#ff0000}300{color}|\r\n|SQL Server|20|\r\n|Oracle|50|\r\n\r\nNot only expensive, the number of these queries is also unnecessary high. See below for count for each page type and type of Create buttons:\r\n||\u00a0||Dashboard||Page/Blogpost View||\r\n|*Quick Create*|2|0|\r\n|*Blueprint Create*|2|2|\r\n\r\nUnder very high load, these queries can put enormous pressure on DB and may even cause outages.\r\nh3. Root cause\r\n\r\nThe code to render Create buttons doesn't scale well because it involves too many queries which can be costly in big instances. This ticket aims to alleviate some problems in CONFSERVER-57535\u00a0while the proper fix is being considered.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nCurrently there is no known workaround for this behavior. A workaround will be added here when available\r\n \u00a0",
