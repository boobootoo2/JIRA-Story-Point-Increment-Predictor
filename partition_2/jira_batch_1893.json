[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFCLOUD-8246].\n  {panel}\n\nWe are starting to archive more email into Confluence, and suddenly hit upon an unfortunate limitation. Currently, you can add multiple pop accounts to a space, but there is no way to view the mail to each account separately. So the heavy flow accounts completely swamp all the others. The alternative which we've been using is to create a space per account, but we are starting to see that this doesn't scale very well.\r\n\r\nSome thoughts:\r\n* if more than one account is archived to a space, then the account name should be shown as a sortable column\r\n* if more than one account is shown, it would be good to have a summary page listing the accounts, where clicking on an account would show just its email\r\n* similarly when searching it should be possible to see which account the email was going to\r\n* I would also like to see the account name in the URL so that it is clearer what you are looking at\r\n\r\nIt would also help if the main mail page looked more like a page in the space:\r\n\r\ne.g.\r\n\r\nhttp://wiki.progress.com/display/sup/mail/\r\n\r\nnot:\r\n\r\nhttp://wiki.progress.com/spaces/viewmailarchive.action?key=sup\r\n\r\nApologies if this has been added since 2.2.2.

For incoming messages, we prefer Redirect (aka \"Bounce\") or direct IMAP copying over Forwarding email. All these operations keep the mail envelope, including the \"To:\" and \"CC:\" fields of the email intact. Thus we would like to have this information also in Confluence. \r\n\r\nCurrently, we have to go back to the email box of the person who sent or received the email once we have found the interesting email in Confluence in order to get recipient information, which is tedious and error-prone. Furthermore, the email may well have been deleted in the mean time, destroying this important piece of information altogether.",

      "description": "FAQs are intensive to maintain and prone to human error, especially those that that use the {include-page} macro. Below is an example of how multi-page FAQs are currently constructed, though this applies to FAQs on a single page as well.\r\n\r\n--- Page A ---\r\n# [FAQ Title 1|#entry1]\r\n# [FAQ Title 2|#entry2]\r\n\r\n{include:Page B}\r\n{include:Page C}\r\n\r\n--- Page B ---\r\nh3. FAQ Title 1 {anchor:entry1}\r\nFAQ Content 1\r\n\r\n--- Page C ---\r\nh3. FAQ Title 2 {anchor:entry2}\r\nFAQ Content 2\r\n\r\nThis has the following disadvantages:\r\n1) Anchor links and FAQ entry titles must be entered twice\r\n2) Naming conventions for anchors must be strictly enforced and should be non-numeric so that entries can be added or removed later. This results in long anchor names\r\n3) Risk that anchor links will point to anchors that do not exist or a duplicate anchor\r\n\r\nA layout that solves the above problems could be as follows:\r\n\r\n--- Page A ---\r\n{faq-index}\r\n{include:Page B}\r\n{include:Page C}\r\n\r\n--- Page B ---\r\n{faq} FAQ Title 1\r\nFAQ Content 1\r\n{faq}\r\n\r\n--- Page C ---\r\n{faq} FAQ Title 2\r\nFAQ Content 2\r\n{faq}\r\n\r\nThe above solution is easier to write and maintain. Note that the FAQ macro will process the first line of the macro body as the title, stripping off any leading spaces in the title.\r\n\r\nOptional:\r\n- Allow individual entries to appear in multiple indexes based on labels. This will permit an FAQ entry applicable to multiple topics to be indexed to them both. If an entry is marked with labels, eg {faq:label=A,B} it will be listed by any FAQ indexes set to look for that label, eg {faq-index:label=A} will show only FAQ entries labelled with A. The basic {faq-index} would show all labels\r\n- Allow heading variables, ie {faq-index:heading=h3} and {faq:heading=h3} where heading is a range from h1 to h5 and the default is h3\r\n- FAQ index titles should be able to include links, images and thumbnails",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFCLOUD-8215].\n  {panel}\n\nThe subconf plugin (http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/CONFEXT/Subconf) has to hook into the attachment subsystem.\r\nUnfortunately when I first wrote it, I couldn't find a clean way to integrate it.\r\nBasically there is a delegating attachment manager that delegates to either the file based, database based or web dav based attachment manager based on a global setting.\r\nThe component names for these three managers is hardcoded in a bit of logic in the delegating attachment manager.\r\nFurther, I wanted to only delegate to the subconf attachment manager if svn integration was set up for a particular space.\r\nI initially thought about just hacking the confluence spring xml file to replace the delegating attachment manager. But you can't even do that, as the classes for the plugin havent been loaded at confluence start up, so you get a class not found error.\r\n\r\nSo the nasty solution I came up with is this - get the spring app context, and inject my attachment manager in place of the file based attachment manager. This only works because the delegating attachment manager looks up the file based attachment manager every call, rather than having it injected at startup time.\r\nThis involves quite a lot of down casting of the app context and (ahem) a couple of calls to private methods.\r\n\r\nSo my question is - is there a better way to do this without the hack? I guess I need either a plugin point in the attachment sub system, or a more generalised method of replacing confluence components.",

Unchecked by default. Next to it would be a date selector (disabled when Revision checkbox is not checked), which I could use to select a date. if checked, the export would then provide the version changes following each page's most current content -- similar to how the RSS feed displays changes (see attached).
