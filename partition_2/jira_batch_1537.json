Issue Summary\r\n\r\nWhen a user that does not have the Attachments \"Add\" permission on the space, and they drag and drop a file to Confluence, a generic error is sometimes thrown.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Install Confluence 7.4.0\r\n# Setup permissions as shown here: [^spaceperms.png]\r\n# With a user that only belongs to *confluence-users* go to a page on that space\r\n# When viewing the page (not in the editor), drag and drop an attachment to Confluence of small size (less than 1mb)\r\n# Then upload a larger attachment (50mb+)\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nThe following error should be returned right away:\r\n{noformat}\r\nYou'll need to ask for permission to insert files here.\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nThis error is usually thrown when uploading small files. \r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nThe below exception is thrown in the browser: \r\n!wrongerror.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nThe dialog window will also show an upload \"in progress\", and show a progress bar, even if the user does not have permissions to upload to any page on the space. Eventually it throws the \"server cannot be reached\" error\r\n\r\nh3. Notes\r\nThis behavior is intermittent. Sometimes it works and throws the appropriate permission error, and sometimes it cannot be replicated. The following has been tried to workaround this issue: \r\n* Tested in multiple browsers\r\n* Reset *server.xml* to make sure the default is being used\r\n* Removed *protocol=\"org.apache.coyote.http11.Http11Nio2Protocol\"* from server.xml\r\n* Flushed browser and Confluence cache\r\n* Multiple file formats (zip, png, jpg, mp4, etc.)\r\n\r\n*_Regardless of the error, the file will not be uploaded if you do not have permission_*.

      "description": "h3. Issue Summary\r\n\r\nWhen a user is typing something is the quick search box (or in the KB search field in JSD), Confluence is receiving a series of subsequent requests, for example:\r\n * Why do\r\n * Why dogs c\r\n * Why dogs cannot fl\r\n * Why dogs cannot fly?\r\n\r\nSmall instances are able to provide the answers quickly (before the next request is received).\r\n\r\nIn case of the large instances, processing of each request could take a few seconds. As a result, Confluence could be overwhelmed with processing a lot of similar requests. What's more, a browser cancelled all previous requests, so the server is just wasting its resources, because nothing is waiting for the results.\u00a0\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Have a large instance where each search request takes a few seconds\r\n # Start typing something in quick search box (or in JSD KB search). You should add a delay of one second between entering characters (in this case a separate search request will be sent for each character).\r\n # Make a thread dump and see that a lot of threads are searching the documents.\u00a0\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nCancel and stop the previous search request(s), sent by this user.\r\n\r\nNote: the thread should wait until the previous search request finished its work. Because each search request processing consists of two parts:\r\n # Get all allowed/not allowed spaces\r\n # Scan the documents\r\n\r\nThe first part could be slow (if there is nothing in the cache) and we can't interrupt it. It's better to wait until this part is finished, and the results will be put to the cache. So the second thread will be able to use cached values.\r\n\r\nThe second part can be interrupted any time.\r\n\r\nAlso, if a search request notice that there are two (configurable) or more requests are already doing \"search\" for this user, it should respond with \"too many requests\" and do not block one more thread.\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nA lot of threads are \"searching\" something.\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nDisable quick search. Disable KB plugin.",

We are in a large company with many separate spaces and tens of thousands of users, so global is too broad for most templates that a team would create.\r\n\r\nFor example, one team with their own space has created a functional spec template that other users in a different space may find useful, but we don't want to spam thousands of people with this in their create page popups.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe current solutions I see are:\r\n\r\n1) Create a new template in the 2nd space by copy and paste\u00a0 \u00a0.. or ..\r\n\r\n2) Create a global template for all Confluence users\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThis is also related to the ability to [copy/import/export|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFSERVER-7752?error=login_required&error_description=Login+required&state=4f84a1bf-7b50-4e6b-8c50-b0c726e4ed8f]\u00a0templates using other than the keyboard copy and paste shortcuts.\u00a0\r\nh3.

Environment\r\n* Tested in Confluence 7.4.1 and Confluence 7.4.4\r\n* The Origin Space can be from a Cloud instance or a Server/DC instance and the same issue happens\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\nh4. In the origin Space follow the Steps below:\r\n# Create a new page, let's name it 'Parent Page'\r\n# Create a child page under the newly created page, let's name it 'Child Page'\r\n# In the 'Child page' add a *Page properties* macro and configure it with any information. For example:\r\n !child_property.png|thumbnail! \r\n# Label this 'Child page' with a new label, let's say 'test'\r\n# In the 'Parent Page' add the *Page properties report* macro and configure it to filter for\r\n#* Label: 'test'\r\n#* In space: 'Current Space'\r\n#* Add a new filter 'With ancestor' and Search for 'Parent page' it will look like this:\r\n !macro01.png|thumbnail! \r\n# Save the changes and Publish the page\r\n# Go to Space tools > Content Tools > Export select XML as the option and create a Full Export of this space.\r\n\r\nh4. In the target instance follow the steps below:\r\n\r\n# Go to General configuration > Backup & Restore and import the newly created space export\r\n# Once the import completes, go to the imported space > Parent Page\r\n\r\nHere is the space exported from a test instance: [^Confluence-space-export-173616-4.xml.zip] \r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nYou would see the Parent Page with the Page properties report macro showing the correct content.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nThe macro in the 'Parent Page' will show 'No content found'\r\n !no_content.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\nWhen you edit the page and edit the macro to check its configuration you no longer see the title of the page selected in the 'With ancestor' option, it will display the page ID, however, this is the page ID of the previous instance.\r\n !with_page_id.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nDelete the reference of the Page ID and search the page by its title instead, save the changes and publish the page.",

Issue Summary\r\n\r\nWhen the START value in a REST API search reaches 100,000+ it appears to ignore the START value and just returns the result set from 100,000 through LIMIT, as if the START value was 100,000 (regardless of what it set to).\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Create a REST API content search for a very large result set (100,000+ records)\r\n # Use\u00a0[Pagination|https://developer.atlassian.com/server/confluence/pagination-in-the-rest-api/]\u00a0to search past your defined limit (or past the default limit of 500 records returned)\r\n # Continue this search past the first 100,000 records in the result set\u00a0\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nAll records in the 100,000+ result set are returned if queried for (limited to to a max 500 at a time).\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nOnly the first 100,500 records are returnable by the REST API search (which is the 100,000 [MAX_START_OFFSET|https://docs.atlassian.com/atlassian-confluence/6.6.0/index.html?constant-values.html]\u00a0value + the the 500 [MAX_LIMIT|https://docs.atlassian.com/atlassian-confluence/6.6.0/index.html?constant-values.html]\u00a0value)\r\n\r\nExamples:\r\n{code:java}\r\nSUCCESS = \"self\": \"/rest/api/content/search?expand=history,version&limit=200&start=99800&cql=%28type%3Dpage%20and%20lastModified%3Cnow%28%27-104w%27%29\"\r\n\r\nSUCCESS = \"self\": \"/rest/api/content/search?expand=history,version&limit=200&start=100000&cql=%28type%3Dpage%20and%20lastModified%3Cnow%28%27-104w%27%29%\"\r\n\r\nFAILURE = \"self\": \"/rest/api/content/search?expand=history,version&limit=200&start=100200&cql=%28type%3Dpage%20and%20lastModified%3Cnow%28%27-104w%27%29%\"\r\n{code}\r\n\"Failure\" here being that the final query didn't return the correct result set, it returned the\u00a0*exact* same results as the 2nd query.\u00a0\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nLimit the search by space, and iterate over all spaces if needed. It's very unlikely that a single space will have more than 100k pages, so that approach would circumvent this limitation. A draft of the logic can be found here:\r\n [^get-all-pages.py] \r\n\r\nThe script above users */rest/api/content* instead of the *search* endpoint. This means all pages are returned, including the ones with restrictions applied if running it with an admin account.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, SQL queries could be used in place of a REST call to accomplish similar goals.\u00a0",

Background\r\n\r\nAt the moment, if a space has permissions for 10 different groups, and Confluence needs to check is user has an access to the space, it call this method 10 times:\r\n{code:java}\r\ncrowdService.isUserMemberOfGroup(userName, groupName) {code}\r\nIf there are a plenty of groups, each call would take some time, and users will notice the slowness of the system.\r\nh1. Possible solutions\r\nh2. Solution 1. We need a method in Crowd like:\r\n{code:java}\r\ncrowdService.isUserMemberOfAnyGroup(userName, groupNameList) {code}\r\nIt would improve performance, but it requires to change Crowd API.\u00a0\r\nh2.

Expected Results\r\n\r\nNo errors are seen and the instance works as expected.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nSome UI functionalities fail and this is seen repeateadly on the *atlassian-confluence.log* file:\r\n{code}\r\n/rest/mywork/latest/status/notification/count | traceId: e33f4ce1cc7be186 | userName: admin\r\njava.lang.RuntimeException: bundle [com.atlassian.mywork.confluence-host-plugin].

Workaround\r\n\r\nSince Oracle does not allow renaming the schema, you need to drop it and create a new one without dots. Following the initial example, conf_admin should work fine. On the Confluence side, restart the application setup so it can create the tables on the new schema:\r\n\r\n# Stop Confluence\r\n# Remove *<Confluence-home>/confluence.cfg.xml*\r\n# Restart Confluence\r\n# You should be prompted to complete the setup again\r\n\r\nh3. Notes\r\n\r\nThis has previously been reported as a suggestion, but opening it as a bug since Oracle itself allows schema names with dots based on the documentation:\r\n\r\n* https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFSERVER-33680\r\n* https://docs.oracle.com/cd/B19306_01/server.102/b14200/sql_elements008.htm",

Workaround\r\n\r\nThere are two possible workarounds to access Confluence Administration:\r\n * *Disable the secure sessions*, removing the websudo form. As a side-effect, you can go straight into administration functions without confirmation that you should. This poses a security risk.\r\n ** See [Configuring Secure Administrator Sessions|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Configuring+Secure+Administrator+Sessions].\r\n * *Set a new password for the user that was created with JIT provisioning*: JIT provisioning creates a user in Confluence Internal Directory and you can define a password for this user.

Issue Summary\r\nWhen a macro is inserted in a page, the Confluence editor adds the following HTML tag before the macro code:\r\n{code:xml}\r\n<p class=\"auto-cursor-target\"><br /></p>\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nPointing the editor cursor to the line with this code and adding line breaks will create new paragraphs with the same class tag.\r\nWhen the page is published, these paragraphs are not rendered as expected in page view mode, since they are not treated as new lines.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Install a vanilla instance of Confluence.\r\n #* This was validated on Confluence 7.4.3 and 7.7.2.\r\n #* The issue did *not* exist on Confluence *6.6.3* nor on *6.13.4*.\r\n #* The issue does not occur if Collaborative Editing is disabled on the affected versions.\r\n# Create a new Space.\r\n# Create a sample page.\r\n# In the first line of the page add an Info Macro.\r\n# Use the _up arrow_ keyboard button to go the previous line and add another Info Macro.\r\n# Use the _down arrow_ keyboard button to go the next line, which will be between both macros.\r\n# Use the _return (enter)_ keyboard button to add new lines between the two macros.\r\n !screenshot-1.png|thumbnail! \r\n# Publish the page.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nWhen the page is displayed, the new lines created between the two Info Macros are properly rendered as blank space. \r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nThere's no new line between the two macros.\r\nIf you check the storage format it will be as below:\r\n{code:xml}\r\n<p class=\"auto-cursor-target\"><br /></p><ac:structured-macro ac:name=\"info\" ac:schema-version=\"1\" ac:macro-id=\"03a53bba-bd52-43fb-b8bb-ef7efd2e172d\"><ac:rich-text-body>\r\n<p><br /></p></ac:rich-text-body></ac:structured-macro>\r\n<p class=\"auto-cursor-target\"><br /></p>\r\n<p class=\"auto-cursor-target\"><br /></p>\r\n<p class=\"auto-cursor-target\"><br /></p>\r\n<p class=\"auto-cursor-target\"><br /></p>\r\n<p class=\"auto-cursor-target\"><br /></p>\r\n<p class=\"auto-cursor-target\"><br /></p>\r\n<p class=\"auto-cursor-target\"><br /></p><ac:structured-macro ac:name=\"info\" ac:schema-version=\"1\" ac:macro-id=\"01b6f70e-1335-4b03-9428-c6dd60592343\"><ac:rich-text-body>\r\n<p><br /></p></ac:rich-text-body></ac:structured-macro>\r\n<p><br /></p>\r\n{code}\r\n\\\\\r\n\\\\\r\n !screenshot-2.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\nh3.

Often I am asked how to set background colours in the report table or how to highlight something. We used status macro for that but when we use status macros then the affected row cannot be sorted. The table as an overview helps to prioritize but there is no way to show more than the content - maybe the priority set. The native move would be to set a background color like in MS Excel. This is what we would like to achieve.\r\nOur Request: Make it work that with the page properties also the background-color of the table cell will be shown in the property report.\r\nEffect: the overview can contain more infos than cell values: background-colors can offer more dimensions necessary to compare or display information - which then is a better basis for decisions.",

Problem\r\nWhen moving a page to another Space, if one of its child pages has the same name as a page in the destination Space, the move operation will fail, as Confluence does not allow two pages with the same name to exist in a single Space, which is the expected behavior. Normally, the child page can then be renamed in order to allow the parent page to be moved.\r\n\r\nHowever, this will also happen if that child page (with a matching name) is an unpublished draft, which causes an issue as:\r\n# The unpublished draft does not show under the page tree, or on searches, which makes it difficult to locate\r\n# Only the person who created this draft has access to it (in order to publish or delete it) - most importantly, not even Confluence admins have access to this draft ([CONFSERVER-35921|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFSERVER-35921])\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Create page \"Matching title\" in \"Dest Space\"\r\n# Create page \"Page to move\" in \"Source Space\"\r\n# Create page \"Matching title\" in \"Source Space\" as child of \"Page to move\", but don't publish it (wait for Confluence to automatically save the unpublished draft)\r\n# Try to move page \"Page to move\" to \"Dest Space\"\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nThe page move still shouldn't happen, as expected, since Confluence does not allow pages with duplicated names in the same Space.\r\n\r\nHowever, in cases when the duplicated page is an unpublished draft, Confluence should handle this better, as this issue can't be solved by a regular user or admin (who aren't the owner of the draft). \r\n\r\nAt least, it could indicate that the duplicated page is indeed a draft, or perhaps provide the option to ignore the conflicting draft when moving the parent page.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nConfluence will just throw this error:\r\n\r\n{noformat}\r\nThe page 'Matching title' already exists in space 'Dest Space'. You need to rename the page title before moving it.\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\nDeleting the unpublished draft allows the parent page to be moved successfully (however, only the owner of the draft is capable of deleting it).\r\n",
