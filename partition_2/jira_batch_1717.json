It should in my mind make the macro non-functional as well but it does still seem to work (i.e. in view mode) which is strange.\r\n\r\nThe root problem is that the location parameter has metadata describing it as 'confluence-content' when it can actually be content or a free URL.\r\n\r\nHowever it could be that prior to 5.3.2 changes the unmarshaller would still handle the badly formatted redirect macro definition. (See https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONF-31382)\r\n\r\nThere are a few approaches to fixing this -\r\n\r\n1) Raise an issue with Customware to have the redirect macro fixed. If it wants to continue to benefit from using the 'confluence-content' type (e.g. autocompletion in the Macro Browser) then it will likely need to introduce a second parameter for URL redirects. \r\n\r\nThis will be quite a substantial change likely needing a migration task as well.\r\n\r\n2) We further hack the StorageMacroV2Unmarshaller to handle this invalid macro parameter.\r\n\r\n3) We try to find a way for macro marshalling to storage to detect this misuse of a parameter and fail in a safer way e.g. don't output an <a> but instead leave the parameter value as plain text? (This could be even more hacky than (2). How much broken metadata do we try and cope with?",

Some of our add-ons need to mark up the Attachments file lists with new columns, and we would love to have a standardized way to do this.\r\n\r\nOne possible implementation that would work for us would be along the following lines:\r\n\r\nCreate a new <web-item>, containing:\r\n- an i18n column title to be inserted in the <th>\r\n- a style class to be applied to the <th> and <td>\r\n- a weight to position the column amongst other add-on links. For us, it would be sufficient to insert the plugin-supplied links all at the right hand side, immediately before any attachment actions...but if you wanted to go all-out and make all of the system attachment columns into their own web-items and permit a completely arbitrary rendering order, that would also work.\r\n- a Velocity context containing just a reference to the attachment itself (and/or attachment version)\r\n\r\nWith the current implementation of the attachments macro and Tools->Attachments page, we would presumably need three different web-item sections:\r\n\r\n1- the Tools->Attachments page,\r\n2- the top-level Attachments Macro list (which contains just the file name and modified date), and\r\n3- the Attachments Macro version list (containing the version name, creator and date)",

Open a page containing a lot of content, so the page ca scroll up and down. (This is only to visualize a side-effect.)\r\n2. In the center of the page, start typing following text:\r\nbq. Test -> My test\\-\r\nAfter entering the second \"-\", AutoFormat will literally jump in. The line being edited will scroll to the bottom of the screen (This is the side-effekt I mentioned.). The last words will be replaced by strike-through test.\r\n3. The usual reaction of a user is to press \"Ctrl+Z\" to undo this edit. Then the user will often use the backspace key in order to delete the second \"-\"\r\n4. As a reaction to this last key press, Confluence will ask if the user wants to leave the page. (Of course this is not intended, and it is a totally wrong behaviour, since the blinking cursor visualizes that the user is in text edit mode, where the back key is only supposed to delete the last character, nothing else.). Press \"Stay on page\".\r\n5. The already confused user might try again to delete the last \"-\" by pressing the back key. This results in *immediately* cancelling the editing session.\r\n\r\n(Side note: The fact that AutoFormatting creates strike-through text is obviously undocumented on the shortcut help pages.)\r\n\r\nIn order to prevent further damage I have disabled Auto-Formatting for the moment.",

I feel very restricted and the formatting (if it exists) is in my opinion overly complicated.\r\n\r\nSay I want to add some text to go with my picture or table, text that actually follows the picture AND is visible in a .pdf export. This should be possible in my opinion.\r\n\r\nSay I want to change my font size or decide what font size I want for my different headings, shouldn't this be possible?\r\n\r\nSay I want to change some table properties like width and height etc. etc. , why is this impossible?\r\n\r\nFor numbered bulletpoints, why isn't there an option to continue my previous numbered bulletpoints (say before an inserted picture) instead of starting over from 1. ?\r\n\r\nI am like most users used to MS Word or similar, is it possible to look in that direction and make the text formatting a little more flexible? (I might be committing the ultimate sin here I know..).\r\n\r\nThanks for any feedback!\r\n\r\nTom Erik\r\nSensor Developments AS",

Out-of-the-box use of Meeting Notes will produce a page tree that looks like this:\r\n* Meeting Notes\r\n** 2013-10-25 Meeting Notes\r\n** 2013-10-26 Meeting Notes\r\n** 2013-10-27 Meeting Notes\r\n\r\nIt's pretty clear imho that it's much more desirable to keep the latest meeting notes on top, as in:\r\n* Meeting Notes\r\n** 2013-10-27 Meeting Notes\r\n** 2013-10-26 Meeting Notes\r\n** 2013-10-25 Meeting Notes\r\n\r\nBut there is not a nice mechanism for making this happen without resorting to manual re-ordering. Imposing a simple reverse-alphabetical sort on the Meeting Notes child pages would do it (assuming an appropriate naming convention were used - like the one that the out-of-the-box Meeting Notes blueprint suggests).",
