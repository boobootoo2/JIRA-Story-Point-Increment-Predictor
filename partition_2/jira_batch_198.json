      "description": "We have sprints with lots of issues and all of them have multiple subtasks. I have the healthy habit of collapsing all issues that are completely done, to keep an uncluttered overview of the work still to do. JIRA will remember which issues are closed and which are not. So far, so good.\r\n\r\nNow something changes in the order of the sprint, like moving an issue up in de order or adding a new issue at the top of the sprint. I know this is not supposed to happen in Scrum during a sprint, but of course it will from time to time. The collapsed / uncollapsed view is now messed up: some previously collapsed issues are now uncollapsed and vice-versa. Of course this is annoying, because I expect all collapsed issues to be done.\r\n\r\nI'm a developer myself and did some research to help find & fix the problem. I found that the localStorage entry gh.boardSettings.x has a collapsedSwimLanes property which is an array of numbers. I assume these are issue indices referring to the n'th issue at the sprint board. This would explain why the view gets messed up when you add issues somewhere else than at the bottom of the sprint cause the indices of all 'lower' issues will change.\r\n\r\nMy suggested solution is to use issue numbers, like JOC-142 instead of indices as entries in the collapsedSwimLanes array. These are unique per JIRA instance and not depending on any order.\r\n\r\nThanks for considering this fix and making an already happy JIRA user even more happy! :)\r\n\r\nP.S. I also see numbers higher than the amount of issues on my current sprint, so it seems these are not reset when a new sprint opens and also not during the sprint. When using issue numbers, maybe this should not happen anymore and the whole list should be refreshed every time a change occurs.",

Well, actually it adjusts the vertical view to scroll it into view, but as the filter hides the task, it is not being displayed.\r\n\r\nAs a result, the task disappears when dropped in the \"Done\" column (/) and the board scrolls down (x), depending on the number of completed tasks.\r\n\r\nOften, the active story (from which the task was picked and moved) is no longer visible afterwards (x) (as it has been scrolled out of view). In other words, the smart \"scroll into view\" feature does not work well in this situation and confuses our developers and testers. :(\r\n\r\nThe expectation is that scrolling into view respects filters, i.e. the view does not scroll in case a task that is being moved is not displayed.",

Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Create a Scrum/Kanban board with sample data.\r\n# View board's configuration, the filter query should be like {{project = SSP ORDER BY Rank ASC}}.  !SSPBoard.PNG|thumbnail! \r\n# Create a new filter with only issues in To Do and In Progress status from the result returns from the board filter, for example {{filter = \"Filter for SSP board\" AND status in (\"To Do\", \"In progress\")}}.\r\n# Create another board with the new filter from step 3, the configuration of the board should be similar with the configuration in this screenshot.  !newBoard.PNG|thumbnail! \r\n# Go back to view the board.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nThe sidebar for the board created in step 4 should be the same as the one in step 1.  !sampleData.PNG|thumbnail! \r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nIn JIRA 7.1.x, there are no project specific links in the sidebar for board created in step 4.  !new.PNG|thumbnail!\r\nIn JIRA 6.4.x, there is no sidebar at all.\r\n \r\n\r\nh3.Workaround\r\nAdd {{AND project = SSP}} at the end of the board filter in step 4",

[See the corresponding bug report|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSWCLOUD-13632].\r\n  {panel}\r\n\r\nh3. Summary\r\n\r\n* When browsing to 'Manage Boards' it's possible the 1min Ajax timeout in JIRA kicks in, preventing the board from loading. This will result in a timeout as per the attached screenshot.\r\n* Additionally, when accessing the Rapid Boards for certain projects the page load times can be excessive.\r\n* Please note there is another more specific bug related to slow _All Boards_: [JIRA Software Viewing All Boards can timeout due to resolving project list for each loaded board - JSW-15295|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSW-15295]\r\n\r\nh3. Environment\r\n\r\nReproduced with the following instance size:\r\n\r\n{noformat}\r\n    ___ Database Statistics ____________________\r\n\r\n         Issues                                        : 330776\r\n         Projects                                      : 187\r\n         Custom Fields                                 : 180\r\n         Workflows                                     : 306\r\n         Users                                         : 3719\r\n         Groups                                        : 2060\r\n         Attachments                                   : 118585\r\n         Comments                                      : 265597\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nIt could be:\r\n* 52 Rapid Boards were using the {{issue in parent()}} function\r\n* Large number of boards and/or complex JQL used in the board filters.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n# Use a large instance, such as above.\r\n# Install a third-party plugin that provides additional functionality. This was reproduced with J-Tricks, using {{issue in parent()}}.\r\n# Access the Manage Boards page, or browse to projects.\r\n\r\nIt is important to note that this affected rapid boards which did *not* use that third-party JQL, as {{com.atlassian.greenhopper.web.sidebar.AgileBoardScopeFilterContextProvider.getContext}} (the JIRA Software code called from the JIRA Core sidebar) executes the same code to perform project lookups by analysing JQL queries (analysing, not executing). The problem is due to the way the third-party plugin is designed is that the operand executes when it's analysed. Specifically this is not conclusively caused by third-party plugins.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\n* The Manage Boards page does not time out, and the project page loads within an acceptable time.\r\n* Viewing Rapid Boards responds in a reasonable time frame.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nThe ajax timeout kicks in and the page times out whilst waiting for {{rest/greenhopper/1.0/rapidviews/viewsData}} to return results, or the board can take > 1 minute to load.\r\n\r\nh3. Notes\r\n\r\nAccessing that endpoint outside of JIRA (and thus bypassing ajax) in this instance returned within 1.2mins.\r\n\r\nThis appears to be caused by {{QueryToProjectMapper.getProjectContextIdsForQuery}} which uses JIRA Core code to lookup the QueryContext. Due to the way the lookup occurs it's possible that JQL may be executed and this times out the board.\r\n\r\nA sample snapshot of the problem has been attached.\r\n\r\nh3. Verification\r\n\r\nThe problem occurs in multiple areas of JIRA Software - it's most evident in manage boards however can occur on the Rapid Boards. \r\n\r\nFor Manage Boards:\r\n# Call {{/rest/greenhopper/1.0/rapidviews/viewsData}} will be slow (40+ seconds, in some cases will not return anything as the AJAX timeout terminates the request).\r\n# Class {{com.atlassian.greenhopper.web.rapid.view.RapidViewListResource.getViewsAndConfigModel}} will be present in the stacktrace for long-running threads: \r\n{code:borderStyle=solid}\r\n\"http-nio-80-exec-45\" #8007 daemon prio=5 os_prio=0 tid=0x000000003cac0000 nid=0x19dc runnable [0x000000027765a000]\r\n...\r\n        at com.atlassian.greenhopper.web.rapid.view.RapidViewProjectHelper.getRapidViewProjectList(RapidViewProjectHelper.java:58)\r\n...\r\n        at com.atlassian.greenhopper.web.rapid.view.RapidViewListHelper.buildListAndConfigModel(RapidViewListHelper.java:105)\r\n...\r\n        at com.atlassian.greenhopper.web.rapid.view.RapidViewListResource.getViewsAndConfigModel(RapidViewListResource.java:74)\r\n...\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nFor Rapid Boards:\r\n# Many threads will be waiting on a response to {{AbstractFuture$Sync}} as per the attached screenshot.

Workaround\r\nDisable the plugin that is causing the problem (this can be identified by using something such as jProfiler to profile the instance as per [Using jProfiler to analyse a JIRA application performance|https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirakb/using-jprofiler-to-analyse-a-jira-application-performance-355926726.html]).\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you can increase the timeout as mentioned in [How to change the default AJAX timeout in JIRA|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRAKB/How+to+change+the+default+AJAX+timeout+in+JIRA].\r\n\r\nh3. Note on fix\r\nThis ticket is a combination of a couple of different problems related to JQL and Boards:\r\n* Some of them fixed: JSWSERVER-15295, JSWSERVER-15663\r\n* Or largely mitigated by JRASERVER-67570.\r\n* there is feature request which potentially helps further JRASERVER-60957, we will monitor the traction. \r\n\r\nWe believe that the current problem is resolved at this point.

We are having lots of problems though with communication and notifications.\r\n\r\nThe biggest problem is the way that tickets are sent to people.  We are not JIRA Administrators so we cannot make global changes so we need to make changes as JIRA users.\r\n\r\nOn other systems, we could choose which ticket groups we wanted to get emails for, but it appears in JIRA we have to be watchers on a ticket in order to get emails.\r\n\r\nThe problem with this is we have to know about the ticket before we can become a watcher and then even if we know about the ticket we have to logon and do some clicks to become a watcher.\r\n\r\nSo we would like to be able to automatically be watchers of all new tickets in an Instance, but then be able to opt out of the emails for certain components.  So if an instance has components A,B,C, by default we would become auto-watchers of any tickets in the instance that are assigned to A,B, and C.  User 1 is fine with this because he watches all components.  User 2 though only needs all emails related to component C so they would like to opt out of components A and B.\r\n\r\nAnd we need the ability to set all this up from a User level and not have to bother Administrators or do any kind of extra workarounds and inventive schemes to make this happen.\r\n\r\nI would like to talk to somebody at Atlassian further about this issue and see what kind of suggestions can be made.
