Furthermore since there is no more editor that lets you go back and forth between markup and rich text there is no easy way to preview your markup short of copy pasting from textedit to a wiki page, testing, goign back to textedit, making changes, re pasting, re previewing. yuck.

      "description": "h4. Symptoms\r\n\r\nAs Described on this bug report:\r\n\r\n* [CONF-24055|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONF-24055]\r\n\r\nIn version 4.0 and above, Confluence should be able to auto update page links when the linked page has been renamed. However this is not working when the title of the page contains any multi-byte characters such as Japanese or Chinese.\r\n\r\nh4. Cause\r\n\r\nThis appears to be caused at the time the link is saved. If you save a link to a page called \"First Page\" in English, it looks like this in storage format:\r\n\r\n{code:xml}<ac:link><ri:page ri:content-title=\"First Page\" /></ac:link>{code}\r\n\r\nHowever if you save a page called \"\u6700\u521d\u306e\u30da\u30fc\u30b8\" in Japanese, then it looks like this:\r\n\r\n{code:xml}<ac:link><ri:page ri:content-title=\"\u6700\u521d\u306e\u30da\u30fc\u30b8\" /><ac:plain-text-link-body><![CDATA[\u6700\u521d\u306e\u30da\u30fc\u30b8]]></ac:plain-text-link-body></ac:link>{code}\r\n\r\nThe key difference is that there is an \"ac:plain-text-link-body\" section inserted, meaning that the link text has been overridden from the page name. The auto updater is only changing the \"ri:page\" element, specifically the \"ri:content-title\" attribute.\r\n\r\nh4. Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n# Create a page called \u6700\u521d\u306e\u30da\u30fc\u30b8\r\n# Create another page, and add a link to \u6700\u521d\u306e\u30da\u30fc\u30b8\r\n# Rename the page \u6700\u521d\u306e\u30da\u30fc\u30b8 to \u4e8c\u3064\u76ee\u306e\u30da\u30fc\u30b8\r\n# Reload the page with the link, and observe that the old page name remains\r\n\r\nh4. Workaround\r\n\r\nTo get around the issue when creating a new page:\r\n\r\n# Create the page named with Roman characters only\r\n# Create a link to that page\r\n# Rename the page to have multi-byte characters\r\n# The link should be updated normally from then on, as long as the link isn't edited again\r\n\r\nTo make a link to an existing page:\r\n\r\n# Rename the page to a title with Roman characters only\r\n# Create a link to that page\r\n# Rename it back to the old title",

In one instance, an OnDemand customer has imported a space but the importer didn't strip out the space layout and so he ended up with text at the top of each page in the space saying \"#usernavbar()\". I had to manually go to {{/spaces/resetdecorator.action?decoratorName=decorators/main.vmd&key=<space key>&atl_token=<token>}} to reset the decorator, as trying to view it at {{/spaces/listdecorators.action?key=<space key>}} just gave a message saying \"You can not customise the site look and feel while a theme is active. You must first disable the currently configured theme.\"\r\n\r\nThe other one was an issue where the global layout had been changed in a previous version on Confluence, and upon updating to 4.1 the \"Add Space\" link on the Dashboard was missing. I had to manually reset the decorator by going to {{/admin/resetdecorator.action?decoratorName=decorators/global.vmd&alt_token=<token>}} to reset it.",
