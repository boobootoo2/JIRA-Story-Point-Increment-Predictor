In addition, the commit would not even count until other \"not-forked\" repo has a new commit against the JIRA ticket.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce:\r\n# Integrate JIRA with Bitbucket Server.\r\n# Create a Repository on Bitbucket and fill in with some details (File and Commits)\r\n# Make a smart commit towards a JIRA ticket like:\r\n{code}ABC-1 #comment test{code}\r\n# Fork the Repository.\r\n# Do another smart commit in the Forked Repository working directory.\r\n# Check that the new commit is added to Bitbucket side and it shows that it is linked to a JIRA Ticket.\r\n# Navigate to JIRA and open the mentioned ticket.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Result:\r\nThere will be a Two comment with \"Test\" in JIRA Ticket.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Result:\r\nThere is only 1 comment with \"Test\" to be found.\r\n\r\nh3. Notes:\r\n# The commit count will show only 1\r\n# Opening it will show 2 with the commit from the Forked Repository.\r\n# Pushing a commit to the parent repository will update the count\r\n\r\nh3.

Hence having a feature to automatically set the fix version of each created issue under and epic automatically will reduce lots of overhead work when using JIRA.\r\n \r\nh3. *Workaround* \r\nCan use  Bulk Update the fixVersions of the issues linked to a certain Epic from time to time. It's still a manual action but it limits it to one action per Epic instead of changing the fixVersion of every single issue by hand.",

I'm sorry we haven't provided feedback on it earlier. We fully understand the value it would provide to you.\r\n\r\nThe good news is that in the next Jira Server release you will find the \"Development\" column in Issue Navigator, which will\u00a0contain\u00a0the most important development information for an issue including commits, pull requests, builds and deployments.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\n agenkin@atlassian.com\r\n Anton Genkin\u00a0| Product Manager - Integrations\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\nCurrently users have to visit an individual issue to see how many commits/reviews/etc. it's linked with. It would be great if they can search for issues in a Software project and have a column to show the overview of these data for each issue in Issue Navigator e.g. 2 commits, 1 review, and so on.",

So the idea is that each Service team has its own board, where the maintenance and planning of a specific backlog is handled. Each team should contribute to our product backlog and also to our product sprint. So the idea is to have one common sprint, which is enhanced by each team using their own board with their own scope (based on a filter). So for that we create a central Sprint and would like to add Jira Issues to that Sprint using the Service team boards. But the empty Sprint that we want to plan, is not visible on the other boards. Is there an option for sharing Sprints between boards within a Jira project? Do we only have the workaround of adding issues to the Sprint by using the general board (the backlog of the general board is really huge and the performance is not really good)? I think currently at least one issue must be pre-assigned, which would be in scope of the Service team board (inside the used filter)._",

Created vs Resolved Issues Report generates a wrong JQL when clicking the link to list issues.\r\n\r\nWhen set to a monthly period, the Created vs Resolved Issues Report generates a wrong JQL when clicking the link to list issues. See screenshots attached.\r\n\r\nWhat happens is that the numbers on the report itself follow some sort of \"sliding window\" time frame. For example, if the report is set to grab the last 60 days, it looks like the report counts 60 running days backwards and generates the numbers based on that.\r\n\r\nHowever, when you click on the number of created and resolved, JIRA generates a JQL that counts from day 1 of the first month and not effectively 60 days ago, increasing the numbers of issues listed. If you change the 'Period' setting from monthly to daily it is possible to see the first day that should be grabbed by the report.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n# Generate a 'Created vs Resolved Issues Report' and set it to use a 'Monthly' period with 'Cumulative Totals' set to 'no'.\r\n# Click on the 'Created' or 'Resolved' number for the first month of the series, under 'Data Table'.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected results\r\nThe list of issues should start from the correct period to match the graph\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nThe list of issues start from day 1 of that month instead.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\nAlthough this is not a workaround per se, one can manually adjust the JQL first date on the JQL that is generated upon clicking the number of issues on the graph.",

Summary\r\n\r\nWhen scrolling to the top of the backlog with a list of long issues in the backlog, the scroll bar hides behind the Sprint Header and obscures it from view. \r\n\r\nh3. Environment\r\n\r\nCan be replicated in Google Chrome, Firefox and Safari. \r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Create or view a board with a long list of issues or resize the browser window vertically to reduce the available screen space. \r\n#  Create and start a Sprint so the sprint header appears at the top of the backlog. \r\n# Depending on the OS version, you may need to change system settings to 'Show Scroll bars: Always'. In Mac OS - System Preferences > General. \r\n# Scroll to the top of the backlog.\r\n# Scroll all the way back up. \r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nThe scroll bar stops scrolling upwards once it reaches the sticky Sprint header. \r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nScroll bar continues scrolling and eventually hides behind the sprint header completely. \r\n \r\nh3. Notes\r\n\r\nSee recording here: [^Screen Recording 2017-09-19 at 05.19 PM.mov] \r\n\r\nh3.Workaround\r\n\r\n1. Use mouse-wheel or track pad to scroll back down and bring the scroll bar into view. \r\n\r\nOr \r\n\r\n2. Add the following CSS to JIRA's [announcement banner|https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiraserver071/configuring-an-announcement-banner-802592288.html]:\r\n\r\n{code}\r\n<style type=\"text/css\">\r\n.ghx-backlog-header.stuck{\r\nposition:absolute;\r\n}\r\n</style>\r\n{code}\r\n\r\n(!) Note that if a typo occurs, it may break access to JIRA (due to invalid or incomplete HTML). If you have problems immediately after adjusting the banner, you can follow [these steps to manually remove the banner|https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirakb/how-to-remove-jira-announcement-banner-through-the-database-429916703.html].
