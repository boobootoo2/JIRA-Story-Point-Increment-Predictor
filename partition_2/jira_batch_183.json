This is causing a number of confusions as follows:\r\nh3. #1 - Not possible to tell which Story belongs to which Epic from Backlog, Active Sprint, and Issue Navigator\r\n\r\nIf 2 Epics on the same board (they may belong to 2 different projects) have the same Epic Name and Color, and each has a few Stories, it's impossible to tell which Story belongs to which Epic. This applies to Backlog, Active Sprint, and Issue Navigator.\r\nh4. +Workarounds for #1+\r\n # If possible, change the Epic Name of 1 of the Epics\r\n # If Epic Name can't be changed for any reason, change the Color of 1 of the Epics - this can be done from Backlog and it will look like this afterwards:\r\n !backlog.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nh4. +Suggested Solutions for #1+\r\n # Prevent Epics from having the same name - as per\u00a0JSWSERVER-16366\r\n # Pre-pend the issue key of an Epic to its name for labeling purpose, e.g.:\r\n ** EPIC-1 - Same Epic Name\r\n ** EPIC-2 - Same Epic Name\r\n\r\n----\r\nh3. #2 - Exporting issues to HTML (or Excel) and CSV\r\n\r\nTake a look at this search result:\r\n !search.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nIf we export that search result to HTML (or Excel, as HTML can be opened by Excel and saved as XLSX), the exported data will look like this:\r\n\r\n!html.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\n(i)\u00a0Notice that Epic Names are exported under Epic Link column\r\n\r\n(flag)\u00a0Apparently it's impossible to tell which Story belongs to which Epic\r\n----\r\nIf we export that search result to CSV instead, the exported data will look like this:\r\n\r\n!csv.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\n(i)\u00a0Notice that issue keys of the Epics are exported under Epic Link column\r\n\r\n(+)\u00a0Users may base on the issue keys to find the right Epics (take note that Epics and Stories must be exported together)\r\nh4. +Workarounds for #2+\r\n # If possible/applicable, change the Epic Name of 1 of the Epics\r\n # If you're using HTML export and expect issue key to be exported instead of Epic Name, switch to CSV export - this is for\u00a0JRASERVER-62296\r\n # If you're using CSV export and expect Epic Name to be exported instead of issue key, switch to HTML export - this is for JRASERVER-67146\r\n\r\nh4. +Suggested Solutions for #2+\r\n\r\nIf we can pre-pend the issue key of an Epic to its name for labeling purpose, e.g. *{{KEY-123 - Epic Name}}*, then use this value for Epic Link field and consistently export it regardless of HTML/CSV exports.\r\n----\r\nh3. Notes\r\n\r\nAs per\u00a0JSWSERVER-14746, users may expect that an issue should have both Epic Name and Epic Link for a search result similar to [^search.png], so that when issues are exported, they can see the Epic Name under Epic Name column and issue key of the Epic under Epic Link column. This is a misconception and can't be achieved because:\r\n * Epic Name is specific to Epic issue type\r\n * Epic Link is used by other issue types to link to an Epic issue type\r\n\r\nSo basically:\r\n * An Epic has Epic Name but no Epic Link\r\n * Other issue types can have an Epic Link but can never have an Epic Name\r\n\r\n(+)\u00a0Refer to *#2* above for a possible workaround.",

      "description": "h3. Summary\r\nWhile doing ranking operation Issue ranking request has two limits\r\n* Total time limit for retry for whole method: 4000 ms\r\n* More specific timeout for rank lock: 1500 ms\r\nIn some cases (see below) issue ranking operation fails to save new rank due to rank lock expire.  This is caused by doing number of SQL calls to {{AO_60DB71_LEXORANK}} table under lock and some of them are slow (see below). \r\n\r\nAt this stage, we believe this *is not a JIRA bug*. That being said, we will keep ticket open for some time to monitor the problem. \r\n\r\nh3. Environment\r\n* Large JIRA instance: 1M+ issue \r\n** Basically we need large  {{AO_60DB71_LEXORANK}} table\r\n* MySQL 5.6.x\r\n** We identified problem for MySQL (5.6.x only), other DBs might be also affected, needs more checking \r\n* JIRA \r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Try to rank issue at the bottom of the RANK \r\n#* Currently problem is easily reproducible for EPIC ranking, since they are mostly at the bottom \r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nRank operation is successful. \r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n* EPIC ranking operation fails and that give *error in UI*:\r\n_JIRA Software cannot execute the rank operation at this time. Other users may be ranking the issues that you are trying to rank. Please try again later_\r\n** Rest call: /rest/agile/1.0/epic/<Epic_ID>/rank returns 500 \r\n \r\nh3. Notes\r\n* Detailed debug logging shows that EPIC rank fails to store new rank in DB due to *lock timeout*. \r\n** To enable logging set _DEBUG_ for {{com.atlassian.greenhopper.service.lexorank}} and {{com.atlassian.greenhopper.manager.lexorank}}\r\n** Logs\r\n{noformat}\r\n2017-05-15 03:51:37,226 https-8443-exec-12 DEBUG admin 231x1024011x9 2h8zm5 1.1.1.1 /rest/agile/1.0/epic/1582851/rank [greenhopper.manager.lexorank.LexoRankDaoImpl]  LexoRank Query : SELECT FIELD_ID,ID,ISSUE_ID,LOCK_HASH,LOCK_TIME,RANK,TYPE FROM AO_60DB71_LEXORANK WHERE FIELD_ID = ?

MySQL notes \r\nAfter some additional deep research from our side, we found a MySQL bug with very similar description which was fixed in 5.7:\r\n* https://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=61631\r\n** fixed in 5.7\r\n* Quote from https://dev.mysql.com/doc/relnotes/mysql/5.7/en/news-5-7-0.html\r\nbq. For the index merge access method, the optimizer could make a suboptimal choice of indexes to use. (Bug #14095506)\r\n\r\nh3.Workaround\r\n* In case of MySQL, please upgrade to MySQL *5.7*. We have a confirmation from the client that fixes the problem. \r\n* In case of MSSQL, problem was caused by wrong column type: RANK was varchar, it should be *nvarchar*.\r\n\r\nh3. Note on fix\r\nSince not all clients will be able quickly upgrade to MySQL 5.7, we decided to implement workaround for the problem in JIRA itself. In corresponding fixed version, code was changes to avoid SQL \"RANK <= 'abc' ORDER BY RANK DESC\"",

Expected Results\r\nThere is a scrollbar on the right side of this panel, allowing users to scroll through the list to locate the relevant board, as well as use the \"Create new board\" link here.\r\n\r\nh5. Actual Results\r\n* There is no scrollbar\r\n* Users cannot easily navigate to other boards\r\n* users cannot easily create new boards for this existing project\r\n\r\nh5. Workaround\r\nExpand the project side-bar before checking the boards list.",

However, the fact remains that this situation does represent a scope change and so the gadget is misleading when it says that there is zero scope change because you can't divide by zero.\r\n\r\nAt the bottom of that issue it is also stated that this will not be fixed because of it's edge nature, but I would argue that even showing \"Error: Original Estimate Equal to Zero\" would be preferable to something misleading.",

Environment\r\n* Instance is setup to use the BobSwift create on transition plugin (I believe scriptrunner could also do this), as well as the JIRA Workflow Toolbox extension in order to be able to create upwards of 20 subtasks when a particular issue is transitioned, based upon the values of custom fields in that issue\r\n* instance has this problem on 7.2.6, 7.2.8, and 7.3.4\r\n* This problem is related to the previous bug of [JSWSERVER-13756|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSWSERVER-13756].   The major difference being that JIRA does not deadlock in this case when this happens now.  However it can still generate an error and appear to temporarily have a problem in regards to the indexes of this parent issue/child issues for a few minutes.\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Create a workflow that will generate 20 different subtasks upon transition that are all children of the same parent issue.\r\n# Create two different parent issues in this project\r\n# Execute this same transition on both issues at nearly the same time\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nJIRA will create all the subtasks and continue on it's way happily\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n# JIRA displays a spinning wheel for a several seconds before it throws a communication breakdown error\r\n# Also it appears that the problem is in regards to ranking operations that are failing: {code:borderStyle=solid}\r\n2017-04-18 18:52:09,175 http-nio-4933-exec-24 uri:/secure/WorkflowUIDispatcher.jspa username:administrator DEBUG administrator 1131x1376x1 1xldvnm 0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1 /secure/WorkflowUIDispatcher.jspa [c.a.g.service.lexorank.LexoRankOperation] RANK_INITIAL end   [fieldId=10300, issueToRankIssueId=31332, issueToRankAroundIssueId=null\r\n2017-04-18 18:52:09,175 http-nio-4933-exec-24 uri:/secure/WorkflowUIDispatcher.jspa username:administrator WARN administrator 1131x1376x1 1xldvnm 0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1 /secure/WorkflowUIDispatcher.jspa [c.a.g.customfield.lexorank.LexoRankCFType] Unable to retrieve rank for field [10300] and issue [31332]\r\n2017-04-18 18:52:09,175 http-nio-4933-exec-24 uri:/secure/WorkflowUIDispatcher.jspa username:administrator WARN administrator 1131x1376x1 1xldvnm 0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1 /secure/WorkflowUIDispatcher.jspa [c.a.g.customfield.lexorank.LexoRankCFType] gh.lexorank.service.error.retrytimeout \r\n{code}\r\n# In this case it took the system almost exactly 10 minutes in order to finally finish the initial ranking option for issue 31332:\r\n{code:borderStyle=solid}\r\n2017-04-18 19:02:18,667 http-nio-4933-exec-24 uri:/secure/WorkflowUIDispatcher.jspa username:administrator DEBUG administrator 1131x1376x1 1xldvnm 0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1 /secure/WorkflowUIDispatcher.jspa [c.a.g.service.lexorank.LexoRankOperation] Ranked issue[id=31332] initially with rank[1|i007wn:] for rank field[id=10300]  \r\n{code}\r\n \r\nh3. Notes\r\n* JIRA does appear to recover from this problem eventually, unlike the previous [JSWSERVER-13756|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSWSERVER-13756], but it does appear to take several minutes before the system is able to rank all the issues.  In some cases a foreground index might also be required to update the indexes.\r\n* If only transitioning one of these issues, this problem does not appear to happen.  However having more than one JIRA user in the system is expected to happen, so the occurrence of these nearly simultaneous transitions is likely.\r\n* Feels like maybe we are hitting up against a limitation of multiple threads all trying to obtain a lock on the rank field of an issue\r\n\r\nh3.Workaround\r\n- Disable Bobswift plugin (which prevents the creation of the subtasks)\r\n- Manually create subtasks\r\n",

Additionally, some file types must be downloaded to view, which can also contribute to delay. On the security front, attached executables may lead to security issues when downloaded and run.\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nThere are third-party add-ons that accomplish this task (e.g., [Attachment Checker|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.akelesconsulting.jira.plugins.AttachmentChecker/server/overview.]).",

      "description": "h3. Summary\r\n\r\nWe want to have the dashboard shown on our wall monitor, however the lack of auto-refresh means that it is out of date very quickly, and thus largely useless.\r\n\r\nIf the contents of the board are updated, it does put a yellow \"click here to refresh the board\", but it does not actually refresh the board. Note that this behaviour is independent of the \"refresh interval\".\r\n\r\nthe behaviour does not change whether the interval is Never or 15 minutes. The yellow sign turns up soon after the board is out of date, but the board itself *never refreshes*.\r\n Somehow the javascript knows that there was an update, but the data doesn't come through and doesn't get displayed.\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# create a new dashboard on JIRA\r\n# create a new agile project in JIRA\r\n# create some new issues in the project and create a sprint\r\n# create a new project board to display current sprint\r\n# from JIRA dashboards, click add gadget and select Agile Wallboard gadget\r\n# select the agile project board to display from step 4\r\n# select 15 min refresh interval from the list.\r\n# create a new bug in the agile project and add it to the sprint\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n* The wallboard gadget will refresh after 15 mins and show the updates to from the Agile project sprint.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n* The wallboard will send a new request every 30 sec. will show a yellow sticker telling that the board has been updated, refresh or ignor.\r\n * The wall board data will not auto update.\r\n\r\nh3. Notes\r\n* I have tested this with Google Chrome Version 56.0.2924.87 (64-bit)",

Issue Summary\r\n\r\nWhen a user creates a sub-task in JIRA off an issue from a JIRA Agile project that already has a component field, the newly created sub-task does not inherit the parent issues Component.\r\n\r\nh5. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Create a test component in a project e.g. *Test Comp* that is an Agile project\r\n# Create an issue.\r\n# Add the *Test Comp* component to the issue created above.\r\n# Remove the \"Component/s\" field from issue create screen\r\n# Create a sub-task; make sure Component/s field is hidden on the issue create dialog\r\n\r\nh5. Affects Version\r\n\r\nThe above issue was observed in *JIRA 7.2.8, JIRA 7.3.x* and we can confirm that it works correctly in *JIRA 6.4.13* (the customer tested this on *JIRA 6.4.8*).\r\n\r\nh5. Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nThe sub-task would inherit the parent issue's component\r\n\r\nh5. Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nThe sub-task component field is empty and you would need to manually set it.\r\n\r\nh5. Workaround\r\n\r\n# You can manually set this.\r\n# You can use a plugin like Minyaa Suite which has a post function to make the Child issue inherit the parent issue's Component field.\r\n(i) _Please note that we do not provide support if you decide to proceed with the second suggestion._",
