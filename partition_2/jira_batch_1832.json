Sometimes a page ends up containing multiple versions of the software but only the latest release is being referenced (because developers forgot to delete the old attachments). There should be a way to detect \"orphaned\" attachments that are not referenced by any page across all of Confluence similar to how we can detect \"orphaned\" pages. I acknowledge the fact that some attachments may be accessed by external websites (and so shouldn't be removed) but in our case this is not the case and I suspect in most cases attachments that are not referenced on Confluence really are orphans.

Heading A\r\nh2. Heading B\r\nh1. Heading C\r\n{code}\r\n# Create a child page \"Child\" with this content:\r\n{code}\r\nh1. Heading D\r\nh2. Heading E\r\nh1. Heading F\r\n{code}\r\n# Export the space to PDF\r\n\r\nIn the resultant PDF:\r\n\r\n* \"Home\" is displayed as the prime heading (h1)\r\n* \"Heading A\" is displayed as h2, \"Heading B\" is displayed as h3, and so on\r\n* However, \"Child\" (the child page title) is displayed as h2 (not h1), \"Heading D\" is displayed as h3 and so on <-- this is the limitation\r\n\r\nIn other words, you can see that on the first page the headings are increased by one:\r\n\r\n||Wiki||PDF||\r\n|Page Title|h1|\r\n| \"h1.\"|h2|\r\n| \"h2.\"|h3|\r\n|...|...|\r\n\r\nFrom the second (child page) on, headings are increased by two:\r\n||Wiki||PDF||\r\n|Page Title| h2|\r\n|\"h1.\"|h3|\r\n|\"h2.\"|h4|\r\n|...|...|\r\n\r\n\r\nBecause of this reason it's not possible to do a senseful page numbering with css counters. If the headings would be shifted on all pages in the same way, this would be no problem.\r\n\r\nA suggestion would be that Page Titles always get h1 in the PDF export and the content headings are always only shifted by 1. Additionally (to keep the possibility to define something like a title page with the very first page title), the very first page title could get something like <h1 class=\"very_first_page_title\">.",

      "description": "We have consistently seen the following problem:\r\n\r\nIf you have notifications (watches, space watch or daily update email) set for a page, you will get the wrong name in the notification when someone moves a page in the wiki. For instance, let's say John updates a certain page. That email notification will correctly show John as the updater. Then, if Joe moves the same page to another location in the wiki space (without updating it), the notification that goes out will show that John made the move (presumably because John was the last person to update the page and Joe's name is not stored since he didn't make any updates).\r\n\r\nI posted this to the forums and others have found this to be reproducible.  Also, others have mentioned that the same thing may occur when pages are deleted.",
