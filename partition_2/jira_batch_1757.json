Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n# Run Confluence using Java 7, not Java 6 - Java 7 is listed as a supported platform\r\n# Import SSL certificate of the LDAP server into Confluence's JVM keystore as per normal procedure\r\n# Add an LDAP directory, attempt to configure using SSL\r\n# Observe the error message and log entry described above\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nUse Java 6\r\n\r\nh3. Cause\r\n\r\nI've pasted the original support case below, as it has a very detailed analysis of the cause:\r\n\r\nI am testing our upgrade to Confluence 4.x and I am finding that Confluence 4.x works fine with our configuration under Java 6, but fails under Java 7. If I shutdown, clear confluence-data/plugins-osgi-cache, switch to Java 6, and startup, it works. If I shutdown, clear confluence-data/plugins-osgi-cache, switch to Java 7, and startup it fails.\r\n\r\nIn our environment, we use ldaps:// configuration to tie Confluence user management to our OpenLDAP servers. I don't want to provide our configuration here as it includes our internal hostname and authentication which should not need to be shared to reproduce or understand this issue.\r\n\r\nWhen running under Java 7, the error I get during startup (Embedded Crowd synchronization) and when I attempt to login (which fails) is:\r\n\r\n{noformat}\r\nCaused by: java.lang.RuntimeException: Unable to set hostname verification on SSLSocket\r\n        at com.atlassian.crowd.directory.ssl.LdapHostnameVerificationSSLSocketFactory.makeUseLdapVerification(LdapHostnameVerificationSSLSocketFactory.java:85)\r\n        at com.atlassian.crowd.directory.ssl.LdapHostnameVerificationSSLSocketFactory.createSocket(LdapHostnameVerificationSSLSocketFactory.java:144)\r\n        at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke0(Native Method)\r\n        at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(NativeMethodAccessorImpl.java:57)\r\n        at sun.reflect.DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.java:43)\r\n        at java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Method.java:601)\r\n        at com.sun.jndi.ldap.Connection.createSocket(Connection.java:305)\r\n        at com.sun.jndi.ldap.Connection.<init>(Connection.java:201)\r\n        ... 41 more\r\nCaused by: java.lang.NoSuchMethodException: sun.security.ssl.SSLSocketImpl.trySetHostnameVerification(java.lang.String)\r\n        at java.lang.Class.getMethod(Class.java:1622)\r\n        at com.atlassian.crowd.directory.ssl.LdapHostnameVerificationSSLSocketFactory.makeUseLdapVerification(LdapHostnameVerificationSSLSocketFactory.java:80)\r\n        ... 48 more\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nAs I expect reproduction of our issue may be difficult, I performed my own investigation and found the following...\r\n\r\nIn this file:\r\n\r\ncrowd-ldap/src/main/java/com/atlassian/crowd/directory/ssl/LdapHostnameVerificationSSLSocketFactory.java\r\n\r\nIt has this method:\r\n\r\n{code}\r\n    ...\r\n    /**\r\n     * Accept a <code>sun.security.ssl.SSLSocketImpl</code> or a <code>com.sun.net.ssl.internal.ssl.SSLSocketImpl</code>\r\n     * and invoke <code>trySetHostnameVerification(\"ldap\")</code> through reflection.\r\n     */\r\n    static void makeUseLdapVerification(Socket s)\r\n    {\r\n        ...\r\n        try\r\n        {\r\n            Method m = c.getMethod(\"trySetHostnameVerification\", METHOD_ARG_TYPES);\r\n            m.invoke(s, \"ldap\");\r\n        }\r\n        catch (NoSuchMethodException e)\r\n        {\r\n            throw new RuntimeException(UNABLE_TO_SET_MESSAGE, e);\r\n        }\r\n        ...\r\n    }\r\n    ...\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nTracing the issue further by analyzing the Java source, I find that:\r\n\r\n- Java 6 provides a method sun.security.ssl.SSLEngineImpl.trySetHostnameVerification() which appears to be what Embedded Crowd is trying to find and use.\r\n- Java 7 does NOT provide this method.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the code works in Java 6, but fails in Java 7 with \"throw new RuntimeException(UNABLE_TO_SET_MESSAGE, e);\" which results in the stack trace we are receiving.\r\n\r\nMy conclusion is that the combination of Confluence 4.x + Java 7 + secure LDAP is not currently working. However, Confluence 4.x + Java 6 + secure LDAP does work. The Embedded Crowd implementation needs to be modified to support Java 7 + secure LDAP and tested.\r\n\r\nPlease analyze the above, confirm with the Embedded Crowd design team what the expectation is around why this method needs to be called and what it should do in Java 7, and document the problem on jira.atlassian.com using terminology which will be familiar to your team to expedite correction.\r\n\r\nFor now, I plan on proceeding with Java 6 at this time, with a hope to change to Java 7 in the future when this issue is addressed.\r\n\r\nThanks!",

If I hit Shift + 7 (this is / on an Icelandic layout) then the shortcut help is opened. Not what I expected.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n# Open up Confluence\r\n# Set your keyboard layout to Icelandic\r\n# Hit Shift + 7 \r\n# *** Shortcut help opened up. Expected focus to go to quick search ***\r\n\r\nIt should work the same, no matter what layout is configured. \r\n\r\n(The shortcut works in JIRA v4.3.2#616-r148546.)",
