The same scenario could happened to the PPT file too. You'll see this kind of error in the logs:\r\n{code}\r\nWARN [http-8534-4] [com.benryan.conversion.PPTSlideServlet] doGet Conversion task timed out for attachment : PK Presentation 2013-11-20.ppt with page number 3, waited : 300, now executing in background.\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nRefreshing the page (at times this has to be done twice) helps to render the affected PDF/PPT file once more. Viewing the individual PDF/PPT using viewfile macro in an individual page do not have the same problem. \r\n\r\nh5. Workaround\r\n\r\nTo force Confluence generate the slide images again:\r\n# Get the attachment ID for the attachment with the problem. To do so, please run the following SQL query in your Confluence database:\r\n{code:sql}select attachmentid from attachments where prevver is null and title = 'filename.ext';{code}\r\nPlease replace {{filename.ext}} with the filename with the problem.\r\n# Shutdown Confluence.\r\n# Go to the folder {{<CONFLUENCE_DATA>/viewfile/}}.\r\n# Remove all files containing the attachment id from step #1. Filenames will look like {{slide-1234-1}} where {{1234}} is the attachment id.\r\n# Start Confluence.\r\n# Go to the page containing the attachment embedded in it.
