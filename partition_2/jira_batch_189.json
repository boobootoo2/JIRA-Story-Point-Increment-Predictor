Environment\r\n * JIRA Software\r\n\r\nh3. Cause\r\n\r\nThe memory cache of the board doesn't contain a project ID, although the filter does, so the board is considered to be without a project and so it doesn't display the options. This cache is rebuilt every 30 minutes so the problem fades away.\r\nFor this reason, the problem doesn't affect all board but it does affect all users accessing the board.\r\n\r\n*The reason for the cache being incorrect is still unknown.*\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nWhile the problem is happening\r\n # Go to a board with the problem.\r\n\r\n*Somehow board cannot get the project ID* so Backlog is missing.\r\nh3.

      "description": "At my company we've recently begun using the Scrum agile methodology, and we've found that JIRA is not suited to tracking work by iteration / sprint. While versions can be used as iterations, this is confusing because iterations are an orthogonal concept. A particular problem we have with using versions for this purpose is that versions are specific to a single project (as they should be). However, our teams often work on multiple projects, and we track work across all these projects. Another difference is we usually determine the end date of a version by the estimates for assigned issues, while for iterations it is the opposite - we determine the end date first and then determine which issues it can contain.\r\n\r\nJIRA should allow iterations to be defined with a name, start date, and end date. Additionally, an iteration is not tied to one project, but may be assigned to any number of projects. Perhaps some sort of \"iteration schedule\" could be created, with projects assigned to an iteration schedule receiving all the iterations on that schedule. Alternatively, if sub-projects were supported (as per JRA-12241) an iteration created in a parent project could be inherited by the children.\r\n\r\nAny relevant reports should be included, such as burndown charts. In addition to tracking by time, it would also be nice to track by story points.\r\n\r\nOther functionality might be helpful. For example, at the end of a sprint I want to push any unfinished items to the next sprint. Items in progress need to be split, perhaps with separate subtasks automatically created?",

However, when I create new issue and start filling \"Epic Link\" field, i still can see my epic in dropdown list. Moreover, I can pick particular Epic, create issue within it and no system message/ error appears. Finally, when I look at my Closed Epic, I can see it's Issues in Epic field updated with the information about recently added issue.\r\n\r\nAs far as i'm concerned, the only way to eliminate my epic from Epic Link field's dropdown list is to mark it as done on my Scrum board.

These kind of processes have a lot of steps.  It hasn't seemed very useful to create workflows for the detailed steps of these processes... but, it is possible to use JQL queries to sift out the processes that are in similar stages, for example, those processes that are under legal review.  We would find it really useful to have a grid view of JIRA issues that we could configure with arbitrary JQL statements.  \r\n\r\nOf course we would want to be able to define multiple such views, with differing grid definitions.
