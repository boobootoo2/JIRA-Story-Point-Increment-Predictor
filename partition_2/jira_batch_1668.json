Summary\r\nWhen editing a page that has a List element that includes <p> tags, followed by a nested list, followed by more elements from the original list, pressing the return key in the first item (the one with the <p> tags) will always skip past the nested list and create a new higher level list item.\r\n\r\nh3. Environment\r\n* Chrome Version 43.0.2357.81 (64-bit)\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Open Chrome\r\n# Install Confluence 5.7.4\r\n# Install the source editor plugin\r\n# Create a page and paste the following storage format\r\n{code}<ol>\r\n  <li>Top Level OL Item 1<p>Press return at the end of this line</p>\r\n    <p>The carriage return should have created a new line in front of this element as the 2nd element of the top level list.</p>\r\n    <p>But it didn't</p>\u00a0<ol>\r\n      <li>Nested OL Item 1</li>\r\n      <li>Nested OL Item 2</li>\r\n      <li>Nested OL Item 3</li>\r\n    </ol>\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li>Top Level OL Item 2 (The carriage return WILL create a new line in front of this element)</li>\r\n  <li>Top Level OL Item 3</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n{code}\r\n# Close the Source Editor and hit enter on the directed line\r\n\r\nh3.

Actual Results\r\nA 2nd element is created, but it is inserted after the nested list\r\n\r\nh3. Notes\r\nThis will normally only occur after pasting a block of content into a list, as using shift+enter to move to a new line without creating a list element uses <br /> instead of placing the text inside of <p></p> tags. \r\n\r\nh3.Solution / Workaround\r\n* Use a browser other than Chrome \r\n** Firefox and Safari are not affected by this bug",

These pages seem to get re-migrated again if we update any plugin, enable/re-enable plugins followed by a restart.\r\n\r\nThis is polluting the change history of the pages because it adds another version on each page. It also appears that the attachments on those pages are getting re-indexed.\r\n\r\nI understand the fix may have been intentional but it's having some bad side-effects.\r\n\r\nAlso related:\r\n * CONF-35185\r\n * CONF-32837\r\n * -CONF-32318-\r\n\r\nh2. Workaround\r\n\r\nA workaround has been added to the description of related ticket CONF-32837, which provides a method via SQL to disable the remigration job on restarts. As with all database manipulation tasks, please be sure to test this on a non-Production environment first.\r\n\r\nIn the release of 5.10.8, a system variable is added to turn off the remigration behavior during startup. To use this feature:\r\n # open CONF_INSTALL_FOLDER/bin/setenv.sh (or setenv.bat under windows)\r\n # locate \"CATALINA_OPTS\" and add the below line to the file:\r\n CATALINA_OPTS=\"-Dconfluence.startup.remigration.disable=true $ \\{CATALINA_OPTS}\"\r\n # save the file and restart tomcat",

Proposal\r\nProvide the option to disable sending the changed content of a page on a per-page or per-space basis.\r\n\r\nh4.

Problem Definition\r\nAs of now in Confluence, the default decorators are stored and loaded from {{<Confluence-Installation>/confluence/decorators}} folder in the installation directory. Should the admin apply their custom layouts by modifying the files on this folder and not from the {{http://<ServerBaseURL>/admin/listdecorators.action}} page on the admin UI page, Confluence will then take these custom changes and indicate it as a {{default}} layout instead. \r\n\r\nDocumentation Reference: https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Customising+Site+and+Space+Layouts#CustomisingSiteandSpaceLayouts-Advancedcustomisations\r\n\r\n\\\\\r\nh5.

Comments are left on random places in the page, and an author would have to scroll through the entire page to find them.  Emails can be sent, but we receive so many emails about so many things - that just isn't a realistic way to track things.  The author needs to have a way to positively confirm that he/she has addressed all comments.  In my mind, I'm envisioning something similar to Microsoft Word's \"Reviewing Pane\".\r\n\r\nIdeally, there would be some sort of comment listing.  At a minimum, this should be at a page level, but even better would be for a subset of pages or Space level.  I'm thinking subset of pages because we may have several different documents within a space, with different authors responsible for each.  The ability to select one parent item (document) within a space's page tree and see all comments in that area would be extremely useful to ensuring everything gets addressed.",

Summary\r\nCreating a user macro with text formatting in Confluence will not work if there is a multiple lines.\r\n\r\nh3. How to replicate:\r\n# Create a user macro like [noprint macro| https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Example+User+Macro+-+NoPrint] (in this example, I have created a redcolor macro)\r\n#* Define its Template as {code}## @noparams\r\n<div class=\"redcolor\">$body</div>{code}\r\n# Define its formatting in both (in this example, formatting is giving the font color red and a font size):\r\n#* PDF Export Stylesheet\r\n#* Space Stylesheet\r\n!Capture.PNG!\r\n# Call this user macro in a page as so:\r\n!Capture1.PNG!\r\n# Export this page to PDF\r\n\r\nh3. What is expected:\r\nPDF export is the same as displayed in Confluence page (because of the same formatting defined in Space stylesheet and PDF Export stylesheet)\r\n\r\nh3. What actually happens:\r\nOnly the user macro that contains 1 lines work. The one with multiple lines does not have formatting anymore:\r\n!Capture2.PNG!\r\n\r\nh3. Causes\r\nOne line text with the macro, will return the element:\r\n{code}\r\n<div class=\"redcolor\">one line</div>\r\n{code}\r\nAs you can see, the text \"one line\" is directly enclosed under the element with the class \"redcolor\"\r\n\r\nHowever if there are more than one line, the text will be enclosed in the <p> element. \r\n{code}\r\n<div class=\"redcolor\">\r\n<p>one line</p>\r\n<p>two line</p>\r\n</div>\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nSomehow, the pdf css is not apply to the element which are not directly enclosed in the element class. \r\n\r\nh3. What CSS formattings are affected:\r\ncolor\r\nfont-size\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround:\r\nAs a workaround, add the following code so <p> element diretly under the class will be affected by the css\r\n{code}\r\n.redcolor p\r\n{\r\ncolor:red\r\n}\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nYou will need to add two css in the pdf css so it will work for both of the scenario:\r\n!Capture3.PNG!",
