That part's normal, expected behavior.\r\n\r\nIf I then type something, though, the highlighted text is not replaced, it is appended. In any other word processor I've seen, typing when you have text selected will replace it. The same happens in Confluence's editing mode when you're not using the find/replace feature, so it's inconsistent within the product itself.\r\n\r\nI think the correct behavior is to replace the text that is highlighted, whether I'm doing the replacement using the GUI or whether I've highlighted it with my pointer as well and just started typing.",

      "description": "When setting up an application link from a standalone Confluence instance (v 5.5.2) and a standalone Jira instance (6.2.1) running on the same windows server, Basic authentication can be configured, but the forms for OAuth and Trusted Applications do not load. I attempt to configure OAuth by navigating to the application links admin panel and clicking \"Edit\" on the application link that I previously set up. (I'll refer to this situation as the \"problem case\")\r\n\r\nApplication links to jira.atlassian.com _can_ be configured (with anonymous access), and when I edit the application link, I see the OAuth and Trusted Application forms as expected. (I'll refer to this situation as the \"success case\")\r\n\r\n\r\n*What I Expect To See*\r\n==================\r\nIt seems to me that either there is a bug relating to the Application Link editing dialog box, or there is something wrong with the way that Confluence and/or Jira has been configured causing an error. \r\n\r\nIf the former, I expect to be able to configure OAuth for the application link between the confluence and Jira instance configured as above.\r\n\r\nIf the latter, I expect to see an error message that would give me some clue about what is going wrong so that as the system administrator, I can correct it. \r\n\r\n\r\n*What I See:*\r\n==========\r\nOrganized by tabs and buttons selected from the Edit dialog box. See screen shots for details of a few of them :\r\n|                                        | Trusted Application |    OAuth      | Basic        |\r\n| Outgoing Authentication | &#x2717; loading wheel          |&#x2717; loading wheel |&#x2713; form renders\r\n| Incoming Authentication  |&#x2713; form renders           |&#x2713; form renders | &#x2717; loading wheel\r\n\r\n*More Details*\r\n===========\r\n*What _Does_ Work*\r\n---------------------------\r\nIn the problem case, I have successfully used the Jira Issue plugin with Basic Authentication, and confirmed from the Jira log that Jira is being accessed from Confluence using the account configured with the Basic Authentication. \r\n\r\nIn the success case, anonymously available content from jira.atlassian.com was loaded. \r\n\r\n\r\n*What do I mean by \"indefinitely\"*\r\n--------------------------------------------------\r\nI open the dialog box, start a timer, and at 30 minutes the loading wheel is still turning. \r\n\r\n\r\n*Attachments*\r\n--------------------\r\nUnless otherwise specified in the file name, the screenshots are of the dialog box opened when editing the problem case application link. \r\n\r\n*Network activity*\r\n-------------------------\r\nI inspected the network activity (using Chrome developer tools) to see if that gave me any hints - I haven't ruled out configuration problems. In both the problem case and the success case the only network activity once the dialog box has stopped loading is a call every 30 seconds to <base url>mywork/latest/status/notification/count which returns {\"count\":0,\"timeout\":30,\"maxTimeout\":300}. I don't expect this to be very interesting, but what it get from that is that network-activity wise the two dialog boxes (the problem case dialog box and the success case dialog box) are acting in the same way \r\n\r\n*If More Information Is Required*\r\n=========================\r\nBasic Authentication doesn't meet our requirements as we have confidential data in Jira that we need to restrict on a per confluence user basis. It is a high priority for us to get the application link configured. If there is any other testing or data collection that I can do on my end to help with fixing this issue, please ask. \r\n",

I'm putting this here because, well, there's no \"SDK\" project.\r\n\r\nAccording to:\r\n\r\nhttps://developer.atlassian.com/display/DOCS/Install+the+Atlassian+SDK+on+a+Linux+or+Mac+System\r\n\r\nThe tarball installation consists of these steps:\r\n\r\nsudo tar -xvzf atlassian-plugin-sdk-4.0.tar.gz -C /opt\r\n\r\nThe contents of the tarball have borked permissions.  Since you need to be root to install in /opt (hence the sudo), all files will be owned by root.\r\n\r\nSince you likely *aren't* going to develop as root (you shouldn't), then the permissions in /opt/atlassian-plugin-sdk/bin won't let you run anything.  Nor will /opt/atlassian-plugin-sdk/apache-maven/bin.\r\n\r\nThe shell scripts there should all be mode 755.\r\n\r\nAlso, why on earth are all the directories mode 777?  People shouldn't mess with these files, should they?\r\n\r\nAnyway, the mode thing on the bin dir files kept people here from actually being able to use it.  This is a bug, in my opinion.\r\n\r\nIf you think it's not, then update the docs to indicate that you will have to do all your development as root. :-)\r\n\r\nThis was the case for both:\r\n\r\nATLAS Version:    4.2.10\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\nATLAS Version:    5.0.2\r\n",

As people work in confluence they think of issues that should be opened. If they can click a button in confluence that displays a popup of the create issue form used in the Jira Macros, they can quickly enter an issue, and continue working within confluence. This improves productivity and helps to ease the transition of new confluence/jira users.\r\n\r\nFunctionality:\r\n- Button is available from any page\r\n- Create form remembers the last app link and project used. This is very important. If the user is working heavily in one project, he doesn't want to have to select the app link and project every time he is going to create an issue.\r\n- It does NOT move the user from the page he is working on. It is a popup.\r\n- Admin can turn on/off display of the button. Or maybe configurable by space? \r\n- It does NOT create a link in a confluence page.",

However the macro definition requires it to be of type {{spacekey}}:\r\n{code}\r\n<parameter name=\"spaces\" type=\"spacekey\" multiple=\"true\">\r\n    <alias name=\"space\"/>\r\n</parameter>\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nTherefore the parameter in the generated page should probably look like this:\r\n{code}\r\n<ac:parameter ac:name=\"spaces\"><ri:space ri:space-key=\"TEST\" /></ac:parameter>\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nThis causes various issues with our content transformers but also in a stock Confluence when reverting such a page to its initial version. \r\n\r\n*Steps to reproduce:*\r\n# In a fresh Confluence 5.5 installation create a new space with the documentation space blueprint.\r\n# Edit the Getting Started page (I added some letters) and save it.\r\n# Now using the page history revert back to version 1 and confirm.\r\n\r\n*Expected result:*\r\nVersion 1 has been restored and user is redirected to viewpage action.\r\n\r\n*Actual result:*\r\nA stacktrace (see below) is rendered on the screen and the revert operation has not been committed (current page version is still the same).\r\n\r\nFull stacktrace when

Often there is no real content for this page, but leaving the page blank just so  that you can create the appropriate tree structure doesn't feel correct.

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFCLOUD-33850].\n  {panel}\n\nThe Documentation theme is designed so the \"Powered by Atlassian\" footer is always visible and thus very prominent. (The windows is separated in three elements, the header, the footer and the \"page\" (splitter) with the sidebar to the left and page content to the right. These three are always visible, at least on Chrome/FF).\r\n\r\nCurrently (5.5.2), the footer div's \"footer-body\" section has a min-height property with a value of 44px, meaning that the footer will take up an effective 55 pixels vertically on the screen. For many screens, especially laptops and mobile devices, this is far too much. Not only is it annoying for the user to have that much real estate dedicated to a non-informative footer. Worse is, it is aesthetically displeasing to look at.\r\n\r\nThe new default look moves the footer to the bottom of the page, so it is only visible when the page is scrolled all the way down. This way, it doesn't matter that the page has a huge, prominent footer. However, for the Documentation Theme, the always-visible footer should not be much larger than what is required to display the \"Powered by Atlassian\" line of text.\r\n\r\nRemoving the min-height css property of the footer-body section makes the footer adjust size automatically to display the \"Powered by Atlassian\" line of text with sufficient padding. The result is much more aesthetically pleasing than before. \r\n\r\nTo reproduce: \r\n1) Open a page that uses the Documentation Theme (I assume Chrome in the following, because it has neat Developer tools).\r\n2) Observe the excessive height of the footer, which has a lot of negative space below the \"Powered by Atlassian\" line.\r\n3) Open up Chrome's \"developer tools\" panel.\r\n4) Make sure the \"Elements\" tab is selected, and \"Styles\" are presented to the right.\r\n5) In the elements display, open body -> div full-height-container -> div footer -> section footer-body. (or right-click the footer and select \"show info on element\".)\r\n6) With section footer-body styles displayed, scroll down and find min-height : 44px. Disable this property.\r\n7) Resize the window to force update, and observe how the footer looks much better.\r\n\r\nNote: Confluence 5.5.3 (m2) adds a margin: 10px to the <ul> element in order to \"even out\" the excessive negative space below the \"Powered by\" line in 5.5.2. The footer is now less ugly, but still takes up much more real estate than needed to display the footer, which still makes the user think that Atlassians are major douchebags with their major need for showing off.\r\n\r\nNote 2: Please check this issue on a screen with a vertical resolution of < 800 pixels to get the point.",
