Our people travel much and want to have their documents offline on their own devices with automatic sync \u00e1 la dropbox.\r\n\r\nWe do not want to introduce owncloud.org or similar services as a parallel solution. Also 3rd party webdav sync clients do not offer the level of usability required by our users.\r\n\r\nWhen can we expect something similar for Confluence?\r\nI assume that syncing the page content and page meta content is a bigger issue. However, this is not really necessary in a first step. Already the syncing of attachments in a folder(page) and sub folder (sub pages) would be tremendously helpful.\r\n\r\nIt would be great, if this can find its way into the product roadmap - I assume that we are not the only one looking for alternatives.\r\n\r\nThanks",

[See the corresponding bug report|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFCLOUD-32116].\n  {panel}\n\nFirst let me say I have never had a site that was so difficult to report an issue.  EVERY page should have an email link and/or a telephone number to go DIRECTLY to technical support.  Then once I go to help I find it is focused on instructors not students and I have to go through a sign up for another account to submit an issue.  There is a LONG list of forums you support and none clearly state JHU Blackboard.  I have been in IT for close to 20 years and by far this is the worst for customer support.  I don't even know if the issue I am having is something for you as the company who creates the code for the Blackboard site or the JHU administrators or if you are the same people.  However, it works you have the issue and expect you to work with whomever to get it resolved.\r\n\r\nI went to the \"Edit personal information\" page in Blackboard.  I see where it allows me to change my first name but when I hit submit I get a database eror.  I tried it in class on the JHU network and at home with the same result.\r\nA database error occurred.\r\n\r\nFor reference, the Error ID is 175193d5-d423-461b-9f5a-e1f7dbcfb9b9.\r\n\r\nAlso by default everything from Blackboard goes to my work email and I can find no place to change it to my JHU email.

If the Page exists, don't display it as Page Not Found, especially when user has not logged in.\r\n2. Or, at least, when accessing\"removepagenotification.action\" page without logged in session, it should redirect to Login page. Because no one will be able to manage without logging in.\r\n3. Simply, redirect to login page where user credential is mandatory.\r\n4. Or, you could redirect to login page if you see \"src=email\" parameter in URL, which means the user is registered user of the system because the user received an email regarding this page.\r\n\r\nAtlassian people keep their login always, so you might not see this often.\r\nHowever, as a external customer, we don't keep login for CAC.\r\n\"Page Not Found\" message was improper in this case.\r\n\r\nPlease, improve this behavior.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n",

Further investigation by an admin will show that in these cases a parent or grandparent has viewing restrictions applied.\r\n\r\nIt would appear that inherited permissions are not indexing properly.\r\n\r\nIn most cases I can confirm that the affected content had also been moved to be beneath the restricted parent (or grandparent). I'm not sure if this is always the case for this issue but it could be. I would certainly start trying to reproduce the problem by moving unrestricted content to beneath a restricted grand-parent and see if the refactoring code updates the permissions in the index.\r\n\r\nThis is raised as critical because it can result in a leak of the titles of restricted content.",

The 9:50am spike in throughput seems to lead to a ramp up in GC activity. Perhaps related to JIRA responses being large or our processing of them inefficient in object creation (see CONF-32067). Response times look reasonable at this point.\r\n\r\nThen around 10:02am response times start to really spike and throughput drops. It looks like this results in an outage to EAC users at this point. These long lived calls may also be contributing to the GC pain as objects are hanging around too long and surviving too many GC sweeps.\r\n\r\nI think we need a way to both limit how many concurrent JIRA connections we allow and to timeout them out where necessary.\r\n\r\nDoing this in conjunction with the other 'coathanger' integrations, such as the JIRA issues header would be really nice. At the moment trying to throttle and manage the connections from Confluence to JIRA is very difficult.\r\n\r\n",
