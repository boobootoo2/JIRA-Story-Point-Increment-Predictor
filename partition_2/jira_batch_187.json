In order to mitigate this issue we implemented the following board filter which works great in clearing out the Board from issues which were released:\r\n{code:java}\r\nproject in (<redacted>) AND (status != Done AND (fixVersion is EMPTY OR fixVersion != \"Unreleasable Work\")) OR (status = Done and fixVersion in unreleasedVersions() and fixVersion != \"Unreleasable Work\") ORDER BY Rank ASC, STATUS ASC\r\n\r\n{code}\r\nHowever, after we implemented this filter, I noticed that the Control Chart gets wiped with every release. I am assuming this is because the Control Chart uses the current state of the board filter and not keeping track of the boards history. Would it be possible to start storing the Control Chart data in a way which would take historical states into consideration?\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nAlternatively, is there an alternative way for me to hide tickets from appearing in the Done column indefinitely and keep the Control Chart in-tact?\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for your response!",

Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nBasically this might happen in the following scenario:\r\n* You have Board A with filter \"project = A\". You have Sprint 1 with issue A-1, A-2 inside it. The Sprint 1 has to be a future Sprint otherwise it correctly shows up in the report.\r\n* You have Board B with filter \"project = B\". You have Sprint 2 with issue B-1,B-2 inside it. The Sprint 2 has to be a future Sprint otherwise it correctly shows up in the report.\r\n\r\nIf issue A-1 is moved to Sprint B it means that Sprint B will contain 1 issue that match the filter of Board A, thus will make Sprint B APPEAR in board A. If that happen then the velocity report of board A will include Sprint B too. \r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nVelocity Report should only show sprints from other boards if the issues were moved between active sprints, not in planning phase (between future sprints).\r\nAs moving issues to-from sprints affects velocity (committed/completed), the report should show it accordingly.\r\n\r\nh3.

As we follow the Git Flow development model, we find ourselves rebasing our feature branches on the `develop` branch daily. The obsolete (and unreachable) commits still show on the Git integration section on the\u00a0issue. This is confusing, especially if the number of commits is large, and if the number of rebases is also large, as I end up seeing dozens and dozens of commits, instead of the real, \"reachable\" commits.\r\n\r\nI have used JIRA (on-premise) integrated with on-premise Stash, and I am quite sure that we never had this issue.\r\n\r\nThe support engineer I spoke with in the linked service desk issue adviced me to overcome this by forcing a complete syncing. This works, but this is merely a workaround, as I have to do this all the time.\r\n\r\nI would suggest\u00a0enhancing your Github integration by implementing the same behaviour you are already providing when integrating with Stash (and presumably Bitbucket as well). I believe that it greatly degrades the integration you are providing.\r\n\r\n\u00a0",
