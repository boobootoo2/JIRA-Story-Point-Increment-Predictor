This is good, and expected functionality.\r\n\r\nThe issue is that the notification sent (at least in 5.6.3) is rather unclear about which exact task was marked complete. The notification shows the entire list of tasks, with some very subtle formatting showing the one task marked complete. \r\n\r\nWhen there are many tasks on a list, some checked and some unchecked, it can become very confusing to know which task has been marked complete.\r\n\r\nFor example, see the attached PDF - one of the tasks was marked complete, which one was it? (Hint, it's on page 3).\r\n\r\nIdeally, the formatting in the notification email would be much more visible for task marked completed, or alternatively the tasks marked complete would be the only tasks showing (although I do like seeing the entire list as it motivates other users to close their tasks...!).",

The implementation seems inconsistent as annotation seems to be the preferred way to write listeners, but the Team Space uses both the annotation and listener approaches. I'd like to be consistent. I'm also cautious as there are clear warning on https://developer.atlassian.com/confdev/confluence-plugin-guide/confluence-blueprints/custom-actions-with-the-blueprint-api \"Deprecation Warning\r\nThe AbstractCreateBlueprintPageAction is no longer being used internally and is slated for removal in a future release. Please let us know via the Feedback form if your plugin currently extends this action, or if you plan to extend it.\" and I want to make sure I'm triggering off the recommended event but there is NO DOCUMENTATION on how this should be done. In fact, the only reference I can find of the SpaceBlueprintHomePageCreateEvent is in the Team Space Blueprint source code.\r\nCan you please provide the documentation for the createcontent api?",

CONTENTID is all NULL instead.\r\n\r\nh5.

Important note:\r\nThe original bug in the upgrade task has been fixed. This means customers upgrading from Confluence versions lower then 5.3 to 5.4.4+ should no longer be effected by this.  \r\n\r\nHowever if you have previously upgraded from an older version of Confluence and are effected by this problem upgrading again to Confluence 5.4.4+ will NOT rerun the upgrade task. Therefore for customers in this situation it is still necessary to run the workaround, upgrading alone is not sufficient to fix this problem.",
