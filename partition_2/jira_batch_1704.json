Steps to create the situation\r\n# Create a page in Space 'A'\r\n# The new page should be named with Special Character so that the URL to access the page will be the non-pretty URL (/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=xxxxxxx)\r\n# Put a view restriction to the new page so that only the author can see it\r\n# Create a new user 'Sam'\r\n\r\nh6. Situation:\r\n'Sam' has just joined the company. He is given the link to the new page ({{<base-URL>/pages.viewpage.action?pageId=xxxxxxx}}). However, he doesn't have permission to view the page. He needs the Space Administrator's help to add him to the page's view restriction so that he can view the page. But there's no way for him to know the Space name or where the view restriction is applied (same page or parent page) in order to inform the Space Administrator.\r\nThe Space Administrator/Sam needs to contact the DBA to find out the page name, space name, and page restriction by providing the pageId.\r\n\r\nh6. Summary:\r\nThis procedure is time-consuming and inefficient because the user needs to find DBA every time this kind of scenario is encountered. It'll be great improvement in Confluence if there's more information provided in the restricted page such as:\r\n- Space location\r\n- Page that prevent access to it\r\n- Page name\r\n\r\nThese informations can be used by Confluence Administrator or Space Administrator to grant access to a restricted page without having to contact the DBA.",

[See the corresponding bug report|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFCLOUD-33035].\n  {panel}\n\n_This was originally posted as CORE-196, but since i don't have access to edit my own submission under CORE, and it isn't indexed by search engines, i probably wasn't supposed to (be able to) submit tickets there.  This is an SDK issue, and thus spans confluence, jira, and others, but there's no SDK project that i have permission to update, so please move this ticket to the right place if necessary.  Instead of simply leaving the ticket where it was and letting Atlassian update/move it as desired, i'm re-posting here, because i'd like this issue to be indexed by search engines so that others can discover it when they have similar concerns._\r\n\r\nI downloaded atlassian-plugin-sdk-4.2.18.tar.gz, and the permissions are all wrong. I'd have checked the .deb or .rpm versions as well, but Atlassian doesn't offer direct download links for them.\r\n\r\nSome files have an arbitrary UID. I imagine that this is the UID of the user someone from Atlassian uses to create the files. Note UID 502 (GID 20), below.\r\n{code}\r\n>>> ls -l\r\ntotal 16\r\ndrwxr-xr-x  7 root root 4096 Mar 24 13:14 apache-maven\r\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 root root 4096 Mar 24 13:14 bin\r\n-rwxrwxrwx  1  502   20    3 Feb 25 16:37 installtype.txt\r\ndrwxr-xr-x 42 root root 4096 Mar 24 13:14 repository\r\n\r\n>>> ls -l repository \r\ntotal 160\r\ndrwxrwxrwx  3 502 20 4096 Feb 25 16:37 args4j\r\ndrwxrwxrwx  5 502 20 4096 Feb 25 16:37 asm\r\ndrwxrwxrwx  3 502 20 4096 Feb 25 16:37 backport-util-concurrent\r\ndrwxrwxrwx  3 502 20 4096 Feb 25 16:37 biz\r\ndrwxrwxrwx  3 502 20 4096 Feb 25 16:37 classworlds\r\n...\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nSome files and directories are group- and world-writable.

Since we do not use LDAP in our Confluence instance, I am following Adrian Reid's suggestion in the aforementioned webpage's conversation and am posting this feature request. I would think it would be straightforward since both the username and email address should be unique and are tied on the same Confluence user profile. Implementing this would avoid a lot of confusion as people can use either the username or email address to reset passwords but are required to use the username for login as we have set up our instance. I recall that we could have set up the instance to accept the email address. I don't want to be limited to either choice. Please set it up so that they could use either for login.",

      "description": "If your Confluence is using the wrong collation in Microsoft SQL Server it *shouldn't* be possible to upgrade to version 5.2.3  or latest due the constraint check we added to block the upgrade, however those constraints are no longer working because the upgrade is no longer being blocked as it used to.\r\n\r\nh4. Steps to reproduce:\r\n# Set up  a Confluence under version 5.2.3.\r\n# Make sure to use the \"SQL_Latin1_General_CP1_CI_AS\" collation instead of \"SQL_Latin1_General_CP1_CS_AS\".\r\n# Once this Confluence is up and running, upgrade it to version 5.2.3 or latest.\r\n# The upgrade should fail due the constraint's we added around user mapping table, however it will work without problems.\r\n\r\nh4. Diagnostic\r\nRun the below query against your Confluence MS SQL server database:\r\n{code:SQL}\r\nSELECT object_name(object_id) as TableName, name as ColumnName, collation_name\r\nFROM sys.columns\r\nWHERE collation_name <> 'SQL_Latin1_General_CP1_CS_AS'\r\nAND object_name(object_id) NOT LIKE 'sys%' \r\nAND object_name(object_id) NOT LIKE 'queue%'\r\nAND object_name(object_id) NOT LIKE 'file%'\r\n{code}\r\nIf the above return any results means your database is using the wrong collation.\r\n\r\nh4. Work Around\r\nThere are a few know methods we suggest our customers to use to address this:\r\n(!) *Always* have a backup of your database before trying any of the below work around.\r\n(i) Below methods will require some database knowledge in MsSQL Server, if possible engage your DBA in below activities.\r\n# The resolution method provided in [this|https://confluence.atlassian.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=412483920] KB which is not feasible to large instances since it relies on XML backup to create a clone instance.\r\n# Install a fresh Confluence in the same version, making sure that this version is with the right collation as per our [documentation|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Database+Setup+for+SQL+Server]. After that dummy instance is up do a few actions in this instance (like and watch a page to create a few AO tables) then use a data migration tool to migrate the data from the instance with the wrong collation to the dummy instance that should be using the correct collation.\r\n# Follow this [guide|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/CONFKB/Collation+Conflict+When+Creating+Pages] that teaches on how to manually fix the problem, which is a manual task and will be a very time consuming activity.\r\n# Atlassian Experts, since they can provide a hands on assistance to address this (their services will be subject to a quote).\r\n# The [collation changer tool|http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/12753/SQL-Server-2000-Collation-Changer], which is a non supported tool that might result in data loss.\r\n(i) We had good feedback from customers that tried the above tool, they didn't had nay data loss and the tool worked against SQL Server 2k5,2k8 and 2k12, even with those feedbacks this tool still should be used as a last resort, in case you decide for this option  you will be using it at their own risk.",

Steps to reproduce:\r\n# Setup  a Confluence under version 5.2.3.\r\n# Make sure to use the \"SQL_Latin1_General_CP1_CI_AS\" collation instead of \"SQL_Latin1_General_CP1_CS_AS\".\r\n# Once this Confluence is up and running, add a few pages and create a few users.\r\n# Watch the pages with those new users.\r\n(i) At this point everything will work fine.\r\n!beforeUpUI.PNG|thumbnail!\r\n# Upgrade Confluence to Confluence 5.4.3 (or latest).\r\n# Log on with one of the created users in step 3.\r\n# If you go to a page you watched you will see that your user is no longer watching that page.\r\n!afterUpUI.PNG|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nh4. Diagnostic\r\n\r\nRun the below query against your Confluence MS SQL server database:\r\n{code:SQL}\r\nSELECT object_name(object_id) as TableName, name as ColumnName, collation_name\r\nFROM sys.columns\r\nWHERE collation_name <> 'SQL_Latin1_General_CP1_CS_AS'\r\nAND object_name(object_id) NOT LIKE 'sys%' \r\nAND object_name(object_id) NOT LIKE 'queue%'\r\nAND object_name(object_id) NOT LIKE 'file%'\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nIf the above return any results means your database is using the wrong collation.\r\n\r\nh4. Notes \r\nIf the users re add themselves as watchers the function will work normally.\r\nIn the UI the user is no longer watching a page after the upgrade, however we are still able to see data in the notifications table:\r\nBefore Upgrading:\r\n!beforeUp.PNG|thumbnail!\r\nAfter Upgrading:\r\n!afterUp.PNG|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nh4. Workaround\r\n# Restore your pre-upgrade backups\r\n# Fix the collation in the database by following the steps [here|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/CONFKB/Collation+Conflict+When+Creating+Pages]\r\n# While you're there, ensure everything else in [this document|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Database+Setup+for+SQL+Server] is set correctly\r\n# Try the upgrade again\r\n\r\nNB: Once the upgrade is done the watches will be lost and there is no way to retrieve them. You must restore your backups from before the upgrade and start the process again.",

Furthermore, multiple issues can be created from highlighted text in a table. \r\n\r\nh5. Scenario\r\nIt is discovered that if we are to create JIRA issues from a second table, the issues were not added into the table. On JIRA side, issues were created successfully without any error. The following error message will occurs:\r\n{noformat}\r\nxxx issues has been created, but there are problems in adding them to the page. You can manually add them later using JIRA macro.\r\n{noformat}\r\nPlease refer to attachment {{CSP119754-JIRA_Issues_on_2nd_table.png}} for more details.\r\n\r\nh5. Steps to reproduce\r\nConsider the following steps to reproduce the issue:\r\n# Create a table with 5 rows and add random text on each rows\r\n# Highlight the text on the first row and click on JIRA icon\r\n# Select to create 5 issues on the table\r\n# Observe that 5 issues is created and added into the table\r\n# Create another table with 5 rows and add random text\r\n# Highlight the text on the first row and click on JIRA icon\r\n# Select to create 5 issues on the table\r\n# The error message will be displayed and nothing is added on the second table\r\n# Observe that the JIRA issues are successfully created on JIRA side\r\n\r\nThis issue can be reproduced locally on test instance.\r\n\r\nh5.
