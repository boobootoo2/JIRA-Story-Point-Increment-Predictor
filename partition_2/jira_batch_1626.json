      "description": "h3. Summary\r\n\r\nWhen you insert a link that contains umlaut or cyrillic characters via {{Insert more content > Link > Web link}} or the shortcuts {{\u2318+K}} / {{CTRL+K}}, the link changes so that Confluence encodes the percentage (%) symbol as {{%25}}. This renders the link to be unusable.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n # Correct link inserted into a Confluence page: [https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Die_L%C3%B6wen]\r\n # Incorrect link after saving the page and clicking on the link: [https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Die_L%25C3%25B6wen]\r\n\r\nYou can see the % symbol in the original link has been replaced as {{%25}}.\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nOption 1\r\n # Create a new page and insert a web link via one of the methods below:\r\n ** {{Insert more content > Link > Web link}}\r\n ** {{\u2318+K}} / {{CTRL+K}}\r\n # Insert this URL into the 'Address' field: [https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Die_L%C3%B6wen]\r\n # Insert any text into the the 'Link text' field.\r\n # Click on \"Insert\".\r\n # Save the page.\r\n # Try to open the link.\r\n\r\nOption 2\r\n # Create a new page and paste a web link\r\n # Edit the link and see that the 'Address' and 'Link text' field have not changed\r\n # Change the 'Link text' field to new text\r\n # Save the link\r\n # Edit the link again\r\n # The URL in the 'Address' field has now been changed\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nThe link on the page should direct you to the correct page: [https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Die_L%C3%B6wen]\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nThe link directs you to an invalid page: [https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Die_L%25C3%25B6wen]\r\nh3. Notes\r\n\r\nTested in Confluence 5.9.14. The functionality works as expected\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\n-Option 1: Replace all {{%}} signs in links with spaces instead-\r\n # -Take: {{[https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Die_L%C3%B6wen]}} URL-\r\n # -Change to: {{[https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Die_L] C3 B6wen}}-\r\n\r\nOption 1: Paste the link into the editor instead of using insert link dialog.\r\n * In this method you cannot modify the link text, so the link text will be automatically set based on the url\r\n\r\nOption 2: Use square brackets to insert the link.\u00a0[\u00a0]\r\n # Type \"[\"\r\n # Type\u00a0the text you want for your link in the editor, for example \"My Link\"\r\n # Type a \"|\"\r\n # *Type*\u00a0the url\r\n # Type \"]\" to complete the link.\r\n # Save or preview the page to confirm it works.\r\n # *Important!* Don't open the link dialog for this link. If you do, the link will be double-encoded.\r\n\r\nFor step 4, you could also try pasting the url but this might have less success since the url will be converted to a link automatically and you might have to first undo that automatic conversion, which in turn may cause the closing \"]\" to have no effect. See option 3 instead.\r\n\r\nOption 3\r\n # Paste the URL into the editor.\r\n # Press undo to undo any automatic link creation/extraction so you see the original URL.\r\n # If the URL is still a link, click it, and click \"Unlink\" to return it back to regular text.\r\n # At the beginning of the link, type [ followed by `Escape` to exit the Link Autocomplete\r\n # Type the text to display for the link followed by \"|\"\r\n # Now your link should look like this\r\n ## !Screen Shot 2017-05-11 at 7.37.39 AM.png|width=379,height=48!\r\n # Click at the end of the link and type \"]\" to complete the link. This should auto-convert it to a link with the desired text.\r\n # Save or preview the page to confirm it works.\r\n # *Important!* Don't open the link dialog for this link. If you do, the link will be double-encoded.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nOption 4: Using the Source Editor to change links after adding them\r\n # Install the [Confluence Source Editor|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.atlassian.confluence.plugins.editor.confluence-source-editor/server/overview] (free add-on)\r\n # Edit the page\r\n # Click on the {{<>}} icon in the top right\r\n # Find the *href=* attribute that contains the '%25' in the URL\r\n # Replace it with just '%'\r\n # Apply the changes and save the page",

Problem definition:\r\nWhen you create a JIRA macro and put in a search filter, you are not allowed to hit insert until you hit the search button.

Suggestion:\r\nThus, this can cause confusion between the users. Make the Insert button be disabled until the search button is clicked when the search filter criteria is edited in the same way as it is disabled when initially creating a new JIRA macro so that people do not fall into the same \"trap\" or insert a warning that if they hit Insert without searching before, it will not update the filter.\r\n",

Summary\r\nIf you enable Collaborative Editing in Confluence 6.x and create two blog posts with identical titles in the same space (whether they're created on the same day or not), Confluence throws an error message saying:\r\n{quote}A page with the title 'blog 1' already exists in this space. Enter a different title for your page.{quote}\r\n\r\nIn short, this means the behaviour with Collaborative Editing turned on is as such:\r\n# Two blog posts with identical titles set for the same day cannot be saved.\r\n# Two blog posts with identical titles set for different days cannot be saved.\r\n\r\nThe behaviour is different with Collaborative Editing turned off / in Confluence 5.x, whereby the results are as such:\r\n# Two blog posts with identical titles set for the same day cannot be saved.\r\n# Two blog posts with identical titles set for different days *can* be saved.\r\n\r\nThis change is not mentioned anywhere in the [Confluence 6.0 Release Notes|https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/confluence-6-0-release-notes-844235309.html].\r\n\r\nh3.

Why this is important\r\n\r\nThis would be useful for customers that want to add the current date or any other dynamic content in exported documents.\r\n\r\nh3.

Changing this order later is unable to raise any blockers\r\n            // in production.\r\n            Message o1Name = o1.getName();\r\n            if (o1Name == null || o1Name.getKey() == null)\r\n                return 1;  // push o1 to bottom\r\n\r\n            Message o2Name = o2.getName();\r\n            if (o2Name == null || o2Name.getKey() == null)\r\n                return -1;  // push o2 to bottom\r\n\r\n            return o1Name.getKey().compareTo(o2Name.getKey());\r\n        });\r\n{code}\r\nWhich is copied from Confluence code.\r\n\r\nConfluence will throw the following\u00a0error message:\r\n{code:java}\r\nComparison method violates its general contract!\r\n{code}\r\nThat basically means that the comparator is not written correctly.\r\nh3. Environments\r\n\r\nAttached a test class to reproduce the error: [^ContractViolationTest.java]\r\n - on Windows 10,\r\n - java version \"1.8.0_111\" Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_111-b14), Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM (build 25.111-b14, mixed mode)\r\n - Important: it only breaks if collection size is >= 32\r\n\r\nh3. A possible fix in Confluence\r\n\r\nSwitching the +1 and -1 return values in the comparator's two if blocks fixes the problem. \r\n Note that this change makes \"null key\" cases appear before \"not-null key\" cases in the sorted list. It does not affect the original order of objects where the key is not-null.\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nAdding this JVM system property fixes the issue:\r\n -Djava.util.Arrays.useLegacyMergeSort=true\r\nh3. References\r\n * TimSort has been introduced in Java 7, it is a stable sort that was designed for relatively expensive comparison operations. Only used for sorting objects, not primitives. Its problematic code path is only reached for collections with size >= 32. See [http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4018332/is-java-7-using-tim-sort-for-the-method-arrays-sort]\r\n * Exception might be caused by non-transitive comparators: [http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8327514/comparison-method-violates-its-general-contract]\r\n * Atlassian has seen something similar, too: [https://confluence.atlassian.com/fishkb/comparison-method-violates-its-general-contract-387941517.html]\r\n * Oracle has open issues related to this, promised to be fixed in Java 9: [http://bugs.java.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=7075600]\r\n * See: com.atlassian.confluence.api.impl.service.longtasks.LongTaskFactory#buildStatus",

Scenario1\r\n# Copy a PDF file in Finder.app\r\n# Open a Confluence page in edit mode\r\n# Press {{Cmd + V}} in the Confluence page\r\n\r\nh4. Scenario2\r\n# Open Terminal.app\r\n# Execute the following commands\r\n{code}\r\n$ defaults write com.apple.screencapture type pdf\r\n$ killall SystemUIServer\r\n{code}\r\n# Press {{Command + Control + Shift + 3}} to capture a screenshot into the clipboard\r\n# Open a Confluence page in edit mode\r\n# Press {{Cmd + C}} in the Confluence page\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nThe paste from the clipboard should work correctly in the both scenario.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nh4. Scenario1\r\n\r\nThe PDF wasn't attached to the page and the filename is just pasted as a text.\r\n\r\nh4. Scenario2\r\n\r\nThe paste failed silently.\r\nIf we monitor the step in developer tools, we can see the following JavaScript error.\r\n\r\n{code}\r\ndollar.js:1 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'size' of null\r\n    at Object.pasteFromEvent (dollar.js:1)\r\n    at Object.onPaste (dollar.js:1)\r\n    at Editor.<anonymous> (dollar.js:1)\r\n    at Dispatcher.dispatch (dollar.js:1)\r\n    at b (dollar.js:1)\r\n    at DOMUtils.<anonymous> (dollar.js:1)\r\n    at HTMLBodyElement.e (dollar.js:1)\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to some of third-party apps, they try to store images as PDF when copying them into clipboard.\r\nThat's why these scenario should be also considered.\r\n\r\nh3. Notes\r\n\r\nThis problem might be caused by [this browser's spec|https://w3c.github.io/clipboard-apis/#reading-from-clipboard].\r\nEven though we don't support pasting PDF from clipboard, it would be more user friendly if Confluence could show some error on the UI.\r\n\r\nh3.Workaround\r\n\r\nUse the other browsers instead.",

Summary\r\n\r\nContinuous usage of Collaborative Editing combined with huge number of content and huge number of users in Confluence will result in Slow loading time when editing a page\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Have Collaborative Editing turned on\r\n # Have a huge number of content in Confluence - after some time of Real Time usage\r\n # Edit a page\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nPage can be edited immediately\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nThere's a loading time before we can edit a page.\r\nh4. Workaround\r\n\r\nThis workaround is for MySQL, as the problem seems to only be exhibited for MySQL databases.\r\n\r\nA potential cause is missing indexes. Check that the correct indexes exist for the {{EVENTS}} table:\r\n||Table||Non_unique||Key_name||Seq_in_index||Column_name||Collation||Cardinality||Sub_part||Packed||Null||Index_type||Comment||Index_comment||\r\n|EVENTS|0|PRIMARY|1|rev|A|22468|NULL|NULL|\u00a0|BTREE|\u00a0|\u00a0|\r\n|EVENTS|0|PRIMARY|2|history|A|22468|NULL|NULL|\u00a0|BTREE|\u00a0|\u00a0|\r\n|EVENTS|0|e_h_r_idx|1|rev|A|22468|NULL|NULL|\u00a0|BTREE|\u00a0|\u00a0|\r\n|EVENTS|0|e_h_r_idx|2|history|A|22468|NULL|NULL|\u00a0|BTREE|\u00a0|\u00a0|\r\n|*EVENTS*|*0*|*e_h_p_s_idx*|*1*|*history*|*A*|*22468*|*NULL*|*NULL*|\u00a0**\u00a0|*BTREE*|\u00a0**\u00a0|\u00a0**\u00a0|\r\n|*EVENTS*|*0*|*e_h_p_s_idx*|*2*|*partition*|*A*|*22468*|*NULL*|*NULL*|\u00a0**\u00a0|*BTREE*|\u00a0**\u00a0|\u00a0**\u00a0|\r\n|*EVENTS*|*0*|*e_h_p_s_idx*|*3*|*sequence*|*A*|*22468*|*NULL*|*NULL*|\u00a0**\u00a0|*BTREE*|\u00a0**\u00a0|\u00a0**\u00a0|\r\n\r\nIf the above bolded index is missing, it can be manually re-created by:\r\n{code:java}\r\nCREATE UNIQUE INDEX e_h_p_s_idx ON EVENTS (`history`, `partition`, `sequence`);{code}\r\n*{color:#333333}_Be aware that a future release of confluence will fix the issue, and any manually added index ought to be removed (when they become redundant)._{color}*\r\nh3. Notes and Research\r\n * After checking in the database side, Confluence connects to the database to do an SQL \"count\" query on several database tables, namely \"events\" table everytime user clicks on \"edit page\".\r\n * After continuous usage of Collaborative editing, the above mentioned table (and other tables related to Synchrony and Collaborative editing) has grown so large, than a simple \"count\" job will take longer.\r\n * This can be mitigated by following the Documentation [How to reduce the size of Synchrony tables|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/CONFKB/How+to+reduce+the+size+of+Synchrony+tables].\r\n * However, while checking on how many shared drafts will be lost due to this action (instructions provided in this documentation: [How to recover or identify a lost shared draft after disabling collaborative editing in Confluence|https://confluence.atlassian.com/confkb/how-to-recover-or-identify-a-lost-shared-draft-after-disabling-collaborative-editing-in-confluence-858769305.html] shows that there are a huge numbers of shared drafts that will be lost, and not feasible to actually retrieve them one by one.\r\n\r\nh3. Real Data feedback from customers:\r\n||Amount of time using Collaborative Editing||Total Spaces||Amount of rows inside the {{EVENTS}} table||Amount of lost shared draft identified||\r\n|1 month|850|650k|8000|",
