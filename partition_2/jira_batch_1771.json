Under Firefox running Win7, it asked to download plugin due to security sets in browser. In OS X it worked without \"missing plugin\" issue, however videos were too large (1280x800) and taken too long to load. When finally loaded it played cropped. Some instances had 10 videos in the same space page. \r\n\r\nTested with very small videos (240x150 and 320x240) and two embedded media per space page and also doesn't worked.\r\n\r\nAccording [Supported Platforms|http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Supported+Platforms] the browsers were supposed to work.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nFabiana",

      "description": "This is the improvement description of the client:\r\n\r\nSome links in the \"XXX is following you\" email notification are broken when rendered in Lotus Notes 8.5.2/FP1.  This email notification presents several links to the reader.  The links that are broken included:\r\n\r\n* each user avatar picture\r\n* Network View\r\n* Email Settings\r\n\r\nAfter viewing the source code of the email I discovered that the email uses a mix of absolute paths and relative paths.  The links that work in Lotus Notes are coded as absolute paths.  The broken links are all coded as relative paths:\r\n\r\nAbsolute:\r\n{code}<a href=\"http://tde/wiki/users/editmyemailsettings.action\" style=\"color:#326ca6;text-decoration:none;\">Manage Notifications</a>{code}\r\n\r\nRelative:\r\n{code}<a href=\"/wiki/users/viewfollow.action?username=tdeadmin\">Network View</a>\r\n<a class=\"userLogoLink\" href=\"/wiki/display/~SPEALY\">...</a>{code}\r\n\r\nIt also appears the email uses the HTML convention <base href=\"...\"> to resolve relative paths.  I suspect Lotus Notes is *not* honoring the <base> HTML tag thus rendering these links broken.\r\nWhy does the email use a mix of relative and absolute paths?  In the case of a notification email I cannot think of a benefit to using relative links.  And, in our enterprise case, it seems the relative links are broken when viewed in Lotus Notes.\r\n\r\nOf the email clients I've tested this issue affects:\r\n\r\n* Lotus Notes 8.5.2 (client)\r\n* Lotus Notes 8.5.2FP1 (client)\r\n* iNotes 8.5.1 (web)\r\n\r\nThis issue does not affect:\r\n\r\n* GMail\r\n\r\nSo, in a nutshell, Confluence should allow to choose which type of URL to have in the email notification: Either Absolute or Relative URLs, but not both mixed.",
