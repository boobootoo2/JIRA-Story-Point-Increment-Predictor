Suggested Solution\r\nIt would be interesting to choose if we need to immediately reindex the changed content or if it could be indexed later.\r\nFor example, modifying a page through the REST API could provide an option to choose if the page should be reindexed at the time of this modification.\r\n\r\nThis would be interesting on the scenario where we update a page each 10 minutes, but only need to reindex it once a day.\r\n \r\nh3.

Workaround\r\n\r\n * Downgrade your JDK version from jdk 11 to jdk 1.8, Java 1.8 is not known to cause this problem.\r\n * The issue is observed with Java 11 that uses TLS v1.3. TLS v1.2 is unaffected by this. By default, Confluence 7.1.0+ ships with this as default JVM flags:\r\n{code}\r\n-Djdk.tls.server.protocols=TLSv1.1,TLSv1.2 -Djdk.tls.client.protocols=TLSv1.1,TLSv1.2\r\n{code}\r\n** Add these JVM flags back into Confluence if they are missing",

A feature that would be very useful and efficient a promote to Prod feature/function.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nFor Example - My company uses both a \"Staging/test\" workspace for documentation where many colleagues can collaborate on a page and review all documentation requirements/specs/info prior to us moving over to our official PROD documentation workspace. We currently have to copy and paste and it can be quite time consuming depending on what type of technical requirement/information is being displayed/updated. The function that would elevate confluence to the next level and honestly make this application much easier to use is function that allows you to link 2 pages together or workspaces that allows you to take one page (Must share the same name or a token to link them together) and then promote all updates from the lower documentation workspace (STAGING/TEST) to a production environment. This would overwrite the existing page in PROD with the new updates being promoted from the lower workspace environment.\u00a0",

      "description": "As a part of Confluence Crowd integration so as to unmarshal the response from Crowd, we are using SAXParser. Now the problem is that during this process, we create createSAXParserFactory and tries to the load the implementation class which as per specification as below(snippet from https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/javax/xml/parsers/SAXParserFactory.html#newInstance-- )  \r\n---------\r\nObtain a new instance of a SAXParserFactory. This static method creates a new factory instance This method uses the following ordered lookup procedure to determine the SAXParserFactory implementation class to load:\r\n* Use the javax.xml.parsers.SAXParserFactory system property.\r\n* Use the properties file \"lib/jaxp.properties\" in the JRE directory. This configuration file is in standard java.util.Properties format and contains the fully qualified name of the implementation class with the key being the system property defined above. The jaxp.properties file is read only once by the JAXP implementation and it's values are then cached for future use. If the file does not exist when the first attempt is made to read from it, no further attempts are made to check for its existence. It is not possible to change the value of any property in jaxp.properties after it has been read for the first time.\r\n* Use the service-provider loading facilities, defined by the ServiceLoader class, to attempt to locate and load an implementation of the service using the default loading mechanism: the service-provider loading facility will use the current thread's context class loader to attempt to load the service. If the context class loader is null, the system class loader will be used.\r\n* Otherwise the system-default implementation is returned.\r\nOnce an application has obtained a reference to a SAXParserFactory it can use the factory to configure and obtain parser instances.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Suggestion*\r\nLots of threads are blocked(snippet below) on finding the specific implementation and hence probably it might help if we go ahead and add below system property for a better performance around this lookup\r\n-Djavax.xml.parsers.SAXParserFactory=org.apache.xerces.jaxp.SAXParserFactoryImpl

Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nToday the XML format is used for the main file (entities.xml - which can take an absurd side) and a few other files/directories and the attachments directory.\r\n\r\nThe suggestion is that this process can be refactored to\u00a0bypass file sizing limitations by\r\n - using other formats (non-XML), easier to parse and work with (and potentially smaller in size)\r\n - implementing a wire migration tool that'd allow a space to be transported to another instance\r\n\r\nEssentially the way to improve it is not the main thing - the main ask is to actually improve the space migration task to make it easier and faster for really large instance admins.",

Environment\r\n* Tested on Confluence 7.7.4: it is affected.\r\n* Tested on Confluence 7.3.5: it is not affected.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Create a page with the *Page Properties* macro and a simple table. Use a special character in one of the heading cells:\r\n !Macro is working.png|width=140,height=117! \u00a0\r\n # Create a page with the two *Page Properties Report* macro for comparison.

The content from the column *\u00c3* stoped working:\r\n !Page Properties Report not working.png|width=140,height=84!\r\n\r\nh3. Why this happened?\r\n\r\nWhen the new line was added to the heading cell named *\u00c3*, the heading was wrapped with\u00a0*<p>* and *</p>* in the Storage Format:\r\n{code:html|title=Before}\r\n<tr>\r\n<th>&Atilde;</th>\r\n<th>B</th></tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>C</td>\r\n<td>D</td></tr>\r\n{code}\r\n{code:html|title=After}\r\n<tr>\r\n<th>\r\n<p>&Atilde;</p>\r\n<p><br /></p></th>\r\n<th>B</th></tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>C</td>\r\n<td>D</td></tr>\r\n{code}\r\nThe *<p> </p>* block of code remains even if the new line is deleted.\r\n\r\nBased on the test, to trigger the bug, the heading cells containing the *<p> </p>* block also need to have a special character.\r\n\r\nThe bug can also be reproduced if a cell content that contained that *<p> </p>* block and the special character before was copied to a heading cell or if the the cell containing the *<p> </p>* block and the special character was converted into a heading cell.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nUsing a plugin such as [Confluence Source Editor|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1210722/confluence-source-editor], the user can access the Storage Format for the affected page, locate the heading cells and manually remove the *<p> </p>* block.\r\n\r\nEventually the *<strong> </strong>* block can be found together the  *<p> </p>* block.

That does not seem to be happening. It seems that users need to re-preview the files they need, on an ad-hoc basis, to have the preview re-created.\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\nOne customer suggested an automation to recreate this content at startup, such as we already do for other types of cache. For them, this would be very useful, since they would like to have the preview available for all files.\r\n\r\nh3.

Time range for viewing cache statistics\r\n\r\nAt present, there is a 'flush' cache option for most (if not all) the application caches, and this also flushes the cache stats. However, I believe what would be beneficial here would be a way to check the cache statistics via a time range, so that the admins can compare pre and post flushing of the cache and check if the effectiveness has improved (or whichever metric you're focusing on at that time).\r\nh4. Better cache statistics monitoring\r\n\r\nAs per CONFSERVER-12837, Atlassian states that they can't recommend cache values because the size of caches depends on a lot of external factors within the host machine and the cluster and primarily should be part of the tuning process to keep the application healthy.\r\n\r\nHowever, I feel like some help here (besides a knowledge base article) can be warranted inside the UI. At the very least, a way to monitor the cache usage in the UI instead of relying on support/admins to review it during a time of crisis/instability/sluggishness. Maybe even a way to suggest values based on effectiveness over a period of time-based on some of the known configuration values. This would help admins make a decision on which caches to focus on during health checks to prevent problems before they arise.",
