Problem Definition\r\n\r\nWhen watching a *Whole Space* (using the option to *Watch This Space*), if I uncheck the *Watch all content in this space* option in a page, *Everything is un-watched* except for the page that I am in at the moment. *This Does Not Happen* with Administrator Users.

When unchecking *Watch all content in this space*, keep all pages as *Watching* but allow me to uncheck the ones I need to.\r\nh3. Why this is important\r\n\r\nIn a space where you have multiple pages, dozens, hundreds of pages but only a few are spamming notifications or are simply not relevant we must be able to simply un-watch those pages if needed. Un-watching the whole space and then having to go after each page and re-watch them is time consuming and counter intuitive.\r\nh3.

Unfortunately, because of the bad health of CAC at the time, I was unable to get a heap-dump or determine exactly what URL was requested that lead to this scenario.\r\n\r\nWhat I do know is that the thread was executing for 15+ minutes, and for the entirety of this duration was stuck in org.eclipse.compare.internal.core.LCS. [~don.willis@atlassian.com] has indicated that this should never happen, as page diffs have timeout logic implemented. Is it possible there's some edge-cases, perhaps a page diff that is extremely computationally expensive, that cause the request to exceed its timeout and not be properly interrupted?",

The over-ruling in inheritance on the way down the tree as permissions are adjusted cause an admin headache, and they cause a performance it too in my testing as the checks recurse up or down the tree. Even without the performance concerns, we just don't want that mess.\r\n\r\nWe have three options at the moment:\r\n - allow users to do what they want and have a mess\r\n - only allow admins access to manage restrictions (with 2000 users, this causes a hefty overhead on the human side)\r\n - disable permissions site-wide and require varying ACL requests to happen at a space level\r\n\r\nWe have currently opted for the third option as this is the best out of those 3, at least for us.\r\n\r\nAn ideal fourth option though, would be if we could limit page restrictions just so they can be managed at the first level of pages within a space. This would stop the overwriting inheritance issue and the permissions. Some people may like this to happen for the first 2 levels, some deeper, so a droplist of 1-xx depth limit on this setting would give more flexibility.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

(i.e. {{/rest/prototype/1/attachment}}), there isn't a field that indicates the user who uploaded the attachment. There is an \"owner\" field but this refers to the content the attachment is attached to. This seems like a major oversight since this field does exist in the old remote api (json-rpc, xml-rpc, soap). \r\n\r\nYou would probably say \"oh, easy, just use the old remote api\". The problem is that I have an attachment ID but the old api uses filename and page id to look up attachment. Therefore, to get the username of the attachment uploader, I need to currently make 2 requests. First, to the prototype api to get the information to make a request to the old remote api. Then to the old remote api. ",

It will do so no matter if I have created or ever edit the page. \r\nI know that the documentation says:\r\n\r\nYou cannot exclude yourself\r\nAs creator or editor of a page, you cannot use page restrictions to deny yourself access to the page. Confluence will automatically add your username into the list of users/groups allowed to view/edit the page. If you remove your username, Confluence will put it back again. \r\n\r\nBut that does not make sense for my use case: As an admin I sometimes want to restrict pages for other people but I do not want my user to be added to those pages. \r\n\r\nPlease make it possible to remove the own user from the page restrictions. \r\n\r\nThanks Liesa ",
