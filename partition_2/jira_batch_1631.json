      "description": "h3. Summary\r\nThere is an excessive delay in loading the editor for a Confluence page that has several Jira Issue Macros (JIM) that are using the 'Total Issue Count' option in the 'Display Options'. This appears to be linked to Jira servers/clusters that have a million issues (or more).\r\n\r\nh3. Environment\r\nConfluence 7.4.3.\r\nJira 8.5.8 (maybe other versions of JIRA as well)\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Install Jira 8.5.8 and Confluence 7.4.3 in test environment. I used PSQL db for the test.\r\n# Populate the application data in JIRA to have 500k to 1 million issues. Confluence can be at default settings.\r\n# Setup an application link between the two servers.\r\n# In Confluence, create a new test page with 15 JIM macros each using JQL to filter the table and make sure that in the 'Display Options' in the macro, the 'Total Issue Count' option is selected. The filter should have a high amount of issues included (500k to 1 million) among several of the macros.  Save the page.\r\n# Notice it reaches out to JIRA to pull total issues for each macro.\r\n# While on the test page, click the EDIT button (top right).\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nThe editor should load in a reasonably quick time, or at least inline with how long it takes to query and retrieve the total issue values from Jira.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nThe editor takes 3x-5x the time it should to fully load before being available to edit the page.\r\n\r\nh3. Notes\r\n- The delay comes from the editor reaching out to JIRA and requesting/loading the total issue counts _after_ the EDIT button has been pressed. This is to include the total issue count for the macros in the editor.\r\n- While viewing a page, there are asynchronous REST calls to get the total issue count for the macros (this is behaving normally) which is several times faster than in edit mode.\r\n- Customers have observed that the delay in v6.15.9 is 50% less than in v7.4.3. for the editor with the same dataset in Jira.\r\n\r\nh3.Workaround\r\n- Splitting page into smaller pages will help with page load.\r\n- Starting from versions 7.8.1 and 6.13.18, in the [dark features|https://confluence.atlassian.com/confkb/dark-features-in-confluence-1079350770.html], we would need to add \"confluence.extra.jira.edit.ignore.count\" to prevent Confluence from making requests to Jira. Due to that change, instead of a real count number, we will see \"x\" in edit mode.",

In order to edit the file, you must click on {{...}}\u00a0at the top right corner of the page, and then select *Edit in office*.

The options should be similar.\u00a0\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nAdd an \u201cEdit file\u201d icon directly visible in the file previewer, instead of having it under the {{...}}\u00a0option.

However, Confluence's upgrade tasks are very static and will only remove the foreign key constraints that were added by Confluence. Any other FK constraints will remain and won't be deleted.\r\n\r\n(i) This bug is discussing the removal of the {{ATTACHMENTS}} table along with non-self-referential FK constraints.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Setup Confluence 5.6 or any pre-5.7 version whereby {{ATTACHMENTS}} is still being used by Confluence to store attachment details. Make sure it's using an external database.\r\n# Create a new space in this site with some pages and insert attachments into them.\r\n# Access the database and insert a new foreign key constraint into the {{ATTACHMENTS}} table. For example:\r\n {code}ALTER TABLE ATTACHMENTS ADD CONSTRAINT test FOREIGN KEY (PAGEID) REFERENCES CONTENT (CONTENTID);{code}\r\n# Upgrade that instance to 5.7 or later successfully.\r\n# Start Confluence.\r\n# Try to delete the space created in step #2.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nThe space can be deleted.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nThe space can't be deleted due to the FK constraint that was left behind when the {{ATTACHMENTS}} table was removed.\r\n\r\nHere are the FK constraints before upgrade:\r\n{code}\r\nCONSTRAINT `FK54475F9017D4A070` FOREIGN KEY (`PREVVER`) REFERENCES `attachments` (`ATTACHMENTID`),\r\nCONSTRAINT `FK54475F908C38FBEA` FOREIGN KEY (`PAGEID`) REFERENCES `content` (`CONTENTID`),\r\nCONSTRAINT `FK_ATTACHMENTS_CREATOR` FOREIGN KEY (`CREATOR`) REFERENCES `user_mapping` (`user_key`),\r\nCONSTRAINT `FK_ATTACHMENTS_LASTMODIFIER` FOREIGN KEY (`LASTMODIFIER`) REFERENCES `user_mapping` (`user_key`),\r\nCONSTRAINT `test` FOREIGN KEY (`PAGEID`) REFERENCES `content` (`CONTENTID`)\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nHere are the FK constraints after upgrade:\r\n{code}\r\nCONSTRAINT `FK54475F9017D4A070` FOREIGN KEY (`PREVVER`) REFERENCES `attachments_backup` (`ATTACHMENTID`),\r\nCONSTRAINT `test` FOREIGN KEY (`PAGEID`) REFERENCES `content` (`CONTENTID`)\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nh3.

This error happens when there are more than 1000 values in the *IN clause*, which in this case are the comments. See this thread from the Oracle community: https://community.oracle.com/thread/235143\r\n\r\nh3.

The hover color on the Application links, accessed by clicking the 3 bars in the upper left corner, appears to be the same color. So if you hover over 'Configure' it apears as one blue rectangle. (As shown in the attached picture)\r\n\r\nThere should be some kind of color switch to maintain the readabillity of the selected link.\r\n For example you could switch the text (forground) color to white on hover.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nKind Regrads,\r\n\r\nKevin",

Summary\r\nLet's say our hierarchy of pages in a page are as such:\r\n * Parent A (contains ImageA.png and ImageB.png)\r\n ** Child A (displays ImageA.png that was attached in Parent A)\r\n ** Child B (displays ImageB.png that was attached in Parent A)\r\n\r\nOn pages Child A and Child B, the only way to know that ImageA.png and ImageB.png originated from Parent A is to edit the page and hover over the image. At that point, you'd be able to view which space and page the image came from. A sample is shown below:\r\n\r\n !Attachment hover.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\nh4. Suggestion\r\nThe method mentioned above is very troublesome and difficult for users to identify which page actually has the attachment attached to it. Perhaps Confluence can do one of the following:\r\n * Automatically link the attachment so clicking on it will immediately redirect users to the original page where the attachment was attached to.\r\n * Provide a macro which can list out the links to pages whose attachments are displayed on the current page.\r\n\r\nAny other implementation method that will allow an easier way of knowing which page provides the attachment would be great.\r\n\r\nh4. Workaround\r\nThis will achieve suggestion #1 above, but has to be manually done.\r\n # Edit an existing page or create a new page.\r\n # Insert an attachment from another page into the page from step #1 above.\r\n # Click on the newly added attachment on the page editor.\r\n # Click on \"Link\".\r\n # Search for the page where the attachment came from.\r\n # Select the page.\r\n # Click on \"Insert\".\r\n # Save the page.\r\n # Click on the attachment to test the URL/page redirection.",

Problem Definition\r\nAlthough anonymous access can be disabled in the global permissions, it can still be enabled in space permissions. Since users in the 'confluence-users' group have access to any content allowed for anonymous access, then all users in that group will be able to see the spaces where anonymous access is enabled, even though it is disabled at the global level.\r\n\r\nh5. Suggested Solution\r\nDisable/hide the anonymous section under Space permissions when global anonymous permissions are disabled.\r\n\r\nh5. Workaround\r\nHide the anonymous access section of the space permissions page from anyone who is not a system administrator by adding the following to the *Confluence admin -> General configuration -> Custom HTML* at the end of the body:\r\n{code}\r\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\r\n    AJS.toInit(function(){\r\n       if (!AJS.params.isConfluenceAdmin) {\r\n      AJS.$('#aPermissionsTable').hide();\r\n}\r\n    });\r\n</script>\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nIncase the above script doesn't work, you can use the below script to hide the anonymous section for all users :\r\n\r\n{code}\r\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\r\n    AJS.toInit(function(){\r\n\t  AJS.$('#aPermissionsTable').hide();\r\n    });\r\n</script>\r\n{code}\r\n(!) Please note, following above steps will not remove the current permissions from the database. Please remove the Space anonymous access manually or by using database query before removing the anonymous permission section. Below is the query to find Spaces which has anonymous access \r\n\r\n{code:sql}\r\nselect * from spacepermissions where PERMUSERNAME IS NULL AND PERMGROUPNAME IS NULL AND  NOT PERMTYPE = 'LIMITEDUSECONFLUENCE'\r\n\r\n{code}\r\n* *LIMITEDUSECONFLUENCE* is the global permission for Jira ServiceDesk users in Confluence\r\n",
