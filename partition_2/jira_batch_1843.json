Please schedule for this week.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nYes, that sounds all very reasonable, let's please do it like this. It can't take that long to write down a page for this, can it (asking Matt and Chris)? Even if we wouldn't use the hover for other products, we should still provide this kind of documentation even for \"just\" plugin developers, and for our future selves (e.g. if someone else on the team wants to reuse the hover in another context)\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nPer\r\n\r\n> The implement guide should describe everything that a product needs to do to implement user hover, answering questions like:\r\n>\r\n> * What JavaScript code should I use to display the hover? * How should the server-side action display the hover information?\r\n> * What web-items section should I use for links\r\n> * What content should be in the main panel of the hover?\r\n> * What content should be in the main buttons and how should it be determined?\r\n>\r\n> Yes, these are things that could be conveyed by having Charles sit down with the developer and walk through, but I've found a document, shared between teams, promotes consistency, simplifies interactions, and is a nice reference guide for estimation and planning.  Without things like this being spelled out, if it is possible for products to do things differently, they'll do it in ways you can't imagine.\r\n>\r\n> Don\r\n>\r\n> Adnan Chowdhury wrote:\r\n>> Sorry, wrong Don.\r\n>>\r\n>> a\r\n>>\r\n>> On 16/03/2009, at 11:00 AM, Adnan Chowdhury wrote:\r\n>>\r\n>>> Hey guys,\r\n>>>\r\n>>> It was mentioned in the integration meeting that we should produce an 'implementation guide' for the user hover that other teams can use when they are implementing the user hover in their products.

When I add users or groups to a space and then give permissions, it would be nice if there was an \"All\" button, so I don't have to click all the checkboxes. It's not a big deal if you're just adding one, but if you're adding a bunch, it's a pain in the neck to click all the checkboxes for each user or group when it would be pretty easy to add one All javascript checkbox that would then check all the permissions for that user/group.\r\n\r\nThank you.",

I'm sure this matter has been discussed previously, but I didn't find readily a forum posting that summarizes the issues as my wiki users and I see them.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that users receive too many email notifications that most people consider unhelpful at best and very annoying at worst. The control mechanisms currently available in Confluence 2.10 are inadequate to control sending email notifications, and \"watch\" options available to users can not make up for this deficiency.\r\n\r\nI think we can divide actions and content into new, edited and removed pages, comments, news, and attachments as summarized below:\r\n\r\nContent Type \tNew \tEdited \tRemoved\r\nPage \t- \tX \t-\r\nComment \t- \t- \t-\r\nNews \t- \t- \t-\r\nAttachment \t- \t- \t-\r\n\r\n\r\nThe X shows the only option, as far as I can tell, for preventing sending email notifications.\r\n\r\nPer this chart, email notifications are automatically sent out for all combinations EXCEPT for edited pages based on whether users check the \"Minor Change?\" option box. (Searching the Confluence forum for \"minor change\" provides several conversations on this matter back at least to 2006.)\r\n\r\nWe find particularly annoying email notifications resulting from removing content. As administrator, I have removed pages, comments, and attachments as inappropriate or obsolete and have almost certainly not wanted to bring attention to that removed content.\r\n\r\nWe also believe email notifications about attachments (added, moved, or removed) to be of very low value. Attachments are almost always supporting or described by the page content itself which will be the subject of its own email notification.\r\n\r\nMy users and I believe it is past time for Atlassian to provide users and administrators better control in Confluence over sending these email notifications. This includes, but is not limited to, improving the \"Minor Change?\" option with clear option buttons or similar mechanisms as discussed in other forum entries.\r\n\r\nI look forward to elaboration of this issue by other users and action by Atlassian on this matter. \r\n{quote}",

Ever. You should be using some other token whose generation algorithm does not even use the password as an input.\r\n\r\nSecond, even if you can rebut #1, what you store is utterly useless to LDAP-connected Confluence installs. You can only authenticate to a directory server with the original password. A 1 way hash of the password has no value with LDAP authentication, so you're creating risk with no benefit.\r\n\r\nThird, your use of MD5+DES is questionable. DES does not provide acceptable security to the US federal government, and MD5 has significant vulnerabilities. Even the PKCS #5 1.5 standard upon which PBEWithMD5AndDES is based was superseded in 1999. See http://www.rsa.com/rsalabs/node.asp?id=2127.",

I can appreciate not wanting to promote the removal of pages, but it is a necessary evil, and should be easier to do. My suggestions are:\r\n\r\n1) Prompt to also remove or relocate child pages when deleting a parent. This would be a big improvement on its own.\r\n2) Have a checkbox somewhere on the \"Browse Pages\" section to allow removing multiple pages in one action. Currently we have to navigate to a page, click \"remove\", confirm, we're redirected to the space homepage..... Rinse and repeat for multiple deletions :-(\r\n3) Make the process an ajax enabled one, thereby minimising the time spent doing so\r\n4) somewhere on the \"Browse Pages\" allow us to drag and drop pages onto a trsh can icon",
