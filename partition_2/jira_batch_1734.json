Though the mind-mapping software suite is intended for use by academics, I argue that in this Information Age, who does not need help keeping track of all the details which constitute the Truth of the matter?\r\n\r\nSome notes on Truth:\r\nThe Google Search is one of the best general purpose providers of truth on the internet. However, the algorithm suffers from certain issues, particularly regarding the quantity of cross-links generated as a result of human behavior (e.g. painful experiences with sub-par technology vs. technology which \"just works\").\r\n\r\nWikipedia has largely addressed the need to consolidate certain [Google] Searches for truth into a reviewed, standardized, human-readable layout, thus augmenting our ability to understand and comprehend the unknown or unfamiliar. Wikipedia suffers from the inability to test Truth propositions, and so has policies which remove Primary authors from the allowable citation pool in preference to Journalists, or Secondary Sources, who may someday cover the material so that mortals may understand it (or something--I have yet to hear a sensible explanation for this policy).\r\n\r\nBoth tools may be used easily as consumers, with some difficulty as a producer. However, there is a yet a lot to be desired in the gap between knowing and creating. For instance, take GitHub and BitBucket. Those are social tools for creation of software. Now extend those ideas to logic, personal preferences, and what we do as human beings, and we ought to see some computer augmentation of our abilities to discern fact from fiction.",

Sadly, it was a total accident that I found that out (I was trying to type a comment and hadn't focussed the field). I never bothered to try it because the only visible piece of UI in workbox is a link to go \"back to notifications\".\r\n\r\nI'd like to see you guys implement some forward/backward arrows in workbox, similar to how GMail does it. That way, you will solve three problems:\r\n\r\n* Visibility and affordance of the feature,\r\n* mouse users will be able to do something better than \"back to notifications\", and\r\n* you can educate people what the keyboard shortcuts are (via tooltips on the buttons).\r\n\r\n ",

[See the corresponding bug report|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFCLOUD-29311].\r\n  {panel}\r\n\r\nh4. Problem\r\nAfter inserting a link to an anchor in a page, Confluence seems to be truncating part the resulting URL, making the link useless. \r\nFor example, a link to an anchor named \"section two\" would be rendered as \r\n{noformat}\r\nhttps://<account>.atlassian.net/wiki/display/<spaceKey>/<page>#<page>-sectiontw\r\n{noformat}\r\n(note the missing \"o\" letter at the end of the link).\r\nThe issue seems to be intermittent.\r\n\r\nh4. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Create a new page\r\n# Create a numeric list with titles that will eventually be links.  (such as: 1. link one, 2. link two, etc.)\r\n# Create 4 h3 headers with some text, below the numbered list (\"section 1\", \"section 2\", etc.)\r\n# Above each h3, insert anchors (\"section one\", \"section two\", \"section three\", etc.)\r\n# For each of the items in the enumerated list at the top, highlight the text and click the link icon.\r\n# For the link, use the corresponding anchor that was just created (i.e., \"#section one\" or \"#section two\").\r\n# Save the page.\r\n\r\nh4. Expected Result\r\nLinks would point to the anchors correctly\r\n\r\nh4. Actual Result\r\nSome of the links are not rendered properly\r\n\r\nh4. Reproduced using the following environments:\r\n* OS: Windows 7\r\nChrome 26.0.x\r\nIE9\r\n* MacBook Pro OSX 10.8.3\r\nSafari 6.0.4\r\n\r\nh4. Workaround (From Michael in the comments)\r\nClick the \"Save\" button after entering the anchor destination, rather than pressing the Enter key. ",

      "description": "Last two EAC outages were due to image processing (specifically applying gaussian blur). 21 http threads out of 40 were doing gaussian blur on some image(s), and also consuming all the free heap.\r\n\r\nWe should:\r\n# Have a queue for image processing\r\n# Prevent multiple thread from processing the same image at the same time\r\n# Have every thread in the queue have a timeout\r\n# If the gaussian blur we're applying is always the same (image shadows), we should do one of two things:\r\n## Store and display the shadow as a 9 grid (check the image in https://code.google.com/p/scale9grid/) and use that, either when processing the image on the background, or maybe even when displaying on the client itself, although that will be more difficult to do.\r\n## If shadows are not always rectangles, we can use box blurring instead of gaussian. Its faster to process and uses less memory.\r\n# Also, we can process only the border we need to process the image, instead of the whole image size.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Workaround*\r\n* Starting from version 5.8.x (comes with Image Effect plugin of version 1.3.1) you could set next system properties for controlling internal thread pool for image effect renderring:\r\n{noformat}atlassian.image_filter.thread_pool_configuration.core_pool_size{noformat} (defaults to 4)\r\n{noformat}atlassian.image_filter.thread_pool_configuration.max_pool_size{noformat} (defaults to 4)\r\n\r\nIf you are running small instances (2cpus) then recommended values would be `1`since image effect is cpu heavy and you need to have some horsepower to the rest of the confluence.\r\n\r\n* Starting from version 6.0 there is additional fix which will prevent double processing of images which were are already getting processed (use case: impatient user refreshes page before it finishes load).\r\n",

Word 2010 only writes the Transitional type of ISO 29500. It looks like Word 2013 could be either Transitional or Strict. See:\r\nhttp://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd797428.aspx\r\nBut in theory Strict is supposed to be a subset of Transitional. So if a Transitional document created by Word 2010 works, you'd think that a Strict one would work too. However, it seems that when they standardized Strict they also made a change to namespaces. That is probably the key to fixing this. For more info see: http://blogs.msdn.com/b/dmahugh/archive/2010/04/06/office-s-support-for-iso-iec-29500-strict.aspx\r\nAlso http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_Open_XML#Compatibility_between_versions states:\r\n\"Applications able to read documents compliant to ECMA-376 edition 1 will regard ISO/IEC 29500-4 Transitional documents containing ISO 8601 dates as corrupt.\"\r\n\r\n.docx from 2010 displays normally\r\n",
