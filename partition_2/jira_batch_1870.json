      "description": "We did some load testing on our customized confluence installation. We are using conveyor to override existing xwork actions (e.g. the alphalist implementation provided by atlassian fetches *all* page objects of a space, does some permission filtering in memory and finally identifies the portion to present to the user. In case of a *high* number of page objects, this might not be an appropriate solution). Our conveyor plug-ins are spread over several plug-in archives.\r\n\r\nThe confluence xwork object factory implementation responsible to create new xwork action instances delegates the class lookup task to the ConfluencePluginObjectFactory and the _PluginsClassLoader_. Actually the _ConfluencePluginObjectFactory_ class cycles for every xwork action class resolution through all plug-in classloader and ask them for the class instance. Every time a class is not present as part of an plug-in a _ClassNotFoundException_ is thrown and the next plug-in is asked. So quite a number of exception might be generated. In addition there is this synchronized  _loadClass(..)_ method in _PluginsClassLoader_. In case confluence is under heavy load and the xwork action to resolve is served in our test scenario by the 20th plug-in, we observed that the xwork class resolution was delayed in worst case about *1s*!! The main reason is that several threads are waiting for the loadClass method monitor.\r\n\r\n(I assume that this problem is also present in case of xwork plug-ins.)\r\n\r\nPlease find attached a patched _ConfluencePluginObjectFactory_ which helped us to solve the problem. This patch is using a cache to identify the plug-in classloader which may serve the class resolution.\r\n\r\nIt would be very helpful when atlassian would incorporate this patch in the next release (or find a even better solution for this performance problem.)\r\n",

As when the request is coming through the LB, one does not know which specific node will be handling that request. Hence, if the request is delivered to a confluence node that has not been added to the trusted application list in JIRA, that particular user will not be allowed to see any information coming from JIRA (for example the {{jiraissue}} macro)\r\n\r\nTo improve this I would suggest to use +delegation approach+. When a trust is established with one node, as each node is aware of the others, a message should be displayed suggesting the other nodes IP addresses to be inserted into JIRA admin section. Alternatively, if possible, this information could be delegated and automatically inserted into the list of trusted applications in JIRA via some remote mechanism.\r\n",

On behalf of the Confluence team I would like to apologize for the changing status of this request. After many hours of discussion with design and product management, and after some engineering prototyping and testing, we have decided to close this issue as we do not plan to release this feature.\r\n\r\nWe aim to make our users' experience as friction-free as possible, and although being able to control the ways of opening links would be useful to many of you, it could easily lead to an inconsistent experience for users.\r\n\r\nIf your use of Confluence is in fact enhanced by opening particular links in a new window/tab then please consider using one of the existing solutions from our Marketplace (unfortunately they're not available for Cloud instances): \r\n\r\n* [ServiceRocket Linking Plugin|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/net.customware.confluence.plugin.linking]\r\n* [External Link Add-on|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/ch.bitvoodoo.confluence.plugins.externallinks]\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nAdam Barnes\r\nConfluence Product Manager\r\n{panel}",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFCLOUD-11189].\n  {panel}\n\nAfter upgrading to Confluence 2.7.1, emails sent to users who use Microsoft Entourage 2008 (Macintosh) as their email client sometimes (maybe always) show up blank.  A look at the actual message (using Message->Source in Entourage menu) reveals that the message contains all of the right data. The same message on the IMAP server downloaded to alternate email clients (including MS Outlook on a PC, iPhone Mail, and Apple Mail) renders correctly.\r\n\r\nThere is however another user who has reported the same problem with MS Outlook, though this is not consistent with other users. At least two users using Microsoft Entourage at our site are receiving the 'blank' emails. Saving the message in its original format using Entourage again reveals that the contents of the message are there in the message.\r\n\r\nA hunch that this problem was an HTML display problem led me to edit the message and remove all of the stylesheet information (removing the {{<style>...</style>}} elements from the HTML inside the message. Sure enough, that edited email message displayed correctly in Entourage.  Also, switching to 'Text' format for notification emails allows the emails to be viewed, providing further evidence the problem is an HTML display issue only.\r\n\r\nSo it seems that the problem is with Microsoft Entourage (latest update to MS Office/Entourage 12.0.1 didn't fix the issue). However, the fact that it seems to occur on at least one instance of MS Outlook leads me to believe that perhaps something in the underlying stylesheet could be adjusted to work with Entourage and Outlook reliably.  If the stylesheet could be updated so that it renders properly in Entourage (probably some minor bug in Entourage/MS Office HTML rendering), this would be most desirable.\r\n\r\n",

      "description": "Improvement Issue [http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONF-8010|CONF-8010] has been implemented with the result that spacekeys are not shown anymore in cross-space links. However, I consider its present implementation in v2.7.1 as a defect, since the former link behavior has not been respected, and no option has been allowed for backward compatibility.\r\n\r\nUnder v2.3.1, our procedure for creating new pages relied on a first \"draft\" step where the user would:\r\n# create the draft page in their own personal space\r\n# create an unaliased link from the global (production) space concerned, pointing to the draft page in the personal space\r\n\r\nThe link created in the global space would then show as:\r\n{{~userid:Draft Page Title}}\r\n-- the spacekey, in this case, being '~userid', with the advantages that:\r\n* this showed at first glance that it was a link to a DRAFT note, since it obviously pointed to a user space\r\n* if the user renamed the draft page, the link name would automatically be updated\r\n* when the user moved the (no longer) draft page to the appropriate global space, the spacekey '~userid' would disappear\r\n* once the page moved, it was clear at first glance that the link pointed to a 'production' note, not a draft\r\n\r\nThis feature is now lost in v2.7.1, and I have no option to have the proper link behavior reappear in my installation, which now makes our page-creation procedure inappropriate.\r\n\r\nAs a workaround, I've been proposed to copy the full 'Link' contents to the 'Alias' field of the 'Link Properties' dialogue. This workaround is NOT functional, for 2 reasons:\r\n# it doesn't work in the Rich Text Editor:\r\n## if your link is {{spacekey:The page name}} and you copy it into the Alias, the alias disappears as soon as you confirm 'Link Properties' data\r\n## the wiki markup then shows {{\\[spacekey:The page name\\]}}, and the link just displays as 'The page name'\r\n# if you create the link in the Wiki Markup Editor, it \"works\" in the sense that the Alias stays and the link is displayed with the spacekey, BUT:\r\n## if you modify the destination page name OR move the page to a different space (as we do in our page creation procedure), then the alias is NOT updated, since it's been hardcoded\r\n## if you modify the destination page name, the wiki markup yielded is:\r\n### BEFORE: {{\\[spacekey:The old page name\\|spacekey:The old page name\\]}}\r\n### AFTER: {{\\[spacekey:The NEW page name\\|spacekey:The old page name\\]}}\r\n>> and the link displays as 'spacekey: The old page name'\r\n## if you move the page, for instance to the appropriate global space, the wiki markup yielded is:\r\n### BEFORE: {{\\[oldspacekey:The page name\\|oldspacekey:The page name\\]}}\r\n### AFTER: {{\\[NEWspacekey:The page name\\|oldspacekey:The page name\\]}}\r\n>> and the link displays as 'oldspacekey: The page name'\r\n\r\nAs it was first suggested in [http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONF-8010|CONF-8010], the following should be implemented as a fix to this issue:\r\n\r\n{quote}\r\ncreate a configuration item \"Show space keys for inter-space links by default\". Default to 'true' for backward compatibility\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nNOTE: In my installation, Issue [http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONF-10458] has now been fixed as suggested with [https://repository.atlassian.com/maven2/com/atlassian/renderer/atlassian-renderer/3.18/atlassian-renderer-3.18.jar] in order to resolve broken links problems, but I'm still left with the above issue.",

Now with smaller fonts, it all looks fine in English, but in French and German it wraps uglily all the time, as can be seen in the screenshot. We need to make some more space there, otherwise non-english languages just don't work.  It sometimes wraps differently, but I guess once we provide more space it should all be fine.",
