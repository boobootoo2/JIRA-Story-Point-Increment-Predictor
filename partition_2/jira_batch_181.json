      "description": "h5. Problem\r\nBurndown charts rely on an issue to indicate when the chart data began. For example, the Epic Burndown chart will mark the first issue added as the starting point. All issue data/work after this \"First Issue\" will be considered as part of the Epic Burndown chart.\r\n\r\nIf the first ticket is transitioned from a \"Done\" status to another \"Done\" status, the Burndown chart will then believe it's part of the latest Active Sprint, suddenly ignoring all data before the active Sprint.\r\n\r\nh5. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Create an Agile project using the sample scrum data\r\n** You'll notice that the sample data will create 2 sprints:  Sample Sprint 1 and Sample Sprint 2\r\n** Sample Sprint 1 is already completed.\r\n** Sample Sprint 2 is currently active.\r\n# Create a new Epic for the board. Like \"Epic1\"\r\n# JQL search for:\r\n{code}\r\nSprint = \"Sample Sprint 1\" and status = \"Done\"\r\n{code}\r\n** These are the \"Done\" tickets in the first Sprint\r\n# Edit this ticket to put it into \"Epic1\"\r\n** For our example, let's say this is SSP-23\r\n# Now, add a \"Done\" ticket into \"Epic1\" from \"Sample Sprint 2\"\r\n** For our example, let's say this is SSP-15\r\n# View the Epic Burndown Chart\r\n** Notice how the chart shows data from both Sample Sprint 1 and Sample Sprint 2\r\n !Before Transition.png|thumbnail! \r\n# Now, open up SSP-23 and click on the \"Done\" transition again.\r\n !Done ticket transition.png|thumbnail! \r\n# View the Epic Burndown Chart\r\n !After transition.png|thumbnail! \r\n** Notice that Sample Sprint 1 is no longer shown on the chart\r\n** Notice the issue list, SSP-23 is shown to be part of Sample Sprint 2\r\n** If you view SSP-23, the issue view will still show Sample Sprint 1\r\n\r\nh5. User Expectation\r\nThere was no actual change to the SSP-23's field values (sprint, resolution, or resolution date) and no work was done as all estimates have already been burned down. We would expect no change in the burndown chart.\r\n\r\nh5. Actual Result\r\nThe burndown chart is different, no longer showing that \"Sample Sprint 1\" exists. Instead it now shows SSP-23 as part of \"Sample Sprint 2\".\r\n* If you view SSP-23 ticket, it shows that it is part of \"Sample Sprint 1\", so the burndown chart is not showing actual Sprint data.\r\n\r\nh5. Cause\r\nWhen a ticket is transitioned to a status that sets the resolution, the burndown charts are assuming that the ticket is now part of the latest Sprint.\r\n\r\nh5. Extra Notes\r\nThe above example is for the Epic Burndown, but this can happen for the Release Burndown as well.",

Summary\r\n\r\nThe JSON import fails to complete if the case of any of the status from the JSON file doesn't match the case of the corresponding status in the Project Workflow.\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n - Create a Workflow in a JIRA instance (for example 7.4.1) that contains a status \"ON HOLD\"\r\n - Create a JSON file containing an issue that has the status \"On Hold\" in the history. For example:\r\n{noformat}\r\n{\r\n    \"author\": \"c1111\",\r\n    \"created\": \"2014-05-31T18:00:00.000+0200\",\r\n    \"items\": [\r\n        {\r\n            \"fieldType\": \"jira\",\r\n            \"field\": \"status\",\r\n            \"fromString\": \"On Hold\",\r\n            \"toString\": \"On Hold\"\r\n        }\r\n    ]\r\n}\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\n - Attempt to import the JSON file.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n * The import should complete successfully without any error despite the case difference between the statuses \"On Hold\" and \"ON HOLD\",\u00a0since JIRA doesn't allow two statuses which differ only in casing (JIRA statuses are case insensitive)\r\n * The issue should be imported with its complete history\r\n * For now, until this issue is resolved, we might want to modify the [JSON import documentation|https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiraserver071/importing-data-from-json-802592907.html]\u00a0\r\n ** to reflect the fact that the import is currently case sensitive\r\n ** to let the JIRA users know that\u00a0the status case\u00a0should match between the JSON file and\u00a0the statuses defined in the JIRA instance where the import is performed\u00a0\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nThe history of this issue is not completely imported (all the history is imported up to the status change to \"On Hold\").\r\n The import page reports the error \"Unexpected failure occurred. Importer will stop immediately.

In the 'Completed Issues' table, ABC-123 would be grouped under Sprint 2, rather than Sprint 1. This is a more accurate reflection of what happened during the release and helps maintain the integrity of the report data.\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\nFor some users this is not a desirable behaviour since the issues were not worked on the Sprint that's reported in Release Burndown.\r\n\r\n\r\nh3.
