Save.\r\nRESULTS\r\nAfter save, the checkmark does not show up. See attached screenshot 2.\r\nWORKAROUND\r\n1. Insert a space after the emoticon (before the hyperlink) and then click save. Then the emoticon stays. \r\n2. Edit the page again and delete the space you added in step 1. Then save. Then the emoticon stays again whereas before it vanished.\r\n\r\nAdditional testing has show that emoticons can not be part of the title of a link. When inserting one directly next to a link in edit mode, the emoticon gets rendered (ie {code}(/){code} for check mark).\r\nUpon saving the page, the emoticon will disappear. \r\nWhen clicking on the link in edit mode, navigate to the edit option of the link and adding the ( / ) to the title there, the short cut for the emoticon will not get rendered after page save, and the title of the link will simply display the 3 characters ( / )\r\n\r\nIn effect this appears to relate to CONF-26042\r\n\r\nBesides that, another additional testing on Confluence 5.4.4 shows that this issue cannot be replicated if the link inserted to the page is a web link.",

Causing this bug will lead to a JVM crash originating in the {{\\[libpthread.so.0+0xe242\\]  sem_post+0x12}} frame.\r\n\r\n*The issue will be fixed in an upcoming Java release. See below for details.*\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\nRequests to the PPTSlideServlet ([View File Macro|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/View+File+Macro]) can cause the JVM to crash.

So keep myself up-to-date I'm \"watching\" pages, also i have an \"rss\" set up to chow changes made to pages tagged by a specific label.\r\n\r\n\"Watching\" pages is nice, because you get diff of a page's before/after state, which RSS doesn't provide (because of https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONF-26109, which I consider an odd decision, a kind of reluctance, and in current state it is a real issue to guess what has been added/changed/removed by looking at a message in RSS without a walk in browser; a side thought: then at least would be nice to have a configuration option in RSS builder to switch off showing of a content in RSS messages to keep RSS posts concise as all-in-all they do not provide info i'm looking for).\r\n\r\nHowever \"watching\" pages itself is not perfect too. Because people create new pages here and there, and it is not possible to watch a page along with its child pages (besides, sometimes pages of interest just cannot be organized in a parent-child page structure in a natural way). At the same time it is relatively easy to train everyone in a team to use a set of tags. But again, Confluence has no way to \"watch\" changes made to a tagged content. Would be nice to have that.\r\n\r\nAnd, finally, there is another problem with \"watching\" for changes in pages:   frequently people do not make all changes to a page in a single edit. So they edit a bit, then look and remember something and edit again, or update content during a day until it is stabilized and etc. And in turn I get a couple of emails related to a single change. I wish i cold receive only one notification in this case, e.g. send a notification for a particular page only after some quiet time. Alternatively i can imagine an option to switch to a periodic (e.g. daily) receiving of \"page-watching\" notifications, with automatic merging of a changes made by a single person to a single page.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think about all that?",

The translation for \"watching\" pages is wrong in a very particular way, The german word \"\u00fcberwachen\" has many very bad connotations. The meaning is more like \"observing\" or \"supervising\". This makes every german user i encounter react, on one hand because of the actual NSA discussion, on the other hand because of german history. Surveillance made a lot of dark chapters in german history, the last not long ago in GDR before 1990. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stasi for ex. \r\n\r\nI am not that captious normally, but in that case i'd really wish that you could change the wording. There are two options that would do better: \"abonnieren\" oder \"beobachten\", whereas \"abonnieren\" is the more factual alternative with a meaning more like \"subscribe\". This would do best in my opinion. I added translations for all the occurrences of the word \"\u00fcberwachen\" to \"abonnieren\" here: https://translations.atlassian.com/dashboard/translate#/48/5085/0/ACCEPTED_TRANSLATIONS/ALL/%C3%BCberwachen\r\n\r\nBest wishes\r\n\r\nMatin\r\n",

Install Confluence 5.3.1, configured over HTTP\r\n2. Install Jira 6.1.3, configured over HTTPS with port 8443\r\n3. Create application link within Confluence\r\n4. Link is created, but Confluence says Jira is offline (screenshot _list_links_)\r\n5. Add issues macro to Confluence page. With OAuth configured, login is required(screenshot _insert_jira_issue_). When you click Login an error is thrown (screenshot _login_). With Trusted Applications configured, searching for an issue to add throws a warning (screenshot _insert_jira_issue_ta_).\r\n\r\n*It looks like the HTTPS port is still missing from the header.* \r\n\r\nWhen you create the application link there's a broken image on the _List applications_ dialog because the URL for fetching the image from JIRA is missing the port (screenshot _broken_image_).\r\n\r\nh3.

It is the recommendation of Atlassian Support to use this configuration over setting up HTTPS on Tomcat as the configuration of it is considered to be easier to achieve.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you can run JIRA directly on 443.\r\n\r\nAnother workaround is to add proxyName and proxyPort to JIRA's SSL connector, even if there's no proxy:\r\n\r\nproxyName=\"JIRA server name\"\r\nproxyPort=\"JIRA SSL port (e.g. 8443)\"",
