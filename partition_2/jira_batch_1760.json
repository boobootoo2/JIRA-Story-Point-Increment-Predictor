Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Find an image with CMYK colour profile\r\n# Attach the image to a page\r\n# Edit the page\r\n# Inserting the image itself is fine\r\n# Go to Insert - Link > Attachments (or just Insert - Attachment) and you will see the error: \"There was an error communicating with the server, please try again later.'\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n* Open the image in image editing software and save it, specifying RGB as the colour profile if required. Usually just saving the file will convert the colour profile, on most simple image editing software.\r\n* If you require the CMYK profile on the images, the workaround is to embed them directly in the page, by Insert - Image. This will display the image, and it works fine. It is only thumbnails that have the problem.\r\n* Host/upload the images to somewhere else (e.g. Dropbox, image hosting site, external site, etc.), then insert the image link through {{Insert - Link > Web Link}}. \r\n\r\nNB: Reproduced on the initial customer's space and on a clean instance of 4.2.11.",

Or it might be thrown back and forth among different browsers as we suddenly just hit a shortcut used by IE or FF etc.\r\n\r\nSo instead of that, let people customize the shortcuts instead, allowing to optionally use up to 2 modifier keys. So i could bind Edit to Ctrl+Shift+E or Ctrl+Q to circumvent the issue with Ctrl+E\r\n\r\nThat way you should effectively once and for all eliminate the need for any further reports on \"colliding\" shortcut keys...\r\n\r\n",

I have attached my test, and a screenshot of the original page I used to create the document. If you click in the right place, you can select the image, but no amount of moving, copying or resizing will convince it to display.\r\n\r\nThis is for regular inline images, not generated images (----CONF-25599----).\r\nh4. Steps to reproduce:\r\n # Add a new page.\r\n # Insert an image by going \"Insert\" -> \"Image\", then upload an image and attach it.\r\n # Save the page.\r\n # Go to \"Tools\" -> \"Export to Word\" and open the resulting *.doc file in Word for Mac 2011 and 2010.\r\n -- The image will not be visible, and just show a blank line in its place.\r\n -- Opening the same *.doc file in Word running on Windows will show the image.\r\n\r\nh4. Resolution:\r\n\r\nAfter investigation, it appears this issue has been fixed in Microsoft Office 2016. As our documentation\u00a0currently lists\u00a0Microsoft Office\u00a02013 as the earliest supported version ([https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/office-connector-prerequisites-170493096.html)]\u00a0, and there is\u00a0no 2013 Office for mac,\u00a0it is recommended that customers upgrade to Office 2016 to resolve this issue.\u00a0Office 2016 has only been tested with Confluence 6.0.x. So while there is no fix contained in version 6.0.1, it is recommended that you upgrade to this version when you upgrade to Office 2016.",

      "description": "h3. Symptoms\r\n\r\nAfter a user's SSO session expires, as long as they have the crowd_token cookie set in their browser, each page load of anonymous content will be slow until either the cookie is removed or they log in again. The amount of time it takes seems to vary, based on my own replication it usually takes about 5-10 seconds, but I've had reports of it taking 20-30 seconds to load pages. It is important to note that this does *not* affect the load speed of the dashboard, the login page, or the redirection to the login page when trying to access a restricted page.\r\n\r\nNo error message is logged in either Confluence or Crowd application logs.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n# Set up Crowd SSO on Confluence\r\n# Log in as a crowd user\r\n# Log in to crowd, expire that user's session\r\n# Access any page that is anonymously accessible, other than the dashboard itself (i.e. inside of a space)\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nThere are the following workarounds to get around the slow page loads:\r\n\r\n* Log in again\r\n* Manually delete the cookie using the browser settings\r\n* Restart the browser so that the session cookie is automatically deleted\r\n* Set the session expiry time to something very large so that this is hit less frequently",

The memory increase can also be experienced in other browsers, but not as much as in IE8.\r\n\r\n*Steps to reproduce:*\r\n# Create a page inserting a status macro with \u2714 character in it, for example: status 1 \u2714\r\n# Check memory usage of _iexplorer.exe_ in task manager\r\n# Edit the status macro (no changes have to be made, just save it several times)\r\n# Check the memory usage increase after each edit\r\n\r\n*Workaround*\r\nAs a workaround you can save the page periodically, which then releases used up memory.",
