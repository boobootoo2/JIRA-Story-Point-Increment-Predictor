When I have a heading above an image with effects as the top two items on a page and I insert a line break above the heading, the cursor and text effect remains heading 1. I type Command + 1 to return to paragraph text. This causes the effects to disappear - similar to the bug described above. \r\n\r\nSee the video: http://screencast.com/t/SjQjZFx3y\r\n\r\n",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFCLOUD-24588].\n  {panel}\n\nHi guys,\r\n\r\nWhen I was creating or modifying templates before 4.0,  I used to create a page which looked the template I wanted to create, \"view page in Wiki markup\" and copy pasted the wiki markup text in the template editor. Few minor manuall corrections later I had the template I wanted.\r\n\r\nNow the \"view in Wiki markup\"-option is gone, whilst templates still must be written in wiki markup. \r\n\r\nMy questions: \r\n\r\na) is the a way to see a page in wiki markup?\r\n\r\nb) do you know any other workaround to solve this?\r\n\r\nc) are you allready planning to fix the template editor, so that wiki markup is no longer neccessary?\r\n\r\nThank you very much in advance!\r\n\r\nBest, \r\n\r\nViktor \r\n\r\nPS: Several other users seen to have the same problem.

      "description": "In Confluence 3.5.x and earlier, it was possible to search a space or site for macro parameters, URLs in links, and other markup elements, because they were part of the wiki markup and thus part of the page content. This is no longer possible in Confluence 4.\r\n\r\n*Root cause: Metadata (parameters) for content elements is hidden from the global search.*\r\n\r\nProblem specification:\r\n* While it is possible to search for macro names using the macroName search field, this functionality is obscure, and the usage of that field is tricky. See \"How to search Confluence for usage of a macro\": http://ffeathers.wordpress.com/2011/11/04/how-to-search-confluence-for-usage-of-a-macro/\r\n* It is not possible to search for macro parameters.\r\n** This means, for example, that you cannot discover where a particular excerpt or page is included into another page (CONF-23775). Scenario: I want to remove a page or update its content, but I need to find out first where it is included into another page.\r\n** Another scenario: I have changed a page name, and now I need to fix all the macros that refer to that page. Note that Confluence will fix links, but not the page names inside macros. Examples of macros that need fixing: children, excerpt, excerpt-include, anchor, pagetree, pagetreesearch, plus any number of user macros and macros added by plugins.\r\n* It is not possible to search for URLs used in links (CONF-24079). Scenario: Our website has moved to a different server and we want to fix all the links in the documentation that point to our website.\r\n* It is not possible to find all the pages that use a given image (or other attachment). You can search for attachments by filename using the filename field, but you can't search for their usage. For example, I can find out where \"myImage.png\" is attached to a page, but I cannot find all the pages that display \"myImage.png\". Scenario: I want to remove/update a screenshot, but first I need to know where it's used. Note that this problem is made even more urgent by the fact that the Confluence editor now links to the original source of an image, if you copy content from one page to another by copying and pasting.\r\n\r\nPlease refer to the following comments on our customer feedback pages:\r\n* http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Confluence+4.0+Editor+-+Customer+Feedback?focusedCommentId=271944755#comment-271944755\r\n* http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Confluence+4.0+Editor+-+Customer+Feedback?focusedCommentId=272597237#comment-272597237\r\n* http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Confluence+4.0+Editor+-+Customer+Feedback?focusedCommentId=272597238#comment-272597238\r\n* http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Confluence+4.0+Editor+-+Customer+Feedback?focusedCommentId=272597259#comment-272597259\r\n* http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Confluence+4.0+Editor+-+Customer+Feedback?focusedCommentId=272597304#comment-272597304\r\n* http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Confluence+4.0+Editor+-+Customer+Feedback?focusedCommentId=273285457#comment-273285457\r\n* http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Confluence+4.0+Editor+-+Customer+Feedback?focusedCommentId=273285792#comment-273285792\r\n* http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Confluence+4.0+Editor+-+Customer+Feedback?focusedCommentId=273285799#comment-273285799\r\n* http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Confluence+4.0+Editor+-+Customer+Feedback?focusedCommentId=274563818#comment-274563818\r\n\r\nNote: This issue is about the Confluence search function, not the search within the editor.

Summary of The Bug\r\n\r\nWhen page title have any character after a colon( : )\r\n{code:java}\r\nOffice Connector:test\r\n{code}\r\noffice connector can't find the office files attached to the page. If colon is the last character on the page title, attached office files searchable by view office macro.\r\n\r\nThis bug also affects the multimedia macros (adding audio / video files).\r\nh3. How to reproduce the bug\r\n # Create a page (example: 'Office connector:')\r\n !Officepage.png|thumbnail!\r\n # Attached office file into the page\r\n !attached.png|thumbnail!\r\n # Try to view it using view office plugin\r\n !Works.png|thumbnail!\r\n # Change the page title to contain any character after colon (example: 'Office connector:test')\r\n !test.png|thumbnail!\r\n # Try to view it using view office plugin\r\n !broke.png|thumbnail!\r\n # Attached files can't be seen on \"File Name\" fields\r\n (i) When viewed with _Developer Tools_, the {{attachmentsearch.action}} GET request returned HTTP 404 error code.\r\n\r\nh3. Workarounds\r\n\r\nOption 1 - Rename the page to remove the ':'\r\n\r\nOption 2 - Use the insert markup feature:\r\n # From the editor toolbar, expand the '+' menu.\r\n # Choose 'Markup'.\r\n # Insert the following markup (change accordingly):\r\n{code:java}\r\n{viewfile:name_of_the_attachments.ext}\r\n{code}\r\n\r\n # Save\r\n\r\nh1. Work performed\r\n * Changes are backwards-compatible in the plugin, committed in [https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/officeconnector] issue/CONF-24540 . 2 backwards-compatibility issues were raised: CONFDEV-10156 and CONFDEV-10157.\r\n * Changes in confluence-core are still on issue/CONF-24540, and awaiting implementation of a few review comments before being committed.",

This file name can be pre-populated with your auto generated time-based name, so for those who don't care, they just click OK or press Enter to accept the default. Better, if the typed in name already exists, give a message box asking whether user wants to override the old image.\r\n\r\nI believe most Confluence content contributors should be aware that there is a file name(instead of a mysterious black hole) under the hood supporting an \"inline\" image, therefore, don't be afraid to clarify the fact that user must assign a file name every time they Ctrl+V an new image.",
