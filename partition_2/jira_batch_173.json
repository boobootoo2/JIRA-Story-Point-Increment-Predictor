As such, there are no currently supported Jira Software versions that accurately document the REST API endpoints that are available to use with Jira Agile/Software.\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\nPlease update the available documentation to cite/reference a supported version of Jira Software, such as 7.13.x (an enterprise release version) or even the latest 8.0.2\r\n\r\nh3. Why this is important\r\nWithout current documentation, it makes it very difficult for plugin developers, administrators, creators of integrations of our products, etc to accurate interface with our products.   It might not be feasible to release this documentation for every minor version release, but ideally we should be publishing updates for these for major version releases and enterprise releases",

      "description": "Our Business Case; I am sure there are others:\r\n * we have a product development Jira project. It contains various products and different customers who will get the features.\r\n * we want a particular customer to be able to see the status and progress of his issues. Therefore, we synch these issues one way to another Jira project - it is considered read/only.\r\n\r\nWhenever we synch comments, their @mentions are notified upon save of the comment copy. Since the @mentioned people have been notified upon creation of the original comment, the additional notification serves just one purpose - it confuses the notified people.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nTherefore, I ask for a per-project configurable @mention notification - much like all other notifications in a project.",

There is no option to use story points or hours instead. While one can use the Version Report instead, which does use Story Points as the default measure, or Portfolio, it would be nice to make the progress tracker in the Release Hub configurable, so that users can choose whether or not progress is tracked by issue count, story points, or hours. This simple change would provide a lot of teams with a highly accurate and easy-to-consume view of progress toward version completion for management. Allowing this configuration would also make the Jira Roadmap gadget for dashboards more accurate.\r\n\r\nCertain add-ons allow tracking to be counted in all 3 of these options and provide an alternative tracking view, usually at the Epic level. It would be really nice if Jira offered this capability out of the box. The progress tracker is a really useful view and nicely laid out, providing a quick visual snapshot of progress toward completion of a version. However, limiting it to only the issue count can cause a bloated count for teams that assign a fixVersion both to Epics and Stories, and can also be problematic if/when teams have to assign fixVersions to sub-tasks. Both of those cases cause bloated issue counts, since grandparent and parent issues are included in the count as well as children and grandchildren.",

So, my Kanban view has all columns for all statuses. I would like to be able to have a 'Development' view/profile, on which the columns that shows tickets with QA Team and with Business Team would not be displayed, showing the columns that are related to Dev Team bigger in the screen. Similarly, we might be able to select the 'QA' view/profile, on which only the columns related to tasks with QA team would be displayed.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the workaround for that is to create different Kanbans, but this means that in case we are updating the Swimlanes, Quick Filters, Card Colors, Card Layout or any other information, we need to manually cascade these changes to the other (duplicated) Kanbans.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0",
