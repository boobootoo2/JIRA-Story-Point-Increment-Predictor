Outlook 2007, with its RSS support, will quickly become the defacto RSS reader for these companies.\r\n* Microsoft and Atlassian have partnered to present the SharePoint / Confluence connection. SharePoint 2007 is full of RSS capabilities and Outlook 2007 will be Microsoft's recommended default reader. Atlassian should leverage the partnership to resolve the SSL RSS issue.\r\n* As companies become more security minded we're seeing that they're SSL protecting more and more of their web enabled applications. Confluence is on that list so I would expect to see more and more SSL related issues arise.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nUpdate: I just finished doing some Googling and, according to a statement made by Sean Lyndersay, the PM of the RSS Team back in Sep of 06, Outlook 2007 DOES support SSL-encrypted feeds. ([reference|http://www.hanselman.com/blog/IE7RC1CantUpdatePasswordProtectedFeeds.aspx]). This suggests that the issue is indeed on the Confluence side after all.\r\n",

As it basically reports to you the current memory usage levels, this can be misleading and result in users to believing the JVM parameters parsed to the JVM do not take effect or have not been configured correctly when in fact they have.\r\n\r\nFor example, when setting the boundaries for the memory with varying -Xms and -Xmx settings, Confluence initially shows memory usage up to the minimum memory setting. As the usage increases, it will eventually be updated in the system info page to reflect the current usage levels.\r\n\r\nExample, this is the current Heap size settings for my 2.8.0 instance:\r\n\r\n{noformat}\r\n# Initial Java Heap Size (in MB) \r\nwrapper.java.initmemory=512m \r\n \r\n# Maximum Java Heap Size (in MB) \r\nwrapper.java.maxmemory=756m \r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nThe screenshot shows the current total at *508 MB*. Some users with this configuration would expect to see total memory as *756 MB* instead. Perhaps we can include a script that can be run to retrieve memory information on demand? I've attached an example jsp i wrote which grabs information on the current JVM properties:\r\n\r\n{noformat}\r\n# Java version:  1.5.0_13\r\n# Java Home: /System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/1.5.0/Home\r\n# Java classpath: ../wrapper/lib/wrapper.jar:/Library/Java/Home/lib/tools.jar:../bin/bootstrap.jar\r\n# Total Memory: 532873216\r\n# Max Memory: 786628608\r\n# Free Memory: 386200112\r\n{noformat}\r\n \r\nSomething like this could be useful for checking and validating *actual* memory settings rather than the current usage.",

One way in which I commonly leave the edit page accidentally is if the cursor focus is moved out of the textarea and I press backspace thinking I will be erasing characters. In situations like this, having an alert that allows me to cancel the page exit would be far more efficient than having to reload the page, then reload the autosave (and hope that the autosave got my most recent changes).\r\n\r\nAnother more significant hole in the AutoSave is if the editing is on a laptop that has lost internet connectivity -- for instance, the wifi connection got dropped. If anything happens to the page, the autosave will have not happened for some time. Likewise, if the authentication mechanism uses an external authenticator and that authentication times out, autosave will fail.\r\n\r\nI would definitely like to see OnBeforeUnload support added to the page editor to add an additional layer of safety.

Here is the explanation of class loading constraints:\r\n\r\nA loading constraint is violated if, and only if, all the following four\r\nconditions hold:\r\n\r\n\r\nThere exists a loader L such that L has been recorded by the Java\r\nvirtual machine as an initiating loader of a class C named N.\r\n\r\nThere exists a loader L' such that L' has been recorded by the Java\r\nvirtual machine as an initiating loader of a class C' named N.\r\n\r\nThe equivalence relation defined by the (transitive closure of the) set\r\nof imposed constraints implies N L = N L'.\r\n\r\nC != C '. \r\n***\r\n\r\nI 'think' that the idea is that if you have two different class loaders\r\n(L and L'), and each loads a class (L loads C and L' loads C') with the\r\nsame name (N), loading constraints will be violated if  C and C' are not\r\nthe same class. \r\n\r\nSo to bring this back around in relation to issue  \t CSP-19301:\r\n\r\nThe customer unpacked these jars that ship with confluence:\r\nsaxon-6.5.3-patched.jar\r\nss_css2-0.9.3.jar\r\nxml-apis-1.0.b2.jar\r\nxmlParserAPIs-2.2.1.jar\r\n\r\nThere are incompatible versions of NodeClass included.\r\n\r\nyou'll see that they differ in size (1630 vs 1597), indicating that they are different versions of the same class.\r\n\r\nrw-rr- 1 ubuntu ubuntu 1630 2000-10-09 18:02 ./saxon-6.5.3-patched.jar/org/w3c/dom/Node.class\r\nrw-rr- 1 ubuntu ubuntu 1630 2003-01-19 23:14 ./ss_css2-0.9.3.jar/org/w3c/dom/Node.class\r\nrw-rr- 1 ubuntu ubuntu 1597 2002-12-01 11:57 ./xml-apis-1.0.b2.jar/org/w3c/dom/Node.class\r\nrw-rr- 1 ubuntu ubuntu 1597 2002-11-11 18:24 ./xmlParserAPIs-2.2.1.jar/org/w3c/dom/Node.class\r\n\r\nThe following error is thrown\r\n\r\ncom.atlassian.core.exception.InfrastructureException: java.lang.LinkageError: Class org/w3c/dom/Node violates loader constraints\r\n\r\nSo this leads back to the point:\r\n\r\nif you have two different class loaders\r\n(L and L'), and each loads a class (L loads C and L' loads C') with the\r\nsame name (N), loading constraints will be violated if  C and C' are not\r\nthe same class. \r\n",

These urls are generated by adding the new label to the end of the current url.

Alternatively, continue to watch this issue and we will update it as we make further progress.\r\n\r\nThe existing calendar plugin is known to work in Confluence 3.3/3.4, even though it isn't formally supported.

The size of the query and the time required for Javascript processing causes most browsers (Firefox, IE, Safari) to complain that the script is taking too long to run or is exceeding its resources, and prompts the user to terminate the script.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1) Create a space with thousands of pages (at least 1700) in a flat (ie: nonexistant) hierarchy.\r\n\r\n2) Navigate to any page in the sapce.\r\n\r\n3) Click the \"Edit\" link to edit the page.\r\n\r\n4) Scroll to the \"Location\" field.\r\n\r\n5) Click the \"Edit\" link to move/reorder the page.\r\n\r\n6) Watch your browser grind to a halt and prompt you to terminate the script.\r\n\r\nWhat should have happened:\r\n\r\nThe macro (I assume it's pagetree?) should first query the number of pages in a space, and if it is sufficiently large (say, over 200 pages), only display a portion of the tree at a time.    Or, better yet, there should be a configurable option to use the older, 2.7 interface of a text box (which worked just fine).\r\n\r\nI realize that as a workaround, we could change the Edit page template to eliminate the macro, but that's not a feasible long-term solution, as it means that the macro itself is unusable.    Editing the browser preferences to increase the JavaScript timeout is also not a feasible option for a user base in the thousands.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFCLOUD-11979].\n  {panel}\n\nWhen importing a large number of pages from disk using the \"Import Pages from Disk\" feature, the import begins, but the page eventually times out with an HTTP 503 error.  I can then manually return to the Dashboard, and view the pages in the space in question, and see that the import thread is still running.  It successfully completes, however there is no feedback provided to the user about whether the import was successful or not.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n\r\n1) Create a directory with a large number (1765 was our count) of text files, ranging in size from 0.5K to 2K.  \r\n\r\n2) Create a new space in Confluence.\r\n\r\n3) In the Space Admin page, select \"Import Pages from Disk\".\r\n\r\n4) Specify the directory containing the files.\r\n\r\n5) Check the \"Trim file extensions\" checkbox.\r\n\r\n6) Click Import.\r\n\r\n7) Wait for the page to time out with HTTP 503.\r\n\r\n8) Return the Confluence Dashboard\r\n\r\n9) View the space into which you are importing the pages.\r\n\r\n10) Verify that some pages have been imported, and that the import is continuing.  In Confluence 2.7, there used to be a total page count at the top of the alphabetic page listing, but that seems to have vanished in 2.8\r\n\r\nWhat should have happened:\r\n\r\nConfluence should provide some feedback to the user indicating either that the import will continue in the background, or perhaps block until the import is complete.  Ideally, Confluence would use DHTML or server-side push to continuously update the Import page with the progress of the import.\r\n",
