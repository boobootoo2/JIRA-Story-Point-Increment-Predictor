Steps to Reproduce\r\nThere are multiple ways to reproduce the issue. I will list 2 tests:\r\n\r\nh5. Test #1\r\nThe first test was done with the following steps:\r\n# Create a new Confluence Page\r\n# Drag and Drop images directly into the page (I uploaded 300 images)\r\n# All images are uploaded successfully\r\n# On IE I saw some images towards the end with the thumbnail not showing\r\n\r\nThis error appears in the logs which indicates that there was a race condition on the temp directory to fetch the thumbnail of that image:\r\n{code:borderStyle=solid}\r\n2016-12-13 09:44:48,850 ERROR [http-nio-exec-123] [persistence.dao.filesystem.FileSystemAttachmentDataUtil] failedToWriteTempF\r\nile Error writing '/path/to/home/directory/attachments/ver003/92/19/250019842/226/193/3111111/12345678/data112132131242352312.tmp' to disk.\r\n\u2013 url: /confluence/plugins/drag-and-drop/upload.action | userName: admin | referer: http://localhost:8090/confluence/pages/editpage.action?pageId=123456789 | action: upload\r\njava.io.IOException: Socket read failed\r\n{code}\r\n\r\n\r\nh5. Test #2\r\n# Open the *Insert Files and Images* popup\r\n# Drag & Drop the images (300 images)\r\n# The browser will hang\r\n# When using a reverse proxy, the access log show that the drag and drop POST action was rejected by the server with HTTP Error 400 (BAD REQUEST)\r\n# Investigating this, Confluence uses AJAX requests for this POST action. IE has a limitation on the length of the URL, so at some point IE is trimming the URL sent with the POST request, causing the request to be rejected by the server\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nNo errors happening during the upload and all images thumbnails are displayed properly.\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nActual results described above based on each test \r\n\r\nh3.Workaround\r\nThere are 2 workarounds here:\r\n\r\nh5. Workaround 1\r\nThose problems do not appear on Chrome and Firefox\r\n\r\nh5. Workaround 2\r\n# Open the Attachments menu of this page\r\n# Drag and Drop the images there\r\n# This request is faster than all the other tests\r\n# All of the images are successfully uploaded without a problem\r\n# No browser hanging and no errors\r\n\r\n*Reasons behind this:*\r\nIn Test #1, every image upload consists of the following requests:\r\n- POST to upload the image\r\n- GET to fetch the thumbnail of the uploaded image\r\n\r\nIn the above test, every image upload consists of only the following request:\r\n- POST to upload the image",

However as of CONF-45506 this is fixed in Confluence Instance Health 2.1.10. There is an upgrade task that will create the file if it doesn't exist, however if the file is deleted or removed somehow (say deleted in a migration) the file is not created again.\r\n\r\n\r\nLastly, note from screenshot that the Health Check UI reports a green tick for the End of Life Check.  That means \"The health check has passed successfully. No action is required.\"  This is incorrect/misleading.\r\n\r\n",

      "description": "h2. Problem summary\r\n\r\nWhen Confluence's server.xml is configured to run over SSL, the healthcheck URL continues to use the HTTP protocol to reach synchrony-proxy, which causes a failure as the request should be\u00a0over HTTPS.\r\nh2. Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nInstall Confluence 6.0.2 to run over SSL (e.g. port 8443) at the Tomcat level (no external proxy involved). Self-signed cert is ok as long as it is imported into the Java trust store that Confluence is using.\r\n\r\nAfter\u00a0startup, observe the following repeated in logs:\r\n{code:java}\r\n2016-12-13 17:28:52,918 WARN [synchrony-interop-executor:thread-1] [plugins.synchrony.bootstrap.DefaultSynchronyProxyMonitor] pollHealthcheck Could not ping the synchrony-proxy [http://localhost:8443/synchrony-proxy/healthcheck]: \r\norg.apache.http.NoHttpResponseException: The target server failed to respond\r\n{code}\r\nHealthcheck URL should be [https://localhost:8443/synchrony-proxy/healthcheck] (HTTPS) rather than plain HTTP.\r\nh2. Workaround\r\n 1. Enable the standard HTTP connector port in the {{server.xml}} file, for example:\r\n{code:java}\r\n<Connector port=\"8090\" connectionTimeout=\"20000\" redirectPort=\"8443\"\r\n                maxThreads=\"48\" minSpareThreads=\"10\"\r\n                enableLookups=\"false\" acceptCount=\"10\" debug=\"0\" URIEncoding=\"UTF-8\"\r\n                protocol=\"org.apache.coyote.http11.Http11NioProtocol\"/>\r\n{code}\r\n\r\n 2. Disable the healthcheck request by setting a system property *synchrony.proxy.healthcheck.disabled* to true (in setenv.sh or setenv.bat) in Confluence 6.1.0 (when it's released). For example:\r\n{code:java}\r\nCATALINA_OPTS=\"-Dsynchrony.proxy.healthcheck.disabled=true ${CATALINA_OPTS}\"\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nIf you are running Confluence as a Windows Service, access the [Java Options|https://confluence.atlassian.com/confkb/how-to-set-system-properties-for-confluence-running-as-a-service-on-windows-873858384.html] and add this line:\r\n\r\n{code}\r\n-Dsynchrony.proxy.healthcheck.disabled=true\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nThe 1st workaround is already included in our documentation as below:\r\n - [Troubleshooting collaborative editing|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Troubleshooting+Collaborative+Editing]\r\n - [Running Confluence Over SSL or HTTPS|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Running+Confluence+Over+SSL+or+HTTPS]\r\n\r\nThe 2nd workaround will be added in the same documentation when 6.1 is released. This ticket will now be resolved since the workarounds have been provided.",

Our users either have to subscribe to all blog posts (which often means they are receiving a lot of unnecessary email notifications and getting frustrated) or they are going to many spaces one at a time to watch each individual blog. It would be really helpful for there to be a quick way for them to choose which space blogs are applicable to them. The Space Directory seems like a great place for them to be able to go down the list and quickly choose which space blogs they are interested in. Perhaps if they could even choose an entire category with one click, that would be really nice. I think this is a feature that would make our users extremely happy. Thank you!",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFCLOUD-45513].\n  {panel}\n\n*Use case:*\r\n\r\nWe allow some external users to access our internal company Confluence. This is done using a LDAP user directory, so new external users are synchronized automatically when they have a special Confluence right. Sometimes we don't grant access to any space but plan to do so later. So some users have access to our Confluence but shouldn't have access to any Space. But if they login, the Welcome screen forces users to watch a Space. It seems to be if they aren't allowed to see any Space, the Welcome screen chooses a random Space for suggestion. The user can't skip the process, so he watches the space he shouldn't be able to see. From now on he can see the space but isn't listed in the permission setting for that Space. So one can't also detect or remove the permission.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n*Steps to reproduce:*\r\n * Have the Welcome screen enabled (for all modules)\r\n * Add fresh user to Confluence\r\n * Assign the user to a group without default space permissions (global permissions \"can use\", but not listed under default space permissions)\r\n * Login as that user\r\n * Skip intro\r\n * Skip also next page (thats the personal space page setup? not sure but also not important for this)\r\n * Check the suggested Space for watching\r\n * Open that space\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n*Actual result:*\r\n * User can see a space\r\n * User is not listed when checking the space permissions\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n*Expected result:*\r\n * 3rd welcome screen is skipped because he can't watch any space\r\n * User can't see any space\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nWe had this issue multiple times, I can not guarantee that users see what they are meant to see.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n*Workaround for +future situations+:*\r\n * Skip welcome screen ([https://confluence.atlassian.com/confkb/how-to-skip-the-welcome-action-for-new-users-in-confluence-777016501.html)]\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n*Workaround for +past situations:+*\r\n * ???\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nI need something like:\r\n * Find out which users can see spaces they shouldn't see\r\n * Remove their access to those spaces\r\n\r\nOur Confluence version is 5.9.8.",

It would be helpful to be able to mention someone in that comment to basically share the page with them. Something like \"Making some changes after talking to Team Y. @JDoe, can you take a look\"? This would help users elevate certain page updats about others where it's most important for them to engage.",

Right now, updates are Created, Updated, or Commented (More or less). Particularly on comments, it would be helpful to be able to distinguish between comments on a page I wrote or in direct response to one of my comments as compared to a comment on a page in a space I'm watching wholly. I'm sure there are more granular levels, but having the emails say \"There is one new comment on a page you wrote\" or \"John Smith responded to your comment\" or \"There is one new comment on a page in a space you're watching\" would be helpful for triaging.",

It thinks it's being friendly but when you use too many words and sell me on something I'm already using, that's not friendly. It's annoying. Plus, it takes forever to get the answers I'm looking for because they are not the primary purpose of the writing.\u00a0\r\n\r\nHere's an example from your Pages and Blogs documentation. I went there when I was looking for how to create a page that hangs off a main page. Pages and Blogs sounded like a reasonable place to start. Here's what I got:\r\n\"When you create any content in Confluence - whether it's taking down some quick [notes from a meeting|https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/meeting-notes-blueprint-329975386.html], writing a [requirements page|https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/product-requirements-blueprint-329975392.html], or letting your teammates know about the company's latest marketing push - you'll either be creating it as a [page|https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/create-and-edit-pages-139476.html] or a [blog post|https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/blog-posts-834222533.html]. You may be shocked to know that this page you're reading now, is, in fact, a Confluence page!\r\n\r\nPages and blog posts are the two things that allow you to capture and share information in Confluence, and which one you use depends on what you want to do with your content. If you want the information to last, and possibly evolve over time, then you likely want to create a page; if the information is specific mainly to the current time-frame, and isn't going to change over time, then you'll most likely want to create it as a blog post. These aren't hard-and-fast rules; they're just pointers to give you a place to start.\"\r\n\r\nHere's a rewrite that's actually aimed at people who are looking for answers, not friends or marketing garbage.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\"When you create any content in Confluence you are creating a\u00a0[page|https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/create-and-edit-pages-139476.html]\u00a0or a\u00a0[blog post|https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/blog-posts-834222533.html]. \u00a0For instance, the page you're reading now is a Confluence page.\r\n\r\nCreate a page when you want the information to last, and possibly evolve over time.\r\n\r\nCreate a blog post if the information is time-specific and will not change over time.\r\n\r\nThese aren't hard-and-fast rules; they're just pointers to give you a place to start.\"\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nSee how I did that?

Environment\r\n* Confluence 5.10\r\n* Application Links plugin 6.0+\r\n\r\nh5. Steps to Reproduce\r\n* Create the link from the source instance\r\n* Under the *Connections* section, set both Local Authentication values for Outgoing and Incoming to *Disabled*.  \r\n* In the target instance, edit the link and set incoming authentication to OAuth. The outgoing authentication should be disabled for all authentication types.\r\n\r\nh5. Expected Results\r\nWhen creating an application link in one direction, it should display as correctly configured in the application links status page.\r\n\r\nh5. Actual Results\r\nAlthough this can be configured, we see a network error in the applink status\r\n\r\nh5. Workaround 1 \r\n* Create the link from the source instance\r\n* Under the *Connections* section, both Local Authentication values for Outgoing and Incoming to *Disabled*.  \r\n* In the target instance, edit the link and set incoming authentication to OAuth. The outgoing authentication should be disabled for all authentication types.\r\n\r\nThe application link status will still show a network error, but the application link will work in one direction from the source instance to the target instance.\r\n\r\nh5. Workaround 2\r\nShutdown Confluence and backup your database before making any of these changes. We recommend trying out these changes only in a test environment.\r\n# Go to Confluence and JIRA and remove all existing applinks \r\n# Shutdown Confluence\r\n# Backup the {{confluence_install/confluence/WEB-INF/atlassian-bundled-plugins}} folder\r\n# Follow our guide on [how to Remove Bundled or System Plugins|https://confluence.atlassian.com/confkb/how-to-remove-bundled-or-system-plugins-648544751.html] to remove the following JAR files from the {{confluence_install/confluence/WEB-INF/atlassian-bundled-plugins}} folder\r\n#* applinks-basicauth-plugin-5.2.2.jar  \r\n#* applinks-oauth-plugin-5.2.2.jar  \r\n#* applinks-trustedapps-plugin-5.2.2.jar\r\n#* applinks-cors-plugin-5.2.2.jar\t     \r\n#* applinks-plugin-5.2.2.jar\r\n# Download the following files attached to this ticket:\r\n#* [^applinks-basicauth-plugin-5.0.4.jar] \r\n#* [^applinks-oauth-plugin-5.0.4.jar] \r\n#* [^applinks-trustedapps-plugin-5.0.4.jar]\r\n#* [^applinks-cors-plugin-5.0.4.jar]\t     \r\n#* [^applinks-plugin-5.0.4.jar]\r\n# [Clear the plugin cache|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/CONFKB/How+to+clear+Confluence+plugins+cache]\r\n# Start Confluence \r\n\r\nh5.

Summary\r\nIf you re-install a plugin in one node while the plugin is disabled, it will cause an inconsistent state in the UPM where one node has the plugin enabled and the other node does not.\r\n\r\nh3. Environment\r\nConfluence Data Center\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Download a copy of the .OBR for the latest Gliffy release. (I am using Gliffy as an example, but this seems to happen with any plugin.)\r\n# On node 1, use the UPM to upload the Gliffy OBR.\r\n# On both node 1 and node 2, reload pages to verify that Gliffy is installed. (For example, you should see 3-4 sidebar items in each nodes' admin pages that link to Gliffy pages.)\r\n# On node 1, use the UPM to disable the Gliffy plugin.\r\n# On nodes 1 and 2, refresh the pages and note that the Gliffy links do not appear on any node.\r\n# On node 1, go back to the UPM and upload a new copy of the .OBR (without explicitly re-enabling the plugin).\r\n# On nodes 1 and 2, refresh the pages again. Notice that the Gliffy links appear on one node indicating that it is enabled, but those links are not visible on the other node. Additionally, Gliffy shows as enabled in the UPM for one node but disabled on the other.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nPlugin is enabled in both nodes\r\n\r\nh3.

I'm using Ansible for this task, but the same problem exists for all similar tools (Puppet, Chef, Salt, etc).\r\n\r\nThe *installation* can be done programmatically. But the *setup* part involves clicking through a wizard web interface to select the installation type, put in the license, configure the database, etc: https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/confluence-setup-guide-135691.html.\r\nThis prevents proper automation.\r\n\r\nI know that Stash exposes a REST API that can be used to automate some of these steps (for instance the license: https://developer.atlassian.com/static/rest/stash/3.11.3/stash-rest.html#idp1739392), but the Confluence REST API doesn't expose anything like this.\r\n\r\nSo at this point our devops process is stuck and we need to manually click through a wizard, which is a real pain.\r\n\r\nConfluence needs to be able to get deployed without manual intervention.\r\n\r\nThis can either be done by providing options during install, for instance using a simple configuration file with license, install type, plugins to include.\r\n\r\nOr extend the REST API to handle these.",
