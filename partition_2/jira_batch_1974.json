Because of this behavior, admins can't manage permissions to create Spaces (both Communal and Personal) for groups that are not being granted with product access.\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Create a test group on the Instance administration.\r\n # Grant Confluence access to this group.\r\n # Access the Global Permissions on Confluence.\u00a0\r\n # Grant to this group permission to *Create Space*.\r\n # On the Product Access configuration, revoke Confluence access for this group.\r\n # Access the Global Permissions on Confluence again.\u00a0\r\n\r\nh3.

You will continue to be able to upvote and track our progress.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nSam\r\n{panel}\r\nh3.

Steps to Reproduce\r\n# With [SAML SSO|https://support.atlassian.com/security-and-access-policies/docs/configure-saml-single-sign-on-with-an-identity-provider/] set up, navigate to *Site Administration > Site Access* and set your domain to be approved there, so users from that domain can join your site automatically;\r\n# Make sure you do not grant Confluence access for new users on *Site Administration > Product Access*;\r\n# Set your Confluence site and space with [anonymous access|https://support.atlassian.com/confluence-cloud/docs/set-up-public-access/] - for the space, just the *view* permission is enough;\r\n# Using a testing account under your approved domain, log in to https://id.atlassian.com/;\r\n# Make sure to have a link to a page from the space that is open for anonymous and access it with this user.\r\n\r\nh3.

      "description": "Hi Atlassian Team,\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nthere seems to be an inconsistent translation used within Confluence Cloud Administration menu that creates additional confusion related to the import functionality.\r\n\r\nThe highlighted text\u00a0refers to importing a whole Confluence Site, though \"*Seite* importieren\" can also be interpreted as importing a single \"Confluence *Page*\".\u00a0\r\n\r\nTherefore, it is suggested to update this translation to \"Confluence Site importieren\" or \"Site importieren\" - considering that the term *Site* is already widely used (e.g. referring to the second screenshot or [https://www.atlassian.com/de/software/confluence/guides/get-started/set-up]\u00a0as examples)\r\n\r\n\u00a0 !image-2021-04-23-16-20-45-845.png!!image-2021-04-23-16-20-29-805.png!",
