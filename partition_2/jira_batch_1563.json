      "description": "h2. Current Scenario\r\nWhen any user is managing the [Page Restrictions|https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/page-restrictions-139414.html] from the web UI they are forcibly included in the page restriction before making any modification.\r\n\r\nSee the example below:\r\n * Logged user: admin002\r\n * Current page restrictions:\r\n  !page_restriction_img008.png|thumbnail! \r\n * *admin002* clicks on the padlock in the page view mode.\r\n  !page_restriction_img009.png|thumbnail! \r\n * *admin002* is compulsorily added to the restrictions of that page and cannot remove himself.\r\n  !page_restriction_img010.png|thumbnail!\r\n \r\nThis may be fine for regular users of Confluence, but should not be applied to administrators that are part of the [confluence-administrators group|https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/confluence-groups-for-administrators-138706.html].\r\n\r\nConsider the following example:\r\n* *admin002* is hired as a Confluence administrator and added to {{confluence-administrators}} group.\r\n* There is a Space which is opened to every user.\r\n ** Within this Space, there is a *page* that is restricted to a few users.\r\n  !page_restriction_img001.png|thumbnail! \r\n* *admin002* receives a request to add *user001* as an editor of the above page.\r\n ** *admin002* should not be an editor of this page, but will have access to it, since he is included in the {{confluence-administrators}} group.\r\n* While adding *user001* as and editor of that page, restrictions to *admin002* is automatically added too.\r\n ** *admin002* can't remove himself from the restrictions.\r\n !page_restriction_img002.png|thumbnail! !page_restriction_img003.png|thumbnail! \r\n* *admin002* moves to another role within the organization and is removed from the {{confluence-administrators}} group.\r\n ** Because of the previous task, *admin002* has access to a page he shouldn't have.\r\n !page_restriction_img006.png|thumbnail! \r\n* *admin* discovers about the above and removes *admin002* access to that page.\r\n* Now *admin* has direct access to the restricted page.\r\n!page_restriction_img007.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\nIn the above example, the Confluence administrator should have the option to change the page restrictions without being forcibly added to it.\r\n\r\nThe same problem occurs if trying the experimental REST API method {{/rest/experimental/content/<page ID>/restriction/byOperation/read/user?userName=<user name>}} as a Confluence administrator, but without direct access to the content, then you cannot change the restrictions.\r\nSee the REST API error below.\r\n{code}\r\n{\r\n    \"statusCode\": 400,\r\n    \"data\": {\r\n        \"authorized\": true,\r\n        \"valid\": false,\r\n        \"errors\": [\r\n            {\r\n                \"message\": {\r\n                    \"translation\": \"Provided ContentRestrictions evicts current user (you) from: [read]. Must include yourself in \\\"user\\\" sections for READ and/or UPDATE when restricting those operations. Must not provide restrictions which when applied result in current situation.\",\r\n                    \"args\": []\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n        ],\r\n        \"successful\": false\r\n    },\r\n    \"message\": \"Provided ContentRestrictions evicts current user (you) from: [read]. Must include yourself in \\\"user\\\" sections for READ and/or UPDATE when restricting those operations. Must not provide restrictions which when applied result in current situation.\"\r\n}\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nThis also doesn't take into consideration if the user performing a change on the page restriction is part of a group that is already added in the restriction.\r\nConsider the following example:\r\n * *admin002* is part of group {{confluence-users}}.\r\n * {{confluence-users}} has a view/edit restriction to a certain page.\r\n !page_restriction_img011.png|thumbnail!\r\n * To make any modification on the page restriction, *admin002* will be compulsorily added to it, without taking into consideration the group based restriction.\r\n !page_restriction_img011.png|thumbnail!\r\n \r\n\r\nh2. Expected Scenario\r\nBased on the current scenario described above, this is what is expected as a Confluence design:\r\n # If a user is part of the {{confluence-administrators}}, they should not be compulsorily added to the page restrictions when modifying it from the web UI.\r\n  #* In addition to this, it should not require a direct restriction to be in place when using the REST API.\r\n # If a user is part of a group that is already in the page restrictions, the user shouldn't need a direct restriction to make modifications to it.\r\n  #* The same should apply to REST API calls, effective group restrictions should be taken into account.\r\n\r\nh2. Workaround\r\nThere are two known workarounds to this issue, which are described below.\r\n\r\nh4. Page Information\r\nThis only works if you need to remove a restriction. It doesn't work if you need to include one.\r\nAs Confluence or Space administrator do the following:\r\n # Access the Page Information page.\r\n !page_restriction_img013.png|thumbnail!\r\n # In the _Page Permissions_ section, click on the padlock on the side of the restriction you want to remove.\r\n !page_restriction_img014.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nh4. JSON RPC API \r\nWhile the REST API doesn't have all the necessary methods implemented, the deprecated RPC API is still bundled with Confluence.\r\nBefore using it, make sure [it is enabled|https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/enabling-the-remote-api-150460.html].\r\nConsider using these two JSON-RPC API methods to change the restrictions of a certain page:\r\n * {{getContentPermissionSet(String token, String contentId, String permissionType)}}\r\n{quote}\r\nreturns the set of permissions on a page as a map of type to a list of ContentPermission, for the type of permission which is either \u2018View\u2019 or \u2018Edit\u2019\r\n{quote}\r\n * {{setContentPermissions(String token, String contentId, String permissionType, Vector permissions)}}\r\n{quote}\r\nsets the page-level permissions for a particular permission type (either \u2018View\u2019 or \u2018Edit\u2019) to the provided vector of ContentPermissions.

This can cause performance issues on the Confluence node that you're on.\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n - Generate a space with 20,000 pages or more (testing notes are placed into an internal comment)\r\n - As an site admin user, restrict view/edit of an arbitrary set of pages in the space\r\n - Create a user with basic permissions\r\n - In a new browser session, login to Confluence with this new user's credentials and go to the space and go to the Space Tools cog > \"Reorder Pages\".\r\n - The expected page tree won't be displayed on the page, but a spinning wheel icon will be shown on the _Reorder Pages_ tab instead.\r\n(i)\u00a0The same issue is also being observed should the space-admin user performs the same steps.\u00a0\r\n\r\nh3. Diagnosis\r\n - In thread dumps, calls to the \"children.action\" endpoint will show up in thread dumps if you have Thready installed. This corresponds to the same process IDs that have the highest CPU usage.\r\n - The threads will eventually clear and complete the action (unclear if the action times out and the end user gives up or if it actually renders). Thus, it will show as a big spike that can cause alerting platforms to send out warning alarms outside of normal baseline.\r\n - It's not clear if this can actually cause an outage or not. All tests thus far have been on an AWS m4.4xlarge instance with 16 GB of JVM heap and no active users.\r\n - We saw this take place multiple times for an Enterprise customer that caused concern, but no outages resulted as part of this action.\r\n\r\nh3. Performance Points\r\n - Accessing the \"Reorder Pages\" space tool can be done by any user that has access to the space. Even users who are unable to edit pages in a space and have only View rights can still go to the page and trigger the same calls.\r\n - These calls appear to go to the database directly instead of to cache or an index of some kind. In other words, it uses an expensive method to retrieve the data it needs.\r\n - By itself, this likely will not cause outages, but if there are several large spaces or specific users attempting to access the same tool at the same time, it could potentially kick off multiple threads.\r\n - This seems to be more of a scaling issue than anything - smaller spaces don't actually seem to encounter this issue at all.",

Expected Results\r\n\r\nBroken links to be shown in red color, even in Edit Mode\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nBroken links are shown in blue color in Edit Mode\r\nh3. Notes\r\n\r\nIt has worked as expected at some point, however, in newer versions that functionality was lost.\r\n https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFCLOUD-53848 shows it worked before.\r\n{quote}Working in Confluence Server: 5.9.4\r\n{quote}\r\n\u00a0\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nPublish the affected page and the link will change to red.",

In Confluence 5.6, license changes are propagated to other nodes using the cluster event {{InternalLicenceUpdatedEvent}}.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that if a node is not active when a license is installed, it will not receive the cluster event {{InternalLicenceUpdatedEvent}}.\r\n\r\nA more robust mechanism needs to be implemented, that handles nodes being down. Initial suggestions are:\r\n\r\n- Store the license details in the shared home directory, and not the {{confluence.cfg.xml}} file. This will require cluster locking when updating the license details. Will also need to broadcast the cluster event {{InternalLicenceUpdatedEvent}}.\r\n\r\n- Use the Journal service to propagate changes. Advantage is that the license details are still stored in the {{confluence.cfg.xml}} file. The downside is that license changes are not immediate. Not an ideal solution, but mentioned as a brain dump.",

The reason seems to be down to a class called .innercell.\r\n\r\nThis class would be best automated to 'overflow visible' as I believe that most users would like their input to resize with their page rather than go into a scroll bar.\r\n\r\nCan we suggest\u00a0 that the default css is .innercell \\{overflow: visible;} which would overcome this headache?\r\n\r\nI may be wrong but I've found this to be the solution on a regular basis. Alternatively it could be added as an option (scroll or show oversized\u00a0images)\u00a0rather than forcing users to implement an html fix manually.\r\n\r\nThanks",
