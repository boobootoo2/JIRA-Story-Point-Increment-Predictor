I'm able to define groups, add groups, get a users groups, etc... but the one thing that is missing is being able to get all users in a specific group. Here at Rambus, they have groups for each manager (they contain their subordinates). When a manager quits or leaves, the subordinates all get reassigned to the new manager and get removed from the old manager group via my integration. There is nothing in the raw data that feeds the integration that says \"a manager quit\"... I just get a different set of Groups for the given set of users. Example, some one moves out of Testing and into Support, they get a new manager and the integration will remove the user from the old manager and add the the new manager (note that nobody quit... its just a different group assignment). The problem is that I don't have an easy to know when a group is empty and I can delete it as ongoing maintenance (i.e a manager quits and nobody will ever be in that group again). They have dozens and dozens of groups so ongoing it will become an issue with all kinds of empty groups of terminated managers. If there was a \r\n    Vector getAllUsersForGroup(String token, String groupName)\r\nmethod, that would solve the issue. I could use a getGroups call in conjunction with getAllUsersForGroup to perform the ongoing maintenance without any admin/UI interaction (what Rambus is looking for... let the integration project manage all that stuff without any administrator maintenance). Thanks for the help.",
