If you're experiencing an issue with Chrome, please see https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFSERVER-55177.\r\n\r\nThe issues have similar symptoms but have different causes and affect different browsers and IMEs.\r\n{panel}\r\n{panel:bgColor=#e7f4fa}\r\n*NOTE:* This bug report is for *Confluence Server*. Using *Confluence Cloud*? [See the corresponding bug report|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFCLOUD-38758].\r\n{panel}\r\nh3. Summary\r\n\r\nUsers cannot type double byte characters (i.e. Japanese, Korean, Chinese) in Sections in Confluence pages when using the Microsoft IME through IE11 (see below).\r\nh3. Environment\r\n * IE11 (the problem did not occur in Firefox and Chrome)\r\n * Microsoft IME (the problem did not occur in [Google Japanese IME|https://www.google.co.jp/ime/])\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Install a vanilla Confluence 5.8.8\r\n # Log in using Microsoft Internet Explorer 11 with Microsoft IME enabled\r\n # Create a space and click the \"Create\" button to create a page\r\n # In page edit mode, create a section in body field using the page editor controls\r\n # Try to type double byte characters (i.e. Japanese, Korean, Chinese)\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nUsers can type double byte characters. Specifically '\u3042' will be shown when typing 'a' when using Japanese IME.\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nUsers cannot type double byte characters. Specifically 'a' will be shown when typing 'a' even when using Japanese IME.\r\n No exceptions are thrown in the atlassian-confluence.log file, or the browser error console.\r\n \u00a0\r\nh3. Notes\r\n - Users cannot type double characters but they can copy/paste the characters\r\n\r\nh3. Workarounds\r\n - Use different a browser aside from IE11\r\n - Use another IME aside from Microsoft's IME (i.e. [Google Japanese IME|https://www.google.co.jp/ime/%20for%20Japanese])\r\n - Instead of creating pages using page sections, use Section Macros. These are available on the macro browser.\r\n - Create content outside of Confluence, then copy/paste into Confluence page sections\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n!theProblem.jpg|width=488,height=366!",

Improvement\r\nLock the top bar (also incorrectly - in Confluence parlance - referred to by users as menu bar or navigation bar or header) for continuous access to menus, navigation buttons, search field, etc.\r\nh3. Current Status\r\nThe top bar is not fixed and thus menus, navigation buttons, etc. are no longer immediately accessible when vertically scrolling to read content. \r\nh3. Use Case\r\nIf I am reading a comment and want to view another page (either simultaneously in another window or separately in another tab) +without losing my current place+, I need direct and constant access to the top bar. Otherwise, by scrolling up or using shortcuts to access the top navigation bar, my current location in the page is lost and I must scroll down again to the previous location.\r\n*Typical example:*\r\nWhile reading the comments on a page, you find one that you are sure was discussed in a meeting, the notes of which are in another Space. The _Home_ or _Pos1_ key will generally take you back to the top of a page, while the shortcut _GG_ puts the focus in the search field. Unfortunately, all of these cause you to lose your position on the current page. As such, you can not use the top bar components (buttons, search field, etc) to open another browser tab/window without losing the current page position. This is particularly inconvenient for quickly viewing two or more Confluence pages simultaneously.\r\nh3. Related Cases\r\n[CONF-38219] addresses the same issue, but was ambiguously described and taken to be a suggestion for creating a special page template.\r\n[JRA-27758]\r\nJRA-21963\r\n",

Summary\r\nThere is a known compatibility issue that prevents the user management synchronisation between JIRA 6.4 and Confluence 5.7.x and above. \r\n\r\nThis will only affect you if you use JIRA to manage your Confluence users. The bug in JIRA is being tracked on [JRA-42566|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRA-42566].\r\n\r\n\\\\\r\nh5. Environment\r\n-  Confluence version: 5.7.x, 5.8.x\r\n- JIRA version: 6.4\r\n\r\n\\\\\r\nh5. Steps to Reproduce\r\n- Case 1\r\n-# Set up Confluence 5.7.x and above with JIRA 6.4 configured as its User Management Server. To perform that, please refer to [Connecting Confluence to JIRA for user management|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Connecting+to+Crowd+or+JIRA+for+User+Management#ConnectingtoCrowdorJIRAforUserManagement-ConnectingConfluencetoJIRAforUserManagement].\r\n-# Perform Synchronisation.\r\n- Case 2\r\n-# Install Confluence 5.7.x and above as per the [Confluence Setup Guide|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Confluence+Setup+Guide] documentation.\r\n(i) Instead of managing users and groups within Confluence itself, choose _Connect to JIRA_ and setup [JIRA External User Management|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Confluence+Setup+Guide#ConfluenceSetupGuide-8.SetupusermanagementUserMan] (JIRA 6.4 instance) instead.\r\n\r\n\\\\\r\nh5.

In Confluence >= 5.6 we observed some weird behaviour as soon as we called History.pushState: first, our code is run, but then the page suddenly reloads.\r\n\r\nI spent quite some time tracking this issue down and found the responsible JS code in the module com.atlassian.confluence.plugins.quickedit:editor-view-resources. The module globally binds the \"popstate\" event:\r\n{code}\r\n$(window).bind(\"popstate\", handleEvent(handleNavigationEvent, popStateFilters));\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nLater on, the method _actuallyNavigatePlease_ finally triggers a call to _window.location.reload()_. It seems that this call is really made globally any time the browser history is changed (when onpopstate is triggered). History.js triggeres the popstate event upon pushState, so the library is actually unusable in Confluence.\r\n\r\n*EDIT:*\r\nThis issue actually not only makes History.js unusable but also the whole native browser History API. If you call pushState on the browser-native history object and click back in the browser afterwards, the popstate event will be triggered and Confluence will reload the page! This cannot be desired behaviour!",

Perhaps the lines would be visible only when the comment box gets moused over.\r\nAs comments are mapped at the paragraph level, and as a single paragraph may have multiple comments, this scheme may get tangled quickly\r\n\r\nAn alternative would be:\r\n* _Based on the fact that the (very) pale blue megaphone icon indicates a paragraph has a comment associated with it._\r\n* each comment box has some unique identifier at its top, say, a serial (index) number.   The # would be displayed about as visibly as the commenter's name.\r\n* either overlay the (very) pale blue megaphone with the comment identifier, or, display the comment identifier associated with the  (v)PBM _when it gets moused-over.)\r\n\r\nHere's my use case:\r\n* I'm commenting on a document.\r\n* A lot.\r\n* I made a long comment at para. 5.\r\n* Then I made comments at paras 6, 8, & 9.   Strangely, the para 5 comment continues to float below (further down the page) as I create these new comments, getting further & further away from its home paragraph.\r\n* I edited the para 5 comment to note that it relates to para 5.\r\n* After the change to the para 5 comment, *_it_* now aligns with para 5.   The para 6, 8, & 9 comments, however, remain _above_ the para 5 comment, so now _they_ are super displaced from their relevant texts.\r\nI'm hoping this comment disordering issue has already been addressed.\r\nThe issue of easily associating comments with their paragraphs remains, and is particularly painful when many comments are present.\r\n\r\nI'm working in Firefox, and I've saved the page in .maff, mhtml and \"as complete webpage\" formats.   I will attach 1 or all to this ticket, in case it might benefit you.  That's why I'm indicating \"Security Level\" != \"None\"",

[See the corresponding bug report|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFCLOUD-38708].\n  {panel}\n\nThe Atlassian SDK atlas-create* commands do not trim spaces from class names. This results in a skeleton plugin with broken imports and packages. The error message in the IDE recommends to fix this issue by refactoring the class \"from  a.b.c to a.b.c\", which looks redundant to a human reader. At second look, I see it was generated with illegal whitespace in the code, and in directory names.\r\n\r\nI likely introduced the spaces into the wizard by copying and pasting the groupId and artifactId etc from another terminal window (e.g. selected an extra space before the groupId by accident). I assume the same problem can also happen at all other steps, e.g. where we rename MyServlet.java. \r\n\r\nNo class or package can start with space anyway. Atlas-create* should just trim it, and not generate a needlessly broken skeleton. \r\n\r\nExamples of inconsistencies:\r\n\r\n* MyPluginComponent.java and MyPluginComponentImpl.java start with \"package  too.many.spaces;\" \r\n* pom.xml says: \"<groupId>too.many.spaces</groupId>\"\r\n* atlassian-plugin.xml says: <component key=\"myPluginComponent\" class=\" too.many.spaces.MyPluginComponentImpl\" public=\"true\"><interface>too.many.spaces.MyPluginComponent</interface></component>\r\n* atlassian-plugin.xml says: <servlet name=\"My Servlet\" i18n-name-key=\"my-servlet.name\" key=\"my-servlet\" class=\"too.many.spaces.servlet.MyServlet\">\r\n* Also the test files have spaces in package and import.\r\n* Extra whitespace in directory names such as \" just-testing\".\r\n\r\nReproduce:\r\n\r\n{{C:\\Users\\someone\\TEST>atlas-create-confluence-plugin\r\n[...]\r\nDefine value for groupId: :  too.many.spaces\r\nDefine value for artifactId: :  just-testing\r\nDefine value for version:  1.0-SNAPSHOT: :\r\nDefine value for package:   too.many.spaces: :\r\nConfirm properties configuration:\r\ngroupId:  too.many.spaces\r\nartifactId:  just-testing\r\nversion: 1.0-SNAPSHOT\r\npackage:  too.many.spaces\r\n Y: : Y\r\n[...]\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\nC:\\Users\\someone\\TEST>cd \" just-testing\"\r\nC:\\Users\\someone\\TEST\\ just-testing>atlas-create-confluence-plugin-module\r\n[...]\r\n[INFO] --- maven-confluence-plugin:5.0.13:create-plugin-module (default-cli) @ just-testing ---\r\nChoose Plugin Module: \r\n[...]\r\n[INFO] Adding the following items to the project:\r\n[INFO]   [class: it.too.many.spaces.servlet.MyServletFuncTest]\r\n[INFO]   [class: too.many.spaces.servlet.MyServlet]\r\n[INFO]   [class: ut.too.many.spaces.servlet.MyServletTest]\r\n[...]\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\nC:\\Users\\someone\\TEST\\ just-testing>\r\n}}\r\n\r\n",

This means that you have to specify a specific page name, so it can't be used when creating templates. What's needed is the equivalent of the Space function currentSpace() to allow users to specify that the page on which the macro appears is the intended ancestor/parent, e.g. ancestor = currentPage().\r\n\r\nIt should be possible to use this in a template by (i.e.) adding @self as the ancestor value.\r\n\r\nPage Properties Report should replace Matadata Report, since this macro is no longer supported.

When we print we want to print the page precisely as it currently looks.
