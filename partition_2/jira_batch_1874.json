      "description": "Hi,\r\n\r\nWe are running Confluence 2.7 and JIRA 3.12.1 to successfully embed jira issue lists into Confluence pages using the jiraissues macro using the procedure described in the jiraissues documentation (ie clicking on the XML link in the navigator and using it as the url for the macro).\r\n\r\nThe problem that we've got is that when we click on the JIRA link in the displayed tables it takes us to the XML issue list view  in JIRA rather than the Issue Navigator.  This appears to be related to a change in JIRA in how the application constructs URLs for the XML view.  From looking at the macro documentation it appears that when you click on the XML link in the Issue Navigator in JIRA you should go to a page with url of the form:\r\n\r\n{quote}\r\nhttp://jira.atlassian.com/secure/IssueNavigator.jspa?view=rss&....\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nHowever in the latest version of jira you actually get a url of the form\r\n\r\n{quote}\r\nhttp://jira.atlassian.com/sr/jira.issueviews:searchrequest-xml/temp/SearchRequest.xml?&...\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nConsequently Confluence seems to get confused by the new url format and just uses the original source as the link.\r\n\r\nAs a workaround you can modify the url passed to the jiraissues macro to get things to work:\r\n\r\n* Replace \"/sr/jira.issueviews:searchrequest-xml/temp/SearchRequest.xml\" with \"/secure/IssueNavigator.jspa?view=rss\"\r\n* Add \"&reset=true\" to the url. If you don't do this you'll get an empty list of issues in your issue navigator!\r\n\r\nObviously this isn't ideal and is quite confusing for most users - particularly as it contradicts the jiraissues documentation.  Can this be addressed, please?\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nSimon\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

The problem is that LDAP bind requests are often greedy in resources for LDAP server so it would be preferable to make a single LDAP bind (to establish a LDAP session) and then send all the LDAP search requests for this user (in the same LDAP session). This is a general remark, when several LDAP requests must be sent by Confluence, it should be done with a single LDAP bind request. Is it possible to modify Confluence behaviour to reduce the number of LDAP bind requests?\r\n",

      "description": "ConfluenceCachingBandanaPersister retrieves entire contexts when asked for a single record.\r\n\r\nWhen Confluence retrieves configuration or plugin information from Bandana, one of the many levels of BandanaPersister is uses is the ConfluenceCachingBandanaPersister.  \r\nWhen the ConfluenceCachingBandnana's retrieve(context, key) method is called it first calls retrieve(context).\r\nThat call can look up the entire bandana context from the database.\r\nOn C.A.C, the global context includes various records about plugin usage statistics.  These can be 250k in size, and there are many of them.\r\nFurthermore, this caching layer is not preventing multiple copies of the same record getting into memory.  This is probably due to the special TransactionalCache that it uses, which isolates Cache updates between different threads.  That requires that different Sessions have their own copies of the context whenever the context is updated.  The context seems to be updated very frequently on confluence.atlassian.com, leading to many sessions in use containing about 20MB of data, most of which seems to be plugin data they shouldn't need to know.\r\n\r\nGiven that the ConfluenceBandanaRecord.hbm.xml file already specifies that the records should be cached, it seems possible that the ConfluenceCachingBandanaPersister and its cache could just be removed entirely.",

A solution might be to call _AbstractBeanFactory.destroyBean(..)_ insteat and reverse the order of the method calls in _unregisterBeanDefinition_ , but there might be additional pitfalls.

It has also been set up to use SSO (using Crowd).\r\n\r\nFor some strange reason that I haven't been able to figure out, in FireFox I often need to retry clicking a link when doing just about anything in Confluence, because the first time the action behaves in a very strange manner. This behaviour does not occur when using Internet Explorer. I have no add-ons installed in FireFox.\r\n\r\nExample 1: when I click the Dashboard link on the breadcrumbs path, the first time I click, I get a FireFox pop-up asking me if I want to download dashboard.action. I click cancel, click Dashboard again and it works as expected.\r\n\r\nExample 2: I've set up a space with a custom logo. Any link I click, links me to that logo (initially), as if I'd right-clicked the logo and selected \"Show image\". Go back, click the link again and it works as expected. Something similar happens when I'm not logged in: click the login link, I get linked to the global logo. Back, click again: it works...\r\n\r\nThe strange thing is: it doesn't happen *always*, just most of the time. I haven't been able to determine a pattern as to when it does or doesn't happen.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't matter whether I'm logged in or not. I've verified this on two machines.\r\n\r\nFWIW, I have encountered no such problems with other Atlassian apps, nor with other Confluence instances (like your own, or our previous installation). I've never seen links do one thing one time and another thing the next, either (non-JavaScript links that is). I'm totally and completely stumped.",
