The default field could easily by the contentId, sort order default to ASC to deliver current output, surely an afternoons work :) , enabling api to set sortOrder=DESC would surely be useful in a wider context?\r\n\r\nIf this is already logged somewhere (surely! but I couldn't find it), please link when marking as a duplicate.",

Unfortunately when we go to PDF them we are unable to get a PDF that doesn't cut off a large section of the right margin of the page or skew some of the column widths. I have tried using the Tools>Export to PDF, which returns the worst result, as well as File>Print then PDF>Save As PDF, which returns a closer result, but still losing a lot of data.\r\n\r\nI have attached 2 screen shots that show what we see on our screens, and would like the PDFs to look like, as well as PDF attachments of the 2 approaches to PDFing the page.",

I can't find anywhere exactly _what_ those dimensions are, but my bigger problem is that the system provides no feedback whatsoever when this happens. When you apply image effects to a large photo, it lets you do it just fine, but it doesn't display the effect. This leads to a lot of confusion for the user--why isn't it working? Is it a problem with my computer? The image? The page?\r\n\r\nIf it were me, I would improve it as follows:\r\n\r\n*Improve Documentation*\r\n# Update the documentation to explain the outer limits of when image effects will be applied\r\n# When a user applies an effect to an image that is too large, provide feedback to the effect of \"This image is too large for effects to be applied. Please resize to be less than ____px by _____px if you would like to display image effects.\"\r\n\r\n*Make the constraints larger*\r\nImages that are 1600px by 500px should work, but it doesn't. These constraints should be more lenient. Why is there a limit at all? Is it a memory issue (like this [knowledge base|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/CONFKB/Image+effects+are+not+displayed+in+Confluence+5.5+or+later] article implies), or is there another reason?\r\n\r\n*To recreate the problem...*\r\n* Upload an image to the wiki that's bigger than 1599 by 449 pixels. \r\n* Click on the image, and select \"Properties\" from the pop-up menu\r\n* Click any of the image effects that appear in the window\r\n* Save the changes, and observe that the image doesn't look any different.\r\n* Wish there was feedback to explain why the effect wasn't applied",

Steps to reproduce:\r\n# Have a space that has contain many pages with the same label\r\n# Go to Popular Label page by either:\r\n#* Browse > Labels on Documentation theme\r\n#* Access using \"Popular Labels\" macro\r\n#* Access the Labelled Content page directly using the URL: http://<Confluence Base URL>/labels/listlabels-alphaview.action?key=<SPACEKEY>\r\n# Choose the label that labels many pages in this space\r\n# the \"Labeled Content\" page show up with a list of pages that has the same label. Below is an example of the label \"decisions\"\r\n!Capture.PNG|thumbnail!\r\n# Note that the URL is currently:\r\n{code}\r\nhttp://http://<Confluence Base URL>//label/<SPACEKEY>/<Label chosen>\r\n{code}\r\n# Click Next >> to view the next page\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nEverything that's displayed in the page is still the same except that the next page is shown.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nThe label now is duplicated and both of them has become \"-decisions\" \"-decisions\"\r\n!Capture1.PNG|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nh3. Further observations\r\nFor an example of Confluence that has a base URL of http://localhost:15910/confluence, label named \"decisions\" with label ID of 1015809\r\n\r\nNote that the URL changes to the following after clicking \"next\" from the first page:\r\n{code}\r\nhttp://localhost:15910/confluence/label/5910/decisions?ids=1015809&startIndex=10\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nIf we press the Next button even further, URL changes into the following:\r\n{code}\r\nhttp://localhost:15910/confluence/label/5910/decisions?ids=1015809&ids=1015809&startIndex=20\r\n{code}\r\nNote that the \"ids=1015809\" is duplicated\r\n\r\n \r\nh3.

There are also good reasons to stick with the default UI, because users benefit from Atlassian's ongoing investment in the Confluence user experience.\r\n\r\nHowever, many customers would like the ability to brand their Confluence OnDemand instance beyond the current colour and space logo options.\r\n\r\nA happy medium between the two might be to provide some additional header and footer configuration options:\r\n\r\n1. Allow a background image in the header and allow the header to grow up to an additional 40px in height, if desired (see attached example). This would make the header the same height as when the \"temporary access to administrative functions\" warning is displayed.\r\n2. Allow a custom footer, implemented in a similar fashion to the site welcome message that would appear before the current footer (but not replace it). This could be used to create a \"fat footer\" for navigation or links to site terms and conditions etc.\r\n\r\nThis custom header would require some modification to the current navigation bar design:\r\n- include a text only option instead of just logo + text or logo. Ideally the 'home' link text could be defined separately to the Site Title. This is because the customer's logo could instead be included in the background image.\r\n- change the dimensions of the link hover behaviour so that the background is the same size as the 'Create' button.",

As a use case, it would be nice to be able to copy content from external websites (e.g. a list of selected MOOC courses) into ALM for sharing with colleagues, but without the View Storage Format to see the syntax for various Confluence macros, I'm limited putting everything into an HTML macro. Keeping things Confluence-centric would be much preferred. Additionally, being able to prototype content in Confluence and look at the XML would make this process considerable easier. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, in my organization, only selected people from our enterprise IT group are Confluence admins (for many good reasons) and access to the [\"View Storage Format\"|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Confluence+Storage+Format] option isn't configurable. Considering the syntax is openly available, I'm not sure why the option is so restricted. Recommend making it available on a group basis or as a profile setting.",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFCLOUD-36075].\n  {panel}\n\nA customizable \"*Empty trash*\" mechanism which would automatically purge from each space trash all deleted files whose deletion is dated before a customizable time range value. The frequence of the purge could also be customizable.\r\n\r\nThe function would be customized through the following interfaces:\r\n* a site admin interface where site-wide defaults are defined (with \"Never purge\" as a possible choice)\r\n* a space admin interface where site-wide defaults can be overridden by local values\r\n\r\nAdvantages of regularly purging deleted pages through such a mechanism would include:\r\n* releasing unneeded data and database space\r\n* preventing side effects and problems, such as the one documented in [Page cannot be moved between spaces due to existing duplicate in trash|https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/r4QtKQ]\r\n* eliminating the time-consuming (and needless) chore for admins to manually sort and purge deleted files\r\n* by-passing a limitation of the present \"Trash\" listing, where there is no \"Deleted on\" column on which a selective purge could be based",
