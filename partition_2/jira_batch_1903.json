This is different than issue -CONF-3701- which talks about restricting permissions.\r\n\r\nIn many instances customers have offered a scenario where they have a somewhat restricted space but want to open up individual pages to a larger audience. For instance a technical team might want to open up a specification page to a larger audience, but don't want to open up everything and don't want to create a new space just for the spec. page.\r\n\r\nThis might be similar to a scaled down version of the process by which users and groups are given access to view and edit spaces....though this feature would be just for individual pages with the control most likely being offered on the page itself, as with the ability to restrict access.\r\n\r\nThis is a related issue, though not clearly defined: -CONF-5682-\r\n\r\nThere is also the case where a page needs to be open to viewing by anonymous users in a space which is otherwise inaccessible. If this issue were implemented, the UI should allow permitting anonymous access. (This was originally raised as -CONF-10316-.)\r\n\r\n{panel:title=Atlassian Update, October 29 2018|borderStyle=solid|borderColor=#3C78B5|titleBGColor=#3C78B5|bgColor=#E7F4FA}\r\nHi all,\r\n\r\nThanks for all your votes and comments on this suggestion.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019re planning on making a number of improvements to Confluence permissions over the coming 6-9 months, and this is one of the suggestions we\u2019re strongly considering implementing. We fully appreciate the current difficulties involved in not being able to \u2018add\u2019 page restrictions within a hierarchy which is overall more restrictive.\r\n\r\nWe haven\u2019t started investigating the complexities involved in potentially implementing this suggestion yet, but we\u2019ll provide you with an update once this investigation start.\r\n\r\nBest\r\n\u2028Jenny | Confluence Server Product Manager\r\n\r\n{panel}",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFCLOUD-7087].\n  {panel}\n\nPerhaps the biggest hurdle to adoption of Confluence is that its markup differs from MediaWiki, or from wiki-xyz.\r\n\r\nTo test the waters regarding switching from MediaWiki, I used the (unsupported, 3rd-party volunteer) converter, which is imperfect at best.  For a few dozen pages this took days. For various reasons, my organization decided to put off switching until later, if ever, when we will have even more content in MediaWiki at which time the process will be even harder.  We probably will never convert as a result.\r\n\r\nThe right architectural solution to this, I suggest, might be to store the pages as HTML and to provide plug-in converters to-from Confluence markup and MediaWiki markup. Import/export specifies which dialect to use, and each user specifies their preference for dialect.\r\n\r\nThis architecture would solve the conversion problem: you simply designate that the files being imported are marked up with MediaWiki formatting. And it would solve the user problem: users already fluent in MediaWiki markup need never switch to Confluence markup.",

We have been stung in the past with using this restore process failing (since appropriate changes to the database schema are not made when you restore direct to the DB instead of using Confluence).\r\n\r\nI propose a change to the backup process to use a streamed-out ZIP file, or at the least not requiring full load into RAM of the entire JVM recordset (instead of doing an eager load of the db, just load one record at a time ... )\r\n",

When creating a new page from a template that contains both variables and the dynamic tasklist, attempting to add a new task removes page content and switches to 'insert variables' mode. This does not occur when variables are not used.\r\n\r\nAlso, calling {dynamictasklist:one} from a template and viewing the preview shows 'Error formatting macro: dynamictasklist: java.lang.NullPointerException'\r\n\r\nCurrent workaround is to know not to create dynamic tasks until after the page has been created, but the tasklist should not render in template variable insertion mode unless it can be used from within that mode without erasing page content.\r\n\r\n",

This Mirror could be hostet in the intranet and the client could connect to it, to work like now.\r\n\r\nOr the client could be fed with a summary-list to check the local plugins whether they are up to date.

      "description": "Currently, PluginEvent subclasses only contain the human-readable name of the plugin. They should contain the plugin key instead, for two reasons:\r\n\r\n1) The plugin key is what is used to retrieve individual plugins in the PluginManager and are guaranteed to be unique.\r\n2) The name is intended to be human-readable and is not supposed to be used programatically. It's also not guaranteed to be unique.\r\n\r\nThe upshot of this is that when receiving plugin events, the only information you are given is basically useless. If it's a PluginInstallEvent or a PluginEnableEvent you can trawl through the whole list of installed plugins and check the name manually, but you are not guaranteed that the real source of the event was another plugin with the same name.\r\n\r\nHowever, if it's a PluginUninstallEvent or a PluginDisableEvent, you can't even do that, since the plugin no longer shows up in the list!\r\n\r\nThis is most annoying and renders the events practically useless. Please fix!\r\n",
