We cannot get user buy-in when the supporting documentation is \r\nseemingly half finished.\r\n______________\r\n\r\nAdditional information: I am really disappointed in the quality of the Team Calendars user documentation and find it exasperating to only ever find clear answers by trawling through other users comments to establish the full limits and limitations of Team Calendars.\r\n\r\nA couple of examples: \r\n\r\n1. The only way I ever found out that you could not change colours of events / have multiple different events split by colour was from other user experiences.. Sadly this is one of many similar situations I have faced and ultimately is seen as a blocker for expanding team calendar usage across my organisation. \r\n\r\n2. The inherent difficulty in working with calendars is well known however as a user who may be looking to purchase your product I would hope that there would be more information relating to Subscribing to and Exporting team calendars. Not every confluence user is a master of this and the existing information on the following pages is not enough. Nothing is ever mentioned about receiving notifications in Outlook for upcoming events or what happens if I change my event in Team Calendars (or Outlook) - is it auto updated in the other tool? Basically, simple functional information is missing or at least highly unclear.\r\n\r\nThe product is not your average plugin (content and price wise) but a lot more than that and it deserves the right level of accompanying user documentation",

Sometimes the founders meet, sometimes devs, sometimes marketing plus individual devs, etc.\r\nNow we don't want to create one dedicated calendar for each possible meeting composition, just in order to separate concerns.\r\n\r\nThus, as a user, I would much appreciate the ability to filter my calendar view and subscriptions (e.g. Google Calendar) to only include those events that I am attending (i.e. I am in the \"Who\" list).

I even found a reference to this feature in another improvement  https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/TEAMCAL-417 however, when I tied it out it did not work for me.\r\n\r\nWhat I want to do is using the \"Start Date\" and \"Release Date\" in jira for versions have that show up as a range bar in Team Calendars. Today only the Release Date shows up. \r\n\r\nI was told that this can be done via Agile which I tested and found it could do this. In addition to that I found that creating a custom issue type can do the same. However, I pefer and I think it is beneficial to users if there was only one place in JIRA to update a versions dates. In both the Agile and the issue type workaround a user would have to update the dates in more then one location. If this feature were implemented not only would users not \"have to\" buy Agile but it can be administered in one location in JIRA.\r\n\r\nIt seem fairly straight forward that the fields are in JIRA already and the functionality of Team Calendars is there but the option to put these together is lacking.",

If the release is coming up (the current date < release date) the wording stays the same as what it is today\r\n2. If the release date has passed and the version is not released, we keep the same wording\r\n3. If the date has passed AND the version is released - we change the wording to be the date by it'self. So \"Due 3 days ago\" changes to \"12 Aug, 2013\" \r\n\r\nWe already have knowledge if a version has been released or not because we show a different icon if it is released\r\n",

Team Calendars almost fits the bill but there are a couple of things missing:\r\n\r\n1.  If a team member is double booked in two calendars, there should be an alert about it either to change the schedule or ignore.\r\n2.  The ability to dynamically create calendar views based on previously created calendars.  For example:  if a team member has personal schedule which outlines his or her week and where they're going to be, then it would be great if an entire department schedule could be dynamically created from the various members who are going to be working in a particular department on a particular day.  Kind of like a \"view\" in a relational database.  As a non-profit organization in which the members wear many hats over the course of a week, this is a real challenge to schedule and thus far we haven't found any software which can do this, but Confluence by nature seems like it could do this very well if the time was put into it.",

I was wondering if it would be possible that after a calendar has been created a second .ics file could be imported to add additional events. \r\n\r\nWhat I'm thinking is that when you click on the drop down menu for a calendar there could be an option to add additional events from a .ics file.\r\n\r\nSince CalDAV is presenting alot of issues, being able to import additional .ics files to a calendar I feel would put out a lot of fires with customers. \r\n\r\nCurrently I am creating new calendars on a monthly basis to update one of our calendars (we do this to include all the webex & teleconference data). Any subscribers to the calendars then have to re-subscribe.\r\n\r\nI had come across a work around on one of the tickets to create a google calendar and be able to achieve this but since everything in our company is behind a firewall this is not an option.\r\n\r\nHaving this option would be a great alternative to having a fully synced calendar from outlook via the CalDAV protocol.\r\n\r\nThanks for the time and consideration,\r\n-Aaron",
