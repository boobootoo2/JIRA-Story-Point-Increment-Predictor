We could integrate our confluence install with our custom intranet scripts (parsing the output and giving a more accurate output). We could get it so that it could parse the xml files our applications provide for documentation so that the documentation could seamlessly be integrated into confluence. We could get our IT support space to probe / parse the bind config files and list the current IP assignments. We could display the NOCOL information for our network system / uptime so dumb users can still obtain useful information without getting confused.\n\nThis is possible to a limited extent through include files - but macros would be so much better and avoid the need of portal scripts running on webservers.",

However...\n\nIf you could have an optional \"display\" or \"alternate\" title, you would be able to take advatage of other aspects of the system more readily.\n\nThe main example I am thinking of is using Confluence for software documentation and taking advantage of it's hierarchy view for class structures, etc.\n\nThe ability to show an alternate title in the hierarchy view would make it far more friendly to end-users IMHO.  If no display/alternate title is given, default to page title on displays.\n\nWhen viewing the page itself, or linking to a page, then the normal page title would be displayed.",
