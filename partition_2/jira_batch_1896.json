[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFCLOUD-7913].\n  {panel}\n\nThe remote API presents opportunities for denial of service attack. For example: \r\n* RemoveSpace for a space with many pages can take several minutes, and all other users are locked from the wiki until it completes \r\n* Reading or writing pages too rapidly through the API can impact the responsiveness of the wiki for other users \r\n\r\nWe need to use the API for creation of new user accounts from a script that may run any time of day or night. But we don't want to open the API to all users. \r\n\r\nCan we quickly have a feature to limit API use to members of the group Confluence-API-Users \r\n\r\nFor backwards compatibility, there should be an administration option to \r\n* Allow all users to use API \r\n* Only Confluence-administrators to use API \r\n* Only confluence-api-users to use API \r\n\r\n{panel:title=Resolution as of 18 February 2016|borderStyle=solid|borderColor=#3C78B5| titleBGColor=#3C78B5| bgColor=#E7F4FA}\r\nThank you for your votes and comments on this issue, along with your ongoing patience. In order to bring closure on this request we have decided to resolve it as Won't Fix. This decision has been made for a number of reasons. Aside from competing priorities, the other reason is that the API is actually the same API end users use when they interact with the product. Rate/user/group limiting that would require a substantial re-architecture of the whole API and user interaction.\r\n\r\nI would recommend reviewing the following articles which provides information on how to detect users that may be contributing to API abuse:\r\n[Enable User Access Logging|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/CONFKB/How+to+Enable+User+Access+Logging]\r\n[Audit Confluence Using the Tomcat Valve Component|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/CONFKB/Audit+Confluence+Using+the+Tomcat+Valve+Component]\r\n\r\nA proxy server can also be used to restrict API calls to particular IP addresses. For Data Center, customers have reported success in directing all API traffic to a single node, such that any performance or stability impacts are limited to a single node. Depending on the API you are using, requests should go to the following URLs:\r\n<CONFLUENCE_URL>/rpc/xmlrpc\r\n<CONFLUENCE_URL>/rpc/soap-axis\r\n<CONFLUENCE_URL>/confluence/rest\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n  Adam Barnes\r\n  Confluence Product Management\r\n{panel}",

That doesn't seem unreasonable either.\r\n\r\nWhat I find confusing is the combination of these behaviours.  That is, the same user appears in the list once for LDAP and once for Hibernate, but clicking on either results in exactly the same screen, with the read only LDAP user.\r\n\r\nA particularly sneaky part of this, is that there is nothing in the list of users to show that the users come from different user repositories.\r\n\r\nI feel it would be better if:\r\n- The admin's list of users http://localhost:8080/admin/users/showallusers.action included a Repository column, like the group membership screen does.\r\n- The admin could view and edit the hibernate version of the user.",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFCLOUD-7841].\n  {panel}\n\nMany pages in my repository contain includes, excerpts, metadata, rss feeds, jira reports, remote-html includes, sql queries, charts, generated confluence content (children, pagetree, contentbylabels, search macro).  In fact, this is a power of confluence, to 'safely' assemble these varied data sources. Confluence is an excellent central point for the collecting, or confluence, of a variety of data sources required to make decisions. Kudos.\r\n\r\nHowever, the concept of notification for end users is clear: IF THIS PAGE THAT I AM VIEWING CHANGES, let me know. I don't want to miss anything.   Often the 'view' changes without the 'source' changing.\r\n\r\nFrom a content provider, or page 'steward', the use case is different. IF THIS PAGES SOURCE CHANGES, let me know.    This is important because a page developer might not need to do or check anything unless the source changes, they may not care about the view.  This is what you currently implement well.\r\n\r\n** You need both levels of watching for each page for these two communities of users. ***\r\n\r\nThe 'page view notification' would also help enourmously for 'unit testing' and assessing the impact of upgrading a macro on a large site where you can't review all the content.\r\n\r\nIN ADDITION: the 'view changes' button shows a 'diff' of the source, something that is obscure to many content readers, especailly for complex pages. Changes sometimes are not obvious (i.e. a small addition, {jiraissues} is added, but a huge section of the page appears or disappears).  End users would prefer to see highlighted what has visibly changed on a page.\r\n\r\nTHESE ARE NOT EASY CHALLENGES when you consider you need to have a stored view for each user, and different users will see different views on any given page, but if you can overcome them you will further differentiate your application in this very competitive application niche.  Even a partial solution that worked for most cases would be powerful.\r\n\r\n- space watch overcomes this somewhat for small spaces and internal data like pagetree or children, however:\r\n- this is more important that entire-space watches that are quickly unweildly, as a user wants to watch digested information suitable to their level of abstraction, not the entire repository.  So watching a TOP PAGE is more common, under the assumption that important changes will trickle up. (indeed that is how we build our sites, using includes and excerpts to trickle high-impact information upward or laterally).  The problem is the trickle is often automatic in the form of adding a label or moving a page to another branchin the heirarchy, rather than an actual change on the top page.\r\n",

We acknowledge that many of you are looking to bring your customers and other external users into your Confluence site and therefore want tighter control over which users can browse the people directory.\u00a0\r\n\r\nAt this stage we do not have a way to control who can browse the people directory. If it is crucial for you to completely hide the people directory from all users, we have\u00a0[instructions|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Hiding+the+People+Directory]\u00a0on how to disable this in your self-hosted instance. We do know that the people directory is extremely useful and that you still want to make it available for some users, like your internal employees.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe use cases stemming from external collaboration do touch quite a number of features in the product, starting from the people directory and ranging through mentions, shares, comments, user profiles and search. In order to provide both a functional and watertight solution it is important to consider these various use cases, their impact on various features and the related front end and API implementations.\r\n\r\n\u00a0This feature request does form part of a larger long term initiative from which we hope to provide a solution for this issue in the future. We will update the status of this issue once we have made further progress.\r\n\r\nSome of you have also shared concerns around data privacy and GDPR. We'd like to assure you that we\u2019re continuing to take these requirements seriously. For more information on our latest GDPR updates to Confluence, see our [6.13 release notes|https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/confluence-6-13-release-notes-959288785.html#Confluence6.13ReleaseNotes-SupportingyourGDPRefforts].\u00a0\r\n\r\nBest,\r\n Jenny - Confluence Product Manager\r\n{panel}",

\"com.adaptavist.confluence.builder.themes.spaceDefaults\";\r\n    private TreeMap spaceDefaults;\r\n\r\n    private void writeSpaceDefaults() {\r\n        bandanaManager.setValue( new ConfluenceBandanaContext(), SPACE_DEFAULTS, xStream.toXML(spaceDefaults) );\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public void setSpaceLayoutLock (String spacekey, boolean locked) throws BuilderException {\r\n        initData();\r\n        if (spacekey==null) {\r\n            spacekey = GLOBAL_SPACE;\r\n        }\r\n        SpaceDefault spaceDefault = (SpaceDefault) spaceDefaults.get(spacekey);\r\n        if (spaceDefault==null) {\r\n            spaceDefault = new SpaceDefault(DEFAULT_LAYOUT_ID,locked);\r\n        } else {\r\n            spaceDefault.setLocked(locked);\r\n        }\r\n        spaceDefaults.put(spacekey,spaceDefault);\r\n        writeSpaceDefaults();\r\n    }\r\n----------\r\n\r\n\r\nTo be honest .. this also happens with every other write I have ever attempted to make to bandana in 2.3 when called through DWR, however with the other writes the data was actually getting written away so I have left it as something that could be resolved later (when 2.3 is a bit more stable) ... however for this write the data is NOT getting written away, hence this is causing me major problems in my development work.",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFCLOUD-7824].\n  {panel}\n\n*Situation*\r\n- powerful collaborative features are used to edit content in Confluence, but the user macros themselves are unversioned and difficult to document or share.\r\n\r\n*Details*\r\n- User macros are important. Despite their quick nature, user macros are the 'glue' that sticks together many sites, quick-fixing plugin blunders, create shorthand recipies combining macros from multiple plugins and placing notices and replacing obsolete or missing macros. (we have over 200 of these, some very complex).\r\n- Authoring and maintaining user macros are collaborative. On even moderate sized installations there can be several system administrators that have access to the user macros. They are sometime authored by one person, broken during an upgrade (which needs to be noted), repaired by another, and new 'syntax' added by yet another person.\r\n- Unlike regular wiki pages, they are currently unversioned. This obviously means we can't revert mistakes, see who contributed what elements, or see their comments as to why they made that change\r\n- Unlike regular wiki pages, they can't have threaded comments. This is helpful for discussing transitions, strategy, dependencies, or details around a specific user macro. It would be good to have one set, shared between admins, and another set associated with the documentation described below.\r\n- Unlike regular wiki pages, they can't be 'watched'. This would help notify admins when certain macros are being updated, or notify interested users when the macro (or macro documentation below) was updated.\r\n- Unlike regular wiki pages, they can't be restricted to certain individuals. Not all site admins are equal. It would be good to restrict some of the higher profile user macros to specific users (not because of the access to the API, all admins are trusted with that, but because some user macros are used extensively and should not be updated arbitrarily)\r\n- Unlike regular wiki pages, they are not visible to the regular users. It's not the code or the comments that need to be visible, however, it's a 'documentation blurb' that includes parameters, usage examples and description of functionality.  These sections should also be version controlled, attributable, watchable and restrictable. In this case, however, we would like to extend the ability to edit these three blurbs, in wiki or rich text syntax, to regular users.\r\n- Unlike regular wiki pages, they cannot be linked to. It would be helpful, for example, to say \"Please see user macro \\[xxx\\]\" or \"user macro [usermacro:xxxx]\" and have that link to the help documentation for the named user macro.\r\n- Unlike regular wiki pages, there are no 'incoming-links'. It would be very helpful when refactoring user macros (due to a Confluence version upgrade, a plugin upgrade, or chance in functionality), to have some idea what the impact of that user macro was on our installation. To know how many, and which, pages use the macro would be great.\r\n- Unlike regular wiki pages, they cannot be labeled. This would be extremely useful for categorizing our 200 user macros into groups, which helps with documenting and with the learning curve for new users and admins. (labels might include which versions they've been tested on, are they content or formatting, are they obsolete, temporary, core to our installation, related to a specific plugin, etc)\r\n- Unlike regular wiki pages, they cannot be easily transfered between installations. It would be great to share them by letting regular users see the code (if desired). If that user is then an admin on their own install, the can quickly duplicate the functionality, improve the macro, and deliver it back to us tested.\r\n\r\n*Suggestion*\r\n- use some of the lessons learned from the regular wiki page user interface to enhance the editing and documenting of user macros\r\n\r\n(appologize to Charles below for me not being specific enough in my first request)",
