And, if you manually select the \"Template name\" value to the correct template name and save the page, it still works. \r\n\r\nFinally, this behavior is true for other templates besides \"Meeting notes\".\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Summary\r\n\r\nCopy and pasting image into pages while editing, or uploading images while editing does not work correctly with Internet Explorer.\r\n\r\nInternet Explorer imports the image file with the tag {{ac:thumbnail=\"true\"}}\u00a0causing the image to be blurry. This does not affect other web browsers when they are used to upload/paste images to pages as they will not include the {{ac:thumbnail=true\"}}\u00a0tag once saved.\u00a0\r\nh3. Environment\r\n * Internet Explorer 11\r\n* Microsoft Edge Version 81.0.416.68 (Official build) (64-bit)\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # In Windows use Snipping Tool\r\n # Create a new Image\r\n # Copy the image with the copy button\r\n # Ctrl+V to Confluence page, or upload a saved image to a page using the image upload feature\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nImage inserted in Internet Explorer should be sharp as appear in Chrome like below. \r\n !chrome.JPG|thumbnail!\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nImage show as blurry in Internet Explorer\r\n !IE.JPG|thumbnail!\r\nh3. Notes\r\n\r\nComparing the Storage Format of the page you will see:\r\n * Chrome\r\n{code:java}\r\n<p><ac:image ac:height=\"162\"><ri:attachment ri:filename=\"image2017-8-30_14-1-9.png\" /></ac:image></p>\r\n{code}\r\n\r\n * Internet Explorer\r\n{code:java}\r\n<p><ac:image ac:thumbnail=\"true\" ac:height=\"162\"><ri:attachment ri:filename=\"image2017-8-30_14-0-51.png\" /></ac:image></p>\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nOption 1: Use a different web browser other than IE to upload images to the page while editing\r\n Option 2: Resize the blurry image, then resize it back to the desired size and it will appear correctly once saved, as this removes the tag\r\nh3. Mass clean-up\r\n\r\nRun the following SQL statement to replace the {{ac:thumbnail=\"true\"}} value with a blank value in all pages and all previous versions of pages including drafts:\r\n{code:sql|title=works on Postgres}\r\nUPDATE BODYCONTENT\r\nSET body = replace(body,'ac:thumbnail=\"true\"','') \r\nWHERE body LIKE '%ac:thumbnail=\"true\"%';\r\n{code}\r\n{code:sql|title=works on MS SQL}\r\nUPDATE BODYCONTENT\r\n   SET BODY = REPLACE (CONVERT(VARCHAR(MAX), BODY), 'ac:thumbnail=\"true\"','')\r\n WHERE BODY LIKE '%ac:thumbnail=\"true\"%';\r\n{code}\r\n(!)\u00a0Always make a full backup of the database and be prepared to roll back before directly editing the db.\u00a0\r\n\r\nWhen done with the search and replace statement above, go to *General Configuration -> Cache Management -> \"Advanced View\"* and click *\"Flush All\"* at the very bottom of the page. This is so cached versions of pages which have this code still in their storage format will be reloaded from the database at next page visit.\r\n\r\nYou may need to clear browser cache as well or hold down shift+refresh on the page to load the page not from existing browser cache.\u00a0\r\n\r\n(i)\u00a0Note: using Internet Explorer to upload new images into pages moving forward will embed the {{ac:thumbnail=\"true\"}}\u00a0value again. This can be avoided by resizing the image to anything else while editing, then resizing back to the size you want before saving the page.\u00a0\u00a0",

      "description": "h3. Problem Definition\r\nConfluence provides a set of shortcut keys for specific actions. Those letters are underlined in their prospective button Test, for example (e) for +E+diting a page/blog.\r\nThis is not working well when using Confluence in different languages. The shortcut keys are still the same (which is expected.) However, the word is different and sometimes does not contain that letter that matches the shortcut key. Instead we underline the first letter of that word and this could be misleading and confusing for the users. Sometimes multiple words will have the same letter underlined because they start with the same letter.\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\nThe suggested solution is to remove the underline from those words for non English translations or allow the admins to configure this if needed.\r\n \r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\nThe current workaround illustrates how you can either completely remove the underline or change it to a letter(s) of your liking. Here's how you can do it:\r\n# Stop Confluence\r\n# Locate the following jar file {{<confluence-install>/confluence/WEB-INF/bundled-plugins/confluence-language-pack-xx_XX-y.y.y.some-alphanumeric-plus-some-date.jar}} where {{xx}} and {{XX}} are the language ISO codes and {{y.y.y}} is the latest Confluence release version that shipped these translations by default. For example:\r\n{code}\r\nconfluence-language-pack-de_DE-6.3.0.beta2-v2r13658-2017-06-19.jar\r\n{code}\r\n# Take a copy of this jar file\r\n# Unzip the jar file\r\n# For this example we will focus on the action when viewing a page: *Edit*, *Save for Later* and *Watch* for the German language\r\n# Lookup for the following values in the prospective files:\r\n*Edit* - {{com/atlassian/confluence/core/ConfluenceActionSupport_de_DE.properties}}\r\n{code}\r\nnavlink.edit={0}B{1}earbeiten\r\n{code}\r\n*Save for later* - {{com/atlassian/confluence/core/ConfluenceActionSupport_de_DE.properties}}\r\n{code}\r\npagemenu.favourite={0}F{1}avorit\r\npagemenu.unfavourite={0}F{1}avorit l\\u00F6schen\r\n{code}\r\n*Watch* - {{com/atlassian/confluence/plugins/watch/i18n_de_DE.properties}}\r\n{code}\r\nconfluence.watch.start.button={0}B{1}eobachten\r\nconfluence.watch.stop.button={0}B{1}eobachtung\r\n{code}\r\n# You can modify the underlined letter by surrounding it with \r\n{code}\r\n{0}A{1}bcdefgh\r\n{code}\r\n# You can also choose to not underline anything, then you can remove the surrounding \\{0\\} and \\{1\\}\r\n# Save the file\r\n# Update the jar file with the new saved files\r\n# [Clear Confluence plugin cache|https://confluence.atlassian.com/confkb/how-to-clear-confluence-plugins-cache-297664846.html]\r\n# Start Confluence\r\n\r\nThe new changes will now be visible to the users.",

The logs can roll in a matter of minutes.\r\n\r\nThe reason this is a problem is that it can cause the root cause of the node shutting down (e.g. the cluster panic event) to be rolled off the logs way before administrators have a chance to react/intervene to recover the node or manually pull the logs before rolling off. In other words, this flood of logging can hamper efforts for root cause analysis for large clients.\r\n\r\nIdeally, we can log this type of stacktrace *once* and minimize the verbosity future entries of a similar type instead of repeatedly logging the stacktrace.\r\n\r\nh2. Workaround\r\nThe current workaround is to extend the default logging so that more logs are kept in archive, in order to give administrators a greater window to capture the relevant logs. This can be done my modifying the following two parameters in <confluence_install>/confluence/WEB-INF/classes/log4j.properties, which influences size of log files and number of logs kept in archive, respectively:\r\n{code}\r\nlog4j.appender.confluencelog.MaxFileSize=20480KB\r\nlog4j.appender.confluencelog.MaxBackupIndex=5\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nNote however that increasing the logs kept will impact the disk footprint and size of Support Zips generated.",

These entries will look something like this:\r\n\r\n{code:xml}\r\n<object class=\"SchedulerClusteredJob\" package=\"com.atlassian.confluence.impl.schedule.caesium\">\r\n<id name=\"id\">########</id>\r\n<property name=\"jobId\"><![CDATA[com.atlassian.crowd.manager.directory.monitor.poller.DirectoryPollerManager.########]]></property>\r\n<property name=\"nextRunTime\">YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.SSS</property>\r\n<property name=\"version\">#####</property>\r\n<property name=\"jobRunnerKey\"><![CDATA[com.atlassian.crowd.manager.directory.monitor.poller.DirectoryPollerManager]]></property>\r\n<property name=\"rawParameters\"><![CDATA[XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX]]></property>\r\n<property name=\"schedType\">I</property>\r\n<property name=\"cronExpression\"/><property name=\"cronTimeZone\"/><property name=\"intervalFirstRunTime\">YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.SSS</property>\r\n<property name=\"intervalMillis\">300000</property>\r\n</object>\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nStep-by-step:\r\n\r\n# Unzip the backup zip into a temporary location\r\n# Open the entities.xml file and remove the entry that looks like above\r\n# Zip all files back into a new backup.zip\r\n# Re-attempt the import using the new backup.zip\r\n\r\nIf you don't want to manually edit the backup file, then you can try the below workarounds instead:\r\n\r\nIf the Job ID on the error message is *com.atlassian.crowd.manager.directory.monitor.poller.DirectoryPollerManager*:\r\n\r\n# Restart Confluence and attempt to import the space \r\n# If that does not help, disable the LDAP while importing is in progress, or delete the exact entry directly from the scheduler_clustered_jobs table also while the import is in progress\r\n(!) Notice that you need to be logged in as an internal system administrator account to follow the second option\r\n\r\nIf the Job ID on the error message is *TaskQueueFlushJob*:\r\n\r\n# Restart Confluence and attempt to import the space \r\n# If that does not help, disable the scheduled job Task Queue Flush Job at *General Configuration > Scheduled Jobs* while you import the space\r\n\r\nMore details on the following KB:\r\n\r\n* https://confluence.atlassian.com/confkb/confluence-space-xml-import-procedure-fails-with-timeout-884357177.html",

You can create Blank Pages, Blog Posts, Questions, Calendars and a lot of different templates. There's no template to create a Page Tree though.\r\n\r\nh3. Expectation\r\nTo have a template which would create a Page Tree based on the user input.\r\n\r\nh3. Example\r\nLet's assume that we have below hierarchy of pages to be created:\r\n{panel}\r\nRoot\r\n1 - Alfa\r\n1.1 - Beta\r\n1.2 - Gama\r\n1.2.1 - Delta\r\n2 - Epsilon\r\n2.1 - Zeta\r\n3 - Eta\r\n3.1 - Theta\r\n3.1.1 - Lambda\r\n3.1.2 - Pi\r\n3.2 - Sigma\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\nh4. Current Behaviour\r\nWe would need to create page by page, manually. Also, we would need to pay attention to the hierarchy when creating pages in order to create child pages under their parent pages to achieve our needs. It works, but represents lots of manual work depending on the user need.\r\n\r\nh4. Expected Behaviour\r\nTo insert a tree structure like the one above in a Macro and chill-out while Confluence does all the work.\r\n\r\nh3.

      "description": "Once we create a page using \"DACI decision\" blueprint, it is created a parent page named \"DACI register\". This register page appears to be fine, but it's impossible to edit anything from \"Outstanding decisions\" and below.\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n# Create a page using \"DACI decision\" blueprint;\r\n# Edit its parent page \"DACI register\";\r\n# In edit mode, click anywhere below \"Outstanding decisions\";\r\n\r\nh3. Expected results\r\n\r\nThe content can be edited with no problems.\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Actual results\r\n\r\nDepending on the browser and on where exactly you click:\r\n- Nothing happens;\r\n- The whole page content becomes select;\r\n- The properties report macros disappear;\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nThis issue happens because those last sections aren't actually inside a section frame - we can see they are not inside any dashed line, unlike the rest of the content.\r\n\r\nWe can manually fix individual pages using [Confluence Source Editor|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.atlassian.confluence.plugins.editor.confluence-source-editor/server/overview]. All we need to do is put the correct section tags around the outcast content.

      "description": "h4. Issue Summary\r\n\r\nConfluence does not render static HTML Files.\r\nh4. Steps to Replicate\r\n # Open a text editor.\r\n # Inside it, paste a very simple HTML Code, might even be a \"Hello World\".\r\n{code:java}\r\n<html>\r\n<header><title>This is title</title></header>\r\n<body>\r\nHello world\r\n</body>\r\n</html>\r\n{code}\r\n\r\n # You might use the name you want, however, save it with the following name for testing purposes: {{AtlassianTest.html}}\r\n # According to your documentation on How to make Confluence Serve Static HTML Content, place {{AtlassianTest.html}} inside {{<Confluence-Install-Directory>/confluence}} directory.\r\n # Open your Confluence in the Web Browser and try to access the file through the following path: {{<YOURBASEURL>/AtlassianTest.html}}, as described in the documentation.\r\n\r\n*Expectation:*\r\n \"Hello World\" appears in your browser.\r\n\r\n*Reality:*\r\n Confluence displays a blank page.\r\nh4. Suggested Root Cause\r\n\r\nAs observed through the Browser Developer Tools, it seems like Confluence is attempting to add Headers and Footers to static file. Here's how a \"Blank Page\" looks like in the background:\r\n{code:java}\r\n<!DOCTYPE html>\r\n<html>\r\n<head>\r\n<title>FLD\r\n{code}\r\nAs you can see, it looks like the {{<!DOCTYPE html>}} is added and all the other tags are loosing parts of them. The actual background should look like this:\r\n{code:java}\r\n<html>\r\n<header><title>This is title</title></header>\r\n<body>\r\nHello world\r\n</body>\r\n</html>\r\n{code}\r\nI wasn't able to proper drill down why the {{plugins}} folder doesn't get content applied to it, but I do believe that this is related to the mappings inside the application Tomcat {{web.xml}} file.\r\nh4. Intention of this Bug\r\n\r\nEither to have an explanation on the need of adding customised headers and footers automatically to the static files and explain why the {{plugins}} folder doesn't get applied to this or to stop adding headers and footers to all the files.\r\nh4. Observations\r\n\r\nWe understand that this is customisation, however, we do have a documentation at Atlassian showing how to do this under [How to Use Confluence to Render Static HTML|https://confluence.atlassian.com/confkb/how-to-use-confluence-to-serve-static-content-677282407.html], which is not useful, since the solution created on it doesn't work. Based on the [Support Offerings|https://confluence.atlassian.com/support/atlassian-support-offerings-193299636.html], we need to have that page up to date, however, before doing that, we would like to understand why things are working as they currently are.\r\nh4. Workaround\r\n*Plugin Folder:*\r\nInside {{<Confluence-Install-Directory>/confluence}}, create a folder called {{plugins}}. Browse to {{<Confluence-Install-Directory>/confluence/plugins}} and drop the {{AtlassianTest.html}} inside it. Try to access the file through the following path: {{<YOURBASEURL>/plugins/AtlassianTest.html}} and it will render your content just fine.\r\n\r\n*HTML Injection:*\r\nParallel to that, you may inject the following HTML to your code, inside the header part:\r\n{code}\r\n<meta name=\"decorator\" content=\"none\"/>\r\n{code}\r\nIn the end, your code should look like this:\r\n{code}\r\n<html>\r\n<header>\r\n\t<meta name=\"decorator\" content=\"none\"/>\r\n\t<title>This is title</title>\r\n</header>\r\n<body>\r\nHello world\r\n</body>\r\n</html>\r\n{code}\r\nWith this, you can place your custom inside {{<Confluence-Install-Directory>/confluence}} directory and it should render fine.",

Problem Definition\r\nWhen we add a JIRA Issue Macro in a Confluence page, Confluence displays default columns from JIRA irrespective of the columns that were selected in JIRA when viewing the JQL.\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\nSuppose if we filter issues in JIRA and select the desired columns to be displayed using the Columns button. When the JIRA filter URL is used in the Confluence page using JIRA Issue Macro, it includes the selected columns.\r\n\r\nh3. Why this is important\r\nThis will provide a more robust way when sharing JQL and simplify inserting JQL tables into a Confluence page.\r\n \r\nh3. Workaround \r\nInstall the [Confluence Source Editor|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.atlassian.confluence.plugins.editor.confluence-source-editor/server/overview], which allows quick editing of the XML that generates the macro.\r\n\r\nEditing the {{<ac:parameter ac:name=\"columns\">}} line directly can be quicker than the current user interface.\r\n{code:xml}\r\n <ac:structured-macro ac:macro-id=\"9ed09b85-ef84-4ec8-9a34-b3f39ab0e11b\" ac:name=\"jira\" ac:schema-version=\"1\">\r\n    <ac:parameter ac:name=\"server\">Your Company JIRA</ac:parameter>\r\n    <ac:parameter ac:name=\"columns\">key,summary,type</ac:parameter>\r\n    <ac:parameter ac:name=\"maximumIssues\">20</ac:parameter>\r\n    <ac:parameter ac:name=\"jqlQuery\">assignee = currentUser() AND resolution = Unresolved order by updated DESC </ac:parameter>\r\n    <ac:parameter ac:name=\"serverId\">02898d7b-114e-357c-9c67-1a61b19662a7</ac:parameter>\r\n  </ac:structured-macro>\r\n{code}",

Enable the Theme Add-On (Manage Add-Ons)\r\n\r\nExpected result: Global theme = Custom Theme Actual result: Global theme = Default Confluence Theme We haven't seen this behaviour in earlier versions of confluence.\r\n\r\nThis is quite a serious bug as lots of our customers use custom themes and the theme is set to the default theme, when for example the \r\nconfluence admin updates the UPM (as a result of updating the UPM all \r\nadd-ons are disabled and re-enabled). Users don't see the connection between updating the UPM and \"loosing\" the global theme.\r\n\r\nCheers\r\nStefi",
