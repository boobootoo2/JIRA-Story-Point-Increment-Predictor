[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFCLOUD-22733].\n  {panel}\n\nThe jiraissues macro currently blindly accepts the xml query specified via the \"url\" parameter to the macro.  This results in the fetching of all fields of the issue *and* all of the comments even though the vast majority of this information will be thrown away by Confluence when the macro is rendered.  This is extremely inefficient and results in very long page loading times when more than a handful of issues are displayed or if some fields have large quantities of information.\r\n\r\nThe workaround is to specify \"field=\" parameters for only the necessary fields that the macro will display as defined by the \"columns\" parameter of the macro.  Unfortunately this is not straightforward because the \"columns\" parameter of the macro uses actual column names but the \"field=\" parameters to the xml search URL uses database column names.  Also, the use must manually add \"field=link\" in order for the issue to be clickable.\r\n\r\nAll of this should be automatic and the fields fetched from JIRA by Confluence should be limited to only the fields specified via the \"columns\" parameter of the jiraissues macro.",

Problem \r\nFor large instances of Confluence, the suggest labels functionality can take a long time (5+ minutes) to return results, causing heavy load to the database in that duration. To clarify, this is the functionality that displays potential results when the user starts typing into the labels box.\r\n\r\nThe two actions (especially the second) that seem to cause this are:\r\n* /json/suggestlabelsactivity.action\r\n* /labels/autocompletelabel.action\r\n\r\nh3. Offending Query\r\nThis seems to be the offending query causing the load on the DB:\r\n{code:sql}\r\nselect * from ( select label3_.LABELID as LABELID, label3_.NAME\r\nas NAME, label3_.OWNER as OWNER, label3_.NAMESPACE as NAMESPACE,\r\n label3_.CREATIONDATE as CREATION5_, label3_.LASTMODDATE as LASTMODD6_, label3_.LABELID as x0_0_, count(label3_.LABELID) as x1_0_ \r\n from CONTENT_LABEL labelling0_, CONTENT spaceconte1_, SPACES space2_, LABEL label3_, CONTENT contentent4_ where spaceconte1_.CONTENTTYPE in \r\n ('com.atlassian.confluence.pages.AbstractPage', 'USERSTATUS', 'PAGE', 'BLOGPOST', 'MAIL', 'SPACEDESCRIPTION', \r\n 'com.atlassian.confluence.core.SpaceContentEntityObject') and labelling0_.LABELID=label3_.LABELID and ((label3_.NAMESPACE=:1  \r\n and labelling0_.LABELID=label3_.LABELID)and(labelling0_.CONTENTID=spaceconte1_.CONTENTID )and(spaceconte1_.SPACEID=space2_.SPACEID )\r\n and(lower(space2_.SPACEKEY)=:2 )and(contentent4_.CONTENT_STATUS!='deleted'  and labelling0_.CONTENTID=contentent4_.CONTENTID)) \r\n group by  label3_.LABELID , label3_.NAMESPACE , label3_.OWNER , label3_.NAME , label3_.LASTMODDATE , label3_.CREATIONDATE \r\n order by count(label3_.LABELID)DESC ) where rownum <= :3\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\nThe autosuggest/autocomplete label feature can be disabled:\r\n# Backup {{confluence-install/confluence/includes/js/labels-min.js}}\r\n# Modify {{confluence-install/confluence/includes/js/labels-min.js}} - look for {{bindAutocomplete:g}} or {{,bindAutocomplete:e}} on the very last line. Comment it out, including one of the surrounding commas:\r\n{code}\r\n{return m(d(r,q,s))}/*,bindAutocomplete:g*/,isNewPage:j,routes:n,setLabelError:o,parseLabelStringToArray:c}\r\n{code}\r\n# Go to Confluence Admin >> Plugins >> Locate \"Advanced Macros\" plugin (you might need to expand the \"System Plugins\"), and disable it\r\n# Once it's disabled, re-enable it again. This is to force expiry of the javascript cache to pick up the change.\r\n# NB: If you make a syntax mistake when editing this file, the file will not be picked up at all and you may lose functionality eg the Create button, the Admin panel and Notifications and Tasks. Simply revert your change to the JS file, go to {{<your-url>/admin/viewplugins.action}}, disable and re-enable Advanced Macros again to expire the cache.",

This may be something that is configured at the admin level or in the macro level -- I'd prefer it to be a global admin requirement.  Having externally linked content is a security risk, and for that Atlassian should be commended for the Whitelist function.  But the risk remains that malicious content could be brought in through a whitelisted feed. \r\n\r\nThere are plenty of projects that are dedicated to aggregation, modification, and security sanitization of RSS content.  http://simplepie.org/ is an example of the various projects that do this.  The existing tools sanitize the RSS feeds by stripping out entire tags which are insecure as well as individual attributes of otherwise secure tags which may be insecure.

It is an old and typical problem which we have when we try to type in our language (Farsi) using English words between them...so the order of words mismatches. However there is a very simple solution: To insert a unicode character at the beginning of the text field. Simply, this unicode says, the text which I'm gonna insert should be considered as a Right-to-Left text.\r\n\r\nOne way which I think might be useful is, to write a Javascript (it has been written already) and load it at the all pages of JIRA.\r\nBasically, this JS works either by pressing two keys (e.g Ctrl+Alt) or by clicking on a link. My question is:\r\n\r\nHow can I use this JavaScrpit especially when I want to write the name of the Issue? (Task name field)\r\n\r\nI'm just showing how the JS file can be used in an HTML file as follow:\r\n\r\n~~~<html> \r\n~~~ <head></head> \r\n~~~ <body> \r\n~~~  <p>Try typing in the following textbox. CTRL+ALT changes language \r\n~~~  and SHIFT+SPACE inserts a Zero-Width-Non-Joiner character:</p> \r\n~~~ \r\n~~~  <script language=\"javascript\" src=\"isiri2901.js\"></script> \r\n~~~  <center> \r\n~~~  <a href=\"javascript:setPersian(document.getElementById('testtextarea'))\">Persian</a> / \r\n~~~  <a href=\"javascript:setEnglish(document.getElementById('testtextarea'))\">English</a> \r\n~~~  <form dir=\"rtl\" lang=\"fa\"> \r\n~~~   <textarea id=\"testtextarea\" name=\"testtextarea\" cols=\"40\" rows=\"15\"\r\n~~~    onkeydown=\"return PersianKeyDown(event)\"\r\n~~~    onkeypress=\"return PersianKeyPress(event)\"></textarea> \r\n~~~  </form> \r\n~~~  </center> \r\n~~~  \r\n~~~ </body> \r\n~~~</html> ",

But the group and world execute bits are missing, which causes one extra manual step at install/upgrade time in tightened setups where the confluence user does not own the scripts in bin (there's no need for the user to own them). The JIRA tarballs do not have this problem, they do have the needed executable bits for user, group, and world. The fix for the confluence tarball should be simple:\r\n\r\n{{find bin -type f -perm +111 -print0 | xargs -0 chmod +x}}\r\n\r\nIn other words, scripts that need executable permissions should have them {{rwxr-xr-x}} straight out of the tarball instead of the current {{rwxr--r--}} .\r\n\r\nRelated earlier reports and discussion: CONF-6367, JRA-12967, http://forums.atlassian.com/message.jspa?messageID=257241034{quote}",

But it makes sense to extend the request to include links to all menu options from the Add, Tools, Browse, and user menus.\r\n\r\nThe reason for the request is that it is often difficult to train users (my org. has thousands) to use the Menu options, and we have standard pages that often require the same function to be\r\nperformed by many different users, e.g. printing a project brief document in Word. It would be great to simply put a link on the page that users can click to perform the desired function (see attached screenshot of a mockup).\r\n\r\nI realise this is quite a big ask and maybe it's not something that's high on the product roadmap but I'd like to report it anyway. I also realise that the [link-to macro|https://www.adaptavist.com/display/AtlassianConfluence/link-to+macro] by Adaptavist provides linkability to some of the menu options already, but it's only a few.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for considering this request :)",

The reindex is multithreaded to make it faster, however this sometimes leads to problems of starving requests of CPU and RAM.  See CONF-19674 and [http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/CONFKB/Confluence+Rebuild+Indexing+task+fails+to+complete].\r\n\r\nThe default is currently 1.5 * the number of cores available, which seems like it is still too many on a busy instance, so I think it should default to a lower number.\r\n\r\nMore importantly, while Confluence could try to make better guesses about how many threads should be used for a given index, it's very likely that the best guess will be made by the System Administrator triggering the re-index.  In particular they will have a good idea of whether they're running the re-index at a time when minimal external load is expected and they want it to be as fast as possible, or whether they're running it during serious load and they don't care how long it takes.\r\n\r\nOne option is to give them a choice between \"fast\" and \"low-impact\", but I suspect that abstraction will be unhelpful and unnecessary for the target-user.",

They just skip over it directly to \"Log In\".
