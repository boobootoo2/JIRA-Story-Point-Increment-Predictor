I've also received requests to perform reviews that I've been unable to perform since they're not yet started.\n\nI'm not sure how to solve this problem.  I think it has already been mitigated recently because it seems to happen less.\nMaybe a \"You are leaving an unstarted review, do you really want to do that?\" message?  Maybe making the start review button more visible? Maybe daily emails to people who have created reviews but haven't Started them.  Perhaps, now that there is a review creation dialog, it could be required that the reviews be finished before the dialog is closed, and the \"unstarted\" state could be removed.",

      "description": "We all know that Crucible is very capable of spamming you with thousands of emails whenever someone starts commenting on a review.  One mitigation to the problem is to filter Crucible notifications into a folder, so that they don't clutter your inbox.  However, that requires accurately identifying that an email is from Crucible.  The two candidate fields for filtering this sort of mail are usually subject and from email address.  In Crucible, you can't use subject because it looks like this:  [ABC-123] Comment: issue title.  That could be anything, including a JIRA notification.  You can't use the from email address, because Crucible sets the from email address to be the email address of the person that made the comment.\r\n\r\nThere is one way to accurately identify, that is to filter by X-Mailer, because crucible sets that field to \"Cenqua-Crucible\", however, it doesn't uniquely identify a Crucible instance, and not all email clients, most notably GMail, support filtering by arbitrary headers.\r\n\r\nMy suggestion is that seeing as the user that commented didn't actually send the email, rather Crucible did, the sender should not be set to that users email address, but should rather be a configured email address.  This will allow unique and accurate identification of Crucible instances by email filters.  If Crucible wants replies to go to the user that caused the email to be sent, then the users email address should be set in the Reply-To field, not the From field, because like I said, that's wrong, they didn't send the email.",
