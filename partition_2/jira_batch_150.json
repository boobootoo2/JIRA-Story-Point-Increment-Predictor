      "description": "To upgrade to Jira 5, I need to configure our custom authenticator by using Seraph via the already implemented SOAP web service. In the Seraph authenticator (named SeraphAuthenticate class), I also override the abstract method, getUser() and authenticate() extending from com.atlassian.seraph.auth.DefaultAuthenticator class in Seraph. \r\n\r\nThen I compile this as a Atlassian plugin using the command atlas-compile which in turn create a .jar file. I am not sure whether we are extending this DefaultAuthenticator correctly, you can request to have a look at the code if you want. I have then follow the instructions from http://docs.atlassian.com/atlassian-seraph/latest/configuration.html, which is configuring the seraph-config.xml and web.xml. I am not able to get any authentication while I try to login. \r\n\r\nFor info, I have tried on SeraphAuthenticate by giving some parameter, username and password and it is able to authenticate via SOAP and return true or false value. But it seems everything is lost when I could not get any authentication by using this class. Can you provide me more information to configure authentication using Seraph other than override the DefaultAuthenticator class? I am in no where now, and would like you to enlighten me with some idea so that I can proceed with this authentication.\r\n\r\nThanks.",

JAC was recently found to have 70MB of HttpSession objects in it (Bots where the main problem but still).\r\n\r\nI propose that we change Seraph so that it no longer creates a session when it detects that the auth mechanism is BASIC AUTH\r\n\r\nThis would save on sessions for \"Out Of Browser\" REST calls such as curl et al..\r\n\r\nSo why is there a session really?\r\nSeraph uses DefaultAuthenticator.LOGGED_IN_KEY in the session to know that a user has logged in on future requests.  This is really there for the browser experience.  Eg one login and then sessions of interaction.\r\n\r\nReally old bits of JIRA code used to look for req.getSession().getAttribute(DefaultAuthenticator.LOGGED_IN_KEY) to get the current user instead of using the other Seraph AuthContext.getUser() mechanism.\r\n\r\nThese have been removed fro all intents and purposes in 4.4.4 I think.  (Its complicated but its never read only set...kinda...sorta...trust me)\r\n\r\nIf no session was created on BASIC AUTH calls then nothing in JIRA would break,  I also doubt whether any other apps are using LOGGED_IN_KEY to get the current user in code.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this page is to find out of any other Seraph users reply on DefaultAuthenticator.LOGGED_IN_KEY being in a session DURING a BASIC AUTH call?\r\n\r\nWhen to do this?\r\nIn the next major version of Seraph to get out in the version of the products choosing",

(Is that even a word :)\r\n\r\nThe SecurityFilter use this exact object to set the AuthenticationContext threadlocal and also much of JIRA code does nasty things like this\r\n\r\nUser remoteUser = (User) httpSession.getAttribute(DefaultAuthenticator.LOGGED_IN_KEY);\r\n\r\nHowever if we change the users attributes say the email address or fullname, then this will never be reflected in the app until the user logs out.\r\n\r\nWe could in our user update code tweak the session and authcontext however imagine the case where an admin changes the user full name.  We cant get that users session to tweak.\r\n\r\nIn JIRAs case part of the app will show the updated name (the issue navigator reads from the user manager) and parts wont (that use the auth context and or session). \r\n\r\nMark L made the point that code should not assume that the session key is any other than a Principal but I think that horse has bolted, probably in and around 2004.\r\n\r\nDoes Confluence suffer from this problem on user update??

      "description": "There is an illegal cyclic dependency between LoginFilter and SecurityFilter which prevents seraph from filtering requests in containers that load filters lazily (e.g. GlassFish v3). \r\n\r\nThe filter chain in a typical seraph application looks like this:\r\n\r\n{code}\r\n...\r\nLoginFilter\r\n...\r\nSecurityFilter\r\n...\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nThe issue with this ordering is that, the LoginFilter's doFilter method depends on availability of the SecurityConfig in the ServletContext and this object is put into the context by SecurityFilter's init method. This means that unless SecurityFilter.init method is called, LoginFilter.doFilter will throw NPE.\r\n\r\nIf one tried to reorder the filter mapping so that the filter chain would look like this:\r\n{code}\r\n...\r\nSecurityFilter\r\nLoginFilter\r\n...\r\n...\r\n{code}\r\n\r\na new exception is thrown because SecurityFilter.doFilter depends on LoginFilter.doFilter.\r\n\r\nNow one might argue that this is not a problem with containers that eagerly load and initialize filters (e.g. Tomcat or GlassFish v2), but looking at the Servlet 2.5 spec, seraphs relies on an implementation detail of these containers rather than on the spec. The spec doesn't require containers to initialize all filters before any requests are served:\r\n\r\n{quote}\r\nSRV.6.2.1 Filter Lifecycle \r\n\r\nAfter deployment of the Web application, and before a request causes the container \r\nto access a Web resource, the container must locate the list of filters that must be \r\napplied to the Web resource as described below. The container must ensure that it \r\nhas instantiated a filter of the appropriate class for each filter in the list, and called its \r\ninit(FilterConfig config) method.\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nSince the lifecycle of filters and servlets is very similar in nature, we can also look at the specification for servlet lifecycle which explicitely mentions the option to load servlets lazily:\r\n\r\n{quote}\r\nSRV.2.3.1 Loading and Instantiation \r\nThe servlet container is responsible for loading and instantiating servlets. The load- \r\ning and instantiation can occur when the container is started, or delayed until the \r\ncontainer determines the servlet is needed to service a request.\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nTherefore it is by belief that seraph's implementation is incompatible with the servlet spec and should be corrected.\r\n\r\nIdeally the SecurityConfig should be initialized and placed into the servlet context via a context listener. That would guarantee the proper initialization of seraph.\r\n\r\nAn alternative hack to get things going until the issue is properly fixed is to patch the LoginFilter as follows:\r\n{code}\r\ndiff -r 9b55785d0f45 -r 47d893cb5d51 atlassian-seraph/src/main/java/com/atlassian/seraph/filter/BaseLoginFilter.java\r\n--- a/atlassian-seraph/src/main/java/com/atlassian/seraph/filter/BaseLoginFilter.java   Sat Dec 19 00:51:19 2009 -0800\r\n+++ b/atlassian-seraph/src/main/java/com/atlassian/seraph/filter/BaseLoginFilter.java   Sat Dec 19 19:38:03 2009 -0800\r\n@@ -60,6 +60,9 @@\r\n     {\r\n         // log.debug(\"LoginFilter.init\");\r\n         this.filterConfig = config;\r\n+\r\n+        //hack\r\n+        config.getServletContext().setAttribute(SecurityConfig.STORAGE_KEY, SecurityConfigFactory.getInstance(null));\r\n     }\r\n\r\n     public void destroy()\r\n{code}",
