So we need some sort of pop up warning message when setting this value, something like:\r\n\r\n{quote}\r\nPlease note that the Server Base URL must be the same as the url used to access confluence, otherwise it can cause many issues.

Atlassian Status \r\n\r\nAll,\r\n\r\nWe have discussed the use of \"HTTPS for login only\" in a lot of detail. After looking at the various options, we have concluded that we will not be supporting this configuration in Confluence.\r\n\r\nAlthough this configuration used to work in the past, in Confluence 3.0.2 we implemented a security improvement that helped prevent session fixation attacks (CONF-15108). The implications of this security feature meant that customers could no longer use HTTPS for login only. We did look at enabling this configuration again and concluded that we won't be doing so. There are several reasons for this. Many of these reasons have already been discussed in this post and the related issue ([CONF-4116|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONF-4116]).\r\n\r\nThe main customer feedback we have received on this issue primarily revolves around the use case of customers who wish to protect their LDAP credentials, but aren't as concerned about session hijacking.  Unfortunately, this is a *misconception* of the security provided by using HTTPS for login only.  If the \"remember me\" functionality is used - it is possible that anyone can intercept network traffic (after login) and can decrypt the users credentials. This is due to the way that the \"remember me\" functionality works.\r\n\r\nIt is due to this and all the [additional reasons |http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONF-4116?focusedCommentId=102037&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#action_102037] around the support of HTTPS for login only that we will not be implementing this feature.\r\n\r\nWe will continue work with you in making sure that the configuration you have setup is as secure as possible. Please don't hesitate to contact our [support team|http://support.atlassian.com] for assistance in this matter.\r\n\r\nSherif\r\nConfluence Product Manager ",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFCLOUD-18089].\n  {panel}\n\nI don't know how Confluence handles web requests under the covers, but some of our users have asked whether this feature exists in Confluence (we just moved from Trac).  I have since found that it doesn't.  In Trac, if you have a page hierarchy like so:\r\n\r\n* Page1\r\n** Page1Child\r\n* Page2\r\n** Page2Child\r\n*** Page2ChildsChild\r\n\r\nYou could access Page 2 Child's Child like http://trac/Page2/Page2Child/Page2ChildsChild and Page 1's Child like http://trac/Page1/Page1Child and so on and so forth.  This is very user friendly because the URL actually means something to them.\r\n\r\nHowever, in Confluence the page hierarchy as far as URLs is completely flat.  The major reason we want this is because we have multiple projects per space to cut down on the sheer number of spaces we would need.  For example, if we have test reports we'd like to be able to have multiple pages called 'Introduction' in the same space, as long as there wasn't already a page with that name under that *level* of the hierarchy (i.e. the same parent).  Having to name my page 'Project 1.4.6 Test Report Introduction' is a bit extreme, not to mention ugly when you export the page hierarchy to PDF for external consumption, as the table of contents is derived from the page titles.\r\n\r\nNow that I think about it, this may be two feature requests...\r\n\r\n# The ability to access a page using its hierarchy in the URL and\r\n# The ability to have multiple pages of the same title in the same space, enforced by parentid.",

The problem is that in Russian keyboard layout numero sign is bound to the same key as number sign in English keyboard layout (Shift+3). To create numbered lists in texts in Russian I need to switch keyboard layout to English and back for every line of bulleted list, which is very annoying. People here almost ignore numbered lists in Confluence because of this issue. There is no such issue with bullet lists, because asterisk is available in both keyboard layouts.\r\n\r\nIt would be great to allow both numero '\u2116' and number '#' signs to designate line in a numbered list.",
