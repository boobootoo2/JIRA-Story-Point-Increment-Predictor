But the immediate next day few of the users complained source tree software is unavailable which sounds weird. When I tried to check via screen share I appears the same to time. Even, I didn't see Source tree.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nI would like to what is the root cause of this issue? And if this is happening only with specific version? And also please help me in resolving this issue.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nSrikanth",

In prior version this edit box was reliable and never lost unless closing the SourceTree application (which is fine). What happens now it that the content of this edit box sometimes gets reset to an earlier version of the text.\r\n\r\nPossible hints as to what triggers it:\r\n * I think it tends to happen while I manipulate other elements of SourceTree. As the last major update of SourceTree (was it 2.0+?) changed the layout and made the File Status View section and the Log View mutually exclusive, I now often click back and forth to browse old commits for references while redacting my commit message.\r\n * I often use the \"Amend to latest commit\" option and as this option affects the edit box, it is possibly related.\r\n\r\nI don't have a specific deterministic repro yet, I will try to make one and post it when I have one. *I wanted to post this early as from the user's point of view it has been\u00a0_extremely_ frustrating as it essentially amounts to losing information.* Imagine typing a carefully thought out commit message and losing it.... For this reason I used a Symptom Severity of \"Major\", but I'm not sure what your preferred classification here.\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\nOmar",

Is it possible to keep the key loaded for that session of Git Bash?\r\n\r\nPS: I've been able to associate Sourcetree's ssh-agent with a Git Bash session, and keeping the key loaded, but only if the Git Bash window wasn't started from the Terminal button in Sourcetree.
