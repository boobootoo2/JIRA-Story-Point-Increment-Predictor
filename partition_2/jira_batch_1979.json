Workaround\r\n\r\nAs a workaround to get the correct views for specific pages:\r\n\r\n* Use the *Analytics* option from the sidebar of the space, which will give the *Space analytics* menu and then, select the *Pages* option.\r\n* On the *Page analytics*, hover the cursor over the graphic after updating the date range.

      "description": "h3. Issue Summary\r\n\r\nMarketplace Partner reported issue on the Developer Community https://community.developer.atlassian.com/t/copy-single-page-api-with-custom-body-does-not-work-anymore/43714\r\n\r\nWe are experiencing a major problem with the Copy single page API. One of the core features of our app (Scroll Documents) is to create copies of pages (or rather page trees) where include macros are resolved, so the macros are replaced by the actual content of the included page, and any attachments referenced by the included page are copied over.\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nImagine you have a Page A and a Page B. Page A contains an include macro that includes page B. Now you want to create a copy of Page A (called Page A*) where the include macro is resolved. The way our app does this is:\r\n # Fetch Page A, parse the storage format and look for include macros\r\n # Discover the include macro pointing to Page B, so fetch Page B and replace the macro with the body of page B in the parsed body of Page A\r\n # Now copy Page A to Page A* by using the Copy single page API (using a {{parent_page}} destination). Specify the parsed body of Page A with the replaced include macro as a custom {{body}} during the copy operation.\r\n # Look at the body of Page B and see if it references any attachments attached to itself. If it does, use the Copy single page API with an {{existing_page}} target to copy Page B to Page A*, with {{copyAttachments: true}} and specifying the body of Page A* as a custom {{body}} for the copy operation. This will copy all attachments of Page B to Page A* (which is needed because they are referenced in the included content), without changing the body of Page A*.\r\n\r\nWhile this definitely worked back when I was developing this feature, we just discovered by accident that step 3 doesn\u2019t work anymore as intended. I don\u2019t know for how long this has been the case, but I hope for not too long, because this breaks one of the core features of our app without being immediately noticeable (because include macros are not identifiable when viewing the page).\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nFor reference, here are the two exact requests that we are doing:\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n{{}}\r\n{code:java}\r\n\r\n{code}\r\n{{POST https://cdauth.atlassian.net/wiki/rest/api/content/1182859265/copy?expand=children.attachment.version%2Cbody.storage%2Cmetadata.properties.K15tDocsPage%2Cversion%2Cspace}}\r\n{{ }}\r\n{{{ \"copyAttachments\" : true, \"copyPermissions\" : false, \"copyProperties\" : false, \"copyLabels\" : true, \"copyCustomContents\" : false, \"destination\" : { \"type\" : \"parent_page\", \"value\" : \"1185349633\" }, \"pageTitle\" : \"(v24) Include test\", \"body\" : { \"storage\" : { \"value\" : \"<p>Test content 1</p>\", \"representation\" : \"storage\" }, \"raw\" : null } } }}\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n{{}}\r\n{code:java}\r\n\r\n{code}\r\n{{POST https://cdauth.atlassian.net/wiki/rest/api/content/1179582465/copy?expand=children.attachment.version%2Cbody.storage%2Cmetadata.properties.K15tDocsPage%2Cversion%2Cspace }}\r\n\r\n{{{ \"copyAttachments\" : true, \"copyPermissions\" : false, \"copyProperties\" : false, \"copyLabels\" : false, \"copyCustomContents\" : false, \"destination\" : { \"type\" : \"existing_page\", \"value\" : \"2023293113\" }, \"pageTitle\" : \"(v24) Include test\", \"body\" : { \"storage\" : { \"value\" : \"<p>Test content 2</p>\", \"representation\" : \"storage\" }, \"raw\" : null } } }}\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nPage is copies completely\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nWhat seems to happen is that in step 3, when specifying a custom body using a parent_page copy destination, that custom body is ignored the the body of the target page is the same as the body of the source page. However, in step 4, when specifying a custom body using an existing_page copy destination, specifying the custom body seems to work.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\nh3.

This is a very helpful way to keep working with content creation, as we do not have to worry about saving it all the time.\r\nWhen we hit the close button, Confluence automatically saves our draft form where we stopped, so we can re-take the draft later to keep creating our content.\r\nAs we mention in our [public documentation about drafts|https://support.atlassian.com/confluence-cloud/docs/create-edit-and-publish-a-page/], we recommend only keeping your work as a draft when it's in a very early stage. This is because changes can't be tracked in a draft, and you can't roll back to previous editing sessions - both of which you can do for published pages.\r\nWe recommend that because if for some reason you get your editing lost in some way, there is no way to recover a previous version of the draft page.\r\n\r\nh3. Suggestion\r\nAfter the user clicks over the browser close button, or even after the *Close* button from within the editor, pops-up a warning message asking the user if he/she does not prefer to publish a restricted version of that page, in order to prevent any further issue that may occur with the draft content.
