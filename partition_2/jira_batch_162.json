      "description": "In this issue we want to gather feedback from customers about current behaviour of mentions/assignees. \r\n\r\nh1. Description\r\nIn Jira 8.19.1 we change method for searching users in mentions and assignees to improve Jira performance and reliability. Due to this changes list of users is generated based on permission scheme level and in result the list can contains users that are not assignable/mentionable because of other permissions.\r\n\r\nh1. What changed and why\r\nh3. Changes\r\nSince Jira 8.19.1 user lookup method for assignee and mentions became faster on large instances and keeps decent performance with scale. We achieve that by changing search method and now users are searched based on {{permission schemes}}. It allows us make huge performance improvement, but we also need to introduce a few limitations. The introduction of these changes was conscious and driven by the need to ensure the stability and the best possible performance of Jira, regardless of the size of the instance.\r\n\r\nh3. Limitations\r\nAny other filtering-out options outside of permission schemes are no longer respected. In result list of users, returned during attempt to assign or mention someone, can contains users that shouldn't be there. But it only applies to the returned list, we still make validations during saving such mention or assignee.\r\n\r\nFor example when we try to mention user in issue who has no permission to see this one due to some issue security level, we can do that but such user won't get any notification nor see the issue. \r\nAlso when we try to assign user that has no permission to be assigned due to e.g. ProjectPermissionOverrides, the operation will fail. \r\n\r\nh1. Possible solutions\r\nHere are couple of ways we consider, as improvement of UX in case the limitations prove to be significant inconvenience. Implemented in order to avoid situations when returned list will contains user which cannot be assignable/mentionable. \r\n# Keep invalid users on the returned list, but marked them as not selectable.\r\n# Stop showing such users. It would result in being some searches being empty, as long as username query will be long enough to point to a user which is not filtered out but such conditions.\r\n# Make sure we will not make as many calls until the unfiltered list contains some max number users as we are back to the performance problems before our changes\r\n\r\nh1. Available workarounds\r\nTo achieve similar behaviour as before our changes, required permissions can be configured on permission schemes level as well. \r\n",

      "description": "h3. Issue Summary\r\n\r\nWe have patters of issues related to sub-tasks where the system fields Affected Version and Fixed version are involved.\r\n# System fields relates to Versions (Affected & Fixed) are displayed on sub-tasks view even when they are not part of any screen (create/edit/view).\r\n# These fields are not inheriting values from parent issues and are simply displayed as NULL.\r\n# Users are able to bulk edit these values even when edit issue screen is not enabled with these fields.\r\n# When converting an issue type (Ex: User Story) with Version fields (Affected & Fixed) values set into a sub-task, these version fields are not emptied even though these fields are not part of the sub-task issue type screens in use.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Create a *TEST* project for validation of these patterns.\r\n # Create a separate screen-scheme for \"*sub-task*\" issue type and remove both fields \"*Affected Versions* & *Fixed Version*\" from field configurations and link it with \"*TEST*\" project for sub-task issue type.\r\n # Create a parent issue with/without \"*Versions(Affected &Fixed)*\" (by changing screen fields) and later create sub-tasks. Both Version fields (Affected & Fixed) appear on the sub-tasks view, so it is not respecting the fields configured as part of the screens in use. Though create and edit sub-tasks doesn't show these fields, view sub-task has appearance of both fields.\r\n # Now try and perform bulk edit operations on the Version fields for sub-tasks. Bulk edit of version fields for sub-task can be performed even when they are not part of the create/edit screen for sub-tasks.\r\n # Try converting an issue (user story for example) with Version fields (Affected & Fixed) set to a value into a sub-task, the Version fields retain the values even though these are not part of the issue type screens in use.\r\n # Try set-up Kanban boards to understand the effect of hiding the fields. Indeed the effect of [JSWSERVER-11315|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSWSERVER-11315] can be felt. However, as the specific functionality is based on the implementation of JQL functionality - that hidden fields would not participate in JQL/issue index searches. This demands users to have the functionality to ensure that sub-task issues respect the configured screen-scheme in use.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n # The Version fields (Affected and Fixed) shouldn't appear in the sub-task view when they are not part of the screens used.\r\n # Users should be able to edit these fields as long as they are not part of Create/Edit sub-task screens.\r\n # When another issues having these fields is converted into sub-task, these fields shouldn't appear as long as they are not part of the create/edit sub-task screens and should only be retained if they are part of the create/edit sub-task screens.\r\n # Users should be able to overcome the effect of [JSWSERVER-11315|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSWSERVER-11315] instead of hiding the fields as an alternative. It is possible with the workaround at the moment listed in the request but fixing this pattern will permanently address this.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n # The Version fields (Affected and Fixed) appear in the sub-task view even when they are not part of the screens used.\r\n # Users are able to bulkedit these fields even when they are not part of Create/Edit sub-task screens.\r\n # When other issue-type having Version fields is converted into sub-task, these fields appear even when they are not part of the create/edit sub-task screens and the values from previous issue-type are retained.\r\n\r\nh3.
