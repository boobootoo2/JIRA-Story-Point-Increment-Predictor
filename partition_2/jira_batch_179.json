Problem Definition\r\nMany of our customers are using modern versions of Linux distributions that come missing some of the system fonts that used to be packaged with older distributions of Linux.\r\nAlso many of our customers are moving to use AWS headless VMs or Docker containers that might not have all the X11 fonts installed.\r\nJIRA has a dependency on some system fonts that would be needed to properly render various charts on server side and send them over to be displayed on the client browser.\r\n\r\nCurrently the JIRA font dependencies are not clearly documented especially the fonts needed to be existing on the JIRA hosting server to allow charts to render correctly.\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\nPlease provide more documentation in JIRA supported platform on the font dependencies from JIRA hosting server side.\r\nThis would be the required fonts to allow JIRA to render all built-in charts without running into fonts issues.\r\nThis kind of list should belong to JIRA supported platform list.\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Why this is important\r\nShould allow customers to install the needed fonts in case those fonts are missing from their system.\r\n \r\nh3. Workaround \r\nCurrently the work around we have is to document individual cases in KBs, but it would be much better to have a formal supported platform section for fonts.",

Therefore, these non-changes should not update the Updated timestamp.\r\n\r\nThat's why I'm requesting two configuration options in the Agile Board settings.\r\n\r\n(\r\nNote that the above only applies to rank changes using drag n drop in the agile board.\r\nIt does not apply to the situation where I open an Issue and choose \"Rank to top\" or \"Rank to bottom\".\r\n)\r\n\r\nPlease add two options to a board's general configuration to control:\r\n\r\n{noformat}\r\n...\r\n...\r\nFilter Query: blah blah blah\r\nRanking: Using rank\r\n[x] Don't change the issue's updated time when changing rank\r\n[x] Don't send notification email when changing rank\r\nProjects in board: blah blah blah\r\n...\r\n...\r\n{noformat}",

Expected Results\r\nThe due date is expected to always be the same both on the \"dates\" and the \"Activity\" panels regardless of the user's timezone.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nIf the user is in a timezone west of the one configured on the server, the due date in \"Activity\" is one day less than that in the 'dates' panel\r\n \r\nh3. Notes\r\nThis problem happens because, on a DB level, we are storing a timestamp, not just a date - i.e. rather than storing \"2017-12-25\", we're also storing the hour, i.e. \"2017-12-25 00:00:00\". It goes without saying that midnight of any day in Amsterdam is 11 PM of the day before if you're in London, which is why the London user sees the day as the 24th whereas the issue info panel will show the day as the 25th.\r\n\r\nh3.Workaround\r\n* You can set all customers' timezone \"east\" of the server's\r\n* You can set the server's timezone to a place to the west of all users on the system\r\n* You should be able to set the default user timezone east of the server's (haven't verified this one)",

Problem Definition\r\n\r\nA client recently contacted support asking if it would be possible to allow users to install and uninstall add-ons without giving them full system administrator permissions, and how.\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nI couldn't really suggest any concrete solutions to speak of other than workarounds (see below). The client was made aware that add-on installation should be restricted to system administrator as it can bring down their entire instance, but they maintain that this is a critical requirement and that add-on installation\u00a0isn't something that can be entirely delegated to\u00a0JIRA system administrators.\r\nIdeally, they should be able to be able to allow users to add or remove add-ons regardless of whether they have sysadmin permissions.\r\nh3. Why this is important\r\n\r\nThe client explained that \"basic\" JIRA admins need to install (as well as remove) add-ons frequently, even daily, and that delegating all add-on installation to sysadmin staff is not an option.\r\nOn the other hand, JIRA admins cannot be given full system administration permissions for security reasons.\r\nh3. Workaround (Optional)\r\n\r\nI suggested the following:\r\n * Giving sysadmin privileges to users who have to install add-ons.\r\n * Creating a \"add-on request\" issue type and routing all matching issues to sysadmin staff for them to take care of.\r\n\r\nNeither workaround is ideal given the client's requirements, so while I raised a few points about why this can cause problems on their system, I also proposed raising a suggestion ticket for the feature.",

E.g, for a Jira issue (type story): \r\n\r\nJira Issue Summary: \"123456789 123456789 123456789 123456789 123456789 123456789 123456789 123456789 123456789 123456789 123456789 123456789 123456789 123456789 123456789\" (149 characters)\r\n\r\nSuggested branch name: RTA-5066-123456789-123456789-123456789-123456789-123456789-123456789-123456789-123456789-123456789 (98 characters)\r\n\r\nSuggested prefix: \"feature/\" (8 characters)\r\n\r\nThat makes a total length of the suggested branch name of 106, more than the 100 characters allowed for a branch name\r\n\r\nThis bug will also then lead to the following bug: https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/BSERV-10433\r\n\r\nh3.

We have now the additional requirement, to have certain AD groups being also synced. As the users are already synced by the first user dictionary this would be mainly about the group membership.

But actually I face the following:\r\n\r\n* a group with the correct name is created\r\n\r\n* the users are NOT assigned to this group.\r\n\r\nChecking the application server logs I can see, that users and the respective memberships are selected, but no assignments are done.

      "description": "h3. Summary \r\n\r\nIf you have running parallel sprints from different projects that share the same board, issues in a sprint from Project A that are completed after the beginning of the parallel sprint of the Project B will be moved to the next sprint on the Epic Burndown report even when these sprints are parallel sprints and shouldn't be sharing issues at all.\r\n\r\nh3. Description\r\n\r\nFor example: You have a board \"Atlassian\" that has a filter including several projects. You go to the Epic Burndown report and look for an epic \"Atlassian: Epic 10\".\r\nNow, you'll be able to track how many sprints are required to complete the epic. You'll look then for Team Green Sprint 27 and Team Red Sprint 27 that appears on this report. For this epic, only Team Green Sprint 27 had issues worked and completed on for this epic, Team Red Sprint has nothing to do with this Epic, but appears on this report as it's project is included in the filter for this board. These two sprints are parallel sprints.\r\n\r\nSprint's created and end dates:\r\n\"Team Green Sprint 27\" 14/09 17:00 - 28/09 17:00\r\n \"Team Red Sprint 27\" 14/09 17:57 - 28/09 17:59\r\n\r\n*Expected:*\r\nIssues would appear under sprint \"Team Green Sprint 27\" normally.\r\n\r\n*Current behaviour:*\r\nIssues are all appearing under \"Team Red Sprint 27\" even though they were never worked on this sprint neither have sub-tasks related to this sprint.\r\n\r\n*Cause:*\r\nIn the \"In the 'Completed Issues' table, why are some issues grouped into sprints that they are not assigned to?\" question on this documentation: https://confluence.atlassian.com/agile/jira-agile-user-s-guide/using-a-board/using-reports/viewing-the-epic-burndown# it says that if an issue assigned to Sprint 1 is completed after the start date of Sprint 2, this issue will appear on the Epic Burndown report grouped with Sprint 2 issues.\r\n\r\nSo, given the create and end dates of each Sprint in the given example above, issues that were created on the \"Team Green Sprint 27\" sprint that were closed after 17:57 (create date of \"Team Red Sprint 27\"), were moved to the next sprint of the period that the issue was closed, in that case, \"Team Red Sprint 27\", even though this sprint is from a different project that didn't work with the Epic we're looking at.\r\n\r\nHowever, this shouldn't work like this when you have parallel sprints from different projects that shares the same board but have nothing to do with each other.\r\n\r\nOn the Sprint Report and elsewhere on Jira, it shows the correct associated data. Just the Epic Burndown report that messes with the data, including the story points too on the Epic Report.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nCreate another board specific to the projects that the Epic will be working on.\r\n",
