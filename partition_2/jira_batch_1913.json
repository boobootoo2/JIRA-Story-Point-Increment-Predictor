I am a teacher at a high school, so I have one private space where I prepare my assignments, and then each class has it's own space. Often, I reuse assignments between several classes (albeit usually with some small adjustments), however they are usually doing them at different times. It would be good to be able to copy my original page (including attachments and child pages) into the particular class' Space, instead of editing the original, copying the text, pasting it into a new page in the Class's Space, then saving the attachments locally and re-uploading them, and then doing the same for any child pages. It gets slightly annoying after the 5th (or 50th) time...\"\r\n",

Administrators often need to be able to post content on behalf of their manager\r\n2. When bringing old content into Confluence it would be ideal to be able to maintain the original author without requiring that author to do the editing themselves\r\n\r\nThis relates to CONF-1711 which requires similar functionality for managing post dates. I guess what is really needed is a general metadata update privilege. Clearly this should not be a globally available privilege as it can be abused. I'd propose allowing administrators to be able to do this, and they should also to be able to grant permissions to others. It probably also needs to be a per-space setting.\r\n\r\n",

      "description": "We have created a DITA to Confluence converter that allows us to export our document set to Confluence. Though far from perfect, the converter has allowed us to export our entire document set to Confluence. We can work outside of Confluence to update and maintain our doc set and we can then export these changes to Confluence. One stumbling block we would like discussed is the unique page name per space limitation.\r\n\r\nBasically, our doc set is currently divided into several documents with children pages. Because of our DITA environment, we have setup several common pages that are referenced across all documents (for instance, we have a common copyright page that is used across all of the documents). This works fine when the information in the referenced page is the same across all documents, but this does not work when we have pages that are specific to just one document or set of documents. For instance, we'll have an introduction page for a Windows-related document that is not compatible with the Unix-related document. Currently, the first uploaded introduction page is the one that is used across all document sets so we end up say having the Windows introduction page in the Unix document.\r\n\r\nOur current proposed workaround is to have a convoluted page naming system (Introduction to Windows, Introduction to UNIX, etc), though, because of the size of our documentation set, we already see maintenance issues not to mention the creation of pedantic system that would have no benefit to our users (think Confluence Dewey decimal system for page names). Also, because we want to be able to order the pages in a logical order, we will have to add numbers to each page name as it seems the page ordering is still not possible in Confluence (see http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONF-1031).\r\n\r\nPerhaps another workaround would be to have each document be a separate space? However, this will defeat our efforts at having one \"documentation space.\" We can add unique page ids to each page outside of Confluence so that this can be cancelled at the beginning of DITA to confluence conversion process, however, our hands our tied if we can't have multiple versions of the same page name in the same space. Is there any way to enforce or add unique page id metadata that would allow us to create a workaround?\r\n\r\nNote: I have looked at several other Page-related issues and other Confluence issues, so hopefully I'm no duplicating this issue.",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFCLOUD-5914].\n  {panel}\n\nIt would be useful to have child pages automatically inherit access to attachments from the parent page.\r\n\r\nFor example, using !red.jpg! or [wordfile.doc] from page X would first access attachment to page X. If no attachment is found on that page with those names, then check the parent page of page X for an attachment with the same name. (and it's parent, etc, to the Home page for the space).\r\n\r\nThat way, the higher in the heirarchy you attach a file, the more accessible it is in the space, and you don't have to duplicate the file, or use long specific page references (esp. for long page names), and even more important, if you move the child, it inherits a new set of attachments from it's new parent.  You can always override this behaviour by specifying a specific page !mypage^red.jpg!.\r\n\r\nalternative:\r\nIt might be sometimes useful to go the other way (access child attachments from a parent) but this is more difficult due to the many-to-one relationship, the much larger number of pages to search,  and the possibility of naming conflicts.  In this case, there might not be a good rule to follow. However, in the first case, each child only has one parent, and depths of the page trees tend to be somewhat limited (6 degrees of separation?), so it is clear which file to use and quick to check the parental heirachy axis.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nJames.",

      "description": "{panel:bgColor=#e7f4fa}\n  *NOTE:* This suggestion is for *Confluence Server*. Using *Confluence Cloud*? [See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFCLOUD-5913].\n  {panel}\n\nFor many pages, especially when using the many handy macros and plugins, the wiki markup quickly gets too complex for the beginner user. Nonetheless, these pages often contain blocks of less-complex content that I would like our more beginner users to be able to contribute to.  We can sometimes get around this by using 'includes' and directing our beginner users to the included sections.  However, systematically creating 'includes' for every text-block on a page quickly becomes unscalable, AND the attachments of the parent page are not so easily accessible to the included children.\r\n\r\nSuggestion:\r\n1. Create an 'edit this section' or just 'edit' button which appears in the greyed-out header sections of h1. h2. h3. etc headers.  Clicking on this 'edit' button would open up a  WYSIWYG/wiki/preview editor *for that section alone*. Once edited and saved, this section should then be merged seamlessly back into the page. In this manner, people editing separate sections have very little chance of causing a conflict, and people are discouraged from editing (and perhaps 'locking') the entire page if they are just updating a title or paragraph.\r\n2. allow the same sort of tag to be added to {column} tags, as an option. {column:edit=true} or the like.\r\n3. similar for tables, add an 'edit' button along the title line which would only edit that one table. In this case, a special 'table' editor view with quick-buttons to work with the table might be useful (add/delete row/column etc)\r\n4. defined blocks: {editable}this text will have an 'edit' button before or after it, and be editable as a block{editable} (or something like this\r\n5. editing  table cells (esp. for complex content) on their own might be useful.  For this, a right-click item of some sort would be required, as not to clutter the table with 'edit' buttons. Alternatively, suggestion 4 might mean this is not required.\r\n6. any other {div} / {span} or other sectional tags could have an optional {tag:edit=true} field that feeds thier content into the 'sub-section' editor.  In fact, you could probably overload this parameter for ALL block plugins (with the default, of course, being edit=false).\r\n\r\nThis enhancement would have the added benefit to alleviate some of the rednering complaints of the WYSIWYG editor that people are reporting as plugin macros are added and are not rendered in a way which is pretty for 'end-end-users'.  Instead, 'simple' users would be able to simply edit the blocks they understand and have been given the 'edit' button, while more advanced users might edit an entire section, or the entire page.\r\n\r\nmediawiki, as seen at wikipedia, does this quite well for paragraph headers.  My suggestions here abstract that to one step higher to include other types of sections.\r\n\r\nThis is related to some requests for new features where the users wants the preview / editor to 'jump' to the section being edited, but is perhaps a more elegant solution.\r\n\r\n",

Stating \"Registered users\" would make it that little bit clearer as to what it means.\r\n\r\n---------------------------\r\n\r\nIs there any way to disable the \"In Confluence's configured database\" option on the attachment admin settings? In our hosted environment we will be using various file storage mechanisms (eventually moving file storage for our shared hosting on to a separate server, etc) and want to prevent users storing attachments in the db (albeit the db then simply stores the blobs on disk) just to keep things straightforward.",

I haven't seen this bug listed elsewhere.  For us it would be a show stopper, it's crippling to an easily editable wiki of editing it can randomly destroy the formatting, so I hope there is a simple solution because I'm trying to talk my group into using a Wiki (possibly Confluence) for our next project.\r\n\r\nThanks.",

Periodically a paniced email is sent to the Confluence mailing list asking how these files can be recovered. They can go through the backup/restore process but that is pretty painful and can take a while. It also doesn't help if a number of changes were made since the last backup.\r\n\r\nTo get around this we have instituted a policy of checking all such files into a separate source control system. Any files that need to be changed are checked out, modified and submitted to Confluence. Once they work the new version is checked back into source control. This process is tolerable, but it is a big overhead for such a simple feature.\r\n\r\nIt would be vastly preferable if Confluence treated these pieces of text as content just like pages, news etc. They could be versioned, you could see who edited them, you could see the diffs between versions etc. Since Confluence already has a powerful versioning system it seems like a no-brainer to use it for all the other pieces of content that are floating around.",
