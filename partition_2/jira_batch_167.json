In addition to that, some external factors such as the latency between the JVM and the DB server can also contribute to this behavior. \r\n\r\nIn some cases 15k rounds trips between the application and the database (see details below) will be required for the entire data set to be retrieved by the thread populating the cache - this translates to a total of _15 seconds_ of waiting time, if the latency between Jira and the DB server is at 1ms. An increased latency between the app server and the DB server will increase the time it takes for the full results of the query to reach the application exponentially.\r\n\r\nh3.

Notes\r\n* Problem get amplified for Oracle DB.  The reason for this is that by default, the Oracle JDBC driver fetch results of a SQL query streaming it from DB by 10 rows at a time. In a situation where a table has 150k records, 15k round trips will be required for the complete information of the table to reach the application. When the sprint cache gets flushed, a full table scan of the {{AO_60DB71_SPRINT}} table is performed to populate the sprint cache.\r\n* Using an instance where 150k sprints exist as an example in Oracle DB , 15k rounds trips between the application and the database will be required for the entire data set to be retrieved by the thread waiting on this information - this translates to a total of 15 seconds if the latency between Jira and the DB server is at 1ms. An increased latency between the app server and the DB server will increase the time it takes for the full results of the query to reach the application exponentially.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n* For Oracle DB, Increase the number of results that can be fetched at a single time by the Oracle JDBC driver:\r\nhttps://docs.oracle.com/cd/E18283_01/java.112/e16548/resltset.htm#i1023619\r\nThis can be done by adding the following line to the {{dbconfig.xml}} file, inside the {{<jdbc-datasource>}} section:\r\n{code}\r\n<connection-properties>defaultRowPrefetch=XXX</connection-properties>\r\n{code}\r\n(i) XXX translates to the numerical value of results we'll be fetching. The default value is 10 - we have seen an increase to _200_ being very effective while adding very little overhead to the JVM's memory utilization.\r\n* See also a related KB [Using the default Oracle JDBC fetch size may lead to performance issues in Jira|https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirakb/using-the-default-oracle-jdbc-fetch-size-may-lead-to-performance-issues-in-jira-1014278793.html]",

Should the Issues are now in different Status, it will be shown as blank.\r\n\r\n(!) It seems the Bug would only occur if none of the Issues in the Sprint Report is currently in any of the Status recorded in the report. So let's say 2 issues were in 'Status 1' when the Sprint is completed, hence shown in the Sprint Report. Should only 1 of the issue is transitioned to a different Status, the Bug would not occur. However, if both Issues are no longer in Status 1, the Sprint Report would display the Status as blank.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nThe Sprint Report would show the Sprint Report according to the recorded data at the point of the Sprint completion\r\n !sprintReportFine.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nThe Sprint Report would display blank Statuses if the Issues are no longer in the same Status when the report was generated\r\n !sprintReportBug.png|thumbnail! \r\n(i) In the screenshot, I transitioned QQQ-17 to a different Status to show that the Bug also affects Completed Issues\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\nNone",

Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n# Create a new board with a board filter like: *project = SSP ORDER BY Rank ASC*\r\n# On the board, create few Sprints.\r\n# Add some issues to the Sprint.\r\n# Start a Sprint and complete it.\r\n# Repeat the step with the rest of the Sprints.\r\n# Check the Velocity Chart on the board to verify that the Sprints are shown correctly.\r\n# Create a new board with a similar board filter as the original board: *project = SSP ORDER BY Rank ASC*\r\n# Navigate to the Velocity Chart on the board and we will see that report shows *There are no available sprints for this board.* message\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\n* Velocity Chart shows the last completed Sprints.\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nVelocity Chart shows the following message and no Sprint is shown:\r\n\r\n{quote}\r\nThere are no available sprints for this board.*\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround 1\r\n\r\nCreating a new Sprint on the board affected board and completing it will allow the Velocity Chart to work again.\r\n\r\n* Create a new Sprint on the affected board.\r\n* Add an issue to the new Sprint.\r\n* Complete the Sprint.\r\n* Check the Velocity Chart on the affected board again.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround 2\r\nMaking a REST API call to *PUT agile/1.0/board/boardId/settings/refined-velocity* through Postman, Curl or using the Atlassian REST API browser add-on.\r\n\r\nh4. Using the [Atlassian REST API Browser|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1211542/atlassian-rest-api-browser?hosting=server&tab=overview]\r\n# Let's install the [Atlassian REST API Browser|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1211542/atlassian-rest-api-browser?hosting=server&tab=overview] (this is a free tool that will add a REST API interface to help us apply the workaround easily)\r\n # Navigate to *_Administration > System > REST API Browser_*\r\n # Make sure the box \"Show only public APIs\" is *not selected*\r\n # Enter your admin credentials to display all the REST API endpoints\r\n # Search for the endpoint called\r\n{code:java}\r\nagile/1.0/board/{boardId}/settings/refined-velocity{code}\r\n # Go to the *PUT* tab\r\n # Insert the *boardId* of the board affected (this can be found at the Jira URL when you navigate to the board - it will be the something like \"rapidView=2\")\r\n # Click on *+ Parameter*\r\n # Under the \"Parameter\" column, insert *value*\r\n # Under the \"Value\" column, insert *false*\r\n # At the \"Request Body\", make sure that we are sending an empty body like this:\r\n{code:java}\r\n{\r\n\r\n}{code}\r\n\r\n # Click on *Send*\r\n # Check if the Velocity Chart is working again\r\n # Repeat the process to all boards affected\r\n\r\nh4. Using the cURL command in a terminal window\r\n{code}curl -X PUT -u $USERNAME -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \"JIRA_URL/rest/agile/1.0/board/boardId/settings/refined-velocity?value=false\" -d \"{ }\"{code}\r\n(!)

The returned query result populates the confirmation page:\r\n!2020-05-14_15-14-17.png|thumbnail!\r\n3. Once you hit delete, it iterates through each of those issues with individual SELECT queries followed by the DELETE query to delete the options from each issue keys:\r\n{code}\r\n2020-05-10 12:34:19,607+0530 http-nio-8080-exec-5 admin 754x861x1 1jdq6ii /secure/admin/EditCustomFieldOptions!remove.jspa 1ms \"SELECT ID, ISSUE, CUSTOMFIELD, UPDATED, PARENTKEY, STRINGVALUE, NUMBERVALUE, TEXTVALUE, DATEVALUE, VALUETYPE FROM public.customfieldvalue WHERE ISSUE='14848' AND CUSTOMFIELD='11300' AND STRINGVALUE='10603'\"\r\n2020-05-10 12:34:19,609+0530 http-nio-8080-exec-5 admin 754x861x1 1jdq6ii /secure/admin/EditCustomFieldOptions!remove.jspa 1ms \"DELETE FROM public.customfieldvalue WHERE ID='23337'\"\r\n--\r\n2020-05-10 12:34:19,613+0530 http-nio-8080-exec-5 admin 754x861x1 1jdq6ii /secure/admin/EditCustomFieldOptions!remove.jspa 1ms \"SELECT ID, ISSUE, CUSTOMFIELD, UPDATED, PARENTKEY, STRINGVALUE, NUMBERVALUE, TEXTVALUE, DATEVALUE, VALUETYPE FROM public.customfieldvalue WHERE ISSUE='14849' AND CUSTOMFIELD='11300' AND STRINGVALUE='10603'\"\r\n2020-05-10 12:34:19,614+0530 http-nio-8080-exec-5 admin 754x861x1 1jdq6ii /secure/admin/EditCustomFieldOptions!remove.jspa 1ms \"DELETE FROM public.customfieldvalue WHERE ID='23652'\"\r\n--\r\n{code}\r\netc.\r\n\r\nIf the first SELECT query takes a very long time, then UI times out even before getting to the confirm delete page and hence becomes very difficult to delete customfield option.\r\n\r\nWe could potentially bulk update all issues using this value to be deleted before running the delete option call which would reduce the number of times the SELECT query iterations. However, this become cumbersome any ways for large environments.\r\n\r\nh3.Workaround\r\n* (/) The workaround would be to add explicit index on the *{{customfield}}* column:\r\n{code:sql}CREATE INDEX customfieldvalue_customfield_explicit_index on customfieldvalue (customfield);{code}\r\n* Increasing the Reverse Proxy timeout value to let the call finish could be one workaround",

More specifically, fields that present a list of values for user to choose from don't offer this possibility.\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nIt would be great to allow for the creation of custom fields (Select list type) where either avatar or emojis can be added. This way, not only Type and Priority fields contain avatars, allowing for a more refined customisation of Jira instance.\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nUse an add-on such as the\u00a0[Icons for Jira|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1214988/icons-for-jira?hosting=server&tab=overview] that add a specific type of custom field, which allows the use of avatars.",
