It seems to be a Google auto-translation, or something else. I'm a Russian and I can read Russian ok, but the problem is that automatic translation often makes no sense at all. Is this a new feature? Please let me turn it off!\r\n\r\nStrangely though, the questions are still in English.\r\n\r\nThanks for your support!\r\nIgor",
