Given the number of plugins for JIRA available, it happens quite often that we would like to start using a given plugin for on of our company's divisions only, limiting the licence (and price) of the plugin.\r\n\r\nDue to your matching licences policy, this is not possible, which many times stops us from getting additional products complementing your tools.\r\n\r\nIMHO, one of the main reasons for Atlassian's products success is the highly flexible and usable User Management approach, but oddly enough, the matching licences policy is a big obstacle to going deeper into the Atlassian ecosystem.\r\n\r\nI therefore suggest you implement a more flexible licensing policy, where the system admin can 1) choose a sub-set of users from JIRA\u00a0licence which have access to a given plugin, or 2) select all users if the licences match.",

      "description": "h2. Problem summary\r\n\r\nCurrently a user directory can only be configured to accept one base DN for users, and one base DN for users. If users or groups (that are relevant to JIRA) exist in multiple containers/OUs of the LDAP structure, then the base DN has to be set wide enough so that both OUs are in the scope of the search. This can cause too many irrelevant groups to be pulled into JIRA, which in turn leads to performance issues or complexity in maintaining user management. Also if you'd like to assume memberships from a different OU, it's nearly impossible with AD.\u00a0\r\nh2. Example\r\n\r\nFor example: consider the case where we have the following LDAP structure, for simplicity's sake we're only looking for groups right now and not users:\r\n{code:java}\r\nDC=company,DC=com\r\n  +--- OU=all_groups\r\n         +--- OU=amer_groups\r\n         +--- OU=apac_groups\r\n         +--- OU=50k_other_irrelevant_groups\r\n{code}\r\nIf we want to pull in the groups under\u00a0{{amer_groups}}\u00a0and\u00a0{{apac_groups}}, then the group base DN must be set to\u00a0{{\"OU=all_groups,DC=company,DC=com}}\" since both of of them are under that common OU.\r\n\r\nThe problem is, doing so will also pull the other 50k groups we don't care about into JIRA, because that's also within the search scope. For some LDAP implementations, this is not a problem because you can exclude those irrelevant groups by using\u00a0[Extensible Matching|https://ldapwiki.willeke.com/wiki/ExtensibleMatch]\u00a0in a search filter to target groups that are within specific OUs. However some LDAP implementations, most notably Microsoft Active Directory, do\u00a0[not support this type of filtering|https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc223241.aspx], and therefore JIRA will have no choice but to pull in all of the groups.\r\n\r\nAnd you can't add another connector to the same directory as Jira will only sync memberships of the directory that is in the highest order.\u00a0\r\nh2. Proposed solution\r\n\r\nIt would be ideal if JIRA\u00a0itself can allow a single directory to search for users/groups from multiple DNs, regardless of the AD/LDAP implementation.",

This is different than other user pickers, which won't suggest any values when typing, but will accept exact usernames.\r\n\r\nThis seems to be by design, since we explicitly check for global permissions for the specified user:\r\n{code:java|borderStyle=solid|borderColor=#6A8EB3|bgColor=#F8F8F8}\r\npublic void validate(ProjectActionSupport action, Map params) {\r\n        super.validate(action, params);\r\n        final String developer = (String) params.get(\"developer\");\r\n        final boolean canPickUsers = action.hasGlobalPermission(GlobalPermissionKey.USER_PICKER);\r\n\r\n        if (!TextUtils.stringSet(developer)) {\r\n            action.addError(\"developer\", action.getText(\"report.developerworkload.developer.is.required\"));\r\n        } else if (!canPickUsers) {\r\n            action.addError(\"developer\", action.getText(\"report.developerworkload.developer.does.not.exist\"));\r\n        } else if (userManager.getUserByName(developer) == null) {\r\n            action.addError(\"developer\", action.getText(\"report.developerworkload.developer.does.not.exist\"));\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to be able to specify any user, just like all other user pickers in Jira.\r\n\r\nh3. How to replicate\r\n# Create a sample Scrum project named *SCRUM*.\r\n# Navigate to *Cog Icon > Issues > Time tracking* and make sure it is enabled.\r\n# Navigate to *Cog Icon > System > Global permissions*. Delete the groups *jira-software-users* and *jira-core-users* from the *Browse Users* permission. The only remaining group should be *jira-administrators*.\r\n# Create 2 non-admin users called *one* and *two*.\r\n# Navigate to *Cog Icon > Issues > Custom field > Add custom field* and add a *User picker* custom field. Select all screens in the next page.\r\n# While logged-in as an *admin* user, create a new issue. Try entering the values *one* or *two* in the user picker custom field and note how Jira provides suggestions.\r\n# Sign off Jira.\r\n# Sign into Jira using one of the *non-admin* users created earlier.\r\n# Create a new issue. Try entering a username in the user picker custom field. Note how Jira won't provide suggestions. Now enter an exact username in the custom field, and note how Jira accepts it.\r\n# Navigate to *Projects > SCRUM > Reports > Switch report > All reports > User Workload Report*.\r\n# Try entering an exact username in the user picker. Note how Jira won't accept any values, showing the following error message:\r\n{noformat:none|borderStyle=solid|borderColor=#6A8EB3|bgColor=#F8F8F8}\r\nThe user you selected does not exist, or you do not have permission to select users. \r\n{noformat}\r\n# Sign off Jira, and sign-in back as an admin user.\r\n# Navigate to *Projects > SCRUM > Reports > Switch report > All reports > User Workload Report*.\r\n# Try entering some usernames in the user picker, and note how Jira provides suggestions normally.\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\nChange the behavior on the user picker for this report, to allow entering exact usernames.",

      "description": "h3. Issue Summary\r\nAfter changing selected Quick Filter the Backlog starts to load. When it's loading it is possible to change Quick Filter selection once again, which will query Jira server for new Backlog data. The data from the request that will finish last will be displayed to the user. Quick Filter buttons are not synchronised to what data is loaded, meaning that if first query will finish after the second one, then the visible state of backlog is inconsistent with what Quick Filters user can see as selected.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Create a Scrum Project \"PROJ\" with sample data (more than 1 issue is required)\r\n# To the \"PROJ\" Project's Backlog add a Quick filter named \"PROJ-1\" with the following JQL query:\r\n{code}\r\nissueKey = PROJ-1\r\n{code}\r\n# (!) Slow down http response for query on \"<JIRA_URL>/rest/greenhopper/1.0/xboard/plan/backlog/data.json?(...)\" that has no \"activeQuickFilters\"\r\n** This can be done in many different way, scroll down to *Notes* to see examples\r\n** It can happen naturally in non-synthetic environment (e.g. network slowness or many issues in the backlog)\r\n# Enable any Quick Filter other than \"PROJ-1\"\r\n# Disable the enabled Quick Filter\r\n# As the backlog loads immediately enable \"PROJ-1\" Quick Filter\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nOnly issues limited by last configuration of selected Quick Filters is displayed\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nNot-filtered issue list is displayed. \"PROJ-1\" Quick Filter is still selected.\r\n\r\n !Screenshot 2019-11-29 at 20.33.32.png|thumbnail! \r\n^~The screenshot is not representing the  scenario described above, but is also showing the problem~^\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nCurrently there is no known workaround for this behavior. A workaround will be added here when available\r\n\r\nh3. Notes\r\nArtificial response delay can be made e.g. by:\r\n* Using JVM debugger to stop *thread* execution when handling the request to \"/rest/greenhopper/1.0/xboard/plan/backlog/data\" endpoint\r\n* Using Jira [plugin with http filter|https://developer.atlassian.com/server/framework/atlassian-sdk/servlet-filter-plugin-module/] similar to this:\r\n{code}\r\nimport javax.servlet.Filter;\r\nimport javax.servlet.FilterChain;\r\nimport javax.servlet.FilterConfig;\r\nimport javax.servlet.ServletRequest;\r\nimport javax.servlet.ServletResponse;\r\nimport javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest;\r\nimport javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse;\r\nimport java.util.regex.Pattern;\r\n\r\npublic class HttpRequestDelayFilter implements Filter {\r\n    private final Pattern URI_PATTERN = Pattern.compile(\"/rest/greenhopper/1\\\\.0/xboard/plan/backlog/data\\\\.json.*\");\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    public void init(final FilterConfig filterConfig) { }\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    public void doFilter(final ServletRequest request,\r\n                         final ServletResponse response,\r\n                         final FilterChain chain) {\r\n        if (request instanceof HttpServletRequest && response instanceof HttpServletResponse) {\r\n            final HttpServletRequest servletRequest = (HttpServletRequest) request;\r\n            if (URI_PATTERN.matcher(servletRequest.getRequestURI()).find() &&\r\n                    servletRequest.getParameter(\"activeQuickFilters\") == null) {\r\n                try {\r\n                    Thread.sleep(5_000L); // 5 seconds\r\n                } catch (final InterruptedException e) {\r\n                    throw new RuntimeException(e);\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    public void destroy() { }\r\n}\r\n{code}\r\n",

      "description": "h3. Issue Summary\r\n\r\nCertain functionalities in Jira, such as trying to mention users or otherwise typing usernames into user fields, allow Jira to return user suggestions as usernames are being typed out. \r\n\r\nAs the searching user types, Jira will use a thread to perform a search against what they've typed and return possible results back to the user. In instances with many users, directories, or nested groups, these searches may be computationally expensive and may run for several seconds in order to return results.\r\n\r\nIt is possible for the searching user to continue typing and end up making multiple user search requests before the previous requests ever complete and return. Jira will not cancel or otherwise terminate previously ongoing search threads in this case.\r\n\r\nThe instance may experience high CPU load and thread utilization if too many of these threads are working on these searches concurrently.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Have many users, groups/nested groups, and directories.\r\n# Attempt to search for a user (i.e. by mentioning or perhaps trying to assign an issue), by typing a character out at a pace of 2-3 characters/second.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nSuggested users will be returned, and no other behaviors (high CPU/thread usage) are observed.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nSuggested users may be returned, but CPU and thread usage run high. Excessive usage may cause the system to become unresponsive. \r\n\r\nThread Dumps show many threads like the following, which showcase a user mention being searched against nested groups in this particular example:\r\n{code}\"http-nio-8080-exec-20 url:/rest/internal/2/user/mention/search username:\" #49 daemon prio=5 os_prio=0 tid=0x00007f8210b43000 nid=0x5d85 runnable [0x00007f810e1e1000]\r\n   java.lang.Thread.State: RUNNABLE\r\n\t...\r\n\tat com.atlassian.crowd.search.EntityDescriptor.toString(EntityDescriptor.java:103)\r\n\tat java.lang.String.valueOf(String.java:2994)\r\n\tat java.lang.StringBuilder.append(StringBuilder.java:131)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.crowd.search.query.membership.MembershipQuery.(MembershipQuery.java:60)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.crowd.search.query.membership.GroupMembershipQuery.(GroupMembershipQuery.java:19)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.crowd.search.builder.QueryBuilder.createMembershipQuery(QueryBuilder.java:177)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.crowd.search.builder.QueryBuilder$PartialMembershipQueryWithNameToMatch.returningAtMost(QueryBuilder.java:285)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.crowd.manager.directory.RemoteDirectorySearcher.findNestedGroupMembershipsIncludingGroups(RemoteDirectorySearcher.java:278)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.crowd.manager.directory.RemoteDirectorySearcher.findNestedGroupMembershipsOfUser(RemoteDirectorySearcher.java:300)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.crowd.manager.directory.RemoteDirectorySearcher.getParentDirectoryEntities(RemoteDirectorySearcher.java:203)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.crowd.manager.directory.RemoteDirectorySearcher.getRelatedDirectoryEntities(RemoteDirectorySearcher.java:191)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.crowd.manager.directory.RemoteDirectorySearcher.searchNestedGroupRelationships(RemoteDirectorySearcher.java:170)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.crowd.manager.directory.DirectoryManagerGeneric.searchNestedGroupRelationships(DirectoryManagerGeneric.java:750)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.crowd.manager.application.SingleDirectorySearchStrategy.searchNestedGroupRelationships(SingleDirectorySearchStrategy.java:71){code}\r\n\r\nAccess Logs show individual HTTP requests being made for each character typed:\r\n{code}/rest/api/latest/user/assignable/search?username=j\r\n/rest/api/latest/user/assignable/search?username=ji\r\n/rest/api/latest/user/assignable/search?username=jir\r\n/rest/api/latest/user/assignable/search?username=jira\r\n/rest/api/latest/user/assignable/search?username=jiraa{code}\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nReducing the complexity and dataset of users, groups, nested groups, and directories may help reduce the calculation cost and time of these searches.\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nAllow administrators to configure the frequency at which the browser may submit search requests.",

Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Go to [https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiraserver/migrating-jira-applications-to-another-server-938846962.html]\r\n # Read the article.\u00a0\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nA clear, numbered, step-by-step explanation of how to migrate the application to a new server.\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nUnnumbered, conversational, incomplete instructions that only apply to one method, and it is not clearly stated that this applies only to copy/paste Jira_home migrations.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThis is also a very time-intensive method because it tells you to make an xml back as the first step.\u00a0 That means that Jira has to be shut down for the entirety of the process instead of doing other steps first and\u00a0_then_\u00a0making a backup of the actual data.\u00a0\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nThere is no workaround, but I would suggest clearly stating\u00a0+which+ method of migration this applies to (there are multiple methods), and make sure the instructions are complete.\u00a0\r\n\r\nPlease separate the migration and upgrade procedures as well.\u00a0 We already have upgrade documents, so this should be a\u00a0+migration only+ document.\u00a0",
