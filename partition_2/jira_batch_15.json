      "description": "Starting with Version 1709, Windows 10 includes an OpenSSH client and server that you can enable as optional features in settings.\r\n\r\nThe advantage of this is not only that no additional installation of OpenSSH is necessary when using Windows but also that the included SSH agent leverages the Windows Credential Manager to store any SSH key passphrases in the registry securely encrypted with the Windows user password. This means that the SSH agent automatically unlocks the SSH keys during login so it is not necessary to enter the passphrases when starting the SSH agent as would be the case when using PuTTY Pageant or Git's inbuilt SSH agent on Windows.\r\n\r\nGit has a configuration flag in the global .gitconfig under\u00a0[core] called sshCommand that you can set to a custom path to the SSH executable. Setting this to Windows' own SSH client (\"{color:#172b4d}C:\\Windows\\System32\\OpenSSH\\ssh.exe\"{color}) lets Git use Windows' own SSH agent as well. This setting works without issue in Git Bash or in e.g. VS Code.\r\n\r\nHowever, SourceTree seems to ignore this setting and keeps using Git's built-in SSH agent under (by default)\u00a0\"C:\\Program Files\\Git\\usr\\bin\\ssh-agent.exe\". This is when using SourceTree's presetting \"OpenSSH\" for the SSH client.\r\n\r\nPlease update SourceTree to either use said configuration flag in the .gitconfig or to let one specify a custom path to an SSH client in SourceTree's settings.",

Changing the URL from {{git@bitbucket.org:<team_or_user>/<repo>.git}} to\u00a0{{<username>@bitbucket.org:<team_or_user>/<repo>.git}} fixes this issue but I don't want to have to manually do this every time.\r\nh2.

Its so so slow, and by slow I dont mean slow at things, it HANGS numerous amount of times. If possible I can attach a video to it to make you understand if you all already don't know this. Please tell me I will do that too.\u00a0\r\n\r\nIf I pull, it hangs, and comes back after 10-20 secs, if I try to resolve conflict it does not allow me to do that unless hanging 2-3 times, even if I scroll down to the Stashes, it hangs, I just click on the Working copy in file status, it hangs, eventually everything I do in the source tree hangs. Do you have an fix for this or is it this way all through the way.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe only reason I use source tree is because of the UI friendliness when it comes to viewing stashes, its easy to use it. But why do I have to pay such a high price of using that????\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nDo you have something here or Do I have to just stop using SourceTree and go to git bash. Perhaps the same thing is not there for Mac. Maybe you guys have invested more on MAc developers than Windows...!!!",
