      "description": "Confluence will corrupt nested macros inside a unknown macro, leading to data loss in the page storage. The bug lies in the XhtmlContent's implementation and what the class does when a macro definition does not exists or it's not available.\r\n\r\nWhen the xhtmlContent.handleMacroDefinitions method is called with a block of xhtml content which contains a reference to a macro module that has been disabled it will return invalid data - such that it ignores the macros that the disabled macro contains and will conflate the parameters of those macros into the disable MacroDefinition.\r\n\r\nxhtmlContent.handleMacroDefinitions will generates invalid data leading to data loss.\r\n\r\nIn the page we will see this image:\r\n !image1.png|thumbnail! \r\nAnd if we edit the page, nothing will appear inside the macro:\r\n !image2.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\nThe storage format shows that the data exist in the page and the following error appears in the logs:\r\n{code}\r\nhandleMacroExecutionException Exception executing macro: jira-form-wrapper, with message: Unable to locate projectKey input, use the blueprint to generate a new form and copy/paste the macro back in to the form.\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nh4.

How to replicate this problem\r\n\r\nThere are at least two types of scenario to cause this problem \u2013\r\n *Scenario 1*\r\n # Create a Confluence Instance with many content. e.g. 20,000 content.\r\n # Create a user who has access permission to the contents created in step 1. e.g. testuser\r\n # Clear cache\r\n # Send a GET request with {{rest/api/content?start=<any number over 500>}} to the instance. e.g. start from 10,000\r\n{code:java}\r\ncurl -u testuser:testuser http://<confluence-base-url>/rest/api/content?start=10000\r\n{code}\r\n\r\ni.e. Confluence tries to fetch all 10,500 contents to obtain just 500 contents from 10,001st to 10,500th items.\r\n\r\n*Scenario 2*\r\n # Create a Confluence Instance with many content. e.g. 20,000 content.\r\n # Create a user who *doesn't* have access permission to the contents created in step 1. e.g. testuser\r\n # Clear cache\r\n # Send a GET request with {{rest/api/content}} to the instance.\r\n{code:java}\r\ncurl -u testuser:testuser http://<confluence-base-url>/rest/api/content\r\n{code}\r\n\r\ni.e. Confluence tries to fetch all 20,000 contents to filter the contents on which the testuser has permission.\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nFor scenario 1, to obtain data for {{rest/api/content?start=10000}} , *only* the query\r\n{code:java}\r\nselect abstractpa0_.CONTENTID as CONTENTI1_12_, .... from CONTENT abstractpa0_ \r\n... limit 10000, 501;\r\n{code}\r\nshould be issued.\r\n\r\nFor scenario 2, filter the CONTENT first with permission and fetch the items later.\r\nh3.

      "description": "h2. Summary\r\nThere's an internal Hibernate Adapter Map used to support Hibernate API Versions 2 and 5. The purpose of the map is to translate exceptions and other tasks from one version to another. This map can get corrupted, which can cause threads to get stuck when executing the WeakHashMap method, which is not thread safe and can lock the entire application.\r\n\r\nh2. Symptoms\r\nApplication tasks that rely on achieving connections from the database, such as the Index, may stop working, since the WeakHashMap locks all threads who doesn't have a connection to the database yet.  There may be other operations that can be impacted too.\r\n\r\nThe way to identify this scenario is by taking thread dumps, where we see the majority of the threads in either Blocked or Waiting statuses, while there's only one thread in Runnable status, executing a WeakHashMap:\r\n{code}\r\n\"http-nio-8091-exec-492\" daemon prio=5 tid=0x00000000000022bb nid=0 runnable \r\n   java.lang.Thread.State: RUNNABLE\r\n\tat java.util.WeakHashMap.get(WeakHashMap.java:403)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.hibernate.adapter.adapters.HibernateExceptionAdapter.adapt(HibernateExceptionAdapter.java:35)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.hibernate.adapter.adapters.session.SessionV2Adapter.connection(SessionV2Adapter.java:161)\r\n\tat org.springframework.orm.hibernate.HibernateTransactionManager.doBegin(HibernateTransactionManager.java:422)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.confluence.impl.hibernate.ConfluenceHibernateTransactionManager.doBegin(ConfluenceHibernateTransactionManager.java:41)\r\n\tat org.springframework.transaction.support.AbstractPlatformTransactionManager.getTransaction(AbstractPlatformTransactionManager.java:373)\r\n\tat sun.reflect.GeneratedMethodAccessor54.invoke(Unknown Source)\r\n\tat sun.reflect.DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.java:43)\r\n\tat java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Method.java:498)\r\n\tat org.springframework.aop.support.AopUtils.invokeJoinpointUsingReflection(AopUtils.java:302)\r\n\tat org.springframework.aop.framework.JdkDynamicAopProxy.invoke(JdkDynamicAopProxy.java:202)\r\n\tat com.sun.proxy.$Proxy34.getTransaction(Unknown Source)\r\n\tat org.springframework.transaction.interceptor.TransactionAspectSupport.createTransactionIfNecessary(TransactionAspectSupport.java:427)\r\n\tat org.springframework.transaction.interceptor.TransactionAspectSupport.invokeWithinTransaction(TransactionAspectSupport.java:276)\r\n\tat org.springframework.transaction.interceptor.TransactionInterceptor.invoke(TransactionInterceptor.java:96)\r\n\tat org.springframework.aop.framework.ReflectiveMethodInvocation.proceed(ReflectiveMethodInvocation.java:179)\r\n\tat org.springframework.aop.framework.JdkDynamicAopProxy.invoke(JdkDynamicAopProxy.java:208)\r\n\tat com.sun.proxy.$Proxy36.retrieve(Unknown Source)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.confluence.setup.bandana.ConfluenceCachingBandanaPersister.lambda$retrieve$0(ConfluenceCachingBandanaPersister.java:80)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.confluence.setup.bandana.ConfluenceCachingBandanaPersister$$Lambda$359/1698215470.get(Unknown Source)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.confluence.impl.vcache.SynchronousExternalCache.lambda$get$10(SynchronousExternalCache.java:236)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.confluence.impl.vcache.SynchronousExternalCache$$Lambda$361/2117426375.get(Unknown Source)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.vcache.internal.core.metrics.TimedSupplier.get(TimedSupplier.java:32)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.vcache.internal.core.service.AbstractStableReadExternalCache.lambda$null$5(AbstractStableReadExternalCache.java:116)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.vcache.internal.core.service.AbstractStableReadExternalCache$$Lambda$375/922126746.get(Unknown Source)\r\n\tat java.util.Optional.orElseGet(Optional.java:267)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.vcache.internal.core.service.AbstractStableReadExternalCache.lambda$get$6(AbstractStableReadExternalCache.java:114)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.vcache.internal.core.service.AbstractStableReadExternalCache$$Lambda$368/1620586459.call(Unknown Source)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.vcache.internal.core.service.AbstractExternalCache.perform(AbstractExternalCache.java:83)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.vcache.internal.core.service.AbstractExternalCache.perform(AbstractExternalCache.java:69)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.vcache.internal.core.service.AbstractStableReadExternalCache.get(AbstractStableReadExternalCache.java:100)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.vcache.internal.core.metrics.TimedExternalCache.get(TimedExternalCache.java:67)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.confluence.impl.vcache.SynchronousExternalCache.get(SynchronousExternalCache.java:236)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.confluence.setup.bandana.ConfluenceCachingBandanaPersister.retrieve(ConfluenceCachingBandanaPersister.java:78)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.confluence.setup.bandana.ConfluenceCachingBandanaPersister.retrieve(ConfluenceCachingBandanaPersister.java:71)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.bandana.DefaultBandanaManager.getValue(DefaultBandanaManager.java:32)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.bandana.DefaultBandanaManager.getValue(DefaultBandanaManager.java:24)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.confluence.setup.settings.DefaultSettingsManager.getGlobalSettings(DefaultSettingsManager.java:38)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.confluence.status.service.DefaultSystemInformationService.getConfluenceInfo(DefaultSystemInformationService.java:97)\r\n\tat org.apache.jsp._500page_jsp._jspService(_500page_jsp.java:306)\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nh2.

The current application on AWS is divided into the below modules:\r\n\r\nEC2 instance(on which we have application and home directories, attachments and other user data)\r\n\r\nDatabase- RDS(hosted on postgreSQL v9.4.15)\r\n\r\nNow we want to upgrade confluence to the latest version and migrate it to the Datacenter. As part of this activity, we have already created a test environment on AWS based on the ATL and AMI scripts provided by Atlassian here: [https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-aws-deployment/src/4d30f76f1c197167e56200fa2623c407a3fd550f/ami/scripts/init.d/?at=master]\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe test environment we have has got the following modules:(all provisioned in AWS)\r\n\r\nTwo confluence node servers\r\n\r\nLoad Balancer\r\n\r\nDatabase(postgreSQL v9.5.10)\r\n\r\nNow the challenge is to migrate the database from our production environment to the test environment(datacenter). The production database is using the default database and schema settings that came with the standalone installation of confluence. But on datacenter environment, as we setup the database using ATL and AMI scripts, the schemas and the database user seems to be different. Could you please assist us with the following queries so that we will be able to proceed with our migration:\r\n\r\nSo we would like to know how can we proceed with the migration of data so that we can have exact production replica on the test environment. What are the ways that we can do this?\r\n\r\nAnd also, if we skip the database migration and opt for confluence site export and import does it replicate the application data as expected?\r\n\r\nDoes site export and import takes into account the personal spaces and also the unpublished drafts? Or does it only imports published pages?\r\n\r\nMany thanks!\r\n\r\nBest Regards,\r\n\r\nMonika\r\n\r\n\u00a0",

This creates a race condition and can cause attachments to go missing on both source and destination pages. Due to the timing required to reproduce this condition, this tends to affect larger page trees which are being copied/moved simultaneously\r\n\u00a0\r\nh3. Steps to reproduce:\r\n # Create a page with subpages and few attachments.\u00a0\r\n # Click on \"...\" and select Move page to another space.\r\n # Immediately click <- (Back) on the browser\u00a0or refresh the browser.\r\n # Now click \"...\" again and select Copy action on the same page.\r\n # Select to copy the page tree and choose a different destination from the move\r\n # Now check attachments on the\u00a0source and destination pages for the move and the copy actions\r\n\r\nh3. Expected behavior:\r\nConfluence should prevent running Copy action while Move action is in process and ideally inform the user in the UI of what's going on behind the scenes\r\n\u00a0\r\nh3. Actual behavior:\r\nCopy actions trigger\u00a0even when Move is already running. This causes many attachments to go missing from the\u00a0filesystem on both source and destination pages\r\n\r\nh4. Details:\r\nIn local testing, it appears that the page move will move the attachments to a new location on the filesystem. However, the page moves themselves will fail due to a copy being done at the same time. This results in the pages not being actually moved, but attachments are all moved (and can no longer be found in the UI).\r\n\r\nAt the same time, the copy tree is successful, but none of the physical attachments are copied over since they're now \"missing\" from the expected original places in the filesystem.\r\n\r\nFinally, the original source pages are now also missing attachments since they've been moved despite the move page action failing. Trying to access the attachments from various pages will lead to the following errors in the UI:\r\n\r\n!Null-pointer.png|thumbnail! !Attachment-not-found.png|thumbnail! ",

      "description": "h2. Summary\r\nThe steps to reproduce this problem is unknown. However, the Support team has observed that in multiple customer environments, page restrictions can get into a state which prevents all users from viewing/editing a page (except site admins in the \"confluence-administrators\" group). An examination of the database confirms that the page contains a restriction, but no user or group is named to be part of that restriction. This effectively blocks *all* users from viewing or editing the page.\r\n\r\nh2. Symptoms from the UI\r\nA red lock appears at the top of the affected page, indicating that there is some sort of page restriction. However, when clicking on the lock, the restrictions dialog appear blank and says that there are no page restrictions\r\n\r\nh2. Diagnosis via the database\r\nThe *CONTENT_PERM_SET* table will contain a row which references on the affected page, indicating a View and/or Edit restriction is indeed on the page. This causes the red lock to appear in the UI. However, there is no corresponding row in the *CONTENT_PERM* table, which keeps track of which users/groups are applied to the restrictions in the first table. This causes the restrictions dialog to come up blank.\r\n\r\nIn short, the bug is that there is a row in CONTENT_PERM_SET which locks down the page, but no corresponding row in CONTENT_PERM to complete that restriction.\r\n\r\nh2. Workaround\r\n# The following query can be used to identify pages affected by this condition:\r\n{code}\r\nSELECT c.contentid, c.title\r\nFROM CONTENT_PERM_SET cps\r\nJOIN CONTENT c\r\n  ON cps.content_id = c.contentid\r\nWHERE cps.id NOT IN (\r\n  SELECT cps_id\r\n  FROM CONTENT_PERM )\r\nGROUP BY c.contentid, c.title;\r\n{code}\r\n# Using a site admin/super user (i.e. someone in the \"confluence-administrators\" group), visit the pages returned by the above query\r\n# Explicitly add a View restriction and save. This has the effect of overwriting the bad data with an actual page restriction.\r\n# Finally, remove the View restriction and save. The page will now be unlocked",
