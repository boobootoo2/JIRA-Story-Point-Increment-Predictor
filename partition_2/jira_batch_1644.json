Please see that ticket instead.\r\n\r\nIn some cases, it is legitimate for the message \"Unknown attachment\" to appear. For example:\r\n\r\n* If you upload an attachment to a page and then delete it from the attachments list without removing the macro which references it, the macro will show \"Unknown attachment\".\r\n* If you upload an attachment on Page-A and then reference it in a macro on Page-B, then delete the original Page-A, then the attachment will also be deleted. This causes the Page-B macro to display \"Unknown attachment\"\r\n\r\nIf you observed \"unknown attachment\" after one of these scenarios, this is not a bug, but rather expected behaviour.\r\n\r\nIf you observed \"unknown attachment\" by any other scenario, it is likely a bug. If you find a way to reproduce this issue, please let us know by commenting below, with details of how to reproduce the issue and your version of confluence. If you observe something different than an \"unknown attachment\" message but attachments do fail to download, please let us know exactly what you see. If you observe this issue but are not on and have never been on Confluence 5.8.16 or 5.8.17, please let us know below.\r\n\r\nIf you observe this issue you may try resolving the broken attachments using the same instructions outlined in CONF-39975 - let us know if it works or not for you.",

These templates are changed several times each year to accommodate new needs. This request is to be able to set these templates in Confluence, like the Global templates, but be able to consume them in the blueprint configuration. This allows non-developers to update the templates without developer's intervention and without needing a plugin redeployment. This request applies to space and page blueprints. \r\n\r\nIt is important to state that we do not want to have these templates made available as global templates but be made available to and be consumed by a blueprint.\r\n",

In most of the cases, responisiblity changes or persons come and go. In other cases, pages are created by our support, due to complex imports or similar actions.  \r\n\r\nThe impact of page ownership is massive, as you know. We struggle with the archiving plugin for ex, which tends to produce spam to all contributors, if it is not the author who is to be notified.  \r\n\r\nBy now, the only supported workaround is recreating the page and moving all subpages, which is complicated and has many  drawbacks (linking for ex). \r\n\r\nIt would be very helpful if changing the owner of a page could be a simple task for confluence-administrators, space-admins and the current owners of the pages. \r\n\r\nI thank you in advance for your consideration.\r\n\r\nBest wishes\r\n\r\nMatin\r\n",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFCLOUD-41014].\n  {panel}\n\nThis wouldn't often be recommended, but these values can be altered to trade off the potential for data integrity issues in favour of uptime, or vice versa.\r\n\r\nTo set the Hazelcast heartbeat to 60s (for example): Add the JVM parameter {{-Dconfluence.cluster.hazelcast.max.no.heartbeat.seconds=60}}\r\n\r\nTo modify the Cluster Safety interval or disable the job entirely: {{Admin > Scheduled jobs}}\r\n\r\nh3. How these two settings operate\r\nHazelcast is Confluence's distributed caching mechanism. Data will be stored in the cache on one node only, and when other nodes want that data, they contact the node that has it. If no node has it, they query the database. Hazelcast controls the cluster membership. If a node has not communicated with the other nodes in the cluster for the heartbeat period (30s by default), the other nodes will remove it from the cluster. It will then not be able to contact the shared cache until it has successfully rejoined the cluster.\r\n\r\n[Cluster safety|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/CONFKB/Recovering+from+a+Data+Center+cluster+split-brain] is a scheduled job that runs on each node in a cluster, every 30s by default. It compares a number in Hazelcast's cache to a number in the database. If the numbers differ, the node will throw a panic event and stop processing. It is intended to ensure that all nodes that are able to communicate with the database, are also communicating with Hazelcast's shared cache, to avoid writing out of date data to the database, and overwriting more recent edits.\r\n\r\nh3. Some example configurations\r\nh5. Uptime over data integrity\r\n* Change both to 1 minute - this would mean you could have network interruptions or GC pauses up to 1 minute without triggering cluster panics. However, in the rare case that two nodes are no longer communicating, there would be a maximum of a 1 minute interval where the data on each node may be out of sync, and this could cause conflicting data to be written to the database.\r\n* Leaving the hazelcast timeout at 30 seconds and cluster safety to 10 minutes would allow nodes to be evicted from and rejoin the cluster (eg after a 30s GC or network blip), without a cluster panic occurring. This would mean that the cluster could potentially operate in a 'split brain' scenario where the nodes do not rejoin, for up to 10 minutes before throwing a panic. However, it would give evicted nodes a lot more time to rejoin the cluster gracefully after eviction.\r\n\r\nh5. Data integrity over uptime\r\n* Change both to 15 seconds - this sacrifices uptime for more confidence around data integrity. It means a maximum of 15 seconds where nodes could be out of communication with each other and still writing to the database. It could mean that GCs and network blips over 15 seconds will trigger a cluster panic, so you would run the risk of having more outages.\r\n* Change the hazelcast timeout to 1 minute and the cluster safety job to 15 seconds - this would mean GCs etc could run for up to 1 minute without nodes being evicted from the cluster. However, once they are evicted, the time they could potentially write to the database is lowered to 15 seconds.",

      "description": "h3. Summary\r\nThe addition of the index {{c_status_idx}} on the column {{content_status}} in the Table {{CONTENT}} in Confluence 5.8 and 5.9 causes content index administration (rebuilding the Content Index) to be come dramatically slower than previous indexing. Clients experiencing this issue will see as much as a 10x slower speed in overall content index administration. This does not now appear to be solely related to Oracle, thus the need to *update* this issue.\r\n\r\nWhen Confluence is running on *any database*, query speed from the above SQL query can return up to 10x slower when using this table index, which causes overall Confluence search index rebuild speed to become dramatically slower. In one observed Confluence instance with 8 million pieces of content (1.5 million of which is current), the search index rebuild time went from 4 hours in Confluence 5.7 to 30+ hours in 5.8 when running Oracle. In an instance running Microsoft SQL Server with Confluence 5.9.x, the indexing went from 3 to 4 hours up to 9 to 12 hours. In another instance running PostgreSQL, the indexing went from 3 hours to 8 to 10 hours. Similar reports have been made about MySQL, and given the facts of the index's low cardinality (only two possible values exist: current or deleted), it would make sense to remove this index to improve performance.\r\n\r\nh3. Environments\r\nConfirmed in Microsoft SQL Server and Oracle databases. Not confirmed yet for PostgreSQL, not confirmed in MySQL, though there are numerous slow indexing issues in MySQL.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\nAny Confluence instance with content _at scale_ is likely to experience this issue on Confluence 5.8 or 5.9. An instance with more than 250000 pages should be sufficient to expose the issue\r\n# Build an instance at scale with 250,000 pages and deploy on Confluence 5.7.4 or greater\r\n# Rebuild the Content Index using the UI\r\n# Observe the time to index\r\n# Upgrade the instance to Confluence 5.9\r\n# Rebuild the Content Index using the UI\r\n# Observe the much slower time to index the content\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nI would expect no difference to indexing performance at a minimum, and with the improved performance of the application, I would expect performance to include improvements in indexing speed.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nThe indexing is actually much slower, causing much frustration on the part of clients, as the index rebuild is far _*slower*_ than it was before the upgrade to Confluence. \r\n\r\nh3. Notes\r\nIn Confluence 5.8, a table index was added onto the {{content_status}} column of the {{CONTENT}} table called {{c_status_idx}}. This index is used in the following SQL query frequently when Confluence's search index is being rebuilt:\r\n{code:sql}\r\nselect confluence1_.user_key as user_key0_, confluence1_.user_key as user_key1_, confluence1_.username as username0_, confluence1_.lower_username as lower_us3_0_, confluence1_.username as username1_, confluence1_.lower_username as lower_us3_1_, contentent0_.CONTENTID as x0_0_, contentent0_.VERSION as x1_0_, confluence1_.user_key as x2_0_, contentent0_.LASTMODDATE as x3_0_, contentent0_.VERSIONCOMMENT as x4_0_ from CONTENT contentent0_ left outer join user_mapping confluence1_ on contentent0_.LASTMODIFIER=confluence1_.user_key where (contentent0_.PREVVER=? )or(contentent0_.CONTENTID=? )and(contentent0_.CONTENT_STATUS='current' ) order by  contentent0_.VERSION desc\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nParticularly, it is due to this section of the query, which was not present during index rebuild for the 5.7 or prior Confluence versions:\r\n{code}\r\ncontentent0_.CONTENT_STATUS='current' \r\n{code}\r\n\r\nWe know that the table index is at play, because if we give a [NO_INDEX|https://docs.oracle.com/cd/B12037_01/server.101/b10752/hintsref.htm#29911] hint to Oracle while running the above query, which explicitly asks the DB not to use the index on {{c_status_idx}}, the results return very swiftly, e.g.:\r\n{code:sql}\r\nselect /*+ NO_INDEX(contentent0_ c_status_idx) */ confluence1_.user_key as user_key0_, confluence1_.user_key as user_key1_, confluence1_.username as username0_, confluence1_.lower_username as lower_us3_0_, confluence1_.username as username1_, confluence1_.lower_username as lower_us3_1_, contentent0_.CONTENTID as x0_0_, contentent0_.VERSION as x1_0_, confluence1_.user_key as x2_0_, contentent0_.LASTMODDATE as x3_0_, contentent0_.VERSIONCOMMENT as x4_0_ from CONTENT contentent0_ left outer join user_mapping confluence1_ on contentent0_.LASTMODIFIER=confluence1_.user_key where (contentent0_.PREVVER=949 )or(contentent0_.CONTENTID=949 )and(contentent0_.CONTENT_STATUS='current' ) order by  contentent0_.VERSION desc\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nThe column \"content_status\" is responsible for tracking whether a page is current, or deleted and sitting in a Space's trash. There are only two possible values for this column: \"current\" or \"deleted\". Due to the low cardinality, and that the vast majority of the values are \"current\", it may not make sense that we have a b-tree table index on this column (especially if it can negatively impact performance).\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n(!) *PLEASE READ*:  It is recommended  that you follow best practices for Change Management and will *test and validate* these settings in a Test/Development and Staging environment *prior to* rolling any changes into a Production environment. You *must* test and validate these changes to insure that they will function will within your infrastructure prior to placing these changes in production.\r\n\r\nIf you suspect that you are impacted by this issue, you should test and evaluate dropping the index on the {{content_status}} column of the {{CONTENT}} table in a Test or development instance, then test the search index rebuild speed. You may need to restart your instance *before* you retest the Content Index Rebuild to verify the performance improvement.",

Summary\r\nWhen a page has one macro within another macro, let's say a Warning macro within an Info macro, and at least 2 users are editing this page at the same time, and both users save the page, the macro within breaks after the second user saves the page, see screenshot.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Create a page\r\n# Add an Info macro and within the Info macro add a Warning macro\r\n# Save the page\r\n# With one user, edit the page\r\n# Access this page with another user and also edit the page\r\n# While both users are editing the page at the same time the first user saves the page, and the second user also saves the page right after\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nAfter the second user saves the page, the macro within the other macro, on this case the Warning macro, should still be viewable\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nThe macro within the other macro breaks. A message saying \"Broken macro\" is displayed\r\n \r\nh3. Notes\r\nThere's no need for both users to save the page at the exact same time (instantaneously).\r\n\r\nh3.Workaround\r\nAs a workaround, when a User edits the problem page, the user can add an edit restriction for the page and restrict editing to themselves. This restoration will need to be removed after editing the page. This is a rather tedious workaround, but it will prevent the issue until the problem is resolved.\r\n\r\n*NB: In the unlikely event that anyone experiences this issue post 5.10.4, it is because the macros were entered on the page some time ago, before macro ids were used. If this does occur, the workaround is to revert to the old version, then save the page (ensuring no one else is editing it at the same time). Once a single-session save has occurred, the macro will have an id, and the problem will be solved for that page forever.*",

But the correct shortcut is \"M\u00e4r\". So they have to change the field every time.\r\n\r\nOne workaround is to create issues in JIRA directly, then date picker sets \"M\u00e4r\" or to chose english language settings. Then date picker sets \"Mar\".\r\nBut using date picker with issue collector and german settings does it wrong.\r\n\r\nIs this a confluence or jira bug?

After a clean install of Confluence there is only the confluence.cfg.xml file, but that does not yet contain the XML for any database.\r\n\r\nWith a similar config script it would be easy to fill in the details for my particular case. Alternatively there could be commented out sections in the XML config that would clearly show what needs to be added.\r\n\r\nAlso on the website the instructions on server migration is not clear with regards to using an existing database with a fresh install.

      "description": "Currently, email notifications are properly blocked by permissions checks in two differing scenarios, but are throwing an ERROR in the Confluence logs. This adds a level of Noise to the logging which is not necessary. Ideally, the ERROR message would not exist, as the application is behaving correctly and does not send the email notification. The issue is that it throws an ERROR message when none should occur in the instance.\r\n\r\nh4. Scenario One\r\n# In the first case, 'User A' is granted access to a Space and allowed to add a watch on the entire 'Q' space.\r\n# After the user has an established watch, 'Space Admin B' restricts the users that can see the s'Q' space.\r\n# 'User A' is no longer allowed to view or access the 'Q' space.\r\n# Another user - let's say 'User C', updates the 'Q' space - whether adding an attachment, editing a page or making a blogpost in the instance.\r\n# Confluence then attempts to send an email notification to 'User A' - and this is properly denied, but the application also throws an ERROR message in the logs, when in reality, the application has not incurred an ERROR, as the application properly did not send due to the page restrictions in place. \r\n\r\nh4. Scenario Two\r\n# 'User A' has a Space watch on 'X' Space\r\n# 'Space Admin B' restricts a single page or set of pages in 'X' space\r\n# Users update the restricted page(s), adding content, attachments and making comments\r\n# Confluence then attempts to send an email notification to 'User A' - and this is properly denied, but the application also throws an ERROR message in the logs, when in reality, the application has not incurred an ERROR, as the application properly did not send due to the page restrictions in place. \r\n\r\nh4. Functional Impact\r\nIn a large, enterprise-scale environment, Operations Teams must investigate the ERROR messages and this adds to their workload. This causes extra work for Confluence Administrators when grepping their logs for signs of trouble, as the message is shown as an ERROR. This causes confusion and extra noise in the logs.\r\n\r\nClients have reported that they would prefer for the message not to be thrown as an ERROR in the instance, as the system is properly denying the outbound notification based upon the settings of the page permissions. Therefore, it is not able to send due to the inherent page permission restrictions, and is not truly an ERROR, but is acting correctly based on the permissions. It is desired that the page permissions check occur, and if the permissions do not allow notification, simply do not send without logging an improper ERROR message and stack trace to reduce the noise in logs.\r\n\r\nh4. Desired Change\r\nCheck permissions for user prior to sending email. Bail out if email notification is not authorized for the content that has been changed.\r\n",

Our entire user staff does not have a need to have \"can use\" functionality for Confluence, so this change now limits what is displayed to our end users which is currently only a handful of users.\r\n\r\nPrior to this change we would utilize ConfiForms with a \"User\" field definition in order for our IT/Management team to log events relating to company staff (Again, not all staff have/need \"Can Use\" functionality).  Using this field type was a big benefit as it allowed us to tie into Active Directory to ensure names are typed correctly, as well as pulling in additional info if needed (Photos, e-mail addresses, phone #'s and etc).  This change eliminated this functionality as not all users were displayed, so we had to change this to a text field which limits functionality.",

Confluence is behind a corporate reverse proxy (from BlueCoat) which has caching enabled but respects the Cache-control, Expire and Pragma HTTP headers.\r\n\r\nh3. Problem\r\n\r\nWe have discovered following cases of sessions mix up where a user \\[1] get the Crowd token cookie value from another user \\[2] and then user \\[1] can make actions in Confluence as if logged in with user \\[2] credentials.\r\n\r\nh3. Details\r\n\r\nAfter some investigation, we discovered that Confluence, if\r\n\r\n# a user with no Confluence session\r\n# with a valid Crowd session\r\n# tries to get some Confluence pages\r\n# will get Confluence responses which have:\r\n\r\n* no Cache-Control headers\r\n* have Set-Cookie: crowd.token_key headers\r\n\r\nThis behavior is dangerous as some Confluence resources can be cached by the upstream reverse proxy with Set-Cookie headers; and they can be served as cached data to other users.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nOn the reverse proxy, disabling caching completely or selectively on responses containing Set-Cookie headers\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Real fix\r\n\r\nConfluence setting Cache-Control header whenever Confluence sends Set-Cookie headers\r\n\r\nSame as BSERV-8483, JRA-60043, BAM-17294",
