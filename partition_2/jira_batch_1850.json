[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFCLOUD-13928].\n  {panel}\n\nAs a project manager, I often use Confluence for documenting requirements. When we create requirements in JIRA, I always use the jiraissues macro to easily display issues and their progress to the customer together with the original requirements. Then it is always easy to go to JIRA and se more details on the relvant issues. But when you are looking at an issue in JIRA, there could be several other pages in Confluence with relevant info and requirements displaying the issue in a jiraissues macro list. All those pages could send a trackback ping to JIRA, it would also be easy to see all pages relating to the isse, securing that important requirements are not missed. Today, it is as far as I have found out, only possible to get the trackback ping from Condluence to JIRA if you \"hard code\" the issue key in the Condluence page.\r\n\r\nThis would gratly improve Confluence and JIRA for managing large sets of requirements for large projects.",

      "description": "Hello,\r\n\r\nThe mail.jar distributed with JavaMail API 1.4 does not contain sun.mail.pop3.POP3Message that is referenced in Confluence 2.10 source. At my company we use internal Maven proxy when compiling Confluence, which uses Atlassian Maven repository as a remote backend, but it also contains some 3rd party stuff such as the JavaMail API so no local deployment is necessary. We have version 1.4.1 of the javax.mail.mail installed. In confluence-2.10-source/confluence-project/confluence/pom.xml the following dependency is defined:\r\n\r\n        <dependency>\r\n            <groupId>javax.mail</groupId>\r\n            <artifactId>mail</artifactId>\r\n        </dependency>\r\n\r\nSince no version is specified, Maven picks up the latest version of the artifact in can find, and in this case it's 1.4.1. Since there's no sun.mail.pop3.POP3Message class in the jar, Confluence compilation will fail. I patched the pom.xml like this:\r\n\r\n        <dependency>\r\n            <groupId>javax.mail</groupId>\r\n            <artifactId>mail</artifactId>\r\n            <version>1.3.3</version>\r\n        </dependency>\r\n\r\nAnd now it picks up the version 1.3.3 which is also installed on our local repository and this version contains POP3Message class. Now Confluence is built successfully. I think it would be great if Confluence was shipped with a pom.xml that refers to known working version of the 1.3.x series of Java MailApi by default. http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Building+Confluence+From+Source+Code would need updating, though, instead of referring to version 1.x.x you should use the exactly same version there as what's defined in the POM.",

      "description": "*Symptoms*\r\n\r\nThe problem appears to be that a plugin is somehow disabled after a Confluence instance is restarted. If you look through the logs you'll find something like:\r\n\r\n{code}\r\nWARN ... [com.atlassian.plugin.DefaultPluginManager] isPluginEnabled Plugin com.atlassian.confluence.extra.widgetconnector is out of sync with the plugin system, disabling\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nIf you look at the access logs for the same time, you should find that someone was administering that plugin either via the Plugins or Plugin Repository admin areas. \r\n\r\nYou might also see messages in the main log of the form:\r\n\r\n{code}\r\nERROR ... [atlassian.renderer.v2.V2Renderer] render Unable to render content due to system error: Cannot retrieve plugin module before it is enabled: PluginModuleHolder[com.atlassian.confluence.extra.widgetconnector.WidgetMacro@3c6957]\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nwhen users make subsequent calls to pages that use the plugin. Note that the plugin might still appear enabled after the time of the first log message, but it will be disabled after a Confluence restart.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Cause*\r\n\r\nThere is a known issue with the Atlassian Plugin framework ([PLUG-222|https://studio.atlassian.com/browse/PLUG-222]) where, if a plugin's \"enabled\" state is queried in one thread while it is being changed in another (due to an upgrade, uninstall/reinstall or disable/enable) the plugin's state will be set to \"disabled\". However, this state may not be getting checked until Confluence is restarted because a subclass of DefaultPluginManager, ConfluencePluginManager, stores the enabled state separately.\r\n\r\nPlugin state can be checked very frequently, depending on the cache, so the problem can be caused by almost any usage of Confluence during the small window of plugin state change (typically less than a second).\r\n \r\nThe fix for the problem will involve a change to the Plugin framework code to \"lock\" the plugin's state while it is being administered, and most likely a reworking of the ConfluencePluginManager code to better synchronize the state.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Workaround*\r\n\r\nThe problem arises because the plugin is being accessed while it's being altered and will not occur during everyday usage. To re-enable an incorrectly-disabled plugin, simply enable the plugin when no-one is using Confluence, and check the logs to confirm that the above warning message doesn't re-appear.",

      "description": "{panel:bgColor=#e7f4fa}\n  *NOTE:* This suggestion is for *Confluence Server*. Using *Confluence Cloud*? [See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFCLOUD-13878].\n  {panel}\n\nGuys there is an opportunity for you to ensure that Confluence can run as a service on 64 bit Windows. All you need to do is distribute the 64 bit versions of the Tomcat binaries which can be downloaded from [Apache SVN repository|http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/tomcat/tc6.0.x/tags/TOMCAT_6_0_14/res/procrun/amd64/] (this link is for the binaries that are to be distributed with the Tomcat version for 2.10 RC1).\r\n\r\nThe procedure is simple - have a read of the comment I made in [JRA-12965|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRA-12965?focusedCommentId=136318&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#action_136318]. I have been running 2.9.2 on 64 bit Windows Server 2003 for several weeks now without issue and of course the beauty of this is that I have been able to allocate a significant amount of memory to the JVM (viz. 512m of PermGen memory and 4G for the heap - considering of course that I have 8GB of physical memory installed). Of course I am successfully running 2.10 on a 64 bit Windows Server 2008 staging box.",

We'd love to hear your thoughts!\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nMarek Radochonski\r\n Senior Product Manager\r\n [mradochonski@atlassian.com|mailto:mradochonski@atlassian.com]\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\n\r\nOpenID is a great way to avoid forcing people to remember yet another login/password and means we wouldn't have to worry about people forgetting their passwords etc. More and more sites are using it and a lot of people already have one via another service (eg Yahoo!, Flickr, etc.)\r\n\r\nThere is a bogpost about confluence support of OpenID here: http://blogs.atlassian.com/developer/2007/02/_with_the_recent_press.html\r\n\r\nOpenID support would be great for confluence instance that allow registration/login of public users. This support should also be integrated with confluence instances that delegate logins to crowd.",
