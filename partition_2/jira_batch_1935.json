We've tried to upgrade, but the process repeatedly bombs, and suspect that this is something to do with corruption in our HSQL database.\nWe'd like to move over to the current 1.4.1 version, using MySQL (hopefully MySQL- but if we have to use another DB we're open to that) running on a separate Linux machine.\n\nMy questions:\n1) does the diagnosis of some kind of corruption in the db make sense- have other people had this problem of frequent (every 1-3d) crashes? Or is it likely to be something else?\n2) what is the best approach for this kind of installation-  install over the top, or to create a new instance and then transfer data?\n3) is there any way to bring data over from HSQL in to MySQL? (apart from spending a long night copying and pasting pages manually)\n\nthanks\n\nBen",

We have roughly four frequent users of this system and half a dozen casual users at present. Notice too from the screen shots the 241 sessions the Confluence context was hanging on to. This should have been about 4 sessions with our standard timeout settings.\n\nOnce I used the Tomcat manager to stop the Confluence context everything dropped to normal with CPU usage down to ~0.05% and sessions dissappearing from the Tomcat manager.\n\nI've noticed too that doing a reload of the Confluence context in Tomcat sometimes causes an 'out of memory' exception meaning Tomcat  is likely not letting go of everything it should.\n\nThe unusually high number of sessions noted in the Tomcat manager screenshot seems to at least be one starting point.\n\nAny advice on why CPU and memory usage is so high? Are there any known memory leaks?   \n\nIt is possible these are Tomcat issues and not Confluence issues. Are 'high usage' sites (such as Atlassian) finding you have to stop / start the context regularly?",

Now things brings additional complexity because you now have to worry about what version you want to download (which can be specific for each)\n** I sugges that we put check boxes in front of each attachment with the ability to select all or individual and a download button (design on the fly here) \nThen the user would get to select a version for each attachment they have selected or stick to the defaults of the most current version.\n\nYou could also use this method to delete versions of attachments (i saw this request in another issue)",
