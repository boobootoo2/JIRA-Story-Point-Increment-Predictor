Support for APP would provide our enterprise developers with a single target API to learn and write to, regardless of the content platform.

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFCLOUD-11766].\n  {panel}\n\nThe tanuki wrapper used for the 2.8.0 installer produces some additional logging when the application is run in a terminal. A customer has raised a good point of this logging flooding the screen and potentially hiding and nasty errors that could appear - the errors would only really be noticed if they periodically check the logs or Confluence itself crashes. Example of the ping request and response, sent every few seconds:\r\n\r\n{noformat}\r\nINFO   | jvm 1    | 2008/04/28 20:08:05 | Received a packet PING : ping\r\nINFO   | jvm 1    | 2008/04/28 20:08:05 | Send a packet PING : ok\r\nDEBUG  | wrapperp | 2008/04/28 20:08:05 | read a packet PING : ok\r\nDEBUG  | wrapper  | 2008/04/28 20:08:05 | Got ping response from JVM\r\nDEBUG  | wrapperp | 2008/04/28 20:08:09 | send a packet PING : ping\r\nINFO   | jvm 1    | 2008/04/28 20:08:09 | Received a packet PING : ping\r\nINFO   | jvm 1    | 2008/04/28 20:08:09 | Send a packet PING : ok\r\nDEBUG  | wrapperp | 2008/04/28 20:08:09 | read a packet PING : ok\r\nDEBUG  | wrapper  | 2008/04/28 20:08:09 | Got ping response from JVM\r\nDEBUG  | wrapperp | 2008/04/28 20:08:13 | send a packet PING : ping\r\nINFO   | jvm 1    | 2008/04/28 20:08:13 | Received a packet PING : ping\r\nINFO   | jvm 1    | 2008/04/28 20:08:13 | Send a packet PING : ok\r\nDEBUG  | wrapperp | 2008/04/28 20:08:13 | read a packet PING : ok\r\nDEBUG  | wrapper  | 2008/04/28 20:08:13 | Got ping response from JVM\r\nDEBUG  | wrapperp | 2008/04/28 20:08:17 | send a packet PING : ping\r\nINFO   | jvm 1    | 2008/04/28 20:08:18 | Received a packet PING : ping\r\nINFO   | jvm 1    | 2008/04/28 20:08:18 | Send a packet PING : ok\r\nDEBUG  | wrapperp | 2008/04/28 20:08:18 | read a packet PING : ok\r\nDEBUG  | wrapper  | 2008/04/28 20:08:18 | Got ping response from JVM\r\nDEBUG  | wrapperp | 2008/04/28 20:08:22 | send a packet PING : ping\r\nINFO   | jvm 1    | 2008/04/28 20:08:22 | Received a packet PING : ping\r\nINFO   | jvm 1    | 2008/04/28 20:08:22 | Send a packet PING : ok\r\nDEBUG  | wrapperp | 2008/04/28 20:08:22 | read a packet PING : ok\r\nDEBUG  | wrapper  | 2008/04/28 20:08:22 | Got ping response from JVM\r\nDEBUG  | wrapperp | 2008/04/28 20:08:26 | send a packet PING : ping\r\nINFO   | jvm 1    | 2008/04/28 20:08:26 | Received a packet PING : ping\r\nINFO   | jvm 1    | 2008/04/28 20:08:26 | Send a packet PING : ok\r\nDEBUG  | wrapperp | 2008/04/28 20:08:26 | read a packet PING : ok\r\nDEBUG  | wrapper  | 2008/04/28 20:08:26 | Got ping response from JVM\r\nDEBUG  | wrapperp | 2008/04/28 20:08:30 | send a packet PING : ping\r\nINFO   | jvm 1    | 2008/04/28 20:08:30 | Received a packet PING : ping\r\nINFO   | jvm 1    | 2008/04/28 20:08:30 | Send a packet PING : ok\r\nDEBUG  | wrapperp | 2008/04/28 20:08:30 | read a packet PING : ok\r\nDEBUG  | wrapper  | 2008/04/28 20:08:30 | Got ping response from JVM\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nIt would be handy if there was an option to disable this logging so it doesn't clutter the terminal.",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFCLOUD-11758].\n  {panel}\n\nOriginally created as request for metadata plugin enhancement and the developer suggested I request this from confluence instead.\r\n\r\nWe use confluence and metadata for more detailed planning and collaboration of issues that we track in Jira. It would be very nice to have metadata fields in the wiki captured from jira fields from the related issue in Jira. For example, I have an issue in Jira with a priority number attached to it. In the wiki I would want to define a piece of metadata such as: {metadata-jira:Priority}PM-32{metadata-jira}\r\n\r\nand this would resolve the metadata to the priority field for the issue PM-32 in my configured Jira instance. I would then be able to reference this piece of metadata in metadata reports and charts.\r\n\r\nHi Ken,\r\n\r\nI don't want to add JIRA support to the Metadata Plugin, because that opens the floodgates to similar integration requests with other applications out there. Instead I suggest that you request that Confluence create a new JIRA macro that can give you back data about any project. You can then use this macro as metadata as you describe.\r\n\r\ne.g something like:\r\n{metadata-value:Priority}{jira-value:priority|issue=PM-32}{metadata-value}\r\n\r\nNote that this requires that the jira-value macro knows how to access your JIRA instance. For example, the jira-issues macro requires that you pass that information every time. Anyway, that is something for the Confluence and JIRA teams to agree upon.\r\n\r\nIf you agree with this approach, then I will close this issue.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\n    * Andy\r\n",
