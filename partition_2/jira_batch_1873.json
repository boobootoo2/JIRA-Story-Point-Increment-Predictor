Cause\r\n\r\nIt appears that the upgrade task may remove space permission records which are used by the HibernateSpacePermissionDao to correctly associate permissions to users. This occurs because the upgrade task is designed to consolidate permissions assigned to users which only vary by the case of the user name. Unfortunately the permission dao performs a case sensitive lookup against permissions and it is possible that the lookup will no longer match the correct records. The upgrade task is not particular with which record it deletes when consolidating the permissions.\r\n\r\nh2. Resolution\r\n\r\nThe attached class should allow the space permission lookup to find the permissions by performing a case insensitive lookup against the space permission table. We may need to look at a different approach to mitigating this problem in a future release of Confluence (e.g. a fix to the upgrade task perhaps)\r\n\r\nTo install this patch, shut down Confluence, make the necessary directories and copy the class to {{confluence_installation/WEB-INF/classes/com/atlassian/confluence/security/persistence/dao/hibernate/HibernateSpacePermissionDao.class}}\r\n\r\nPermissioning should work correctly once Confluence is restarted.\r\n\r\n",

But, pages that start with special characters or numbers don't have a place, so they aren't included.

The current command I am using for a tab named 'R1 Schedule' is\r\n \r\n{calendar:id=R1Schedule\\|title=CCIE Rack 1 Schedule}\r\n \r\nI would like to have the same exact layout and options except for one slight difference. When one adds an event, I would like the time frame to be limited. Normal users are to only be able to add an event from the current day, up to a maximum of 14 days\r\n \r\nFor example. If I come to add an event, I can only add an event for today, and not a future day. Also, there would be a drop down box that allows me to select the numbers of days I would be scheduling the event for.  ie. 1, 2, 3, ..., 6, 7     and possibly have the drop down box up to 14 days.\r\n \r\nAn example of some code I have viewed from a website I have seen is:\r\n\r\n<select name=\"daysneeded\" onChange=\"addDays(this.options[this.options.selectedIndex].value)\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<option value=\"initial\">initial</option>\r\n\t\t\t\t</select>\r\n\r\nThis creates a drop down box with preset values; the values I need are from 1 up to 14 days. The header above that drop down box is \"Days Needed\"\r\n\r\nLastly, I also need to allow an administrator to be able to add events at any time, current or future. This is for reservation purposes.\r\n \r\nI appreciate your time and help.",

Connect Confluence and JIRA to the LDAP repository. JIRA for authentication only via OSUser, Confluence via Atlassian-User.\r\n3. Set up a local user for 'bob' in JIRA, which must be lowercase because all JIRA usernames must be lowercase.\r\n4. Log in to Confluence as 'bob' (or 'BOB', it doesn't matter). Confluence creates the user as 'BOB', because it respects the case of the underlying system.\r\n5. Use an authenticated \\{jiraissues} macro to retrieve issues from JIRA as 'BOB'.\r\n6. The above error message appears in the JIRA log, which can't authenticate 'BOB'.\r\n\r\nI'm opening this issue in Confluence to start with, although perhaps in the end it will be fixed in JIRA.\r\n\r\nNote that the most common case for installations using trusted authentication is with an external user repository like LDAP, so this is a serious problem for the trusted authentication feature.\r\n",

It's proving to be a maintenance nightmare.\r\n\r\nAs an alternative, maybe you could add an optional syntax that would strip the space key, such as the following:\r\n\\[ENG::Home\\]\r\nwhich would indicate that the page creator does not want to display the space link.",

I hope to use the WIKI to publish a new engineering textbook on water treatment plant design. I have a wealth of drawings that I have created in PowerPoint. I don't want to have to recreate all of those drawings in Gliffy. The drawing objects must retain their vector based format so they can be edited in the WIKI. One possible solution is to add functionality to the Gliffy macro so it can accept clipboard contents of MS office drawings. \r\n\r\nImage based attachments are not acceptable because they would require also saving the original drawing in some other format and would require a multiple step process for any edits to the drawing. If the wiki can only display an image file, then any revision to that display would require first editing the original drawing object file, converting the drawing to an image, and then uploading that image file to the wiki.\r\n\r\nI rate this as a Major priority based on the suggested rating system. This is a major loss of function compared with the copy and paste functionality we have in other document creation environments.",
