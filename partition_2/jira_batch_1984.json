Issue Summary\r\n\r\nIf an anonymous user searches for something with content search API, and the query happens to get a hit on a user, the API returns a 403 error.\r\n\r\nExample of a search query that matches a user and returns 403: (open using fresh incognito window):\r\n[https://refined.atlassian.net/wiki/rest/api/search?cql=title%20~%20%22emil%22%20]\r\n\r\nBut if the anonymous user's search query does NOT have a user match in the result set, it returns the API results successfully (200)\r\n\r\nExample of non-user matching search, returning 200 + results: (open using fresh incognito window):\r\n[https://refined.atlassian.net/wiki/rest/api/search?cql=title%20~%20\"partners\"%20\u00a0|https://refined.atlassian.net/wiki/rest/api/search?cql=title%20~%20%22partners%22%20]\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE: This bug report is about receiving a 403 on anonymous content search API calls whenever there's a user profile match on the query.

It is nice how we can easily copy and paste table content from a table into another one, which let the experience really great!\r\nThough, we have to take care when copying determined types of content between tables, like the header row from a table to another one, as this makes Confluence reads that the table where we pasted it as if it has two headers.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Create a page and insert a table;\r\n# On the table header, type *1*, *2*, and *3* on each of the header cells;\r\n# Create another table under the current one;\r\n# At the header, insert *A*, *B*, and *C*;\r\n# Add more 20 table rows;\r\n# On the first table, copy its header (select it all until the row gets blue and copy it);\r\n# Paste it on the 10th row of the second table;\r\n# Publish the page;\r\n# Edit it and scroll the second table.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nThe content from the copied row gets pasted as a regular row, not a header\r\n*OR*\r\nThe table supports multiple headers.\r\n\r\nh3.

This workaround must be applied every time we edit the page, as it is a momentaneously solution for each time you are editing the page.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nYou can also delete the pasted header row and manually add its content there, so the table will contain a single header and will work fine. \r\nIn order to identify which is the duplicated header, go to the affected page in the *view mode* and click over the *ellipses > Page Source* - navigate to the broken table and identify which table row has the text highlighted with a gray background-color - in case the entire row is grey, then it is probably also the second header.\r\n",

Then, do a new custom export on the temp space. \r\n* Alternatively, do a full export, then manually modify the export file to trim it down to the pages you want. For XML, you would have to skim through the whole file. For PDF, you would figure out which page numbers of the pages you want, then use PDF reader to print only those specific pages to a new PDF file. For Word, you would have to manually modify the Word file. Given the complexity, the first workaround is highly recommended",
