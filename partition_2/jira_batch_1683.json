It causes very heavy database access to insert the new token and delete the old one. It also cause the problem that we have so many stored tokens in database.

      "description": "When using Confluence Mobile, a user will navigate to a page and it will see a spinning loading page. This loading page will never finish. At this point flushing either {{Web Resource Keys And Condition State Set}} or {{Web Resource Keys Condition List}} and have the user reload the page. At this point it will load it successfully.\r\n\r\nAfter testing, we found this always occurs when a user looks at a Confluence page that does not have a note macro, followed by a page that has certain macros. It will always cause this issue.\r\n\r\nh3. Reproduction steps:\r\n# Install Confluence\r\n# Create a page\r\n## Give this page a title (Ex. Page 1)\r\n## Save it with no content\r\n# Create a second page\r\n## Give this page a title (Ex. Page 2)\r\n## Use the note macro to create a note, with any text in it (Ex. \"This is a note\")\r\n## Save this page\r\n# Force your browser to use the mobile interface by going to <base_url>/plugins/servlet/mobile#dashboard/\r\n# Open Page 1\r\n# Go back to the dashboard\r\n# Open Page 2\r\n# See the Loading Screen and wait for however long you would like (it will never finish loading)\r\n# Go to the Cache Statistics page (in another tab)\r\n# Flush either {{Web Resource Keys And Condition State Set}} or {{Web Resource Keys Condition List}}\r\n# Go back to the tab with the mobile interface, hit refresh, the page will load. \r\n\r\nh3. Expected behavior\r\nPage 2 loads, and you see the page with the note macro\r\n\r\nh3. Actual behavior\r\nPage 2 never loads, if you try to navigate to any other page (including back to the dashboard) it will still be stuck on the loading page. At this point, the cache needs to be flushed (either flush all, {{Web Resource Keys And Condition State Set}}, or {{Web Resource Keys Condition List}}.\r\n\r\nh3. Macros That Cause This Behavior\r\n* Table Of Contents\r\n* Children Display\r\n* Info\r\n* Code\r\n* Expand\r\n* Note\r\n\r\nh3. Macros That Do Not Cause This Behavior\r\n* Panel\r\n* Status\r\n\r\nh3. Related Notes\r\n* This can be worked around by either:\r\n** Removing all note macros from Confluence\r\n** Setting the {{Web Resource Keys Condition List}} cache to 1. This will slow down Confluence (as resources aren't cached) and occasionally you will encounter the loading screen but it will resolve itself.\r\n** Flushing the cache when a user complains that they get the loading screen\r\n* You can find a workaround at [Pages Stuck on Loading Screen When Using Confluence Mobile|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/CONFKB/Pages+Stuck+on+Loading+Screen+When+Using+Confluence+Mobile]",

Since CONNECTOR retrieve group membership using the LDAP synchronisation process, it is not necessary to retrieve the group membership during authentication process as well.\r\n\r\nBy forcing user membership retrieval during authentication process could cause performance issue during authentication process. Especially if customer is using SSL connection due to this [bug|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONF-35735]. This authentication performance issue will get worst if nested group membership is enabled.\r\n\r\n*Propose Solution*\r\n\r\nProvide an option for administrators to skip user membership retrieval during authentication in the directory configuration.

Right now we are testing agains the m22 version. We have some problems regarding the inline comments editor, the popup with the button does not show up when I highlight text. \r\n\r\nThe cause of this seems to be that the area the highlighter looks in is selected using $(\".wiki-content\").first(), whereas we render content in multiple containers with that class-name.\r\n\r\nWe had a similar problem with the jira issue creator in confluence 5.4, and we received a javascript snippet (which let us specify another selector) to fix it that time. Could we get a similar fix for this, or do you have any other suggestions?\r\n\r\nBest Regards,\r\nAndreas\r\nRefinedWiki",

Problem summary\r\nSince Confluence 5.4, it is possible create JIRA issues by highlighting text on a Confluence page. A dialog will pop-up over the highlighted text, with an option to create a comment from the quote, or to create an issue in JIRA.\r\n\r\nHowever, we've observed instances where the Create JIRA option is missing (but the comment-from-quote option is still there) seemingly intermittently, without explicit change to the system from users or administrators.\r\n\r\nh2. Troubleshooting\r\nThere can be more than one cause for this Create JIRA ticket option to not appear with text highlights:\r\n* The plugin {{Confluence and Jira Content Connector}} might be disabled\r\n* The plugin {{Page Highlight Actions}} might be disabled\r\n* The individual user might have the \"Show option panel when text is selected\" setting unchecked in {{Profile > Settings}}\r\n\r\nHowever, in the cases Support has observed, these avenues have already been explored. There are no errors in logs or in the UI, and the intermittent nature makes this issue particularly difficult to troubleshoot. The JIRA icon is simply missing when text is highlighted.\r\n\r\nh2. Steps to reproduce\r\nThis issue is intermittent, and we do not have clear steps to reproduce. However, the problem appears to be with the in-memory cache.\r\n\r\nh2. Workaround\r\nWe've found that the problem may be related to an in-memory cache store, and some customers have had success getting the functionality back by flushing the cache (via {{Confluence Admin > Cache Management (or Cache Statistics) > Flush all}}). Restarting Confluence may also restore the functionality.\r\n\r\nALSO:\r\nRunning a Content Index from Confluence administration >> Content indexing >> Rebuild, will clear this out.\r\n\r\n(!) Confluence Cloud instances will need to file a support request at https://support.atlassian.com to request we run this for you due to permission restrictions on both flushing cache and content indexing.",

Reasoning:\r\nWhen performing imports they can sometimes fail due to invalid characters in entities.xml. This requires manually stripping the characters (normally with a perl script) within the files and subsequently compressing them back. If the compression is done incorrectly (for example, a user compresses the containing directory and not the files themselves), the import then fails again due to being unable to find the exportDescriptor.properties file. This process (of fixing the entities.xml to remove invalid characters, compressing it, and then after it fails figuring out the correct way to compress the files) is extremely frustrating and time consuming for both customers and Atlassian Support.\r\n\r\nh3. Specific Improvements:\r\n- Strip invalid characters from entities.xml during import\r\n- Look for export descriptor.properties recursively in the backup file (and not just in the top level)\r\n",

Why do our Confluence users seem to be off by one.  Meaning we see 25 and it lists 25 but when we try to make changes to Confluence it seems to say we are over the limit.  We have purchased 50 more recently, but I wanted to have Attlassian take a look to see if I am missing something or why this seems to be off by one.  If you could take a look and advise what may have caused this would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nThank You,\r\nLester\r\nMobile Heartbeat\r\n",
