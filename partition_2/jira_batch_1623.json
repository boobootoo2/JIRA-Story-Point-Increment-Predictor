By being able to filter by this it means we can deal with outstanding issues easier. The current filter doesn't help us, unfortunately.\r\n\r\nThe filter just needs to be called something like 'Unresolved' or something. In fact the current filter doesn't make sense, the question might not be answered just because there's answers on the question, they have to be accepted in order to be a valid answer.\r\n\r\nIt would save us a huge ton of time and also make sure we deal with all customers appropriately.\r\n\r\nCheers",

And now we are in a loop where checking the view permission on the comment causes the body to be rendered again.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure how we ended up in this situation, because if you test on a clean/vanilla instance of Confluence Questions, new attachments are added to the parent question entity; I can't see any way in which attachments get associated with the comment entity - so in other CQ instances it seems that it would be difficult to trigger this behaviour.\r\n\r\nDespite this, there is still a logical flaw in the permission checking logic for comments which should be guarded against.  Now that comments have a rich text body, checking the permission on the comment should avoid performing a full render of its content.\r\n\r\n",

[See the corresponding bug report|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFCLOUD-46667].\n  {panel}\n\nIt looks like this bug has existed since we first forked OSQA.  The simplest way to describe this bug is with an example:\r\n\r\n{code}\r\n>>> ## Retrieve a Tag\r\n>>> tag = Tag.objects.get(name='a_tag')\r\n>>> ## Find all questions that are tagged with this Tag\r\n>>> Question.objects.filter_state(deleted=False).filter(tags__id=tag.id)\r\n[<Question: Some Question>]\r\n>>> ## Take the first question in this list as an example\r\n>>> q = Question.objects.filter_state(deleted=False).filter(tags__id=tag.id)[0]\r\n>>> q\r\n<Question: Some Question>\r\n>>> ## Try to access all the tags that this question has by traversing the ManyToManyField defined on the Node model\r\n>>> q.tags.all()\r\n[]\r\n>>> ## An empty list is returned - this is clearly incorrect. We already established that this question has the 'a_tag' tag, as that's how we retrieved it in the first place.\r\n>>> ## The tagnames field is set correctly, though.\r\n>>> q.tagnames\r\nu'a_tag jira another_tag\"\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nThis bug has existed since the beginnings of Answers, and is undoubtedly a root cause behind a lot of weirdness we actually see when trying to build model filters.\r\n\r\nThis has also resulted in a lot of hacks in the UI where the list of tags against a question is manually built by splitting the 'tagnames' field and retrieving each tag individually.  \r\n\r\nThe underlying cause of the problem is that we override the Django model Manager for all Node models, and set the {{use_for_related_fields}} setting to {True}.    This is contradictory to the recommendation in the Django docs, which says\\[1]:\r\n{quote}\r\nh2. Writing correct Managers for use in automatic Manager instances\r\n\r\nAs already suggested by the django.contrib.gis example, above, the use_for_related_fields feature is primarily for managers that need to return a custom QuerySet subclass. In providing this functionality in your manager, there are a couple of things to remember.\r\n\r\nh3. Do not filter away any results in this type of manager subclass\r\n\r\nOne reason an automatic manager is used is to access objects that are related to from some other model. In those situations, Django has to be able to see all the objects for the model it is fetching, so that anything which is referred to can be retrieved.\r\n\r\nIf you override the get_queryset() method and filter out any rows, Django will return incorrect results. Don\u2019t do that. A manager that filters results in get_queryset() is not appropriate for use as an automatic manager.\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\n\\[1]: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/db/managers/#manager-types\r\n\r\nOnce this fix is pushed, there is potentially some low-hanging fruit that could be picked to improve performance in Answers by changing all our tag manipulation code to use the {{tags}} field instead of the {{tagnames}} field.\r\n\r\n",

For example, I work at Zephyr, so have the following URL string as a saved tab when I open my browser: https://answers.atlassian.com/search/?sort=recent&q=Zephyr&t=question\r\n\r\nThe most recent entry that populates is from April 1.\r\n\r\nHowever the email triggers I have set continue to work fine, and my team can continue to pick up more recent entries like the following.\r\n\r\nhttps://answers.atlassian.com/questions/179777/can-we-change-the-image-for-test-cycles-folder?page=1#181506\r\n\r\nThe above doesn't appear in my search results, though I would expect it.\r\n\r\nChris",
