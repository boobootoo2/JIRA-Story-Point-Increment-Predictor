      "description": "Hi there,\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nBefore the latest update, there was a button in the Slack integration that was allowing for Slack users to see what changes were applied to the newly published version of a Confluence article.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThis functionality was highlighting all changes and you were able to follow up on the recent updates. Although the \"Page history\" button in Confluence still exists, the functionality is not the same. You can compare the versions but you can't see what exactly has been changed, which is a huge inconvenience if there are multiple people working on the same article or the article is contentful and a lot of changes were done.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n[Here|https://community.atlassian.com/t5/Confluence-questions/Did-quot-Page-history-quot-in-Confluence-lt-gt-Slack-app/qaq-p/1748953?utm_source=atlcomm&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=mentions_answer&utm_content=topic#U1751864] is the question I raised earlier this week.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nHristo\r\n\r\n\u00a0",

Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n# Create multiple pages using both Legacy and the current/new editors.\r\n# On these pages, add the [Page properties macro|https://support.atlassian.com/confluence-cloud/docs/insert-the-page-properties-macro/]\u00a0with a\u00a0common column between them.\r\n# In these columns, add a text and then, [insert a link to them|https://support.atlassian.com/confluence-cloud/docs/insert-links-and-anchors/]. For example, each column with different texts pointing to home pages of spaces, which will only have the \"space key\" as a difference.\r\n# Publish these pages and add a common label to them.\r\n# On a specific page, add the\u00a0[Page properties report macro|https://support.atlassian.com/confluence-cloud/docs/insert-the-page-properties-macro/]\u00a0and configure it to display the specific column and specific label.\r\n# Also on its configuration, add this column name on the\u00a0*Sort By*\u00a0field.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nThe sorting should be based on the alphabetical order of the texts, like the sorting function when tapping the column name.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nThe sorting will respect the content within the link to the page, ignoring the text used.\r\n\r\nWhen using only text, the legacy editor pages will be displayed at the bottom.\r\n\r\nh3.
