This is actually why there's a discrepancy.\r\n\r\nGoing further on this, we actually have a bunch of regex patterns in Sisyphus that match the same thing. e.g:\r\n\r\nCONF-13900 vs CONFKB394463234\r\nCONF-29000 vs CONFKB355369050\r\nCONFKB151519398 vs CONFKB331914082\r\nCONFKB217743871 vs CONFKB223217565\r\nCONFKB282169412 vs CONFKB282173819\r\n\r\nThe manual scan puts all matches into a TreeSet, which will eliminate duplicates based on the ordering algorithm. The problem is because a few issues match the exact same line, and we sort based on the last line matched, only one match result \"wins out\", the other is considered a duplicate (even though it's a different match).\r\n\r\nI think the best way to address this would actually be to make the email report consistent with the manual scan, in that the number of lines + last matching line are shown. This will actually mean that for this particular customers case, the scheduled email will start reporting less matches than before. Ideally we should also be looking at some of the regex collisions above and fixing those too.",

This issue can be deleted, I've re-entered it as JIRA-38127.\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\nThe \"Edit Name\" functionality on an Epic in the Agile Planning View is essentially broken.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Create an Epic with a reasonable story name - maybe around 7-8 words, 40-50 characters\r\n2. Switch to the Agile Planning view which shows the Versions/Epics/Issues columns.\r\n3. Find your epic, click on the drop-down menu indicator and select \"Edit Name\"\r\n4. Type in a new name about the same length as the old name.\r\n\r\nResult: the edit field prevents you from typing in more than 30 characters\r\nExpected: the edit field doesn't have any stricter limitations than if you were editing the name directly in the Epic's editor view\r\n\r\n(continuing)\r\n5. Go ahead an accept the new, shortened name in this Edit Name text field\r\n6. Now open the Epic in its full editor view\r\nResult: the new name assigned to the epic is apparently only a special alias for that planning view, not actually the new name of the epic. In fact if you toggle open the disclosure in the planning view you can see the epic now has two names - the long original name, and the constrained name that was just introduced by this (bogus?) \"Edit Name\" command\r\nExpected: if we're chaining the name of the epic, it should change the name of the epic, not introduce some new bizarre alias only visible in the planning GUI\r\n\r\n(continuing)\r\n8. Get rid of the bogus short name that the Planning view \"Edit Name\" command has introduced\r\nExpected: there's an obvious way to do this\r\nActual: there's no obvious way to do this\r\n\r\nThanks for fixing!",

Solution\r\nIf *you have not yet used the problematic 5.5 installer*, you can use these new installers:\r\n* [Windows 32-bit|http://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence/downloads/binary/atlassian-confluence-5.5-1-x32.exe]\r\n* [Windows 64-bit|http://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence/downloads/binary/atlassian-confluence-5.5-1-x64.exe]\r\n\r\nIf *you have already used the problematic 5.5 installer*, you will have to apply the workaround.\r\n\r\nh5.Workaround\r\n(!) Incorrectly modifying the Windows Registry could leave your Windows computer inoperable - always ensure that you have a backup of your registry before making any changes.\r\n\r\n# Start -> Run -> Type \"regedit.exe\" and click OK\r\n# Browse to {{HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\services\\}} and look for the key that starts with \"Confluence\"\r\n#* _In one instance, the key was labelled as Confluence01051465235_\r\n# Double click the \"ImagePath\" value\r\n# In the text box, replace {{tomcat6.exe}} with {{tomcat7.exe}}. For example:\r\n\r\n{code}\r\n\"C:\\Program Files\\Atlassian\\Confluence\\bin\\tomcat6.exe\" //RS//Confluence010514165235\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nbecomes \r\n\r\n{code}\"C:\\Program Files\\Atlassian\\Confluence\\bin\\tomcat7.exe\" //RS//Confluence010514165235{code}\r\n\r\nAttempt to restart Confluence via {{services.msc}} - it should start up correctly.
