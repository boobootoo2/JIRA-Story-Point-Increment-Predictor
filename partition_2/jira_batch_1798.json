Since I regularly use onenote and outlook to do nearly all my writing, i have come to also anticipate confluence performing like these applications. Namely, i would like to have confluence perform simple autocorrecting in my text. Things like always capitalizing after a . (period) and a space because it knows you started a new sentence. Things like always capitalizing I, or days of the week or months of the year. Simple things.\r\n\r\nI'm not talking about something like firefox's typo-notifier. i just want new senteces always capitalized and simple typos (like the fifth word of this sentence) just corrected for me. It is features like this that draw me to applications when i am typing in a professional capacity.\r\n\r\nI guess i would like some info on whether or not this kind of feature will become available soon, or if it can be found in a plugin perhaps.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nPatrick",

From Windows Vista onwards, writing to %PROGRAMFILES% is an elevated operation and requires administrative privileges granted by UAC.\r\n\r\nApplications that require administrative access should advertise this requirement to the host system via an application manifest embedded in the executable. Applications without this will simply get permission denied errors unless the user specifically selects to \"Run As Administrator\" from the right-click context menu.\r\n\r\nThe Confluence installer does not have an application manifest, and we do not provide any instructions to users on running the installer with administrative privileges. I think this is fairly critical barrier to entry for Confluence evaluators. For the average guy/gal installing Confluence for the first time, the installer will simply fail with an unhelpful error message.\r\n\r\nEmbedding a manifest in the installer executable should be pretty easy (see [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb756929.aspx]), although I guess it would depend on whether the packager we are using to create the installer supports custom manifests.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, the installer could write to a non-privileged directory by default, such as %PROGRAMDATA%.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

If the image is too small to see properly, they will want to click it to see in full-size. But Confluence will only expand images that are \"small\" or \"medium\"; clicking on a \"large\" image will do nothing.\r\n\r\nMaybe the behaviour should be that if the image displayed is smaller than the full sized image, then it should be expandable.\r\n\r\nOr else, just simply make all images expandable, whatever the size.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

After keying in the login details and hit login, it will still redirect the user back to login page. This seems to be that cookies are not accepted by it whereby IE treat Confluence as third party.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n# Create a html page with the following code:\r\n#* {code:html}\r\n<iframe src=\"http://extranet.atlassian.com\" width=\"100%\" height=\"600\" />\r\n{code}\r\n# Try to access the page in browser and try to log in using IE 7/8/9\r\n\r\n\\\\\r\nIt would be nice if it is possible to add a P3P header in any Confluence page that set cookies.\r\n\r\nUseful reference (pointed by customer): [http://adamyoung.net/IE-Blocking-iFrame-Cookies]",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFCLOUD-21208].\n  {panel}\n\nAs far as I understand the documentation and tests are showing the RSS Feed Builder combines labels with the logical OR operator.\r\n\r\nI would like to AND the labels when building an RSS feed - either manually or by the RSS feed builder - instead of the present default OR-ing.\r\n\r\nRegular Confluence label work (e.g. contentbylabel macro) allows explicit logical operators by adding and/or signs to force or exclude the presence of a label. When working with rss feeds this doesn't seem to work.\r\n AND-ing means: \"...matches all of the labels...\". If I adapted the logic to the contentbylabel macro I would write 'labels=+hummingbird,+blackbird' (show me all content about hummingbirds and blackbirds - but not content labelled with only one of 'blackbird' or 'hummingbird').\r\n\r\nAn analogy to contentbylabel might look something like:\r\nhttp://my.wiki.org/createrssfeed.action?types=blogpost&...&labelString=%2Bhummingbird,%2Bblackbird&rssType=atom&maxResults...os_authType=basic (URL-encoded + and even - signs)\r\n\r\nAnd what would be even more comfortable is the explicit exclusion of labels: Show me all content that provides (at least) the labels \"bear, dog\" but not \"cat\". If I adapted the logic to the contentbylabel macro I would write 'labels=+bird,-hummingbird' (show me all content about birds, but exclude content about hummingbirds.\").\r\n\r\nAs I noted I am looking for the label functionality (use of logical operators) in rss feeds (Feed Builder, generated URLs) I know from the contentbylabel macro e.g..\r\n",

Other Workaround\r\nIf none of the above helps and you have access to the database then:\r\n# Stop Confluence\r\n# Run the following SQL query\r\n{code:sql}select * from bandana where bandana.bandanacontext = '_GLOBAL' and bandana.bandanakey = 'atlassian.confluence.theme.settings'{code}\r\n# Confirm it returned only 1 row.  Then delete that row by running\r\n{code:sql}delete from bandana where bandana.bandanacontext = '_GLOBAL' and bandana.bandanakey = 'atlassian.confluence.theme.settings'{code}\r\n# Commit\r\n# Restart Confluence\r\n\r\nh3.
