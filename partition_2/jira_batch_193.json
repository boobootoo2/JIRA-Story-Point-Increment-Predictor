However, if a user forgets to add the issue key to the commit and then pushes upstream, it's very hard (without breaking the git repo for others) to add the issue key to the commit message. It would therefore be very useful to be able to manually link an earlier commit - and its code - to an existing JIRA issue, as if the issue key had been included in the commit message.\r\n\r\nThe commit message doesn't need to be changed, but the code changes and commit ID should be added to the issue.",

      "description": "h3. Problem Definition\r\n\r\n_For reference, see DCON-211, DCON-424, DCON-708 please_\r\n\r\nAfter the Github API rate limit resumes, the DVCS connector seems to start its sync algorithm from scratch. It always restarts with repo #1, and repo #2 thru #12 get continually starved.\r\n\r\nI can manually restart the sync process on each repo and often clear things up but it be better for the DVCS connector to handle that more gracefully.\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nChange the order in which repos are synchronized at the start of a sync cycle.  If the sync algorithm just resumed syncing from the \"most stale repo\" (or even just a round-robin scheduled), then organizations like ours would remain \"eventually in sync\" without manual intervention.\r\n\r\nPerhaps a useful logic change might be to remember the repo that was last rate-limited and resume syncing with that repo once the quiet time has expired?\r\n\r\nThis sort of round-robin syncing might be a bit more robust. Another alternative would be to start syncing the repo with the oldest known successful sync time (ie. start with the repo known to be most out-of-date). Either behaviour would be preferable to how it currently works.\r\n\r\nDVCS orders its repos alphabetically, and luck has it that our most active repo happens to start with the letter \"A\" (\"App1\"). So it always gets synced first each hour. But my current team is working on a repo at the end of the alphabet (\"Web2\") and its JIRA integration is getting completely starved by this rate-limit-sync bug.",

I understand that takes more server power, but I have seen many people asking for shorter times as well and think it would greatly benefit the community.

The JSON that bitbucket returns for this particular commit is:\n{code}\n{    \"node\": \"bd7c90f03444\",     \"files\": [        {            \"type\": \"modified\",             \"file\": \"models/PersonalDetails.php\"        }    ],     \"raw_author\": \"Ollie Brennan <ollie@4mation.com.au>\\\"\",     \"author\": \"Olli...@4mation.com.au>\\\"\",     \"timestamp\": \"2011-06-28 08:43:34\",     \"raw_node\": \"bd7c90f034448fdfd3d7698812617d802b696173\",     \"parents\": [        \"ba0012bdaabe\"    ],     \"branch\": \"default\",     \"message\": \"DEAKIN-6 fixes version issue xyz\",     \"revision\": 6,     \"size\": 7}\n{code}\n\nYou can see that the author is set to \"Olli...@4mation.com.au>\\\"\". I suspect that this was not intentional from user's perspective, but I don't know how he got to that state.\n\nNext the plugin tries to request the user with url: https://api.bitbucket.org/1.0/users/Olli...@4mation.com.au>\"  (clearly messed up), and BB returns 404.

I assume this happened because \"mx-4.5\" is a subset of \"MX-4\".\r\n\r\nIs it possible to apply some rules to restrict which issues are linked to JIRA? For example, would it be possible to have commit messages with only upper-case JIRA issue numbers to be synced with JIRA? And also, only commit messages where the JIRA Issue number is \"explicit\" (example: MX-4 would be picked-up and linked to the MX-4 JIRA Issue, but \"emx-4\" would not be linked to MX-4?\r\n\r\nThanks,",
