Not sure if this is different, but it's worth noting since we would love to see improvement here. \r\n\r\nWhen pasting Markdown in the converter in Confluence, the text doesn't convert properly. An anonymized version is attached for what we tried converting. The text prints out as one continuous line of text, with no formatting whatsoever. \r\n\r\nIf there were someway to integrate the actual converter (http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/dingus) into Confluence, that would be great. Anything that improves this feature would be a step up and greatly appreciated. \r\n\r\nThanks in advance.",

Also that would then be possible.\r\n\r\nh2. Alternative solution\r\nAn alternative or additional solution would be to produce macros \"Inline\" and \"PositionHere\". \r\n\r\n\"PositionHere\" macro would position its contents as if the top-left of the page would be the \"current cursor position. (So people could place their Code Block or Page Tree into that macro, which could then be indented or to the right of some text.)\r\n\r\n\"Inline\" macro would start the macro output at \"current cursor position\" but at the right end of the line (and at any linebreak) it would go on from the left. (Even if another macro such as Page Tree inside the Inline macro tries to produce its output as a separate paragraph.)\r\n\r\nThus, \"Inline\" means simply \"Start macro output here as any other text\" (or \"indent just the first line, to this point\", whereas \"PositionHere\" means \"also indent every following line this much\"). That would be great for, e.g., using include or Excerpt Include in the middle of a paragraph.\r\n\r\n*If the panel macro would have an option for left margin* and/or left padding, that would be* exactly the \"PositionHere\" macro *(once you make border and background white), provided that there are also top and bottom margin options (I would set them 0). Then it would be just a box in the middle of the page without additional margins. ",

Problem Definition\r\nCurrently is only possible to create JIRA Issues from Confluence if JIRA has only these fields as required:\r\n* System fields:\r\n** Component\r\n** Fix Versions\r\n** Affect Versions\r\n** Priority\r\n** Due date\r\n** Environment\r\n** Assignee\r\n** Reporter\r\n** Labels\r\n* Custom fields which have these field types such textfield, textarea, URL, number\r\n\r\nSome customers need different field types to be required, which prevents this functionality from working.\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\nAs a Confluence and JIRA user, I would like to be able to add different custom fields (' types) as required. Ideally, I'd like to be able to add any custom field I have in my JIRA instance as required, and this field be recognised in Confluence during the issue creation.",

With more and more OS slowly moving to the more modern systemd approach (see: https://blog.ambientia.fi/2014/06/09/managing-confluence-as-a-service-with-systemd/ ), we need to also cater for this change. \r\n\r\nAs a workaround, you can follow the instructions written by Jussi Haaja here:\r\n{quote}\r\nMy solution can be downloaded from: http://jussiha.staff.ambientia.fi/downloads/confluence-tomcat-systemd.zip , place files in directory libexec to /usr/libexec/ambtomcat, the sysconfig/confluence file to /etc/sysconfig and system/confluence.service to /etc/systemd/system. All configuration related to service (JAVA_OPTS etc.) is done in /etc/sysconfig/confluence, which means that the traditional way of configuring  Tomcat startup parameters via setenv.sh is not utilized at all. If you are not using Fedora 20, you also need the file /usr/share/java-utils/java-functions from package javapackages-tools to use this solution. To get the file, see the Fedora package sources here.\r\n\r\nReview both the sysconfig and the service file so that the file paths reflect your installation. After you are done, Confluence can be started by invoking systemctl start confluence. Review that the startup works by using journalctl \u2013f \u2013u confluence.service\r\n{quote}",

Improvement\r\nWould like the option to display, above or below the macro, a list of all the labels used for all the attachments. \r\n\r\nFor example, (Using numbers to indicate labels and letters to indicate attachments) if I had 3 attachments with the following labels:\r\nAAA: 124\r\nBBB: 321\r\nCCC: 678, 124\r\nI want a list at the top of the macro that says \"124, 321, 678\". \r\n\r\nIt would be ideal if you could click on any given label to filter the attachments to only show attachments that have that label. So, to continue the example, if I clicked on 124 on the top, just AAA and CCC would be shown.  \r\n\r\n\r\nh2. Use Case\r\nThis would help people use consistent label names when labeling new attachments, and allow people to know what terms to filter on.\r\n\r\nLabel List Macro does not fit this need. {quote}tried to use Labels List, but as you indicated it lists all labels within the space. I want to be able to limit the list to the page (our space is large and listing all labels is unruly and makes it harder rather than easier to figure out what is on the page).{quote}\r\n\r\n",

This adds up a lot when you consider how often users are doing this and is one of the biggest drawbacks compared to competing agile software options.\r\n\r\nAll fields in any issue should have the auto-edit ability on mouse highlight like the estimate and remaining fields, for example. Users should not have to bring up a separate window.\r\n\r\nThis will speed up users by exactly a million percent.",
