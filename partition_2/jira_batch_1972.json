We do this in a common document/page in Confluence, before UI Designs are made or code is written. Sadly, we can't see each other's edits as they're being made (until an editor hits Save). This necessitates a Zoom video environment where a screen is shared, and hinders true collaboration - because we can't both be making changes & seeing the others' changes at the same time. Collaboration tends to thrive better if done in real-time.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n*Precedent*: Google Docs (see video link below)\r\n * [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4wF58sbzPU]\r\n * What to mimic: multiple people can edit a Google Doc at the same time, and their changes are autosaved. This would help with collaboration tremendously.\r\n\r\n*Another Precedent*: Figma \"Multiplayer\" mode (see video link below)\r\n * [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zj163lgt_kI&t=189s]\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n*I should be able to accomplish these steps*:\r\n # Log into Atlassian.\r\n # Navigate to a \"page\" where an epic is housed.\r\n # Edit the epic easily by clicking into fields (without having to enter the global \"edit\" mode).\r\n # Have my changes autosaved immediately.\r\n # If a collaborator is editing the same document at the same time, I should be able to see the changes they make in real-time, as they are being typed (without having to hit the \"Save\" button manually.)\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n*Other nice-to-have features*:\r\n * \"Follow\" mode, where the view window screen automatically follows the view window of another user (See Figma) while they're working, so I can see what they see in real-time within Confluence.\r\n * A page outline with section headers to know where you are on the page (epics can get very long).\r\n ** Precedent: [https://material.io/components/app-bars-bottom]\u00a0Watch the \"Content\" list on the right side as you scroll down.
