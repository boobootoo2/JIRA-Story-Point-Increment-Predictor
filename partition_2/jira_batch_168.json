      "description": "*CONTEXT:* For epics consisting of a large number of items (20+) it is necessary to review their implementation status on a regular basis. The easiest (and fasted) way today is to go to the epic and see its \"Issues in Epic\" panel. It shows all items within this epic, with a few attributes near each like type, assignee, status.\r\n\r\n*PAIN:* when an epic is in progress, i.e. some its items in it are already done, others not yet started, others are in progress, it is hard to cognitively 'filter' remaining work (i.e. issues by statuses). But this is important - to quickly get a clear picture of the incomplete stuff. The workaround is simple - _manually_ go to issues search, build a new filter, choose appropriate project for that filter, then choose epic in question, then choose statuses of issues. Lots of clicks, lots of time wasted.\r\n\r\n*SUGGESTION:* add ability for 'one-click' filtering by statuses right within the \"Issues by Epic\" panel. That would reduce time needed to prepare reviews, and thus will increase a productivity of teams.\r\n\r\n*HINT:* In another panel within an issue called \"Sub-Tasks\" there's a menu available, with items like \"Show ALL\", \"Show Open\", \"Open in Issues Navigator\".\u00a0 IMO if the same menu+functions become available for the \"Issues in Epic\" panel - that would be fantastic!!\u00a0 I don't think anything more advanced is needed at this point.\r\n\r\nThank you!

Issue Summary\r\n\r\nSome of the incomplete issues can be moved to a backlog, not to a new sprint, if we close the sprint from a board with a different filter than sprint was started, even if the complete sprint dialog said that all incomplete issue will be moved to a new sprint.\r\n\r\nIt is because complete sprint dialog shows the number of incomplete issues based on the sprint custom field. However, Jira moves issues based on the board filter.\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Create the new scrum project. Project name - *Da*,\r\n # Create 6 issues. Issue names - *1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6*,\r\n # For the issues\u00a0*2,4,6*\u00a0set the fix version to\u00a0*1.0*,\r\n # Create new sprint,\r\n # Move *all* the issues to a new sprint,\r\n # Start new sprint,\r\n # Move issues *3* and *4* to \"*In-progress*\" state,\r\n # Move issues *5* and *6* to \"*Done*\" state.\r\n !image-2020-03-25-10-01-16-409.png!\r\n # Change the board filter from\r\n{code:java}\r\nproject = DA ORDER BY Rank ASC{code}\r\nto\r\n{code:java}\r\n\u00a0project = DA AND fixVersion = 1.0 ORDER BY Rank ASC{code}\r\n!image-2020-03-25-10-12-22-126.png!\r\n\r\n # Complete the sprint and move the incomplete issues to New sprint\r\n !image-2020-03-25-10-05-07-633.png!\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nThere are two potential fixes.\r\n\r\nFirst one:\r\n * Complete sprint dialog shows a number of the issues in the sprint - works like now\r\n\r\n * Jira moves all incomplete issues to destiny sprint not only those on the current board - works differently\r\n\r\nSecond one:\r\n * Complete sprit dialog shows a number of the issues based on the current board - works differently\r\n\r\n * Jira moves incomplete issues from the current board a to destiny sprint and remains issues to a backlog - works like now\r\n\r\nh3.

To see 1,3 issues you need to get back to old filter or create a new board.\r\n !image-2020-03-25-10-27-39-248.png!\r\nh3.

Summary\r\n\r\nPermission Schemes are tricky to manage, especially when there are so many individual permissions to consider.\u00a0 The most basic permission for a Jira Project is the Browse Projects permissions, without almost nothing works.\r\n\r\nHowever, once we have the Browse Issue permission there is no current way to say, all users with the basic browse permission in this project should have other permissions.\u00a0 Instead, every single permission must be explicitly stated.\u00a0 The alternative is to use the \"Any Logged In Users\" under Application Access or \"Anyone on the web\" under Group.\u00a0\r\n\r\nNeither of the two options is great from an Audit and Security point of view and can lead to confusion when Project Administrators look at their project's permission schemes and think \"Why does everyone have access to my project?\"\r\nh1. Suggestion\r\n\r\nMy suggestion is to add a reference to another permission or at least to the Browse Projects permission.\u00a0 Doing this would make it possible to grant a single permission to an explicit group or role and then the other permissions can reference the explicit grant.\r\nh3. Short Example:\r\n\r\nGroups 1, 2, 3 and Roles A, B\r\n\r\nPermissions:\r\n * Browse Project\r\n * Create Issues\r\n * Add Comments\r\n * Create Attachments\r\n * View Read-Only Workflow.\r\n\r\nWith the current model of Permission Schemes, if I want to grant the above permissions to each listed groups and roles, I would need to add each to every permission.\r\n * Browse Project -\u00a0Group 1, Group 2, Group 3, Role A, Rold B\r\n * Create Issues -\u00a0Group 1, Group 2, Group 3, Role A, Rold B\r\n * Add Comments -\u00a0Group 1, Group 2, Group 3, Role A, Rold B\r\n * Create Attachments -\u00a0Group 1, Group 2, Group 3, Role A, Rold B\r\n * View Read-Only Workflow -\u00a0Group 1, Group 2, Group 3, Role A, Rold B\r\n\r\nAnd then, if I need to remove Group 2 from access, I have to painfully remove it from each permission one at a time\r\nh3. New and Improved\r\n\r\nWith the suggestion a Permission Scheme could look like this:\r\n * Browse Project -\u00a0Group 1, Group 2, Group 3, Role A, Rold B\r\n * Create Issues - All users with Browse Project permissions\r\n * Add Comments -\u00a0All users with Browse Project permissions\r\n * Create Attachments -\u00a0All users with Browse Project permissions\r\n * View Read-Only Workflow. -\u00a0All users with Browse Project permissions\r\n\r\nThen if I need to remove a group from access, it is only from a single permission holder.",

Watch for the quantity of resources used from JVM to leave some space to Jira\r\n\r\n5) If you use ExecutorService as it was suggested, please review the information about thread wrappers here:\r\n [https://docs.atlassian.com/software/jira/docs/api/7.2.8/com/atlassian/jira/util/thread/OffRequestThreadExecutorImpl.html]\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPlease add these recommendations to the Developer page at [https://developer.atlassian.com/server/jira/platform/developing-for-high-availability-and-clustering/#PluginGuidetoJIRAHighAvailabilityandClustering-Scheduledtasksandbackgroundprocesses]",

I'm singling out Epic Link query performance because I'm noticing this is one of our top-ranked common operations. This can cause delays and block stories from being created when the Epic Link is a required field on the create screen. \r\n\r\nh3. Steps to reproduce\r\nYou can experience this when you:\r\n# Edit an Issue\r\n#  fill out the `E_pic Link_` value\r\n#* Jira will generate the XHR request -{{/rest/greenhopper/1.0/epics}}\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\nEpic data loads within 3 seconds. \r\n\r\nh3.
