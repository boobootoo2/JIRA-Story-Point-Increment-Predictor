Steps to reproduce:\r\n# Access Confluence in IE browser\r\n# Create a Confluence page\r\n# Insert [Page Layout|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Working+with+Page+Layouts+and+Columns+and+Sections] e.g. Three columns\r\n# Add text to all elements, add some links to that text.\r\n# Save the page\r\n# Edit the page. Editing of the links on top will work ok. \r\n# Scroll down. Editing of links is no longer possible, the menu (Go to link, Edit and Unlink) are not displayed. The layout flickers when links are clicked.\r\n# See the screen cast for details: http://screencast.com/t/Y42hyAaiPFo\r\n# Same issue is not observed without the use of [Page Layout|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Working+with+Page+Layouts+and+Columns+and+Sections] in IE\r\n# Here's a sample space xml backup from a freshly installed Confluence 5.0.2 that represents the problem: [^ds-152558-6.xml.zip] - sample taken from Demonstration Space\r\n\r\nh5. Workaround:\r\n# Edit the links using [Confluence Source Editor|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.atlassian.confluence.plugins.editor.confluence-source-editor] in IE browser\r\n# Use Chrome or Firefox browser instead\r\n\r\nh5. Note:\r\nUpon further research, I found out that the issue only occurred when you have to scroll down the page to edit the links. It seems that when the page layout height is more than the default editor height (the need to scroll down the page), problem exist.\r\n\r\nh5. Root Cause\r\nThe underlying problem is that Internet Explorer fires a scrolling event sometimes when the link is clicked, which results in the property panel being closed (which when scrolling normally is what is expected).",

This should be review and improved. Some suggestions and things that have been talked about:\r\n* Review min time for polling. Do we really need to ask for stuff every 20 seconds?\r\n* Make sure we only poll when it makes sense: user/tab active, logged in users vs anonymous users, page new or active vs old pages that are not modified...\r\n* Back off polling more aggressively according to response time or stop polling if error response received (this would avoid overloading slow servers even more)\r\n* Ideally we would have a single polling thread (or even websocket) that can be shared between plugins",

From our previous coding experience we have found IF_ELSE IF css conditional statement is not a good way to detect browsers and control their individual browser behaviour. Its creating major issues intermittently on IE browsers, but it didn't happen on other browsers.\r\n\r\nWe will suggest to use different script eg php/javascript etc to detect browsers and assign with individual css for each type, version of browsers and OS platforms if required. That is the safest way to do from our coding experiences. It may solve most of the IE compatability mode issue.\r\n\r\nI am opening this issue for voting so that it can be fixed soon.\r\n\r\nThanks",

Every time I upgrade my system I take 25 minutes instead of 2, this is because I have to stop the confluence instance again after upgrade and redo every custom configuration.\r\nThe most annoying thing a have to do (so annoying that I keep my instance out of date and wait some updates until the upgrade worthwhile) is:\r\n1. Stop confluence. Again (this take time on my system)\r\n2. Move (don't copy) activation-1.0.2.jar and mail-1.4.1.jar from <confluence-install>/confluence/WEB-INF/lib to <confluence-install>/lib.\r\n(Are you seriously? Why a have to do that? And why the confluence package don't do that by default? Some freak bug like some microsoft products? Just kidding )\r\n3. I'm smart so I don't type again the configuration on server.xml, I make a copy, but I cannot ensure that my copy just change the lines for mail config and  I have to make a diff on the command line to be sure that I will not break the system and have to stop confluence again.\r\n\r\nNot least but important too. I have to take care of the security of that file, if someone read that content my account is compromised. Well my system is secured and only root has access but who knows, and what about shared servers that others can be using, like universities?\r\n\r\nJira have a configuration for SMTP SSL email, and this is not broken between upgrades because is in the database.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is easy to implement in spring config. So be nice with me and other sys devs. :-) \r\n\r\nBy the way, I have other configurations like SSO with Crowd. Is tedius too, every config that depends on files and cannot be automatic created by confluence (and jira, and stash, and crowd) is tedius to maintain between upgrades. \r\n\r\nKeep all on database and make the upgrade a easy, funny and routine part of your products :P",

They can click back to in their browser or keyboard to return to Confluence, but this isn't ideal. \r\n\r\nWhat would be ideal would be to create an iFrame on the page, and when we're creating links we would like to have an option under the Edit Link button to specify an iFrame (by iFrame name) to open the link in.  That way the user can see the iFrame content without leaving the parent Confluence window. ",

This means at the moment that they will directly consume images via their public (HTTP) URL. The problem with using those URLs is that they might not be stable (we don't consider them as part of the API), and they don't provide additional information about the consumed images ahead of requesting them (e.g. dimension). In addition, those resources often get consumed directly, even though they should be considered _static_ for the time of this Confluence version. \r\n\r\nIt would be good to have a service which can communicate images which are meant to be part of the API, e.g. spit out the internal (as in filesystem) URLs and public URLs for icons. \r\n\r\nPseudo code:\r\n\r\n{code}\r\npublic interface ConfluenceImageResourceService\r\n{\r\n    ImageResource urlForIcon(IconType type, UrlMode urlMode);\r\n}\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nwith \r\n\r\n{code}\r\npublic interface ImageResource\r\n{\r\n    URL getUrl();\r\n    \r\n    Dimension getDimension();\r\n}\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n{code}\r\npublic enum IconType\r\n{\r\n    PAGE, BLOG, SPACE; // etc ...\r\n}\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nIf the HTTP URL is requested, the implementation should request the URL via _com.atlassian.plugin.webresource.WebResourceUrlProvider.getStaticResourcePrefix(UrlMode)_ so that the correct caching headers get applied (_com.atlassian.plugin.servlet.ResourceDownloadUtils.addPublicCachingHeaders(HttpServletRequest, HttpServletResponse)_). We would also have to provide a JS client for that service (possibly piggybacking the mapping on the initial response) in order to be used by plugins 3. That JS client should obviously only allow the retrieval of the HTTP URLs.\r\n",

      "description": "The ImagePlaceHolders use GETs to send macro parameters to the server.  This works well most of the time but causes problems when a macro's parameters exceed the query limit for a GET request.  This is usually 2k.  During an editing session, often the client side and server side are out of sync, as there is usually a delay between making a save and the draft saving.\r\n\r\nThis all works ok if your macro place holder is a static image.  If you want the macro place holder to reflect the current editing state then you need to communicate this change to the server during the edit.  One option is to trigger a draft save and leave it up to the macro place holder code to find the right version of the draft and do its work.\r\n\r\nA better solution would be for the editor to POST after a macro has been edited so the parameters can be sent to the server and stored in some temporary location like the session.  The image place holder logic can then check the session for the up to date parameters and pass on to the macro with no change (instead of passing them through from the GET).  This would replace the need to pass the macro parameters to the image URL as parameters.\r\n\r\nThe GET mechanism with macro parameters would still need to work and could be the default behaviour if the query string is short, or the GET vs POST options could be controlled by configuration.\r\n\r\nThis problem also comes up when using plugins 3 macros.\r\n",
