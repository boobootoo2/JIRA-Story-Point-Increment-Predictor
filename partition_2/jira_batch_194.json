As a result, the user is redirected to a screen with the incorrect branch selected as source.\r\n\r\nh6.Steps to reproduce\r\n# create a JIRA issue in an instance linked to a Bitbucket account with capital letters in it;\r\n# create two branches linked to that JIRA issue;\r\n# commit to branch 1;\r\n# commit to branch 2;\r\n# in the JIRA issue, open the _Branches_ dialog and click *Create pull request* for branch 1.\r\n\r\n*Expected result:* Bitbucket screen for creating a pull request from branch 1 is displayed.\r\n*Actual result:* Bitbucket screen is displayed, with the branch most recently committed to selected as source - regardless of the branch selected in JIRA. \r\n\r\nh6.Cause\r\nThe *Create pull request* JIRA link ignores the team name capitalisation. The link target URL is: https://bitbucket.org/team/repository/pull-request/new?source=team%2Frepository%3A%3Abranch-1. Bitbucket isn't able to associate it with the correct branch, and so the user is redirected to https://bitbucket.org/Team/repository/pull-request/new which uses the default source branch.\r\n\r\nIn the branch list in Bitbucket, the *Create pull request* is formatted correctly: https://bitbucket.org/Team/repository/pull-request/new?source=Team/repository%3A%3Abranch-1&event_source=branch_list",

The DVCS page says the repo DID sync, as it was told to. Yet the issue page does not reflect the update. \r\n\r\nSo my question becomes, how can a DVCS repo sync via a WebHook, but not actually update Project issues to reflect commits and dev activity?\r\n\r\nAnd why would this differ between using WebHooks vs POST Service?",

Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Have JIRA Cloud and Bitbucket integrated\r\n# Create an empty repository on Bitbucket\r\n# Clone it with _git clone_ to your machine\r\n# Add a file/folder to it\r\n# Commit the changes making sure you add a message that references an existing JIRA issue and use \"_#comment_\" smart commit (Ex: {{git commit -m \"ABC-123 #comment This is a comment.\"}})\r\n# Push the changes with {{git push}}\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nOn JIRA you can see the comment added to the ABC-123 issue\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nThe comment isn't added.\r\n \r\nh3. Notes\r\nChecking JIRA's database you can see the \"_SMARTCOMMIT\\_AVAILABLE_\" flag is set to \"f\" instead of \"t\" as it should because a smart commit was performed (see the _MESSAGE_ column).\r\n{noformat}jira=> select * from \"AO_E8B6CC_CHANGESET_MAPPING\" where \"RAW_NODE\" like '%5e3c0fc%';\r\n AUTHOR  |     AUTHOR_EMAIL      | BRANCH |        DATE         | FILES_DATA | FILE_COUNT | FILE_DETAILS_JSON | ID | ISSUE_KEY |                           MESSAGE                           |            \r\n       NODE                   | PARENTS_DATA | PROJECT_KEY |                    RAW_AUTHOR                    |                 RAW_NODE                 | REPOSITORY_ID | SMARTCOMMIT_AVAILABLE | VERSION\r\n \r\n---------+-----------------------+--------+---------------------+------------+------------+-------------------+----+-----------+-------------------------------------------------------------+------------\r\n------------------------------+--------------+-------------+--------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------+---------------+-----------------------+--------\r\n-\r\n fwillig | fwillig@atlassian.com | master | 2016-06-21 14:11:09 |            |          0 |                   | 57 |           | PAC-5 #comment First commit on new repository with comment. | 5e3c0fc07e3\r\n09f67d0f217e292e1acef4fdf7efc | []           |             | Felipe van Schaik Willig <fwillig@atlassian.com> | 5e3c0fc07e309f67d0f217e292e1acef4fdf7efc |             0 | f                     |       3\r\n                                                                                                                               :                                                                          \r\n                                                                                                                                                                                                   \r\n(1 row){noformat}\r\n\r\nh3.Workaround\r\nAdd the comment manually to the JIRA issue, or only add comments from the second commit on.",

      "description": "Here is a description on how DVCS connector synchronises BB/GH commits with JIRA issue.\n* Initially after linking new repository to JIRA we use BB/GH API to retrieve ALL commits in the repository. \n* After this initial synchronisation connector does only INCREMENTAL synchronisation - it retrieves only changesets that were commited after the last synchronisation. \n* To find out which changesets to retrieve, connector remembers the changeset with latest date and keeps the date in LAST_COMMIT_DATE variable. When doing incremental synchronisation we ask BB/GH api to return latest changesets and use only those where commit date of changeset is >= LAST_COMMIT_DATE.\n\nThis way if JIRA is down for some time, users can continue commiting. When JIRA goes back up, connector retrieves all the commits from latest up to LAST_COMMIT_DATE.\n\nThe problem with this approach is when users don't push their commits immediately:\n* Let's say on Tuesday *userA* commits and pushes his commit \n* DVCS Connector will catch and synchronise the commit and set LAST_COMMIT_DAY to Tuesday\n* On Wednesday *userB* pushes his commit that was commited on Monday. The commit date for this commit is Monday.\n* DVCS Connector will never synchronise the commit because commit date (Monday) < LAST_COMMIT_DATE\n\n\nREST API differences\nBitbucket and GitHub APIs behave differently and different approaches will have to be used to fix it.\n\nGitHub\nGitHub API (https://api.github.com/repos/jirabitbucketconnector/missingcommits/commits) returns changesets ordered by commitDate. Changeset for each branch have to be retrieved separately.\n\nBitbucket\nBitbucket API (https://api.bitbucket.org/1.0/repositories/jirabitbucketconnector/missingcommits/changesets) returns changeset ordered by push date. All changesets from all branches are returned from same REST call.",
