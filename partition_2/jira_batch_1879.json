Even if you go back and edit the page to remove yourself from the users with \"View\" permission, it'll add you again. I think there's a bug with the Page Info tab functionality though, because you can click the padlock icon to remove the \"View\" permission from yourself in this case. Or maybe that's intentional? As a result the page doesn't appear in the \"Pages\" tab in Browse Space, but I can get to it directly (as an admin). This could create problems if I tried to create another page with the same name, it would be very confusing! Can you also check if the padlock functionality is broken in \"Restricted Pages\" in Space Admin too?\r\n",

Configuring an email to: address in a Space is a lot less grief than creating a specific mail-drop for it.\r\n\r\nThis request is to basically add the ability to pull email from the given account with a given to: address, thinking about it, this would be a relatively small change (with a working example careof Jira) and no where near as great as the issue linked...\r\n{quote}",

I have created a space for our group and I have found no way to create a drop down list.\r\n\r\nCloaking is great, but the cloaked information underneath can be listed but cannot be arranged in any way.  It cannot be bolded, colored, highlighted, etc.  Neither can it be bulleted which would be a great improvement.\r\n\r\nAs for now, cloaking is the only way I have found to do drop down lists, but when adding informational links below, it begins to get jumbled together. \r\n\r\nI have also tried using decks with cards in order to try to make the page more manageable.  However, if this is to work, I need to have a running list of cards going across the screen.  This is easily done.  I am not able to make the tabs of the cards into links if I need to, is there a way to do this that I am just not seeing?\r\n\r\n\r\nok, to summarize. \r\n1) Is there a way to do a drop down list?\r\n2) Is there a way to somehow set apart the cloaked information once it is uncloaked?\r\n3) When using decks of cards, is there a way to take the tab of the card and make that tab a link (and yes I know, it would take away the card information at the bottom).\r\n\r\nThank you!",
