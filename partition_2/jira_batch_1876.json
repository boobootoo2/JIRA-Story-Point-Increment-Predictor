      "description": "After the implementation of the CAS client for Confluence (http://www.soulwing.org/confluence-cas.jsp) and some web.xml configuration (attached), all users will be prompted an \"Insufficient Permission\" page first after user login every time (more details and screenshot are attached for reference). Someone suggests that some actions can potentially be done on seraph/confluence to rectify the issue. To followup, I'd like to seek your advice :\r\n1. Would it be possible that the insufficient permission problem be resolved relatively easily by making configuration adjustment or minor application enhancement on Confluence/Seraph?\r\n2. If this issue can not be easily or completely resolved, are there any suggestion or turnaround that we (all users of CAS and confluence) can do to either avoid (bypass) or reduce the impact of this problem (of getting this warning prompted everytime after login)?\r\n\r\nA no. of discussions somewhat related to this issue which have been made in the past are linked for reference :\r\nhttp://www.soulwing.org/jira/browse/SCC-10\r\nhttp://www.soulwing.org/jira/browse/SCC-22\r\nhttp://forums.atlassian.com/thread.jspa?messageID=257254993&#257254993\r\nhttp://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRA-7524\r\nhttp://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRA-2439\r\n\r\nThanks for your advice in advance.\r\n\r\nRemark : the attached configuration and discussion is extracted from http://www.soulwing.org/jira/ discussion.\r\n\r\n",

Short of doing that, we could write a procedure like this:\r\n\r\n# Install Confluence, connected to test instance of database. Hopefully the policy does not pertain to the test/dev instance of the db.\r\n# Create a db on production by hand using the database from test as a model. This should include the insertion of data as well, at least for the admin user as well as any other data.\r\n# Using the confluence-home directory from the test installation as a model, configure the connection URL string from confluence.cfg.xml to point to the manually created database on the production db.\r\n\r\nWithout doing this, the setup wizard will detect the existing database but still prompt the user to overwrite. if the operation is done successfully, there should be no setup wizard when Confluence is launched in the production environment.\r\n\r\nOne additional problem to keep in mind is that upgrading tasks may require table creation as well.",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFCLOUD-10226].\n  {panel}\n\nI have created a page family (Example with childen Child1, Child2, and Child3) and a template ExampleTemplate which would deliver a page with similar layout as the Example page. However, I found no documentation on how to create a page family using templates so that child pages will be created automatically. So my questions are: \r\n1. Is it possible to create a template with associated children pages so that when the main page is created using that template, the children pages will be automatically created or can be edited if a child page is also a templete?\r\n\r\n2. If the above is not available, is there a way to COPY (not MOVE - it wouldn't be a page family template if the children are gone) the child pages from Example (or selecting from some or all the pages in a Space) to the page being created using the template, i.e., see PageCreatedByExampleTemplate? To keep the child pages unique, this process would need either to automatically prepend a predefined string (i.e., PCBET_ in my example) to the new child pages or have the ability to enter it (either each one individually or one prefix for all) at the time of creation.\r\n\r\nExample\r\nChild1\r\nChild2\r\nChild3\r\n\r\nExampleTemplate\r\n\r\nPageCreatedByExampleTemplate\r\nPCBET_Child1\r\nPCBET_Child2\r\nPCBET_Child3\r\n",
