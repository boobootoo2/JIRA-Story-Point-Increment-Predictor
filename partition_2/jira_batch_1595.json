This project has 2 custom date-time issue fields defined in it. \n\nDiagnosed Jira team calendar integration locally and found that when custom fields are used, JIRA plugin makes one query for each issue:\n{code:language=sql}\nSELECT ID, ISSUE, CUSTOMFIELD, PARENTKEY, STRINGVALUE, NUMBERVALUE, TEXTVALUE, DATEVALUE, VALUETYPE FROM PUBLIC.customfieldvalue WHERE ISSUE='10100'\n{code}\nOur theory is that when project contains thousands of issues this would result in a considerable lag due to accumulated network latency.\n\n\nDebugging Jira plugin code revealed that the problem lies in \nDefaultDateCustomFieldDateProvider line 48:\n{code}\nObject customFieldValue = issue.getCustomFieldValue(customField);\n{code}\nwhich results in an SQL call.\n\nThe idea for a fix: make one query for all the project's issues and then access required values from memory. I have not found API support for this, so possibly it would imply working with SQL directly.\n\n",

I have a JIRA,Crowd,Confluence, Fisheye, Crucible server. While in the Confluence Team Calendars, I have a People Calendar for our small group. Our Confluence authentication is setup to only look into Crowd. When I go to Team Calendars and add an event on the \"People Calendar\" I only see 2 out of our 10 users when trying to create an event based off of a user (Vacation Leave). I believe those 2 users were probably in the system prior to switching to crowd. Is there simple way to allow all users from crowd to be accessible by the Team Calendars People Calendar?",

User found it before I did and to fix I did:\n\nStep 4: turn on global logo\nStep 5: click the \"Reset logo to default\" link at https://<confluence base url>/admin/configuregloballogo.action\nStep 6: turn off global logo\n\nResult: back to default atlassian icon on the cal macros.\n\n\nI assume that the effect should be that when \"Global Logo\" is set to \"Off\" at https://<confluence base url>/admin/configuregloballogo.action that the logo is not displayed ANYWHERE.  So, filing this as a TEAMCAL bug as this project should check to see if logo is on or off.\n\nBut if your response is going to be \"Well, the logo was uploaded, so the problem is not in the plugin, but in Confluence code!\" -- then this is a bug in Confluence as there's no way to \"fix\" this behavior without re-enabling the Global Logo, removing the logo, and turning off the logo again.

[See the corresponding bug report|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFCLOUD-50803].\n  {panel}\n\nWhen upgrading to Confluence 3.5 I backed up all of the calendars (via .ics files) that were found anywhere on my Confluence install. Then I uninstalled the plugin, upgraded Confuence, and installed Team Calendars.\n\nThe problem is that the only way I seem to be able to add the calendars back is as one of \"my\" calendars. I know that they can be embedded in any space, but this is not only annoying for me (to have all calendars that I ported over for my users sitting in my calendars) but it's going to be a political problem if people feel like they have lost control over their calendars.\n\nPlease tell me how I can reassign the owners -- a SQL query, some configuration file modification, etc.\n\nThanks!",
