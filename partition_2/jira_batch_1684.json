Then using Page History, try to revert the page to version 1 (which results in a stack trace in the browser).\r\n\r\nThe characters are shown in the accompanying screenshot (TextMate shows the strange characters), which if converted to regular spaces (or &nbsp;) seems to fix everything.

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFCLOUD-35540].\n  {panel}\n\nReproducible using Chrome 38 and Confluence 5.6.3.\r\n\r\nWhen you use the browser \"back\" button to return to the Export PDF Options page after doing a custom export of selected pages, it remembers that you had selected \"Custom Export\" but the page selector is reset to the default of \"all pages\" and the page selection is not displayed. (see [^back to export pdf options.png]) A user may then click on the Export button, either in an attempt to get the page list to be displayed, or on the assumption that the same page selection will be used as last time. This triggers an accidental full space export which consumes resources needlessly. \r\n\r\nWorkaround is to click on Custom Export or change the export type to Normal Export and then back to Custom, so that the page selection is displayed and the user can set the pages to export (again).\r\n\r\nNote that the behaviour is different with Firefox 31 ESR. In that case when you go \"back\" to the Export PDF Options page after doing a custom export of selected pages, *all* selections are reset to initial values. This means that the type is set back to Normal Export. It's not nice that the user's settings have been forgotten, but at least they are all forgotten consistently and it's unlikely that the user will be confused about what will happen when they click Export. \r\n\r\nWhat would really be nice is if the tool remembered *all* the export settings (export type and selected pages) so that a user could easily redo the same export. One of our users discovered this problem when they did a custom export, checked the results, discovered a problem, fixed it on the Confluence page, and then tried to go \"back\" to redo the same export.

The upper image was named \"Warnmeldung Wasserrecht.png\", the lower simply \"Warnmeldung.png\". *Both* images were attached to a different page not included in export. The lower one appears correctly, the upper one doesn't.\r\nThe missing image is actually missing from the \"attachments\" subfolder in the created HMTL.zip file, that's why it cannot be shown.\r\n\r\nI was able to create a test case within 5 minutes, so this should be easy to reproduce.\r\n\r\nThe only \"workaround\" is *extremely* time consuming, because it basically means to re-organize and rename many of the images of every page and rework the pages accordingly. Hardly a solution for a whole space. I therefore consider a true fix for this absolutely necessary.\r\n\r\n----\r\nNote: Together with bug CONF-31714 this renders Confluence rather useless for creating (software) documentation which needs to be exported, at least in our case where we use (and re-use) lots of images on the pages.

If there are more than 40 tasks, Confluence does not extend the report to a further page length but just reports the firs 40 tasks as defined in the sorting criteria. So, for example, if there are 150 tasks, only the first 40 are reported, the next 41-150 are not visible and they can be found only if someone knows in which pages they have been recorded. This makes the macro unusable, as it can not create a full task report. In the last example, the macro should generate a page of 150 records, consisting of 3 parts with 40 records each and a forth part with the remaining 30 records.",

Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Install JIRA 6.3.5 (or newer)\r\n# Install latest version of SD\r\n# Create a user on JIRA side, and remove it from all groups (to mimic a \"customer\")\r\n# Install Confluence 5.5.1 (or older)\r\n# Create a space and several pages under the space\r\n# Set up Application links between JIRA and Confluence using 2-Legged OAuth requests and allow user impersonation through 2-Legged OAuth\r\n# In the SD project, create a knowledge base link to the Confluence space previously created\r\n# In a new/incognito window, log in as the customer on the SD portal\r\n# In the SD portal, search for one of the pages created in step 5\r\n\r\nh3.

Notes\r\nInvestigation has shown that the \r\n{code}confluence-knowledge-base-1.3.jar\r\nconfluence-remote-page-view-plugin-1.4.jar{code}\r\nplugins are responsible for this. Upgrading to Confluence 5.5.2 or newer resolves this issue. \r\n\r\nAlternatively, you can replace the bundled plugins with the newer versions as provided as attachments to this bug report.\r\n(!) This has been tested and confirmed to work in Confluence 5.4.3\r\nWe can however not guarantee this to provide a solution in all cases. As such, we do not support this method, and serves as an ultimate workaround in case upgrading Confluence is no option. At all times, we advice upgrading Confluence over replacing the plugin files.\r\n\r\n(!) This error might happen on more recent Confluence releases (e.g. 5.6.4) if the {{confluence-knowledge-base-1.4.jar}} plugin fails to load and is not enabled during the startup. In such cases, a possible workaround is to manually update the add-on via [file upload on UPM|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/UPM/Installing+add-ons#Installingadd-ons-Installingbyfileupload].",
