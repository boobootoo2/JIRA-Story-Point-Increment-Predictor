To my surprise the zip backup created on 2000 expanded to something like:\n\n\\entities.xml\n\\exportDescriptor.properties\n\\shortcut-map.properties\n\\attachments\\16\\scm interaction.png\n\n\nwhere the back slashes above *don't* represent path delimiters but do represent characters that are part of the file names.  So essentially instead of getting \"entities.xml\" the import folder ends up with \"\\entities.xml\" \n\nI'm not sure if this is a know zip problem with Java on Windows and Linux.  \n\nI went in and fixed up all the file names/directories, created a zip file on Linux and then the restore worked fine.",

      "description": "At first glance this idea may sound a little out there, but I think it could be a very radical and innovative feature.\n\nWe've started using Confluence to publish/manage our software development design process.  We create pages for features, attach design documents, invite conversation and discussion over features.  Most of this conversation happens over email.  We have a email list full of people/stakeholders who need to sign-off on specifications or at least participate in the discussions about them.  \n\nThe most important topics and conversations happen over this email list.  This is a very important asset to us.  It would be very cool if there was a feature to include this information, these emails in Confluence.  \n\nThere are a few ways I thought of doing this.  Perhaps require that that a Confluence descriptor be used in the title or text of the email.  Something like \"@Space/Page\" in the email title and Confluence would archive the email in that page.  This would also assume Confluence is monitoring some email address.  The Confluence page would have a threaded email listing much like any other email archive.  \n\nI know this probably seems a little out there, but I think that the result could be very powerful.  Imagine going to a page to see a new feature, then being able to click on a link like \"Email Discussions\" and see the dialog that brought that new feature into being.  ",

While we can add them as attachments to a Confluence page, they are not versioned. There is an issue requesting versioning for attachments (CONF-527) but I think it would be better to add the ability to upload a non-HTML document as a \"page\" in Confluence.\n\nFor example, the \"add page\" and \"add child page\" commands would have variants to \"upload page\" or \"upload child page\". After clicking on the link, Confluence would prompt me to enter the path to the doc on my local drive. After entering the location (perhaps with a comment) and submitting, Confluence would create a \"shell\" page that displays the comment and a link to the actual document. Clicking on the \"edit page\" link on the \"shell\" would allow me to change the comment or upload a new version of the doc.",

This way languages can be added and altered by end users and atlassian alike.
