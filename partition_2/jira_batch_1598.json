[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFCLOUD-50379].\n  {panel}\n\nTeam Calendars 4.0 shipped with the idea of event types.\r\n\r\nWe've been thinking that towards the long-term we want to head towards the ability for customers to create their own types of events.\r\n\r\nThis issues encompasses the idea of being able to create a type of event for a calendar. This would include potential things as: \r\n* The event name (Kind of incorporated by TEAMCAL-765)\r\n* A possible icon (See TEAMCAL-430)\r\n* A colour (See TEAMCAL-364)\r\n\r\nThis issue is to track the overall demand for this. To help us better understand your problems, we'd love to hear your thoughts on this. Could you see yourself using it? How? And can you give us examples of the types of events you would create to provide a better understanding? \r\n\r\n{panel}\r\nHi Everyone,\r\n\r\nThanks for your feedback on this issue. Please note the \"priority\" set on this issue isn't the actual priority of the feature on our roadmap. There isn't a way for us to hide the unused fields in this project.\r\n\r\nWe do feel this feature request is a _very_ important part of Team Calendars and I can advise that it is on our short-term roadmap. Unfortunately, for us to enable you guys to create your own types of events for each calendar requires a significant architectural change. The good news is our team is working on this change right now. This re-architecture will also enable us to build other highly requested features as well as provide a significant performance improvement. \r\n\r\nSo our first step is to get this re-architecture right! We want to create a stable foundation for the future of Team Calendars. Following that, this will be the next thing we will tackle on our roadmap.\r\n\r\nThank you for your patience with this issue. If you are going to comment, please make it useful in terms of providing some context for the types of events you want to create.\r\n \r\nCheers,\r\nSherif Mansour\r\nTeam Calendars Product Manager\r\n{panel}",

It would be nice to be able to add a monthly, reoccurring task based off the day of the week. Our IT department uses Team Calendar heavily and this was the feature they asked us the very first day when we requested them to switch from Outlook to Team Calendar. We have our Production Code Push every second Saturday of the month and there are other events that occur every 3rd Saturday and some every 4th Saturday. We might be the only one requesting this feature. Since Atalassian listens to the feedback from every customer, i am creating this feature request. This might be not get as many votes. But, if you feel like, this is a genuine request, please implement this feature. I have attached the screenshots showing how the monthly recurrence pattern shows in Team Calendars as well as Outlook. \r\n\r\nThanks\r\nAdhip",

An Event calendar can be associated with a user, however that user information is not easily seen on the Event calendar without clicking into the Event.\r\n\r\nWe use Calendars for our support on-call rotation. Prior to version 4 we had a People calendar called \"On Call\" which clearly indicated who was on call for a given week. We've totally lost that ability with Calendars 4. I can name an Event \"On Call\" and associate the user with that week of support duty, but you have to click twice (once on the event, then edit) to actually see the name of the person that's on call.\r\n\r\nThis is a significant feature degradation from the 3.2.x version of Calendars.\r\n\r\nSo, as a user I would like an Event calendar that's associated with a user to clearly display the user on the calendar so that I don't have to click twice to get this information.\r\n\r\nAs an aside, I realize that there's \"Leave\" and \"Birthday\" calendars which are more analogous to the old People calendar, but since they are hard coded with those names it would be totally unintuitive to use them for any other purpose, such as an on call calendar.",

For example, when today is March 1, I can see everything that is upcoming for the next 4 weeks but then when today is March 27 the \"month\" view is showing mostly the past several weeks, which has been cluttered with a lot of no longer relevant details. This is a very common usability problem in calendar apps. \r\n\r\nIt would be nice if there were another view mode of 'next 4 weeks', with the current week always on top. That way, the calendar is always showing the upcoming schedule not the past schedule.\r\n\r\nThere's a similar request for Outlook:\r\nhttp://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/office/en-US/acd04b88-6890-4bac-8f48-3028085ed2bd/outlook-2010-view-calendar-view-for-weeks-ahead-not-weeks-past?forum=outlook\r\n\r\n",

Then, have the ability to expand the calendar downward, either by dragging (like this comment box) or by adding extra space via a button.\r\n\r\nSo if you have a huge amount of tasks currently on your timeline, you will be able to see as many as you want, rather than be limited once they hit the top of the allowed space.\r\n\r\nRecap:\r\n1) Add ability to put calendar axis at top of timeline instead of bottom\r\n2) Add ability to control vertical size of timeline",

Problem Definition\r\nCurrently the both the timeline and calendar views have their horizontal sizes fixed, regardless the size of the page and the resolution of the screen. As a result, Team Calendars displayed on bigger screens or in a 90% rotation don't use the screen space efficiently, e.g.:\r\n!Screen Shot 2015-06-18 at 13.29.58.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\nIt would be great to have the autosizing for the Team Calendar views. This would be more comfortable, e.g. when displaying the timeline view page with a big screen with number of events, showing the calendars on a vertically rotated screen.",

When you first log in to a new Team Calendars instance, you're presented with a getting started dialog. The second area is the WorkBox notification, when Team Calendars has been installed or upgraded, users are notified via WorkBox and that notification includes the old Team Calendars logo.\r\n\r\nThis doesn't have to get done by August 27th, but would be good to slip into TC 4 if it's just a quick fix. I've attached the logo to this ticket.",

When you click on an event in team calendars the detail box pops up and shows the description and gives you the option to edit the event. Next to the edit link there could be a link that says \"Add to Outlook\" that would export the event into a file and would make it easy to add to the person's personal event. Then we could leverage outlook's reminder functionality and the event will be right in their personal calendar.\r\n\r\nThanks for all the hard work and hope this one gets in there!\r\n-Aaron",

Problem summary\r\nThere are certain functions in Team Calendars that relies on the Base URL to be set correctly in order to work. If the user connects to Confluence/Team Calendars using a URL that is different from what is set in Confluence Admin > General Configurations > Base URL, some of the functionalities might be broken.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that when users run into a base URL mismatch problem, they are not presented with any useful information to hint that the URL is the cause. Consequently, this makes it difficult for administrators to troubleshoot the problem. This improvement request is for Team Calendars to display a more useful error when there's a base URL mismatch.\r\n\r\nh3. Examples\r\nDepending on your Confluence/TC version, you may encounter vague errors such as the ones described in this KB:\r\nhttps://confluence.atlassian.com/display/CONFKB/Team+Calendars+Shows+Nondescript+Error+Box+or+%27No+Transport%27+Error\r\n\r\nIf you are using Team Calendars 4 or above, and have integrated with JIRA, trying to add JIRA events with a mismatched base URL will result in the necessary JIRA fields not showing up. Clicking \"OK\" also will do nothing. Compare the following screenshots for details:\r\n* When the correct base URL is used: [^righturl.png]\r\n* When the wrong base URL is used: [^wrongurl.png]",
