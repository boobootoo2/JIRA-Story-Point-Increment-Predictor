Such a definition would enable a page to contain expandable and collapsable blocks of lists. Nesting of lists should be supported. Also having the ability to edit the page in WYSIWYG Outline Mode would greatly enhance the usability of the app.\r\n\r\nMacro Features:\r\n- Property: startClosed - (bool, Optional, def: false) - If true, all lists under the current list node would start of as closed\r\n- Allow for nesting. Outline macros can be defined within Outline macros.\r\n- Should be able to wrap headings as well as lists.\r\n- Both Headings and lists items should be expandable.\r\n- (Phase2+) Allow for WYSIWYG Outline Editing :-)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n- This feature should follow the \"One Pane\" view such as that in Omni Outliner (OSX), and Ecco Pro (Win).  See http://john.redmood.com/organizers.html for information on Outline types.\r\n- The main difficulty of WYSIWYG Outlining with a web browser is capturing of Tab and Shift-Tab for indent control from keyboard which is very important feature. Not sure if this is possible with web browsers... Maybe switch to alt-tab, alt-shift-ta b(or) alt-tilde (~).\r\n\r\n\r\n",

The InputStreamResult picks up on that (like the RssFeed - see CONF-7547) and then writes the data straight out.\r\n\r\nThe content type and disposition can be set by the action.

This result type is handled by a confluence class called RssResult which looks up the SyndFeed like this:\r\n\r\nSyndFeed feed = (SyndFeed) actionInvocation.getStack().findValue(\"syndFeed\");\r\n\r\n\r\nIf there was a RssFeed interface which has a \"SyndFeed getSyndFeed()\" contract,  then the code could look like this:\r\n\r\nSyndFeed feed = null;\r\nAction action = actionInvocation.getAction();\r\nif (action instanceof RssFeed) {\r\n    feed = ((RssFeed) action).getSyndFeed();\r\n}\r\n\r\nThe main benefit is that the stack doesn't absorb any exceptions - which are filtered out by the \"findValue(String)\" method on the Stack, as although they are logged they don't make it out to the browser like typical action plugin exceptions. For an example of what Id prefer to see, throw a RuntimeException from the execute() method of an action.\r\n\r\nAnother benefit is a clearer contract - I had to hack open the RssResult in order to reverse engineer what I needed to do. The fact that I had to implement a getSyndFeed method was not clear from looking at the confluence RSS generators as a template - I would have picked up on a well named interface much quicker.\r\n\r\nIf you make the interface match the current requirements, finding the usages and refactoring should be trivial.",

Click \"Edit\" to go back to the editor. \r\nIn Comment Editor: \"Cancel\" will show a confirmation dialog to warn that comments will be lost. \r\n\r\nThis will be available in the upcoming Confluence release (5.7) - within a couple of months and will also be available to Cloud (previously OnDemand) customers within a few weeks. Stay tuned. \r\n----\r\n\r\nThank you for your suggestions and feedback on this issue. We acknowledge this issue is causing pain & inconvenience.

At present, the macro prints thin horizontal lines between each page containing a target label on the results list. When using the macro only to display page titles, this reduces readability on long lists.  Because the visual style does not match the style link lists created manually or using the children macro, it also looks bad when used in the same page as with other link title lists. If a user specifies lines=false, no lines are printed.\r\n\r\n2) Enable maxResults=-1 to disable a limit on the number of results\r\n\r\n3) Add a new titlebylabel macro which is the contentbylabel macro with the following defaults:\r\n\r\nmaxResults=-1\r\nshowLabels=false\r\nshowSpace=false\r\ntype=page\r\nlines=false\r\n",
