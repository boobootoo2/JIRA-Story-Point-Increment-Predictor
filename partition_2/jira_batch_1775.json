It would be great to be able to specify page watchers when creating a new blog post (just like specifying email recipients). Once the blog is saved, watchers would be notified right away.\r\n\r\nI know that users can watch all blogs in a given space, but that is not as convenient because the watcher then can't unsubscribe from the blogs they don't want to track.\r\n\r\nThanks and keep up the good work on Confluence.",

Please find a screenshot in attachment. \r\n\r\nBut some efforts needed.\r\n\r\nFirst, insert into /decorators/global.wmd  code\r\n{code}\r\n<content tag=\"tree\">\r\nsome users macro....\r\n</content>\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nThis action adds Splitbar to dashboard. But, when we are on Dashboard, Space is undefined. That is why error raising when rendering left menu on Dashboard.\r\n\r\nTo fix this, open doctheme.jar/doctheme/decorators/main.wmd\r\nFind the following code fragment\r\n{code}\r\n#if ($!docThemeHelper.getThemeHeader($spaceKey)!=\"\")\r\n    $!sitemeshPage.getProperty(\"page.theme-header\")\r\n#end\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nand replace it with:\r\n{code}\r\n#if ($spaceKey)\r\n    #if ($!docThemeHelper.getThemeHeader($spaceKey)!=\"\")\r\n        $!sitemeshPage.getProperty(\"page.theme-header\")\r\n    #end\r\n#end\r\n{code}\r\n\r\n\r\nSo, we need to make these changes every time when DocTheme updates. It will be nice to fix it and relax.\r\n\r\nBy the way, where does doctheme jar file lives after plugin installation? Usually it appears inside atlassian-bundled-plugins.zip in confluence-4.0/confluence/WEB-INF/classes/com/atlassian/confluence/setup.

Right now I can do something like this:\r\n\r\n1. Show all content where label = first OR label = second OR label = third\r\n2. Show all content where label = first AND label = second AND label = third\r\n\r\nWhat I would like to do is something like this:\r\n\r\n1. Show all content where (label = first AND label = second AND label = third) AND Not label = forth\r\n\r\nBasically that would like pages with all of those labels but not pages that include the final label. The use case for this is that we have built a nice page that shows all of our projects tagged with different labels that describe information about those projects such as priority. What I would like is when a label 'archive' is added to a page it will then automatically not show up on the project page. The old labels need to stay on the page for historical purposes.\r\n\r\nNote that this was submitted to support via this link: https://support.atlassian.com/browse/CSP-73759",

At the moment it only applies to headers and paragraphs. We should generalise the logic to apply not to particular blocks but to when the cursor is after a text node (allowing it to apply here as well). \r\n\r\nThis is only apparent now because we are autoformatting macros.
