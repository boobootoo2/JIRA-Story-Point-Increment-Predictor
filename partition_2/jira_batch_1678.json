This happens since our last upgrade of Confluence.\r\nThe issue occurs as soon as the page layout gets changed from a 100% layout to something like a 50/50 (or any other) split. If the layout gets changed back, the scrollbar disappears. \r\nThis is considered unnecessary as the page would display just fine without the scrollbar.\r\n\r\nWe already searched the knowledge base and found a similar issue in an old version. See https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONF-31653 \r\n\r\nWe already tested this with the latest versions of IE, FF and Chrome and it appears to be not a browser issue.\r\n\r\nWe already tried to solve this with updating to the latest patch of Confluence but the issue still persists.\r\n\r\nCould you please help us with this?\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nBest Regards\r\nG\u00fcrkan",

Issue summary\r\n\r\nConfluence super user or \"confluence-administrators\" group cannot find restricted page via quick search but are able to access the page anyways with direct links.\r\n Quick search query will not return any restricted page unless the restricted page has been accessed by the super user at least once.\r\n * On newer version of Confluence (tested on Confluence 6.6 and Confluence 7.3.1), the page remains unsearchable even viewing the restricted page.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Create a standard user under the group *confluence-users* (let's say User A).\r\n # Login as User A.\r\n # Create a public space or personal space.\r\n # Restrict view space permission to User A only.\r\n # Create a page and restrict view permission to User A only (optional).\r\n # Login as super user or user from the *confluence-administrators* group.\r\n # Search User A's content in *Quick Search*.\r\n # Observe the results.\r\n\r\nh4. Expected Behaviour\r\n\r\nQuick search should return restricted page due to the access rights as described [here|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/CONF56/Site+Administrators+and+their+Permissions].\r\nh4. Actual Behaviour\r\n\r\nQuick search will only return restricted page when it has been accessed before.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Before restricted page is accessed\r\n !before.png|thumbnail! !beforeaccess2.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\n\u2022 After restricted page is accessed\r\n !afteraccess1.png|thumbnail! !afteraccess2.png|thumbnail! \r\n !after.png|thumbnail!",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFCLOUD-36388].\n  {panel}\n\nHi \r\n\r\nWe had some trouble regarding compatibility with Confluence  5.7 and our Theme add-on Enterprise Theme [1].\r\n\r\nThe main reasons where UI related with your new feature Inline Commenting.\r\nBecause of a different DOM in our Theme and the fact that you are adding the right padding directly to the #content element (without using a css class :( ), the Theme looked ugly, because in our theme the inline style has to be at another place. \r\n\r\nIn the pre versions wasn't any event which we could listen on, so that we where not able to fix that layout issue. In the release version you added a set of new events, fired by Backbone, which gives us a chance to fix the layout - Thank you! \r\n\r\nBut events are sometimes lazy and inline styles aren't such a good way - so I just like to ask you, if it's possible to change this implementation in using a css class on the body like \"has-inline-comments-panel\" or something else, where the padding is connected to. \r\n\r\nThis will make the integration of the inline commenting more easy. \r\n\r\nThank you \r\nOliver Straesser\r\n\r\n[1] https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/net.getunik.confluence.skin.core\r\n\r\n\r\n",

When I specify to show Linked Issues in my JIRA Issue macro list, the column does not include linked Confluence pages.  Perhaps this column is not the best spot for such information, perhaps a separate column called Linked Pages or Linked Sites would be preferable, but I would absolutely love the ability to show linked pages for each of the JIRA issues in my list using the inbuilt macro.  \r\n\r\nAny other workarounds for this situation would be gladly appreciated.",
