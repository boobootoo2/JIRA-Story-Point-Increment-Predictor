In the example @naonymous posted on November 1, there was not a 'unique ID/task numbers' (I don't know what the official term for them might be) associated with each task, as @anonymous DID have in the above example. These numbers can only be seen in wiki markup by the way. I had also experienced some unusual behavior, and found it occurred when these ID values were not present. \r\n\r\nI could consistently reproduce the creation of tasklsts without these ID numbers when using the Macro Browser.  However, if done the 'traditional way' (e.g. entering the word 'tasklist' in curly brackets), and then creating each task on the Rich Text page, the IDs are automatically and consistently created.  Possibly a bug in the Macro Browser creation of tasklists?\r\n\r\nThose IDs apparently have something to do with the tasklist macro behaving correctly, so I'd be curious to know if the above behavior can be replicated by others.  Thanks.\r\n{quote}",

Your instance is capable of generating automatic support requests that include your log files, environment information and more. This information helps the support team give you a quicker and more effective response.\r\n\r\nThis feature can be found in your Administration Console. For more information please see the directions for Raising a Support Request.\r\n\r\nPlease consider using this feature if possible rather than manually creating the issue here.\r\n\r\n(2) From your KB article at http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Troubleshooting+Problems+and+Requesting+Technical+Support (and I quote):\r\n\r\n* Method 1: (Recommended.) Raise a support ticket directly via our support site on the Internet, as described below. Then create a support zip file using the Support Utility, also described below. The advantage of this method is that it includes all the relevant files that Confluence support need. You can also be sure that the support case has been created and includes your logs.\r\n\r\n* Method 2: Complete the support request form via your Confluence Administration Console, as described below. The disadvantage of this method is that your mail may not be forwarded correctly, due to restrictions imposed by your mail server. For example, the zip of your log files might be too large for your mail server to forward them on.\r\n\r\n(3) When attempting to do so using the built-in Support Utility feature (and I quote):\r\n\r\nPlease consider using this feature if possible rather than manually creating the issue here.\r\n\r\nWhen using the built-in Support Utility feature:\r\n\r\nIf you cannot download the support zip and upload it to the support case, or cannot create a support case at http://support.atlassian.com, you may prefer to create a support request via the confluence administration. However, please note that this should only be done if you cannot create a support request or download the support zip (created above), as your mail server may not forward the message properly or in a timely manner, thus making the process more error prone than manually attaching the support zip to the case\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nh4. Proposed correction\r\nIn [Raising a Support Request|http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Troubleshooting+Problems+and+Requesting+Technical+Support#TroubleshootingProblemsandRequestingTechnicalSupport-RaisingaSupportRequest], 'Method 2' should be the recommended way instead of 'Method 1'. This would bring it all into one line. And this does assume that raising it via the Admin Console is indeed Atlassian's preferred approach.",

Maybe only do this when requested by admins.\r\n\r\n3) both  (since option 1 isn't immune to doStuffWithStream implementations blocking forever.)",

      "description": "In Internet Explorer - tested in IE8 - flash objects and other embedded content on a page appear above drop-down menus, such as Add and Tools, making it difficult to navigate or take actions on the document.\r\n\r\nThis is a longstanding IE issue (see Adobe KB about the [problem|http://kb2.adobe.com/cps/155/tn_15523.html] and a [solution|http://kb2.adobe.com/cps/142/tn_14201.html]) where flash content, as well as other embedded content, is rendered without observing the z-index values of other content on a page.  Therefore, as can be seen from the attached screenshots, the drop-down menus will display behind flash content.\r\n\r\nThe suggested solution would be to add additional wmode parameters to the embed, as outlined in the \"solution\" link above. This would solve the problem if someone embeds a video that has been uploaded locally, using wiki markup such as:\r\n{{\\!monkey_scream.mp4\\!}}\r\n\r\nFor example, the local video, monkey_scream.mp4, when uploaded and added to a page is embedded with the following code:\r\n{{<div class=\"embeddedObject\"><object width=\"480\" height=\"380\" type=\"application/octet-stream\" data=\"/download/attachments/425996/monkey_scream.mp4?version=1&amp;modificationDate=1291229830392\" codebase=\"https://www.apple.com/qtactivex/qtplugin.cab\" classid=\"clsid:02BF25D5-8C17-4B23-BC80-D3488ABDDC6B\"><param value=\"/download/attachments/425996/monkey_scream.mp4?version=1&amp;modificationDate=1291229830392\" name=\"data\"><param value=\"/download/attachments/425996/monkey_scream.mp4?version=1&amp;modificationDate=1291229830392\" name=\"src\"><param value=\"application/octet-stream\" name=\"type\"><embed width=\"480\" height=\"380\" type=\"application/octet-stream\" src=\"/download/attachments/425996/monkey_scream.mp4?version=1&amp;modificationDate=1291229830392\" pluginspage=\"https://www.apple.com/quicktime/download/\"></object></div>}}\r\n\r\nIf we modify the above code by adding necessary wmode params it will look like this:\r\n{{<div class=\"embeddedObject\"><object width=\"480\" height=\"380\" type=\"application/octet-stream\" data=\"/download/attachments/425996/monkey_scream.mp4?version=1&amp;modificationDate=1291229830392\" codebase=\"https://www.apple.com/qtactivex/qtplugin.cab\" classid=\"clsid:02BF25D5-8C17-4B23-BC80-D3488ABDDC6B\"><param value=\"/download/attachments/425996/monkey_scream.mp4?version=1&amp;modificationDate=1291229830392\" name=\"data\"><param value=\"/download/attachments/425996/monkey_scream.mp4?version=1&amp;modificationDate=1291229830392\" name=\"src\"><param value=\"application/octet-stream\" name=\"type\">*<param name=\"wmode\" value=\"transparent\"></param>*<embed width=\"480\" height=\"380\" type=\"application/octet-stream\" src=\"/download/attachments/425996/monkey_scream.mp4?version=1&amp;modificationDate=1291229830392\" pluginspage=\"https://www.apple.com/quicktime/download/\" *wmode=\"transparent\"*></object></div>}}\r\n\r\nHowever, this problem is compounded by the way we handle embeds of external content, using the Widget macro.  This macro inserts an iframe of the embedded flash content, rather than inserting the flash object directly in the page.  I'm not sure if an iframe is used for convenience or for some sort of XSS security protection. Either way, this creates a crappy user experience when doing something as common as embedding an external video.",
