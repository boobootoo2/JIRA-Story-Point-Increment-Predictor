      "description": "We're using Kerberos, and so the \"/\" is required to define the realm of our users.\r\n\r\nHowever, when a user with a \"/\" in their username goes to create a personal space, they get a Confluence \"page not found\" page. For example, for a user name of \"asdf/realm\" would have this link to their personal space: https://bw-wiki.ncsa.uiuc.edu/display/~asdf/realm\r\n\r\nIf I manually point the browser to the correctly escaped link: \"https://bw-wiki.ncsa.uiuc.edu/display/~asdf%2frealm\" I get an apache \"Not Found\" error.\r\n\r\nThe link that is automatically generated by confluence is: https://bw-wiki.ncsa.uiuc.edu/display/~asdf%202frealm\r\nWhich is doubly escaping the \"/\", once to get to %2f, and then to %202f to escape the percent sign.\r\n\r\nPlease check where you're escaping your characters. Also, is it possible, even after proper escaping, to have a personal space for users with \"/\" in their usernames?",

For example when Hibernate lazy loads collections it might end up loading objects from the database that are already in the cache anyway.

But we can avoid the put() if we check with a lockless get() if the object is already in the cache. If it is there is no need update it because updates are not handled by calling put(), but by calling afterInsert() or afterUpdate() on the CoherenceCacheStrategy.",
