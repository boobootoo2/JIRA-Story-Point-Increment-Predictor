Now, with the conversion to Macro Browser, I was surprised to learn that unless the parameter is enter in the exact case configured for the macro browser, the value does not show in the corresponding entry in the macro browser. However, it does retain the older value as a different parameter passed to the implementation. This is confusing to the user who gets the correct compatible behavior, but when they go into the macro browser, the value does not appear correctly.",

The ability to add arbitrary parameters is needed. Perhaps a macro needs to specifically request this support, but I would prefer it could be enabled for all macros. The former wiki macro parameter format would be the text. The parameters should come into the macro implementation just like other parameters.  \r\n\r\nIt is nice that when parameters are enter via insert wiki mark up they are retained, however, they cannot be updated and are mostly invisible unless they appear first. This improvement would make them changeable.\r\n\r\nh4. Why?\r\n# A number of macros allow arbitrary, user specified parameter names to control the macro processing - *groovy*, other scripting macros, *xslt*, the table based plugins (like table-plus, sql) etc... . \r\n# Some macros are missing entries in the macro browser - most notably the noformat macro :( - see CONF-25429. This would provide a nice workaround until the macros are improved\r\n\r\nh4. Workaround\r\nTell people to use insert wiki. I probably will have to add a parameter called *other parameters* to a bunch of macros :(.\r\n",

Symptoms\r\n\r\nConfluence does not do any sniffing on the upload of an image, so it's possible to rename the file extension on an image, and it will upload into Confluence without any warnings or errors. This image will then be stored in Confluence with a different mime type to the data contained in the file.\r\n\r\nThis was never much of a problem for us, as the browser would sniff the type and display it properly even if we gave it the wrong mime type. Since 4.3.2 however, Confluence now specifies the \"nosniff\" directive in the HTTP headers, which causes IE to not display these images because the mime type does not match.\r\n\r\nh4. Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n# Find any image file\r\n# Rename the image to some other image extension besides what the data actually is\r\n# Upload the file to Confluence\r\n# Open the page in IE, observe the \"X\" displayed in place of the image\r\n\r\nh4.

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFCLOUD-26809].\n  {panel}\n\nIn our environment pages are used for tracking and journaling, so after creating a page, it is often subject to many edits from many different clients. In order to prevent draft/versioning hell, it would be nice to have the option for one user to \"request\" that a page be saved before starting to edit a page. It would work the following way:\r\n\r\n1 - Tom starts to edit page PAGE. While editing, Tom opens up his email client to look for something (or looks up something on the web or something else where he is not actively editing the page), but forgets (or does not bother) to click the save page button.\r\n2 - Jane clicks to edit PAGE. \r\n--------- Right now, the user has the option to resume the last saved draft of PAGE made by Tom. However, if Jane resumes the draft from where Tom left of, there will likely be a conflict when Tom continues to edit and then saves his page.\r\n--------- Instead, we propose that Jane is given the choice to \"request Tom to save page and finish editing\". Which he invokes. (An active info-box pops up, with text \"Please wait while requesting Tom to save page\" together with a countdown timer...\r\n3 - The following info/choice box is displayed to Tom: \"Jane would like to edit this page and has requested that you save and finish editing. Is that ok?\", with two buttons: \"Yes, save and finish\" and \"No, continue edit\" -- and perhaps a text area where Tom can reply to Jane if he selects no. There should also be a count-down timer---in case Tom is away from his computer and unable to reply, in which case \"Yes, save and finish\" should be selected after e.g. 30 seconds.\r\n4 - Tom clicks \"yes, finish edit\" (or timer runs out), and Tom's web-browser saves the page.\r\n5 - Jane is informed that Tom has saved the page and after approx 3-5 seconds, she is forwarded to edit the page. Alternatively, if Tom clicks \"No, continue edit\", Jane is presented with Tom's reply (e.g. \"hold on for 1 minute, I just found this very important information which I'm adding right now...\")\r\n\r\nNote: \"Info pop-up box\" does not have to be the old \"new window\" kind of pop-up or a static \"info box\". A floating area similar to the \"notification area\"/\"work box\" would probably work better.\r\n\r\n\r\nA special use-case of this is if Tom is editing a page but then leaves his workstation briefly. While away from his workstation, he remembers something he wants to add to the page he was editing, therefore picks up his iPad/tablet and continues editing. This time, of course, there is no other user to account for, and when Tom starts editing the page from his iPad, his workstation should just save the page. Specifically, when Tom clicks to edit the page on his iPad (or perhaps even when he is just viewing the page), he is given the choice to \"save my draft and continue from this device\". Clicking this, an info-box pops up, informing him to \"Please wait while saving draft on other device...\" and when his workstation's draft is saved he is automatically forwarded to edit the page.",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFCLOUD-26794].\n  {panel}\n\nA cool feature would be to allow users to annotate text on a confluence page on the fly, and allow other users to comment on the annotation.  \r\n\r\nTo annotate:\r\nUser selects text. A tiny box saying \"Annotate\" will appear.  Clicking the box will allow the user to add annotation text/pictures. \r\n\r\nTo read annotations:\r\nUser mouses over text with annotations, and an annotation indicator appears. User clicks on the text itself, and annotations popup in an inline window.  Include logic to avoid overlapping other text if possible.\r\n\r\nTo comment on annotations:\r\nInside the annotation popup, a user adds comments at the bottom.\r\n\r\nI got this idea from Rapgenius.com, which allows users to read song lyrics, and then add their opinions on what a text means, and also submit their comments on the annotation.\r\n\r\nI find this idea a more elegant annotation method than using parenthesed text (like this) or using the info/note/warning box (which is unnecessary in some circumstances, and the formatting of it, especially in bulleted lists, is ugly).  Also, as a reader, if I have specific comments/questions about a specific paragraph, I'd like to be able to ask them ON the text itself.  The comments section at the bottom is...well at the bottom, not near the text I'm commenting about.  Other readers may have the same question and may not see those annotations until the bottom.",
