      "description": "This supersedes CONF-27023, whereby the fallback mechanism of editor loading is broken.\r\n\r\nAlthough we are fixing the worst part of that issue in 5.5.1, there will still be Confluence instances where the editor loads very slowly.\r\n\r\nThis can happen for a variety of reasons but the most common one is when the editor resource batching falls apart due to a plugin.  This is technical and complex.\r\n\r\nThe editor quick-loading works by fetching the additional javascript and css resources required to show the editor, after the page has loaded.  These are fetched as a couple of batches (eg batch.js and batch.css), so there aren't very many individual js and css files downloaded to show the editor.  The batches are cacheable, improving things further.\r\n\r\nHowever, if some of the resources in the editor batch were already required to view the page, then the batch provider takes drastic action.  It doesn't want to give out a batch that contains a resource that's already been loaded, because then it would be loaded twice, which could break things.  So, it unbatches the batch and provides the resources individually.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the dynamic editor loading has to download dozens of resources instead of 4-6, which takes much longer.\r\n\r\nThis is usually because a plugin, either Atlassian or 3rd party, is misbehaving in a very subtle way.\r\n\r\nh3. How to determine why the comment editor loading is slow:\r\n\r\n*These steps are currently slightly unverified but should work* - if you run into any issues let us know in the comments below.\r\n\r\n# Navigate to a page where the comment editor is known to load slowly\r\n# Open the javascript console of your browser.\r\n# Execute \r\n{code}AJS.$(AJS.$('meta[name=\"ajs-editor.loader.resources\"]').attr('content')).filter('script').size()\r\nAJS.$(AJS.$('meta[name=\"ajs-editor.loader.resources\"]').attr('content')).filter('link').size(){code}\r\n# If these do not return small numbers, less than about 6, then your resources are unbatched (this is bad).\r\n# Turn up logging on the server for com.atlassian.plugin.webresource.assembler.DefaultWebResourceAssembler to DEBUG\r\n# Visit a page and do a hard refresh\r\n# Find the line in the server logs that looks like this\r\nbq. \"The module '<some module>' has already been included in the Assembler. Inclusion contexts = <some contexts>, required contexts = <some more contexts>\"\r\n# Determine which plugin is requiring the <some module>.  If you're lucky it's obvious.  If you're unlucky, you might need to turn off a lot of plugins to stop it happening.  If this happens on specific pages, try removing the macros used on those pages to see if the logging stops.\r\nIf you don't see this logging, then your older version of Confluence probably doesn't have that logging.  Talk to support to confirm that, they might just need to find a different class to increase logging for, and upgrade to a newer version.\r\n# Report the problem to the plugin developer. If this is Atlassian, let us know in a comment below.  They may need to use separate resources for the editor and view page. Or they may just need to use resource contexts instead of using resources directly.\r\n\r\n",

      "description": "This affects JIRA 6.3-OD3 (probably some previous releases too, but I haven't verified this).\r\n\r\nThe BackOffScheduler class calls scheduler.shutdown() but this doesn't have effect as threads inside this scheduler are waiting on empty queue, so scheduler won't shutdown. Possible solution is to call shutdownNow() instead. This will work, but it probably will loose any events that are queued (if there are any). On the other hand, JIRA/plugin system is going down when this method is called, so we can't do much here... It might be worth to perform flush before shutdown. Anyway, scheduler need to be terminated.\r\n\r\nAs the scheduler is not properly shutdown, it still runs after destroy was called. Due to that the thread holds reference to class loader, and pico container cannot be fully freed - 20MB of memory is still hold.\r\n\r\nPlease also add name for that thread - it's easier to analyse memory dumps then. For example:\r\n\r\n{code}newScheduledThreadPool(3, ThreadFactories.namedThreadFactory(\"MyworkPlugin-BackOffScheduler\"));{code}\r\n\r\nAlso as this code is in common module, I guess that this problem will also affect confluence.\r\n\r\nJIRA uses 1.8 version of mywork plugin, but problem still exists in master version. I don't know if JIRA can use latest version of mywork plugin.\r\n\r\nBTW, does this code supports 4 and more application links? I'm afraid it won't work for 4+ application link (as all 3 threads will wait on queues). But I didn't analysed it further, so feel free to raise separate issue if that's true ;).",
