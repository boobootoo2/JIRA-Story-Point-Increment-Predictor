However, dups still appear in @ mentions and other places.When dups show in @ mentions, the dup will show as \"Unknown user (<username>) (<username>)\r\n{quote}\r\nThe process of cleaning the database of duplicated users includes exhaustive SQL queries, and the SQL queries sometimes does not work due to differences between database usages and Confluence versions.\r\nh1. Suggestions\r\n\r\nIt'll be great if we include some kind of tool to \"cleanup\" the database in the application. We can add a \"hidden\" admin function just like \"Rebuild Ancestor Table\" action ([Rebuilding the Ancestor Table - Atlassian Documentation|https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/rebuilding-the-ancestor-table-153948.html])\r\n\r\nIs it possible to place a null constraint on lower_username?

This mismatch will cause troubles when we try to create any foreign keys from new NVARCHAR2 columns to old VARCHAR2 columns or vice versa.\u00a0Some\u00a0of our upgrade tasks in 5.9\u00a0do exactly this.\r\n\r\nNot all Oracle-backed instances are affected by this bug\u00a0because\u00a0the dialect change just applied to new installations.\u00a0Only when you\u00a0updated the dialect manually to\u00a0*OracleIntlDialect* in confluence.cfg.xml.\r\nh1. How to check if your instances are affected by this bug?\r\n\r\nYou will be affected by this bug if all below conditions are met\r\n # Your instance has been *using Oracle* ever since.\r\n # Your instance was setup using a version\u00a0*smaller than 5.5* e.g. 5.4, 2.5, etc...\r\n # You've updated Hibernate dialect to use\u00a0*net.sf.hibernate.dialect.OracleIntlDialect* in <CONFLUENCE_HOME_DIR>/*confluence.cfg.xml*\r\n # You're trying to upgrade Confluence either\r\n\r\n||From version||To version||\r\n|Any versions smaller than 5.9.1|5.9.1 or later|\r\n|5.9.1 or 5.9.2|5.9.3 or later|\r\n\r\nh1. Workaround\r\n\r\nThere are 2 options (please restore your database to pre-upgrade state before applying any of these):\r\n # Just revert the Hibernate dialect to use\u00a0*net.sf.hibernate.dialect.Oracle9Dialect*\u00a0in <CONFLUENCE_HOME_DIR>/confluence.cfg.xml then run the upgrade as normal. Highly recommended, but only do this if you *have no plan to upgrade Confluence to version 6.1 or higher before this bug is properly fixed*.\r\n # Run a set of queries to convert existing text columns from VARCHAR2 to NVARCHAR2. See [https://confluence.atlassian.com/kb/confluence-upgrade-fails-because-oracle-could-not-complete-schema-update-838275652.html].\u00a0There will be some failed queries because of existing foreign key constraints, you need to disable them first, convert the columns then enable them again.",

Note, this option is not available for 5.8.18 as the highest compatible version of UPM is 2.21.5.

      "description": "\u00a0\r\n\r\nh5. Current behavior\r\nConfluence allocates temporary LOBs but doesn't seem to release/free them if they are no longer used when using *datasource connection*. Therefore the space in the temporary tablespace, which is allocated by such temporary LOBs, is never freed unless the corresponding database session is terminated (e.g. by restarting the application). Over the time the application allocates more and more temporary LOBs and thereby allocates more and more space in the database's temporary tablespace. Since on the other hand, the application doesn't release old/no longer used temporary LOBs, this eventually causes those temporary LOBs to use up all the space available in the database's temporary tablespace.\r\n\r\nIncreasing the size of the temporary tablespace won't solve this issue. Because no matter how large the temporary tablspace is, if the application continues to allocate new space (by creating new temporary LOBs) without ever freeing some of this space, even the largest temporary tablespace will eventually end up being completely used up. The only thing that can be achieved by increasing the size of the temporary tablespace is to increase the time it takes for that tablespace to eventually run out of space. In other words, a larger temporary tablespace would allow for the application to run for a longer time before hitting the ORA-1652 error, but eventually it would still hit that error - no matter how large the temporary tablespace is.\r\n\r\nWhile restarting the application on a regular schedule (and thereby terminating its database sessions, thus freeing all the space consumed by that sessions' temporary LOBs) might be an acceptable short-term workaround for this issue, it is no acceptable permanent solution. One reason being that doing so might not scale in case of a changed workload (e.g. with a higher workload the application might allocate more temporary LOBs in the same amount of time, which could cause it to hit the ORA-1652 error before it is scheduled to be automatically restarted). Apart from that it it is not exactly common in our organization to regularly re-start applications as a workaround for resource leaks.\r\n\r\nh5. Proposed Solution \r\nA long-term solution for this issue is for the application to programmatically free those temporary LOBs when they are no longer used. One way of doing so in an JDBC application, is invoking the method \"java.sql.NClob.free()\".\r\n\r\nFor more details on freeing temporary LOBs please also refer to the following Oracle documents:df\r\n\r\n\u00a0[^How to Release the Temp LOB Space and Avoid Hitting ORA-1652 (Doc ID 802897.1).pdf][^How to Release Temporary LOB Segments without Closing the JDBC Connection (Doc ID 1384829.1).pdf]",

Steps to Reproduce\r\n# If you copy a string such as \"https://www.mycompany.com/<userid>/<mode>\" into a Confluence page, Confluence automatically converts the string into a URL as it is very similar to a URL.  In this case, however, this string is not a valid URL as it contains two tags at the end since the purpose of this string is to show the format of a URL used for a particular operation.\r\n# While the conversion from a string to a URL is not necessarily a bad thing, if you convert this newly created URL back to plain old text by way of clicking on the URL and then the \"Unlink\", the Unlink function  eliminates the substrings <userid> and <mode> and leaves a string like this: \"https://www.mycompany.com//\"\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Behavior\r\nThe URL-like string is left intact (eg. \"https://www.mycompany.com/<userid>/<mode>\").\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Behavior\r\nThe \"Unlink\" function processes the URL-like string to make it look like a valid URL by changing the original string content.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n# If you have the Confluence Source Editor, you can remove the <a> and </a> tags from around the URL after pasting it into the page.\r\n# Another approach would be to insert the URL as markup.

However, when adding a new restriction to a child page of the parent, those view restrictions are no longer inherited because they are following the restrictions applied to the specific child page. \r\n\r\nThis can be quite confusing for users, because when they go to add edit restrictions to a child page with parent view restrictions, they see the following: \r\n!child_restriction.png|thumbnail!\r\n\"Only some people can edit this page. There are inherited view restrictions\"\r\n\r\nThis serves to confuse users, because this is no longer the case when new restrictions have been added to the sub page.\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\nThere are two options here: \r\n# Remove the text that reads \"Only some people can edit this page. There are inherited view restrictions\" so as not to confuse users. \r\n# Inherit the view permissions of the parent page, but allow users to modify access on the child page. \r\n\r\nh3. Why this is important\r\nAdministrators spend an inordinate amount of time explaining and troubleshooting this. It appears to be a bug, since the message says there are inherited permissions, but when users with access (from the parent page) try to access the sub page, they cannot see it until they have been given explicit access. Moreover, page restrictions serve as a security mechanism and should be made more clear in order to ensure proper lockdown of content. \r\n\r\n",
