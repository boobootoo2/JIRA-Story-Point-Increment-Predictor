The process the customer used involved importing the backup into 2.7.2 and then manually copying the attachments folder across from the Home directory of 1.4.1 to 2.7.2. Everything works fine, except that they could not download any attachments. \r\nRemoving the index directory and re-indexing the entire instance numerous times did not make any difference. \r\n\r\nClearing the browser cache as a precaution also didn't show any change.\r\n\r\nI also examined HTTP headers for the attachment download requests; the http requests are basically the same structure:\r\n/download/attachments/<pageid>/<attachmentname> HTTP 1.1\r\n\r\nI tested the problem locally with 1.4.1, creating an XML backup *with* attachments; the problem also occurs. The prime suspect looks to be that the upgrade Task designed to restructure the attachments directory (first implemented in Confluence 2.2) is no longer working. \r\n\r\nThe directory structure for attachments in 1.4.1 is as follows:\r\n\r\n<Confluence-Home>/attachments/pageID/attachment-name/version\r\n\r\nThe directory structure as of Confluence 2.2. is:\r\n\r\n<Confluence-Home>/attachments/pageID/attachmentID/version\r\n\r\nI haven't identified from which version this was actually broken, so we'll need to identify that.",

A typical error is -\r\n\r\n{noformat}\r\norg.xml.sax.SAXParseException: The string \"--\" is not permitted within comments.\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nIt turns out this is due to the way Xerces is parsing XML resource being read via the resin classloader. Roughly, the XML resource is being supplied in chunks and Xerces seems to think it can sensibly parse incomplete chunks. \r\n\r\nWithout a greater understanding of the exact problem, it would seem that potentially any changes to XML files within the confluence.jar could cause seemingly random XML parse errors in Resin.\r\n\r\nA quick test with xerces 2.9.0 showed that this problem no longer occurs, so we should make sure the rest of the system is happy with this change and upgrade as soon as possible.",

This change in code path has been implemented so that these modules can be manipulated by bean post processors declared in the application context. Unfortunately the computation of point cut shadows that is a part of this process is fairly expensive resulting in slower application start up times.\r\n\r\nCourses of attack:\r\n\r\n* Optimise the pointcut matching operations\r\n* Short circuit the pointcut shadow evaluations, make sure only the necessary bean post processors are activated when the module is created. This might be easily achieved when we start using a separate plugin Spring context.\r\n\r\nClasses affected:\r\n\r\n* {{com.atlassian.confluence.plugin.descriptor.CustomMacroModuleDescriptor}}\r\n* {{com.atlassian.confluence.plugin.ConfluenceModuleDescriptorFactory}}\r\n",

When I add users or groups to a space and then give permissions, it would be nice if there was an \"All\" button, so I don't have to click all the checkboxes. It's not a big deal if you're just adding one, but if you're adding a bunch, it's a pain in the neck to click all the checkboxes for each user or group when it would be pretty easy to add one All javascript checkbox that would then check all the permissions for that user/group.\r\n\r\nThank you.",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFCLOUD-11233].\n  {panel}\n\nThis request is intended to address the problem on confluence.atlassian.com where documentation search results are cluttered by hits from spaces that are not relevant to the vast majority of searchers. For example, all anonymous visitors looking for install assistance for Confluence will see results from the public test space and also many duplicates returned from archival spaces for older versions of Confluence. In particular, a page is often returned 3 times from the Confluence 2.7, 2,6 and 2.5 spaces. This is unprofessional for new users to see and generally makes search less useful. \r\n\r\nA solution is to add an administrative option where anonymous searches by default only search a manually selected list of spaces. This will allow technical writers to choose the latest documentation spaces and exclude rarely used public spaces, with the goal of making the default searches more accurate for anyone looking for product documentation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
