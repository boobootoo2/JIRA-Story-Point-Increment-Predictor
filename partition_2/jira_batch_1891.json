After uploading and activating our global logo, we get random page load failures in Firefox 2.0.0.3. It manifests with Firefox prompting to download the page instead of display it (the content-type is set to application/octet-stream?). If i choose to download, the file does not get saved. I have not managed to reproduce the problem in IE 6. Switching back to the default global logo or turning off the global logo solves the problem. I see no exceptions in the log file (but full debug logging is not enabled). The access log reports no abnormal page responses (just 200, 302, and 304).\r\n\r\nI've attached the file I use.

Plugins can be downloaded, replaced, restarted etc.\r\n\r\nWhy not move just about everything to plugins, and allow them to be upgraded via the plugin repository? This would let the app be self updateable, for all but the most core and basic stuff.\r\nDatabase upgrades could be plugins as well, that run once.\r\n\r\nYou would need a way of grouping plugins so that all the new stuff for each release gets downloaded together as a group - otherwise you would have versioning hell.\r\nProbably need a way of disabling the app while it is all happening too.\r\n\r\nSo the core app is very small, and contains bootstrap code and libs. Everything else is a plugin (included dependent jars?). Once the core app is installed once, all upgrades are done through the plugin manager. \r\n\r\nI wonder if something like osgi (which eclipse is built on now), would be of use here?\r\n\r\nConfluence v3.0 ?

The links are independent, in that the same file name only differing by ', U+0027, U+2019 and U+00B4 are unique.\r\n- however:\r\n-- renaming either the apostrophe (U+0027), backtick (U+00B4) or the e with an accent in \"t\u00e9st.txt\" to test.txt works fine.\r\n-- trying to rename the special character U+2019 gave first a proxy error, then came back with a regular apostrophe (U+0027) in the attachment rename form. After we put in a new name and clicked ok, it told us the file was not found (although the origianl was obviously still there with the U+2019 still in the name).\r\n-- likewise, we can delete the U+0027 or U+00B4 or U+00E9, however, we cannot delete, using the 'remove' button, the attachment with the special backtick character. We get the same error: file not found.\r\n\r\n-- in the rename form, I get this HTML (without the pre tags)\r\n<pre>\r\n<form name=\"moveattachment\" method=\"POST\" action=\"domovepageattachment.action?pageId=9110025&fileName=$generalUtil.urlEncode($attachment.fileName)\">\r\n</pre>\r\n-- where I would normally get\r\n-- <form name=\"moveattachment\" method=\"POST\" action=\"domovepageattachment.action?pageId=9110025&fileName=test.txt\">\r\n-(so the $generalUtil.urlEncode($attachment.fileName) is obviously failing aswell)\r\n- also, pasting \"//pages/removeattachmentonpage.action?pageId=9110025&fileName=test'.txt&version=1\" in the address bar of IE does not work either.\r\n\r\n- This is a copy of the string causing the problem, but I'm not sure if it will make it through JIRA: \"Manager's Roles and Responsibilities\". I'm pretty sure it's a U_2019.\r\n\r\n-- note also: upload using webdav of any of these characters resulted in the sepcial characters being replaced by a 'block' loking character \"t\ufffdst.txt\".\r\n-- these then appear in webdav client (WebDrive) as t?st.txt, and cannot be deleted or accessed through that interface. They can, except for the U+2019, be removed from the web interface)\r\n\r\nBottom Line:\r\n*SO I cannot currently delete or rename any file that contains a U+2019.*\r\n\r\nError:\r\n- error generated:\r\n\"The following error(s) occurred: \r\nThe attachment specified does not exist. \"\r\n\r\nRecommendation:\r\n1) in web app, us the attachment ID to specify name of the attachment to rename or delete, not the text name\r\n2) Either allow U+2019 for all actions, or filter consistantly between upload / rename / remove / webdav\r\n\r\nAppreciation:\r\nThanks very much!\r\n",

My company wants the ability to be able to have pages, regardless of what space they live in that certain people are able to have access to. \r\n\r\nI was a bit disappointed when I started to play with 2.5 and this new page restriction feature because a user has to be part of the Space as a group or individual access in order to view a page that has been restricted to their account. \r\n\r\nFrom an Enterprise perspective I think it is important that if page access has been granted to a user for view and edit they are able to view that page regardless of what space it lives in.  \r\n\r\nThe interface currently allows you to choose any user in the system. This was very deceiving because it implies that I can add any user to a page but that is only true if that user has access to the entire space.  \r\n\r\nMany organization are looking for ways to collaborate with people who are typically not part of their organization, are customers or vendors they work with.
