Issue Summary\r\n\r\nThe *excerpt-include* macro allows you to refer to a page that\u2019s been archived, even though the preview pane shows the error in the screenshot below. An excerpt referenced in this manner shows up correctly in the edit and view mode of the page.\r\n\r\nHowever if you try to do the same thing by using the macro within another macro like {*}Table of Content Zone{*}, the macro breaks with the same error ({_}Error message: \"Error rendering macro 'excerpt-include' : No link could be created for '<SpaceKey>:<Page>'.\"{_}) in the view mode, although it does display the correct content in edit mode.\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # On a page on your instance, use the *excerpt* macro to create an excerpt, and then archive the page.\r\n # On another page, use the *excerpt-include* macro to refer to the page created in step 1. The preview pane of the macro will show an error.\r\n # Save the macro settings and you'll see that the edit mode, as well as the view mode after publishing, show the excerpt.\r\n # Now repeat step 2, but put the *excerpt-include* macro inside another macro like {*}Table of Content Zone{*}.\r\n # You will see that the page renders the excerpt in the edit mode, but breaks with the same as error as in _Preview pane_ in view mode.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nThe *excerpt-include* macro should behave consistently in all scenarios when working with archived pages.\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nThe *excerpt-include* macro works correctly when working with archived pages when it's at the root of the page but breaks when it's nested within another macro\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nThe only workaround is to move the macro out of the nesting, which may not always be the intended use case.",

Steps to Reproduce\r\n # `Hi, we discovered a bug in the Confluence Connect JavaScript API for creating a Dialog.The API is described here:\u00a0<https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/confluence/jsapi/dialog/>When using the function to create a Dialog, like this:AP.dialog.create({key: 'my-module-key'})One possible option is for the key to reference a dialog as described in the app descriptor, which has the schema described here:\u00a0<https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/connect-schemas/raw/master/confluence-global-schema.json>According to the schema, the following dialog description should be valid, as it contains all required fields ('url' and 'key'):dialogs: [{url: \"my-url\", key: \"my-module-key\"}]However, with this description in place, using the dialog.create function results in an error in the UI: \"Unable to retrieve addon module URL. Please check your specified module key.\" as well as an error in the console: \"POST\u00a0<https://marein-alt.atlassian.net/wiki/plugins/servlet/ac/my-app-key/my-module-key>\u00a0404\"This error suggests that there is an error with the module key. In reality, the problem is solved by adding the 'options' field to the descriptor, even if it has just a trivial value:\"dialogs\": [{url: \"my-url\", key: \"my-module-key\", options: {}}]After adding this field, the dialog.create function works as expected.So, apparently there is some logic in the dialog.create function or the module key resolver which depends on the presence of the 'options' field.```\r\nh3.
