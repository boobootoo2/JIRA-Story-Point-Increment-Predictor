Notes\r\n\r\nThe Companion app refers to the default PDF app in macOS to annotate PDF documents. In some cases, the default is\u00a0*Books*. When opening a PDF in\u00a0*Books*\u00a0on macOS, it will redirect to\u00a0*Preview*\u00a0to display the PDF.\r\n\r\nAccording to these Apple Developer forum threads, there is an issue with the\u00a0*Books*\u00a0app serving PDF files.\r\n * [Books app crashing after macOS Catalina 10.15 beta 6 update|https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/121533]\r\n * [Books on MacOS Big Sur not showing my PDFs|https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/659317]\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nFirst, ensure *Books* isn't the default PDF app. To change your default PDF app to *Preview*_,_ right-click the downloaded PDF file, select *Open with...*, and down at the bottom, select *Other...*\u00a0Choose *Preview*\u00a0in Applications, and make sure to check \"Always Open With.\"\r\n\r\n!CleanShot 2021-04-29 at 15.43.59@2x.png|thumbnail! \u00a0 !CleanShot 2021-04-29 at 16.04.31@2x.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nIf you still encounter the issue with\u00a0*Preview*\u00a0on Big Sur, there is no workaround for editing PDFs in the Companion app. Preview is my default in my test case, but the error in the Companion app logs still mentions\u00a0*Books*.",

Given that, following CQL searches are not working as expected:\r\n\r\n* type='ac:questions-answers-for-confluence:reaction' and container = 635601068: returns no results, should return 3 results with reactions above\r\n* type='ac:questions-answers-for-confluence:reaction' and ancestor = 635601068: returns no results, should return 3 results with reactions above\r\n* type='ac:questions-answers-for-confluence:reaction' and ancestor = 633405478: returns no results, should return at least 3 results with reactions above (I\u2019m not interested in this kind of search because it\u2019s too broad as I want to return only reactions with answer 635601068 as direct parent, but this search doesn\u2019t work as expected as well)\r\n\r\nSimilar CQL search that does work (but doesn't help with my issue) is searching for answers based on question ID as container\r\n\r\n* type='ac:questions-answers-for-confluence:answer' and container = 633405478: correctly returns 2 child answers\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nAll 3 CQL searches should return 3 results, according to the definitions of the CQL search fields.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nAll 3 CQL searches return no results.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nCurrently there is no known workaround for this behavior. A workaround will be added here when available",
