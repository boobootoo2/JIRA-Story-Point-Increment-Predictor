Some lines are now empty, with this missing text having been added to a previous list item. \r\n\r\nThis is causing some frustration and delay in my company, and I`d love to see this bug squashed!

      "description": "Mail periodically stops being sent, coinciding with a loss of connection between the Confluence server and the mail server. The emails back up in the Mail Queue, not the Error Queue, and can not be sent. The emails are subsequently lost when the server is restarted.\r\n\r\nNB: In this scenario, sending a test email will still work, because it bypasses the mail queue and is sent directly. \r\n\r\nh3. Cause\r\nMail stops sending because the mail thread cannot connect to the server, and there is no timeout set. Consequently, the mail thread will continue to hang and mails will not be sent, even when the connection is re-established. Confluence sets the timeout to 0 programatically no matter what is specified in the Resource tag, and a 0 value means the thread will never timeout, and can never recover.\r\n\r\nh3. Diagnosis\r\nTo find out if this issue is affecting you, take a couple of [external thread dumps|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Generating+a+Thread+Dump+Externally] while the problem is occurring, spaced around 1 minute apart. If you see a thread that exists across both dumps which looks similar to the one under 'Symptoms' below, and references this method (or something similar eg SMTPMailServerImpl.connect()), then you are running in to this bug:\r\n{code}\r\n\t- locked <0x0000000784505360> (a com.sun.mail.smtp.SMTPTransport)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.mail.server.impl.SMTPMailServerImpl.send(SMTPMailServerImpl.java:166)\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nIf you're unsure of the contents of the thread dump or if you need any help at any stage, feel free to contact [Support|https://support.atlassian.com].\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround 1 - for mail configured directly through the front end of Confluence.\r\nYou will need to add the timeout properties to the database entry directly.\r\n# Shut down Confluence. Unfortunately at this point you will lose any mail that is pending. There is currently no way to avoid this.\r\n# Find the entry in the database:\r\n{code}\r\nselect * from BANDANA where BANDANAKEY = 'atlassian.confluence.smtp.mail.accounts'\r\n{code}\r\n# Copy the entire contents of the BANDANAVALUE column to a text file\r\n# Find the {{<property name=\"mail.smtp.timeout\" value=\"0\"/>}} property and edit it to {{<property name=\"mail.smtp.timeout\" value=\"10000\"/>}} to set a timeout of 10 seconds\r\n# Add this property directly below it to set the connection timeout to 10 seconds : {{<property name=\"mail.smtp.connectiontimeout\" value=\"10000\"/>}}\r\n# You should now have these two lines in the BANDANAVALUE text:\r\n{code}\r\n            <property name=\"mail.smtp.timeout\" value=\"10000\"/>\r\n            <property name=\"mail.smtp.connectiontimeout\" value=\"10000\"/>\r\n{code}\r\n# Insert the value back in to the database *NB: do NOT copy the below query, this is an example only - you must use the full edited BANDANAVALUE you extracted in Step 3*:\r\n{code}\r\nupdate BANDANA set BANDANAVALUE = '<linked-hash-map>\r\n     ....\r\n            <property name=\"mail.smtp.timeout\" value=\"10000\"/>\r\n            <property name=\"mail.smtp.connectiontimeout\" value=\"10000\"/>\r\n     ....\r\n</linked-hash-map>' where BANDANAKEY = 'atlassian.confluence.smtp.mail.accounts';\r\n{code}\r\n# Restart Confluence\r\n\r\n(!) If a new username or password is set through the GUI, the timeout value will be reset back to 0. If you change any of the configuration of the server, you will need to reapply this workaround.\r\n\r\nAlso, if after setting these timeouts, you encounter another connection problem which causes the mail processing to time out, the mails may end up in the Error Queue (Confluence Admin > Mail Queue). You may need to resend them from there.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround 2 - for JNDI mail server resources defined in the server.xml\r\n# Edit the server.xml\r\n# Add these two parameters to the resource tag:\r\n{code}\r\nmail.smtp.timeout=\"10000\"\r\nmail.smtp.connectiontimeout=\"10000\"\r\n{code}\r\n# Restart Confluence\r\n\r\nNB: If, after setting these timeouts, you encounter another connection problem which causes the mail processing to time out, the mails may end up in the Error Queue (Confluence Admin > Mail Queue). You may need to resend them from there.\r\n\r\nh3.

Steps to reproduce:\r\n# Insert a relative link to a Confluence page via Insert > Web Link > Address: /conf43/display/ds/test\r\n# Save the page and you can see that the domain address is appended to the relative path e.g. http://www.atlassian.com/conf43/display/ds/test\r\n\r\nConfluence no longer supports writing a web link as a relative URL, however you can get around this still by inserting a non-web link. If you look at the instructions on [Linking to Pages|https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/uADGDg], the following ways will work effectively as relative links:\r\n\r\n# Adding a link using autocomplete\r\n# Adding a link using the Insert Link dialog (either search or recently viewed)\r\n\r\nThis kind of link does not store the base URL of your Confluence instance, it refers to the page by the (space id, page id) pair. This also means that if the page name changes, then the link will still work. If you left the link text the same as the page name originally, then it should automatically update to the new page name as well.\r\n\r\nWhile the methods described above works for a single page, you cannot use autocomplete or the search to find the rss action page. For instance, you'd like to make a relative link to an rss feed such as this:\r\n{code}\r\n/createrssfeed.action?types=page&spaces=conf_all&title=pagename&labelString=work&excludedSpaceKeys %3D&sort=modified&maxResults=30&timeSpan=30&showContent=true&confirm=Create+RSS+Feed&os_authType=basic{code}\r\n\r\nThe methods described won't work because the link is not a Confluence page. Using the insert link dialog, you can insert this relative link as a web link but it will be saved as a absolute link instead. This is also becoming a problem when you are trying to move a staging server to a production server. You'll have to manually change the link individually to match the current production domain. ",

      "description": "Creating Gliffy diagrams in past versions of Confluence/Gliffy consisted of going to \"Add\", choosing \"Gliffy Diagram\", creating your diagram, saving it, and it would appear in its respective Wiki.\r\n\r\nIn the latest version (Confluence 4.3.5), you begin a Gliffy diagram in the same fashion, but once a diagram is finished and you click \"Save\", nothing appears in the Wiki.  I've tried several alternate methods, including clicking on the \"Edit\" option on the upper right of the Wiki page, trying to \"Insert\" a \"Gliffy Diagram\", but it brings me back to the \"Edit Gliffy Diagram\" page, and still wouldn't allow me to Save a diagram to the Wiki.\r\n\r\nI was able to solve this partially, by \"Exporting a PNG\" from the Gliffy's edit page and inserting that into the Wiki's edit page.  This is still problematic in that it is just a still image, and not a Gliffy diagram that will allow me to make changes when necessary.\r\n\r\n~ Daniel Tong",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFCLOUD-28997].\n  {panel}\n\nHello,\r\n\r\nWe have a hosted confluence subscription. We are trying to script uploading files around 80MB in size and this usually causes our site to crash. Support said this was because of a bug in the SOAP (Axis) library. I also tried using xml-rpc with the same result. Which I think is really an out of memory problem on the hosted site. Support recommended the REST API but from what I see it only supports reads, not adding/modifying/uploading content?\r\n\r\nCould the Confluence REST API be updated to support uploading of attachments, or either the SOAP or XML-RPC interfaces allow large files (80MB) on the hosted site? \r\n\r\nOr just add more heap space to our site if that would solve the issue.\r\n\r\nthanks,",

I also checked to see if it was a one user thing and was seeing the same issue for two different users sending @mentions to each other (from the same page). \r\n\r\nIf I make a @mention in the comments section it is still coming through. \r\n\r\nIs there anything I can try/test to see what might be causing this block?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nDaniel\r\n\r\nEDIT - I just tested and you can place a task and use a @mention in it and it is working. \r\nI also tried making a @mention from the 'insert' drop down menu, but that didn't send out a email notification. \r\n",
