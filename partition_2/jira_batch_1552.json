Issue Summary\r\nCreating inline tasks stopped working in Confluence v6.14.x. \r\n\r\nMy app \"Diary for Confluence\" makes use of the comment editor and customers really like being able to use task lists.

For now, it's just broken.\r\n\r\nh3.

Issue Summary\r\nIn a Confluence Page, going to *...* > *Attachments* gives the user a *Download All* link that will _Download all the latest versions of attachments on this page as single zip file_.\r\nThis creates a temporary _.zip_ file in the {{<Confluence Home/temp}} folder makes this available to the user as a _downloadable_ file.\r\n\r\nDepending on the size and on the number of attachments in the page, generating the _.zip_ file on the _backend_ can take seconds or minutes. While the file is generated, there's no feedback on the UI to the user about the current status until the file is ready to download.\r\nIf the user doesn't know that Confluence is properly processing this request, this lack of feedback may lead the user to think nothing is happening and click on the same button again.\r\nDepending on user's expectations, this can repeat a number of times what can contribute the file system to fill in, since every time the user clicks on the button it will start a new thread in Confluence and create a new file in the temporary folder when the thread completes.\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Install a vanilla instance of Confluence\r\n# Configure the [maximum attachment size|https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/configuring-attachment-size-150040.html] to be bigger than 1GB.\r\n# Create a sample page in any space\r\n# Go to *...* > *Attachments*\r\n# Attach a large file -- for example with 800MB\r\n# Attach another file, but a smaller one this time -- for example, with less than 1MB\r\n# Still in the _Attachments_ page, click on _Download All_\r\n\r\nh3.

Actual Results\r\nConfluence does not provide any feedback to the user and, when the file is ready, browser's pop-up with the download file option will appear.\r\n\r\n \r\nh3. Notes\r\nBesides the UI issue, depending on user's actions this can create problems to the Confluence server, filling in the file system on which the {{<confluence home>}} folder is mounted.\r\nIf the users don't understand the file is being prepared, they may click on the _Download All_ button several times, which creates separate threads to serve the same request.\r\nEach thread will create a new file in the {{<confluence home>/temp}} folder.\r\n\r\nA suggested UI response could be similar to the status page when a Space Export is triggered.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this, users may get a 504 HTTP status if a reverse proxy is configured to do so.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\nIn the *Custom HTML* admin page, add the following script _At end of the BODY_ Section:\r\n{code}\r\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\r\n\tAJS.toInit(function(){\r\n\t    <!-- Prevent multiple cliks in the Attachments macro -->\r\n\t\tAJS.$('a.download-all-link').click(function(){\r\n  \t\t\tif( AJS.$('a.download-all-link').attr('disabled') == 'disabled') {\r\n                return false;\r\n            }\r\n  \t\t\tAJS.$('a.download-all-link').attr('disabled',true);\r\n  \t\t\tAJS.$('a.download-all-link').attr('title', '');\r\n  \t\t\tAJS.$('a.download-all-link').text(\"Your file will be available to download soon.\");\r\n\t\t});\r\n\r\n\t\t<!-- Prevent multiple cliks in the Attachments page -->\r\n\t\tAJS.$('a#download-all-link').click(function(){\r\n\t\t\tif( AJS.$('a#download-all-link').attr('disabled') == 'disabled') {\r\n                return false;\r\n            }\r\n  \t\t\tAJS.$('a#download-all-link').attr('disabled',true);\r\n  \t\t\tAJS.$('a#download-all-link').attr('title', '');\r\n  \t\t\tAJS.$('a#download-all-link').text(\"Your file will be available to download soon.\");\r\n\t\t});\r\n\t});\r\n</script>\r\n{code}\r\nThis will disable the download link after the first time it is clicked.",
