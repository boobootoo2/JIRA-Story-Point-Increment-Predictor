This can have the potential to affect/block production migrations.\r\n * Unsubscribing from the product also causes all downloaded apps to be reset - so in cases where there are many apps installed, admins have to manually re-install all of the plugins.",

This means that Page A will show a diagram that is actually stored inside PageB. It is called a [Linked Diagram|https://drawio-app.com/linking-content-in-draw-io-diagrams/].\r\n\r\nThe link happens based on PageID. As PageIDs will change when migrating from Server to Cloud, the relationship is then broken, giving users the impression that DrawIO Diagrams (attachments) were not migrated over.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Install DrawIO.\r\n# Create a page, say Page A.\r\n# Add a DrawIO diagram to it, let's name it as Diagram A.\r\n# Save the page. Create a new page, say Page B.\r\n# Add a DrawIo diagram to it.

Expected Results\r\nDiagram A is still working on Page B.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nPage B will show a message that says *Diagram not Found* where it should have showed Diagram A.

Workaround\r\nAtlassian can update this information in the backend database if one knows which pages are broken and the title of the pages where the linked diagrams are sitting at.\r\n\r\nOne could also access the broken pages and edit the DrawIO macro to re-create the link and update PageID accordingly in the backend.",

      "description": "Jira supports named user roles for projects, which helps simplify the process of assigning permissions to different users. With so many different permissions on Confluence spaces, it gets annoying having to copy the relevant permissions to each user or group based on how that user should use the space. Then, when the names are all sorted alphabetically, it's hard to tell who plays what role within the space: who are the \"admins\", who are the \"editors\", who are the \"viewers\", etc.\r\n\r\nI would like to ask that a new named role feature be added to Confluence so that I can manually create roles for a given space, such as \"Viewer\" or \"Editor\", assign permissions to that role, then assign roles to users. It would also follow that the same roles for a space be available for restricted pages withing the space, effectively acting like a custom group available only within that space. This feature could exist alongside the existing permissions structure, in case people prefer the current approach.\r\n\r\nA workaround is to create a global group within Confluence (or the upstream directory server(s)), e.g. \"Custom Space XYZ Editors\" and assign permissions to that group, but that requires admin input and pollutes the global group namespace. Instead, named roles within a space's permissions would not have either of these problems.",
