      "description": "At the moment the installers ability to integrate as a service means that it has to ship with some software called JavaWrapper. This makes the configuration of Confluence way more complex than before, because now we have to ways of configuring settings. This is especially annoying since people who are used to configuring Java Apps and App Servers will have to learn a new way of changing settings, where the old one is perfectly fine (and complicated enough to learn).\r\n\r\nWe should either get rid of this service thing (which seems overkill for an evaluation, and too complicated to many normal business users anyway), or make sure our documentation is updated, which will be very difficult to make easy to understand. Take this page for example: http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Fix+%27Out+of+Memory%27+errors+by+increasing+available+memory  - it now has two options: On windows do this, on Mac do that.  You would need at least two more cases, and also link to the JavaWrapper software for further docs - not exactly easy.\r\n\r\nAlso, we need a decision whether the installer should be an \"Evaluation Installer\" for now. My gut feeling tells me that people will run the installer on the desktop box, never shut it down again and make it run as a production server, which it is not. There needs to be a clear statement that it is fine to do so for a couple of days, but if you buy and use it you need to pass it on to the IT guys department.\r\n\r\nWe might see a big increase in installer issues that will eat up what we have gained in the first place.",

      "description": "The previous description of this issue was incorrect so I am updating it. \r\n\r\nThe symptoms of the issue are, if you go to your people directory it appears empty (or appears to not display a consistent number of users, i.e. 20 in the first page, but 50 in the next), even though you have a number of registered users. Often the case was your people directory used to work but does not any more. You users are managed externally, i.e. by LDAP, delegated to JIRA, etc and recently you have deleted a number of these users. \r\n\r\nThe reason the people directory appears blank, is because a number of your users have been deleted but their user info still exists in the confluence database.\r\n\r\nh3. Background\r\nEach time a user clicks on their preferences, it creates a row in the CONTENT table to represent their userinfo. Something like this:\r\n{code:sql}\r\nselect * from CONTENT where CONTENTTYPE='USERINFO';\r\n{code}\r\n\r\n{noformat}\r\n||CONTENTID||\tCONTENTTYPE||\tTITLE||\tVERSION||\tCREATOR||\tCREATIONDATE||\tLASTMODIFIER||\tLASTMODDATE||\tVERSIONCOMMENT||\tPREVVER||\tCONTENT_STATUS||\tSPACEID\t||CHILD_POSITION||\tPARENTID||\tMESSAGEID||\tDRAFTPAGEID||\tDRAFTSPACEKEY||\tDRAFTTYPE||\tDRAFTPAGEVERSION||\tPAGEID||\tPARENTCOMMENTID||\tUSERNAME||\r\n|131073|\tUSERINFO|\t(null)|\t1|\t(null)|\t2008-05-28 14:41:10.0|\t(null)|\t2008-05-28 14:41:10.0|\t\t|(null)|\tcurrent\t|(null)|\t(null)|\t(null)|\t(null)|\t(null)|\t(null)|\t(null)|\t(null)|\t(null)|\t(null)|\tadmin|\r\n|131074|\tUSERINFO|\t(null)|\t1|\tadmin|\t2008-05-28 14:42:28.0|\tadmin|\t2008-05-28 14:42:28.0|\t\t|(null)| current\t|(null)|\t(null)|\t(null)|\t(null)|\t(null)|\t(null)|\t(null)|\t(null)|\t(null)|\t(null)|\tasako|\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nAs you can see the contentype = 'USERINFO' and the username= the name of the user.\r\n\r\nNow once you delete a user in your external usermanagement (LDAP/JIRA/Crowd), it will disappear from Confluence user management, i.e. Searching Administration > Manage users will not find that user. However, their userinfo still exists in the content table. When populating the people directory, Confluence searches the CONTENT table pulling out all the people who have USERINFO rows in the table. However when it tries to display the person, it can't because the user no longer exists. If you have a number of these it can cause the people directory to not display the same amount of users across pages when searching through the people directory or in extreme cases it can cause the people directory to be empty.\r\n\r\nh5. Confirming that you are affected by this bug\r\nYou can confirm by checking if a recently deleted user (from LDAP/Jira etc) appears in  your Administraton > Manage users. If they do not, check if they exist in the CONTENT table with a query similar to \r\n{code:sql}\r\nselect * from CONTENT where CONTENTTYPE='USERINFO' and USERNAME='insert_name';\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nAnother test that we can use to confirm this is by going directly to the next set of users (i.e. not the first 50) by using the following URL:\r\n{noformat}\r\nhttp://confluence/browsepeople.action?startIndex=50\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nTry start indexes of 50, 100, 150, 200 to see if users are populated.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround for version before 3.5.0\r\nIf this is the case, then you need to delete the USERINFO rows for users that no longer exist, by doing the following:\r\n{color:red}Please remember to make a backup of your db before performing these operations, so that you can roll back should you need to{color}. \r\n\r\n{code:sql}\r\ndelete from CONTENT where CONTENTTYPE='USERINFO' and USERNAME='insert_name';\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nIf you are encountering any Foreign Key constraints, please see [this comment|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONF-11467?focusedCommentId=150394&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-150394] for details on how to remove the additional rows.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround for 3.5.0 - 4.3.2\r\nPlease test these queries in a development environment first to confirm they will not affect stability.\r\n{color:red}Please remember to make a backup of your db before performing these operations, so that you can roll back should you need to{color}. \r\n\r\nNB: This will result in all content created by the removed users being listed as created/edited by 'Anonymous'.\r\n\r\n\r\n{code:sql}\r\n-- Create set of users not in the cwd_user table but still have a USERINFO entry\r\ncreate table missing_users as select distinct(username) from content where username not in (select lower_user_name from cwd_user);   \r\n\r\n-- Create list of userinfo pages and attachmentids associated to missing users\r\ncreate table userinfo_pages as select contentid from content where contenttype='USERINFO' and username in (select username from missing_users);\r\ncreate table ui_attachmentids as select attachmentid from attachments where pageid in (select contentid from userinfo_pages);\r\n\t\r\n-- Delete content causing FK errors\r\ndelete from bodycontent where contentid in (select contentid from userinfo_pages); \r\ndelete from imagedetails where attachmentid in (select attachmentid from ui_attachmentids);\r\ndelete from attachmentdata where attachmentid in (select attachmentid from ui_attachmentids);\r\ndelete from attachments where prevver in (select attachmentid from ui_attachmentids);\r\ndelete from attachments where pageid in (select contentid from userinfo_pages);\r\nupdate content set prevver=null where contentid in (select contentid from userinfo_pages);\r\ndelete from links where contentid in (select contentid from userinfo_pages);\r\ndelete from content where contentid in (select contentid from userinfo_pages);                     \r\n\t\r\n-- Drop Tables\r\ndrop table userinfo_pages;\r\ndrop table missing_users;\r\ndrop table ui_attachmentids;\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nh3. Details of fix\r\nAs of Confluence 4.3.3 and higher, Confluence will now keep content created by the deleted user, and their content will remain searchable. However, the people directory will no longer display deleted users. During upgrade, Confluence will reindex all users who have been deleted, but have USERINFO entries. At runtime, Confluence will update the index any time users are deleted in a remote directory, once that information is synchronised across.",

It seems like on JIRA messageboard other developers using SetContentPermission from the SOAP APIs are having difficulty as well.\r\n\r\nI've provide a sample of how I was using the setContentPermission method (.NET C#) to set view only restrictions on a page for the \"test group\".\r\n\r\n// create confluence service\r\nConfluenceSoapServiceService service = new ConfluenceSoapServiceService();\r\n\r\n// create collection for group/people to assign to the page\r\nRemoteContentPermission[] objGroupCollection = new RemoteContentPermission[1];\r\n\r\n// instantiate a group (\"test user\" group)\r\nRemoteContentPermission objGroup = new RemoteContentPermission();\r\nobjGroup.groupName = \"test user\";\r\n\r\n// put the \"test user\" group in the collection\r\nobjGroupCollection[0] = objGroup;\r\n\r\n// assign the group collection to view only permissions \r\n// the selected page\r\nbool flag = service.setContentPermissions(pageTN.Profile.SessionId, remotePage.id, \"VIEW\", objGroupCollection);\r\n",

(You don't need to setup Apache to reproduce this, simply keep following the below steps.\r\n\r\n2) Change you Server base URL to be \"http://my.confluence.com\"\r\n\r\n3) Export a space (which has attachments, one of which is an image attachment and is displayed on the page) in html format. You will find that the image attachment is located within the export in both export/confluence/download/attachment/.../.../image.jpg and export/download/attachment/.../../image.jpg. \r\n\r\nTo reproduce this behaviour more easily I have included a space export. \r\nAfter completing step 1,2 above, do the following. \r\na) Import the export into your 2.7.3 install. \r\nb) export the space as a html file. \r\n\r\n\r\nCustomers should be able to have two different contexts and still not have a duplicate files in the export. \r\n",

Say Boots looks after the slides for the Confluence webinar. I download the file on Monday and subscribe to the attachment. Boots updates the file on Tuesday. I get a notification that the file has been updated so I can then download the latest version.\r\n\r\nNot sure how much work is involved in this but I think it would be a great feature to have to boost our sales pitch of using Confluence to replace your shared network drive or document management system.",
