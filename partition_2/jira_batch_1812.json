Previously we had an unsupported document which described how to run Confluence with a policy that restricted some access on the filesystem, but not much else:\r\n\r\nhttp://confluence.atlassian.com/display/CONF29/Java+Policy+Security+with+Confluence\r\nhttp://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DISC/Java+Policy+Security+with+Confluence (currently locked as Obsolete)\r\n\r\nIt would be good if this document was extended to limit functionality further, and tested properly so it could be supported by Atlassian for use in production. It could provide a good way for the administrator to limit the powers available to plugins and provide a layer of security when installing new plugins.\r\n\r\nAnother related issue is CONF-20287, restricting the ability to upload plugins through the web interface.\r\n",
