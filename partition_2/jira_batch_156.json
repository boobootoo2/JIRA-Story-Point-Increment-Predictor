Actual Results\r\n - Epic is empty\r\n - \"Sample Epic 1\" is migrated as a new custom issue type \"\u30a8\u30d4\u30c3\u30af\"\r\n - Sub-task is migrated as a new custom issue type \"\u30b5\u30d6\u30bf\u30b9\u30af\"\r\n\r\nAll other default issue types are migrated as a new custom issue type in cloud.\r\n\r\n*Jira Server*\r\n !Screen Shot 2021-01-27 at 10.59.52.png|thumbnail! \r\n *Jira Cloud*\r\n !Screen Shot 2021-01-27 at 11.00.03.png|thumbnail!\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nBefore execute migration, change Issue types and fields name on server.\r\nh4. Update Issue Types\r\n # Move to _Jira admin > Issues > Issue types_\r\n # Click *Edit* and update Issue type Name to English\r\n -- \u30d0\u30b0 -> Bug\r\n -- \u30a8\u30d4\u30c3\u30af -> Epic\r\n -- \u30b9\u30c8\u30fc\u30ea\u30fc -> Story\r\n -- \u30bf\u30b9\u30af -> Task\r\n -- \u30b5\u30d6\u30bf\u30b9\u30af -> Sub-task\r\n\r\nh4. Update Epic custom fields\r\n # [Unlock a locked Jira Software custom field|https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirakb/unlock-a-locked-jira-software-custom-field-779158866.html]\r\n # Move to _Jira admin > Issues > Custom fields_\r\n # Click *Edit* and update Epic related field name to English\r\n -- \u30a8\u30d4\u30c3\u30af \u30ab\u30e9\u30fc -> Epic Colour\r\n -- \u30a8\u30d4\u30c3\u30af\u30b9 \u30c6\u30fc\u30bf\u30b9 -> Epic Status\r\n -- \u30a8\u30d4\u30c3\u30af \u30ea\u30f3\u30af -> Epic Link\r\n -- \u30a8\u30d4\u30c3\u30af\u540d -> Epic Name\r\n -- \u30e9\u30f3\u30af -> Rank\r\n\r\nh4. Update filters\r\n\r\nYou need to update filters when rename custom fields or issue types:\r\n - JRASERVER-61048: As a jira admin asked to rename a custom field, I want to know which filters contain the custom field, so I know which ones to update\r\n - JRASERVER-30467: Renaming a project or issuetype breaks filters saved with the old project or issue type name\r\n\r\nh4.

Issue Summary\r\n\r\nCurrently, the CSV file import wizard allows specifying a date format (this could be _Date_ e.g \"*dd/MM/yyyy*\" or _Datetime_ e.g \"*dd/MM/yyyy h:mm a*\".\r\n * If you specify the _DateTime_ format: It will work for _Datetime_ fields, but fail to import _Date_ fields, and\r\n * If you specify _Date_ format, it will import both _Date_ and _DateTime_ fields *but* the _DateTime_ fields will be stripped of the _time_ digits. For instance, when \"*dd/MM/yyyy*\" is specified and you have a column with values like *25/12/2020* and another with *23/12/2020 9:15 PM*.\r\n ** *25/12/2020* will be imported but,\r\n ** *23/12/2020 9:15 PM* will be imported at\u00a0*23/12/2020 00:00:00 (_23/12/2020 12:00 AM_*)\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nAllow the ability to specify how both Date and Datetime fields will be imported, so that they can work at the same time.\r\nh3. Why This Is Important\r\n\r\nWhen importing a CSV of issues into Jira, a customer could have both _Date_ and _DateTime_ columns on the same CSV. Since the fields can't be imported correctly at the same time, the customer will have to run the import twice (see workaround). It will save time if it can be done in one go.\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nImport the values with 2 imports (first import for the date fields and the second for the DateTime fields, or vice versa).\r\n\r\nTo avoid duplicating the issues, the CSV file for the second import needs to contain a column that maps to *Issue Key* so that it will update\u00a0existing issues (created from the first import). If an issue exists for a given key, it will be updated.\r\n\r\nSo steps to complete after the first import (assuming _Date_ fields were imported first):\r\n * Export all the imported issues from Jira to a CSV:\u00a0\r\n ** *Filters > Advanced Issue Search*.\r\n ** Once you have filtered the issues, export using the\u00a0*Export*\u00a0button on the top right corner of your Filter page.\r\n ** Important fields are\u00a0_Project, Issue key,_\u00a0and\u00a0_Summary_\r\n * Once exported, update the CSV file with the _Datetime field_.\r\n ** You can update the values by doing a *VLOOKUP in Excel* on the _Summary_ column. {color:#FF0000}_Note:\u00a0this assumes that the Summary column is the best match between the 2 CSV files - CSV used for the first import and the CSV exported from Jira_{color})\u00a0\r\n * Once the CSV is ready, run another import to update *only* the _Datetime_ fields.",
