But it is tantalizing because it comes so close to meeting our requirements and yet is still a few steps away.\r\n\r\nWe want to display JIRA issues as events, using \"due date\" or possibly some other JIRA date field, and we can do that now.\r\n\r\nBut we want to customize the JIRA fields that are visible in the event on the calendar. Currently we can see the issue key and the summary and that is frequently useful. But what we would like is the ability to choose what shows up in the \"event cell\", i.e., we might like to display the summary and the assignee, or, the summary and the component, etc. It also seems like we should be able to choose what shows in the cell under normal conditions, and, what shows during a hover.\r\n\r\nI'm sure you already have this in the queue for a future release.\r\n\r\nThanks for the great product!",

Confluence sent a notification stating it had been deleted and also included an .ics file.  I assumed this was an export of the calendar prior to deletion because the email mentioned importing the file to restore the calendar.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the .ics file was empty, in other words it had no events in it.  When I imported it to Confluence the calendar was blank.  I imported it to Outlook at got a warning saying there were no events.\r\n\r\nI searched Atlassian Answers and looked through the TEAMCAL project issues, but didn't find anything describing this exact problem.  Has it been addressed in a newer version?\r\n\r\nIf not, please fix the bug so that the file Confluence emails is an accurate export of the calendar data.\r\n\r\nMany Thanks!",

Problem Definition\r\nCurrently, if two users edit the same event on a Team Calendar and save it at the same time, Confluence will save only the changes done by one of the users.\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\nWe could provide a way to resolve this by either locking other users from editing when a user is editing a Calendar automatically, or we could provide a 'lock' for users to be able to lock Calendars before editing them.\r\n \r\nh3. Workaround \r\nManually lock this Calendar down by editing the restrictions. This can be cumbersome especially for Calendars with many permissions:\r\n# Go to the calendar\r\n# Restrict the calendar only to that single user\r\n# Edit/add any events\r\n# Remove restrictions",
