      "description": "h3. Problem Definition\r\n\r\nCurrently, in JIRA Software if a status is removed from the workflow used by the board, the following will happen:\r\n\r\n# Status removed (Eg: Open)\r\n# Open status is used by issues when a Sprint is ended.\r\n# Admin updated the workflow to remove the Open and replace it with To Do status.\r\n# The issues with Open status when the Sprint was ended will not be shown in any of the report in the board.\r\n\r\nThis happens because JIRA Software checks whether the status which was set for the issues when the Sprint was completed. If the status is removed from workflow, JIRA unable the issues in the report due to missing dependencies (status).\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nThere are few ways to improve the existing behaviour:\r\n\r\n# Show the data correctly regardless whether any of the status is removed from the workflow.\r\n# Inform users on workflow change/removal of status for JIRA Software associated projects. This will prompt user to update the workflow to include the status which was removed previously.\r\n# In reports, show users data that is not included in the sprint reports. Eg : Table of *Not belonging to any column* and its missing statuses.\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround \r\n\r\n# Update the workflow used by the affected issues to include the status which was set to the issues when the Sprint was completed.\r\n# The steps to add the status in the workflow is done to make sure that the status appears back in the board so the admin can map it. \r\n# Once it's mapped, the issues will be listed back in the report. If they do not want to have this status in their workflow, they can remove them back.\r\n# Even when the status is removed from the workflow, the statuses will still be listed in the column management page (with exclamation mark).",

      "description": "h3. Problem Summary\r\n\r\nThe DVCS plug-in uses the {{entity_property}} table in JIRA to cache development-related information of issues in JSON format. This is a problem for instances with a large number of issues, as it will severely impact querying performance on this table due to too many records.\r\nh3. Environment\r\n * Instances with a large amount of issues (1 million+) and linked to DVCS accounts.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Create instances with a large amount of issues\r\n # link to DVCS accounts with valid content (Bamboo, Fe/Cru)\r\n # Load all issues in JIRA\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nPurge caches on a timely basis - e.g. automatically clear caches not updated for more than 30 days.\r\nh3. Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nThe table will grow in size indefinitely, affecting the querying performance and also impacting resource usage on the database server.\r\n\r\nAccording to support cases, the number of rows with development caches will be the product of 'number of issues' * 'number of Dev Application Links'.\r\n\r\nOther symptoms:\r\n * High CPU utilizations at Database\r\n * slow issue load for projects with DevIntegration panel enabled.\r\n * That leads to high number of connection in the DB pool\r\n * and later other part of JIRA code not using this table, also become slow as it needs to fight for DB pool connection.\r\n\r\nh3. Notes\r\n\r\nNumber of _fusion.caches.issue_ rows in {{entity_property}} table:\r\n * Client1 - 300k\r\n{code:java}\r\nSELECT entity_name,count(id) from entity_property group by entity_name;\r\n     entity_name     | count\r\n---------------------+--------\r\n fusion.caches.issue | 332790\r\n IssueProperty       |   6298\r\n ProjectProperty     |      3\r\n{code}\r\n\r\n * Client2 - 3.7M\r\n{code:java}\r\nSELECT count(id) from entity_property where ENTITY_NAME = 'fusion.caches.issue';\r\n3720708\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nManually purge older records from the table:\r\n{code:sql|bgColor=#f8f8f8}\r\nDELETE FROM entity_property WHERE ENTITY_NAME = 'fusion.caches.issue' AND UPDATED < '<date-30d>';\r\n{code}\r\n(i) You can use DBMS' specific functions for date intervals or simply replace {{<date-30d}} with a date 30 days before now.\r\n{code:java}\r\n// MS SQL server\r\nDELETE FROM entity_property WHERE ENTITY_NAME = 'fusion.caches.issue' AND UPDATED < dateadd(day,-30,getdate());\r\n{code}",

In the sprint deletion case it would be nice if a snapshot list of the included issues can be provided together.\r\n\r\nThrough this way we would be able to manage the sprints more securely and do a proper follow-up action quickly for such accidental case.\r\n\r\nThanks for your support in advance and hopefully this suggestion would be accepted soon.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nOliver Cho",

However they all want their own customizations independent of the other teams (don't ask), and so I am now going through and pulling them off of the shared scheme stack; making per-project copies of all of the workflows and screens for each of the 30 projects, and then re-building all of the mappings back up into schemes. Cloning the schemes themselves doesn't do me much good, because the underlying workflows and screens also need to be separate.\r\n\r\nI could probably script this, but it would make sense to me that when I'm copying a scheme, I had the option to say \"not only make a copy of this, but make copies of all of the underlying workflows\\screens\".",

Actual Results\r\nThere will be replication lag.

Notes\r\nDuring LexoRank Rebalance, node that is performing Rebalance can issue extensive number of requests to reindex issues on other nodes in the cluster. In some cases those other nodes might not be able to keep up with amount of work to be performed. This in turn can cause replication lag. That will cause temporary data discrepancy between nodes.  \r\n\r\nh3. Workarounds\r\n* Leave only one node in LB to prevent serving stale data from other nodes. This negates the high availability value of Data Center so is considered a last resort. This also requires that each node is capable of handling the full concurrent user traffic for your organization, as is the best practice for an HA cluster.\r\n\r\nFull details on workarounds and solutions are available at [JIRAKB/JIRA Software Data Center Lexorank Indexing Lag|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRAKB/JIRA+Software+Data+Center+Lexorank+Indexing+Lag].\r\n\r\nh3.

These meetings are generally held in conference rooms where the kanban screen is zoomed in for everyone to see clearly, and only a handful of issues can appear on the screen at once.\r\n\r\nThe minimal real estate on a zoomed-in board makes it\u00a0difficult for users to rank issues using drag-and-drop methods, so they regularly use the Top/Bottom of Column links to quickly sort issues. Several teams have noted how\u00a0excellent it would be to also have a Middle of Column link to quickly sort issues that aren't the highest or lowest priority (but that don't need to be precisely placed relevant to other middling issues).\u00a0\r\n\r\nThere might be even more benefit to\u00a0having an option to move an issue to a specific rank position without requiring drag-and-drop (i.e. Move to X rank of Column/Swimlane). Perhaps a new\u00a0[Agile keyboard shortcut|https://confluence.atlassian.com/agile/jira-agile-user-s-guide/using-keyboard-shortcuts#UsingKeyboardShortcuts-AgileShortcuts]\u00a0like _s+#_ could send an issue to a specific rank position or even a percentile position (e.g. s+5 = 50th percentile rank position, i.e. middle of backlog).\u00a0",

      "description": "h4. Summary of Issue\r\n\r\nThe JIRA Manage Add-ons page (and several other features within JIRA) is attempting to communicate to itself and does so using the base address. In a network setup where there is a Reverse Proxy requiring authentication, the reverse proxy is forcing the internal traffic from JIRA to the SSO and does not permit the unauthenticated traffic to go through.\r\n\r\nIN [JRA-63795|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRA-63795], we saw health checks failing because the requests from JIRA weren't permitted via the reverse-proxy based authentication. (In that scenario, however, the {{/rest}} endpoint was whitelisted, but it still produced an inconsistent result due to authentication at the reverse proxy level).\r\n\r\nWhile we have the ability to bypass a reverse proxy/SSL by means of a secondary connector, we cannot tell JIRA to use this for internal requests - the Base URL is always used.\r\n\r\nh4. How to reproduce\r\n\r\nThe overview of the customer architecture is that JIRA webserver sits behind a client firewall which uses SiteMinder via an Apache Reverse proxy for authentication. JIRA appears to be using a plugin to read the logged in user from a cookie.\r\n\r\nh4. Expected Result\r\n\r\nJIRA should be able to access itself locally and not go through the Reverse Proxy/external SSO.\r\n\r\nh4. Actual Result\r\n\r\nJIRA is accessing itself via its base URL and the SSO is not letting traffic through that is not authenticated.\u00a0\r\n\r\nh4.Workaround\r\nWorkarounds will depend on your specific architecture, security requirements and other constraints. However, options include:\r\n# Whitelist requests from JIRA to itself to allow anonymous requests\r\n# If your authentication system supports it, use a plugin inside JIRA (rather than handling requests at the reverse proxy level) Moving the authentication to JIRA will allow it to correctly handle anonymous requests from itself.",
