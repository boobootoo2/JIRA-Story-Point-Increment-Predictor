Sadly the documentation for creating blueprints is not very detailed.\u00a0 \r\nI looked at the source code of the \"Decision\"-blueprint (https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/confluence-business-blueprints) and figured that i have to include this code inside my soy-file:\r\n\r\n{code:java}\r\n/**@param names Usernames to be mentioned */ \r\n{template .mentionXml}\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \r\n{foreach $name in $names}\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \r\n<ac:link><ri:user ri:username=\"{$name}\" /></ac:link>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \r\n{/foreach}\u00a0\r\n{/template}\r\n{code}\r\n\r\n\r\nBut to use this code i also have to add a ContextProvider, which is very extensive in the example code and hard to adapt to my own blueprint. \r\n\r\nCould you give me an explanation on what i have to add to my blueprint, so that the user-mentioning works?\r\n\r\n I hope that i am in the right space to ask this question, i was linked here by the Support Team.

Summary\r\nWhenever a user inserts an ellipsis character (i.e. \"\u2026\" which is three dots represented as a single character) as content in Confluence, and an inline comment is created from highlighting that content, the resulting Site Export (or Space Export containing comments) will convert the ellipsis to three separate period characters (i.e. 3 \".\" in a row). Thus, the resulting string in the entities.xml import will be longer in character count than the original string. If the original string was close to 255 characters, the 'converted' string will be greater than 255 characters. This causes subsequent attempts to import this data to fail with the following error:\r\n\r\n{code} ERROR [Long running task: Importing data] [sf.hibernate.util.JDBCExceptionReporter] logExceptions Data truncation: Data too long for column 'STRINGVAL' at row 1{code}\r\n\r\nor this one:\r\n\r\n{code}Caused by: java.sql.BatchUpdateException: Batch entry 2 insert into CONTENTPROPERTIES (PROPERTYNAME, STRINGVAL, LONGVAL, DATEVAL, PROPERTYID) values ('inline-original-selection', 'typedef struct EthrLagGroupCbkEntryData{    EthrLagGroupLagLinkList ethrLagLinkList; /* List of LAG links */    EthrLagMemberSpeed ethrLagMemberSpeed;    EthrManualMacAddress ethrManualMacAddress;    ......

Expected Results\r\nThe export does not add characters to special characters like the ellipsis.\r\n\r\nh3. Notes\r\nFor the error to be replicated in an import, the original string for the highlighted text has to be close to 255 characters. If the string is not close, the conversion will not affect the import as it will remain under 255.\r\n\r\nh3.Workaround\r\nBefore exporting, delete the inline comments which are highlighting text which are close to 255 characters and contain the ellipsis character. Alternatively, you can edit the entities.xml file and shorten the inline comment there to be less than 255 characters.",

This can be an issue for organization especially banks that have strict security constraint (fontset cannot be downloaded) as a result this will not render on customer instance. \r\n\r\nI would recommend that we change the current method of icons being rendered using fontset being changed to HTML entities instead.\r\n\r\nThere is also a security issue which have been reported by Microsoft recently the link can be found below :\r\nhttps://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/kb/3079904\r\n\r\nYou can see an example of a customer instance not rendering the fontset icons as per the screenshot attached below :\r\n!fontset not rendering.jpg|thumbnail!",

This could be applied globally, so all the spaces would be using the same configuration.\r\n\r\nA situation to be used as example, would be that the user is doing a transition from the Documentation Theme to the new Default theme, but, the *Child Pages* option in the sidebar will still be needed. \r\n\r\nThis request could be related to the current plans for new Confluence versions, as [this Task|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONF-38256] to remove the Documentation theme.",

Summary\r\nIn-line Comments and Resolved Comments are imported with a Space Export, but throw a 500 error when the REST call is made for rendering the Page. This has been replicated with space exports from Confluence Cloud and Confluence Server.\r\n\r\nh3. Environment\r\n* Confluence Cloud\r\n* Confluence Server 5.7, 5.8.18 or 5.9.4.\r\n* The Space has Resolved in-line comments\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Go to a Space and a Page within that Space. Add two in-line comments and resolve one of them.\r\n# Do a full XML export of the Space\r\n# Import the Space export into a new instance (either same version or same major version)\r\n# Notice the import completes successfully, but the in-line and resolved comments are not displayed even though they are present in the {{entities.xml}} file and database.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nIn-line comments are displayed.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nThe in-line comments are imported into the database, however the {{user_key}} is not mapped correctly from the old instance to the new instance. \r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n{color:red}SQL manipulation in the database is not supported. Please make sure you have a database backup.{color}\r\n\r\n# Shutdown Confluence\r\n# Run this query \r\n{code:language=sql}\r\nselect stringval from contentproperties where propertyname = 'status-lastmodifier' and stringval not in (select user_key from user_mapping) group by stringval;\r\n{code}\r\n# In next step after this, you will need to run update statements to replace the _username_ and _old_user_key_ values.  To obtain the corresponding _username_ values, you can use the SQL below on your *source* Confluence database.  If the source was a Cloud instance, you can ask Atlassian Support to run this query for you on your Confluence Cloud database, using the list of values from the previous step.\r\n{code:sql}\r\nselect distinct cp.stringval, um.username, um.lower_username from contentproperties cp \r\njoin user_mapping um on cp.stringval = um.user_key\r\nwhere propertyname = 'status-lastmodifier'\r\nand stringval in (\r\n'ff80808157d6342b0157d8d795020000', \r\n'ff80808158be2e8d0158c14ba8ec0001', \r\n'ff80808159726edc015983f2cb090001'\r\n);\r\n{code}\r\n# Run this code to update the resolved comment's user to the correct {{user_key}}\r\n{code:language=sql}\r\nupdate contentproperties set stringval = (select user_key from user_mapping where username = '<username>') where stringval = '<old user_key>';\r\n{code}\r\nWhere\r\n#* {{<username>}} is the username of the User who originally resolved the in-line comment.\r\n#* {{<old user_key>}} is the value identified from the first SQL query.\r\n# Restart Confluence\r\n\r\nIn-line comments should now display\r\n\r\nh3.
