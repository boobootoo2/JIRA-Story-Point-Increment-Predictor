Suggested Solution\r\nAdd an option for mail handlers to be solely dedicated to a Project only including issue comments.\r\n\r\nh3. Why This Is Important\r\nOur customer base is increasing, such that there would be cases when an email meant for a dedicated project mail handler may contain a string in the subject that would coincidentally match an existing issue ticket.\r\nWhen this happens, data in the email is misrouted: information for a new ticket in a specific project is instead commented on an unrelated issue ticket instead.\r\n\r\n\r\nh3.

Suggested Solution\r\nHaving this check with a reported number of issues that should have a Rank value but doesn't will help with the following:\r\n# make it clear why we're getting this error on the UI\r\n# take necessary action (reindex) on the issue to build a rank field value\r\n\r\nh3.

      "description": "h3. Issue Summary\r\nMostly during the start of the day (when Jira has heavy login pressure from users), customer experienced a severe performance degradation (up to the point that system looks unresponsive). Upon further digging into thread dumps, we found 2 sets of problems:\r\n # A large number of threads waiting for *ReadLock*  (action - /rest/internal/2/user/mention/search)\r\n # At the same time, a group of thread waiting for a *WriteLock* (action - /plugins/servlet/samlconsumer)\r\n both on {{DirectoryUserIndexer.java}}.\r\n\r\nThis is caused by contention in the code and leads to situation, where a lot of threads (waiting for a ReadLock) are waiting on one thread that's supposed to get a WriteLock to update the {{UserIndex}}, but can't as it also waits on another thread which is currently having a ReadLock on {{UserIndex}} and doing the search.\r\nThis causes cascading contention and degrades user experience in Jira for other actions (see JSWSERVER-20336).\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\nDetails from the customer instance: \r\n* 300k+ user\r\n* Massive amount of users logging in simultaneously at the start of the day\r\n* Lot of action attempting to do {{@mention}} users at the same time\r\n\r\nHave not attempted to repro in-house.\r\n\r\nh3.

Issue Summary\r\n\r\nWhen the same issue has the sprint changed from Sprint A, then to Sprint B, and later on, to Sprint C, Sprint A shows the scope change but Sprint B does not show the issue and the scope change at the Burndown Chart and the Sprint Report.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n1. Enable \"Parallel Sprints\" at the Admin > Applications > Jira Software Configuration\r\n2. Create some stories a, b, c, d with 1 point each\r\n3. Create sprint 1 \r\n4. Add stories a e b to the sprint 1\r\n5. Start sprint 1  (it will have 2 points to be done from the story a and story b)\r\n6. Transition story a to done (remaining 1 point to be done from story b)\r\n7. Create sprint 2\r\n8. Edit story b and change the sprint to sprint 2, confirming the scope change\r\n9. move story c  from the backlog to sprint 2 \r\n10. Complete sprint 1 (1 point done, 1 point removed)\r\n11. Start sprint 2 (2 points to be done from story b and story c)\r\n12. Create sprint 3\r\n13. Transition story c to done (1 point) \r\n14. Move story d from backlog to sprint 3\r\n15. Edit story b and change the sprint to sprint 3, confirming the scope change\r\n\r\n\r\nh3.

This happens despite having the filter constructed with project-specific, for more information, refer to the steps to replicate below.\r\nh2. Steps to replicate\r\n # Create 2 projects with 1 issue each on the project (Project A and Project B)\r\n # Create a label (example of the field) and mark it on the issue for both project (example: {{labeling}}). This is to make sure the field's context incluudes both projects.\r\n # Grant the user project administration and manage sprint permission in project A\r\n # Ensure that the user has no such permission in project B\r\n # Create a board with the query below:\r\n{noformat}\r\nproject = \"Project A\" and labels in (labeling) ORDER BY Rank ASC\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\n # Load the board for test user that follow the criteria given for step 3 and step 4\r\n\r\nh2.

Issue Summary\r\nThe DVCS plugin could throw an exception due to passing a large number of parameters while querying the DVCS table in order to create a list of the latest change sets.\r\nThe request (in this case, however there could be other triggers) was made by the Activity Stream gadget which calls DVCS.  In this case the end user did not notice any problems in the Jira application, however the exception thrown was often seen in the Jira log files.\r\n\r\n*It is important to note that this issue can happen with any JDBC driver (perhaps with a different number of parameters), in this case it was found with the Microsoft SQL Server JDBC driver.

Current Jira Features\r\n\r\nThere are three functions that let us filter issues by sprint status:\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n{noformat}\r\nclosedSprints(), openSprints(), futureSprints(){noformat}\r\nThere is a way to filter by text in sprint name.

Proposed Solution\r\n\r\nAllow \"sprint = / != / IN / NOT IN\" to be used within the Sprints() functions, so that I can get issues in the sprints that match both the status and name that I need.

      "description": "h3. Problem Definition\r\n\r\nThere are different reasons because of which the same sprint(with same id) appears on multiple boards:\r\n * a board is cloned and hence the same filter is being used on the cloned board and the same sprint now shows up on 2 boards\r\n * a board is created with a filter which searches on Sprint ID\r\n * a new board is created with a filter which overlaps with the filter for another board. All sprints linked to issues from overlapping filter will now show on the new board.\r\n\r\nWhen this scenario occurs, the results of changes to sprint on any one board can impact the other boards as well. This creates confusion to the users of the other boards.\r\n\r\n+*Confusing scenario example 1:*+\r\n * The Sprint is started on the board with a subfilter of the issues from the original board.\r\n * At this point a pop up appear stating with a message which should warn the customer that the original Sprint contains much more issues:!Screenshot_2020-10-21_at_13_37_05.jpg|thumbnail!\r\n\r\n(i)\u00a0However the message is not clear and the result is that customer browse a board which contains much more issues.\r\n * In fact when the same sprint is completed, another popup appears:!Screenshot_2020-10-21_at_13_37_27.jpg|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nAgain Jira reports the total number of issues that are incomplete and which will be moved to the next sprint or to the backlog, that we cannot see on the board since the board doesn't filter those.\r\n\r\n+*Confusing scenario example 2:*+\r\n Another similar situation happens when *deleting the sprint* from the 2nd board (not the original one), user will see only some of the issues moved to the future sprint or to the backlog when there are in fact *much more actually moved*.\r\n\r\nMoreover, when looking at the Agile reports both for the board which filter a subfilter of the original one and the one which filter in the original ones plus more issues, obviously the results on reports will be different cause they will contain respectively less or more issues.\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nPlease provide more clear advice messages to clarify those situations both in:\r\n * Sprint Start/Complete popup.\r\n * Agile reports pages.\r\n * Sprint deletion popup\r\n\r\nPerhaps a message similar to this one can be added to the Sprint screens mentioning:\r\n\r\n*_\"The Sprint 'Sprint-1' appears on the following boards. Making changes to the sprint here will impact all the boards\"_*\u00a0 !Screenshot 2020-11-12 at 13.43.13.png|thumbnail!\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nWhen creating new boards, try to create boards with overlapping filters only if absolutely necessary. Please keep in mind that creating boards with overlapping filters can be very confusing for the users.",

Actual Results\r\n\r\nOnly issue A (with \"rockstar\" in summary) is returned in the search results.\r\n\r\nAlso, running the same search under\u00a0_*Issues > Search for issues*_ returns both issues A and B.\r\n\r\n!Screenshot 2020-11-05 at 10.42.27.png|width=235,height=88!\r\n\r\n!Screenshot 2020-11-05 at 10.41.59.png|width=211,height=103!\r\nh3.
