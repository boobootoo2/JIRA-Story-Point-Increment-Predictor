      "description": "h2. Issue Summary\r\n\r\nConfluence uses [C3P0|https://www.mchange.com/projects/c3p0/] as its database pooling layer, which provides tons of options for administrators who wish to tune the way their applications connect with their database through a JDBC Driver.\r\n\r\nAmong these options, there's one called {{hibernate.c3p0.min_size}}, which sets the minimum size that the database pool must have to operate throughout its lifecycle. Due to the way that Confluence handles its database pools, if this property is set to a non-zeroed value, the application may end up doubling the amount of database connections that the database will need to handle, which can cause performance issues and jeopardise resource planning.\r\nh2. Issue Details\r\n\r\nConfluence uses [Hibernate|http://hibernate.org/] as its ORM framework. Recently, Confluence has been bumped to Hibernate version 5, which is good, since new capabilities are added, but is also bad, given that the issue mentioned above happens.\r\n\r\nThe problem happens because during startup Hibernate is going to open parallel Database Connection Pool(s) to perform metadata queries and fulfil its own needs. This/these parallel Database Connection Pool(s) will use C3P0 as well to be configured. That being said, let's imagine the following setup:\r\n{code:java}\r\n<property name=\"hibernate.c3p0.max_size\">60</property>\r\n<property name=\"hibernate.c3p0.min_size\">30</property>\r\n{code}\r\nThis implies that Confluence will raise a Database Connection Pool that will have 30 connections opened with the database since startup and that can grow up to 60 connections depending on need. In a nutshell, this means that, at anytime, we'll have at least 30 connections established with the database.\r\n\r\nThat being said, an administrator can then plan database capacity accordingly, given that the administrator knows that the maximum amount of connections that the database will need to handle is 60 connections. Right? *Wrong!* :)\r\n\r\nFrom Hibernate 5 onwards (which is our current version), Hibernate will also open database pool(s) as mentioned above. This means that during startup, we can double the amount of connections being sent to the database. As two pools are opened, we can send _max_size_ times two to the database, meaning that 120 connections can be established. If an administrator planned to have his database being able to hold up to 60 connections maximum, a bottleneck is established as the pool can grow bigger than what the database can handle.\r\n\r\nAside from that, Confluence will never close the parallel pool(s) opened by Hibernate, which means that if _hibernate.c3p0.min_size_ has been set to a non-zeroed value, once Hibernate is done using its pool, 30 connections are going to remain established with the database but are never going to be used, given that it is used only during startup.\r\nh2. How to Validate Impact\r\n\r\nHere's a step by step guide to check the bug behaviour on PostgreSQL:\r\n # Stop Confluence.\r\n # Edit <Confluence-Home-Directory>/confluence.cfg.xml and set the following properties as below:\r\n{code:java}\r\n<property name=\"hibernate.c3p0.max_size\">60</property>\r\n<property name=\"hibernate.c3p0.min_size\">60</property>\r\n{code}\r\n # This is supposed to mean that the maximum number of connections that your pool can establish with the database is 60 connections.\r\n # Start Confluence.\r\n # Go to your database and run the following query once Confluence is up and running - Don't forget to replace your database name and database username in the query:\r\n{code:sql}\r\nselect count (datid)\r\nfrom pg_stat_activity\r\nwhere datname = 'confluence_6.6.3' and usename = 'confluenceuser';\r\n{code}\r\n # This query should not return values bigger than 60, as it brings the amount of JDBC connections established by C3P0 with the database. Once you run it, you are going to see more than 60 due to the bug mentioned herein. On a testing environment (clean instance), the count reached to 81.\r\n\r\nh2. Workaround\r\n\r\nThe workaround is to go ahead and set _hibernate.c3p0.min_size_ as 0. This way, once Hibernate is done using its database pool, unused connections will be removed from the pool based on timeout until it has zeroed out. In a matter of a few minutes, pooled but unused connections should no longer exist and the database won't have connections without usage tied to it.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0",

      "description": "h3. Issue Summary\r\n\r\n_Background_\r\n\r\n_Confluence 6.15.1 shipped with a new functionality which allows to enable additional matching logic upon importing Spaces from Cloud.\u00a0In future, Cloud will stop to export usernames and replace them with email addresses (or unique number identifiers) in Space export. These emails can be matched with users' emails set in Confluence Server. Learn more in this KB article: [https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Import+a+space+from+Confluence+Cloud]_\r\n\r\nThe email-matching process is enabled on the admin page Backup & Restore by checking the \"Attribute content created in Confluence Cloud to matching users in this site (Cloud spaces only)\" checkbox. If a User performs such Cloud import and forgets to set this checkbox, when they reimport again, having it set this time, such import would fail.\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Perform a Cloud Space export. Check if the entities.xml file contains email addresses stored in ConfluenceUserImpl->name fields.\r\n # Perform a Space import, do not check the \"Attribute content ...\"\r\n # Observe all the content has been attributed to \"Unknown Users\"\r\n # Delete the imported Space\r\n # Perform a Space import again, this time check the \"Attribute content ...\" checkbox.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nAfter second import, all of the content that had corresponding users in Server, should be properly attributed to them (e.g. properly display page creators, commenters, etc.)\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nAfter second import, all of the content in imported Space remains attributed to Unknown Users.\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nTo recover from such failed import, you must remove the unnecessary entries from the USER_MAPPING table.\r\n\r\nTo do that, only delete these which match an email address and are NOT usernames in the *cwd_user* table:\u00a0\r\n # Make sure the problematic Space is deleted\r\n # Execute the following query:\u00a0\r\n\r\n|{{delete from user_mapping where username like\u00a0}}{{'%@%'}}\u00a0{{and username not in (select user_name from cwd_user);}}|",

Issue 1\r\n\r\nConfluence already support some markups but not support message:// as can be seen in its source code:\r\n{code:java}\r\nprivate static final Pattern OFF_SITE_URL_PATTERN = Pattern.compile(\"^\\\\s*(([a-zA-Z]*(?<!(script|data))://)|mailto:|skype:|callto:|facetime:|git:|irc:|irc6:|news:|nntp:|feed:|cvs:|svn:|mvn:|ssh:|itms:|notes:|smb:|sourcetree:|urn:|tel:|xmpp:|telnet:|vnc:|rdp:|whatsapp:|slack:|sip:|sips:|magnet:)[\\\\p\\{L}\\\\p\\{N}/]+([\\\\p\\{Zs}\\\\p\\{S}\\\\p\\{P}\\\\p\\{L}\\\\p\\{N}&&[^'\\\"<>]])*(\\\\s)*\");\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nh4. Issue 2\r\nWhen trying to use message:// markup with < or % (message://<... or message://%) as a workaround, Confluence page editor does not retain the link and remove it completely. These are the steps to replicate:\r\n# Install Confluence Source Editor plugin\r\n# Edit page and insert a new link message:\u2068// (Ex: message://<01D6XSK9JR2C998T72TWMJYP2T@atlassian.com>) on the address field and press insert button. \r\n# Click on open in the source editor button (added by the plugin mentioned in step 1).\r\n# HTTP <a href=\"\"> argument will not be there.\r\n# Still in edit mode click on the link created in step 1 option Go to the link to be redirected to the e-mail message (Please note that this message must be present on customer mail).\r\n# Click on the update button.\r\n# Click on the link created on step 1, and it didn't do anything.\r\n# Click on the edit link to see that Confluence removed the entire link message:// when the insert link button is clicked. \r\n\r\nAs can be seen through Source Editor, Confluence removes the HREF from the frontend code when we insert a link with message:// markup as opposed to a regular link :\r\n{code}\r\n<p>\r\n  <a>Message</a>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n  <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n  <a href=\"http://www.google.com\">Message1</a>\r\n</p>\r\n<p/>\r\n{code}\r\n\r\n*Suggestion*\r\n\r\nConfluence should have message:// markup available automatically in any page in order to create a link when users paste anything with this syntax:\r\n\r\n\r\n{code:java}\r\nmessage://<MessageID> \r\n{code}\r\n",

      "description": "{panel:title=This issue has been split into 2 suggestions}\r\nPlease read this comment\u00a0for a detailed explanation. In summary:\r\n\r\nIf you are typing a *full word*\u00a0(e.g. \"manage\" to match \"manager\") and find that your document does not match, you are likely interested in CONFSERVER-58280\r\n\r\nIf you are typing a *partial word* (e.g. \"manag\" to match manage) and find that your document does not match, you are likely interested CONFSERVER-58279\r\n{panel}\r\nh3. Issue Summary\r\n\r\nWith Confluence 6.14, many improvements where made on search engine, making finding different words easier and faster. We don't need to type all the word to find results. Engine should give suggestions as we type. This was explained in [Search for anything|https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/confluence-6-14-release-notes-963655609.html]\r\nh3. Environment\r\n\r\nConfluence 6.14.0 and 6.14.1\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Create multiple pages with the following titles: Management, Managers, Managerial.\r\n # Make suer the index was built\r\n # Search for \"Manage\"\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nAll 3 pages should be returned\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nNothing is returned\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nAdd * at the end of word you are looking for. This is not ideal as it might return a lot noise.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, copy the title of the page into the page body. Then search seems to return it fine.\r\n\r\nNote that the site indexing language also needs to be set correctly for Confluence to stem words correctly. i.e. if you select \"French\" as your indexing language you cannot expect different versions of English words to match.",

      "description": "h3. Issue Summary\r\n\r\nIn Confluence pages, changing the colour of links to other Confluence pages using the color palette does not get reflected when the page is saved.\u00a0\r\n\r\nh3. Environment\r\nIssue observed on Confluence 6.14.0 onwards.\r\nIssue does not observed on Confluence 6.13.x and below\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Create a new page\r\n # Add a link of another Confluence page by:\r\n#* Directly pasting a link of another Confluence page\r\n#* Go to Insert More Content > Link > Search > Insert for any other Confluence page\r\n # Change the link color using the palette to a different color.\u00a0\r\n # In the Edit mode, the links will seem to have their color changed.\u00a0\r\n !CONFSERVER-57949-replication steps.png|thumbnail! \r\n # Publish.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nThe links will have their color changed\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nThe link will maintain the the blue color regardless of the color that was assigned to it.\r\nh3. Notes\r\n* The issue seems to occur if a whole link has its color changed. If you attempt to change the color of part of the link. The new color will be reflected after the change.\u00a0\r\n* The issue does not affect links to outside of Confluence such as {{https://www.google.com}}\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround #1: Source Editor\r\n # Download and install the [Confluence Source Editor|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1210722/confluence-source-editor?hosting=server&tab=overview]\u00a0app in your Confluence instance.\r\n # Edit the problematic page and click the *<>* button to edit its Storage Format.\r\n # You will need to adapt the piece of code for the colored links. Starting from this non-functional, green-colored link example:\r\n{code:java}\r\n<p>\r\n  <span style=\"color: rgb(0,255,0);\"> <ac:link>\r\n      <ri:page ri:content-title=\"page 3\"/>\r\n    </ac:link> </span>\r\n</p>\r\n{code}\r\n # Add an {{<ac:link-body>}} tag right after the {{<ri:page>}} node. Also add its closing tag, {{</ac:link-body>}}.\r\n{code:java}\r\n<p>\r\n  <span style=\"color: rgb(0,255,0);\"> <ac:link>\r\n      <ri:page ri:content-title=\"page 3\"/>\r\n        <ac:link-body></ac:link-body>\r\n    </ac:link> </span>\r\n</p>\r\n{code}\r\n # Inside this new tag, add a _span_ tag with the color settings on its \"style\" parameter. You can either copy or move the text from the existing code to the new location. Remember to also move or copy the closing tag, {{</span>}} to the proper location. In the example below, I moved the text:\r\n{code:java}\r\n<p>\r\n  <ac:link>\r\n      <ri:page ri:content-title=\"page 3\"/>\r\n        <ac:link-body><span style=\"color: rgb(0,255,0);\"></span></ac:link-body>\r\n    </ac:link> \r\n</p>\r\n{code}\r\n # Inside the _span_ tag, add the link text - repeat the same value of the \"ri:content-title\" attribute:\r\n{code:java}\r\n<p>\r\n  <ac:link>\r\n      <ri:page ri:content-title=\"page 3\"/>\r\n        <ac:link-body><span style=\"color: rgb(0,255,0);\">page 3</span></ac:link-body>\r\n    </ac:link> \r\n</p>\r\n{code}\r\n # Save and publish the page.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround #2: HTML Macro\r\n # Go to  !https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/files/590259974/590058056/1/1398739558493/Cog.png! > *Manage Apps*\r\n # Click the dropdown menu and select *All Apps*.\r\n # Click on \"x of 8 modules enabled\".\r\n # Enable the *html (html-xhtml)* module.\r\n # Go to the problematic page and insert an\u00a0[HTML Macro|https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/html-macro-38273085.html].\r\n # Add some HTML code inside the macro according to your needs. For example:\r\n{code:java}\r\n<a href=\"http://localhost:8090/confluence/display/MYS/page+3\" style=\"color:red\">My hardcoded link for page 3</a>\r\n{code}\r\n #* (!) Note that this will be a \"hardcoded\" link and will not inherit some Confluence features like automatic link renaming when the page gets moved or renamed. We suggest using a [Tiny Link|https://confluence.atlassian.com/confkb/the-differences-between-various-url-formats-for-a-confluence-page-278692715.html] instead of the default link.\r\n # Save the page.",
