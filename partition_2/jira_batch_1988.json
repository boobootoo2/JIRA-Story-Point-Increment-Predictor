Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Create multiple pages with huge content in the old editor, use page property macro, and give them a label to be able to use page property report macro.\r\n # create another page and add page property report macro, select the label in macro configuration ( assigned label to pages in the first step), select items to display, and save.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nThe page with page property macro should render all the pages and pagination should work as expected. \r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nThe page with page property macro is just rendering the number of items displayed (eg:30) and clicking on the 2nd page it does not go to the next 30 lists of content/items.\r\n\r\nLooking at dev tools, it is making the request, but it's not showing up on the front end.\r\n !image-2020-05-07-15-42-16-787.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\nhttps://oldeditorsite.atlassian.net/wiki/rest/masterdetail/1.0/detailssummary/lines?pageSize=30&pageIndex=0&cql=label+%3D+%22testpagination%22+and+space+%3D+currentSpace+(+)&spaceKey=copy&contentId=1475018793&countComments=false&countLikes=false&sortBy=&reverseSort=\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\nPage can be converted into the new editor but the look and feel of the page property report maco once it renders all content to the page, it's not user friendly.\r\nFor eg :  !image-2020-05-07-15-51-44-786.png|thumbnail! \r\nand on old editor page property report macro looks like this\r\n !image-2020-05-07-15-53-42-986.png|thumbnail! \r\nOr \r\nReduce the number of items to display to see when is it rendering all the contents on pagination.

Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Create a new page and add a task (action item);\r\n # Link a Jira Issue in front of this action item\r\n # Create another page with a *Task Report* macro and report on the above page;\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n * Similar to the way Jira issues are rendered as smart cards, the second page should report the Jira Issues as smart cards. ( similar to the screenshot below)\r\n !Screen Shot 2020-04-29 at 16.02.14.png|width=608,height=192!\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n * On the report page, the Jira Issues are displayed as simple links, as can be seen in this next screenshot:\r\n !Screen Shot 2020-04-29 at 16.08.27.png|width=569,height=292!\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\nYou can access the pages where the task macros are placed in and, instead of pasting the JIRA issue link, you can add the JIRA macro with */jira* and set the JQL as {{key = <JIRA-ISSUE-KEY}}. This will make the Task Report macro render the JIRA issue as a {{ac:macro}} in the page's HTML, instead of a {{<h ref}} tag.\r\n\r\n(!) Notice that if you apply this workaround, in case you need to edit the page where you applied it, you may be affected by this other bug that changes single JIRA issues added with the JIRA macro into {{<h ref}} links:\r\n* [CONFCLOUD\\-71774: Jira macro with a single issue will be transformed on a link upon editing the page|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFCLOUD-71774 ]*",

After discussing internally, we have updated the messaging shown for the audit settings to accurately reflect our audit log retention system's behavior of clearing out old audit logs every 3 months. At these 3 months intervals, you're able to choose how much data you would like to preserve.\r\n\r\nIf this is still an issue for you, please let us know. Thank you again for providing valuable feedback to our team!\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n Sunny Xu\r\n{panel}\r\nh3.

Audit records that are greater than 1 day old are not being removed and new audit records are also being retained for longer than 1 day.\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Change audit settings to 1 day\r\n # Perform an action an in Confluence that will trigger a log (space creation, permission changes, space deletions, )\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nLogs should be kept or retained based on settings\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nlogs are not being deleted\r\nh3.

While editing the macro this problem is not visible, we can only verify it after saving the macro or publishing the page.\r\nTo place the bars at the minimum distance, you need to place the bar where it should be and then resize it. When resizing, the system automatically stops when it reaches the minimum distance between bars. It is almost impossible to achieve the same result by placing the bar manually. \r\n\r\nExample in Macro settings Dialog window:\r\n !Screen Shot 2020-04-23 at 11.09.28.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\nExample in page edit:\r\n !Screen Shot 2020-04-23 at 11.09.56.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\nExample in page view:\r\n !Screen Shot 2020-04-23 at 11.10.24.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\nExample in page view using weekly view on the macro:\r\n !Screen Shot 2020-04-23 at 11.11.10.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Create a new page\r\n # Place a new Roadmap Planner Macro\r\n # Define the time frame to span across some months (I used 12 months)\r\n # Add some bars in order to cover all months\r\n # Place bars at the minimum possible distance \r\n # Save the macro\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nBars do not overlap and correctly represent the time frame they were designated into.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nSome bars overlap\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\nEnter edit mode and then resize the problematic bars. This should insert the necessary minimum distance between them. ",
