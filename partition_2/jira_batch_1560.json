Notes\r\n\r\nThe Apache Tomcat server, which is a web server used by Confluence, is filtering out requests that contain special characters. That\u2019s because Tomcat is using a different encoding and URI standard than most browsers.\r\n\r\nSee also Apache [Tomcat 8.5|https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-8.5-doc/config/http.html] http docs for more details:\r\n{quote}relaxedPathChars:\r\n\r\nThe [HTTP/1.1 specification|https://tools.ietf.org/rfc/rfc7230.txt] requires that certain characters are %nn encoded when used in URI paths. Unfortunately, many user agents including all the major browsers are not compliant with this specification and use these characters in unencoded form. To prevent Tomcat rejecting such requests, this attribute may be used to specify the additional characters to allow. If not specified, no additional characters will be allowed. The value may be any combination of the following characters:\r\n{code:java}\r\n\" < > [ \\ ] ^ ` { | } {code}\r\n. Any other characters present in the value will be ignored.\r\n{quote}\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nSpecify tomcat to allow the special characters. For the above issues, we only need to allow the comma \",\" character.\r\n # Go to <confluence_install>/conf, backup, and edit the server.xml file.\r\n # Find all connectors your application is using. Just search for Connector in the file, or look at the example below. You're interested only in connectors whose protocol is set to HTTP and HTTPS (not AJP).\r\n # Add {{relaxedQueryChars=\"[,]\"}} to the connector properties in server.xml. For example:\r\n{code:java}\r\n        <Connector port=\"26156\" connectionTimeout=\"20000\" redirectPort=\"8443\"\r\n                   maxThreads=\"48\" minSpareThreads=\"10\"\r\n                   enableLookups=\"false\" acceptCount=\"10\" debug=\"0\" URIEncoding=\"UTF-8\"\r\n\t\t\t\t   relaxedQueryChars=\"[,]\"\r\n                   protocol=\"org.apache.coyote.http11.Http11NioProtocol\"/>\r\n{code}\r\n#* If the above workaround does not work, try specifying the other characters by adding the following in server.xml instead:\r\n{code:java}\r\nrelaxedPathChars=\"[]|\"\r\nrelaxedQueryChars=\"[]|{}^&#x5c;&#x60;&quot;&lt;&gt;\"\r\n{code}\r\n # Restart Confluence",

In big instances (>2K concurrent users), this plugin doesn't scale properly and can be accountable for around 100K queries executed against the database in the period of an hour.\u00a0\r\nh2. Steps to Replicate\r\n\r\nThere are no known steps to replicate, as this plugin doesn't have a logic set of steps to be triggered.\r\nh2. Sample Queries\r\n\r\nQueries being triggered by the plugin includes but are not necessarily limited to below examples:\r\nh4. Expensive Join\r\n{code:sql}\r\nSELECT message.\"ID\", message.\"CONTENT\" FROM \"AO_21F425_MESSAGE_AO\" message JOIN \"AO_21F425_MESSAGE_MAPPING_AO\" message_mapping ON message.\"ID\" = message_mapping.\"MESSAGE_ID\"\r\n{code}\r\nh4. Full Table Scan\r\n{code:sql}\r\nSELECT * FROM ( SELECT \"ID\", \"CONTENT\" FROM \"AO_21F425_MESSAGE_AO\" ) WHERE ROWNUM <= 1\r\n{code}\r\nh2. Example of Plugin Usage\r\n\r\nThe plugin is used to send messages in-app like the ones below:\r\n !image.png|thumbnail!\r\nh2. Diagnose Steps & Workaround\r\n\r\nIt is not easy to spot problems caused by this plugin unless you have a good way of creating reports from your database, like [Oracle AWR Reports|https://oracle-base.com/articles/10g/automatic-workload-repository-10g]. Usually, you will see spikes in Database Connections and probably Long Running Threads. If that's a symptom you have along with slowness in the application, look into your query execution history for the queries above. If you find them, you are them affected by this bug.\r\n\r\nThe workaround by now is to disable the plugin through a Dark Feature. To do so:\r\n # Access <Confluence-Base-URL>/admin/darkfeatures.action\r\n # Add the following Dark Feature to your list:\r\n{code:java}\r\nwhisper.disabled\r\n{code}",

This then results in Confluence not having enough threads free in order to service users, leading to performance degradation.\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nEffort should be made to address the linked application's unavailability problem as that is what's triggering this bug. \r\nWe may do so by performing the following diagnosis steps:\r\n - Please make sure that the linked application has been configured correctly in the Application Link page.\r\n - Please ensure that Confluence can reach all linked instances (via Application Link) over https.\r\n (i) Check this by using [httpclienttest|https://bitbucket.org/atlassianlabs/httpclienttest/src].\r\n - If the other end (e.g. Jira) is down or no longer in service, remove the application link\r\n\r\n(i) After resolving the issue above, you'll need to restart Confluence for the threads to be released and available to users again.",

Context\r\nThis bug only appears when the content in #all-updates belongs to the user being deleted. All-updates relies on change documents in lucene. As part of reindexing content with user mentions, we also reindex change documents, which involves first looking up the original change document for a given content object, deleting it, and then adding a new change document for the same content object. Unfortunately, looking up the original change document relies on the *username*. By the time, we try and look up the original change document, the user has already been renamed, so we don't find the original, but we do add a new one, resulting in duplication.\r\n\r\nSee {{com.atlassian.confluence.search.lucene.tasks.AddChangeDocumentIndexTask#perform}}\r\n\r\nh3.

Problem Definition\r\n\r\nCurrently when the Companion App MSI file is deployed by admins wishing to roll out this feature to multiple Windows machines the app still needs to be manually started before it can make the system call to add it to launch at startup. Customers have run into this issue and see that only after running the app manually the registry entry is placed here: {{HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run}}\r\n\r\nThis differs from the normal installer behaviour (.exe) which does launch the Companion App after installing. However, MSIs are usually installed via an admin account, so having the executable launch automatically after installation will not solve the problem (as this will only add the registry entry for the admin user).\u00a0\r\nh3. Current scenario:\r\n\r\nAfter user runs the App for the first time, the registry key will be added in the following path\r\n{noformat}\r\nHKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run{noformat}\r\nh2. Workaround:\r\n\r\nThe registry key can be added to HKCU (for all users that should have Companion running) during the deployment to ensure that the app is started automatically without having the user to start it manually.\r\n\r\nFor 32-bit OS:\r\n{code:java}\r\nmsiexec /qn /i \"Atlassian Companion.msi\"\r\nreg add \"HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\" /v \"electron.app.Atlassian Companion\" /d \"C:\\Program Files\\Atlassian Companion\\Atlassian Companion.exe --was-opened-at-login\" /f\r\n{code}\r\nFor 64-bit OS:\r\n{code:java}\r\nmsiexec /qn /i \"Atlassian Companion.msi\"\r\nreg add \"HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\" /v \"electron.app.Atlassian Companion\" /d \"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Atlassian Companion\\Atlassian Companion.exe --was-opened-at-login\" /f\r\n{code}\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nAs of Companion 0.6.0, a registry key can alternatively be manually added to HKLM (instead of HKCU) with no side effects. This will allow Companion to automatically launch for all users on the machine. The process will be the same as above, but adding the registry key to HKLM:\u00a0\r\n\r\n{{HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\Software\\WOW6432Node\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run}}\r\n\r\n\u00a0",

Problem Definition\r\nIn code, deciding if the _Create_ button should be rendered in the header bar (a.k.a. top bar) is an expensive operation due to permissions validation.\r\n\r\nWhen the user access one of the following dashboards, Confluence uses an expensive operation to decide whether or not the _Create_ button should be rendered in the header bar:\r\n * All updates ({{<Confluence Base URL>/#all-updates}}).\r\n * Popular ({{<Confluence Base URL>/#popular}}).\r\n * Recently worked on ({{<Confluence Base URL>/#recently-worked}}).\r\n * Recently visited ({{<Confluence Base URL>/#recently-viewed}}).\r\n * Saved for later ({{<Confluence Base URL>/#starred}}).\r\n\r\nThe above mentioned _Create_ button is highlighted in the image below, from the user perspective:\r\n !create_button_dashboard_img001.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\nOn the background, Confluence will check if the current user has permission to create a page or a blog post on any Space.\r\nThese are assigned by _Add page_ and _Add blog_ [Space Permissions|https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/space-permissions-overview-139521.html].\r\nIf more than one Space is retrieved from the above operation, then Confluence will use only one of them as a reference, which is sorted by the _Space Name_ and the _Space Key_.\r\nNo previous usage of the selected space is taken into account, meaning that it won't check for Spaces users visited before or created/edited content.\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\nConfluence could render the _Create_ button on any dashboard page, whether the user has create page permission to any Space or not.\r\nThe permission validation should be made after the user has clicked on the button.\r\nIf the user doesn't have enough permissions to create a page in any Space, then a graceful message should be displayed.\r\n\r\nh3. Performance Impact on Scale\r\nLooking at a single operation, the permission validation may appear as a _simple_ task.\r\nHowever, when we think of an enterprise deployment of Confluence, with thousands of users accessing Confluence on a single day, then deciding when rendering the _Create_ button becomes an expensive operation.\r\n\r\nOn an enterprise instance, Confluence would look through over 250k rows in the database to retrieve a single one to complete this permission validation.\r\n\r\nh3.

Problem Definition\r\nConfluence will retrieve a full 404 page when a restricted content is requested from a mail client, which is an inefficient operation since the content retrieved will not be rendered by the client.\r\n\r\nThe problem is detailed below:\r\nUsers may add Confluence content (such as images) into an e-mail.\r\nThis content will be fetched by the e-mail client, such as MS Outlook, and Confluence will retrieve it.\r\nOne can simulate the e-mail client request by running a {{GET}} operation with curl similar to the one below:\r\n{code}\r\ncurl -u user:user -H 'User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 9.0; Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; Trident/7.0; Microsoft Outlook 15.0.5059; ms-office; MSOffice 15)' -H 'Accept: */*' -H 'Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5' 'http://localhost:8080/c663/download/thumbnails/9076744/image_name.png?version=1&modificationDate=1541779552344&api=v2' -H 'Pragma: no-cache' -H 'Cache-Control: no-cache'\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nIf the user that received the e-mail doesn't have access to this content, Confluence will retrieve a full 404 page, on the same way as accessing it from the browser.\r\nSee below an example of the response:\r\n !request_curl_img001.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\nThis isn't efficient, since Confluence will go through the whole process to build all components of the 404 page, which will not be used by the client.\r\nAs an example, Confluence will build the top bar, which requires permissions validation to determine which components will be rendered to the user.\r\nThese permissions validation are costly operations to Confluence and could be avoided in the above scenario.\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\nIf the user agent of the current request is MS Outlook ([contains the string {{Microsoft Outlook}}|https://udger.com/resources/ua-list/browser-detail?browser=Outlook%202016]), then Confluence should send only a 404 status without retrieving any page content.\r\nThe same could be applied when the user agent is any other email client.\r\n\r\nh3. Performance Impact on Scale\r\nFixing this bug would help Confluence to be more efficient, retrieving a full 404 page only when needed -- i.e. user accessing it from a browser.\r\nOn scale, an e-mail with a restricted image can be sent to several recipients that don't have access to it. Serving a full 404 page to thousands of users is costly to Confluence and to the Database.\r\nIn depth:\r\n * Building the top bar requires Confluence to check for permissions, which is a costly operation.\r\n * Running thousands of queries in the database may consume too much of RAM, provided that these queries will use a {{join}} operation.\r\n\r\nDepending on the size of your Confluence instance, this could create a situation on which around 10,000 of GET requests would be sent to Confluence from e-mail clients.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\nIf you are running Confluence behind a proxy, you could create a filter to drop requests from an e-mail client when a burst is detected.\r\nThe configuration below is based on [Nginx Rate Limiting|https://www.nginx.com/blog/rate-limiting-nginx/] to drop requests for images from an MS Outlook client after a burst.\r\nYou may need to change the threshold according to your environment. Also, other proxy technologies may offer similar capabilities.\r\n{code:title=Nginx Rate Limiting example}\r\n### filter for requests coming from an Outlook client\r\nmap $http_user_agent $bad_outlook {\r\n    default \"\";\r\n    ~*(Outlook) 1;\r\n}\r\nlimit_req_zone $bad_outlook zone=outlook:10m rate=10r/m;\r\nlimit_req_status 429;\r\nserver {\r\n    ### your standard Confluence configuration\r\n\r\n\r\n    ### use Outlook filter on thumbnails\r\n    location ^~ /c663/download/thumbnails {\r\n        limit_req zone=outlook;\r\n        proxy_pass http://localhost:6663/c663/download/thumbnails;\r\n    }\r\n    ### use Outlook filter on attachments\r\n    location ^~ /c663/download/attachments {\r\n        limit_req zone=outlook;\r\n        proxy_pass http://localhost:6663/c663/download/attachments;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n{code}",
