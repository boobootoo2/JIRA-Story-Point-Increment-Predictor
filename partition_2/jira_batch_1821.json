Nothing is completely covered, just partly.\r\n\r\nAfter restoring the .vm files that shipped with 3.1 the problem went away on some pages, but still exists on others (despite it just using the default footer).

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFCLOUD-18040].\n  {panel}\n\nPeople cannot find other people because they do not know that a name is written with an umlaut or accent.\r\nI think it is perfectly reasonable for a confluence user to expect that the search string 'rene' also finds the person 'Ren\u00e9' and that a search for 'ozgur' also finds the person called '\u00d6zg\u00fcr'.\r\n\r\nPeople suggesting that names with diacritic marks should be entered into Confluence without the diacritic marks, I kindly ask to crawl back in time a few decennia when the American Standards Association could use some help developing ASCII. The use of Unicode is not uncommon anymore, and this problem can be solved in a better way:\r\n\r\n1. The preferred solution would be to implement a way to remove diacritic marks from a letter, so you can reduce a string with diacritic marks to a string without diacritic marks. A search string would then not only be compared to a persons name, but also to the reduced version of that name.\r\n\r\n2. A work-around would be to create a new user property, besides 'fullname', that can contain alternative spellings of this persons name. Someone called Ren\u00e9 could enter 'Rene' as alternative spelling. A search strings would then not only be compared to a persons name, but also to the alternative spellings of that name.\r\n\r\nMore information:\r\n- My support ticket describing the problem: https://support.atlassian.com/browse/CSP-40233\r\n- Google demonstrating that you can strip the umlaut: http://www.google.nl/search?q=Dani%C3%ABl\r\n- A solution in Perl: http://ahinea.com/en/tech/accented-translate.html\r\n",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFCLOUD-18029].\n  {panel}\n\nCongratulations on delivering a wonderful improvement to the Office connector plugin with Confluence 3.1. I really enjoy the new features and no bugs yet :-)\r\n\r\nHowever, on the Word/Powerpoint page rendering one issue that still makes life difficult is the incomplete rendering/display support for Word/Powerpoint documents containing Text Boxes. \r\n\r\nIn 1.6 it shows the text within the boxes at least but its mostly all left justified and there are no box outlines, or Word autoshapes or graphic objects such as box join lines or arrows displayed.\r\n\r\nAbove: think a flowchart done in Word with text boxes and arrows - thats what I'm trying to display in rendered in a Confluence page.\r\n\r\nI know the above can be done in Gliffy or embedded as a JPG in the word doc but we have 1000's of Word and Powerpoint documents containing text box content and converting them will take a long time, and in some cases such as ISO 9000 documents we always want to store everything in the Word document since there is (as yet, hint, hint!) no way to export pages from Confluence (e.g. PDF export) with headers, footers, proper pagination, etc suitable for such \"controlled\" documents.\r\n\r\nThis missing Word/Powerpoint text box support from the Office connector is restricting further application of Confluence in our business. Please consider this feature request ASAP.",

      "description": "As mentioned in CONF-16393, CONF-16735 and CONF-16694, calling the getById method on the PageManager with the id of a blog, or any other contententity object, will always return a Page object.  The returned Page is horribly broken and can end up in the cache.\r\n\r\nSince PageManager implements ContentEntityManager, and getById returns a ContentEntityObject, this it is not reasonable to assume that getById will only get called with a pageId.  There is an expectation that if there is no matching page, then null will be returned.  It can be extremely confusing to debug this problem when a PageManager is passed into some other method as a ContentEntityManager.\r\n\r\nIt is also quite inobvious how this bug occurs, so I'll explain it.\r\nThe getById method is implemented in only the super class, DefaultContentEntityManager.  It is implemented like this:\r\n{noformat}\r\n    public ContentEntityObject getById(long id)\r\n    {\r\n        return contentEntityObjectDao.getById(id);\r\n    }\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nThe weirdness comes down to what {{contentEntityObjectDao}} is, and that depends on the applicationContext.xml.  In the case of a PageManager the contentEntityObjectDao is currently a PageDao, which returns Page.class from getPersistentClass.\r\n\r\nThis gets passed into this method in our HibernateObjectDao \r\n{noformat}\r\n    protected EntityObject getByClassId(final long id)\r\n    {\r\n        EntityObject obj = (EntityObject) getHibernateTemplate().execute(new HibernateCallback()\r\n        {\r\n            public Object doInHibernate(Session session) throws HibernateException\r\n            {\r\n                return session.get(getPersistentClass(), new Long(id));\r\n            }\r\n        });\r\n\r\n        return obj;\r\n    }\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nThe javadoc for session.get might lead you to think this would only return pages:\r\n{quote}\r\n\t * Return the persistent instance of the given entity class with the given identifier,\r\n\t * or null if there is no such persistent instance. (If the instance, or a proxy for the\r\n\t * instance, is already associated with the session, return that instance or proxy.)\r\n{quote}\r\nBut it doesn't do that until Hibernate 3.2.1.  See http://opensource.atlassian.com/projects/hibernate/browse/HHH-1460 and http://opensource.atlassian.com/projects/hibernate/browse/HHH-416.",
