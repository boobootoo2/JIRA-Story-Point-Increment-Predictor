They may apply to more than one layout and many more can be found for instance on [Wikipedia|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyboard_layout#QWERTY].\r\n\r\nExamples:\r\nAltGr + 2 produces at sign {{(@)}} (FI)\r\nAltGr + 3 produces pound sign {{(\u00a3)}} (FI)\r\nAltGr + 4 produces dollar sign {{($)}} (FI)\r\nAltGr + 7 produces left curly brace {{(\\{)}} (FI)\r\nAltGr + Q produces at sign {{(@)}} (IS, DE)\r\n\r\nThis behavior is changed from Confluence 3.3 where Ctrl + Alt + number combinations were not mapped to heading formatting shortcuts; only Ctrl + number combinations were.\r\n\r\nTo reproduce one of these issues:\r\n- Change the keyboard layout to Finnish\r\n- Open the Rich Text Editor\r\n- Type some text\r\n- Press AltGr+2, which should produce an at sign {{(@)}}\r\n\r\nInstead the text changes to a level 2 heading.\r\n\r\nThis behavior is breaking our editing experience as the only way to produce these special characters is to switch to markup mode. This breaks the editing workflow. The bug is also not readily apparent and may confuse a large portion of users.\r\n\r\n{panel:title=Workaround|bgColor=#aaccff}NOTE: A workaround has been provided in the comments by Atlassian ([link|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONF-21780?focusedCommentId=228496&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-228496]), although it has to be reapplied after every Confluence upgrade.{panel}",

      "description": "We (our company) really love the fact how straight forward confluence is. Especially our technically not so well versed users. So, it is a great thing you can also search for multiple labels without modifying the URL or working with advanced search querys like \"labelText:[label1] and .. and labelText:[label_n]\".\r\nUnfortunately this isn't obvious at all.\r\n\r\nHere's an example (please also have a look at the picture):\r\nLet's say I'm on a page in the space documenting the tools used in our company. There I see a \"confluence\" label and I'd like to get a list of all user tips concerning confluence.\r\nSo i click on the \"confluence\" label (1.)\r\nNow I'm redirected to the next page (2.). At the top you know see \"Label: confluence\". Well, this makes sense. I clicked on the \"confluence\" label so I expected to be redirected to this page. But I also wanted to narrow the search down to tips (or \"tipps\" in German).\r\nSure I can see \"tipps\" listed in the \"related labels\" column. But since I got to \"Label: confluence\" by clicking on \"confluence\" just a few seconds ago, I naturally assume I will get to \"Label: tipps\" by clicking on \"tipps\". And that this page would list tips for every tool documented. Because that isn't what I want, I won't click it and there really is no hint at all that clicking \"tipps\" would exactly achieve what I want and works different than on the page before in the way that it further narrows down the search and doesn't just list all entries with a \"tipps\" label.\r\n\r\nIf I click on \"tipps\" anyway I get the \"Label:confluence+tipps\" page (3.) and that's great and all I wanted since the beginning but I honestly see no way to get to this conclusion other than just trying/guessing.\r\n\r\nI'm sorry If my text may be a bit confusing but I hope you'll understand what I'm trying to say and agree with me in that this behavior should be made more clear. Perhapes with a hint like \"To narrow the search further down you may click on one of the following labels: ...\".\r\nOr just implement check boxes like suggestet in http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONF-4577\r\n",

In 3.4 (maybe 3.3 too) setting any of these options prevents saving the security configuration.  \r\n\r\nWhen an admin tries to change the security configuration, they are *always* returned to the edit screen, and are given no feedback.\r\n\r\nThere is a bug in the security config validation where it checks for valid values of the websudo options, even though none are submitted from the form and none are used.  \r\n\r\nThe worst part of this bug is that the validation is a field error, which would usually be displayed underneath the field with the error.  Since the field is not displayed at all in this case, there is no feedback to the user about the validation problem at all.",

It is confusing for the person doing the sharing as they cannot tell what is viewable to others and what is not. We have tried to make this as clear as possible through training and naming spaces a certain way to make this more clear (example \"All Company Share\" space, etc), but this is a brittle method and one that has limited success despite our efforts to keep throwing training at this. Is there any relief in sight on this? It really makes people frustrated when on rollout of Confluence we boasted about how Confluence increases collaboration and makes it easy, then it just makes it hard when people attempt to share and run into these problems where they are blind to everyone's access level for the content they need to share. It's really tough to manage being the administrator who has to deal with all of these snags. \r\n\r\nThe solution I have in mind is to write the sql needed to make this happen on my own and create a user macro to make this available to others (this has been done for Oracle but not Postgres from what I can see), but I'd rather see if there is a cleaner solution before wiring that in.
