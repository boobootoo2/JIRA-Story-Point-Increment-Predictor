Confluence is being used as the project communication and collaboration tool thus far it has been wildly successful. We recently added scientists and consultants from all over the country to Confluence access via iChain Novell's authentication proxy for http. I have had no problem uploading files internally up to 120M using Confluence upload facilities, however uploads of 1M or greater are failing( 9 out of 10 times sometimes it works!) for our external users accessing Confluence through iChain. Ethereal captures show the multipart post being sent successfully all the way to the server Confluence is running on for both failures and successes. This project must be able to exchange files in a secure manner and project managers have suggested they will pull Confluence support if I don't find a solution to this problem.\n\nHere is my request.\nI need to know what classes handle the upload request for attached files. I also need to know how to turn on logging for those files(currently nothing appears in the logs). I need to pinpoint the cause of failure. I do believe the failure is the interaction of iChain with Confluence because neither fails to perform on its own. attached is the error I recieve on screen.   ",

      "description": "JIRA has great custom fields and workflow capabilities.  If these were ported to Confluence, it could grow beyond being a publishing tool and be programmable to take over in a number of corporate/departmental databases. For example, I'm thinking it could be a great knowledge base...\n\nWorkflow would allow for pages in a given space to be \"approved\" before publishing. Actions on steps might be to change the visibility to more people, change approval assignments, etc. \n\nCurrently each page has a small handful of visible fields: lastChangedOn, lastChangedBy, title, content, and parentPage. Custom fields could augment this and be used for a number of things:\n1) additional search capabilities, i.e. keywords\n2) macros - i.e. show the results of a search... makes for a nice home page (I used Traction at a previous job, it was quite good at this part)\n3) apply templates -- by default, the current template shows the title, lastChangedOn, lastChangedBy, and content. a different template could provide its own content and substitute in the provided variables; the variables themselves could be rich text with their own confluence macros, or could be selected from drop-downs, etc.",
