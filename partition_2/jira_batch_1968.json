This way, notifications about ALL changes made in the Confluence space will be sent to me.

If we need to search for Questions, or Calendars, for example, we need to jump in the Advanced Search and define the content type we are looking for.\r\n\r\nh3. Suggestion\r\n* Whenever we search for something using either the quick search or the advanced one (with no filters), Confluence should return all the related content with the search string we are searching, so it would return pages, calendars, blogposts, questions, attachments, and whatever the content that matches the search.\r\nIf the users desire to search for a specific kind of content, then they could use the search filters.",

In order support our site to provide\u00a0high availability, scalable capacity, and performance at scale we are planning to cluster our environment by having multiple nodes. So, can you please support us by providing the support and what are all the steps required to follow to migrate to cluster environment. I did follow the below documentation for the setup and I have multiple questions regarding the\u00a0 Step\u00a06. Configure your cluster.\r\n\r\n[https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/set-up-a-confluence-data-center-cluster-982322030.html]\r\n\r\nQuestion 1) Which is the best process to follow to provide the IP's or\u00a0AWS - enter your IAM Role or secret key, and region?\r\n\r\nQuestion 2) if we provide the IP's and if suppose we lost one node and wanted to configure another node and replace the IP. Is there any process or steps we need to follow?\r\n\r\nQuestion 3) can you explain more on the\u00a0The network interface Confluence will use to communicate between nodes. We know about Elastic Network Interface but not sure what exactly needs to provide here?\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nWe currently want to implement this in our Stage Environment and move to prod later after successful migration.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nRamesh",
