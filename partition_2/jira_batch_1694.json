Looking forward to hearing from you.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nSam\r\n",

If you use the standard browser print functionality (right click, print) then the printed pages do not include all the rows, or all the columns, that are visible on screen.

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFCLOUD-34260].\n  {panel}\n\nMy company has been using JIRA, Agile, and Fisheye for several years now.  We are currently evaluating Confluence 5.5.2.  So far, it has received extremely favorable reviews from our development and management teams.  One glaring missing feature, which apparently was available in previous versions of Confluence, is the ability to receive the full content of created/updated page in email notifications.  Many of our team members work a good part of their time outside of our internal network and will not be able to simply click a link on an email and reach our Confluence installation.  We need to see the entire page content in the email itself.  It looks as though the previously existing feature has been requested to be returned over and over again, as in CONF-28503.  \r\n\r\nWell, here is another request to bring back this feature.  Or, can someone explain to me how I can enable this feature in Confluence 5.5.2?  My team wants the ability to simply click on the \"Share\" button and send an email to team members that includes the entire content of the page they are sharing, not just a link back to the page in Confluence.

Would be greateful if someone is able to take a look at these. We are currently using version 5,4,3 of Confluence:\r\n\r\nMajor Confluence errors:\r\n\r\n1.\tPasting from Word with formatting causes the Javascript to hang. This means that in order to paste content from Word into Confluence, the process involves pasting into Notepad of paste-special plain text into another Word document and then copying to the clipboard to paste into Confluence.\r\n2.\tCertain operations cause the cursor to move up one line so that typing starts in the wrong place e.g. in an indented list, after a back tab which moves the indent to the left, the cursor  sometimes jumps up one line.\r\n3.\tPressing tab to indent a line sometimes causes the list to be messed up e.g. a new line is inserted below the indented line\r\n4.\tConfluence search and search and replace doesn't work\r\n5.\tUndo (CTRL-Z) often is unable to undo editing correctly.\r\n6.\tIt is not possible to copy content from one Confluence page to another.\r\n\r\nMinor Confluence errors errors:\r\n7.\tEvery new table cell has a space in it (which has to be manually deleted)\r\n8.\tDoing control-Z to undo can cause the page to jump up (so that the undone line is at the top of the visible page)\r\n9.\tPressing CTRL-F to search causes the IE and Confluence search boxes to appear (a minor problem, and indeed a good thing because Confluence search doesn't work)\r\n\r\n\r\nMissing features in Confluence:\r\n\r\n10.\tNo spell checker \r\n\r\nConfluence and Gliffy UI issues:\r\n\r\n11.\t Gliffy and Confluence have different UIs e.g. shortcut keys e.g. Ctrl-B for bold doesn't work in Gliffy\r\n\r\nGliffy Errors\r\n12.\t It is not possible to change a selected set of objects to be all bold if some of them are already bold i.e. bolding just toggles the state, so any already bolded items must be removed from the selection before selecting bold font (otherwise they are changed to not bold).\r\n13.\tUndo does not work e.g. connectors are not restored to their connected position\r\n\r\nGliffy missing features\r\n14.\tGliffy needs more than one level of undo\r\n\r\n",
