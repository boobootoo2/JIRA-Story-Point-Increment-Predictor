I currently have a process of pre-warning people over email a couple times but processes which rely on people generally don't work that well. ;) Also I can't run around the office telling people I'm shutting the software down since there's 17 offices using Confluence.\r\n\r\nPlease consider the following improvement: Confluence administrators should be able to switch Confluence into \"shutdown mode\". In this mode, new user sessions should be prevented and everyone with an active session should see a standard \"system is going down\" message along with a message written by the administrator. Of course allow saving pages but maybe prevent opening new pages for editing?\r\n\r\nThis would make Confluence a lot more \"enterprise friendly\".

If it was created as a child, or a page exists which links to it, it is impossible to rename it to a shorter name without directly editing the database, because the only way to rename pages which are not orphans is by viewing the page and clicking 'Rename Page'. I believe the problem is the 256 character limit for URLs, which long-titled pages can easily break.\n\nSuggestions for a solution would be:\n\n1. Limit page title length\n2. Provide a place where you can rename unorphaned pages from the Content page (similar to how Orphaned Pages can be renamed).",

      "description": "Reason: \n\nNew connection checking cabapilities have been added: \n\n------------------- forum snip -------------------------\n\nc3p0 does have quite extensive tools to permit you to ensure that Connections your application sees are not stale. By default, c3p0 does no Connection testing at all, because Connnection testing can be expensive. But c3p0 (as of v0.8.5-pre7 and above) provides the following parameters to permit as testing that is as cautious or as loose as you'd like:\n\nc3p0.automaticTestTable\nc3p0.preferredTestQuery\nc3p0.testConnectionOnCheckin\nc3p0.testConnectionOnCheckout [maps to hibernate.c3p0.validate]*\nc3p0.idleConnectionTestPeriod [maps to hibernate.c3p0.idle_test_period]*\n\n* NOTE that where hibernate maps c3p0 params to hibernate config params, hibernate users MUST use the hibernate versions, in your hibernate configuration, or your settings will be overridden by hibernate specified defaults! Other parameters should be specified in a file called c3p0.properties at the root of your application's effective CLASSPATH. [see http://forum.hibernate.org/viewtopic.php?t=934779&highlight= ]\n\nTo reproduce the behavior you are seeing with Proxool -- i.e. to have each Connection tested prior to checkout -- set hibernate.c3p0.validate to true in your hibernate configuration.\n\nTesting every Connection on checkout is the most reliable, but also the most performance costly approach to Connection testing. If you do this with c3p0, I'd recommend you define c3p0.automaticTestTable or c3p0.preferredTestQuery, which may dramatically improve test performance. c3p0.automaticTestTable is the most convenient approach -- just set this to the name of a table c3p0 can create and use to run test queries against.\n\nAnother good approach to connection testing is to define c3p0.testConnectionOnCheckin and c3p0.idleConnectionTestPeriod. This is less reliable than testing in checkout, but has an advantage because check-in and idle tests are performed asynchronously by c3p0, and therefore less directly impact client performance. By setting both of these parameters, you can be assured that your Connection has been tested recently prior to a checkout, without putting the test synchronously in the client's code path. [In hibernate, do be sure to set hibernate.c3p0.idle_test_period in your hibernate config and c3p0.testConnectionOnCheckin separately in c3p0 properties file! See above!] \n\n----------------------- snip --------------------------------\n\nThis may resolve the problem of user's Confluence instances dropping out over night. A good description of the problem: \n\n------------------------ snip -----------------------------\n\nWhat happens (can be reproduced every time) is:\n- A user signs in and does some work on the system.\nHe gets a HTTP-session, a Hibernate session and a connection (on first DB-access)\n\n- The user signs out. Http-session is invalidated. Hibernate session is closed. (session.close)\n\n- DB-Connections are taken down. (DB-session timeout or DB-restart). DB comes back up.\n\n- Time passes. Long enough for all idle DB-connections in the C3P0 pool to time out.\n\n- A user signs on. A new Http-session is generated. A new Hibernate session is created.\n\n- The user tries to access the Database.\nThe connection pool assigns THE OLD, BROKEN connection to the session, which fails consequently. \n\n----------------------  snip ------------------------------------",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFCLOUD-2399].\n  {panel}\n\nI think adding mail list archival to Confluence is a great idea. Personally, I think the\nway we stand right now does not meet what would probably be the usual use case for adding\nmail to a wiki though. Right now, the idea of popping an email box is probably less standard\nof a use case.\n\nHere are some of my thoughts on how to improve mail archiving in Confluence.\n\nA lot of people run lists using an external list system, e.g. mailman. Those systems\ncreate archives already. They are probably run on the same machine as the wiki, so it should \nbe simple to slurp in those archives from disk. Here are some managment functions I'd like:\n\n- Be able to add an archive from a local file path, rather than upload using a Browse button\n- Be able to manage my list archives, e.g. bulk delete of messages\n- Be able to configure a 'watch' over the current archive so new messages can be added at a specific interval.\n\nAlso, we have multiple email lists, it's not clear to me how to keep these separate in\nConfluence right now. I guess one space per list is required. This is non optimal. I would prefer to have a single space that handles all my lists. How about creating a new list management plugin that handled all of this within a space. I should be able to configure multiple lists, multiple archives per list all from a single management screen.\n\nFor a good example of how to present multiple lists, check out Eyebrowse from Tigris.\nhttp://eyebrowse.tigris.org/\n\nTodd\n\n\n\n\n",

I need to be able to create spaces remotely, create space groups with certian global permissions (say some groups with use-confluence, create-space and possibly administrate-confluence previlidges and another group with use-confluence,create-space and others use-confluence) and add users to either of these groups. There seems to be no API support for specifying permissions while adding users/groups at the global level. Additionally, I need to assign user/group permission at the space level. There seems to be no API support for this either. Lastly I need to be able to remove users from the system and delte space group if I delete the space. I did not find any API's for deleting users even groups remotely. Can you provide me with a plugin/adapter that supports these features remote features?\n\nthanks!.",

      "description": "We can still improve the responsiveness of indexing:\n\nSulka's suggestions:\n-----------------\n\n1) For every PDF and PPT file larger than 2 MB, put the files into the indexer queue instead of immediate reindex even during a complete reindex. Make the indexer queue sort the queue by the content size so that when choosing the next file to index, the smallest file size is preferred. This allows all content which indexes quickly do so and the wait to get the index working in the first place is much, much quicker for large installations. \n\n2) Change the reindexing report to be an \"administrative portlet\" in the Dashboard instead of being it's own page - if an admin loses the indexing report page for some reason it's impossible to know when the indexing is supposed to have finished. It takes me 47 minutes to reindex fully and it's awkward to have to have the one page up for the whole time to see if it's completed. \n\n3) Don't reindex immediately during reimporting data, change the system to get up and running first and trigger the indexing after the system is in usable condition. Maybe even make the reindex a manual thing the admin has to trigger? Preferably implement above portlet for monitoring. Or maybe add all files into the queue? \n\nCharles' notes:\n------------\n\n* The major problem is that we tokenise attachments before we put them on the queue. This means that any operation that causes an attachment to be re-indexed will still hang while we analyse it: which can take some time when re-indexing or performing an import over lots of large attachments, or even when you're attaching a large single document to a page.\n\n* The LongRunningTask UI is sub-optimal. When you're in a long running task, you get taken to this one page with no navigation, that you can't ever get back to. We'd be better off changing the re-index so that if you go to the re-index page while one is already in progress, you see the status bar there.\n  ",
