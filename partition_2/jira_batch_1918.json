      "description": "It appears that files pulled from a resource don't cache properly in the browser so they get loaded over and over and over...\r\n\r\nHere's an example:\r\n\r\nResponse Headers - http://www.randombits.org/download/resources/com.adaptavist.confluence.themes.sitebuilder:sitebuilder/icons/document_plain.png\r\n\r\nDate: Wed, 01 Feb 2006 05:52:20 GMT\r\nServer: Resin/3.0.14\r\nContent-Type: image/png\r\nTransfer-Encoding: chunked\r\n\r\n200 OK\r\n\r\nAs you can see, the HTTP header is sparse to say the least.\r\n\r\nHere's an example of an image pulled from a normal web server:\r\n\r\nResponse Headers - http://adaptavist.com/glyphs/about.png\r\n\r\nDate: Wed, 01 Feb 2006 06:09:46 GMT\r\nServer: Apache/1.3.29 (Unix) mod_become/1.3 DAV/1.0.3 mod_perl/1.29 PHP/4.3.9 mod_fastcgi/2.4.2\r\nLast-Modified: Thu, 11 Aug 2005 16:28:48 GMT\r\nEtag: \"50b29b-30e-42fb7cc0\"\r\nAccept-Ranges: bytes\r\nContent-Length: 782\r\nContent-Type: image/png\r\n\r\n200 OK\r\n\r\nAs you can see, there are certain things in the header that would certainly help with caching:\r\n\r\n    * Last-Modified - allow browser to know if it has the correct version of the file\r\n    * Content-Length - allow browser to know if the file is the same size\r\n    * Etag - allows the browser to check it's got the same entity reference\r\n\r\nThen there is the chunked transfer encoding output from the resource URL - I'm just guessing here, but that's going to make it very difficult indeed for the browser to work out if it has the latest file or not? Pretend to be a web browser for a minute, and decide if you'd want to work out if you already had a chunked file cached or not:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec3.html#sec3.6.1\r\n\r\nI don't know which of these things, if any, would actually alter caching, but it seems that if the HTTP headers from resources could be \"fleshed out\" a little to give some extra information, there would be a higher chance of the browser caching resources.\r\n\r\nSo, my question is: Can we output additional HTTP headers AND can we have them sent non-chunked?\r\n\r\nWithout these two vital things, pulling files from resources is going to be slooooowwww. As a growing number of plugins are using resources in this way (images, css, javascript, etc), we're going to see Confluence sites using lots of plugins getting slower and slower.\r\n\r\nIf the servlet that sends out the files uses the jar's date as the Last-Modified and also sends the file normally and puts it's Content-Length on, things should run a lot quicker for all resources pulled from plugins, ie. a Confluence-level optimisation. Of course, there may be times when a resource needs a different date (eg. dynamically created resources) so there would have to be a way to define this. From my understanding, however, resources that are simply pulled form the jar (ie. a file in the jar) will never be dynamic?\r\n\r\nDavid Peterson will no doubt be along shortly to add to this (eg. the idea about dumping the files on to disk so they can be pulled more easily without needing to go in to the jar each time)...\r\n",

It always links to the current page. It seems to be just another form of this type of URL: http://www.isis.jhu.edu/display/ISIS/Status+List.  \r\n\r\nWe are using page history links to document pages at particular snapshots in time.  For example, I edit a page, save it, then go to Info > View Page History to get the \"unique\" URL for the page I just saved.  I use that link as documentation to show what my page looked like on 2/6/2006 at 2pm.  However that URL, even though it contains a pageId always links to whatever the current version of the page is.  The historical linking only works with the URLs under v.X pages.  \r\n\r\nSo to do what I am trying to do, I must go back to the page, edit it, add a slight modification such as a space, then save again. Now my \"current\" page has been pushed back into v.X and I can get a URL that will actually link to the version I saved on 2/6/2006. \r\n\r\nIs this a bug or is it intended to function this way?",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFCLOUD-5385].\n  {panel}\n\nI'm trying to use the Confluence blog functionality to produce a typical looking blog site. I'm getting very close, but one thing that I haven't been able to work out is how to show a concise 'Previous Posts' section. For example, I'd like to base my section on this site (on the right, one page down):\r\n\r\n  http://xooglers.blogspot.com/\r\n\r\nI'd hoped that this would do what I wanted:\r\n\r\n  {blog-posts:5|content=titles} \r\n\r\nbut that renders the titles within a table with multiple columns (Title, Author, Date Posted).\r\n\r\nI'd really like to have a stripped down option that just renders the articles in a <ul> with a unique class so that I can style it in CSS. Based on how other macros work, maybe this should be a 'style=ul' option.\r\n\r\nI know that the plugins are all open source now so I could go implement this myself, but I'm hoping that this seems useful enough that you'll do it for me. :-) If not, any hints you can give me as to how to write this myself would be gratefully appreciated.\r\n",

I strongly suggest that all explicit 'style' tags are excised from the generated HTML and replaced with the equivalent CSS.\r\n\r\nCurrently it is much harder to alter the look of a Confluence page than it should be, and this improvement would go a long way.",

This means, however, that a the templates themselves are actually _more_ powerful (can see more information and perform more operations) than a space administrator.\r\n\r\nIt is feasable, given a well-written layout, that a space administrator could grant themselves the power to do anything a global administrator can do.\r\n\r\nBecause of this, layout editing has been limited to global administrators only. If you want to give someone the power to edit space-level layouts you may as well give them global administrative access, because effectively, that's what you would be doing anyway!\r\n\r\nThe only real solution to this problem is to redesign, from the ground up, how space look and feel customisation works, providing a limited, safe set of capabilities (and probably a custom templating language). This is something we're considering for future Confluence development, but obviously it's a significant task and not something we can just implement overnight.\r\n",

But other tracking systems would want it in the head, or at the bottom of the body.\r\n\r\nIn any case, I think we want an admin function that will let us drop some arbitrary HTML into a page at a certain point.",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFCLOUD-5344].\n  {panel}\n\nPlugin manager events (like Install, Uninstall, Startup, Shutdown, Enable, Disable) should poke the respective plugins so that they can perform assossiated logic, such as shutting down any open JDBC link, or connecting to a server to say \"I'm alive\" - or any reason a plugin developer chooses.\r\n\r\nThere are a number of ways this could be done - and the one I like most (at the time of writing) is the modules themselves could implement PluginInstalled, PluginEnabled (etc) interfaces, and the class is instanciated and the method in the interface called during the event. If  there is already an instance (such as in the case of a component) it should be used, otherwise in the case of a macro it could be created and destroyed just for the event calling.\r\n\r\nOther implementation ideas welcome!

      "description": "It would be really useful if Confluence had a virtual space.\r\n\r\nA virtual space is much like a normal space, it has configuration (permissions, theme, layout) *BUT* does not have its own content, it uses the content of another space.\r\n\r\nThe use-case is that a project wants to use a website-like layout (no user specific data, common navigation, etc) for its main website, but still wants the current wiki-layout to edit/manage the content.\r\n\r\nA related example, is the ActiveMQ project hosted at the Codehaus.  Its main website is using Confluenza (a simple script to scrape data from Confluence and render it as a website):\r\n\r\n    http://activemq.codehaus.org/\r\n\r\nThis site's content maps directly to the pages under:\r\n\r\n    http://docs.codehaus.org/display/ACTIVEMQ/Home\r\n\r\nConfluence could be configured directly to render the first, but by doing so it looses some of the nice wiki-like features for editing the content on the second URL.\r\n\r\nSo, why not allow both to be used inside of Confluence?  So, that is basic idea of a virtual space, it has its own perms/layout configuration, but uses another spaced content.\r\n\r\nThis is somewhat related to:\r\n\r\n    http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Running+Confluence+Behind+a+Caching+Proxy+Server\r\n\r\nSome of the projects that use Confluenza at the Codehaus are moving to Apache, and currently Apache's Infra group does not want to run Confluence (or Confluenza) due to scaling problems.  So, some people (myself and James included) have been looking into alternative ways to fix this problem.  Some of which involve reinventing the style/layout/theme support that Confluence already has, then rendering the site to HTML periodically to make ASF Infra happy.\r\n\r\nBut, it would be ideal if we did not have to rewrite the layout/theme, but could just reuse Confluence for this... and still keep the regular confluence layout for editing.\r\n\r\nVirtualized spaces would really add some added flexibility and power to Confluence, quite possibly making it the most powerful wiki in the know universe... or isn't that already the case ;-)",
