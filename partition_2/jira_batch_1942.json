However, most of the directories I could think of have a mix of documents, presentations, PDFs, or text files. Importing a directory with a mix of these is not useful.  It would be great if the import could be made more intelligent by creating pages for certain extensions (txt) and allowing other extensions (doc, pdf, prs, xls, ...) to be imported as attachments.  What page would the attachments belong to?  Perhaps all on the same page named after the directory it came from? Perhaps a user specified page? Perhaps each attachment is its own page with the name taken from the file like the current support?  The last option is probably the most flexible and easier to start with.",

The user would be able to configure their profile to suppress this notification after they \"get it.\"\n\nIf a page is \"brainstorming\" type of page that expects lots of discussion, it might also be useful to tag the page to only permit comments from users who do not have edit rights.\n\nIn summary, the only real advantage to comments that I see, is in a high volume situation where comments don't result in concurrent edit conflicts.  In smaller organizations, conflicts may not be a big enough problem to justify it.\n\n\n",
