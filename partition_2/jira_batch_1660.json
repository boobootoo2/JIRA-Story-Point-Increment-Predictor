Different R&D groups are expressing interested in using Confluence.  We are curious about best practices, advise, or considerations that Atlassian support can offer as we look into expanding usage of confluence.  For example:\r\n\r\n* How does having multiple confluence instances plugged into one JIRA instance impact usability?  Administration? Performance?\r\n* Is there some limit that is recommended?  \r\n* Are there best practices for organizing spaces or handling administration for a large organization that might be available for us to consider?\r\n* Are there licensing cost implications for various instances?\r\n\r\nI look forward to feedback.  We have a few meetings planned in the next couple weeks and this input will be important for our discussion.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nLinda",

Feature Summary\r\n\r\nSupport Asciidoctor-backed AsciiDoc in:\r\n\r\n* the WYSIWYG editor,\r\n* through Stash (see https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/STASH-4769)\r\n* through the API directly. \r\n\r\nThe unicorns and rainbows solution I'm looking for here is to:\r\n\r\n* Write my docs in AsciiDoc\r\n* Version Control docs files in Stash\r\n* Push directly to a confluence node using a \"Publish\" button. (OH YEAH)\r\n\r\nBut I'd honestly just settle for native AsciiDoc (Asciidoctor tooling) support in Stash and the API so I can push easily.\r\n\r\nh2. Challenge\r\n\r\nFor me, the way I\"m using the Atlassian solution suite is using Stash and AsciiDoc together with Confluence to achieve that elusive writing Zen. That, and I want to single-source my content as much as possible for reuse among the documents I'm writing, and then push the end result to Confluence as a static page.  \r\n\r\nThe problem is my Zen is being interrupted when I try to push AsciiDoc into Confluence.\r\n\r\nIn short: I can't. :(\r\n\r\nh2. Attempted Workarounds\r\n\r\nAs there is no support natively at the moment, I need to use 3rd party Ruby tools to attempt to push content in, but these tools are not really working out (due to enhancements required to these tools - bugs raised).\r\n\r\nWhen that fails, I need to transform my AsciiDoc files using Asciidoctor and then try to push the HTML directly into the code view of the Editing Window. The problem with that is due to the admonition macros and other rich content stuff Confluence uses, the beautiful Foundation styles and eye-pleasing Admonition blocks are changed to the Confluence style, and look amateurish. Which makes me look amateurish as a Technical Writer.\r\n\r\nOne of my DevOps guys has offered to create a buildbox that houses all the Ruby stuff I need to push static HTML into Confluence and listens on Stash Commit Hooks, but that seems overly complex when it would be better to just support AsciiDoc alongside Markdown.\r\n\r\nh2. Final Summary\r\n\r\nMost professional TechComms professionals will tell you that separating content from presentation is the way to writing Zen. Probe Technical Writers further and they'll probably start talking about ways they use a VCS to control their documentation and manage content reuse.\r\n\r\nAsciiDoc is the type of language that Tech Writers use when they are faced with creating complex douments. Many Markdown syntax items (such as admonitions) are a kludge-fest to get working compared to AsciiDoc, and having to do this make Tech Writers stabby and makes their teeth itch.\r\n\r\nPlease, help Tech Writers work efficiently and effectively using the Atlassian stack of products in a writing language that supports their advanced writing needs.",

That can happen easily. In the [documentation|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Connecting+to+Crowd+or+JIRA+for+User+Management#ConnectingtoCrowdorJIRAforUserManagement-ConnectingConfluencetoJIRAforUserManagement], there is no instruction regarding creating {{confluence-administrators}} group in JIRA as a first step. \r\n\r\nSo, once connected and positioned at the top of the directory list, no-one will have access to confluence any longer - not even the default administrator account. The default administrator account is called admin. An account by the same name also exists in JIRA, but that account is not in the {{confluence-administrators}}} group either. Hence you managed to lock yourself out.\r\n\r\nAnother thing, after log out and login, the admin user do not have {{confluence-administrator}} permission.\r\n\r\n*Workaround*\r\nFollow this [guideline|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Restore+Passwords+To+Recover+Admin+User+Rights#RestorePasswordsToRecoverAdminUserRights-Step3.PuttheInternalDirectoryinFirstPosition] or upgrade Confluence to 5.8.8 version.\r\n\r\n*Suggestions*\r\n\r\nUpdate the documentation and teach user to used the right steps.",

Notes\r\n\r\nThis is a problem with how the JIRA Gadget code utilizes the application link.  Individual features can choose between the BaseUrl, ApplicationUrl, and DisplayUrl when constructing links.  Urls for browser-to-app communication such as links, images, JavaScript, and style sheets should use the DisplayUrl.  URLs for app-to-app communication should use the ApplicationUrl.\r\n\r\nApplication links can be configured with an ApplicationUrl that is \"internal only\", e.g it bypasses the proxy, etc. that is used to provide the BaseUrl used from a browser to access the app.  This is frequently done for performance to reduce load on the proxy and speed up app-to-app communication by avoiding the overhead of SSL.  If the ApplicationUrl is not accessible from a browser and a JIRA feature uses it to construct a link or load a static resource this will be broken when using a split routing application link.\r\n\r\n",

You need to actually \"click\" insert for the anchor link to properly save. However this seems inefficient and I think most average users would have an expectation to be able to create the link successfully simply by typing the anchor name and then hitting the enter key on their keyboard as it is faster to do this as well.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nJade (ex-employee)",

Problem Definition\r\n\r\nWhen there are many child pages on a single page eg: 25000 child pages , the page load time is high approximately 1 minute.\r\nWhen we disable the child pages by modifying the documentation theme ([as mentioned here|https://confluence.atlassian.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=227416166] ) this load time comes down to under 1 second.\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nThere is a similar improvement request here : https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONF-5494\r\nHowever, we can have a new feature in Documentation theme as well as the default theme where only 50 child pages are displayed and if want a full list of child pages we can have a link which will display all the child pages of the page.\r\n\r\nFor Documentation Theme the child pages appear at the bottom while for the default theme they appear in the sidebar , so this feature should be applicable to both the themes.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Currently, there is no easy way to inactivate users in bulk within the the user interface of Confluence. The only methods to do this are through the SOAP API through add-ons such as [Confluence CLI|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/org.swift.confluence.cli] or non-marketplace solutions such as [Bulk disable users for JIRA and Confluence|http://www.tieto.com/industries/telecom/tietos-solutions-network-equipment-providers/tietos-solutions-network-equipment-providers-rd-efficiency-excellence/development-platform-service/atlassian-services/atlassian-plugins] which are not Confluence Admin-friendly, but rather require some additional efforts to run correctly, and are prone to error by a Confluence Admin.\r\n\r\nThe pain point here is that many Premier clients who previously had *unlimited* licenses are now having to police their licensing to fit within the Data Center licensing limits, some are struggling to inactivate thousands of users and other objects which were sync'd across through LDAP sync and now count against their Datacenter license count. \r\n\r\nWhen moving from 10000 users down to 2000 users, a manual solution is not effective at inactivating users (one at a time). Having to buy a third-party add-on to then spend more money to get to Datacenter with fewer users is a hard sell to a client that is intending to expand their use of Confluence and makes the process painful and should be addressed as this is a major blocker on upgrade and expansion of Data Center.\r\n\r\nIf we offered a method to paginate through users and set them to inactive through a checkbox on the UI, we could help alleviate the pain of the migration",

Summary\r\nIn Confluence Cloud, when a *JIRA Issues Macro* is used to add an issue in JIRA, the description field is not being rendered properly. As per the documentation on *[JIRA Issues Macro|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/ConfCloud/JIRA+Issues+Macro]*:\r\n\r\nbq.

Otherwise, such formatted fields will be escaped within the output of the JIRA issues macro.\r\n\r\nIf the instance has both JIRA and Confluence, the application links are set by default.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to reproduce:\r\n# Check the *Application Links* between JIRA and Confluence to make sure they are correctly set\r\n# Create a new page in Confluence\r\n# Fill in the header of the page with the title\r\n# In the table enter several example lines in a table as below\r\n# Save the page\r\n# Highlight the first *Summary* entry in the table and click the *Create JIRA issue* symbol above the highlighted words\r\n# At the pop-up, select a _Project_ and _Issue Type_.\r\n# Click the suggestion (i) to _Create 2 issues from this table_\r\n# Click *Create*\r\n\r\n{panel:title=Test Table}\r\n|| Summary || Description || \r\n| Test abc | Test description\r\n* aaa\r\n* bbb\r\n* ccc\r\n* ddd |\r\n| Test abc2 | Test description\r\n* aaa2\r\n* bbb2\r\n* ccc2\r\n* ddd2 |\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\nExpected Behaviour:\r\nFor the *Description* field in the created JIRA Issues to be rendered properly, in this case with bullet points.\r\n\r\nCurrent Behaviour:\r\n*Description* field data will all be in one line without bullets\r\n\r\nh3. *Workaround*\r\nManually edit the *Description* field to reflect the formatting.

Problem\r\nAdministrators sometimes need to [rebuild the ancestor table|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Rebuilding+the+Ancestor+Table]. This process has no progress report on the UI, moreover by default it does not log anything.\r\n\r\nThis is problematic, as in many cases the reverse-proxy used in front of Confluence will timeout the client request, however this does not terminate the java thread processing the rebuild. So problems to tackle here:\r\n- Progress bar on the admin UI to report the status \r\n-- Preferably putting the task as a one-time scheduled job, so that if the proxy times out, the status can still be monitored\r\n- Log the start and the end of the process\r\n-- Consider logging the percentage of the progress\r\n\r\nh4. Workaround\r\n- You can [enable debug logging|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Configuring+Logging] for the class {{com.atlassian.confluence.pages.ancestors}}, which then will show the progress with the following format: {noformat}\r\n2015-08-14 10:27:12,883 DEBUG [http-nio-8090-exec-1] [confluence.admin.actions.ConfigureLog4jAction] add New logger [ com.atlassian.confluence.pages.ancestors ] saved\r\n2015-08-14 10:27:30,997 INFO [http-nio-8090-exec-9] [confluence.pages.ancestors.HibernatePageAncestorManager] clearAncestorsCollectionCache Clearing ancestors cache ...\r\n2015-08-14 10:27:30,998 INFO [http-nio-8090-exec-9] [confluence.pages.ancestors.HibernatePageAncestorManager] clearAncestorsCollectionCache Ancestors cache cleared.\r\n2015-08-14 10:27:31,000 INFO [http-nio-8090-exec-9] [confluence.pages.ancestors.HibernatePageAncestorManager] rebuild updating Learn the wonders of autoconvert (step 7 of 9)[98305] (1/9)\r\n2015-08-14 10:27:31,001 INFO [http-nio-8090-exec-9] [confluence.pages.ancestors.HibernatePageAncestorManager] rebuild updating Lay out your page (step 6 of 9)[98306] (2/9)\r\n2015-08-14 10:27:31,001 INFO [http-nio-8090-exec-9] [confluence.pages.ancestors.HibernatePageAncestorManager] rebuild updating Prettify the page with an image (step 4 of 9)[98307] (3/9)\r\n2015-08-14 10:27:31,002 INFO [http-nio-8090-exec-9] [confluence.pages.ancestors.HibernatePageAncestorManager] rebuild updating Tell people what you think in a comment (step 8 of 9)[98308] (4/9)\r\n2015-08-14 10:27:31,002 INFO [http-nio-8090-exec-9] [confluence.pages.ancestors.HibernatePageAncestorManager] rebuild updating Get serious with a table (step 5 of 9)[98309] (5/9)\r\n2015-08-14 10:27:31,002 INFO [http-nio-8090-exec-9] [confluence.pages.ancestors.HibernatePageAncestorManager] rebuild updating What is Confluence?

Select jiraIssueMacroServerParamsUpgradeTask\r\n3. Click on \"Force Upgrade\"\r\n4. Check-out the Confluence log file\r\n\r\nActual result:\r\nThe front-end shows \"Upgrade succeeded. Check the log for details.\". The log reports success, but also contains a bunch of failure notes (see full log attachment) like:\r\n2015-08-12 11:51:09,477 INFO [jira-issue-macro-migration:thread-1] [xhtml.migration.macro.JiraIssueMacroServerParamsMigrator] processParams Failed to update JIRA issue macro: the macro params did not define a server name\r\n\r\nand the summary reports:\r\n85 JIRA Issue macro(s) could not be updated\r\n\r\nExpected result:\r\nThe front-end shows \"Upgrade succeeded. Check the log for details.\" and the log reporting no failures to update any issue macro.\r\n\r\nIt turns out that in-fact all of the relevant entries in the DB are correctly migrated and contain the proper serverID-parameter.\r\nRunning the following query on the DB shows no longer any matches after running the upgrade task:\r\nSELECT *\r\nFROM (SELECT * FROM bodycontent where body like '%<ac:structured-macro ac:name=\"jira\">%') AS sb\r\nWHERE body not like '%<ac:parameter ac:name=\"serverId\">%'\r\nand contentid in (SELECT contentid FROM CONTENT WHERE CONTENTTYPE = 'PAGE' AND PREVVER IS NULL);\r\n\r\nMy suspicion would be that the log report simply glitches with old entries in the DB which are not touched intentionally by the upgrade process. Namely these entries would be:\r\n- from pages which were removed\r\n- older versions of a page\r\n\r\nBoth of these don't get their entries updated by the upgrade task (as I've been told by support this is intentional) and doesn't cause any problem (of course up until u try to restore that old page/version, but that's known behavior of Confluence and by design as far as I'm aware).\r\n\r\nCould it be that the log simply does report these entries (incorrectly)? If so, I guess the bug would be that these matches are still reported in the log and counted into the statistics, which they should not.",
