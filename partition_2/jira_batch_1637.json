However, on long pages with many separate sections, and multiple section column-layout variations there is no way to expand and collapse one entire (say, 2 or 3-column) section itself.\r\n\r\nTo get the same effect, the Expand macro would need to be added to a 'single-column section', encapsulating multiple Column macros each containing the panels (or content) that would naturally display in separate sections (in the 'Edit' page view).\r\n\r\nThis becomes important when it would be helpful to collapse (multi-column) sections when viewing a page - but also retain the same visual layout where many team members also are editing content on that page.  The whole Expand, Column, Panel/Content formatting makes the Edit view a mess and difficult for some to easily locate content they need to edit!",

Steps to replicate :\r\n # Install Confluence 5.10 and JIRA 7.0.9 core (Issue can be replicated with JIRA software 7.0.1 as well)\r\n # Integrate Confluence with JIRA\r\n # Create JIRA project named jiratest with the project key JIR\r\n # Create a JIRA issue in that project\r\n # Login to Confluence 5.10 and create a new Space\r\n # In the new Space create a new a page named test jira\r\n # Insert a JIRA macro for JIR-1 and set to show the following column only in the display options :\r\n Summary, Created, Updated, Due Date, Reporter, Priority, Status, Resolution\r\n # Insert another JIRA macro for JIR-1 and set to show the following column only in the display options :\r\n Issue Type, Created, Updated, Assignee\r\n\r\n*Existing behavior* : Both JIRA macro is showing the exact column that is being set by the first JIRA macro created on the page as you can see from the screenshot below :\r\n !testJiraMacro.jpg|thumbnail!\r\n You can also see that the second JIRA macro shown have the following columns :\r\n !testJiraMacro2.jpg|thumbnail!\r\n *Expected behavior* : Both JIRA macro should show the appropriate columns configured.\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nClick edit on the page then click edit on the JIRA macro that is showing the wrong column. From there insert the JIRA macro back to the page and the issue should be resolved.\r\n\r\n*Please note that this issue will occur on existing pages if Confluence is being upgraded from earlier version to Confluence 5.10*\r\n\r\nh3. Resolution\r\nThanks again for your patience everyone. We have now released fixed versions of JIRA Macros to the Marketplace. JIRA Macros version 6.0.12 is compatible with Confluence 5.10.x, and JIRA Macros version 7.1.4 is compatible with Confluence version 6.0.x. \r\n\r\nYou can update JIRA Macros by going to Admin > Manage Add ons, and the update will be available for all compatible versions there.\r\n\r\nIf the update is not listed and you are on Confluence 5.9 or below, you will need to upgrade Confluence to get this fix.\r\n\r\nThe fixed version will be bundled in Confluence 6.0.2, so no action needs to be taken if you are using 6.0.2 or above.",

Steps to reproduce\r\n# On a given page, add a comment including an image\r\n# Add a second comment with a unrelated image, but with the same filename\r\n\r\nh2. Expected behavior\r\nThe original comment will reference the original image, while the new comment displays the new image\r\n\r\nh2. Actual behavior\r\nBecause both images have the same filename, Confluence creates a new version of the original image. As a result, both new and old comments now display the new image, thereby losing the attachment's context.\r\n\r\nh2. Additional notes\r\n* This is also true of attachments uploaded via any other mechanism (Page Editor, drag and drop, More Actions > Attachments, etc)\r\n* This behavior is not restricted to images. All attachments will behave this way\r\n* This is common for filenames that are generic, e.g. \"logo.png\" or \"screenshot.jpg\"\r\n\r\nh2. Propose solutions\r\n* *Proposal 1*: In comments, specifically refer to attachments by their specific version, rather than always the latest version\r\n* *Proposal 2*: Warn the user during upload if an attachment filename already exists on the page. We can additionally offer an option to rename the file or to continue and create a new version of the existing file",

This is normally not an issue.. just sit it out and wait. We know it's processing. The issue comes into play when you use a proxy in front of it such as nginx. nginx views that as a timeout with default settings. This timeout breaks the process in the middle of it and corrupts the install. A simple fix would be to not use nginx, but I like using https when sending my password for my database over the internet and I don't like opening up non-web ports on my firewall. Additionally.. you could also be like me and have it take 4 hours for you to realize it's not a you problem, but rather a configuration problem. I view this as a bug, but you might consider it a feature request.. I'll leave that up to you.. but you should really treat the process differently than you are and just have the page dynamically update with the progress instead of just letting it \"process\" in a way that something can view as the web page going unresponsive.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. install/set up nginx as proxy for confluence port\r\n2. install confluence\r\n3. configure confluence\r\n4. wait for timeout and refresh.. you'll get a 500 stack trace of a java thread",

Problem statement\r\nCurrently, page restrictions only allow you to define a set of users and groups that _can_ view or edit a page.\r\n\r\nh5. Suggested solution\r\nSometimes an administrator or page owner wants to set the page restrictions of a page in Confluence to be viewable/editable by all users in Confluence except for a select few.\r\n\r\nIn that scenario, it is practically far, much easier if there is a \"blocked\" permission as well, where the administrator or page owner can straight away define the set of users who *don't have permission* to view/edit the page.\r\n\r\nh5. Example\r\nI want to set the page restrictions for Page A whereby only 95 out of 100 users in Confluence can view the page.\r\n\r\nAll 95 users are scattered across different groups and do not belong in a single common group. It is impractical to individually list out all 95 users, compared to listing the 5 users who can't view the page.",

Summary\r\nJira Issues Macro is not displaying custom date fields in the user time zone (Confluence), but rather the server time zone (Confluence)\r\n\r\nh5. Environment\r\nConfluence with applink to Jira\r\n\r\nh5. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# In Jira, create a ticket with a custom date field and a custom date time field.\r\n# Set the Jira user time zone to be different to the server time zone so that the custom fields display a different date.\r\n# In Confluence, create a page with this issue and set the display option to table format with the custom fields.\r\n# Set the Confluence user time zone to be the same as the Jira user time zone (assuming Confluence Server time zone is same as Jira).\r\n\r\nh5. Expected Results\r\nCustom date and date time fields in Jira and Confluence display the same date and time.\r\n\r\nh5. Actual Results\r\nCustom date and date time fields in Jira is displayed correctly according to user time zone settings while Confluence displays custom date and date time fields in Confluence Server time zone.\r\nCustom date time fields can also be truncated to just the date and show the wrong date (in server time zone)\r\n\r\nh5. Notes\r\nThis behaviour is seen on both cloud and confluence server.\r\nJira rest endpoint is returning the custom date and custom date time fields in Jira user time zone eg {{<customfieldvalue>Wed, 20 Jul 2016 18:48:00 +0200</customfieldvalue>}}, JIM macro is incorrectly transforming this to Confluence server time zone instead of Confluence user time zone.\r\n\r\nh5.

      "description": "During setup of self hosted, there are a couple times where the system appears to \"hang\" because it is processing data (e.g. creating db, restoring content, etc.). This is normally not an issue.. just sit it out and wait. We know it's processing. The issue comes into play when you use a proxy in front of it such as nginx. nginx views that as a timeout with default settings. This timeout breaks the process in the middle of it and corrupts the install. A simple fix would be to not use nginx, but I like using https when sending my password for my database over the internet and I don't like opening up non-web ports on my firewall. Additionally.. you could also be like me and have it take 4 hours for you to realize it's not a you problem, but rather a configuration problem. I view this as a bug, but you might consider it a feature request.. I'll leave that up to you.. but you should really treat the process differently than you are and just have the page dynamically update with the progress instead of just letting it \"process\" in a way that something can view as the web page going unresponsive.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. install/set up nginx as proxy for confluence port\r\n2. install confluence\r\n3. configure confluence\r\n4. wait for timeout and refresh.. you'll get a 500 stack trace of a java thread",

      "description": "h2. Steps to reproduce\r\n# Install a blueprint plugin containing templates\r\n# Click the \"Create\" button to populate the template listing\r\n# Go to Confluence Admin > Global Templates and Blueprints and modify a template from the blueprint\r\n# Install a newer version of the blueprint plugin with some templates added or removed\r\n# Click the \"Create\" button and observe the template listing\r\n\r\nh2. Expected behavior\r\n* New templates from the updated blueprint plugin are added to the Create dialog\r\n* Templates removed from the updated blueprint plugin are removed from the Create dialog\r\n* Templates that have not changed in the updated blueprint plugin, but was previously modified in the UI should keep their modifications\r\n* Templates that have changed with the updated blueprint plugin, and was also previously modified in the UI should be \"reset\" to the new default template provided by the plugin, OR continue to be overridden by modifications\r\n\r\nh2. Actual behavior\r\nIn the Create dialog, none of the templates actually reflect the templates packaged with the updated blueprint plugin. To the user, it effectively appears as if the blueprint was never updated\r\n\r\nh2. Technical details\r\nThis issue concerns the following three tables:\r\n* *AO_54C900_CONTENT_BLUEPRINT_AO* - where the blueprint metadata is stored\r\n* *AO_54C900_C_TEMPLATE_REF* - where the template references are stored\r\n* *pagetemplates* - where the actual contents of any modified templates are stored\r\n\r\nWhen a blueprint plugin is installed, and the user opens the Create dialog the following occurs:\r\n* A row is added to \"AO_54C900_CONTENT_BLUEPRINT_AO\" with the \"PLUGIN_CLONE\" set to \"t\". This indicates that none of the blueprint's templates have been modified from the defaults.\r\n* Similarly, \"AO_54C900_C_TEMPLATE_REF\" stores all of the template references, and is tied to the first table via the \"CB_INDEX_PARENTID\" and \"CB_PARENTID\" columns. All of the \"TEMPLATE_ID\" values are set to \"0\", which indicates they have not been modified from the default.\r\n\r\nWhen a template is modified, the following occurs:\r\n* \"AO_54C900_CONTENT_BLUEPRINT_AO\" creates a new row, with \"PLUGIN_CLONE\" set to \"f\" indicating that one or more of its templates have deviated from the default\r\n* \"AO_54C900_C_TEMPLATE_REF\" creates a new set of templates (on top of the existing set), each referencing the new ID of the new row in the first table. The modified template also has a non-zero \"TEMPLATE_ID\" value\r\n* Rows are added to the \"pagetemplates\" containing the modified template contents, while referencing to the previous table by \"template_id\" as well as \"prevver\".\r\n* The Create dialog now displays the modified template listing associated with the \"AO_54C900_CONTENT_BLUEPRINT_AO\" whose \"PLUGIN_CLONE\" value is \"f\"\r\n\r\nFinally, when a new version of the blueprint plugin is subsequently updated, the following occurs:\r\n* \"AO_54C900_CONTENT_BLUEPRINT_AO\" remains unchanged\r\n* \"AO_54C900_C_TEMPLATE_REF\" updates its template listing, now referencing the unmodified blueprint (\"PLUGIN_CLONE\" = \"t\") in the first table. All of the entries referencing the modified blueprint (\"PLUGIN_CLONE\" = \"f\") remains unchanged\r\n* The Create dialog continues to show all the templates associated with the \"modified\" blueprint, effectively ignoring all of the changes from the new blueprint update\r\n\r\nh4. Proposed solution\r\nThe blueprint plugin update should correctly update the \"AO_54C900_C_TEMPLATE_REF\" template references to point to the modified blueprint, as well as retain any template modifications (assuming the template themselves have not changed between versions)\r\n\r\nh2. Workaround\r\n* Back up (if desired) and remove all template customizations for that blueprint via SQL (see below) in order for the templates from the new blueprint to show up.\r\n* Add the customizations back in afterwards, as needed\r\n\r\nh4. SQL to remove blueprint template customizations\r\n(!) *Backup your database prior to running the below. It is also recommended to run this on your test environment first*\r\nIn all queries below, \"my.blueprint.plugin.key\" is a placeholder and should be substituted with your actual blueprint plugin key.\r\n{code:sql}\r\nDELETE FROM pagetemplates\r\nWHERE prevver IN (\r\n  SELECT \"TEMPLATE_ID\" FROM \"AO_54C900_C_TEMPLATE_REF\"\r\n  WHERE \"PLUGIN_MODULE_KEY\" LIKE 'my.blueprint.plugin.key%'\r\n    AND \"TEMPLATE_ID\" != 0)\r\nOR templateid IN (\r\n  SELECT \"TEMPLATE_ID\" FROM \"AO_54C900_C_TEMPLATE_REF\"\r\n  WHERE \"PLUGIN_MODULE_KEY\" LIKE 'my.blueprint.plugin.key%'\r\n    AND \"TEMPLATE_ID\" != 0);\r\n{code}\r\n{code:sql}\r\nDELETE FROM \"AO_54C900_C_TEMPLATE_REF\"\r\nWHERE \"CB_INDEX_PARENTID\" IN (\r\n  SELECT \"ID\"\r\n  FROM \"AO_54C900_CONTENT_BLUEPRINT_AO\"\r\n  WHERE \"PLUGIN_MODULE_KEY\" LIKE 'my.blueprint.plugin.key%'\r\n    AND \"PLUGIN_CLONE\" = 'f')\r\nOR \"CB_PARENTID\" IN (\r\n  SELECT \"ID\"\r\n  FROM \"AO_54C900_CONTENT_BLUEPRINT_AO\"\r\n  WHERE \"PLUGIN_MODULE_KEY\" LIKE 'my.blueprint.plugin.key%'\r\n    AND \"PLUGIN_CLONE\" = 'f');\r\n{code}\r\n{code:sql}\r\nDELETE FROM \"AO_54C900_CONTENT_BLUEPRINT_AO\"\r\nWHERE \"PLUGIN_MODULE_KEY\" LIKE 'my.blueprint.plugin.key%'\r\n  AND \"PLUGIN_CLONE\" = 'f';\r\n{code}  \r\n",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFCLOUD-42820].\n  {panel}\n\nIn Confluence there are currently two ways to connect to the database:\r\n* Via a Direct JDBC connection, wherein the connection config is set in <confluence_home>/confluence.cfg.xml and the connection pooling is managed by c3p0\r\n* Via a Tomcat Datasource, where the connection config are set in <confluence_install>/conf/server.xml, and the connection pooling is managed by Tomcat\r\n\r\nWhile this gives the customer more flexibility, it also adds additional complexity during setup and upgrades. This choice has been in Confluence as far back as I can remember, but are we adding any value by having both? For example, the Tomcat Datasource seems to do a decent job and is [well-dcoumented|https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-8.0-doc/jndi-resources-howto.html]. Would the product be easier to maintain (for customers and for us) in the long run in just having the Tomcat Datasource as the sole option? (We can also further simplify the process by having the server.xml content be populated from the UI instead of having to manually edit the file.)\r\n\r\nFor what it's worth, customers have encountered several bugs with c3p0 in the past, some of which forced them to move to a Tomcat Datasource as a workaround anyway:\r\n* https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONF-36484\r\n* https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONF-33514\r\n* https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONF-25531\r\n* https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONF-42685\r\n\r\nI realize I may be missing some key reasons for having both options (in which case please close this issue), but I wanted to bring this up in case it's one of those things that's only in the product because of legacy reasons that are now obsolete.",
