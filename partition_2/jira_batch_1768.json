We've got to ideads in mind, on the one hand we need an additional Check Box on the LogIn Page with a Link to a PDF File , which contains the Guideline Terms, without checking it the user must not be able to log in, and there has to be something like a mark in the user directory set to each user who already accepted the guidlines; furthermore if the designated Administrator would update the PDF File, every user must accept the updated terms before being able to log in.\r\n\r\nThe other idea was , having a Wiki Page containing the Guidline to which every User is redirected after Logging in, to accept the Guidline in case of not accepting there must be a fall back to the log in screen.\r\n\r\nAnyway , is it possible to hook up something like this?\r\n\r\nps.\r\nI've attached a possible mockup\r\n\r\n",

Upgrade the instance of Confluence to a version using storage format (i.e. 4.0+)\r\n\r\nYou'll find that the link you added is now rendered as plain text (and not recognised to be a link)\r\n\r\nh3. Considerations\r\nIt's unclear whether this is actually a bug.

Add the Include Page macro to TEST:whatever\r\n- Start typing \"RES:glos\" in the \"Page to Include\" parameter (presuming it's gonna return \"RES:Glossary\", \"Resources:Glossary\", or just \"Glossary\" from the Resources namespace)\r\n- ...but no results are returned (\"Not Found\")\r\n- Unfortunately, dropping the key (RES will return all pages starting with \"glos\" with no obvious indication of what space it belongs to (unless you sequentially hover over every... single... one of them for the tooltip hint of what space it's in, and that could be a lot of hovering--especially if multiple spaces have pages called \"Glossary\")\r\n- Even when you type the entire proper name of the page (\"RES:Glossary\") in the field, it will still say \"Not Found\", but if you continue anyway and save the page, everything works fine, and the RES:Glossary page is correctly included.\r\n\r\nAs a side note, it'd be cool if you guys just copied something similar to the UI of the Insert Link box, but instead changing the space dropdown to be a suggest-as-you-type input box (that way, you could type long-form space names in case you forget the short-form key, or just leave the space box blank for ALL, finding the pages across all spaces). Of course, that's wayyy more of a feature request, and for now I'd obviously be happy for the time being if it simply took the space key into account (i.e., the issue above).",

Depending on whether you use the arrow keys plus shift to select the item or the mouse you may cut the whole item including the macro, or you may cut the text out from inside the macro but leave the macro in place. It seems partially selecting the macro text helps cut the entire macro but selecting all of it will pull out the text from inside. \r\n\r\nAlso, create 2 nested lists several levels deep. Cut some branch from one list and try to paste it into another list.

This cannot be fixed in Crowd. The CrowdService doesn't even know it is, or needs to be running in a transaction due to the fact that it is invoking an SPI, and the SPI implementation is what dictates if a transaction needs to be in play, and in this case it is the Hibernate 2 SPI implementation from Confluence that requires mutation calls to be run within a transaction..\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nWould prefer not to have to wrap calls to Crowd API in transaction in Atlassian Confluence plugin code. See: https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CWD-2745\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration in this matter. There is a workaround, but having to use transactions is poorly documented and not intuitive.",

Fix\r\nChange the case of the username back to what it was in the source system. This must match the case in Confluence to avoid these sync issues.\r\n\r\nh4. Workaround\r\nForcing a sync, or waiting for the automatic task, will restore the membership to the table as there is no longer a row to conflict with in the cwd_membership table.\r\n\r\nh5. Secondary Workaround\r\nIf the preceding workaround does not work please try enacting the following steps to force remove all the of the groups.\r\n\r\n1. Login to Confluence admin\r\n2. Turn off naive DN matching\r\n3. Perform full directory sync\r\n4. Turned on naive DN matching\r\n5. Perform full directory sync",
