The rest of confluence will still work for some time, but after several hours the instance usually stops responding completely, and confluence needs to be restarted.\r\n\r\nA suspected cause for this is usernames with spaces in them that were bulk imported from another system. For example a username would be \"john doe\".\r\n\r\nThere is a separate bug to be filed regarding issues with spaces in usernames (when a user with a space in their username tries to reset their password, they get into a loop where the can't do so because it's only recognizing the first part of their username before the space).",

      "description": "The RTE produces surprising results when using the delete key at the beginning of a line, when applied to a line that already has formatting.\r\n\r\nFor example, create a new page and enter the following:\r\n\r\n{code}\r\nLine 1.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Line 3.\r\n\r\nLine 4.\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nNote that line 2 is blank and contains no text. (Just press enter.) The editor should appear as shown in ss1.png.\r\n\r\nNext, click with the pointer at the beginning of line 3. Then press <delete> (or <backspace> if you're on a PC). The results are as shown in ss2.png.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that Confluence is deleting the style applied to line 3 when the <delete> key is pressed. This behavior would make complete sense if line 2 had any content (since the text \"Line 3\" would end up being joined with line 2 text in what is effectively a paragraph style). However, the behavior is not intuitive when line 2 is a blank line.\r\n\r\nIn this case, it seems clear to me that the user's intent is to delete the blank line above where the cursor lives, without changing any styles.\r\n\r\n(For what it's worth, I see that Microsoft Word also works the way I described when used with paragraph styles.)\r\n\r\nUpdate:\r\n\r\nIn addition to the above, the results are also borked using a different sequence of operations, even without a blank line being involved. Follow these steps to reproduce (also with Conf 4.0.5 and FF 8.0.1 on OS X):\r\n\r\n- Create a new page.\r\n- Type \"Foo bar. This is a test.\"\r\n- Press enter\r\n- Type \"This is more stuff.\"\r\n- Click \"Heading 3\" in the style dropdown\r\n- Use the pointer to place the cursor immediately before the word \"This\" on the first line.\r\n- Press enter to move the text \"This is a test.\" down to the next line.\r\n- Press <shift-down> to highlight the entire line \"This is a test.\"\r\n- Press <delete> to delete the line \"This is a test.\"\r\n- Note that the Heading 3 style applied to the \"This is more stuff.\" line has disappeared.\r\n",

In these scenarios, cut and paste produces bizarre and nearly-impossible-to-fix results. We have a lot of content inside section macros, and editing is really painful.\r\n\r\nAs an example, install v1.7.0 of the Adaptavist Content Formatting macros. (Yes, they're marked as compatible with Conf 3.5.x, but the rendering of the macros in the plugin works fine--it's the editor that is broken! It also breaks using, for example, the {info} macro.)\r\n\r\nIn the editor, create a new page and then\r\n\r\n- type \"{section\"\r\n- click the \"Section\" macro\r\n- type \"{column\"\r\n- click the \"Column\" macro\r\n- type \"This is a test.\"\r\n\r\nAt this point, the screen should look as shown in step1.png.\r\n\r\n- use your mouse to select the recently-entered text \"is\"\r\n- press command-X to cut\r\n- press command-V to paste\r\n\r\nThe system then duplicates the entire set of section and column macros, as shown in step2.png.\r\n\r\nThe end result is that it's practically impossible to move any content around inside a block macro. The only workaround I've found is to cut the text out of Confluence, paste it into an external app (like TextEdit), and then hit command-C in the external app (which seems to remove any embedded markup) and then paste it back into the editor...it works, but it's a big time sink.\r\n\r\nTested using Safari 5.1.2 on OS X 10.7.2.",
