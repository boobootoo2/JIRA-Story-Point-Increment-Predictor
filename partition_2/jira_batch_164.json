Issue Summary\r\nUsers can make mistakes and might have filled an incorrect value for the Story Points, only perceived later on, when the velocity of the team was affected. \r\nFixing the story points will fix the Velocity however the Burndown Report for the affected Sprint will lose the history. \r\n \r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n1. Create a sprint \"mySprint2\", assign some estimated issues (total of 8 points), and activate the sprint;\r\n2. Create a new issue adding the story points= 229679 and assigning it to the Sprint \"mySprint2\", causing a scope change\r\n3. Mark the issue as Done;\r\n4. Complete the sprint, moving the incomplete issues to a new sprint;\r\n5. Observe the history of the sprint:\r\n - The scope change when the issue with 229679 was added, \r\n - The remaining estimated points for the sprint changing from 8 to 229687 points;\r\n - The moment when the issue was marked as done;\r\n - The new remaining estimated points back to 8;\r\n - The moment when the sprint was marked as complete, showing all done issues with estimated points 0 and the final remaining points\r\n\r\n6. After a while, someone observed the error at the story points and how it was affecting the Team Velocity, so the value was changed from 229679 to 2;\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n- Burndown reporting the story points change from 229679 to 2 and the sprint size adjusted\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n- The scope change when the issue was added is not more 229679, it is showing 0.\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n Currently there is no known workaround for this behavior. A workaround will be added here when available",

Issue Summary\r\n\r\nUsers can make mistakes and might have filled an incorrect value for the Story Points, only perceived later on, when the velocity of the team was affected. \r\n Fixing the story points will fix the Velocity however the Burndown Report for the affected Sprint will lose the history.\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Create a sprint \"mySprint2\", assign some estimated issues (total of 8 points), and activate the sprint;\r\n 2. Create a new issue adding the story points= 229679 and assigning it to the Sprint \"mySprint2\", causing a scope change\r\n 3. Mark the issue as Done;\r\n 4. Complete the sprint, moving the incomplete issues to a new sprint;\r\n 5. Observe the history of the sprint:\r\n - The scope change when the issue with 229679 was added,\r\n - The remaining estimated points for the sprint changing from 8 to 229687 points;\r\n - The moment when the issue was marked as done;\r\n - The new remaining estimated points back to 8;\r\n - The moment when the sprint was marked as complete, showing all done issues with estimated points 0 and the final remaining points\r\n !Screen Shot 2021-05-20 at 12.07.49.png|width=695,height=318!\r\n\r\n6. After a while, someone observed the error at the story points and how it was affecting the Team Velocity, so the value was changed from 229679 to 2;\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n - Burndown reporting the story points change from 229679 to 2 and the sprint size adjusted.\u00a0\r\n !SUGGESTED_OUTPUT.png|width=695,height=318!\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n - The scope change when the issue was added is not more showing 229679, it is showing 0. We can not know that this sprint was modified AFTER it was closed and that the story points of the issue changed from 229679 to 2.\u00a0\r\n !Screen Shot 2021-05-20 at 12.14.02.png|width=695,height=318!\r\n\r\nh3.

Issue Summary\r\n\r\nWhen a Custom Field is set to be the board's Estimation Statistic, it is no longer available to be added to the Issue Detail View\r\n\r\nThis was probably an intentional decision, since a SCRUM board displays the content of the Estimation Custom Field at the top as *Estimate*, however, it is actually possible for a KANBAN board to have estimation set (should not be possible), and this results in the field not being displayed.\r\n\r\nIn any case, a customer may wish to have the custom field used for estimation displayed\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Create a SCRUM board and a test issue\r\n # Create a numeric custom field, assign to project, and give the test issue a value\r\n # Configure the board, visit *Estimation*, and use the custom field as the estimation statistic\r\n # Refresh the configure board page\r\n # Click *Issue Detail View*\r\n\r\nh3.

Problem Definition\r\n\r\nUntil [JSWSERVER-20910|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSWSERVER-20910] is introduced, our customers could use a healthcheck warning thrown when there are more than one Rank field in the instance. \r\n\r\nThird-party tools can import multiple Rank fields which can have havoc over indexing performance. Introduction of a new rank field might go unnoticed by administrators as this is not a visible field on the issue view. So administrators might not be aware of this newly introduced Rank field until it's _too late_. \r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nA Jira healthcheck warning can proactively let the admins know that they have multiple Rank fields and this can potentially impact indexing performance.\r\nA \"Fix\" button should check if the non-default Rank field(s) is/are being used in any of the filters and if not delete the Rank field. \r\n\r\nh3.

Issue Summary\r\n- Different nodes in JDC is reporting different numbers of licensed users\r\n- There's no recognizable pattern to this behaviour in terms of nodes.\r\n- Generally, one or two nodes will report a number close to the DB query:\r\n{code:java}\r\nSELECT COUNT(DISTINCT u.lower_user_name)\r\nFROM   cwd_user u\r\n       JOIN cwd_membership m\r\n         ON u.id = m.child_id\r\n            AND u.directory_id = m.directory_id\r\n       JOIN licenserolesgroup lrg\r\n         ON Lower(m.parent_name) = Lower(lrg.group_id)\r\n       JOIN cwd_directory d\r\n         ON m.directory_id = d.id\r\nWHERE  d.active = '1'\r\n       AND u.active = '1'\r\n    AND license_role_name = 'jira-software';\r\n{code}\r\nwhile rest of the nodes will be reporting vastly different number.\r\n\r\nh3.

However, there is no place to refer back to the closed/done Epic (and issues under this epic).\r\n\r\nh5. Suggested Solution\r\nIt would be great to have Epic related report in Kanban board, just like what we have in Scrum board.\r\n\r\nh5.

Issue Summary\r\n\r\nAn XML backup contains a list of issues (ID, key), issue link types, issue links (issuelinktype id, and issue id), and {{entity_property}} rows.\r\n\r\nJira issue links are stored in the {{issuelink}} table and link two issues via their issue ID.\r\n\r\nPortfolio/Advanced Roadmaps for Jira provides a \"parent link\" issuelinktype which is sometimes uses to link issues. However, primarily it uses a json key {{parent_id}} in the issue's {{entity_property}}\r\n\r\nBoth the entity property {{parent_id}}, and the\u00a0{{issuelink}} (ARJ and non-ARJ) are stored as issue ID's, not keys.\r\n\r\nWhen the XML Project Import runs, it resolves the old issue ID's to the newly created issue ID's, because it has knowledge of the issue key within the backup XML, which results in links based on Jira Issue Link system being resolved, and therefore showing as expected once the project is imported.\u00a0\r\n\r\nIt does not however consider ARJ's {{entity_property}} {{parent_id}} in it's import process, which results in the \"parent link\" field not being migrated correctly with the project.\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Create a test software project\r\n # Create a test issue of type Epic\r\n # Create a test issue of type Bug\r\n # Under Hierarchy Configuration in Advanced Roadmaps for Jira (ARJ), add the \"Bug\" issue type as the top level in the hierarchy\r\n # Make a new Plan in ARJ\r\n # Move the Epic issue \"under\" the Bug issue, then commit changes. You should see the change reported is adding the parent link\r\n # Perform a XML Backup\r\n # Delete the test project\r\n # Using Project Import, choose the XML backup file\r\n # Select the TEST project\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n # When viewing the ARJ plan, the Epic issue is listed below/under (aka linked) the BUG issue type\r\n # When viewing the issues in Jira Issue Navigator, the \"Parent Link\" field of the Epic issue is populated with the Bug issue. (as expected)\r\n # When you check the database, you find that the {{parent_id}} field was has been changed to the newly imported Bug issue ID\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n # When viewing the ARJ plan, the Epic issue is NOT listed below/under the BUG issue type (AKA, the link is lost)\r\n # When viewing the issues in Jira Issue Navigator, the \"Parent Link\" field is not populated. It is blank. \r\n # When you check the database, you find that the {{parent_id}} field was not mapped to the newly imported Bug issue ID, instead, it's listed as the id of the issue before it was deleted\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n * Export the desired issues to CSV beforehand\r\n * After the project import is completed, import the \"Parent Link\" custom field to resolve the links correctly",

Issue Summary\r\n\r\nWhen story points are assigned to new stories at the story creation screen, this does not generate an audit history item capturing the story point assignments.

Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Create a story A and assign its story points (say, 10) at the issue creation screen. Note that the history won't reflect the story point assignment action.\r\n# Create a story B, save it, and then assign its story points (say, 5) as a separate action.

The burndown chart will reflect this (18 -> 15).\r\n# Complete the sprint, and story A and story B to a new sprint.\r\n# Start the new sprint.

Everything looks good.\r\n# Now in the new sprint, change the story points for Story A to \"12\"\r\n# Next, change the story point for story B to \"6\".\r\n# Open up Sprint Report for the original sprint again. It will now show that story A has no points, and story B has 5 points. The total burndown numbers have changed (8 -> 5), e.g. 10 points from story A are now gone.\r\n\r\nh3.

Steps to Reproduce\r\n1) Create Portfolio Teams (say Team A , Team B, Team C)\r\n\r\n2) Create a project with 3 issues (let's say issue type = Tasks) and select one Team while creating the Tasks from the Team custom field.\r\n\r\n3) Now create sub-tasks under each of those issues This should ideally inherit the Team field's value to the sub tasks as well.\r\n\r\n4) Now create an issue Filter something like below\r\nproject = \"<project name>\" AND issuetype = Sub-task . Name this filter as \"2D Filter\"\r\n\r\nYou should be able to see three issues. \r\n\r\n5) Now create a Two Dimensional Issue filter gadget in your dashboard and have the configuration similar to this\r\nSaved filter = 2D Filter\r\nX-Axis = Any Custom/System Field of your choice (Let's say, Reporter)\r\nY-Axis = Team\r\nSort Direction and Number of Results can be left as Default\r\nSave the settings. \r\n\r\nWe notice that the sub-tasks issues are counted under the \"None\" section. Even though we have values under them. \r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nThe gadget shows the right number of issues under their respective Teams.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nWe notice that the sub-tasks issues are counted under the \"None\" section. Even though we have values under them. \r\n\r\nI am attaching the screenshots for reference\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\n Currently, there is no known workaround for this behavior. A workaround will be added here when available",

Issue Summary\r\n\r\nMissing advance conditional triggers related to Bitbucket branch creation, branch merging , etc when using Automation for Jira.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe use case for us and I think everyone using triggers is that developers want thing to happen automatically based on code commits, branch creation, branch merging, and all other types of bitbucket activity when issue keys are linked to committed code to avoid unnecessary overhead of having to go into Jira and remember to make changes there as well. I am under the impression this is the only reason that triggers exist in the first place so it's not like this is a unique thing on our end.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the only thing \"missing\" here in terms of feature request for triggers is that they are not flexible and cannot be conditioned in any way, which makes them essentially useless for any more complex scenarios requiring nuance such as our desired behavior below to only trigger IF meeting condition X. If a4j could incorporate all of these native triggers but allow for that nuance, that would be VERY valuable.\r\n\r\n[!_thumb_5719363.png|thumbnail!|https://getsupport.atlassian.com/secure/attachment/5719363/5719363_image.png]\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\nh2. Possible Workaround\u00a0\r\n # Create an A4J rule with an \u201cIssue Transitioned\u201d and selecting the specific transition;\r\n # On that rule verify if we have the custom field as expected;\r\n # If the custom field is not set as we\u2019ve expected, we can transition it back to the initial status.\r\n\r\n\u00a0",
