      "description": "It seems that when using Crucible with Perforce (I can't speak to other source control systems) that a review can only involve one revision of any given file.  \r\n\r\nIn some cases, a functional change to the code base is made with multiple changelists prior to creating the review.\u2014I want to create one review to review the cumulative effect of a set of related changelists.  Some files might appear on multiple changelists.  \r\n\r\nSo I might update foo.c to revision #10 under changelist 500, and later update it to revision #11 under changelist 600.  I'd like select both changelists and have the review show the difference between revision #9 and #11.   As it is today, I can only get one revision or the other, but not both represented in the difference.  \r\n\r\nI can understand that if another unrelated change is submitted in between my set of two (or more) changelists, that you can't easily generate a valid diff.   In that case, I'd like to see the file listed on the file listed multiple times, once for each consecutive run of revisions.  \r\n\r\nSo for example:  \r\n\r\nI submit changelist 500: \r\nFoo.c# 2\r\nFoo.h#7\r\n\r\nOthers submit totally unrelated changelists 501-519\r\n\r\nI submit changelist 520: \r\n      Foo.c#3\r\n       Bar.c#9\r\n\r\nJoe submits changelist 530 for an entirely unrelated functional change\r\n            Foo.c#4 \r\n\r\nI submit changelist 540: \r\n            Foo.c#5\r\n            Bar.c#10  \r\n\r\nI select changelists 500, 520, 540 for a Crucible review.  It should list the following files and differences:  \r\n            Foo.h (diffed from #6 to #7)\r\n            Foo.c (diffed from #1 to #3)\r\n            Foo.c (diffed from #4 to #5)   Note this file appears twice on the list.\r\n            Bar.c (diffed from #8 to #10)\r\n \r\nThe above process would extrapolate such that a diff might contain a run of several consecutive revisions, and also extrapolate to where a file occurs N times due to N distinct consecutive runs of revisions found on the changelist.\r\n\r\nThis could be enhanced  in stages, where the first stage still only allows each file to be on the review once, but does allow consecutive file revisions (special casing consecutive changelists is mostly useless for us since it rarely occurs in practice that two consecutive changelists are for the same work item.)\r\n\r\nWithout this, we must always submit an entire change in one changelist (not always feasible)   Or expect reviewers to review part of a change in one review and the rest of the change in an other review.\r\n",

When the same file is modified more than once across changesets, Crucible only allows review of the latest revision.

Say the developer checks in revision 1.4, then 1.5, then 1.6 of a particular file. At this point he feels that his code is ready for review. When I tick all 3+ change sets, I want the diff between 1.3 and 1.6 for this file to be added to the code review. Presently, only the diff from 1.5 to 1.6 is added.\r\n\r\nI have been able to navigate to the 'review' tab and successfully 'change diff', but this is time-consuming and error prone.  In the simple case, where the revisions are consecutive (like the case I specified above), Crucible should do this for me when I select the changesets.",

Every single comment made gets emailed out to every single engineer. This overwhelms the inbox pretty quickly. They do want to know that comments have been made so they can review and participate in a discussion, but the immediate email that goes out on any comment is really noisy. Same thing for a moderator for a review with 10 people knowing about every action each of them does.\r\n\r\nMy feature request is to have a digest option that rolls up summaries of each of the changes made and puts it out in a single email. I'd recommend using an interface similar to Jira's \"Filter Subscription\" screen to choose the frequency etc. Although I'd extend it to permit more frequent than daily updates (perhaps hourly etc).\r\n",

This would make sense since Crucible currently doesn't appear to accept replies through email and add them as a reply-comment (would be a neat feature though).    Or the other option would be to add a Reply-To header to the original email, and set it to 'sourcecode@mydomain.com' so that if someone clicks Reply, you will see in the To: field that its not going to the author of the comment, but rather back to the Crucible server (and so you should change it t go to the person you want, presumably the author of the original comment).",

Consider the following: a review is created, comments are made, the code is changed based on comments.   How should the new code be added to the review process to show that the comments have been addressed?  I know there is a feature request around this, but I am sure Atlassian must have some recommendations in the meantime.\r\n\r\n2. Recommendations for ensuring that comments in reviews are addressed.  Maybe a way to see if every comment marked as a defect has at least one reply.  I realize that is not fool proof but it would at least give some warnings on things that might not have been addressed.  I know this is not trivial, but does Atlassian have any suggestions.  \r\n\r\n3. Is there an easy way to determine whether reviewers are doing their job, e.g. if someone has been assigned 10 reviews but only did three of them, is there a way to find this out short of looking at each review.  \r\n\r\n4. Probably not a good idea to store the cache on NAS/NFS storage.  It made things very slow for us.\r\n\r\nThis is all I can think of off the top of my head.

The notifications were a bit confusing because they don't differentiate between a comment being added and a comment being edited. That said I'd really care about receiving notifications for edited comments. Confluence doesn't send notifications for comment edits and I've never taken issue to that because generally people don't significantly go and alter a comment to change its original meaning once they've made it. Differentiating between comments being added and edited would satisfy me - that should be enough for me to create an email filter that allows me to trash edited comment notifications if they don't help me.\n\nI've also attached the resulting RSS feed from my three actions. It displays three separate entries, all with the latest state of the comment. I'd expect a single item to appear in the RSS feed per comment (and obviously for the state of the item to reflect the latest version of the comment).",

      "description": "There's been a few times when we want to review code that's been commited over a span of a few days, but review it as a single review.  The process of doing this is kind of difficult right now.  In order for the review to be set up correctly, you need to click the oldest review (date-wise), then the last-oldest, then the last-last-oldest, etc...  After you finally choose the newest, the review should be setup right.  (Still, though, you have to look over the inidividual files diff ranges and make sure it's right, because it's very easy for something to go wrong.)  Additionally, if someone else commited changes in a file between your changes, the other person's change will show up in the review.  It would be much clearer if the review somehow distinguished who changed what, so that you could see what is in the review because you checked it and what is in there because it happened to be added to the file between your changes.\r\n\r\nSo, in summary, the problems are:\r\n - Setting up a review from multiple commits requires a lot of patience and time, and is easy to do wrong.\r\n - Other people's changes are included in the review.\r\n\r\nSpecific areas for improvement are:\r\n - Make setting up a multi-commit review easier.  (Provide a time-span, or start/stop date, possibly letting you exclude commits.)\r\n - Distinguish who changed what in a multi-commit review, so you can see the change but know it's not something you should be reviewing.\r\n\r\n",

So the code would have to say something like:\r\n          o Look for my help-links file locally.\r\n          o If not found, look for my help-links file on Atlassian servers.\r\n          o Having found my help-links file, look to see if there is a help link for my field (e.g. by field ID).\r\n          o If no help link found, do not display help icon.\r\n          o If help link found, collect the corresponding URL and display the help icon.\r\n\r\nThis way, we can dynamically add the help links as we build the documentation pages. And we can also allow our customers to supply their own help-links file e.g. if they have downloaded our docs and installed the docs on their own Confluence server (e.g. within a firewall).\r\n\r\nNOTE: At each major product release (1.1, 1.2, etc), the doc space on CAC is archived.
