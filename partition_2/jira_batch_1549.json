They tell us to flush the session and commit the transaction regularly. But Atlassian doesn't provide any way to do that, unless I'm mistaken. \r\n\r\nTo reproduce the test, use the code in the 1st answer of the CDAC post.\r\n\r\nOur product is not impacted yet because we've never had to perform a large upgrade task, but we need to be ready for the next time we need to update our data.\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nProvide a way to create isolated/REQUIRES_NEW transactions\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nWith the current proposed solution (which itself uses the non-recommended API ComponentManager.getInstance()): \"IllegalStateException: Transaction already active\"\r\n\r\nh3.

Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Download sample app: [^conf-transformer-test.zip]\r\n # Run \"atlas-clean && atlas-run -v 6.12.0 --data-version 6.12.0\" in conf-transformer-test folder\r\n # In Demonstration space:\r\n # Go to Space tools -> Content tools -> Export\r\n # Select PDF\r\n # Select type (I've tried both Normal and Custom)\r\n # Notice \"Found 1 pages\" in log and debugger for each page in PDF\r\n # Create DEV space with 4 pages (3 siblings and 1 child page)\r\n # Follow the same steps as for DS and get the same result\r\n\r\nh3.

Notes\r\n * API returns expected number of pages when command is {{atlas-clean && atlas-debug -version 6.11.0}} or {{6.12.0}}\r\n * From server ecosystem team: \"--data-version should match --version unless one might want to test for an upgrade path from an older database version. In some cases not setting --data-version and setting --version  can have undesired results because it may try and set --data-version to latest and that could be a cloud version though it's unlikely\"\r\n\r\nh3. Impact\r\n * From vendor:\r\n{quote}My add-ons provide special behavior when multiple pages are exported in one PDF. Unfortunately this is no longer possible in Confluence 6.13 because of ConversionContext.getContentTree now only returns the current page, not the list of all pages included in the PDF. There doesn't appear to be any other way to get this information.\r\n\r\nThis change means that my users will lose a useful feature.\r\n{quote}\r\n * Vendor has *_1.5k_* customer installs potentially affected by this\r\n * This has not been tested on prod instance\r\n\r\nh3.

      "description": "h2. Issue Summary\r\nConfluence provides one with the ability of checking who are the administrators of a given Space by going to Space Tools -> Overview and checking the names right next to the line that says *Administrators*. If this given Space has too many Administrators, the list may be collapsed and an ellipsis button may appear at the end of the line for one to expand and see the full list. Confluence can hit 100% of CPU usage {color:red}and may go down{color} depending on the size of the full list.\r\n\r\nh2. Steps to Reproduce\r\nThis can be easily reproduced by adding a group with multiple users as Space Admin. It is unknown how many users would be necessary to trigger this behaviour, however, it has been observed that an instance with 14.000 users within a group ran into this problem when this group was added as Space Admin.\r\n# Ensure that you have a group with a few thousand users at least on it.\r\n# As an administrator, click on the Cog Icon in your right upper corner and then click on General Configuration.\r\n# Look for Space Permissions.\r\n# Select a space and click on Manage Permissions.\r\n# A list of groups and users will appear. Click on Edit Permissions nearby the group list.\r\n# Look for the group with multiple users and check the Admin checkbox under the Space column.\r\n# Save the changes.\r\n# Now, go to that Space, click on Space Tools and then click on Overview.\r\n# Click on the Ellipsis button right next to the Administrators line.\r\n# At this point, CPU usage will increase and the application may get stuck forever running the following endpoint:\r\n{code}\r\n/spaces/viewspacesummary.action?key=SPAC&showAllAdmins=true\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nh2. Expected Results\r\nInstead of crashing, the application should either display a list of Administrator or a message saying that the list is too long to be rendered.\r\n\r\nh2. Actual Results\r\nCPU goes wild, the list is never rendered and the application most than likely needs to be restarted to get functional once again.\r\n\r\nh2. Notes\r\nIdeally, the application should avoid rendering huge lists or there should have been a pagination mechanism to avoid this problem from happening.\r\n\r\nh2. Workaround\r\nAvoid using groups as Space Administrators unless these groups have a small list of users within them.\r\n\r\nh2. Extra - Technical Notes - AKA What Happens in the Backend\r\nFirst, Confluence will grab a list of everyone that has Administrator Permissions for that space - This include user IDs and group IDs:\r\n{code:sql}\r\nselect permission0_.SPACEID as SPACEID2_52_0_, permission0_.PERMID as PERMID1_52_0_, permission0_.PERMID \r\nas PERMID1_52_1_, permission0_.SPACEID as SPACEID2_52_1_, permission0_.PERMTYPE as PERMTYPE3_52_1_, permission0_.PERMGROUPNAME \r\nas PERMGROU4_52_1_, permission0_.PERMUSERNAME as PERMUSER5_52_1_, permission0_.PERMALLUSERSSUBJECT as PERMALLU6_52_1_, permission0_.CREATOR \r\nas CREATOR7_52_1_, permission0_.CREATIONDATE as CREATION8_52_1_, permission0_.LASTMODIFIER as LASTMODI9_52_1_, permission0_.LASTMODDATE \r\nas LASTMOD10_52_1_ from SPACEPERMISSIONS permission0_ where permission0_.SPACEID='SPACE_ID_HERE';\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nOnce that's done, the user IDs and group IDs will be used to create a list with actual names so one knows who the administrators really are:\r\n{code:sql}\r\nselect internalus1_.user_name as col_0_0_ from cwd_membership hibernatem0_ cross join cwd_user internalus1_ cross join cwd_group internalgr2_ \r\nwhere hibernatem0_.child_user_id=internalus1_.id and hibernatem0_.parent_id=internalgr2_.id and (hibernatem0_.child_group_id is null) \r\nand internalgr2_.lower_group_name='GROUPS_AND_USERS_FROM_STEP_1' and internalgr2_.directory_id='DIRECTORY_ID_FROM_STEP_1' order by internalus1_.lower_user_name;\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nWith the results of the second query, the list is rendered. However, if the second query returns multiple results, such as thousands of users, Confluence will attempt to render a list with all of these names, which crashes the application.",

Thus, building out tables in a few clicks by enriching the native confluence table using powerful operations and functions in the page editor experience is the main use case we addressed thanks to Smart tables. \r\nAs opposed to the other app's design and data scheme, we decided to lay the emphasis on a \"Confluence page editor\" experience avoiding the use of macros, or importing an excel sheet in Confluence bringing therefore to the end-user the closest experience to the native confluence comfort level they are used to and more importantly an outstanding User experience by reducing the number of possible clicks to achieve their goal. \r\nSmart tables has today more that 700 active instances on server in less of two years from the product launch and our customers shared the same feedbacks: \"ease of use\" , \"user friendliness\"....\r\n\r\n[check here|[https://marketplace-cdn.atlassian.com/files/images/aaa9eafa-3d02-4b8d-af27-96c8c580664c.png]]\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n*New confluence editing experience:*\r\nAs a Marketplace vendor and fans of Atlassian toolset we totally support the company's growth shift to cloud-based services and products and are working towards this common objective.\r\n\r\nThe new editor of confluence pages, currently available in the Atlassian cloud relies on a React implementation of ProseMirror (the @atlaskit/editor). This new implementation does not allow us to interact with the editor instance in order for example to modify the content of cell when is formula is set.\r\nThat is a probably is a React / Component pattern which forces the state of the Editor component to be managed by the internal renderer. That is why, we would hope that you guys expose an Access point / bridge allowing extensions to be made on the new editor.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are available to go through the technical details together maybe through a conference or any other format that is convenient for you. \r\nWe are looking forward to working together in order to support our customers with the new editor experience in the Atlassian cloud.\r\n\r\nCheers,",

Issue Summary\r\nMembers of the {{confluence-administrators}} group are treated as a _special user_ in Confluence as described in [Global Permissions Overview|https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/global-permissions-overview-138709.html#GlobalPermissionsOverview-Comparingtheconfluence-administratorsgroupwiththeadministratorpermissions].\r\nThis documentation states that members of that group would still consider the [Space Permissions|https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/space-permissions-overview-139521.html] and [Page Restrictions|https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/page-restrictions-139414.html] when editing a page. However, there's no reference whatsoever to creating a new page, which uses the same permission on the Space level.\r\nThe problem is that even when the _Add pages_ space permission is revoked from all groups and users within a Space, members of the {{confluence-administrators}} can still create a page in that Space, while editing an existing page isn't possible.\r\nIt would be expected that consistency occurs among the same space permission, preventing members of the {{confluence-administrators}} from creating pages in the above situation.\r\n\r\nh3. Environment\r\n* This was validated on Confluence Server 6.13.4 and 6.15.4.\r\n* It is expected this bug affects any version prior to, and including, 6.15.X.\r\n* This also affects Confluence Data Center deployments.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Install a vanilla instance of Confluence.\r\n# Create a sample Space.\r\n# Logged with an user part of the {{confluence-administrators}} group, edit the permissions of this Space.\r\n #* Make sure only the {{confluence-users}} group has permissions assigned, removing any other group and users.\r\n #* Make sure only the _View_ and the _Space Admin_ permissions are assigned to the {{confluence-users}} group.\r\n# Go back to the Home Page of the target space and note that the _Edit_ button in that page is gone.\r\n# Click on the _Create blank page_ button.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nConfluence doesn't allow a page to be created in the current Space, since the _Add Page_ Space permission was revoked from all groups and users in that Space.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nConfluence still allows users of the {{confluence-administrators}} group to create a page.\r\n\r\nh3. Notes\r\nIf trying to create a page using a template other than the blank page, for example the _How-to article_ template, the admin is able to navigate through the template form, but creating the page fails with a _Not Permitted_ error page as the image below.\r\n !create-from-template-img001.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n_Currently there is no known workaround for this behavior. A workaround will be added here when available._",

Workaround\r\nYou can opt for a manual upgrade process where you will need to download the installation archive file (.zip/.tar.gz) and follow the steps as described in [Upgrading Confluence Manually|https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/upgrading-confluence-manually-255363437.html] to attempt an upgrade without having to run any of the ownership change commands \"Assuming that they are correct\".",

Issue Summary\r\n\r\nIssue raised in DEVHELP:\r\n\r\n{quote}\r\nDear Confluence Product Team,\r\n\r\nOn behalf of the TechUp team I am reaching out to you asking for a collaboration request with your team around one of our Confluence apps Smart Tables currently on the Marketplace. \r\nWe believe that by building flawless and user-friendly experiences, we provide our customers the means to increase their teams' efficiency and engagement towards the Atlassian tools.\r\nWhy Smart tables? \r\nConfluence users are eager to leverage native Confluence page editor's capabilities in order to perform their day to day tasks. Thus, building out tables in a few clicks by enriching the native confluence table using powerful operations and functions in the page editor experience is the main use case we addressed thanks to Smart tables. As opposed to the other app's design and data scheme, we decided to lay the emphasis on a \"Confluence page editor\" experience avoiding the use of macros, or importing an excel sheet in Confluence bringing therefore to the end-user the closest experience to the native confluence comfort level they are used to and more importantly an outstanding USer experience by reducing the number of possible clicks to achieve their goal. Smart tables has today more that 700 active instances in less of two years from the product launch and our customers shared the same feedbacks: \"ease of use\" , \"user friendliness\"....\r\nNew confluence editing experience: \r\nWith the new confluence editing experince, we are have working hard in order to make our product compatible with new table editor api.\r\nHowever for technical reasons, its appears that the new editor is locked by Atlassian and it is impossible for us based on the current api to make smart tables compatible unless we go through macros.\r\nWe still believe in the added value of our product outside the scope of macros and for that reason we reach out to you guys to find out if there a way of collaboration together.\r\nOur vision for the current version of smart tables was to extend the current editor through the \"formulas button\" (please check attached)\r\n\r\nOur suggestion for you guys is that we can work together on a technical solution that we will make the new confluence editor extendable, we are convinced that we will bring new horizons of possiblies and not just only for calculation.\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nh3.

Suggestion Summary\r\n - Customer company A is bought by company B.\r\n - Both have Confluence, Directories are not integrated\r\n - Sysadmins on company B create users for employees from company A, but they do not always match the ones they had in A (such as, A is johnsmith, B is jsmith)\r\n - Customer would rather have pages assigned correctly, than listing _unknown user johnsmith_\r\n\r\nh4. Proposed Solution\r\n\r\nImport operation could allow admins to input a from-to CSV file indicating old user names and new ones, to prevent that issue.\r\nh4. Possible Workarounds\r\n - Have the space imported in a non-production instance and run the procedures from:\r\n [How To - Transfer Content Ownership in between Users|https://confluence.atlassian.com/confkb/how-to-transfer-content-ownership-in-between-users-958450595.html]\r\n - Try find-and-replace operations on the XML file such as\r\n\r\n{code:java|title=Replace Name}\r\nsed -i.tmp 's@<property name=\"name\"><!\\[CDATA\\[oldusername\\]\\]></property>@<property name=\"name\"><!\\[CDATA\\[newusername\\]\\]></property>@g' entities.xml\r\n{code}\r\n{code:java|title=Replace Lower Name}\r\nsed -i.tmp 's@<property name=\"lowerName\"><!\\[CDATA\\[oldusername\\]\\]></property>@<property name=\"lowerName\"><!\\[CDATA\\[newusername\\]\\]></property>@g' entities.xml\r\n{code}\r\nAgain, we must be mindful about the space name. I don't think you gonna have spaces with usernames on it, but, just in case, be mindful about that. If that happens, after you have SED'ed your way, open the entities.xml file and look for the tag below:\r\n{code:java}\r\n <object class=\"Space\" package=\"com.atlassian.confluence.spaces\">\r\n <id name=\"id\">3440641</id>\r\n <property name=\"name\"><![CDATA[OldUserName]]></property>\r\n <property name=\"key\"><![CDATA[MAR]]></property>\r\n <property name=\"lowerKey\"><![CDATA[mar]]></property>\r\n{code}\r\nOnce you found it, just replace the name accordingly to respect the previous space name and save the file. Then follow the steps previously outlined here and we should be fine.\r\n",

This creates a new bullet point below.\r\n 2. Press backspace (this deletes the bullet point)\r\n 3. Press the space bar twice.\r\n 4. Click 'publish' or 'preview'. The single line of white space is preserved.\r\n\r\n+Workaround #2+:\r\n 1. Insert a 'section' macro underneath the table.

The documentation above does not specify any limitation on who can create this space in Confluence. However, it seems that only users with *Create Issue* permission in JIRA are the only users that can create such spaces.

Problem Definition\r\nWhen migrating Confluence Spaces from one instance to another, users may still access pages in the legacy instance without knowing the content was migrated and a more recent version is available.\r\nUsers may be directed to the legacy instance because of bookmarks or links available in external systems (not Confluence).\r\nIt would be interesting if we could adjust a rewrite rule directly in Confluence configuration to send users to the new instance when they are trying to read content from migrated Spaces.\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\nProvide the ability to configure directly in Confluence rewrite rules based on Spaces (Space key, for example) to send users to a new Confluence instance.\r\n \r\nh3.
