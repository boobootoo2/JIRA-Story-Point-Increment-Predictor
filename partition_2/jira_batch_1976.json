So it is difficult for non-Jira users to get more context of the issue.\r\n\r\n*Steps to replicate:-*\r\n\r\n1) Take any instance with Jira and Confluence in it.\r\n2) Create a Confluence page and insert a Jira link in it.\r\n3) Ask two users( one with access to Jira and the other without) to view the same page.\r\n4) The user without Jira access will see only the Jira ticket number in the Jira link.

      "description": "h3. Issue Summary\r\n\r\nTLDR - some contentIds take very long to index. This has resulted in 90% of the content not being searchable for some tenants.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nExplanation:\r\n\r\nWe use ADF extraction code in the indexing flow. When a reindex job runs, 25 contentIds are extracted in a single batch and we extract all fields for them. One of the fields contentBody is populated with ADF extracted content. There is clear indication that this ContentBodyIndexerExtractor takes several seconds in some cases.\r\n\r\nSide effect of this: We have no activity for 5 min ( if the 25 contentIds take longer than 5 min in total) and the job gets timed out - all pending tasks are marked as dead and this is very bad for our customers.\r\n\r\nThis PIR action item is in progress now: https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFCLOUD-71555\r\nbut it is only a bandaid. And the root cause needs to be figured out.\r\n\r\nWe cannot increase the timeout of the job for this because that would not be the right way to fix this. We cannot increase the batch size for reindexing because that would degrade the performance of progress tracking - too many entries in DB.\r\n\r\nPlease take a look at [https://pug.jira-dev.com/wiki/spaces/CCB/pages/7399801505/DoS+ticket+-+investigation#Specific-details]\r\n\r\nThere are some more contentIds as well on the page to reproduce the issue\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nSome staging contentIds:\r\n\r\nSearchable ari:cloud:confluence:bf1ad8f0-f9da-4c3e-ac67-d73f6e394bc4:page/899784974 did not complete extraction in time 12 seconds\r\n\r\nSearchable ari:cloud:confluence:bf1ad8f0-f9da-4c3e-ac67-d73f6e394bc4:page/899817407 did not complete extraction in time 12 seconds\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nMore logs here: [https://splunk.paas-inf.net/en-US/app/search/search?q=search eventtype%3D\"micros_confluence-dev-us*\" \"Searchable* did not complete extraction in time*\"&display.page.search.mode=smart&dispatch.sample_ratio=1&earliest=-4h%40m&latest=now&sid=1614299614.114191_08994721-1899-43E7-8F3A-864FED18C26C|https://splunk.paas-inf.net/en-US/app/search/search?q=search%20eventtype%3D%22micros_confluence-dev-us*%22%20%22Searchable*%20did%20not%20complete%20extraction%20in%20time*%22&display.page.search.mode=smart&dispatch.sample_ratio=1&earliest=-4h%40m&latest=now&sid=1614299614.114191_08994721-1899-43E7-8F3A-864FED18C26C]\r\nh3.
