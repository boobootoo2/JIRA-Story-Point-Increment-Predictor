Suggested Solution\r\nHave JIRA check for when number of issues assigned to a sprint goes from 1+ down to 0, if this happens when removing an issue from a sprint, prompt the user to delete the sprint entirely\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Why this is important\r\nIn the process of planning sprints, sometimes you have to delete a sprint in the planning stages that will never be started.   However right now within JIRA, the only want to do so are either to make a REST call, or to delete the sprint on the origin board where it was created.\r\n\r\nThis can be a problem for environments that heavily rely on the use of the project restoration method in order to move projects between JIRA instances.  Since the project restore does not include the board information, that sprint does not always appear on the newly created board in the destination instance.  But all the issues freshly imported there are still referencing this old sprint value.   If you create a new sprint on the system with the same name, you have just made this process more complicated\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround \r\nGive each sprint a uniquely different name, and use the bulk change feature in JIRA to update all the issues with the previous sprint name to use the new sprint name.",

Workaround\r\n# Stop JIRA.\r\n# Backup your database.\r\n# Delete all indexes from the table {{AO_60DB71_LEXORANK}}, *except for the primary key*.\r\n# Change the data type on the columns {{AO_60DB71_LEXORANK.RANK}} and {{AO_60DB71_LEXORANK.LOCK_HASH}} using these SQL queries:\r\n{code:sql}\r\nALTER TABLE dbo.AO_60DB71_LEXORANK ALTER COLUMN RANK NVARCHAR(255) NOT NULL;\r\nALTER TABLE dbo.AO_60DB71_LEXORANK ALTER COLUMN LOCK_HASH NVARCHAR(255) NULL;\r\n{code}\r\n# Run the following SQL queries to flush caches and update statistics on the database:\r\n{code:sql}\r\nDBCC FREEPROCCACHE;\r\n{code}; or for one database:\r\n{code:sql|borderStyle=solid|borderColor=#6A8EB3|bgColor=#F8F8F8}\r\nDBCC FLUSHPROCINDB (<dbid>)\r\n{code}\r\n---\r\n{code:sql|borderStyle=solid|borderColor=#6A8EB3|bgColor=#F8F8F8}\r\nSP_UPDATESTATS;\r\n{code}; or in the Jira DB:\r\n{code:sql|borderStyle=solid|borderColor=#6A8EB3|bgColor=#F8F8F8}\r\nUPDATE STATISTICS;\r\n{code}\r\n# Start JIRA.

So please process these things into issues (or up-votes for existing issues).\r\n\r\nsuggestion 1:\r\n\r\nWhen I look at the board for my project, I expect that:\r\n-clicking an issue (anywhere in its square) will highlight it so I can get some quick info ---like the view I have in the space at the right. \u00a0And it does.\r\nI also expect that:\r\n-clicking the *title* of the issue (which looks like a link) should take me to that issue (as a page). *But it does not*. \u00a0Clicking the link does the same thing as clicking the area around the link.\r\n\r\nCurrently, if I want to view an issue as a full page, I have to click on the issue so it appears in the tight section at the right, and then click the title there to go to the issue page. \u00a0If I actually click the link (the issue title), I want to link to the page (one-click).\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nsuggestion 2:\r\n\r\nI like to record my notes about issues in the comments as I test them. But JIRA has a pretty short log-out time, and when I get logged out my not-yet-posted message is lost. \u00a0I wish it would preserve my comment drafts when I get logged out.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nsuggestion 3:\r\n\r\nMake it easier to give suggestions. \u00a0I had a thought about what was annoying and how easy it would be to fix it, so I just wanted to send someone a quick note letting them know about it. \u00a0But to do that I went through...\r\nIs there anywhere on this page that allows me contact someone? no.\r\n\r\nSomehow I got here: [https://support.atlassian.com/contact/\r\nW|https://support.atlassian.com/contact/]hat can I help you with? \u00a0--> Product suggestions \u00a0--> Go to product suggestions\r\n(at this point I really thought I was one-click away from a simple text box)\r\nThis takes me to a [page|https://jira.atlassian.com/secure/Dashboard.jspa] that deals with a lot more than just product suggestions.\r\nI see:\r\n * *To create a feature request:* Log in or create an account, then hit *Create* in the header.\"\r\n\r\nBut this page deals with pretty much everything, so I have to pick out which JIRA project is relevant (honestly I don't know if I picked the right one, to me its just \"JIRA\"). If I could submit suggests from within the page I used, you would know which one I used. \u00a0\r\n\r\nOnce I chose \"Suggestion\" I got a message saying\r\n\"Before creating a new Suggestion, please search the existing issues to see if your suggestion already exists.\" \u00a0I'm not sure where to view that. \u00a0I looked under \"issues\", for some variant of JIRA, and searched for key terms. \u00a0There are 5 pages of results, I did not read them all.\r\n\r\nI really expected to just send a quick email that would find its way to someone who is well acquainted the the project, its system of improvement, its categories of features, etc. \u00a0That person could file away the information as a new issue with appropriate tags, or up the priority of an existing issue. \u00a0I did NOT expect that the only way to make a suggestion as a user was to go half-way to becoming that person myself. And at several steps I thought I was just one click away from a simple text box to enter a suggestion. \u00a0\r\n\r\nI would make more suggestions if your suggestion process was a little less intimidating. \u00a0",
