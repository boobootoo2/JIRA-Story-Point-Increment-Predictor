This has previously been reported as [CONF-41010|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONF-41010] *Table index \"c_status_idx\" on CONTENT.content_status cause slow search index rebuilding on Oracle* which was thought to effect only Oracle, but this has now been found in PostgreSQL and MS-SQL Server instances as well.\r\n\r\nh5. Diagnosis\r\nCheck to verify if the *c_status_idx* index exists for the table CONTENT on the Column CONTENT_STATUS\r\n\r\nh4. Explanation\r\nThe basic problem here is that the index C_STATUS_IDX on Column CONTENT_STATUS in Table CONTENT is of very low cardinality as the two values do not represent a lot of unique possibilities to search through. \r\n\r\nIndexes with low cardinality are known to cause a negative impact on performance as a page set of data must be scanned for all values of the value being indexed. As the CONTENT table of the Confluence application holds the majority of rows, each record lookup takes a significant amount of time to isolate the record in question. \r\n\r\nSince the values of CONTENT_STATUS is essentially a Boolean value (current or previous version) the index does not speed up the scan by isolating a unique value. Therefore, indexing requires nearly full table scans for every record in the CONTENT table. \r\n\r\nh4. Workaround\r\nThe only known workaround at present is to DROP the C_STATUS_IDX index which then restores the normal operation of the indexing operations within Confluence to the previous levels of indexing performance in terms of time.",

      "description": "With the freshly-released 5.10.0, programmatic manipulation of plugin states with PluginController (ie. enable/disable plugins, or enable/disable plugin modules) takes 5+ seconds, which causes log warnings and significant issues for other add-ons that manipulate plugin state. For example, if a plugin needs to manipulate the state of four other modules, this takes 20-40 seconds, which in turn can completely prevent that plugin's OSGi bundle from starting up or shutting down within the allotted time.\r\n\r\nThis is a regression from 5.9 and the root cause seems to be the new audit log code. One log symptom is the following:\r\n\r\n{code}\r\n2016-06-07 11:00:34,468 WARN [http-nio-8510-exec-32] [confluence.util.profiling.DurationThresholdWarningTimingHelperFactory] logMessage Execution time for publishing event com.atlassian.confluence.event.events.plugin.PluginModuleEnableEvent(confluence.sections.admin:dailybackup) took 8609 ms (warning threshold is 5000 ms)\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nThe plugin enable/disable itself happens immediately, but the dispatch of the corresponding event after the enable/disable is what takes a long time. (The event is synchronous though, so the calling code still does not get control back until after the event dispatch is complete.)\r\n\r\nI took a few stack traces and it seems that the new Audit Log code in 5.10 (which handles the plugin-related events) is doing some I18n translation to create the audit log messages, and the I18n work causes it to continually open and re-open a whole bunch of JARs for reasons that are unknown to me. (Maybe an I18n cache reset after change in plugin state?)\r\n\r\nI created a very simple plugin which reproduces this behavior when doing repeated plugin module enables/disables of a random module. It runs as a servlet filter, and it invokes itself on the first access to Confluence after installation.\r\n\r\nhttps://bitbucket.org/sdudley/confluence-5.10-plugin-enable-disable-test/src\r\n\r\nHere, you can see that each manipulation takes 5-10 seconds:\r\n\r\n{code}\r\n2016-06-07

Summary\r\nLoading of a page that contains Page Properties Report Macro is considerably slower in the later version of Confluence when having a large number of items to display.\r\nThis is being compared to an earlier version of Confluence, such as the version 5.5.4 where a page that contains Page Properties Report Macro large number of items to display loaded in a matter of seconds.\r\n\r\nh3. Environment\r\n* Confluence 5.9.4\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\nh5. Use the sample Space Export\r\n# Get this XML space export [^Confluence-space-export-225313-4.xml.zip]\r\n# Load the page with the title \"PP Report Macro with Number of items to display = 1000\" from the xml export\r\n\r\nh5. Or, have a huge number of pages that have a \"Page Properties\" Macro\r\n# Create a page and insert the *Page Properties* Macro in it\r\n# Add simple table \r\n !screenshot-1.png|thumbnail! \r\n# Save the page, and add a distinct label to this page, for example \"decisions\"\r\n# Add 1000 additional pages in this space with the same content and label\r\n# Add another page, insert the \"Page Properties Report\" Macro > Edit this macro > and add the label from step 3. Example, \"decisions\".\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nShould load in a matter of seconds\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nPage properties report macro shows \"{{Generating page properties report}}\" while loading its content. After a seemingly long time, the page loaded. After a case review the page fully loads after ~6 minutes. Here is the the comparison between Confluence 5.9.4 and 5.5.4:\r\n\r\n!image-2016-06-07-22-52-09-641.png!\r\n\r\nh3. Notes\r\n# The loading time could differ from one instance to another. The table above represents the difference between the two versions.\r\n# This issue only happens if there are no rich contents in the page report macro, as they will be affected by the following bug instead:\r\n#* [Page Properties Report Macro only displays 30 results|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONF-40898]",

Currently, when a user's session times out out they are redirected to the login page. After logging back in, the URL fragment is not retained so although they are taken back to the right page, they are not taken back to the right place in the document. \r\n\r\nThe redirection URL is stored in a hidden variable in the HTML and is stored without the anchor:\r\n\r\n{code} <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"os_destination\" value=\"/pages/viewpage.action?spaceKey=BS&amp;title=Page+with+Anchor\"/>{code}\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nStore the anchor/URL fragment so that it can be reused in the redirect. \r\n \r\nh3. Workaround \r\n\r\nNone.

Save page. Now I edit the page, while in edit mode, a colleague also edits that page. He saves (macro appears as it should). Now I save (now the macro is broken). The typical flow and correct flow is that if the same section/piece were edited by both people, the second person to save would receive a merge conflict notification. If both people edited different sections then no conflict arrises and it saves fine. \r\n\r\nHowever, in either case, no matter if the same section was edited or different sections were edited, the status macro (that comes with the template) now presents a \"Broken Macro\" error on the page for the second person who saves. When you edit the page, it still has that error; you have to delete it and re-insert the macro. This same behavior occurs with the Column macro inside the section macro. This behavior did not occur with the Section macro itself, but once the Column macro was inside the Section macro, it then produced the same \"Broken Macro\" error. \r\n\r\nThis was tested in Safari and Chrome, producing the same results.\r\n\r\n*Note: the Product Requirements template was only used as an example.

In the macro setting, I've set the width to 100% with the intention that the video scales in height to match the aspect of whatever the 100% width value ends up being in real terms: which is to say, to use the full amount of space available to it in the left-hand section/div.\r\n\r\nThis isn't happening.\r\n\r\nThe height of the video seems to have a max height of 380px (unless I specify otherwise in the macro, which isn't appropriate for what I'm trying to achieve here) leading to that wasted space at the edges - that's space that my video content could be using to show a larger picture. \r\n\r\nThe video element - which curiously is embedded in a virtual #document element, meaning I can't access it to change its styles in the global stylesheet - appears to use the object-fit CSS selector, which defaults to 'contain' based on the default user agent stylesheet. Furthermore, this may or may not have something to do with the line:\r\n\r\n<param name=\"scale\" value=\"aspect\"> element within the object used to display the video. Whatever, that parameter is not available to me to set or change.\r\n\r\nWhat I need is to have the object-fit selector be able to be set to 'fill' by the addition of some extra option, or just have this be the default behaviour of video content in Confluence, to ensure my video content is displayed using the maximum amount of space possible and actually uses a width of 100% of the containing div, not some fraction of 100% based on some arbitrary max height that I didn't set and can't alter.",

Problem Definition\r\nIf you edit a Page, then select and cut/paste a line which contains an inline comment, the comment is marked as Resolved. It would be preferable for the cut line to include the inline comment, so that when pasted, the inline comment is preserved.\r\n\r\nSteps To Reproduce:\r\n\r\n# Add an inline comment on a Page\r\n# Click Edit and then select the line which contains the inline comment and then cut\r\n# Paste the line somewhere and click Update\r\n# Check Resolved Comments and observe that the inline comment contained in the cut line is now marked as Resolved since it was deleted\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\nInstead of resolving the comment, include the comment in the pasted line.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\nEdit the Page using the [Confluence Source Editor|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1210722/confluence-source-editor?hosting=server&tab=overview] App to preserve the inline comments.\r\n\r\nPS: The App is marked as Server only, but it will install and work well on any Data Center instances as well.",

This happens with links to anchors in the same page at least, not sure about links to other pages. \r\n\r\nUsually it helps if I add space in front of the link, between it and the anchor, but not always and I haven't figure out why it doesn't always work (I had one page where it never worked and other where it seemed to work always)\r\n\r\n\r\nWorkaround: first add the anchor to front of a text which should be link, save, then edit again and change the text to link and save. This way the anchor and link is stored. Other option is to add the anchor macro in after the link (for us this is not as good as it being in front)\r\n\r\nIt's annoying the say the least (we have certain documents where this kind of scenario occurs a lot, having anchor in front of a link inside a table cell)\r\n\r\n",

You do not need both restrictions for the icon to change. \r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nLock icon still displays as grey and unlocked. This can be misleading, as there are certain restrictions.

There is no logging at other levels either.\r\n\r\nI suspect this began after implementing the Office Connector [canary process|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/CONFKB/JVM+crashes+during+Import+from+Word+in+Confluence], however it could also have been due to the dependency changes required for plugins4.\r\n\r\nLogging for the canary process and some parts of the Office Connector \u00a0(eg below) go to the catalina.out, but is not formatted in the usual way (eg the timestamp). This is because it uses an SLF4J SimpleLogger, which is by design - it runs in an entirely separate JVM and is stripped down to pure essentials. It appears as though the dependencies\u00a0from this module are bleeding into the main JVM and breaking logging for the whole plugin.\r\n{code:java}\r\n147073 [scheduler_Worker-10] INFO com.atlassian.confluence.extra.officeconnector.index.excel.ExcelXMLTextExtractor - Not enough memory to extract all text from 'test.xlsx'.
