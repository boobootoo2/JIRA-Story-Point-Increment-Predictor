Even though it suggests that it should not be done on a production server, still many customers use this as a reference on production, moreover when migrating to OnDemand. This causes various problems and even if the load of the export succeeds, it may cause problems later on, that is very hard to track back to this particular activity. We should not recommend this at all I believe, even if this was working earlier, it is surely causing problems in the latest versions.\r\n\r\nAs a workaround, we should always advise to create a staging instance with the source instance's version, import the space there, upgrade that instance to the target version, then export the space from the staging instance.",

      "description": "h3.Steps to Reproduce\r\nCreate a space and add 2000+ watchers to it. Enable page profiling and after that, try to create a page or publish a blog post. Notice that the page creation and blog post publish can take a long time (sometimes even 200+ seconds) . In the profiling logs you will see thousands of these:\r\n{code}\r\n[0ms] - Parse: templates/email/html/includes/header.vm\r\n            [0ms] - Parse: templates/email/html/includes/header-styles.vm\r\n            [0ms] - Parse: templates/email/html/includes/header-body-start.vm\r\n            [0ms] - Parse: templates/email/html/includes/title.vm\r\n          [0ms] - Parse: templates/email/html/includes/footer-links.vm\r\n          [0ms] - Parse: templates/email/html/includes/footer.vm\r\n        [14ms] - UserAccessor.getUser()\r\n        [0ms] - UserAccessor.isDeactivated()\r\n        [66ms] - PermissionManager.hasPermissionNoExemptions()\r\n          [31ms] - UserAccessor.hasMembership()\r\n          [24ms] - DefaultSpacePermissionManager.hasPermission(USECONFLUENCE, test@test.com, global)\r\n            [0ms] - UserAccessor.isDeactivated()\r\n            [0ms] - UserAccessor.getGroup()\r\n            [0ms] - UserAccessor.hasMembership()\r\n            [0ms] - UserAccessor.getGroup()\r\n            [1ms] - UserAccessor.hasMembership()\r\n          [0ms] - UserAccessor.hasMembership()\r\n          [11ms] - DefaultSpacePermissionManager.hasPermission(VIEWSPACE, test@test.com, it)\r\n            [1ms] - UserAccessor.getGroup()\r\n            [0ms] - UserAccessor.hasMembership()\r\n            [0ms] - UserAccessor.getGroup()\r\n            [0ms] - UserAccessor.hasMembership()\r\n        [22ms] - UserAccessor.getConfluenceUserPreferences()\r\n        [0ms] - UserAccessor.getPropertySet()\r\n        [0ms] - UserAccessor.getUser()\r\n        [0ms] - UserAccessor.getPropertySet()\r\n        [0ms] - FormatSettingsManager.getDateFormat()\r\n        [0ms] - FormatSettingsManager.getDateTimeFormat()\r\n        [0ms] - FormatSettingsManager.getTimeFormat()\r\n        [0ms] - FormatSettingsManager.getDateFormat()\r\n        [0ms] - FormatSettingsManager.getDateTimeFormat()\r\n        [0ms] - FormatSettingsManager.getEditorBlogPostDate()\r\n        [12ms] - LikeManager.hasLike()\r\n        [12ms] - PermissionManager.hasCreatePermission()\r\n          [0ms] - UserAccessor.hasMembership()\r\n          [0ms] - UserAccessor.hasMembership()\r\n          [11ms] - DefaultSpacePermissionManager.hasPermission(COMMENT, test@test.com, it)\r\n            [0ms] - UserAccessor.getGroup()\r\n            [0ms] - UserAccessor.hasMembership()\r\n            [0ms] - UserAccessor.getGroup()\r\n            [0ms] - UserAccessor.hasMembership()\r\n        [1ms] - Rendering velocity template: /styles/default-inline-css.vm\r\n          [0ms] - Parse: /styles/colors-css.vm\r\n            [0ms] - Parse: /styles/aui-overrides-css.vm\r\n            [0ms] - Parse: /styles/labels-css.vm\r\n            [0ms] - Parse: /styles/diffs-css.vm\r\n        [3ms] - Rendering velocity template: /templates/email/html/page-added-notification.vm\r\n          [0ms] - Parse: templates/email/html/includes/constants.vm\r\n          [0ms] - PermissionManager.hasCreatePermission()\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nSo permission checks for *all notified users* of the page creation or change seems to be the culprit here. Suggest that we perform the permission checks during the mail queue flush, rather than the page creation process. In the example above, the 3 permission checks (USECONFLUENCE, VIEWSPACE and COMMENT) comes up to 24ms + 11ms + 11ms = 46ms for a single user (permission checks only). Multiply that by 2000 users, and you get a 92 second wait to complete the page creation.",

It doesn't even come close to cover it or providing a workaround. \r\n\r\nThe workflow requested here is what you could do in 3.X. \r\n\r\nWorkflow: \r\n1. Edit Page \r\n2. Type: [somelink \r\n3. Select \"Insert link to create page\" \r\n4. Save \r\n5. Click link \r\n6. Here I would like to be able to select a template! \r\n\r\n---- \r\n\r\nSince the link is already treated in a special way linking to e.g.: \r\n\r\n{code} \r\nhttp://wiki/pages/createpage.action?spaceKey=x&title=Link+Here&linkCreation=true&fromPageId=12820509 \r\n{code} \r\n\r\nI think this could be solved very easy by rendering a dropdown with the same to options as you have under \"Add\"... \r\nThe other link being: \r\n{code} \r\nhttp://wiki/pages/createpage-choosetemplate.action?spaceKey=x&newSpaceKey=x&fromPageId=12820509 \r\n{code} \r\n\r\nSo instead of rendering the following: \r\n\r\n{code:language=html} \r\n<a class=\"createlink\" href=\"/pages/createpage.action?spaceKey=x&amp;title=Link+Here&amp;linkCreation=true&amp;fromPageId=12820509\">Link Here</a> \r\n{code} \r\n\r\nyou could maybe render something like: \r\n\r\n{code:language=html} \r\n<div onclick=\"$(this).children('div').toggle()\" \r\n     style=\"display: inline-block; width: auto; position: relative;\"> \r\n    Link Here that is very very very long long long \r\n    <div style=\"position: absolute; background: #ddd; display: none; width: 100%;\"> \r\n        <a style=\"display:block\" \r\n           href=\"/pages/createpage.action?spaceKey=x&title=Link+Here&linkCreation=true&fromPageId=12820509\"> \r\n            Create Blank Page \r\n        </a> \r\n        <a style=\"display:block\" \r\n           href=\"/pages/createpage-choosetemplate.action?spaceKey=x&newSpaceKey=x&title=Link+Here&fromPageId=12820509\"> \r\n            Create from Template \r\n        </a> \r\n    </div> \r\n</div> \r\n{code} \r\n\r\nThe onclick is just an example of how it could be under jQuery, obviously the formatting is ugly here, but it shows that it could properly be done fairly simple... \r\n\r\nThe \"createpage-choosetemplate.action\" with title works. \r\n\r\nOr HELL!!!.... Just render: \r\n\r\n{code:language=html} \r\n<a class=\"createlink\" href=\"/pages/createpage.action?spaceKey=x&amp;title=Link+Here&amp;linkCreation=true&amp;fromPageId=12820509\">Link Here</a> \r\n<a class=\"createlink\" href=\"/pages/createpage-choosetemplate.action?spaceKey=x&amp;title=Link+Here&amp;linkCreation=true&amp;fromPageId=12820509\">[Select Template]</a> \r\n{code} \r\n\r\n---- \r\n\r\nThe important thing is: \r\n * You get to choose the template when you choose to create the page, rather than being dictated by the one inserting a macro. \r\n * The link turns into a real page link after and can no longer be used to create additional new pages",

Problem Definition\r\nEdit in Office permissions are currently set via giving a user Page Add permission. While this made sense when Confluence used the View File macro to embed Office content into a Confluence page - and thus editing the Office document was essentially the same as editing the page - it does not hold true anymore. The new File Preview experience clearly emphasizes the fact that Office documents are attachments, and it can be confusing to set Page Add permissions for operations involving attachments.\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\nChange the permissions scheme used for Edit in Office to check against Attachment Add instead of Page Add.",
