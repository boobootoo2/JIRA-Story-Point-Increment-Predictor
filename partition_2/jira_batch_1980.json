If we consider this behaviour occurring in a production application\u2019s macro, then depending on what your macro does exactly, I believe this could result in anything from an annoying visual bug to potentially a legitimate security concern.\r\n\r\nThe entire macro code is run when this \u2018phantom macro\u2019 is rendered, using the old context, meaning erroneous side effects (sentry calls, analytic collections, Confluence AP Events) are produced. Since AP Events are produced, this severely impacts the usefulness of that feature - it\u2019s difficult or impossible to code around this as your code does not expect these events.\r\nh3.

Issue Summary\r\nIt is possible to create a page using [Atlassian Document Format|https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/apis/document/structure/] (ADF) but the [Confluence Cloud REST API|https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/confluence/rest/intro/] documentation doesn't mention \"editor\" as a content type, nor \"atlas_doc_format\" as a representation. In fact it doesn't seem to define the formats or representations at all, other than by giving a few examples, so is not complete enough for users to work out how to use the API.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Consult the [Create content|https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/confluence/rest/api-group-content/#api-api-content-post] section in the API docs to find out how to create a page.\r\n # Scroll to the *Body Parameters* subsection to find out what to put in the payload.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nThe {{body}} parameter should specify a structure with available formats and representations. It should allow creation of content using any supported format, including ADF.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nThe {{body}} parameter is described only in vague terms:\r\n{quote}\r\nThe body of the new content. Does not apply to attachments. Only one body format should be specified as the property for this object, e.g. storage.\r\n\r\nNote, editor2 format is used by Atlassian only. anonymous_export_view is the same as 'export_view' format but only content viewable by an anonymous user is included.\r\n{quote}\r\nIt talks about a \"body format\" without explaining what that means. The example POST given next shows that {{body}} actually has a structure and requires a format with a value and a representation, but is not actually a valid payload (should only have one format), and the full set of available formats and representations is not defined.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\nThere is a [question in Community|https://community.developer.atlassian.com/t/can-i-create-content-in-confluence-cloud-using-atlassian-document-format-adf-rather-than-storage-format/30720] that includes part of the answer, for ADF at least.\r\n",

Issue Summary\r\n\r\nIf there is some custom content that has been recently created via a third-party app (tested with Gliffy diagram) and then app is uninstalled, then recent updates API (*{color:#505f79}{{wiki/rest/dashboardmacros/1.0/updates.json}}{color}*) may return an error. Presumably it happens because it can't read some info from the app descriptor.\r\n\r\nAs of June 2020 this API is called from Confluence home page recent updates feed, which causes it to display an error.\r\nh3.

Actual Results\r\n\r\nRecent updates feed now displays an error and no results (see attached recent_updates_feed_error.png).\r\n\r\nCalling the API that is called by a feed (wiki/rest/dashboardmacros/1.0/updates.json?maxResults=40&tab=all&showProfilePic=true&labels=&spaces=&users=&types=&category=&spaceKey=) returns an error:\r\n{noformat}\r\n{\"message\":\u00a0\"Expected an enabled ContentTypeModuleDescriptor for key ac:com.gliffy.integration.confluence:gliffy-diagram, found none\",\"status-code\":\u00a0500,\"stack-trace\":\u00a0\"\"}\r\n{noformat}\r\nh3.

We recognize that some of you are experiencing a related bug, where the task report macro is currently duplicating some tasks depending on how its pagination is set. We are tracking reports of this bug's occurrence on at https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFCLOUD-72026. You can follow along the ticket there as the source of truth. Thank you again for your feedback!\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nSunny Xu\r\n\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\nh3. Issue Summary\r\n\r\nWorking with tasks on Confluence is a great way to keep tracking our daily job! Sometimes, on an existing page that already contains a determined format, we can copy it and then just change the tasks' description, in order to make our life easier - though, doing this is currently making the Task Report macro to behave unexpectedly.\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Create a page called *Report* and add a Task Report macro;\r\n # In the same space you created the above page, create a new one called *Tasks*;\r\n # Add a few tasks with random names there (3 tasks are enough) and publish the page;\r\n # Copy *Tasks*;\r\n # In the *Copy of Tasks*, change the text from the three tasks and publish the page;\r\n # Go to the *Report* page.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nThe Task Report macro shows all the distinct tasks from both pages;\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nThe Task Report macro duplicate the tasks that got their name changed on the copied page. It also happens in the tasks session, on the user profile.\r\n\r\n*Notes*:\r\n * If on step #5 you actually remove the tasks and publish the page without any task, in the report macro/user profile tasks, they are shown with the old name in the copied page.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nCurrently there is no known workaround for this behavior. A workaround will be added here when available",

Issue Summary\r\n\r\nThe problem happens for old pages (fabric though) that have Jira macros, the macro won't list the issues throwing \"JIRA project doesn't exist or you don't have permission to view it.\" for any users even with access to the project/ issues.\r\n\r\nIt seems like Jira Macro can't recognize Jira Search URL\u00a0\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nit's only happening for existing macros created a few months ago using the Jira URL instead of a JQL.\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nTable should be displayed correctly.\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nTable can't be shown correctly\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\nEdit the Jira macro and publish it again.",
