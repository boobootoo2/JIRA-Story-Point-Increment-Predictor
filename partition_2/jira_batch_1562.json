They run Confluence in managed environments where proxies are employed and ports are often blocked. Their infrastructure teams may also have security protocols or policies they must abide by that forbid some of the access that Companion App requires to function.\r\n\r\nThis access is often something both the users and the infrastructure teams have no ability to change in their environment leading to an impaired experience and no ability to edit documents in this manner.\r\n\r\nSince most browsers do not allow an insecure websocket connection (from the browser to Companion) when Confluence is hosted on a secure connection, in order to make a secure websocket connection between the browser and companion,\u00a0we've created a DNS on the public internet for atlassian-domain-for-localhost-connections-only.com that maps to the IP address 127.0.0.1.\u00a0It is imperative that this domain is excluded from the Browser's forward proxies, otherwise the Browser will never find its way from the forward proxy back to the Companion App on the local machine. If the connection is not allowed\u00a0we do fall back to trying to connect to 127.0.0.1\u00a0directly if the domain connections failed, however depending on the cause of failure this could take additional time before a connection is made.\r\n\r\n\u00a0",

Summary\r\nTables that are generated by macros and have <thead> HTML tag are not sortable when they are added to to Expand macro. \r\n\r\nThis issue seems to be related to [CONFSERVER-55253|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFSERVER-55253] where tables generated by the Page Property Report macro are not sortable when added to the expand macro. However, it seems that this issue is more common and happens to other tables that are generated by macro. \r\n\r\nAnother example of this is Content Report Table. A table that is generated by this macro and placed inside the Expand macro will not be sortable.\r\n\r\nA common characteristic of both of the above tables are that they \r\n* Have two <thead> tags where the first is wrapped around the header *and* the  second <thead> tag is wrapped around the first element of the table from <tbody>. \r\n* The table macros above when not added to an expand macro will only have one <thead> tag and it is wrapped around the header of the table only\r\n\r\n\r\nh3.

Summary\r\n\r\nA page with the \"Content by label\" macro, combined with an Excerpt Display option of \"Rich content\" will prevent a page from loading given enough pages with the label.

Environment\r\n\r\nConfirmed in Confluence 6.4.2 and 6.6.7\r\nContent by Label macro with Excerpt Display set to Rich Content\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n * Create a page (Test Parent Page for example) that contains the Content by Label macro. Click edit and set \"Excerpt Display\" to Rich Content. Add a label to this page e.g. \"test\"\r\n * Create child pages that all contain the Content by Label macro with the rich content option set and the test label (In testing, performance starts to noticeably decrease with 4 child pages. The more pages you add in this configuration the longer the loading takes)\r\n * Attempt to load any of the pages\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nPage renders in a reasonable amount of time or an error is logged/displayed\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nNothing logged whilst page is being loaded, however, if you keep your page count low whilst still triggering the issue, you get a stack like this just before the load eventually completes.

But what I am proposing is so easy for you to do but also so powerful that I decided to create a ticket for it to pitch the idea to you.\u00a0\r\n\r\nI'd like to see the ability to have a configurable button on a Confluence page that you can have the option to only add a label to the page, only remove a label to a page or choose that it toggles the said label on/off of the page.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThis functionality would allow for Application like functionality within Confluence. Here is a few examples below.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nCase Scenario 1:\u00a0 I have a page that I use the create from template button to make pages that are storyboards for eLearning training development lessons. The new storyboard page inherits the labels from my template page. I have a work flow main page based on labels and what labels are on the storyboard pages. I am using the macro Content by label to show the storyboards in each state. To advance a storyboard from planned, to in production, to editing, etc, I simply remove a label to move it from one step in the work flow to the next. With buttons that can add or remove labels then I can have a toolbar in my page template to move a page through the workflow. This would be powerful for the end user.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nCase Scenario 2:\u00a0 I have a knowledge base page with a create from template button to create a new how-to article. The new pages inherit the label \"draft\" from my template page. I now have draft how-to articles that myself and my tech writer can vet out and polish up and then remove the draft label and consider the page as production.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nTheoretical Case Scenarios: Using the concept I am employing above you can have a page for \"ToDo\". You can create your tasks for yourself and merely press a button on that tasks page as \"Done\" and you're done. That main page could easily be copied and setup for other people for their own task list without much explanation of what labels do what for the status of your task list. Also it would be customization for power users obviously.\u00a0\r\n\r\nAlso, you could have a team of people creating new projects and then have them go through a work flow to completion. End users would have to just click a button on a page that is in plain English. This would be such an amazing and powerful feature for your company to have. Companies don't want to have to purchase very expensive line of business applications for the various project management or process management that they do. For most uses this would serve the purpose needed.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nA complementary macro to the button or perhaps the macro could have an alternate option of a drop down that could be configurable so you can present 3 labels (statuses) for your particular workflow to your end users.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nYou guys have nothing to lose and everything to gain from this. Can I get it next week? : )",

Expected Results\r\nBy right Confluence should then allow the user to edit their additional user attributes from the _User Profile_ page as this data is managed locally in Confluence and will not be synced over to other external user directories (LDAP or Jira). \r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nModifying only an additional user attribute (e.g. phone number) from the _User Profile_ page, Confluence will actually  perform the LDAP application permission validation which then will then cause the _APPLICATION_PERMISSION_DENIED_ that we're seeing as LDAP user directory is configured to _Read Only_. By right, on additional user attribute edit Confluence does not have to validate the LDAP directory again as the additional user attribute is stored locally. It should only do this when the user modify their full name or email address from the _User Profile_ page.\r\n\r\nThe below exception is thrown in the {{<Confluence-Home>/logs/atlassian-confluence.log}} file:\r\n{code}\r\n2018-09-19 17:09:13,422 WARN [http-nio-6614-exec-9] [confluence.user.actions.EditMyProfileAction] doEdit Failed to update user profile.\r\n -- referer: http://localhost:6614/c614/users/editmyprofile.action | url: /c614/users/doeditmyprofile.action | traceId: e3ee830189874605 | userName: lauretha | action: doed\r\nitmyprofile\r\ncom.atlassian.crowd.exception.runtime.OperationFailedException: com.atlassian.crowd.exception.ApplicationPermissionException: <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\" standalon\r\ne=\"yes\"?><error><reason>APPLICATION_PERMISSION_DENIED</reason><message>Cannot update user 'lauretha' because directory 'LDAP server' does not allow updates.</message></erro\r\nr>\r\n        at com.atlassian.crowd.embedded.core.CrowdServiceImpl.updateUser(CrowdServiceImpl.java:377)\r\n...\r\nCaused by: com.atlassian.crowd.exception.ApplicationPermissionException: <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\" standalone=\"yes\"?><error><reason>APPLICATION_PERMISSION_DENIED</reason><message>Cannot update user 'lauretha' because directory 'LDAP server' does not allow updates.</message></error>\r\n        at com.atlassian.crowd.integration.rest.service.RestExecutor$MethodExecutor.throwError(RestExecutor.java:614)\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nWith the following error message thrown in the Confluence UI:\r\n !Screen Shot 2018-09-19 at 6.08.01 PM.png|thumbnail!

      "description": "h3. Summary\r\nBased on the [removeStaleSharedDrafts class|https://docs.atlassian.com/atlassian-confluence/6.2.0/com/atlassian/confluence/pages/PageManager.html#removeStaleSharedDrafts--], a stale draft is defined as:\r\n{quote}Pages with a {{content_status}} '*draft*' and which have a last modified date that is earlier than or equal to the last modified date on the published page.{quote}\r\nHowever, it is possible that a draft is marked as stale only by definition but in theory, it is still a valid draft. Refer to the 'Steps to reproduce' section for more information.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to reproduce\r\n# Create a new page and insert a task to the page.\r\n# Publish the page.\r\n# Edit the page again to add some text, then close the editor while opting to save it as a draft.\r\n# Run the query in [How to manually remove Stale Drafts from Confluence Database|https://confluence.atlassian.com/confkb/how-to-manually-remove-stale-drafts-from-confluence-database-951392345.html] to confirm that a stale draft doesn't exist yet in the DB.\r\n {code}SELECT d.contentid, d.title, d.prevver, d.lastmoddate, c.lastmoddate\r\nFROM CONTENT d\r\nJOIN CONTENT c\r\n  ON d.prevver = c.contentid\r\nWHERE d.content_status = 'draft'\r\n  AND d.prevver IS NOT NULL\r\n  AND c.lastmoddate > d.lastmoddate;{code}\r\n# On the page in 'View' mode, mark the task as completed. This creates a new version of the page without the draft being published.\r\n# Run the query in step #4 again and we will see that there is one stale draft.\r\n# Set Collaborative Editing to 'Off' or 'Limited' and then to 'On' to trigger the stale draft removal process.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected results\r\nThe draft should not be removed despite it fitting the definition/criteria of a stale draft.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual results\r\nThe draft is removed because the draft's {{lastmoddate}} is earlier than the page's {{lastmoddate}}, which fits the definition of a stale draft.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\nBefore turning Collaborative Editing ON you can retrieve information from possibly affected pages by running the query below.\r\nWith that information, Confluence administrators will be able to share the draft content if a user asks for it.\r\n\r\nThis query will list the following attributes:\r\n * Draft ID\r\n * Draft last modify date\r\n * Draft storage format\r\n * Current version pageID\r\n * Link to the current page\r\n * Creator username\r\n * Last modifier username\r\n * Last modify date\r\n\r\n{code:language=SQL}\r\nSELECT  DISTINCT(d.contentid) AS DRAFT_ID, d.lastmoddate AS DRAFT_LAST_MOD_DATE, bd.body AS DRAFT_STORAGE_FORMAT, c.contentid AS CURRENT_VERSION_ID, '<Confluence Base URL>/viewpage.action?pageId='||c.contentid AS CURRENT_VERSION_LINK, umc.lower_username AS CURRENT_VERSION_CREATOR, umcm.lower_username AS CURRENT_VERSION_LAST_MODIFIER, c.lastmoddate AS CURRENT_VERSION_LASTMODDATE\r\nFROM CONTENT d\r\nJOIN CONTENT c ON d.prevver = c.contentid\r\nJOIN \"AO_BAF3AA_AOINLINE_TASK\" i ON d.prevver = i.\"CONTENT_ID\"\r\nJOIN BODYCONTENT bd ON bd.contentid = d.contentid\r\nJOIN USER_MAPPING umc ON umc.user_key = c.creator\r\nJOIN USER_MAPPING umcm ON umcm.user_key = c.lastmodifier\r\nWHERE d.content_status = 'draft'\r\n  AND d.prevver IS NOT NULL\r\n  AND c.lastmoddate > d.lastmoddate\r\n  AND (i.\"COMPLETE_DATE\" > d.lastmoddate OR i.\"UPDATE_DATE\" > d.lastmoddate)\r\n;\r\n{code}",
