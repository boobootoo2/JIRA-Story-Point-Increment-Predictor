Currently all groups of every user are synced. Only a very small percent of these groups are actually used by Confluence for Space or Page restrictions. \r\n\r\nIts very likely that Confluence DB could easily keep track of the groups that are actually used for Space or Page restrictions then embedded crowd only copy/sync those.\r\n\r\nOur LDAP is huge, and we are not able to restrict group filter by OU or group name because the groups that are used by confluence to control permissions are scattered, and not in our control to duplicate or rename. Implementation of embedded crowd copied many thousands of groups into Confluence for absolutely no purpose within Confluence. This is a huge security concern as well as a deviation from an otherwise stellar product.\r\n\r\nLogin was taking upwards a minute because embedded crowd was attempting to sync massive groups that serve absolutely no purpose within Confluence. Once the group filter excluded these login dropped to an acceptable duration, but still thousands upon thousands of groups are sync'ed for no reason at all. Editing the UD group filter is very difficult when one wishes to negate most of their entire LDAP!\r\n\r\nPLUS a GROUP SEARCH filter is very badly needed on the Manage Groups page!\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nCraig ",
