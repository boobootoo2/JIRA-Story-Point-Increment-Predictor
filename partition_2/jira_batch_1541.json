When creating these story's in Jira there is no way to note which team this is.

This appears usually when adding comments to a page and then going to print the page.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, this issue happens when using the browser's own print option and not Confluence's own export options. There are several valid reasons why a user will want to use this method instead of exporting from within Confluence, as currently there is not a method to include comments on a single page export (this option is only shown for whole Space exports) and Confluence will export the page different than what is shown unless the PDF export is customized with CSS/HTML.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n# Create a page with a few paragraphs worth of content and save.\r\n# Add a comment to the page and then immediately press CTRL + P to print the page from the browser.\r\n# Notice that the text is smaller than what is shown on the page.\r\n# Refresh the page and print it again. You will see that the text is back to its normal size.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nA page with the correct text size shown on the export.\r\n\r\n!normal.png!\r\n\r\nh3.

Current flow:\r\n\r\n- Users scan the QR code with a separate app\r\n- App processes the link, and a username/password prompt is thrown\r\n- Users are then presented with a choice to open the link in the Confluence app or via a browser\r\n- Users choose open-in-app and proceed to access the info\r\n\r\nh4. Expected use case:\r\n\r\n- Users open the Confluence app\r\n- Confluence app is capable of scanning the QR code\r\n- Confluence app navigates to the page in question as soon as the app sees the QR code",

      "description": "h3. Issue Summary\r\n\r\nWhen adding an image to a page and applying an image effect, if you choose drop-shadow the {{ImageFilterEffect}} thread will become long-running and cause a JVM pause while it's attempting to go to safepoint for garbage collection or other VM tasks.\u00a0\r\n\r\nPauses can be an upwards of 35 seconds, which is long enough to cause a node ejection in Data Center environments if the Hazelcast heartbeat is set to the default interval of 30 seconds or less. Other pauses can still be 9-24 seconds, during which the Confluence application would be totally inaccessible.\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Create a new page and upload the *1MB-small-image.png* file (see below), which is under 1MB in size\r\n # Hover your mouse over the inserted image and select \"Properties\"\r\n # Choose the \"Drop Shadow\" effect and click OK\r\n # You will then observe a long pause while it processes this small image, during which time the JVM itself is paused\r\n\r\nA similar long pause can be induced by using very large files also, (must be less than 16MB in size, which is the {{ImageFilterEffect}} plugin's default threshold). See *14MB-large-image.png* as an example.\u00a0\r\n\r\nOnly certain small files can induce the long pauses, as many less than 1MB images process in under 3 seconds. This is likely has more to do with the pixel count than it does with the size of the image, as the\u00a0*3MB-small-image-fast-processing.png* example file (see below) will process faster than the 1MB example file - the difference being the pixel count.\u00a0\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nThe image will be displayed on the page with the image effect applied to it, and the whole process will complete in 2-3 seconds max.\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nThe JVM will pause for upwards of 9-35 seconds while processing the image effect due to the rush to safepoint being delayed by the {{ImageFilterEffect}} thread - it is suspected that {{ImageFilterEffect}} thread is executing native code while processing images, in which case the thread would ignore the call to safepoint until it's completed processing.\r\n\r\nThe following safepoint statistics output will be shown in the {{catalina.out}} file:\r\n{code:java}\r\n# SafepointSynchronize::begin: Timeout detected:\r\n# SafepointSynchronize::begin: Timed out while spinning to reach a safepoint.\r\n# SafepointSynchronize::begin: Threads which did not reach the safepoint:\r\n# \"ImageFilterEffect:thread-4\" #284 daemon prio=5 os_prio=0 tid=0x00007ffa080d4000 nid=0x1059 runnable [0x0000000000000000]\r\n   java.lang.Thread.State: RUNNABLE\r\n\r\n# SafepointSynchronize::begin: (End of list)\r\n         vmop                    [threads: total initially_running wait_to_block]    [time: spin block sync cleanup vmop] page_trap_count\r\n1119.475: CGC_Operation                    [     173          1              1    ]      [ 14748     0 14749     0    65    ]  1\r\n         vmop                    [threads: total initially_running wait_to_block]    [time: spin block sync cleanup vmop] page_trap_count\r\n1134.291: CGC_Operation                    [     173          1              3    ]      [  5667     0  5667     0     3    ]  1\r\n{code}\r\nThe following system properties must be added to see the output above:\r\n{code:java}\r\n-XX:+UnlockCommercialFeatures \r\n-XX:+PrintSafepointStatistics \r\n-XX:PrintSafepointStatisticsCount=1 \r\n-XX:+SafepointTimeout \r\n-XX:SafepointTimeoutDelay=20000 \r\n{code}\r\nThe {{atlassian-confluence.log}} file will show the following:\r\n{code:java}\r\n2020-05-15 10:27:33,688 DEBUG [http-nio-8090-exec-10] [confluence.image.effects.ImageFilterServlet] doGetInTransaction Doing a transform\r\n2020-05-15 10:27:33,691 DEBUG [http-nio-8090-exec-10] [confluence.image.effects.DefaultImageEffectsClientSupplier] buildServiceUri Attempting to parse: null\r\n2020-05-15 10:27:33,712 DEBUG [ImageFilterEffect:thread-1] [confluence.image.effects.ImageFilterTask] processInMemory Processing transformation in memory\r\n2020-05-15 10:27:43,711 WARN [http-nio-8090-exec-10] [confluence.image.effects.ImageFilterServlet] transformAndRespond Timed out while doing the transform\r\n -- referer: http://10.125.91.51:8090/display/DRAG/Image+page+3 | url: /download/attachments/1540097/Bangkok_Thailand_2009-14MB.png | traceId: d99c9c2c222bca9b | userName: admin\r\njava.util.concurrent.TimeoutException\r\n\tat java.util.concurrent.FutureTask.get(FutureTask.java:205)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.confluence.image.effects.ImageFilterServlet.transformAndRespond(ImageFilterServlet.java:331)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.confluence.image.effects.ImageFilterServlet.writeTransformToResponse(ImageFilterServlet.java:203)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.confluence.image.effects.ImageFilterServlet.doGetInTransaction(ImageFilterServlet.java:162)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.confluence.image.effects.ImageFilterServlet.lambda$doGet$0(ImageFilterServlet.java:139)\r\n..truncated....\r\n2020-05-15 10:27:43,715 DEBUG [http-nio-8090-exec-10] [confluence.image.effects.ImageFilterServlet] writeTransformToResponse Sending back the original\r\n{code}\r\nThe following logging package must be set to DEBUG to see the output above:\r\n{code:java}\r\ncom.atlassian.confluence.image\t\r\n{code}\r\nh3.

Example 1:\r\n # Create a page with a title of 255 characters including a *]]*:\r\n{code:java}\r\nHere is my page title [in brackets [no really]] 1234567890 1234567890 1234567890 1234567890 1234567890 1234567890 1234567890 1234567890 1234567890 1234567890 1234567890 1234567890 1234567890 1234567890 1234567890 1234567890 1234567890 1234567890 12345678\r\n{code}\r\n\r\n # Create an XML backup.\r\n # If you locate the title value within the entities.xml, notice that it is now 256 characters long and includes an extra space after *]]*:\r\n{code:java}\r\n<property name=\"lowerTitle\"><![CDATA[here is my page title [in brackets [no really]]  1234567890 1234567890 1234567890 1234567890 1234567890 1234567890 1234567890 1234567890 1234567890 1234567890 1234567890 1234567890 1234567890 1234567890 1234567890 1234567890 1234567890 1234567890 12345678]]></property>\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nh5. Example 2:\r\n # Install the ServiceRocket Page Approval plugin.\r\n # Create a page with a number of characters in the title that when included with the base URL wrapped in an <a> tag, is around 225 characters. Also this title must include a *]]*. For example:\r\n{code:java}\r\nCHG000012345-[HARDWARE DIAGNOSIS[ RESTART SERVER]] - ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOP291234567890{code}\r\n\r\n # Add an attachment to the page.\r\n # For the page ID in question, check the _string_val_ field of the *OS_PROPERTYENTRY* table for an entry that looks like this. Notice that the entry includes the base URL wrapped in an <a> and this entry is 255 chars long:\r\n{code:java}\r\nAn attachment for page <a href=\"http://localhost:9614/conf/display/BIN/CHG000012345-%5BHARDWARE+DIAGNOSIS%5B+RESTART+SERVER%5D%5D+-+ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOP291234567890\">CHG000012345-[HARDWARE DIAGNOSIS[ RESTART SERVER]] - ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOP291234567890</a> has bee\r\n{code}\r\n\r\n # Create an XML backup.\r\n # If you locate this value in the entities.xml, you'll see that it's now 256 characters long (with an extra space after the *]]*) which is long enough to cause a subsequent import of this file to fail.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nThe XML backup process should should not add an extra space when it encounters double *]]* characters.\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nCertain entries in the backup XML file can exceed 255 characters.\r\n\r\nIf you import this XML backup, it will fail with the following message in the application logs:\r\n{code:java}\r\n2020-05-13 16:27:47,864 ERROR [Long running task: Importing data] [confluence.importexport.xmlimport.BackupImporter] importEntities Cannot import the entities: \r\n -- url: /conf/longrunningtaskxml.action | referer: http://localhost:9614/conf/admin/restore-local-file.action | traceId: 1884ee64fe2b4620 | userName: charlie | action: longrunningtaskxml\r\ncom.atlassian.confluence.importexport.ImportExportException: Unable to complete import: could not execute statement\r\n...\r\nCaused by: org.postgresql.util.PSQLException: ERROR: value too long for type character varying(255)\r\n{code}\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nThere are a couple of possible workarounds:\r\n # Edit the entities XML file to remove the extra space. To make this easier, you could search for strings that match the pattern ]]\u00a0 \u00a0(eg. ]]spacespace) and replace with ]]\u00a0 (eg. ]]space).  If the file is particularly large, you could try using the [sed command|https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/how-to-use-sed-to-find-and-replace-text-in-files-in-linux-unix-shell/].\r\n # Locate the pages that have a *]]* in the title and either:\r\n ## Remove one of the brackets.\r\n ## Or, insert a space between the two brackets.\r\n *** And if using the Page Approval macro, add another attachment to the page to refresh the entry in the *OS_PROPERTYENTRY* table.\r\n ## Then create a new XML backup.",

Expected Results\r\n\r\nSynchrony should start properly without checking mount point permission. Before Confluence 7.1.x , the issue is not reproducible. If the mount has noexec, Synchrony is getting started without any problem.\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nUsers are unable to start the Synchrony and getting below error with Confluence version 7.x.x.\r\n{code:java}\r\n2020-04-04 18:13:12,561 ERROR [StartEventPublisher:thread-1] [hardware.platform.linux.LinuxGlobalMemory] <init> Failed to get mem_unit from sysinfo. {}\r\njava.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: /home/hemant/.cache/JNA/temp/jna40762817292981485.tmp: /home/hemant/.cache/JNA/temp/jna40762817292981485.tmp: failed to map segment from shared object\r\n\tat java.lang.ClassLoader$NativeLibrary.load(Native Method)\r\n\tat java.lang.ClassLoader.loadLibrary0(ClassLoader.java:1946)\r\n\tat java.lang.ClassLoader.loadLibrary(ClassLoader.java:1828)\r\n2020-04-04 18:14:59,078 ERROR [Long running task: EnableTask] [confluence.util.longrunning.ConfluenceAbstractLongRunningTask] run Long running task \"EnableTask\" failed to run.\r\n -- url: /rest/synchrony-interop/enable | referer: http://192.168.1.8:8090/admin/confluence-collaborative-editor-plugin/configure.action | traceId: 80bbe0e1a4d102dd | userName: admin\r\njava.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: Could not initialize class oshi.jna.platform.linux.Libc\r\n\tat oshi.software.os.linux.LinuxOperatingSystem.getProcessId(LinuxOperatingSystem.java:344)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.confluence.plugins.synchrony.bootstrap.DefaultSynchronyProcessManager.getConfluenceProcessId(DefaultSynchronyProcessManager.java:702)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.confluence.plugins.synchrony.bootstrap.DefaultSynchronyProcessManager.setupEnvironment(DefaultSynchronyProcessManager.java:391)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.confluence.plugins.synchrony.bootstrap.DefaultSynchronyProcessManager.trySetup(DefaultSynchronyProcessManager.java:709)\r\n{code}\r\nSimilar issues can be caused if there is not enough space where the JNA temp dir exists:\r\n{code:java}\r\nWARN [lifecycle:thread-27] [plugins.synchrony.bootstrap.SynchronyInteropBootstrap] onStart An exception occurred while waiting for Synchrony to start: java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: Failed to create temporary file for /com/sun/jna/linux-x86-64/libjnidispatch.so library: No space left on device\r\n{code}\r\n{code:java}\r\nCaused by: java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: Failed to create temporary file for /com/sun/jna/linux-x86-64/libjnidispatch.so library: No space left on device\r\n{code}\r\nh3. Environment\r\n * Confluence version 7.x onwards\r\n * Linux / Unix like Operating system\r\n\r\nh3. Notes\r\n\r\nThis issue does not usually occur before Confluence 7.1.x versions.\r\n\r\nThe issue may happen even if Confluence is not installed under the home folder. This is because the *jnidispatch.path* is defined under the home folder of the user account that owns the Confluence process. This is where the JNA temp files are located, hence the error on the logs.\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nThere are 3 workarounds to fix this issue:\r\n # Remount /home as exec permission. For this use below command,\r\n{code:java}\r\n$ mount -o remount,exec /home\r\n{code}\r\n\r\n # Transfer Confluence Home directory to another File system which has exec permission.\r\n # Or, change the JNA temp dir with the following system property:\r\n{code:java}\r\n-Djna.tmpdir=<path>{code}\r\n\r\n(i)\u00a0In addition to remounting, be sure that the ID running the\u00a0Confluence process has the proper permissions and ownership of the _logs_, _temp_, and _work_ subfolders under the installation folder per\u00a0[How to set file system permissions for Confluence|https://confluence.atlassian.com/confkb/how-to-set-file-system-permissions-for-confluence-986879252.html] - otherwise the same error will appear after startup:\r\n * sudo chown -R confluenceID <confluence-install-folder>/logs\r\n * sudo chown -R confluenceID <confluence-install-folder>/work\r\n * sudo chown -R confluenceID <confluence-install-folder>/temp\r\n * sudo chmod -R u=rwx,g=rx,o=rx <confluence-install-folder>",

      "description": "h3. Issue Summary\r\n\r\nWhen users have had username clashes, the Inspect Permission feature interpret's \"Unknown users'\" permissions as anonymous permissions\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Have a Confluence with an external user directory, and two users, usera and userb.\r\n# In Confluence, grant userb individual permission to a space, or global \"Can use\" permission to the instance.  Do not grant anoymous access to the space or globally.\r\n # In the external directory, delete userb\r\n# Sync confluence with the external directory\r\n# Observe that the space/global permissions are still shown, but they are now shown as belonging to \"Unknown user\"\r\n# Rename usera to userb\r\n# Observe that the space/global permissions are still shown as belonging to \"Unknown user\"\r\n# Restart Confluence\r\n# Use the Inspect permissions screen to check the permissions in the space or globally.  Particularly check <anonymous> permissions\r\n\r\nAn alternative way to produce this bug is to have multiple external directories that provide different users with the same username.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nThe original userb permission should have no effect on inspect permissions\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nThe original userb permission will show as granting anonymous access.  This will show both as the permission anonymous users have, and will also be shown as all groups having that access to the space via anonymous access.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nYou can use the following query to get a list of spaces and users that have these permissions:\r\n{code:sql}\r\nselect s.spacekey, u.user_key, u.username, u.lower_username\r\nfrom spaces s, spacepermissions sp left join user_mapping u on sp.permusername = u.user_key\r\nwhere s.spaceid = sp.spaceid\r\n  and u.user_key is not null and u.lower_username is null\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nThen visit the space permissions screen for any spaces listed, and, assuming the Unknown users are genuinely obsolete remove the space permissions of the Unknown users. Under most circumstances Unknown user permissions will be obsolete and have no further value. Possible exceptions are if the Confluence instance's user directories have been temporarily rearranged or altered and so the other users will be restored later.\r\n\r\nAnd restart Confluence.  Or disable and enable the \"Inspect Permissions - Gatekeeper\" plugin.\r\n\r\nThis bug is fixed in 7.4.1 and 7.5.0\r\n\r\n",

Issue Summary\r\nThe [Spaces List Macro|https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/spaces-list-macro-139375.html] creates a panel the page with a list of Spaces available in the Confluence instance.\r\nThe user adding this macro can choose from the following options on which Spaces will be listed:\r\n{quote}\r\n * *(blank) -* All spaces in your site, with tabs.\r\n * *all* \u2013 All spaces in your Confluence site.\r\n * *category* \u2013 Spaces grouped according to space categories.\r\n * *favorite* \u2013 Spaces which you have added to My Spaces.\r\n * *new* \u2013 spaces created within the last 7 days.\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nThe options *all* and *category* (which is the default when the option is left on _blank_) will fetch *all* the Spaces from the Confluence instance and show that as an output within the page.\r\n\r\nFor Enterprise-sized instances, having thousands of Spaces is a common situation.\r\nDepending on how the cache is, Hibernate will need to retrieve this heavy data from the database, since it won't paginate the request.\r\nIf the page containing the macro is requested by multiple users at the same time, then it may create an event on which the database server is overloaded, cascading the issue to any other operation that may require information from the database.\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Install a vanilla instance of Confluence.\r\n # Create a Page in a sample Space and add a Spaces List Macro with the default options.\r\n # Create 4,000 Spaces.\r\n  #* You may use the following script to create them.\r\n{code}\r\nADMIN_USRNAME=admin\r\nADMIN_PWD=admin\r\nCONFLUENCE_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8090/confluence\r\n \r\nSPACE_KEY=SPC\r\nSPACE_NAME=SPACE_\r\nSPACE_DESC=TEST_SPACE\r\n \r\nfor i in $(seq 1 4000); do\r\n curl -u $ADMIN_USRNAME:$ADMIN_PWD -X POST -H 'content-type: application/json' ${CONFLUENCE_BASE_URL}/rest/api/space -d '{ \"key\": \"'${SPACE_KEY}${i}'\", \"name\": \"'${SPACE_NAME}${i}'\", \"description\": { \"plain\": { \"value\": \"'${SPACE_DESC}'\", \"representation\": \"plain\" } }, \"metadata\": {} }' >/dev/null 2>&1\r\ndone\r\n{code}\r\n # Go to *Cog icon* > *General Configuration* > *Cache Management* and flush all caches.\r\n  #* This will force Confluence to go the database on subsequent requests.\r\n # Run 10 simultaneous requests to display the page with the Spaces List Macro.\r\n  #* You may use a script similar to the below to run the 10 requests.\r\n{code}\r\nUSER_USRNAME=user\r\nUSER_PWD=user\r\nCONFLUENCE_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8090/confluence\r\nSPACE_KEY=SPACE123\r\nPAGE_WITH_MACRO=Page+with+Spaces+List+Macro\r\n\r\nfor i in $(seq 1 10); do\r\nnohup curl -u ${USER_USRNAME}:${USER_PWD} ${CONFLUENCE_BASE_URL}'/display/'${SPACE_KEY}'/'${PAGE_WITH_MACRO} >/dev/null &\r\ndone\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nAll requests are completed in a timely manner without overloading Confluence nor the database.\r\nIf the number of Spaces are too high, the resulting list will be paginated, similar to the presentation seen in the [Space Directory|https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/the-space-directory-777010843.html].\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nA single request takes a long time to complete and the simultaneous requests may overload the database if the information can't be retrieved from the cache.\r\n\r\nThe results below were taken from a test instance when requesting the target page once from the browser depending on how many Spaces are in the Confluence instance.\r\n||Number of Spaces||Processing Time||HAR

Workaround\r\n* Few workarounds are working in 7.4.0 such as saving the file as either a DOC or as a PDF file instead of DOCX. Then the import will not cause CPU spikes.\r\nInstead of importing the document from the insert menu. You can use the \"...\" menu from the page to attach the .docx file there and it will not cause CPU spikes.\r\n* Remove the charts from the file prior to upload. \r\n* Issue with uploading file as attachment doesn't happen in recent versions Confluence like *v7.11 and above*.\r\n\r\nh3. Notes\r\n\r\nI have attached the recording where I show the workarounds\r\n- import the DOCX document from the \"...\" menu on the page, browsing the Attachments and attaching the document there (not inserting it inside the page)\r\n- how the PDF and DOC version insertion is working fine whereas it is causing high CPU usages for the DOCX file.",
