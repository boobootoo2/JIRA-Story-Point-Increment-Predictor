Issue Summary\r\nFollowing [Splitting a Jira instance|https://confluence.atlassian.com/jira064/splitting-a-jira-instance-720412266.html] documentation and linking both Jira's together makes you require to OAuth approve Jira Software's Version Report gadget access. This is not expected as the approval is not required when making the same configuration for instances of non-common origin (both set up independently, that is not cloned ones).\r\n\r\nBefore splitting Jira has to generate it's own OAuth consumer key (e.g. by creating application link to other instance).\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Setup Jira (Title: \"Jira1\", port: 8080) with sample project\r\n# Link this Jira to any other Jira application, so it generates it's Oauth consumer ({{oauthconsumer}} table)\r\n# [Split the Jira instance|https://confluence.atlassian.com/jira064/splitting-a-jira-instance-720412266.html]\r\n## Copy Jira insallation, database and jirahome\r\n## For the copy:\r\n### Change jirahome location and port (8081)\r\n### Change \"{{jira.sid.key}}\" as mentioned in [Changing Server ID|https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirakb/changing-server-id-for-test-installations-285839562.html] documentation\r\n### Start Jira\r\n### In \u2699>\"System\">\"General configuration\" \r\n#### Adjust \"Base URL\" to match the port (8081)\r\n#### Change \"Title\" (\"Jira2\")\r\n# For \"Jira1\"\r\n## In \u2699>\"Applications\">\"Application links\"\r\n### Create new link to \"Jira2\"\r\n## Create new Dashboard\r\n## Add \"Version Report\" Gadget from Jira Software and configure it with default configuration.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nThe gadget displays only the chart.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nThe chart is displayed, but the gadget also asks for \"Login & approve\" of the local Jira instance.\r\n !Screen Shot 2019-01-24 at 16.42.14.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\nh3. Notes\r\nThe issue is happening because both Jira instances have same OAuth consumer key.\r\n\r\nOther gadgets could be affected, but so far only Version Report was identified to behave this way.\r\n\r\nIt's likely that the issue was present before Jira 7.2.0, but it wasn't verified.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\nCurrently there is no known workaround for this behavior. A workaround will be added here when available",

Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nAllow for a configuration option (such as a checkbox/toggle somewhere on the Board screen itself) which show or hide Subtasks on the Board Columns, without affecting their visibility in an Issue's Details.\r\n\r\nh3. Why this is important\r\n \r\nDepending on an organization's workflow, Admins and Users may prefer if Subtasks are visible on a board column, or perhaps hidden (If there are too many Issues/Subtasks in view). Rather than force one or the other, the application could be more flexible by providing the option to the Admin or User.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround \r\n{quote}For now, you can use the Work sub-filter to work around this. If you set the main Board filter to include all your Issues, including sub-tasks, and then add a sub-filter, e.g. Type != Sub-task (depending on your configuration), sub-tasks won't be displayed on the Board, but will be visible in the Issue Detail pane.{quote}",

There are user stories without links user stories with links. \r\n If I move a user story in my backlog, i.e. I do a re-prioritization, I want to have a simple way \u00a0to move the whole group of linked user stories to the new position in the backlog.\r\n\r\nIn the current version I have to move all stories one by one. E.g. the whole group of stories could be moved automatically when one story is moved. Alternatively, all linked stories could be selected if you select one story out of the group and then you can move them as a group.",

Issue Summary\r\n\r\nCommit messages where the Jira issue key is preceded with a plus sign (+) are not linked in Jira - ie. missing from the commit section of the development panel. For example a commit message like 'commit to +BLA-13' will not create a commit link in Jira. It will 'link' correctly in Bitbucket. \r\n\r\nh3. Environment\r\n\r\nTested with Jira 7.6.9 and Bitbucket 5.7.1\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Link a Jira 7.6.9 and Bitbucket 5.7.1 instance\r\n# Create a Repo\r\n# Create a commit and mention '+<Jiraissuekey>'. For example, use the commit message: {{git commit -m 'Initial commit of all files to the repository +BLA-11'}}\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nThe commit message shows in the Commit area of the Jira issue. The commit message shows in Bitbucket with a link to the Jira issue. \r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nThe commit message shows and is linked in Bitbucket. The commit is missing from the Development panel in Jira. \r\n\r\nSee the below screenshots for examples: \r\n\r\n*Commit in Bitbucket* \r\n !screenshot-1.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\n*Development Panel in Jira* \r\n !screenshot-2.png|thumbnail! \r\n \r\nh3. Workaround\r\nDo not use a + sign immediately before the Jira issue key. Leave a space between the + and issue key. ",

Specifying the version to be \"16.04.201811140\" rather than latest Jira + JSD start up successfully. However this isn't the only time I have seen this error - as part of\u00a0[https://hello.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DC/pages/359629496/Upgrading+Azure+Jira+Nodes], I attempted to deploy old Ubuntu images too (with the intention of seeing them upgraded) and there were a number of them raising the exact same issue. At the time I just kept on going to I got a working image just putting it down to JDK 7/8 OS issues. Given that Jira + JSD comes with it's own Oracle JDK (and clearly uses it from the logs), this is extremely weird but also easily reproducible as well. I have attached logs were we downgrade to \"16.04.201811140\".\r\n\u00a0\r\nEither way given that Fugue is an internal Atlassian library I don't see any reason to be using a deprecated version of it in the latest release of Jira and JSD. Hardcoding the Azure Ubuntu image either isn't going to be feasible either, given we'll miss out on latest security updates.\r\nh3.

Steps to Reproduce\r\n # In a software project, edit the permission scheme.\r\n # Set the 'Schedule Issue' permission to a user / group (e.g. Group_A)\r\n # Set the 'Edit issue' Permission to another group (e.g. Group_B)\r\n # Create Two boards, one Kanban and one Scrum.\r\n # Login with a user who does not have the 'Edit issue' Permission but has the 'Schedule Issue' Permission. (e.g. who belong to Group_A)\r\n # Try to rank the issues in the Scrum board, it works as expected, the ranking does not work and an error is returned that the user does not have the permission to edit the issues.\r\n # Switch to Kanban board and try to rank the issues.

This results in an inaccurate representation of the remaining work in burndown reports.\u00a0\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Set a Scrum board to use Story Points as the estimation statistic.\r\n # Add several stories to a sprint and estimate.\r\n # Start sprint.\r\n # Split one issue that has been estimated to 5 points- estimate the new one to 2 points, old one to 3.\r\n # View Sprint burn downchart.\r\n # View Release burndown chart.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nRemaining values remains unchanged as the actual amount of remaining work is unchanged - or-\u00a0 points are added as a scope change to the new issue and points are removed as a scope change to the old (and actual value remains unchanged).\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nThe sprint burndown chart shows the new issue created from the split as a scope change and adds two story points to the graph.\r\n\r\n!Image 2018-11-30 at 4.07.10 PM.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nThe release burndown chart also shows inaccurate values for remaining work (3 has been subtracted as 'completed' work and 2 has been added):\u00a0\r\n\r\n!Image 2018-12-03 at 8.25.27 AM.png|thumbnail!\r\nh3. Notes\r\n\r\nRemaining value is accurately reflected in the table below. See screenshot below. Note the table shows 16 points remaining vs the chart (screen shot above)which shows 18.\u00a0A possible solution for this would be to first check if an issue was split from a parent and use the parent's creation date for the chart (so that the work is not counted as a scope change).\u00a0\r\n\r\n!Image 2018-11-30 at 4.07.17 PM.png|thumbnail!\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nCurrently there is no known workaround for this behavior. A workaround will be added here when available",
