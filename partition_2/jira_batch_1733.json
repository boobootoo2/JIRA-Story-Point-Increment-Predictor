Background of Request\r\n\r\nThe current behavior of Confluence is to hide both child pages list in the lower part of the page and child page tree in the side navigation bar of \"Documentation Theme\".\r\n\r\nThis behavior require user to click at least once to see the list of child pages  of the parent page accessed and due to the design of the new drop down button it is hard to differentiate pages that have children and the one that doesn't have child pages. Since opening up the whole child page list in the lower part of the page could be aesthetically unpleasing if the number of child pages is huge, we should provide the option for this at side bar navigation. \r\n\r\nh3. Proposed Solution\r\n\r\nSince \"Documentation Theme\" provide side  navigation bar to, it would be great if administrator or users of Confluence has the ability to configure it to open the child page tree automatically when the parent page accessed.\r\n\r\nHence user will be able to use side navigation bar to see the list of child pages without clicking it.\r\n\r\nFor administrator, this configuration should be provided at theme configuration. For users, this configuration should be provided at user profile preferences option.\r\n\r\nAnother method is to improve the button icon to be a bigger and higher contrast so user would at least able to differentiate it easily.",

Background of Request\r\n\r\nAs of now, Confluence what's new feature can only be configurable to point to another Confluence page or link through modifying {{help.prefix}} as describe here:\r\n\r\n* [Configuring the What's New Dialog|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Configuring+the+What's+New+Dialog]\r\n\r\nHowever, help prefix also necessary when customer want to localized their help section as describe [here|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Local+Confluence+Documentation#LocalConfluenceDocumentation-helppagelinks]. This made the current method of What's New configuration unusable if customer want to use its own locale but keep the what's new to Atlassian site as describe [here|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONF-29065].\r\n\r\nh3. Proposed Solution\r\n\r\nIt would be great if Confluence provide a user interface method for What's new feature that cover the following option:\r\n\r\n* Follow {{help.prefix}}, and provide the field to input the prefix\r\n* Follow Atlassian site. This means it will always follow Atlassian What's new link repository which check against its version\r\n* Full Path URL. This provide the option to point to a specific URL",

With the current interface, labeling the images accordingly would take approximately five minutes, whereas a bulk editor might allow this to be done within seconds.",

Background of Request\r\n\r\nUnlike LDAP integration, Confluence does not have the ability to restrict one or some JIRA/Crowd groups to be synchronized to Confluence. In a huge organization, Confluence may not need all of JIRA/Crowd groups to be synchronized.\r\n\r\nHowever, since those groups are still synchronize to Confluence, administrator  need to manage those unnecessary groups in Confluence.\r\n\r\nh3. Proposed Solution\r\n\r\nProvide a field for administrators to restrict group(s) from JIRA or Crowd to be synchronized. If this fields able to understand lucene syntax (for example) it would be helpful. So administrators can restrict multiple groups in one sentence such as:\r\n\r\n{code}jira_*, administrators{code}\r\n\r\nThe above syntax mentioned means Confluence will not sync any groups that start with {{jira_}} and {{administrators}} groups.",

It will now float to the right of the page. \r\n\r\nNote that the loremipsum in the body of the page does not overlap with the panel, but the info box does. This is incorrect behaviour.\r\n\r\nEDIT\r\nDespite spending some time looking at it yesterday I have just figured out how to workaround it. You should set {overflow: auto} to .aui-message.

Symptoms\r\n\r\nWhen copying two pages at the same time, by the same user, if one of them has an attachment, and you save in the reverse order to the \"Copy\" operation being triggered, then the attachment will be saved in the wrong copy.

Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n# Create a page, which we will refer to as \"Page One\"\r\n# Attach a file to Page One\r\n# Create a page, which we will refer to as \"Page Two\"\r\n# Open Page One and Page Two in two different tabs\r\n# Click \"Tools > Copy\" in Page One, do not save yet\r\n# Click \"Tools > Copy\" in Page Two\r\n# Click \"save\" in Page Two\r\n# Click \"save\" in Page One\r\n\r\nAfter these steps you will find the attachment originally from Page One has been attached to \"Copy of Page Two\", with \"Copy of Page One\" not having any attachment.\r\n\r\nh5. Workaround\r\n\r\nSince this only happens when it's the same user doing the copy, it's possible to work around this by only saving in a first-in first-out method. That is, all pages should be saved in the order in which the Copy operation was triggered.",

Those problems unfortunately started to repeat.\r\n\r\nThose are the steps that I've done:\r\n1. Wrote \"Logback configuration\" section with code block (formatting in attachment).\r\n2. Save the document.\r\n3. Edit and add upper section with another code block (different formatting) + some No Format block (I'm not sure if it's connected, but I think it's worth mention)\r\n4. Save\r\n\r\nNow all code blocks (as you can see in attachment) have the same formatting as last code block. I'm also not 100% sure if this formatting is inherited from last code block or just randomly.\r\n\r\nI hope it's reproducible and can be fixed easily.\r\n\r\nConfluence: 5.1\r\nCode Macro Plugin:\t2.0.19\r\n\r\nLet me know if you need anythnig else.",

I had contacted support to see if there were any easy way to do this and it  seems like the only way to achieve this function at the moment is to install the source editor add-on and modify the HTML code. I tried and it works. However, this is not a feasible solution to ask to non-technical people. We have about 50% non-technical people in our Company and we can not ask them to follow this route. It would be nice if there was a feature similar to other macros where you could just select the height and the width on a percentage scale.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nAdhip",

Currently we copy the notes out of Jira, and paste them into confluence manually.  As you can imagine, with constant changes in Jira this is difficult to maintain.\r\n\r\nI was looking into the macro feature in confluence as described in:\r\n\r\nhttps://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/JIRA+Issues+Macro#JIRAIssuesMacro-restrictedviewing\r\n\r\nThe problem we have is that our customers do not have access to Jira, so I noticed the section: \u201cDisplaying Issues which have Restricted Viewing (Not applicable to Confluence OnDemand.)\u201d.  The page does not mention a solution for OnDemand customers like us.\r\n\r\nAfter contacting the atlassian support team, I was advised there's currently no easier way to achieve what we're trying to do, and to raise this new feature request.",
