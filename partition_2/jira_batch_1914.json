[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFCLOUD-5808].\n  {panel}\n\nIn previous versions of Confluence, Space Administrators could access the \"Layout\" page in \"Space Administration\" to edit the Space Theme manually (the Velocity files specifically). It appears that at some point after Confluence 2.0 this ability was removed due to security concerns but the documentation was not updated at the time. I ran into this and filed the following bug at http://support.atlassian.com -- CSP-3044.\r\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n\r\nI had a call from a Space Administrator today who was trying to modify the custom decorators for a space per these instructions.\r\n\r\nhttp://confluence.atlassian.com/display/CONF20/Working+with+Custom+Decorators\r\n\r\nHowever, he couldn't view the \"Layout\" link in the \"Look and Feel\" section of the \"Space Administration\" page (he only had 3 items there rather than 4). To test, I created a user, gave it space administration privileges and verified I couldn't see the \"Layout\" link. Interestingly enough, my regular user which has full Confluence Administration privileges (\"Administrate Confluence\" in \"Global Permissions\") could see the \"Layout\" link in \"Space Administration\".\r\n\r\nSome further testing showed that the only users who can see the \"Layout\" button in the \"Space Administration\" page are those with full \"Administrate Confluence\" privileges.\r\n\r\nSince the documentation above says \"You need to be a space administrator to edit decorator files.\" I'm presuming this is a bug and hope it can be easily/quickly fixed.\r\n\r\nI also tried to manually go to the layout link as a space administrator user and was denied with a \"You are not permitted to perform this operation.\" message.\r\n\r\nThanks for your help. \r\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~\r\n\r\nThe response was that \"Unfortunately it is a security risk to allow space administrators to put arbitrary velocity markup in layouts -- they could escalate their priviledges to those of the global administrator.\"\r\n\r\nI then noted that the docs were incorrect and asked if this had changed recently....the answer was \"At one time they could. The ideal solution would be to make sure that a 'bad' layout can't produce a security problem, but that's hard. You can raise a feature request for more granular permissions at http://jira.atlassian.com and we will consider it. \".\r\n\r\nSo....I'm making a feature request here that Space Administrators could selectively be allowed to edit the Layout files (Velocity files). I'm not very picky as to whether it's a global Confluence preference (i.e. all Space Administrators can edit Layout files) or an extra Space permissions.\r\n\r\nThanks.",

For more details on these improvements, [check out our release notes|https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/confluence-6-14-release-notes-963655609.html#Confluence6.14ReleaseNotes-FindworkfasterwiththenewConfluencesearch].\r\n\r\nThese changes didn\u2019t include the ability to sort search results, but we\u2019re still open to this improvement in the future. We\u2019d urge to try out the new improvements, and let us know whether you\u2019re still in need of this capability.\r\n\r\nBest\r\nJenny Millman | Senior Product Manager - Confluence Server\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\n\r\nAbility to sort search results by date and also alphabetically",

      "description": "Attempting to use Adaptavist's {link-page} and {add-page} macros (which add a linked page from a template as a child of another), I found out that when I use a template that contains a variable, the operation runs well. If I use a markup-only macro, the operation results in an orphaned page (everything else the same)\r\n\r\nDavid Peterson helped me up to the point where it was determined that the Confluence command used in both cases (with or without the variable inside a template) was essentially the same. At that point, he concluded that there is a bug in Confluence, and that i should post the bug. \r\n\r\nThis bug is absolutely CRITICAL for our implementation, as our workflow relies a lot on beiing able to create a set of templated pages for users on command.\r\n\r\nThis is the thread that took David to draw the conclusion that the problem is inside Confluence:\r\n\r\n> OK, I did the following:\r\n>\r\n> 1. Created a template called \"Test without variable\" which has only \r\n> one line that says:\r\n>    This is markup\r\n>\r\n> 2. Create another template called \"Test with variable\", which has TWO\r\n> lines:\r\n>    This is markup\r\n>    This is a variable: @var@\r\n>\r\n> 3. Wrote yet another test page called YAT. It has two lines, as \r\n> follows (minus the line braks):\r\n>    {link-page:parent=YAT|template=Test with variable}Click to link a \r\n> new Product!{link-page}\r\n>    {add-page:parent=YAT|template= Test with variable}Click to add a \r\n> new Product!{add-page}\r\n>\r\n> 4. Clicked on the two links of YAT as it looks above (while clicking, \r\n> the URL's produced are listed below). While I was entering the \r\n> variables, the breadcrumbs pointed to \"Dashboard > Root page > Browse \r\n> Space > Create Page\". When I entered the edit session (after \r\n> submitting the variables), the breadcrumbs were the same. When I \r\n> pressed \"Save\", it saved the page as YAT's child.\r\n>\r\n> http://myserver/pages/createpage-entervariables.action? \r\n> spaceKey=Obj&link\r\n> Creation=false&fromPageId=919&templateName=Test+with\r\n> +variable&templateId\r\n> =60\r\n>\r\n> http://myserver/pages/createpage-entervariables.action? \r\n> spaceKey=Obj&link\r\n> Creation=false&fromPageId=919&templateName=Test+with\r\n> +variable&templateId\r\n> =60\r\n>\r\n>\r\n> 5. I edited YAT and replaced \"Test with variable\" with \"Test without \r\n> variable\". When I pressed \"Save\", the page was saved as an orphan\r\n>\r\n> http://myserver/pages/createpage-entervariables.action? \r\n> spaceKey=Obj&link\r\n> Creation=false&fromPageId=919&templateName=Test+without\r\n> +variable&templat\r\n> eId=68\r\n>\r\n> http://myserver/pages/createpage-entervariables.action? \r\n> spaceKey=Obj&link\r\n> Creation=false&fromPageId=919&templateName=Test+without\r\n> +variable&templat\r\n> eId=68\r\n\r\n---------------------------------- David's responde follows:\r\nWell, you're out of my hands then - there would seem to be a problem with Confluence's templates. It would be a good idea to submit this as a bug in jira.atlassian.com. I'll definitely vote for it if you post the issue number here.\r\n",
