Tiny links have the advantage of being more stable for linking to confluence pages from other places (like JIRA).  Confluence does a pretty good job of re-directing old page names to new page names, but it is still adds extra steps to follow the links.  The nice thing about tiny links is that they survive refactoring of page names.  An example is using Confluence for program documentation and including links in JIRA issues and source code.  In particular, the smaller link is more convenient.\r\n\r\nI have customized .../pages/page-breadcrumbs.vm to include a small icon representing the tiny link.  Something like this would make the tiny link directly accessable without going to the INFO tab page.\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\n#if (!$viewpagebreadcrumb)\r\n ...\r\n\r\n## Customize - put an easy to access tiny link on the page as icon following page name in breadcrumb line\r\n            #if ($tinyUrl)\r\n                <a href=\"$helper.domainName/x/$helper.tinyUrl\">\r\n                    <img src=\"/images/icons/docs_16.gif\" width=\"12\" height=\"12\" hspace=\"4\" vspace=\"1\" align=\"absmiddle\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Tiny link to current page.\" title=\"Tiny link to current page.\"/>\r\n                </a>\r\n            #end\r\n\r\n#end\r\n{noformat}",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFCLOUD-9065].\n  {panel}\n\nIt is a policy of ours to keep our helpdesk (which had confluence admin rights so they can create spaces) from creating spaces that allow anonymous users to do anything more than view and create comments. So it would be very helpful if there were a way or hide or grey out the ability to do this in spaces/createspace-start.action without having to override the vm in confluence to do so. This could either be done through a properties file or via some new admin UI functionality.\r\n\r\nIn addition, it would be helpful to keep space admins and helpdesk (that are currently conf-admins so they can create spaces) from being able to change any anonymous permissions except view space and create comments. This would require a change to spaces/editspacepermissions.action?key=myspacekey\r\n\r\nCurrently we are already doing both of these things by overriding the confluence templates, but we'd rather be able to configure Confluence to do it instead.\r\n\r\nThanks!",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFCLOUD-9023].\n  {panel}\n\nScott F. was nice enough to suggest that I post this for consideration for a future release that addresses macros. \r\n\r\nTo summarize, disconnected numbering in Confluence today (2.5.4) can be problematic both in terms of keeping numbering from reverting to \"1.\" and in terms of keeping indentation correct. This is particularly a problem for documentation being created in Confluence because such doc is so dependent on ordered lists.\r\n\r\nWe've successfully implemented three macros that address this issue by exposing HTML numbering a little more directly. The macros are:\r\n\r\n|| macro || definition ||\r\n| setnumlst | <ol start=$param0 TYPE=$param1><li>$body</li>  |\r\n| lst | <li> |\r\n| endnumlst | </ol> |\r\n\r\nThus something like:\r\n\r\n{code}{setnumlst:3|A}Is this the third item in the list?{setnumlst}{code}\r\n\r\nWould appear as:\r\n\r\n{code}C. Is this the third item in the list?{code}\r\n\r\nand would be independent of any other numbering. \r\n\r\nHere's a little more elaborate example:\r\n\r\n{code}\r\nYou can inspect an existing key by:\r\n{setol:1|1}Opening the key schema file.{setol}\r\n\r\nh5. Inspecting a Key Schema\r\n\r\n!dsp30:images-datasrvc^Inspecting a Key Schema.gif|thumbnail!\r\n\r\n----\r\n{endol}\r\n{setol:2|1}Double-clicking on the key element.{setol}\r\n\r\nh5. Elements in a Key Element\r\n\r\n!dsp30:images-datasrvc^Key Elements in a Key Element.gif|thumbnail!\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nI'm attaching a picture of the result - the nice thing is that it isn't dependent on careful wikimarkup line spacing, etc. \r\n\r\nThanks for considering this. \r\n\r\nAlthough we've installed and used these macros, I wouldn't say that they have been extensively used by any means. If I discover any problems going forward I'll update this. Also, the names are probably problematic but I couldn't think of anything better. Cheers,",

Using the wiki and other tips (my classloader needed to be PARENT_LAST instead of PARENT_FIRST), installation was straight forward and the end result looked good. Except for plugins. I quickly noticed that I had no Rich Text editor capability and it appeared that I was missing other plugins if I recalled correctly an earlier installation.\r\n\r\nSince I hadn't really put much time into this I completely uninstalled everything and installed a slightly older version - 2.4.5. This installation also went well. And the result confirmed my suspicions: the Rich Text Editor was back as were a boatload of plugins.\r\n\r\nJust to confirm my earlier issues I then went back and completely uninstalled 2.4.5 and reinstalled 2.5.4 and once again I was missing Rich Text editing and a bunch of plugins. Summarizing what appears to be missing from my 2.5.4 installation:\r\n\r\n1) I am totally missing Rich Text editing.\r\n2) It looks like I am missing a whole bunch of plugins.\r\n3) I am missing the admin menu item called \"Plugin Repository\".\r\n\r\nI saw a similar thread - http://forums.atlassian.com/thread.jspa?messageID=257247903&#257247903 - that seemed to address the same thing. But in that one, they discuss the bundled-plugins/ directory not including the atlassian-tinymce-plugin-1.12.jar file. That's not the case with me. My fresh 2.5.4 install DID include that jar file and 10 others. But I still don't have any Rich Text editing capability. And yes, the admin Feature Settings menu showed that RTE is turned on, even though it doesn't appear.\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nAfter this, I just tried a fresh install of 2.5.5 and it has exactly the same problem as 2.5.4 described above.

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFCLOUD-9005].\r\n  {panel}\r\n\r\nHello,\r\n\r\nin our confluence installation we have many spaces. One of the big spaces has a fixed tree structure. On certain tree levels we have moderators that are responsible for their area (means for all the pages below a certain page -  descendants).\r\nDue to the size of the area a moderator would like to see recently created and updated pages of his area. One of the options would be to use labels, but a lot of people do forget to label their pages and those pages should also be found and reviewed by the moderator.\r\nWe would like to have recently-updated macro supporting similar parameters like metadata-report macro: in particular root and pages options (http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/CONFEXT/Metadata+Plugin#MetadataPlugin-Macrokeywords).\r\n\r\nUp to now, recently-updated macro is only usable for small spaces with a few edits.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n  Yuri\r\n\r\n\r\n{panel:title=Atlassian Update - January 2019|borderStyle=solid|borderColor=#3C78B5|titleBGColor=#3C78B5|bgColor=#E7F4FA}\r\n\r\n\r\nHi all, \r\n\r\nThanks for your interest in this issue. We appreciate that this request may bring many benefits to you. However, we're unable to implement all the suggestions.\r\n\r\nWe don't plan to work on this for the foreseeable future, but we will review this suggestion again in 12 months time and provide an update if the status changes. \r\n\r\n\r\nConfluence Server Product Management\r\n{panel}\r\n",
