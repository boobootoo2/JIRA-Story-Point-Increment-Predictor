As you can see on image \"conjiramac1.png\" we would like be able to sort the columns of the displayed report. You could do this either on the ready report OR you could do this in the \"Columns to display\" by dragging and dropping the columns to the place where they should be (see image \"conjiramac2.png\"). I think, the easiest way would be to enable drag and drop in the \"Columns to display\"-Field. If you want to change the order today, you have to delete the choosen fields and have to put them in the order manually.\r\n# 2.

Problem Definition\r\nBackground:\r\nI have a large wiki and have sub-pages that often have the same name.\r\nTo distinguish them, I've been namespacing them by appending the top-level category they fall under.\r\nExample: \"Languages (Programming)\"\r\nProblem:\r\nWhen I then search for the top-level category page, most of the results are for those sub-pages that also have the category-name in their title, and/or have the word \"program\" show up a bunch in the body.\r\nExample: I search for \"Programming\" to get the top-level \"Programming\" page, and instead I get a bunch of the sub-pages as results, like \"Languages (Programming)\".\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\nProposed solution:\r\nPrioritize pages for which the title of that page is an exact match for the search query.\r\nPrioritize pages for which the words in the query make up the largest % of the words in those pages' titles.\r\n\r\nh3. Note:\r\nI understand that CONF-9261 says that it does something along the lines of what I'm recommending. (\"Improve search by promoting exact matches\")\r\nI'm asking for a refinement of the way it works.\r\n",

The Confluence build is supposed to start Confluence, define an H2 file-based database, perform a few initialization steps (including setting up the developer license), then stop Confluence and zip the target directory into {{com.atlassian.confluence.plugins:confluence-plugin-test-resources:zip:5.9.1}}. This is the artifact which is used by the SDK to kick start Confluence with some existing data.\r\n\r\nContext, if you're not familiar with it:\r\nAMPS loads the  by default. It uses the same version as the version of Confluence. It is unzipped by AMPS in the target directory ({{target/\\{instanceId\\}/home}}, with instanceId=confluence ).\r\n\r\nNot only a good zip saves 10 minutes to all ecosystem developers per build, but also it helps us test various versions of Confluence with {{atlas-run-standalone}}.

However, if you remove anyone from a space as of 5.9.2, _all_ space watchers for that space are double checked, and removed if necessary. \r\nSo, if you have any space watchers that you'd like to remove from a particular space, you can re-add one of those users to the space and then remove them again. That will check and remove any watchers for that space that should no longer be watchers.\r\n\r\nAll space watchers that should no longer exist will be removed as part of the upgrade task that will run in Confluence 6.",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFCLOUD-40024].\n  {panel}\n\nh3. Problem Definition\r\nCurrently, if the Confluence indexer attempts to index an attachment that for one reason or another cannot be indexed a multitude of bad things can happen (bad Confluence performance, indexing task never finishing, etc). The only way to prevent this is to disable the indexing of attachments by following the instructions at [How to disable indexing of attachments|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/CONFKB/How+to+disable+indexing+of+attachments] and then rebuilding the indexes from scratch.\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\nMake the indexer a little smarter, and if it encounters an attachment that will not index multiple times (3-5?) then quarantine the attachment to prevent the index from trying to read it. This will allow other attachments to be indexed. Additionally it might be helpful for a list of quarantined attachments.",

I understand you have a \"terms of service\" that requires that HUGE \"Powered by Atlassian\" banner at the bottom, and you think it is *cool* (or something ) to have huge top banners, and big empty blue button bars and whatever else your designers want for theme or \"image.\"  But please consider the people using your software and find a way to reduce the noise and provide a clean, minimal interface for people who are stuck using your app.\r\n\r\nYou are going to get me to evangelize your product more if it suits my needs that you will be blasting \"Powered by Atlassian\" in my face all the time.  In fact, that banner does more harm than good for me.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n-Andrew",

Without an solution we have no way to become compatible with Confluence 5.9 and this will break our business and I hope that you will help us as one of your premium partners.\r\n\r\nIf you use a  plugin theme for Confluence which overwrites the global decorator, an JS error is thrown if you don't have the new elements of the new dashboard on the page. \r\n\r\nBecause of this errors all other JS isn't executed and the page is broken.\r\nSwitching to the old dashboard style helps, but how can I force this within the plugin, for example if the theme is activate after an upgrade. \r\nI saw the entry in the database to use the simple dashboard, but this entry is only user based - doesn't help.\r\n\r\n*Maybe a configuration point within the theme module could be an easy solution vor you.Just an true/ false for the new dashboard mode, like you have introduced it for the sidebar before.*\r\n\r\nThis issue brokes the complete dashboard functionality of our Enterprise Theme and I testet with other themes, they have the same issue. \r\n\r\nCould you give us an hint, how we can prevent loading these standard dashboard resources, because if you have a custom dashboard you don't need these breaking resources. \r\n\r\nI hope you can give us any help or you could fix this error in one of the next releases. \r\n\r\nI attached some screens to show you the issue and a pre version of our Enterprise Theme, so that you can test it.\r\n\r\n*Steps to reproduce* \r\n# Install the add-on\r\n# Active the theme\r\n# Create a Theme dashboard with the blueprint Global dashboard\r\n# Select this Theme  dashboard on the dashboard . => The TopStories Slider couldn't be loaded because of JS errors\r\n\r\n*Expected Results*\r\nNo JavaScript Errors from the new dashboard Resources and the new resources weren't loaded\r\n\r\n*Result*\r\nJavaScript Errors from the not needed resources, which break other JS.\r\n\r\nBest Greetings from Switzerland\r\nOli\r\n\r\nhttps://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/net.getunik.confluence.skin.core",
