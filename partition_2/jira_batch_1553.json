However, it appears that the positioning is off by about 5-10px.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Behavior\r\n- aui-spinner element replaces the Quick Search magnifying glass icon when searching for elements to auto-suggest\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Behavior\r\n- aui-spinner shows up to one side of the Quick Search bar - see screenshot for an example.\r\n\r\n !screenshot-1.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\nh3. Notes from Support\r\n\r\n- Confluence overrides some parameters from AUI elements that influence the positioning of certain items in the default UI.\r\n- There is no way to fix this manually as it comes from computed CSS in the archives. This would reflect a product-level fix for the positioning of the aui-spinner element.\r\n- This worked fine in Confluence 6.6. This looks like it might have been due to UI elements refreshed that were introduced after that version branch.\r\n- In the default color scheme it is not very noticeable unless you know what to look for. However, it can cause some confusion with the look and feel elements and is reproducible.\r\n- Originally we were able to only reproduce this with Firefox (macOS latest stable path). We were able to reproduce this later with Chrome (macOS latest developer build), so there may be something with the browser rendering of this element that causes this discrepancy.\r\n\r\nh3.

If for some reason the link attempt fails, then Confluence will not link the issue to the page, and the number of issue links will be invalid.\r\n\r\nh3.Example\r\nA customer may use something like ScriptRunner to create Jira issues in a Post Function, and then link them to a Confluence page. In cases where Jira hasn't finished reindexing an issue, Jira will return a 404 not found error for that issue, and the remoteLink will not be created.\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\nConfluence should check if the number of Jira links on the page matches the number returned by Jira's {{remote-link-aggregation}} endpoint (which is how Confluence determines the number of links on the page). If there is a mismatch, Confluence should attempt to recreate the links (although it would have to be done carefully to avoid inadvertently overwhelming Jira).\r\n \r\nh3. Workaround\r\nIn cases involving automation, it's possible to manually create the missing remote links, either by a REST or Java API.\r\n\r\nFor normal cases where Confluence could not reach Jira at the time of saving the page, try removing the Jira issue macro, saving the page, and then re-adding the macro again.",

This is inconsistent with the actual amount of issues listed in the email, as well as the regular scanner.  \r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nThe number is accurate and reflects the amount of issues displayed.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nThe number is inaccurate in the e-mail.  In two tests, a scan with 4 results said 5, and a scan with 11 results (pictured) says \"Found 13 known problems in the log file...\".\r\n\r\n !Screen Shot 2019-05-29 at 10.44.19.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nh3.

Problem Definition\r\nMinification definition from [Wikipedia|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minification_(programming)]:\r\n{quote}\r\nMinification (also minimisation or minimization), is the process of removing all unnecessary characters from the source codes of interpreted programming languages or markup languages without changing their functionality. These unnecessary characters usually include white space characters, new line characters, comments, and sometimes block delimiters, which are used to add readability to the code but are not required for it to execute. Minification reduces the size of the source code, making its transmission over a network (e.g. the Internet) more efficient.\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nTeam Calendars (TC) does not minify its JavaScript (JS) files.\r\nChecking a Batch JS file transferred when displaying a sample page, uncompressed Team Calendars JS content has a size of almost 2MB.\r\nUsing public available JS minification services, the size of the file was cut in half.\r\n\r\nSince this occurs on page view, which encompasses the majority of Confluence usage, transferring optimised JS files can lead to faster page loading times, specially on large instances.\r\n\r\nh3.

This is to prevent people from accidentally or maliciously sharing links that may pose a security risk to your site.\u00a0\r\n------------------------\r\n{color:#FF0000}As a solution we can disable whitelist but it is recommend not disabling the whitelist by atlassian.{color}\r\n\r\nReason for not disabling:\u00a0\r\nWe have the html-include-macro enabled in our confluence due to the need to include data from other sites in our confluence site. When enabling html-include macro we had to enable whitelistning as it open up for cross-site scripting.\r\n\r\nSo my question is :\r\nDid Shared link functionality has same risk of cross site scripting as html include macro ?\r\nIf your answer is NO, can you separate whitelist for Shared link?",

      "description": "h3. Issue Summary\r\nDepending on the number of watchers in a page (space watchers as well), creating or deleting page comments can take several seconds.\r\nThis happens because Confluence is processing notifications in the same thread as the one that triggered the action in the UI.\r\nThis might create an awful UI experience to the Confluence user, giving the impression the operation is not being executed.\r\nThe situation may worsen depending on user directory complexity, such as when nested groups are enabled and heavily used to configure space permissions and page restrictions.\r\n\r\nThe same occurs when adding or removing inline comments.\r\n\r\nh3. Environment\r\nThis issue was validated on a vanilla Confluence Server on version *6.13.3*.\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\nh5. Creating a Page Comment\r\n# Install a Confluence vanilla instance.\r\n# Create 2,000 regular users in the internal directory that are part of _confluence-users_ group.\r\n #* The following shell script may help automating that task.\r\n{code}\r\nUSRNAME=admin\r\nUSRPWD=admin\r\nCONFBASEURL=http://localhost:26133/c6133\r\n\r\nfor i in $(seq 1 2000); do\r\n NEW_USRNAME=test_user$i\r\n NEW_USR_FULLNAME=\"Test User $i\"\r\n NEW_USR_EMAIL=\"test_user\"$i\"@user.com\"\r\n NEW_USR_PWD=test_user$i\r\n\r\n curl --user $USRNAME:$USRPWD -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -H \"Accept: application/json\" -X POST -d \"{ \\\"jsonrpc\\\" : \\\"2.0\\\", \\\"method\\\" : \\\"addUser\\\", \\\"params\\\" : [{\\\"name\\\" : \\\"$NEW_USRNAME\\\", \\\"fullname\\\" : \\\"$NEW_USR_FULLNAME\\\", \\\"email\\\" : \\\"$NEW_USR_EMAIL\\\"}, \\\"$NEW_USR_PWD\\\"], \\\"id\\\": 7 }\" $CONFBASEURL/rpc/json-rpc/confluenceservice-v2?os_authType=basic >/dev/null 2>&1\r\ndone\r\n{code}\r\n# As the Confluence administrator, create a sample Blank Space -- let's call it _Test Space_.\r\n# In _Test Space_ create a sample Blank Page -- let's call it _Page with 2000 watchers_.\r\n# Add the 2,000 regular users as watchers of _Page with 2000 watchers_.\r\n #* The following shell script may help automating this task.\r\n{code}\r\nUSRNAME=admin\r\nUSRPWD=admin\r\nCONFBASEURL=http://localhost:26133/c6133\r\nPAGEID=3540960\r\n\r\n#######\r\n# Change the following with actual values\r\n# <ADD FULL COOKIE STRING>\r\n# <ATL TOKEN>\r\n#######\r\nfor i in $(seq 1 2000); do\r\nWATCHER_USRNAME=test_user$i\r\ncurl $CONFBASEURL'/json/addwatch.action' -H 'Accept: application/json, text/javascript, */*; q=0.01' -H 'Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5' -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8' -H 'X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest' -H 'Connection: keep-alive' -H 'Cookie: <ADD FULL COOKIE STRING>' -H 'Pragma: no-cache' -H 'Cache-Control: no-cache' --data 'atl_token=<ATL TOKEN>&pageId='$PAGEID'&type=page&username='$WATCHER_USRNAME >/dev/null 2>&1\r\ndone\r\n{code}\r\n# Log in to Confluence UI as a regular user and access _Page with 2000 watchers_.\r\n# Write a Page Comment and click on _Save_.\r\n\r\nh5. Expected Results\r\nThe comment is created almost instantly and the UI is released to the user to continue its work on Confluence.\r\n\r\nh5. Actual Results\r\nAfter clicking on _Save_, the operation takes a long time, giving to the user a spinning wheel in the comment editor.\r\n!create_comment_img001.png|thumbnail!\r\nEventually, the operation completes and the user perceives that by seeing the comment in the Page.\r\n!create_comment_img002.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nChecking the HAR file generated while reproducing this use case shows a {{POST}} request to {{<Confluence Base URL>/rest/tinymce/1/content/{{pageID}}/comment?actions=true}} takes too long.\r\n\r\nIf Page Profiling is enabled, then a similar entry to the following is logged in {{atlassian-confluence.log}}, but we don't have information on what is causing the long time to complete it:\r\n{code}\r\n2019-05-23 13:06:29,116 DEBUG [http-nio-26133-exec-10]

Notes\r\nThe 2,000 watchers might be an exaggerated scenario, but it is used to show that something is wrong and is causing a bad UI experience to the Confluence user.\r\nThis issue is caused because Confluence is processing notifications within the same thread as the one executing UI operations.\r\nAdding and deleting a comment to a page should be decoupled from the notifications tasks, meaning that any task related to notifications should be processed by a background thread.\r\n\r\nBelow is the result of a comparison on how long it takes to complete each action depending on the number of watchers in a page.\r\n||{{#}} of watchers||Create comment||Delete comment||\r\n|0|254ms|1,309ms|\r\n|100|1,230ms|4,301ms|\r\n|500|6,866ms|18,552ms|\r\n|1,000|14,216ms|36,892ms|\r\n|2,000|52,487ms|78,998ms|\r\n\r\nh3.

A full sync restores these users.\u00a0\r\nh3. Environment\r\n\r\nTested in Confluence 6.x that has embedded Crowd 2.10, but all Confluence versions are affected\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Create an AD connector and set it to do incremental syncs with Active Directory\r\n # During an incremental sync, the embedded Crowd within Confluence will check for all of recently changed groups.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nAny user added to a group in AD that is set to sync with Confluence would be added to the corresponding group in Confluence.\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nAny user in the group that was not modified is removed from Confluence and only the modified users are added.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe below is an example INFO message of this from the atlassian-confluence.log file:\r\n{noformat}\r\nINFO [Caesium-1-3] [atlassian.crowd.directory.DbCachingRemoteChangeOperations] removeUserMembershipsForGroup removed [ 1462 ] user members from [ GROUPNAME ] in [ 10583ms ]\r\n{noformat}\r\nh3. Notes\r\n\r\nDuring the incremental sync, for changed AD groups it will fetch their memberships. Unfortunately the embedded Crowd within Confluence will only ask for members who also were recently changed and then during the incremental sync, make them the only users existing in the local Confluence group.\u00a0The embedded Crowd in Confluence will ignore all other users who were not a part in this synchronization as they were not changed, resulting in them being removed during the sync.\u00a0\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nSet the AD connector in Confluence to do FULL syncs only by un-checking the \"Enable Incremental Synchronization\" option in the Advanced section of the AD connector's settings.\u00a0",

Summary\r\n\r\nIt would be great if there are additional custom filters for Confluence searches to let customers filter content or filters from apps in (i.e. filter by 'language' and 'version' ):\r\n\r\n !Snip20190520_7.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\nh3. Background\r\n\r\nFrom an app developer/vendor:\r\n{quote}\r\nWe would like to add custom filters for Confluence searches to let customers filter content by for example version (Scroll Versions) or language (Scroll Translations).\r\n\r\nWe have been able to create filters that users can use with the 'advanced search' view (or when directly using cql). However we have not found a (supported) way to add extra filters to the new 'quick search' available starting from Confluence 6.15.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, with Scroll Versions it is possible to have multiple versions of the content of a Confluence space, and we would want to provide a possibility to limit the search to given version.\r\n\r\nIn the advanced search, apps can add custom integrations like 'language' or 'version' (see the attached screenshot), using https://developer.atlassian.com/server/confluence/adding-a-field-to-cql/\r\n\r\n !advancedSearchIntegration.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\nBut these filters are not available in the quick search - and more \"advanced\" filters probably should not be there to keep the UI easy to use. But 'language' and 'version' are important for users of the corresponding apps.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, in the new quick search experience, all the content types are visible by default. But we would actually prefer an option to choose that some of custom content types that our apps create are by default filtered out from the quick search results (while still being searchable when users want to) - this is because some of these custom content items can be confusing for a non-power user.\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nh3. Impact\r\n\r\n* _com.k15t.scroll.scroll-versions_ has *1,385* total app installations in the market",

Suggested Solution\r\nBundle Confluence with the necessary artifacts to enable HTTP/2 out-of-the-box and provide the necessary documentation to configure this.\r\nAlso, Confluence should be fully tested to work seamlessly with HTTP/2, as well as make use of some functionalities such as _push promise_ to improve application's performance.\r\n\r\n{panel:title=Note|borderStyle=solid|borderColor=#3C78B5|titleBGColor=#3C78B5|bgColor=#E7F4FA}\r\nThere are additional Confluence architectural and design considerations that block this issue.

As such, even were APR connectors enabled with HTTP2 support, there would be little benefit compared to the provided workaround, and additional issues may arise.\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\nh3. Why this is important\r\nFull benefits of HTTP/2 can only be achieved if it is enabled all the way through the network, although you can get most of it by terminating HTTP/2 on a web server.\r\nAlso, it would be important to have HTTP/2 working when there's no web server in front of Confluence.\r\n\r\nh3.
