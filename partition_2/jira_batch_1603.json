But as soon as I add, there's a timeout right above the calendar itself and the Issue Dates never load. So I go back to Jira and enable ical 1.1 again. After that, Issue Dates are displayed on the Calendar properly.\r\n\r\nh4.Steps to Reproduce: \r\n\r\n# Install Team Calendars 4.0.3.1 in Confluence\r\n# Install Jira iCalendar plugin version 1.1 (latest one)\r\n# Create a new Calendar in Team Calendars\r\n# After created, click on \"Add Event\" option in the Calendar name (the arrow in the right side of the screen)\r\n# Try to pick an JIRA even (Jira Project Releases, in example)\r\n# You will receive a timeout error displayed in red in the \"Create Even\" screen not allowing you to proceed.",

We have created a big calendar system with about 15 different calendars. When we tried to subscribe to some of these calendars using Outlook it has been having trouble linking to the calendar. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately it seems to be different things that are causing the break in different calendars. I have one calendar called \"Private Sector Buildings\" and this subscription works fine, until I change the color of the calendar (and nothing else) and then it breaks. I have another calendar called \"Delta Cities\" and this one works fine if you change the color, but breaks if you try to edit the name of the calendar and nothing else. \r\n\r\nI have been trying to add the calendars through the Online Microsoft Portal and through Outlook 2007 and both of them have been having problems. \r\n\r\nI have been testing and have not been able to find why it is causing these problems. I cant find any one correlating thing that is causing this problem, it seems that for different calendars different things are causing this subscription break. \r\n\r\nI wish I had more information on this, but I wanted to pass on that I was having this problem.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nDaniel ",

(See attached)\r\n\r\nThis is a minor inconvenience for the user if the Start Date selected is in a later month, as the user must then advance the calendar month to the desired date. \r\n\r\nAgain, this is a very minor concern as the widget works great otherwise. It would just be convenient if the End Date calendar took the Start Date value into consideration and invoked the End Date calendar with the month specified in the Start Date field.\r\n\r\nThanks!",
