Notes\r\nTriggering a rebalance from the API *{{POST /rest/greenhopper/1.0/lexorank/balance}}* will fail on balance interrupted error.\r\n\r\nThe Following Select will identify rank values in the bad state:\r\n{code}\r\nSELECT * FROM \"AO_60DB71_LEXORANK\" left join jiraissue j on j.id = \"AO_60DB71_LEXORANK\".\"ISSUE_ID\" where j.id is NULL and \"FIELD_ID\" = <Lexorank_Field>;\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nh3.Workaround\r\n\r\n(flag) Please take AO_60DB71_LEXORANK table back up before performing delete operation\r\n(flag) Please adjust your FIELD_ID value per your environment that corresponds to RANK custom field.\r\n(flag) Make the note of limit clause we are using to determine which rank from the top has proper issue_id associated.\r\n(flag) Queries below are Postgres complaint. Please tweak it according to DB being used.\r\n\r\nNotice the stack trace above, we are trying to get the max rank and then issue key from issue that we retrieved as having max rank from AO_60DB71_LEXORANK table. Below is the translated query used behind the scene to fetch that info:\r\n\r\n{code:java}\r\nselect \"LEXORANK\".\"FIELD_ID\", \"LEXORANK\".\"ID\", \"LEXORANK\".\"ISSUE_ID\", \"LEXORANK\".\"RANK\", \"LEXORANK\".\"TYPE\", \"LEXORANK\".\"BUCKET\" from \"AO_60DB71_LEXORANK\" \"LEXORANK\"  where \"LEXORANK\".\"FIELD_ID\" = <your_Rank_FIELD_ID> and \"LEXORANK\".\"TYPE\" = 1 order by length(\"LEXORANK\".\"RANK\") desc, \"LEXORANK\".\"RANK\" desc limit 1\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nRun following query to figure if the issue_id we retrieved from above is present in the jiraissue table or not\r\n\r\n{code:java}\r\nselect * from jiraissue j2 where j2.id in (select adl.\"ISSUE_ID\" from \"AO_60DB71_LEXORANK\" adl where \r\nadl.\"FIELD_ID\"=<your_Rank_FIELD_ID> and adl.\"TYPE\"=1 order by length(adl.\"RANK\") desc, adl.\"RANK\" desc limit 1)\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nWith stack failure like above we can only get NPE if the issue_id retrieved from first query is not present in jiraissue table and hence we could not form issue object to get the issue key from. We need to keep increasing the limit in first query and correspondingly in the second query or just in the second query itself to determine which one of these descending max rank does have a valid issue_id associated(the one that exist in the jira issue table).\r\n \r\nLet's say we got 13th record from the top that gave us the issue_id which exist in the jira issue table, this determines the fact that earlier 12 records were stale and is not needed. In other words you got result for this query, while you kept on increasing the limit each time:\r\n\r\n{code:java}\r\nselect * from jiraissue j2 where j2.id in (select adl.\"ISSUE_ID\" from \"AO_60DB71_LEXORANK\" adl where \r\nadl.\"FIELD_ID\"=<your_Rank_FIELD_ID> and adl.\"TYPE\"=1 order by length(adl.\"RANK\") desc, adl.\"RANK\" desc limit 13)\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nWe need to clean up records from AO_60DB71_LEXORANK table where ISSUE_ID is not in jiraissue table(in our example it is 12 such rows from top that we need to clean up). Since we have the table back up, it is safe to run below query to clean up the records:\r\n\r\n- Stop the Servers.\r\n- Run the delete command \r\n{code:java}\r\ndelete from \"AO_60DB71_LEXORANK\" \"lr\" where \"lr\".\"ID\" in ( select \"LEXORANK\".\"ID\" from \"AO_60DB71_LEXORANK\" \"LEXORANK\"\r\nwhere \"LEXORANK\".\"FIELD_ID\" = <your_Rank_FIELD_ID> and \"LEXORANK\".\"TYPE\" = 1 order by length(\"LEXORANK\".\"RANK\") desc, \"LEXORANK\".\"RANK\" desc limit 12)\r\n{code}\r\n// *NOTE*: limit 12 is just an example here. We need to determine specifically for each environment facing this issue, what that value would be, using the second join query. Every time we do not get the result we keep increasing the limit.\r\n- Start the servers and try access the lexorank management page. The balancing section(that internally makes a call to /rest/greenhopper/1.0/lexorank/balance) should be showing up on the page.",

Jira side\r\n\r\nWe can halt Jira update for couple minutes after communication was broken for some time. However after approximately 5 minutes Jira again asks for {{remote-link-aggregation}} and everything returns back to normal. After a night with interrupted connection, Jira stopped to update dev panel. It still was requesting Crucible for updates, but those were not appearing in Development panel. Changing state of related reviews\u00a0(which produces an event) didn't help (data was not refreshed).\r\n\r\nWe suspect that it may be problem with timestamps in Jira cache.\r\nh2. Notes\r\n\r\n1) If Jira rendered some data (even if they were stale), modal with 'more details' always shows correct data. It seems this modal always fetch data from Fisheye/Crucible directly and does not rely on any cached data.\r\n\r\n2) This issue will possibly be there in multiple version of Jira, however, a good starting point will be when guaranteed delivery functionality was delivered (Jira Software 7.5.0).\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0",
