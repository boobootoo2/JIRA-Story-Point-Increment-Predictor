So it's kinda expected to not work well with Confluence 4.3.x. It'd be nice to get these information updated so one would know and not get confused when things appear to be broken all over the place.\r\n- Easy Blue Theme - https://developer.atlassian.com/download/attachments/2031799/easy-blue-theme-1.1.jar?version=1&modificationDate=1227483442846 from this page https://developer.atlassian.com/display/CONFDEV/Creating+a+Stylesheet+Theme\r\n-- Footer is missing and some styling isn't applied well. I think this is another compatibility issue as the docs and plugins were written quite long time ago, and there's been so much changes in recent Confluence interface/styling/themes since then.\r\n\r\nMaybe we can revisit these docs and ensure it will work with recent Confluence releases.

Symptoms\r\n\r\nWhen visiting a URL for an attachment that does not exist, the server returns a response that the browser cannot handle.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, the 404 response contains the \"Content-Encoding: gzip\" header, but the response body is not actually gzip-encoded. The browser fails to render the 404 page and instead renders its own error message complaining about bad encoding. This also appears to affect 500 responses.\r\n\r\nThis can be reproduced with Chrome, Safari and Firefox. See attactment for a screenshot from Firefox.\r\n\r\nAn example URL to trigger this is\r\n\r\nhttp://localhost:8080/confluence/download/attachments/INVALIDNUMBER/43434/test.txt\r\n\r\nIt would appear that this only happens when going directly to Confluence. If a proxy server sits in between, it seems to massage the response to fix the inconsistent encoding.\r\n\r\nh4.

Currently only small amount of content is displayed and user cannot even see to what paragraph (under which heading) it belongs to.\r\n\r\nCONF-6445 suggested that amount of context could be configurable (In 4.3.2 I did not find the option) - that would be really good solution. \r\nAnother option would be to add a link that would show full page with diffs (it could be extra selection under view button for example).",

      "description": "{panel:bgColor=#e7f4fa}\n  *NOTE:* This bug report is for *Confluence Server*. Using *Confluence Cloud*? [See the corresponding bug report|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFCLOUD-27294].\n  {panel}\n\nWebWork supports the concept of action aliases, which allow a single action class to serve requests mapping to different names. This allows a developer to reuse the same action logic, but provide different results based on interceptors. When an action is invoked, Webwork will typically call its execute() method, but this behavior can be modified in either xwork.xml or from a URL of the form +\u201c/dosomething!method.action\u201d+.\r\n\r\nTwo interceptor stacks that are of particular interest to Confluence: \r\n* {{defaultStack}} \u2013 Provides all the basic interceptors such as transactions, params, and autowiring.\r\n* {{validatingStack}} \u2013 Extends {{defaultStack}} with some additional security filters ({{ConfluenceXsrfTokenInterceptor}}, {{ConfluenceWorkflowInterceptor}}).\r\n\r\nTo make use of features like XSRF and framework validation, an Action is configured in xwork.xml with a reference to {{validatingStack}}. In cases where this protection is not needed, they are configured to reference {{defaultStack}}.\r\n\r\n*A security issues exists when aliases use different interceptor stacks for the same Action*. By submitting requests to an Action using the {{defaultStack}}, an attacker can bypass XSRF and validation protections the {{validatingStack}} would provide.\r\n\r\nA case study of this vulnerability is {{ChangeMyPasswordAction}}, defined in xwork.xml as follows:\r\n\r\n{code:xml} \r\n<package name=\"users\" extends=\"default\" namespace=\"/users\">\r\n    <default-interceptor-ref name=\"validatingStack\"/>\r\n...\r\n    <action name=\"changemypassword\" class=\"com.atlassian.confluence.user.actions.ChangeMyPasswordAction\" method=\"doDefault\">\r\n        <interceptor-ref name=\"defaultStack\"/>\r\n        <result name=\"input\" type=\"velocity\">/users/changemypassword.vm</result>\r\n        <result name=\"error\" type=\"velocity\">/users/changemypassword.vm</result>\r\n        <result name=\"success\" type=\"velocity\">/users/changemypassword.vm</result>\r\n    </action>\r\n\r\n    <action name=\"dochangemypassword\" class=\"com.atlassian.confluence.user.actions.ChangeMyPasswordAction\">\r\n        <param name=\"RequireSecurityToken\">true</param>\r\n        <result name=\"input\" type=\"velocity\">/users/changemypassword.vm</result>\r\n        <result name=\"error\" type=\"velocity\">/users/changemypassword.vm</result>\r\n        <result name=\"cancel\" type=\"redirect\">viewmyprofile.action</result>\r\n        <result name=\"success\" type=\"velocity\">/users/changemypasswordsuccessful.vm</result>\r\n    </action>\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nTwo aliases have been configured for the {{ChangeMyPasswordAction}} action. The \u201cchangemypassword\u201d alias will use the {{defaultStack}}, which offers no additional security features, while the \u201cdochangemypassword\u201d alias will use the {{validatingStack}}, which provides XSRF and framework validation features.\r\n\r\nThe action itself is written as follows:\r\n\r\n{code:title=ChangeMyPasswordAction.java|borderStyle=solid}\r\npublic class ChangeMyPasswordAction extends AbstractUserProfileAction implements FormAware\r\n{\r\n  private String currentPassword;\r\n  private String newPassword;\r\n  private String newPasswordConfirmation;\r\n...\r\n  public void validate()\r\n  {\r\n    if (!userAccessor.authenticate(getUser().getName(), currentPassword))\r\n    {\r\n      addActionError(getText(\"cur.pass.not.correct\"));\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  public String execute() throws Exception\r\n  {\r\n    try\r\n    {\r\n      userAccessor.alterPassword(getUser(),newPassword);\r\n...\r\n    return \r\n{code}\r\n\r\nWhen invoked through normal means, the \u201cchangemypassword\u201d action will execute {{doDefault}}, which simply renders the appropriate Velocity template for changing a user\u2019s password. When the form is submitted, the \u201cdochangemypassword\u201d action is executed, which verifies XSRF tokens and validates the current password field is correct before changing a users password.\r\n\r\nAn attacker can exploit this action by submitting a request to \u201cchangemypassword\u201d, but explicitly specifying the method to be executed in the URL. In this case, if they specify a URL like http://website.com/confluence/users/changemypassword!execute.action?newPassword=hacked&newPasswordConfirmation=hacked, then XSRF and current password validation will be bypassed.\r\n\r\nThis is a good example for demonstrating the two disadvantages in bypassing the {{validatingStack}}:\r\n* An attacker can now conduct XSRF attacks against all Actions that should have been protected.\r\n* An attacker can bypass any framework validation that is supposed to provide security and authorization checks.\r\n\r\nThe simplist way to mitigate this vulnerability is to remove the \"!method\" syntax support for invoking actions in Webwork.",

Gliffy\r\nThe installed Gliffy version 4.5.7 on our production system runs fine.\r\n\r\nHowever, on our cloned development machine, when I uninstall Gliffy 4.5.7 and reinstall the same Gliffy version 4.5.7, Gliffy is not launched when I try to insert a Gliffy macro - instead the standard Confluence macro dialog appears (see attached screenshot). Of course, uninstalling Gliffy 4.5.7 and installing Gliffy 5.0 doesn't work, too (this has initially alerted me of this issue).\r\n\r\nI've been in contact with the Gliffy Support Desk (#34009). \r\nThey have confirmed the issue: A custom built Gliffy snapshot that uses AJS.toInit() instead of AJS.bind('init.rte', func...) does launch the Gliffy dialog on our development machine. The Gliffy developer has asked me to open a ticket with Atlassian.\r\n\r\nh5. Custom JavaScript\r\nOn the same note, when I add JavaScript via custom HTML to the head \r\n\r\n{code}\r\n <script type=\"text/javascript\">\r\n(function($) {\r\nAJS.toInit(function() {\r\n$('#notifyWatchers').attr('checked', false);\r\nalert('Test!');\r\n...\r\n{code}\r\n\r\ndoes work but\r\n\r\n{code}\r\n...\r\n(function($) {\r\nAJS.bind('init.rte', function() {\r\n...\r\n{code}\r\n\r\ndoes not (not unchecking the checkbox or even raising the alert box).\r\n\r\nThis affects all current browsers: Firefox 16, IE 9, Chrome 23\r\n\r\nh5. Other add-ons affected\r\nThese add-ons that most likely use the bind method don't work, too:\r\n\r\n- Confluence Source Editor 1.0.6: The <> icon doesn't even show up in the editor\r\n- Confluence Quick Comments Plug-in: \"Error loading the comment editor. Timeout while waiting for the editor resources to load\"\r\n\r\nh5. Not working solutions\r\nThese steps did not help:\r\n\r\n- Making sure that with the add-ons affected all modules are enabled\r\n- Clearing the plug-ins cache as described in https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/CONFKB/How+to+Clear+Confluence+Plugins+Cache\r\n- Enabling safe mode and only re-enabling one affected custom plug-in at a time: Gliffy 4.5.7; Gliffy 5.0 or the Confluence Source Editor.\r\n\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nFrank",
