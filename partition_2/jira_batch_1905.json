That requires external users having user-level access to our Confluence installation. External people having an account could currenty be done by either\r\n* self-subscribing, or\r\n* managing external users in our universities LDAP server.\r\n\r\nActivating self-subsription in Concluence means, anyone in the world can be a member of our enterprises' communication system, which is not acceptable. Managing external users in LDAP is also not a viable way.\r\n\r\nInstead, it would be a GOOD THING to have, if members of the organization would be enabled to explicitly invite other non-organization people to Confluence.  Those new members would receive an invitation email with a link to approve the membership, and only those invited people would become members of the Confluence installation. \r\n\r\nIn addition, it would be required for the new account to follow a (configurable, e.g. by specifying a regular expression to match) user name pattern to not conflict with the delegated user database.\r\n\r\nIt could also be helpful, if this invitation right would be a dedicated right assignable by LDAP for a group of users, but probably not all.\r\n\r\nA first implementation hint for a plugin comes from the Atlassian support (thanks guys!):\r\n\r\n- an 'enter new invitation' XWork action with Web UI module, which...\r\n- records the invitee's email address together with a secret value in Bandana, and...\r\n- sends an email to the invitee with a link to...\r\n- an 'accept invitation' XWork action, which...\r\n- validates the secret value in the URL against Bandana, and...\r\n- adds the new user to Confluence with details they provide. \r\n\r\nThis is a feature common in other CMS and similar systems and would be a major improvement for Confluence, the Enterprise wiki.",

      "description": "When using the WML editor, it is easy to create a link but just adding the bracket around the link.  It is very easy to do this and it is one of the strengths of wikis.   Unfortunately, doing the same thing in the WYSIWYG editor requires about four or five clicks and a copy and paste etc.     This is one of the few operations that is much slower in the WYSIWYG editor, but unfortunately I think it is one of the most critical.\r\n\r\nHere are a couple of solutions:\r\n    1) Add a new button to the WYSIWYG tool bar that does the job for us.   I would like to be able to hightlight a word or phrase and then just click on the 'quick link' button to make the hightlighted text turn in to a link.  A short cut key would be nice too.\r\n    2) Modify the 'Link Properties' dialog box so  the highlighted text in the 'Link' field is prepopulated in the same was as the 'Alias' field.     Note it would be fantastic if the 'Search' field was prepopulated with the same text so I could see if the page already exists.   Creating a link to a page that unexpectedly exists is a special 'wiki moment' that puts a smile on people faces when they realise someone has already done their work before them!\r\n\r\n\r\nI really think that this would improve the usage of the WYSIWYG enormously for a very small development cost.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nJames.",

      "description": "Currently I can add a web-item to system.page to add a new tab (e.g. Translate). I have have that web-item link to my action and have the velocity output contain the following:\r\n\r\n#applyDecorator(\"root\")\r\n    #decoratorParam(\"helper\" $action.helper)\r\n    #decoratorParam(\"mode\" \"translate\")\r\n    #decoratorParam(\"context\" \"page\")\r\n\r\nThe problem is that the page.vmd is hardwired to understand certain modes (view, edit, attachments, info) and it doesnt have a catch-all \"else\" to just dump the contents of $body out. It just drops the body out completely - a similar thing happens in the space.vmd too.\r\n\r\nTo make things worse, the \"current\" tab is selected based on matching $mode against the $item.key - so even if I surrender to rendering in page mode (and getting last edited by, favourites & comments - which I dont want) it means that the page tab will still be selected regardless!\r\n\r\nThe solution to this would be to take:\r\n\r\n                    ## ATTACHMENTS\r\n                    #elseif ($mode == \"view-attachments\" || $mode == \"move-attachments\")\r\n                        $body\r\n                    #end\r\n\r\nand have \r\n\r\n                    ## ATTACHMENTS\r\n                    #elseif ($mode == \"view-attachments\" || $mode == \"move-attachments\")\r\n                        $body\r\n\r\n                    ## CATCH ALL\r\n                    #elseif \r\n                        $body\r\n                    #end\r\n\r\nInstead - do similar for space.vmd, but that needs both the $context and the various $mode if's in them having the catch all's applied. There may be other areas across the decorators which suffer the same limitation.\r\n\r\nWith this extension I can actually start to use web-item's for page and space tabs in plugins!",

I'll be marking this issue as \"Won't Fix\".\r\n\r\nWe also [have partners that can help you customise Confluence|http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/APW/] that could help you with a one-off/ad-hoc custom work if needed.\r\nSherif Mansour\r\nConfluence Product Management\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\n",
