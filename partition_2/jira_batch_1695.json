However, often knowledge spreads over external links which are embedded throughout a page. But since there is no control over external content, knowledge might become spotty if the external content happens to vanish.\r\n\r\nI'd like to propose an option where external links in a page are automatically detected and its contend archived within Confluence. Of course this would have to be restricted to some degree since mirroring entire sites is no fun for anyone. It does not have to be perfect. Even a shabby and badly formatted .pdf version of the external content (depth == 1) would suffice. Because if important content is missing, I'd rather have a badly formatted copy instead of nothing.",

However, one thing that always bugs me is that I need to use the mouse to bring up the macro editor for a selected macro.\r\n\r\nProposal:\r\nALT+SPACE Could bring up the list of actions for a given macro (normally Edit/Remove). Then I need to be able to move in this list using TAB/SHIFT+TAB. A Following ENTER would execute the action. This behavior would be especially useful for macros defining their own action (status, team calendar etc.)\r\n\r\nALT+ENTER would instantly do the default action. In almost all cases this is bringing up the macro editor.\r\n\r\nIn normal cases this behavior would be enabled when the macro is 'text'-selected. One option to think about would be to also extend this behavior to the macro directly following the text cursor. Would remove the need to first SHIFT+ARROW the macro.\r\n\r\nPlease have a heart for our keyboard loving users and make it happen. thx!",

Create a new space with Default theme and Global colour scheme.\r\n\r\n2. Change theme, eg. to Atlassian\u2019s Documentation theme or in our case, to our own custom theme. Global Colour Scheme has been replaced by either Theme Colour Scheme (Documentation theme) or Custom Colour Scheme (own custom theme).\r\n\r\n3. Switch back to Default theme. The colour scheme won\u2019t revert back to Global Colour scheme but stays the same as after previous step.\r\n\r\nI think it\u2019s not a bug in a theme, since it doesn\u2019t matter if the other theme is Atlassian\u2019s Documentation Theme or our own custom theme. \r\n\r\nThis is not a major issue, but could be very confusing if individual space admins will just want to try a different theme for a moment but want to change back to original.

A lot of these decisions can take time to make. To encourage people to keep on top of them I send out an E-mail on a regular basis, but it would be ideal if this was automated.\r\n\r\nI am guessing the nature of a decision register page means it is not particularly structured, i.e. it is just a regular page with some pre-selected markup? A temporary workaround could be to use the REST API I guess to pull this info out, I just don't know if there would be anything that would distinguish a decision register page from any other page.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nMichael",

We have made a fix and published a new version for it (1.0-incubating-atlassian-20) that solves the problem.\r\n\r\nAny product that uses atlassian-gadgets to render gadgets is vulnerable to this, and Confluence is one of those.\r\n\r\nYou would need to check your current version of atlassian-gadgets and see which version of apache shindig is using. Anything lower than 1.0-incubating-atlassian-20 would make Confluence vulnerable to this attack.\r\n\r\nThe fix is quite easy, just bump the version of shindig on the version of gadgets that you are using. Then release a new version of gadgets and bump the version on Confluence to pick up the fix.\r\n\r\nIf you need any details, ping me @jsanchez.",

A common convention has been to provide the ability to indicate in some convenient manner, when defining the link, that it should open in a new browser page without closing the one that the link is presented in.

Especially so if we've taken the additional effort to customize the link text associated with the people link. It's particularly jarring that the additional {{.user-mention}} styling does not appear when editing - or even previewing - the page. \r\n\r\nThe only two workarounds are to circumvent the user mention system entirely (using a web link to the user's space) or to override the {{.user-mention}} CSS (however, the CSS has no distinction between customized and uncustomized link text).\r\n\r\n",
