      "description": "{panel:title=Atlassian Update - March 2018|borderStyle=solid|borderColor=#3C78B5|titleBGColor=#3C78B5|bgColor=#E7F4FA}\r\nThe fix for this issue released in 6.8.0 will prevent links to images (and view attachment macros) from being corrupted after a change in the Confluence baseURL.\r\n\r\nHowever, if there are any existing link corruptions that occurred prior to upgrading to 6.8.0, those corruptions will remain, and the only way to fix is to either revert to a published version of a page without such corruptions, or discard the draft (if the corruption is only in the draft).\r\n\r\nI have created an issue to track a fix on the already corrupted links: CONFSERVER-55249\r\n{panel}\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\u00a0\r\n # Set up an instance with no context path, eg [http://localhost:8090/]\r\n # Create a page and add some images, attachments and user mentions to it\r\n -- Confirm it displays ok\r\n # Shut down Confluence and set a context path, eg [http://localhost:8090/confluence]\r\n # Restart and update the base URL in Confluence Admin > General Configurations\r\n # view the page\r\n -- Observe that the images are still ok\r\n # Edit the page\r\n -- Observe that the images are broken in edit mode\r\n # Type some text and save\r\n -- Observe that the images are still broken\r\n\r\nThis is likely happening because Synchrony \"saved\" the links with the old BaseURL, and then when the BaseURL changed, those changes aren't propagated into Synchrony (because it's saving the editor format).\r\nh3. Workaround\r\nh5. Turn Collaborative Editing Off and back On (recommended)\r\n\r\nIt has been confirmed that *turning Synchrony Off and On* again resolves the related issue with links in --CONFSERVER-52455--. It is unclear if this applies to the image issue as well.\r\n\r\n!https://jira.atlassian.com/images/icons/emoticons/warning.png|width=16,height=16! \u00a0\u00a0All existing shared drafts are lost when you switch\u00a0collaborative editing off, so make sure your users have published any work they want to keep before you make the change.\r\n # Go to  !https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/files/590259974/590058056/1/1398739558493/Cog.png! > *General Configuration* > *Collaborative editing*\r\n # Click *Change mode*\r\n # Select *Off*\r\n # Click *Change*\r\n # Then turn Synchrony back on\r\n # Then [rebuild the index|https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/content-index-administration-148844.html#ContentIndexAdministration-Rebuildingthesearchindex] via the UI\r\n # The issue will stop occurring but you will need to go back and manually restore any pages that were affected\r\n## You can restore the page to an older version\r\n## Or you can manually adjust the links\r\n\r\nh5. Note about this workaround\r\nWhen Collaborative Editing is enabled, and a page is being edited, all those small changes are stored in Synchrony in-memory cache/events table on the database. That includes the base URL. \r\nWhen the base URL got changed in Confluence, Synchrony won't be aware of this change. When turning off Collaborative Editing, you discard all the data that Synchrony had and when enabling again, you are forcing to fetch a new copy of the base URL from Confluence. That's how turning it off and on again helps workaround this issue\r\n\r\nh5. Turn Collaborative Editing Off Entirely (not recommended)\r\n\r\n!https://jira.atlassian.com/images/icons/emoticons/warning.png|width=16,height=16! \u00a0 All existing shared drafts are lost when you switch\u00a0collaborative editing off, so make sure your users have published any work they want to keep before you make the change.\r\n # Go to  !https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/files/590259974/590058056/1/1398739558493/Cog.png! > *General Configuration* > *Collaborative editing*\r\n # Click *Change mode*\r\n # Select *Off*\r\n # Click *Change*\r\n # Then [rebuild the index|https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/content-index-administration-148844.html#ContentIndexAdministration-Rebuildingthesearchindex] via the UI\r\n # The issue will stop occurring but you will need to go back and manually restore any pages that were affected\r\n## You can restore the page to an older version\r\n## Or you can manually adjust the links\r\n\r\n(i) More information can be found in [Administering Collaborative editing|https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/administering-collaborative-editing-858772086.html].\r\n\r\nIf turning off Collaborative Editing is not an option or the affected area is not too big for the instance, there is a workaround that can be applied to a page to fix it on a page to page \r\nbasis:\r\n# Edit the affected page that has either _User Mention_ or _Attachment Link_ in it\r\n# Save the page without making any changes (this would break the page due to this bug)\r\n# Revert the page back to the history of 1 version before the current broken version (the version that has all the user mentions and attachment links still intact)\r\n\r\nNow that the page has been _affected_ once, any edits after this will not cause the user mentions or attachment links to change again.\r\n\r\n",

Suggested Solution\r\nFrom our guide on [Configuring Synchrony for Data Center|https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/configuring-synchrony-for-data-center-858772125.html/], the following properties default to either localhost or 127.0.0.1\r\n{code}\r\n-Dsynchrony.cluster.bind\r\n-Dsynchrony.bind\r\n-Dcluster.interfaces\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nIf we could set them to default to the server's IP, or leave them as a blank default setting for data center/cluster installations, then this could make the setup easier for clustered instances. Normally our customers [following this guide|https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/installing-confluence-data-center-203603.html] will set up a Synchrony cluster, where these properties have to be set explicitly on startup. A synchrony service setup guide would be helpful for this as well: [CONF-51792|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONF-51792]. \r\n \r\nh3. Workaround \r\nSet them manually",

Problem Definition\r\n\r\nIn Team Calendars, users can drag and drop events from one date to another. However, it's not possible to select multiple events and move them together by the same offset.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n\r\n\r\nEnable the ability to select multiple events at once and move them together. \r\nFor example, you have an \"event A\" from day 20-23 and the \"event B\" from day 21-26. If was possible to select them together and move them over 1 day, the result would be the \"event A\" from 21-24 and \"event B\" from 22-27\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\nh3. Why this is important\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is important because some users need to reorganize multiple event dates, and it's only possible to drag the events one by one.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\n\r\nNone",

The ultimate parent page will be thrown into a continuously refreshing loop, and we are unable to stop the loop from occurring without forcing the browser to stop.\r\nh4. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Create a new Confluence 6.0.6 instance\r\n # Add the demo site content and a local admin account\r\n # Import the attached Space Export [^se2.zip] into the newly created Confluence 6.0.6 site\r\n # Perform a Content Indexing administration for the site\r\n # Navigate to <yourConfleunceURL>/display/TS2/Page+Properties+testing\r\n # Observe the page in a\u00a0*continuous loop*\u00a0as the Page Properties report in a grandchild page has a JIRA issues gadget in the report\r\n # Observe that you can not stop the page from looping by clicking links, the back button or other methods\r\n # Quit your browser\r\n # Reopen your browser\r\n # Go to <yourConfluenceURL>/display/TS2/Summary+of+BLUE+Child+Pages\r\n # Remove the JIRA Gadget in the report for\u00a0*Blue page 1, with JIRA Gadget*\r\n # Navigate back to <yourConfleunceURL>/display/TS2/Page+Properties+testing\r\n # Observe that the page looping is no longer present\r\n\r\nh4. Expected Results\r\n\r\nPage Properties reports would display without issue and the page would render normally.\r\nh4. Actual Results\r\n\r\nPage becomes stuck in a loop, and continues to attempt to render the reports - refreshing the page continuously and appending to the page URL with each attempt. The only way to stop the rendering is to force the browser to stop the attempt by manual intervention.\u00a0\r\nh4. Workaround\r\n\r\nThe only workaround at present is to insure that JIRA macros are only embedded at the Child Page level and\u00a0*no*\u00a0*deeper*\u00a0than the child level, or the looping will occur.\u00a0",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFCLOUD-51952].\n  {panel}\n\nA part of my team are updating a wiki page when they are working on something not relevant to me. I am getting spammed down by email from Confluence whenever they update the page.\r\n I would normally tell them to uncheck \"Notify watchers\" when updating, but they need to notify each other. So I've tried to just unwatch that specific page. But Confluence won't let me! I can only unwatch it if I unwatch the entire space as well, which is not what I want, because I need to be informed about other updates to the space. I just don't want all the Confluence spam resulting from edits to that page.\r\n\r\nSo please let me uncheck the \"Watch this page\" option, which is currently just giving me:\r\n \"You will receive updates for this page because you are watching this space\"\r\n\r\nI want to simply unwatch a specific page, but keep watching the rest of the space. Is that too much to ask for?",

      "description": "h3. Summary\r\nThere are two *different* symptoms for this problem, but both go back to the same root cause.\r\n\r\nh5. Scenario 1\r\nWhen a page is updated and needs to be indexed, the indexer does not add the attachments, comments and permissions into the journal table. This will overload the hibernate session, where it will pick up items from the journal table. These items will introduce more work on the indexer than expected, where it will need to process all the attachments, comments and permissions of the current page. From the user perspective, it will look like the indexer stalls and slow at processing a small number of tasks\r\n\u00a0\r\nh5. Scenario 2\r\nWhen a page is updated multiple times and those changes are included in a single indexer batch, the indexer does not handle this efficiently. It will index those changes with every change.\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\nReproducing this behavior for Scenario 2 will require multiple quick updates to a certain page (within 5 seconds.) \r\n *Hint:* This can be done through rest api\r\n # Create a new page\r\n # Add multiple attachments to the page (preferably large attachments)\r\n # Edit the page and save\r\n # Edit the page again and save\r\n # Edit the page a third time and save\r\n # Enable DEBUG logging for the package\r\n{code:java}\r\ncom.atlassian.confluence.search.lucene.DefaultConfluenceIndexManager\r\n{code}\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nThe indexer will show that it is processing the page along with all the attachments, comments and permission efficiently. \r\nThe page should be processed *only once* in a single batch.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nThe indexer will show that it is processing a single page only while it is actually processing page, attachments, comment and permissions. Also the indexer will process each change separately, redoing all the work again.\r\nThis is very time and resource consuming and will cause the indexer to stall or lead to an outage\r\n\r\n\r\nLarge attachments can affect the processing time as well. Below is the log snippet of the behavior for *Scenario 1*\r\n{code:borderStyle=solid}\r\n2017-03-21 11:15:03,887 DEBUG [scheduler_Worker-4] [confluence.search.lucene.DefaultConfluenceIndexManager] flushQueue Flushed 291 items in 43881 milliseconds\r\n2017-03-21 11:14:20,006 DEBUG [scheduler_Worker-4] [confluence.search.lucene.DefaultConfluenceIndexManager] flushQueue flush requested\r\n2017-03-21 11:14:16,240 DEBUG [scheduler_Worker-1] [confluence.search.lucene.DefaultConfluenceIndexManager] flushQueue Flushed 2338 items in 276234 milliseconds\r\n2017-03-21 11:09:40,005 DEBUG [scheduler_Worker-1] [confluence.search.lucene.DefaultConfluenceIndexManager] flushQueue flush requested\r\n2017-03-21 11:09:36,402 DEBUG [scheduler_Worker-2] [confluence.search.lucene.DefaultConfluenceIndexManager] flushQueue Flushed 1527 items in 466396 milliseconds\r\n2017-03-21 11:01:50,006 DEBUG [scheduler_Worker-2] [confluence.search.lucene.DefaultConfluenceIndexManager] flushQueue flush requested\r\n2017-03-21 11:01:47,935 DEBUG [scheduler_Worker-1] [confluence.search.lucene.DefaultConfluenceIndexManager] flushQueue Flushed 1778 items in 667844 milliseconds\r\n2017-03-21 10:50:40,091 DEBUG [scheduler_Worker-1] [confluence.search.lucene.DefaultConfluenceIndexManager] flushQueue flush requested\r\n2017-03-21 10:50:36,342 DEBUG [scheduler_Worker-6] [confluence.search.lucene.DefaultConfluenceIndexManager] flushQueue Flushed 869 items in 26337 milliseconds\r\n2017-03-21 10:50:10,004 DEBUG [scheduler_Worker-6] [confluence.search.lucene.DefaultConfluenceIndexManager] flushQueue flush requested\r\n....\r\n2017-03-21 10:48:02,290 DEBUG [scheduler_Worker-4] [confluence.search.lucene.DefaultConfluenceIndexManager] flushQueue Flushed 6 items in 2285 milliseconds\r\n2017-03-21 10:48:00,005 DEBUG [scheduler_Worker-4] [confluence.search.lucene.DefaultConfluenceIndexManager] flushQueue flush requested\r\n....\r\n2017-03-21 10:36:50,333 DEBUG [scheduler_Worker-4] [confluence.search.lucene.DefaultConfluenceIndexManager] flushQueue Flushed 4 items in 10325 milliseconds\r\n2017-03-21 10:36:40,007 DEBUG [scheduler_Worker-4] [confluence.search.lucene.DefaultConfluenceIndexManager] flushQueue flush requested\r\n....\r\n2017-03-21 10:34:58,947 DEBUG [scheduler_Worker-9] [confluence.search.lucene.DefaultConfluenceIndexManager] flushQueue Flushed 157 items in 3942 milliseconds\r\n2017-03-21 10:34:55,005 DEBUG [scheduler_Worker-9] [confluence.search.lucene.DefaultConfluenceIndexManager] flushQueue flush requested\r\n{code}\r\n\r\n\r\nh3.

Problem Definition\r\nCurrently in the Confluence Audit Log, there is no way to filter which items appear in the logs. Since we added User Management changes to the Audit Log in CONF-6960, a filtering option should be made available. \r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\nProvide a filtering option for the audit log, much like what JIRA has, that would allow administrators to select which actions should be logged in the audit. Please see below for an example: \r\n!audit_log_filter.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nh3. Why this is important\r\nThe inability to filter actions in the audit log can have some negative impacts. For example, administrators will sync over their external user directories from LDAP or Crowd and the sync results in thousands of entries in the Audit Log, sometimes even millions of entries. \r\n\r\nThis makes it difficult to see unique actions logged in the audit because the logs are flooded with entries from the sync.

These notifications are sent over SMTP unencrypted (and are therefore insecure). If a page contains commercially sensitive information, we need a mechanism for inhibiting SMTP messages being sent for that page. We don't wish to enforce this at SPACE or SITE level because that would remove the usefulness of notifications. Could we suggest that the \"Watching\" functionality be enhanced such that a user can disable notifications for page content on sensitive pages, and once disabled, only a site administrator can re-enable.\r\n\r\nWithout this we cannot use Confluence for a proportion of our use-cases, and we risk the termination of Confluence as a supported platform for ISO27001 compliant work.",

This is indeed a great heuristics and often contains the page that I want to link to.\r\n\r\nHowever, as soon as a second key is pressed, a different algorithm kicks in, often causing the recently edited pages to be removed from the suggestions list - _even if they match the characters just entered_.\r\n\r\nThis is incredibly annoying to me because it punishes me for typing too much, especially in combination with the delays naturally occurring in that flow (while Confluence is building up the lists). For example, when I insert a link by typing '[' + a few letters of its title, I can see the desired page appearing in the list and, as soon as I try to select it, have it disappear again :(\r\n\r\nI suggest tweaking the algorithm so that matching items in the list of recently edited pages are ranked higher than other items.

Problem Definition\r\n\r\nThe suggestion come up due to a request from our customer, where he complains that using a macro to delete the files every 30 days is unsafe. Since if you delete 1 hour before the job runs or three days, is the same.\r\n\u00a0\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nThe suggestion is to set a date for every file, for example, if I move a file to trash bin today it will only be deleted after 30 days, meaning that every file has its own count\r\nh3. Why this is important\r\n\r\nIt's important to prevent wrong deletions and mistakes within trash bin\r\nh3. Workaround\u00a0\r\n\r\nNo workaround yet.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFCLOUD-51846].\r\n  {panel}\r\n\r\nh3. Problem Definition\r\nConfluence Data Center requires running synchrony in a separate cluster. Synchrony is a Java application, but doesn't implement ServiceMain, so it can't be run as a *Windows* service natively.\r\n\r\nTherefore, Synchrony cannot be run out of the box as a Windows service and requires manually starting and stopping via the {{start-synchrony.bat}} and {{stop-synchrony.bat}} scripts.\r\n\r\nThere is a note in [Configuring Synchrony For Data Center|https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/configuring-synchrony-for-data-center-858772125.html] regarding this issue:\r\n{quote}\r\nIt's currently not possible to run Synchrony as a service on Windows.  \r\n{quote}\r\n\r\n(i) Synchrony *does support* running as a *linux* service, natively: \r\n* [Run Synchrony Standalone As A Service On Linux|https://confluence.atlassian.com/confkb/run-synchrony-standalone-as-a-service-on-linux-933081078.html] (for 6.5 and newer)\r\n* [Run Synchrony Standalone As A Service On Linux For Confluence 6.4 And Earlier|https://confluence.atlassian.com/confkb/run-synchrony-standalone-as-a-service-on-linux-for-confluence-6-4-and-earlier-939504670.html]\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\nProvide out-of-the-box ability to run Synchrony as a Windows service for Enterprise customers.\r\n\r\nh3. Why this is important\r\n# Enterprise customers cannot rely on manually running scripts or developing their own service scripts to run Synchrony. \r\n# [Windows is a supported platform|https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/supported-platforms-207488198.html] for Confluence Data Center. \r\n\r\nh3. Workaround \r\n# Run just Synchrony on a linux node (assuming the rest of the cluster is on Windows) using the instructions linked above.\r\n# [Use 3rd party tools|http://stackoverflow.com/questions/68113/how-to-create-a-windows-service-from-java-app] to run Synchrony on Windows\r\n",

      "description": "h3. Summary\r\n\r\nCreating table element on Confluence page and then trying to get value field\u00a0from REST API from the same page will result in additional div element around the\u00a0table. And classes\u00a0for table and td beeing changed.\r\n\r\nBecause of this behavior (additional div around the table and changing classes), multiple updates of the page trough REST API, with the same content, will cause an additional version of the page with no difference. If you would fire the PUT (update of the page) 10 times you would get 10 versions of the page. For comparison, if you update a page without the table in the body (value will stay same), the version will stay same, no matter how many PUT calls you make.\r\nh3. Environment\r\n * Java\u00a01.8.0_111\r\n * H2 database\r\n * Centos 7\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Create simple table element on page XXXX in source editor like this or by creating it with POST REST API:\r\n{code:java}\r\n<table class=\"wrapped\">\r\n<colgroup> <col/> </colgroup>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>123</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n{code}\r\n\r\n # When you try to get the\u00a0content of *value*\u00a0*attribute* from the page by reaching it trough REST API and URL\u00a0like this \"GET [http://confluence:8090/rest/api/content/XXXX?expand=body.view|http://taranaki:8090/rest/api/content/65583?expand=body.view]\"\u00a0you will get additional HTML element around the actual table in response value and additional classes on table and TD elements:\r\n{code:java}\r\n<div class=\"table-wrap\">\r\n<table class=\"confluenceTable\">\r\n<colgroup> <col/> </colgroup>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td class=\"confluenceTd\">123</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>\r\n\u00a0{code}\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nTrying to get *value field* trough REST API, you will get this response:\r\n{code:java}\r\n<table class=\"wrapped\">\r\n<colgroup> <col/> </colgroup>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>123</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n{code}\r\nh3. Note\r\n\r\nUpdating the content of the page (without the\u00a0table and lorem ipsum text) in UI with the\u00a0same content will cause a\u00a0new version of the page if you repeat that process with REST API version will not change and they should be same.\u00a0\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nNo known workaround at the moment.",
