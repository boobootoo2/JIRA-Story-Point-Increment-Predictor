We have organised several spaces in Confluence. Each space belongs to particular topic like UI Development, CMS Development, Component Library, System Integration, .etc. \r\n \r\nThough, we need to classify all pages in all spaces against global categories (category is represented as list of attributes), for example: Skills = { .NET, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery}; Platform = { Linux, Windows, Android, iOS }; Programming Language = { C#, C++, VB }; .etc.\r\n \r\nSo we would like to have an ability to specify multiple category attributes for any page in any space. So, for example, the page could be associated with Skills = { CSS, jQuery}; Platform = { Windows }; Programming Language = { C#, VB };\r\n\r\nIt also needs to be user friendly so Confluence content editors could use specify each category attributes in the similar manner in which labels are currently specified in Confluence. Though, instead of adding attributes in bulk, to a single labels list, the attributes should be added to the corresponding category. \r\n\r\nIn addition, all exiting categories attributes mus be available in all spaces and should be globally searchable.\r\n\r\nIt would be extremely handy  to have some features in Confluence to support this scenario. \r\n\r\nE.g.: if it would be JIRA we would just add new multi-select fields for each category, with a pre-defined number of attributes, which can be selected for this category",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFCLOUD-30644].\r\n{panel}\r\nh3. Problem Definition\r\n\r\nThe space owner, cannot manager users watching all blog posts in their space.\r\n\r\nSpace owner can only manage watchers of specific pages/blog posts in that space.\r\n\r\nMany users only watch the blog for keeping up with the news in the space and not the actual content.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n We have a JIRA space in our Confluence instance. This space contains all system and operational documentation of our JIRA instance. Information not so interesting to the organization. However, the blog in the JIRA space is used for information about upgrades, new features, downtime etc. This is very interesting to the users. Therefore the users only watch the blog of the space and not the space itself.\u00a0\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nAdd the ability for the space owner to manage all blog watchers.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n{panel:title=Atlassian Status as of November 2018|borderStyle=solid|borderColor=#3c78b5|titleBGColor=#3c78b5|bgColor=#e7f4fa}\r\nHi all,\r\n\r\nThank you for all voting and commenting on this feature.\r\n\r\nWe fully understand and appreciate the need to manage blog watchers. As you\u2019ll be aware, within Confluence we already have the ability to manage page watchers \u2013 managing blog watchers is the logical next step.\r\n\r\nThis is something we\u2019d ideally like to implement in the future, but it's not currently on our roadmap for the next 12 months. We\u2019re instead focusing on bringing you a new search experience, and are investigating improvements to permissions.\r\n\r\nFor more context on this, take a read of the Community blog:\u00a0[A renewed approach to highly voted Server suggestions for Jira and Confluence|https://community.atlassian.com/t5/Jira-articles/A-renewed-approach-to-highly-voted-Server-suggestions-for-Jira/ba-p/688117].\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, we suggest taking a look at the\u00a0[Better Blogs for Confluence add-on|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.arijea.plugins.betterblogs/server/reviews].\r\n\r\nBest\r\n Jenny Millman | Product Manager - Confluence Server\r\n{panel}\r\n\u00a0",
