The problem is, the 50x50 pixel image that confluence gives me is often not enough to see what someone really looks like. It would be great if there were a way to get a full-size view of someone's profile picture.\r\n\r\nIt could implemented very simply by adding a new option called \"profile picture\" to the hover profile dropdown. When someone selects this option, it would open the full image in gallery-style view.\r\n\r\n!http://img.skitch.com/20100428-ck2t15xpjabp4fmx7yc53emw37.jpg!\r\n\r\n!http://img.skitch.com/20100428-qarmrbcmb9agccq1cm32nprihg.jpg!",

      "description": "h3. Original Description\r\n\r\nWe've recently decided to clean up our permission scheme a bit, and part of this involved using nested groups. We already used Crowd to link our Confluence instance (as well as JIRA and some third-party things) to our Active Directory server, and Crowd supports nested groups so we didn't think there would be any problem.\r\n\r\nSince then however, it happens regularly that users can't access a certain space in Confluence to which they should have access through nested groups. For example, there would be a space called \"Human Resources\", to which a group called \"confluence-hr\" has full access. Then there would be a group \"Management\" that is a member of the \"confluence-hr\" group amongst others, and obviously the management people are members of this group. The goal is to be able to add people to just one or two \"role\" groups like \"Management\" by which they get all the permissions they need, while also being able to keep fine-grained control, so that if someone needs just access to the HR space, we add them to the confluence-hr group and they don't get access to everything else like Management.\r\n\r\nThe only fix I've been able to find is restarting the Confluence instance. After a restart, everything works fine again, but a bit later the same problem arises. This happens sometimes several times a day, and it's very irritating. Can anyone suggest a proper fix for this, or is this a genuine bug?\r\n\r\nh3. Updated Description \r\nThis is caused by CWD-1996. \r\n\r\nh3. Workaround \r\nWe have still not been able to find the source of the problem within the confluence code, however we do know that someone the confluence caches are affecting the crowd caches. \r\n\r\nWe have attached the [crowd-integration-client-2.0.7-CWD-1996.jar|http://jira.atlassian.com/secure/attachment/40829/crowd-integration-client-2.0.7-CWD-1996.jar] which shades net.sf.ehcache to com.atlassian.crowd.shaded.ehcache. What this means is that there is no possible way that Confluence could have any effect whatsoever with the Crowd integration client's caches. They are essentially different classes that Confluence knows nothing about.\r\n\r\nTo apply the patch, upgrade to crowd 2.0.7 and in your confluence instance, remove the any other Crowd integration client JARs from\r\n{{CONFLUENCE_INSTALL}}/confluence/WEB-INF/lib\r\nand place the attached [crowd-integration-client-2.0.7-CWD-1996.jar|http://jira.atlassian.com/secure/attachment/40829/crowd-integration-client-2.0.7-CWD-1996.jar] and restart confluence. \r\n\r\nThis integration is being completely rewritten for Crowd 2.1 / Confluence 3.5, which will fix this bug permantently.",

Both run on tomcat 6.0.18 on 32bit debian. It happens on both instances; we pass the encoding test (admin/encodingtest.action) on both confluence instances. \r\n\r\nh3. Steps to reproduce\r\n* Attach a file with filename e.g. \"test_\u00e4_test.png\" to a page\r\n* Try to edit or remove the file \r\n\r\nh3. Actual results\r\n* The file cannot be edited or removed; NullPointerException at at com.atlassian.confluence.pages.actions.MoveAttachmentAction.bootstrap(MoveAttachmentAction.java:115); Stacktrace is attached\r\n* Viewing the file works\r\n\r\nh3.

Additionally, the \"Save\" and \"Cancel\" buttons are not visible.\r\n\r\nI was able to reproduce the empty Space dropdown by attempting to add a bookmark using the bookmarklet while not logged into Confluence using Firefox 3.6 on Windows Vista.

      "description": "Resolving CONF-19321 has a few documentation implications.\r\n\r\nThe general fix is that instead of adminstrators.action returning a list of e-mail addresses for the configured administrators of the site it will now give you a form which you can use to e-mail all the administrators of the site. This is preferable since it doesn't give the user any information about who these administrators are (e.g. the old mechanism of supplying their e-mail addresses could make it easier to guess the usernames of administrators for the site).\r\n\r\nThis mechanism is linked from the 500 error page in Confluence. It is also linked in 3.3 onwards from the template and theme configuration pages for a space.\r\n\r\n*Conditions to watch out for:*\r\n1) If there is no mail server configured for the site then instead of a contact form you will receive a message telling you that - \"No mail server has been configured so it is not possible to contact the site administrators via this method.\"\r\n2) If none of the administrators for the site have e-mail addresses you also get a message instead of the form - \"None of the site administrators have e-mail addresses set so cannot be contacted via this method.\"\r\n3) If you have removed the confluence-administrators group then you receive the same message as in point 2. (I know this isn't quite correct but you could argue it avoids giving out specific details the user set up of the instance. There wasn't enough time to add handling for this specific condition.)\r\n4) If SPAM prevention/Captcha is configured then those configuration settings will also apply to this form\r\n\r\n*Configuration Options*\r\n1) As mentioned previously, the site wide SPAM prevention settings are used here.\r\n2) There is a new General Configuration setting called \"Custom Contact Administrator Message:\". This allows you to change the prompt that is presented before the form.\r\n3) There is a new General Configuration setting called \"Contact Administrators Form\". This allows you to turn the form off. This should be used in conjunction with the previous setting explaining your alternative contact mechanism.\r\n\r\nI've attached a few screenshots to help illustrate things.\r\n\r\nIf you would prefer me to write (or provide a first draft of) the documentation please just get back to me with a location for where it should live and I'll do it immediately.\r\n",
