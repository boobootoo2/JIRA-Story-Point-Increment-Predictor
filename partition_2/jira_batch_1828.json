However, when looking at the logs, it appears the logging of the urls do not show parameters.  This causes an issue when a page titled with a special character (eg & or ?) is hit.  This is because those pages use the pageId as a parameter in the url.  When those page hits are logged, they only display as .../pages/viewpage.action leaving ambiguity as to what page was hit.  \r\n\r\nThis causes the access reports to never show hits to those pages, and leaving incorrect hit counts. Logging of the parameters will allow us to determine when all pages are hit so we can have proper logging. ",

Because it's a company-internal wiki, Confluence is totally idle at backup time. You'll see the successful checks just before the db backup, the shutdown and the successful checks afterward.\r\n\r\nNotice, that the check @195030.054 (Worker-3) seems to be stuck in waiting for the database and the scheduled check @ 195100.026 (Worker-9) is \"passing by\". In the other hand, Worker-3 finishes the check successful afterwards.\r\n\r\nFrom this i would derive, that no database connection timeout have happended but just a short \"freeze\" caused by the database dump operations.\r\n\r\nIMHO there should just one check running at a time. Did some kind of locking become unfunctional?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Currently no numbered heading will be generated (that is already tracked on CONF-1732) but still, the numbering in the resulting list will be reset at every included page. If context could be passed to the included page the numbered list renderer could continue with the global enumeration rather that resetting to 1, resulting in documents with the structure  \r\n{noformat}\r\n1.\r\n   a.\r\n   b.\r\n1.\r\n   a.\r\n   b.\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nBest Regards,\r\nEdoardo",

You can find instructions on how to configure nested groups in our documentation:\r\n\r\n* [Configuring User Directories|http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Configuring+User+Directories]\r\n\r\nMore information about the great new features available with the release of Confluence 3.5 can be found in [the release notes|http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Confluence+3.5+Release+Notes]. Thanks for your interest and support of Confluence.\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\n\r\nCurrently in Atlassian-user, groups can only include users, not other groups. Support for nested groups would allow groups to contain other groups.\r\n\r\nFor example, consider the following simplified LDAP records:\r\n\r\ndn: cn=sales,ou=groups\r\ncn: sales\r\nmember: cn=salesman,ou=users\r\n\r\ndn: cn=staff,ou=groups\r\ncn: staff\r\nmember: cn=ceo,ou=users\r\nmember: cn=sales,ou=groups\r\n\r\nIn this example, the group 'sales' is a group containing just a single user, 'salesman'. However, the 'staff' group contains both the user 'ceo' and the group 'sales'. \r\n\r\nIn Atlassian-user, implementing nested groups would mean that 'salesman' would be a member of both 'sales' and 'staff' in the above scenario. Atlassian-user should also recognise that both users and groups can be members of a group, especially when listing the membership information for a group. (That is, a list of the members of 'staff' should have two entries: an entry for the 'ceo' user and an entry for the 'sales' group. The membership should not automatically be condensed into a list of two users.)\r\n\r\nIn applications, permissions granted to the 'staff' group should apply to both 'salesman' and 'ceo'. Additionally, any new users added to 'sales' should automatically gain these permissions.\r\n",

There is no more email notifications until you visit the page.
