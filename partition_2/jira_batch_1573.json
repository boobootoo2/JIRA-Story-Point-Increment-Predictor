Use Case\r\nWe would like to be able to [delete users from Confluence through the UI|https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/delete-or-disable-users-138318.html] regardless if the user has authored content at some point or not. It would be good to have Confluence moving content to different users or to an Alias user in order for us to be able to delete them.\r\n\r\nh4. Current Behaviour\r\nCurrently, if we try to delete an user from Confluence who has authored content, we will be blocked by the application with the observation that the user has content and can't be delete because of that. Screenshot below:\r\n\r\n!Screen Shot 2018-02-16 at 16.55.52.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nh4. Workaround\r\nThe only workaround at this point is to [disable the user|https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/delete-or-disable-users-138318.html], which reduces the license user count.

Problem summary\r\nThe \"Recently Updated\" and \"Recently Worked On\" menu items on the Confluence Dashboard can be slow to load (multiple seconds) when using MySQL 5.7 if the instance contains a huge dataset. Query is also executed during viewpage action to fetch status of draft lozegne or, when collaborative editing is enabled, to fetch information about contributors of the page (touch relation). This issue does not occur in instances using MySQL 5.6.\r\n\r\nThis slowness is caused by a slow SQL query that impacts MySQL 5.7. Although a MySQL DBA might be able to mitigate this issue from the database side with some optimizer tuning (details below), we ought to explore a way to re-write the query so that it is more performant with an out-of-the-box MySQL 5.7.\r\n\r\nh2. Technical details\r\nConfluence issues the following query when clicking on aforementioned menu items from the Dashboard (note the CONTENTID parameters are dummy values and are not important for the investigation). You may also see slow queries logged when loading individual pages in view mode with Collaborative Editing enabled. \r\nThere is a discernible difference in query performance in a vanilla MySQL 5.6 instance when compared to MySQL 5.7, given a large enough dataset.

Workaround - The \"derived_merge\" flag in MySQL 5.7\r\nIt appears that the difference in optimization strategies between MySQL 5.6 and 5.7 is due to an optimizer switch called \"derived_merge\" which was introduced and enabled by default in MySQL 5.7: https://mysqlserverteam.com/derived-tables-in-mysql-5-7\r\n\r\nWhen after setting this switch to \"off\" in MySQL 5.7, the same query executes quickly, and we can see that the DBMS reverts to using the same query plan as MySQL 5.6:\r\n{code}\r\nset session optimizer_switch=\"derived_merge=off\";\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nThe above query will only apply for the current MySQL session. For a more permanent solution either run:\r\n{code}\r\nset global optimizer_switch=\u201cderived_merge=off\";\r\n{code}\r\nOr add it to my.cnf's optimizer_switch line:\r\n{noformat}\r\noptimizer_switch = derived_merge=off\r\n{noformat}\r\n(i) optimizer_switch may already have values. Add derived_merge to the end with comma seperation\r\n\r\nh3. Notes about Collaborative Editing\r\n\r\nIf you are seeing this issue after enabling Collaborative Editing, disabling the feature may reduce the impact. However, *we don't recommend* that approach as switching CE off is *an expensive task that can cause even further issues*. Disabling the derived merge flag as described above is the recommended approach. ",

      "description": "{panel:bgColor=#e7f4fa}\r\n*NOTE:* This bug report is for *Confluence Server*.\u00a0\r\n{panel}\r\nh2. Summary\r\n\r\nUnknown Users appears in various places such as Mentions:\r\n\r\n!unknownusermention.PNG|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nPage restrictions:\r\n\r\n!unknownuserrestrictions.PNG|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nAnd everywhere else. This causes degraded functions:\r\n* Mentioned users are not notified\r\n* Permissions and restrictions are not properly set - eg, users unable to edit pages\r\n\r\nh2. How to replicate\r\n\r\nThe issue happens when we rename LDAP users to usernames that already exists in Confluence. For example:\r\n # Set a user directory connection to LDAP A with username attribute: SAMAccountname\r\n # Set another user directory connection to LDAP A with username attribute: mail\r\n # Edit the second user directory's username attribute to SAMAccountname\r\n\r\nh2. Expected Result\r\n\r\nSince the newly renamed users are being renamed to existing set of users, it's expected that the users are now \"merged\".\r\nh2. Actual Results\r\n\r\nDuplicated users exists in the user_mapping table. One of them has NULL lower_username and causing sightings of Unknown User in Confluence UI.\r\nh2. Notes\r\n\r\nWhen connecting to a new user directory with a new set of usernames, Confluence will create records of these users in the user_mapping table.\u00a0\r\n\r\nWhen user are renamed, Confluence will update user records in the user_mapping table. This is where the issue happens as users are being renamed to an already existing username and forced one of the records' lower_username to be NULL to avoid duplicate constraint in the database:\r\n * user_mapping table after connecting to 2 LDAP with different usernames\r\n\r\n||user_key||username||lower_username||\r\n|ff8080814a5a97df014a5b16c37c0008|usera@mail.com|usera@mail.com|\r\n|ff8080814a5a97df014a5a97fb240001|userA|\u00a0usera|\r\n\r\n * user_mapping table after renaming one of the user in LDAP side:\r\n\r\n||user_key||username||lower_username||\r\n|ff8080814a5a97df014a5b16c37c0008|userA|usera|\r\n|ff8080814a5a97df014a5a97fb240001|userA|\u00a0|\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\nh2. Diagnosis\r\n\r\nThis can occur because {{user_mapping.lower_user_name}} is null. You may have a single user record for the affected user, or you may have another record which _does_ include a lower_username.\r\n * Single user record\r\n||user_key||username||lower_username||\r\n|ff8080814a5a97df014a5a97fb240001|userA|\u00a0|\r\n\r\n * Duplicated users (taken from an OnDemand instance)\r\n||user_key||username||lower_username||\r\n|ff8080814a5a97df014a5b16c37c0008|userA|usera|\r\n|ff8080814a5a97df014a5a97fb240001|userA|\u00a0|\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\nh3. Diagnosis - is this affecting you?\r\n\r\nFirst, try a content reindex. If this doesn't help, run this query (on any version). If it returns any results, this bug is the cause of your duplicates.\r\n\r\nCheck and confirm if the user showing as unknown user is indeed affected by this bug:\r\n{code:title=diagnosis for specific users}\r\nSELECT * FROM user_mapping where lower(username) = '<username_lowercase>';\r\n{code}\r\n(!) Replace <username_lowercase> with the *lower cased* version of the username that's observed to be having this behavior. \r\n\r\nCheck if there are more users affected by this bug:\r\n\r\n{code:title=NULL users diagnosis}\r\nSELECT  * FROM user_mapping where lower_username is null;\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nIf the above SQL query returns with some results, now you need to determine if you have single records or duplicated records, as the workaround you perform will depend on this.\r\n\r\n{code:title=pair NULL users}\r\nselect u.* from user_mapping u where lower(u.username) in (select nullrecord.username from user_mapping nullrecord where lower_username is null) order by u.username;\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nh2. Workaround:\r\n\r\nFollow the workaround provided in the bug report\u00a0CONFSERVER-36018\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0",

Problem Summary\r\nIf I attach a file to Confluence that has multiple white spaces in its name, I won't see the file being displayed with the name I gave in the attachments page.\r\n\r\nh4. Steps to Replicate\r\n# Create an empty page - I have called mine Third Testing page of a Dude.\r\n# Create two dummy PPTX files:\r\n## One of them should be called Test<space>File.pptx - With a single space in between the words Test and File.\r\n## The other one should be called Test<space><space><space>File.pptx - With three spaces in between the words Test and File.\r\n## Replace the <space> with actual spaces. :)\r\n# Upload both files to your empty page.\r\n# With that done, on your left side, look for Space Tools and click on it. Click on Content Tools and then on the Attachments tab.\r\n\r\nAt this point, you will see two files with the same display name:\r\n\r\n!Screen Shot 2018-02-08 at 15.50.03.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nBoth of the files are displayed as test<space>file.pptx, however, one of them is actually test<space>file.pptx while the other one is test<space><space><space>file.pptx.\r\n\r\nh4. Further Details\r\nIt is interesting to note that this is a default browser behaviour. Browsers will usually trim multiple white spaces and display a single white space only unless the application enforces that it wants to see the multiple white spaces displayed through either a HTML Tag or through its CSS. By opening Developer Tools you can see that Confluence is actually keeping the original file name, but the browser trims it:\r\n\r\n!Screen Shot 2018-02-09 at 17.06.57.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nh4. Workaround\r\nThere's currently no recommended workaround, unless you open the Javascript accountable for running the {{listattachmentsforspace.action}} and modify it to include <pre></pre> tags into it, however, this is not highly recommended since you will need to do it upon every update and it may break other things.\r\n\r\nh4. Possible Fix\r\nConfluence code can use the <pre></pre> tags or enforce white spaces on a CSS level.",

You need a space with a home page and at least one child page of that home page.\r\n2. reorder the pages such that the child page is on the same level as the home page (so it's an orphaned page)\r\n3. reorder the pages again such that the child page is again a child of the home page\r\nThese steps\r\ncause multiple entries in the ancestor table on a freshly installed version of Confluence 6.7 without any plugins installed on the GUI by a non-admin user\r\nRunning below query already returns>1:\r\n{code:java}\r\nSELECT A.ANCESTORID, A.DESCENDENTID, COUNT(A.DESCENDENTID)\r\nFROM CONFANCESTORS A, CONTENT B\r\nWHERE B.CONTENTID = A.DESCENDENTID\r\nGROUP BY A.ANCESTORID, A.DESCENDENTID\r\nORDER BY 3 DESC\r\n{code}\r\nThe output of the select query is not equal 1 and yet we do not see expected warning inside logs:\r\n{code:java}\r\nSelected ancestors table corruption for pageId: 1234567. \r\nAccess to this page is blocked for all users as inherited permissions cannot be determined. \r\nTo resolve this, rebuild the ancestors table. See https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Rebuilding+the+Ancestor+Table\r\n{code}\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nCustomer would like to have ancestors table put automatically in sync as this needs them to perform on almost daily basis the same procedure\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nWe need to do the usual manual rebuild procedure of [ancestor table|https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/rebuilding-the-ancestor-table-153948.html]\r\nnotes\r\n\r\nh3. Notes\r\nWe have lots of customers who might face frequent problems with ancestors tables and end up with manual workaround and would really appreciate a solution or real automated procedure for cleanup that doesn't need service interruption\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nThe steps to resolve this issue is still to rebuild the ancestors' table as described in this KB [https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/8qr-Nw]",

This is fine for locally attached files it's treated as a query string parameter, but this should not be appended to externally file URLs, and it makes the download function not work because the file doesn't exist with this filename.\r\n\r\nExample - with an inserted image from the web with the following URL:\r\n\r\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/53/Google_%22G%22_Logo.svg\r\n\r\nThe download link in the file preview will link to:\r\n\r\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/53/Google_%22G%22_Logo.svg&download=true\r\n\r\nWhich will result in an error.

From here, you will get an error with the download.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nThe download function for externally linked images should not add this \"&download=true\" parameter and should download the image correctly.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nThe download function doesn't work, as the filename is incorrect.\r\n \r\n\r\nh3.Workaround\r\n\r\nAs a workaround, you can right-click the download link and select to copy the URL or open link in new tab.  From there, the URL can be edited to remove the \"&download=true\" from the end of the filename to access the file and download it from there.  (see my attached screen recording).",

Example\r\nIn one instance, the import failed and the logs printed the below: \r\n{code}\r\n2018-01-19 12:37:12,688 ERROR [Long running task: Importing data] [engine.jdbc.spi.SqlExceptionHelper] logExceptions ERROR: value too long for type character varying(255)\r\n -- url: /longrunningtaskxml.action | referer: http://confluence.example.com/admin/restore-local-file.action | traceId: 37db6afd87d848bd | userName: admin | action: longrunningtaskxml\r\n\r\n2018-01-19 12:37:12,818 ERROR [Long running task: Importing data] [confluence.importexport.xmlimport.DefaultImportProcessor] persist Error while saving object: Imported[com.atlassian.confluence.links.OutgoingLink] [Id[id]=12345678, Property[destinationPageTitle]=//jira/browse/EX-12345, Property[lowerDestinationPageTitle]=//jira/browse/ex-12345, Property[destinationSpaceKey]=http, Property[lowerDestinationSpaceKey]=http, Property[sourceContent]=com.atlassian.confluence.pages.Page[Id[id]=4567890], Property[creator]=com.atlassian.confluence.user.ConfluenceUserImpl[Id[key]=8aa3087e452fdd2e01452fde8e551b66], Property[creationDate]=2017-03-23 22:10:32.000, Property[lastModifier]=com.atlassian.confluence.user.ConfluenceUserImpl[Id[key]=8aa3087e452fdd2e01452fde8e551b66], Property[lastModificationDate]=2017-03-23 22:10:32.000]\r\n -- url: /longrunningtaskxml.action | referer: http://confluence.example.com/admin/restore-local-file.action | traceId: 37db6afd87d848bd | userName: admin | action: longrunningtaskxml\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nAt a glance, it seems that a column's max length in the database was exceeded (more than 255 characters), and the offending content is related to a row in the LINKS table (com.atlassian.confluence.links.OutgoingLink). However, this is completely misleading as we can see that nothing in that record contains close to 255 characters.\r\n\r\nh2. Troubleshooting\r\nTo find the true offending content, one needs to enable detailed SQL logging which is very verbose, and then re-run the migration up to the point of failure: https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/enabling-detailed-sql-logging-179030.html\r\n\r\nWhen this is done, we see that the last content Confluence was trying to insert which caused the failure during import was actually something completely different (an an object relating to inline comments in this example):\r\n{code}\r\n 2018-01-24 13:38:19,047 DEBUG [Long running task: Importing data] [org.hibernate.SQL] logStatement insert into CONTENTPROPERTIES (PROPERTYNAME, STRINGVAL, LONGVAL, DATEVAL, PROPERTYID) values (?, ?, ?, ?, ?)\r\n\r\n 2018-01-24 13:38:19,047 TRACE [Long running task: Importing data] [type.descriptor.sql.BasicBinder] bind binding parameter [1] as [VARCHAR] - [inline-original-selection]\r\n 2018-01-24 13:38:19,047 TRACE [Long running task: Importing data] [type.descriptor.sql.BasicBinder] bind binding parameter [2] as [VARCHAR] - [Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

Additional notes\r\nThis issue may be due to batching processes in the import. The error recorded in the standard logs may be referring to the first entry in the batch which contains the offending row. Ideally, we should be logging the actual offending row instead.",

Synopsis and Details\r\nh4. Repro Steps\r\n # Create a group with the offending character, such as:\r\n{code:java}\r\nthis group's name is bad{code}\r\n\r\n # Navigate to any space\r\n # Go to space permissions\r\n # Add this group with any permissions\r\n ** Or, if it already exists in that space's permissions, make some change (anything) to the permissions on screen\r\n # Click Save\r\n # Save never completes, and it appears as though the page froze\r\n\r\nh4. Expected Results\r\n\r\nThe space permissions are updated according to the selection on screen\r\nh4. Actual Results\r\n\r\nThe space permissions are not updated due to a bug in our code which doesn't escape single quotes in group names:\r\n{code:java}\r\n/**\r\n * @module confluence/space-permissions-table\r\n */\r\nvar $original = self.$el.find(\"input[name='\" + checkbox.name.replace('checkbox', 'initial') + \"']\");\r\n{code}\r\nThis is the error captured by debugging the java script:\r\n{code:java}\r\nDOMException: Failed to execute 'querySelectorAll' on 'Element': '[id='gPermissionsTable']\r\ninput[name='confluence_initial_viewspace_group_dl this group's name is bad']' is not a valid selector\r\n{code}\r\nh4. How to confirm you have this issue\r\n\r\nIf you are experiencing the symptoms, you can debug the javascript on the page to confirm:\r\n # Go to a space (which has the issue) > space tools > space permissions\r\n # Click Edit\r\n # Make some changes, such as adding a user or modifying an existing user\r\n # Open *Developer Tools*, if you *Search in all files* and search for {{confluence/space-permissions-form}} then you can put a breakpoint on the {{submit: function () {}} part.\r\n ** Since the Javscript code is minified, you can beautify it by clicking on \\{ } after you go that line and set the breakpoint there.\r\n ** Be sure to click \"Pause on exceptions\"\r\n # Click Save on the UI\r\n # Step through the code until the exception is found\r\n\r\nh4. Screenshots showing the issue\r\n\r\n!space-perms1.png|thumbnail! !space-perms2.png|thumbnail!\r\nh2. Workarounds\r\n\r\nUntil this bug is fixed (probably by using group ID's instead of group names to name permission DOM elements), you have two options to work around this.\r\nh4. Option 1\r\n\r\nRename the group to remove the single quote / apostrophe characters\r\nh4. Option 2\r\n\r\nYou can make changes to space permissions via REST, for example:\r\n{code:java}\r\ncurl -i -X POST -H \"X-Atlassian-Token: no-check\" -H \"Authorization: Basic YWRtaW46YWRtaW4=\" -d \"confluence_checkbox_viewspace_group_super-editor=on&confluence_checkbox_removeowncontent_group_super-editor=on&confluence_checkbox_editspace_group_super-editor=on&confluence_checkbox_removepage_group_super-editor=on&groupsToAdd=confluence-administrators\" http://localhost:8080/confluence/spaces/doeditspacepermissions.action?key=TEST\r\n{code}\r\nh5. How-to\r\n # First, you'll need to use [basic authentication|https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/confluence/basic-auth-for-rest-apis/] to pass your account details (passing them in clear text is also supported, but discouraged for security reasons).\r\n # In the above code snippet, it is adding the following permissions: View Space, Delete Own Content, Add Pages, Delete Pages. T\r\n ## These are purely examples; the changes you need to make will depend on your business case.\r\n ## For the sake of completeness, there are other permissions you can add here as well. The full list is:\r\n{code:java}\r\n       [[\"viewspace\", \"removeowncontent\"],\r\n        [\"editspace\", \"removepage\"],\r\n        [\"editblog\", \"removeblog\"],\r\n        [\"createattachment\", \"removeattachment\"],\r\n        [\"comment\", \"removecomment\"],\r\n        [\"setpagepermissions\"],\r\n        [\"removemail\"],\r\n        [\"exportspace\", \"setspacepermissions\"]]\r\n{code}\r\n\r\n # \r\n ## To add one of these permissions, you'll need to embed it within: {{confluence_checkbox_<PERMISSION HERE>_group_super-editor}} and give that a value of {{on}}, like in the above code snippet.\r\n # You'll need to update the URL, and use it for each space key of which you want to grant/remove permissions.\r\n\r\nh5. Option 2 Caveats\r\n\r\n(!) If you are terminating SSL at the reverse proxy, you will need to ensure you pass the certificate in the request, or bypass the proxy and connect directly to Confluence on a non-secure port. In this scenario, to be able to apply the workaround solution, you need to add an extra http connector in the file server.xml:\r\n{code:java}\r\n<Connector port=\"8095\" connectionTimeout=\"20000\" redirectPort=\"8443\" maxThreads=\"300\" minSpareThreads=\"10\" enableLookups=\"false\" acceptCount=\"10\" URIEncoding=\"UTF-8\" protocol=\"HTTP/1.1\" /> \r\n{code}\r\nAfter a restart, fire the same curl request you crafted on the local Confluence machine pointed at port 8095 (per the example above) with your credentials.\r\n\r\n(!) You may also need to *temporarily* disable the admin security system during the workaround solution implementation with the steps mentioned on the page [Configuring XSRF Protection|https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/configuring-xsrf-protection-218276695.html] to allow the cross-site request and the page [Configuring Secure Administrator Sessions|https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/configuring-secure-administrator-sessions-218269595.html] to disable the secure session so you do not need to authenticate again for the admin operation, example:\r\n{code:java}\r\ncurl -i -k -X POST -H \"X-Atlassian-Token: no-check\" -H \"Authorization: Basic YWRtaW46YWRtaW4=\" -d \"confluence_checkbox_viewspace_group_confluence-administrators=on&confluence_checkbox_removeowncontent_group_confluence-administrators=on&confluence_checkbox_editspace_group_confluence-administrators=on\" http://localhost:8090/confluence/spaces/doeditspacepermissions.action?key=TEST\r\n{code}\r\nIt will return 302 with the Location \"/spaces/spacepermissions.action?key=TEST\" - This will add the necessary space permission to the group \"confluence-administrators\" (example) on each space.\r\nh4. Option 3\r\n\r\nRemove permissions from the affected group and make a change in the\u00a0*confluence-administrators*\u00a0group. After the change, the save button will be available to click.\r\n # Edit space permission.\r\n # Remove the permissions of the affected group.\r\n # Make a modification in the\u00a0*confluence-administrators*\u00a0group.\r\n # Save the changes.",

Beyond the first word (when a whitespace has been input), no additional results will return unless entire words are matched. This can lead to confusion as users type into the filter box.\r\n\r\nh2. Steps to reproduce\r\n# Create several (e.g. 5) dummy spaces with various names\r\n# Create a space named \"First Second Third\" (the space key does not matter)\r\n# Wait a few seconds for the new spaces to be added to the search indexed automatically\r\n# Go to Space Directory and type in \"first\" one letter at a time. Notice that the space \"First Second Third\" shows up in the results once three characters or more have been inputted due to partially matching \"first\" \r\n# Add a white space and start typing \"second\" one letter at a time\r\n\r\nh2. Expected behavior\r\nThe space \"First Second Third\" continues to show the entire time the second term is being typed\r\n\r\nh2. Actual behavior\r\nAs soon as the first letter (\"s\") of the second term is typed, the Space Directory takes out the space \"First Second Third\" from the result set. This behavior continues until the entirety of the second word has been typed, such that the text box shows \"first second\", at which time the space is once again displayed.\r\n\r\nThe same behavior can be observed if another whitespace is added and the user starts typing the third search term.",
