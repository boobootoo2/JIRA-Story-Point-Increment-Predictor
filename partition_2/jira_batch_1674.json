When all the columns in an index are specified in a query (and in the same order as the index), there is no impact. However, if a query makes use of only a few of the columns, the index will be ignored, and a sequential search will be performed. In large databases, this can be a performance hit.\r\n\r\nIn some cases, indexes are created on combinations of columns that do see realistic use. For example, space permissions are queried by group name, or by username - but never by both at the same time. Thus an index on both the {{permgroupname}} and {{permusername}} columns would not provide any improvement, and could actually cause a decrease in performance in certain scenarios.\r\n\r\nh3. Resolution\r\nTo resolve these warnings, you will need to change the schema of your database to specify that each column should be nullable. The way you would achieve this varies across each database system, so refer to the official documentation for your database.\r\n\r\nTo resolve these warnings, you should drop the mentioned index, and re-create it. The syntax will depend on your particular database variety, but generally the following should work:\r\n\r\nh4.Postgres, Oracle, MSSQL:\r\n{code}\r\nDROP INDEX <index_name>;\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nh4.MySQL:\r\n{code}\r\nALTER TABLE <table_name> DROP INDEX <index_name>;\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nNext, allow Confluence to recreate the index. Add {{-Datlassian.forceSchemaUpdate=true}} to your [JVM Arguments|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Configuring+System+Properties] and restart Confluence. On the next restart, Confluence will recreate any indexes that are missing.\r\n\r\nConfluence will note that the index has been dropped, with a similar warning message:\r\n\r\n{code}\r\n2015-03-23 10:54:21,559 WARN [localhost-startStop-1] [core.persistence.schema.StartupSchemaChecker] handleWarnings Database schema is inconsistent with expectations - %s warnings, see below\r\n2015-03-23 10:54:21,560 WARN [localhost-startStop-1] [core.persistence.schema.StartupSchemaChecker] handleWarnings Index [sp_comp_idx] of table [spacepermissions] is missing; expected [Index spacepermissions.sp_comp_idx on [permtype, permgroupname] non-unique]\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nIf the flag is enabled, Confluence will generate a recovery file, and then repair the schema. You can use your database tools to verify that the specified index has been re-created.\r\n\r\nPlease feel free to [contact Support|https://support.atlassian.com] for help with this.",

Impact\r\nWith a {{non-nullable}} column, null values are not permitted. Under normal circumstances, Confluence should not insert null values into these tables.\r\n\r\nHowever, if Confluence were to insert a null value into one of these tables (and the column is {{non-nullable}}), the insert statement would fail. Inserting a null value would have no operational impact on Confluence.\r\n\r\nh3. Resolution\r\nIn many cases these warnings can be ignored. Often, Confluence's code will also be null-safe, which means that it may never attempt to enter a null into these columns. However, there is always a risk of data becoming inconsistent through bugs or manual changes, and these constraints help to guard against that.\r\n\r\nTo resolve these warnings, you will need to change the columns of the target table (in our case, follow_connections) and specify that each column displayed in the warnings (follower and followee in our case) to be nullable. The way you would achieve this varies across each database system, so refer to the official documentation for your database.\r\n\r\nPlease feel free to [contact Support|https://support.atlassian.com] for help with this.",

Cause\r\nThis particular warning occurs because there is a column in the database which should not allow null values, but does.\r\n\r\nThis warning has been encountered on these columns:\r\n* content_label.labelid\r\n* logininfo.username\r\n* confversion.buildnumber\r\n* content_perm.cp_type\r\n* trustedapp.public_key_id\r\n\r\nThese warnings appear in the logs:\r\n{code}\r\nColumn [labelid] of table [content_label] has mismatched definitions for expected [Column content_label.labelid int8 non-nullable] and actual [Column content_label.labelid int8(19) nullable]\r\n\r\nColumn [username] of table [logininfo] has mismatched definitions for expected [Column logininfo.username varchar(255) non-nullable] and actual [Column logininfo.username varchar(255) nullable]\r\n\r\nColumn [buildnumber] of table [confversion] has mismatched definitions for expected [Column confversion.buildnumber int4 non-nullable] and actual [Column confversion.buildnumber int4(10) nullable]\r\n\r\nColumn [cp_type] of table [content_perm] has mismatched definitions for expected [Column content_perm.cp_type varchar(10) non-nullable] and actual [Column content_perm.cp_type varchar(10) nullable]\r\n\r\nColumn [public_key_id] of table [trustedapp] has mismatched definitions for expected [Column trustedapp.public_key_id int8 non-nullable] and actual [Column trustedapp.public_key_id int8(19) nullable]\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nh3. Impact\r\nWhen Confluence retrieves information from these columns, it expects a real value. If your database allows null values in these columns, you could end up with inconsistent data in the database that can cause other problems later on, eg during upgrades, or during general use. Usually these will manifest in the form of NullPointerExceptions. \r\n\r\nh3. Resolution\r\nIn many cases these warnings can be ignored. Often, Confluence's code will also be null-safe, which means that it may never attempt to enter a null into these columns. However, there is always a risk of data becoming inconsistent through bugs or manual changes, and these constraints help to guard against that.\r\n\r\nTo resolve these warnings, you will need to change the schema of your database to specify that each column should be non-nullable. The way you would achieve this varies across each database system, so refer to the official documentation for your database.\r\n\r\nNB: If there are any nulls in this column already, those rows will need to be removed/cleaned before you can achieve this. Please feel free to [contact Support|https://support.atlassian.com] for help with this.",

Not sure if it works in 5.7 as the date on the post is 2013.\r\n\r\nDoes it have to be this hard? Can ExcerptHelper be marked as available for plugins in rederingContext.xml or something similar to [CONF-22371|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONF-22371] magic be done?\r\n\r\nI also note that often when a consumer of API like us wants an excerpt from a page developers will have to repeat the same pattern - use ExcerptHelper to extract \"excerpt\" macro content and if there is none, use something like com.atlassian.confluence.content.render.xhtml.view.excerpt.Excerpter (perfectly injectable) to fall back to another method - so perhaps it would be nice to supply an injectable helper class with aggregated functionality?\r\n\r\n",

So you can still lose changes that were made after the last autosave. \r\n\r\nIt would be great if clicking Close triggered an autosave, so that nothing is lost. \r\n\r\nWorkaround: Wait for an autosave after your last change, or click Preview before Close (Preview forces an autosave, however note [CONF-36410|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONF-36410]). Of course this isn't very helpful because it relies on the user anticipating problems and intentionally closing without saving, rather than doing it accidentally, which may be the more common case. \r\n\r\nTo reproduce:\r\n* edit a page and make a change\r\n* click Close before the change is autosaved\r\n* go to Drafts and see that the change is not there\r\n* edit the page again and make a change\r\n* sit on the page until an autosave occurs, then click Close\r\n* go to Drafts and see that the change is there",

      "description": "To reproduce:\r\n* go to a page that has many descendants (10000 including attachments and comments should be enough)\r\n* add a view restriction (e.g. limit viewing to yourself)\r\n* check the index queue - it should be so large that it will take several minutes to process\r\n* go to a page that has many descendants\r\n* add/remove a view restriction\r\n\r\nWhat should happen:\r\n* the restriction is set and is inherited by all descendants. The index is updated to reflect that fact\r\n\r\nWhat happens instead:\r\n* An exception is thrown on the server (see below) and passed to the AJAX request\r\n* No error handler is defined for the AJAX request, so no error message is shown to the user - the user gets no feedback at all\r\n* At least one insert into the journal queue fails (see exception below) - i.e. the index will not reflect the permission change above\r\n\r\nI am aware of the fact that setting {{innodb_lock_wait_timeout}} in MySql to a higher value can work around this problem (it is set to 50 right now - I have not found any official recommendations from Atlassian for this), but this would just move the problem, not fix it.\r\n\r\nStacktrace:\r\n{code}\r\ncom.atlassian.confluence.api.service.exceptions.ServiceException: Failed to add entry to queue\r\n\tat

I get quite a lot of use out of g+g or / to open quick search, and g+d is useful for getting to the dashboard, but after using these a bit, I found myself expecting there to be a shortcut for navigating directly to the homepage of a targeted space.\r\n\r\nIn other words, I envision:\r\n* g then (p) - opens a space picker dialog\r\n* type the first few characters of the desired space to filter the list\r\n* hit enter once the desired space is highlighted; browser navigates to that space\r\n\r\nAt present, you can sort of do this with the quick search, but you will have to type more characters to filter the list properly, and will still have to hit the down arrow a couple of times to pass over the list of pages down to the space results. A dedicated shortcut and picker would be much better for this.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what key should be used for this -- my expectation was that g+s would fit the best, and \"browse current\" would be set to g+c or something.

Reproduction steps:\r\n# Install Confluence 5.4.4\r\n# Create a blog post\r\n# Create a blank page, add an include-page macro that points to the previously created blog post\r\n# Save the page and see that it renders correctly\r\n# Stop Confluence\r\n# Upgrade to Confluence 5.7.1\r\n# Go back to the page created in step 3\r\n\r\nh3.

Actual behavior\r\n'Unable to render The included page could not be found' is displayed instead of the blog post's contents\r\n\r\nh3. Related Notes\r\n* If you look at the storage format you can tell the difference in how blog posts are linked:\r\n** Confluence 5.4.4\r\n*** {code}<p><ac:structured-macro ac:name=\"include\"><ac:parameter ac:name=\"\"><ac:link><ri:page ri:content-title=\"2015/03/11/This is a blog post\" /></ac:link></ac:parameter></ac:structured-macro></p>{code}\r\n** Confluence 5.7.1\r\n*** {code}<p><ac:structured-macro ac:name=\"include\"><ac:parameter ac:name=\"\"><ac:link><ri:blog-post ri:content-title=\"This is a blog post\" ri:posting-day=\"2015/03/11\" /></ac:link></ac:parameter></ac:structured-macro></p>{code}\r\n* It looks like there should be an upgrade job that finds existing include-page macros and convert them to the new format, and it either doesn't exist or is not working.\r\n\r\nh3.
