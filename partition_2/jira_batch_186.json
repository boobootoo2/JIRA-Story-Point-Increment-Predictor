I've listened to their arguments. However, based on years of experience, I submit that the inability to have multiple backlogs for a single project is stifling progress.\r\n\r\nOnce created, the purists can select one backlog anyway.. either way they will be happy. But for the many of us who move in and out of the box, we're limited in our planning and deployment. Time is wasted when a backlog simply becomes too large, and takes too long to sift through for Sprint planning, and in the end, we end up using an external tool anyway. So, either way, we are going to use multiple backlogs, and it would be preferable to have them all in the one location.\u00a0",

The answers to their questions should be made into user attributes.\u00a0\r\n\r\n2) Place Drip Pixel (log in for Drip account sent to Philip) --> This pixel should be placed on every single page including every web flow page and every zoomer page. THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT! I will submit a ticket to Drip to see what advice they have for webflow.\u00a0\r\n\r\n3) Create user events --> Each subscriber should trigger an event for 1) Starting the form and 2) Submitting the form at a minimum. But I also want to know how many other pages they have viewed so that should be an attribute/event as well. Basically anything we consider an event in Mixpanel should also be one in drip.\u00a0\r\n\r\n4) Create User Attribute for custom tool URL --> I need to be able to include the subscriber's unique link to the plan they made with the tool in a lot of these email so please make sure that custom attribute is included.\u00a0\r\n\r\nLet me know if I can provide any guidance or clarification!\u00a0\r\n\r\nDrip Help Docs:\u00a0https://www.drip.co/docs",

This is because the resolved issues are considered as those which do not need to be worked on. However, there are cases where it was resolved by mistake. As JIRA Agile board removes it right away, the users often do not even noticed. This lead to having some issues missing off track. \r\n\r\nh5. Suggested Solution\r\nIt would be great to have built-in filter (perhaps at the left side panel of the board) to show the issues that get resolved outside active sprint (future sprint or backlog) that user or scrum master can refer to, to see if there is any issues resolved by mistake. Scrum master can reopen the case if the issues need to worked on.",

Summary\r\n\r\nStarting in JIRA 7.2.0, the issue detail view in boards became editable, per [JIRA+Software+7.2.x+release+notes|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRASOFTWARE/JIRA+Software+7.2.x+release+notes].\r\n\r\nWhen story points are being edited in this issue detail view, a info bubble with the text \"Story Points\" appears, which ends up appearing right on top of where the confirm check button is. While the bubble is present, you cannot click on the confirm check button (also where it overlaps with the cancel check button, the same thing will happen there). Moving the mouse will cause this to rapidly flash in and out of the screen, interfering with the user's ability to click either of these boxes.\r\n\r\nBetter visualized:\r\n [^Story_Points.mp4] \r\n\r\nh3. Environment\r\nJIRA 7.2.0 - JIRA 7.2.3\r\nFirefox 49.0.2\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n1. Ensure that Story Points are visible in the screens for the project(s) the board is configured with to ensure that the field will be editable\r\n2. Click the Estimate to try to edit the value inside\r\n3. Note the Story Points bubble popping up\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nThe bubble should not be showing when trying to click the button. The other fields that are editable on this screen all show a different bubble, \"Press Alt+s to submit this form\", and the bubble doesn't overlap with the buttons.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nThe bubble pops up, interfering with the buttons.\r\n \r\nh3. Notes\r\n\r\nThe severity of this behavior appears to be environment specific. I found that my success rate for clicking the button and avoiding the bubble was very high, but other environments may find that the bubble persists longer, appears more frequency, etc..\r\n\r\nh3.Workaround\r\n\r\nConfirm your edit using the Enter key on your keyboard instead of clicking the button.",

Problem Definition\r\n\r\nWithin JIRA, the current Development Panel will only list the number of Crucible reviews related to that issue in a single state (Open or Closed, etc).\u00a0\u00a0 However this will not give you the total number of reviews related to that issue directly on the page itself.\u00a0 For example\r\n\r\n1. 2 open reviews -> OK\r\n 2. 2 closed reviews - > OK\r\n 3. 1 open review and 1 closed review -> Only lists the 1 open review\r\n\r\nGranted when you click on that link the popup window will show you all the review and their states correctly.\u00a0 The problem is that the the development panel within JIRA is limiting what information it provides here.\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nIt would be helpful if you could see the total number of reviews, and all the states/status of them without having to click on the review link.\r\nh3. Why this is important\r\n\r\nA related bug, -JSW-13607-, touched on this behavior, but was ultimately closed as 'cannot reproduce'.\u00a0\u00a0 However from reading a comment from Matthew Watson, it makes it seem like this particular aspect (the total issues listed in the panel) is by design:\r\n{quote}Also note that the count on the development panel is not the total count, it is only the count of reviews/pull-requests/builds that are in a given state (open/merged/failing/ etc.)\r\n{quote}\r\nQuoted comment from -JSW-13607-\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n!developmentpanel1.png|thumbnail!",

      "description": "h3. Problem Definition:\r\nIf a board's filter query is changed so that it shows issues from a different project, and that new project's workflow does not contain the statuses set up in the board configuration, they will not be usable. This is a problem for any user who wants to set up a board ONCE, and copy it to use it for other projects without having to do much extra work.\r\n\r\nh3. Suggestion Solutions:\r\n1. When a board has statuses that do not belong to the project it is showing issues from, provide a button along the lines of \"Add these statuses to the project [Project Name]\" to quickly add all missing statuses to that project's workflow. The user can already do this one status at a time with the \"Add Status\" button, so this new button would simply automate that process.\r\n\r\n2. When a board has statuses that do not belong to the project it is showing issues from, provide a button on each status that does not belong (And therefore has a yellow exclamation mark symbol) which lets the user quickly add that status to the project it is missing from.\r\n\r\n3. Allow the user to assign a different workflow to a board, WITHOUT turning off the \"Simplified Workflow\" features. This way the user can set up ONE workflow, point all of their boards at it, and they'll all have the same statuses available, but they can also carry on adding statuses/columns simply. This will, of course, add those same statuses to all the linked boards, so a warning will need to be shown to this effect.",

This will result in a timeout as per the attached screenshot.\r\nProblem is caused by slow response to call {{rest/greenhopper/1.0/rapidviews/viewsData}} from JIRA, which does resolving project list for each loaded board.\r\n\r\nh3. Environment\r\nReproduced with the following instance size:\r\n* Projects: 1k+\r\n* Boards: 1k+\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Use a large instance, such as above.\r\n# Access the *All boards* page\r\n\r\nh3.

Summary\r\n\r\nStarting in JIRA 7.2.0, the issue detail view in boards became editable, per [JIRA+Software+7.2.x+release+notes|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRASOFTWARE/JIRA+Software+7.2.x+release+notes].\r\n\r\nWhen story points are being edited in this issue detail view, a info bubble with the text \"Story Points\" appears, which ends up appearing right on top of where the confirm check button is. While the bubble is present, you cannot click on the confirm check button (also where it overlaps with the cancel check button, the same thing will happen there). Moving the mouse will cause this to rapidly flash in and out of the screen, interfering with the user's ability to click either of these boxes.\r\n\r\nBetter visualized:\r\n [^Story_Points.mp4] \r\n\r\nh3. Environment\r\nJIRA 7.2.0 - JIRA 7.2.3\r\nFirefox 49.0.2\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n1. Ensure that Story Points are visible in the screens for the project(s) the board is configured with to ensure that the field will be editable\r\n2. Click the Estimate to try to edit the value inside\r\n3. Note the Story Points bubble popping up\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nThe bubble should not be showing when trying to click the button. The other fields that are editable on this screen all show a different bubble, \"Press Alt+s to submit this form\", and the bubble doesn't overlap with the buttons.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nThe bubble pops up, interfering with the buttons.\r\n \r\nh3. Notes\r\n\r\nThe severity of this behavior appears to be environment specific. I found that my success rate for clicking the button and avoiding the bubble was very high, but other environments may find that the bubble persists longer, appears more frequency, etc..\r\n\r\nh3.Workaround\r\n\r\nConfirm your edit using the Enter key on your keyboard instead of clicking the button.",

In order to do so, it receives list of completed estimates with timestamps when they was completed, start time, end time and list of issues completed in specified period.\r\n\r\nFor some reason, \"end time\" is in future. 24 hours in future. I tried to changed it to simple \"now\" value, but then everything falls apart.\r\nAlso for some reason for one completed estimate this method receives list of 3 estimates.\r\nFirst estimate equals zero. Second estimate is the real estimate and the third one is fake estimate, just a copy of second estimate (please, somebody, shoot me).\r\n\r\nAnyhow, the algorithm works in that way that it adds completed estimate only for previous days, not for \"today\". But it counts working days for every day it iterates.\r\n\r\nLooking at at the picture:\r\n[^image_2016-12-01_18-21-14.png]\r\nJIRA Agile starts with \"start\" date, which is midnight of current day, today is working day, so it increases number of working days. Working Days = 1. \r\nNext, it takes first completed estimate from the list, checks if it happened \"last day\", it this case it is didn't, so it skips it (but that doesn't matter because first completed estimate is zero anyway).\r\nNow, JIRA Agile goes further through time (not through space, though >_<), by adding 24 hours to \"start\" value. Next, JIRA increases number of working days by 1. So there is 2 working days already.\r\nAfter that, JIRA takes a completed estimate from list of completed estimates, and thinks that it happened \"yesterday\", so it adds amount of completed estimate to \"Total Amount Of Completed Estimate\". It is still zero though. But we have 3 completed estimates in the list. So JIRA just takes next completed estimate and adds it to Total Completed Estimate. This time it was 1d (8 hours), so Total Completed Estimate = 1 day. Now it takes 3d and last completed estimate. It compares it with completed issues in \"seriesDataPoints\" list and understands that we've already added this estimate, because it the same estimate as estimate 2 in this list (really, somebody, shoot me already), so it skips it.\r\nOk, next cycle, next day, JIRA adds 24 more hours to \"start\" value and understands that it bigger than \"end\" value, so it considers that everything is done.\r\n\r\nSo, we have that JIRA thinks that there are *2* working days and there is only *1* day of completed estimate. This leads to predicted velocity of *4* hours a day instead of *8* hours a day and makes predicted completion day 2 times further in future that it is in reality.\r\n\r\n\u00a0",
