They used to work, though we had a problem some time ago where the size of the export was too large, which we fixed by expanding the memory limits for the java process.  (That problem, if I remember correctly, had an out-of-memory error that we're not getting this time.)\r\n\r\nWhen I initiate one from the xmlrpc interface (using the same code which we have been using to initiate space exports for quite some time) I get a successful intermediate HTML export, and then the folowing error:\r\n\r\nxmlrpclib.Fault: <Fault 0: \"java.lang.Exception: com.atlassian.confluence.rpc.RemoteException: Exception thrown while rendering the page 'Windows_InChild Path Error_Statewide_Campus' to the PDF document /opt/ole/data/confluence/temp/pdfexport-20140520-200514-1053-215/ITSACADSCAN-200514-1053-216.pdf\">\r\n\r\nI tried exporting that page only and it works fine.  I tried adding a new page to the space that I thought would come before that one in the export (to see if it was failing at a certain-sized export) but it still failed at the same page.  I tried exporting the space from the web interface, and the HTML intermediate again worked, but the PDF export seemed to silently fail - the \"Exporting\" tab on my browser just changed itself to the dashboard.  It left behind, on the server, in a temp directory, an artifact file that does not open with a pdf reader.  (And which is too large to attach here.)  I tried exporting the space from the web interface, doing a Custom export, and excluding the page that it fails on; this just caused it to fail while rendering a different page, though leaving a message this time:\r\n\r\nFailed during PDF export.

This is because the space has anonymous access but Confluence does not have global anonymous access.\r\n\r\nThis happens because the entity links are discovered by querying for all viewable spaces (only considering space permissions) then checking if the spaces is viewable (which does consider global access).\r\n\r\nSee: https://ecosystem.atlassian.net/browse/AC-1079\r\n\r\nThe fix is to change the query used when entity links are discovered to include the permission check.\r\n\r\nSee: https://ecosystem.atlassian.net/browse/AC-1079?focusedCommentId=128546&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-128546",

For example, we could search for a user specified in the user-profile macro on various pages. When a user leaves the company, we want to be able to find and fix these references in that macro. However, this is no longer possible in Confluence. There was a plugin available that might have worked for this (https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.atlassian.confluence.plugins.confluence-macro-indexer-plugin), but it is no longer supported as of Confluence 4.3.7. (We are currently on 5.2.5 and planning to move to 5.4.4 soon). So this is a feature request for the ability to search for macro attributes. I would envision the search syntax to be something like:\r\nmacroName:<name>* macroAttribute:<attribute> \r\nThanks for your consideration.",

Example:\r\n\r\nTo import text files keeping the file's layout:\r\nAdd the tag {{<pre>}} at the beginning of the file and close this tag with {{</pre>}} at the end.\r\nIn case you are using Unix like environment, this job can be done to all files inside a specific directory using the following command line:\r\n1. Go to the directory where the files are in.\r\n2.

When using the Confluence shortcut in a table cell which is using a macro (e.g.: expand macro), pasting the content in another section of the table, the macro\u2019s content is pasted into another cell, instead of remaining inside the macro; whereas when using the O.S. shortcut it does not happen and the content remains inside the cell.\r\n\r\n*Steps to reproduce:*\r\n\u20281. Create a table in a Confluence page (e.g.: 4x4).\u2028\r\n2. Select a table cell which is not in the heading row, and insert the expand macro with some content.\r\n\u20283. Cut this row and past it into a different section of the table using the Confluence shortcut. \r\n!TableCutCopyPaste.png!\r\n\r\n!before.png!\r\n\r\n*Actual Results:* The contents of the expand macro are pasted into another table cell.\r\n!after.png!\r\n\r\n*\u2028Expected Results:* The expand macro contents should remain inside of the expand macro.\r\n\r\nThis behaviour *does not happen if you use the O.S. shortcut (cmd/ctrl + x/c and cmd/ctrl + v)*, only when using the Confluence shortcuts.\r\nThe same behaviour happens with other macros. e.g.: Section Macro, Column Macro, Info Macro, etc.",

It was working for a few weeks. But about 3 weeks ago, I noticed that some of the features are missing and some of the features are listed twice.\r\nExample: AMT2.0/Revamp - which is the last on this list (https://confluence.iparadigms.com/display/VIS/Cross-Prioritization+Dashboard)\u2026\r\n\r\n(see attachment Conf1)\r\n\r\n\r\nDoes not appear on the expert-include page (https://confluence.iparadigms.com/display/VIS/Current+Train+Assignments?moved=true) at all:\r\n   \r\n(see attachment Conf2)\r\n\r\nYou'll also note that \"Exclude match/phrase\" is listed twice. (Top and bottom of the 2nd picture)\r\n\r\n(see attachment Conf3)\r\n\r\nBug #2)\r\nIn the 2nd column, there is an adhoc board with title \"New Board\". When you move pages up and down in the list, the ordering used to be preserved, even after you refreshed. But now, if you move the pages, and refresh, the ordering (or priority that we use this board for) is not preserved and goes back to a different ordering. \r\n\r\nThis priority preservation and planning boards are vital to our planning process, so we really need these fixed!\r\n",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFCLOUD-33633].\n  {panel}\n\nI have a +feature request+ for a new option in the notifications settings (for Jira and Confluence): Only notfiy the user of the first change and mute notifications until the user opened the page/issue. This will reduce too much notifications in a short time frame. This is better than a daily summary and the user is still immediately informed of a change. \r\n\r\nAfter a little bit of brainstorming with a colleague about this feature request we came up with an +even better idea with a different approach+: Some kind of delayed summary notification: The change that would normally trigger a notifcation could be delayed by a custom period of time in hours (1 to 24h). In that period of time all changes of one Confluence-page or Jira-issue will be summarized and sent to the user after the period ends. For this to work, every page or issue needs an internal value for the time remaining. Short delays wouldn\u2019t hurt the response time of a developer. Making this an option in the notification settings panel gives the user full flexibility how (s)he wants to be informed about progress in the project.",

There are a number of reasons we made the decision to discontinue personal tasks, including the fact that we weren't seeing the sort of usage and engagement metrics to justify building this into the task enhancements in Confluence 5.5.  We're not trying to solve the personal task management problem - there are a lot of great tools for that - rather we are focused on team collaboration and we see contextual tasks as a way of enabling that.\r\n\r\nWe realize that some users valued the ability to track personal tasks in Confluence alongside team tasks, so we recommend creating a restricted page with these tasks instead.  That way they will also be captured in the new Tasks view.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nNatasha Prasad\r\n{panel}",
