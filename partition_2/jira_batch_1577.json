Expected Behavior\r\n\r\n- Upon browsing to the Child of Restricted Page in the above scenario, I encounter a \"Request Access\" prompt.\r\n- Below is a screenshot of what the expected behavior looks like if a child page has restrictions but a parent page is unrestricted.\r\n- Note: It is irrelevant how I got a link to the child page for the purposes of this bug. It could be linked in another page's content, or permissions manipulation may have temporarily exposed the page, etc.\r\n\r\n !restricted-parent-request.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\nh3. Actual Behavior\r\n\r\n- I am informed that I do not have permissions to view the page.\r\n- Below is a screenshot of what viewing the child page looks like as a user that has view/edit access to its restricted parent. The child page also has restrictions, as noted in the top two screenshots of this ticket.\r\n\r\n !restricted-denied.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\nh3. Pre-requisites\r\n\r\n- You must have two users: one that has the ability to create pages and edit permissions, and a separate user to test the 'Request Access' function\r\n- You must have a configured mail server (Request Access will not appear if you have no mail server configured.)\r\n- The \"Confluence Request Access\" bundled plugin must be enabled.\r\n\r\nh3. Observations\r\n\r\n- This behavior was encountered on 6.3.3 and 6.4.3.\r\n- Prior to 6.3.3, we have received customer reports where this worked differently. Users were able to Request Access to child pages.\r\n-- One customer reported they did not encounter this issue (anecdotally) from 6.2.4 and prior. It was only noticed after upgrading to 6.3.3.\r\n- This only happens when *both* the Parent and Child pages have restrictions set to them. If a user has permissions to view a parent page and the child is set to 'no restrictions', they are able to view the page normally without requesting access.",

      "description": "h4. Suggestion Description\r\nIt has been painful for customers with large dataset to migrate from an external database to another, for example, migrate from MySQL to PostgreSQL. The [current process|https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/migrating-to-another-database-148867.html] consists of taking an XML backup and importing it to an empty instance pointing to the new database and then, after import is done, point the existing instance to the new database. Problem here is that XML Backups for large instances may take days and during these days, new data is being written to the instance, since huge instances can't be turned into read-only instances. It would be a *major win* for Atlassian customers to have a Migration Wizard Tool to transport data from one database to another through Confluence UI.\r\n\r\nh4. Suggestion Details\r\nBitBucket is an application that has this implementation and that allows administrators to easily migrate from one external database to another. Process is documented in the [Using the Database Migration Wizard|https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/connecting-bitbucket-server-to-an-external-database-776640378.html] BitBucket documentation. As this seems to be an implementation unrelated to the application itself, it may be possible to implement the same solution in other Atlassian applications, like Confluence.\r\n\r\nh4. Suggestion Importance\r\nCustomers with huge datasets usually end up by developing their own solutions when upon the need of migrating to a different database, which turns into a project at their side that has costs and may turn into frustration using our tools. It would be a *{color:red}major win{color}* for everyone using Confluence to have this feature.\r\n\r\nh4. BitBucket Wizard Example\r\n!migrating.png|thumbnail!",

Environment\r\n * Any version of Confluence\r\n * Running behind Apache reverse proxy in this example\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Go to *Cog Icon > Backup and Restore*\r\n # Start a backup of the instance\r\n # Wait a few minutes (until the proxy timeout is reached)\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nBackup is completed with no error message.\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nThe following error will be presented to the user:\r\n\r\n!Screen Shot 2017-11-08 at 4.37.01 PM.png|thumbnail!\r\nh3. Notes\r\n\r\nThis error happens because the full site backup procedure does not have a progress bar to indicate the state of the operation. When the backup is started, the browser keeps waiting for the backup to complete as in the following screenshot (notice Waiting for host message at the lower left corner of the screen):\r\n\r\n!Screen Shot 2017-11-08 at 4.36.38 PM.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nIf the instance is fairly large, the backup will take longer than the proxy timeout configured and result in the Proxy Error message shown previously. This is because there is no response from the application while the backup is being created.\r\n\r\nNotice that the backup operation is not impacted. If you wait a for its completion, the backup will be available either in *<confluence-home>/backups* or *<confluence-home>/temp*. However, we do not have any indication of the process\u00a0state besides checking if the backup file stopped growing and is zipped in the directory above.\r\n\r\nA possible solution would be having a progress bar to this process, as we have for the XML import procedure.\r\n\r\nThis also affects other types of exports, like PDF ones.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\n(!) Increasing the proxy timeout is not feasible as the backup can take hours to complete\r\n # The first workaround is to wait for the backup to complete by checking <confluence-home>/temp. Once the file stops growing and a .zip file is created, the backup should be completed\r\n # The second workaround is to bypass the proxy and trigger the backup",

      "description": "h3. Summary\r\nwe have developed a plugin where we listen for an AbstractLikeEvent. When it occurs, we want to use the BandanaManager to persist values in the database. This works before Confluence 6. Since Confluence 6, we can't save the information in the Bandana anymore. The (debug) log says, that it has saved the given information successfully in our own context, but when we are trying to get the keys for the specific context, it returns 0 items (although it said that the process was successful). After we have found the issue, we tried several Confluence versions. In Confluence 5 the BandanaManager works totally fine and as expected, but since Confluence 6 (until the latest version 6.5) the functionality seems to be broken. This problem only occurs when we are listening for AbstractLikeEvent's. When you try the same with e.g. a CommentCreateEvent, it works as expected (we set a value in our context and then fetch the keys from the BandanaManager). To make the issue more clear to you, we have prepared a minimal example plugin, where we are listening for the previously mentioned event and then try to save a value and get the Bandana keys. Please have a look in the example and try to reproduce the problem.\r\n\r\nh3.

Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Stop Confluence\r\n # Change {{<confluence_install>/confluence/WEB-INF/web.xml}} on each node as follows (Set session-timeout to 1 min):\r\n{code:java}\r\n<session-config>\r\n  <session-timeout>1</session-timeout>\r\n</session-config>\r\n{code}\r\n\r\n # Start Confluence\r\n\r\nh4.

Actual Results\r\n\r\nSession timeout never occurs, and the user remains logged into the application.\r\nh2. Workaround\r\n\r\n*Option 1:*\r\n\r\nConfigure the maximum age of the 'remember me' cookie per: [Confluence Cookies|https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/confluence-cookies-160794071.html] by the following methods:\r\n # Edit {{<confluence_install>/confluence/WEB-INF/classes/seraph-config.xml}} and add:\r\n{code:java}\r\n<!-- session-timeout remember-me cookie timer -->\r\n<init-param>\r\n\t<param-name>autologin.cookie.age</param-name>\r\n\t<param-value>1800</param-value><!-- 30 minutes in seconds -->\r\n</init-param>\r\n{code}\r\n\r\n # Implementing this on all nodes, then restarting the whole cluster seems to force the session-timeout to work as expected.\r\n\r\n*Option 2:*\r\n\r\nDisable the automatic remember me on DC clusters, this allows the end user to decide to have a Tomcat short session or Seraph long session but the user may need to login in again on a new node.\r\n # Stop Confluence\r\n # Go to Confluence installation directory\r\n # Locate the\u00a0{{<CONFLUENCE-INSTALLATION>/confluence/login.vm}}\u00a0file and make a backup copy\r\n # Edit the file\r\n # Locate the following section of code:\r\n{code:java}\r\n#if ($action.shouldRememberMeCheckboxBeOmitted())\r\n    <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"os_cookie\" value=\"true\"/>\r\n#else\r\n    #bodytag( \"Component\" \"label='remember.accesskey'\" \"name='os_cookie'\" \"value='false'\" \"theme='aui'\" \"template='onofflist.vm'\") #end\r\n#end\r\n{code}\r\n\r\n # Modify the above code as follows\r\n{code:java}\r\n#bodytag( \"Component\" \"label='remember.accesskey'\" \"name='os_cookie'\" \"value='false'\" \"theme='aui'\" \"template='onofflist.vm'\") #end\r\n{code}\r\n\r\n # Save the file and restart Confluence\r\n # Repeat the above steps each time you install a new version of Confluence",

Use Case\r\n\r\n{quote}\r\nOur Confluence is in a firewalled network.\u00a0 It allows us to send out emails but all attachments are stripped.\u00a0 This results in users receiving an email with a lot of broken image links, poor formatting, and a bunch of attachments that just say \"sending attachments not allowed\".\r\n\r\nMy goal is to edit the email templates to remove all {{img}}\u00a0tags, thus preserving formatting, eliminating broken image links and the user wouldn't see any warnings from our IT dept about trying to send attachments.\r\n\r\nWe've been changing the soy templates in {{confluence-email-notifications-plugin-8.4.6.jar}}\u00a0as explained at [Customizing Email Templates|https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/customizing-email-templates-168001822.html].\u00a0 After much trial and error, we've been able to eliminate the {{img}} tags from these files.\u00a0 We ignored the {{\\*\\-1.0.0.soy}} ones as we believe they are deprecated.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that the notification for page creations still sends an email with three attached images:\r\n{code}\r\nconfluence-email-resources_view-page-email-adg-footer-item_icon.png\r\nconfluence-email-resources_add-comment-to-content-email-adg-footer-item_icon.png confluence-like_view-email-adg-content-item_icon.png\r\n{code}\r\nLooking at the source of the email, we don't see any {{img}} tags referencing these icons so we don't know why it tries to attach them.\u00a0\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nh3. Suggestion\r\n\r\n- Administrators would like to have an option in Confluence to strip images out of emails that the notification system sends out while still retaining other HTML elements such as links to the appropriate content. This would be to respect IT security policies where images are not allowed due to network restrictions.\r\n- A plain-text option for emails would also suffice, as this would accomplish the same desired end goal of stripping images out of notification emails. However, the lack of HTML elements would impact usability for those emails.",

This is the default configuration with a reverse proxy, and a good choice if you do not want to open port 8091. SSL should be terminated at your reverse proxy.\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nWe seem to be telling customers that they will need to use the internal Synchrony proxy when running behind a proxy. But if customers follow our documentation to run behind Apache or nginx, they won't need the internal proxy. So this quote is somewhat confusing.\r\n\r\nPerhaps we should clarify the quote above by letting customers know that they can either set up their proxy to use the internal proxy, or they can set up their proxy with specific Synchrony cconfigurations that don't need require the internal proxy.\r\n\r\n",
