Though I haven't used it much, it seems to get us most if not all the information we could want/need to start resolving a problem situation:\r\n\r\nhttp://localhost:8080/confluence/admin/raisesupportrequest.action\r\n\r\n(The action that actually calls the request-creating action is called 'doraisesupportrequest.action'. The above action just displays the web page.)\r\n\r\nSometimes either Confluence is down completely or is just malfunctioning for any number of reasons (corrupt db) - it would be nice if i could tell a customer to just go into their 'bin' directory and run the 'raisesupportrequest.sh' script. The script might ask a quick question or two and then ask for confirmation that they wanted to submit a support request before actually sending the request. We might ask whether they want to use a configured mail server or the local mail user agent/mta (e.g. /usr/bin/mail), or even if they want us to zip the info packet into a zip on the filesystem that they could then get to us however they wanted.\r\n\r\nMaybe it's possible to try and re-use the RaiseSupportRequestAction.java class. Things we might have to do:\r\n1) Get path to java (using $JAVA_HOME, etc.)\r\n2) Set up classpath\r\n3) set up shell-script wrapper to ask at least one question ('Are you sure you want to submit a support request?').\r\n4) Possibly do the add-on question for asking about which mail client/server to use.\r\n\r\nThis makes support easier on the end user, makes the Support Department more efficient (b/c we get the info we need, and we get it quickly, without spending time on the phone), and should ultimately make us more effective.\r\n\r\nIn theory, this could be relatively easy to accomplish.",

Again, any change you make would be persistent, by default, so using the 'Add Entry' button, for instance, would create/update a logging level that is changed immediately for runtime, but also changed permanently.\r\n\r\nAnd this 'changes are persisted by default' philosophy would hold for the whole page - profiling, logging, etc.\r\n",

Perhaps it would be good to show a field along the lines of 'created by' or 'modified by' beside each match.\r\n\r\nTo go a step further, author filtering will match a document if the author entered made any change to any version. e.g. cmonger changed version 3 only of a document that is now at version 25. Even when clicking on the hit it may not be obvious why this document has matched. Could we extend the display on the hit list with something like 'version 3 edited by cmonger'?
