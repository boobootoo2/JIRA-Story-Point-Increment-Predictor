Issue Summary\r\n\r\nIn Confluence, by going to the site's administration, there is an option called *Macro Usage* to get a link for the list of pages using specific macros or installed ones that are not being used.\r\n\r\nBy tapping each of the links, Confluence is redirected to a search including the pages using specific macros. However, in this case, instead of displaying the pages, the search is empty.\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # As an administrator, tap the cog icon at the top right (or *Settings* in the sidebar)\r\n # Select *Macro usage* from the administration sidebar.\r\n # Tap one of the links pointing to a macro.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nThe search should display a list of pages that uses the macro which the administrator has access to.\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nThe link redirects to an empty search:\r\n\r\n!empty.png|thumbnail!\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nCurrently, there is no known workaround for this behavior.

      "description": "{panel:title=Status Update 28 July 2021|borderStyle=solid|borderColor=#ff7f7f|titleBGColor=#ff7f7f|bgColor=#e5e5e5}\r\nHi all,\r\n\r\nThis is Ethan from the Atlassian Editor Team. Thank you for the continuous feedback on performance improvement needs within the Confluence editing experience. Over the past 12 months, Atlassian teams have been improving our monitoring capabilities to detect performance degradation and updating various parts of the backend architecture to improve 2 issues of primary concern outlined in our last update:\u00a0*keyboard typing performance*\u00a0and\u00a0*frozen pages*. As a result, editing input latency spike has dropped from 274ms at p99 to 80ms from November 2020 to July 2021. Similarly, fewer customers are citing frozen pages while trying to edit pages.\r\n\r\nNonetheless, we recognise there is still plenty of ground to cover on making our products faster.\u00a0*New themes*\u00a0are emerging in the more recent customer reports, so we will deprecating this ticket by splitting it into the following to better track different performance degradations:\r\n||Theme||Ticket||\r\n|1. Slowness rendering Non-Content PAGE FEATURES when\u00a0VIEWING a Confluence page\u00a0|[CONFCLOUD-72517|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFCLOUD-72517]|\r\n|2. Slowness rendering IN-PAGE CONTENT when VIEWING a large Confluence page|[CONFCLOUD-72518|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFCLOUD-72518]|\r\n|3. Slowness initially rendering a large Confluence page in EDIT mode|[CONFCLOUD-72519|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFCLOUD-72519]|\r\n|4. Keyboard typing delays while trying to EDIT a Confluence page|[CONFCLOUD-72520|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFCLOUD-72520]|\r\n|5. Changes are lost and unsaved after EDITING a Confluence page|[CONFCLOUD-72521|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFCLOUD-72521]|\r\n|6. Inability or delay of publishing EDITS to a Confluence page|[CONFCLOUD-72522|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFCLOUD-72522]|\r\n\r\n\r\nAtlassian teams will focus upcoming efforts to\u00a0*actively address themes 1-3*, which involves optimising the performance of the base editor and renderer components. This should improve the time-to-interact for both the page editing and viewing experiences in Confluence for all types of pages. Following this, we will narrow our focus on optimising the performance of specific page elements when editing pages with large amounts of content, including tables, macros, and other media.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, we will\u00a0*continue to monitor issues*\u00a0related to\u00a0*themes 4-6*. To improve both the viewing and editing speeds of large pages, we still recommend\u00a0*splitting up the page into multiple pages*\u00a0for a more performant experience.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n*We aim to provide the next update on our progress by Dec 2021.*\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThanks all and stay safe,\r\n\r\nEthan\r\n{panel}\r\n{panel:title=Status Update 29 September 2020}\r\nHello all,\r\n\r\nAs we've reviewed your feedback on the slowness you're experiencing, we're noticing three different categories:\r\n # Frozen page while trying to EDIT the page on the New Editor\r\n # Keyboard typing delays while tying to EDIT the page on the New Editor\r\n # Slowness in initial page LOAD or RENDER on the New Editor\r\n\r\nThese three categories are caused by different mechanisms. To help us better debug the what type of experience you're facing, we will be tracking 1 & 2 on this ticket. If you're experiencing 3, please follow this separate bug: https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFCLOUD-70858\r\n\r\nIf you are instead experiencing issues with the edit performance on the Legacy Editor, please follow\u00a0https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFCLOUD-70970\r\n\r\nBest,\r\n\r\nSunny Xu\r\n{panel}\r\n{panel:title=Status Update 5 August 2020}\r\nHey all,\r\n\r\nThank you for the continuous feedback on performance improvement needs within the Confluence editing experience. Over the next 12 months, Atlassian teams will be delivering incremental improvements to performance by updating various parts of the backend architecture. These improvements include ones around typing performance, and we anticipate a faster response compared to the current delay between keystrokes.\r\n\r\nBecause not all performance issues stem from the same cause, we are aggregating potentially disparate issues within this ticket. We can continue to do so with your help in providing additional details on what your page contains. If you are able to remove elements and see performance improvements, sharing that information can help us narrow our focus on key elements that are slowing page performance. Thank you for your help and continued feedback to improve the editing experience!\r\n\r\nBest,\r\n\r\nSunny Xu\r\n{panel}\r\nh3. \u00a0\r\nh3. Issue Summary\r\n\r\nWe released multiple fixes to address\u00a0https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFCLOUD-65329, and this bug tracks any new reports of page performance issues. These issues may be caused by\u00a0a large number of tables with data.\r\nh3. Environment\r\n * Fabric Editor (Confluence new editor)\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Create a la page with 10+ tables each with around 10-20 rows\r\n # Notice that the performance of the table was slow while inserting some text to the table.\r\n # Page load times vastly increase\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nPerformance of the table should be stabilized while inserting text on the tables.\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nDegraded performance while editing page and intermittent inability to save.\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nTry removing elements on the page or splitting up the page and see if that improves the editing speed. If you are able to remove elements and see performance improvements, please share as a comment to help us narrow our focus on key elements that are slowing page performance.",
