Some of my colleagues were asking, why such a innovative and easy to use system like conflunece isn't able to provide a eays copy/cut/past table button in their editor (it was really arkward trying to promote confluence in their departmant and failing to to copy a simple table)\r\n\r\nCopying or Cutting rows or collums isn't an option because you can't past them while not in a table (which you usually are not, when you want to cut/past a table on a different place of your site)\r\n\r\nI really appreciat your work and I am sure, that such a feature *would help many many users*! If you have any more questions, don't hessitate to contact me!\r\n\r\nBest wishes\r\n\r\nRaphael",

When I've had a page open for a while, and someone updates the page, a notification appears in the bottom right of the page suggesting I refresh the page to see the update(s). When that happens, is it possible the favicon could be updated to show that the page was updated?\r\n\r\nIn the rare cases when I have so few tabs I can see anything more than the icon (my usual use case is 35-50 tabs open in chrome, so sometimes I don\u2019t even have \r\nthe icons showing), I can see the (#) in the tab title, but this request is to update the icon like gmail does for unread emails (it\u2019s buried in the gmail options somewhere):\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve seen other websites that do this too for things where count matters, but I can\u2019t think of them right now. Twitter maybe?\r\nAn icon change to show there was an update without a count would be good enough since I don\u2019t really care how many updates the page has gotten, just that it has been updated or not since I last read it.",

While this is not a problem at all for few macros it does not scale well for pages with a lot of macros.\r\nInstead of an {{ArrayList}} a {{HashSet}} or any other collection class with a fast {{contains()}} implementation should be used here.\r\n\r\nIn our case a customer had almost 600 macros on a single page (the table related macros of the 'Content Formatting Macros' plugin were used to create a *large* table) and the collision detection caused an extreme slowdown when calling {{xhtmlContent.updateMacroDefinitions()}} for this page (several minutes).\r\n\r\nWe currently work around this by injecting a {{List}} implementation backed by a {{HashSet}} into the conversion context before using {{xhtmlContent.updateMacroDefinitions()}}. This sped up the execution from several minutes to few seconds.",

A space administrator should set the space icon to represent the same image that is supplied in the MDM web clip payload, so that when the web clip is opened, the icon does not change. This allows multiple web clips to be supplied to users' iDevices pointing to different spaces.",

Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Install Confluence Data Center 5.9.5 cluster including 2 nodes\r\n# Install JIRA Software 7.0.5\r\n# Generate an Application Link between the JIRA and the CDC\r\n# Create a page with JIRA Issue Macro in Confluence\r\n# Access to the page by using jMeter or so forth (I used jMeter with 10 parallel threads and infinite loop count)\r\n# Measure the traffic between the nodes by dstat command (specifically \"dstat -n -N <interface>\" command)\r\n# You'll find the traffic is much larger (In my case, the traffic was about 50Mbps):\r\n-- much larger than the case when accessing a page without JIRA Issue Macro (In my case, the traffic was about 250Kbps)\r\n-- much larger than the case when accessing the same page in Confluence Data Center 5.7.5, which is the version that the customer is currently using (In my case, the traffic was about 250Kbps)\r\n# As a result, CPU usage is also increased, though the CPU % does not grow disastrously severe\r\n\r\n(i) I confirmed the traffic was hazelcast 5801 port, by creating a separate network interface only for the hazelcast traffic.

A split brain scenario occurs where one node (eg node1) is no longer part of the original cluster but is still operating with its own part of the distributed hazelcast cache. If this occurs, and node1's portion of the distributed cache did not contain the cluster safety number, it will write a new one to the database, and to its own cache (but not to nodes 2 or 3's cache). When nodes 2 or 3 next run cluster safety, the numbers will exist in both the db and their own hazelcast cache, but they will not match. This causes a cluster panic event to be thrown, taking down the larger portion of the cluster, and leaving a single node in operation. If the single node cannot handle the amount of load it has to pick up, as is sometimes the case, this can cause a complete outage.",

Pain Point:\r\nToday, if you bookmark a confluence page, it saves the confluence page based on the name of the page title, such as \"Dummy+test+page\".\r\n\r\nHowever, if someone changes the title of the page, the bookmark link is basically broken.  If you bookmarked it, or sent that link to someone else via email, you can't find it directly.  Confluence fortunately has a way to ask you if you really were looking for this other page, but I think that's an unnecessary step.\r\n\r\nh4. Proposed Solution\r\nSince you already keep a permanent unique link for each confluence page regardless of the page title (that's revealed via Control + k), why not just use that as the browser url instead of the one based on the page title?\r\n",
