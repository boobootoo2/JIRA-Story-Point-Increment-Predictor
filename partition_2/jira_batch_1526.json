The root cause of the issue is a problem in the browser's implementation of the spell check functionality.\r\n\r\nThis spell check bug is being tracked by the Chromium team at [Issue 1271918: InputMethodController::GetImeTextSpans() is too slow when editable having many spelling errors \\- Chromium|https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1271918]\r\n\r\nWe would encourage you to watch that bug for more detailed updates.\r\n{panel}\r\nh3. Problem\r\nEditing Large Confluence page is extremely slow in browsers built upon *Chromium Version 96* and *Chromium Version 97 Beta* builds. \r\n\r\nChromium is the underlying browser engine in the below browsers and many others\r\n* Google Chrome \r\n* New Microsoft Edge\r\n* Brave \r\n* Vivaldi\r\n\r\nA full list of browsers based on Chromium can be viewed at [Chromium (web browser) \\- Wikipedia|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromium_(web_browser)#Browsers_based_on_Chromium]\r\n\r\nh3. Environment\r\nTested with Confluence DC / Server version *7.13.2* and *7.14.1*\r\n\r\nThe following browser versions are known to be impacted\r\n* Chrome version 96.0.4664.45 (Official Build) (64-bit)\r\n* Chrome version 96.0.4664.55 (Official Build)\r\n* Brave Version 1.32.106 Chromium: 96.0.4664.45\r\n* Edge Version 96.0.1054.34 (Official build) (64-bit)\r\n* Any other browsers using Chromium Build 96 or 97 Beta\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n * Create a large page in your Confluence instance\r\n * Edit the page in an affected browser\r\n ** (i) the issue is easily reproduced in *Incognito mode* as well\r\n * Try to add new content (text for example) and/or try to scroll up and down on the page\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n * Scrolling and adding content operations should stay responsive regardless of the content length\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n * It can take several seconds to browse and/or add new content efficiently on a large page\r\n * Scrolling up and down will result in the page content being rendered \"blanked\" for a couple of seconds\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n * Disable spell check on the browser settings\r\n * Downgrade Browser version\r\n * Use another browser which is not impacted.\r\n\r\nh3. Notes\r\n(i) Issue happens regardless if Collaborative Edition is switched ON or OFF\r\n\r\nConfluence Cloud users impacted by this issue can find the associated issue at: [CONFCLOUD\\-73213: Performance issues with Chrome 96 and Chrome 97 in Confluence editor|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFCLOUD-73213]",

How to replicate\r\n * JIRA 8.13.5\r\n * Confluence 7.13\r\n\r\n1) Create a project on JIRA and add a few issues (2 for example).\r\n2) Set the application links between Confluence and JIRA\r\n3) Create a new page in Confluence and add a JIRA issue macro using the project created on number 1 above.\r\n4) On the JIRA macro display options, select the *total issue count* display.\r\n5) Save the page.\r\n\r\nEditing the page with a single issue works fine. However, as we add more and more JIRA macros to the page with the \"total issue count\", the editor becomes slower each time.\r\n\r\nDisabling the collaborative editor does not help.\r\nThe issue happens with simple and complex JIRA macro filters.\r\nh3. Observed results\r\n\r\nEditing the same page with more JIRA macros produced the following results:\r\n\r\n1) Page with 10 JIRA issues = 5 seconds\r\n2) Page with 50 JIRA issues = 8 seconds\r\n3) Page with 100 JIRA issues = 12.6 seconds\r\n4) Page with 250 JIRA issues = 19.5 seconds\r\n\r\nAs the number of issues on a page increases, the time to edit also continues increasing.\r\n\r\nThis HAR shows the behavior when loading the editor:\r\n!HAR_loading_time.PNG|thumbnail!\r\nh3.

Problem Definition\r\nThere are some operations on which the Confluence backend server will need to make HTTP requests to its Base URL.\r\nAs an example, during PDF page export it will load some CSS files through HTTP requests _to itself_.\r\n\r\nIf there are additional security in the environment, such as enforced authentication through a Load Balancer, then those operations will be affected by it.\r\nFor the page PDF export example, if some CSS files are not properly loaded, then the PDF won't show the expected formatting.\r\n\r\nA visual example of this problem, when using the Info, Warning or Note macros, the PDF export won't render them properly as the image below.\r\nWhile the page looks normal from the browser:\r\n !screenshot-1.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\nThe PDF export won't render it correctly:\r\n !screenshot-2.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\nConfluence should be less dependent on requests to its own Base URL, loading resources through the Java API.\r\n\r\nh3.

Problem Definition\r\nIn *Confluence Server/Data Center*, there is no way to set a fixed width for the entire table, making it hard for the editor to align multiple tables in the same page nicely for easy reading.\r\nThis is because resizing each column's width would always impact the _maximum table width_ as shown in the screenshot below:\r\n !server resize width.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\nWhen there are more tables in one page, it quickly becomes a very tedious job for the editing person to align each of the tables in order to have the same column/table width if they'd want to have every table sharing the same width/layout.\r\n !server multiple tables.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\n\r\n*Confluence Cloud* on the other hand, always have the *Table Width* set to a fixed width so resizing the columns will not impact the maximum table width. This allows the editing person to be able to form a unified table structure across the entire page:\r\n !cloud resize table.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\nAllow editor to configure the width of each column and table so the editing person can easily unify the table structure using absolute numbers rather than dragging with the cursor.\r\n(i) Refers to the _Workaround_ below, but having a proper UI for this instead\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\nInstall [Source Editor|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1210722/confluence-source-editor?hosting=server&tab=overview] and edit the source manually to set *Table Width* and *Column Width*:\r\n !source editor.png|thumbnail! \r\n !edited result.png|thumbnail!
