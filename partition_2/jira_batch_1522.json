I then realised my mistake and immediately abandoned the duplicate review.\r\n\r\nI do understand now the Crucible icon will always create a new review but it wouldn't surprise me if others make the same initial mistake.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the review number link and create link could be somehow modified to prevent people misinterpreting them as a 'single navigational unit'. Or maybe an intermediate screen that appears when clicking the new review icon for revisions that already have a review.

I.e. too many open reviews, too many open for too long etc etc.  In the case of FishEye I want a report that tells me where the bottlenecks are. An obvious one is a report showing me the age of the reviews (i.e. the detail for the age chart). \r\n\r\nThe open reviews could be broken down by reviews where all reviewers are complete and those that have outstanding reviewers. The first would be split by moderator (as they are the bottleneck) and the second could be by reviewers that aren't complete. See dodgy mockup attached.\r\n\r\nThe point would be to identify the people responsible for the tardiness. Further filtering would help too (e.g. exclude reviews less than x days old etc). \r\n\r\n",
