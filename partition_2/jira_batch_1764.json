If the user only edits once or twice during the life of the browser process, then it's okay.  But if you're doing lots of content creation or editing, and therefore using the editor quite a bit, the memory consumption eventually becomes so great that system resources become an issue.\r\n\r\nI can demonstrate this problem by going to any page and clicking Edit, then cancelling to leave the editor.  Each time I do this, my Chrome process grows fairly dramatically.   \r\n\r\nIn an effort to put some numbers around it, I did some testing and created a spreadsheet, and from that I created a chart (attached).   The chart illustrates memory consumption (in MB) on IE vs Chrome, for successive editing sessions of the exact same page (a simple page that fits \"above the fold\")\r\n\r\nThat exercise made me realize that the problem is not _quite_ as bad as I thought, because the memory consumption does seem to level off in Chrome on a simple test, in which the same page is being edited again and again.\r\n\r\nIt would take me more time than I have right now to do a comprehensive test of a more realistic scenario, but I can assure you that, when you're editing multiple pages, and using multiple browser windows or tabs, you eventually start to get some amazing memory consumption -- around half a GB for a single process.   This definitely becomes noticeable.  And I'm not talking about hundreds of pages over the course of many hours.  Just a dozen or so pages for an hour or two,  a fairly normal amount of work for an active editor.\r\n\r\nThe memory consumption in Chrome is spectacular enough that I was certain this issue would already exist in JIRA.  I looked for one pretty hard, but did not find one.  If this turns out to be a duplicate, I apologize.",

The old UI didn't have a limited height for the edit page, so the diff appeared in full and it just pushed the editor down.

But to improve its usability I lack some features. \r\n\r\nI need a switch (button, checkbox, link) that hides finished tasks. I do not want to see them. It would be fine to show only open, only finished and both tasks.\r\n\r\nBoth finished and open tasks looks same, they can be distinguised only by the state of their checkboxes. So I propose to put CSS styles for finished tasks and make it by default italic/grey.\r\n\r\nThere are many other features, that would boost productivity of this feature. For example add labels to each task, filters by tasks, deadlines .. But for now I will be happy with hiding finished tasks.",

But while a space admin may configure security/permissions based on users identity or group membership, he doesn't have the ability to modify any group. This leads to use alternatives such as:\r\n - require the wiki main admin to add/remove user to/from groups each time\r\n - do the thing with individual people instead of groups\r\n\r\nI think local groups with space scope would be a nice improvement and would be really usefull. \r\n",

      "description": "Hi -\r\n\r\nOur company performed an upgrade to 4.1.9 maybe a month ago.  With that upgrade, links to Hansoft broke.  Instead of an underlined link, the upgrade removed the underline and placed the URL to the side of the link text in parenthesis.  For example:\r\n\r\nMy Link Text (hansoft://blah.com:111/Task/222)\r\n\r\nThe raw editor was removed with one of the upgrades, so I used the WYSIWYG to repair the link.  While initially in \"Edit mode\", I could left-click the link and I navigate by clicking the \"Goto link\" button.  But once I saved the page, I could never click on the link for navigation purposes again.\r\n\r\nTo be clear - this behavior used to work fine in a previous version of Confluence.\r\n\r\nI feel that the root of the problem is that Confluence does not recognize \"hansoft://\" as a valid URL/link prefix.\r\n\r\nI am seeking three actions:\r\n1. A permanent fix to the issue where Confluence tries to interpret the link prefix incorrectly.  Not just for \"hansoft://\", but any kind of link prefix.\r\n2. A manual suggested workaround, if there is one.\r\n3. A script to run on our existing Confluence to repair these links.\r\n\r\nThanks for your attention to this matter.\r\nRegards.",
