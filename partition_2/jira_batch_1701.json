Suggested Solution\r\nProvide a way to either upload an attachment, or link to it within the event.\r\n\r\nh3. Why this is important\r\n It would be really helpful to be able to link to an attachment in a Team Calendar event. Through Related Page, you can currently link to a page or put in a url for an external webpage.

Here's a good example of a scenario where this feature is important. \r\n{quote}\r\nImagine I want to search for the picture of a black cat. I search for \"black cat\" and probably get no results, because the pictures are not named blackcat.jpg but mycute_cat123.jpg etc. instead. So I try again and just search for \"cat\", now I get 50 results, great. But I have to click on all the attachments to find out, if it really is a picture of a black cat or not. Well, probably there isn't a black cat at all, so I spend minutes checking all the results for nothing. With thumbnails on the other hand, I could just quickly scan the thumbnail results and be done. So yes, the search might render 0.2 seconds faster without thumbnails, but what good is that, if the users task is nearly impossible to complete.{quote}\r\n\r\nDue to this, I believe there should be an option for use to disable or enable this feature based on their need.\r\n\r\nIt would be good to extend this to files/attachments preview too.",

      "description": "h5.Summary\r\nAfter renaming a user in Active Directory, and performing a sync in Crowd/JIRA, Crowd/JIRA correctly identifies that the user is an updated user, rather than a whole new user. When syncing from that same Crowd/JIRA to Confluence, Confluence incorrectly identifies the user as a new user, and will create a user account for them.\r\n\r\nh5.Environment\r\nCrowd/JIRA has a connector to Active Directory. The base DN is set at an OU that has only one user. This user is Joe Smith, and has the username jsmith. Confluence is in turn connected to this Crowd/JIRA Server\r\n\r\nh5.Steps to Reproduce:\r\n# Create a user in Active Directory, jsmith.\r\n# Sync Crowd/JIRA. Verify the user appears in Crowd/JIRA.\r\n# Sync Confluence with Crowd/JIRA. Verify the user appears in Confluence.\r\n# On the user in Active Directory: Right Click \u00bb Properties \u00bb Account \u00bb Adjust both logon names to smithj\r\n# Sync Crowd/JIRA. Verify the username is updated correctly in Crowd/JIRA.\r\n# Sync Confluence.

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFCLOUD-33424].\n  {panel}\n\nI am using Confluence-Jaxb version 2.1 (http://confluence.highsource.org/display/HJ3/JAXB) to generate Java beans for the XSD below. Java source code is properly generated but JAXB is not able to successfully unmarshal a valid XML file conforming to the XSD. I have provided below the XSD, my conformant XML file, and my Java code used to unmarshal.\r\n\r\nMy specific problem is as below. I am using a custom Java class named com.tree.JAXBLeafNode for the element LeafNode in the XSD and have provided corresponding JaxB annotations to NOT generate Java beans for this element. I have also provided a custom XmlAdapter to marshal/unmarshal the element LeafNode. My custom marshal/unmarshaling handles converting the XML attributes appearing in the element LeafNode into some custom Java objects. LeafNode's parent element RootOrInnerNode, however, has the standard confluence-JAXB generated - Java beans. It has a List<JAXBElement<?>> to hold the contained LeafNode elements. It should be noted that, in the XSD, LeafNode's parent element RootOrInnerNode only contains the element AbstractNode as a direct child element and not the element LeafNode itself. LeafNode is rather indirectly rendered as a child of RootOrInnerNode since it is a substitution group for the element AbstractNode. Upon inspection using eclipse's debugger, I discovered that the List<JAXBElement<?>> in RootOrInnerNode contains a  null for the LeafNodes. It appears that my custom XMLAdapter for the element LeafNode is not called, while instantiating its parent element RootOrInnerNode's JAXB bean and hence, the List<JAXBElement<?>> is not populated with the corresponding LeafNodes\r\n\r\nI have these constraints upon the XSD and custom Java bean,Adapter and marshal/unmarshall methods, while fixing this error. 1) I cannot change the schema. AbstractNode must exist the way it is in the XSD and both the RootOrInnerNode and LeafNode should have the existing associations with AbstractNode. This is the case since changing the XSD triggers lot bigger changes in several other parts of the project. 2) I must use custom Java beans named com.tree.JAXBLeafNode for the element LeafNode and a custom XMLAdapter since, I expect the binary data anyAttribute namespace==\"##any\" in the LeafNode element and do a lot of custom processing of this data.\r\n\r\nWould be of great help if I can obtain a way to generate the right LeafNode objects into the List<JAXBElement<?>> in RootOrInnerNode.",

      "description": "After upgrading to Confluence 5.4.4 we discovered that the blog-posts macro is now taking a very long time to render. In the first reports it was passing 120 seconds and the renderer was timing out. For smaller cases it still took 20 seconds, 40 seconds, or 60 seconds.\r\n\r\nIn the case of around 20 seconds... it was only matching 7 blog posts generating a 7 row table! We think this is not reasonable, especially since we rely on blog-posts to list the titles of 30 or more blog posts in some places, and these are taking 60 seconds or timing out at 120 seconds.\r\n\r\nWe use blog posts for many purposes. One of these purposes is meeting minutes. Meeting minutes can get reasonably long (3 or more pages) and meeting minutes can include many references to the JIRA issue macro. In this case, I believe the JIRA issue macro in Confluence 5.4.4 has become very slow to render and this has made the problem with blog-posts much more severe as a result.\r\n\r\nAfter significant analysis, I believe the problem is as follows:\r\n\r\n1) The blog-posts macro first searches for all matching blogs. (FAST)\r\n2) The blog-posts macro then renders each matching blog. (VERY SLOW)\r\n3) The blog-posts macro then passes this rendered content into the velocity macro for output. (FAST)\r\n\r\nIn this case, we only want titles. So, why is the blog-posts macro fully rendering every single matching blog content just to display the blog title?\r\n\r\nI created this patch to the Confluence Advanced Macros Plugin:\r\n\r\n{noformat}\r\ndiff --git a/src/main/java/com/atlassian/confluence/plugins/macros/advanced/BlogPostsMacro.java b/src/main/java/com/atlassian/confluence/plugins/macros/advanced/BlogPos\r\nindex 91a77d1..fddcd3e 100644\r\n--- a/src/main/java/com/atlassian/confluence/plugins/macros/advanced/BlogPostsMacro.java\r\n+++ b/src/main/java/com/atlassian/confluence/plugins/macros/advanced/BlogPostsMacro.java\r\n@@ -519,6 +519,13 @@ public class BlogPostsMacro extends ContentFilteringMacro implements Macro\r\n      */\r\n     private String getContent(BlogPost post, String contentType)\r\n     {\r\n+        if (CONTENT_TITLES.equals(contentType) || CONTENT_TITLES_ALIAS.equals(contentType))\r\n+        {\r\n+            // Caller wants the title only. No need to return any content.\r\n+            return \"\";\r\n+        }\r\n+\r\n+\r\n         String excerpt;\r\n         if (CONTENT_EXCERPTS.equals(contentType))\r\n         {\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nBefore deploying this change, I could see side by side that both production and test environments were very slow. For my chosen test case, it was taking between 20 and 30 seconds to display just 7 blog post titles. This was every time on reload.\r\n\r\nAfter deploying this change to our test environment... the test environment now completes in about 2 seconds for the same 7 blog post titles.\r\n\r\nI will chase down the \"why\" of \"why are the blog posts' content being rendered so slow\" as a separate issue. For now, please accept that some pages do render more slowly than other pages, and I think it is important that Atlassian patches blog-posts to not render the entire blog post content, when only the blog post titles are necessary as this will significantly cut down on the processing power required for this macro in a very common use case.\r\n\r\nIf we ask for the blog post content, and each blog post content takes a while to render, then this is reasonable. If we ask for the blog post title, and each blog post content takes a while to render, this is not reasonable.\r\n\r\nI think this is a simple fix for you and because Confluence 5.4.4 has regressed in a major way for a primary function (at least for us), I would like this fix to be considered critical.\r\n\r\nThanks!",

[See the corresponding bug report|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFCLOUD-33346].\n  {panel}\n\nWe found this bug by having the following problem:\r\n\r\nWe couldn't mention an *specific* user (doris.doppelbauer) within Confluence by using @user while creating or editing a page.\r\n\r\nWe found a Explanation (see link at the end), which isn't working in our case, because the user appears in the people directory *four times\", while the link to the Profile itself is always the same. The search for this user won't give aus any results.\r\n\r\nI checked the rights and roles and in my opinion everything is alright. The user is able to watch the spaces but nobody can mention this user.\r\n\r\nI made some screenhots in order to make you able to see the problem. \r\nIf you have any further questions, please go ahead and ask me. Please fix this issue as soon as possible, as we need to mention users for our workflow.\r\n\r\nhttps://confluence.atlassian.com/display/ONDEMANDKB/Existing+Users+do+not+Appear+in+Confluence+People+Directory,+Team+Calendars,+Share+Feature+and+Watchers+List",
