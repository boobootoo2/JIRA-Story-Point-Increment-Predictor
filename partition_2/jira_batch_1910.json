It is confusing for our user to have different look and feel. They expect have the two tools integrated (/doc suburl is assigned to confluence).\r\nWhen you have both software it would also be nice to have links in the menu bar that link from Jira to Confluence and the other way round.\r\nI did modify the layout in Confluence to have a similar header but I had to revert to the standard layouts after upgrading to 2.2.2 for compatibility problem.

      "description": "Greetings,\r\nI upgraded Confluence from 1.4 to 2.2 about two weeks ago. Since then there has been a problem: About every 24hrs, Confluence will exhibit a problem with loading the appropriate CSS sheets. This will display an html page sans any style sheets. The only way to get this resolved (until the next 24hrs) is to restart the Resin application which in turn restarts both Confluence and Jira - /usr/share/resin/webapps/(Confluence)(Jira)\r\n\r\nConfiguration details:\r\nI have Jira 3.6.1 and Confluence 2.2 running as webapps under Resin 2.1.16. I recently upgraded from Confluence 1.4 where this issue was not present.\r\nSystem information:\r\nJava startup variables: args=\"-J-Xms256m -Xmx1g -XX:MaxPermSize=256m -Djava.awt.headless=true -Dorg.apache.commons.logging.simplelog\r\n.defaultlog=info\"\r\nJava Version 1.5.0_06\r\nJava Vendor Sun Microsystems Inc.\r\nJVM Version 1.0\r\nJVM Vendor Sun Microsystems Inc.\r\nJVM Implementation Version 1.5.0_06-b05\r\nJava Runtime Java(TM) 2 Runtime Environment, Standard Edition\r\nJava VM Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM\r\nUser Timezone US/Pacific\r\nOperating System Linux 2.6.5-7.97-smp\r\nOS Architecture amd64\r\nFilesystem Encoding UTF-8\r\n\r\nJava VM Memory Statistics\r\nTotal Memory 411 MB\r\nFree Memory 212 MB\r\nUsed Memory 199 MB\r\nMemory Graph\r\n[Used Memory ( 48 %)] [Free Memory ( 52 %)]\r\n52 % Free\r\n\r\nRuntime Information\r\nDatabase Dialect bucket.dialect.MySQLDialect\r\nDatabase Connection URL jdbc:mysql://localhost/confluence?autoReconnect=true\r\nDatabase Driver Name com.mysql.jdbc.Driver\r\nDatabase Driver Version 3.1\r\nApplication Server Resin/2.1.16\r\nServlet Version 2.3\r\nConfluence Home /var/confluence-conf\r\nUptime 29 minutes, 28 seconds\r\nVersion 2.2\r\nBuild Number 512\r\n\r\nSo far it was suggested from Confluence support to roll back any  themes I may have enabled. However, I am using all defualt themes and layouts:\r\n\r\nMain Layout\r\nDefines the generic header and footer for all pages in Confluence.\r\nEdit | Reset Default | View Default\r\nGlobal Layout\r\nDefines the appearance of the dashboard and a users profile.\r\n< default > | Create custom | View Default\r\nPopup Layout\r\nPopup windows such as the user history popup are displayed using this layout.\r\n< default > | Create custom | View Default\r\nPrintable Layout\r\nThe layout used to display the page when the user clicks the \"printable\" icon in the top-right of the page.\r\n< default > | Create custom | View Default\r\nContent Layouts\r\n\r\nContent layouts control the appearance of content such as pages and news items: they don't change the way the pages themselves are displayed, but they allow you to alter the way the surrounding comments or attachments are shown.\r\nDecorator Operations\r\nSpace Layout\r\nControls how a space is displayed.\r\n< default > | Create custom | View Default\r\nPage Layout\r\nControls how a page is displayed.\r\n< default > | Create custom | View Default\r\nMail Layout\r\nControls how mail is displayed.\r\n< default > | Create custom | View Default\r\nBlog Post Layout\r\nControls how a blog post is displayed.\r\n< default > | Create custom | View Default\r\n\r\nThis issue is reproduceable about every 24 hours regardless of the browser/version being used. I will get a screenshot the next time it happens if that would help. I have also attached two log files that I hope wil help. \r\n\r\nThanks in advance and let me know if you require additional information.\r\n\r\n-Jesse\r\n",

      "description": "We'd like to include plugins in the default confluence distribution (particularly the Conf Repo Client) that are upgradeable,  just like user-installable plugins.\r\n\r\nThe repo client needs to be capable of upgrading itself, which means that it can't be a static plugin. However, all current bundled plugins are static and can't be replaced. So I created a new plugin loader that looks in the {$conf-install-dir}/bundled-plugins directory and dynamically loads plugins from there as well. Perfect!\r\n\r\nNext, however, imagine that you've installed your own copy of the repo-client in {$conf-home}/plugins. If you upgrade to Confluence 2.3 containing the bundled copy, the two plugins are going to conflict.\r\n\r\nTo solve that problem, we have to be able to compare two plugins from different plugin-loaders and choose the more recent. I implemented a compareTo() method on the Plugin class that will attempt to get the plugin's version and determine which is the more recent. It expects standard x.x.x format version. It does a little bit of cleanup (removing spaces, etc.) to try to ensure an accurate comparison.\r\n\r\nSo now when we find a duplicate plugin key, we check to see if the conflicting plugin is newer than the one we have. If it is, we unload the current plugin and load the new one. If it is the same version or older, we do nothing. If we can't get a valid version (e.g., the format is wrong) we leave the plugin we've already loaded in place.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, we always want to get back to a baseline version of Confluence - identical to what shipped from Atlassian. So that means when we load a user-installed verison of a bundled plugin, we don't want to remove the bundled version. So I made sure that my new bundled-plugins plugin loader doesn't actually delete any files. That way, if you ever get into trouble, you can clear your {{{$conf-home}/plugins}) and get back to the original state.\r\n\r\nAfter talking over the design of the bundled-plugins feature with Mike, he pointed out that our simple \"look in this directory\" plan wouldn't work when deploying in an un-exploded .war. So we need to bundle the zips and then actually extract them into $confluence-home/bundled-plugins.. So I build a step into ConfluencePluginManager that will, on init:\r\n\r\n# check for the presence of an atlassian-bundled-plugins.zip\r\n# check for the presence of $confluence-home/bundled-plugins.\r\n# if different, replace the contents of $confluence-home/bundled-plugins with the contents of atlassian-bundled-plugins.zip.\r\n\r\nSo, that way, we can always ensure that the default set of plugins will be there, but we don't end up copy-ing them out freshly on each startup, which would be wasteful. If a user wants to upgrade a bundled-plugin, he will copy a new version into $confluence-home/bundled-plugins, and the newer version will override the default until uninstalled. If uninstalled, the plugin manager will pick up the older, bundled version.\r\n\r\nIf the user has a custom-installed version of a bundled plugin, and then we release a newer version as part of a Confluence upgrade, that version will be the one that runs.",

If an HTTP macro takes a long time to request information from a remote server, the database connection used by the thread is unavailable, and other servlet threads will wait for a connection.\r\n\r\nWe can counter this in two ways:\r\n\r\n1. Create a configuration setting for the HTTP timeout so a system administrator can configure a reasonable timeout for RSS and Jiraissues macro requests. Outbound connections will timeout quicker and return their connections to the pool.\r\n\r\n2. Cache negative hits for HTTP-based macros such as Jiraissues and RSS. That is, if the server doesn't respond and we receive an error response, cache the error response and return that for the next half-hour. At the moment we only cache successful results for these macros.\r\n\r\nIn the long term, we should probably investigate an asynchronous approach to retrieving this information (probably via AJAX), so the database connections are never held unnecessarily. There are accessibility concerns with doing this, however.\r\n",

Instead of selecting Tools > Export to Word, you select Tools > Edit in Word  . This will open up the Confluence page in Word, including any images. You can then do whatever you like with the file on your local machine and save changes back to the server if needed.\r\n\r\n-2. Set A Cookie-\r\n-Simply login to Confluence using Internet Explorer and tick \"Remember my login on this computer\". So long as this cookie is maintained by Internet Explorer (i.e. until you wipe your cookies or click log out), you will be able to successfully view all images when viewing your document in Word. Note that this will be remain effective after you close IE although it will need to be performed after a restart of the server.-\r\n\r\n*Edit:* Set A Cookie work around does not work.

Resiszing the window doesn't resize the image but instead shows only a smaller part of it. Also, the next image opened is shown again at full size, requiring the whole resizing clicking again, but to no avail anyway. Effectively, Confluence can not be adequately used for the display of large images.\r\n\r\nIs it possible to either create a new window at most to the current screen size holding an image resized (either by the browser or to a pre-defined size) to that window size?\r\n\r\nTo my experience this is a standard functionality in other galleries I have seen (Gallery(2), Coppermine, ...). \r\n\r\nThere is also a JavaScript script floating around on the 'net to do the resizing and overlay thing in the browser *yuck*: \"Lightbox JS\" http://www.huddletogether.com/projects/lightbox/.\r\n\r\nIt would suit Confluence very well to include resizing functionality to enhance usability and make it an even more worthwhile experience.\r\n\r\nThanks for your great product anyway,\r\nTorge Schmidt",

Some of them are already listed in CONF-4778. \r\nThe requests below \r\n\r\n- Support a (initial) size parameter for the image slidshow. This should also resize the popup accordingly.\r\n\r\nBackground: Mostly uploaded are images from digital cameras, 3 Megapixels and up. Those images do not fit on the screen, so you have to scroll the image left/right up/down which is annoying. Also, the images (e.g. 1-3 Megabytes) are transferred over the Network as a whole, where one could save traffic when the size was smaller. Unfortunately, the users are not that much trained so they could upload resized images (e.g. 800x600) -> The server must do the work.\r\n\r\n- Introduce a size combobox in the slideshow\r\n\r\nThe slideshow could have a combobox where the user selects the image size (e.g. 800x600, 1024x768, original size). Then, the image is scaled down by the server and transmitted. Saves network traffic and each user could select the size that fits on screen.\r\nOptionally, each tumbnail and the slideshow picture could get its own \"Save original picture as...\" link, so each user can download the original picture easily to get high-quality printouts.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?\r\n\r\nThanks for considering\r\nAndreas",

Logging in to one invalidates the session for the other app, requiring another login, which then invalidates the other etc.\r\n\r\nIdentical description and likely-sounding cause was found in Issue CONF-799, indicating that the transient JSESSIONID sookies is the problem. The suggested workaround (select \"Remember my login\") seems to work, certainly both apps can be logged on in the same browser using that option. Not all corporations allow such use of cookies, however, for security reasons.\r\n\r\nIt's a bit disappointing that such a basic problem is still in the product nearly 2 years later. Or is their something peculiar about my setup that means I'm the first to hit it since then? Seems unlikely.",
