Currently one could just forward the entire url e.g. /confluence/display/<space>/<page> to the Confluence app however it would be nice if <domain>/<page> could be the URL instead.\n\nI have managed to get some of the way along with the following Apache rewrite, using mod_jk2 to forward to Tomcat with Confluence installed as /. I have a mapping file to translate the domain name into a space key.\n\nRewriteEngine on\n# Set map to convert to lowercase\nRewriteMap       lowercase      int:tolower\n# Set map type and path\nRewriteMap   vhost              txt:/etc/apache2/maps/vhost\n# HTTP_HOST not blank\n#RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST}  !^$\n# Convert HTTP_HOST to lowercase\nRewriteCond  ${lowercase:%{HTTP_HOST}|NONE}  ^((dev|stage)\\.)?(.+)$\n# Search for host in vhost map\nRewriteCond  ${vhost:%3}  ^(.*)$\n# Prefix path with vhost search result and set environment variable \"VHOST\"\nRewriteRule  ^(.*)$   $1  [E=VHOST:${lowercase:%{HTTP_HOST}},E=SPACE:%1]\n\nRewriteRule  ^/display/\\w+(/?.*)        $1      [R,L]\nRewriteRule  ^/display/(~.*)    /user/$1        [R,L]\nRewriteRule  ^/$                        /Home\nRewriteRule  ^/(styles/.*)$   /$1?spaceKey=%{ENV:SPACE}  [QSA,PT,L]\nRewriteRule  ^/user/(~.*)$ /display/$1 [PT,L]\nRewriteRule  ^/(decorators|pages|images|spaces|download|x|rpc|admin)(/(.*))?$ /$1/$3 [PT,L]\nRewriteRule  ^/(.*\\.action.*)$ /$1 [PT,L]\n#RewriteRule  ^(/display/%{ENV:SPACE})?/(.*)$   /display/%{ENV:SPACE}/$2  [PT,L]\nRewriteRule  ^/(.*)$   /display/%{ENV:SPACE}/$1  [PT,L]\n\nIt would be nice if this could be done a little cleaner e.g. pass the space key as a querystring parameter to every request or prefix every URI with the space key e.g.\n/display/Home?spaceKey=<space>   or\n/<space>/display/Home    or\n/styles/<space>/Home   ",

      "description": "We consistently get OutOfMemoryErrors after running Confluence for several days. Java heapdump (ibm jdk feature) shows 149 PreRenderedMailNotificationQueueItems that sit in ErrorQueuedTaskQueue holding 100M+ of memory from garbage colection (heapdump file can be provided for your amusement). I've spent some time looking into this problem and here is what I found\n\nFirst, how the PreRenderedMailNotificationQueueItems get to the error queue. Most of our users did not bother choosing between text and html email notifications, so their confluence.prefs.email.mimetype comes from preferences-default.xml and is equal to \"html\". Due to apparent typo in MailNotificationQueueItem#getMimeTypeForUser (MailNotificationQueueItem.java around line 159), string \"html\" is not considered to represent html content and is used as is by SMTPMailServerImpl. Since \"html\" is not know mime type, send message fails with javax.mail.ParseException. By the way, ErrorQueuedTaskQueue#handleException looses nested exceptions and stack trace and all I saw in the logs was almost useless \"send message failed\".\n\nSecond, why PreRenderedMailNotificationQueueItems hold so much RAM. Although I am not 100% sure but looking at the heapdump and the source code it appears that PreRenderedMailNotificationQueueItems.VelocityRenderedQueueItem#context holds whole bunch of different stuff, including http request, response and much more. Since PreRenderedMailNotificationQueueItem is already pre-rendered you may as well clean VelocityRenderedQueueItem#context and probably other members before queueing it for delivery. Another suggestion is to make ErrorQueuedTaskQueue weak -- I would rather loose few *failed* mail notifications than my entire wiki server.\n\nHope this helps. I've made some changes to our local Confluence installation to help me debug this problem better and I will update this bug report if I find something new.\n\n--\nRegards,\nIgor",

      "description": "When re-editing a blog post, the \"News Title\" field is disabled. This causes IE 6.0 to throw a JavaScript error. We traced it back to the function placeFocus() in \"decorators/effects.js\". The function placeFocus() is called in the body's onload event and performs the following:\n\nfunction placeFocus() {\n[...]\n        var currSet=document.forms[i].elements;\n[...]\n\tif (currSet[j].type=='text' || currSet[j].type=='password' || currSet[j].type=='textarea'){\n\t\tcurrSet[j].focus();\n\t\tstopNow=true;\n\t\tbreak;\n\t}\n[...]\t\t\t\t\n}\n\nWhen an element is in \"disabled\" mode, the focus method is not applicable for IE. We tried it in Firefox as well but no error was thrown there, so this is simply IE not accepting the focus() method for disabled form elements.\n\nTo prevent the error from being shown, we modified the placeFocus()  function such as:\n\nfunction placeFocus() {\n[...]\n\tif ((currSet[j].type=='text' || currSet[j].type=='password' || currSet[j].type=='textarea') && !currSet[j].disabled){\n\t\tcurrSet[j].focus();\n\t\tstopNow=true;\n\t\tbreak;\n\t}\n[...]\t\t\t\t\n}\n\nWe needed to fix this because the error was preventing some other custom JavaScript code we have from running (we are working on a WYSIWYG add-on...;-) stay tuned).\n\n-George\n\n",

We do not see this problem in Confluence 1.3. The ability to display tables with no borders is essential for professional looking article-like pages when content is displayed in a columnar format.\n\n=========\n\nIt may be possible to fix this by placing all included HTML inside <div class=\"included-html\">, then having styles in the sheet that override the wiki-content styles, e.g.\n\n.included-html td, .included-html th { \n    border: inherit;\n    padding: inherit; \n}\n\nWorth trying, anyway. Otherwise we'll have to go back to <table class=\"wiki-table\">",
