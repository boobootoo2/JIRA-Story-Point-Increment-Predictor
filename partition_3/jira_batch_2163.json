So it's kinda expected to not work well with Confluence 4.3.x. It'd be nice to get these information updated so one would know and not get confused when things appear to be broken all over the place.\n- Easy Blue Theme - https://developer.atlassian.com/download/attachments/2031799/easy-blue-theme-1.1.jar?version=1&modificationDate=1227483442846 from this page https://developer.atlassian.com/display/CONFDEV/Creating+a+Stylesheet+Theme\n-- Footer is missing and some styling isn't applied well. I think this is another compatibility issue as the docs and plugins were written quite long time ago, and there's been so much changes in recent Confluence interface/styling/themes since then.\n\nMaybe we can revisit these docs and ensure it will work with recent Confluence releases. Or at very least, state the highest version of Confluence that the docs can be applied to.",

Scenario:\nSharing a page with multiple users always returns an \"Error while sending\" message:\n!1.JPG!\n\nWhile sharing a page with a single user is not an issue as it returns the expected result which is \"Sent\"\n\nHowever, Confluence sends all of the notifications without any problems (there is no queued messages, all users get their notifications). Nevertheless, this is a problem because this error is misleading and when users see this error message, they think their shared pages won't get through so they try to send it out again and again and this became a spam.\n\nh5. Resolution\nThis issue has been fixed in version 1.26.1 of the Share Page plugin. This is compatible for Confluence 4.3 and above. You can update the plugin by going to Manage Add-ons in Confluence Admin. If the update is compatible with your version of Confluence, it will be displayed in Action Required.",

For example user stories or specification changes are sent to development as version diff links so that further analysis and page edits will not interfere with development. Currently only small amount of content is displayed and user cannot even see to what paragraph (under which heading) it belongs to.\n\nCONF-6445 suggested that amount of context could be configurable (In 4.3.2 I did not find the option) - that would be really good solution. \nAnother option would be to add a link that would show full page with diffs (it could be extra selection under view button for example).",

[See the corresponding bug report|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFSERVER-27294].\n  {panel}\n\nWebWork supports the concept of action aliases, which allow a single action class to serve requests mapping to different names. This allows a developer to reuse the same action logic, but provide different results based on interceptors. When an action is invoked, Webwork will typically call its execute() method, but this behavior can be modified in either xwork.xml or from a URL of the form +\u201c/dosomething!method.action\u201d+.\n\nTwo interceptor stacks that are of particular interest to Confluence: \n* {{defaultStack}} \u2013 Provides all the basic interceptors such as transactions, params, and autowiring.\n* {{validatingStack}} \u2013 Extends {{defaultStack}} with some additional security filters ({{ConfluenceXsrfTokenInterceptor}}, {{ConfluenceWorkflowInterceptor}}).\n\nTo make use of features like XSRF and framework validation, an Action is configured in xwork.xml with a reference to {{validatingStack}}. In cases where this protection is not needed, they are configured to reference {{defaultStack}}.\n\n*A security issues exists when aliases use different interceptor stacks for the same Action*. By submitting requests to an Action using the {{defaultStack}}, an attacker can bypass XSRF and validation protections the {{validatingStack}} would provide.\n\nA case study of this vulnerability is {{ChangeMyPasswordAction}}, defined in xwork.xml as follows:\n\n{code:xml} \n<package name=\"users\" extends=\"default\" namespace=\"/users\">\n    <default-interceptor-ref name=\"validatingStack\"/>\n...\n    <action name=\"changemypassword\" class=\"com.atlassian.confluence.user.actions.ChangeMyPasswordAction\" method=\"doDefault\">\n        <interceptor-ref name=\"defaultStack\"/>\n        <result name=\"input\" type=\"velocity\">/users/changemypassword.vm</result>\n        <result name=\"error\" type=\"velocity\">/users/changemypassword.vm</result>\n        <result name=\"success\" type=\"velocity\">/users/changemypassword.vm</result>\n    </action>\n\n    <action name=\"dochangemypassword\" class=\"com.atlassian.confluence.user.actions.ChangeMyPasswordAction\">\n        <param name=\"RequireSecurityToken\">true</param>\n        <result name=\"input\" type=\"velocity\">/users/changemypassword.vm</result>\n        <result name=\"error\" type=\"velocity\">/users/changemypassword.vm</result>\n        <result name=\"cancel\" type=\"redirect\">viewmyprofile.action</result>\n        <result name=\"success\" type=\"velocity\">/users/changemypasswordsuccessful.vm</result>\n    </action>\n{code}\n\nTwo aliases have been configured for the {{ChangeMyPasswordAction}} action. The \u201cchangemypassword\u201d alias will use the {{defaultStack}}, which offers no additional security features, while the \u201cdochangemypassword\u201d alias will use the {{validatingStack}}, which provides XSRF and framework validation features.\n\nThe action itself is written as follows:\n\n{code:title=ChangeMyPasswordAction.java|borderStyle=solid}\npublic class ChangeMyPasswordAction extends AbstractUserProfileAction implements FormAware\n{\n  private String currentPassword;\n  private String newPassword;\n  private String newPasswordConfirmation;\n...\n  public void validate()\n  {\n    if (!userAccessor.authenticate(getUser().getName(), currentPassword))\n    {\n      addActionError(getText(\"cur.pass.not.correct\"));\n    }\n  }\n\n  public String execute() throws Exception\n  {\n    try\n    {\n      userAccessor.alterPassword(getUser(),newPassword);\n...\n    return \n{code}\n\nWhen invoked through normal means, the \u201cchangemypassword\u201d action will execute {{doDefault}}, which simply renders the appropriate Velocity template for changing a user\u2019s password. When the form is submitted, the \u201cdochangemypassword\u201d action is executed, which verifies XSRF tokens and validates the current password field is correct before changing a users password.\n\nAn attacker can exploit this action by submitting a request to \u201cchangemypassword\u201d, but explicitly specifying the method to be executed in the URL. In this case, if they specify a URL like http://website.com/confluence/users/changemypassword!execute.action?newPassword=hacked&newPasswordConfirmation=hacked, then XSRF and current password validation will be bypassed.\n\nThis is a good example for demonstrating the two disadvantages in bypassing the {{validatingStack}}:\n* An attacker can now conduct XSRF attacks against all Actions that should have been protected.\n* An attacker can bypass any framework validation that is supposed to provide security and authorization checks.\n\nThe simplist way to mitigate this vulnerability is to remove the \"!method\" syntax support for invoking actions in Webwork.",

It would be handy to edit cells of that table without entering edit mode; e.g. by just clicking on a cell and edit that part of the text only, as it is possible with Google Docs. Alternatively, it would be nice have a edit text macro. The macro while inserted would be a self populating one field form.\n\nAnother case is, while working with sections and columns, the edit mode view looks completely different from the ready version. Editing anything on the fly while having presentation means changing the whole layout by going to the edit mode. The minimum would be to be able to double click on a document and start edit mode with cursor in particular place as you suggested.",

(yes, I could probably extract an html file from some jar and fix it, but I don't want to).\n\nIt occurred to me that it would be nice if *all* help text in the system were available as wiki pages that the administrator could edit. That way, we could edit the text using the same editor that we've gotten used to with confluence and use it to update the pages.\n\nNaturally, that would make upgrading more difficult - if the help page has changed, what to do? Use the new help page, or the customized page? I would say replace the customized page with the new page, and leverage the page history to get back any edits the administrator may have made.\n\nAlso, in case the admin messes up a page, there should be a big button which says \"use default text\" so that they can revert the help text back to what it was.\n\nThis is very similar to how JSPWiki does its help - all pages displayed to the user are editable wiki pages.
