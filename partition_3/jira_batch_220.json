      "description": "We have multiple agile teams using Jira agile and we've been using it for a little over 2 years now. The view has greatly improved since GreenHopper days, but we have some a few significant issues that cause our team to have to work around Jira that I wanted to raise to you:\r\n\r\n1. Accounting for both hours and story points is challenging: Our team estimates our sprint and measures our sprint success by velocity and story points, but we use hours as a gut check during our planning to understand capacity this is a challenge for many reasons:\r\n- If we have hours enabled our burndown chart only burns down by hours we aren't tracking, not story points which we want. We need to have hours enabled in order to do detailed level tasking. This makes our burndown chart useless for us\r\n- On the plan view, when we select an individual on the team to see how their hours line up we can only see the tickets where they are assigned to the parent level ticket. This doesn't work for us as we have multiple team members assigned to subtasks on each ticket it, so we have to keep track on each person's hours on a separate spreadsheet during planning.\r\n\r\nSummary of team info on the \"Work\" view\r\n- Some of our teams are moving back to physical scrum boards during their standups because the \"work\" view is too busy as it's impossible to see what's in a sprint without scrolling down and we want to see if all on one screen.\r\n- There really isn't a good way to view stories & subtasks. We use the swimlane option of having parent stories across the view with the subtasks showing, the parent tickets always seem to get lost in that view. The ability to customize the work view more would be appreciated. We want to be able to easily toggle between sprint summary view and a detailed level view\r\n\r\nAccounting for Story Point Changes & Velocity Calculations\r\n- If you add / change story points to a story after a sprint has started or add a story with points to a sprint after it's started than the numbers aren't on the sprint report. This is really annoying as I have to click on each ticket that doesn't have a story point listed and do my own manual calculations.\r\n- Also, I have a whole separate spreadsheet for each sprint team that breaks down the the team's historical performance. This is how we determine the \"average velocity per person on the team per day\" and we used this to estimate the velocity during planning based on the team's availability. Having that as part of reporting would be awesome!",

      "description": "I regularly use the classic agile gadget on dashboards to evaluate the overall progress of large projects.  We typically avoid story points and instead look at solely at remaining hours (hours tab).  So we're looking at the classic agile gadget for a 12-18 month period.  When I look at the red line, it's automatically set to start with the amount of work remaining in hours on the start date set in the gadget's configuration and then is rendered in a straight line where 0 is at the end date as set in the configuration.  \r\n\r\nThis is nice for uses where the number of hours on the start date is equivalent to the capacity of your team given some velocity (I run a model for long projects that assumes N developers at M%utilization thereby giving me a capacity in terms of how much available scope measured in time that the team can handle at any date in the project); however, in reality our backlogs are never quite built so perfectly, so what I'd like to do is have the ability to add another line to the burndown gadget that represents the capacity of the team.  This would be in addition to the current red line.\r\n\r\nI would want to specify the following information:\r\n\r\n1. Start date\r\n2. Capacity on start date measured in hours\r\n3. End date\r\n4. Remaining amount of work left on end date.  It would probably be ok to set this to 0 and I could probably make do with not being able to configure this value.\r\n\r\nThen the software would render a line based on that information.  This would allow me to see how I've modeled effort and then as I'm monitoring the team's progress, the goal would be to make sure my green line stays near this model line.  It would also make it very clear if I had room in my model to add scope or if I had to start thinking about cutting scope.\r\n\r\nAdditionally it'd be nice to allow hiding of the currently implemented red line.\r\n\r\nOne additional problem that the current implementation of the red line in the gadget imposes is that you search for a date in time where the amount of work in the backlog approximates the team's capacity that you are trying to model and you are then not able to see anything prior to this.\r\n\r\nI know this may not be how folks intended the tool to be used in terms of long projects with burndown charts spanning many months, but the tool does a great job for this type of project except for the issue mentioned here.\r\n\r\nI'm running jira 6.0.8 and have been unable to find anything in the docs for future versions that suggest this is possible.",

Notes\r\n\r\nThis is caused by multiple Sprint fields appearing on the edit screen in different tabs. This appears to be caused by an upgrade task. Additionally in earlier versions the spelling of \"acive\" was incorrect, and has since been updated to \"active\".\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nEdit the screen for that project and remove the Sprint field from one of the tabs as per [Defining a Screen|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Defining+a+Screen#DefiningaScreen-Editingascreen'sdetails]. This will prevent JIRA Agile from displaying this error.\r\n",

You can specify constraints for all columns, or just some of them.\r\n\r\nYou can choose to exclude sub-tasks from the count.

Summary\r\n\r\nCreating a new Rapid Board appears to fail with the error message \"The requested board cannot be viewed because it either does not exist or you do not have permission to view it.\".\r\n\r\nThis is displayed in the attached screenshot.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n# Restore an instance with problematic data.\r\n# Create a new board.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nThe board is created without error.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nThe board does not appear to be created and the red message is shown.\r\n\r\nh3. Notes\r\n\r\nThis is caused by invalid entries in the user history - specifically references to non existing boards. This can be verified with the following SQL:\r\n\r\n{code:SQL}\r\nSELECT *\r\nFROM   userhistoryitem\r\nWHERE  username = 'admin'\r\n       AND entitytype = 'RapidView'\r\n       AND entityid::integer NOT IN (SELECT \"ID\"\r\n                                     FROM   \"AO_60DB71_RAPIDVIEW\");\r\n{code}\r\n(i) This is PostgreSQL-specific and may require changing for a different DBMS. Please consult with your DBA.\r\n\r\nIf this contains references to IDs that do not exist in the below output it is likely the problem described here is occurring:\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nThis can be fixed by removing those entries:\r\n\r\n# Stop JIRA.\r\n# Backup the database using the native DB tools.\r\n# Execute the following:\r\n{code:SQL}\r\nDELETE\r\nFROM   userhistoryitem \r\nWHERE  username = 'admin' \r\n       AND entitytype = 'RapidView' \r\n       AND entityid::integer NOT IN (SELECT \"ID\"\r\n                                     FROM   \"AO_60DB71_RAPIDVIEW\");\r\n{code}\r\n(i) This is PostgreSQL-specific and may require changing for a different DBMS.
