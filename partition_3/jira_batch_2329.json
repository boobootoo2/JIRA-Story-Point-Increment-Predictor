      "description": "{panel:title=Atlassian status as of March 2020|borderStyle=solid|borderColor=#deebff|titleBGColor=#deebff|bgColor=#ffffff}\r\nHi all,\r\n\r\nI'm excited to share that in Bitbucket Server 7.0 we shipped redesigned and optimized pull request page. The new page has fast and smooth scrolling on pull requests of any size, which adds comfort to your code review experience.\r\n\r\nYou can find more information in the Bitbucket Server 7.0\u00a0[release notes|https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/bitbucket-server-7-0-release-notes-990546638.html] and Pull Requests [documentation|https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/review-and-discuss-a-pull-request-808488540.html].\r\n\r\nPlease, don't hesitate to leave feedback on the feature in the comments. This will help us to priorities further development.\r\n\r\nAnton Genkin\r\n Product Manager Bitbucket Server\r\n{panel}\r\n*Original message*\r\n\r\nWhen viewing large diffs in Bitbucket Server, using Chrome or Safari, and scrolling though the page, there is jitter. You will know you hit this state when you see the browser take a full CPU to render the screen. After the browser reaches the limits on one full core for your system, this is when the jitter happens. Firefox version 57 or better does not have this issue due to [Stylo|https://hacks.mozilla.org/2017/08/inside-a-super-fast-css-engine-quantum-css-aka-stylo/].\r\n\r\nBitbucket should have some basic logic to fall back to a static page if the amount of content is greater than X so that scrolling is actually usable. but to be honest i would also be okay with having a user preference to get static pages all the time. github and gitlab do this much more smartly \u2014 the pages themselves are static and then individual file diffs are collapsed by default if they are too large to display inline. a link allows you to then load that specific diff if you need it inline via ajax.",

(This part is expected behaviour.)\r\n\r\nIf the rebased commit is then pushed to the source branch, instead of rescoping the Pull Request with the status of MERGED, the Pull Request is rescoped as DECLINED, even though the two branches now show identical commit histories\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Create a new repo in BbS, clone the empty repo to your workstation, and create two commits on {{master}}:\r\n{code:java}\r\necho \"test1\" >> test.txt\r\ngit add test.txt\r\ngit commit -m \"First commit\"\r\necho \"test2\" >> test.txt\r\ngit add test.txt\r\ngit commit -m \"Second commit\"\r\ngit push origin master\r\n{code}\r\n\r\n # Create a new branch, {{newbranch}}, that branches from \"First commit\" (i.e. it contains the first commit, but not the second)\r\n{code:java}\r\ngit checkout -b newbranch master~1\r\necho \"branchtest\" >> newfile.txt\r\ngit add .\r\ngit commit -m \"First branch commit\"\r\ngit push origin newbranch\r\n{code}\r\n\r\n # Create a Pull Request from {{newbranch}} --> {{master}}\r\n # Rebase {{master}} onto {{newbranch}} then merge {{newbranch}} into {{master}}, and push those changes\r\n{code:java}\r\ngit rebase master\r\ngit checkout master\r\ngit merge newbranch\r\ngit push origin\r\n{code}\r\n\r\n # At this stage, {{newbranch}} contains the pre-rebase version of \"First branch commit\", and {{master}} contains the post-rebase version of the commit.

If a transaction was in-flight when they were called, that transaction was suspended. That ensured any methods hooks called that accessed the database would create read-only and read-write transactions as required, based on what they were doing.\r\n\r\nStarting with 5.0, the new {{PreRepositoryHook}} and {{PostRepositoryHook}} instances are now run as part of any transaction that happens to be in-flight when the {{RepositoryHookService}} is called. Since {{PreReceiveRepositoryHook}} and {{PostReceiveRepositoryHook}} instances are now implemented using {{PreRepositoryHook}} and {{PostRepositoryHook}} adapters, respectively, this means they may also be called as part of an in-flight transaction.\r\n\r\nIn some cases this results in hooks being called as part of a read-only transaction, which results in unexpected and often difficult to debug behavior. For example, creating a new comment as part of a hook may run successfully, but then after the hook completes the comment wasn't actually added. This happens because the comment is created inside a read-only transaction and its creation is rolled back instead of being committed.",

Therefore it is not uncommon to have relatively long ticket titles. When using the Bitbucket integration to create a git branch from Jira, the branch type, project key, ticket id and ticket title together make up the branch name. However, since my branch names cannot be longer than 100 characters, I regularly get an error message like this:\r\n\r\n{color:#d04437}\u00a0The ref name, once fully qualified, is limited to 100 characters.{color}\r\n\r\nThat is fine, but in addition to displaying the error message the name after the branch type part is erased, which my colleagues and I find very annoying.\u00a0\r\n\r\nI want to suggest that you keep the name as it is and just display the error message and leave it to the user to either truncate or completely rewrite the automatically generated branch name. For improved user experience the remaining number of characters allowed can be displayed, or in red the number of characters exceeding the allowed length.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n*Reproduction:*\r\n * Create a Jira project\u00a0 and a corresponding Git repository\r\n * Create a Jira ticket with a long description (exceeding the mx branch name length)\r\n * From the Jira ticket click \"Create branch\"\r\n * Select \"repository\", \"branch type\" and \"branch from\"\u00a0\r\n * Leave the suggested \"branch name\" as it is\r\n * Press the \"create branch\" button\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n+Actual result:+ An error message is shown and the branch name part after the branch type is erased.\r\n\r\n+Desired result:+ An error message is displayed and the (too long) branch name is retained.
