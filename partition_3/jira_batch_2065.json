We have plenty of pages which has to be consolidated regarding content. So we have to merge two pages to one single page including all (attachments) pictures working in the content. The current strategy is to copy and paste the content from a source page to the target page - that works fine, but the pictures still refers to the origin. But after that you have to move EVERY\u00a0SINGLE picture / file to the new destination page. This is no fun with e.g. hundred pictures... If you don't move the pictures you end up in \"broken attachment\" in the destination page (after deleting the source page).\u00a0\n\nMerging two pages to a third one wouldn't be the best idea since the unique URL / link to the page would be lost.\u00a0\n\nA \"bulk move of attachments\" would help already !\u00a0CONF-15025",

I'm also finding when I go to another space, and then come back, I need to step through the additional clicks to get back to the Page Tree.\n\nThe changes have also introduced white space which is forcing additional page scrolling that now means what we could see on one page before, now we need to scroll down.\n\nSupport told me that the changes were intended to 'streamline the experience' but I'm not sure how the changes have achieved this when they introduced extra clicks and page scrolling.\n\nAlso, as my team is constantly using the tool all day, every day, the additional icons to track\u00a0\"my work\" are not helpful as we typically look-up, create and edit many\u00a0pages each day, therefore \"recently worked on\" and \"recently visited\"\u00a0doesn't serve as a quick access tool. It also doesn't help my users who need to search the page tree or use search to find the pages in the first place.\n\nIt would be great if the changes could be reconsidered to accommodate the feedback from users who are using Confluence on a daily basis as their key work\u00a0tool rather than assuming the pain points and then modifying\u00a0the user's experience to something less effective.\n\nCheers,\n\nBonnie",

The idea is that there are pages with the old macro being used... if they haven't migrated the calendars to the new plugin and were lazy, because we are using the same macro key, it might appear that the macro is broken.\n\nAt the moment we give them the error that we cannot find the calendar ID they have provided.\n\nThe old syntax looks like this:\n{noformat}\n{calendar:id=myCalendar|title=My Calendar|defaultView=week}\n{noformat} \n\nSo what we _could_ do? is if title or defaultView params are being passed, and we can't find the id of the calendar, in the error message we could say \"It appears the new Team Calendar plugin is installed, however this macro is still using the old plugin. <LINK>Learn more</LINK> about migrating your calendar to the new Team Calendars plugin\"\n\nLet's leave this as a placeholder and see if support keep getting pinned for it..if they do,we can just put some notes on this ticket",

It does not, however, have a limit to the number of events on a single day. So it will show all events on that day if there are many events.\n\nBecause we have a fairly active team calendar, the amount displayed in the dashboard is a bit overwhelming. We'd like to be able to limit that display more than the default provides. Ideally, a configurable option that allows us to specify a single day rather than the two days displayed currently.\n\nSuggestion: Would like to configure how much the team calendar displays for the dashbaord",

The customer needs to import 88 ICS files from their old Calendar and then reassign the calendars to their respective owners.\n\nThe customer's workflow for each of the 88 ICS files will be as follows:\n\n   * Communicate the process to the customer\n   * Download all ICS files\n   * Perform the migration\n       ** switch to user x (using SU plugin)\n       ** import ics\n       ** go to the calendar page containing the calendar\n       ** add the user calendar there, and make the color match the original one.\n   * Get approval\n       ** Present\n       ** Process feedback\n\nAs such, they have requested that we consider ways of easing their pain in future, such as providing some form of automated import functionality and/or allow imported files to be assigned to different owners so that it isn't necessary to follow the above steps to migrate from their old calendar into Team Calendars.",

I think this is a bit confusing as the same type of calendars are filed under different sections based on which UI langusge users use when they create a new calendar. \n\n*Steps to Reproduce:*\n# Create an event calendar in English\n# Change your language pack to French\n# Create an event calendar in French\n\nOutcome: A new heading is created for \"Event Calendars\" on the right\n\nExpected Outcome: The event calendar you created in French should go under the same \"event calendars\" heading as the English one.

This test is causing us to waste a lot of time in the moment since Team Calendars changes the DOM of its UI on a regular basis, and due to the separate repositories it is hard to fix a test ahead of a release.\n\nWe just had the case where Matt fixed the test to work for TC 2.4.1, but the 5.0-OD-4 release contains TC 2.3.0. Thus his fix worked for our [CBAC build|https://confluence-bamboo.atlassian.com/browse/COD-MODAT-1601], which takes the confluence-production-integration branch from the ondemand-fireball repository and bakes that together with a snapshot from the Confluence master branch. In the same time, that broke the [BEAC build|https://bamboo.extranet.atlassian.com/browse/JST-JSTGIT21-1] which runs against a released version of Confluence in order to prepare integration into OnDemand. Having to maintain a separate branch where this fixes can be applied against a snapshot of Confluence would be too much effort imo, as the person releasing would have to know which commits to merge in. Instead, we should write the above mentioned test in a backwards-compatible manner, that is to reuse the page objects of TC. If that is not possible the spec of that test should be extracted and re-written in TC.\n",

However, the performance impact is huge.\nFrom what I can tell the performance slow down is a combination of re-loading all calendar information for changes that affect only a single calendar, and the browser then parsing the returned calendar data, generating the DOM, and re-painting.

When they only have one event calendar, all the icons look the same, and it looks a bit recidivous.\n\nInternal example: http://cl.ly/image/2z2g370w1S0C\n\nProposal:\n* Add a new param to the macro which is \"Show event icon\" with the field tip \"Applies for list view only\", unchecked by default ",

Hey, is it necessary to have a login in order to insert someone's vacation into the calendar? for example we have three users, Peter, Max and Jane and only Peter and Jane have a login. Is it possible for Peter to insert Max'es vacation into the calendar so that this inserted vacation does not appear to Jane as Peter's vacation?\n\nIf you could add users to a people calendar via email, you'd be able to add someone to a people calendar without them being a user of the system.\n\nIt could also be a good way to spread Confluence to potential new users ;)\n\n!https://img.skitch.com/20120526-jci56xhmr2s7995m9yebyi6uxk.png!\n\n!https://img.skitch.com/20120526-1xg583986at5rpmrkb4jjge2r7.png!",
