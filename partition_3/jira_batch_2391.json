      "description": "Taken from :\u00a0https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/make-it-harder-to-squash-merge-by-accident-by-prov/365898\r\n\r\nSquash merge is a useful feature, *but in many repos, individual commits are critically valued as a way to preserve history of distinct changes.* In other cases, the history of a long running source branch is substantial, and real merges are required to avoid fomenting a pattern of chronic merge conflicts, or even merge errors. In such environments a squash merge at the end of a Pull Request can be damaging to the repo, requiring mitigations such as force-push and recreation of the merge to repair the history when it is done in error. There are three costly aspects of the squash merge today:\r\n\r\n1 - It is very easy to squash merge when it is not desired because the squash merge setting is sticky in the VSTS UI. It might be appropriate for one PR and not the next, but the UI doesn't allow for that nuance. Using squash on one PR is not a relevant predictor for whether it is a good idea for the next one. - One factor that exacerbates this is that there is a scenario where it is very likely for squash merge to be safe, regardless of the usual policy, and that is where the PR includes only one commit to begin with. In such cases, a true merge will create a history with an uninteresting fork, and many of the justifications for avoiding squash merge don't apply. If you generally want to avoid squash merge, but enable it to simplify the graph where possible for single commits, then you have to enable and disable the feature from one PR to the next, bouncing back and forth. Because of stickiness, it is not a consistent experience to simply enable it (or disable it) as needed, you have to consider the current sticky state and the desired target state.\r\n\r\n2 - The squash merge setting is the last choice made when completing the UI, it is not undoable, and it is not reviewable.\r\n\r\n3 - Repo owners have no ability to shape the culture of a repo with policy around squash merge. I recommend: - make squash merge a reviewable setting on the PR such that reviewers can block squash merges on individual PRs - allow repo policy to allow the squash merge setting to be sticky (i.e. a repo can allow the setting to be sticky or not sticky, for every user individually) - make squash merge separately sticky between PRs with 1 commit and PRs with > 1 commit. - allow repo policy to disable all squash merges - allow exception for PRs with exactly 1 commit - allow repo policy to disable squash merges FROM a list of branches, or branch name patterns - allow exception for PRs with exactly 1 commit - allow repo policy to require squash merges TO a list of branches, or branch name patterns - allow repo policy to default PRs with exactly 1 commit to squash merge, where permitted - allow repo policy to default PRs with > 1 commit to squash merge, where permitted\r\n\r\n\u00a0",

      "description": "Currently, the only way to receive notifications of watched objects is [via email|https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/manage-email-notifications-for-watched-objects/]. I find this method cumbersome and it clutters my inbox. I wish there would be a single place where I could get an overview of all notifications.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I propose Bitbucket implements a \"notification list\" similar to Jira:\r\n- A bell icon in the top right corner\r\n- A little red dot in the icon when there are new notifications\r\n- When you click on the icon, a list of recent notifications on watched objects\r\n\r\nThe list could be implemented as a popup, like Jira, or it could be a separate page for notifications. See {{github.com/notifications}} for an example of such a page.\r\n\r\nFor each notification, the list should show some basic information like the type of notification, the date/time, a preview of the content (the first words of a comment, the title of the pull request, etc.), basically the same information that's currently in the email you receive for each notification. Clicking on a notification should bring you to the same URL as clicking the link in the email. Finally, it should be possible to disable email notifications while still receiving notifications via the website.\r\n\r\nThanks for allowing me to suggest this new feature!",

Issue Summary\r\n\r\nIf user trigger a deployment in pipeline that contain more than 100 commits(say 200 commits), those Jira issues that only have its key show in 100-200 commits would not get pick up, and the status in the corresponding Jira issue won't be updated.\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Create\u00a0deployment environments in repository settings -> pipelines -> deployment\r\n # Define a step that mark as deployment, like this:\r\n{code:java}\r\npipelines:\r\n  branches:\r\n    ddev:\r\n      step:\r\n          name: Build and Test\r\n          deployment: test\r\n          script:\r\n            - echo test{code}\r\n\r\n # Create a feature branch that have 101 commits, and first commit point to a Jira issue, while the rest of the commits don't point to that issue.\r\n # Merge the feature branch to ddev, and it will trigger the deployment step.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nYou should see a new item call \"test\" in the *Releases*\u00a0attribute on the Jira issue sidebar\r\n\r\n!Screen Shot 2021-05-19 at 3.08.06 pm.png!\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nNothing shows up in Releases attribute on the Jira Issue sidebar\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, we don't have a permanent workaround for it except that reduces the commits in the deployment. To do that, you can either break down the deployment into smaller pieces or you can utilise the `squash` function during PR merge, so it won't include that many commits in the deployment.",
