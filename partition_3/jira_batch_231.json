It would be great if there was an option to instead order the completed issues by 'completion date/time'.\r\n\r\nOften, I use the Sprint Report as a reference point during Product Increment Demonstrations - this goes much smoother when I can work through the list in order of issue completion, and thus demonstrate the evolution of a new features over the course of the Sprint.\r\n\r\nThe default ordering by Key in effect means the issues are ordered by the date added to the system, which I think is rarely a useful order for issues in this report.\r\n\r\nMany thanks for considering this feature.",

And, it's causing alot of troubleshooting time from my standpoint because I cannot turn this feature off - If I could, I certainly would because the new board is always corrupted.  \r\n\r\nI find now that when a user is working with a new kanban board created from a copy of an existing kanban board, they have been unable to edit swimlanes.  They can get to all other features to configure/change, but they cannot remove nor change the existing swimlanes that were there from the original/source board. \r\n\r\nI've also found an issue when viewing the kanban board in configuration mode and viewing the columns, the number of issues associated with the filter for each column appear correctly; but, once you get out of configuration mode and return to view mode, the number of issues associated with each column are incorrect and they are always fewer or even zero. I've confirmed that no quick filters are enabled and can never get the correct issues to display. \r\n\r\nIn each situation above, creating the same board from scratch and using all the same properties/filter results in the information being correct. \r\n\r\nIt seems that there are some major data integrity/security issues when using the feature that many may not realize are there and are not working with correct data.  It doesn't look like the properties are all being cleared or set accordingly during this process.  \r\n\r\nFor me, this has been a real headache and huge loss of functionality and we use many, many boards and, from a training/rollout, it is much easier to start with an existing one that meets most of your needs.  But, I have to keep preaching to just not use the feature.  \r\n\r\nSeems like this should be a higher priority than major given the integrity issues surrounding it. ",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSWCLOUD-9167].\n  {panel}\n\nAs a Greenhopper Scrum product owner, I want story estimates to automatically total to the sum of the estimates for all sub-tasks IF and ONLY IF subtasks are entered (else I want story estimates to be manual entry) so that I can view on the scrum board the original estimate against the remaining time.\r\n\r\nDefinition of Done:\r\n1)  When no sub-tasks exist for a story, the estimate field for the story allows entry of a value manually\r\n2)  When one or more sub-tasks exist for a story, the estimate field for the story is calculated as the sum of the estimates for all sub-tasks for that story\r\n\r\nContext:\r\n\r\nI'm finding a feature in Greenhopper to NOT operate as I would have expected. The feature is in estimating where the estimation on the scrum board is configured for original time estimates. What I would like is: \r\n1) when no sub-tasks are created for a story, the estimation and remaining fields are editable within the story \r\n2) when sub-tasks have been created, the story estimate and remaining fields are calculated as the sum of the estimate and remaining fields for the sub-tasks \r\n\r\nWhat's currently happening is that the story estimate field is not calculated from the sum of the sub-tasks but the story remaining field is. Worse, if you enter a value in the story estimate field when sub-tasks have been added and estimated, the value entered into the story estimate field is added to the story remaining field, which already has the sum of the sub-tasks. Thus, if, as a work around, you try to manually enter a story estimate that equals the sum of the sub-task estimates, the story remaining field value doubles. There's no work around for this. This feature seems poorly defined. I understand what the product team was trying to accomplish... the ability to estimate and view remaining values for stories that have no sub-tasks or prior to sub-tasks being added. What they missed is that the field could serve both functions - manual entry when no sub-tasks exist and calculated value when sub-tasks do exist. I strongly urge the product team to consider this feature at their earliest opportunity as the inability to see from the scrum board the original estimate against the remaining value in plan and work mode is a problem. \r\n\r\nh5. Steps to reproduce\r\n# Configure Scrum board to use \"Original Time Estimate\" for Estimation Statistic\r\n# Configure Scrum board to use \"Remaining Estimate and Time Spent\" for Time Tracking\r\n# Create an issue with issue type Story, without specifying any Original Estimate and Remaining Estimate\r\n# Create 2 sub-tasks for this issue.\r\n#* Sub-task 1 has Remaining Estimate of 4 hours\r\n#* Sub-task 2 has Remaining Estimate of 2 hours\r\n# Checking parent of sub-tasks in Issue View, Original Estimate and Remaining Estimate is now shown as 6 hours\r\n# Navigate back to Scrum board, open Issue Detail View, and Original Estimate for parent issue is _Unestimated_",
