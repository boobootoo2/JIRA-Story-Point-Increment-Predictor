      "description": "This request has already been made for Jira and was sadly closed despite being something that would greatly speedup the handling of issues.\r\n\r\n*I would like there to be an option (or simply have it always enabled) in BitBuckets web interface that makes it so Issues that have been changed in anyway since the last time I personally read/accessed them are somehow marked as \"unread\".*\r\n\r\nThis is typically done by changing the font of the link to the issue to a bold one and is very common in forums and other similar discussion areas.\r\n\r\nI currently have no way of knowing which issues have been changed since I last looked looked at them unless I somehow remember the exact times I last checked them (clearly unreasonable). The email notifications are helpful but are *NOT*\u00a0equivalent as they easily can contain redundancies and are much, much less time efficient than seeing where there have been changes in the Issue Tracker itself.\u00a0\r\n\r\nFor example, I see one Issue has been updated in one email, look at it to get up to date, but then there may be several more emails about the same issue further up in my Inbox that are now a waste of time/space because I've already checked into that issue; however, I can't simply ignore all of them 100% of the time based on the time the email was sent, because what if an issue is updated a few minutes after I started checking through the issues but already passed the one that is updated? That email could be regarding an update I was already aware of, or a brand new one that just happened to come a few minutes after I previously checked. This then leads to second guessing the exact times that I did check certain issues where inaccuracies down to the minute mater.\r\n\r\nAll of this and more could be avoided if Issues with unread updates were simply made bold, which is quite a trivial addition. A simple table per user of the last times issues were opened could be compared to the last time the issue was updated.\r\n\r\nIf (issueUpdateTime > userLastCheckTime)\r\n\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0makeBold(issueTitle)\r\n\r\nI can only suspect that others would be greatly benefited by such a feature as well, and see no reason why this shouldn't be accepted even if it is made low priority.",

Problem Definition\r\n\r\nSome organizations would like to grant direct repo admin access to certain users, so these users can view the repo's Settings.\r\n However, they wouldn't like those users to be able to invite or remove users/groups from the repo.\r\n\r\nAt the moment this is not possible, as users with direct repo admin access, have access to all repo's Settings pages.\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n\r\n1. Either disable admins with direct repo access only from accessing the *User and group access* page of the repo.\r\n\r\n2. Since this is a feature that many users make use of and rely on, removing it may not be an option we'd want to go with. So, perhaps we could\r\n- add a new level of permissions that would allow a user to get access to the repo's Settings, with the exception of *User and group access* page.\r\n- give team/account administrators the option to disable invitations/user removals for (some) users with direct repo admin access.",
