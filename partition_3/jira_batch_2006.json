Issue Summary\r\n\r\nWhen performing a search after a page title, we have noticed that there are two links returned, one is the correct page link, but there is also a second page link which returns a Page Not found error. This issue only happened during migration from server to cloud, and only when the users migrated their site/space twice. The first import is a test run, so users deleted the spaces for the first import, they imported the space again, and the search results now contain deleted page links from the first import.\r\nh3. Environment\r\n\r\nAtlassian Cloud\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Import a Confluence space with multiple pages as a test\u00a0\r\n # Delete the space\r\n # Import again the space\r\n # Search after a page title\r\n # Notice that two links are displayed\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nSearch should return only relevant page links, not the deleted page links\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nThe search results contains also cache deleted pages from previous imports.\r\nh3. Notes\r\n\r\nWe have noticed that even if we run a Content indexing and Clear cache for the site, the issue still persists.\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nPlease contact support to open a request for CSRE. They have permission to run Elasticsearch query and update the sequence in the database\r\n * Run an Elasticsearch query to find out the max version in the index.
