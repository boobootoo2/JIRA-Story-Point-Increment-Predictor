Summary\n\nWhen accessing Confluence from a mobile device on iOS 10 and Safari, the application serves up a login screen that is invalid. This is true for all pages, even with anonymous access enabled.\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\n # Install Confluence 5.10.4 (this can also be replicated in previous versions of Confluence such as 5.9.10) \n # Enable anonymous access\n # Make sure the system add-on called the 'Confluence Mobile Plugin' is enabled\n # Access the Confluence instance using iOS 10 and the vanilla Safari browser that comes included\n # Notice you will get an invalid login prompt asking you to login to Confluence\n\nh3. Expected Results\n\nConfluence mobile should open up Confluence without asking you to log in.\nh3. Actual Results\n\nA prompt comes up in Confluence asking all users to log in every few seconds.\n\n !Login Prompt.png|thumbnail! \n\nh3. Notes\n\nThis prompt only happens in Safari that comes bundled with iOS 10.\nSwitching to Desktop version does *not* correct the situation in Cloud, and is not a workaround. Nor is disabling Confluence Mobile.\nTested in iOS 9 and it is not a problem there.\n\nh3. Workaround\n\n- Install Google Chrome or Firefox instead on the device and use that.\n- Disable Confluence Mobile by disabling the system add-on called the 'Confluence Mobile Plugin' .

Summary of suggestion\nWhen a Confluence upgrade requires the Java version to be upgraded as well, there should be a method of checking for timezone changes in the JDK updates. This is because certain timezones are considered obsolete by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA), which in turn impacts the functionalities in Confluence.\n\nThe IANA is the standards group for the protocols and mechanics of the internet. They're the group that defines [HTTP Status Codes|http://www.iana.org/assignments/http-status-codes/http-status-codes.xhtml#http-status-codes-1], your standard [TCP/IP Ports|http://www.iana.org/assignments/service-names-port-numbers/service-names-port-numbers.xhtml], as well as a globally accepted [time zone database|http://www.iana.org/time-zones].\n\nShould IANA change timezones within different Java releases, Confluence should be able to detect this and make the appropriate changes in the database.\n\nh5. Impact of the issue right now\nIf the Confluence database continues to use an obsolete timezone to store dates in the database, it will result in errors such as the ones below to be thrown:\n{code}\n2016-09-02 22:41:40,335 WARN [localhost-startStop-1] [confluence.setup.bandana.ConfluenceDaoBandanaPersister] getObjectFromValue Configuration could not be loaded because class could not be found (context: com.atlassian.confluence.schedule.ScheduledJobHistory, key: DEFAULT#CleanTempDirectoryJob).\ncom.thoughtworks.xstream.converters.ConversionException: Cannot parse date 2016-05-25 04:00:00.1 FET\n---- Debugging information ----\npath                : /list/com.atlassian.confluence.schedule.ScheduledJobHistory/startDate \nrequired-type       : java.util.Date \nline number         : 3 \nclass               : java.util.List \n-------------------------------\ncom.thoughtworks.xstream.converters.ConversionException: Cannot parse date 2016-05-25 04:00:00.1 FET\n---- Debugging information ----\npath                : /list/com.atlassian.confluence.schedule.ScheduledJobHistory/startDate \nrequired-type       : java.util.Date \nline number         : 3 \nclass               : java.util.List \n-------------------------------\n{code}\n\nThis also results in the installation date in the startup logs to appear as such:\n{code}--------------------------\nBuild Information\n--------------------------\ninstallationDate = null{code}\n\nAnd this symptom currently produces a major issue whereby users can't create pages in Confluence [due to the \"Create Page\" dialog loading indefinitely|https://confluence.atlassian.com/confkb/unable-to-create-pages-the-create-page-popup-loads-forever-after-confluence-upgrade-to-5-x-330793034.html#UnabletoCreatePages(TheCreatePagePopupLoadsForever)AfterConfluenceUpgradeto5.x-Cause2:].\n\nIn summary, if Confluence detects an instance to use a timezone that has been considered obsolete by IANA, Confluence should be able to make the appropriate modifications to rectify the issue. This also ensures the impact received by users are kept to a minimal wherever possible.",

However, for now we have duplicated users (some created for POC and others directly existing from our Active Directory)\n\n- If we erase the duplicated users (POC) users, all information and structure (spaces, pages comments etc) created by them  will disappear or remain? please advice. We would like the current structure to remain.\n\n- How is the log in process for the AD users. Do we need another link? we tried to have access with some AD users but failed.\n\nMany thanks in advance\n\nAlicia\n\n- ",

I'd love a keyboard shortcut that I could use along side an arrow key to move the row or column for my current cursor position.\n\nE.g. if I press Cmd+up (or similar), I would love if the currently focused row switched positions with the row above.

Multi-line tables pasted in from wiki markup do not convert properly (middle section). You cannot join split tables (right section). These were not problems when we could edit wiki markup. We'd simply go into the markup, edit it, fix what was formatted incorrectly, done.

Expected Results\n\nConfluence should show login page and need User A to input the credentials\nh3. Actual Results\n\nUser A could log in without any authentication.\nh3. Notes\n * The above actual results might cause some troubles in the following scenario{panel}_In case that there are some password leakages, an admin of the external directories wants the users to update their passwords immediately._\n # In the past, User A logged in Confluence with checking \"Remember my login on this computer\"\n # An admin of Crowd notices that a password of User A was leaked\n # The admin access Crowd, open user setting page of User A and set an attribute called \"requiresPasswordChange\" as \"true\" (It would require User A to update the password when the next login.)\n # In spite of the above setting, User A can log in Confluence without updating the password{panel}\n* JIRA, Bitbucket Server and Bamboo behave as well at this moment\n\nh3.

So for eg: I have an image of 5 MB rendered on a page , the original image file is downloaded .\n However, When an image with size less than 300 px is rendered on a page this image is further compressed as shown as thumbnail.\n This can be considered as a regression of https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONF-28189\n\nh5. Steps to Reproduce\n # Add an image to page ,\n # You can resize the pixel to 301 in the view file macro.\n # Save the page . View the developer console and refresh the page.\n # You will observe that the original image is downloaded.\n \nh5. Expected Results\nThe Thumbnail version of the image should be downloaded and an option should be available to set the {{THUMBNAIL_DEFAULT_WIDTH = 300}}\nThis property is hard coded in the below Class\n{code:java}\npublic class ThumbnailInfo {\n    // default thumbnail max height and max width\n    public static final int THUMBNAIL_DEFAULT_WIDTH = 300;\n{code}\n",

Summary\n\nEpic Link column in \"Insert JIRA Issue/Filter\" (a table inserted in a Confluence page) does not have an hyperlink to the corresponding Epic. Additionally, this field in Confluence does not show the name of the Epic (as Jira's equivalent column does), and does not color-code the Epic link.\nh3. Environment\n\nThis was tested with:\n * Confluence 5.10.0\n * with an Application Link to Jira v7.2.0#72002-sha1:36e1562\n\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\n\nPre-requisites:\n * Confluence and Jira have an Application Link established and working\n * In Jira there is at least one existing issue (FLP-7, bug1) which is linked to an Epic (e.g. FLP-2 with Epic name \"CSP-183740 test\") in the same project (FLP)\n\nSteps:\n # Create a new page in Confluence and write a title\n # Insert \"JIRA Issue/Filter\"\n # Write a filter to grab all the issues from project FLP\n # Open the \"Display Options\" and edit the columns to be show to be\n ** Key\n ** Summary\n ** Epic Link\n ** Epic Name\n # Click \"Insert\" and save the Confluence Page... \n\nNow navigate to Jira and search for issues:\n # Issues > Search For Issues > write a filter for 'project = \"FLP\"'\n # Configure the Columns of this query to show:\n ** Key\n ** Summary\n ** Epic Link\n ** Epic Name\n # Now observe the generated table and compare it to the one created in Confluence through Jira filter macro.\n\nh3. Expected Results\n\nBy comparing both tables, we observe that the columns in Confluence do not match the columns in Jira. There are several issues:\n # The epic link should be a link in Confluence\n # The epic link should also show the name of the Epic, to conform to what is seen in Jira\n # The epic link should also be color coded, as in Jira.\n\nh3. Actual Results\n # The Epic Link is *not a link* in Confluence. The field name implies that it should be a link to the Epic.\n # The Epic Link in Jira shows the Epic name, while in Confluence it shows the Key of the corresponding issue\n # The Epic Link in Confluence is not color coded as it is in Jira.\n\nThe screenshot below shows the difference between the same filter configured in Jira and Confluence:\n !epic-link_jira_filter_vs_confluence_macro.png|thumbnail! \n\nh3. Workaround\n\nThere is no workaround. The users have to manually lookup for the issue key corresponding to the Epic they are looking for. There is no known way to display the information as neatly as it is in Jira.",

It was traced back to an issue with the Code Macro rendering a particularly large code sample for more than 1 user concurrently.\n\nI checked the Code Macro configuration and didn't see a way to add a line limit to prevent this in the future.\n\nIt will be easy to educate our users about this issue now, but if there's no way to prevent users from doing this again I fear that we'll end up in the same situation.\n\nh3. Suggestion:\nWhat I'm looking for is find a way to prevent a confluence crash in the future. We use the code macro a lot, and when users forget about this limitation, I don't want that to lead to our Confluence instance crashing.",

But this link only shows the difference to the most recent version. Inconvenience: If a colleague makes major changes to the document, clicks save and then finds (and corrects) a little spelling error, then the link in the daily update mail will only show the change to the spelling error. Hence all other colleagues might miss that there was a major change.\n\nMy feature request:\nCould you change the daily update mail so that the \"changes\"-link compares the current version to the version that was current at the end of the previous day?\n\nIt's probably a small change with which you could make many customers happy, because there's no longer a risk to miss out on important changes.\n\nThanks in advance and greetings from Berlin\nDirk",
