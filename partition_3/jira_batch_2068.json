This means these are HTTP URLs, and when being handed over to the Java Mail framework as being wrapped in a DataHandler [com.atlassian.confluence.extra.calendar3.notification.DefaultCalendarNotificationManager.createWebResourceDataHandler(String)] for a MimeBodyPart, this will result in an HTTP request being send to its own server for resolving the resource during message construction.\n\nA typical stack looks like this:\n\n{code}\nat sun.net.www.protocol.http.HttpURLConnection.getInputStream(HttpURLConnection.java:1436)\nat java.net.URL.openStream(URL.java:1010)\nat javax.activation.URLDataSource.getInputStream(URLDataSource.java:92)\nat javax.activation.DataHandler.writeTo(DataHandler.java:290)\nat javax.mail.internet.MimeBodyPart.writeTo(MimeBodyPart.java:1403)\nat javax.mail.internet.MimeBodyPart.writeTo(MimeBodyPart.java:874)\nat javax.mail.internet.MimeMultipart.writeTo(MimeMultipart.java:444)\nat com.sun.mail.handlers.multipart_mixed.writeTo(multipart_mixed.java:102)\nat javax.activation.ObjectDataContentHandler.writeTo(DataHandler.java:869)\nat javax.activation.DataHandler.writeTo(DataHandler.java:302)\nat javax.mail.internet.MimeBodyPart.writeTo(MimeBodyPart.java:1403)\n{code}\n\nYou see that the java.net.URL.openStream is called which uses the standard lib's primitive HTTP client in order to resolve the resource.

However, there is no key (as there was in the old calendar macro), to distinguish the variously-colored entries from one another. The only way to determine what the difference is between the purple entries and the pink entries (for example) is to click on an entry of each color and read the description. There should be a way to quickly at-a-glance see what each color means.\n\nIt doesn't necessarily need to look like the old key. The key could just have a small colored box with a description next to it. It could be above or below the calendar. If you want to save space, it could be a slide-out panel from the side of the calendar, or even a simple \"Key\" button which opens a pop-up key in a modal window.\n\nJust some suggestions, but I think a key is really necessary.",

Export space from old instance\n2. Import space to new instance\n3. Export the Calendar associated with the space in the old instance\n4. Import the Calendar to the new instance, and associate it with the space\n\nI then noticed that all usages of the calendar in the pages of the space were broken - it seems that this is because they rely on the calendar id, and this gets changed during the export/import process. This means I now have to identify all uses of the calendar macro, and update them.\n\nMy suggestion is to include the calendar information in the Space export for any linked calendars, meaning that they get restored with the same id in the new instance after being imported. Failing that, another workaround would be to manually set the id for the calendar after importing to the new instance.\n\n\n",

An option to at least allow switching between 12h and 24h mode would be preferable, or perhaps an option to supply the preferred time format for a view.\n\nFor now our workaround in the monthly view (which is the one we use) is to patch the default for timeFormat in fullcalendar.js from \"h(:mm)t\" to \"HH:mm\" which gives us 24 hour time, so the functionality is there. Would prefer not to have to tamper on every upgrade. :)\n\nh4.

This project has 2 custom date-time issue fields defined in it. \n\nDiagnosed Jira team calendar integration locally and found that when custom fields are used, JIRA plugin makes one query for each issue:\n{code:language=sql}\nSELECT ID, ISSUE, CUSTOMFIELD, PARENTKEY, STRINGVALUE, NUMBERVALUE, TEXTVALUE, DATEVALUE, VALUETYPE FROM PUBLIC.customfieldvalue WHERE ISSUE='10100'\n{code}\nOur theory is that when project contains thousands of issues this would result in a considerable lag due to accumulated network latency.\n\n\nDebugging Jira plugin code revealed that the problem lies in \nDefaultDateCustomFieldDateProvider line 48:\n{code}\nObject customFieldValue = issue.getCustomFieldValue(customField);\n{code}\nwhich results in an SQL call.\n\nThe idea for a fix: make one query for all the project's issues and then access required values from memory.

I have a JIRA,Crowd,Confluence, Fisheye, Crucible server. While in the Confluence Team Calendars, I have a People Calendar for our small group. Our Confluence authentication is setup to only look into Crowd. When I go to Team Calendars and add an event on the \"People Calendar\" I only see 2 out of our 10 users when trying to create an event based off of a user (Vacation Leave). I believe those 2 users were probably in the system prior to switching to crowd. Is there simple way to allow all users from crowd to be accessible by the Team Calendars People Calendar?",

Matt changed an event from Dec 8 to Jan 3 and the email renders as such: https://skitch.com/ryan.anderson/gcmta/atlassian-mail-confluence-matt-hodges-updated-an-event-in-the-confluence-product-blogs-calendar-randerson-atlassian.com\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.
