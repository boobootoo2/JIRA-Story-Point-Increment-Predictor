So keep myself up-to-date I'm \"watching\" pages, also i have an \"rss\" set up to chow changes made to pages tagged by a specific label.\n\n\"Watching\" pages is nice, because you get diff of a page's before/after state, which RSS doesn't provide (because of https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONF-26109, which I consider an odd decision, a kind of reluctance, and in current state it is a real issue to guess what has been added/changed/removed by looking at a message in RSS without a walk in browser; a side thought: then at least would be nice to have a configuration option in RSS builder to switch off showing of a content in RSS messages to keep RSS posts concise as all-in-all they do not provide info i'm looking for).\n\nHowever \"watching\" pages itself is not perfect too. Because people create new pages here and there, and it is not possible to watch a page along with its child pages (besides, sometimes pages of interest just cannot be organized in a parent-child page structure in a natural way). At the same time it is relatively easy to train everyone in a team to use a set of tags. But again, Confluence has no way to \"watch\" changes made to a tagged content. Would be nice to have that.\n\nAnd, finally, there is another problem with \"watching\" for changes in pages:   frequently people do not make all changes to a page in a single edit. So they edit a bit, then look and remember something and edit again, or update content during a day until it is stabilized and etc. And in turn I get a couple of emails related to a single change. I wish i cold receive only one notification in this case, e.g. send a notification for a particular page only after some quiet time. Alternatively i can imagine an option to switch to a periodic (e.g. daily) receiving of \"page-watching\" notifications, with automatic merging of a changes made by a single person to a single page.\n\nWhat do you think about all that?",

The translation for \"watching\" pages is wrong in a very particular way, The german word \"\u00fcberwachen\" has many very bad connotations. The meaning is more like \"observing\" or \"supervising\". This makes every german user i encounter react, on one hand because of the actual NSA discussion, on the other hand because of german history. Surveillance made a lot of dark chapters in german history, the last not long ago in GDR before 1990. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stasi for ex. \n\nI am not that captious normally, but in that case i'd really wish that you could change the wording. There are two options that would do better: \"abonnieren\" oder \"beobachten\", whereas \"abonnieren\" is the more factual alternative with a meaning more like \"subscribe\". This would do best in my opinion. I added translations for all the occurrences of the word \"\u00fcberwachen\" to \"abonnieren\" here: https://translations.atlassian.com/dashboard/translate#/48/5085/0/ACCEPTED_TRANSLATIONS/ALL/%C3%BCberwachen\n\nBest wishes\n\nMatin\n",

That is how you market the product.

The preprocessor incorrectly assumes {{PersonalInformation}} objects contain {{username}} fields (which, as of 5.2 they now contain {{user}} fields with associated user keys).\n\nAs this is just one example of the plugin making incorrect assumptions this ticket is intended to address all of these issues (by revisiting all pre/postprocessors)",

However, the formatting that is visible on the while editing the page with the Page Properties Macro is not carried over when the page is displayed.  In other words, if I go to the \"child\" page with the Page Properties in it, I have the top row bolded with a color background.  But once I save the page, the left column is shown in bold and with a color background.  If I move the table outside of the macro field, the style/color settings are displayed correctly.  It's only when it's inside the Page Properties Macro.  And, again, the Page Properties Report macro on the \"parent\" page displays the data just fine.",

In our lozenge and clickable macros we have defined link parameter with type \"confluence-content\". \nIn previous versions of Confluence it was possible to put into this parameter both: \n- link to another Page in Confluence instance  \n- URL (for example: http://www.adaptavist.com).  \nIn Confluence 5.3+ when we put URL as a input - The macro fails to render and displays a red warning icon with the following tooltip:  \n{code}Unhandled element type '{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a'{code} \nTo reproduce issue I created very simple macro that show confluence behaviour of Confluence for parameter with type \"confluence-content\". (See the attachment)\n\nThere is workaround - to change parameter confluence-content type into string type, however we expect that version Confluence 5.3 should let us use the same type as we were using in previous versions. \n",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFSERVER-31502].\n  {panel}\n\nHi I feel the Page Layout & Section feature is a game changer in making quick, attractive and easy to read content on Confluence.\n\nI would like to suggest some additions to make it go even further!\n\n1) Allow sub-dividing and resizing of individual Sections with drag-able border rather than having to rely on hitting enter for vertical sizing, especially useful for resizing the horizontal.\n\n2) Allow part or full borders to be drawn around each individual section and fill options, with options to select which sides to render a line, margin size (so to avoid a grid look), corner style, section fill colour and line style. \n\nCurrently you have to insert a standard panel inside a section however a normal panel will only automatically fit the size of the text and not the section so you end up with different sized panels across sections and if you have sections split into 2 or 3 columns having panels of different lengths looks messy.\n\n3) Allow automatic wiki link generation for each vertical section added on a page for example the wiki link to a particular page section would be the page name followed by the section number or page name followed by the first title header of the section. This could even replace the Excerpt so sections could be embedded into other pages conveniently without having to use additional macros and allowing multi-excerpts (each page layout section automatically becomes an excerpt with a unique id).\n\n4) Create option to make entire section clickable with standard wiki link options to other other pages/sections/URLs etc\n\n5) Option to be able Expand and Collapse Sections (also ideally applied to tables, pictures, diagrams and panels).\n",

Summary\n\nWhen using the \"Create from Template\" macro, it will redirect to the dashboard and does not create anything. You can only create those templates from their original \"create button\" at the top bar.\n\nh4. Steps to reproduce\n\n# Disable all three workbox plugins *OR* disable the In-app Notifications\n# Create new page and try to use the \"Create from template\" macro. ex. meeting notes template.\n# You will notice the macro redirects to the dashboard.\n# Enable back all three workbox plugins\n# Create new page and try to use the macro - Works properly\n\nh4. Expectation\n\nThe Create from Template macro should work without depending on the workbox or in-app notification, or if it's dependent, it should produce a meaningful error message. \n\nh4.  Workaround\n\nThe workaround is to enable back all the Workbox plugins by sequence\n# Enable the Notifications and Tasks - Common Plugin\n# Enable the Notifications and Tasks - Host Plugin\n# Enable the Notifications and Tasks - Confluence Provider Plugin",
