The problem is height - when my dashboard contains a chart or a filter Results gadget I need wide columns, but sitting at the top of the column is the greenhopper-days-remaining consuming fully 1/3 of the vertical screen real-estate. I want the information. I want it to be visible, I just don't want it to use up that much height.\r\n\r\nIt's almost impossible to align gadgets left-to-right anyway.

Development Notes (!)\r\n\r\nQ: How will adding a startDate to a previously released version affect the issues that apply to it?\r\nA: (/) If a previously released version has a release date, the new start date will be validated against the release date.\r\n\r\nQ: How will adding a startDate affect issues that have been Archived?\r\nA: (/) Changes to version data do not affect issues.\r\n\r\nQ: Which timezone setting will the startDate follow, user's or system's?\r\nA: (/) Start date and release date are both stored in the JVM system time zone.\r\n\r\nQ: Can you remove the startDate after adding it?\r\nA: (/) Yes.\r\n\r\nQ: What is one way to get the startDate to come after the releaseDate?\r\nA: (/) Not possible.\r\n\r\nQ: What happens when you add a startDate to a version that has been released but has no releaseDate?\r\nA: (/) Start date can be added without release date.\r\n\r\nQ: Is there a special place in the database this column/row will go? Depending on the database used, is there a way for this location to be already taken, and/or do we recycle a location/field ID?
