Sand-57 is not.  On my Agile Board, only Sand-57 appears in the backlog, which is as expected.\r\n\r\nWhen I click the \"View in Issue Navigator\" button, it brings up another browser tab with the Issue Navigator view.\r\n\r\nNow, both Sand-56 and Sand-57 appear in the Issue Navigator list, which does not match the Backlog.\r\n\r\nThe filter that appears in Issue Navigator is:\r\n\r\nId = Sand-56 OR id = Sand-57 and sprint is empty ORDER BY Rank ASC\r\n\r\nThe reason that both appear is due to operator precedence.  I think that JIRA should have automatically added parentheses to the Issue Navigator view as follows:\r\n\r\n(Id = Sand-56 OR id = Sand-57) and sprint is empty ORDER BY Rank ASC\r\n\r\nIf I now change my Agile Board filter as follows to incorporate the parentheses, then everything works as expected (i.e. only Sand-57 appears in the Issue Navigator view):\r\n\r\n(Id = Sand-56 OR id = Sand-57) ORDER BY Rank ASC\r\n\r\nThe funkiness isn't over, though.  If I now go and view my board filter, the parentheses are gone:\r\n\r\nId = Sand-56 OR id = Sand-57 ORDER BY Rank ASC\r\n\r\nHowever, if I to to my Backlog, click \"View in Issue Navigator\", then the filter that I see in Issue Navigator is this:\r\n\r\n(Id = Sand-56 OR id = Sand-57) and sprint is empty ORDER BY Rank ASC\r\n\r\nThe parentheses are back!  This makes it challenging to differentiate between filters that have been set up to work around this issue by the addition of explicit parenthesis, and those that have not been set up.",

Summary\r\n\r\nWhen an issue is moved to an Empty Sprint/Backlog in the backlog mode of a Scrum board, the Rank value of the issue is unchanged because there's no issue to be compared with it the Sprint/Backlog where it's moved to. However, this is not documented anywhere.\r\n\r\nh4. Suggestion\r\n\r\nThis should be documented clearly, otherwise confusion might be encountered when one views the board's filter query in Issue Navigator, in which the order of the issues might not be the same top-down order as what he/she sees in the backlog mode. A KB article has been created for this at:\r\n* [Why an issue's Rank value is not changed when moved to an Empty Sprint/Backlog|https://confluence.atlassian.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=794371351]",

In other words, tweak the visibility of the swimlanes. The team should be able to see all the swimlanes, the departments should be able to see only their one swimlane.

For example, I've been waiting literally years for you to add the ability to have Story Points as the \"value\" field for the two dimensional filter.  Similarly, when you redesigned Jira and added the Reports section, all reports should have been made available as Gadgets via Dashboards.

We also use swimlanes based on Epics, to organize our current features at the top.\r\n\r\nThis means that stakeholders priority tickets are pushed to the top of our Kanban board view, which helps us plan out the most important work.\r\nIn other words, the agile board shows tickets in the same order as stakeholder priority, and works well:\r\nproject in (MyPrac, PWS) ORDER BY priority DESC, Rank ASC\r\n\r\nCurrently Jira does not allow  \"Move to Top\" or drag and drop tickets vertically in the Agile view, even though it does allow \"Rank to Top\" on individual tickets. (When viewing the as in: \r\nhttps://issues.practichem.com/browse/MyPrac-1234)\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n# Set up a Kanban board with a filter containing: ORDER BY priority DESC, Rank ASC\r\n# In the view, attempt to drag and drop the ticket vertically to adjust rank.\r\n# Or, Click on the ticket, observe that the side panel shows more ticket information on the right, then click on ... for additional actions, and then click \"Move to Top\"\r\n# Observe that Jira does not adjust the rank, and that it displays an error:\r\n# Ranking is disabled, as the Filter Query for this board is not ordered by ascending Rank. Please check your filter configuration.\r\n# Expect that Jira moves the ticket to the top of the rank within the given priority. I'd be fine with a warning, if you want. \r\n\r\nThere isn't any real reason to block the re-rank completely, since this is a scenario where we are using \"atypical\" queries. When people do use these ordering schemes, Jira should still allow the adjustment, as much as possible.\r\n\r\nSince Rank is still relevant, and still part of the query (Rank ASC), I should be able to change the rank within a priority. (Rank to Top vs Move to Top). \r\nOf course, I don't expect that drag and drop or \"Move to Top\" should affect priority. Without this, organizing rank of tickets becomes quite tedious.",

This might be because an upgrade task has failed to run or has not yet completed. Please contact your system administrator if you continue to see this message.\"_{quote}\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Generate a fresh backup From JIRA Cloud that has JIRA Software.\r\n# Install the latest available version of JIRA Software(7.0.4 as of time of this test).\r\n# Restore the backup once you are done installing.\r\n(i) When restoring, you would get an error informing you that you are installing data from a newer JIRA instance on an older one as well as one asking you to enter license. Enter the license in the available section and click proceed anyway and proceed to restore again.\r\n# JIRA should restore and ask you to login.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Result\r\nEverything works as it should as JIRA did not throw any warning while you were restoring the data.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Result\r\nJIRA would show you a banner saying JIRA Software is unavailable.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nPlease raise a support case at [support.atlassian.com|https://support.atlassian.com] if you experience any problems with this, and we can provide workaround steps.\r\n\r\nh3. Notes\r\n\r\nI have tested this and ensured that JIRA Software was installed however the issue still persisted. Likely caused by a downgrade of the JIRA Software version during the restore.\r\n\r\nh4. Extra Information\r\n\r\n* No error in the logs.\r\n* It seems like all upgrade tasks were running fine {noformat}\r\nThe following JIRA Agile upgrade tasks have been run on this system\r\n\r\n\tJAG

Part of this action is the option to \"Override variable\" for the build plan.  This works fine the first time the release is attempted.  If the build ends up failing, when you Retry Release through Jira, the Override variable is automatically filled out with the value from the first run.\r\n\r\nThe bug is that with this automatically filled out override variable is not actually passed to the Bamboo build plan.  It ends up using the default instead.\r\n\r\nThe workaround is to make sure you delete and re-add the override variable when you retry a Jira release.",

I would define these as:\r\n\r\n_An *Epic* describes a number of *Stories* all of which must be delivered in order to gain the benefit described by the *Epic*. Or to put it another way, all *Stories* in an *Epic* would be delivered into a live environment at the same time because they have limited value in their own right._\r\n\r\n_A *Theme* describes a common goal or idea which applies to many *Stories*. All of the *Stories* within an *Theme* are independent of the *Theme*. That is to say, the *Stories* do not all need to be delivered together._\r\n\r\nThis can be achieved to an extent in JIRA using the labels field or a custom 'Theme' label field to record *Themes*. However it does not allow us to record any detail about the *Theme*.\r\n\r\nThis can also be achieved by using an *Epic* as though it were a *Theme*. But this prevents a *Story* from being in both a *Theme* and an *Epic* because the *Epic Link* only allows one *Theme*. The other problem is that a *Theme* isn't really an issue type, in that it would never want to be closed, you don't deliver a *Theme* but you do deliver an *Epic*.\r\n\r\nI believe *Themes* should be catered for in JIRA very differently to a normal Issue. I have yet to find a satisfactory lo-fi solution to this. I therefore believe *Themes* should be introduced as a top level concept into JIRA.",
