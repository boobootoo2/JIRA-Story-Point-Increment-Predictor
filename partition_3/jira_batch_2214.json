I\u2019ve been feature leading a stream of work to bring image captions functionality to the editor in Confluence Cloud. I\u2019m super excited to let you know that it\u2019s now been rolled out to 100% of customers!\r\n\r\nNote: some customers have asked for a slower rollout. If you don\u2019t have it on your instance yet, this is likely why. Hold tight, you\u2019ll receive it in the coming weeks!\r\n\r\nTo add a caption to an image, simply select an image in the editor -> click on the \u201cadd a caption\u201d placeholder below the image (alternatively you can use the down arrow or the tab key to navigate to the placeholder text via the keyboard) -> and now you can freely type in a caption to appear below the image. Voila! You\u2019ve added a caption to your image.\r\n\r\nWe hope you love it as much as we do.\r\n\r\nThanks for your feedback. I\u2019m going to close this ticket out now as done.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nPaul | Feature Lead, Atlassian Cloud Editor\r\n{panel}\r\n{panel:bgColor=#e7f4fa}\r\n*NOTE:* This suggestion is for *Confluence Cloud*. Using *Confluence Server*? [See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFSERVER-2584].\r\n{panel}\r\nIt would be nice to be able to caption images in some way. Currently, if you display and center an image, the only way I can think to get a caption-like thing on it is to use a user macro to wrap the caption in, e.g., <span class=\"caption\">...</span> or something similar, but this disallows Confluence markup.\r\n\r\nMaybe just\r\n{noformat}\r\n!image.ext|caption=<markup>! \r\n{noformat}\r\n?",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFSERVER-2524].\r\n\r\n*2017-Jun-13:* Hello friend! You\u00a0probably\u00a0stumbled upon this issue after\u00a0trying to create two pages with the same\u00a0name in a Confluence space and the system complained. Bummer, right? It's okay, breathe. We've all been there. We've moved on. ;)\r\n\r\nWay way back\u00a0in 2004, the\u00a0Confluence wiki I setup under my desk was being adopted by *thousands* of people at Cisco, so I heard this frustration\u00a0*a lot.*\u00a0I created this\u00a0issue to suggest an alternative, and lots of folks chimed in with ideas.\u00a0\r\n\r\nAtlassian is a\u00a0*great company*\u00a0that does listen, and\u00a0in Nov 2011 Sherif Mansour, the Confluence Product Mgr chimed in to put this issue to rest. (see below)\r\n\r\nIt's time to [let it go|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moSFlvxnbgk&feature=youtu.be&t=56s]. :)\u00a0\r\n\r\n-Tim Colson\r\n{panel}\r\nh2. Problem Overview\r\n\r\nWiki page names must be *unique* within a space. This makes organization painful if a space contains similar topics, e.g. \"Meeting\" pages for multiple teams or projects within a single space.\r\n\r\nUpdate 2008-Jul-11: Tim updated this description to be more succinct, readable and incorporate some ideas from the three and a half years of comments below.\r\nh2. History\r\n\r\nIn December 2004, Tim Colson noted many user questions with respect to creating pages with the same name under different \"parents\". Tim brought the topic to the Atlassian mailing list where it was suggested that a Jira case would allow people to vote on the improvement if it was important to them relative to other issues.\r\n\r\nPlease vote for this improvement if you think it would be beneficial.\r\nh2. Proposal\r\n\r\n_*NOTE:* This proposal is at a high level. Obviously this problem does not have a simple solution and there are many use cases that must be carefully considered before implementing such a significant change._\r\n\r\n*Request:* Confluence should allow pages with the same name in a space *if* they have different \"parent\" pages.\r\n\r\nFor example, two \"Status Report\" pages could exist if they are for separate project teams:\r\n{code:java}\r\nANC:Q&A Testing Team/Status Report\r\nANC:Development Team/Status Report\r\n{code}\r\nWhere ANC is the space key, Q&A Testing Team and Development Team are pages and BOTH have a child page, \"Status Report\".\r\nh2. Additional Considerations\r\n\r\nSearches for \"Status Report\" would return both results, and would need to also display the hierarchy context so the user could pick the page.\r\n\r\nLinks would need a _fully qualified name_ *if* there is more than one \"Status Report\" page, perhaps using \"/\" as a divider, in similar fashion to traditional website links.\r\n{code:java|title=Fully qualified page name link}\r\n[Q&A Testing Team/Status Report]\r\n{code}\r\nNew and existing links to the *non-qualified name* (i.e. [Status Report]) would trigger one of two actions:\r\n 1) if saving a page, Confluence could validate and ask the user to select the correct alternative\r\n 2) if clicking an existing link that has become ambiguous - the user could be prompted, \"This page name is not unique, please select the correct link from these options: <list>}\r\nh2. Advantages\r\n\r\nWith this feature page names can be re-used in the hierarchy and navigation will be improved because there will no longer be a need for duplication of the parent name which creates long and redundant \"breadcrumbs\" and page titles, e.q.:\r\n\r\n*Current unique name restriction*\r\n Dashboard > Q&A Testing Team > Q&A Testing Team Status Report\r\n Dashboard > Development Team > Development Team Status Report\r\n\r\n*Improved version, no unique restriction*\r\n Dashboard > Q&A Testing Team > Status Report\r\n Dashboard > Development Team > Status Report\r\n\r\n*Summary:*\r\n Enabling non-unique page names through the use of \"namespaces\" would improve space organization, breadcrumb navigation, and PDF/HTML exports of page hierarchies.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n Timo\r\n{panel:title=Atlassian Status as of 1st November, 2011|borderStyle=solid|borderColor=#3c78b5|titleBGColor=#3c78b5|bgColor=#e7f4fa}\r\nHi everyone,\r\n\r\nFirstly, thanks for your helpful feedback on this ticket. On behalf of the Confluence team please accept our apologies for allowing this issue to remain open for some time without any Atlassian feedback.\r\n\r\nThis issue has been open for quite some time because we would really like to address this issue in Confluence. However, after looking at it in depth and discussing it internally and with external plugin developers, we've realised we won't be able to make this change to the product.\r\n\r\n*Why have we taken so long to respond to this?*\r\n With the upcoming release of Confluence 4.0 and a move to a unified editing experience, we wanted to make sure that we have exhausted all possible options to resolve this issue. As we discovered, it is much more difficult to implement than we would have hoped for with significant consequences touching every plugin, macro and every link that is in Confluence.\r\n\r\nWhen Confluence was designed initially, it shipped with the idea of \"spaces\" as a container for wiki pages related to one area of your organisation. The name \"space\" was an intentional allusion to \"namespace\", the word used by other early wiki software to indicate a group of pages where each has a unique name. This didn't seem like an unreasonable restriction; you can have as many spaces as you like, and it allows the user interface to remain simple - you can find or identify a page in a particular space simply by its title.\r\n\r\nSince then, a huge amount of development has taken place in and on Confluence with the assumption that a space key and a page title uniquely identify a page in the wiki. As Guy mentioned below, breaking this assumption would require thousands of changes to areas as wide ranging as macro parameters, APIs used by plugins, remote APIs and page list UIs. Not only would a change like this impact the large majority of plugins create and every plugin developer, but we believe this change would also have an unreasonably large impact on our end users. Every non-trivial plugin that ran in Confluence would be broken by a change to the fundamental way that you retrieve pages. Every piece of content would have to be updated for the new macro parameters, requiring an extremely long upgrade process. Many operations that require the simple selection of a page by name would have to be redesigned to account for the fact that multiple pages in a space can share the name, complicating the use of the product for all our users.\r\n\r\nWe know that many of you are asking \"but what about the suggestions on this issue\"? We've spent some time looking at all of them (and several other options). The most realistic solution would have been the \"page hierarchy in the page name\" option. However, this also has several significant implications:\r\n * It causes major confusion between parent/child hierarchies and namespaces: (Page called Foo/Bar with parent called Foo, move it to a different parent but it's still called Foo/)\r\n * Pages that might otherwise naturally have a slash in their title: (Create a page called \"Website A/B Testing\". Becomes page called \"B Testing\" in namespace \"Website\r\n * This solution would still require hundreds of UI updates everywhere a page is selected, searched for or displayed. (When do you display the full qualified title? When to do you just display the post-slash title? etc...)\r\n\r\nIn general, implementing any of the the options would come with a very large cost to the product roadmap as well. All work on other aspects of the product would have to stop for a long time in order to implement this, blocking our ability to continue to deliver improvements and other feature requests you have raised.\r\n\r\n*If we're not going to implement this feature, what will we do instead?*\r\n We still believe that organising large amounts of content is one of the main features of Confluence and we need to improve this experience. To that end, we're planning to work in the following areas that help with this problem:\r\n * scaling to larger numbers of spaces.\r\n * managing large number of spaces more easily (link to issue)\r\n * improvements to the page tree to better support organising content in large spaces\r\n * introducing the ability to create template page hierarchies (-CONF-2814-)\r\n\r\nThank you again for your long-standing interest and feedback on this issue. I can assure everyone that this was not a decision we took lightly. We're confident that the improvements we have planned will address these issues in the best way for all our customers.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n Sherif Mansour\r\n Confluence Product Manager\r\n smansour at atlassian dot com\r\n{panel}\r\n{panel:title=Timo says goodbye...}\r\nAfter nearly seven years waiting for a reply, it comes to an end.\r\n\r\nThere is a tradition amongst the Old Guard IT guys at Cisco to write a haiku when something moves on....\r\n\r\n_Same Named Pages_\r\n _Lively you were from O' four._\r\n _Seven years on...gone._\r\n\r\n(I'll need to write a haiku for wiki markup next... ;) )\r\n{panel}",

We have decided to close this issue as something we can't see ourselves doing in the foreseeable future, and I wanted to take a moment to explain why. \n\nConfluence has gone on quite a journey since the early days as an enterprise wiki - we're always a little in awe of the many wonderful and varied ways Confluence is used. In the past few months, we've done a lot of soul searching about the future direction of Confluence. We've researched how our customers use Confluence today and identified ways we can better serve all Confluence users.  We're determined to improve Confluence as platform for all teams, but have decided to concentrate our efforts specifically on helping teams collaborate on software and IT projects.  \n\nGlobal find and replace can be used in many situations, but we know the main requirement for this feature is for producing and publishing technical documentation. Focusing our development effort on helping software and IT teams collaborate means that this, and other features more typically found in help authoring and publishing tools, won't be making it onto our roadmap.  This doesn't mean that Confluence is no longer a great platform for producing documentation and we hope many teams will continue to use Confluence to write and collaborate on their internal and external documentation.\n\nWe have a vibrant and growing ecosystem of add-on developers, some of which are already developing fantastic add-ons to extend Confluence for the world of technical documentation.  In the spirit of openness and transparency, we wanted to clearly communicate that we won't be implementing global find and replace in the foreseeable future and are happy to offer up this feature for vendors in our ecosystem to implement.  We have already begin working with some vendors to see what can be done in this space. \n\nCheers,\nSherif Mansour\nConfluence Product Manager\nsherif at atlassian dot com\n{panel}",

This would allow the macro to clean up any properties, etc which it had stored against the page/space/whatever.\n\nI'm guessing this won't be too simple to add, however. The only way I could think of is to scan the diff to see if a {macro} has is no longer included. Problems which may occur are:\n\na) typos (either new or corrected ones).\nb) how do you tell if it's a start or end macro marker (may be solved with V2 renderer).\nc) what happens if someone just modifies a macro's parameters? Should the macro be notified?\n\nAnyway, it would be an incredibly useful addition, if it can be done.

I currently have a process of pre-warning people over email a couple times but processes which rely on people generally don't work that well. ;) Also I can't run around the office telling people I'm shutting the software down since there's 17 offices using Confluence.\n\nPlease consider the following improvement: Confluence administrators should be able to switch Confluence into \"shutdown mode\". In this mode, new user sessions should be prevented and everyone with an active session should see a standard \"system is going down\" message along with a message written by the administrator. Of course allow saving pages but maybe prevent opening new pages for editing?\n\nThis would make Confluence a lot more \"enterprise friendly\".

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFSERVER-2399].\n  {panel}\n\nI think adding mail list archival to Confluence is a great idea. Personally, I think the\nway we stand right now does not meet what would probably be the usual use case for adding\nmail to a wiki though. Right now, the idea of popping an email box is probably less standard\nof a use case.\n\nHere are some of my thoughts on how to improve mail archiving in Confluence.\n\nA lot of people run lists using an external list system, e.g. mailman. Those systems\ncreate archives already. They are probably run on the same machine as the wiki, so it should \nbe simple to slurp in those archives from disk. Here are some managment functions I'd like:\n\n- Be able to add an archive from a local file path, rather than upload using a Browse button\n- Be able to manage my list archives, e.g. bulk delete of messages\n- Be able to configure a 'watch' over the current archive so new messages can be added at a specific interval.\n\nAlso, we have multiple email lists, it's not clear to me how to keep these separate in\nConfluence right now. I guess one space per list is required. This is non optimal. I would prefer to have a single space that handles all my lists. How about creating a new list management plugin that handled all of this within a space. I should be able to configure multiple lists, multiple archives per list all from a single management screen.\n\nFor a good example of how to present multiple lists, check out Eyebrowse from Tigris.\nhttp://eyebrowse.tigris.org/\n\nTodd\n\n\n\n\n",

Which means we'll need to add services to Confluence.\n\nSuggested by Micheal Taylor on the confluence-users list:\n\n\"We are thinking of switching to Confluence from Twiki.  One thing that seems to be missing is notification for out-of-date pages.  We use this heavily in Twiki.  When you edit a page, you get a few radio buttons at the bottom of the edit page where you can select how long a page is valid for before it becomes out-of-date (a week, a month, a year, etc).\n\nWhen a user visits an out-of-date page, there is a warning at the top that the page may be out-of-date.  As well, the last editor of the page receives an email periodically saying which pages are out-of-date.\n\nWe would miss this sorely if we went to confluence.  I would probably have to write some sort of replacement of my own.\n\nDoes anything like this exist in Confluence?\"\n",

On a previous occation I've implemented a phonetic algorithm and permutation algorithm which basically increased the number of hits by a factor of two. Both algorithms were downloaded from codguru or something similar. 2,b is of course quite simple. \n\n",

But as we create larger document structures, we now really need a way to manage the order of child pages. \n\nWe do it now the 'old' way: to include a number as part of the page name. So page name is then something like \"1. This page\", and \"2. That page\". However that causes other problems to appear when using more then 9 child pages, as the in current version child pages are ordered using an ASCII sorting algorithme. Page \"11. Another page\" is listed besides \"1. This page\".\n\nMay be a solution is to have an additional meta-data field on each page in which we can set a integer value, and that is used for sorting. If not filled in (e.g. hided) then fall back on current sorting.",

Count Macro\n\nSo I can add the ability to have multiple counters on a page and click on the relevant counter to increment the count by 1. This is great for tracking interal requests etc. and really cool for tracking FAQ, support request popularity etc. \n\nA small graphical number with a small button to increase/decrease the count. Optional tracking counts would also be good. May require a small 'Counts Tracked' blurb for privacy concerns if this tracking is turned on.\n\n2. Vote Macro\n\nUsing the same functionality but using the text 'Add your vote'. This allows us to leverage the same core Macro code but repackage it to appeal to different contexts and different users (good for evaluators/potential clients and users). Votes should probably only be able to go up though (so there would be no decrease vote option).",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFSERVER-1882].\r\n{panel}\r\nIn addition to sharing information within my company, we would like to use Confluence for sharing certain information with our customers and clients, and have it host our public website. The one thing that is holding us back from doing this is the inability to restrict who can see a user's profile. Profiles can even be viewed by anonymous users and to my knowledge there is no way to create a named user account without also creating a profile. Someone please correct me if I'm wrong. In our case, many of our clients are also direct competitors, and the last thing we want to do is give them a list of all our employees. The same concern also applies to the names at the top of each page, on the dashboard, in the search results, etc., that tell you who last changed the page and at what date and time.\r\n\r\nI tried to come up with couple of ideas about how restriction of user profiles and user names might work. My preferred solution by far is number one but it may also be the most difficult to implement.\r\n\r\n1. A user is only allowed to see the name and profile of another user if they are in the same group. (at least one group, not all)\r\n\r\n2. Allow a global administrative option for enabling/disabling user names and profiles.\r\n\r\n3. Allow each user to decide whether their name and/or profile should be viewable.\r\n\r\nI think that this feature would be useful for many people, although I don't want to speak for other customers. Having such a feature would certainly allow the product to penetrate many more areas of my company.\r\n{panel:title=Atlassian Status as of\u00a0March 2021|borderStyle=solid|borderColor=#3c78b5|titleBGColor=#3c78b5|bgColor=#e7f4fa}\r\nThanks for your suggestions and feedback on this issue. We do agree that restricting access to user names and profiles could be valuable for users, particularly in an externally-facing Confluence environments.\r\n\r\nSome of you have also shared concerns around data privacy legislations being enforced in Europe next year. We'd like to assure you that Atlassian is committed to data privacy. Read more about this in our [blog|https://www.atlassian.com/blog/announcements/atlassian-and-gdpr-our-commitment-to-data-privacy].\r\n\r\nThe use cases stemming from external collaboration do touch quite a number of features in the product including user profiles, people directory, mentions, shares, comments and search. *We are excited to share that External Collaboration will be added to Confluence Premium in the coming months. We will open up a free beta program of the feature within the next quarter, and will provide updates here as soon as you're able to sign up.*\r\n\r\nMany thanks,\r\n Confluence Product Management\r\n{panel}",

Something I see as being a big selling point would be the ability for the following:\n\nContext 1 - containing Confluence with its own datasources ... as exists already\nContext 2 - containing administration servlets and its separate datasources (in case something goes wrong with Context 1)\n\nThe administration servlets would be able to monitor Confluence, take backups from Confluence and store them separately, check for updates from the website and download them automatically (emailing the administrator when a new one is available), upgrade Confluence and if something goes wrong during upgrade be able to roll back.\n\nThink \"windows update\" [download updates and tell me when they are ready to install], for Confluence (and even Jira). The benefit of this would be that minor patches could be released separately (a few times before I've been emailed an updated class as a temporary fix to a problem until a new release is done).\n",

To combat this, it would be nice to set up some kind of review mechanism whereby the author could choose to be notified in, say, 6 months' time that he needs to review the page.  \n\nI just happened across a whole load of stuff I wrote ages ago in serious need of updating, so I thought this might be a useful feature to consider in choosing to use Confluence over some other content management systems.\n\nCheers,\n\n  Mike",
