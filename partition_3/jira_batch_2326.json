The new page has no problems with misaligned side-by-side diffs.\r\n\r\nYou can find more information in the Bitbucket Server 7.0\u00a0[release notes|https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/bitbucket-server-7-0-release-notes-990546638.html] and Pull Requests [documentation|https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/review-and-discuss-a-pull-request-808488540.html].\r\n\r\nPlease, don't hesitate to leave feedback on the feature in the comments. This will help us to priorities further development.\r\n\r\nAnton Genkin\r\nProduct Manager Bitbucket Server\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to reproduce:\r\n\r\n================================\r\n0. make sure you are in side-by-side diff view\r\n1. when it is open, ctrl+g and type fdevice.\r\n2. press enter a few times to just go through the searches.\r\n3. alignment is off by a lot\r\n================================\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nNone",

Problem Definition\r\n\r\nIf you run the Bitbucket installer without admin privileges, It throws the generic error:\r\n{quote}You do not have administrator rights to this machine.\r\n You will not be allowed to install Bitbucket as a service or listen on any port that's not permitted by your firewall\r\n{quote}\r\nHowever If you are upgrading on a server that already has a service installed, It will fail to set the BITBUCKET_USER variable in {{bin/set-bitbucket-user.sh}}, making it blank. Hence Bitbucket can run under different user accounts other than the service account.\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nHave the installer detect the old BITBUCKET_USER variable, and determine if it requires admin privileges to update the new BITBUCKET_USER variable. Throw a more clear error if it cannot perform this update, or update the new variable with the old value.\r\nh3. Why this is important\r\n\r\nIf you run Bitbucket with root, this can cause the {{/bb-data/log/bitbucket.pid}} file to be created under root. So if the user Bitbucket uses is rectified to use the service account and the {{bitbucket.pid}} file exists, Bitbucket cannot edit this file, causing Bitbucket to fail during startup. This file has to be manually removed with someone with root access. It can also create loss of data if other files are written. Example, files written while checking in code can become unaccessible, due to the user change. This could result in future checkins not being written.\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nThere is a few possible workarounds.\r\n # Run the installer with administrator rights when upgrading.\r\n # Manually edit\u00a0{{bin/set-bitbucket-user.sh}}\r\n # Modify the service to run with a\u00a0{{sudo -u}}\r\n\r\n\u00a0",

But in Bitbucket, i have to browse through the folders to find the file.\r\n\r\nWell, we already have a search bar in side-menu. Just add a file search too there. It will be really easy for us!. Currently its not possible without any tweaks.\u00a0\r\n\r\nI am browsing through multiple repositories for many files, so when i don't know the actual folder name but only a file name, this functionality will really help.\r\n\r\nPlease checkout the same functionalities by GitHub :D\u00a0- wild file name search.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n Nikhil",
