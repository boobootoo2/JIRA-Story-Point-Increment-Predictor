(Which it surprisingly common :)\n\n----\nFor example, in the {{Guyzmo/git-repo}} project, following [the official docs|https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/hyperlinking-to-source-code-in-bitbucket-824476709.html] I can view the {{devel}} branch with this URL:\\\\\n[{{https://bitbucket.org/guyzmo/git-repo/src/devel}}|https://bitbucket.org/guyzmo/git-repo/src/devel]\n\nEasy enough, but here&#x27;s the problem:\n\nFor the {{bugfix/conftest_fix}} branch, bitbucket provides a 404 for a similar URL: [{{https://bitbucket.org/guyzmo/git-repo/src/bugfix/conftest_fix}}|https://bitbucket.org/guyzmo/git-repo/src/bugfix/conftest_fix]\\\\\nAnd we get the same result if we URL-encode the slash: [{{https://bitbucket.org/guyzmo/git-repo/src/bugfix%2Fconftest_fix}}|https://bitbucket.org/guyzmo/git-repo/src/bugfix%252Fconftest_fix]\n\n_When using the site to view the branch we get a {{/src/<commit hash>/?at=<branch/name>}} URL.  So while this is a workaround, it makes for more awkward ergonomics. :/_\n\n----\nIdeally, a fix would make either of the above 404&#x27;ing URLs start to work. Thanks!",
