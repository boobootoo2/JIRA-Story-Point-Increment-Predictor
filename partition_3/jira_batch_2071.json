All in all it works really well, but it would be much more useful if we could do that following:\n\n- We use the calendars to track release calendars across our products and platforms, and external partners. One frustration we have is that within each calendar we typically only use the \"event\" option, but we can't customize this at all. This is super annoying. For example we want to have 1 partner calendar to track all those release dates and milestones and be able to color code them. Unfortunately we can only do that by creating a new calendar (this is really annoying for the team working on all the partner projects as they have to keep adding and removing calendars frequently).\n- Create an easily printable view for a user specified amount of time (1 week to multiple months)\n- Create the ability to export the team calendar info - PDF and spreadsheet would be great (Would be super helpful for when we work with external partners for project management)\n- Create the ability to view more than 1 month at a time. Ideally if I scrolled down on a month view it would pull in the next weeks and I wouldn't have to skip to the next month. Or I could specify the date ranges to Display",

I have a few questions that I need to resolve before upgrade production version of our Team Calendars:\n\n1) Our company employees use jointly some calendars (as on attached screenshot). Bring new feature as \"Events\" do confusion for our employees because each calendar explicitly define what kind of even to create and there is no need for additional events for each calendar. And it is obviously that it is no need to have even \"leaves\" for Meetings calendar or Business Trips calendar.\n\nSo my questions is how to hide events at all?\n\n2) What is acceptable with Team Calendars new release is icons. That is why I would like to find out how to stick icon - \"airplane\" with Business Trip calendar, icon \"leaves\" with Annual and Compensatory Leaves Calendar and so on.\n\n3) As well I would like to know how to add our own icons to another calendars such as Absence to due Illness, Meetings, Out of the Office Reports?",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFSERVER-50379].\n  {panel}\n\nTeam Calendars 4.0 shipped with the idea of event types.\n\nWe've been thinking that towards the long-term we want to head towards the ability for customers to create their own types of events.\n\nThis issues encompasses the idea of being able to create a type of event for a calendar. This would include potential things as: \n* The event name (Kind of incorporated by TEAMCAL-765)\n* A possible icon (See TEAMCAL-430)\n* A colour (See TEAMCAL-364)\n\nThis issue is to track the overall demand for this. To help us better understand your problems, we'd love to hear your thoughts on this. Could you see yourself using it? How? And can you give us examples of the types of events you would create to provide a better understanding? \n\n{panel}\nHi Everyone,\n\nThanks for your feedback on this issue. Please note the \"priority\" set on this issue isn't the actual priority of the feature on our roadmap. There isn't a way for us to hide the unused fields in this project.\n\nWe do feel this feature request is a _very_ important part of Team Calendars and I can advise that it is on our short-term roadmap. Unfortunately, for us to enable you guys to create your own types of events for each calendar requires a significant architectural change. The good news is our team is working on this change right now. This re-architecture will also enable us to build other highly requested features as well as provide a significant performance improvement. \n\nSo our first step is to get this re-architecture right! We want to create a stable foundation for the future of Team Calendars. Following that, this will be the next thing we will tackle on our roadmap.\n\nThank you for your patience with this issue. If you are going to comment, please make it useful in terms of providing some context for the types of events you want to create.\n \nCheers,\nSherif Mansour\nTeam Calendars Product Manager\n{panel}",

It would be nice to be able to add a monthly, reoccurring task based off the day of the week. Our IT department uses Team Calendar heavily and this was the feature they asked us the very first day when we requested them to switch from Outlook to Team Calendar. We have our Production Code Push every second Saturday of the month and there are other events that occur every 3rd Saturday and some every 4th Saturday. We might be the only one requesting this feature. Since Atalassian listens to the feedback from every customer, i am creating this feature request. This might be not get as many votes. But, if you feel like, this is a genuine request, please implement this feature.

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFSERVER-50310].\n  {panel}\n\nWith the release of Calendars 4.0 the notion of a generic People calendar has gone away. An Event calendar can be associated with a user, however that user information is not easily seen on the Event calendar without clicking into the Event.\n\nWe use Calendars for our support on-call rotation. Prior to version 4 we had a People calendar called \"On Call\" which clearly indicated who was on call for a given week. We've totally lost that ability with Calendars 4. I can name an Event \"On Call\" and associate the user with that week of support duty, but you have to click twice (once on the event, then edit) to actually see the name of the person that's on call.\n\nThis is a significant feature degradation from the 3.2.x version of Calendars.\n\nSo, as a user I would like an Event calendar that's associated with a user to clearly display the user on the calendar so that I don't have to click twice to get this information.\n\nAs an aside, I realize that there's \"Leave\" and \"Birthday\" calendars which are more analogous to the old People calendar, but since they are hard coded with those names it would be totally unintuitive to use them for any other purpose, such as an on call calendar.",

For example, when today is March 1, I can see everything that is upcoming for the next 4 weeks but then when today is March 27 the \"month\" view is showing mostly the past several weeks, which has been cluttered with a lot of no longer relevant details. This is a very common usability problem in calendar apps. \n\nIt would be nice if there were another view mode of 'next 4 weeks', with the current week always on top. That way, the calendar is always showing the upcoming schedule not the past schedule.\n\nThere's a similar request for Outlook:\nhttp://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/office/en-US/acd04b88-6890-4bac-8f48-3028085ed2bd/outlook-2010-view-calendar-view-for-weeks-ahead-not-weeks-past?forum=outlook\n\n",

Then, have the ability to expand the calendar downward, either by dragging (like this comment box) or by adding extra space via a button.\n\nSo if you have a huge amount of tasks currently on your timeline, you will be able to see as many as you want, rather than be limited once they hit the top of the allowed space.\n\nRecap:\n1) Add ability to put calendar axis at top of timeline instead of bottom\n2) Add ability to control vertical size of timeline",

Problem Definition\nCurrently the both the timeline and calendar views have their horizontal sizes fixed, regardless the size of the page and the resolution of the screen. As a result, Team Calendars displayed on bigger screens or in a 90% rotation don't use the screen space efficiently, e.g.:\n!Screen Shot 2015-06-18 at 13.29.58.png|thumbnail!\n\nh3. Suggested Solution\nIt would be great to have the autosizing for the Team Calendar views. This would be more comfortable, e.g. when displaying the timeline view page with a big screen with number of events, showing the calendars on a vertically rotated screen.",

When you first log in to a new Team Calendars instance, you're presented with a getting started dialog. The second area is the WorkBox notification, when Team Calendars has been installed or upgraded, users are notified via WorkBox and that notification includes the old Team Calendars logo.\n\nThis doesn't have to get done by August 27th, but would be good to slip into TC 4 if it's just a quick fix. I've attached the logo to this ticket.",
