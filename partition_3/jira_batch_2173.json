Steps to reproduce:\n# Create a page\n# Edit the page and insert a link e.g. http://localhost/asdsadsad/asdsadsa'asdsad'asdsad\n# Linking does not work when the link contains single quote or curly braces\n\nAs referred here: http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1738.txt\n{quote}\n  Usually a URL has the same interpretation when an octet is\n   represented by a character and when it encoded. However, this is not\n   true for reserved characters: encoding a character reserved for a\n   particular scheme may change the semantics of a URL.\n\n   Thus, only alphanumerics, the special characters \"$-_.+!*'(),\", and\n   reserved characters used for their reserved purposes may be used\n   unencoded within a URL.\n{quote}\n\nh5. Workaround:\n\nNormally Tinny URLs don't have quote or any other special characters. Hence, you can use them instead of full link. If your current links are referring to other Confluence's page you can use Confluence Tinny URL from [Confluence Page Information|https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/view-page-information-139408.html].",

This sets the internal char array of the StringBuffer to 16 chars by default. Each time you do an append the StringBuffer internally resizes at certain intervals. This uses additional CPU and memory for internal char array copies each time the appended amount exceeds the limits of the internal array. Though for a single execution of the method the performance impact may be negligible with a heavy loaded system with hundreds or thousands of users this could help scalability.\n\nAdditionally in the same method : \n\n        if (!publicFeed)\n        {\n            // Add authentication type parameter. Here we use BasicAuth to authenticate the rss feed.\n            String authType = \"&\" + SecurityConfigFactory.getInstance().getAuthType() + \"=\" + SecurityConfig.BASIC_AUTH;\n            rssString.append(authType);\n        }\n\nShould be re-written to make better use of the StringBuffer append instead of concatenating Strings which in this case the authType concat operation creates 6 or 7 strings before being assigned to authType.\n\n        if (!publicFeed)\n        {\n            // Add authentication type parameter. Here we use BasicAuth to authenticate the rss feed.\n\n            rssString.append('&');\n            rssString.append(SecurityConfigFactory.getInstance().getAuthType());\n            rssString.append('=');\n            rssString.append(SecurityConfig.BASIC_AUTH);\n        }\n\nCalling append is typically better performance than concatenating String objects.\n\n",

The comment is no longer editable and subsequent comments become obscured or invisible, which then breaks the ability to add any new comments to the page. Also, the toc macro incorrectly displays the ordering of the subsequent headings in its bullet lists.\n\nSorry, I broke your Confluence 4.0 Editor - What's Changed for Wiki Markup Users page this way just now.

(using the \\{color} macro).\n\nThese days, users are restricted to only being able to easily use colours that are available in the colour picker in the editor toolbar. If you want to use a different colour, you have to use the insert wiki markup dialog.\n\nIt would be great if there was a way to easily select other colours.  This could be accomplished, for example, by allowing a user or administrator to customise the colours that appear in the picker, or adding an option to the picker that allows an arbitrary colour choice to be typed in.\n\nThis was raised by a customer on answers.atlassian.com: [https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/35516/how-do-i-revert-to-the-default-text-color-in-the-confluence-4-x-editor]",

It creates the <a> but without a href attribute.  In 3.5 and earlier, you could create a link for any protocol type using wiki markup: \\[something://mysite.com\\].  Inserting the wiki markup results in the link being stripped and the URI appearing as plaintext.\r\n\r\nThe only workaround is to insert a link manually with the HTML macro, but not all sites will be able to enable this macro for security reasons.\r\n\r\nh3.

When the export has been opened in a webbrowser, the thumbnail for ImageA is visible, but cannot be clicked to view the full size.\n\nSo, in a nutshell, if you are using a gallery macro that includes an image attachment from other space, I think the correct is to export this image together when exporting the original space where the gallery macro resides.",

Few minor manuall corrections later I had the template I wanted.\n\nNow the \"view in Wiki markup\"-option is gone, whilst templates still must be written in wiki markup. \n\nMy questions: \n\na) is the a way to see a page in wiki markup?\n\nb) do you know any other workaround to solve this?\n\nc) are you allready planning to fix the template editor, so that wiki markup is no longer neccessary?\n\nThank you very much in advance!\n\nBest, \n\nViktor \n\nPS: Several other users seen to have the same problem.

I would love to be able to choose when to save a draft and not wait for some auto magic to do it for me...)\n* once auto-saved it will be in your drafts\n* go to the same space and try to add another blog post. You will get notification that there is already one draft and whether you'd like to resume editing it\n* hit cancel on that page and you lose the draft you had before\n\nSuggested improvement:\n* once a draft is saved and has a name, the user should never be able to delete it, except explicitly via the 'Drafts' page or any link that actually says it will delete the link. The 'cancel' button from the example above does not count as such\n* users should be able to create multiple drafts in one space as long as they're given an unique name",

To do this, we should:\n\n*  Add a \"Space Administrator(s)\" column to the space directory that lists the names of users (we can set a hard-limit to the number and do a ... if there are heaps.\n* In Browse > Advanced also add the space admins here with the other space metadata.

Summary of The Bug\n\nWhen page title have any character after a colon( : )\n\n{code}\nOffice Connector:test\n{code}\n\noffice connector can't find the office files attached to the page. If colon is the last character on the page title, attached office files searchable by view office macro\n\nh3. How to reproduce the bug\n\n# Create a page (example: 'Office connector:')\n!Officepage.png|thumbnail!\n# Attached office file into the page\n!attached.png|thumbnail!\n# Try to view it using view office plugin\n!Works.png|thumbnail!\n# Change the page title to contain any character after colon (example: 'Office connector:test')\n!test.png|thumbnail!\n# Try to view it using view office plugin\n!broke.png|thumbnail!\n# Attached files can't be seen on \"File Name\" fields\n(i) When viewed with _Developer Tools_, the {{attachmentsearch.action}} GET request returned HTTP 404 error code.\n\nh3. Workarounds\nOption 1 - Rename the page to remove the ':'\n\nOption 2 - Use the insert markup feature:\n# From the editor toolbar, expand the '+' menu.\n# Choose 'Markup'.\n# Insert the following markup (change accordingly):\n{code}\n{view file:name_of_the_attachments.ext}\n{code}\n# Save\n\nh1. Work performed\n* Changes are backwards-compatible in the plugin, committed in https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/officeconnector issue/CONF-24540 . 2 backwards-compatibility issues were raised: CONFDEV-10156 and CONFDEV-10157.\n* Changes in confluence-core are still on issue/CONF-24540, and awaiting implementation of a few review comments before being committed.\n",
