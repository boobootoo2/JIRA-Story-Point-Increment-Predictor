Not sure if this is different, but it's worth noting since we would love to see improvement here. \n\nWhen pasting Markdown in the converter in Confluence, the text doesn't convert properly. An anonymized version is attached for what we tried converting. The text prints out as one continuous line of text, with no formatting whatsoever. \n\nIf there were someway to integrate the actual converter (http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/dingus) into Confluence, that would be great. Anything that improves this feature would be a step up and greatly appreciated. \n\nThanks in advance.",

Also that would then be possible.\n\nh2. Alternative solution\nAn alternative or additional solution would be to produce macros \"Inline\" and \"PositionHere\". \n\n\"PositionHere\" macro would position its contents as if the top-left of the page would be the \"current cursor position. (So people could place their Code Block or Page Tree into that macro, which could then be indented or to the right of some text.)\n\n\"Inline\" macro would start the macro output at \"current cursor position\" but at the right end of the line (and at any linebreak) it would go on from the left. (Even if another macro such as Page Tree inside the Inline macro tries to produce its output as a separate paragraph.)\n\nThus, \"Inline\" means simply \"Start macro output here as any other text\" (or \"indent just the first line, to this point\", whereas \"PositionHere\" means \"also indent every following line this much\"). That would be great for, e.g., using include or Excerpt Include in the middle of a paragraph.\n\n*If the panel macro would have an option for left margin* and/or left padding, that would be* exactly the \"PositionHere\" macro *(once you make border and background white), provided that there are also top and bottom margin options (I would set them 0). Then it would be just a box in the middle of the page without additional margins. ",

With more and more OS slowly moving to the more modern systemd approach (see: https://blog.ambientia.fi/2014/06/09/managing-confluence-as-a-service-with-systemd/ ), we need to also cater for this change. \n\nAs a workaround, you can follow the instructions written by Jussi Haaja here:\n{quote}\nMy solution can be downloaded from: http://jussiha.staff.ambientia.fi/downloads/confluence-tomcat-systemd.zip , place files in directory libexec to /usr/libexec/ambtomcat, the sysconfig/confluence file to /etc/sysconfig and system/confluence.service to /etc/systemd/system. All configuration related to service (JAVA_OPTS etc.) is done in /etc/sysconfig/confluence, which means that the traditional way of configuring  Tomcat startup parameters via setenv.sh is not utilized at all. If you are not using Fedora 20, you also need the file /usr/share/java-utils/java-functions from package javapackages-tools to use this solution. To get the file, see the Fedora package sources here.\n\nReview both the sysconfig and the service file so that the file paths reflect your installation. After you are done, Confluence can be started by invoking systemctl start confluence. Review that the startup works by using journalctl \u2013f \u2013u confluence.service\n{quote}",

So, to continue the example, if I clicked on 124 on the top, just AAA and CCC would be shown.  \n\n\nh2. Use Case\nThis would help people use consistent label names when labeling new attachments, and allow people to know what terms to filter on.\n\nLabel List Macro does not fit this need. {quote}tried to use Labels List, but as you indicated it lists all labels within the space. I want to be able to limit the list to the page (our space is large and listing all labels is unruly and makes it harder rather than easier to figure out what is on the page).{quote}\n\n",

However, I'm using an OnDemand instance so Connect is what I have to work with. I'd love to be able to create a Space Blueprint plugin, but it looks like it's not yet supported in the Connect framework. Can you add this as a new feature?\n\nThanks!\n\nMatt",

Because of these two things, I always have to pause and _think_ when I come to this dialog (and I use it a lot!). \n\nI recommend: \n# Swap the order (URL field is second)\n# Add placeholder text to the URL field, e.g. \"http://www.example.com\"\n# Change the labels so there's no ambiguity. Either of these is better:\n* Text to display\n* Address\nor \n* Text\n* Link\n\nI've attached a mock-up of how this could look. \n\nThanks for listening! :)\n",

Suggested Solution\nCompleted macros when Copied and Pasted should be rendered as if they were input manually\nFor Example, the following examples are rendered in plain text if pasted into a Confluence Page\nPanel Macro:\n{noformat}{panel:titlebgColor=red|title=Test}{noformat}\nJUnitReport Macro:\n{noformat}{junitreport:directory=file:///Users/user}{noformat}\n\nIf manually input on the page or utilize the \"Insert Markup\" option, the macros render correctly\n\nSee:\n!Example.png|thumbnail!\n \nh3. Workaround \n- Macro must be input manually\n- Use Insert Markup\n- Completed macro is copied directly from another Page",
