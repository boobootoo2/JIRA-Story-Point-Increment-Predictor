      "description": "When rendering the branch list page, if non-UTF-8 commit messages are encountered, Jackson will abort JSON production, leaving an incomplete JSON object (see end of description for stack trace).\r\n\r\nThe likely cause is a user setting their accepted character encoding for git to a non-UTF-8 character set (eg EUC-JP). Stash assumes the git default is used by all users.\r\n\r\nPending reproduction there are likely to be two approaches:\r\n# remove the commit messages from the branch list JSON before rendering; this will only be a stop-gap as it does not prevent the problem occurring in other parts of the application\r\n# perform normalization or non-UTF-8 character stripping at read time; this will be more time

Remove escape option (undocumented feature already = \"no\" harm done...)\r\n2. Make another character the escape character (i.e. use a character that is much rarer to control this)\r\n3.

      "description": "I first noticed this issue when I had the YACC plugin to authenticate Stash User names against Git use renames as a pre-commit hook server side.  \r\n\r\nI had a new employee trying to use stash so we made a new repo for them and followed the directions that stash prints out how to set username and email:\r\n\r\n{{git config --global user.name \"USERNAME\"}}\r\n{{git config --global user.email \"EMAIL\"}}\r\n\r\nThe issue we ran into is that the employees name ends in a period (Last Name, First Name Initial PERIOD)\r\n\r\nIt \"appears\" that git is stripping trailing periods off the username when you make a commit.  So my suggestion would be to update this information to provide a correct _git compatible_ username.\r\n\r\nI opened an initial bug with the YACC plugin which you can see here:\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/sford/yet-another-commit-checker/issues/30#issuecomment-57577851\r\nAs seen the YACC maintainer was able to duplicate my issue:\r\n\r\n{code}\r\ncd periodtest/\r\ngit init\r\ngit config user.name \"Test.\"\r\n\r\n# verify that user.name is 'Test.'\r\ngit config user.name\r\n\r\ntouch README\r\ngit add README\r\ngit commit -a -m \"period test\"\r\n\r\n# check user name after commit\r\ngit log \r\n{code}\r\n\r\nAnd the resulting commit w/out the period was:  \r\n\r\n{code}\r\ncommit 9b7e4960fd8129059b5759d1bb937b60241fd70b\r\nAuthor: Test <email@test.com>\r\nDate:   Wed Oct 1 20:28:28 2014 -0700\r\n\r\n    period test\r\n{code}\r\n\r\n\r\n*UPDATE:*  According to a reply on my stack overflow post: http://stackoverflow.com/a/26219423/2069812 - this is actually true git behavior and it will truncate various characters from the end of the line.\r\n\r\n",

As the issue hasn't collect votes, watchers, comments, or support cases from many customers during its lifetime, it's very low on our priority list, and will not be fixed in the foreseeable future. That's why we've decided to resolve it as *Timed Out*.\r\n\r\nAlthough we're aware the issue is still important to those of you who were involved in the conversations around it, we want to be clear in managing your expectations. The Bitbucket Server team is focusing on issues that have broad impact and high value, reflected by the number of comments, votes, support cases, and customers interested. Please consult the [Atlassian Bugfix Policy|https://confluence.atlassian.com/support/atlassian-bug-fixing-policy-201294573.html] for more details.\r\n\r\nWe understand how disappointing this decision may be, but we hope you'll appreciate our transparent approach and communication. If you're really passionate about this suggestion, please comment with your case in detail and we'll reconsider. Atlassian will continue to watch this issue for further updates, so please feel free to share your thoughts in the comments.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nImran Khan\r\nProduct Manager - Bitbucket Server and Data Center\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\nWhen selecting \"Read Only, with Local Groups\" for the \"Connecting Stash to an existing LDAP directory\" use case, the customer is shown the \"Default Group Memberships\" option dynamically on the UI. Our documentation doesn't contemplate that. It would add more clarity to it if we could add it. I am talking about the documentation below:\r\n\r\nhttps://confluence.atlassian.com/display/STASH/Connecting+Stash+to+an+existing+LDAP+directory#ConnectingStashtoanexistingLDAPdirectory-LDAPpermission\r\n\r\nThis parameter is explained on \"Delegating Stash authentication to an LDAP directory\": https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/STASH/Delegating+Stash+authentication+to+an+LDAP+directory#DelegatingStashauthenticationtoanLDAPdirectory-Copyingusersonlogin\r\n\r\nThis brought confusion to me while troubleshooting https://support.atlassian.com/browse/SSP-5729",

      "description": "Our company has a peculiar requirement from the legal team that:\r\n- givenName is the given name of the user on their birth certificate\r\n- sn is the surname of the user on their birth certificate\r\n- displayName / cn is the name they go by day-to-day\r\n\r\nSo we end up with lots of cases such as \"Mark Anderson\" who are really \"Chris Anderson\" or \"Steven Smith\" who is \"Paul Smith\". This causes major confusion for our users who are only peripherally aware of the legal requirements, and don't know each other's legal names.\r\n\r\nThere are other cases where the legal name might have multiple names like \"Jean Luc Picard\" where the person might go by \"Jean Picard\". Searching on \"Jean Picard\" in this case when adding a user to a group or access controls fails, I believe.\r\n\r\nThe confusion is anywhere that Stash lists users such as the access controls, or group members. It affects search because it is really difficult to find these people.\r\n\r\nPlease change the behaviour so that when a \"display name\" is warranted, it will use \"displayName\" or \"cn\" (ideally configurable) instead of sandwiching \"givenName\" and \"sn\" together.\r\n\r\nI'll note that different Atlassian tools work differently here, but most of them in my experience use a \"displayName\", and Stash is more of the odd man out here. I know this because our other tools - JIRA, Confluence, Bamboo, etc. don't seem to be having this problem. (I'll note that Confluence actually does it *both* ways... mostly they use \"displayName\" or \"cn\", but sometimes, as is the case with personal space titles, they use \"givenName sn\", and our users also complain about this...)\r\n",

However when the applications running locally need to talk to crowd for directory synchronization or authentication they talk directly to crowd's HTTP connector: http://localhost:8011/crowd/services\r\n\r\nHere's the Stash configuration:\r\nmysql> use stash;\r\nmysql> select * from cwd_directory_attribute;\r\n| directory_id | attribute_value                       | attribute_name                                       |\r\n|        32769 | atlassian-security                    | user_encryption_method                               |\r\n|       229377 | toolkit-stash                         | application.name                                     |\r\n|       229377 | XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX               | application.password                                 |\r\n|       229377 | false                                 | com.atlassian.crowd.directory.sync.issynchronising   |\r\n|       229377 | 67                                    | com.atlassian.crowd.directory.sync.lastdurationms    |\r\n|       229377 | 1411501798895                         | com.atlassian.crowd.directory.sync.laststartsynctime |\r\n|       229377 | http://localhost:8011/crowd/services/ | crowd.server.url                                     |\r\n|       229377 | true                                  | crowd.sync.incremental.enabled                       |\r\n|       229377 | 600                                   | directory.cache.synchronise.interval                 |\r\n|       229377 | true                                  | useNestedGroups                                      |\r\n\r\nstash-config.properties has:\r\nplugin.auth-crowd.sso.enabled=true\r\n\r\n========== Stash logs during SSO authentication attempt ==========\r\n2014-09-23 14:55:39,675 DEBUG [ajp-bio-9014-exec-6] 895x37x1 172.16.45.8 \"GET /rest/capabilities HTTP/1.1\" c.a.s.i.s.s.PluginAuthenticationProvider attempting authentication with authenticator com.atlassian.stash.stash-auth-crowd-sso:crowdSsoAuthHandler\r\n2014-09-23 14:55:39,688 INFO  [ajp-bio-9014-exec-6] 895x37x1 172.16.45.8 \"GET /rest/capabilities HTTP/1.1\" c.a.c.s.client.ClientPropertiesImpl Loading property: 'application.name' : 'toolkit-stash'\r\n2014-09-23 14:55:39,688 INFO  [ajp-bio-9014-exec-6] 895x37x1 172.16.45.8 \"GET /rest/capabilities HTTP/1.1\" c.a.c.s.client.ClientPropertiesImpl Loading property: 'application.login.url' : 'https://toolkit.xxxxxxxxxxxxxx.tld/stash/login'\r\n2014-09-23 14:55:39,688 INFO  [ajp-bio-9014-exec-6] 895x37x1 172.16.45.8 \"GET /rest/capabilities HTTP/1.1\" c.a.c.s.client.ClientPropertiesImpl Loading property: 'session.tokenkey' : 'atl.crowd.sso.tokenkey'\r\n2014-09-23 14:55:39,688 INFO  [ajp-bio-9014-exec-6] 895x37x1 172.16.45.8 \"GET /rest/capabilities HTTP/1.1\" c.a.c.s.client.ClientPropertiesImpl Loading property: 'session.lastvalidation' : 'atl.crowd.sso.lastvalidation'\r\n2014-09-23 14:55:39,688 INFO  [ajp-bio-9014-exec-6] 895x37x1 172.16.45.8 \"GET /rest/capabilities HTTP/1.1\" c.a.c.s.client.ClientPropertiesImpl Loading property: 'session.validationinterval' : '3'\r\n2014-09-23 14:55:39,688 INFO  [ajp-bio-9014-exec-6] 895x37x1 172.16.45.8 \"GET /rest/capabilities HTTP/1.1\" c.a.c.s.client.ClientPropertiesImpl Failed to find value for property: cookie.domain\r\n2014-09-23 14:55:39,696 DEBUG [ajp-bio-9014-exec-6] 895x37x1 172.16.45.8 \"GET /rest/capabilities HTTP/1.1\" c.a.s.p.a.c.i.CachingRetryingSupplier Failed to retrieve the value (Could not retrieve SSO Configuration ({1})), not retrying before Tue Sep 23 14:55:23 EDT 2014\r\n2014-09-23 14:55:39,696 DEBUG [ajp-bio-9014-exec-6] 895x37x1 172.16.45.8 \"GET /rest/capabilities HTTP/1.1\" c.a.s.p.a.c.i.CrowdSsoAuthenticationHandler Skipping Crowd SSO as it is not enabled\r\n2014-09-23 14:55:39,696 DEBUG [ajp-bio-9014-exec-6] 895x37x1 172.16.45.8 \"GET /rest/capabilities HTTP/1.1\" c.a.s.i.s.s.PluginAuthenticationProvider attempting authentication with authenticator com.atlassian.stash.stash-authentication:crowdHttpAuthHandler\r\n2014-09-23 14:55:39,696 DEBUG [ajp-bio-9014-exec-6] 895x37x1 172.16.45.8 \"GET /rest/capabilities HTTP/1.1\" c.a.s.i.s.s.PluginAuthenticationProvider attempting authentication with authenticator com.atlassian.stash.stash-authentication:rememberMeAuthHandler\r\n...This repeats a few times...\r\n\r\n========== A TCP dump of stash communicating with crowd during the above transaction ==========\r\nGET /crowd/rest/usermanagement/1/config/cookie HTTP/1.1\r\nAccept: application/xml\r\nAuthorization: Basic XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\r\nUser-Agent: Jakarta Commons-HttpClient/3.1\r\nHost: localhost:8011\r\nCookie: $Version=0;
