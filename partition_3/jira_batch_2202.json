They have come to us, and asked if there was an ability to do a query on \"all\" postings, comments, edits, attachments (hence, any wiki changes), for a given user.  This is, a use case, our legal department often finds itself engaged in.  That being, the \"legal discovery on a given individual\" use case.  They also have \"legal discovery on a given set of keywords\" use case, which the product already does, out-of-the-box, with its search capabilities.  So, the suggestion here, is that soon, with legal discovery issues being so active in corporate america, there will be demands on products like Confluence, to do this.  What do you think, is this a \"hot\" enhancement?",

I don't think it is necessarily reasonable to assume that the views of 2% are truly representative of the majority - especially since there appears to be a far greater proportion of technical users than any other type of user logging/commenting on issues.\n\nThis is concerning to me considering Atlassian use these votes to determine the order in which issues/feature requests are addressed - e.g. *major product decisions are being made based on very little data*. A good analogy would be a movie studio - they wouldn't decide to make a sequel after reading a couple of critics' reviews, they poll millions of peoples' opinions by counting ticket sales. I definitely think effort needs to be made to increase the number of votes on Confluence issues.\n\n\nWhat I'm proposing is basically a means to:\n* Vastly increase visibility of (and by proxy, voters on) Confluence-related issues\n* Reduce the number of duplicate/similar issues being logged - e.g. Atlassian staff can spend less time managing the tracking system and more time working on the issues\n* Reduce barriers to browsing/watching/voting so that the views of a far greater variety of users are also represented\n* Make it easy for users to stay up-to-date with new issues\n* Make it easier for Atlassian staff to prioritise issues effectively, since the differences in votes between issues would probably be greatly exaggerated rather than 1-10 votes\n\nEssentially what I'd like to see is a sort of 'Dashboard' added to the Global Administration Console - preferably on the 99% empty _console.action_ page. This 'Dashboard' would basically be a hybrid between Confluence's main Dashboard & the Plugin Repository, and display things like:\n* The 10-20 most recently logged issues\n* The 10-20 most recently updated issues\n* Watched issues\n* Voted issues\n\nSimilar to the plugin repository, each item should have drill-down capabilities to see a cut-down version of the corresponding JIRA issues page (e.g. details/comments/status with simple actions such as vote/watch).\n\nTo prevent multiple people from a single site/instance voting on issues, a JIRA account could automatically be created based on the Server ID (or other uniquely identifying data) - e.g. each admin would share a common view.\n\nThis is just a starting point - I'd be keen/happy to be involved with the planning of this feature from a design/functionality perspective (don't ask me to code anything though :) ).\n",

Same thing that \"Watch\" does if the main portion of the page changes. if it's not possible do you think it can implemented in future builds of Confluence. I think it would be a great feature to have.\n\nThanks,\n\nChris ",

My intention is to nullify the additional need for per-space email-account creation. I want to be able to provide email archiving in Confluence with minimum administration. The inbound mail handling facility of Jira makes use of the to: field, this ability is what I was trying to request in Confluence. Configuring an email to: address in a Space is a lot less grief than creating a specific mail-drop for it.\n\nThis request is to basically add the ability to pull email from the given account with a given to: address, thinking about it, this would be a relatively small change (with a working example careof Jira) and no where near as great as the issue linked...\n{quote}",

I have created a space for our group and I have found no way to create a drop down list.\n\nCloaking is great, but the cloaked information underneath can be listed but cannot be arranged in any way.  It cannot be bolded, colored, highlighted, etc.  Neither can it be bulleted which would be a great improvement.\n\nAs for now, cloaking is the only way I have found to do drop down lists, but when adding informational links below, it begins to get jumbled together. \n\nI have also tried using decks with cards in order to try to make the page more manageable.  However, if this is to work, I need to have a running list of cards going across the screen.  This is easily done.  I am not able to make the tabs of the cards into links if I need to, is there a way to do this that I am just not seeing?\n\n\nok, to summarize. \n1) Is there a way to do a drop down list?\n2) Is there a way to somehow set apart the cloaked information once it is uncloaked?\n3) When using decks of cards, is there a way to take the tab of the card and make that tab a link (and yes I know, it would take away the card information at the bottom).\n\nThank you!",

For example:\n'article-for-review'\n'delete-me'\n'featured-article'\n'specification-document'\n'approved'\n'obsolete'\n\nWhile every effort is made to make things wide open, and deal with 'mistakes' through 'education' rather than control, in many cases the COST in time and resources to educate people on the proper use of high-impact labels outweighs the benefit.  While most labels can and should remain open, significant efficiencies and time savings can be achieved by limiting the use of certain labels to certain groups. For example:\n\nIf the 'delete-me' label above was linked to an automated review and deletion process, it could be limited to only be used by people in the 'moderators' group. Anyone could use a 'review-for-deletion' label, but not the specific 'delete-me' label.\n\nLikewise, if the 'approved' label was restricted to the people that have the approval authority for a given process or expenditure, then a separate approval process would not be needed outside of confluence: the approved label could be used with certainty.\n\nFurther, if labels like 'featured-article' was linked to articles that were shown on the top-level page of a large organization, and 'specification-document' label was used as a 'document class' with a special meaning that only a fraction of the organization really understood, and the use of these were limited to a group called \"Users-that-have-completed-confluence-training\" or \"users-in-the-specification-group\", then education on certain high-impact topics could be achieved proactively rather than retroactively.",

While I'm sure this sort of thing could be done with Crowd, many clients are using other SSO and LDAP systems which are difficult to cater for from within Confluence.\n\nThe plugin component would be used to create \"fake\" user groups within Confluence. To the rest of Confluence, they would appear like normal local groups, you could even add users to them (although it would be up to the plugin to decide what to do in this case).\n\nSome examples:\n\n1. Intersection Groups\n\nThe plugin config would allow an admin to define any number of intersection groups - each intersection group would list users that appear in two or more specific groups.\n\nFor example, let's say I have groups for job roles and countries. An intersection group could be made to collate all users who are both in Sweeden and are also Principle Engineers.\n\n2. Privilege Groups\n\nYou could create a group that would list all space administrators.\n\n3. Top Contributors Group\n\nA group to list 50 of the most prolific contributors in Confluence.\n\n4. Email Groups\n\nA group to collate all people with a specific domain in their email address. This is really useful in cases where Confluence is used as an extranet as it would make collating everyone from company X in to a group simply by their email address.\n\nIn terms of social networking, etc., the Dynamic User Group component would be extremely useful.\n\nEDIT: The dynamic groups would ideally have a flag to distinguish them from normal groups (in case any plugins or other functionality needs to know the difference).",

It seems useless to have such an ever-growing list, and when the list gets too long, displaying it on the info page is in nobody's interests.\n\nWhile confluence.atlassian.com no longer actually displays referral links, it still records them (at time of writing and not long after).  There is a page with over 40000 referral links recorded against it.  While this data *may* be interesting to analyse, there is no chance that displaying it all on the info page would be worthwhile, and even recording it (and exporting it) does not help the performance of the system.\n\nI suggest fixing this by adding a configurable limit to the number of trackbacks and referrals recorded against each page.  \nIt would be nice to also allow new links to replace old ones.  However I've noticed that the ratio of genuine trackbacks vs trackback spam deteriorates over time, so old, stale trackbacks are probably still better than fresh spam trackbacks.\n\n",

(It only provides general cautionary language).  There is also no easy way of finding out what if any pages the Group has been used to restrict access to.  Also, the Confluence Search feature does not include permission restrictions within its scope so it does not locate the pages.  \n\nThis is very serious since inadvertently removing a Group completely removes the access restriction function it was providing to any pages (and children pages) it was specified on - potentially opening up the page's and children pages' contents to the entire user community (if there are no other restrictions).\n\nThis request is to provide three features:\n1. When an administrator attempts to remove a Group, if the Group is being used to restrict any pages they would get a warning message along with a complete list of those restricted pages, (ordered by Space).  \n2. The Manage Groups page should include a button next to each Group so the Administrator can easily get the above list of pages that have that Group specified as a restriction without having to hit the Remove button (e.g. a button called something like \"Restrictions (?)\" or \"Test Usage (?)\" next to the current Remove button). \n3. The Confluence Search feature should include Groups specified within restrictions within its scope - so specifying a group as the search criteria locates the pages its has been specified on.\n\nThank you.",

Each page from teh selected confluence pages gets a bookmark tag, which gives us a nice \"Index\" or TOC on the left bar when one opens the document in PDF reader.\n\n*However*, the PDF export of a page feature fails to make use of this very cool and useful feature. Which forces us to use the TOC macro. However, that TOC is not as good because it does not \"float\" like the bookmarks do.\n\n*Suggestion*: make the page PDF export also bookmark the content. It can be done by automatically giving a bookmark to each Level 1 heading.\n*would be cool if one could control if this is done to Level 1, 2, 3.... ",
