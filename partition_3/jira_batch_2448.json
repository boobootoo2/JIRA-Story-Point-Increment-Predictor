      "description": "I&#x27;m very sorry to dig up an [old issue|BCLOUD-8300], but I would like to ask if, after 4 years, you might reconsider the earlier decision to not support OPTIONS requests.\n\nI believe I have a compelling use case for supporting OPTIONS:\n\nI am a Marketplace vendor, and one of my most popular apps is [Open API Documentation for Confluence|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/net.oharagroup.confluence.plugins.confluence-open-api/cloud/overview].\n\nThis is a Confluence macro that takes an Open API (a.k.a. Swagger) JSON/YAML definition, either directly in the macro body or from any URL; and renders API documentation.\n\n*Importantly*: All of this (fetching the URL, rendering the API documentation) occurs _in the client&#x27;s browser_. A key advantage of this is that the customer&#x27;s JSON/YAML never passes through my add-on servers; and I, as the app vendor, never sees the customers data.  Customers don&#x27;t need to be concerned with privacy/security risks of using a 3rd party for their API documentation solution, because their data never leaves their Confluence instance.\n\nCommonly, customers ask if they can store their JSON/YAML definitions in their source code repository of choice (typically GitHub or Bitbucket); rather than hosting the files elsewhere on the web.\n\nFor public repositories, this is no problem. Customers can simply specify the \"raw\" file URL in the macro, e.g. https://bitbucket.org/:project/:repo/raw/:commit/:file , and everything works as expected.\n\nFor private repositories, however; the only way (that I&#x27;m aware of) to fetch files is via the REST API.\n\nA cross-origin {{GET}} request normally wouldn&#x27;t trigger CORS, however because requests to the Bitbucket REST API require basic authentication, the presence of the {{Authorization}} header means that browsers must first issue a preflight OPTIONS request as part of the CORS process (to check the {{Access-Control-Allow-*}} response headers).\n\nWithout support for OPTIONS in the REST API, browsers are unable to make an authenticated request to fetch files from a private Bitbucket repository.\n\nAs a workaround, some of my customers have taken to using a proxy between their user&#x27;s browsers and BitBucket, that intercepts the OPTIONS request and injects the necessary CORS headers; but this is not practical for most people.\n\n(Please note: [a similar issue|https://ecosystem.atlassian.net/browse/AMKT-19489] exists with the Marketplace transactions API; and in that case the request to add support for OPTIONS is being considered)\n\nAlternatively, if there is another recommended way for browsers to make credentialled requests to Bitbucket for file content without triggering CORS, I would love to hear it.\n\nI&#x27;m aware that, historically, OPTIONS has been considered &#x27;insecure&#x27;; but often this was only on the grounds that without a specific use case, it is preferable to reduce the attack surface by disabling support.  In 2017, REST APIs and CORS presents a valid case for enabling OPTIONS support, and I&#x27;m confident that your security/infrastructure teams would be capable of enabling this without jeopardising overall security of the service.\n\nI very much hope you will reconsider your stance on this.",

Primarily because if the file doesn&#x27;t change then the hash will be the same, therefore we know there is no need to update the cache as well is if we should retrieve the cache.\n\nFor example:\\\\\nSay I have a package.json that contains a list of js dependencies for my project. At the beginning of the pipeline there is a check that hashes the contents of my package.json and if it matches any of my caches then it will pull it down. Otherwise cache won&#x27;t be pulled down and on completion of a pipeline a new cache will be created.\n\nAs a result we ensure we always have the proper dependencies and potentially speed up the pipeline as well.\n\nTo solve the problem of potential lingering cache we can delete cache that was using this method after a given period of time like a week or two.",

I don&#x27;t want users to be able to see source code, but I do want them to be able to file their own issues about the project, hence the separate repos.\n\nIt would be nice to be able to close an issue by committing something like {{Fixes teamname/issuerepo#issue}} to the source repo. Currently, the commit message just contains a link to that repo, but the issue itself is not linked.\n\nAnother solution would be to have a way to designate an \"issues repo\" for any particular source repo, so committing {{Fixes BCLOUD-10}} would close Issue 10 on the \"issues\" repo (this, of course, would require that the source repo not have issue tracking enabled on itself).\n\nThis would also allow multiple source repos to share the same issue tracker.\n\nEDIT: I see now that \"Public Issue Tracker\" is an option for a private repository (this wasn&#x27;t available when I first created the repo a while ago), but this proposal could still allow cross-repo issue closing (which GitHub already supports) as well as a shared issue tracker for multiple source repos.",

Combined there are 25 votes and watches including myself. This seems like a simple feature to implement and would be incredibly helpful. I am opening up this new one in hope that Atlassian will finally implement the feature that would help myself as well as many others considerably on a daily basis.\n\nOne of my responsibilities is to review all pull requests which range from 3 to 15 per day. While in the Pull Request Overview page I would like the ability to copy the branch name similar to that in the repository browse view. This would make it much easier to copy the name so that checking out the branch locally to test can be done more quickly and without errors.\n\nPresently my methodology is to select the text on the page but more often than not the branch name is ellipses or extraneous text is included and when pasted in shell, caused errors.\n\nAttached is a mockup of the feature.\n\nRelated tickets:\n\n* Ticket [8271|BCLOUD-8271] 4 votes & 9 watchers\n* Ticket [9574](Link URL) 5 watchers\n* Ticket [11280](Link URL) 2 votes & 4 watchers",

Suggested Solution\nInclude in this page (or possibly in a message shown when the user attempts to make the project private) a list the public repos or the repos containing a public issue tracker/wiki.\n\nh3. Why this is important\nFor projects containing a large number of repos, it can be time consuming to check all repo/issue tracker/wiki settings one by one. Showing a list will allow the admin to immediately fix (make private) the ones needed.",
