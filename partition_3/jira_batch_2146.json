Within a week of us rolling out Confluence at my company, people have started asking for it.  \n\nI am aware of the CONF-1210, CONF-7045, and CONF-6947 marked \"Will not fix,\" but this is a simple feature found in competing products which users find useful and I wanted to open it again and get votes behind it.\n\nThe {link-to} macro doesn't do this for external links so it doesn't satisfy this requirement.",

Some of our add-ons need to mark up the Attachments file lists with new columns, and we would love to have a standardized way to do this.\n\nOne possible implementation that would work for us would be along the following lines:\n\nCreate a new <web-item>, containing:\n- an i18n column title to be inserted in the <th>\n- a style class to be applied to the <th> and <td>\n- a weight to position the column amongst other add-on links. For us, it would be sufficient to insert the plugin-supplied links all at the right hand side, immediately before any attachment actions...but if you wanted to go all-out and make all of the system attachment columns into their own web-items and permit a completely arbitrary rendering order, that would also work.\n- a Velocity context containing just a reference to the attachment itself (and/or attachment version)\n\nWith the current implementation of the attachments macro and Tools->Attachments page, we would presumably need three different web-item sections:\n\n1- the Tools->Attachments page,\n2- the top-level Attachments Macro list (which contains just the file name and modified date), and\n3- the Attachments Macro version list (containing the version name, creator and date)",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFSERVER-31402].\n  {panel}\n\nHello and first of all thanks for a great product!\n\nWe try to use Confluence for all our documentation and process needs, but there is a couple of things that causes quite a lot of frustration for us.\n\nWhy is formatting a page to look tidy and informative so hard? I feel very restricted and the formatting (if it exists) is in my opinion overly complicated.\n\nSay I want to add some text to go with my picture or table, text that actually follows the picture AND is visible in a .pdf export. This should be possible in my opinion.\n\nSay I want to change my font size or decide what font size I want for my different headings, shouldn't this be possible?\n\nSay I want to change some table properties like width and height etc. etc. , why is this impossible?\n\nFor numbered bulletpoints, why isn't there an option to continue my previous numbered bulletpoints (say before an inserted picture) instead of starting over from 1. ?\n\nI am like most users used to MS Word or similar, is it possible to look in that direction and make the text formatting a little more flexible? (I might be committing the ultimate sin here I know..).\n\nThanks for any feedback!\n\nTom Erik\nSensor Developments AS",

Every time we make a change or add a space, we need to go and manually update each space with the new link. We're only going to be adding spaces, which means an exponential growth in this process.\n\nSuggestions:\n1) Create a section somewhere in the Administration panel which allows admins to map a single sidebar to multiple spaces.\n\n2) Allow admins to define a list of shortcuts for ALL spaces, which aren't editable by space admins.\n\nIf there's another ticket for this, please link and close; I looked but I couldn't find anything.",

Out-of-the-box use of Meeting Notes will produce a page tree that looks like this:\n* Meeting Notes\n** 2013-10-25 Meeting Notes\n** 2013-10-26 Meeting Notes\n** 2013-10-27 Meeting Notes\n\nIt's pretty clear imho that it's much more desirable to keep the latest meeting notes on top, as in:\n* Meeting Notes\n** 2013-10-27 Meeting Notes\n** 2013-10-26 Meeting Notes\n** 2013-10-25 Meeting Notes\n\nBut there is not a nice mechanism for making this happen without resorting to manual re-ordering. Imposing a simple reverse-alphabetical sort on the Meeting Notes child pages would do it (assuming an appropriate naming convention were used - like the one that the out-of-the-box Meeting Notes blueprint suggests).",

      "description": "{panel:bgColor=#e7f4fa}\n  *NOTE:* This bug report is for *Confluence Cloud*. Using *Confluence Server*? [See the corresponding bug report|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFSERVER-31307].\n  {panel}\n\nWhen a Confluence page has an Info, Note, Warning or Tip macro in its content, the Word export of that page only includes the text contained in the macro (with the title if available). The macro's icon itself is replaced with the word \"Icon\".\n\nIn previous versions of Confluence (3.5.16, 4.3.3), the macros exported fine : icon on the left, text on the right, border and background color as expected.\nI wonder if this might come from the fact that the macros used to be displayed using an HTML Table tag, and now use a Div tag with CSS the place the icon.\n\nThis makes printing the documentation a pain, since the editor has to hunt for all the \"Icon\" mentions and rebuild the macros' Table tag and color.\nAs an aside, this makes copy-pasting the content of a Confluence page in an HTML (or WYSIWYG) page a pain, since all the macro HTML tables are lost there too, replaced with \"Icon\" and plain text.\n\nSee attached files:\n* CaptureMacroTestConfluence.PNG: the macros as seen in Confluence 5.1.5.\n* CaptureMacroTestWord.PNG: the macros as seen in Word 2010.\n\nCould this be related to CONF-28579 (\"Cell background colors do not print out\") and CONF-23583 (\"The table's border become invisible in the output of the \"Export to word\"\")?\n\nNote that this bug also happens with the Pagetree Word Exporter plugin (https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.metainf.confluence.plugin.pagetreeexporter.pagetree-word-exporter-plugin).\n\nh3. *Possible workaround solution for PDF export:*\nPlease add the following css code in the Global PDF Stylesheet:\n{code}\nbody p\n{\n  font-size: 150%;\n}\n\n.confluence-information-macro-note  \n{\n    background-image: url(../../../images/icons/macrobrowser/dropdown/note.png);\n    background-repeat: no-repeat;\n    background-size:auto;\n    background-position: 10px 10px;\n}\n\n.confluence-information-macro-information  \n{\n    background-image: url(../../../images/icons/macrobrowser/dropdown/info.png);\n    background-repeat: no-repeat;\n    background-size:auto;\n    background-position: 10px 10px;\n}\n\n.confluence-information-macro-warning  \n{\n    background-image: url(../../../images/icons/macrobrowser/dropdown/warning.png);\n    background-repeat: no-repeat;\n    background-size:auto;\n    background-position: 10px 10px;\n}\n{code}",

And therefore Confluence returns the default XML document, witch can't be read by javascript when you do cross origin requests.\n\nh4. How to reproduce the problem:\n# open the attached [^confluenceRestFail.html] file\n# open the javascript console on you web browser\n# see the error message because it can't interpret the \"<\" in the beginning of the XML document it gets back.\n\nh4. Suggested fix:\nConfluence could use the jsonp-callback= GET parameter to set the return type to JSON instead of XML. Because the jsonp-callback= parameter is pretty useless for a xml request...\n\nh4. Why you can't  set the Accept header in javascript when using JSONP\nYou can't set the access header because when you use JSONP the tool of you choice creates a <script> element and sets the \"src\" attribute to the URL you want. And you can't set a Accept: \"application/json\" on a <script> element. Therefore your Accept headers looks like this: Accept: \\*/\\* and that in turn results in confluence returning XML.",
