The sandbox feature is now available to\u00a0all Premium and Enterprise customers. This means that you will now have the ability to:\r\n # Create (an empty) sandbox and\r\n # Delete a sandbox.\r\n\r\nFor more information about cloud sandboxes, please refer to our [official documentation|https://confluence.atlassian.com/cloud/manage-sandboxes-1019402392.html].\r\n\r\nWe expect that providing fully capable sandbox environments will be a multi-step journey. Please refer to the sub-tasks for the features we're working on and/or considering. We will continue to share updates on this ticket as soon as features are available. Don't hesitate to contact me directly if you have questions at [mtse@atlassian.com|mailto:mtse@atlassian.com].\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n Matt Tse\r\n Senior Product Manager, Atlassian\r\n{panel}\r\nh2. What is a sandbox?\r\n\r\nA sandbox is an isolated environment where admins & developers safely test applications and extensions and preview new features without impacting the production environment.\r\n\r\nFor more about sandboxes, please check out our [official documentation|https://confluence.atlassian.com/cloud/manage-sandboxes-1019402392.html].",

Sometimes this may be cleaning up old emails, and I have no recollection of that task. I need to click the link in the comment notification (or any other notification for that sake) to see that the task is closed, and I can close this browser tab and delete the email. \r\n \r\nWouldn't it be nice if we can somehow see the \"current\" status of the task? Here is one way of how Atlassian can do this;\r\nWithin each notification email, such as \"John Smith commented on TST-1234\" there should be a small image file with a link to company.jira.com/images/TST-1234.png. \r\nThis image is set to some text (maybe with some colored background). the text of this image contains the current status such as \"Open\". When I open the email, the image gets pulled down from the server, and you see the status as Open.\r\n \r\nWhen the status on task TST-1234 gets transitioned to say, Closed, the png for /images/TST-1234.png is also being replaced with a different image from the pool that says closed.\r\n\r\nWhen I open the email, the image gets pulled again, and I see that the status is closed. \r\n \r\n \r\nFrom what I can see, you might be running into a permissions issue, because if you don't want people to see the status, that means they have to be signed in to Jira using their primary browser or they will not be able to pull that image, assuming it inherits the permission from its parent. For that, instead of returning a 403, you can produce a different image that says \"not signed in\" or something to that effect.\r\n\r\nAs an alternative, you might implement some hash, so instead of pointing the image to /images/TST-1234.png you pull it from /images/some-long-hash.png",

Which products is data residency available for?\r\n\r\nData residency is offered for Jira Software, Jira Service Management, and Confluence at this time.\r\nh4. When will data residency be available?\r\n\r\nData residency is currently available for customers on the [Enterprise plan|https://www.atlassian.com/enterprise/cloud/cloud-enterprise]. We\u2019re working hard to make data residency available in\u00a0our Standard and [Premium|https://www.atlassian.com/software/premium] cloud plans\u00a0by the second half of 2021. To stay up to date on availability, please sign up for updates at the bottom of this page\u00a0or view our [cloud roadmap|https://www.atlassian.com/roadmap/cloud?category=dataManagement&].\u00a0\r\nh4. Which locations can I store my data in?\r\n\r\nYou can\u00a0choose to pin your data to our US or EU [data realms|https://confluence.atlassian.com/cloud/manage-data-residency-976763149.html]. To stay up to date on additional geographies\u00a0we are working on, please see our [cloud roadmap|https://www.atlassian.com/roadmap/cloud?category=dataManagement&].\u00a0\r\nh4. Will enabling data residency make my Jira or Confluence performance faster?\r\n\r\nNo,\u00a0Atlassian uses our global infrastructure presence to host data as close to customers as possible in order to achieve maximum performance. While data residency provides an additional level of certainty that data will not be stored outside a specific geographic area, our architecture is designed to provide global customers the best possible experience. Enabling data residency may lead to\u00a0more latency for users outside the designated geographic area. [Learn more about our global cloud infrastructure|https://www.atlassian.com/trust/reliability/infrastructure].\u00a0\r\n{panel}\r\nThere are customers who require data residency, but that\u00a0are not in the Enterprise segment. Either because they are on low user tiers (25-250, typically), and/or because they do not require/are willing to pay for Enterprise prices.\u00a0\r\n\r\nI know that lower user tiers for Enterprise is something that Atlassian considers (CLOUD-11064), however the data residency feature is sorely needed also for Premium (or Basic) plan subscriptions.",
