If I run {{git diff}} on the command line I get information as far as a file being renamed and similarity score. Bitbucket APIs return two separate diffs, an add and a delete, even if the contents are unchanged. In addition, this functionality seems to already be available for the actual bitbucket UI (eg: https://blog.bitbucket.org/2016/04/14/updated-diff-view-for-moved-or-renamed-files/), but not to the API. This makes it difficult for an integrating application to get an idea of the diff that an end-user is seeing without doing all of the diffing logic themselves.",

The file in question, unfortunately, is sort of long.\n\nSo I was thinking: wouldn&#x27;t it be nice if you could view the source, and if you held down the Ctrl key and moved the mouse zoom wheel, you went to earlier or later versions? (Presumably without the Ctrl key down should just scroll through the code as usual).\n\nI&#x27;m sure this is harder than it seems, as you&#x27;d have to somehow keep aligned where you are in the code. Still, I can imagine situations in which it, or something like it, might be useful.\n\nIn general, I&#x27;m pretty happy with the product. At the moment, I&#x27;m mostly using the CLI tools, but may end up using the website more.\n\nJosh",
