      "description": "I am a customer of JIRA OnDemand.  The screen Admin->System->System info says that this is OnDemand version 6.4-OD-04-006 (build 64001), which I assume is the latest version as of today's date (Sept. 5, 2014, 8:45am Pacific).\r\n\r\nI tried to bulk edit issues in my project, but ran into problems:\r\n\r\n- Ran a simple search query to get a list of issues  \r\n- Chose Tools -> Bulk Change (6 issues)\r\n- Selected checkboxes for the 2 issues I wanted to change, clicked Next\r\n- Chose Edit issues, clicked Next\r\n- Scrolled down the field edit form to find the \"Change Sprint\" field\r\n- The text box to the right of the Change sprint label contains an exception message (see first copy and paste below of exception text for details).  It seems kind of weird that the text box itself, meant for inputting a sprint, contains text.\r\n- If I delete the exception text and type in the name of my sprint (simply \"sprint 1\"), the typeahead doesn't work. \r\n- If I check the field sprint checkbox and enter the name of the sprint text anyway and click Next, I get a similar exception on the returned page (see second copy and paste below of exception text for details).\r\n\r\nI am able to easily reproduce this problem in 2 of my projects.  Note sure if this info matters, but:\r\n\r\n- The issues I'm trying to change have multiple sprints listed in their sprint field (they were rolled over from 1 sprint to another, so both were recorded).  \r\n- The issues I'm trying to change are of type \"Story\"\r\n\r\nIf you have questions, please feel free to reach out to me.\r\n\r\n-Curt\r\n\r\n\r\n---- Exception text inside text box ----\r\n\r\n{noformat}An error occurred whilst rendering this message.

The biggest problem with this is maintaining a lot of \"extraneous\" issues, when really only one (for the user story) is needed.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if instead of sub-tasks, an issue could have a checklist-type field that could used as an estimation statistic for sprint progress tracking (perhaps assign hours to each checklist task).

Select the top issue, then type \". se\" to send that top issue to the top again\r\n\r\n4, Run the SQL query from step 2 again and notice that the lexorank of the re-ranked issue grows each time step 3 is executed\r\n\r\nIf you do this about 40 or 50 times you can see that a lexorank rebalance job is scheduled. The SQL query for that is\r\n\r\n{noformat}\r\nselect * from AO_60DB71_LEXORANKBALANCER;\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nwhere the time is in ms since 1970.\r\n\r\n*Observed*\r\n\r\nLexorank length grows rapidly to the length that triggers a lexorank balance job.

Cause:\r\n\r\nA status label was renamed. In my example, from *To Do* to *TO DO*. When you try to access the board, it sees that *To Do* does not exist, so it attempts to create it again, since it requires it. But unfortunately, since *TO DO* is essentially the same, it fails. This is a problem with case sensitivity. *Note:* I think this only happens if you edit a status that is already there by default to use a different case.\r\n\r\nh4. To Replicate\r\n\r\n# Go to {{secure/admin/ViewStatuses.jspa}} View Statuses, edit a default status to be in all caps for the name (e.g. To Do > TO DO)\r\n# *Create Project > Agile Software Development - Scrum*.
