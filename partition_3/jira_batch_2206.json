For example: \n* RemoveSpace for a space with many pages can take several minutes, and all other users are locked from the wiki until it completes \n* Reading or writing pages too rapidly through the API can impact the responsiveness of the wiki for other users \n\nWe need to use the API for creation of new user accounts from a script that may run any time of day or night. But we don't want to open the API to all users. \n\nCan we quickly have a feature to limit API use to members of the group Confluence-API-Users \n\nFor backwards compatibility, there should be an administration option to \n* Allow all users to use API \n* Only Confluence-administrators to use API \n* Only confluence-api-users to use API \n\n{panel:title=Resolution as of 18 February 2016|borderStyle=solid|borderColor=#3C78B5| titleBGColor=#3C78B5| bgColor=#E7F4FA}\nThank you for your votes and comments on this issue, along with your ongoing patience. In order to bring closure on this request we have decided to resolve it as Won't Fix. This decision has been made for a number of reasons. Aside from competing priorities, the other reason is that the API is actually the same API end users use when they interact with the product. Rate/user/group limiting that would require a substantial re-architecture of the whole API and user interaction.\n\nI would recommend reviewing the following articles which provides information on how to detect users that may be contributing to API abuse:\n[Enable User Access Logging|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/CONFKB/How+to+Enable+User+Access+Logging]\n[Audit Confluence Using the Tomcat Valve Component|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/CONFKB/Audit+Confluence+Using+the+Tomcat+Valve+Component]\n\nA proxy server can also be used to restrict API calls to particular IP addresses. For Data Center, customers have reported success in directing all API traffic to a single node, such that any performance or stability impacts are limited to a single node. Depending on the API you are using, requests should go to the following URLs:\n<CONFLUENCE_URL>/rpc/xmlrpc\n<CONFLUENCE_URL>/rpc/soap-axis\n<CONFLUENCE_URL>/confluence/rest\n\nRegards,\n  Adam Barnes\n  Confluence Product Management\n{panel}",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFSERVER-7841].\n  {panel}\n\nMany pages in my repository contain includes, excerpts, metadata, rss feeds, jira reports, remote-html includes, sql queries, charts, generated confluence content (children, pagetree, contentbylabels, search macro).  In fact, this is a power of confluence, to 'safely' assemble these varied data sources. Confluence is an excellent central point for the collecting, or confluence, of a variety of data sources required to make decisions. Kudos.\n\nHowever, the concept of notification for end users is clear: IF THIS PAGE THAT I AM VIEWING CHANGES, let me know. I don't want to miss anything.   Often the 'view' changes without the 'source' changing.\n\nFrom a content provider, or page 'steward', the use case is different. IF THIS PAGES SOURCE CHANGES, let me know.    This is important because a page developer might not need to do or check anything unless the source changes, they may not care about the view.  This is what you currently implement well.\n\n** You need both levels of watching for each page for these two communities of users. ***\n\nThe 'page view notification' would also help enourmously for 'unit testing' and assessing the impact of upgrading a macro on a large site where you can't review all the content.\n\nIN ADDITION: the 'view changes' button shows a 'diff' of the source, something that is obscure to many content readers, especailly for complex pages. Changes sometimes are not obvious (i.e. a small addition, {jiraissues} is added, but a huge section of the page appears or disappears).  End users would prefer to see highlighted what has visibly changed on a page.\n\nTHESE ARE NOT EASY CHALLENGES when you consider you need to have a stored view for each user, and different users will see different views on any given page, but if you can overcome them you will further differentiate your application in this very competitive application niche.  Even a partial solution that worked for most cases would be powerful.\n\n- space watch overcomes this somewhat for small spaces and internal data like pagetree or children, however:\n- this is more important that entire-space watches that are quickly unweildly, as a user wants to watch digested information suitable to their level of abstraction, not the entire repository.  So watching a TOP PAGE is more common, under the assumption that important changes will trickle up. (indeed that is how we build our sites, using includes and excerpts to trickle high-impact information upward or laterally).  The problem is the trickle is often automatic in the form of adding a label or moving a page to another branchin the heirarchy, rather than an actual change on the top page.\n",

Despite their quick nature, user macros are the 'glue' that sticks together many sites, quick-fixing plugin blunders, create shorthand recipies combining macros from multiple plugins and placing notices and replacing obsolete or missing macros. (we have over 200 of these, some very complex).\n- Authoring and maintaining user macros are collaborative. On even moderate sized installations there can be several system administrators that have access to the user macros. They are sometime authored by one person, broken during an upgrade (which needs to be noted), repaired by another, and new 'syntax' added by yet another person.\n- Unlike regular wiki pages, they are currently unversioned. This obviously means we can't revert mistakes, see who contributed what elements, or see their comments as to why they made that change\n- Unlike regular wiki pages, they can't have threaded comments. This is helpful for discussing transitions, strategy, dependencies, or details around a specific user macro. It would be good to have one set, shared between admins, and another set associated with the documentation described below.\n- Unlike regular wiki pages, they can't be 'watched'. This would help notify admins when certain macros are being updated, or notify interested users when the macro (or macro documentation below) was updated.\n- Unlike regular wiki pages, they can't be restricted to certain individuals. Not all site admins are equal. It would be good to restrict some of the higher profile user macros to specific users (not because of the access to the API, all admins are trusted with that, but because some user macros are used extensively and should not be updated arbitrarily)\n- Unlike regular wiki pages, they are not visible to the regular users. It's not the code or the comments that need to be visible, however, it's a 'documentation blurb' that includes parameters, usage examples and description of functionality.  These sections should also be version controlled, attributable, watchable and restrictable. In this case, however, we would like to extend the ability to edit these three blurbs, in wiki or rich text syntax, to regular users.\n- Unlike regular wiki pages, they cannot be linked to. It would be helpful, for example, to say \"Please see user macro \\[xxx\\]\" or \"user macro [usermacro:xxxx]\" and have that link to the help documentation for the named user macro.\n- Unlike regular wiki pages, there are no 'incoming-links'. It would be very helpful when refactoring user macros (due to a Confluence version upgrade, a plugin upgrade, or chance in functionality), to have some idea what the impact of that user macro was on our installation. To know how many, and which, pages use the macro would be great.\n- Unlike regular wiki pages, they cannot be labeled. This would be extremely useful for categorizing our 200 user macros into groups, which helps with documenting and with the learning curve for new users and admins. (labels might include which versions they've been tested on, are they content or formatting, are they obsolete, temporary, core to our installation, related to a specific plugin, etc)\n- Unlike regular wiki pages, they cannot be easily transfered between installations. It would be great to share them by letting regular users see the code (if desired). If that user is then an admin on their own install, the can quickly duplicate the functionality, improve the macro, and deliver it back to us tested.\n\n*Suggestion*\n- use some of the lessons learned from the regular wiki page user interface to enhance the editing and documenting of user macros\n\n(appologize to Charles below for me not being specific enough in my first request)",

Search works a lot like the Confluence search, but Go looks for a single page with an exact title match (aided a lot by user creation of redirect pages) and takes the user to that page if it exists.  This is the biggest frustration our users have.  Salespeople and others looking for glossary-type pages want to type, say, \"Postgres\" and have a definitive Postgres page returned that defines the term.  I asked about this on the forums a while back, so here's a possible (very) high-level spec that I think  would work:\n\n* Add a Go button to the main search box in front of the Search button, and give the Go button the focus so it's used by default.\n* When the user clicks \"Go\" instead of Search, the search is assumed to be a title search and a request for an exact phrase match, and to be a Pages search only.\n* If there is a single result, the system immediately redirects the user to the page that matched the search.\n* If there are multiple pages with the same title and one of them is in the same space the user searched from, the system redirects the user to that page.\n* If there are multiple pages with the same title and none are is the space the user search from, or if the user searched from the dashboard, show the regular search results page.\n* If there are no exact titles matches, execute a regular search and show the result.  Ideally this also would default to searching the current space, which I believe is another request.\n\nPeople would go nuts over this - guaranteed!  Please add it ... \n\n",

While it is working, all users are locked out of confluence. On a web with 600 pages, (and perhaps 5000 total page revisions in the histories), doing a remove makes the rest of the wiki unavailable for 10-20 minutes. We are doing a series of conversion projects of moving webs from other wikis to confluence, and as we improve the converter, we need to be able to remove previous versions of webs from confluence before we rerun the converter on those webs.\n\nConfluence needs to minimize the amount of time the system is locked down, and do most of the remove on a background thread. It would be ok if a new space could not be created with the same space key until the remove is complete. A status screen would show the progress, and an API call to tell if the system is busy removing spaces, and which spaces it is removing.\n",

Some pages (like main pages or portal pages) on a site don't need comments. It isn't appropriate. Not only can you not disable commenting on a page (like through a simple checkbox on the edit page), but even if you disable editing of a page entirely, that still won't prevent commenting.\n\nPlease improve this situation. Best of all would be a simple checkbox: [ ] Users can comment on this page. I would also be ok with tying it to page permissions.\n\n{panel:title=Atlassian Status as of 1st November,  2011|borderStyle=solid|borderColor=#3C78B5| titleBGColor=#3C78B5| bgColor=#E7F4FA}\nHi Everyone,\nThanks for all your feedback on this issue. After much discussion we've concluded we won't be implementing this feature request. Our goal is to continue to simplify the product, by focusing on building for the majority of our customers. Whilst the ability to disable comments on a specific page or blog is a completely valid feature request, we believe it just crosses the line in terms of adding an extra level of complexity to the product and is a use case that isn't catering for the majority of our customers.  \n\nIn saying this, there are several ways in which this can still be achieved. For example, David Simpson [has written up a blog post of how this can be done with a simple user macro on a page|http://davidsimpson.me/2011/01/23/more-flexible-commenting-in-atlassians-confluence/]. Alternatively you could write a plugin to hide the comments block on a page. We welcome the plugin developer community to tackle this problem as it won't be something we will make core to the product.  \n\nThanks for your patience with this issue. \n\nCheers,\nSherif Mansour\nConfluence Product Manager\nsmansour at atlassian dot com\n\n{panel}",

However if I wish to find and refactor pages according to specific criteria (for example using a keyword filter), I could generate an RSS feed or a list of pages from the search engine but cannot extract or move this list of pages together to another space.  (or correct me if there is some way unknown to me of doing so)\n\nSuch ability to refactor based on filters would enable information modelling and architecture. Existing engines such as the hyperapplet-plugin or Touchgraph could then be used to develop 3D and 4D navigation models from within Confluence (without going through the RPC interface).\n\nGoing further, the ability to dynamically mirror (virtual refactoring) the pages into specific filters would allow to build and embed various space navigation models into the wiki to best suit each users desired perspective (without duplicating/changing the actual pages).\n\nI understand this may be going too much ahead for many users but our wiki has become so crowded with pages that the traditional navigation schemes are becoming inefficient. The search engine remains a good alternative but fails to show the inter-relations and global view of all available wiki pages. Therefore a solution is needed to FILTER/VIEW/NAVIGATE the wiki in a non-linear way.",

This is particularly annoying for non-wysiwyg people but is still a big issue for everyone.\n\nI'd like a feature where you right-click on the page and select \"Edit\" and then it edits the page but puts the cursor right where you had right-clicked.\n\nLimitations in browsers probably make this difficult, I'm sure. But it would be very useful feature to have. Would save so much time, make the system so much more usable!\n\nNot that this was the best solution, but on a previous wiki (OpenWiki) we added a little hack that helped. You would select some text, then do a key sequence to edit the page like Shift-Ctrl-E, and it would do a search on the text you had selected, then leave the cursor at the beginning of that in the edit mode. As long as the text you selected was unique (99% of the time this was the case if you selected more than a few words) it would put the cursor in the right spot. This was a crappy solution but it was definitely better than scroll scroll look scroll scroll ARGH look scroll...\n\nI'm sure someone who knows more than me about Javascript and DOM's can figure this out.

Outline macros can be defined within Outline macros.\n- Should be able to wrap headings as well as lists.\n- Both Headings and lists items should be expandable.\n- (Phase2+) Allow for WYSIWYG Outline Editing :-)\n\nNotes:\n- This feature should follow the \"One Pane\" view such as that in Omni Outliner (OSX), and Ecco Pro (Win).  See http://john.redmood.com/organizers.html for information on Outline types.\n- The main difficulty of WYSIWYG Outlining with a web browser is capturing of Tab and Shift-Tab for indent control from keyboard which is very important feature.

This is rather awkward as the general way of working in confluence is through actions, and having to drop down to the servlet API makes the plugin more complex than it needs to be.\n\nWhile the servlet work around functions fine, I would prefer to have the simpler option of just implementing a InputStreamFeed (or better named) interface which has a \"InputStream getInputStream() throws IOException\" contract. The InputStreamResult picks up on that (like the RssFeed - see CONF-7547) and then writes the data straight out.\n\nThe content type and disposition can be set by the action. This could also be achieved by a NullResult which does nothing and having the action grab the response and write to it directly, although thats not really the xwork way of doing things - the outputting should be done by the results.",

This result type is handled by a confluence class called RssResult which looks up the SyndFeed like this:\n\nSyndFeed feed = (SyndFeed) actionInvocation.getStack().findValue(\"syndFeed\");\n\n\nIf there was a RssFeed interface which has a \"SyndFeed getSyndFeed()\" contract,  then the code could look like this:\n\nSyndFeed feed = null;\nAction action = actionInvocation.getAction();\nif (action instanceof RssFeed) {\n    feed = ((RssFeed) action).getSyndFeed();\n}\n\nThe main benefit is that the stack doesn't absorb any exceptions - which are filtered out by the \"findValue(String)\" method on the Stack, as although they are logged they don't make it out to the browser like typical action plugin exceptions. For an example of what Id prefer to see, throw a RuntimeException from the execute() method of an action.\n\nAnother benefit is a clearer contract - I had to hack open the RssResult in order to reverse engineer what I needed to do. The fact that I had to implement a getSyndFeed method was not clear from looking at the confluence RSS generators as a template - I would have picked up on a well named interface much quicker.\n\nIf you make the interface match the current requirements, finding the usages and refactoring should be trivial.",

At present, the macro prints thin horizontal lines between each page containing a target label on the results list. When using the macro only to display page titles, this reduces readability on long lists.  Because the visual style does not match the style link lists created manually or using the children macro, it also looks bad when used in the same page as with other link title lists. If a user specifies lines=false, no lines are printed.\n\n2) Enable maxResults=-1 to disable a limit on the number of results\n\n3) Add a new titlebylabel macro which is the contentbylabel macro with the following defaults:\n\nmaxResults=-1\nshowLabels=false\nshowSpace=false\ntype=page\nlines=false\n",
