Current State\nCurrently there are on the upper right corner of page set of controls (see attached image) that clearly and visibly lets user know that it is possible to perform following functions:\n* Edit\n* Watch \n* Share\n* Tools _(this one has visual indicator that lets me know, that i may fold open some kind of menu)_\n\n*Note that there is no visual indicator, that pressing _Watch_ opens something as well!*\n\nh4. Better Solution\nIn order to address this problem you may improve UX in several ways:\n* Add little indicator next to watch button, that hints about possibility to fold open some kind of menu.\n* Change watch icon to be enabled/disabled for pages that are either watched or not. For example this \"eye\" could turn red inside when page is being watched (kind of like the eye of Sauron from the LOTR)\n* Change label from _Watch_ to _Stop watching_ or _Manage watches_\n* Make a little check mark in the \"eye\" to indicate that user is watching the page and to encourage user to click there, in case he/she wants to stop watching that page\n* Have your UX engineer come up with even better solution\n\n_Disclaimer_ This is not support issue, as I already figured out, that:\n*In order to _stop watching_ I have to click _watch_* -- fortunately MS taught us, that in order to turn off computer you have to click _start_ ;)",

There standard values will be displayed. Always: \n* Maximum issues: 20\n* Columns to display: Key, Summary, Issue Type, Created, Updated, Due Date, Assignee, Reporter, Priority, Status, Resolution\n\n\nWanted behaviour:\n* In the blueprint or template a user can choose how many issues will be returned by default and what columns should be displayed. \n** Example: Maximum issues: 100\n** Columns to display: Key, Summary, Status, Resolution\n\n\nMy use case:\nI create a product requirement where a requirement has 2 EPICs. As soon as I insert two Epics - I do not want to use 2 jira issue macros - I get a table with predefined columns. However, I only really need these Columns displayed: Key, Summary, Status, Resolution. Because in the requirements document I really don't need more information...",

No really, I like the concept of confluence, I like the way it is connected to JIRA and step for step every bit of our documentation is moving to confluence. \n\nBUT!\n\nWriting an article, especially a technically one with a lot of code snippets, sucks! How can I write several lines of monospaces code?\n\nLook here: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2721576/demo.mov\n\nOr even worse, just try to make a list and get the spaces right ... everytime!\n\nThe best thing you've done recently to improve the editing experience in confluence is the new _Page Layouts_ feature. I think the reason why it's so awesome, is that you can always predict what's going on, because it is clearly visible.\n\nIt's like the editor im using right now here in JIRA: If I wanna write {{some monospace}} I just put some of these brackets {} here and they are clearly visible until I hit the blue (preview) button down there.\n\nThis is predictable behaviour and this is why writing {{markdown}} is getting so much attention right now: Predictability instead of Microsoft Word.\n\nSo please Atlassian, add the best {{markdown}} editor of all times to Confluence and make you product score in its core discipline! \n\n!https://raw.github.com/dcurtis/markdown-mark/master/png/208x128.png!\n\nThanks, Markus",

I would like to modify them by doing simple things like arrows, boxes, lines circles, etc. to enhance a particular piece of the pic.  This is great when editing documents that will be used as tutorials or guides.  Adding other things would be nice like being able to darken the image except for the circle or rectangle that you have selected to better enhance your point in the image, etc.  Again I really appreciate how easy it's to use confluence and how little time it takes to create great looking documents and such so this would be icing on the cake.",

I eventually restarted and downloaded the completed git, and discovered that the code you had written was for 5.1.4, although there are indications that the tutorial was updated for 5.3, and if you start the plugin as described in the \"Simple\" tutorial you will be using 5.4.  I believe (though I'm not sure, since the working code in the git uses 5.1) the problem is that the code tries to subclass a blueprint class that isn't there in 5.4, so it wouldn't work.  However, I can't be sure, since there's no version information in the tutorial.\n\nAs pretty much a Java newbie, I want to point out that Java is a language with very complex structures of files and dependencies, and in a case like this it is virtually impossible to figure out what the problem is.  You really need to indicate to your users which versions work with the code in the tutorial, so learners (and who else would be using a tutorial?) can have some hope of understanding whether they've made some mistake that needs to be tracked down, or there's a version problem.\n\nI noticed that the pom.xml file in the downloaded code specified the Confluence version, and Maven automatically downloaded that and built to it.  You could provide a step to modify the POM (to specify a Confluence version) so that the tutorial user can be sure she is using a version of the Confluence code that works with the code in the supplied tutorial.",

We (myself in particular) love the product; we'd like to be able to give those 25 people wiki logins so they can love it too but, there is no way our team can justify paying for 375 licenses we will never use. \n\nI'm sure each of your salespeople are fielding this request multiple times per day, if you won't implement this for us, your loyal customers, do it for them! Just think how discouraging it must be to have to tell their customers 'No!' and turn them away day after day, I've got a lump in my throat just thinking about it... \n\nIt would be best to be able to purchase licenses in 10-packs but, if that's too much trouble,100-packs would be at least reasonable and somewhat in line with our needs. :-) \nThanks!\nChris",

This is certainly an issue which has done its round on the internet over the years for many browser and application vendors alike, with each pointing the finger at each other as to whether the application or browser should observe the EXIF rotation metadata.\n\nThe obvious solution is for all browsers to support the 'image-orientation' CSS, however after many years this is still only supported by Firefox.\nWe have explored no less than 6 different solutions to this issue as each brings pros and cons in terms of performance, behaviour and complexity.\nAs a result of this exercise, it has been decided that image rotation would be done server side based on the EXIF rotation metadata.\n\nThe actual implementation is somewhat different for Server and Cloud deployments, and thus the rollout/delivery may occur at different times, however is high up in the queue right now.\n\nConfluence Product Management\n{panel}",

Our [current process|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/CONFKB/How+Do+I+Disable+Indexing+of+Attachments] to disable attachment index via disabling a number of extractors is an okay workaround, but does not disable indexing of ALL attachments. Text/HTML/XML files are still indexed and cannot be disabled via the UI. This presents problems since the Lucene upgrade in Confluence 5.2 introduces new bugs can hang the entire indexing process such as:\n* https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONF-32566\n* https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-5400\n\nHowever, even if the bugs (and other future Lucene bugs that may arise) are fixed, one may wish to forgo attachment indexing for the sake of improving Confluence performance.\n\nThis request is to add an option in the UI to simply disable all attachment contents.

This returned that there was no such table as 'confluence.bandana' \n\nThen we followed a commenter's suggestion to clear the plugin cache. We followed this article:\nhttps://confluence.atlassian.com/display/CONFKB/How+to+Clear+Confluence+Plugins+Cache\nJust two notes on this:\n- The article does not mention to backup directories before nuking.\n- The <confluence-home> was actually in /var/applicationdata instead of the assumed /opt/ directory.\n\nI hope this has been of help for your team.\n\nRegards,\nPat\n",

At other time in future, this page might be needed again. However, restoring the Space backup to retrieve the page might cause an error because the same space (Space Key) already exists in the instance.\n\nIt would be convenient for user if Confluence can prompt to rename Space/Space key before executing the Restore/import process.

This way I can centralise different tasklist for different areas of a project from one viewpoint......reducing the need to open/enter each on a regular basis to get the latest updates on tasklists.\n\n",
