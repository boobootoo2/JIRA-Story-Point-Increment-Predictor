This will help us to priorities further development.\r\n\r\nAnton Genkin\r\n Product Manager Bitbucket Server\r\n{panel}\r\n*Original message*\r\n\r\nThe side-by-side view of the diff viewer creates linked change \"bubbles\" that result in uneven scrolling of the two diffs. In cases where a lot of new code is added to a file, it becomes rather difficult to keep track of where in the file changes were made. This might be a preference, but I find the empty code blocks as used by GitHub or ReviewBoard to be easier to navigate.\r\n\r\nCould you add an option to switch between the two and we can have the best of both.",

Summary\r\nIf you open and close a connection really fast it seems to hold onto lots of them in IoServiceListenerSupport.\r\nIn the wild this is sometimes caused by haproxy health checks.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\nThe problem can be reproduced running this python script:\r\n{code}\r\nimport socket\r\nimport sys\r\n\r\nTCP_IP = '127.0.0.1'\r\nTCP_PORT = 7999\r\n\r\ndef makeTestConnection():\r\n        s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)\r\n        s.connect((TCP_IP, TCP_PORT))\r\n        s.close()\r\n\r\nnumConnections = 10000\r\nif len(sys.argv) == 2:\r\n        numConnections = int(sys.argv[1])\r\n\r\nfor i in range(numConnections):\r\n        print(str(i))\r\n        makeTestConnection()\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nThe session object number is small.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nIf you take a heap dump afterwards you will see lots of session objects.\r\nThere seems to be a 2 minute auth timeout that gets hit and some of the sessions are removed but the majority are not removed.\r\nCreating 10000 connections in seems to result in around 7000 of them hanging around.\r\n\r\nEclipse Memory Analyzer output:\r\n{noformat}\r\nClass Name                                      | Objects | Shallow Heap | Retained Heap\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\norg.apache.sshd.server.session.ServerSession    |   6,841 |    1,860,752 |              \r\norg.apache.sshd.common.io.nio2.Nio2Session      |   6,841 |      492,552 |              \r\norg.apache.sshd.common.future.DefaultCloseFuture|  13,685 |      437,920 |              \r\norg.apache.sshd.common.util.Buffer              |   6,841 |      164,184 |              \r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nThis condition could lead to an OutOfMemoryError.\r\n\r\nThis problem has been raised against Apache [SSHD-417 - Memory leak in IoServiceListenerSupport.managedSessions when clients cut connections quickly|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SSHD-417], which has now been resolved.\r\n",

More generally, a single page makes it easier to see how the change is distributed across multiple files.\r\n\r\nThe current interface in Bitbucket is what I'm used to here, and that's worked well for me.

This is a reasonable approach, if they can find the right code to emulate.  This enhancement would allow engineers to clearly define what is considered the best code to follow.  \r\n\r\n'Writing up' best practice approaches is tedious and is often overlooked in favour of building more awesome software.  This approach is fast (you are already looking at the code .. just nominate it) and fits easily into a normal process flow.\r\n\r\nFor Senior developers, doing the right thing, following best practice and not taking shortcuts is often a thankless path to take.  By providing recognition of great results, nominated and agreed by peers is a great way to light up this path and encourage good behavior.\r\n",
