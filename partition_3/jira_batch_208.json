This is only present when the Agile board has more than 1 project since you can only change a project from the 'Create Issue' screen if there are more than one in the board filter.\r\n\r\nh3. Environment\r\n* Cloud\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# go to your Agile board's planning mode and click 'Create Issue' under a specific sprint (make sure there are at least 2 projects in the board's filter)\r\n# You will notice the 'Sprint' field in the 'Create Issue' screen is pre-populated with the sprint that you clicked 'Create Issue' in.\r\n# Now change the project to something else from the Project field\r\n# Notice the 'Sprint' field is cleared\r\n# If the sprint field is empty, the issue will get sent to the Backlog as it is not tied to a sprint.\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nThe sprint field does not get cleared and the issue gets created in that sprint instead of the backlog.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nThe issue gets created and is sent to the backlog. The end user has to find the issue from the backlog, which defeats the purpose of the 'Create Issue' option within a Sprint.\r\n\r\nh3.Workaround\r\nOnce the project is changed, manually assign a value to the Sprint field in the 'Create Issue'\u00a0screen",

It will only count the time spent in the first \"cycle\" on that status.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Create a Scrum Project;\r\n# Create a Sprint;\r\n# Create an issue and put in in the Sprint then start the Sprint;\r\n# Transition the issue from \"To Do\" to \"In Progress\";\r\n# From \"In Progress\", wait a couple of minutes and then execute the transition to \"In Progress\";\r\n# Wait another couple of minutes and execute the transition to \"Done\";\r\n# Go to the board > Reports > Select Control Chart > Select All Columns \r\n# Click on the issue on the chart and it will only show the cycle time for the first cycle in the \"In Progress\" status. For example:\r\n{quote}\r\n* To Do = 3m\r\n* In Progress = 2m\r\n* Cycle Time = 5m\r\n!loop1.png|thumbnail!\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nUsing [Jira Suite Utilities|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.googlecode.jira-suite-utilities], you can see the time for the second cycle in the \"Transitions\" panel.\r\n\r\n!loop2.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nThe report should sum up \"Cycle Time\" for the two cycles in that status, or for as many cycles that might happen.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nCycle Time is only calculated for the first cycle in the status.\r\n \r\nh3. Notes\r\nThis is actually an expected behavior according to the [Control Chart documentation|https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirasoftwareserver0713/control-chart-965542669.html]:\r\n{quote}\r\n[...]\r\n*Tip 3: Exclude current work*\r\nThe Control Chart shows data for issues that have been in a selected column but are no longer in a selected column. This gives the cycle time (total elapsed time) for the issues. However, by default this will include issues which are still moving across the board.\r\n[...]\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nh3.Workaround\r\nDo not transition issues to the same status.",

      "description": "h3. Summary\r\n\r\nIf a large number of issues are created without a rank value (say from a project import), the subsequent full reindex will take a significant amount of time.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n# Project import a large amount of issues into a JIRA Agile enabled project.\r\n# Perform a full reindex.\r\n\r\nThis can also be reproduced by any of the following:\r\n\r\n* Adding a new rank field to an existing instance and reindexing.\r\n* Very high issue creation load.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nThe reindex operations completes as per the reasonable expected speed.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nThe full reindex takes a significant amount of time.\r\n\r\nh3. Verification\r\n\r\n# [Generate a Thread Dump|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Generating+a+Thread+Dump] during reindexing operations.\r\n# Verify if there are a number of threads waiting to lock {{java.lang.Object}}. This can be done by using [TDA|http://java.net/projects/tda], or if using Linux the below command will help:\r\n{noformat}\r\ngrep -A1 \"com.atlassian.greenhopper.service.lexorank.LexoRankOperation.rankInitially\" thread* |grep \"waiting to lock\" |awk '{print $1}' | sort |uniq -c\r\n  46 thread_dump_01.txt-\r\n  47 thread_dump_02.txt-\r\n  18 thread_dump_03.txt-\r\n  46 thread_dump_04.txt-\r\n  46 thread_dump_05.txt-\r\n  47 thread_dump_06.txt-\r\n  47 thread_dump_07.txt-\r\n  46 thread_dump_08.txt-\r\n  46 thread_dump_09.txt-\r\n  46 thread_dump_10.txt-\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nIn the above results there are a large number of threads waiting for that lock - due to the way the code is currently written it means every single indexing thread awaits a slow operation to complete.\r\n\r\n In the attached thread dumps:\r\n\r\n* Customer has increased the max reindex threads to 50 in order to attempt to increase the indexing speed.\r\n* This has caused 46 threads to block waiting for {{com.atlassian.greenhopper.service.lexorank.LexoRankOperation.rankInitially}}.\r\n* As a result, indexing operations take a significant amount of time.\r\n\r\nh3. Notes\r\n\r\nIt appears this is due to rank values being created for the issues that do not have them, as {{com.atlassian.greenhopper.service.lexorank.LexoRankOperation.rankInitially}} causes all indexing threads to block waiting for it to complete.\r\n\r\nOn an instance with 1500 issues the indexing time on the first run was over 60 seconds, on subsequent runs it was around 30.\r\n\r\n(!) It is *not* advised to increase the maximum indexing threads, as this can cause significant performance problems such as what we're seeing in this issue, and also result in more memory being used which can lead to OutOfMemoryErrors. This will leave the indexing process in an unexpected state and require another full reindex to guarantee consistency.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nWait for the indexing operations to complete, slowly. This can be sped up by increasing the available resources on the server, reducing the load and also verifying an appropriate read / write speed is present on the Lucene directory.

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSWCLOUD-12071].\n  {panel}\n\nh3. Summary\r\nIn JIRA Agile 6.7 there is a new feature \"LexoRank Management\". \r\n\r\nThis feature will be fantastic for users, as it prevents having to manually call REST endpoints when troubleshooting LexoRank issues.\r\n\r\nh3. Environment\r\nJIRA Agile 6.7.0 with compatible versions of JIRA. \r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\nAttempt to locate documentation on the LexoRank Management feature using Google or Confluence's search returns no relevant results. \r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nThere should be a document covering the basics of this feature and when to use it, the document should exist under: [JIRA Agile Administrator's Guide|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/AGILE/JIRA+Agile+Administrator%27s+Guide]\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nNo results for the following query in the Agile 6.7 Space: https://confluence.atlassian.com/dosearchsite.action?queryString=LexoRank&startIndex=0&where=AGILE\r\n\r\nh3. Notes\r\nThis feature replaces many of the manual rest calls covered in the Agile KB guides:\r\nFor Example:  [How To Fix Duplicate Rank Values For a Rank Field|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/AGILEKB/How+To+Fix+Duplicate+Rank+Values+For+a+Rank+Field]\r\n",

Then, I received an email from Shafinaz Elahi of Atlassian Support saying that I had once again opened it in the wrong place and gave me a link to a different place to open this, the link brought me here.  I hope this is the right place for this this time: \r\n\r\nThis is for \"Quick\r\nSubtasks for Jira\" plugin. \r\n\r\nWe have 6 types of Sub tasks in our jira instance. In the Quick Subtasks plugin, it is documented that you can set the issuetype for a task by appending \"/ issuetype:\"Bugfix Subtask\". But, when you go to add multiple subtasks, the dialog box has an issuetype drop-down\r\nand can only be set to one value. If the issuetype is set by appending it to the text, the drop-down value always overrides it.\r\n\r\nThis causes the user to have to separately add their subtasks based on the issuetype instead of being able to add all of them in one go regardless of issuetype. Is this the intended functionality and the documentation is wrong, or is this a bug? It would be very beneficial if specifying the issuetype would override the drop-down value.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nMary =)",
