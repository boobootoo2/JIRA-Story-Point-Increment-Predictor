They receive changes and features as soon as they become available.\r\n # *Preview track:* this track is only available for a sandbox environment. Products on the preview track\u00a0will receive the same changes as products on the continuous track, but they receive them as a group, every two weeks.\r\n # *Bundled track:* products on the bundled release track\u00a0will receive the same changes as products on the continuous track, but they receive them as a group, every two weeks with an additional two weeks of delay.\r\n\r\nThe bundled track and preview tracks provides admin users the control to receive changes at a regular cadence as well as the ability to preview the upcoming changes and test the new features in a sandbox respectively.\r\n\r\nThis is our first iteration of the feature and we are open to feedback.\u00a0Feel free to contact me at [mtse@atlassian.com|mailto:mtse@atlassian.com]\u00a0if\u00a0you have any questions.",

The sandbox feature is now available to\u00a0all Premium and Enterprise customers. This means that you will now have the ability to:\r\n # Create (an empty) sandbox\r\n # Delete a sandbox\r\n # Copy production data into your sandbox*\r\n\r\n*There are some known caveats with what we do/do not copy. Please refer to our [official documentation|https://confluence.atlassian.com/cloud/manage-sandboxes-1019402392.html].\r\n\r\nWe expect that providing fully capable sandbox environments will be a multi-step journey. Please refer to the sub-tasks for the features we're working on and/or considering. We will continue to share updates on this ticket as soon as features are available. Don't hesitate to contact me directly if you have questions at [mtse@atlassian.com|mailto:mtse@atlassian.com].\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n Matt Tse\r\n Senior Product Manager, Atlassian\r\n{panel}\r\nh2. What is a sandbox?\r\n\r\nA sandbox is an isolated environment where admins & developers safely test applications and extensions and preview new features without impacting the production environment.\r\n\r\nFor more about sandboxes, please check out our [official documentation|https://confluence.atlassian.com/cloud/manage-sandboxes-1019402392.html].",

As usage patterns for that customer change, we will automatically move customer data to their region of best fit, to optimise overall product performance. From\u00a0[this blog:|https://www.atlassian.com/blog/platform/reach-for-the-cloud]\r\n{quote}We\u2019ve also improved the performance of our cloud products by doubling the number of AWS regions we support around the world. We started with the US (East and West Coast) and Dublin, then quickly expanded to include Sydney and Singapore. Most recently, we launched an AWS region in Frankfurt to improve performance for our European customers. Not only does this reduce latency and improve performance for our customers in these regions, but it also will soon enable us to offer a choice of data locality for our customers.\r\n{quote}\r\nFor more details please see:\r\n - [https://www.atlassian.com/blog/platform/reach-for-the-cloud]\r\n - [https://www.atlassian.com/trust/infrastructure]\r\n\r\nWith this update, we'll be closing this ticket as Resolved.

We are happy to announce that our cloud hosting infrastructure is going global, starting with the launch of a new European region in Ireland. After migration to this new infrastructure, our European cloud customers will experience improved performance and reduced latency.\r\n We know data privacy, security, and compliance are extremely important to our customers, and we are investing heavily in all of these areas. To reinforce this effort, we\u2019ve made a foundational change in our cloud platform over the last year and are now using AWS to host our services. This enables us to offer an increased variety of cloud deployment regions, with strong performance and local failover options.\r\n But this is just a start.
