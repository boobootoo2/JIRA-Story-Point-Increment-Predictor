Problem Summary\r\nIn a Bitbucket instance linked to Jira Data Center with two or more nodes, transitioning an issue from its preview - for example, when clicking an issue key mentioned in a commit message - may return a failure even though the issue was transitioned accordingly.\r\n\r\nThis happens because Bitbucket validates whether the transition was successful by searching for the issue in Jira with a subsequent request, and in Data Center, this request may arrive at a different node because, as a design decision, we don't implement session stickiness for these interactions. If that happens, it's possible that a stale result will be returned because of the way indexes are replicated in Jira Data Center - see [Keeping Lucene Index Synchronised in JIRA Data Center|https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirakb/keeping-lucene-index-synchronised-in-jira-data-center-800694054.html].\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Behavior\r\nValidate the transition result based on the return of the first request. This should be reliable as per [JRASERVER-33909|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-33909].\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Behavior\r\nWe don't check the return of the transition request and rely on a subsequent query that may return an inaccurate result. This sometimes causes Bitbucket to incorrectly report the transition failed with an error message.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Connect a Bitbucket instance to a Jira Data Center installation with two or more nodes and a load balancer configured - we found this to be most reliably reproduced with AWS' ELB;\r\n# Commit to a repository in said Bitbucket instance mentioning an existing issue key in the connected Jira installation;\r\n# In Bitbucket, locate the commit and click the link of the issue mentioned in it;\r\n# Attempt to transition the issue to any status. You may have to do so a number of times;\r\n# At some point you may get an error similar to the below:\r\n!bitbucket-transition-error.png|thumbnail!\r\n(i) _*Message:* \"The transition could not be completed due to an unexpected error.

(if the hook prevents online editing of lua files)\r\n# Open the pushed file in Bitbucket In-browser editor and add some text\r\n# Push Commit \r\n# Edit or keep the message and click Commit again\r\n\r\nAnother option would be to develop own pre-commit hook add-on which generates RepositoryHookVetoedException\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nThe commit showing an error message pop-up with the text from {{RepositoryHookVetoedException}}\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nThe dialog hags indefinitely and JS console in the browser is showing an error:\r\n{code}\r\nUncaught TypeError: a.replace is not a function\r\n    at c

Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nImplement a read-only mode for Bitbucket.\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\n+Disable SCM access for both HTTP(S) and SSH and in browser file editing+\r\n\r\nDisable SCM access for both HTTP(S) and SSH, as well as disabling file editing in Bitbucket Server itself.

Alternative workarounds\r\n\r\nDepending on your goal, you could also use one of these workarounds:\r\n\r\n+Remove write permissions using REST API endpoints+\r\n In this way, commit pushes to repositories and projects can be prevented but it will still be possible to create pull requests unless we completely remove the access (including the read-only one) to the repositories. Any other system changes (e.g. user directories, add on installation) cannot be prevented.\r\n\r\n+DNS rules update+\r\n At the DNS level, the traffic can be directed to static page indicating to the users that Bitbucket is not accessible and where to go instead (e.g. the URL of the new instance) In this case, both HTTP and SSH access has to be blocked as per above.",

I don't know if it is the correct group or not, Having answers to (1/2/3) above would solve this.\r\n\r\n5) Given User (X) - Please show a list of Groups they belong to.\u00a0 \u00a0Note that I also am members of various groups - Please indicate perhaps in BOLD text - groups that both (User(X) and MYSELF) belong to.\r\n\r\n============\r\n\r\nThis is a *HUGE* problem for our team - it happens often, every time somebody moves across projects, or a new person comes or a person exits - They do not have access to projects, we want to grant access via GROUPs but Groups are sort of useless.\r\n\r\nThis is not a BITBUCKET or JIRA administrator level request - this is for an AVERAGE user.\r\n\r\nThis is *NOT* a request for an Administrator - an AVERAGE user should be able to get to this.\r\n\r\nWhat i describe here is what I saw at a previous employer- they used this method to join various GROUPs - Access to things could be granted via specific user NAME or By way of GROUP name.\u00a0 The GROUP name also served as a mailing list name. It was VERY helpful and VERY useful.\r\n\r\nEffectively \"the name\" - aka; Group name or in their case \"mailing list name\" - became the security group name - which could be use just about anywhere.\r\n\r\n======\r\n\r\nI want three things - this is for JIRA and BITBUCKET and CONFLUENCE\r\n\r\nAs a *NON*ADMIN* user - I should be able to - and need this feature:\r\n\r\n*REQUEST (A)*\u00a0you have today a LIST OF PEOPLE - with mug shots. (BTW - This is really hard to find, it should be easy to find)\r\n\r\nWhat is MISSING and I want you to add is a list of GROUPS the person belongs to.\r\n\r\nWhen displaying the list of groups -\r\n\r\nOPTION 1 - show them in TWO lists:\u00a0 (Group 1) groups that we SHARE in common (I belong and they belong) and (Group 2) list of groups that they belong to, and I do not belong to.\r\n\r\nOR - OPTION 2 - Lists the groups in multiple columns - IF that person AND myself BOTH belong to the same group THEN show the group name in BOLD,\u00a0 ELSE show the group name in NORMAL text.\r\n\r\nI should be able to CLICK on any group and see the details of the group.\r\n\r\n*REQUEST\u00a0(B)*\u00a0What is MISSING is a means to LIST OF GROUPS with descriptions.\r\n\r\n(This should be right below or next to the VIEW PEOPLE item)\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThis can be shown in two ways:\u00a0\r\n\r\nOPTION 1 - As two separate lists - (group 1) the list of groups that I belong to, and (group 2) the list of groups that I do not belong to.\r\n\r\nOR OPTION 2 - If i am a member of that group THEN display the name in BOLD, ELSE show the group name in NORMAL.\r\n\r\n*REQUEST\u00a0(C)*\u00a0When displaying a group (something you do not have)\r\n\r\nMinimally - List the *OWNER* of the group and contact information for that person.\r\n\r\nBETTER - It would be great if groups could be self administering.\r\n\r\n1) A CLICK button LEAVE a group,\r\n\r\n2) A CLICK button to JOIN a group - Some groups might be \"automatic-approval\"\r\n\r\n3) A CLICK button to REQUEST (from the owner) to JOIN the group.\r\n\r\n\u00a0",

So I want a build on Jenkins to be triggered when a pull request is approved by the named reviewer.\r\n\r\nThe Jenkins job is configured to be triggered remotely using a token and that token is specified in the Bitbucket Webhook along with the Jenkins URL. This is working as expected. The Jenkins job is triggered automatically as soon as the pull request is approved by the reviewer.\r\n\r\nBut, I have also configured a merge check for the project . The merge check is enabled for minimum successful builds and the number of builds to be successful is configured to be 1. So, I expect the merge button to be enabled as the reviewer has approved the pull request and the Jenkins build has run (also success). But unfortunately, the merge button is not enabled even after all this. I also triggered a build manually on the same commit ( was success too ) but with no success on the merge button being enabled. Please help me out. Thanks.",

Problem Definition\r\n\r\nBitbucket Server / Data Center does not currently support connecting to load-balanced AD servers.\r\n\r\nSynchronising between AD servers is not supported. Microsoft Active Directory does not replicate the uSNChanged attribute across instances. For that reason, we do not support connecting to different AD servers for synchronisation.\r\n\r\nMany companies have a single DNS entry (mydomain.mycompany.com) that points to a load balancer that directs traffic to one of many directory servers. (Or, some companies might use DNS round robin.) However, neither the use of DNS round robin nor use of an actual load balancer is supported by Bitbucket \u2013 both approaches to load balancing direct traffic to different servers, which would lead to the synchronization of a not replicated uSNChanged attribute.\r\nCurrently, Bitbucket only supports connecting to a single directory server, not different (load-balanced) servers.\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nAdd support for load-balanced LDAP/AD.\r\nh3. Note\r\n\r\nThis is dependent on CWD-2783\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n # Switch to a delegated user directory\r\n # Connect to a single LDAP server",
