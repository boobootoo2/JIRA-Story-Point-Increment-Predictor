However, when we use the [Confluence Preview|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/ConfCloud/Display+Files+and+Images#DisplayFilesandImages-Previewafile] to take a look at attachments and images, we can only use the keyboard to move to the next/previous attachment and close the Previews. \n\nHaving keyboard shortcuts for all of the commands available within the preview plugin would definitely help. Having said that, it would be important that the keyboard shortcuts are listed on-screen (for both sighted users as well as users using screen readers). Additionally, for any controls in the preview pane, it would be good to allow the user to tab through those controls as that is a fairly well used mechanic utilized with screen readers.\n\nThis is a suggestion to allow the users to also have keyboard shortcuts to access the other options of the Preview. For example:\n\n# 'D' to Download the image file.\n# 'U' Upload a new version of the file (attached files only).\n# 'C' to Comment on the file.\n# 'Z' for the Zoom, out or fit the image to the width of your browser.\n# 'B' to Browse like a slideshow using the next and back buttons.\n# 'S' Switch to a full screen presentation mode",

An important use case is to embed Box widgets in Confluence pages.\n\nThe Widget Connector Macro should support Box embeds. Box has an API to obtain the embed URL, so this seems pretty simple to implement. Here's some documentation from Box for developers.\n\nIt seems the same issue was closed in 2014 as unresolved. https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONF-23203\n\nSince Widget Connector doesn't work, we're using a painful manual workaround with Iframe Macro. The user has to manually set up the iframe, which is confusing for laymen. Basically, they need to find and copy the embed link and then paste it in an iframe macro, and at minimum define the width and height. Box instructions for embed widget.\n\nAlso, the Iframe Macro doesn't seem to support full screen. It should have a field or checkbox for \"allowfullscreen\". \n\nPlease support Box.com with the Widget Connector! It is crucial for the workflow of any company using Box.com for file storage.",

I apparently don't have 3 karma points yet, so my activities are limited.\n\nI posted a question.  Someone posted an answer to it.  I tried to write a comment on that answer, but it seemed to hang trying to display the comment box, so I created a new question to ask the question I was trying to ask in the comment.  I later noticed that the comment box finally displayed, so I went back to it and added the information about the question I wanted to ask.  When I tried to post it, it said I couldn't do that until I had 3 karma points.\n\nI then went to the second question I had posted.  Someone provided an answer to that, but I had to ask an additional question, so i tried to write a comment asking that question.  Guess what it said?  I then tried to post a new third question, and it just said \"Not Permitted\".\n\nDo I have to go somewhere else to get questions answered about how to use Atlassian products?",

I have a status board showing pie charts of various aspects of a broad effort. Filtering on the total effort, or one of the two aspects results in three separate pie charts where the colors map to different statuses! This makes the pages significantly less easy to interpret. \n\nThe current implementation appears to assign colors based upon the magnitude of various aspects of the project, which might be fine for filtering on other things, but on status it makes multiple pie charts on the same page difficult. A fix for this would be to assign colors based upon the order the statuses are enumerated... in such a way the statuses wouldn't change from one chart to the next, and you could again interpret the charts as \"too much blue\" or \"all green means everything is closed\", etc.\n\nSome examples follow.\n\n*Total work effort:*\n!image-2016-05-06-08-02-18-756.png|thumbnail! \n\n*One of the two aspects:*\n !image-2016-05-06-08-03-24-197.png|thumbnail! \n\n*The other aspect:*\n !image-2016-05-06-08-03-48-096.png|thumbnail!

Environment\n* Confluence 5.9.9\n\n\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\n\n 1. curl -v -S -u admin:password -X POST -H \"X-Atlassian-Token: no-check\" -F \"file=@myfile.txt\" -F \"comment=this is my file\" \"http://localhost:8090/rest/api/content/<page id>/child/attachment\" | python -mjson.tool\n 2. check <confluence_install>/temp directory.\n\nh3. Expected Results\n\nTemplory files should be deleted after completing the REST API.\nor \nA scheduled jos deletes them.\n\nh3. Actual Results\nTemplory files remain after competing REST API program.\nAnd when Confluence is stopped, those tmp files are deleted.\nThis means those files maybe remain in temp directory for long term.\n\n\nh3.Workaround\n restart conflunece, then those attachment-*.tmp files are deleted.",

I am going to try the workaround recommended in the bug, but would love to see the 'Export to Word' function working seamlessly - OR - remove the menu choice.\n\nWe moved to Scroll PDF exporter, and that plug-in has been helpful for PDF. Perhaps this feature should require a configurable plug-in as well?\n\nIf you want to contact me to discuss further, I would be open to that.\n\nSteve Abel\nsteve.abel@twcable.com\nSenior Technical Writer (and on our team of Atlassian Administrators)\nTime Warner Cable",

Suggestion\n\nOptionally use Bitbucket and/or Bitbucket Server to store attachments for Confluence. This would be especially beneficial for large files, with Git LFS that was recently introduced.\n\nThrough branch permissions and application links, permissions could be managed as well and many of the problems that currently exist in attachment handling in Confluence would be solved by this.\n\nFile versioning would also be solved by the basic concepts of SCM.\nh5. Possible implementation\n\nThere could be a\u00a0Bitbucket project per Confluence instance, creating a repository for each space. Branch permissions could be used to maintain permissions outside of Confluence as well, but alternatively the project/repository could be limited to the integration only.\u00a0",

Scenario probably tied to ID-6682.\r\n\r\nh2. *Step 2*\r\n # When you are starting a Confluence site, there are no spaces, so it makes sense to start by creating one, but for new users, they are prompted to create a space if they do not have access to see other spaces, now for a new user that just arrived, the likelihood of having a dummy space created is big.\r\n # New users without the create space permission will still be prompted to create a space, they will type a name and click next, landing on the Confluence dashboard and without any spaces or any message of clarification.\r\n # The screen is not large enough or does not provide an option to see the full space name when the length is larger than the available space, additionally, there is no description of what the space is about.\r\n # New users do not have instructions on what to do at this point of their on-boarding, which space to watch, etc, they might end up watching a random space and getting spammed by unuseful content on their email box.\r\n\r\nh1. *Notes*\r\n\r\nPer this article on [how to skip the wlecome action in confluence for new users|https://confluence.atlassian.com/confkb/how-to-skip-the-welcome-action-in-confluence-for-new-users-777016501.html], Confluence Server administrators can disable the add-on that manages the Welcome page for new users in Confluence. The page will be displayed to users until the new users watch a space.\r\n\r\nHowever, in Confluence Cloud disabling system add-ons is a restricted function, and thus administrators in Cloud cannot skip the welcome screen.\r\nh1. *Suggestion*\r\n\r\nMake the Confluence on-boarding experience configurable.\r\nh2. *Step 1*\r\n * Allow administrators to disable this step or only show the screen for newly created Confluence sites, while the team is growing.\r\n\r\nh2. *Step 2*\r\n * Provide the option to customize a welcome message for new users.\r\n * Allow administrators to set a default watch space for new users, additionally offering the option to disable the step in the case a default space is selected.\r\n * Show the description of the selected space if available.\r\n * Provide the option to disable the step.",

Any help would be much appreciated.\n\n*Issue:* I have a couple of epics and some stories associated with each of them in JIRA. When I created a wiki page in Confluence, I inserted some issues from JIRA using \"JIRA Issue/Filter\" built-in macro to display all the Epics and their respective stories in a table. \nWhile all the other attributes appear correctly +I am not able to get to display, the names of the Epics in the table+. I have included +Epic Name+ and +Epic Link+ both the columns, but Epic Name column in the table is empty, while Epic Link just populates the JIRA Id of the Epic in question.\n\n*Ultimately, I need to display Epic Names in the table and not their ids.* Please suggest how this could be fixed.\n\n+*Also, for your reference, please find the screen shot attached with the ticket*+\n\nh3.Update\n\nThis issue seems to also affect other fields like Version. When user generates a report; instead of showing the version number; it shows the version ID instead.\n\nFor example. \n\n{code}\njira=> select * from projectversion where id = 17718;\n  id   | project | vname | description | sequence | released | archived | url | releasedate | startdate \n-------+---------+-------+-------------+----------+----------+----------+-----+-------------+-----------\n 17718 |   11200 | 1.9   |             |       10 |          |          |     |             | \n(1 row)\n{code}\n\nWhen a report is generated; instead of showing version 1.9 for an issue in a report; it shows 17718 instead.

The blue part is not rendered and due to the font colour being white, it's not visible in the email.\n\nYou can generate this problem by either sending an invitation to an Lotus Notes user or a password reset request.\n\nI understand, that Lotus Notes is not officially supported by Atlassian, however as a administrator, I do not necessarily have the control over my clients email applications, i.e. I do not know what they use or it's not my decision. Basically, if I send out invitations, I do not know if the email is readable or not.\n\nOne easy solution to this could be to just send an link without any style applied. Could be implemented as an option for customers who face this problem.",

Would it be better to leave it broken, or to repair the link, instead of prefixing the local server to it?\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. Edit this page:  https://wiki.cac.washington.edu/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=72219641\n2. Insert a mistyped link:  http:/washington.edu/calendar/trumba\n3. Click Save\n4. Go visit your link and see where it goes.\n\nExpected:\n1. Link would be \"fixed\" and extra / would be added after the http:/ so the link would go to its intended destination\nor\n2. Link would go to broken link that I typed in\nor\n3. I would have been notified after step 2 (or possibly after step 3) that I entered an invalid link\n\nActual:\nhttps://wiki.cac.washington.edu/ is affixed to the beginning of my link making it:\nhttps://wiki.cac.washington.edu/https:/washington.edu/calendar/trumba\nI can understand why the software thought that the \"https:/\" could have been a directory, but this has been confusing for some of our users.\n",

This is to support the situation when a private space is set up to contain sensitive information (passwords, private keys, etc.) and we don't want page edits to trigger email containing the sensitive information (as that will open up many more ways in which that info can be sniffed or hacked by 3rd parties).\n\nThe ideal solution will implement the same Notification Scheme setup available in JIRA (where each JIRA project can be assigned its own notification scheme... similar, each Confluence space should have the ability to be assigned its own notification scheme also.\n\nMany others have asked for this before:\nCONF-174\nCONF-29996\nCONF-27567\nCONF-28326\nCONF-30826\nCONF-33698\nCONF-35985\nCONF-41394\nCONF-33887\n\nI think this is a basic/fundamental functionality for a wiki software designed to support multiple spaces with different access rights.\n\nThank you.",

And still it lacks one feature that is to link a color to a specific serie.\nWhen using several charts on the same page with the same set of series, charts that have one of the series that has no data induce a color shift in the chart.\nSo latests series in the charts are rendered with different colors.\nIt would be nice to have not only a color list as parameter for custom colors in charts, but a list of key/value so we can specify the color of each serie specifically.\nThis option should be propagated to \"jira chart\" macro.\n\nHere is a sample with jira chart and another with usual chart (using an automatically generated table for the data set)",

After receiving the error you can save the page again to prevent to error from happening because the generated page url is automatically changed to .../page-title-1. Saving a page again without changing anything seems like an odd flow to me. My first reaction was that it is not possible to create a page with the same title.\n\nThis should not be an error message, but a notice. I suggest the url is automatically change to .../page-title-1 after saving the first time. A notice message after saving the actual page would be an option.",
