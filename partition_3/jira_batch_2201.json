Since my upgrade to 2.7, I have hundreds of pages in the wiki with links that are now broken when users edit them in the Rich Text editor. And when users fix the links by adding in the space key, their fixes are lost as soon as another user opens the page again in the Rich Text editor. It's proving to be a maintenance nightmare.\n\nAs an alternative, maybe you could add an optional syntax that would strip the space key, such as the following:\n\\[ENG::Home\\]\nwhich would indicate that the page creator does not want to display the space link.",

I hope to use the WIKI to publish a new engineering textbook on water treatment plant design. I have a wealth of drawings that I have created in PowerPoint. I don't want to have to recreate all of those drawings in Gliffy. The drawing objects must retain their vector based format so they can be edited in the WIKI. One possible solution is to add functionality to the Gliffy macro so it can accept clipboard contents of MS office drawings. \n\nImage based attachments are not acceptable because they would require also saving the original drawing in some other format and would require a multiple step process for any edits to the drawing. If the wiki can only display an image file, then any revision to that display would require first editing the original drawing object file, converting the drawing to an image, and then uploading that image file to the wiki.\n\nI rate this as a Major priority based on the suggested rating system. This is a major loss of function compared with the copy and paste functionality we have in other document creation environments.",

However, I found no documentation on how to create a page family using templates so that child pages will be created automatically. So my questions are: \n1. Is it possible to create a template with associated children pages so that when the main page is created using that template, the children pages will be automatically created or can be edited if a child page is also a templete?\n\n2. If the above is not available, is there a way to COPY (not MOVE - it wouldn't be a page family template if the children are gone) the child pages from Example (or selecting from some or all the pages in a Space) to the page being created using the template, i.e., see PageCreatedByExampleTemplate? To keep the child pages unique, this process would need either to automatically prepend a predefined string (i.e., PCBET_ in my example) to the new child pages or have the ability to enter it (either each one individually or one prefix for all) at the time of creation.\n\nExample\nChild1\nChild2\nChild3\n\nExampleTemplate\n\nPageCreatedByExampleTemplate\nPCBET_Child1\nPCBET_Child2\nPCBET_Child3\n",
