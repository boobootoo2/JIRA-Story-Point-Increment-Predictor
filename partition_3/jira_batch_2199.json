Example of the ping request and response, sent every few seconds:\n\n{noformat}\nINFO   | jvm 1    | 2008/04/28 20:08:05 | Received a packet PING : ping\nINFO   | jvm 1    | 2008/04/28 20:08:05 | Send a packet PING : ok\nDEBUG  | wrapperp | 2008/04/28 20:08:05 | read a packet PING : ok\nDEBUG  | wrapper  | 2008/04/28 20:08:05 | Got ping response from JVM\nDEBUG  | wrapperp | 2008/04/28 20:08:09 | send a packet PING : ping\nINFO   | jvm 1    | 2008/04/28 20:08:09 | Received a packet PING : ping\nINFO   | jvm 1    | 2008/04/28 20:08:09 | Send a packet PING : ok\nDEBUG  | wrapperp | 2008/04/28 20:08:09 | read a packet PING : ok\nDEBUG  | wrapper  | 2008/04/28 20:08:09 | Got ping response from JVM\nDEBUG  | wrapperp | 2008/04/28 20:08:13 | send a packet PING : ping\nINFO   | jvm 1    | 2008/04/28 20:08:13 | Received a packet PING : ping\nINFO   | jvm 1    | 2008/04/28 20:08:13 | Send a packet PING : ok\nDEBUG  | wrapperp | 2008/04/28 20:08:13 | read a packet PING : ok\nDEBUG  | wrapper  | 2008/04/28 20:08:13 | Got ping response from JVM\nDEBUG  | wrapperp | 2008/04/28 20:08:17 | send a packet PING : ping\nINFO   | jvm 1    | 2008/04/28 20:08:18 | Received a packet PING : ping\nINFO   | jvm 1    | 2008/04/28 20:08:18 | Send a packet PING : ok\nDEBUG  | wrapperp | 2008/04/28 20:08:18 | read a packet PING : ok\nDEBUG  | wrapper  | 2008/04/28 20:08:18 | Got ping response from JVM\nDEBUG  | wrapperp | 2008/04/28 20:08:22 | send a packet PING : ping\nINFO   | jvm 1    | 2008/04/28 20:08:22 | Received a packet PING : ping\nINFO   | jvm 1    | 2008/04/28 20:08:22 | Send a packet PING : ok\nDEBUG  | wrapperp | 2008/04/28 20:08:22 | read a packet PING : ok\nDEBUG  | wrapper  | 2008/04/28 20:08:22 | Got ping response from JVM\nDEBUG  | wrapperp | 2008/04/28 20:08:26 | send a packet PING : ping\nINFO   | jvm 1    | 2008/04/28 20:08:26 | Received a packet PING : ping\nINFO   | jvm 1    | 2008/04/28 20:08:26 | Send a packet PING : ok\nDEBUG  | wrapperp | 2008/04/28 20:08:26 | read a packet PING : ok\nDEBUG  | wrapper  | 2008/04/28 20:08:26 | Got ping response from JVM\nDEBUG  | wrapperp | 2008/04/28 20:08:30 | send a packet PING : ping\nINFO   | jvm 1    | 2008/04/28 20:08:30 | Received a packet PING : ping\nINFO   | jvm 1    | 2008/04/28 20:08:30 | Send a packet PING : ok\nDEBUG  | wrapperp | 2008/04/28 20:08:30 | read a packet PING : ok\nDEBUG  | wrapper  | 2008/04/28 20:08:30 | Got ping response from JVM\n{noformat}\n\nIt would be handy if there was an option to disable this logging so it doesn't clutter the terminal.",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFSERVER-11758].\n  {panel}\n\nOriginally created as request for metadata plugin enhancement and the developer suggested I request this from confluence instead.\n\nWe use confluence and metadata for more detailed planning and collaboration of issues that we track in Jira. It would be very nice to have metadata fields in the wiki captured from jira fields from the related issue in Jira. For example, I have an issue in Jira with a priority number attached to it. In the wiki I would want to define a piece of metadata such as: {metadata-jira:Priority}PM-32{metadata-jira}\n\nand this would resolve the metadata to the priority field for the issue PM-32 in my configured Jira instance. I would then be able to reference this piece of metadata in metadata reports and charts.\n\nHi Ken,\n\nI don't want to add JIRA support to the Metadata Plugin, because that opens the floodgates to similar integration requests with other applications out there. Instead I suggest that you request that Confluence create a new JIRA macro that can give you back data about any project. You can then use this macro as metadata as you describe.\n\ne.g something like:\n{metadata-value:Priority}{jira-value:priority|issue=PM-32}{metadata-value}\n\nNote that this requires that the jira-value macro knows how to access your JIRA instance. For example, the jira-issues macro requires that you pass that information every time. Anyway, that is something for the Confluence and JIRA teams to agree upon.\n\nIf you agree with this approach, then I will close this issue.\n\nThanks,\n\n    * Andy\n",

It is possible to create rss feed listing changed content from personal spaces only, but that isn't usable if one or two users are much more active than others or if there has been many changes recently. Thus, it would be nice to see a list of changed *spaces* making it is easy to see if someone has created new content in one's personal space.\n\nThis feature could be included in Recently Updated Macro, and maybe this functionality could be included in browsepeople.action-page, too (some kind of sorting order perhaps). Macro could list the most recent change(s) in a space (configurable amount) and a picture of that space. \n\nHere is an example of macro showing two recent changes per space:\n|| :) Anne's space | List of hobbies | by Anne (04 May) |\n|| :) Bob's space | Re: Bob's blog | by Charlie (03 May)  | \n| | Bob's blog | by Bob (03 May)  | \n|| :) Charlie's space | How I... | by Charlie (02 May) |  \n\nThis feature is important because it would encourage users to update their personal spaces ([this is important specially for new users|http://www.wikipatterns.com/display/wikipatterns/MySpace]) and make it easier to find other users' personal spaces.\n\nIf there already is some way to do this I apologize the fuzz ;)",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFSERVER-11634].\n  {panel}\n\nI have 2 suggestions related to users and group management in the Administration section of Confluence.\n\n1) Have the number of users displayed when viewing the group members (Administration-->Manage Groups-->Group Members) configurable.  This would essentially be the same functionality that is on the Manage Users screen available through the Show (10, 20, 50, 100) option.  The old version of Confluence we used would display all group members, while 2.8 displays 10 members per page.  Some people like more, some less, so it would be a nice-to-have to be able to select this dynamically.\n\n2) When creating a new group, it would be great to be able to add members in bulk.  Currently I have to create the group, then search for each individual user, edit their groups, and add them to the new group.  It would be more efficient if when the group is created (or alternatively have an option from the Manage Groups-->Group Members screen) to multi-select users to add to the group as a single add operation.\n\nThanks for considering these enhancements,\nBarry Pape",

Rows in the Content table that represent drafts, contain values for draftpageid, draftspacekey, draftpageversion and drafttype.  \n\nThey contain NULL for pageid and spaceid.  There seems to be no reason at all that they couldn't use pageid and spaceid instead of their own values. \n\nI suspect draftpageversion could quite adequately use version, which is always 1 for drafts, but I can see that the columns have slightly different meanings and therefore have a reason for being separate.\n\ndrafttype is always the type of the page to which draftpageid refers.  I haven't researched whether there is a good argument for repeating it here or whether it would be just as useful to retrieve it by the reasonably simple join of draftpageid (or if I have my way just pageid) = contentid.\n\n",

What I would like to do is to assign \"view\" or \"edit\" permissions on a page for a set of people or groups.\n\nThere seems to be limited documentation on the Confluence website. I tried different approaches to use the SetContentPermission method using various parameters but it doesn't seem to work. It seems like on JIRA messageboard other developers using SetContentPermission from the SOAP APIs are having difficulty as well.\n\nI've provide a sample of how I was using the setContentPermission method (.NET C#) to set view only restrictions on a page for the \"test group\".\n\n// create confluence service\nConfluenceSoapServiceService service = new ConfluenceSoapServiceService();\n\n// create collection for group/people to assign to the page\nRemoteContentPermission[] objGroupCollection = new RemoteContentPermission[1];\n\n// instantiate a group (\"test user\" group)\nRemoteContentPermission objGroup = new RemoteContentPermission();\nobjGroup.groupName = \"test user\";\n\n// put the \"test user\" group in the collection\nobjGroupCollection[0] = objGroup;\n\n// assign the group collection to view only permissions \n// the selected page\nbool flag = service.setContentPermissions(pageTN.Profile.SessionId, remotePage.id, \"VIEW\", objGroupCollection);\n",

These notifications tend to confuse users too, as they only say \"Page edited\" and only show the newest version, not what has changed. This will probably be even more of a problem with the easy page moving in Confluence 2.8.  An option to turn off notifications for a space while reorganising would be very helpful.

The application does shut down as it is run as a service with the above message being displayed in the cmd window. The actual shut down is done via {{Confluenceconsole.bat}}\n8) Chose to run the {{Confluenceconsole.bat}} instead, brings up the application, but also keeps filing up the console with repeated packet sent checks to the JVM, for the lifetime of the application instance.\n9) Please rephrase the message on the {{Start Confluence in browser}} screen to something like {{Launch the Setup Wizard}}.\n10) Failed to upgrade using the installer as Tomcat refuses to start with following errors in the logs:\n{noformat}\n14/04/2008 14:31:49 org.apache.catalina.core.StandardContext start\nINFO   | jvm 1    | 2008/04/14 14:31:50 | SEVERE: Error listenerStart\nINFO   | jvm 1    | 2008/04/14 14:31:50 | 14/04/2008 14:31:49 org.apache.catalina.core.StandardContext start\nINFO   | jvm 1    | 2008/04/14 14:31:50 | SEVERE: Context [] startup failed due to previous errors\nINFO   | jvm 1    | 2008/04/14 14:31:50 | 14/04/2008 14:31:50 org.apache.coyote.http11.Http11BaseProtocol start\nINFO   | jvm 1    | 2008/04/14 14:31:50 | INFO: Starting Coyote HTTP/1.1 on http-8080\nINFO   | jvm 1    | 2008/04/14 14:31:50 | 14/04/2008 14:31:50 org.apache.catalina.startup.Catalina start\n{noformat}\n11) Out of the 8 times that I ran this installer by uninstalling the previously installed instances and choosing the same directory for every install, apart from the first run of the installer, I have not been prompted to select the Tomcat port on any of the remaining executions.",

Set the context to be \"/confluence\" so you access the local instance as \"http://localhost:8080/confluence\". \n\nNow suppose the customer has setup a Web server such as Apache that accesses this server using the URL \"http://my.confluence.com\", thus has no context. (You don't need to setup Apache to reproduce this, simply keep following the below steps.\n\n2) Change you Server base URL to be \"http://my.confluence.com\"\n\n3) Export a space (which has attachments, one of which is an image attachment and is displayed on the page) in html format. You will find that the image attachment is located within the export in both export/confluence/download/attachment/.../.../image.jpg and export/download/attachment/.../../image.jpg. \n\nTo reproduce this behaviour more easily I have included a space export. \nAfter completing step 1,2 above, do the following. \na) Import the export into your 2.7.3 install. \nb) export the space as a html file. \n\n\nCustomers should be able to have two different contexts and still not have a duplicate files in the export. \n",

Say Boots looks after the slides for the Confluence webinar. I download the file on Monday and subscribe to the attachment. Boots updates the file on Tuesday. I get a notification that the file has been updated so I can then download the latest version.\n\nNot sure how much work is involved in this but I think it would be a great feature to have to boost our sales pitch of using Confluence to replace your shared network drive or document management system.",

It feels wrong to just copy and paste the entire/tiny URL, because then you don't get the wiki \"nice linking\", but at the same time I can't be bothered manually typing in the link to the item (I'm not sure of the syntax for news with the timestamps).\n\nTo make this easier, there could be a \"wiki link text\" field on the Info page for an item, that shows the raw wiki markup you need to copy and paste into your post to make a link. Alternatively, it would be cool if at the bottom of an item, there was a \"Link to this page\" button, that when clicked shows you the raw wiki markup so that you can copy and paste it.",
