Problem Definition\n\nIn JIRA, when displaying the Burndown Chart, you are able to click a drop down to change the 'estimation statistic' used in the axis of the chart. When the gadget is embedded in Confluence, the axis used is based on the configured estimation statistic for the board, but it's not possible to switch views in the embedded Confluence gadget. \n\nh3. Suggested Solution\n \nAdd a drop-down list in the Confluence gadget that allows switching between the estimation statistics (story points, original time estimate, issue count). \n\n",

Summary\nThe *Spaces* menu in the top bar has a drop-down which shows each space of the instance. However, when we minimize the window of the browser so that the _Spaces_ item shows inside the *More* drop-down list, the *Spaces* button loses it's drop list.\n\nThe interesting part here is that if the Spaces menu is working and we minimize it, the list will still show up even though the Spaces button is under *More*. However, if we refresh the page the list is gone. The same happens if the problem is occurring and you maximize the window so that the spaces gets back to the top bar, the problem still happens until the page gets refreshed.\n\nh3. Environment\n* Happens with any browser in any OS.\n\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\n# Open the dashboard page in a browser;\n# Check that the Spaces drop-down menu works;\n# Minimize the page so that the Spaces button goes under the *More* button, becoming accessible through the More drop-down list;\n# Refresh the page\n\nh3. Expected Results\n* The Spaces button inside the *More* list should show the list of the spaces just like it shows before refreshing the page.\n!Working1.png|thumbnail!\n!Working2.png|thumbnail!\n\nh3. Actual Results\n* The Spaces button doesn't have the drop list to show the spaces.\n!NotWorking1.png|thumbnail!\n!NotWorking2.png|thumbnail!\n\nh3. Notes\n* There's no error entries in the logs and neither network errors in the developer tools of the browser.\n* I noticed that the CSS class is different when the Spaces button is in the top bar compared to when it's under the More button. Thus when we refresh the page the Browser's cache gets overwritten with the new class that doesn't have the drop list.\n\nh3. Workaround\n# Keep the window big enough so that the Spaces menu doesn't go under the *More* button;\n# Zoom out the page so that the Spaces menu doesn't go under the *More* button.",

However, the documentation is not clear on what actions are included in the batched notifications and what actions will result in an e-mail to be sent out immediately.\n\nMore info on the feature here: [Confluence 5.10 Release Notes|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Confluence+5.10+Release+Notes#Confluence5.10ReleaseNotes-Moretimeforeveryone].\nh5. Suggested solution\n\nPlease update the documentation to mention the kinds of actions are part of the batched notifications and which are not.\n\nFor example, adding an attachment to the page (not the body of the page) or adding an inline comment to an attachment will immediately send out an e-mail to users watching the page/space. Editing the page content, however, will wait until the next batch window to send out the batched notifications e-mail to users.",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFSERVER-43391].\n  {panel}\n\nThe current documentation do not sufficiently cover the technical details of the index recovery feature introduced in Confluence 5.9:\n* https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Confluence+Data+Center+Technical+Overview\n* https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Confluence+Data+Center+disaster+recovery\n\nAn important item to note about the index recovery process is that it is performed only on node startup. The first document does touch upon this, but also contains some misleading information, namely:\n{quote}\nIf you need to reindex Confluence for any reason, this is done on one node, and then picked up by the other nodes automatically. \n{quote}\n\nThis is because if you rebuild the index on one node, other exist nodes will not actually pick it up unless those nodes are new or require index recovery. Additionally, the recovery is only done on startup, and will not affect nodes currently running. The way index recovery works in 5.9 and higher is as follows:\n{quote}\nOn start up, a node will check the status of each of its indexes in its local home to see if it is missing, corrupt or out of date.\n\nIt does this by comparing the index entry id stored in the local journal file, e.g. journal/main_index file, in the journal folder in the node's local directory, with the index entry id in the database:\n* If the local journal file is missing or has an entry id of 0, the index is missing.\n* If the local journal entry id is not found in the database table \"journalentry\", then the index is out of date.\n* If the index cannot be read programmatically by lucene API, the index is corrupt.\n\nIf any of the above scenarios are found to be true, the node will attempt to recover the index in the following order:\n* Try recover search index by checking the shared home directory for a valid index backup file.\n* Try ask other nodes in the cluster for an index backup.\n* Perform a reindex.\n{quote}\n\nAdditionally, there are optional JVM parameters that affect index recovery which should be documented:\n{code}\nconfluence.cluster.index.recovery.generation.timeout\n{code}\nDefault: *120* seconds. The amount of time, in seconds, that the confluence node needing index recovery will wait for an index snapshot to be created by another node, before it gives up and fails the index recovery attempt.\n\n{code}\nconfluence.cluster.index.recovery.query.timeout\n{code}\nDefault: *10* seconds. The amount of time, in seconds, that the confluence node needing recovery will wait for an index snapshot offer from any of its peers, before it gives up and fails the index recovery attempt.\n\n{code}\nconfluence.cluster.index.recovery.num.attempts\n{code}\nDefault: *1* attempt. The number of attempts the node will try to recover its index.\n\nNote that if this is set to 0, then effectively the 5.9 index recovery feature is disabled. If an index is found to be out of date, unavailable, or corrupt, then that node will automatically rebuild its own index after startup.\n\nFinally, because of the 5.9 index recovery feature, if an administrator needs to rebuild from scratch the index across all nodes in a cluster (i.e. if all nodes are suspected to have untrustworthy index files), they'll need to temporarily disable the index recovery feature. Otherwise, on startup the node without the index will simply try to recover from another node which defeats the purpose of reindex from scratch. This process is laid out in the following KB: https://confluence.atlassian.com/confkb/how-to-rebuild-the-content-indexes-from-scratch-on-confluence-data-center-833941594.html",

With those two factors combined, the way that the inline comment editor / viewer currently renders as a right sidebar makes for a bit of a \"scrunched\" display (see attached - not even at most comfortable magnification for me). On a 24\" monitor, even with the tools sidebar closed, the comments are blocked into a relatively narrow column down the right side.\n\nWhat would be really helpful is an option to render the inline comment editor / viewer _underneath_ the text that was highlighted. I've provided a very simplistic mock-up, showing the comment view pane below the paragraph that is highlighted with the inline comment. While a non-modal pop-over would be very cool, a bottom-docked pane for viewing and editing the comments associated with a marker would do the trick (almost like a split editor window). ",

Let me explain:\n\nLet's say your roadmap is on a year (1st January to 31st December). It will be a long roadmap and so, it will show you a scrollbar (horizontally). We're in August now. It would be great to see the roadmap \"from\" August and not from \"January\".\n\nWDYT?\n\nThank you for your attention\n\nBest regards,\n\nRapha\u00ebl Dehousse",

Like \"Start Date\" and \"End Date\" and the bar would position itself correctly in the roadmap. It would speed up greatly the creation of these bars in the roadmap. Moving/Resizing the bars would actually change the dates as well.\n\nThanks a lot for your attention.\n\nBest regards,\n\nRapha\u00ebl Dehousse",

Although I realize that it does not have an official API, we still found it reasonably straightforward to extract data from JIRA and our other tracking systems and automatically create custom roadmaps that help us understand how our work rolls up across 30 scrum teams.  (Note that the JIRA product roadmap tool will not work for us because we also need to display custom operational data, for which we use confluence's chart functionality to get it all into one place.)\n\nIn order to understand how the work rolls up, we define two levels of epic - larger ones that span across teams and smaller ones that belong to one team.  We really would like to be able to show the larger and smaller epics together in the same lane but in different colors so that someone viewing the page is clear that these are different things.  Different colors would also help us convey other levels of information - for example, the product or target release for an epic, or which team is actually working on it.\n\nNote that this is *not* a request to support individual bar colors in the UI.  I realize that would likely end up being more work and introducing potential usability problems.  This request is just to support optionally including a color as part of the JSON data for the bar and displaying the bar in that color if it is present.\n\nThe lane is already being used to group related items together, so we would prefer not to have to separate these issues into different lanes.

Summary\nAttempting to edit page restrictions when a large number of users are listed prevents the changes from being saved. This appears to be due to Confluence putting the full list of user numbers in the http header, which means the size exceeds the maximum default for Tomcat (4KB), which causes Confluence to return a 404 page not found.\n\nh3. Environment\n* Confluence 5.9.11\n\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\n# Create a new page\n# Edit the page restrictions, add 61 users to view permission and 61 users to view/edit permission\n# Try to apply the restriction change\n\nh3. Expected Results\nThe modification should be saved.\n\nh3. Actual Results\nIt is showing an error on the restriction popup without any detail message.\n{quote}\nThere was an error submitting the page restrictions. Please try again later. \n{quote}\nSee HAR findings in private comment below\n\nh3.Workaround\nAs a short term workaround solution, you can either chose to use a group instead of individual users, or increase the header size limitation on both Tomcat and at the proxy level.

But those parameters only affect the search when typing a search term. If the search form is submitted the parameters won't be part of the search action request. Currently, we use small JavaScript snippets to change the request and append the macro parameters to it.\n\nAre there any plans to change the behavior of the Live Search Macro and add its parameters to the request when submitting the search form?\n\nRegards, Christian",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFSERVER-43327].\n  {panel}\n\nUsing assistive technologies, such as a screen reader and Chrome extensions, we believe there is currently an issue, not necessarily a bug, with the headings provided in the editor.\n\nBy default the main page title / heading is a HTML H1 tag, which is correct as it's the main heading. However, when it comes to formatting the sub-headings within the main edit area / section(s), which are subordinate / lesser than the main page heading, H1 is provided as an option.\n\nThere is an argument that this is correct, and provides flexibility for all users, but as the majority of our users don't fully understand accessibility and heading structures, they simply start with Heading 1 and go from there; it therefore becomes an education element for our staff of recommended page editing and formatting options. We were therefore wondering how many other people are unknowingly affected by this; especially because visually you have two different styles for a H1 tag.\n\nWe try to create each Confluence page to one subject, minimising the overall length of a page so that it's easy to read and understand; converting long pages into separate individual pages. Multiple H1 headings should therefore not be used in our installation, hence why we would like an option to remove \"Heading 1\" from the drop-down list; or behind the scenes in the HTML code \"Heading 1\" actually gets converted to a H2, \"Heading 2\" becomes a H3 HTML tag, etc.\n\nWe welcome yours, and others, thoughts on this subject.",

For example, the fields Components, Affects Versions, and Fix Versions are written as \"Component/S\", and likewise.  Please see the attached screenshot.  I would suggest that, most importantly, the final \"S\" should be lower-case rather than upper-case.  It is really weird to see it written in upper-case.  Also, less importantly, I would suggest that the \"/\" symbol not be used and instead these items just be written as plural.  Thanks!",

Feedback I've heard from other folks is that many don't use the workbox. Nevertheless, I think it could be a valuable core component of Confluence life if we could move items from the workbox to a virtual donebox or just hide them at the user's discretion.\n\nI get many notices on important things that I watch, but there is no way to tick them off and mark them processed.  I watch these spaces because I collaborate to do work, not just to see a log of what was touched. Can we make this more of an actual work box?\n\nApologies if I missed a previous similar suggestion.",

No longer having the default behavior of the compact page tree in the left sidebar is conflicts with how we use the system. We rely on that feature to be a table of contents and immediate guide to a space so that users know at a glance what content is available. We also have written many tutorials and specifications that use that left side page tree as the only source of navigation.\n\nThe multi step process to get a page tree back is not a good option, plus it takes up much more screen real estate than before. We are very unhappy with this change and hope the beta program provides opportunity for this feedback to be heard. I consider the system to be significantly less usable if this feature stays.\n\nI'm also unable to find any release notes for this beta so can not determine if there is any support for disabling this feature, what to call it or how to submit beta feedback.",

Expected Results\n\nBecause the directory is read-only, the password cannot be reset. A message similar to the following would be helpful:\n{quote}\nYour account is managed by <application name>, and cannot be updated at Confluence. Please visit <application url> to make changes to your account. If you're having trouble, please consult your system administrators.\n{quote}\nThis lets the user know their account cannot be changed at the current application, and where to go for managing it.\n * We know the directory is read-only\n * We also know which directory a user logs in through\n * We're also aware of where that directory is located (since we have this configuration as a part of the directory)\n\nh5. Actual Results\nThe update fails, and the following message appears:\n{quote}\nAn internal error occured\u00a0when trying to change your password.\n{quote}\nUsers must contact the administrator, rather than being able to self-service.\nh5. Workaround\n\nSetting the directory Read/Write allows users to reset their passwords in Crowd and JIRA from a downstream application such as Confluence. However, there are some cases where this may not be desirable - Confluence should fail gracefully, and guide the user to a location where they can change their password.",
