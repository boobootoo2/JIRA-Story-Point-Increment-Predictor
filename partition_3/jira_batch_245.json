As is it complicated to explain, I decided to give an example, with steps to reproduce:\r\n\r\n1) An open sprint exists.\r\n2) Add a Story with remaining time estimate of 1 hour to the existing open sprint.\r\n3) Go to the burndown chart and see that the table shows correct information, i.e. scope change, issue added to sprint, 1 hour in Inc column\r\n4) Log 1 hour against the issue \r\n5) Go to the burndown chart again and see that the table now shows 0 hours in the line where we have scope change, issue added to sprint. And there is no new line saying Work logged, 1 hour.\r\nIt seems that GreenHopper \"smartly\" collapsed the issue addition and the log time operations. This is bad because we lost an important piece of history, i.e. 1 hour was added and 1 hour was deducted (through work log).\r\n\r\nIf the 1 hour was logged the next day instead of the same day, the history would be correct.",

Then, as new projects get added, swimlanes automatically expand. For example, multiple projects, each with their own sprints - an accumulated kanban board could have swimlanes by sprints, which keeps expanding as more projects are added (or subtracted).",
