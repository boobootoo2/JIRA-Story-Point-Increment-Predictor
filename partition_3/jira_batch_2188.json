I really enjoy the new features and no bugs yet :-)\n\nHowever, on the Word/Powerpoint page rendering one issue that still makes life difficult is the incomplete rendering/display support for Word/Powerpoint documents containing Text Boxes. \n\nIn 1.6 it shows the text within the boxes at least but its mostly all left justified and there are no box outlines, or Word autoshapes or graphic objects such as box join lines or arrows displayed.\n\nAbove: think a flowchart done in Word with text boxes and arrows - thats what I'm trying to display in rendered in a Confluence page.\n\nI know the above can be done in Gliffy or embedded as a JPG in the word doc but we have 1000's of Word and Powerpoint documents containing text box content and converting them will take a long time, and in some cases such as ISO 9000 documents we always want to store everything in the Word document since there is (as yet, hint, hint!) no way to export pages from Confluence (e.g. PDF export) with headers, footers, proper pagination, etc suitable for such \"controlled\" documents.\n\nThis missing Word/Powerpoint text box support from the Office connector is restricting further application of Confluence in our business. Please consider this feature request ASAP.",

(The cursor jumps all the way to the top of the page.) We have our draft save frequency set to 30 seconds since we have users working on detailed documentation and we do not want to take any chances on losing their work.  We have discussed setting it to a more lengthy time period to make it less annoying but this is not a feasible option given the nature of the work that could be lost. We desire to have cursor position maintained in order to allow people to work in rich text mode without interruption while not having to risk any lost work product.  The best solution would be to have this fixed please.",

Thus, a few years down the track when we all forget and the number of CSS imports creeps up again, we'll see a test failure before we start seeing random JavaScript errors in IE.\n\nCreated as a separate issue from CONF-17151, as writing the automated test is a lower priority task that shouldn't delay the release process.",

The implementation was ultra-conservative due to the last minute change.  After 3.1 is release we should reimplement this method and check that all its usages make sense.  Many appear to have been calling getPageOrDummyPage out of habit more than requirement.\n\nThis task came out of the code review of CONF-17350",

This was done for good reasons a long time ago.  It prevents methods on dependencies being deliberately or accidentally called using inappropriate request parameters.\n\nThat problem was solved more thoroughly by CONF-13056 in Confluence 2.10, so it is now possible to safely reorder them.\n\nThis would be extremely beneficial, since it would allow us to better componentise the actions in a spring-friendly way.  State and Behaviour could be happily delegated to ActionHelpers used by different Actions that don't extend each other but share commonalities.  This is currently infeasible without retrieving things directly from the ContainerManager.  Similarly painful is the inability of parameter setting methods to transform IDs to objects by calling methods on dependencies.  ",

This can lead to rare circumstances whereby a remote client, if poorly written, or resource starved in the JVM, can fatally spam Confluence with full system GC calls until (if) it recovers.\n\nThe effect is similar to:\n{noformat}378.030: [GC [PSYoungGen: 13733K->10886K(418816K)] 257769K->254922K(1336320K), 0.0438305 secs] [Times: user=0.05 sys=0.00, real=0.05 secs] \n378.074: [Full GC (System) [PSYoungGen: 10886K->0K(418816K)] [ParOldGen: 244036K->244138K(917504K)] 254922K->244138K(1336320K) [PSPermGen: 66190K->66190K(135168K)], 1.5175107 secs] [Times: user=4.92 sys=0.05, real=1.51 secs] \n379.924: [GC [PSYoungGen: 15258K->712K(435328K)] 259396K->244850K(1352832K), 0.0091928 secs] [Times: user=0.00 sys=0.00, real=0.02 secs] \n379.933: [Full GC (System) [PSYoungGen: 712K->0K(435328K)] [ParOldGen: 244138K->240486K(917504K)] 244850K->240486K(1352832K) [PSPermGen: 66592K->66590K(131072K)], 1.6306610 secs] [Times: user=4.53 sys=0.00, real=1.63 secs] \n382.535: [GC [PSYoungGen: 19106K->11462K(431104K)] 259592K->251948K(1348608K), 0.0230824 secs] [Times: user=0.06 sys=0.00, real=0.03 secs] \n382.558: [Full GC (System) [PSYoungGen: 11462K->0K(431104K)] [ParOldGen: 240486K->240176K(917504K)] 251948K->240176K(1348608K) [PSPermGen: 66648K->66646K(131072K)], 1.3173999 secs] [Times: user=4.14 sys=0.00, real=1.31 secs] \n383.926: [GC [PSYoungGen: 12066K->5636K(446080K)] 252242K->245812K(1363584K), 0.0219822 secs] [Times: user=0.05 sys=0.00, real=0.03 secs] \n383.949: [Full GC (System) [PSYoungGen: 5636K->0K(446080K)] [ParOldGen: 240176K->245655K(917504K)] 245812K->245655K(1363584K) [PSPermGen: 66668K->66668K(131072K)], 1.2802751 secs] [Times: user=4.03 sys=0.00, real=1.27 secs] \n385.301: [GC [PSYoungGen: 7271K->224K(441408K)] 252926K->245879K(1358912K), 0.0217929 secs] [Times: user=0.03 sys=0.00, real=0.03 secs] {noformat}\nRendering the installation incapacitated.\n\nFrom [Sun|http://java.sun.com/javase/technologies/hotspot/gc/gc_tuning_6.html#other_considerations]:\n\n{quote}Another way applications can interact with garbage collection is by invoking full garbage collections explicitly by calling System.gc(). This can force a major collection to be done when it may not be necessary (i.e., when a minor collection would suffice), and so in general should be avoided. The performance impact of explicit garbage collections can be measured by disabling them using the flag -XX:+DisableExplicitGC, which causes the VM to ignore calls to System.gc().\n\nOne of the most commonly encountered uses of explicit garbage collection occurs with RMI's distributed garbage collection (DGC). Applications using RMI refer to objects in other virtual machines. Garbage cannot be collected in these distributed applications without occasionally collection the local heap, so RMI forces full collections periodically. {quote}Alternatively,{quote}The frequency of these collections can be controlled with properties. For example,\n\n\t java -Dsun.rmi.dgc.client.gcInterval=3600000 -Dsun.rmi.dgc.server.gcInterval=3600000 ...\n \nspecifies explicit collection once per hour instead of the default rate of once per minute. However, this may also cause some objects to take much longer to be reclaimed. These properties can be set as high as Long.MAX_VALUE to make the time between explicit collections effectively infinite, if there is no desire for an upper bound on the timeliness of DGC activity.{quote}\n\nOriginates from [CSP-38789|https://support.atlassian.com/browse/CSP-38789]. Explicit remote GC can be completely disabled (ignored) via {{-XX:+DisableExplicitGC}} in Tomcat startup parameters, under Sun Hotspot. Recommend we add this to the distribution startup parameters. Ignoring client requests for GC should not have any impact moving forward as Confluence has already been notified that the object is dirty, or dereferenced, and will reclaim it as part of normal collections.",

We don't say 'Click here', rather the link text should be a description of what is found at the destination of the link. Change this to something like 'Confluence Gadget Documentation'.\n- The text 'Click here for ...' is too large. It should be the same size as the text above it.\n- There is a hover background colour on the gadget specs, but they aren't clickable. You should only use hover highlighting when the target is clickable.\n- The description for the Activity Stream says, 'Lists recent activity in a single project, or in all projects.', but we don't have projects in Confluence. Should it say 'space'/'spaces' instead?\n- The gadget thumbnails are scaled down here like in the macro browser when they don't need to be. (I presume they're scaled down. If they're not, we need to recreate those images because they look badly scaled.)\n\nSome improvement ideas:\n\n- Make the text 'By Atlassian' and 'Gadget URL' smaller (or greyer, or both) so that the title and description are more obvious. The latter are the important pieces of information, so they should stand out a bit more.\n- Make the font for the description text in the left panel the same size as the body font on the right-hand side.\n- Put some short introductory text in the dialog. Either above the 'How to use these gadgets' on the left, or in a panel above the gadgets on the right. It should explain what gadgets are: 'Gadgets allow you to display Confluence content and information in other applications.'\n",

I can navigate down a few levels, but cannot reach pages stored below that level. For example in our doc43 space I can navigate to the Reference Guide page, but not to the Client Browser page.\n\nThis is important as we need to make a large number of changes to the pages because the Word imported inserted hundreds (perhaps thousands) of spurious anchors.\n\nThanks,\nLarry",
