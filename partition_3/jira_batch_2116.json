This results in a skeleton plugin with broken imports and packages. The error message in the IDE recommends to fix this issue by refactoring the class \"from  a.b.c to a.b.c\", which looks redundant to a human reader. At second look, I see it was generated with illegal whitespace in the code, and in directory names.\n\nI likely introduced the spaces into the wizard by copying and pasting the groupId and artifactId etc from another terminal window (e.g. selected an extra space before the groupId by accident). I assume the same problem can also happen at all other steps, e.g. where we rename MyServlet.java. \n\nNo class or package can start with space anyway. Atlas-create* should just trim it, and not generate a needlessly broken skeleton. \n\nExamples of inconsistencies:\n\n* MyPluginComponent.java and MyPluginComponentImpl.java start with \"package  too.many.spaces;\" \n* pom.xml says: \"<groupId>too.many.spaces</groupId>\"\n* atlassian-plugin.xml says: <component key=\"myPluginComponent\" class=\" too.many.spaces.MyPluginComponentImpl\" public=\"true\"><interface>too.many.spaces.MyPluginComponent</interface></component>\n* atlassian-plugin.xml says: <servlet name=\"My Servlet\" i18n-name-key=\"my-servlet.name\" key=\"my-servlet\" class=\"too.many.spaces.servlet.MyServlet\">\n* Also the test files have spaces in package and import.\n* Extra whitespace in directory names such as \" just-testing\".\n\nReproduce:\n\n{{C:\\Users\\someone\\TEST>atlas-create-confluence-plugin\n[...]\nDefine value for groupId: :  too.many.spaces\nDefine value for artifactId: :  just-testing\nDefine value for version:  1.0-SNAPSHOT: :\nDefine value for package:   too.many.spaces: :\nConfirm properties configuration:\ngroupId:  too.many.spaces\nartifactId:  just-testing\nversion: 1.0-SNAPSHOT\npackage:  too.many.spaces\n Y: : Y\n[...]\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\nC:\\Users\\someone\\TEST>cd \" just-testing\"\nC:\\Users\\someone\\TEST\\ just-testing>atlas-create-confluence-plugin-module\n[...]\n[INFO] --- maven-confluence-plugin:5.0.13:create-plugin-module (default-cli) @ just-testing ---\nChoose Plugin Module: \n[...]\n[INFO] Adding the following items to the project:\n[INFO]   [class: it.too.many.spaces.servlet.MyServletFuncTest]\n[INFO]   [class: too.many.spaces.servlet.MyServlet]\n[INFO]   [class: ut.too.many.spaces.servlet.MyServletTest]\n[...]\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\nC:\\Users\\someone\\TEST\\ just-testing>\n}}\n\n",

When we print we want to print the page precisely as it currently looks. (i.e With Expand macros all collapsed, or some collapsed and some expanded).\n\nAt the moment the page just prints as though all the Expands are expanded.  Not useful!\n\nAs a work around we have to Duplicate the page, remove the expands, save and print.  It means we always have to maintain a 2ndary copy of some articles with empty Expand macros.\n\nExporting to PDF is not a viable option either because the PDF rendering isn't WYSIWYG either; the images for example are all printed at 100% size, not at the size we've specified in the page.",

Actual Results\nInstead of the page rendered the activity tab will show the following:\n{noformat}\nError: RuntimeException occurred while performing an XHTML storage transformation (In template Confluence.Templates.Macro.MasterDetail.contentLink2: When evaluating \"contextPath()\": Error while computing function \"contextPath()\": null)\n{noformat}\n\nThe Confluence logs show the full error:\n{noformat}\ncom.atlassian.confluence.content.render.xhtml.XhtmlException: RuntimeException occurred while performing an XHTML storage transformation (In template Confluence.Templates.Macro.MasterDetail.contentLink2: When evaluating \"contextPath()\": Error while computing function \"contextPath()\": null)\n@4000000055b0bb120346302c       at com.atlassian.confluence.content.render.xhtml.storage.StorageXhtmlTransformer.transform(StorageXhtmlTransformer.java:65)\n@4000000055b0bb1203463414       at com.atlassian.confluence.content.render.xhtml.TransformerChain.transform(TransformerChain.java:38)\n@4000000055b0bb1203463be4       at com.atlassian.confluence.content.render.xhtml.TransformerChain.transform(TransformerChain.java:38)\n@4000000055b0bb120346479c       at com.atlassian.confluence.content.render.xhtml.PluggableTransformerChain.transform(PluggableTransformerChain.java:43)\n@4000000055b0bb1203464b84       at com.atlassian.confluence.content.render.xhtml.DefaultRenderer.render(DefaultRenderer.java:114)\n@4000000055b0bb1203464f6c       at com.atlassian.confluence.content.render.xhtml.DeviceTypeAwareRenderer.render(DeviceTypeAwareRenderer.java:56)\n@4000000055b0bb1203465354       at sun.reflect.GeneratedMethodAccessor721.invoke(Unknown Source)\n@4000000055b0bb120346573c       at sun.reflect.DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.java:43)\n@4000000055b0bb120346573c       at java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Method.java:483)\n...\n@4000000055b0bb1203486a7c Caused by: com.google.template.soy.tofu.SoyTofuException: In template Confluence.Templates.Macro.MasterDetail.contentLink2: When evaluating \"contextPath()\": Error while computing function \"contextPath()\": null\n@4000000055b0bb1203487634       at com.google.template.soy.tofu.internal.BaseTofu.renderMainHelper(BaseTofu.java:341)\n@4000000055b0bb1203487634       at com.google.template.soy.tofu.internal.BaseTofu.renderMain(BaseTofu.java:300)\n@4000000055b0bb1203487a1c       at com.google.template.soy.tofu.internal.BaseTofu.access$100(BaseTofu.java:56)\n@4000000055b0bb1203488da4       at com.google.template.soy.tofu.internal.BaseTofu$RendererImpl.render(BaseTofu.java:427)\n@4000000055b0bb1203488da4       at com.atlassian.soy.impl.DefaultSoyManager.render(DefaultSoyManager.java:118)\n@4000000055b0bb120348918c       at com.atlassian.soy.impl.DefaultSoyTemplateRenderer.render(DefaultSoyTemplateRenderer.java:52)\n@4000000055b0bb120348918c       at sun.reflect.GeneratedMethodAccessor796.invoke(Unknown Source)\n@4000000055b0bb120348a8fc       at sun.reflect.DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.java:43)\n@4000000055b0bb120348a8fc       at java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Method.java:483)\n{noformat}\n\n \nh3.

However when you do this the space picker displays the value as blank.\n\nIt looks like this is caused by a simple JS bug. In initSelection.renderSpaces() a array of objects is passed into the callback. This value is eventually passed to the select2 formatSelection() function. This function works with an object, not an array. Changing the code in renderSpaces()  to pass in an object should fix the bug.",

This is going to be a showstopper in JIRA 7.0, because the quartz scheduler isn't going to be exported by JIRA core anymore.  If it really needs scheduling, it will have to use {{atlassian-scheduler-api}} or be happy with SAL.\n2. I don't understand why it has this dependency at all.  It doesn't seem to be doing anything with it, and the version it specifies in its top-level pom is 2.1.2, which isn't what either JIRA or Confluence exports.\n\nP.S.: I couldn't find a component that seemed relevant for Workday and you wouldn't let me submit without one, so I picked BugFix Team.\n",
