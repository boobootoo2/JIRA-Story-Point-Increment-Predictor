If the answer in question is already accepted, it will be un-accepted.\n\nThis is a bad API design, as it means that repeated requests to this URL will cause the answer to toggle between the two states endlessly. Since accepting an answer also causes an email notification to be sent, this makes Answers vulnerable to a storm of email notifications being generated.\n\n[Idempotent|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotence] Web APIs are a good design practice. Additionally, having a {{GET}} request that is _not_ idempotent actually breaks the contract of the HTTP protocol\\[1].\n\n{quote}\n9.1.2 Idempotent Methods\n\nMethods can also have the property of \"idempotence\" in that (aside from error or expiration issues) the side-effects of N > 0 identical requests is the same as for a single request. The methods GET, HEAD, PUT and DELETE share this property. Also, the methods OPTIONS and TRACE SHOULD NOT have side effects, and so are inherently idempotent.\n{quote}\n\nAdditionally, {{GET}} requests should not be used to modify the state of entities on the server. The fix for this bug should probably be in two parts:\n\n1. The {{accept_answer}} end-point should be broken up into two separate {{accept_answer}} and {{unaccept_answer}} end-points.\n2. The end-points should be modified to accept only {{PUT}} requests, instead of {{GET}} requests.\n\n1: http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html\n",

Background\n[~zverev.vasiliy35530848045926] noticed this issue on Atlassian Answers and posted a new question when he couldn't proceed -- [https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/35772255]. It seems he's using an invalid URL because the ID of the Answer in the URL doesn't match content on the Question in question.\n\nThis is an issue because accessing Confluence Questions via an invalid link may not be a common problem, but it's easy to accidentally append or subtract a single letter from a URL when copy-pasting. This may be more widespread than we think.\n\nWhen navigating to non-existant Questions, we get a message that the Question doesn't exist. When navigating to non-existant Comments on an actual Question, there is no issue. When navigating to non-existant Answers on an actual Question, we have a problem.\n\nh4. Steps to reproduce\nClick the following URL to an answer on Atlassian Answers: https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/35762363/answers/35771303\n\nThis URL is referencing two pieces of content -- \n# *Question* 35762363\n# *Answer* 35771303\n\nh4. Expected results\n* The question (35762363) should load\n* The answer (35771303) should be highlighted\n* All page content should load properly\n\nh4. Actual results\n* The question (35762363) loads\n* The answer is not highlighted\n* The answer is of a different ID than one would expect from the URL (*{color:red}35763985{color}*)\n* The sidebar of 'related questions' does not render (see image) \\\\  !image-2016-02-03-21-55-29-312.png|thumbnail! \n* Comment and Answer editors do not load (see image) \\\\ !image-2016-02-03-22-00-34-378.png|thumbnail! \n* The following line is added to the browser console when clicking inside of an editor \\\\ {noformat}Bootstrap:initialise: No settings found.

In this case, they provided steps for the StartSSL CA.\n\nThe customer faced some issues during the integration with Hipchat and created a guideline.\n\nSteps:\n{quote}\nIMPORTANT: private key and keystore password need to be the SAME. If not then you need to specifiy the password for the private key *6)\n1) Create CSR and private key on your linux box:\nopenssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout private.key -out request.csr -subj \"/C=na/ST=None/L=None/O=None/CN=None\"\n2) Create certificate with the generated CSR for your domain. (in StartSSL go to \"Certificates Wizard\", paste the generated CSR for your domain and submit. Download and extract the certificate and CA Chain.)\n3) Create PFX file from certificate (step 2), private key (step 1) and Certificate Chain (step 2 - root bundle or intermediate cert depending on CA):\nopenssl pkcs12 -export -out <PFX-filename>.pfx -inkey private.key -in <your-certificate>.crt -certfile <CA-chain-file>.crt\n(you can use the same password for the PFX file as for the private key to make things easier - we won't need the PFX file later and can destroy it)\nThe output should read like this:\n>Enter pass phrase for private.key:\n>Enter Export Password:\n>Verifying - Enter Export Password:\n4) Convert the PFX into a Java keystore. In your JRE bin directory on your linux box execute:\n./keytool -importkeystore -srckeystore <PFX-filename>.pfx -destkeystore <new-keystore-file>.keystore -srcstoretype PKCS12 -deststoretype JKS\nIMPORTANT: Use the SAME PASSWORD for the keystore as for the private key from step 1)! otherwise see *6)\nThe output should read like this:\n>Enter destination keystore password:\n>Re-enter new password:\n>Enter source keystore password:\n>Entry for alias 1 successfully imported.\n>Import command completed:  1 entries successfully imported, 0 entries failed or cancelled\n5)Edit your server.xml, uncomment the <Connector port=\"8443> and point the keystore entry to your <new-keystore>.keystore and supply the keystore password from step 1. (keystoreFile=\"<new-keystore>.keystore\" keystorePass=\"<password from step 1>\")\n*6) If you want to set different passwords for the private key and the keystore then you have to:\n./keytool -keypasswd -keystore /path/to/keyestore.file -alias <alias-in-keystore>\nIf you're not sure about the alias: ./keytool -list -keystore <name-of-keystore>\n*7) Alternative to creating a PFX file including the CA chain file:\n./keytool -importcert -alias startssl-CA-chain -keystore <path-to-atlassian-directory>/jre/lib/security/cacerts -file <CA Chain Cert in PEM format>.crt\n{quote} ",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFSERVER-46537].\n  {panel}\n\nh3. Problem Definition\nThe *Add Page* space permission is what grants users the ability to reorder pages in Confluence. There are cases where users should be able to add pages, but not have the ability to reorder pages in a space. Moreover, when page restrictions are in place for hierarchies in a space, users who are restricted from seeing other hierarchies have the ability to reorder pages of restricted hierarchies, even though they cannot edit them. \n\nThis poses an issue for proper documentation, as users can easily move pages, even if they are restricted from editing. A similar feature request was submitted (CONF-24901), but was marked as incomplete. \n\nh3. Suggested Solution\nThere are two ways around this: \n# Create a separate space permission for *Reorder page*.\n# Create a new page restriction that denies everyone from moving pages in the hierarchy, except for select users or groups. \n\nOut of the two, number 1 would likely be best.\n\nh3. Why this is important\nThis is important because users should be able to add pages without having the ability to completely transform the hierarchy of a space. \n\nh3. Workaround \nThere is no real workaround. That said, you can create separate spaces for different hierarchies so that only users who should be able to reorder pages can do so in their own space without affecting other hierarchies in the original space.
