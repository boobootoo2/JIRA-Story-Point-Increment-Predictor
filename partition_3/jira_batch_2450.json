Sometimes I forget what file I&#x27;m looking at by the time I get to the end, and I have to scroll back up to the top of the file to see the header indicating the file path. This precision scroll jump can be difficult if there are lots of files in the diff; if you go too quickly, you can miss the separation padding between files. Then I have to jump back down to the next file to continue reviewing.\n\nI suggest floating the file header with the file path so that it is always visible, or \"sticky\" to the top of the screen. When you begin scrolling through a diff, eventually the diff of first file listed will begin to move offscreen. When this happens, the filename header should remain onscreen by sliding down from its original position. Only when the file diff is completely scrolled offscreen should the filename also scroll offscreen.",

As a division, we use JIRA for Kanban in an effort to move towards being able to continuously deliver. This means that we have numerous repositories with completely different concerns when it comes to code review and merging pull requests.\n\nBecause of this, I have been looking for a good way to integrate a checklist into our process that prevents code from merging into master unless it&#x27;s ready. It would be a game changer if each repo admin could set up a custom checklist template that had to be completed before being able to merge. There are a handful of plugins that let you automate blocking merges for a specific condition, but not everything a team wants to require is already built into software somewhere.\n\nExamples include necessary unit testing, integration testing, end to end API and/or UI testing, feature functionality, build success, deployment success, code formatting checks, etc. With the multitude of automation integrations available with Atlassian products, this and some API endpoints would allow teams to completely automate code review instead of needing different tools for every check.\n\nIf this feature was to get added, a major subsequent feature would be to enable or disable nested checklists from repo admin perspective as well. This would allow devs and QA to add/edit/delete checklists that implicitly become required before a merge as well.",
