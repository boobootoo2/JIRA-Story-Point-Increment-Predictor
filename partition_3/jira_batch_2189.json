Since then we have upgraded several times, but the Demonstration Space has stayed the same since when it was installed. I'm sure this space has had the UI enhanced as well as gives helpful documentation and examples to users, so I would prefer to be able to upgrade this space to the most current content that ships with our latest version of Confluence.\n\nI have searched to try and find how to do this but I have not been able to find if there's already a method. I wouldn't mind to just delete the space and re-create from an XML backup. Maybe during upgrade there could be an option to re-deploy the demonstration space. Could a possible workaround be to delete the demonstration space before upgrading, and upon upgrading the latest version will be added?\n\nThanks",

There have been some complaints about the reported supported level of core macros that aren't also \"system\" plugins.  The solution to this isn't clear.\n\nOne possibility is that the plugin manager page should not depend on the plugin's isSystem flag to decide whether or not to show it.\n\nIt seems that the plugin manager page will only show plugins that are not explicitly marked as system plugins. That means, any plugins that are marked as a system plugin (the {{system}} attribute in {{atlassian-plugin.xml}}) will not show there. When that happens, the plugin cannot be disabled/enabled by Confluence admins.\n\nI think that logic is fine, but it might be semantically wrong for plugins that are _not_ marked as system plugins but sit in the application class path. One such plugin would be the Profile Macros. It was intentionally marked as a non-system plugin because users want to be able to enable/disable it.\n\nAlso, this raises a few questions:\n\n* If a plugin that sits in the application class path is not a system plugin, what type of plugin is it? Note: Plugins in the application class path cannot be upgraded or downgraded.\n* Can system plugins be enabled/disabled?\n* How should Confluence differentiate system plugins that can be enabled/disabled from those that can't be?\n\nSee also discussion in CONF-17005.\n",

One of my users has complained that they cannot quickly review the Dashboard's Recently Updated list for interesting changes, as the list no longer includes the Space that the updated content is in. Seems this is because the recently-updated-dashboard macro does not have a \"showSpace\" option, or similar.\n\nThis is a minor problem easily worked around, but would be nice to have added anyway.\n\nh3. Workaround\n\nThe dashboard recent updates macro has a mode where profile pictures are not displayed that also happens to display the space names when the macro is not used inside a space.\n\n* Go to the Confluence Administration > Look and Feel > Layouts page\n* Create a custom \"Global Layout\"\n* Remove the \"showProfilePic=true\" macro parameter from the recently-updated-dashboard macro",

Currently no numbered heading will be generated (that is already tracked on CONF-1732) but still, the numbering in the resulting list will be reset at every included page. If context could be passed to the included page the numbered list renderer could continue with the global enumeration rather that resetting to 1, resulting in documents with the structure  \n{noformat}\n1.\n   a.\n   b.\n1.\n   a.\n   b.\n{noformat}\n\nBest Regards,\nEdoardo",

Also an accompanying macro to display digital signatures would be useful that either shows all digital signatures, or a signature for a particular user.  It would also be nice to set what users must sign a page.  \n\n{panel:title=Atlassian Status as of 29th February 2016|borderStyle=solid|borderColor=#3C78B5| titleBGColor=#3C78B5| bgColor=#E7F4FA}\nWe do not have any plans to implement this in the foreseeable future. In order to set expectations correctly, we're closing this request now. \nThere are a number of [Marketplace|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/search?application=confluence&q=approve] add-ons which provide this functionality.\nThank you for your votes and comments on this issue, along with your ongoing patience.\n\nRegards,\nConfluence Product Management\n{panel}",

The link is dynamic as is will select the difference to be between last revision you saw the most recent revision at the time you click the link. There is no more email notifications until you visit the page. I.e. if someone makes a series of small changes (as is common when editing a document and saving frequently) you get one email with a link that shows all of changes.

Give the album a name and save it. Add pages, comments, attachments from other Confluence instances. Add JIRA issues. Add other web pages and images. Reorder pages to suit you. Export to PDF or HTML.\n\n*User stories:*\n* I'm only interested in specific bits of the company intranet. I want some way of seeing them all in one place. I don't care about the other stuff.\n* When I'm wearing my team lead hat, I want to know about these bits. But when I'm wearing my JIRA developer hat, I need to know some entirely different bits.\n* I need these bits for a presentation. I want to put them in a specific order, and mix and match just for this presentation.\n* I want to give new team members a quick-start guide containing the bits they must get across quickly.\n* I want to pull together ideas from different locations and show them to other people. The stuff is all over the place right now - on the web, in our documentation, on our extranet, in our bug tracker. \n\nWhere can I pull all this stuff together? In Confluence, of course.\n\n*Making an album:*\n\nSimplest scenario: Within your Confluence instance, you can:\n* Drag or paste pages (links) into a container (\"album\") in your personal profile or in a space. (Maybe add pages etc also via a browser bookmark, as the social bookmarking plugin does.)\n* Save the album, so that you can use it again later.\n* View the content of your album - Come back and see what's happened in your album a day later.\n* Print the album. This will print the content of all the pages in your album.\n* Export the album to PDF or HTML. This will export the content.\n\nVersions:\n* Each time you view, print or export, you get the latest version of the pages you've included. The page content is not stored in your album, just the links.\n* We could maybe include the option to choose a specific version of a page, blog post or attachment, i.e. to freeze that bit of the album at a specific point in time.\n\nEven nicer scenario: Include other Atlassian products and things other than pages. So you can include the following in your album:\n* Confluence attachments (images, Word documents, PDF documents, etc).\n* Confluence comments.\n* People (profiles).\n* Confluence blog posts, and other Confluence content types.\n* Pages etc from other Confluence instances, not just the current instance.\n* JIRA issues.\n* JIRA issue attachments.\n* Stuff from other Atlassian apps.\n\nAnd a cooler scenario yet: Include stuff from the web:\n* Images from the web.\n* Web pages.\n\nSooper dooper scenario: As well as providing the view, print and PDF/HTML export, how awesome if you could:\n* Include dynamically-updated content from your Confluence-housed album onto your blog or other web site.\n\nWhere would you save your album?\n* In your Confluence user profile, on a new \"Albums\" tab.\n* In a new \"Albums\" tab on global spaces.\n\nSee further user stories and discussion on the [internal extranet page|https://extranet.atlassian.com/display/~smaddox/2009/08/15/Idea+for+Confluence+Feature+-+Make+Me+a+Mashup].",

Typically, a 2G system will require about 2 seconds. If we parallelize this, where N is cpu count, we can reduce this 'stop-the-world' event on contemporary systems to 1/4 or 1/8 or better of the original.\n\nThis bottleneck of cumulative memory debt is artificially approached as whilst the application is offline GC'ing, the underlying OS will continue to buffer incoming page requests via the OS level socket.\n\nBy having a serial collector it is making a bad situation worse, as users will typically hammer the installation when responsiveness suffers beyond a certain tolerance threshold, spawning new requests for the already overloaded installation to process.\n\nThe syntax to include in JAVA_OPTS is {{+XX:+UseParallelOldGC}}\nDon't be confused with {{+XX:+UseParallelGC}}, which is just an explicit setting of the default serial collector for tenured.\n\nWe've already migrated some of the largest confluence installations via support tickets with excellent results; it would be beneficial for smaller instances to have that extra resiliency and agility during aggressively loaded circumstances.

The idea is that editor or an approver adds a my:somelabel for an entire user group to a page/blogpost and each user in that group can then remove it at his or her convenience.\n\nIt would be possible to use contentbylabel to display a list of pages or news items so that each user can then remove the label from the item to remove it from the listing he or she sees (mark it as read, if you will). To simplify matters, some sort of remove-label:my:somelabel -macro could be included in the item content for one click removal. ",
