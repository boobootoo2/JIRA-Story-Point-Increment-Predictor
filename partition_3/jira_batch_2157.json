Atlassian Connect 1.0 [was released in March 2014|http://blogs.atlassian.com/2014/03/introducing-atlassian-connect-1-0/], and you can already get access to [more than 50 public add-ons today built using the platform|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/search?application=&category=&cost=&hosting=cloud&marketingLabel=].\n \nDue to stability and scalability reasons, we will not bundle additional third party add-ons with our Cloud offerings. But you should feel free to contact the vendors of your favourite add-ons to let them know that you would like them to create a Cloud version of the add-on! We will do our best to work together with the vendor to satisfy this request.\n \nSince we have no plans to bundle additional add-ons in Cloud, we are closing this issue.\n \nCheers,\nBartek\nJIRA Product Management\nbartek (at) atlassian (dot) com\n{panel}\n \n \n*Original request description:*\nPlease bundle [Flowdock for Confluence|https://plugins.atlassian.com/plugin/details/37109] plugin.",

Confluence OnDemand uses this configuration.\n# Users sometimes cannot load remotely hosted content, either in the editor or when viewing pages. Affected content can include (but is not limited to) Skitch or OpenPhoto embedded images, gadgets or CloudApp shared files.\n# Remote services are available.\n# Confluence logs contain warning messages from org.apache.commons.httpclient.SimpleHttpConnectionManager \n{noformat}\nSimpleHttpConnectionManager being used incorrectly.  Be sure that HttpMethod.releaseConnection() is always called and that only one thread and/or method is using this connection manager at a time.\n{noformat}\n\nh3. Details\n\nHttpClient requires that its HttpMethod.releaseConnection method is called for it to fully release the underlying resources and allow configuring correct proxy settings for the connection. When the caller fails to call this method, the message above is logged by org.apache.commons.httpclient.SimpleHttpConnectionManager at the WARN level.\n\nConfluence wraps this in a HttpResponse.finish method, but this is only ever called in the BaseHttpRetrievalMacro. Every other use of HttpResponse in Confluence (core or bundled plugin) needs to release its connection correctly too.\n\nh3. Workaround\n\nA possible workaround for this issue is to use the same proxy settings for all remote connections, and to ensure that the proxy can reach all required hosts.",

Suppose that the first image is called foo.png and the second is called bar.png.\n\nIn a subsequent edit, we have a new version of bar.png.  Unfortunately, the tool that creates our images uses the filename \"foo.png\" by default when exporting the image.  So, if our designer drags the new \"foo.png\" file over to the Confluence page -- even if \"on top\" of the bar.png location it is meant to replace, the following now happens:\n\n# In preview mode, the display is deceiving -- I see the new version of the image appear and the older images are still there.  So I see (old) foo.png (new) foo.png and bar.png.\n# Upon saving the page, however, the following happens:\n## I keep two copies of foo.png on the page, both now the new image.\n## Even though I \"dragged\" over the image location of bar.png, that image is unaffected (because the filenames are totally different)\n\nI have read about Confluence's image attachment behavior and the versioning that occurs with similar filenames.  However, the fact that preview mode is not WYSIWYG is extremely confusing.  FWIW, Google Docs (which I am competing against internally as part of a conversion over to using Confluence) doesn't behave this way.  Specifically Google's word processor gives each image a unique name so that WYSIWYG always applies.\n\nIs there some way to make Confluence behave more like Google's word processor, even if globally across the site?  I am trying to prevent folks from migrating back to Google (there is talk of doing so based upon this confusion).\n",

Set up an instance with a different home directory (this is so that the backup path will differ from the export)\n3. Check the backup path of your instance on the Backup Administration screen ({{/admin/dailybackupadmin.action}})\n4. Now import the backup you created in step 1\n5. Check the backup path of your instance on the Backup Administration screen - (!) it still shows what it did in step 3\n6. Perform another site backup, with the option to archive a copy of the backup checked\n7. You'll see that the temporary backup is created where you would expect (in the location that matches the backup path you saw in steps 3 and 5), (!) but the archived backup is created in the home directory that was specified in the instance you imported from\n\nIn cases where that location doesn't exist anymore, a stacktrace will appear instead:\n{code}\njava.io.IOException: No such file or directory\n\tat java.io.UnixFileSystem.createFileExclusively(Native Method)\n\tat java.io.File.createNewFile(File.java:883)\n\tat com.atlassian.core.util.FileUtils.copyFile(FileUtils.java:465)\n\tat com.atlassian.core.util.FileUtils.copyFile(FileUtils.java:401)\n{code}\n\nSee attached files for full stack trace.\n\nI think the desired behaviour in this case is that the existing backup path of the instance is used, instead of the path from the import. This will ensure that the location always exists (since the home directory of this instance has to!).\n\nh2. Workaround\n\nOn the Backup Administration screen, click to edit the backup settings. You won't be able to change the backup path, but once you submit the form Confluence will go back to using the backup path that's specified on this screen.",

You can also upload attachments through this macro, however when doing this with larger files, you get the message \"could not upload the file to confluence, the server may be unavailable\". This goes for OnDemand, I have not been able to reproduce it on download. I think it simply times out causing larger file sizes to produce this message. When testing this surfaced with files between 25 and 30 MB, I do not think this is extremely relevant, since it can also be related to upload speed.\n\nFiles can get uploaded to the instance as normally through the attachment macro without limitation in size (other than the instance set max)\n\nh2. Workaround\n\n* Use the drag-and-drop feature to upload the image. This is uploaded using a different mechanism and doesn't seem to be subject to the same timeout.\n* Go to \"Tools\" -> \"Attachments\" and upload the image there.

I have 4 Permissions Schemes (15 Projects each). When I create a new project I assign a permission scheme to it. But for Confluence Space I need to do it separately (add corresponding 3-4 groups, check ~40 check-boxes). \nAnother example:\nIf I decide to add some group to Permission scheme then I need to go and modify permissions at all Confluence Spaces - which is headache.\n\nThanks.",

I tried to do that today and found out the hard way that WAV wasn't supported.  I then tried to find converters and man, was that not easy.  For some reason the 3 converters I used didn't convert properly and/or created bigger files that then Confluence wouldn't place anyway.\n\nI spent a long time trying to get it to work.  \n\nIf you guys supported the format, then the drap and drop would have been it and I could have shared the confluence page and moved on.\n",

Providing this feature would not be used by everyone, but would sure increase the personal appeal of the wiki. Would increase the bond people feel toward the tool. \n\nYes, it's possible to pull in my Twitter feed. Yes, there is ONE (!) plugin -- but it forces me to send all blog posts to a single queue that must be manually distributed. (Unless I misunderstand how it works.)\n\nThe current means of blogging IMHO are just enough steps to squash the average user's desire to share something in the blog. (I'm talking 4.1, maybe a miracle has happened in 5.)\n\nCan someone please correct me? I'm really hoping blogging has gotten easier. Or there is a plugin I've missed. Would love to hear what you've found, done, tried, experienced. \n\nThanks, \nJohn\n",

In Confluence, this delegates to the Ehcache implementation in a non-clustered environment, defaulting to \n\n{code}\n    <defaultCache\n        maxElementsInMemory=\"1000\"\n        eternal=\"false\"\n        timeToIdleSeconds=\"3600\"\n        timeToLiveSeconds=\"0\"\n        overflowToDisk=\"false\"\n        />\n{code}\n\nThe _maxElementsInMemory_ configuration is currently adjustable for Confluence via the _com.atlassian.confluence.cache.CacheConfigManager_ service. This service is not exposed to the plugin container, so you'd have to retrieve the instance from the host context via ComponentLocator or some other hacks.\n\nSince enforcing an object count as a quota burdens the client with ensuring that their serialised objects are roughly of the same size in order to calculate a sensible count, I'd suggest spiking an upgrade to Ehcache 2.5 or above (Confluence 5.1 currently uses the 1.6.0-atlassian-4 fork).\n\n{quote}\nThe major new capability of Ehcache 2.5 is enhanced cache resource management, specifically the ability to set the maximum size in bytes of a Cache or CacheManager.\n{quote}\n\nThis would allow the configuration of a _[maxBytesLocalHeap|http://ehcache.org/documentation/configuration/cache-size#explicitly-sizing-caches]_ attribute for a specific cache, allowing an (approximated) size in byte quota to be enforced. This setting is much more sensible for (plugin) developers, as the serialised objects normally heavily vary in their size. E.g. Team Calendars caches the net.fortuna.ical4j.model.Calendar object, the size of it depends on the events being attached to this calendar.\n\nSetting this attribute should be exposed to the plugin system for Confluence, e.g. by modifying the CacheConfigManager and making it _plugin:available=\"true\"_. Please ensure that the necessary documentation on DAC is updated, e.g. [Confluence Caching Architecture|https://developer.atlassian.com/display/CONFDEV/Confluence+Caching+Architecture].\n",

Do we really need to ask for stuff every 20 seconds?\n* Make sure we only poll when it makes sense: user/tab active, logged in users vs anonymous users, page new or active vs old pages that are not modified...\n* Back off polling more aggressively according to response time or stop polling if error response received (this would avoid overloading slow servers even more)\n* Ideally we would have a single polling thread (or even websocket) that can be shared between plugins",

Every time I upgrade my system I take 25 minutes instead of 2, this is because I have to stop the confluence instance again after upgrade and redo every custom configuration.\nThe most annoying thing a have to do (so annoying that I keep my instance out of date and wait some updates until the upgrade worthwhile) is:\n1. Stop confluence. Again (this take time on my system)\n2. Move (don't copy) activation-1.0.2.jar and mail-1.4.1.jar from <confluence-install>/confluence/WEB-INF/lib to <confluence-install>/lib.\n(Are you seriously? Why a have to do that? And why the confluence package don't do that by default? Some freak bug like some microsoft products? Just kidding )\n3. I'm smart so I don't type again the configuration on server.xml, I make a copy, but I cannot ensure that my copy just change the lines for mail config and  I have to make a diff on the command line to be sure that I will not break the system and have to stop confluence again.\n\nNot least but important too. I have to take care of the security of that file, if someone read that content my account is compromised. Well my system is secured and only root has access but who knows, and what about shared servers that others can be using, like universities?\n\nJira have a configuration for SMTP SSL email, and this is not broken between upgrades because is in the database.\n\n\nThis is easy to implement in spring config. So be nice with me and other sys devs. :-) \n\nBy the way, I have other configurations like SSO with Crowd. Is tedius too, every config that depends on files and cannot be automatic created by confluence (and jira, and stash, and crowd) is tedius to maintain between upgrades. \n\nKeep all on database and make the upgrade a easy, funny and routine part of your products :P",
