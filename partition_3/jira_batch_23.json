These external tools need\u00a0the absolute path of the files I want to compare/merge.\r\n\r\nBut somehow, I think the arguments I use ($PWD $BASE $REMOTE $LOCAL $MERGED) doesn't output correct absolute path to my external tools. They just output relative path.\r\n\r\nI remember at previous version(maybe at 1.x.x.x), these work fine. I've launch external tools perfectly before.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPlease help, thanks!",
