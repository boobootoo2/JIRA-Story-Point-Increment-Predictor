Atlassian Connect 1.0 [was released in March 2014|http://blogs.atlassian.com/2014/03/introducing-atlassian-connect-1-0/], and you can already get access to [more than 50 public add-ons today built using the platform|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/search?application=&category=&cost=&hosting=cloud&marketingLabel=].\r\n \r\nDue to stability and scalability reasons, we will not bundle additional third party add-ons with our Cloud offerings. But you should feel free to contact the vendors of your favourite add-ons to let them know that you would like them to create a Cloud version of the add-on! We will do our best to work together with the vendor to satisfy this request.\r\n \r\nSince we have no plans to bundle additional add-ons in Cloud, we are closing this issue.\r\n \r\nCheers,\r\nBartek\r\nJIRA Product Management\r\nbartek (at) atlassian (dot) com\r\n{panel}\r\n \r\n \r\n*Original request description:*\r\nWe'd like our plugin added to OnDemand\r\nhttps://plugins.atlassian.com/plugin/details/23109",

Atlassian Connect 1.0 [was released in March 2014|http://blogs.atlassian.com/2014/03/introducing-atlassian-connect-1-0/], and you can already get access to [more than 50 public add-ons today built using the platform|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/search?application=&category=&cost=&hosting=cloud&marketingLabel=].\r\n \r\nDue to stability and scalability reasons, we will not bundle additional third party add-ons with our Cloud offerings. But you should feel free to contact the vendors of your favourite add-ons to let them know that you would like them to create a Cloud version of the add-on! We will do our best to work together with the vendor to satisfy this request.\r\n \r\nSince we have no plans to bundle additional add-ons in Cloud, we are closing this issue.\r\n \r\nCheers,\r\nBartek\r\nJIRA Product Management\r\nbartek (at) atlassian (dot) com\r\n{panel}\r\n \r\n \r\n*Original request description:*\r\nRequesting to bundle Field Security Plugin into JIRA Studio.\r\n* https://plugins.atlassian.com/plugin/details/23216",

      "description": "The first thing happening once you click import is that a GET request to /rest/studio/svnimport/1.0/importer/unknownusers is issued. This unzips the file, pipes it through grep and checks if the svn authors are also studio users. The response contains an array of svn authors not being studio users. The svnimport.checkUnknownUsers in the svnimport.js issued that request, and it will call svnimport.doImportFile(fileName) on success (which will issue the POST request which triggers the import). \n\nThe problem with large files is that this call can lead to a client-side timeout, in which case the \n\n{code}\n            error: function(xhr, status, error) {\n\n                svnimport.glass(false, null);\n\n                svnimport.showErrorBox(svnimport.getXhrErrorResponse(xhr), function() {\n                    svnimport.initialGetStatus();\n                });\n            }\n{code}\n\nin line 267-274 (rev. 116923) of the svnimport.js gets called. The error variable is just \"timeout\", the actual error box will contain no message. The error box is shown in FF but not in Chrome. \n\nA rather crappy fix would be to just increase the [timeout|http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/], my suggestion would be to directly return and query periodically for the result like it is done with the actual import. \n\nThis bug can be worked around by just issueing the POST manually (e.g. with Poster on FF), which would be sth. like <myjira>/rest/studio/svnimport/1.0/importer?file=<myimportfile>. Then you would just refresh <myjira>/secure/admin/SvnImporter.jspa page and overview the import.\n",

      "description": "When we disable an app, the process of that app continues to run - we just block customer access to it. This implies that any background tasks scheduled by the app's process will continue to run. Consequently, repository polling, build kick-offs (including spinning up EC2 workloads), notification emails and more will continue to trigger after the app is disabled. We need to ensure this does not happen (or at least, not in any visible way).\n\n\nPossible approaches (imho in order of preference):\n- Option 1: if the app's scheduled tasks are all controlled by a single scheduler (e.g. Quartz), disable/enable the entire scheduler as the app is disabled/enabled.\n- Option 2: target and disable specific behaviour, e.g. nuke the EC2 key, fudge the mailserver config etc... when an app is disabled, and restore them when the apps are re-enabled.\n- Option 3: most obvious solution is to shutdown the process of disabled apps. However, throughout development we have often assumed that the processes of disabled apps would continue running. This would be a major architectural change.\n\n",

Atlassian Connect 1.0 [was released in March 2014|http://blogs.atlassian.com/2014/03/introducing-atlassian-connect-1-0/], and you can already get access to [more than 50 public add-ons today built using the platform|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/search?application=&category=&cost=&hosting=cloud&marketingLabel=].\r\n \r\nDue to stability and scalability reasons, we will not bundle additional third party add-ons with our Cloud offerings. But you should feel free to contact the vendors of your favourite add-ons to let them know that you would like them to create a Cloud version of the add-on! We will do our best to work together with the vendor to satisfy this request.\r\n \r\nSince we have no plans to bundle additional add-ons in Cloud, we are closing this issue.\r\n \r\nCheers,\r\nBartek\r\nJIRA Product Management\r\nbartek (at) atlassian (dot) com\r\n{panel}\r\n \r\n \r\n*Original request description:*\r\nWould it be possible to bundle Feywa - JIRA Resource Availability and Utilization Tracking plugin?\r\n\r\nhttps://plugins.atlassian.com/plugin/details/25329",

      "description": "The inclusion of two different user types (Developer and Collaborator) is great and much appreciated. These two users cover most use cases that require some interactivity with the project(s). The ability to open up some or all aspects of a Studio project to anonymous users for read-only access also covers use cases on the opposite extreme. However, there is a need for a type of user not covered by the existing ones available. JIRA can serve as an excellent community feedback and customer support tool (as Atlassian uses it on this very site), especially because the customer support functionality is in the exact same system as the development tools. Unfortunatly, the current licensing scheme for Studio prohibts using it in this way. What is needed is a user type with the following preset or maximum permission level:\n- Create their own accounts / public signup\n- Create new issues in JIRA\n- Submit comments to issues in JIRA\n- Watch issues in JIRA\n- Vote on issues in JIRA\n- Create comments in Confluence (not strictly necessary, but it would be nice)\n\nBecause this type of user contributes a small amount of content but the number of them can grow exponentially, it would be nice if they were included with all plans in unlimited quantities as an added feature. This shouldn't detract from organizations licensing the other two user types because this new user type is so focused on the outside customer support aspect. Because single licenses for Developer or Contributor users are relativly expensive when considered for use this way, most orgainizations probably just fulfil this use case currently by going to a different system. Alternativly, perhaps access to this functionality and type of user could be licensed on an all-or-nothing basis - I.e., pay and extra $X/month to add unlimited reporters.",

The need there was to replace the com.atlassian.studio.host.common.ThemeProperties.isBambooEnabled() checks with calls to com.atlassian.studio.common.appstatus.AppStatusService.isAppEnabled(Application). In Crowd, the only usage of that flag is in the configuration of the notifier plugin in com.atlassian.studio.crowd.lifecycle.StudioNotificationSubscriber.getStudioSubcriptions(). The AppStatusService is part of the studio-common-components-plugin, which is not being deployed to Crowd since it does not have AppLinks. Even though the configuration of the notifier plugin might not be justification enough to make the AppStatusService work in Crowd, we ultimately need it e.g. for blocking SVN if FeCru is deactivated. If it's not possible to make studio-common-components-plugin work in Crowd, we should split out the needed appstatus functionality into its own bundle.",
