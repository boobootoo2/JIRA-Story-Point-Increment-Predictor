All the <confluence-install> and <confluence-home> directory, by default, would be located under {{C:\\Program Files\\Atlassian}} which is normally a restricted directory in recent Windows (ie. Windows Server 2008). Hence it'd be nice if there is a clear indication which directory and which permission needs to be given to the which user. This would avoid any confusion for new users, especially this is related to security issue. We actually do have [this page|http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Creating+a+Dedicated+User+Account+on+the+Operating+System+to+Run+Confluence], specifies which directory needs to be given write permission. I think we can add some examples of the location for the Windows user to know which is which should be given - eg. some users doesn't know where are their Confluence Home Directory after installing using the installer wizard.\n\nPurpose here is to avoid confusion for new end-users in setting up Confluence since a mistake in this part would fail the installation completely.\n\nMuch thanks,\nHusein",

He referred to this page : http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/CONF35/Confluence+3.5.13+Upgrade+Notes\n\nFrom there, he probably clicked on the \"Upgrade Guide\" link and got sent to here : http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Upgrading+Confluence, which is actually the documentation on how to upgrade Confluence to version 4.0. So he got confused, and is currently asking for a '.bin' file that will let him upgrade to Confluence 3.5.\n\nSo, I hope that the documentation can point to the link that will lead the user to the Upgrade Guide for that particular version, and not the Upgrade Guide for the newest version available.",

There are a number of reasons we made the change from wiki markup to an XHTML-based editor - You can read a complete explanation CEOs on [this page|http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Confluence+4.0+Editor+-+Customer+Feedback].\n\nWe acknowledge that some users need access to the source for various reasons...content portability, fixing formatting errors, personal preference, etc. So we've developed a free Source Editor plugin which can be found on the [Atlassian Marketplace|https://plugins.atlassian.com/plugins/com.atlassian.confluence.plugins.editor.confluence-source-editor]\n\nThe source format is not Confluence's old, proprietary wiki markup but rather adheres to basic XHTML markup plus some extra models for defining Confluence-specific objects like macros, links, and images. So if you know basic HTML, the format should be familiar to you. You can read about the format [here|http://confluence.atlassian.com/x/twRnE].\n\nBill Arconati\n{panel}",

I seem to have to go through a form in order to insert a link to a wiki page. (My typical case is that I first add the link and then click it to craete the page)\n* I'd like the \"insert jira issue\" function to also popup in the autocomplete when I start with {jira, which now only shows the JIRA Issues and JIRA Portlet macro. (I know there is a keyboard shortcut, but still it feels inconsistent)\n* I'd like a way to quickly \"copy/paste\" certain markup. E.g. I used to create one jira issue link and then copy/paste that, changing the number, instead of going through the \"insert jira issue\" form. This new insert approach is much slower.\n* I'd like that the removal of text blocks like a note is more \"seamless\". E.g. When I am after a note section and press backspace, it actually stops. (Although I must admit that sometimes I seem to end up inside the note area). So I often have the feeling that I have to do some selection trick or grab my mouse in order to delete a text block, like a note.\n\nWhile I am impressed by the features of the new editor I can't help feel that my productivity is severely impaired by having many simple things now awkwardly hard and requiring \"forms\". \n",

In Confluence 3.5 we only displayed \"foo\" which is a lot nicer. \n\nThis was raised as regression in some of our documentation pages. \n\n!Anchorlinks-busted.PNG!\n\n----\n\nThe second part of this issue is to make anchor links relative again in Confluence 4.0+, which isn't the case in the initial Confluence 4.0 release.\n\nIn other words, if a link leads to a target location on the same page (e.g. an anchor link), then in the XHTML storage format, don't store the page reference in the link itself. This was how Confluence 3.5 effectively used to work (in part because its content was stored in 'less sophisticated' wiki markup). However, since all links were treated as absolute links in the initial release of Confluence 4.0, this was causing all sorts of problems like:\n\n* Displaying the page name and # character for relative anchor links\n* https://studio.plugins.atlassian.com/browse/CPSP-45\n\n(/) For an initial discussion on how Confluence 4.0 should handle anchor links 'relatively', see [this comment on CPSP-45|https://studio.plugins.atlassian.com/browse/CPSP-45?focusedCommentId=49069&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-49069]\n",

Steps to Reproduce\n# Create a PowerPoint file in Office 2007. Add a slide with text, a slide with a chart, a slide with SmartArt, and a Slide with an image. Save as PPTX\n# Upload to a Confluence Page and insert an Office Connector\n# Slides with Charts and SmartArt appear blank. Other slides with images/text look fine.\n\nThis is consistently repeatable, even when using other people's PPTX files.\n\nI have inserted the Test.pptx (fails), Test.ppt (works), and a screenshot of how they appear on the page when viewing the same slide (PPTX on top, PPT below that).\n\nI believe this is an extremely important bug to fix, as otherwise it severely limits the viability of using the Office Connector to view PowerPoint files as time goes on.\n\nh3. Workaround\n# Open the PPTX in PowerPoint and save as a Office 2003-2007 PPT\n# Upload to a Confluence Page and insert an Office Connector\n# Slides with Charts and SmartArt display correctly (as do all other slides)\n\nNB: The workaround may not work in all cases, we have examples of files that are saved as PPT that also display the problem. In that case, some alternatives are:\n* Save the file as a PDF instead\n* Take a screenshot of how the image looks when displayed in Powerpoint directly, and insert that as an image instead of the Chart or SmartArt.\n\n\n*Example of exception thrown:*{noformat}\n2012-05-29 17:47:16,521 ERROR [DefaultSlideCacheManager:thread-5] [com.benryan.conversion.AbstractSlideConversionTask] call problem while converting ???????_?????_?????_???????_????_new.pptx\n -- url: /plugins/servlet/pptslide | userName: admin\njava.lang.NullPointerException\n\tat com.benryan.pptx.record.AbstractSingleShape.getPredefinedShape(AbstractSingleShape.java:169)\n\tat com.benryan.escher.EscherRenderer.renderAutoshape(EscherRenderer.java:565)\n\tat com.benryan.escher.EscherRenderer.walkShapes(EscherRenderer.java:233)\n\tat com.benryan.ppt.PptRenderer.render(PptRenderer.java:128)\n\tat com.benryan.conversion.PPtDocumentConversionTask.convertFile(PPtDocumentConversionTask.java:54)\n...\n{noformat}",

In many cases the transformer will not actually have any transforming to do, but it still needs to parse the entire page content from the {{Reader}} and return it as a {{String}}.\n\nThis could be improved by providing a way for the transformer to tell the calling code if it should be run. This will prevent the entire page content needing to be parsed one more time if the conditions for running can be determined before hand from the context.  This could be done through a new interface method, or by adding condition parameters to the module config (like web-ui items).",
