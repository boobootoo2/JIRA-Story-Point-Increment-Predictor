It\u2019s quite tedious.\n\nWhat would be far preferable is the ability to set a per directory &#x27;history count&#x27;, so that we only store 2 previous versions for asset directories. Or to allow us to the history from selected directories in place from the website. Anything but having to migrate to a new repo when we hit the limit.\n\nWe love Mercurial - it\u2019s perfect for us for everything except this issue.   I guess the alternative would be that we move to git + gitlfs, but we\u2019re not in a good place to do that with our current project.\n\ncheers,\n\nRicky",

There are two things that make it sometimes inconvenient to understand.\n\nFirst, it would be nice to have the master branch handles specially, perhaps by always having the same distinctive style, like being black or bolder than other lines, and also maybe always on the left-most side, so that it is easy to see where it is, and when others are branched off. Right now, a branch will just extend from master in the same column with a similar color, making it hard to see at a glance that it is a branch.\n\nSecond, it would be nice to have the option to compress the commits, and see only branches. Basically all branches with more than one commit appear as only a single node. Maybe this belongs in the branches view, but it would be nice anywhere.\n\nThanks",

Maybe could get round this issue with this (no directory is specified);\n\n{code}\ndefinitions:\n  caches:\n    node: \n      invalidated-by: package-lock.json\n{code}\n\n*Option 2: Create a new configuration page in the web interface*\n\n!1026256818-Untitled.png|thumbnail!\\\\\nThe contents of the page would be a form-based version of the settings proposed in Option 1 above. This option would perhaps make it easier to manage the contrasts between pre-defined caches and custom caches.\n\nI think I\u2019d prefer option 1 but without knowing more about the underlying architecture of Pipelines I can&#x27;t know if either option is significant harder to implement.\n\nCheers.",

However, there is no way to indicate to Bitbucket that this deployment is no longer deployed.\n\nOur use case if for testing the set up of a kubernetes cluster. We have everything fully defined in a repo, we test it and then we want to undeploy the cluster once we are done testing it, since there is a cost to continue running it.\n\nThere are a number of ways to support that.  Once might be to use a minus at the end of the deployment name like:\n\n{{deployment: test-}}\n\nOr perhaps support something more obvious.  Lots of ways to do it in the yaml.",

Getting the pull requests associated with this part of the file would be ideal, but an easier solution would be to simply be able to see all the pull requests associated with the file (including pull request created date, title, and associated feature branch name).
