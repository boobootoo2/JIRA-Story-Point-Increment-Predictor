I can then easily create child pages and understand their visibility. I want to put \"everything\" I do in Confluence, and having this personal scratchpad and knowing the visibility explicitly makes this easier.\n\nOne idea is to create these parent pages by default in new personal spaces such that a user could easily create things for themselves without having to change permissions on all the pages every time. \n\nIt is also a concept that is very familiar (dropbox creates these by default for you). Given that users often struggle with what to do with their personal space, this could add a small improvement to the \"blank personal space\" problem.",

It really gets close to be a complete project management tool for us. But a way to log time and track it through charts and graphs would be great addition. \n\nLet me give some insight into how we are using it. We are a software development company, so the way we use JIRA and Confluence is much like you, I would imagine. Our developers use JIRA primarily to track their tasks and report time, etc. \n\nHowever, the non-tech side of our company (PR, Marketing, Client Services, Administrative) is currently trying to use JIRA for time tracking as well. With the new updates to Confluence, we can really move a lot of our processes (project tasks, collaboration) to Confluence, but we're still having to go to JIRA to log time and our directors have to go there to track their teams' time. \n\nAre their plans to allow time tracking and reporting capabilities in Confluence, making it a project \"management\" suite like Basecamp instead of just a collaboration tool? And if so, when?\n\nThanks a lot",

The result of this is:\n\n# If you go to the linked page's info, that link is not listed as incoming\n# If the page linked is ever renamed, then that link will not be automatically changed to the new location\n\nThis also happens if you are copying and pasting images that are stored as attachments in Confluence. In [our documentation|https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/OganDg], it's mentioned that you can drag and drop images into the editor, which is the same as copy and paste.\n\nh4. Steps to Reproduce\n\n# Follow the steps [here|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Linking+to+Pages#LinkingtoPages-Copyingandpastingalinkfromyourwebbrowser] to copy and paste a link into a page\n# Click on the link, and then click Edit, to find that it's a web URL link\n\nh4.

Now if a plugin uses one of our concrete \"API\" classes, e.g. com.atlassian.confluence.content.render.xhtml.XmlOutputFactoryFactoryBean (l.35) or com.atlassian.confluence.content.render.xhtml.DefaultXmlEventReaderFactory (l.142) during one of the runtime module descriptors, e.g. RestModuleDescriptor, the DelegatingPluginFilter will set the CCL to the bundle's CL. Now if the bundle embeds a StAX factory implementation by accident or on purpose, that is bound to fail.\n\nImo we should identify all of those invocations in our core classes, and enfore the context CL to be set to the webapp CL. In most cases (those where you know that your class is defined by the webapp CL) you can use the current CL. E.g. com.atlassian.confluence.content.render.xhtml.XmlOutputFactoryFactoryBean.getObject()\n\n{code}\n            xmlOutputFactory = new ConfluenceXmlOutputFactory(ContextClassLoaderSwitchingUtil.runInContext(this.getClass().getClassLoader(), new Callable<XMLOutputFactory>()\n            {\n                @Override\n                public XMLOutputFactory call() throws Exception\n                {\n                    return XMLOutputFactory.newInstance();\n                }\n            }));\n{code}\n\nNow we can choose two paths here, one is a contract change where we say we use the webapp CL by default and provide overloaded constructors/methods allowing the parametrisation of a ClassLoader used for discovery, or we deprecate each of these constructors/methods and update all over our clients to parametrise the webapp CL (thus not breaking the current \"contract\").\n\n\n",

Here is how to reproduce the issue.\n\n# Create a plugin and a component in tha plugin. \n# Create a webwork action.\n# Attempt to setter inject the component into the webwork action.\n# Attempt to run something that is not the execute() method and see that the component does not get injected and the variable is null instead.\n\nIf you need an example plugin you can use the [Confluence Enterprise Hosted Migrator|https://bitbucket.org/vchoy/jira-migrator] and use the confluence-migrator branch.\n\nThe core problem seems to be that the autowiring is failing for the Webwork action for certain methods. I am not certain why. I enlisted [~fakraemer]'s help on this issue and he said \"i can see the correct config being registered in com.atlassian.confluence.plugin.descriptor.XWorkModuleDescriptor.addAction(Element, PackageConfig) but for some reason it's not loaded when the action is created\". Which we both think is likely to be a bug.\n\nIn short, this issue makes everything that is not the execute() action unuseable for standard development.\n\nI have attatched two images of me performing a single step in the debugger if you need proof that the autowiring is not being run and there is a problem.",

For large directories this sync (especially a full sync) puts heavy load on the confluence system for quite a long period of time and slows down the confluence instance significantly. I want to be in control of when this sync is happening and prevent it from falling into the main working hours. This is impossible with just the interval, as every unexpected system restart shifts the synchronisation start time.\n\nJira seems to already have such a feature implemented, so it can't be too difficult to move it to Confluence as well.",

A combination of this, clustering, the session not being read-only, and potentially some db latency cause a large series of jdbc commits which cause the delay. The fix is to wrap the code in the transaction wrapper, which stops the multiple commits.\n\nh3. Patch\nThere is a patch available for Confluence 4.2.13. If you are unable to upgrade to 4.3.6 and you are on 4.2.13, you can apply this patch. Please do not apply it to any other versions however.\n\n# Try this in a test system first to ensure it resolves your problem and does not cause any unforseen changes.\n# Download the two attached files. \n# Remove the \"-4.2.13\" from the class files before copying them to the directory.\n# Follow the [patch installation instructions|http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Installing+Patched+Class+Files]\n# The subdirectory for the class files is {{<confluence-installation-directory>/confluence/WEB-INF/classes/com/atlassian/confluence/util/profiling}}.
