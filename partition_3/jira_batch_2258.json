In our case, we can have a parent with 20-30 subtasks because each customer project implementation is the parent and the subtasks are the individual tasks.  We use this option because it is much quicker to set up a new customer project.  Linking creates duplicate copies of a golden customer implementation issue then you have to delete all the duplicates; using subtasks doesn't do this and it minimizes the need for us to remember and create all of the basic tasks.\n\n\n",

Atlassian Connect 1.0 [was released in March 2014|http://blogs.atlassian.com/2014/03/introducing-atlassian-connect-1-0/], and you can already get access to [more than 50 public add-ons today built using the platform|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/search?application=&category=&cost=&hosting=cloud&marketingLabel=].\r\n \r\nDue to stability and scalability reasons, we will not bundle additional third party add-ons with our Cloud offerings. But you should feel free to contact the vendors of your favourite add-ons to let them know that you would like them to create a Cloud version of the add-on! We will do our best to work together with the vendor to satisfy this request.\r\n \r\nSince we have no plans to bundle additional add-ons in Cloud, we are closing this issue.\r\n \r\nCheers,\r\nBartek\r\nJIRA Product Management\r\nbartek (at) atlassian (dot) com\r\n{panel}\r\n \r\n \r\n*Original request description:*\r\nAs an entrepreneur I would like to use the Zen Foundation Plugin so that I can leverage our Atlassian OnDemand instance and do not have to buy yet another Web-Content-Management-System (web-CMS). \r\n\r\nMoving to a download version is not an option as I do not want to create IT overhead but keep things simple. \r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n* https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.zenfoundation \r\n* https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/AOD/Atlassian+OnDemand+Plugin+Policy\r\n* https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/78924/please-how-can-i-install-zen-foundation-in-on-demand-version\r\n* http://blogs.atlassian.com/2010/02/make_your_confluence_wiki_public/#comment-73048",

Atlassian Connect 1.0 [was released in March 2014|http://blogs.atlassian.com/2014/03/introducing-atlassian-connect-1-0/], and you can already get access to [more than 50 public add-ons today built using the platform|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/search?application=&category=&cost=&hosting=cloud&marketingLabel=].\r\n \r\nDue to stability and scalability reasons, we will not bundle additional third party add-ons with our Cloud offerings. But you should feel free to contact the vendors of your favourite add-ons to let them know that you would like them to create a Cloud version of the add-on! We will do our best to work together with the vendor to satisfy this request.\r\n \r\nSince we have no plans to bundle additional add-ons in Cloud, we are closing this issue.\r\n \r\nCheers,\r\nBartek\r\nJIRA Product Management\r\nbartek (at) atlassian (dot) com\r\n{panel}\r\n \r\n \r\n*Original request description:*\r\nPlease bundle issue to issue copy plugin for OnDemand\r\nhttps://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.atlassian.cpji.cpji-jira-plugin",

Atlassian Connect 1.0 [was released in March 2014|http://blogs.atlassian.com/2014/03/introducing-atlassian-connect-1-0/], and you can already get access to [more than 50 public add-ons today built using the platform|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/search?application=&category=&cost=&hosting=cloud&marketingLabel=].\r\n \r\nDue to stability and scalability reasons, we will not bundle additional third party add-ons with our Cloud offerings. But you should feel free to contact the vendors of your favourite add-ons to let them know that you would like them to create a Cloud version of the add-on! We will do our best to work together with the vendor to satisfy this request.\r\n \r\nSince we have no plans to bundle additional add-ons in Cloud, we are closing this issue.\r\n \r\nCheers,\r\nBartek\r\nJIRA Product Management\r\nbartek (at) atlassian (dot) com\r\n{panel}\r\n \r\n \r\n*Original request description:*\r\nWe have been using TeamCity for continuous integration within one of our projects for some time. Having brought version control and issue management into Atlassian / JIRA it is now critical that we continue and integrate TeamCity capability for this solution.\r\n\r\nPlease can I request that we have JIRA TeamCity available as a plugin for OnDemand / Studio as a matter of urgency.\r\n\r\n ",
