Problem Definition\nCurrently the only way to tie JIRA issues together with Team Calendars is to add specific JIRA event types (JIRA Issue Dates, JIRA Agile Sprints, JIRA Project Releases). In the event you simply want to be able to reference a JIRA link in a standard Team Calendar, these types just don't work. Currently you would have to login to JIRA, find the issue, copy the link, paste into the related page field for a Team Calendars event. However this just shows a link to click to take you to the issue in JIRA.\n\nh4. Suggested Solution\nOffer something similar to the JIRA Issues Macro, where if an application link is setup for JIRA there is a new field in issues to search the JIRA instance. For example, if I wanted to find TEST-10999 I could enter that into the field, it would pop down, I would click that and save the event.\n\nFurther, once the saved event is clicked on it will show the JIRA issue similarly to how the JIRA Issue Macro displays a single issue.",

Summary\nUsers who attempt to open a Confluence Page displaying multiple Calendar Macros with many Calendars experience Local Browser crashes which indicate \"high memory usage detected\"\n\nh3. Environment\n* Confluence 6.0.0-OD-2015.50.1-0003 with Team Calendars 5.3.8-D20151021T015515  \n* Browsers:\n** Firefox 42\n** Chrome 46\n\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\n# Create a Confluence Page and embed multiple (3) a Calendar Macros which contain multiple Calendars (30+) (Calendars range from 1-10+ Event Types)\n\nh3. Expected Results\nPage loads and does not consume 2+ GB of Local Resources for displaying this page in the browser\n\nh3. Actual Results\nBrowser throws an error indicating \"high memory usage detected 2GB\"\nServer utilization is low and Confluence logs do not indicate an issue\n \nh3. Notes\nWith 3 Calendar Macros with ~30 Calendars each, Browser Memory utilization ranges 1.5 GB - 3 GB in both Firefox and Chrome\nRemoving 2 of the 3 Macros does improve memory utilization to about 400 MB - 1 GB when loaded\nSystems with greater resources may not experience this issue as a lower resourced machine\n\nh3.Workaround\nReduce the number of Calendar Macros, Calendars, and Event Types displayed",

Problem Definition\nUsers would like to insert a calendar macro in Confluence which dynamically changes to the current user's personal calendar. If you attempt to insert the link ~/calendar/mycalendar.action, it will only display as a link to the calendar, but not display the calendar macro itself.\n\nSince Confluence does not recognize this as a calendar URL, it's not possible to use with the Team Calendar Macro.\n\nh3. Suggested Solution\nCreate an ability in the macro to link current calendar at the My Calendar link",

So at your team/project you need to put your vacation information for example on two systems.\n- So managing personal Calendar information in only one system (the personal one in outlook) would be nice. --> Team calendar should only aggregate calendar information.\n\nTo integrate Outlook I see following possibilities:\n- It gets an adapter to fetch MS-Exchange Calendar Information (providing server and authentification information)\n- there is a plugin/modus via export/import\n- There is a Module/Plugin for Outlook to bind it into Outlook Client and set up write/read permissions to the Team Calendar... :)\n- maybe other more ideas.\n",

Ideally, we would be able to include this in the meta data, or name display of the JIRA issue in Team Calendars.
