Issue Summary\r\nOn the old editor, on every internet page, selecting all of its content (*CTRL + A* / *CMMD + A*) and copying it (*CTRL + C* / *CMMD + C*), was possible to let you paste it (*CTRL + V* / *CMMD + V*) into the page.\r\nFor some reason, the new editor doesn't always work when we are pasting content we used to select all on webpages.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Create a new page;\r\n# Here you may have to search for a page that won't let you copy the content, as [this one|https://www.businessinsider.com/infographic-5-factors-transforming-payments-experience], for example;\r\n# Select all the content in the page with the keyboard shortcut (*CTRL + A* / *CMMD + A*);\r\n# Copy the content (*CTRL + V* / *CMMD + V*);\r\n# Paste it into the Confluence draft page (*CTRL + V* / *CMMD + V*)\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nThe content is pasted on the page.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nNothing happens.\r\n\r\n*Notes*:\r\n* Copying only the real content in the page (the article itself) works;\r\n* On this webpage, after you try to include on your select the

This was reported on the below bug request:\r\n * *CONFCLOUD-68319: Cloud Free, Unable to delete some spaces*\r\n\r\nThe above bug is now fixed for new Confluence Cloud Free subscriptions, but the existing ones where this behavior was happening are not.\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nOn a Confluence Cloud Free subscription, created before *Jan, 8th, 2020*, try to delete the very first space you created in the onboarding.\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nYou are able to delete this space.\r\nh3.

Problem Definition\r\n\r\nUsers not having the space permission can browse the pages on the space if the space is connected with Jira Service Desk as a knowledge base.\r\nFor example, there's a use case that both of the following requirements need to be met:\r\n\r\n* One knowledge base should be accessible to the invited service desk customers\r\n* One user account should only be able to browse spaces having a space permission\r\n\r\n !01-j.png|thumbnail!  !02-c.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nIf the *Customers my team adds to the project* option is selected in the *Customer permissions*, Confluence needs to take into account whether the user is also invited to the project as a customer.\r\n\r\n !03-j.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nNone. Consider adding yourself as a watcher to be kept informed as to the state of this feature request moving forward. With that way, if our development team updates the ticket, you'll be notified via email.\r\n\r\n",
