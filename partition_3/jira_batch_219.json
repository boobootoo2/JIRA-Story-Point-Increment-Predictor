      "description": "When using the reports that are offered by the Agile Board, I see the following inconsistency: They all appear under the Headline of a certain board and the board only shows issues that match the board's configured filter. So, in Plan and Work mode I only see these. Also the Sprint Report only lists those that match the filter. That is all as expected.\r\n\r\nHowever, when I use the \"Epic Report\", \"Version Report\" or \"Release Burndown\", the board's filter is not applied any more, but all issues belonging to the Epic, Version or Release are shown. \r\nWe work with several teams towards a common release. Each team using its own board and filter. So, for each team (board) the reports are not very useful, since they show everything. In my opinion the report behavior is inconsistent, since the board is expected to operate on the issues defined by the board's filter. If somebody needs a more general perspective, he would define a board with a more general filter (e.g. just by Project and Version) and then can see the report that you are now showing for all boards.

This can cause confusion as it could show Sprints from boards from a different project or cause users to link the issue to the wrong Sprint due to Sprints having the same name.\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\nHave a feature where JIRA will warn users that the issue(s) is being added into a Sprint that was created in a Board from different a project - validate this with the Board JQL too.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\nSince Sprint names are not unique in JIRA, try using unique Sprint names with a prefix of the Project so that it will be easier to distinguish them.",

Their layout of stories on the board are very elegantly laid out and all the information I need is on the card.

Though the value itself can be corrected afterwards, the burn down chart history can't be corrected. Especially when a user enters a value in weeks instead of hours, a relatively large spike shows up in the chart, which renders the chart unreadable and useless for the rest of the sprint, because of 'zoomed-out' scaling.\r\n\r\nThis issue also addresses this behaviour: https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/GHS-8477\r\n(Marked as resolved by giving an excuse)\r\n\r\nAn (outdated) workaround can be found here: https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/AGILEKB/How+to+remove+mistyped+Estimate\r\n\r\nI don't consider manually editing the database a viable workaround. (for OnDemand users, it isn't even possible at all). Because this issue causes significant loss of functionality, and the response/excuse from Atlassion so far triggered quite some negative reactions from users, I request this to be treated as a bug which needs to be fixed.\r\n\r\nSuggested fix: Allow administrators to somehow undo or delete changes made by users.\r\n\r\n(Since this issue occurs in Jira Agile, I file the it under the Jira Agile project.

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSWCLOUD-10720].\n  {panel}\n\nCreated due to [support suggestion|https://support.atlassian.com/servicedesk/customer/ghs/problem-report-11881] and [bug report ticket, redirected to support|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/GHS-10678]\r\n\r\nI've been investigating problems of interaction between our plugin and JAG, which occurs to a customer, who uses JIRA 5.1. \r\n\r\nSYNOPSIS:\r\nIn a nutshell, the problem is the following: if there is an add-on, which has a {code}\r\n<dependency>com.atlassian.auiplugin:ajs-underscorejs</dependency>\r\n{code} specified for context, applicable for JAG's own screens (like \"... /secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=1&view=planning\"), the JAG gets broken (can not render it's views, due to imported underscorejs priority over JAGs own underscorejs).\r\nThe issues root cause comes from the underscorejs version conflict (JAG expects underscorejs to be 1.4.4, but if there is plugin, imporing underscorejs from AUI, the imported underscorejs version might not be 1.4.4)\\*.\r\n\r\nFor me, as for a plugin developer there are such concerns:\r\n* If I would later on need to render my plugin's UI on a JAG's own page, I will have to either switch to my own no-conflict underscorejs (which would give an additional library to maintain), or to rely on the fact, that JAG uses underscorejs and thus do not import it (which is really a bad practice).\r\n* (warning: becoming grouchy here) AUI and ADG encourage library reuse\\*\\* throughout front-end applications. If this is a strongly advised principle, why should people make workarounds in order for another vendors plugin (read \"JAG\") to work properly. I mean, there would be a plugin, which needs it's dependencies throughout all the contexts (even for JAG's own pages, as JAG is a great plugin somewhat a standard for Agile project tracking). Should such a plugin's vendor diverge from the concepts and recommendations?\r\n* Any plugin with underscorejs dependency in the highlighted contexts block the JAG.

      "description": "Hi,\r\n\r\nWe have been using JIRA Agile / Greenhoper in Development for quite a long time and recently we have introduced JIRA Agile in some Operational Teams like Order Management and Accounting. Due to the nature of these departments and tasks, the estimation and tracking is both set up to be \"time\". The team estimates a task and then books hours against the task during the sprint. Goal is (amongst others) to create a fair workload balance across all agents. Tickets we talk about here have 1/2 day work as a minimum, but can easily be 20days of effort.\r\n\r\nThis all works brilliantly for us, but the Teamleaders have issues with Tasks that are estimated to take longer than one sprint (2weeks) and which are therefore carrying over to the next sprint after closure.\r\n\r\nIssue is: The remaining estimate is not used in plan mode, but the original estimate is. This leads to the following example: \r\nOriginal estimate: 10d\r\nTime spent: 8d\r\n\r\nIn plan mode for the new sprint this issue shows up with 10d, which makes it very hard to create a good next sprint, without checking each and every ticket  for the remaining time.\r\nWhen the sprint has been started, the issue is kind of resolved, because then the remaining time is being used. But this creates the need for scope changes...\r\n\r\nWhile fully understanding the approach on \"original estimate\", please provide an option to use \"remaining estimate\" in plan mode. The desired feature would be that the small dot with the original estimate in it (currently) is filled with the remaining estimate. If remaining estimate is not set, then original estimate shall be used.\r\n\r\nThis would enable us to plan fair sprints with good workload balance without having massive scope changes during the sprint. \r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nBernd\r\n\r\nNative Instruments GmbH\r\n+49 30 61 10 35 - 1251\r\n",

      "description": "The \"Edit Name\" functionality on an Epic in the Agile Planning View is essentially broken.\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Create an Epic with a reasonable story name - maybe around 7-8 words, 40-50 characters\r\n2. Switch to the Agile Planning view which shows the Versions/Epics/Issues columns.\r\n3. Find your epic, click on the drop-down menu indicator and select \"Edit Name\"\r\n4. Type in a new name about the same length as the old name.\r\nResult: the edit field prevents you from typing in more than 30 characters\r\nExpected: the edit field doesn't have any stricter limitations than if you were editing the name directly in the Epic's editor view\r\n(continuing)\r\n5. Go ahead an accept the new, shortened name in this Edit Name text field\r\n6. Now open the Epic in its full editor view\r\nResult: the new name assigned to the epic is apparently only a special alias for that planning view, not actually the new name of the epic. In fact if you toggle open the disclosure in the planning view you can see the epic now has two names - the long original name, and the constrained name that was just introduced by this (bogus?) \"Edit Name\" command\r\nExpected: if we're chaining the name of the epic, it should change the name of the epic, not introduce some new bizarre alias only visible in the planning GUI\r\n(continuing)\r\n8. Get rid of the bogus short name that the Planning view \"Edit Name\" command has introduced\r\nExpected: there's an obvious way to do this\r\nActual: there's no obvious way to do this\r\nThanks for fixing!",
