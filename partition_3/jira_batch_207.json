We have a lot of customer who will need to be migrated from Classic Boards to Rapid Boards, but we need to utilise the Parallel Sprints feature with this migration for their use cases.\r\n\r\nWe wanted to understand Atlassian's plan on releasing the \"Parallel Sprints\" feature which is still in Agile Labs.

When the development team is working on an issue we encourage them to break it down into smaller pieces for their work and to give a more granular burn-down but without impacting the committed-to volume of the agreed whole. Presently the clone function is used for this but then further tweaking is required to adjust the story points of the clones and original issue. This causes some noise on the burndown chart and in the respective reports this looks like lots of scope change events but it isn't - it's scope neutral. Also the clones don't inherit the original's workflow state of, in our case, \"commissioned\".\r\nWe would very much appreciate the possibility of a \"split\" function, which would provide a dialog box to enter a summary for each of the new issues, inclusive of the original. It should also be possible to enter directly in that dialog the Story Points which each of the new issues, including the original, should have. This must total the same as the story points of the original. On pressing OK, the new issues would be created and the original adjusted in its summary and story point value. All issues created should automatically have the same state and assignee (as well as other meta data such as components, labels, sprint etc.) as the original did prior to the split. All of this should be registered as a single split action on the reports and be completely invisible on the burndown chart.\r\n",

Problem Definition\r\nAs a configurer of an Agile board, similar to how I can configure my custom issue statuses to belong to one of the three options, I would also like to configure the columns on my agile board to be:\r\n- {color:#205081}Not Started{color}\r\n- {color:#f6c342}In Progress{color}\r\n- {color:#8eb021}Done{color}\r\n\r\nCurrently the automatic assumption is that the very left column is {color:#205081}Not Started{color} and the very right column is {color:#8eb021}Done{color}.\r\n\r\nThis is a huge limitation in Jira Agile and causes problems especially with rendering the burndown chart.\r\n\r\nI do not believe that asking the user to merge multiple of my columns into one or to create a separate Agile board is a sufficient solution for the issue.\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\nAllow the ability to add additional columns to also represent *Not Started* and *Done* in addition to the ability to already add an *In Progress* column.\r\n \r\nh3. Note\r\nJudging from the comments on GHS-10261 and GHS-11355 as well as [this post|https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/218653/configuring-jira-agile-columns-for-notstarted-inprogress-and-done] on Atlassian Answers, I do feel that this is a feature of general interest.\r\n\r\nPlease stop closing every suggestion about this as \"Answered\" and leave any one of these three open for us to vote on.\r\n\r\nNote: I am explicitly filing a duplicate of GHS-10261 and GHS-11355, both of which I find to have been closed prematurely.",

Environment\r\n* JIRA 6.0.8\r\n* JIRA Agile 6.2.5.1\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Install JIRA 6.0.8\r\n# Install JIRA Agile 6.2.5.1 from https://marketplace.atlassian.com/download/plugins/com.pyxis.greenhopper.jira/versions\r\n# Create a project;\r\n# Create a board;\r\n# Create some sprints in this board;\r\n# Create some issues;\r\n# Put those issues inside the future sprints.\r\n# Stop JIRA;\r\n# Install JIRA 6.4.x and point it to the previously used JIRA Home.\r\n# Start JIRA 6.4.x;\r\n# Update JIRA Agile to the latest version.\r\n# Select Agile > \"Your Board\"\r\n\r\nh3.

Actual Results\r\nAll issues are shown in the backlog, even after re-indexing JIRA.\r\n \r\nh3. Notes\r\nYou can download the backup attached ([^matheus.zip]) and use the credentials matheus/matheus to replicate this.
