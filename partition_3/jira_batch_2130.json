While this is functional, it can be very difficult to work with when you have hundreds of documents that need to put into a proper location.  This problem is compounded when you're doing \"clean up\" work and are not even sure where you are going to put said pages.\n\nThe great thing about an explorer style view (folders/sub-folders) is that you can quickly create a few basic folders simply to start putting documents into broad categories.  Then you can go into those folders and break them down further.  It's great when you can do this in real time, but if we can't drag and drop and instead have to go to the page and find the parent we want to give it...  It becomes cumbersome.\n\nSo if we could have an explorer view for organization, that would be great.",

CONF-29991 addressed this concern, but sorting was never introduced as a parameter that can be defined on the macro itself. Instead, sorting is undefined when the table is loaded and the viewer of the page can sort as they like.\n\nThe initial sorting should be able to be defined so that the document can display issues in the order the document embedding the view is concerned with (e.g. fixVersion, updated, etc.). Interaction with the table should be left in (could be an option to disable even).\n\nIf adding it to the macro parameters is undesirable for some reason, the macro should at least respect the sorting that the filter itself defines. It currently does not, as mentioned here: https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/228129/answers/9871223?flashId=-257275889",

Steps to Reproduce\n# Create a Page\n# Select the 'Edit' option from the top right menu\n# type \u2018{section\u2019 to bring up the section macro and select it\n# Enter information in the \u2018Section\u2019 macro.  (I saw the degradation grow as multiple items were added, but over 100 items is very noticeable)\n# Save the page (should be slow)\n# Navigate away and back to the page (should be slow)\n\n*If the same information is entered on a page without the section macro, it renders without speed degradation.* \n\nh2. Expected Result\nThe page would render normally and not take a noticeable amount of time to do so\n\nh2. Actual Result\n- The page takes a noticeable amount of time to render\n- In Confluence Cloud any text that does not render within a section column within 60 seconds will be truncated from the page (Location of text is random within document)\n-- Effects are compounded if using firefox with FireBug enabled\n\nh2. Environment\nConfluence 5.4.4\n\nh2. Other Notes\n* I have attached a Storage format of a page that has many items (so that it is easier to recreate by adding through source editor)\n* If you remove the data from the Section macro, the page renders very quickly.  That is reason for submitting this as a bug as it seems to be an issue with the \u2018Section\u2019 Macro itself\n* Only tested on Confluence 5.4.4 and 5.6.3.  Issue is present in both.",

As you can imagine, this results in a rather large number of comments to scroll through, many of which are \"stale\".  I propose that the ability to filter page comments based on date range and/or set a default date range of comments to view would solve this issue by restricting the page to only the most recent content, per the user's preference.

Fine\n\nBut if you display a single specfic blog entry (e.g. https://confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=12345678), than the semantic of the headline should change. It does still show the logo of the space owner User2 instead of the creator of this single blog entry User1! But the name of the author is shown correct, only the logo is wrong.\n\nThe behaviour is identical for normal spaces, but in a normal space you have a neutral space logo, so there is no mismatch between logo and author. But in personal spaces there is a mismatch for foreign authors ...",

Currently, it looks like the only way to display the date is the dd-mm-yyyy format. This causes problems when attempting to sort Date Lozenges that display in either a table or in a Page Properties Report macro. It sorts the day then the month then the year. Thus we end up with:\n\n16 Sept 2014\n17 Aug 2014\n18 January 2013\n\nI realize most of the world does put dates in the logical order (dd-mm-yyyy), but the US is behind on this unique concept, so I often have people asking me if the date can be changed or if they can put the date in as mm-dd-yyyy instead.\n\nI see two ways of fixing this:\n\n# Allow Confluence admins to specify the date format the Date Lozenge and allow users to enter the date as mm-dd-yyyy.\n# Correct the sorting of the Date Lozenge in the dd-mm-yyyy format so it sorts correctly by Year, Month, then Day in tables and the Page Properties Macro.",
