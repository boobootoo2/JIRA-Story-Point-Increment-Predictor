The suggested workaround is to change the text color to white as a way to hide text on the page., *+however+* the workaround isn't viable for two reasons:\r\n !screenshot-1.png|thumbnail! \r\n# The HTML macro shows the content of a page in edit mode giving an editor a view hidden content. Changing the text color to white font will not produce the same result as both a viewer and an editor will not be able to the visibility of the content in white font.\r\n# The color white is currently unavailable in the new editor.\r\n !screenshot-2.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce reason 1\r\n# Open a page using the old editor with the HTML comment macro present\r\n# copy the content of the HTML comment macro\r\n# Paste the copied content directly unto the page\r\n# Highlight the copied content and change the text color to white.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nThe content is hidden in view mode but visible in edit mode\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nThe content is hidden both in view and edit mode. We also have to keep in mind that the newer version of our editor does not even have the macro in the first place. Additionally there is no white font option at all in the new editor.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce reason 2\r\n# Create a page using the new editor\r\n# Type content you want to hide\r\n# Highlight the content you want to hid\r\n# Click the font color icon and try to apply white color to the content\r\n\r\nh3.

We\u2019re currently making some larger architectural changes to PDF Export that should resolve this bug (and many other PDF export related issues) that is set to fully release in early 2022.\u00a0We acknowledge that this has run into delays as the development team wants to ensure that we will not regress on functionality with the architectural improvements.\r\n\r\nWe know you have been waiting eagerly for this fix as we are, and we will be providing any updates as they come. Thank you again for your patience.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\n\r\nSteven\r\n{panel}\r\nh3. Issue Summary\r\nh3. Issue Summary\r\n\r\nExporting a space with 1000 + attachments hang the export at 50%\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n * Navigate to space with more than 1000 attachments\r\n * Perform a Full PDF export\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n * Export finished successfully\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n * Export stuck at 50 % with the message _Begin conversion of Intermediate HTML to PDF_\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nPerform a custom export with a minimal number of pages to reduce the number of attachments in the export file.\r\n\r\n*Note*\r\n When trying the custom export, please export the Restricted pages separately, as these pages will not be added to the export",

Workaround\r\n# Go to *Emoji* in the toolbar\r\n# Click *Add New Emoji*\r\n# Set a emoji shortcut\r\n# Upload the file you want to add in-line\r\n\r\nh3. Notes\r\n* Pages migrated from old editor to the new one, that contains inline images, might stop displaying those images. They'll show up as {{inlineExtension}} in published mode, instead.\r\n* This behavior is also present when importing word documents as pages - Images that have text on the same line will be replaced by *inlineExtension* placeholders on the final page. (This can be replicated using the annexed .docx file)\r\n*  [^this is an inline image.docx] ",
