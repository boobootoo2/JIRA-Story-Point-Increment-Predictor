Unfortunately, we are not being able to execute it using the bitbucket-pipeline.\n\nWe are using version 1.11.3 of testContainer to test our software with Cassandra. We are also using junt-jupiter for this.\n\nLocally the tests are performed with any problem. We are disabling ryuk by setting TESTCONTAINERS_RYUK_DISABLED to true in the environment variables.\n\nFrom the test report there seems to be a problem at the container startup:\n\n{code}\nCaused by: org.testcontainers.containers.ContainerLaunchException: Container startup failed\n{code}\n\nSince Cassandra is a huge memory consumer, I double the size for the gradle test step and give 6gb of memory to docker service.\n\nAny idea on how to solve this problem?\n\nThanks in advance.\\\\\nAndr\u00e9",

These tests are requested from a container image so on bitbucket-pipeline we are only execution `docker run <image>` to perform these tests. The problem is that the pipeline is not showing the tests tab.\n\nI understood that the test reports are not present in the \u201chost\u201d machine so it will not find the XML reports generated by gradle and, without tests report failing it does not show the tab.\n\nMy question is: Is it possible to share a folder between the \u201chost\u201d and the container to send the reports? I tried with `--mout` and `-v` flags in the docker run command but without success.\n\nIf shared folder is not possible what do you guys think that could work for this issue?\n\nThanks in advance!\n\nAndr\u00e9",

The rough steps to reproduce are:\n\n# Have a default pipelines configuration that catches all branches.\n# Have a PR on some branch X that triggers this default pipeline.\n# Push some final changes to branch X. This triggers a pipeline execution (as expected).\n# Before the pipeline in step 3 actually starts, merge the PR with \"delete branch X\" selected. This is the race condition.\n# Note that the pipeline in step 3 errors out with something like \"fatal: Remote branch X not found in upstream origin\"\n\nPossible resolutions:\n\n# Cancel any pipelines running on branch X when branch X is deleted. This would still probably have a race condition if the cancel doesn&#x27;t happen before the error is triggered.\n# Don&#x27;t let users merge and delete branch X while there are pipelines for branch X still running / scheduled.\n# Queue the merge to happen later after all the pending pipelines have (successfully?) completed.",

Scenario\nA Bitbucket Team or Account has multiple repositories (sometimes dozens) that have dependencies on other repositories under the same Team/Account and needs to pull other repositories during the pipelines steps.\n\nh2. Current Solution\nIn order for *repo-a* to pull *repo-b* that is under the same Team/Account, an admin must manually go into *repo-a* and copy the public key then go into *repo-b* and add that public sshkey as an \u201cAccess Key\u201d.\n\nh3. Proposed Enhancement\nAll repos under a Team/Account should have an option to automatically manage this process of sshkey/access key to sibling repos. The manual process of going through (potentially dozens) of repos to add access keys to accomplish this process is tedious and requires more overhead then necessary and should be automated or configurable in the Repo or Team/Account configs.",
