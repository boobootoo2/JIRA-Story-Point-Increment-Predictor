My name is Yousef, one of the PMs working in the Atlassian editor team. We value and appreciate your feedback and understand that there are gaps in the experience. When we built the new editor, we knew it would be a long journey to build a better, more robust experience for a larger group of customers.\r\n\r\nToday, we know we\u2019re not \u201cdone\u201d building, but we still believe that the editor was the right decision and we are generally proud of the overall experience. We\u2019re doing our best to prioritize what to build next so that we can deliver the most value to you, our customers.\r\n\r\n*However, we also understand that it\u2019s not fair to keep this issue open for so long without more regular updates from our side.*  We want to apologise for that. We know tables are valuable to our customers and provide a useful way to neatly present complex information. We know custom widths in tables are important to so many of you, *so we are moving that request up in our list of priorities and will expedite the work needed to ship a solution*. Please hang with us as we bring this functionality into the new editor experience for you.  *We will keep you all posted with more regular updates about the progress and change this ticket status accordingly!*\r\n\r\nSome of the workarounds that were mentioned in this ticket wouldn\u2019t solve the issue completely (like using layouts \u201ccolumns\u201d and place tables inside them to make it smaller), but we think it still offers a slightly better experience when you need to make the table smaller & align it in the page \u201cleft or right\u201d.\r\n\r\nThanks for all the feedback again and please keep it coming!\r\nYousef.\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\n\r\n{panel:title=Status Update 13 March 2020|borderStyle=solid|borderColor=#ff7f7f|titleBGColor=#ff7f7f|bgColor=#e5e5e5}\r\n\r\nAs we're working through this feature and others, we wanted to address a lot of your concerns as to the future of the new editor and legacy editor.\r\n\r\nPlease read our recent community post here: https://community.atlassian.com/t5/Confluence-Cloud-articles/Change-to-your-content-is-in-your-hands/ba-p/1324476\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nAvinoam\r\n\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\n\r\nh4. Summary\r\nIn the new editing improvements, it's possible to display a table at *full width*, *wide* or *center*, but it's not possible to set your own table width. You can change the width of individual columns within the width of the table, but not alter the table width itself.\r\n\r\nh4. Suggestion\r\nProvide the ability for users to set their own table widths in the editor.\r\n\r\n",

Those options would be:\r\n\r\n* Single column layout: No longer available and the closest of it would be to use a default space outside of the sections/columns. This could be useful for users that quickly wanted to reach certain parts of the page, or, copy only the content inside the specific column/section.\r\n* Options to Move to top/bottom: To quickly insert a new section above the page location. For larger pages, this quickly helped users to insert new content into a specific part and if needed, quickly re-organize a hierarchy of content that could be also used in macros like Table of Contents.\r\n\r\nThis is a request to have options to Move the layouts to the top/bottom back and also, the single-column layout for organization purposes.",

      "description": "h3. Issue Summary\r\n\r\nIn Confluence, the user can configure an Application Links to a Jira instance from a different site URL in order to display content from Jira inside macros like the *Jira issues* one. Once the link is configured, in order to add a Jira issue macro from the different site, the user will need to tap the *Login & Approve* button in order to authenticate and *Allow* the Oauth token to be created.\r\n\r\nIf a different user that has not authenticated yet tries to see the page with the Jira issue macro from a different instance, it will keep spinning until it eventually displays a message that there was an error retrieving the Jira issues macro, instead of asking the same to authenticate in order to see it. This can cause confusion as the user believes that an error might have happened, instead of needing to either create new Jira issues macro in a page, or, edit an existing one in order to use the *Login & Approve* button.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Make sure to have Jira and Confluence from two different sites (e.g. jira.atlassian.net and confluence.atlassian.net).\r\n# As an administrator of both instances, from Confluence go to *Settings > Application Links* and create a new application link pointing to the Jira instance.\r\n# After having it created, access a page and insert the *Jira issues* macro and point it to correct Jira instance.\r\n# Tap the *Login & Approve* button in order to use a valid JQL and find issues to be inserted from the target Jira instance.\r\n# Ask for a different user (with access to Jira and Confluence) to access the page and check the Jira issues macro.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nThe macro should be displaying an error pointing that the user must authenticate in order to see the content.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nThe macro keeps spinning (Getting issue details) and eventually has an error that the content could not be displayed.\r\n\r\nh3. Notes\r\n\r\nTo see the issue, the user must either:\r\n\r\n# Create a new Jira issue macro in order to retrieve the *Login & Approve* link to authenticate.\r\n# Or edit the Jira issue macro with issues and the *Login & Approve* button will be displayed\r\n\r\nIdeally, the pop-up should have the option to *Login & Approve* in order to see the Jira issues macro, or, creating an application link should also create the impersonation (optionally, as it used to happen with the deprecated \"Oauth impersonation\" authentication for application links) method for existing users in Jira and Confluence.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\nNo workaround besides having the user authenticating to see the Jira issues macro after a couple of minutes.",

Notes\r\n* Is there no option for a preview without having to connect your account? Some users want to be able to link to a Github account w/o having to link their acccount.\r\n* This also affects links to other applications such as Google Drive.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\nCreate a text link instead. \r\n\r\n# Type the text you want to use to link to Github.\r\n# Select the text.\r\n# CMD + K or CTRL + K to bring up the link dialogue. \r\n# Paste your link.",
