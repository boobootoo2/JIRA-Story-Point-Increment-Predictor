If a developer wants to view/show other \"in progress\" (or resolved) stories they are working on, they are forced to pull the story into the Sprint, which can adversely affect the Sprint burndown report (adding the story causes the \"remaining values\" to spike up for non-closed issues).\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if we had some type of filter/toggle in Work view to enable displaying these stories on the board (we don't really care about the \"to do\" items, mainly the \"in progress\" and \"resolved\" ones).\r\n\r\nAlternatively (if this was easier to implement), perhaps the Work view could be changed to allow the Sprint \"selector\" to change to a future sprint and/or the backlog so we could view in progress stories in that manner. (Currently it has an arrow that seems to indicate that it would display a selector, but this only shows us the sprint start/end dates and the \"Complete sprint\" button)\r\n\r\n(This may be somewhat related to GHS-9723)\r\n\r\nHopefully I explained this clearly enough, if not please let me know if I can clarify what we're looking for.\r\n",

We also often have tickets that roll over to the next sprint. \r\n\r\nCurrently when you close a sprint, any unresolved tickets are supposed to return to the top of the backlog. However, there's a bug in JIRA where the ticket is not returned to the _top of the backlog_ but instead is sent to the _first open, unstarted sprint_. The result is that, when closing sprints, we often add tickets to the wrong sprint and have to hunt for the tickets and remove them manually from those sprints. The hope is that the tickets would return to the top of the actual backlog. \r\n\r\nEC: When unresolved tickets roll over, return them to the top of the backlog, not to first open, unstarted sprint.

Based on the use case provided by customer:\r\n\r\n{quote}\r\nBasically it amounts to the fact that when you start a new project naming conventions are not really something you have fully stabilized. When at a later point in the project you want to refit some of your older works to the now more stable conventions it would be nice to be allowed to do this.\r\n\r\nIn this specific case sprint naming should follow a convention which will allow us to use the api more fluently without taking in to account to many obscure ways of naming sprints.\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nThis feature will be good to have in the target of re-organizing things and to be identified more fluently by the api.",

Work around\r\n\r\nIf the Epic Status field is in this configured state, it should not be \"locked\" (as it is a non-standard configuration). Therefore it should be possible to amend the configuration as follows:\r\n\r\n# View all Custom Fields\r\n# Find Epic Status and choose Configure\r\n# Find the default custom field context (there should be only one) and Edit it\r\n# At the bottom of the screen, under projects, choose Global Projects instead of selecting specific projects.\r\n# Disable and re-enable the JIRA Agile plugin\r\n# Re-indexing the instance\r\n\r\nThe upgrade task should then succeed, and JIRA Agile functionality will be restored. This however may have the side effect of locking the Epic Status field from further updates. However, the initial configuration of the custom field context selecting specific projects is unsupported.",

Plain kanban board forces you to use plain JIRA for planning, involving several workflow states and even several projects if you have several kanban teams.\r\n\r\nPossible way to implement: Use the exact same approach as done for scrum, as it allows two different teams to work on same issue pools thanks to sprint assignment. However dates can be skipped as the sprint will basically never end, instead a normal kanban mode deploy is done from time to time, while people still continue to work on issues in progress.\r\n\r\n",

For example a project may have a front end JavaScript MVC application and a server side API as two distinct repositories. One may be released without the other and vice versa, so we created a board with two quick filters, one for each component. The problem is that when you view the board with a quick filter applied and they you hit the release link, the release modal opens and says that all of the tickets will be released, not just the ones currently on the board scoped by the quick filter. What I would expect is that when you release, you only release the tickets currently visible on the board. ",
