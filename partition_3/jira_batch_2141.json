You'll see the profile picture of all 3 members in the home page.\n4) Then add more members to the Team Space (Space Tools > Permissions > Individual Users). \n5) Give them all the permissions.\n6) Go back to the Home Page of the Team Space. \n7) Just the 3 members added on the creation of the space will be there. So basically the Home Page is not updated after adding more members. This give the wrong information for the users, making they think that just 3 people are part of that team.\n\n*Workaround:*\n\n1) Edit the home page of the team space.\n2) Add the other users profile manually.\na) Add more columns to the table.\nb) Copy the content from one of the other members.\nc) Paste and make the necessary changes (profile picture and username below).",

Painstakingly remove the http://... prefix, change all \"+\" to \" \" until the link is acceptable to confluence.\n\nExpected:\n1. Confluence can work ot what to do with an absolute URL\n2. (nice to have but not required) a much better page selection widget with\n a. selection of last N pages you've visited (like jira does)\n b. autocompletion with incremental suggestion list narrowing\n",

As a company we have had numerous false starts at creating an environment that is embraced by the employees (share point, Wiki's of various types, smb shares etc). All technologies we have tried have failed due to them being unstructured across product lines and teams, and have eventually been abandoned or become messy black holes, from which we can never mine information.\n\nIn moving to the Atlasssian suite of tools/products we have  decided to take a proactive effort in templating spaces for the product lines, to provide common look and feel and familiarity to the users. In creating these spaces we have seen many challenges some of which we have in part solved with 3rd party plugins and macros (not ideal but workable). however there is one feature that was not solvable and create's significant work when using the space template to create new spaces and maintain ongoing.\n\nMany of our pages contain JQL queries tying JIRA to CONFLUENCE Pages. Though the queries are 90% the same across product/project (s) fields such as 'project' and 'fix version' are not for example. In an ideal world it should be possible to create variables in a confluence space or in-tree parent page which is available to all child pages. The variables could then be usable in JQL queries.  or Label definitions and ultimately plugin and macros etc.\n\nThis feature would save our company alone a world of hurt and time.",

Maybe you already know this exists and you have a good reason for not using it, but just in case...)\nOne of them is the file upload for profile picture (in Confluence, Jira, ...) which use an input type=\"file\" without accept attribute.\nThis standard HTML attribute let you specify the filter of the file picker (which is \"All files\" by default).\nUsing accept=\"image/*\" will add a filter to show only images files. The \"All files\" filter is supposed to be still available, but not the default.\naccept can also support file extensions, and mime type, but these aren't well supported on all browsers (while image/* is supported on major browsers, except IE).\n\nYou can safely use this attribute: in case user's browser doesn't support it, it will simply ignore it and your product will look like it is today, without any regression.\n\nIMHO it would be nice to use it in your products, and it doesn't sound difficult to implement.",

We should avoid overloading JIRA.\n\nh3. Workaround:\n\nSplit out the JIRA Issues Macro onto separate pages.\n\nAlso avoid using functionality that avoids loading multiple pages at once, such as viewing the blogs posts of a space, as this will trigger many calls to JIRA simultaneously.\n\nh3. Fix\nUpgrade to [JIRA Macros version 5.5.4|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/confluence.extra.jira]. This was bundled in Confluence 5.5.\n\nh3.

This is done obviously on purpose to reduce setup cost going forward (keeping defaults), by moving most of the management to active directory. \n\nFor example, a group called \"Developers\" in active directory should by default have \"users\" access (imagine it as a role). At the moment, the group \"developers\" is imported from LDAP, then the permission is replicated on \"global permissions\", then done again for each space. Even this is not perfect as there may be page specific permissions to replicate.\n\nRather, if there is a functionality to add \"developers\" group to \"users\", then it will simply inherit all \"user\" groups and its associated accesses.\n\nThis is extremely beneficial for large enterprises where you have separate teams managing confluence and the active directory. When a new employee joins the company, our single sign-on process for all our other systems means the only setup that needs to be made is @ active directory and all the employee's access is replicated across the system. \n\nFurthermore, when managing AD, sometimes one would like to split certain groups into multiple sub groups; this should ideally be a case of adding that new group to another local group rather than replicating permissions across the site (which is the case with ours as we're trying to learn and adopt confluence + with a growing company).\n\n",
