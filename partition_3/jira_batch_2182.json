Naively, you might do this:\n\n{code:java}\nApplication app = trustedAppsManager.getApplication(name);\napp.setPublicKey(newKey);\ntrustedAppsManager.saveApplication(app);\n{code}\n\nThis leaves the old keys lying around, which particularly causes an issue if you trust yourself.\n\nKeyStore doesn't offer a method to delete the old keys, the only way, without resorting to using Hibernate directly, is to delete the trusted app and recreate it.  But, if you do that, you'll likely get a unique constraint violation, because the name of the trusted app must be unique, this is enforced by the database, and Hibernate does not necessarily perform actions when it flushes in the order in which you coded them, so there's a good chance that it will insert the new one before deleting the old one.  The work around is to get a hold of the current session, and flush it after deleting the trusted app, which is not pretty at all.\n\nThis has caused issues for AppLinks 2.x in Studio, and is likely to cause issues in UAL.\n\n",

Description\n\n{excerpt}The Confluence Documentation Theme is a newer Confluence theme that is designed to facilitate wikis used for documentation.{excerpt} \n\nh2. Version 1.0.4\n\nDocumentation Theme 1.0.4 is the newest version that is compatible with Confluence 3.1.2 (what is currently deployed the production wiki server).  \n\n\nThis theme does not render well on the BlackBerry 6 browser.  This is due to the theme's use of scrollable divs to implement the navigation splitter.  \n\nThe theme doesn't have this problem on iPod touch or iPhone devices.  This is because the theme uses a bit of Javascript to disable the splitter on those devices.\n\n{code:lang=javascript|title=doctheme/doc-theme.js}\n// Don't display the sidebard on the iPhone. Will need to support other phones in the future.\nif((navigator.userAgent.match(/iPhone/i)) || (navigator.userAgent.match(/iPod/i))) {\n    AJS.$(\"#splitter-sidebar\").hide();\n}\nelse {\n...\n{code}\n\nThe simple fix is to expand this to check for BlackBerry browsers.\n\n{code:lang=javascript|title=doctheme/doc-theme.js}\n// Don't display the sidebard on the iPhone. Will need to support other phones in the future.\nif((navigator.userAgent.match(/iPhone/i))\n|| (navigator.userAgent.match(/iPod/i))\n|| (navigator.userAgent.match(/BlackBerry 9800/i))\n|| (navigator.userAgent.match(/BlackBerry 9780/i))) {\n    AJS.$(\"#splitter-sidebar\").hide();\n}\nelse {\n...\n{code}\n\nI'm not sure if it would be sufficient to just check for BlackBerry.  I suppose that if the newer WebKit browsers have problems with the splitter, then older devices will too.  I don't have a pre-6.0 device handy to test with, so I just put in checks for the devices that I do have.\n\nA patched version of the theme is also attached: [^doctheme-1.0.4-rim.jar]\n\nThis patch isn't perfect by any measure.  It doesn't check for other 6.0 devices. It doesn't handle pre-6.0 devices. It doesn't handle PlayBook.  And although the sidebar is hidden, it looks like the space is still reserved so the content doesn't flow to fill the width of the screen.  But even with these limitations, it's still a lot better than the stock version.\n",

In all other cases you renamed it to a dash \\(-). The PNGs in the black spinner dir are ment to be used by the confluence wiki by web, but \" \" is not a valid URL in a browser. It must be converted. So another point to rename it as in all other cases.\n\nNo, the only files where something from the \"black spinner\" dir is referenced is in confluence/includes/js/ddtree/spinner.js and spinner-min.js, so it can be easily changed.\n\nSo all your developers had to do was a rename of the \"black spinner\" directory and a replace of all \"black spinner\" occurences in both files to \"black-spinner\".

If you don't believe me, ask Charles, and watch him shiver.  A combination of wanting to fix this, and that this mechanism is not compatible with UAL, has led the Studio team to actually attempt to fix it.  Our strategy is to make JIRA, Confluence, FishEye and Bamboo all use the same trusted apps keys, this means that nothing needs to be done to sync them all together, as long as each app trusts its own certificates, they will all be in sync.\n\nSo, there are three pieces of information that must be the same across all three apps, the private key, the public key, and the application ID.  The application ID must be the same because each app will add their own applicaiton ID to each signed request, and then that application ID will have to be the ID at the remote end because it uses that ID to look up the applications it trusts.  This is where Confluence fails.  com.atlassian.confluence.security.trust.DefaultTrustedApplicationsManager has a hard coded mechanism for generating a trusted application id from the SID, it can't be overridden.\n\nSome ideas for implementing this may be:\n\n* Check bandana for an application ID before using the SID based one\n* Store trusted apps id in ApplicationConfiguration\n* Add a flag to the KEYSTORE table to indicate which key is the current application key\n* Allow a system property to override the application ID\n* Define some sort of mechanism for plugging into the thing that generates the application ID",

The idea would be that when I add a comment, I can pick one or more users to direct that comment to. Those users would receive email notification that there is a comment directed to them. Replies should also be directed.\n\nNormally a comment is added to a page and all watchers are notified, which is fine if everyone is watching every page. But there are many times where I want someone to take a look at a page and I have to add a comment and then email them to go look at the comment. This feature would eliminate that extra step and make collaboration easier.\n\nA simple search box above the comment text box would be all that's needed.",

It is confusing for the person doing the sharing as they cannot tell what is viewable to others and what is not. We have tried to make this as clear as possible through training and naming spaces a certain way to make this more clear (example \"All Company Share\" space, etc), but this is a brittle method and one that has limited success despite our efforts to keep throwing training at this. Is there any relief in sight on this? It really makes people frustrated when on rollout of Confluence we boasted about how Confluence increases collaboration and makes it easy, then it just makes it hard when people attempt to share and run into these problems where they are blind to everyone's access level for the content they need to share. It's really tough to manage being the administrator who has to deal with all of these snags. \n\nThe solution I have in mind is to write the sql needed to make this happen on my own and create a user macro to make this available to others (this has been done for Oracle but not Postgres from what I can see), but I'd rather see if there is a cleaner solution before wiring that in.

In the example @naonymous posted on November 1, there was not a 'unique ID/task numbers' (I don't know what the official term for them might be) associated with each task, as @anonymous DID have in the above example. These numbers can only be seen in wiki markup by the way. I had also experienced some unusual behavior, and found it occurred when these ID values were not present. \n\nI could consistently reproduce the creation of tasklsts without these ID numbers when using the Macro Browser.  However, if done the 'traditional way' (e.g. entering the word 'tasklist' in curly brackets), and then creating each task on the Rich Text page, the IDs are automatically and consistently created.  Possibly a bug in the Macro Browser creation of tasklists?\n\nThose IDs apparently have something to do with the tasklist macro behaving correctly, so I'd be curious to know if the above behavior can be replicated by others.  Thanks.\n{quote}",
