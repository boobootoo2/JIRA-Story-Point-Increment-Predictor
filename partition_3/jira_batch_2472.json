I&#x27;ll pay for JIRA. Make there some way so that I can pay extra and have _normal Bitbucket users_ access JIRA in my project, transparently, just as they currently do with the default issue tracker.\n\nIn other words, in my Bitbucket repository, alongside the \"turn on issue tracker\" checkbox, there would be an option: \"plain old issue tracker that isn&#x27;t as good as Github\" or \"JIRA issue tracker which you&#x27;ll pay extra for\". And I would pay extra for it!\n\nAs it stands, if I understand it correctly, if I want to use JIRA I&#x27;ll have to set it up completely separately, add users independently, and it wouldn&#x27;t be integrated in my normal Bitbucket project as the default issue tracker is.\n\nIf I misunderstand how this works, please correct my misunderstanding.

And we need to make them available for both types of accounts.\n\nEach of them has one add-on key with the individual context at the moment.\n\nFor File Viewer we also made a descriptor with the &#x27;account&#x27; context to make it possible to install the add-on in a team account by inserting the descriptor URL on the &#x27;Custom add-ons&#x27; page in the Team settings.\n\nBut this workaround is not a good solution. Because users first try installing the add-on by selecting it in the listing of available add-ons in Bitbucket Cloud and realize it doesn&#x27;t work for teams. To get it to work, they are supposed to contact us and get the descriptor URL.\n\nWe&#x27;d like to make it possible for users to install our add-ons both in individual and team accounts by adding them in the &#x27;Find integrations and add-ons&#x27; section in Bitbucket Cloud settings without inserting the descriptor URL.\n\nIt is not a problem to make 2 versions of the same add-on (one with account context, and the other with individual).
