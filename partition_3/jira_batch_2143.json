These files are quite often changed/saved, resulting in many versions of each file.\n\nThe feature to remove attachment versions is very helpful; but the problem is that you can only do it with space admin permissions.\n(https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Deleting+an+Attachment)\n\nThere are two problems with this:\n- We don't usually assign space admin permissions to the users editing these files. But the users should be able to manage their attachment versions themselves, as the space admin is the IT guy most of the times.\n- There's also the permission \"Delete Attachments\" - why doesn't this permission also cover deleting the versions? It doesn't make sense not being able to remove a certain version while being able to delete the whole attachment (including ALL versions).\n\nSo my request is to include the attachment version removal right into the \"Delete Attachment\" right.\n\nThanks in advance",

Response from development\nThis is the way the system was designed. In an email that contains a 'diff', macros will not render, instead they show the parameters of the macro. In a non-diff email (like when a page is first created), the macro is rendered. \n\nSo if a user watches a whole space, when a page is created with a JIRA Issues Macro on it, they will see the list in the email, but if the page is edited, they will not.\n\nThe development team has discussed this before and decided against it, because in a 'diff' email, it may lead people to believe that the editor had made changes to the issues themselves, not to the macro parameters. They believe the macro parameters are more useful in a diff email than rendering the macro, so this will not be changed.\n{panel}\n\nh3.Additional Keywords (to aid in searching for this issue)\nJIRA Issues Macro parameters shown in email notification and doesn't render as expected.

Included are the following recommendations but please see the document for more details.\n\n* Text editor: since text editor is inherently broken and unusable by a screen reader user, the text editor should be completely overhauled and/or replaced with an accessible alternative.\n* For dynamic content: ARIA (Accessible-Rich Internet Applications) alert to indicate to user that the content has been dynamically changed.\n* For semantic structure (headings): all pages should be reviewed to ensure that no heading levels have been skipped. Specifically, on search results page, search results should be h2 instead of h3.\n* All images should have appropriate alt tags. \n* Developer should use ARIA landmarks to help screen reader users identify main content and navigation regions on pages.

They all have the same label. I would like to collect all data in 1 page properties report. If I understand the documentation well, this should work (as long as the labels are the same). However, it seems that only the last one or the one in the righthand section is included in the report. I have tried without mentioning the column headers and with mentioning them. In the latter case, no values are displayed for the columns that do not belong to the last page properties macro. In the first case, only the columns belonging to the last or the right-hand macro are included. Please, advise.\n{quote}\n\nCurrent functionality is that when there are multiple Page Properties macros (with the same label specified) on a page the Page Properties Report macro only reports the data contained in ONE Page Properties macro in the report.\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. Create a page with a page properties macro. In that macro, add a table that looks like this:\n|| a | 1 |\n|| b | 2 |\n2. In that macro, give it a label 'prop1'\n3. Add another page property macro on that page, give it the same label 'prop1' with the contents:\n|| c | 3 |\n|| d | 4 |\n4. Save the page. Now create a new page in the space.\nIn that new page, create a page properties report macro and give it the label 'prop1'.\nOutcome: It reports on ONE table only  (c and d)\nThis feature request is so that it displays all data (a, b, c and d) because the label 'prop1' is specified on both. \n\nThis appears to be the reverse of the use case in https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONF-28776",

The improvements are:\n* Personalization option for a user to create a filter for such list of links that belong to that user, i.e. adding personal label to the filter.\n* This filter should be able to be updated without losing the personal label attached to it.\n* Extend the ability of link collection to be compiled not only limited for each space but throughout the whole site.\n\nMain goal for this improvement is to provide a centralized list of links of customer's company wide resources that can be selected by each wiki user for their dashboard.\n\nThank you and regards,\nLazuardi",

Our people travel much and want to have their documents offline on their own devices with automatic sync \u00e1 la dropbox.\n\nWe do not want to introduce owncloud.org or similar services as a parallel solution. Also 3rd party webdav sync clients do not offer the level of usability required by our users.\n\nWhen can we expect something similar for Confluence?\nI assume that syncing the page content and page meta content is a bigger issue. However, this is not really necessary in a first step. Already the syncing of attachments in a folder(page) and sub folder (sub pages) would be tremendously helpful.\n\nIt would be great, if this can find its way into the product roadmap - I assume that we are not the only one looking for alternatives.\n\nThanks",

EVERY page should have an email link and/or a telephone number to go DIRECTLY to technical support.  Then once I go to help I find it is focused on instructors not students and I have to go through a sign up for another account to submit an issue.  There is a LONG list of forums you support and none clearly state JHU Blackboard.  I have been in IT for close to 20 years and by far this is the worst for customer support.  I don't even know if the issue I am having is something for you as the company who creates the code for the Blackboard site or the JHU administrators or if you are the same people.  However, it works you have the issue and expect you to work with whomever to get it resolved.\n\nI went to the \"Edit personal information\" page in Blackboard.  I see where it allows me to change my first name but when I hit submit I get a database eror.  I tried it in class on the JHU network and at home with the same result.\nA database error occurred.\n\nFor reference, the Error ID is 175193d5-d423-461b-9f5a-e1f7dbcfb9b9.\n\nAlso by default everything from Blackboard goes to my work email and I can find no place to change it to my JHU email.

If the Page exists, don't display it as Page Not Found, especially when user has not logged in.\n2. Or, at least, when accessing\"removepagenotification.action\" page without logged in session, it should redirect to Login page. Because no one will be able to manage without logging in.\n3. Simply, redirect to login page where user credential is mandatory.\n4. Or, you could redirect to login page if you see \"src=email\" parameter in URL, which means the user is registered user of the system because the user received an email regarding this page.\n\nAtlassian people keep their login always, so you might not see this often.\nHowever, as a external customer, we don't keep login for CAC.\n\"Page Not Found\" message was improper in this case.\n\nPlease, improve this behavior.\n\nThank you.\n",

Alignment within code is important for documentation and readability. If Atlassian insists that a default 4-space tab is best, please allow/support an alternate in the code block widget (at least). Clearly, tabs vs spaces and tab size are preferences and I would hope that Atlassian would strive to not enforce one over the other but give customers the final say.
