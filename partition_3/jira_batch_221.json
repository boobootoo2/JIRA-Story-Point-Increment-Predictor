In some cases they can affect board performance.\r\n\r\nh3. COS\r\n* Add a board configuration option in the \"columns\" section.\r\n* For kanban boards, this feature should ON by default, and for scrum it should be OFF by default.\r\n* Body class / style for sprint support should be updated.\r\n\r\nThe toggle should allow scrum users to use this feature.\r\n\r\nh3. Testing notes:\r\n\r\n* Wallboard modes for scrum and kanban boards need to look correct. \r\n* Consider cards when:\r\n** Estimate badges are there and days in column are.\r\n** Estimate badges are not there and days in column are.\r\n** Estimate badges are there and days in column are not\r\n** Estimate badges are not there and days in column are not\r\n** Test the same on non-wallboard work mode.\r\n* Test cards with long summaries.\r\n\r\nh3.

If you go to the edit screen for one of these subtasks and click update (regardless of whether or not you change any values as part of the edit), the subtask's history (and the email notification) will tell you that the sprint value was emptied.  (The subtasks issue detail screen still shows it as belonging to the correct sprint, and it still shows up on the scrum board's work area).  We're on JIRA 6.2, and see the above with both agile 6.3.9.1 and 6.3.9.2 (we never downloaded 6.3.9).{quote}",

Application restart and one more re-indexing was performed to fix boards.\r\nSo, re-indexing was performed 3 times.\r\n\r\nAs far as jira-agile upgrade doesn't require jira restart (according to upgrade guide)  this looks as a bug. It seams that Event listener classes can't be updated for plugin modules on the fly and require jira restart. \r\nNot sure if this relates to this particular problem.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "description": "Creating issues in JIRA sets ranking inconsistently.\r\n\r\nh4. Steps to Replicate the Problem:\r\n* Creating an Issue from a view other than the Planning Board (e.g. from the dashboard) causes the issue to appear at the bottom of the Planning View.\r\n* When creating it from the Planning View, the new ticket will automatically appear underneath whichever ticket is currently selected.\r\n* If no ticket is selected in the Planning View and a new ticket is added, that ticket will appear at the TOP of the backlog. To reproduce, just manually remove the {{selectedIssue=XXX}} query string parameter from the Planning View URL and try to create a new ticket.\r\n\r\nh4. Expected Behavior:\r\nCreating a new issue should put it to the bottom of the backlog at all times, to prevent accidentally giving the issue a priority.\r\n\r\nRef.: https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/198381/configuring-new-issue-planning-board-position",
