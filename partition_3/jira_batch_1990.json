      "description": "*Suggestion: Provide apps the ability to detect when macro is in old or new page, so that the app will be able to style macros w/ stylesheet from parent page, using context parameters.*\r\n\r\nAs developers of Atlassian Connect apps we need a way to tell if the macro is in a fabric page or an old page.\r\n\r\nWe run into problems where we need to know what kind of a page the macro is being rendered in. Also, rendering iframes in macros is difficult to style because we don't have a stylesheet that matches the parent page.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n We are currently struggling to render font sizes and some subtle line rendering in frames in our macros to look good in both old and new pages and it is looking like we can make it look good in one or the other.\r\n (what we really need for that one is for Atlassian to provide a stylesheet to the connect macro that matches the parent page's styles so we can us it inside of iframes. )\r\n\r\nAnother example:\r\n There are caching bugs for fabric pages with Connect macros in them. We reported this with DEVHELP-4036. Until that is fixed we would like to render a warning in our macro editor (only for fabric/new pages).\r\n\r\nWe probably have other examples. I'm new to the Atlassian ecosystem so my explanations may be weak but my colleagues have lots of experience with it and I can consult further with them if necessary. Please let me know if this issue needs clarification.\r\n\r\nI'm assigning a high severity to this issue because more and more of our customers are using fabric pages, especially new customers. It is difficult to sell our macros if they render poorly styled content.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n\u2013\r\n\r\nExisting apps (IDs) in Marketplace that are affected:\r\n biz.artemissoftware.confluence.multiexcerpt.MultiExcerptMacro\r\n biz.artemissoftware.confluence.html.HtmlMacro\r\n\r\nDEVHELP reference:\r\n [https://ecosystem.atlassian.net/browse/DEVHELP-4037]",

Problem Definition\r\n\r\nUsers are unable to add a link to PDF preview that shows the document directly in the referenced page. When attaching a preview, no matter how, users are always redirected to the first page of the document.\r\nh3. Suggested Resolution\r\n\r\nAllow users to create links to specific pages of a PDF document, almost\u00a0like a summary in a document. Clicking this link, the user will open preview mode directly in the referenced page.\r\nh3. Why This Is Important\r\n\r\nWhen dealing with big documents sharing what is within them becomes a hassle because users will always start reading the document from the start.\r\nh3. Workaround\u00a0\r\n\r\nTo implement something similar in a Confluence page, you could do the following:\r\n 1 - Access the desired page with the PDF attached to it\r\n 2 - Go to the *Attachment Section* (Little clip ot the right side of the padlock at the top of the page)\r\n 3 - Click view in the desired attachment\r\n 4 - Navigate to the desired page, the one you want to link\r\n 5 - Right click and select *Copy image address*\r\n 6 - Go back to the page and edit it\r\n 7 - Paste the link you just copied\r\n 8 - Save the page\r\n **Optional - Edit the pasted link name to match a desired specification\r\n Now, the link you pasted to the page will lead to the specified page. But, the limitations I spoke about earlier are\r\n - You can not navigate the entire document directly from that preview\r\n - When clicked, the page will open straight to the current tab, users must ctrl+click or right click and select open in another tab",

There are keys for the most common ones (\u00e8\u00e9\u00e0) but for all other combinations you have to type ` and then the letter, i.e. ` u.\r\n * So the keyboard driver \"remembers\" that you pressed the ` key, but doesn't print the character. If you press it twice, you get two `` printed out directly.\r\n\r\nAlternatively you could press ` and space to get a single backtick.\r\n * In order to get _just_ three backticks you have to press ` 4x + 1 backspace, or ` 3x + space.\r\n * In markdown however, a lot of interpreters don't care if I enter 3 ``` or 4 ```` so it doesn't matter. But if confluence expects _exactly_ 3 ```, it gets cumbersome to use this syntax.\r\n\r\nIt'd be nice to bring back the\u00a0\\{macro} syntax (which was very easy, even on the Swiss layout (had to use a combination of AltGr and two keys but which are easily reachable) but sucked on the German layout (AltGr + 7 / 8 - which is very uncomfortable) or a different option for those already using many backticks.\u00a0",

Knowing what time it is for your coworker(s) makes it easier for us to collaborate and respect each others work schedules.\r\n\r\n*Use case 1*: When creating a Company, Dept, or Team directory/listing in Confluence can include a timezone name (e.g. \"EST/EDT\" or \"ECT\" but that doesn't actually help very much. There's business value in knowing what time it _right now_ for each person on our distributed team.\r\n\r\n*Use case 2:* A page that is more \"dashboard\" oriented could contain a set of custom clocks, specific to the timezones relevant for the Company, Dept, Team, etc. We see this often in DevOps and Support teams, yet Confluence cannot do this today.\r\n\r\n*MVP features*: a single analog or digital clock would do. The macro would need to have a selector for timezone. A few fixed sizes would be ok.\r\n\r\n*Bonus features*: Other clock styles (digital and analog, different designs); color choices; arbitrary sizing.",

You can identify if your instance has content records on that state with the below query:\r\n{code:sql}\r\nselect contentid,contenttype,content_status from content where creationdate is null and spaceid = (select spaceid from spaces where spacekey = '<SPACE_KEY_HERE>');\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\nThen go to each page, delete the *Inline Task*, not the Task Report Macro and create the *Inline Task* again. To do so, pick each of the Content IDs retrieved from previous steps and use them in the following URL:\r\n* _<Base-URL>/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=<ContentID>_\r\n\r\nOnce the task is recreated, you can use the ContentID to query the following table - It should return results now, whereas it wasn't earlier:\r\n{code:sql}\r\nselect * from \"AO_BAF3AA_AOINLINE_TASK\" where \"CONTENT_ID\" = <ContentID>\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nWith results returning in the above table, one would be safe to run a XML Export and then import it in Cloud.\r\n\r\nIf your issue is related to the missing creation date you should look to update those records directly in the database during a scheduled downtime.\r\nTo make this easier you can update all null records into a fixed date:\r\n{code:sql}\r\nupdate content set creationdate = '2018-06-11 10:00:00' where creationdate is null;\r\n{code}\r\n\r\n*Note*\r\nIf you don't know which space has caused the issue, you could run this query that will gather all pages in such state and thus potential candidates to be causing the problem:\r\n{code}\r\nselect c.contentid, s.spacekey from content c, spaces s where c.spaceid = s.spaceid and c.contentid in \r\n(select contentid from bodycontent where body like '%ac:name=\"tasks-report-macro\"%') \r\nand c.prevver is null and c.contentid not in (select \"CONTENT_ID\" from \"AO_BAF3AA_AOINLINE_TASK\");\r\n{code}",

      "description": "Hi. I don't know if this issue has been raised, but that extra trigger for the data-testid=\"ContextualNavigation\" pane is rather disruptive. There are already two other better ways of opening that nav pane: the ak-nav aria expand toggle button thing, and the brace key \"[\".\r\n\r\n[https://belamiinc-my.sharepoint.com/:v:/p/matthew_lewis/EVi96avKUD1Mim4oPeRiPscBSXcHF-A_DfC1GQOJ_tgG_A]\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nWhen trying to compare versions on a page, the checkboxes are close enough to that nav pane that it pops out eclipsing the boxes I'm trying to get to. These types of things (some of your toastr additions) just get in the way of the objects I'm going for. It looks like maybe you're just testing that out but just wanted to suggest _not_ making this feature into a thing that you feature.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThanks. That's all.",
