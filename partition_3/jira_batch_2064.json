If the snippet is very short, breaking the paragraph flow for a code block is disruptive. It looks much better to put it inline and simply render it in a monospaced font. This is especially useful when discussing command line flags or identifiers used in a code block.\n\nIn JIRA it's possible to do this with double curly braces, for example {{\\{\\{someIdentifier\\}\\}}}. Unfortunately no such facility exists for Answers. I think a button should be added to the inline formatting set (with bold and italic) which applies a monospaced font.",

The public REST API for Confluence Questions is now available in version 2.3.0 and above. You can find out what you can do with it on this *[documentation page|https://docs.atlassian.com/confluence-questions/rest/index.html]*.\n\nWe would appreciate one minute of our time filling out a very short survey to help us understand what you hope to do with a REST API. To do so please fill out the following survey:\nh4. \u2192 [Provide feedback with Confluence Questions REST API Survey|https://atlassian.wufoo.com/forms/confluence-questions-rest-api/]\nCheers,\nThe Confluence Questions team\n{panel}\n\n\n\n\n* initial use case is for importing content from other Q&A systems\n* would also be great if it could be used for export as well thus satisfying the need for an xml export/import feature CQ-359 ",

Of course, as with other content in confluence you should be able to search globally or within the space.\n\n2. \"You can then browse all pages with that label in a single space or across the site, or display a list of pages with that label.\"\n\nLabels (which approximately equal) topics should be there to provide an extra layer of organization on top of spaces.\n\nNote, example even Calendars get a related space, even though the calendars are going to have much lower cardinality on average compared to questions (or even topics) and the need to classify and organize them would be lower.\n\nIn the end people will use topics/labels to represent the space association, but this is semantically not clean and consistent and that matters.\n",

Problem Definition\n\nWhen using the Task Report macro, you must specify a specific space or page from which to pull the tasks. If a user is adding the Task Report macro to a space or page template, this can pose a problem because no specific spaces or pages are specified. This pulls in all tasks from any space/page.\nh3. Suggested Solution\n\nAllow for the use of variables in this macro, like {{$spacKey}} so that the template will pull only tasks from that space. Or allow a blank entry in the *Space(s) and Page(s)*\u00a0box to default to the current space.\u00a0\nh3. Why this is important\n\nThis is important to maintaining consistency in pages created through a template with this macro.\nh3.

However, one issue seriously limits the user value: As soon as the tasks can no longer be displayed on one page, sorting and filtering does no longer work reliably as it only applies to the currently displayed page.\n\nA possible workaround would be allow more flexibility in one (preferably both) of the following settings:\n # Number of tasks per page: allow higher number to avoid page breaks (such as 3000 as for the page properties macro)\n # Sort by: Allow sorting by all available columns (completedate + description are missing) in order to have a pre-sorted page breakdown.\n\nThank you for your support!\n\nRegards /Heiko",

On the other hand this sticky top bar consumes a considerable amount of space on smaller screens.\n\nTo improve the user experience I suggest to allow each user to choose if he want's to see this sticky bar or go back to the behaviour before the update (= no sticky bar).\n\nIn addition it would be nice to have configuration options for the sticky bar.

It is very unlikely that drafts older than a few weeks will ever be used and they may be forgotten if the 'drafts' page is not accessed.\r\n\r\nAlso, the drafts keep the attachments added to it, so they can take a lot of disk space.\r\n\r\nThere were cases where users were unable to generate Confluence Cloud backups because of the size of attachments. More than half of all attachments were associated to drafts, over 200GB.\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nProvide the following options, with a specific page this configuration:\r\n# A configuration for expiry draft dates (say, remove every drafts after 30 days with no modification)\r\n#* We can keep this option as disabled by default, so by default Confluence continues to work as it does\r\n# An option to run immediately a job to delete all drafts that are older than a specific date, if the customer has the need to decrease the size of drafts\r\n# Provide information on draft space usage.\r\n \r\nh3. Workaround \r\nThere's a [REST API|https://developer.atlassian.com/confdev/confluence-server-rest-api] call to delete drafts (it may not work with Collaborative Editing):\r\n{code}\r\ncurl -D- -u <user>:<password> -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -X DELETE <URL>/rest/api/content/<ID>?status=draft\r\n{code}",
