E.g. setup a Space that people in the LDAP group STAFF and the LDAP group Biosciences were the only people that were able to view/edit/add/etc - otherwise I have to have a group for \"Staff in Biosiences\", \"Staff in Engineering\", \"Staff in Computing\", etc.\n\nAnother use would be to add exclusions to Space permission, e.g. I want everyone in the Biosciences group to have full permissions on a Space, but *NOT* the users in the \"Students in Biosciences\" group as they should just be able to view.\n\nOne of the major gripes (in general, not specifically Confluence) is that they *HATE* having to set up permissions in different applications for the same groups of users.  We've gone some way in improving things by moving all of our Confluence group management to LDAP, but I think this functionality would make things even better.\n\nAlthough we've moved all of our group management to LDAP I can see this being useful for people who are using confluence-groups and those that are using a mixture of confluence-groups and LDAP.\n\nBoolean operands on group/user membership is phenomenally powerful and would put you miles ahead of anything else I've seen in terms of application permissions (and I'm not just talking wikis!!!).",

We can email these people if we should ever offer something suitable for them. Current practise is to point them to the personal license if they're really small, explain about involving customers/clients/suppliers in the wiki, discuss them using a cheaper hosted wiki that that we can import from later eg hosted Mediawiki (while explaining how our features are better suited for companies but there are fixed costs etc).\n\n1.

A GUI very similar to the one used for selecting users for the restrictions could be added as another tab in the tool, maybe called Users.  In our organization the usernames are essentially numeric so it is difficult to make links to users without looking the id up in another system.  We are trying to encourage crosslinking, but when its difficult people will rarely do it.  If they could search for the user by their last name, similar to the existing restrictions GUI, I believe this will rectify the issue.  The created link will be the same behavior as linking to their space if they have one or to their profile if they don't or it isn't visible.",

Therefore we have created templates to give the reporter a clear structure format which information have to be included.\n\nTo list these information entered through our template we have labelled each template individually. Once you have completed the template it will automatically\ncreate a new page. This new page will be shown through the Macro \"Contentbylabel\" on a certain page.\n\nOnce a new \"entry\" (altough it will be a new page) has been made it should inform everybody by email (through the Confluence Watchlist) that a new information has been posted on this page.\nUnfortunately, the watchlist ignores such entries made by through the Macro \"ContentbyLabel\". Is there any way how we can fix this or if you could inform me which other ways I might have using Confluence and using a blackboard.\n\nThank you.\n\nBest,\n\nOliver Heckert",

The requests (HTTP Connector) timed out after 2 minutes and Tomcat returns a [503 error|http://www.checkupdown.com/status/E503.html] to the browser. The database query however will still be executed.\n\nA customer pointed out that the ability to cancel a request that takes unexpectedly long to complete - usually due to an error in page code - should be available to a page author or viewer.\n\nA quote from the customer:\n{quote}\nMany is the time I have previewed a reporting macro invocation that I didn't want to complete, or tried to troubleshoot a user's problem and been stymied because editing the page required me to view it first, and the 503 message didn't allow the page to render so that I could click its edit link. I know, of course, that I could look up its content ID and invoke the editpage action independently, but that's time-consuming and irritating.\n\nAnd, of course, 503 (service unavailable) is not what I would think of as an appropriate response to something that was taking too long to complete, though of course there may not be any other conclusion the respondant server could reach under the circumstances.\n\nBut in the final analysis I still can't imagine a case where a transaction - at least, one whose only purpose is to provide a response with no persistent side effect - should be allowed to continue after it is known for certain that the requestor will never receive that response. This is especially important when the user's most likely action in the face of such a situation is to try it again - often multiple times - raising the probability of deadlocks, delays and wasted resources that can build to performance-affecting - and even service-threatening - levels to near certainty.\n\nEven for an action that does have persistent side effects, I would not find it acceptable to be uncertain of whether they had been executed under such conditions. If there is a meaningful risk that it may take unreasonably long to complete, it would be more sensible to use job scheduling to put it explicitly into the background, with the ability to monitor its state. \n{quote}\n\nAn interface that indicates running queries or actions might also be helpful in this case.

Expanding on that idea, they would also like the ability to export to PDF/Word with attachments too (where feasible), the ability to select which attachments get included in the print, and the order they are printed in. (All of this is relative to the page context. They are thinking that, while they are reading a specific page, they would click print and have all this happen.)\n\nThanks so much!\n-Gray\nMedical School Information Services\nUniversity of Michigan",

This makes it impossible to see which one is which when scrolling through a document.\n\nSame thing with heading 3, 4 and 5: there's only a slight variation in font size that makes them different from each other.\n\nOn a side note, I know that many people think that heading 1 is too big and takes up too much space, and are using heading 5 as their main heading.\n",

LDAP) so that the same parameters or configurations do not need to be added/applied again in the upgraded version.\n\nAt the moment when one sets a JVM parameter for Confluence, eg. Xmx, permgen, etc. the value will not be carried over to the new upgraded version.

Increasing permgen size. \n\nYou can search our history. But what happened is that it was lost in the upgrade (we didn't merge it over). \n:\n:\nAlthough the way Conf/JIRA upgrades are done is our #1 complaint about Conf/JIRA. The upgrade process is so painful we dread doing Conf/JIRA upgrades and put them off for six months or a year sometimes. \n\n_Having to hand merge over files seems completely anachronistic._ \n\nSettings like permgensize and database and user authentication should live _OUTSIDE_ the install folder and thus should survive an upgrade. It is hard to comprehend the way you do it, how people accept merging that stuff over by hand even for the most minor upgrade. It makes for a horrible user experience.\n\nThe bottom line is you probably expect IT professional will admin this stuff. We are software engineers but not IT professional. So our expectations are very different. I would expect an upgrade to be automatic and never required hand editing anything.\n:\n:\nThose are our standing complaints: upgrades and memory settings.

There can be several plugins installed, yet not necessarily used throughout the application. It would be wonderful though to get such info and I'd thus strongly suggest for you to create a new feature request in our jira system. http://jira.atlassian.com - I'd like to leave the credit of this great idea for you - hence am requesting for you to create the ticket (otherwise am happy to do so)\n\nPotentially, one could write some sort of a plugin that would be querying the DB - {{PLUGIN}} table and {{PLUGIN_DATA}} table and somehow then traversing through the content of all confluence pages and analyse whether a particular plugin is in use or not. Would create extra load on the app, and the dynamic info gathering process may slow down the instance. (_perhaps there is much much better way of doing so_) You may also ask the dev forums {{forums.atlassian.com}}\n",
