      "description": "{panel:title=Atlassian Status as of 23rd July 2014|borderStyle=solid|borderColor=#3C78B5| titleBGColor=#3C78B5| bgColor=#E7F4FA}\r\n\r\nDear Customers,\r\n\r\nThis bug was fixed in JIRA Agile 6.4.3, which will help prevent future rank data corruption from occurring.\r\n\r\nThe new release *does not* attempt to automatically correct any existing rank data corruption that may be present as a result of installing JIRA Agile 6.4.x. The reason behind this is because we feel that the best way to deal with existing cases is with the help of our Support Team.\r\n\r\nIf you are upgrading an instance which previously had a 6.4.x version installed, and you find that your problems persist, please [contact our Support Team|https://support.atlassian.com] so that they can investigate the state of your ranking data and provide a faster resolution.\r\n\r\nWe thank you for your continued patience and hope that you appreciate our open communication style.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nJIRA Agile Team\r\n\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\nh3. Symptoms \r\n- You're using an Oracle database \r\n- You're running JAG 6.4.x \r\n- Creating a new issue is slow and the jira logs have the following warning message \r\n{code}2014-07-02 09:11:26,257 http-bio-8080-exec-97 WARN xxxxxx 551x7454x6 1hz4f54 xxx.xxx.10.xxx,192.xxx.1.12 /secure/QuickCreateIssue.jspa [greenhopper.customfield.lexorank.LexoRankIndexer] Could not retrieve LexoRank value for issue[id=123317]. Indexing max LexoRank value {code} \r\n\r\nSome Oracle configurations don't surface the problem however. To confirm your system is affected run these two queries: \r\n\r\n{code} \r\nSELECT * FROM \"AO_60DB71_LEXORANK\" WHERE \"FIELD_ID\" = *insert rank field id here* AND ROWNUM <=2 ORDER BY \"RANK\" DESC; \r\n{code} \r\n\r\n{code} \r\nSELECT \"RANK\" FROM (SELECT * FROM \"AO_60DB71_LEXORANK\" WHERE \"FIELD_ID\" = *insert rank field id here* ORDER BY \"RANK\" DESC) WHERE ROWNUM <=2 ; \r\n{code} \r\n\r\nIf both return the same 2 rows, then it is good. If they differ the ranking in JAG will not work properly. \r\n\r\nTo find the *Rank field ID*, follow the steps below: \r\n# Go to Administration > Issues > Custom Fields. \r\n# Find the *Rank* custom field. \r\n# Click on the Cog Icon > View. \r\n# The URL will change similarly to the example below: \r\n{noformat} \r\nhttp://yourjira/secure/admin/ConfigureCustomField!default.jspa?customFieldId=10005 \r\n{noformat} \r\nIn this example the Rank Field ID is *10005*. \r\n\r\nh3. Root cause \r\n\r\nLexoRank code uses a custom SQL select statement to get rank rows and limits the results using a db specific clause. In Oracle's case this is the pseudocolumn ROWNUM. \r\n\r\nWe use this column to limit the results, but in a wrong way. We want a query to be sorted by the order by clause before limiting the results. The way we use it will mean we get the first n rows and then sort those rows based on the order by clause. \r\n\r\nhttp://docs.oracle.com/cd/B28359_01/server.111/b28286/pseudocolumns009.htm#SQLRF00255\r\n\r\nh3.Workaround \r\n\r\nRollback the JIRA Agile add-on to 6.3.13.1 as per the below steps. \r\n\r\n(!) {color:red}*The only version that can be rolled back to is 6.3.13.1. Any other version will cause significant problems*{color}. (!) \r\n\r\n# Unlock the rank fields as per [How to unlock a Locked field|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/AGILEKB/How+to+unlock+a+Locked+field]. \r\n# From JIRA Administration > Issues > Custom Fields (left side menu), rename the rank fields to something else, for example Rank (LexoRank). \r\n# Rename the old (Obsolete) fields to their original name 'Rank'. \r\n# From JIRA Administration > Manage Add-ons, uninstall JIRA Agile. \r\n# Stop JIRA. \r\n# Roll-back the JIRA Agile version in the database with the following SQL: \r\n{code:SQL} \r\nUPDATE propertynumber SET propertyvalue = 42 WHERE id = (SELECT id FROM propertyentry WHERE property_key = 'GreenHopper.Upgrade.Latest.Upgraded.Version'); \r\nUPDATE propertystring SET propertyvalue = '42' WHERE id = (SELECT id FROM propertyentry WHERE property_key = 'com.pyxis.greenhopper.jira:build'); \r\n{code} \r\n# Start JIRA. \r\n# Install the previous version of JIRA Agile [6.3.13.1|http://maven.atlassian.com/content/repositories/atlassian-public/com/atlassian/jira/plugins/jira-greenhopper-plugin/6.3.13.1/jira-greenhopper-plugin-6.3.13.1.jar].

Expected Behavior\r\nThe board would load in the new tab, as it is loaded when clicking directly on \"View on Board\".\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Behavior\r\nJIRA cannot resolve the URL correctly, and therefore JIRA only displays its header and footer. \r\n\r\nh4. Note\r\nThe problem seem to be the last part of the URL when opening on a new tab. If the complete URL is:\r\n{noformat:borderStyle=dashed| borderColor=#6A8EB3 |bgColor=#F8F8F8}\r\nhttp://ecrmac-05:8080/jira627/secure/GHGoToBoard.jspa?issueId=10000&inline=true\r\n{noformat}\r\nRemoving the {{&inline=true}} from the URL in the new tab will cause the board to be displayed correctly.\r\n\r\nThis is a regression of GHS-8630, but it can be reproduced on JIRA Agile 6.3.13.1 as well.",

      "description": "In prior versions of JA (I believe 6.2 and below?), one could quickly drag  an issue in a sprint to a different, off-page position on the Plan view of the rapid boards using the multitouch features on the Mac trackpad.\r\n\r\nFor example, if I wanted to grab and issue and drag it two pages down to reorder it in a spring, I would simply do a \"hard\" click on the trackpad to select the issue, and then simultaneously do a two-finger swipe with my other fingers in order to flick and very quickly scroll the sprint up or down, and then release the hard click of the issue when it was in the right place.\r\n\r\nIn JA 6.3+, the two-finger swipe no longer works when I have the hard click depressed to \"pick up\" an issue. In order to accomplish the same task, I need to drag the issue down past the edge of the window, and then wait while it s.l.o.w.l.y drags down.\r\n\r\nThis problem is made more infuriating because dragging an issue off the end of the sprint in Safari causes the sprint to scroll down only a tiny bit...and it then stops completely. I need to jiggle the trackpad to keep moving the issue down again, which is a very, very slow operation, and it stops moving whenever I stop moving the pointer.\r\n\r\nThis makes it take 5-10X as long to reposition a single issue if one has a lot of issues to move over.\r\n\r\nThe same problems occur in Chrome as well.",

This issue was initially found in JIRA Agile 6.4.0+, the specific cause for this issue found and was resolved in the JIRA Agile 6.4.2 release. It has been however found following to this release that subsequent similar issues have been seen where is it not possible to rank issues in JIRA Agile. \r\n\r\nIt is understood that the cause of this issue after the 6.4.2 release is different to the initial bug, and that it may have something to do with specific database configuration or data being in an inconsistent state due to the previous bug. One of these issues is exposed within the Oracle Database server and has been logged in the following bug: GHS-10910\r\n\r\nIf customers have run into this problem and are not currently on 6.4.2 it is recommended that they immediately upgrade to the latest version of JIRA Agile as this should resolve their problems.\r\n\r\nIf the upgrade does not fix the problem customers will need to trigger a *balance*, details on how to perform this are specified below.\r\n\r\nIf the *balance* does not work and you are on an Oracle Database please follow the steps below entitled *Upgrade Notes for JIRA Agile 6.4.2*, it is possible you have run into GHS-10910 please follow that for updates.\r\n\r\nIn other cases please contact https://support.atlassian.com, if customers urgently require their JIRA Agile to be functional again please follow the *Rollback the plugin* steps below.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nMichael Andreacchio\r\nJIRA Support Team Lead\r\n\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\nIssues are not able to be ranked in JIRA Agile 6.4.x.

      "description": "h3. Summary\r\n\r\nEvery load of the Rapid Boards retrieves the sprint custom field ID from the database. The way the code is structured is such that the method used to retrieve the data is synchronised - this means any latency on that retrieval can cause significant thread congestion, presenting in an instance appearing to be unresponsive or experiencing performance problems.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nLoad the rapid view board under high load.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nThe board consistently loads without error.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nOne of the database retrieval operations may take some time to complete, if this occurs congestion can apply to a number of threads. In worse-case 10 to 100s of threads may block waiting for the operation to complete.\r\n\r\nh3. Verification\r\n\r\nReview the thread dumps to verify if there is congestion on the {{com.atlassian.greenhopper.service.sprint.SprintCustomFieldServiceImpl}} monitor, specifically there are a number of threads waiting for it as per the attached screenshot. They can also be analysed with the following:\r\n\r\n{noformat}\r\ngrep \"waiting to lock.*SprintCustomFieldServiceImpl\" jira_threads* | awk '{print $1}' |sort |uniq -c\r\n   1 jira_threads.1424257020.txt:\r\n  42 jira_threads.1424689917.txt:\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nIn {{jira_threads.1424689917.txt}} we can see 42 threads are waiting - this would imply that thread dump is affected with that problem.\r\n\r\nh3. Notes\r\n\r\nUpgrading to JIRA 6.2 or higher has been known to improve the problem.",
