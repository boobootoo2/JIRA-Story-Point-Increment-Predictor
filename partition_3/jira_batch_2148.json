Default space templates differ from ordinary page templates in that they do not present the user with a form to complete, so variables should be limited to those listed above.\n\n(Source - [Customising Default Space Content|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Customising+Default+Space+Content?focusedCommentId=405046471#comment-405046471])\n\nIt feels like a pretty serious limitation to me. If custom fields can be prompted when creating a new page within a space, why can't there be custom fields when creating a new space? I'd argue that sometimes it's even more useful. Because every space is usually attached to a project, it makes sense to speed up project bootstrapping by providing coworkers with a form that requests things like:\n* Project URL (e.g. test server, production server, etc.)\n* Brief project description\n* JIRA URL (though it's a shame I have to manually assign links between JIRA and Confluence every time, jumping between the two within the same project should be easier)\n\nAnd use that information to generate a more useful space homepage. \nThis would obviously be faster than first creating a homepage with default contents, hitting edit and inserting information into appropriate places inside the page (which can be long).\n\nBut besides speed considerations, it would also be a mechanism to *require* people fill out some minimal project information when starting. That is important too.",

As documentation says that we need to do upgrades incrementally across major version, but that is the following exception. So we would fix by adding this message:\n\n{quote}\nThe only exception to this rule is if you are upgrading from 3.5.x to 5.0.x or above, and you have file system links in your pages. In this case, we recommend that you go directly to 5.0.3 from 3.5.x.\n\nFor more information see: CONF-23575\n{quote}\nAs site note, we already added the message [here|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Upgrading+Confluence].\n\nFor the Tech Writers, do you guys agree about having a note there?

This information needs to remain confidential to himself and the finance team until the end of the quarter.  However, there is no option to restrict the page prior to saving it when using a template which means that upon saving, anyone who is a watcher of the finance space will now that bill has started the report and potentially see what information is there if Bill forgets to add the additional restrictions.\n\nWhat would alleviate the above would be either the ability to add restrictions when creating a page from a template.

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFSERVER-30780].\n  {panel}\n\nIt's frustrating that the PDF Export feature offered in Confluence is basically broken for international users at the moment as the default fonts that are used do not have non-latin characters.\n\nAs a workaround, one can upload their own custom font that has the desired character set ([Creating PDF in Another Language|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/AOD/Creating+PDF+in+Another+Language?src=search]), however:\n* Only one font face is supported (see CONF-30779)\n* Only one font style is supported (e.g. bold, italic, monospace, see CONF-10048)\n* OnDemand users can't even do it themselves and need to ask support staff to upload the custom font for them\n* In any way it's quite a bit of extra work to do\n\nAs you can see, even the currently known workarounds (which can be pretty time-consuming to execute) have serious limitations because, clearly, most technical documents make use of different font styles (including monospace for code inserts) and font faces (at least two typefaces are normally used in a document - one for headings and another for body text).\n\nThen, even if embedding multiple fonts and font styles is supported, it's likely that the user would have to manually edit the PDF Stylesheet to configure different fonts/styles for different elements on the page (headings, body text, inline code, code blocks, quotes, etc.) to acually make efficient use of the new fonts and make the documents look decent.\n\nAnother concern with substituting fonts for PDF export and applying appropriate stylesheets to use them would be that the result PDF documents would very likely look different from their screen versions as the PDF stylesheet is of course used only for PDFs. Maybe it would be better to allow injecting fonts and custom stylesheets not just for export but for normal display of pages? But that's another topic.\n\nTo sum up, the functionality of embedding custom fonts and applying custom styles for PDF (and Word?) export feels like a hack and is not intended to be used extensively. Further developing that functionality without revisiting it completely looks like a road to nowhere to me.\n\n*For now, please at least support international characters in PDF export out of the box!*\n\n---\nAll the (possibly) related discussions I've found so far that may need to be updated/revisited/linked to this one:\n* [CONF-26908: International characters in code macros dissapear after exporting page as PDF|CONF-26908]\n* [CONF-28348: Administrators are unable to upload font files for PDF Export anymore|CONF-28348]\n* [Atlassian Answers: International characters and PDF export|https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/63504/international-characters-and-pdf-export]\n* [Documentation: Creating PDF in Another Language|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/AOD/Creating+PDF+in+Another+Language?src=search] (may need to be updated)",

We have organised several spaces in Confluence. Each space belongs to particular topic like UI Development, CMS Development, Component Library, System Integration, .etc. \n \nThough, we need to classify all pages in all spaces against global categories (category is represented as list of attributes), for example: Skills = { .NET, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery}; Platform = { Linux, Windows, Android, iOS }; Programming Language = { C#, C++, VB }; .etc.\n \nSo we would like to have an ability to specify multiple category attributes for any page in any space. So, for example, the page could be associated with Skills = { CSS, jQuery}; Platform = { Windows }; Programming Language = { C#, VB };\n\nIt also needs to be user friendly so Confluence content editors could use specify each category attributes in the similar manner in which labels are currently specified in Confluence. Though, instead of adding attributes in bulk, to a single labels list, the attributes should be added to the corresponding category. \n\nIn addition, all exiting categories attributes mus be available in all spaces and should be globally searchable.\n\nIt would be extremely handy  to have some features in Confluence to support this scenario. \n\nE.g.: if it would be JIRA we would just add new multi-select fields for each category, with a pre-defined number of attributes, which can be selected for this category",

This space contains all system and operational documentation of our JIRA instance. Information not so interesting to the organization. However, the blog in the JIRA space is used for information about upgrades, new features, downtime etc. This is very interesting to the users.

Perhaps when it is clicked there is one item in the drop down which says 'no application links are established' as opposed to doing nothing.

For example, if logged into Confluence as a user from AD directory, the AD directory will not be able to be modified. Normally we recommend logging in as the local Confluence admin in order to edit other directories.\n\nHowever, when Windows authentication is enabled, only users from the [Active Directory Domain|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/SPCON/Access+Confluence+using+Integrated+Windows+Authentication+via+IIS+with+SP+2010#AccessConfluenceusingIntegratedWindowsAuthenticationviaIISwithSP2010-Overview] can authenticate. To get around this, administrators will need to disable the authenticating method back to default restart Confluence in order to log in as the local admin. The application will require another restart to re-enable Windows authentication.\n\nThis improvement request is to investigate if there's a better way to edit the AD directory in Confluence when Windows authentication is enabled.",
