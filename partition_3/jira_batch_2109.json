Pages are open to viewing or editing by default, but you can restrict either viewing or editing to certain users or groups if you need to.\n\nDon't forget, every page in Confluence lives within a space, and space permissions allow the space admin to revoke permission to view content for the whole space. Even the ability to apply restrictions to pages is controlled by the 'restrict pages' space permission.\n{quote}\n\nh3. Steps to reproduce\n# Create a space that has a group able to administer it (in Confluence Cloud this defaults to \"administrators\").\n# Create a two users, Alice and Brianna, add both to the administrators group.\n# Log in as Alice, create a page in the space.\n# Add a restriction to the page so only Alice can edit or view it.\n# Log in as Brianna, visit the Restricted Pages section in Space Admin.\n\nh3. Expected results\nBrianna can modify the page permissions because she's an administrator.\n\nh3. Actual results\nBrianna can _remove_ the \"Only Alice can view/edit this page\" permissions, but nothing else. She can't add herself or anyone else, which isn't helpful if the page needs to remain restricted but additional individuals or groups need access to it.

Suggested Solution\nAllow admin to monitor mail queue status over REST API calls\n\nh3.

Summary\nA page with the \"Content by label\" macro, combined with an Excerpt Display of \"Rich content\", will render itself leading to a stack overflow.\n\n*This causes:*\n* high CPU usage with more than 10MB of log every second.\n* Confluence becomes unresponsive until the overflow finishes.\n* Going to the page can also return an Error page when the page is displayed.\n* The page may render with infinite traces of itself.\n* In Cloud the page will automatically try to refresh every 2 minutes if window is left open and will trigger the problem again.\n\nh3. Environment\n* Confluence 6.0 or 5.9\n* Content by Label macro\n\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\n# Create a new page\n# Add a \"Content by label\" macro, configured as:\n#* Label: \"testing\"\n#* Excerpt Display: \"rich content\"\n# Save the page\n# Add a label to the page: \"testing\"\n# Refresh the page (May require 2 or 3 refreshes for the label to be updated)\n\nh3. Expected Results\nPage renders quickly and no error are shown in the logs.\n\nh3. Actual Results\nLog shows many errors:\n{noformat}\n2016-01-08 13:19:53.758403500 2016-01-08 13:19:53,749 ERROR [http-bio-1990-exec-4] [xhtml.view.macro.ViewMacroMarshaller] marshalInternal Error

Now we have another problem and I'm not sure it's related to the upgrade because it's not consistent, so here goes.\n\nWe use Confluence for our manuals and are trying to single source, so we want to keep all the images for a manual/product in one place to make they easy to upgrade and use multiple places. It's always been easy just to paste them into a page that we call an image gallery. When we use them, the remain attached to that page but appear   in the manual wherever placed. But the manual itself doesn't have attachments.\n\nAfter upgrade one of our team noticed that when the copies and pastes, the manual page now has an attachment. Bad.  We can still insert with no attachment but copy/paste is so much easier and faster, and our people like fast and easy.\n\nI did a test in a test paste and the image copy/paste worked just like it used to: No attachment. But back in the space he was working in, my test showed that the attachments were showing up on the manual page.  \n\nSo what is going on? Do you have any idea? Why is this feature acting differently in two different spaces and which way is it supposed to work now.  And can we get back our fast and easy method. Our team and other contributors like it as it was.\n\nThank you for any help with this problem. Confluence is very important to our business. We need to understand what is happening.",

This can be consistently replicated when there are 200+ attachments in a Confluence page. The issues seems to be the number of attachments since testing with 1 large file (e.g. 1 GB) rather than 200 medium-sized files does not cause the same issue.\n\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\n# Create 200+ test attachments. The following Linux script can be used to create 200 txt files from an exisitng Confluence log file {code} for f in {0..200}\ndo\n    cat atlassian-confluence.log > \"$f.txt\"\ndone\t{code}\n# Log in to Confluence\n# Create a test space and test page\n# Drag and drop the 200 test files to the page\n# Keep an eye on the CPU usage. The CPU should be stable at this point\n# Edit the Confluence page and add the Attachments macro\n# Save the page\n# Notice the CPU will spike and hang\n# Disable the 'Confluence Attachments Plugin' and notce the CPU goes down almost instantly\n\nh3. Expected Results\nThe CPU does not hang for long periods of time.\n\nh3. Actual Results\nThe CPU will spike and hang. \n\nSometimes the following will be displayed in the atlassian-confleunce.log file\n\n{noformat}\nERROR [http-nio-8081-exec-1800]

Having done this, we had one idea about more effective working with the resulting table and two ideas of more detailed information.\n# 1.  As you can see on image \"conjiramac1.png\" we would like be able to sort the columns of the displayed report. You could do this either on the ready report OR you could do this in the \"Columns to display\" by dragging and dropping the columns to the place where they should be (see image \"conjiramac2.png\"). I think, the easiest way would be to enable drag and drop in the \"Columns to display\"-Field. If you want to change the order today, you have to delete the choosen fields and have to put them in the order manually.\n# 2. We are missing a time stamp for the \"Updated\"-Field (see image \"conjiramac1.png\")\n# 3. We would like to see the Sprint Start- and End-Date.",

Problem Definition\nBackground:\nI have a large wiki and have sub-pages that often have the same name.\nTo distinguish them, I've been namespacing them by appending the top-level category they fall under.\nExample: \"Languages (Programming)\"\nProblem:\nWhen I then search for the top-level category page, most of the results are for those sub-pages that also have the category-name in their title, and/or have the word \"program\" show up a bunch in the body.\nExample: I search for \"Programming\" to get the top-level \"Programming\" page, and instead I get a bunch of the sub-pages as results, like \"Languages (Programming)\".\n\nh3. Suggested Solution\nProposed solution:\nPrioritize pages for which the title of that page is an exact match for the search query.\nPrioritize pages for which the words in the query make up the largest % of the words in those pages' titles.\n\nh3. Note:\nI understand that CONF-9261 says that it does something along the lines of what I'm recommending. (\"Improve search by promoting exact matches\")\nI'm asking for a refinement of the way it works.\n",

However, if you remove anyone from a space as of 5.9.2, _all_ space watchers for that space are double checked, and removed if necessary. \nSo, if you have any space watchers that you'd like to remove from a particular space, you can re-add one of those users to the space and then remove them again. That will check and remove any watchers for that space that should no longer be watchers.\n\nAll space watchers that should no longer exist will be removed as part of the upgrade task that will run in Confluence 6.",
