Notes\r\n* Converting is mandatory to enter Japanese. This is affecting really bad because user will not able to search for any questions\r\n* The background for this issue may be similar with the following tickets. The Enter key for converting is somehow skipped and treated as a next action, which is in this case, selecting the next button(\"Ask Question\").

This button is arguably the most important button in the GUI, as the WYSIWYG editor doesn't always produce the desired results.\r\n\r\nOn a personal level, I would say that the people who came up with the new button placement, approved it, and implemented it never ever used Confluence for any extended period of time. It's a change for the change's sake, as I can't imagine anyone look at the ~1500px of empty horizontal space and say: \"it's not enough to place three or four buttons there. Let's only show two and hide the other two behind a drop-down menu\".\r\n\r\nEven if you argue for a mobile look, hardly anyone edits Confluence pages on the mobile. And even if they do, there' s plenty of space even in the mobile view if you remove/shorten the otherwise unnecessarily\u00a0long \"Latest changes have been saved\".\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nOriginal Tweet: \"I do realize that there's just not too much space at the bottom of the screen, but perhaps, just perhaps, hear me out, you could possibly *not* hide the extremely useful \"preview\" button in a totally useless two-item menu?\" ([https://twitter.com/dmitriid/statuses/1076027320316674048]))\r\n\r\n\u00a0",

I recognize that it's been a while since you've heard from the team, so I'm here with the update we owe you.\r\n\r\nSolving the need for attachment links is high on our priority list. Currently, we are focused on critical work to improve table formatting and performance for Confluence Cloud pages  - problems that also affect a very broad pool of users.\r\n\r\nEven though the solution to attachment links seems simple, there are a few technical considerations we need to tackle. We're actively investigating the best solutions to those problems and hope to start working on this in the next 6 - 9 months. We acknowledge that the delay on implementing this feature is frustrating for many of you. We will keep you updated on our progress.\r\n\r\nIf you want to chat live, please grab time with me here: [Divya Calendly Link | http://example.com]\r\n\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\n{panel:title=Status Update 3 December 2020|borderStyle=solid|borderColor=#ff7f7f|titleBGColor=#ff7f7f|bgColor=#e5e5e5}\r\nHi all!\r\n\u00a0\r\nMy name\u2019s Jonno and I\u2019m a PM on the Atlassian Editor in cloud. This is an update on the status of this ticket/request.\r\n\u00a0\r\nThis ticket alludes to a number of different features:\r\n # Being able to view an attachment inline vs having a thumbnail that takes up an entire line.\r\n # Being able to link to an attachment that exists elsewhere in Confluence.\r\n\r\nWe have a roadmap item in Q3 (Jan - March) to start work on the first problem - being able to view an attachment inline vs having a thumbnail that takes up an entire line. *To be clear - this item will also include the missing ability to insert an already present image within the attachments of the specific page.*\r\n\r\nWe do not yet have roadmap work assigned to the second problem - being able to link to an attachment that exists elsewhere in Confluence. We are, however, exploring what we could do in this area.\u00a0\r\n\r\nI\u2019ll continue to update this ticket as I have more to share.\r\n\u00a0\r\nIf you ever want to have a chat in person about the new editing experience, my calendar is always open to book in a 1:1 Zoom call -\u00a0[https://calendly.com/jkatahanas/editor|https://calendly.com/jkatahanas/editor?month=2020-12].\r\n\u00a0\r\nPlease keep the feedback coming \ud83d\ude42\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nCheers,\r\n\u00a0\r\nJonno | PM for the Atlassian Editor (Cloud)\r\n{panel}\r\nh3. Problem Definition\r\n\r\nWith the latest [editing improvements|https://confluence.atlassian.com/confcloud/confluence-editing-improvements-945107733.html], the ability to display an attachment file as a link has been removed from the Link Macro. It is now only possible to link to known pages with this macro.\u00a0\r\n\r\nDisplaying a link to an attachment in a page is only possible by attaching it using a macro directly or as a preview.\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nProvide ability to link text to attachments using the Link macro.\u00a0\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nBy using the [Attachments macro|https://confluence.atlassian.com/confcloud/attachments-macro-724765160.html], you can obtain the URL of an attachment and link text to that by pasting the link into the Link Macro.\r\nh3. Workaround 2\r\n\r\nBy visiting the `Attachments` page through the `\u2022\u2022\u2022` menu, you can right-click on the attachment links and `copy link address`. Then use that as a text/blue link.",

Problem Definition\r\nIt would be beneficial to add a macro on a parent page that can provide the last date, time, and the username the parent page along with its child pages was modified. This way the administrator can track pages that have been created but was not recently updated or referenced. This is useful for organizations with large deployment to clean up their instances and keep them up-to-date.\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\nAdd a macro on the parent page that will provide the last updated date/time and username for that page and its child pages.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\nUsing a database query, we can list all versions and modified dates of each page within a space:\r\n{code:sql}\r\nselect s.spacename, c.title, c.lastmoddate\r\nfrom content c\r\njoin spaces s on s.spaceid = c.spaceid\r\nwhere contenttype = 'PAGE'\r\nand prevver is null\r\nand spacename =\u00a0\u2018<SPACENAME>';\r\n{code}\r\n* The {{<SPACENAME>}} must be replaced with the\u00a0particular Space\u00a0name in concern.\r\n* If you want the information to be reported on a page, you can do so using a third-party plugin [Bob Swift's SQL for Confluence|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/org.swift.confluence.sql/server/overview].",
