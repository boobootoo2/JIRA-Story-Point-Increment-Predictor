      "description": "h3. Issue Summary\r\n\r\nWhen integrity checks run, they loop over each pull request in each repository and, if the pull request has a merge activity, the checks verify that the merge commit still exists. If it doesn't, an attempt is made to reopen the pull request.\r\n\r\nDepending on the repository's state on disk, however, it may not be possible to reopen the pull request. Some examples of why a pull request might fail to reopen include:\r\n* Another pull request is already open between the same two branches\r\n* The source and/or target branch for the pull request do not exist\r\n* The source branch exists, but does not reference any commits that are not already referenced by the target branch (nothing new to merge)\r\n\r\nIf the source branch does not exist in the repository, the pull request is updated to mark it as declined instead of merged to allow re-pushing the source branch and reopening the pull request later. However, when declining, the system doesn't first check to verify that it hasn't already declined the pull request previously. This can result in multiple \"Integrity checker DECLINED the pull request\" activities, one for each time integrity checks are run.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n* Restore a partial backup, or a backup that was taken without locking both the filesystem and database, such that the database includes pull requests which are marked as merged but for which the repository no longer includes the merge commit or the source branch\r\n* Trigger integrity checks (Data Center license only)\r\n* Trigger integrity checks again\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nPull requests are transitioned from \"Merged\" to \"Declined\" the first time integrity checks are run, but are not re-declined the second time when they still can't be reopened.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nEach run of the integrity checks adds a new decline activity to the pull requests.\r\n\r\nSome related logging:\r\n{noformat}\r\n2019-03-15 03:47:35,811 WARN  [Caesium-1-2]  c.a.s.i.i.DefaultIntegrityCheckReporter PROJ/repo[1]: Pull request #1 is marked merged but the merge commit could not be found on the target ref. Trying to restore integrity by reopening\r\n2019-03-15 03:47:35,848 WARN  [Caesium-1-2]  c.a.s.i.i.DefaultIntegrityCheckReporter PROJ/repo[1]: Pull request #1 could not be reopened, declining instead.

Workaround\r\n\r\nThere are no workarounds. This is purely a cosmetic issue, and doesn't impact any functionality either while integrity checks are running or after they've completed. Aside from having multiple declined activities in their overview, such pull requests can still be viewed, and can still be reopened later (assuming their source branch is re-pushed with new commits that are not already on the target branch).",

Issue Summary\r\n\r\nWhen a user is authenticated via SSH, if the user's account is managed by a remote Crowd or LDAP server, that server is checked to ensure the user is still active. Under high SSH load (read: _concurrent_ SSH load), these active checks can back up, resulting in a large number of SSH threads blocked on them.\r\n\r\nPrior to Bitbucket Server 5.10, which includes a configurable limit on the number of concurrent SSH connections (see BSERV-10714), the build-up of SSH threads blocked in {{isUserActive}} checks can result in an {{OutOfMemoryError}}. In Bitbucket Server 5.10 and newer, the build-up will result in SSH new SSH connections being rejected until the backlog clears.\r\n\r\nThe \"top\" frames on SSH thread stacks will look similar to this:\r\n{noformat}\r\n\"ssh-scm-request-handler\" #1645084 daemon prio=5 os_prio=0 tid=0x00007f5d68691000 nid=0x4bd5 waiting on condition [0x00007f5adbd3d000]\r\n   java.lang.Thread.State: WAITING (parking)\r\n    at sun.misc.Unsafe.park(Native Method)\r\n    - parking to wait for  <0x00000007b4c9e6e8> (a java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock$NonfairSync)\r\n    at java.util.concurrent.locks.LockSupport.park(LockSupport.java:175)\r\n    at java.util.concurrent.locks.AbstractQueuedSynchronizer.parkAndCheckInterrupt(AbstractQueuedSynchronizer.java:836)\r\n    at java.util.concurrent.locks.AbstractQueuedSynchronizer.acquireQueued(AbstractQueuedSynchronizer.java:870)\r\n    at java.util.concurrent.locks.AbstractQueuedSynchronizer.acquire(AbstractQueuedSynchronizer.java:1199)\r\n    at java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock$NonfairSync.lock(ReentrantLock.java:209)\r\n    at java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock.lock(ReentrantLock.java:285)\r\n    at com.atlassian.cache.memory.DelegatingCache.acquireLockFor(DelegatingCache.java:474)\r\n    at com.atlassian.cache.memory.DelegatingCache.remove(DelegatingCache.java:244)\r\n    at com.atlassian.stash.internal.user.DefaultUserService.isUserActive(DefaultUserService.java:430)\r\n{noformat}\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nOne workaround is to disable the {{isUserActive}} check. That can be done by setting {{auth.remote.enabled=false}} in {{bitbucket.properties}}. _*Please Note*_: Disabling the active check may result in users who are disabled in or removed from LDAP continuing to have SSH access for some period of time afterwards, until their account details are synchronized and their account is disabled in or removed from Bitbucket Server. For systems using delegated authentication setups, this may mean the user retains SSH access indefinitely. (See BSERV-8685)\r\n\r\nIt may also be possible to make the issue less likely to occur by increasing the TTL for the {{isUserActive}} cache, or, if the organization has a large number of users, by increasing the cache's size. The default TTL and size are:\r\n{noformat}\r\n# If \"permissions.cache.users.max\" has been overridden in bitbucket.properties, that value\r\n# will also be used for \"auth.remote.cache.cacheSize\". If \"permissions.cache.users.max\"\r\n# has not been overridden, the default is 5000\r\nauth.remote.cache.cacheSize=${permissions.cache.users.max}\r\n# The TTL is defined in seconds, and defaults to 2 minutes\r\nauth.remote.cache.ttl=120\r\n{noformat}",

Which filters will be available will depend on the server's Git version, and is not something Bitbucket Data Center controls directly. For example, to use git clone --filter=tree:0 requires Git 2.20+ on both server and client. If Git <2.18 is installed on the server, git clone --filter will not be available.\r\n\r\nPartial clones will be enabled by default, if the server is running Git 2.18+. Administrators who do not want partial clones to be available can set plugin.bitbucket-git.hosting.allow-filter=false in bitbucket.properties to disable the feature, even if Git 2.18+ is installed on the server. For some instances disabling this may be desirable, because some filter combinations supported by Git are extremely expensive for the server to calculate and result in significantly higher server load than a normal full or shallow clone.\r\n\r\nOrganizations that plan to make heavy use of partial clones should ensure their Git clients are 2.19 or newer. While Git 2.18 clients can use git clone --filter, 2.19.0 introduced a change which allows the server side to detect that requests after the first are part of a partial clone setup, which allows the server to avoid caching the resulting packs.\r\n\r\n_Note: This is for Bitbucket Data Center only.

Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nSince Git 2.18, Git protocol v2 has introduced the --filter flag to enable [partial clones|https://github.com/git/git/blob/v2.19.0/Documentation/technical/partial-clone.txt]\r\n\r\nThis will allow users to clone specific subdirectories of a repository only.\r\nh3. Why this is important\r\n\r\nThis will increase cloning performance on large repositories.",

Summary\r\n\r\nA public code search API for companies or startups that host Bitbucket Servers (as their own version of Bitbucket).\r\n\r\nSimilar to Github's Search functionality and API, you can search through all the code and files using either keyterms or regexes.\r\n\r\nYou can also use this code search to scan through all public repos (that are not your own).\r\n\r\nh3. Background\r\n\r\nVendor is currently hosting a bitbucket instance, and are using the [Bitbucket Server APIs|https://developer.atlassian.com/server/bitbucket/reference/rest-api/]. They are currently looking into using Bitbucket to do code searches with regex or key terms such as the phrase \"AWS Key.\" Looking at current SERVER REST APIs, nothing seems suitable for a code search. \r\n\r\nThey wanted something like the Code Search API from Github - https://developer.github.com/v3/search/#search-code)\r\n\r\nUse Cases:\r\n  1. A user could quickly find code sections from all of their projects/repos with one SERVER REST API call.\r\n 2. A user could do a code search to check if any of their buckets/repos have passwords/AWS keys in them.\r\n\r\nBenefits:\r\n1. Reduce the time it is needed to do quick lookups of code in repositories.\r\n2. Potentially reduce the security risk of individuals (within the company) publishing passwords or AWS keys to public repos.\r\n\r\nh3. Notes\r\n\r\nFeature request raised in DEVHELP",

These changes break Bitbucket Server's ability to display conflicts in pull request diffs, resulting in the system displaying a diff between the common ancestor and the tip of the source branch rather than a diff between the tip of the target branch and a theoretical merge (the normal diff shown).\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nAs Git 2.21 has not yet been formally released (these behavior changes were observed in 2.21 release candidates), administrators should not upgrade to it. After 2.21 has been officially released, _until it is added to our [Supported Platforms|https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/supported-platforms-776640981.html]_, administrators should not upgrade to it. This type of issue is why we strongly discourage trying to run Bitbucket Server with versions of Git we haven't explicitly listed as supported. For administrators relying on repositories like the Ubuntu Git Maintainers PPA, we recommend pinning the version to avoid unexpected upgrades while updating other packages.\r\n\r\nFor anyone who _has_ upgraded, the only workaround is to downgrade back to a supported version of Git. It will require changes to Bitbucket Server's {{git merge}} handling code in order for it to handle Git 2.21's conflict output and work tree state correctly.\r\nh3. Note\r\n\r\nThis is only relevant for the Git version installed on the server where Bitbucket Server is _running_.
