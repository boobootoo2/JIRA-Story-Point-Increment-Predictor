There is a manual gate to deploy to production.\r\n\r\nWhat the team would like to do is:\r\n * To be able to trigger a \"fire and forget\" deployment to both production regions. Ideally the regions would be deployed in parallel (currently not possible due to BCLOUD-16650), although it would be OK to do it sequentially, provided that the operator does not have to wait for one region to finish its deployment before they can trigger the second region.\r\n * To be able to deploy individually to the regions independently and in any sequence. At the moment, the deployments can only occur in the sequence described in the Yaml file. If the Yaml file contains the East,West sequence, then it is not possible for an operator to deploy first to West.\r\n\r\nBamboo Deployments offers the flexibility do accomplish these goals. The operator can independently trigger deployments to each region, in any order. The operator can also trigger the deployments to both regions without having to wait for a region to finish in order to press the button to deploy to the other region. It would be great to have the same flexibility in BB Pipelines.",

      "description": "h3. Issue Summary\r\nSpecifically, when using 'docker caching' in Pipelines the time taken to compress and upload cache is not being added to the \"Build teardown\" step. Therefore, the total time accrued during the build with docker caching involved would show a different total build time when compared to the sum of the time taken for each individual step.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n* Run a pipelines build with docker caching enabled\r\n* Pull a heavy image during the build.\r\n* The docker cache compress and upload time in Build Teardown step will not be involved. Thus the total build time will be different when compared to the time taken by each individual step.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n* The Build Teardown step in pipelines build should include the time taken by docker cache compression and upload.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\n* The time taken by docker caching compression and upload is not included within build teardown step. However, this is not the case with custom caching and the issue is just restricted to docker caching.\r\n\r\n(on) That being said, all features and billing seem to be in order and the total time taken for the build is correct.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nThe only workaround here is to reach out to support to know about the actual time taken for the build teardown step if docker caching is involved.",

Issue Summary\r\n\r\nDear Atlassian,\r\n\r\nI find the behavior of the PR overview diff objectionable.\r\n\r\nThe diff that is shown on the overview page of a PR seems to be generated on the fly against the latest master branch of the project and I would to argue that this is not the right thing to do.\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Step 1 : Have a Git repository with some files on Bitbucket cloud.\r\n # Step 2 : Clone the repository locally.\r\n # Step 3 : Create a local branch\r\n # Step 4 : Modify a file.\r\n # Step 5 : Commit this file.\r\n # Step 6 : Push your branch to Bitbucket.\r\n # Step 7 : Create a PR off the branch.\r\n # Step 8 : Locally create a new branch from the master.\r\n # Step 9 : Modify the same file from step (4) in a conflicting way.\r\n # Step 10 : Commit your changes locally.\r\n # Step 11 : Push the new branch.\r\n # Step 12 : Create a PR off the new branch.\r\n # Step 13 : Merge the PR.\r\n # Step 14 : Navigate to the overview page of the PR from step (7).\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nThe diff shown is unchanged, i.e. you see the same diff as the one you were seeing after step (7).\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nThe diff now shows the conflicts that have been caused by the PR from step (12).\r\n\r\nThe below exception is thrown in the xxxxxxx.log file:\r\n{noformat}\r\n...NA..\r\n{noformat}\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nCurrently there is no known workaround for this behavior. A workaround will be added here when available\r\n\r\nThe described behavior impedes the review process, because now, instead of seeing the original diff, reviewers see the diff against the latest master branch and there are conflicts in this diff that make reviewing hard/impossible.\r\n\r\nCompeting products (Github's PR's and ReviewBoard's review requests are two such products that I have some experience with) always show the diff against the commit that was used to create the PR branch.\r\n\r\nOf course when there are conflicts you are required to resolve them before merging your change, but the point is that you shouldn't need to resolve them the moment these conflicts occur, i.e. the review process should not be affected by conflict resolution.",

While those reviewers do have access to the primary repo, they not have access to my private fork.\r\n\r\nWhat I'm proposing is to allow the PR author the ability to grant editor access to a PR, which would automatically allow the editors read/write access to the branch in the fork, but then remove that access once the PR has been merged. This would also not count towards the 5 user limit of the private fork. In order to do this today, you have to explicitly grant a user read/write access to the repo and then remove that access once the PR is merged. This work flow is a bit clunky and due to the 5 user limit, limits the number of \"editors\". Also, this helps minimize how long a PR is left open with unresolved tasks if the author is no longer available to update the PR.\r\n\r\n\u00a0",

This makes sense, but it is confusing for the folks coming from Bamboo. In Bamboo, the process to promote a release is the inverse: you first go to the *target environment*\u00a0(where you want to promote the release to), and then select the release to be promoted.\r\n\r\nOne idea would be to move the promote button to in-between the environments. This would increase its discoverability and make it obvious how the releases flow.\r\n\r\n\u00a0",
