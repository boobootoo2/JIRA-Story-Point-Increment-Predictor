Like for example:\nI am on the wifi network 1 and complete a form with multiple fields and settings and then go to another place with my laptop and the laptop connects to another wifi network (I don't always get notified about that) through which the confluence/jira is not available and if I press submit/create/update I am getting an error and the data is gone.. that is terribly bad because I spent about 1h on writing that form and it would be a bit strange to do that in another text editor and paste it in attlassian just to overcome this :( also the bad thing is that the form might have other types of fileds than the texts ones..\n\nDo you think there is a chance for me to have this?\n\nThank you very much!",

We should add a method in a manager that lets you get the old and new attachment IDs so that the plugin devs can write their own upgrade tasks.\n\nCalling the method will be done via a new method in the [compat lib|https://bitbucket.org/slancashire/confluence-attachment-to-ceo-compat/commits/56472132fc3f8e609022c83f7eccca475dcd90d9] that uses reflection to see if the method on the manager exists, or returns an empty result if it does not (nothing to migrate)\n\nUnfortunately our plugin upgrade task infrastructure is not suitable for such an upgrade task - because if they want their plugin to be compatible with both pre 5.7 and 5.7+, and the upgrade task determines it has no work to do pre 5.7, it will never run again.\n\nWe could add something to the compatibility library that when registered as a component runs each time the plugin starts and the user implements an abstract method that does their migration and maybe another that provides a unique string that identifies their plugin. We then write some code to store the fact that the migration has been run.",

This is awesome.\n\nSecondly - I would like to suggest an auto-anchoring mechanism like google does. Usually, when anchoring, it's a sub-header within a specific document. We create those anchors in confluence to reference a sub-feature or a minor issue which can serve many people in the documentation.\n\nI believe it would save a lot of time if you by default anchor any sub-header (all \"h\" hierarchy, 1 to inifinity).\n\nThanks!",

Or maybe it has been and I am too stupid to find/configure it.\n\nMany thanks,\nPatrick",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFSERVER-36250].\n  {panel}\n\nThe fix for CONF-24035 introduced a retry with SSLv3 if a connection fails. However, like workaround implemented in SAL-203 there is no need to retry with SSLv3 - instead enabling TLSv1.1 or higher will address the issue. The issue is actually caused by java not following the TLS rfc. When TLSv1.1 or higher is enabled or the system property {{com.sun.net.ssl.rsaPreMasterSecretFix}} is set to {{true}} java will as per the TLS specification send the same version it supports in the client hello *and* in the PreMasterSecret. Otherwise, the default behaviour when TLSv1.1 is not enabled in client mode (e.g. the default in java 7) is to send the highest enabled version in the client hello and the *active negotiated version* in the PreMasterSecret causing servers (tested against openssl) to reject java's connection.\n\nNote: Oracle has disabled SSLv3 in java 7 update 75 and java 8 update 31, see http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/7u75-relnotes-2389086.html and http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/8u31-relnotes-2389094.html respectively. So attempting to retry with SSlv3 will not work.\n\nPlease fix this issue by removing the copied CustomSSLProtocolSocketFactory class (it was copied from SAL) and setting the HttpClientHttpRetrievalService.DEFAULT_SSL_PROTOCOL based upon what is available in the running JVM. Note: in my quick survey of confluence plugins there was not a single usage or reference the HttpClientHttpRetrievalService.DEFAULT_SSL_PROTOCOL field.",

Steps to Reproduce\n# Go to _Tools_ > _Import Word File_\n# Select a file to upload and Click on next.\n# The error message will appear in the logs, and an error might also generate in the UI.

Expected Results\n\nThe import should be successful.\n\nh3. Actual Results\n\nThe import fails and the tmp file is not removed per the logs.\n \nh3.Workaround\nOne workaround found (with word documents including images) is to remove one of the images, attempt to upload the word doc (it should be successful), and then add the image back in once the page has been created.",

TLSv1.0 was first defined in January 1999 and java 6 supports and uses it as the default client version in TLS handshake.\n\nSSLv3 is old and limits the ciphers that can be used. SSLv3 is also vulnerable to POODLE. We should disable SSLv3 by default and provide a system property to re-enable it.\n\nNote: Java 7 supports TLSv1.1 and TLSv1.2 in client mode but defaults to using TLSv1 in the TLS handshake. We should use TLSv1.1 and TLSv1.2 in client mode TLS in java 7 as well. Java 8 enables TLSv1.1 and TLSv1.2 in client mode(in addition to SSLv3 and TLSv1) and uses TLSv1.2 by default in TLS handshake.\n\nWorkaround:\nUpgrade to Oracle Java 7 update 76 (or higher) or Java 8 update 31(or higher) as these versions disable SSLv3.\nAlternatively, set jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms in <JRE_HOME>/lib/security/java.security to include SSLv3 as per the following example:\n{code}\n# Example:\n#   jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms=MD5, SSLv3, DSA, RSA keySize < 2048\njdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms=SSLv3\n{code}",

I can't find anywhere exactly _what_ those dimensions are, but my bigger problem is that the system provides no feedback whatsoever when this happens. When you apply image effects to a large photo, it lets you do it just fine, but it doesn't display the effect. This leads to a lot of confusion for the user--why isn't it working? Is it a problem with my computer? The image? The page?\n\nIf it were me, I would improve it as follows:\n\n*Improve Documentation*\n# Update the documentation to explain the outer limits of when image effects will be applied\n# When a user applies an effect to an image that is too large, provide feedback to the effect of \"This image is too large for effects to be applied. Please resize to be less than ____px by _____px if you would like to display image effects.\"\n\n*Make the constraints larger*\nImages that are 1600px by 500px should work, but it doesn't. These constraints should be more lenient. Why is there a limit at all? Is it a memory issue (like this [knowledge base|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/CONFKB/Image+effects+are+not+displayed+in+Confluence+5.5+or+later] article implies), or is there another reason?\n\n*To recreate the problem...*\n* Upload an image to the wiki that's bigger than 1599 by 449 pixels. \n* Click on the image, and select \"Properties\" from the pop-up menu\n* Click any of the image effects that appear in the window\n* Save the changes, and observe that the image doesn't look any different.\n* Wish there was feedback to explain why the effect wasn't applied",

There are also good reasons to stick with the default UI, because users benefit from Atlassian's ongoing investment in the Confluence user experience.\n\nHowever, many customers would like the ability to brand their Confluence OnDemand instance beyond the current colour and space logo options.\n\nA happy medium between the two might be to provide some additional header and footer configuration options:\n\n1. Allow a background image in the header and allow the header to grow up to an additional 40px in height, if desired (see attached example). This would make the header the same height as when the \"temporary access to administrative functions\" warning is displayed.\n2. Allow a custom footer, implemented in a similar fashion to the site welcome message that would appear before the current footer (but not replace it). This could be used to create a \"fat footer\" for navigation or links to site terms and conditions etc.\n\nThis custom header would require some modification to the current navigation bar design:\n- include a text only option instead of just logo + text or logo. Ideally the 'home' link text could be defined separately to the Site Title. This is because the customer's logo could instead be included in the background image.\n- change the dimensions of the link hover behaviour so that the background is the same size as the 'Create' button.",

The error should tell the user that the page does not exist (error 404), and not an error such as 503.\n\nFor instance, the following URL will work:\n\n_<instance>_.atlassian.net/wiki/display/DOC/Documentation\n\nHowever, the followings won't:\n\n_<instance>_.atlassian.net/*wki*/display/DOC/Documentation - 'Down for Maintenance'\n_<instance>_.atlassian.net/display/DOC/Documentation - 'Down for Maintenance'",
