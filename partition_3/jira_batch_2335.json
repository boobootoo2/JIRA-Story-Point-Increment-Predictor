      "description": "h3. Update on July 2019\r\n\r\nHi everyone,\r\n\r\nThanks for your feedback. I wanted to let you know that Bitbucket GVFS app is still _experimental._ We reviewed the feedback on this suggestion and recent GVFS(VFS) updates and decided to keep the app as _experimental_ because:\r\n * GVFS is still only supported for Windows clients. Mac one is still under development\r\n * Lack of API documentation - new version of GVFS was released recently and it broke the integration in Bitbucket but, there is no change in API documentation\r\n * There's work going on in Git itself to support [partial clones |https://git-scm.com/docs/partial-clone] and promisor remotes--which would largely obsolete the functionality provided by GVFS\r\n\r\nWe are following the developments in the git community and from Microsoft. If our view on this changes in future then, we will post an update. Please vote/watch to follow the updates. We are keeping this suggestion open to get feedback.\u00a0\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n Imran Khan\r\n Product Manager - Bitbucket Server and Data Center\r\nh2. Update on October 2017\r\n\r\nThe Atlassian Marketplace provides an\u00a0[_experimental_\u00a0add-on for\u00a0Bitbucket Server and Data Center|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.atlassian.bitbucket.server.bitbucket-gvfs/server/overview] that\u00a0adds the server-side support needed to serve GVFS-enabled Git clients. It can be installed on any\u00a0[supported server platform|https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/supported-platforms-776640981.html] and once installed Bitbucket will handle GVFS protocol requests\u00a0for any repository\u00a0without any additional setup,\u00a0from properly configured Git clients.\r\n\r\nFor more information about setting up GVFS on the client side, please see the\u00a0[blog post and linked resources from Microsoft|https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/devops/2017/02/03/announcing-gvfs-git-virtual-file-system/]. As at October 2017, only Windows client support was available.\u00a0[Sourcetree 2.0 and above for Windows is also GVFS aware|https://blog.sourcetreeapp.com/2017/04/27/sourcetree-for-windows-2-0-new-ui-faster-performance-and-microsoft-git-virtual-file-system-support/]\u00a0when used with a GVFS enabled client.\r\n\r\nLike GVFS itself, the experimental add-on is relatively new, and unsupported, which is why this\u00a0suggestion is still open. It is an experimental technology preview not intended for production use, though being a distinct code path it is unlikely to introduce side effects for non-GVFS users on a production instance. If you work on large repositories, we\u2019d love for you to\u00a0[take it for a spin|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.atlassian.bitbucket.server.bitbucket-gvfs/server/overview]\u00a0and send us your feedback.\r\nh3. Problem Definition\r\n\r\nWorking with monolithic Git repositories can be negatively affected by slow performance, especially long clone times and wasteful operations to determine what's changed in a local repository.\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nSupport GVFS protocol.\u00a0\r\nh3. Why this is important\r\n\r\nAs to the reasons we need a monolithic repo, well our reasons are the same as those that motivated Microsoft to create the Git Virtual File System in the first place. The reasons include:\r\n 1) We have a large number of source files (close to 1 million)\r\n 2) Git and Bitbucket do not support large repositories well, or large binary files for that matter. We have both.\r\n 3) In almost all cases, changes per a release span a significant percentage of our projects and these changes are all related. Here's an applicable quote from a Microsoft article ([https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/bharry/2017/02/03/scaling-git-and-some-back-story/]) that describes our situation nicely:\r\n{quote}\"Since all of Windows \u2013 the kernel, the libraries, the applications \u2013 are released together, they\u2019re also versioned together, in a large \u201cmonorepo\u201c. When planning the Windows move to Git, we looked at breaking the codebase down into many smaller repositories and layering them together with Git submodules or a system like Android\u2019s repo. But sometimes monorepos are just the easiest way to collaborate.\"\r\n{quote}\r\nAs is right now, we were forced to break up our source into around 30 repositories. And though doing that was fairly straightforward, producing releases now is a real pain since we often have related changes in all 30 repositories. Sometimes, in big highly related code bases, it really is better to treat the codebase as a whole.",

      "description": "h3. Problem Definition\r\n\r\nWhile implementing BSERV-3555 addressed some of the Git repository import issues, customer could benefit from the ability of importing in bulk from another Bitbucket Server instance in case a customer is migrating instances.\r\n\r\nCurrently the feature allows to import in bulk from Bitbucket Cloud and GitHub:\r\n- [Importing code from an existing project|https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/importing-code-from-an-existing-project-776640909.html#Importingcodefromanexistingproject-Importcodeusingthewebinterface]\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nInclude an option to import in bulk from another Bitbucket Server instance.\r\n \r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nWhat we do have is a small experimental (and, please note, unsupported) command line tool that will take a collection of repositories on disk, create the project/repositories and then push them to _Stash_\\*. \r\n\r\nIt can do this iteratively so you can refine the project/repo names for each on-disk repository. This, of course, means you will need to clone your repositories from your other Bitbucket Server instance to a local disk first before you can run the command line tool.\r\n\r\nI realize it's not ideal for you but it does at least limit the grunt work you'd have to do on the _Stash_\\* end (creating the project, repositories and pushing).\r\n\r\nYou can find the source to the project here https://bitbucket.org/atlassianlabs/stash-importer and the binary here https://bitbucket.org/atlassianlabs/stash-importer/downloads/stash-importer-0.1-distribution.zip\r\n\r\nThere is a readme file in the binary distribution which explains how to use it. \r\n{panel}\r\n(i) \r\nA recent test to use the tool with Bitbucket Server 5.0.1 revealed that the tool is currently able to create the repositories/projects as per the {{import.list}} but the actual push of the repos is not currently working so you will have to do the work manually. It fails as in:\r\n{code}\r\n$ ./bin/stash-import.sh importlist http://localhost:7990 import.list\r\nJava HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM warning: ignoring option MaxPermSize=512m; support was removed in 8.0\r\nEnter username for [http://localhost:7990]: admin\r\nEnter password for [http://localhost:7990]:\r\nImporting repositories from import list \"/path/to/import.list\"\r\n\r\nImporting repository in directory \"path/to/stash-importer\" into repository stash-importer of project STASHIMPORTER\r\nCreated project \"STASHIMPORTER\"\r\nFailed to create Stash repository for repository \"/path/to/stash-importer\": Failed to create repository \"stash-importer\" in project \"STASHIMPORTER\": key not found: cloneUrl\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nSee [How do I migrate from a private git server to Bitbucket Server without manually creating all the projects/repositories again?|https://community.atlassian.com/t5/Bitbucket-questions/How-do-I-migrate-from-a-private-git-server-to-Bitbucket-Server/qaq-p/244308]\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\n\\* this tool is an experimental one and was developed for Stash. Since then there were many new releases and the tool hasn't been maintained.\r\n\r\nh3. Why this is important\r\n\r\nWhilst there is no way to [BSERV-4586 - As an admin, I want to be able to export and restore projects or repositories individually, so that the metainformation (e.g. pull requests details) are preserved|BSERV-4586], providing this ability would help address at least part of the problem.",

If {{$BITBUCKET_HOME}}, or any of its parent directories, is a symbolic link, the tracking needs to \"peel\" those symbolic links.\r\n\r\nh4. History\r\n\r\nWhen forks were added in Stash 2.4.0, they were built using Git alternates to help manage on-disk storage. Alternates are stored as _absolute_ paths. As a result, moving the {{$BITBUCKET_HOME}} directory requires alternates to be rewritten. If {{$BITBUCKET_HOME}} is a symbolic link, and the target of the link is updated, since the _configured_ value has not changed, the system doesn't detect that as moving the home directory and does not rewrite alternates.\r\n\r\nh4. Problem description\r\n\r\nWhen a new fork is created, its alternate is created by {{git clone \\-\\-shared}}. Unlike Bitbucket Server, {{git clone}} \"peels\" symbolic links along the repository path to get a canonical, absolute path. That means if {{$BITBUCKET_HOME}} is a symbolic link, its _target path_ is used. This results in alternates that become invalid when the symbolic link's target is moved.\r\n\r\nTo illustrate this better, consider an install where {{$BITBUCKET_HOME}} is set to {{/var/atlassian/application-data/bitbucket}}. If {{$BITBUCKET_HOME}} was updated to, say, {{/var/atlassian/application-data/bitbucket-home}}, the system would automatically rewrite alternates to ensure forked repositories remain valid.\r\n\r\nBy comparison, if {{/var/atlassian/application-data/bitbucket}} was a symbolic link to {{/mnt/bitbucket-home}}, if the target was moved to, say, {{/mnt/larger-volume/bitbucket}}, but {{$BITBUCKET_HOME}} remained {{/var/atlassian/application-data/bitbucket}}, the system would _not_ attempt to rewrite alternates. However, when forks were created, {{git clone}} would have \"peeled\" {{/var/atlassian/application-data/bitbucket/shared/data/repositories/42/objects}} and written the alternate as {{/mnt/bitbucket-home/shared/data/repositories/42/objects}} instead. As a result, the fork would become \"corrupted\", because it would no longer be able to access borrowed objects.",
