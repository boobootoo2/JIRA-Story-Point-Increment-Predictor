[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFSERVER-50134].\n  {panel}\n\nHi,\nI know that you can import a .ics file and create a new calendar in Team Calendars. I was wondering if it would be possible that after a calendar has been created a second .ics file could be imported to add additional events. \n\nWhat I'm thinking is that when you click on the drop down menu for a calendar there could be an option to add additional events from a .ics file.\n\nSince CalDAV is presenting alot of issues, being able to import additional .ics files to a calendar I feel would put out a lot of fires with customers. \n\nCurrently I am creating new calendars on a monthly basis to update one of our calendars (we do this to include all the webex & teleconference data). Any subscribers to the calendars then have to re-subscribe.\n\nI had come across a work around on one of the tickets to create a google calendar and be able to achieve this but since everything in our company is behind a firewall this is not an option.\n\nHaving this option would be a great alternative to having a fully synced calendar from outlook via the CalDAV protocol.\n\nThanks for the time and consideration,\n-Aaron",

Some users reported that it takes longer than one hour. This sync interval is currently not configurable. It would be great to have this sync interval configurable somewhere.\n\nh4. One-off Workaround\nYou can do either one of the following to trigger the sync:\n- Flush Confluence caches by going to Confluence Admin > Cache Statistics > Flush All. To be exact, you only need to flush these 2 caches (one after another):\n-- Team Calendars - Internal cache for external-sourced sub-calendars\n-- Team Calendars - iCal subscription sub-calendar events\n- One of our user reports that refreshing the Google Calendar page could trigger the sync as well.\n\nh4. Better Workaround\nAdd the following in your {{confluence-home/config/ehcache.xml}} and then restart Confluence:\n{code}\n    <!-- Team Calendar Cache Config to pull GCal update to TC every 5 minutes -->\n    <cache name=\"com.atlassian.confluence.extra.calendar3.calendarstore.ExternalCalendarDataStore\" maxElementsInMemory=\"1000\" eternal=\"false\" timeToIdleSeconds=\"299\" timeToLiveSeconds=\"299\" overflowToDisk=\"false\" />\n    <cache name=\"com.atlassian.confluence.extra.calendar3.calendarstore.SubscriptionCalendarDataStore:subcalendar-data\" maxElementsInMemory=\"1000\" eternal=\"false\" timeToIdleSeconds=\"300\" timeToLiveSeconds=\"300\" overflowToDisk=\"false\" />\n{code} \nThis will get the sync to be triggered every 5 minutes. Feel free to change the duration as per your need. Please note to ensure the value of \"com.atlassian.confluence.extra.calendar3.calendarstore.ExternalCalendarDataStore\" is one second before the value of \"com.atlassian.confluence.extra.calendar3.calendarstore.SubscriptionCalendarDataStore:subcalendar-data\"",

If you see on the 16th of the month in the Outlook version (1.png) it has the original event and then the modified (current) event below it.\n\nDuring our dev phase with \"Team Calendars\" it seems we didn\u2019t have any of these issues with the plugin.\n\nThanks for the help,\nAaron\n",

In the last month, I cleaned up our old calenders and adapted the new concept of having one team calendar per team. In the calendar view (top bar in confluence, next to the create button), I am getting all current calendars, and all deleted ones are gone. Unfotunately, when I use the calendar macro and \"add an exisiting\" calendar or go to the settings and add calendars in the list, I am still seeing some calendars that should have been deleted. I tried to show this in the attached screenshots. The deleted calendars are marked yellow and as you can see, they do not show up in the calendar view. Only in the macro search.\n\nIs this a bug?\n\nCheers,\nChris",

Since we do not receive the email notification when creating events. (even after updating the plugin with new versions)\nAfter some research and testing we have found a solution to restore normal operation. We must remove all calendars of sight (\"Remove this calendar from my calendar view\") then re-add these calendars. After this, we get the new email notification in the creation of events.",

There is currently no browser alternative planned.\n\nI think it's a performance and/or compatibility problem. I identified the following symptoms:\n\n# If I embed the TC macro into a page, there is usually a flyout to edit or delete appointments. If I click on a appointment to display this flyout, the browser goes very slow and nothing happens. The javascript error in the browser console is in graphic 01 snapped.\n# Also regarding the TC macro. If I try to configure the macro in the edit-mode of a page, the button often does not react and never on the first click. The javascript error is snappend in graphic 02.\n# The general performance of confluence is greatly reduced on pages where the TC is embedded or if the user is in the actual TC overview. It is not possible to open the dropdown menu's (regarding TC), they disappear directly after clicking on them.\n# In *IE 8*, page scrolls slowly when you add an *Event* to a Calender. \n\n\n\nMaybe you have an idea or fix for our problem. We would really like to implement the TC plugin into our upcoming confluence environment.",

For me, even just a couple of recurring events was taking 5+ seconds to render the events.json payload.\n * Stop the Confluence instance, start it back up without the America/Santiago timezone.\n * Observe how events.json is now sub-100ms average response time.\n\nI added some profiling calls and found that [lines 672 and 673 of DefaultCalendarManager.java|https://stash.atlassian.com/projects/CONF/repos/teamcal/browse/team-calendars/src/main/java/com/atlassian/confluence/extra/calendar3/DefaultCalendarManager.java?at=refs%2Ftags%2Fteam-calendars-project-4.2.4#672] were taking 1.5 seconds each (3 seconds in total for those two lines to execute). These get called in a loop for all recurring instances of an event.\n\nSome observations (may not be useful):\n * Breakpoint on net.fortuna.ical4j.model.TimeZoneRegistryImpl.getTimeZone reveals that timezones.get(\"America/Santiago\") returns null. Seems strange.\n * [~merickson] mentioned that there is some code somewhere in ical4j that will actually try and resolve timezone data from an external resource if it can't figure it out locally, or something.

We used this to show a series of milestones for an Issue (which we store as custom fields in a JIRA issue) on the Calendar.  But now, each Calendar entry just shows the issue's Summary and we can't tell what milestone that Calendar entry it's representing, thus making these Calendars unusable for us.\n\nCould this be related to https://ecosystem.atlassian.net/browse/JICAL-24  ?\n",

When a user creates a calendar, it does not create subscriptions to the child calendars (eg Events, Leave etc). When a user adds a calendar created by someone else, it does create subscriptions to the child calendars. The code that determines whether a user is subscribed to a calendar that they did not create actually checks against the parent, where the code that checks if the creator is watching the calendar checks against the child.

In this case, Team Calendars will display a user-friendly message: \"There is no valid time zone information in the uploaded iCalendar file\" (see screenshot: [^import_calendar.png]).",
