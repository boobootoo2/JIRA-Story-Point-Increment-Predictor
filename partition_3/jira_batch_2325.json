      "description": "Bitbucket Server and Data Center 5.13 included the ability to set up to 5 labels per repo, as suggested in BSERV-2727. This is great, but the user has to go into a repo and click on a label link to see repos with that label.\r\n\r\nHere are are some proposals for how this could work.\r\n * *Core feature*\r\n ** Users should be able to use a *{{label:}}* search modifier to perform more fine-grained searches than the label links provide. This would allow searching on files with certain extensions, but only in repos that contain one ore more specified labels.\r\n * *Sub-feature 1: Compact syntax*\r\n ** Further, it would be ideal to have a compact syntax to search through multiple labels, such as *{{label:(prod OR docker)}}* instead of having to use *{{label:prod OR label:docker}}*.\r\n * *Sub-feature 2: Wildcard support*\r\n ** With only five labels available, users may try to combine multiple aspects into a single label, such as *{{prod_docker}}* or *{{prod_selenium}}*, so being able to search for *{{prod_*}}* might be useful for really large repositories. Regular expressions are probably not totally necessary, and would add complexity, so this would be out of scope.\r\n\r\nFellow users, please vote if you'd like to have this, and feel free to suggest modifications to what I've proposed.",

The difference is that it doesn't depend on/interact with hooks.\r\n\r\nSpecifically the scenario that we wish to have is:\r\n\r\nGIVEN a forked repository with fork syncing enabled\r\n AND for all (relevant) branches a branch permission is configured to prevent \"Rewriting history\" and \"Deletion\"\r\n AND a branch diverges from its match in the fork's parent repository\r\n WHEN someone attempts to use the \"Synchronize\" option for that branch\r\n THEN all options that result in non-fast-forward changes, including at least \"discard\" and \"rebase\", are either unavailable or blocked from operating\r\n\r\nThe scenario that this would have prevented is this:\r\n * we have a company-wide repository A\r\n * our team maintains a team-specific fork B of A\r\n * one of our developers had admin access to (the project containing) B\r\n * that developer also had a private fork C of B\r\n * that developer wanted to remove all changes in C, compared to B\r\n * by accident that developer selected synchronize (with \"discard\" option) in B instead of C (this difference is difficult to spot unless you're expecting mistakes that you need to guard against)\r\n * we lost all history specific to B not present in A\r\n\r\nWe have and had branch permissions configured with the restrictions \"Prevent deletion\", \"Prevent rewriting history\" and \"Prevent changes without a pull request\". Only the latter has an exception for an SSH key specific to our CI system. This works as expected, to block non-fast-forward changes, through git remotes (either SSH or HTTP). But, unexpectedly it didn't guard us against the \"discard\" option given by fork syncing.\r\n\r\nEdit: intuitively the expectation of an administrator is that configured permissions can _not_ be circumvented just because an action occurs through the WebUI. Currently that expectation is neither met nor corrected.",

Problem Definition\r\nCustomers might have many application teams, and each team might have many projects.\r\n\r\nCurrently it is possible to define groups of users and call them 'Team 1', 'Team 2', etc, then grant them access to specific repositories within your projects, or to all repositories within a project by specifying project level permissions.\r\n\r\nHowever, groups can only contain members, not Projects. Theoretically, it's impossible to go from Group to Project, but Bitbucket Server does not provide such reverse navigation. When you click open on a Group you see only members, not its dependencies, like Projects.\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\nThere should be a concept of teams in Bitbucket Server, which are a higher layer to Project level, so that projects can be grouped into teams. For example:\r\n\r\nTeam1:\r\nProject1 (Repo1, Repo2)\r\nProject2 (Repo1, Repo2)\r\n\r\nTeam2:\r\nProject3 (Repo1, Repo2)\r\nProject4 (Repo1, Repo2)",

(It should not be possible to rapidly approve all comments and just click Merge before the reviewer catches you.)\r\n * Comments may be resolved without updating the code - maybe the reviewer is satisfied by an explanation in the comment thread, and ends up accepting it.\r\n\r\nWith a workflow like this, the final \"I approve of the change\" review even becomes redundant. All you have is \"I have finished my review\", and if you left any unaddressed comments, the merge cannot occur.\r\n\r\n\u00a0",

The bundled version of the Apache HttpComponents libraries used by the primary server webhooks to the mirror do not handle SSL handshake failures properly resulting in a memory leak.\r\n\r\nHeap dump includes the exception being thrown, buried down inside the guts of the Apache HttpComponents code. The exception looks like this:\r\n{noformat}\r\njavax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: General SSLEngine problem\r\ncaused by: sun.security.validator.ValidatorException: PKIX path validation failed: java.security.cert.CertPathValidatorException: timestamp check failed\r\ncaused by: java.security.cert.CertPathValidatorException: timestamp check failed\r\ncaused by: java.security.cert.CertificateExpiredException: NotAfter: Tue Jun 19 xx:x:xx GMT 2018\r\n{noformat}\r\nThe cluster considers the SSL certificate installed on the mirror to be expired and that's why the handshake is failing.\r\n\r\nh3.

I know it's been a while since this suggestion was raised. I'm sorry we kept you without a clear answer or so long.\r\n\r\nThis problem is one of those we are actively solving on at the moment. Quite soon we will release Bitbucket Mesh which is a distributed git storage solution for Bitbucket Data Center. Mesh will allow us to relax dependency on NFSv3 and you will be able to use NFSv4 for shared directory.\r\n\r\nMore information on Bitbucket Mesh release plans is available in [Data Center Public Roadmap.|https://www.atlassian.com/roadmap/data-center?product=bitbucket]\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nAnton Genkin\r\nProduct Manager\r\n{panel}\r\nh3. Original Problem Definition\r\n\r\nCustomers running on NFS4 (NFSv4) could potentially experience performance issue with Bitbucket Server.\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nMake sure that NFS4 can be used as the shared filesystem for Bitbucket Server.\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nAt the moment, the *recommendation* is to use NFS version 3.\r\nHere is an example\r\n{noformat}\r\n<server:/export> </mount-point> nfs noatime,nfsvers=3,lookupcache=pos,proto=tcp,rsize=65536,wsize=65536,hard,addr=<host> 0 0 \r\n{noformat}",
