Your input in the comments helps us understand how this affects you and what you're hoping to accomplish with Bitbucket Server.\r\n\r\nThis suggestion is a priority for the Bitbucket development team and is on our roadmap. However due to the agile nature of product development, we're not able to provide a timeline for when it will be resolved.\r\n\r\nProduct feedback is collected from a number of different sources and is evaluated when planning the product roadmap. You can [learn more about our process here|https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/110373/how-does-the-jira-team-use-jira-atlassian-com].\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nRoger Barnes\r\nProduct Manager - Bitbucket\r\n\r\n{panel}\r\n*Original request description:*\r\nComments made in the commit are completely separate from those in the pull request. They should show up in the pull request log and in the code for those reviewing the code in the diff rather than commits pane.\r\n\r\nThis has caused a fair amount of confusion as comments get lost and users need to look in two places for comments and responses.",

All of our commits and pull requests in Stash still have the old project issue ID. \r\n\r\nGenerally, this isn't an issue, as JIRA will 302 redirect any requests for an \"old\" issue to the new issue ID, so most links in Stash to a old issue ID still work as expected.\r\n\r\nThe only spot (that I can find) where this behavior doesn't work is in the Overview tab of a pull request. There's a JIRA issue link on the right hand side that displays a modal window with some information pulled from the JIRA issue.\r\n\r\nWhen you click on this for a \"moved\" issue, inside the modal window you see: \r\n\r\n\"Can't display issues. Either you don't have access to view them or they don't exist. Please contact your system administrator if you believe this is incorrect.\"\r\n\r\nIs it possible to have this follow redirects as well and show you details from the new JIRA issue ID?\r\n",

A similar need exists when using Crucible as well, but I want to specifically address it as it relates to Stash.\r\n\r\nThe typical workflow for reviewing a pull request in Stash is this.\r\n- Engineer submits a pull request\r\n- Reviewer looks at the diff and adds comments\r\n- Engineer looks at comments and makes changes\r\n- Engineer pushes their changes\r\n- Reviewer looks at the global diff in stash and reviews the code again\r\n\r\nThis process repeats itself until the reviewer is happy with the diff in stash, at which point they can approve and accept the pull request.\r\n\r\nThe problem with this workflow is that as reviews get larger, and as the number of iterations grow more numerous, that the burden is on the reviewer to make sure their comments and concerns were addressed by subsequent commits. Because the diff in stash encompasses the entire pull request, or the diff between that branch and the target branch, there is no way to see iterative diffs alongside the comment view. That basically means that the reviewer has two options for how to re-review the changes once the engineer commits again:\r\n\r\n1) Treat the latest commit as a new pull request and re-review the entire set of changes. The benefit of this is supreme confidence that high quality code will make it into master. The downside is this greatly increases the amount of time that the reviewer must spend reviewing code because they are forced to also re-review code that they implicitly \"green-lighted\" on the previous review by not commenting on.\r\n\r\n2) Use a combination of the Overview activity list to map their comments to the individual commit diff for each new commit since their last review. The individual commit diffs do show the iterative progress that the reviewer needs to see so that they know what new changes were made. But those diffs do not include comments, so they also need to review their own comments in a separate window to remind them of the context of the changes and the rest of the pull request.\r\n\r\nNeither of these two things are major issues for small, targeted pull requests.  I'll concede, for the sake of argument, that small, targeted, pull requests are ideal and a best practice.  But I think we can still agree that this doesn't always happen, and I think the tool can support a broader and more complete workflow by improving the user experience for the scenario I describe above.\r\n\r\nSo, here's my proposed solution. I think the tool should support one or both of the following features:\r\n\r\n1) On the Diff view in a pull request, allow the user to view either the global pull request diff, from first commit to last commit, or specify specific revisions to view the diff from and to. That will keep the Diff view as the single source of truth, while also improving the review workflow for iterative reviews.\r\n\r\n2) When the user clicks on a commit link from the pull request overview activity list, instead of taking the user to view the diff for that commit in isolation, pull in the comments to also show those there.\r\n\r\nI am really interested to hear what the Stash team thinks about this proposed change. While we like Stash, and we see it as an improvement to Crucible for our workflow, I think these changes would take it to a whole new level for us by streamlining the iterative code review workflow for when a review takes several iterations to get right.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\n- Conrad",

I created the trusted link both ways, and committed with Jira Issue Keys in comments but nothing happened. As per the documentation, Stash waits for the first commit with a Jira Issue Key and then indexes the entire repository. However, it did not seem to work for me.\r\n\r\nThen I made another commit with issue keys in [], so if a issue key is \"IT-567\", in comments I put \"[IT-567] Making changes to hello\" and immediately after doing this, it showed all the commits in JIRA, and from now on, it started showing even the commits without [] in jira keys. So everything works now.\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nAnd \r\n\r\n{quote}\r\nwell, I had created a new test server, and had created just one project, and one repository in it, and have just added one file so I don't see why it should take time. After app linking, I committed same file three times by making small changes, and it did not work. I waited like 15 minutes, but it did not work. And then later at the day, I used [] in keys and it worked. If it was time, then Atlassian have forgot to put in document to wait for a couple of hours before trying. I am sure the keys entered were correct because I just used the same keys all the time, and after first successful linking, all of them are being shown linked in the repo.\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nA number of options:\r\n\r\n* Indexing is not running / all indexing threads are busy indexing other repositories.\r\n* The UI isn't showing the JIRA keys, even though the application links have been created. In that case the 'Issues' column on the commits list shouldn't be displayed at all. Maybe the conditions that control the visibility of the Issues column use caching?\r\n",

Your input in the comments helps us understand how this affects you and what you're hoping to accomplish with Bitbucket Data Center.\r\n\r\nWe spend a significant amount of time determining our product investments in Bitbucket Data Center. Unfortunately, we are not planning to address this suggestion in the next 12 months. In the last year, we have resolved many of the highly voted suggestions like Reviewer groups, Pull request templates, capability to enable/disable source branch deletion on merging pull requests and our upcoming roadmap includes a number of other top voted suggestions, including repository archiving. Please check out our [public roadmap|https://www.atlassian.com/roadmap/data-center?product=bitbucket] for more details on the coming soon and future items.\r\n\r\nI understand that this may be disappointing, but it\u2019s important for us to be open, honest, and transparent with our customers. Product feedback is collected from many different sources and is evaluated when planning the product roadmap. You can\u00a0[learn more about our process here|https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/110373/how-does-the-jira-team-use-jira-atlassian-com].\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nImran Khan\r\n\r\nProduct Manager - Bitbucket Data Center & Server\r\n{panel}\r\n*Original request description*\r\n\r\nIf pull request was approved and merged by wrong decision then we need to rollback it and re-open Pull Request. To do this git has full support:\r\n[http://git-scm.com/2010/03/02/undoing-merges.html]\r\nYou should used {{git revert -m 1 <hash>}}\r\nAfter this Stash can automatically reopen Pull Request from receive hook.

One way may be to allow observers to push branches called \"pullrequest/name\". Pull requests could be created from those branches but they wouldn't have access to any other branch.\r\n\r\nAnother option would be to accept a Git Patch as a pull request. Rather than requiring a branch to merge, submitting a patch file against a branch could create a pull request.",

When repos are added to Stash the following things happen (among others)\r\n# a record is created in the database table 'repository'\r\n# a clone is created in the $STASH_HOME/data/repositories directory using the new db record's primary key as the directory name\r\n\r\nFEDS added each repo it found in the directory to Crucible - but without any useful identifying information. Each repo was added using the directory name as the Crucible Repo name. And Crucible doesn't surface the repo description useful for identifying what repo ## really is.\r\n\r\nMy thought - if Stash provided a rest call to query repositories based on ID then the FEDS plugin could be modified to use the directory name in a rest call to pull Repository intel out of Stash - that way the Crucible Repo it then creates could have a meaningful name\r\n",

CI is much more useful when the CI implements a pre-commit policy which requires the commit to pass a CI (bamboo) build prior to being accepted as a commit. If the CI build fails, the push to Stash should fail with the appropriate error message(s) and the developer should fix their branch and attempt push to Stash with corrected code. Having this capability completely changes developer culture in that developers must be proactive rather than reactive. \r\n\r\nIn a feature branch development model, the pre-commit verification would ensure that the feature + baseline builds as a minimum commit requirement. That would be a good starting point. My assumption here is that Bamboo and Stash would work together to enable this functionality. Stash should see the intent to commit and Bamboo should validate pre-commit conditions. Once validated, Stash should accept or reject the commit accordingly.  ",

However, the merge button has a caution icon next to it detailing that \"You have insufficient permissions to update 'xxxx'. ...\". As the author doesn't expect to be able to merge, this is confusing. It would be strongly preferred for the Merge button to either be clearly disabled or removed altogether.\r\n\r\n2) If you browse around the pull request - for example, from \"Overview\" to \"Diff\" and back to \"Overview\", it shows a warning: \"This pull request can't be merged. You will need to resolve conflicts to be able to merge.\" As the author doesn't expect to be able to merge, this is confusing. The \"More information\" also seems confusing as all it adds is: \"You have insufficient permissions to update 'master'. Check your branch permissions with the project administrator.\"\r\n\r\nI consider this a bug as I think the branch access controls are not working properly with pull requests.\r\n\r\nI tried to determine whether any special conditions are required to cause this problem and it doesn't seem there are.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n\r\n1) Set write restrictions on \"master\" to only allow user A to write to \"master\".\r\n\r\n2) User B to clone repository and create branch \"feature/X\" off branch \"origin/master\". \"git clone ...\", \"git checkout -b feature/X origin/master\".\r\n\r\n3) User B to make any simple change, commit (\"git commit\"), push (\"git push origin feature/X\").\r\n\r\n4) User B to create pull request from \"feature/X\" to \"master\".\r\n\r\nAt this point, you will see the Merge button with the caution icon not so helpfully pointing out the lack of permission. If you click on \"Diff\" then back to \"Overview\" you will see the not so helpful warning that this pull request can't be merged (which is false).\r\n\r\nOur users are most confused about the second behaviour. I consider both behaviours confusing.\r\n",
