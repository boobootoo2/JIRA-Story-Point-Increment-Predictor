Although the configuration is still saved on browser A, the browser B configuration does not follow the same from browser A. This causes the user to use different configurations between the browsers and need to manually adjust it.\r\n* If the site data is cleared (cookies and caches, for example)\r\n\r\nFor users that clear the cached content when quitting Chrome, for example, every time that they access Confluence, it will be necessary to manually adjust the sidebar again.\r\n\r\nh4.Suggestion\r\n\r\nThis is a suggestion to have such modification either saved/configured through the user profile or, have it stored/associated with the user itself, meaning that if the cache is cleared, or, Confluence is accessed from a different browser, this would be preserved.",
