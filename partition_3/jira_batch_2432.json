In my case this is not happening\n\nh3. Only the latest commit to a pull request is shown. As such some commits / elements of some commits are masked.\nSteps to reproduce :\n\n# Create branch\n# Create PR from branch\n# Make additional commits (typically as a result of code review comments)\n# Repeat step 3 a few times\n\nh3. Outcome only the changes from the latest commit are visible. Changes from prior commits are masked giving a false impression of what is going to be merged.\nPer the screen shots The branch was created, there was one commit and a PR was created. There have been 3 additional commits to the branch since then.\n\nTo highlight the point in the screenshots given.\\\\\nThe project/Libraries.scala file was added on the first commit and has not been amended since.\\\\\nThe sonar-project.properties file was amended on the every commit, however it only has diffs (shown through the UI) on commits 5885a17 and f197f08. It shows modified on commit eddc86a which happened between the previous two, but has no diff. (Note the commit ID&#x27;s given are from the screenshot attached, any auto linking may be incorrect)\n\nIn a PR I expect to see the changes that would be made if I hit the merge button.\n\nAs an enhancement I&#x27;d like to see a selectible window of changes eg from commit 3 to present (for the situation where I reviewed just after the 3 commit and I do not want to re-review changes). I&#x27;d forgo this enhancement if it meant I could see all the changes",

However, when the user clicks the Pipelines tab on the navigation panel, the UI prompts you to create a bitbucket pipelines config file and asks you to commit in order to enable pipelines.\n\nThe reason for this is because pipelines checks on the main branch for the config file for the initial setup. However, it prompts to create a new pipelines configuration file.\n\n_Steps to Reproduce_\n\n# Create a new repository.\n# Make a new commit of any file (master as the main branch)\n# Create a new branch (develop)\n# Enable pipelines by navigating to  to Repository Settings >> Pipelines >> Settings\n# Commit a new bitbucket-pipelines.yml file and notice on the commit view you can see the build status\n# Now click on the Pipelines tab on the navigation bar and you will be prompted to create a pipelines config file as it does not exist on the main branch\n\n*Request*\n\nIt would be good to add a feature to detect pipelines config from from other branches as well during initial setup rather than checking only on the main branch.",
