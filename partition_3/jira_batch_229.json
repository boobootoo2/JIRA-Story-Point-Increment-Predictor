Because, this last digits or characters have been truncated in the view. Please see attachment for details.\r\n\r\nIf this must be truncated, then a hover hint should be provided to show the sprint title in full.\r\n",

      "description": "After moving an issue on the board the board is refreshed by calling {{xboard/work/allData.json}}. On our production instance this takes 6 seconds. Updating the issue is relatively quick, refreshing the board data is not.\r\n\r\nThis is down to {{com.atlassian.greenhopper.service.lucene.ChangeHistorySearchHelper#findChangeLogFilter}}. Specifically, computing the cross-references from two queries, one of which may contain up to half a million issues, is very slow. I'm sure there is a quicker way, even if it's just checking the permission for each issue retrieved from the change history index.\r\n\r\nAs a workaround I am just disabling loading the days in column data in {{com.atlassian.greenhopper.web.rapid.list.RapidIssueEntryQueryServiceImpl#collectWorkModeIssues}}, which makes things passably fast.\r\n\r\nh3. Areas of JIRA Agile Affected\r\n\r\n* Generating JIRA Agile charts - notably Burndown, Cumulative Flow Diagram & Control Chart.\r\n* Loading days in column for a list of issues (workaround to disable this in GHS-10520).\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround for Work Sub-Filter\r\n\r\nThis is fixed in JIRA 6.3.1 as tracked in JRA-38883, so this workaround will only apply for previous versions of JIRA.\r\n\r\nIt's possible that on larger instances the default work sub-filter may be causing performance issues of its own. This is not related to {{com.atlassian.greenhopper.service.lucene.ChangeHistorySearchHelper}} however does present with similar symptoms. Specifically, the [work sub-filter|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/AGILE/Configuring+Filters#ConfiguringFilters-AddingaSub-FilterforWorkmode] default is:\r\n\r\n{noformat}\r\nfixVersion in unreleasedVersions() OR fixVersion is EMPTY\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nThis {{unreleasedVersions()}} JQL may be slow for larger instances that process a large number of projects, as it goes through all of them to find out which versions are relevant. This can be sped up by specifying a list of projects _that are only relevant to the JIRA Agile board being used_. For example if we wanted to only return issues for projects GHS and JRA (because they are in the board filter), we would use the following:\r\n\r\n{noformat}\r\nfixVersion in unreleasedVersions(GHS,JRA) OR fixVersion is EMPTY\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nPlease make the above changes and verify if the boards are faster to render or not. If they are faster, it implies the {{unreleasedVersions()}} was slow to process due to the large number of projects. If it does not it would indicate that the {{com.atlassian.greenhopper.service.lucene.ChangeHistorySearchHelper}} is the cause of slowness.\r\n\r\nIt's possible that both {{unreleasedVersions()}} and {{com.atlassian.greenhopper.service.lucene.ChangeHistorySearchHelper}} are slow to process and this workaround only addresses one part of the problem.\r\n\r\nh3.

      "description": "I find that one of the most useful tools for our software development team is the Version Report chart.  Since the addition of this one chart, we're able to much more accurately forecast the completion of a release and extremely accurately communicate the effect of scope creep on our completion date.  We have been able to determine when it's necessary to add resources to a project and communicate to upper management exactly why they need to make a priority decision on all open projects due to release schedules.\r\n\r\nHowever, in order to do this, we currently create our own trend lines with a sheet of paper held up to the monitor or projector.  I've attached a screenshot that explains why this is necessary.\r\n\r\nFirst off, being able to annotate this graph as I've done in this screenshot would prove invaluable for project status reports as well as \"lessons learned\" post-project analysis.  I'm thinking GreenHopper stores as many points on the graph as is requested as well as an annotation for each.  These points are stored per version tracked in GreenHopper.\r\n\r\nI feel like the \"project start\" date should show the entire progression (graph) of a project.  However, there needs to be an option for a progression line start date separate from the project start date, as the June re-specification and reallocation of developers to the project requires a new velocity trend line.  I already did this in March, and have been considering doing it again, but if I do this, the new graph loses the historical nature as annotated in the screenshot.\r\n\r\nAnother cool idea is a \"scope creep trend line\".  I just noticed today that even back all the way until early mid-april, our scope creep has been extremely linear.  This, combined with current (recent) velocity could possibly create a \"true\" completion date where the two lines I drew intersect?\r\n\r\nOne thing I didn't show on the graph was the ability to speculate on an increased velocity over your current velocity.  This could have been used after the spec redesign in late June and the addition of more developers to the project.  I'm thinking a box on the right that says \"Speculate an additional X story points per week\".  This would cause the velocity trend line slope to increase starting today, causing an upward kink in the velocity trend line with an adjusted final completion date.\r\n\r\nI know this is a huge request, but I feel like this adds a significant amount of benefit to an already great feature.  These new features will hugely help us when communicating outside our group and committing to release dates.",

Unfortunately, I did not close the previous sprint, which had a number of issues with open subtasks.  I realize that I was supposed to close the previous sprint before opening the new sprint, but GreenHopper does not make it easy to recover from this mistake.  In trying to maintain the sprint history for each issue, I had to manually edit the sprint number for each of the stories, removing the previous sprint from the Sprint Number list.  For some lesser issues, I just did a bulk update.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure there's much value in supporting multiple open sprints for a given RapidBoard, but if so, make it harder to mess up the iteration rituals.",
