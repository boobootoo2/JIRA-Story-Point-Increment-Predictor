Engineering Tools. Users of one specialist room don't have much interest in content created about a subject that is not related to the room they are in.\n\nSpace level notifications are great for wide ranging hc rooms s however the more focused the hc room should allow for a more focused integration with confluence pages. \n\nAny plans to allow us to select the integration between hc and confluence at a parent page or single page level?  We'd love to see this happen!",

Drag markers so they are very close :\nmarkers text is overlapping. Impossible to read\n\nImpact : impossible to represent two events which are close in time...\n\nThis is even more occurring as it is impossible to scale the roadmap, hence we cannot \"zoom\" on the timeline to avoid having two markers too close.\n\nRegards\nNicolas",

The ability to define and display the start and end date for bars would help having a clear description of timing.\n\nIncluding [~D Monaghan] comments, the goal of this improvement would be to :\n- add an option \"Start date\" with a calendar. \n- add an option \"End date\" with a calendar. \n- add an option \"Selected lane\"\n- once modifications are validated by the user, the bar move to it's lane and size according to specified parameters\n- when the user move or change the size of the bar manually (using drag & drop) the dates are updated accordingly\n- when the user change the lane of a bar manually (using drag & drop), the selected lane value is updated accordingly\n- add an option to display Start and End dates on the roadmap planner ?\n\nfor markers :\n- Add an option \"Date\" with a calendar\n- Add a tick box \"Today\" which grays the \"Date\" parameter\n- once modifications are validated by User, the marker is moved accordingly on the planning\n\nRegards\nNicolas",

Prior to 5.7, these files would simply be downloaded. Now, users get an extra pop up which may be confusing. Users can still download the file from the top right corner overlay, but may not remember to do so.\n\nThere are a few points concerning this file preview:\n# If the file can't be previewed (and we should have a good idea based on it's mime type and extension), why do we not just allow the file to download?\n# If we can't preview the file, the message that states the file cannot be previewed should help the user to an alternate action - in this case, to download the file. Either a direct link or a guide to the download icon in the top right corner to foster the correct behavior. The current preview window relies on the user knowing the behavior of this window, which may not be 100% concrete so soon after an upgrade\n\nAlternatively, it would be awesome if an administrator could control what file types are attempted to be previewed or not. If for example, we add the ability to preview visio files, and a company with large visio files may not want them previewed in their instance, they should have the ability to disable previews for a certain file type - and just allow the file to be downloaded.",

For example:\n- TOOL_Confluence_Main_Admin: This group has Admin permissions in the \"Main\" space.\n- TOOL_Confluence_Main_Edit: This group has edit permissions in the \"Main\" space\n- TOOL_Confluence_Main_Comment: This group has comment permissions in the \"Main\" space\n- TOOL_Confluence_Main_View: This group has view-only permissions in the \"Main\" space\n\nThe idea is that all permissions are managed in Active Directory, and it is very easy to see exactly who has permissions in which Confluence spaces, and what level of permissions they have - both inside AD and inside Confluence.\n\nWe have trained all the Confluence System Administrators to set permissions up this way when a new space is created - and only system admins are allowed to create site level spaces.  The problem is, there is no reasonable way to restrict the management of permissions to ONLY Confluence System Administrators.  \n\nWe could make it so that ONLY Confluence System Administrators have \"Admin\" permissions in all spaces.  The problem with this option is that teams and departments then have no way of doing the other space administration tasks that we would like to allow them to do such as customizing their sidebars.\n\nSecurity is the other important factor here.  It is important that only trained administrators manage permissions because untrained users may grant permissions to groups that are too broad and include external contractors that should only have limited access to spaces on an as-needed basis.\n\nMy request is as follows:\n(1) Add a \"Permissions\" checkbox on the space permissions page - or modify the exiting \"restrictions\" checkbox to also apply to permissions.\n(2) Make it so that if \"Permissions\" or \"Restrictions\" is unchecked then the user cannot manage permissions or restrictions - even if the \"Admin\" box is checked.  Currently, with the Admin box checked, a Space Administrator can manage restrictions, even if the \"Restrictions\" box is not checked.  \n\n",

This went very smoothly by performing an rsync to create a exact replica of our previous instance. When testing the Mail Server everything went well when using the \"Send Test Email\" option however this appears to bypass the Mail Queue providing us with a false positive. Currently email notifications do not work for anyone as the Mail Queue is processing however the emails do not successfully reach the recipient.\n\nWe have confirmed this is not an issue caused by our Mail Server as our previous environment does not have this issue using identical settings. After enabling *DEBUG* mail logging for {{com.atlassian.confluence.mail}} we noticed some worrying log entries such as {noformat}\n2015-03-30 12:33:00,026 INFO [scheduler_Worker-7] [confluence.mail.template.AbstractMailNotificationQueueItem] send Not sending email because sending is disabled via system property.\n{noformat}\nI assume this system property is my problem. If so how do I enable sending? What could have caused the disabling of sending?\n\nIs this System property we are looking to change {{atlassian.mail.senddisabled}}?\n\nP.S We are running on Red Hat Linux 6.5",

As I work a lot with images, I would like to very quickly see and update many images simultaneously.\n\nThere are three ways to see the attachments on a page/space, each containing different options and only one of which allows you to see the attachments.  \n\nI've attached three images to show the options for viewing attachments:\n\n1/ The first is the typical way of viewing all attachments on a page by clicking on the drop-down menu on the top-right corner of a page. \n2/ By adding the Attachments macro to a page. Here you CAN view the image. This is what I would like.\n3/ By going to the Space Tools > Attachments. This shows almost the same as 1/ however does not allow you to edit the image on the page.\n\nIf find this very confusing.{color:red}* Why are there three different ways of listing the attachments?*{color}\n\nThe feature I really would like most is the ability to view the actual image in all three cases (as per option 2/).  The second option would be to quickly update in mass the metadata associated with the images (IE labels, names etc). \n\nI have contacted support and was told it could be too difficult.  However if it viewing images already possible in one of the three options noted above, why can it not be applied for all?  Why can't we choose the meta-data we want to see associated with the attachments?  Perhaps not all attachement types need to be visible - say only JPGs and other simple image types.   \n\nMany thanks!! ",

Examples include:\n\nhttps://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONF-36648\nhttps://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONF-33654\nhttps://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONF-22283\n\nThis is especially a problem when the following condition is not met:\n(taken from [Configuring Tomcat for use with a HTTP proxy|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/KB/Reverse+Proxy+and+Application+Link+Troubleshooting+Guide#ReverseProxyandApplicationLinkTroubleshootingGuide-ConfiguringTomcatforusewithaHTTPproxy] ):\n{quote}\nWhen using a reverse proxy, the application server (Tomcat) must be aware of the proxy to ensure that the correct addresses and URLs are sent back to the client. If this is not correctly set up, Tomcat will return the hostname and IP that it's listening on, rather than the address that clients use to access the application.\n{quote}\n\nDifferent reverse proxies have different configurations making it difficult for our customers to determine the optimal configuration to make Tomcat \"aware\" of the proxy. We should make this requirement as relaxed as possible, to avoid NPE such as the following:\n{code}\njava.lang.NullPointerException\n\tat com.atlassian.confluence.plugins.jira.AppLinksProxyRequestServlet.doProxy(AppLinksProxyRequestServlet.java:73)\n\tat com.atlassian.confluence.plugins.jira.AbstractProxyServlet.doGet(AbstractProxyServlet.java:46)\n\tat javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet.service(HttpServlet.java:620)\n\tat javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet.service(HttpServlet.java:727)\n{code}",

Currently we can only see update time, editor and we have a \"view change\" option that is good for document writers, not that good for customers who just want to know quickly what has been changed.\nThe \"Activity Stream\" macro allows us to see the comments added when saving but unfortunately does not allow us to add filters per label as the \"Recently Updated\" macro does.\n\nThanks\nBruno",

When:\n- you create a colored panel macro, put in one or more heading formatted lines after each other and you put an empty row after them (image_1)\n- you create a colored panel macro, put in one or more heading formatted lines after each other and you put an unformatted ro after them (image_2)\n- you create a colored panel macro, put in one ore more heading formatted lines and put unformatted row betweem them (image_3)\n\nHope I explanied correctly, in case of any questions please ask.\n\nThanks",
