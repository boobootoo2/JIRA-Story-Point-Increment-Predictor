      "description": "The following statement was made by a user comprehensively. Hence, I decide to put everything here so that the devs will have a look into it:\r\n\r\n{quote}\r\n I am really sorry I updated GreenHopper this time because I think Atlassian made a couple of really horrible UI changes. Amongst others:\r\n* The version and epic panels are panels which are opened and closed many times during grooming and planning - even in the day to day work of a PO or SM.\r\n** Electing to remove the button when it is pressed is bad enough but forcing users to then search *different* places on the screen (depending on the browser window size) to close them again is really really bad.\r\n** Placing the close 'X' right next to the \"create\" label is just a consequence of this bad design.\r\n** Why is there no keyboard shortcuts for these panels implemented at least? Question: How do I get keyboard shortcuts for this?\r\n** In general having to hover the mouse pointer in various places on the screen to get an insight of what the possibilities are is considered bad UI design by many. Try hovering on a tablet?? See also [http://ui-patterns.com/blog/User-Interface-AntiPatterns] about anti-patterns.\r\n\r\nWhat do I want:\r\n* I want to have the buttons that *filter* my issues act the same. They should all act like the quick filters which do not disappear. That would be consistent and useful.\r\n* I want to have keyboard shortcuts for these two important panels (and thanks for doing those in the first place btw.). ('p' and 'v' could be candidates)\r\n\r\nIt is evident that you are trying to make things look nice on a tablet - that is fine. But is is happening at the expense of where the tool is most often used: a browser on a PC with a proper keyboard and mouse. Please stop making things worse in the UI department.\r\n\r\nPlease see this as an opportunity to improve (fix UI mistakes) rather than a negative request to be ignored/archived. I have 100 users and we are working on scaling up to 500 on multiple sites so this is of some importance to my organisation that the UI is fast and usable.\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nPerhaps someone can shed some light on the suggestions that the user has?",

We use Epics for the hierarchy, and Stories are only used at the bottom. After we have our WBS, we do the sprint planning. To do the sprint planning based on the WBS, I need the Structure to be integrated with GreenHopper. Today, there is a mini Structure window in the right hand-side panel, and it shows the hierarchical Structure path to the issue highlighted on the rapid board. Instead of this, I need to see the entire Structure on one side of the screen (left), and the rapid board in planning mode on the other side (right). I want to be able to drag items from the Structure and drop them in a sprint on the rapid board in sprint planning mode.\r\n\r\nNext, I will need the issues in the Structure to be visually annotated with the Sprint number they have been dragged into. This way, when I look at the Structure, I will know which issues have been planned and which have not been planned yet.\r\n\r\nOther issues that might be related to this request:\r\nGHS-2136\r\nGHS-3922\r\nGHS-5356\r\nGHS-5667\r\nGHS-7690\r\nGHS-8044\r\nJRA-29180",

Admins can modify the workflow through JIRA, which will put it into a state that means Agile can no longer use it. However, Agile can still offer to simplify the workflow. This can result in confusion and also generates errors when trying to simplify it.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n# Create a project. Eg: TEST\r\n# Create multiple issues in project TEST\r\n# Create a board for this project and then change the workflow to Simplified Workflow Scheme in Agile\r\n# Edit the workflow \"Simplified Workflow Scheme\" for project TEST.\r\n# Edit the Draft and publish it. Eg: add new statuses and transition then, it appear as if the project TEST is not using Simplified Workflow Scheme in Agile\r\n# Go to the board again.\r\n# Click on the Simplified Workflow.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nThe workflow can be simplified, or it lists 'Agile Simplified Workflow unavailable'.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\n It will hang and throw the following error:\r\n{noformat}\r\n2015-06-26 03:55:52,035 http-bio-8080-exec-24922 ERROR jirasupport 235x11196994x1 1jkdqme 10.125.72.11,127.0.0.1 /rest/greenhopper/1.0/workflow/convert.json [common.error.jersey.ThrowableExceptionMapper] Uncaught exception thrown by REST service: The workflow is assigned to workflow schemes\r\ncom.atlassian.jira.workflow.WorkflowException: The workflow is assigned to workflow schemes\r\n\tat com.atlassian.jira.workflow.OSWorkflowManager.deleteWorkflow(OSWorkflowManager.java:495)\r\n\tat sun.reflect.GeneratedMethodAccessor13492.invoke(Unknown Source)\r\n\tat sun.reflect.DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.java:43)\r\n\tat java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Method.java:483)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.plugin.osgi.hostcomponents.impl.DefaultComponentRegistrar$ContextClassLoaderSettingInvocationHandler.invoke(DefaultComponentRegistrar.java:129)\r\n\tat com.sun.proxy.$Proxy385.deleteWorkflow(Unknown Source)  <+2> (DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.java:43)\r\n\tat java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Method.java:483)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.plugin.osgi.bridge.external.HostComponentFactoryBean$DynamicServiceInvocationHandler.invoke(HostComponentFactoryBean.java:154)\r\n\tat com.sun.proxy.$Proxy385.deleteWorkflow(Unknown Source)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.greenhopper.service.workflow.WorkflowServiceImpl.deleteWorkflow(WorkflowServiceImpl.java:312)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.greenhopper.service.workflow.SimplifiedWorkflowServiceImpl.deleteExistingNamedEntitiesIfNecessary(SimplifiedWorkflowServiceImpl.java:893)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.greenhopper.service.workflow.SimplifiedWorkflowServiceImpl.createSimplifiedWorkflowForExistingProject(SimplifiedWorkflowServiceImpl.java:547)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.greenhopper.web.rapid.view.WorkflowResource$5.call(WorkflowResource.java:330)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.greenhopper.web.rapid.view.WorkflowResource$5.call(WorkflowResource.java:312)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.greenhopper.web.util.RestCall.response(RestCall.java:42)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.greenhopper.web.AbstractResource.createResponse(AbstractResource.java:100)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.greenhopper.web.AbstractResource.response(AbstractResource.java:81)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.greenhopper.web.rapid.view.WorkflowResource.convertWorkflow(WorkflowResource.java:311)  <+2> (DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.java:43)\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nh3.

Workaround\r\n\r\nTo workaround this:\r\n\r\nh5. Step 1\r\n# Disable JIRA Agile (GreenHopper) from 'Manage Add-ons'.\r\n# Re-index data (this will succeed).\r\n# Run the [Database Integrity Checker|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Using+the+Database+Integrity+Checker] and resolve all the errors shown.\r\n# Re-enable JIRA Agile (GreenHopper).\r\n# Re-index again (full re-index).\r\n\r\nh5. Step 2 (if Step 1 does not resolve the issue)\r\n# Create a new database and point JIRA to this db.\r\n# Import a latest XML backup.\r\n\r\nh3. Notes\r\n\r\nThe second stack trace is caused by the issue being passed to {{getValueFromIssue}} in {{AbstractMultiCFType}} (in JIRA) being null. This is called from JIRA Agile's {{SprintCFType.getValueFromIssue}} method which checks for issue being a subtask first, so if the issue itself were null, it would have broken inside JIRA Agile code. It would appear that somehow sub-tasks are getting orphaned from their parent and this would cause these symptoms to occur.",

Expected Results\r\n\r\nThe board creates without problems.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nIt takes 10-15 minutes to create, maxes the CPU for 2.5 hours and can bring JIRA to a standstill (seems like GC is going nuts thrashing that mighty 10gb heap and spiking the CPU load).\r\n\r\nh3. Notes\r\n\r\nUnable to replicate locally. This is likely caused by the presence of the following:\r\n\r\n{noformat}\r\n select count(*), entitytype from sharepermissions group by 2 order by 1 desc;\r\n+----------+---------------+\r\n| count(*) | entitytype    |\r\n+----------+---------------+\r\n|     6997 | SearchRequest |\r\n|      624 | PortalPage    |\r\n\r\nselect count(*) from searchrequest;\r\n+----------+\r\n| count(*) |\r\n+----------+\r\n|    10749 |\r\n\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nSo 6.9k shared filters. Yikes.\r\n\r\nh3. Workarounds\r\n\r\nEither of the following will workaround this issue:\r\n\r\n* Block the {{/rest/greenhopper/1.0/rapidview/create/presets}} call on a reverse-proxy until this can be fixed. \r\n* Remove some unnecessary or unused filters.\r\n\r\nPlease take a look through the following docs for info on how to block URLs:\r\n\r\n* [Eight Ways to Blacklist with Apache\u2019s mod_rewrite|http://perishablepress.com/eight-ways-to-blacklist-with-apaches-mod_rewrite/].\r\n* [IIS 7.0 Request Filtering and URL Rewriting|http://www.iis.net/learn/extensions/url-rewrite-module/iis-request-filtering-and-url-rewriting].\r\n\r\nTo remove the filters:\r\n\r\n# Backup the JIRA database prior to making any changes. If available, run this on a test server first.\r\n# Identify which filters to delete with the following SQL. This will identify all users who have not logged in for 90 days and any filters owned by them:\r\n{code:SQL}\r\nSELECT \tu.id AS user_id,\r\n\tu.lower_user_name,\r\n\tu.display_name,\r\n\tto_timestamp(CAST (a.attribute_value as float)/1000) AS last_login,\r\n\ts.filtername,\r\n\ts.id AS filter_id\r\n\t\r\nFROM \tcwd_user u\r\n\r\nJOIN \tcwd_user_attributes a\r\nON \tu.id=a.user_id \r\n\r\nJOIN\tsearchrequest s\r\nON\tu.lower_user_name = s.username\r\n\r\nWHERE \tattribute_name = 'lastAuthenticated'\r\nAND\tto_timestamp(CAST (a.attribute_value as float)/1000) <= current_date - 90;\r\n{code}\r\n(i) This is PostgreSQL and may require modifying based on your DBMS.\r\n# Execute the following DELETEs to remove the filters using the {{searchrequest.id}} (filter_id from the previous query).\r\n{code:SQL}\r\nDELETE FROM favouriteassociations WHERE entitytype='SearchRequest' AND entityid='10000'\r\nDELETE FROM sharepermissions WHERE entityid='10000' AND entitytype='SearchRequest'\r\nDELETE FROM searchrequest WHERE ID='10000'\r\n{code}\r\n(i) This will remove all entries for the filter with an id of '10000'.\r\n# Test the instance. If all is OK, attempt to create a new board.\r\n\r\nTo identify any filters used within Gadgets, the following SQL may be used:\r\n\r\n{code:SQL}\r\nSELECT \tp.pagename AS dashboard_name,\r\n\ts.filtername,\r\n\ts.id AS filter_id\r\n\r\nFROM \tportalpage p\r\n\r\nJOIN \tgadgetuserpreference g\r\nON \tp.id = g.portletconfiguration\r\n\r\nJOIN\tsearchrequest s\r\nON\tsubstring(g.userprefvalue from '[0-9]+')::integer = s.id\r\n\r\nWHERE \tp.username = 'admin'\r\nAND \tuserprefkey = 'filterId';\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nThis example will return gadgets for the admin user.\r\n\r\n",
