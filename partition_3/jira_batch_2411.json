      "description": "YML anchors are useful for referencing and reusing common configuration in the bitbucket-pipelines.yml file however you can\u2019t use them to merge arrays ([https://github.com/yaml/yaml/issues/35|https://github.com/yaml/yaml/issues/35]). Due to this limitation it\u2019s not possible to reference a subset of commands in the script list, for example:\n\n{code}\nconfigure_settings: &configure_settings\n  - pipe: docker://atlassian/download-settings:1.0\n  - ./copy-settings-to-user-home.sh\n\npipelines:\n  default:\n    - step:\n        script:\n          - *configure_settings\n          - echo \"unique command 1\"\n    - step:\n        script:\n          - *configure_settings\n          - echo \"unique command 2\"\n{code}\n\nAnother way to extract and reuse common operations is to use [pipes|https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/pipes-958765631.html] however pipes are run in a separate docker container to the main build container and so common script executed within a pipe can not affect the build environment (such as environment variables and files outside the build directory). As a workaround users have been partially extracting an operation to a pipe and running additional commands afterwards to complete the operation. Furthermore these commands still need to be duplicated in every step, for example:\n\n{code}\npipelines:\n  default:\n    - step:\n        script:\n          - pipe: docker://atlassian/download-settings:1.0\n          - ./copy-settings-to-user-home.sh\n          - echo \"unique command 1\"\n    - step:\n        script:\n          - pipe: docker://atlassian/download-settings:1.0\n          - ./copy-settings-to-user-home.sh\n          - echo \"unique command 2\"\n{code}\n\nIf pipes were allowed to execute in the build container, the full operation could be extracted to the pipe. A containerless pipe could of course still execute a docker run command to bring in additional tooling solving both requirements.\n\n{code}\npipelines:\n  default:\n    - step:\n        script:\n          - pipe: docker://atlassian/configure-settings:1.0\n          - echo \"unique command 1\"\n    - step:\n        script:\n          - pipe: docker://atlassian/configure-settings:1.0\n          - echo \"unique command 2\"\n{code}",
