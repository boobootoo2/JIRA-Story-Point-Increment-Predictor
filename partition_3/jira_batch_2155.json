[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFSERVER-29161].\n  {panel}\n\nNote to Atlassians: PLEASE do not change the text here to leave out vital detail, it clearly causes confusion among your own staff!...\n\nWhen editing a page and creating a link to what should become a new page you no longer get the choice to create that page from a template. \n\nThis was possible in the old editor. \n\n(Insert link to Create Page) \n\nNOTE: This is a clone of CONF-23884, which you claim to have solved with the *Create from Template Macro* but that macro has nothing to do with this issue. It doesn't even come close to cover it or providing a workaround. \n\nThe workflow requested here is what you could do in 3.X. \n\nWorkflow: \n1. Edit Page \n2. Type: [somelink \n3. Select \"Insert link to create page\" \n4. Save \n5. Click link \n6. Here I would like to be able to select a template! \n\n---- \n\nSince the link is already treated in a special way linking to e.g.: \n\n{code} \nhttp://wiki/pages/createpage.action?spaceKey=x&title=Link+Here&linkCreation=true&fromPageId=12820509 \n{code} \n\nI think this could be solved very easy by rendering a dropdown with the same to options as you have under \"Add\"... \nThe other link being: \n{code} \nhttp://wiki/pages/createpage-choosetemplate.action?spaceKey=x&newSpaceKey=x&fromPageId=12820509 \n{code} \n\nSo instead of rendering the following: \n\n{code:language=html} \n<a class=\"createlink\" href=\"/pages/createpage.action?spaceKey=x&amp;title=Link+Here&amp;linkCreation=true&amp;fromPageId=12820509\">Link Here</a> \n{code} \n\nyou could maybe render something like: \n\n{code:language=html} \n<div onclick=\"$(this).children('div').toggle()\" \n     style=\"display: inline-block; width: auto; position: relative;\"> \n    Link Here that is very very very long long long \n    <div style=\"position: absolute; background: #ddd; display: none; width: 100%;\"> \n        <a style=\"display:block\" \n           href=\"/pages/createpage.action?spaceKey=x&title=Link+Here&linkCreation=true&fromPageId=12820509\"> \n            Create Blank Page \n        </a> \n        <a style=\"display:block\" \n           href=\"/pages/createpage-choosetemplate.action?spaceKey=x&newSpaceKey=x&title=Link+Here&fromPageId=12820509\"> \n            Create from Template \n        </a> \n    </div> \n</div> \n{code} \n\nThe onclick is just an example of how it could be under jQuery, obviously the formatting is ugly here, but it shows that it could properly be done fairly simple... \n\nThe \"createpage-choosetemplate.action\" with title works. \n\nOr HELL!!!.... Just render: \n\n{code:language=html} \n<a class=\"createlink\" href=\"/pages/createpage.action?spaceKey=x&amp;title=Link+Here&amp;linkCreation=true&amp;fromPageId=12820509\">Link Here</a> \n<a class=\"createlink\" href=\"/pages/createpage-choosetemplate.action?spaceKey=x&amp;title=Link+Here&amp;linkCreation=true&amp;fromPageId=12820509\">[Select Template]</a> \n{code} \n\n---- \n\nThe important thing is: \n * You get to choose the template when you choose to create the page, rather than being dictated by the one inserting a macro. \n * The link turns into a real page link after and can no longer be used to create additional new pages",

Problem Definition\nEdit in Office permissions are currently set via giving a user Page Add permission. While this made sense when Confluence used the View File macro to embed Office content into a Confluence page - and thus editing the Office document was essentially the same as editing the page - it does not hold true anymore. The new File Preview experience clearly emphasizes the fact that Office documents are attachments, and it can be confusing to set Page Add permissions for operations involving attachments.\n\nh3.

I used Firebug to get font size from XML-content in code-macro panel; it has increased from 12px to 14px and line-height from 15 to 20 - making the code bigger than it needs to be. Code is normally for reference and does not have the same requirement of readability.\n\nIt is not a big deal in a browser, although it makes it difficult to get an overview. A bigger problem is when I want to export the page to PDF, the code-blocks breaks over several pages which is ugly.\n\nI have not succeeded in decreasing the font size for a code-macro block with the PDF Stylesheet in Space Admin.

Few things we\u2019re interested in:\n- interactions that happen in OSQA are visible in Confluence\u2019s notifications box\n- labels in OSQA are the same as those in Confluence, allowing users to find related stuff and subscribe\n- searchability from Confluence to both databases\n- merged profiles \n- merged activity streams\n",

However, the alt for these stars is:\n\nalt=\"(red star)\"\nalt=\"(star)\"\nalt=\"(green star)\"\n\nAlternative text should never have the parentheses unless needed to represent parenthetical information, which wouldn't include stars.\n\nIn addition, since you are providing multi-color stars, the color is important.  Perhaps not in all cases, but since it is in some it is necessary to include the color for all of the stars.

Steps to reproduce:\n# Insert a relative link to a Confluence page via Insert > Web Link > Address: /conf43/display/ds/test\n# Save the page and you can see that the domain address is appended to the relative path e.g. http://www.atlassian.com/conf43/display/ds/test\n\nConfluence no longer supports writing a web link as a relative URL, however you can get around this still by inserting a non-web link. If you look at the instructions on [Linking to Pages|https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/uADGDg], the following ways will work effectively as relative links:\n\n# Adding a link using autocomplete\n# Adding a link using the Insert Link dialog (either search or recently viewed)\n\nThis kind of link does not store the base URL of your Confluence instance, it refers to the page by the (space id, page id) pair. This also means that if the page name changes, then the link will still work. If you left the link text the same as the page name originally, then it should automatically update to the new page name as well.\n\nWhile the methods described above works for a single page, you cannot use autocomplete or the search to find the rss action page. For instance, you'd like to make a relative link to an rss feed such as this:\n{code}\n/createrssfeed.action?types=page&spaces=conf_all&title=pagename&labelString=work&excludedSpaceKeys %3D&sort=modified&maxResults=30&timeSpan=30&showContent=true&confirm=Create+RSS+Feed&os_authType=basic{code}\n\nThe methods described won't work because the link is not a Confluence page. Using the insert link dialog, you can insert this relative link as a web link but it will be saved as a absolute link instead. This is also becoming a problem when you are trying to move a staging server to a production server. You'll have to manually change the link individually to match the current production domain. ",

We are trying to script uploading files around 80MB in size and this usually causes our site to crash. Support said this was because of a bug in the SOAP (Axis) library. I also tried using xml-rpc with the same result. Which I think is really an out of memory problem on the hosted site. Support recommended the REST API but from what I see it only supports reads, not adding/modifying/uploading content?\n\nCould the Confluence REST API be updated to support uploading of attachments, or either the SOAP or XML-RPC interfaces allow large files (80MB) on the hosted site? \n\nOr just add more heap space to our site if that would solve the issue.\n\nthanks,",

This feature will search the whole Confluence instance and pick the most popular content based on votes and comments. Since this feature include the whole Confluence instance, there is a big possibility that Confluence missed important updates from spaces they have included as their favorite space(s). \n\nBy having recommended updates for each user favorite space(s), Confluence user will get a more specific updates from their preferred content genre such as IT Department Space or Accounting Department Space.\n\nh4. Proposed Implementation\n\nI proposed, recommended updates per favorite space which can be configured, for example:\n\n* Space A -- Recommended Updates -- Send out in Monday\n* Space B -- Recommended Updates -- Send out in Wednesday\n\nFor example, a Confluence content regarding an event discussion such as dinner get more votes and comment compared with a procedure updates from talent department.",
