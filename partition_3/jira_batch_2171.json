However I did find some more that are relevant, buried away in the end-user documentation (eg re: embedding JIRA links), so it will be quite a chore to go through and find all of those. If I had to do this for the admin documentation as well, it would be a massive task, and this would rather make the idea of a local copy of the documentation impractical for such purposes.\n\nThe online instructions for all this were really quite misleading. They imply that 3 further workspaces (dependencies) are required, but in fact none of those 3 seem to be required by the 3.5 documentation, whereas many other workspaces are required but are not available. The red links wouldn't have caused us so much confusion if they had been documented in those instructions. And of course those red links could have been fixed by Atlassian before doing the XML export.\n\nAlong the way, I found a couple more aspects:\n\n- 'nomarkup' and 'hide' user macros appear; obviously I could look those up and install them if required but that too is not documented in the instructions.\n- In the case of the Sharepoint Connector Guide section, this uses an 'include' macro to include contents of another space, and I don't think that can be redirected to the online version in the way you described earlier. That's not a problem for us, because we don't use the Connector, but it could be an issue for anybody who does.\n\n{quote}",

If necessary anyone in the team should be able to click on the document, bringing it into edit mode and we could redraw live as necessary.\n\nWorkaround: \n- Create the Google Drawing\n- Export it as PNG\n- Attach the PNG to the Confluence page\n- Copy the Google Docs link\n- Add the Google Docs link to the Confluence page\n- Do the review session\n- Modify the Google Drawing\n- Export it as PNG\n- Attach the new PNG to the Confluence page\n\nSuggested Solutions:\n\nThe ideal integration would just embed the Google Drawing into the Confluence page and anyone who wants to edit it could click on an \"Edit\"-link. \nClicking on \"Edit\" would load the drawing into Google Docs.\n\nThe good-enough-solution would be to support drawings in the Widget Connector \nnot requiring the publishing step in Google Docs, but just using the Google Docs link that has /edit at the end \n\nThe goal must be to allow us to collaborate on the drawing, not requiring a manual update of links or attachments. The envisioned interaction is like the Balsamiq plug-in in a Google-Docs-Link-multi-user mode.\n\n ",

(I mean, they're already there, no copying needed).\n\nThe current Confluence documentation on installation says to modify \"confluence/WEB-INF/classes/confluence-init.properties\" directly. But creating a file under \"edit-webapp/WEB-INF/classes/confluence-init.properties\" works just as well. And it's easier to see what changes need to be made before building and deploying new upgrades. Saves me a second glance over the release documentation.\n\nCould be related to this request CONF-11078 ? (I think that could be closed)",

This pages shows, on the right hand side, a grey box offering several search filters: \"Where\", \"What\", \"When\" and \"Who\".\n\nThese search filters are distracting for our users, because most of the options offered make no sense in our configuration. More precisely:\n\n\"Where\" - The normal users access the wiki without login and the wiki is configured to consist of only *one* public space - so there is nothing to choose for these users. Things like \"personal spaces\" and \"global spaces\" only irritate average users, since they don't know (and need not know) what those mean.\n\n\"What\" - Out users expect that a search searches on the wiki. Period.\n- News-Entries - we don't have any news enabled.\n- Comments - We don't use them either (our wiki is a documentation, not a discussion forum)\n- Profile, Email - Users don't care about this either\n\n\"When\" and \"Where\" - Those public users (not logged in) simply don't care who wrote the documentation when, neither should they care!\n\n\nThere are two improvements i'd like to suggest:\n1. Make the \"Where\" and \"What\" filters more intelligent to only show options that make sense given the user group's permissions and the wiki's enabled/disabled features.\n\nand/or (my preferred solution)\n2. Make it configurable which search filters are available to which user groups. Our customers have asked us whether we can hide the grey filter box completely for public users, and I can understand perfectly well that these filters indeed don't help them. For admins, however, they can be useful.\n\nMatthias Basler",

This procedure is inconvenient and oftentimes confusing.\n\nInstead, Confluence should automatically add the user to the Internal Directory if no other directory can be modified, and give a choice to the user if there are multiple possible directories (e.g. 'Confluence Internal Directory' and 'Internal with LDAP Authentication').\n\nThis behavior would also be more consistent with the user management behavior in JIRA.",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFSERVER-25146].\n  {panel}\n\nHi All,\n\nlet me ask for a help: is there a wikimarkup or macro we can automatically sort the headings in a pge in Confluence? There is a page in our company where are important infos about applications are listed (more than 100). The content is continuinely gaining with new application infos.\nA heading= name of the application\n\nBut to find the correct place of an application name is very cumbersome. So it would be very helpful if we could add the new content to the end of the page and after save the new content jumps to its correct place in the alphabetically order.\n\nTanks for your suggestions!\n\n \n\nBest Regards,\n\nRumi\n",

[See the corresponding bug report|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFSERVER-25145].\n  {panel}\n\nIn the Confluence 4.x editor, when the newline preceding a heading is deleted, the heading is reformatted to plain text. For example, when I have this text in the editor (as if it were entered using wikitext):\n\n{noformat}\nh1. First heading\nSome text\nh2. Second heading\nMore text\n{noformat}\n\nWhen I do this:\n\n- Place cursor at the beginning of the word \"Some\"\n- Hold shift and press down-arrow\n- Press delete\n\nI expect to end up with this:\n\n{noformat}\nh1. First heading\nh2. Second heading\nMore text\n{noformat}\n\nBut instead I end up with this:\n\n{noformat}\nh1. First heading\nSecond heading\nMore text\n{noformat}\n\nMy heading formatting is lost. This is inconsistent with at least two other scenarios: (1) Deleting a newline preceding a bulleted list, and (2) Deleting a newline preceding a block of preformatted text, both of which retain the formatting of the text that follows the newline, which I think is correct/expected behavior.\n\nHere is a [more detailed description of the issue|http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Confluence+4.0+Editor+-+Customer+Feedback?focusedCommentId=277252891#comment-277252891].\n",

We've got to ideads in mind, on the one hand we need an additional Check Box on the LogIn Page with a Link to a PDF File , which contains the Guideline Terms, without checking it the user must not be able to log in, and there has to be something like a mark in the user directory set to each user who already accepted the guidlines; furthermore if the designated Administrator would update the PDF File, every user must accept the updated terms before being able to log in.\n\nThe other idea was , having a Wiki Page containing the Guidline to which every User is redirected after Logging in, to accept the Guidline in case of not accepting there must be a fall back to the log in screen.\n\nAnyway , is it possible to hook up something like this?\n\nps.\nI've attached a possible mockup\n\n",
