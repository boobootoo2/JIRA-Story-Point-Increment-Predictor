The Project is really my project portfolio, and each task represents a potential project that could impact one or more of our systems. I have one board that I want to use with the stakeholders to establish the overall priority of the initiatives. The card format is very useful for visualizing everything in the portfolio and allowing us to reorder priorties on the fly. (I have two basic columns for this -- \"Unprioritized\" and \"Prioritized.\")\r\nI have another board I want to use to track the progress of the requirements definition. I have two statuses defined in my custom workflow - \"Prioritized\" and \"Defining.\" What I'd love to be able to do is display all the initiatives in priority (RANK) order and drag the cards between \"Prioritized\" and \"Defining,\" but not allow the rank assigned to the card on the planning board (whose column \"Prioritized\" contains both statuses, \"Prioritized\" and \"Defining\") to be modified on this screen. When I remove the \"Order by\" clause in the filter it disables the RANK feature, but it also displays the cards in random order, making it difficult for the team to quickly see what should be their next priority for their requirements process.

However, the original estimate is not directly defined on the stories. Instead of that, we detail our stories in subtasks, we inform the original estimate (effort) for all the subtasks and, after that, JIRA just INDIRECTLY accumulates the sum of its subtasks as the story's original estimate.\r\n\r\nThe problem is (please see screenshots attached):\r\n- Scrum Board (Plan mode) does not show the sum of estimated hours on the respective spot.\r\n- Due that, Scrum Board (Report mode) - Velocity Chart - also does not show the chart with the information registered. The bar chart demonstrates no information, because it does not recognize the amount of hours (remaining / registered) on subtasks.\r\n\r\nAfter a quick test, I've discovered:\r\n- The features mentioned above ONLY WORKS if the hour estimates (original time estimate) were informed DIRECTLY on the stories. It means, a story WITH NO subtasks.\r\n\r\nIn short, this situation does not fit for us. We really need to decompose our stories in subtasks and, after that, simply let the scrum rapid board (no matter the mode [plan | work | report]) do its job.\r\n\r\nFinally, if you need more information, please just let a comment.\r\n\r\nThanks!",

      "description": "h3. Summary\r\n\r\nWhen installing JIRA Agile through to Add-on Manager, it hangs on installation. If installing it by putting it into {{$JIRA_HOME/plugins/installed-plugins}} and starting up JIRA, JIRA may appear unresponsive.\r\n\r\nThis is due to upgrade tasks running for instances with large amounts fixVersions (e.g.: 10k+). It can be verified with the following:\r\n\r\n{code:SQL}\r\nSELECT count(*) \r\nFROM   projectversion; \r\n{code}\r\n\r\nIf this returns more than 5k records you may be affected by this bug.\r\n\r\n(!) Instances with this many fix versions should be reviewed as it's likely they are being created automatically and unintentionally. It's not expected that an instance would ever have this many fix versions.\r\n\r\nh3. About the Upgrade Task\r\n\r\nJIRA Agile implemented version.startDate before JIRA had the equivalent of this - JIRA now has it's own version of startDate for versions. This upgrade task checks and pushes any startDates stored with JIRA Agile back into the JIRA data if available.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n# Startup a JIRA instance with a large amount of versions (say 20k+).\r\n# Install JIRA Agile.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nThe application installs and upgrades seamlessly.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nThe screen sits on the add-on installation for a decent amount of time and then times out.\r\n\r\n(i) Any attempts to access the Add-on Manager will kick off the upgrade attempt again.\r\n\r\nh3. Notes\r\n\r\nMultiple attempts at proceeding with the upgrade may fix this, as the upgrade tasks could eventually complete.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nThis can be worked around by modifying the database to tell JIRA Agile the versions have been migrated as per the below. This does mean that start dates will *not* be pushed back to JIRA from JIRA Agile.\r\n\r\n# Backup JIRA.\r\n# Stop JIRA.\r\n# Run the following SQL:\r\n{code:SQL}\r\nINSERT INTO propertyentry \r\nVALUES      ((SELECT seq_id \r\n              FROM   sequence_value_item \r\n              WHERE  seq_name = 'OSPropertyEntry'), \r\n             'GreenHopper.properties', \r\n             1, \r\n             'GreenHopper.JIRA60.Version.Migration', \r\n             1); \r\n\r\nINSERT INTO propertynumber \r\nVALUES      ((SELECT seq_id \r\n              FROM   sequence_value_item \r\n              WHERE  seq_name = 'OSPropertyEntry'), \r\n             1); \r\n\r\nUPDATE sequence_value_item \r\nSET    seq_id = (SELECT seq_id \r\n                 FROM   sequence_value_item \r\n                 WHERE  seq_name = 'OSPropertyEntry') \r\n                + 10 \r\nWHERE  seq_name = 'OSPropertyEntry'; \r\n{code}\r\n(i) This is tested with PostgreSQL and may require changing depending upon the DBMS used.\r\n# Start JIRA.\r\n# Test by installing JIRA Agile.\r\n# If there are any problems, rollback to the backed up instance.\r\n\r\nh3. Fix\r\n\r\nUpgrade JIRA to 6.3.4 or higher and then perform the upgrade - this problem will not be encountered.",
