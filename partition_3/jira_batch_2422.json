Moreover, different steps in the pipeline may only need small parts of it.\n\nIt would be desirable to have support for https://proandroiddev.com/speed-up-your-build-with-gradle-remote-build-cache-2ee9bfa4e18. As it allows to incrementelly check whether a given task has already been performed.\n\nA simple HTTP repository would already  suffice for it. In other project we made use of Artifactory generic repositories for this purpose. Or if no such feature is planned, it would be useful if there is a possiblity to know the location of the pipeline runners and allow the manual placements by customers (us) next to them.

      "description": "A couple of years ago a bitbucket-hosted project merged a pull request we submitted, and we were @&#x27;ed in the commit message:\n\nhttps://bitbucket.org/LaNMaSteR53/recon-ng/commits/9fdc4d7e7cd4f255e3ebea9552d242faae182841\n\nThat generated a notification email as expected; \"Email me about... Someone mentioning me\" is enabled.\n\nEver since then, apparently every time someone forks the LaNMaSteR53/recon-ng repo, we get another notification from that old 2017-04-17 commit 9fdc4d7.\n\nI thought this might be a FAQ but didn&#x27;t find anything from searching for a few obvious keywords.\n\nIt really doesn&#x27;t make sense to regurgitate old notifications every time a project is forked, it&#x27;s wasteful of bitbucket.org resources and it spams your users/contributors to hosted projects.",
