Background\n\nThe REST API call that retrieves a list of questions ({{/rest/questions/1.0/questions}}) includes the voting details of each question and the answers belonging to each question. The voting details are of the form:\n{code}\n {\"up\":0,\"down\":0,\"total\":6,\"upVoted\":true,\"downVoted\":false}\n{code}\n\nwhere 'total' is the total number of votes (after subtracting downvotes from upvotes) and 'upVoted' and 'downVoted' records the vote the user making the API call has made (if any).\n\nh3. Problem\nThe 'up' and 'down' fields are meant to show how many total upvotes and downvotes a question/answer has had, independent of who's making the API call. However, they always show as 0.\n\nh3. Expected behaviour\nEither the 'up' and 'down' fields should show the actual number of up/down votes a question/answer has had or those fields should not be returned in this API call at all.\n\nh3. Workaround\nThis data can be obtained by querying the votes for the question or answer directly, i.e. {{/rest/questions/1.0/vote/question/QID}} or {{/rest/questions/1.0/vote/answer/AID}}.",

To maintain the integrity in the way points are awarded for questions in CQ, some sort of CSRF token can be generated for all upvotes and downvote requests.\n\nPoC:\n\n1. Obtain the ID of the question/answer which you wish to upvote. Hovering over the date listed on the question will reveal the ID of the question/answer e.g. *524305*\n2. Construct a link which upvotes a given ID on GET request: e.g.\n{{https://cquestionspentest.atlassian.net/wiki/cq/upvote.action?answerId=524305&src=email}}\n3. Post a comment, but intercept the request, replacing the body parameter with the following:\n{noformat}\n<p><img class=\"confluence-embedded-image\" title=\"null > blah.jpg\" src=\"https://cquestionspentest.atlassian.net/wiki/cq/upvote.action?answerId=524305&src=email\" data-image-src=/wiki/cq/upvote.action?answerId=524305&src=email?version=1&amp;modificationDate=1403481880299&amp;api=v2\" data-linked-resource-id=\"884750\" data-linked-resource-type=\"attachment\" data-linked-resource-default-alias=\"/wiki/cq/upvote.action?answerId=524305&src=email\" data-base-url=\"https://cquestionspentest.atlassian.net/wiki/cq/upvote.action?answerId=524305&src=email\"></p>\n{noformat}\n4.

The UI to redeem these items can be accessed from the user's own profile page in Confluence.  However, there's a few issues with this:\n\n1) The URL is https://answers.atlassian.com/plugins/swag/myswag.action - not very memorable. We should consider aliasing it to something like \"answers.atlassian.com/swag\", like it was on the old system.\n\n2) The Confluence user profile is buried pretty deep in Atlassian Answers due to the fact we're operating Confluence Questions in \"standalone\" mode.  It takes 2-3 clicks to find the swag UI from the Answers homepage.\n\n3) Users aren't notified when they are eligible to claim new items of swag.  We need to rely on the user checking back regularly to know when they've earned something.\n",

If you enable the Confluence Spaces plugin, go to global permissions and enable *Use Confluence* permissions for anonymous users, then it works as expected once the Confluence Spaces plugin is disabled again.\n\n\n",
