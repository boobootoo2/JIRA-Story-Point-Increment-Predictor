Issue Summary\r\n\r\nIn Confluence when the user creates an anchor in order to be able to click on a link and be redirected to a specific part of the page, if the same is being retrieved by using a *Page Properties Report* macro (that will carry content from the original Page Properties macro), it will not work.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# In Confluence, make sure to create a new page using the *Page Properties macro* and insert content inside the same. It's required to create tables to insert the content, so it will be displayed on the target page.\r\n# In addition to the random content, make sure to add a link pointing to an anchor and insert this anchor *outside of the page properties macro*\r\n# Put a label on this page, so it will be used later, on the target page.\r\n# Publish the page\r\n# Now, create a second page and insert the *Page properties report* macro and make sure to point it to the previously created page\r\n# Publish the new page\r\n# Tap the link that would redirect you to the anchor outside of the macro\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nThe link should redirect the user to the target page, at the specific part of the same.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nTapping the link will do nothing. Only the URL will change to point to the anchor.\r\n\r\nh3. Notes\r\n\r\n* If you put the anchor *inside* the Page Properties macro, it will work on the target page.\r\n* When observing the phenomenon, the URL changes to be adapted to the anchor, but, the page ID remains the same.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\n* Put the anchor *inside* the page properties macro so the link will redirect it to the correct location.\r\n* Manually copy the URL that would work with the anchor, on the original page and then, paste it on the *Web link* option. This way, it will redirect the user to the correct location on the page.",

So they want the Confluence team to help them test it.\u00a0\r\nh3. More details from the team\r\n\r\nHi,\r\n \u00a0\r\n We're working on the following issue:\r\n [https://ecosystem.atlassian.net/browse/ACG-16]\r\n In short: we have to change implementation of HttpClientFetcher to use outbound proxy mechanism.\r\n We implemented it and tested on Jira Cloud:\r\n [https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-cloud-gadgets/pull-requests/90/issue-kitkat-1430-outbound-proxy]\r\n \u00a0\r\n We spend a lot of time and encountered a lot of problems when we wanted to test gadgets (with or without our modifications) in Confluence Cloud. Unfortunately we're not able to spend more time on it.\r\n \u00a0\r\n Could you test our solution and provide feedback for the following questions:\r\n # Does Confluence build and run smoothly with our changes without enabling the below FF?\r\n # Do Gadgets work properly with on our code when you set FF \"gadgets.opensocial.http-client-fetcher.outbound.proxy\" =\u00a0*true*?\r\n\r\nPlease take into account that checking FF value is provided by DarkFeatureManager, which checks the value once (on startup, from system properties). Therefore if you want to enable our changes locally you need to provide it from system properties or just set\u00a0isOutboundProxyEnabled()\u00a0to return true manually in the code.\r\n \u00a0\r\n If you confirmed that our changes are safe for Confluence then we will roll out it for Jira. Then we will share all of our results and conclusions with you to make yours rollout easier.\r\n \u00a0\r\n Regards,\r\n Luke\r\nh3. Environment\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\nh3. Steps to Test\u00a0\r\n\r\nI have spoken with Leo on how we could help them test this. Here are the steps:\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n # Get connie launcher working on green_master (conf + jira instance)\r\n # Test gadgets (edit page -> macro browser -> insert a jira gadget ^)\r\n # Checkout their branch on atlassian-cloud-gadgets and build it\r\n # Bump `<atlassian.gadgets.version>5.1.48-SNAPSHOT</atlassian.gadgets.version>` to the built jar version in the confluence root pom file\r\n # bin/vertigo build -r && bin/vertigo restart\r\n # Ensure the version is bumped: `/wiki/plugins/servlet/upm/manage/all` and find the gadget plugin version\r\n # Test gadgets\r\n # Enable the dark feature they mentioned `confluence-core/confluence/src/etc/java/darkfeature.properties`\r\n # Check that it\u2019s enabled `/wiki/admin/darkfeatures.action`\r\n # Test gadgets\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nJira Gadgets are working as expected.\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nCurrently they haven't been able to test the gadgets integration\r\nh3. Notes\r\n\r\n(Optional - If Necessary)\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nCurrently there is no known workaround for this behavior. A workaround will be added here when available",

Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n # Create a Confluence Page\r\n # With highlighting, create a Jira issue from within that page's content\r\n # Go to the Jira issue - verify that it has created a link to the Confluence page with a *Mentioned On* title\r\n # Go to the Confluence page - verify that it contains a count of Jira Issue Links in that page - the count should be at 1\r\n # Edit the page and remove the Jira macro linked\r\n # Publish the page\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n * In the Jira issue, there should be no links to Confluence\r\n * In the Confluence page, there should be a 0 count of issues linked or don't show the count at all\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n * In Jira, the page is still linked as *Mentioned On*\r\n * In Confluence, the Jira Issue Links count still displays 1\r\n\r\nh3.
