      "description": "Bitbucket resolves HEAD to the commit-ID and adds that to all followup links on the entry page of a repository. That enforces that you stay on the same commit when clicking around, and I get that this does have a benefit, too, but it&#x27;s not what you usually want nor expect at least for wikis.\n\nSome people call that perma-linking, but a perma-link in blogs also only permanently refers to a particular post, not a particular version of it.\n\nHaving URLs for particular versions is certainly a good thing, but I think it should not be what you get by default. People will hit reload and not see the change, or people will publish such links and people visiting them will get stale content without realizing.\n\nSo, all of this is my analysis (while checking if Bitbucket is suitable for us as a wiki), and call it theoretical, but I really wonder whether whoever decided to put commit-IDs into the URLs by default didn&#x27;t also do it purely on theoretical grounds.\n\nI&#x27;m proposing one or multiple of these changes:\n\n* link without commit ID by default (it&#x27;s probably a good idea to still provide a link on each page to get the same page tied to the current commit ID in the HEAD)\n* optionally add a per-repository setting to select which behaviour (with or without commit ID) should be the default\n* when formatting a page for a URL _with_ commit id, add a flashy marker to the top of the page that says \"this page has been modified. [reload the newest version]\" with the link or button going to the newest version (either newly resolved commit ID in the URL, or no commit ID). Care should be taken so that if you scrolls down, then hit reload, you still get to see this notification somehow (make the marker stick to the top of the window instead of the page? Use JavaScript and floating notification instead?)\n\nI get that linking to a particular commit has the nice advantage that it will always find the page (it could have been deleted or moved for newer commits); to keep this advantage, you could track renames (git already has that functionality, you&#x27;d have to parse it and build a searchable (and perhaps incrementally updatable) data structure out of it). It may be useful to actually keep the commit-ID in the URLs and go with the notification approach suggested above.\n\nI think the current behaviour is rather problematic for wikis, so I leave the priority at major: we will likely move our wiki elsewhere once more than 2-3 devs uses it (unless the behaviour has changed in the mean time).",

      "description": "Hi,\n\nWe want to streamline the boot of our docker image and have inserted a startup.sh file on our docker image that at startup time launches services like REDIS / MONGODB and APACHE.\n\nAs far as we can now see the problem is that startup.sh is never executed since pipelines create an ENTRYPOINT and bash file for the compiled bitbucket-pipeline.yml instructions and then executes this bash file when starting the container.\n\nMongoDB can then only be executed via a --fork, as a service. So it will not freeze the bash script. It works.. but booting up a docker container then takes an extra 5 minutes before other bash commands can be executed.\n\nIts a working work around.. but is it possible that the CMD in the docker container is executed first? Or does that create more problems on your end?\n\nKind regards,\n\nGerhard Richard Edens",

Suggested Solution\nGive repo admins the option to bulk-delete issues, or delete all issues in issue tracker.\n\nh3. Workaround\n# Delete issues one by one.\n# Write a script that uses the [API|https://developer.atlassian.com/bitbucket/api/2/reference/resource/repositories/%257Busername%257D/%257Brepo_slug%257D/issues/%257Bissue_id%257D] to remove issues.",

      "description": "Hi,\\\\\nI noted that Bitbucket UI allow only a \"plain merge\" instead of \"git merge --no-ff\".\n\nAs I know, the --no-ff flag causes the merge to always create a new commit object, even if the merge could be performed with a fast-forward. This avoids losing information about the historical existence of a feature branch and groups together all commits that together added the feature.\n\nWith a \"plain merge\", it is impossible to see from the Git history which of the commit objects together have implemented a feature\u2014you would have to manually read all the log messages. Reverting a whole feature (i.e. a group of commits), is a true headache in the current situation, whereas it is easily done if the \"--no-ff\" flag was used.\n\nYes, it will create a few more (empty) commit objects, but the gain is much bigger than the cost.\n\nPlease, can you consdier to add ability for users to toggle merge type in BitBucket?\n\nI merged some days ago my Develop branch to Master and with BitBucket merge I now find all previous develop commits into merge, while I thought to find only a final big commits on master.\n\nThank you",
