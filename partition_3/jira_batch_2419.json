      "description": "It would be handy to have commands available to the pipeline for management of deployment and repository variables. I realise there is an API to handle this but a simple one line command would be much more practical.\n\nMy use case is that I have pipelines to create a a number of AWS CloudFormation stacks and for deployment of applications to AWS. I want to store some information about these stacks and applications somewhere that can be passed to future pipelines e.g. Elastic Beanstalk EnvironmentId, ApplicationName, EnvironmentName, StackId etc. These values change due to blue/green deployments, new stacks being spun up and old ones being terminated. Manually changing them is error prone and writing code to make api calls for a simple variable update seems overkill.\n\nI have worked around this by storing the information in AWS SSM ParameterStore which works well.\n\nAn example of retrieving a value from here is as simple as:\n\n{code}\n#!bash\nexport EB_APP_NAME=$(aws ssm get-parameter --name /eb/$1/$ENV/application-name --query &#x27;Parameter.Value&#x27; --output text)\nexport EB_ENVIRONMENT_ID=$(aws ssm get-parameter --name /eb/$1/$ENV/environment-id --query &#x27;Parameter.Value&#x27; --output text)\nexport EB_ENVIRONMENT_NAME=$(aws ssm get-parameter --name /eb/$1/$ENV/environment-name --query &#x27;Parameter.Value&#x27; --output text)\n{code}\n\nAnd overwriting an existing parameter using Boto3:\n\n{code}\n#!python\n\nssmClient.put_parameter(\n            Name=&#x27;/eb/&#x27; + application_name + &#x27;/&#x27; + env_type + &#x27;/environment-name&#x27;,\n            Value=env[&#x27;EnvironmentName&#x27;],\n            Description=&#x27;Elastic beanstalk environment name for &#x27; + args.env_type,\n            Type=&#x27;String&#x27;,\n            Overwrite=True\n        )\n{code}\n\nIn short, a command line tool to complement the API would be useful, much like the AWS CLI complements their APIs.",

I use variables to pass in details from BitBucket into the scripts that run, and use these variables across the steps. Ideally, I&#x27;d like my scripts to be able to use variables in their steps, but the values of those variables vary according to the \"deployment\".\n\nI can&#x27;t find a way of using Deployments and Deployment variables to use the same pipeline for the different environments. It doesn&#x27;t appear possible to have multiple steps in the same pipeline with the same deployment value (test/staging/production).\n\nDeployment variables only seem to be useful for different steps in the same pipeline (i.e. step 1 deploys to test, step 2 deploy to staging, step 3 to deploy to Prod), but it would be useful if a multiple steps could use the same deployment variables, or if a pipeline could run against a particular set of deployment variables (i.e. test/staging/prod)",

When clicking the link I see that the pipeline execution was successful and according to the web ui ran in 13m 44s and was started at 4:33 PM EST. The 3h 43m 7s time is correctly the duration between when the pipeline step was initiated and when I received the email.\n\nThis is the first time I&#x27;ve seen this and have no idea how to reproduce it.
