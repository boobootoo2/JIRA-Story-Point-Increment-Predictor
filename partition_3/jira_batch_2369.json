As the issue hasn't collect votes, watchers, comments, or support cases from many customers during its lifetime, it's very low on our priority list, and will not be fixed in the foreseeable future. That's why we've decided to resolve it as *Timed Out*.\r\n\r\nAlthough we're aware the issue is still important to those of you who were involved in the conversations around it, we want to be clear in managing your expectations. The Bitbucket Server team is focusing on issues that have broad impact and high value, reflected by the number of comments, votes, support cases, and customers interested. Please consult the [Atlassian Bugfix Policy|https://confluence.atlassian.com/support/atlassian-bug-fixing-policy-201294573.html] for more details.\r\n\r\nWe understand how disappointing this decision may be, but we hope you'll appreciate our transparent approach and communication. If you're really passionate about this suggestion, please comment with your case in detail and we'll reconsider. Atlassian will continue to watch this issue for further updates, so please feel free to share your thoughts in the comments.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nImran Khan\r\nProduct Manager - Bitbucket Server and Data Center\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\nI think I can speak for many of us when I say that it would be very beneficial to have a People directory / tab on the main taskbar of Stash, just like the one Confluence has (seen here - https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Searching+the+People+Directory)\r\n\r\nA feature like this would allow project & system administrators to get a much better overview of:\r\n\r\n1. who is doing what.\r\n2. allow fellow team members to find out who else is working on a project & the amount of commits / activity they have done on said projects.\r\n3. who has contributed to most in the last week / month.\r\n4. etc.",

From other customers with the same problem we believe the text is similar to the following \"<SomeLettersOrNumbers \" followed by a character that is invalid for an XML attribute. E.g. \"<a -\" or \"<abc !\" (note that the quotes I use are for punctuation in this paragraph - these quotes are not in the comment text in the database).\r\n\r\nFrom this error {{2014-02-25 15:07:42,652 WARN  [http-bio-8443-exec-1531] a_svn 907x552466x5 1ydvh8d 10.30.130.141 \"GET /projects/DSST/repos/ca/pull-requests/524/overview HTTP/1.1\" c.atlassian.stash.json.JsonRenderer Failed to marshal com.atlassian.stash.internal.pull.InternalPullRequest to JSON}}, this will find all the comments that are probably suspect:\r\n\r\n{code}\r\nselect c.id, c.comment_text from sta_comment c inner join sta_pr_comment_activity prca on c.id = prca.comment_id inner join sta_pr_activity a on a.activity_id = prca.activity_id inner join sta_pull_request pr on a.pr_id = pr.id inner join repository repo on pr.to_repository_id = repo.id inner join project proj on repo.project_id = proj.id\r\nwhere pr.scoped_id =  and repo.slug='plugins' and proj.key='DSST'\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nAnd the pull request description:\r\n\r\n{code}\r\nselect pr.description from sta_pull_request pr\r\ninner join repository repo on pr.to_repository_id = repo.id \r\ninner join project proj on repo.project_id = proj.id \r\nwhere pr.scoped_id = 524 and repo.slug='plugins' and proj.name='DSST'\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nYou just need to tweak the queries to use the different project name and PR scoped ids for each failing PR.

As the issue hasn't collect votes, watchers, comments, or support cases from many customers during its lifetime, it's very low on our priority list, and will not be fixed in the foreseeable future. That's why we've decided to resolve it as *Timed Out*.\r\n\r\nAlthough we're aware the issue is still important to those of you who were involved in the conversations around it, we want to be clear in managing your expectations. The Bitbucket Server team is focusing on issues that have broad impact and high value, reflected by the number of comments, votes, support cases, and customers interested. Please consult the [Atlassian Bugfix Policy|https://confluence.atlassian.com/support/atlassian-bug-fixing-policy-201294573.html] for more details.\r\n\r\nWe understand how disappointing this decision may be, but we hope you'll appreciate our transparent approach and communication. If you're really passionate about this suggestion, please comment with your case in detail and we'll reconsider. Atlassian will continue to watch this issue for further updates, so please feel free to share your thoughts in the comments.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nImran Khan\r\nProduct Manager - Bitbucket Server and Data Center\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\nThe 'source' branch in the 'create pull request' screen could default to the last branch that the current user pushed a commit to. This is often likely to be the right one.",

One finding was that the server could potentially be exploited because it permits HTTP PUT and DELETE.  As we found, Stash relies on these for a number of internal operations, e.g. editing pull requests, deleting SSH keys, and deleting repositories.\r\n\r\nFor us to proceed with Stash, we need a way to ensure that any PUT/DELETE operation is authenticated and logged, else it is rejected.  We are already using the LDAP integration.\r\n\r\nI will be out of the office next week, but we really need to resolve this issue during my absence.

      "description": "It would be very useful, to extend the markdown rendering with a regex search and replace.  So, as a Stash Administrator I could configure the markdown engine to search and replace certain text strings with external links or custom HTML.  Doing so would allow me to create links to external tools simply by finding certain text patterns in my Pull request descriptions, commit comments, etc.  \r\n\r\nUltimately, I'm more less concerned about the rendered markdown of file contents and more concerned about the rendering of meta-data (Pull request descriptions, comments , commits, etc).  However having it apply to both would be useful.\r\n\r\nPlease see \"Section commentlink\" - https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.8.1/config-gerrit.html for a sample implementation of this concept. The configuration of such looks like the following:\r\n\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\n[commentlink \"bugzilla\"]\r\n  match = \"(bug\\\\s+#?)(\\\\d+)\"\r\n  link = http://bugs.example.com/show_bug.cgi?id=$2\r\n\r\n[commentlink \"tracker\"]\r\n  match = ([Bb]ug:\\\\s+)(\\\\d+)\r\n  html = $1<a href=\\\"http://trak.example.com/$2\\\">$2</a>\r\n\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nbasically it would look for the text 'bug #1234' and convert that to a link like: 'http://bugs.example.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1234'\r\n\r\nThis is a feature common to most code browsing, and code review systems.  And if included in Stash, would help set it far above any other competing product.",

As the issue hasn't collect votes, watchers, comments, or support cases from many customers during its lifetime, it's very low on our priority list, and will not be fixed in the foreseeable future. That's why we've decided to resolve it as *Timed Out*.\r\n\r\nAlthough we're aware the issue is still important to those of you who were involved in the conversations around it, we want to be clear in managing your expectations. The Bitbucket Server team is focusing on issues that have broad impact and high value, reflected by the number of comments, votes, support cases, and customers interested. Please consult the [Atlassian Bugfix Policy|https://confluence.atlassian.com/support/atlassian-bug-fixing-policy-201294573.html] for more details.\r\n\r\nWe understand how disappointing this decision may be, but we hope you'll appreciate our transparent approach and communication. If you're really passionate about this suggestion, please comment with your case in detail and we'll reconsider. Atlassian will continue to watch this issue for further updates, so please feel free to share your thoughts in the comments.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nImran Khan\r\nProduct Manager - Bitbucket Server and Data Center\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\nWe're using Stash in an Enterprise environment where we have a number of different clients accessing for different projects.  At this point Stash doesn't provide a way for Admins to limit who can browse users.  Right now when you mention someone or try to add them to a pull request you see a full list of users and their email addresses.  This is a huge security risk and has effectively halted the our roll out of Stash until this issue can be resolved.\r\n\r\nThe ability to limit who can browse users exists in JIRA and has been invaluable for security.  We would like to see this same level of security applied to Stash.",

As the issue hasn't collect votes, watchers, comments, or support cases from many customers during its lifetime, it's very low on our priority list, and will not be fixed in the foreseeable future. That's why we've decided to resolve it as *Timed Out*.\r\n\r\nAlthough we're aware the issue is still important to those of you who were involved in the conversations around it, we want to be clear in managing your expectations. The Bitbucket Server team is focusing on issues that have broad impact and high value, reflected by the number of comments, votes, support cases, and customers interested. Please consult the [Atlassian Bugfix Policy|https://confluence.atlassian.com/support/atlassian-bug-fixing-policy-201294573.html] for more details.\r\n\r\nWe understand how disappointing this decision may be, but we hope you'll appreciate our transparent approach and communication. If you're really passionate about this suggestion, please comment with your case in detail and we'll reconsider. Atlassian will continue to watch this issue for further updates, so please feel free to share your thoughts in the comments.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nImran Khan\r\nProduct Manager - Bitbucket Server and Data Center\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\nYou shouldn't call the API \"REST\" as it doesn't meet any of Roy Fielding's (inventor of REST) key criteria of REST APIs:\r\n\r\nhttp://roy.gbiv.com/untangled/2008/rest-apis-must-be-hypertext-driven\r\n\r\ne.g. you're documenting URLs instead of using hypertext+custom media types.

We would still like to utilize an auto-merge/cascading merge feature.\r\n\r\n*Our practice*\r\nCode merged to Master is automatically deployed direct to production via a CI server. Master is protected so only authorized staff can trigger a production release. The CI server also does automated deployment, automated testing yada yada yada.\r\n\r\nCode merged to Develop is deployed direct to staging via a CI server.\r\n\r\nTo allow con-current development of very complex features (4 months of work), we utilize a 'feature branch'.\r\n\r\nFeature Branches are branched from 'master', and may also have a CI build against them.  A completed Feature Branch is then merged to develop, and ultimately master.\r\n\r\nThe problem with this approach is that to keep the feature branch up to date requires manual intervention, as such is sometimes forgotten by developers, resulting in an extended merging duration.\r\n\r\nWhat we want is the ability to configure an auto-merge from master to any un-merged feature branches.\r\n\r\n*How this could work with Sash*\r\nAdd an option the auto merge configuration screen to enable one or both of the following types of merge.\r\n\r\n1.) Release Branch Cascading Merge\r\nAs per https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/STASH/Automatic+branch+merging\r\n2.) Continuous Integration Cascading Merge\r\nThis merge will trigger on pull request to Master if in the [stash branching model screen|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/STASH/Using+branches+in+Stash#UsingbranchesinStash-model] the production, feature, and development branches are enabled. The changes in Master will be merged into any feature branch that is ahead of master.\r\nIn the event the merge is not possible (i.e. conflict), a pull request should be created to prompt a developer to manually make the merge.\r\n\r\n",
