      "description": "I&#x27;ve run into a couple of bizarre issues while reviewing Pull Requests through Chrome on my Mac. 2 functions do not work that I&#x27;ve found so far - deleting comments, and viewing file diffs side by side. For deleting comments, I get the delete window pop up, click \"Delete\" then nothing happens, the comment is still there. For the diff view, again the pop up appears, but remains blank, no diff view contents.\n\nI don&#x27;t know if the issues are related, but I do know that they both work in every other scenario I tried: Safari on Mac, Chrome on Windows, and even Chrome on Mac in Incognito mode!\n\nEspecially since it worked Incognito, I tried deleting all Chrome browser site data for bitbucket, restarted the browser, but still no luck. I&#x27;ve attached a screen shot of the console error that happens immediately upon hitting the \"Delete\" button in the delete dialog pop-up. I don&#x27;t get this error in the console when trying it through the other successful methods above. I suppose the other explanation could be some plug-in conflict, though I have no idea how to verify whether that&#x27;s the case.\n\nChrome on Mac is my primary browser, so I&#x27;d love to resolve these issues and not have to use an alternative way of browsing BitBucket pull requests.",

Our actual repository is a little bit special : there no master branch and each branch is independent (no merge).\n\nAnyway, before doing any operation, I made a \" git clone \" and plan to modify the repository. After this \" git clone \" command, the size of the repository on Bitbucket website is around 250 MB and not 900 MB like before.\n\nIt&#x27;s like only the main / principal branch is now tracked about the size and not all the branches of the repository. It&#x27;s very disadvantageous for us as we can&#x27;t see if there is any effect on our cleaning / moving phase and we are afraid that there is some others problems that we haven&#x27;t seen yet.\n\nCould you check if this size is reel or if anything change in the size tracking.\n\nThanks a lot in advance.",

Part of the build stage involves the generation and subsequent commit of two large files, the various versions of which were taking up repo space and pushing against the 2GB limit for Bitbucket repos.  This seemed like an ideal use case for the new git LFS feature, which I implemented this morning.\n\nThe build-stage push to Bitbucket seems to be working fine; I can see these files in the Git LFS section of my repo settings.  However, I encounter a problem in the deployment stage.  After checking out the appropriate tag, I attempt to use {{git lfs fetch}} and get the following output:\n\n{code}\nFetching HEAD\nGit LFS: (0 of 2 files) 0 B / 17.11 MB\nexit status 1\nWarning: errors occurred\n{code}\n\nWith no further information available and no helpful information resulting from my google searches, I have to assume that this is a bug in the beta LFS feature in Bitbucket.  I&#x27;m going to be rolling back my LFS implementation to unblock my build & deployment process, but I&#x27;d appreciate if somebody could investigate and explain in more detail what this error means and how to address it.\n\nThanks for any help you can provide.",
