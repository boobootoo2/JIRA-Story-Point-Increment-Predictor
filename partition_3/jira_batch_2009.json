Issue Summary\r\n\r\nWhen an app has a macro linking feature (Latex Math Reference) that references another of their own macro (e.g. Latex Math Block), the first live preview displays properly and triggers a call to:\r\n\r\n{code}\r\nhttps://<instance-name>.atlassian.net/cgraphql?q=MacroContentRenderer\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nHowever, when order is switch and the link macro ((Latex Math Reference)) is first created before the supposedly referenced block macro ((e.g. Latex Math Block)), it results in an error that the anchor target cannot be found *which is expected* because no references are created. Adding the referenced block macro later and trying to update the preview does not trigger a call to:\r\n\r\n{code}\r\nhttps://<instance-name>.atlassian.net/cgraphql?q=MacroContentRenderer\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nand the live preview stays the same with the error\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Install LaTeX Math\r\n# Edit an existing page, then in this order:\r\n## Create Math Block with anchor=test1\r\n## Wait to ensure draft has been saved (or publish/edit)\r\n## Create Math Block Reference with anchor=test1\r\n## Create Math Block Reference with anchor=test2\r\n## Create Math Block with anchor=test2\r\n\r\nMacro (3) will work fine, but (4) will continue to fail, even after giving plenty of time for the draft to update. It turns out that no new requests are being sent to the LaTeX Math server.\r\n\r\nReplication video:\r\n* New editor:  [^AnneReplicationNewConfluence-18Mar2019.webm] \r\n* Old editor: [^AnneReplicationOldConfluence-18Mar2019.webm] \r\n\r\nh3.

Notes\r\n* From vendor:\r\n{quote}\r\nactual request (headers + body) and response you're trying to invoke and receive on your end?\r\nThe issue is that I'm not receiving a new request from Confluence. The response headers when rendering the macro the first time include \"max-age=30;s-maxage=30\". This works as expected when viewing the page and in the old editor.\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nh3.

Issue Summary\r\n\r\nCurrently, Confluence doesn't have the capability to use a paragraph indentation by using the *TAB* keyboard key and even copying and pasting this formatting from an external source (like an e-mail or Word/PDF file text), it doesn't keep the original format.\r\nh3. Environment\r\n\r\n\r\n* Confluence Cloud\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nBy copying from an external source (you can use the attached file as an example -\u00a0[^Paragraph indentation.docx]):\r\n # Copy the paragraph from the file;\r\n # Paste it in a Confluence page (an existing one or not, in the tiny or fabric version).\r\n\r\nBy trying to insert it manually:\r\n # Write a 3 lines paragraph;\r\n # Press the *TAB* keyboard key, in the first paragraph line.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nThe copying example:\r\n * The paragraph should come with the same indentation than the source\r\n\r\nThe manual example:\r\n * Hitting *TAB* should get only the first line indented.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nThe copying example:\r\n * The paragraph comes with a Confluence default indentation.\r\n\r\nThe manual example:\r\n * Hitting *TAB* gets all the paragraph indented.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nWe do not have a workaround. I've tried to hit the\u00a0*SPACE*\u00a0keyboard key instead of *TAB* at the first paragraph line, and it sent me to a new line.",

Summary\r\nWhen using the Confluence search, if trying to search for characters matching exactly a page title, the same will not be displayed as a first result, besides when it has been updated. \r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# In Confluence, make sure to have a page with a specific title (In this example, let's use \"*Starry eyed*\" as a title)\r\n# Make sure that the same page title is displayed on different pages, so we can have additional results.\r\n# Save the pages and make sure to search for the page title in Confluence's advanced search.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nThe page with the title matching with the search should be displayed in the first position.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nPages with the page's title as text in the body will be displayed first.\r\n \r\nh3. Notes\r\n\r\n* A new example found from the second test is that this will affect on the results of the *Livesearch* macro, as the same has a limited number of results to be displayed:\r\n\r\n!livesearch.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nSome examples of the experience are in the screenshots below. Also, trying with different search filters presenting different results:\r\n\r\n*Bug's behavior. Notice that the page with the title matching the search is displayed in the bottom, instead of the top:*\r\n\r\n!starry1.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\n*If searching for words in the title. Not the full page title text:*\r\n\r\n!starry2.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\n*If searching for the exact page title between quotes. The page is displayed as a first result:*\r\n\r\n!starry3.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nSearch for the title between using quotes.",

We know the DIV macro functionality has been critical to everyone here in formatting and configuring pages. As my colleague mentioned above, we have announced the deprecation of this macro March of last year. For transparency, after recent further discussions internally, we are currently still set in our decision to not include the DIV macro in the new editor when balancing performance of the editor vs the percentage of DIV macro users.\r\n\r\nThank you for your continued feedback. We have updated the status to reflect our current decision on the DIV macro, and we will provide any updates if we are able to include the DIV macro or additional similar functionality into our roadmap.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\n\r\nSunny\r\nConfluence\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\nThe Div macros will be removed as announced in:\u00a0[We're cleaning up the macro browser|https://confluence.atlassian.com/confcloud/we-re-cleaning-up-the-macro-browser-946028471.html]\r\n\r\nDiv macros contains some helpful features for content customisation and even workarounds:\r\neg. Removing links/disable links on pages as a workaround for this missing feature: [CONFCLOUD\\-36736: Selectively Disable Attachment Preview|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFCLOUD-36736]\r\n\r\nThere's currently no alternative method at the moment for either features.
