The old revision is still accessible, which can be very problematic if the revision reverted from contains highly offensive information or dangerous code (eg: an abused macro, or insulting wording, or pornographic imagry).\n\nA way to remove revisions permenantly, or at least restrict revisions the same way that spaces are restricted would be benificial.\n\nThe idea of revision security, gives me the idea of CONF-1572",

I have suggested before (CONF-938) that a page / blog be restrictable in a similar way, but the idea can go a level further.\n\nShould a well established page (eg: change log, or press release page) be revised and a new revision created - it would be extraordinarily useful to be able to restrict the visibility of that page to \"editors\" (or another specified group) so that it can be vetted.\n\nThe editor would then be able to review it and set it to be publicly visible (after any alternations he deemed to be nessesary).",

As such, today we are closing this request. \n\nRegards,\nJohn Masson\nConfluence Product Manager\n{panel}\n\nA spell checker would be really nice.",

JSPWiki has a nice implementation of this - when you open a page for edits you get a huge warning if someone opened the page during last half an hour and hasn't either cancelled or saved. The warning includes the name of the user who has opened the page. Saving (by anyone) removes the lock.\n\nI assumed this was a standard feature and didn't even check if it's there or not but testing for it's existence revealed there's no warnings. :)",

In the interest of transparency, we are closing this issue as it's not on the near term roadmap to implement. While there are many great feature ideas here, we cannot build them all into Confluence core. There are, however, options within the [Atlassian Marketplace|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/search?application=confluence&category=&cost=&hosting=&marketingLabel=&q=translate] which provide this functionality. Thanks for all your feedback on jira.atlassian.com. Please keep your ideas coming.\n\nRegards,\nBill Arconati\nConfluence Group Product Manager\n{panel}\n",

We have a good sized set of HTML pages that we were using like a Wiki and I'd like to pull the information contained in them into Confluence.\n\nAlso, my team member's major complaint about Confluence is the markup; they'd rather use HTML (they may get used to the markup after using it more).  It would be a great benefit to allow them to write an HTML page on their local system and then import that into Confluence.  This doesn't need to be dynamic, just a simple one-time import after which the data is stored in Confluence's native markup format.\n\nThis may be really hard or may already be possible, but it would be a major selling point for my team.",

Even for a fairly simple Confluence setup with multiple user groups and multiple spaces, administering the permissions is already getting quite cumbersome and it's quite hard to get a picture of what spaces a single group or user can actually view/edit/etc.\n\nPlease add a new tool into the Administrator section which lists all the spaces in the system and lets the admin edit the spaces permissions without having to go through to the summary of the space.

Based on customer conversations and comments on this ticket, the most prevalent need in this area is the to manually remove specific versions of a page for the purposes of removing confidential information (e.g. passwords). Therefore, in the next version (Confluence 5.0) we plan to provide the ability for space administrators to manually remove specific versions of a page. We will mark this feature as closed once we ship 5.0.\n\nThere have been a number of comments requesting additional functionality beyond this for the purposes of minimizing database storage requirements or for adhering to content retention requirements. We have opened another JIRA issue for this use case which can be found at CONF-27701.\n\nThanks again for your comments and contributions.\n{panel}\n\nThere are several reasons why it would be useful to be able to remove historical versions of selected pages:\n\n- to remove confidential information which was accidentally added while editing the page\n- to reduce the database usage of Confluence, particularly on frequently- or automatically-updated pages\n- to comply with legislative document destruction requirements (e.g. delete content older than some years).\n\nPractically speaking, this might be implemented in a number of different ways:\n\n- ability to remove old versions of pages older than specific date (e.g. get rid of anything older than 6 months)\n- ability to limit the number of old versions kept (e.g. limit to 5 previous versions)\n- ability to remove specific old versions from one or more pages.\n\nThese tasks could be done manually via space admin, triggered by an automatic housekeeping task, or done manually for specific pages.",

It would be better if there was also a place to put space specific and global files. \n\nFor example: We have images which are used iconically all over the place in a space, and some which are used over the whole confluence site. For now we have to store the icons separately and link out to them explicitly. It would be nicer to store them in a global / space repository where they can be references something like this:\n\n!image.gif! - image on this page\n!anotherPage|image.gif! - image on anotherPage in this space\n!SPACE:anotherPage|image.gif! - image on anotherPage in the space SPACE\n!|image.gif! - image in the space repository for this space\n!SPACE:|image.gif! - image in the space repository for the space SPACE\n!$GLOBAL$|image.gif! - image in the global repository\n\nThe same could be done for all files (swf's, exe's, zip's etc). We would need some way of linking directly to a file and not just a link to the anchor of file listings. See issue CONF-989",

I'm a fish!\" due to restricted characters in Page Title.\n\nI understand that some extended characters (^, !, | etc) are used for other purposes but I can see there being two ways out of this:\n\n1. Escaping - \"Help\\! I\\'m a fish\\!\"\n2. Implementation of Alternative Titles, so I could set the page title to \"aquamarine.fish.helpme\" and the alternative title set to something else. You would continue to link to \"aquamarine.fish.helpme\" but on the page itself (in the breadcrumb trail, in the page display, in the hierarchical view, in the children list etc) it would show the alternative title. [aquamarine.fish.helpme] would show \"Help! I'm a fish!\" as the link, perhaps this could be an option which could be configured in the administration area ... \"Use displayed title where entered?\" or something like that.\n\nI think there is an issue around for #2. This could be entirely optional (it would default to showing the page title as the alternative / display title) and the page title could continue to be used with the current characters allowed. This would also make it compatable with previous system data. The tables could be extended to fit on upgrade.\n\nThe related issue is CONF-885\n\nNote - this may be a duplicate, but I searched around and couldnt find any issues ... Maybe Im looking in the wrong place.",

Thus it would be _very_ handy to export Docbook files directly from Confluence.\n---\n*Atlassian Update: November 10, 2011* \n\nHi All,\nThanks for your patience on this issue. After some thought we have come to the conclusion that this is not something we would consider to be core and strategic to Confluence. This is a feature request which we are open to partners and plugin developers tackling as we don't have any intention on doing this.\n\nOne of our partners, [k15t|http://k15t.com] have just released their [Scroll Wiki DocBook Exporter|https://plugins.atlassian.com/plugin/details/725767] for Confluence which satisfies this issue.\n\nCheers,\nSherif Mansour\nProduct Manager",

Two drawbacks to this are 1) there's no clear mechanism for a user to request membership to a group and 2) it's rather tedious.\n\nI propose a mechanism whereby a user can request access to a group.  This doesn't require revealing the list of groups.  An admin could set which groups are self-selectable (perhaps a flag on the group).  When a user requests to be in the group, the admin receives an e-mail with Approve and Deny links.\n\nGoing further, there could be another flag to make the group free to join.  This might be useful later for team management in unauthoritarian open-source projects.",

We have a space (A) for which we'd like to allow modifications by confluence-user.  We'd like that space to be inviting.  Now we want to add a space (B) for an undergraduate course but we don't want to invite undergrads to sign up for an account and mess around with (A).  We give restrict (A) more but we'd rather not. \n\nWhat would solve this dilemma for us is if each new account was inactive until the admin activated it.  One way to do this would be that when a user signs up, the admin receives an e-mail with two links for Approve and Deny.\n\nIf you don't like this proposal, see the other one that's related.\n",
