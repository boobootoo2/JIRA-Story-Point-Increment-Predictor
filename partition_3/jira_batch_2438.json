Other strange points when this happens: When notifications use the wrong user they always use the same wrong user (one of our team members, say A) So far I&#x27;ve only seen the commits from 2 team members (say B and C) affected with this (they both look like they&#x27;re from the member A), it does not trigger for other people\n\n\nbq.
