We work with larger projects (following the mono-repository) approach, where it approach may not scale too well. A Gradle cache grows rather quickly and it takes substantial resources already to just pack/unpack the Gradle cache. Moreover, different steps in the pipeline may only need small parts of it.\n\nIt would be desirable to have support for https://proandroiddev.com/speed-up-your-build-with-gradle-remote-build-cache-2ee9bfa4e18. As it allows to incrementelly check whether a given task has already been performed.\n\nA simple HTTP repository would already  suffice for it. In other project we made use of Artifactory generic repositories for this purpose. Alternatively it would be interesting to have support for repositories in general, meaning generic HTTP, Docker and Maven similar to others like GitLab and Azure DevOps where it is a built-in feature as well.",
