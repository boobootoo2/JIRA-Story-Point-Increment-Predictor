This is problematic because it is difficult to track down where these snapshots came from w/o having correct names.\r\n\r\nIdeally, the AWS CLI command wouldn't timeout under such a scenario but since that is a different issue, it would be nice of the Atlassian backup script was a little better in that if the wait operation timed out, it would still attempt to apply the tags to the in-progress snapshot.{quote}\r\n\r\nWhile the latter paragraph is technically a suggestion (as opposed to a bug), I would still consider the behaviour that caused this report an actual bug that we should fix or provide a proper workaround for.",

However, when {{RequiredBuildsMergeCheck}} calls {{DefaultBuildStatusService.getSummary}}, the {{validateUser}} check verifies {{LICENSED_USER}} _on top of_ the permission checks performed by {{canMerge}}.\r\n\r\nThat means, for example, calling {{PullRequestService.canMerge}} as a service user (used by \"bots\", but also used by SSH access keys), the {{LICENSED_USER}} check fails. This leads to add-on developers (often incorrectly) [escalating permissions|https://github.com/tomasbjerre/pull-request-notifier-for-bitbucket/commit/1cc9dc3aaa6da105da97a07ca5ae57c4ab5362ff] to ensure the check won't fail.\r\n\r\nWhen build stats are retrieved in order to enforce the required builds check, it should not require {{LICENSED_USER}} permission; it should only require that the calling user has access to the pull request.",

You can now encrypt the database password that is stored in _bitbucket.properties_ file with one of the encryption methods provided.\r\n\r\nYou can find more information in the Bitbucket Server and Data Center 7.8\u00a0[release notes|https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/bitbucket-server-and-data-center-7-8-release-notes-1027130356.html] and [Encrypting database passwords docs|https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/encrypt-database-password-1032257985.html].\r\n\r\nAnton Genkin\r\n Product Manager Bitbucket Data Center\r\n{panel}\r\n*Original message*\r\n\r\nBitbucket should encrypt the database password since it's in plain text in the bitbucket.properties file or it could use the integrated authentication with the databases such as MSSQL database.\r\n\r\nThis is really the same underlying issue as JIRASERVER-31004, but applies to Bitbucket (as it should to all database passwords stored at rest for other Atlassian applications). \u00a0\r\n\r\nCurrent state:\r\n\r\njdbc.password=plaintext\r\n\r\nDesired state:\r\n\r\njdbc.password=WG%^'mP/@6*S\\'6GX2m}B:4+b~\\qh/VJ?a=S'fJke[t/XhMCp&",

If you choose not to import it, you can still do it later. Then you could just upload the html/etc. files for your Javadoc, and, voila, you have a Javadoc on the side that people can view.\u00a0If you need more information, feel free to contact me.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nEDIT: I was originally thrown off by this saying server, but I was unable to find the one for cloud so I just went here.

Problem Definition\r\nEnd users (usually non Administrators) raise support request because they cannot log in to Bitbucket Server.\r\nLocal Administrators expect the users to get in touch with them to resolve log in issues.\r\n\r\nSince Atlassian does not manage these instances, these requests should be directed to the company's support instead.\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\nProvide a solution to easily change the \"Contact support\" link to direct the requests to the internal support.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\nIt's possible to manually change the global footer template to hide the support links from the footer. Do note changing templates is not supported however, and the templates reside in the installation folder, and if you upgrade you will need to perform the same change again on the subsequent installation directory\r\n\r\nTo hide the links, the steps are as follows:\r\n\r\n# Open *$BITBUCKET_INST/app/static/bitbucket/internal/webpanels/global-footer.soy* in a text editor\r\n# Locate the following section:\r\n#  {code}\r\n<ul>\r\n        <li>{productFullName()} <span title=\"{$hash}\" id=\"product-version\" data-commitid=\"{$hash}\" data-system-build-number=\"{$systemBuildNumber}\"> v{$buildVersion}</span></li>\r\n        <li data-key=\"footer.links.documentation\"><a href=\"{bitbucket_help_url('bitbucket.help.default')}\" target=\"_blank\">{getText('bitbucket.web.global.footer.links.documentation')}</a></li>\r\n        <li data-key=\"footer.links.contact.support\"><a href=\"https://support.atlassian.com/contact\" target=\"_blank\">{getText('bitbucket.web.global.footer.links.contact.support')}</a></li>\r\n        <li data-key=\"footer.links.jac\"><a href=\"https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/BSERV\" target=\"_blank\">{getText('bitbucket.web.global.footer.links.jac')}</a></li>\r\n        <li data-key=\"footer.links.about\"><a href=\"{nav_about()}\">{getText('bitbucket.web.global.footer.links.about')}</a></li>\r\n        <li data-key=\"footer.links.contact.atlassian\"><a href=\"http://www.atlassian.com/company/contact/\" target=\"_blank\">{getText('bitbucket.web.global.footer.links.contact.atlassian')}</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n{code}\r\n# Comment out this section like so: {code}\r\n/*\r\n<li data-key=\"footer.links.documentation\"><a href=\"{bitbucket_help_url('bitbucket.help.default')}\" target=\"_blank\">{getText('bitbucket.web.global.footer.links.documentation')}</a></li>\r\n        <li data-key=\"footer.links.contact.support\"><a href=\"https://support.atlassian.com/contact\" target=\"_blank\">{getText('bitbucket.web.global.footer.links.contact.support')}</a></li>\r\n        <li data-key=\"footer.links.jac\"><a href=\"https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/BSERV\" target=\"_blank\">{getText('bitbucket.web.global.footer.links.jac')}</a></li>\r\n        <li data-key=\"footer.links.about\"><a href=\"{nav_about()}\">{getText('bitbucket.web.global.footer.links.about')}</a></li>\r\n        <li data-key=\"footer.links.contact.atlassian\"><a href=\"http://www.atlassian.com/company/contact/\" target=\"_blank\">{getText('bitbucket.web.global.footer.links.contact.atlassian')}</a></li>\r\n*/\r\n{code}\r\n# Restart Bitbucket Server\r\n\r\nOnce you've restarted the links should not appear anymore.\r\n",

Environment\r\nTested in 5.1.0 and  5.1.3\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n- Get the process ID for Bitbucket Server\r\n- tail the atlssian-bitbucket.log file\r\n- while tailing the log file, open a new terminal window and run kill -3 <PID>\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n- Thread dump should be printed to the atlassian-bitbucket.log file\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n- Nothing is printed in this regard\r\n \r\nh3. Notes\r\n- When Bitbucket Server is started from the command line (via start script or during launch immediately after installation) thread dump is sent to/can be seen on the console\r\n\r\nh3.Workaround\r\nFrom resource:\r\n{quote}\r\nIf you have trouble generating the thread dumps with this method, then use the method \"Generating a Thread dump for Windows\" as they can also apply for linux, etc.\r\n{quote}",
