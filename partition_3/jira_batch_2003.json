It would be great to bring this to our product again :)\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\nAs this is not a native feature in the new editor for now, we can keep using our undefined links by opening them on a new tab (right-clicking over the link and selecting this option, or CTRL + Right Click / COMMAND + Right Click).\r\n\r\nTo insert an undefined link on a page with the new editor, create a link with this address:\r\n* {{https://SITE_NAME.atlassian.net/wiki/pages/createpage.action?spaceKey=SPACEKEY}}",

Issue Summary\r\n\r\nWhen integrating Jira and Confluence, if a Jira issue macro is mentioned on the page, the same will have the Confluence page displayed in the \"*mentioned in*\" section. However, when importing issues from CSV that had the same key from an existing project in the current Jira, and also, importing the related space with the existing issue, the *mentioned in* section will not display the Confluence page.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nHave two Confluence and Jira instances to perform the migration.\r\n\r\nh5.Jira and Confluence A\r\n\r\n# Make sure to create one or more issues in the instance A\r\n# Now, in Confluence, make sure to create a space with a page that will be including the Jira issues, so it will populate the \"mentioned in\" section with the Confluence page.\r\n# In Confluence, make sure to go to *Space Settings > Content Tools > Export > XML* so the space with the Jira issue will be exported.\r\n# In Jira, use the search from Jira in order to populate the result with the created issues and export the same to CSV (used the *Current fields* option on the tests) and download the CSV.\r\n\r\nh5.Jira and Confluence B\r\n\r\n# Now, in this Jira, make sure to create a new project using the same key and name from the Jira instance A\r\n# Use the *External System import* tool in order to import the CSV from Jira A into the newly created project with the same key\r\n# In Confluence B, make sure to use the *import spaces* option from the administration in order to import the recently exported space from Confluence A.\r\n# Make sure to reload the page, or, re-insert the Jira issue.\r\n\r\nh3.

Notes\r\n\r\n* The Jira links count is not displayed in the Confluence page(s)\r\n* The Jira macro repair will not help on the issue to be fixed.\r\n* Re-inserting the Jira macro will not work.\r\n\r\nThe results will also depend on small details like if the issue/page were created after the migration. For example, the following has been observed:\r\n\r\n||Jira issue created|Confluence page created|Results||\r\n|After migration|After migration|(/)|\r\n|After migration|before migration|(/)|\r\n|Before migration|After migration|(/)|\r\n|before migration|before migration|(x)|\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nEdit the page in order to remove the Jira macro and publish it. After that, make sure to edit the page again so the macro can be re-inserted, and then, publish it. Using a different key in the newly created project in instance B will also help on not triggering the bug.",

Expected Results\r\nImages and other attachments are rendered properly.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results \r\nImages are blank/broken.\r\n\r\nh3. Notes \r\n* The attachments are successfully copied with the pages in the tree, but do not render when the page is viewed.\r\n* Editing the page and trying to publish it again causes a generic error flag to be displayed.  Inspecting the error detail in the dev console shows a 400 error when PUTting the ADF data for the page.\r\n* If you view the storage format xml (sfxml) for the copied page, you will notice the following structure for the image:\r\n\r\n{code:xml}\r\n<ac:image ac:align=\"center\" ac:layout=\"center\" ac:original-height=\"667\" ac:original-width=\"500\">\r\n  <ri:attachment ri:filename=\"keep-crom.jpg\" ri:version-at-save=\"1\">\r\n    <ri:page ri:space-key=\"CPTITO\" ri:content-title=\"[COPY] Attachments\" ri:version-at-save=\"2\" />\r\n  </ri:attachment>\r\n</ac:image>\r\n{code}\r\nThis structure works perfectly using the old editor, but appears to be incompatible with fabric-editor pages.  Note that the <ri:page> element's space-key and title values are trivial, as they are rewritten to refer to the same space and page.  Also note that attempting to publish this sfxml structure to a fabric-editor page using a PUT on the /content REST API results in a 400 error whose description is simply an UnsupportedOperationException.  Judging by the fact that the fabric editor inexplicably no longer supports inserting attachments from other spaces and pages, I am not entirely surprised by this, and believe it is likely an incompatibility between sfxml's superior feature set over what the new ADF format supports.\r\n\r\nNormally, old-editor pages displaying images from the same space and page omit that ri:page element, simply looking like this:\r\n\r\n{code:xml}\r\n<ac:image ac:align=\"center\" ac:layout=\"center\" ac:original-height=\"667\" ac:original-width=\"500\">\r\n  <ri:attachment ri:filename=\"keep-crom.jpg\" ri:version-at-save=\"1\" />\r\n</ac:image>\r\n{code}\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround \r\nNone so far.",
