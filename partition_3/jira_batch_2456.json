That would have the nice side effect of checking the target exists.\n\nI can already implicitly identify one side of that process by choosing where to trigger the build; but obviously not both. There are some ways to do build gymnastics and get around it, but it would be a heck of a lot easier to just be able to spec \"this build needs that tag from that repo\" when you run the custom build.",

See screenshot examples.\n\nThis does not seem like the proper information to display there. Instead the date displayed should be the last date the current file was actually modified. My reasoning for suggests this is as follows:\n\n# The timestamp shown when viewing the source of the file is the last time the referred file was pushed.\n\nThat means every file in the repository shows the same timestamp when using the source file viewer in bitbucket. In any regularly maintained repository, a single file changing and being committed and subsequently pushed would mean all files now show _some_other file&#x27;s last change / commit date. Not the current file. That&#x27;s seems confusing.\n\n# The user interface is confusing. The source viewer displays the date in the context of the current file. But in reality that date has nothing to do with the current file, instead its related to ANY other file that was committed and then pushed to the branch.\n# There isn&#x27;t a way to even find the last modified date of the current file in the source viewer unless you click the commit selector dropdown - which DOES show the current file change commit history.\n\n3b) Think about that for one moment - The element which you click to get access to the current file&#x27;s commit history has the information that shows the most recent commit for the whole branch. Those two pieces of information are highly inconsistent with each other.\n\nTo resolve this issue the current modified date for the file should be displayed in the file browser. The current commit date of the branch should be shown somewhere else in the interface if that information is deemed still important.",

      "description": "Hi - we are 10-15 developers all working on the same repos with lots of pull requests to master.\n\nOur current setup is Bitbucket with Jenkins to run our pipeline to guarantee that everything builds and unit tests are passing before any pull request to master can be approved. We also only allow fast-forward merges.\n\nSo this means that everytime someone merges to the master every other pull request is invalid and have to rebase/merge from master before they can try again.Since the pipeline takes anything from 15 minutes to 35 minutes before a pull request can be approved it means that sometimes the same pull request has to go through a lot of iterations before it can finally be merged. The classic \"rush to master\" issue...\n\nIt would be nice if there was a way to reserve a timeslot where only YOU can merge,  so that you can be guaranteed to get your changes in, without going around the office to make sure no one else merges ahead of you.\n\nOr do you have another solution or idea for this problem?",

The main issue we currently have with pipeline is that sometimes the agents that take the job are too slow!\n\nFor example, sometimes, a simple docker image building task would take 30 minutes!! However, if I stop it and re-run it again, it could be completed in less than 5 minutes.\n\nI have read the pipeline limitation document but it does not mention anything about the CPU limitation. I think it would be a good idea to explain these kind of limitations in the [https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/limitations-of-bitbucket-pipelines-827106051.html](limitation document) as well.\n\nWe need to have an environment to be consistent from run to run.

Observation\nBamboo add a new commit to feature branch in Bitbucket Cloud. However this commit is never built as it was built before the push by Bamboo. Bamboo also ignores this commit when polling for changes.\n\nThis will cause merge checks with success builds to fail as the latest commit does not have a build. The only workaround would be to run the branch plan again manually so that the latest commit gets built.",
