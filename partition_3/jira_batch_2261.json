Atlassian Connect 1.0 [was released in March 2014|http://blogs.atlassian.com/2014/03/introducing-atlassian-connect-1-0/], and you can already get access to [more than 50 public add-ons today built using the platform|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/search?application=&category=&cost=&hosting=cloud&marketingLabel=].\r\n \r\nDue to stability and scalability reasons, we will not bundle additional third party add-ons with our Cloud offerings. But you should feel free to contact the vendors of your favourite add-ons to let them know that you would like them to create a Cloud version of the add-on! We will do our best to work together with the vendor to satisfy this request.\r\n \r\nSince we have no plans to bundle additional add-ons in Cloud, we are closing this issue.\r\n \r\nCheers,\r\nBartek\r\nJIRA Product Management\r\nbartek (at) atlassian (dot) com\r\n{panel}\r\n \r\n \r\n*Original request description:*\r\nPlease bundle the Social Bookmarks plugin for OnDemand customers: https://plugins.atlassian.com/plugin/details/192",

Atlassian Connect 1.0 [was released in March 2014|http://blogs.atlassian.com/2014/03/introducing-atlassian-connect-1-0/], and you can already get access to [more than 50 public add-ons today built using the platform|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/search?application=&category=&cost=&hosting=cloud&marketingLabel=].\r\n \r\nDue to stability and scalability reasons, we will not bundle additional third party add-ons with our Cloud offerings. But you should feel free to contact the vendors of your favourite add-ons to let them know that you would like them to create a Cloud version of the add-on! We will do our best to work together with the vendor to satisfy this request.\r\n \r\nSince we have no plans to bundle additional add-ons in Cloud, we are closing this issue.\r\n \r\nCheers,\r\nBartek\r\nJIRA Product Management\r\nbartek (at) atlassian (dot) com\r\n{panel}\r\n \r\n",

Atlassian Connect 1.0 [was released in March 2014|http://blogs.atlassian.com/2014/03/introducing-atlassian-connect-1-0/], and you can already get access to [more than 50 public add-ons today built using the platform|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/search?application=&category=&cost=&hosting=cloud&marketingLabel=].\r\n \r\nDue to stability and scalability reasons, we will not bundle additional third party add-ons with our Cloud offerings. But you should feel free to contact the vendors of your favourite add-ons to let them know that you would like them to create a Cloud version of the add-on! We will do our best to work together with the vendor to satisfy this request.\r\n \r\nSince we have no plans to bundle additional add-ons in Cloud, we are closing this issue.\r\n \r\nCheers,\r\nBartek\r\nJIRA Product Management\r\nbartek (at) atlassian (dot) com\r\n{panel}\r\n \r\n \r\n*Original request description:*\r\nGo2Group is interested in having their synapseRT plugin approved for OnDemand.\r\n\r\nPlugin is available on PAC here: https://plugins.atlassian.com/plugin/details/15711.",

      "description": "The user _bamboo-svn-user is missing on studio-nightly. --It's possible that a development build, at some stage, caused the user to be removed or failed to add it after a clean install.-- The underlying problem is that the {{bamboo-svn-password}} attribute is missing from {{init.xml}} on this instance. Confirmed with Ernest that the attribute was added relatively recently (1 month ago). So instances created over 1 month ago (and therefore do not have the attribute) and clean installed with more recent versions of Studio (which expect the attribute) will not have _bamboo-svn-user.\n\nNonetheless: the user is currently created in Crowd upgrade {{UpgradeTo_v3}} task, which will only run once after a clean install or an upgrade from an old version. If this fails, nothing will create the user further down the line. Since we always want this user to be present, it would make sense to create it in a {{LifecycleAware.onStart()}} task, so that it always gets created on startup if it is missing.\n\nOne complexity with this is that the bamboo-svn-password must be retrieved from initial data. Strictly speaking, it is only safe to retrieve initial data when a clean instance is coming up and is configuring itself for the first time.",

Atlassian Connect 1.0 [was released in March 2014|http://blogs.atlassian.com/2014/03/introducing-atlassian-connect-1-0/], and you can already get access to [more than 50 public add-ons today built using the platform|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/search?application=&category=&cost=&hosting=cloud&marketingLabel=].\r\n \r\nDue to stability and scalability reasons, we will not bundle additional third party add-ons with our Cloud offerings. But you should feel free to contact the vendors of your favourite add-ons to let them know that you would like them to create a Cloud version of the add-on! We will do our best to work together with the vendor to satisfy this request.\r\n \r\nSince we have no plans to bundle additional add-ons in Cloud, we are closing this issue.\r\n \r\nCheers,\r\nBartek\r\nJIRA Product Management\r\nbartek (at) atlassian (dot) com\r\n{panel}\r\n \r\n \r\n*Original request description:*\r\nPlease bundle the JIRA Misc Custom Fields plugin with Jira studio.\r\nhttps://plugins.atlassian.com/plugin/details/27136",
