Imagine, if I later find an error or missing point in my uploaded image and want to replace that image with a new one, then, how can I easily tell from the attachment list which image is to be updated(assume there are 10 images in a article).\n\nFurther more, naming images with meaningful name helps us find concerning images by full text search, right?\n\nSo, I suggest giving a chance to user to type in a file name after Ctrl+V, then click OK to confirm that file name. This file name can be pre-populated with your auto generated time-based name, so for those who don't care, they just click OK or press Enter to accept the default. Better, if the typed in name already exists, give a message box asking whether user wants to override the old image.\n\nI believe most Confluence content contributors should be aware that there is a file name(instead of a mysterious black hole) under the hood supporting an \"inline\" image, therefore, don't be afraid to clarify the fact that user must assign a file name every time they Ctrl+V an new image.",

Also the test-resources aren't always equal to the product version so it can be a pain to figure out which one you need.. I'm using the 3.5 now, the latest stable release for Confluence.\n\nI already talked to Developer Relations who asked me to create this issue.",

It looks beautiful. For example, the HTML macro.\n* Some time later, the administrator disables the macro. The page looks a mess.\n\nScenario 2:\n* My Confluence site uses a given plugin, which supplies *myMacro*.\n* The site's license for that plugin expires. It takes a day or two before the administrator gets a new license.\n* All pages that use *myMacro* look bad, and are even unreadable, until the new license is installed.\n\nScenario 3:\n* I write some content on my Confluence site. I use *myMacro*, which is installed on my site.\n* A customer copies my content and installs it on their own Confluence site. That site does not have the necessary plugin installed.\n\nAs the page author, I would like to control the way Confluence behaves when a macro is used on the page. If it suits my purpose, I would like to say that the macro should fail gracefully.\n\nNote that this functionality cannot go into the macro itself, because Confluence will not process that macro.\n\n*One possible solution:*\n\n(This is just one way of solving the problem. There are probably others.)\n\nConfluence could supply a macro *Graceful Macro Fail* (bundled with the product) that the author could add to a page, stating that a specific macro should fail gracefully. For example, from the above scenarios I would want *myMacro* to fail gracefully.\n\nThe *Graceful Macro Fail* macro could offer the following parameters:\n* Show or hide macro body, if macro does not exist.\n* Other text to display, instead of the macro body, if macro does not exist.\n* A title to display if macro does not exist.\n\nNote that there may be more than one macro on a page that needs to fail gracefully. There may even be more than one occurrence of the same macro, *myMacro*. For that reason, I need to wrap *myMacro* inside *Graceful Macro Fail*.\n\n*Specific use case:*\n\nWe are thinking of adding some sort of conditional processing to our Confluence pages. This may involve a custom macro. We also need to allow other people to copy our content to their own site. The customers' sites will probably not have the custom macro installed.",

If I recall right, our attachment file size in OnDemand is set to 100mb (CONFDEV-3606), but I've got no idea if it is enforced if using this API and if so it's probably after the deserialisation. The limit wouldn't have mattered anyway in the above mentioned case.\n\nPlease investigate if a limit of 100mb is still feasible (imo it's way too high, I would even suggest reducing it to ~10-15mb) as the production max heap size is 512mb. Please also ensure that the limit is enforced when using the above mentioned API *before* it's getting deserialised since it'll cause a memory footprint of at least double the size.\n\nMaybe we should enforce the setting of the Content-length header via a filter for these requests, and enforce the limit via that (even if it's not accurate). We could also experiment with just setting the [maxPostSize|http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-6.0-doc/config/ajp.html] on the container.",

The link will appear on the page, but not clickable. The anchor tag is empty and the URL is not saved into the BODYCONTENT table.\n\nSimilar behavior occurs when inserting an image from the web with an URL containing an invalid character. While the image renders in edit mode, upon saving the page there will be a red \"Broken Image\" placeholder.\n\nh4. Steps to reproduce:\n\n* Click Link > Web Link tab\n* Insert an URL with an invalid character. For example: http://www.google.com/* (this is a bogus URL)\n* Click Insert\n* Save page\n\nh4. Workaround:\n\nUse an encoded entity in the format \"%<hexit><hexit>\" ([reference|http://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_urlencode.asp]) in place of the invalid character when injecting the URL.\n\nOR a simpler way would be:\n\n# Go to Google Shortner at https://goo.gl/\n# Paste the URL\n# Google will generate a *short url* for your URL which you will be able to link.\n# Google will also be change your *long URL* to alphanumeric characters, which can also be saved.",

However this is not the case with applied formattings in Confluence.\n\nSpecifically, when inserting a new line (row) into a table whose columns have certain alignment and format, the new line will always have the default formatting and alignment, which means that every time a new line is inserted alignment and formatting have to be manually restored.\nSee screenshot of a typical result.\n\nI am aware that in a wiki having formatting without content might be somewhat problematic (in contrast to an office suite).\n\nStill I feel that at least the alignment should be inherited from the line where the cursor previously was. This is simply what users expect and what reduces unnecessary formatting work.\n\nThis behaviour might be configurable in case some users prefer it the current way.",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFSERVER-24274].\n  {panel}\n\nVia the tickets I can see Atlissian does not want customers using one instance of Confluence for multiple domains.\n\nPlease consider the scenario where Enterprise customers would be willing to pay for this feature via some kind of licensing model.\n\nI am in talks with a large Bank on CMS/Wiki solutions beyond SharePoint. I brought Confluence up but the big concern is not being able to use multiple domains. The second is no support for virtualized cluster, but I can deal with that creatively.\n\nHosted solutions are not options due to the sensitivity of the data. Starting on the IT side,\n\nhttps://webcash.bank.com\nhttps://trade.bank.com\n\nWould point load different spaces based on the domain name. Each space should not have awareness of the other. I know I can simulate this via Apache redirects, Virtual Hosting and removing the Dashboard link... but they want simplicity and some divisions are very territorial.\n\nInfrastructure costs are very very high (requirements for redundancy, DR, networking, staff to monitor the systems, ect.. ect..) so they would have no issue paying for additional licensing for this feature.\n\nI can see that to support this feature, Confluence simply needs to stop hard coding the base url. Instead, allow us to unlock more base urls if we purchases some kind of domain license and set corresponding \"Site Homepage\" urls with an option to remove the Dashboard link.\n\nPlease consider this as an option for all your products provided Atlissian is targetting the Enterprise market.",
