      "description": "As per the current users' feedback, one of our customers has listed some accessibility issues we've found with Confluence.\r\n\r\n\r\n!Tried with JAWS 2018 and NVDA\r\n\r\nh3. In general:\r\n\r\n     *   Lack of structure around the whole app (no landmarks for navigation areas, main page\u2026)\r\n     *   Hard to get a sense of what's there in the list of pages: no indication of current page, it doesn't announce what's expandable/collapsible, or nesting levels\r\n     *   Lots of labels missing\r\n     *   Rich text editors are clunky and have too many tab stops\r\n     *   Problem across the site: almost everything is incorrectly announced as \"Clickable\" (probably due to an event handler on a parent container), with JAWS\r\n     *   Registration can be a blocker for screen reader users due to the captcha\r\n\r\nh3. On the initial registration page from the invite email\r\n\r\n     *   we got stuck on the reCaptcha -- it keeps saying \"Checkbox not checked\" on the \"I'm not a robot\" checkbox, even when the check window appears. Initially unable to create an account. There is normally an audio verification challenge, but we were plain unable to even get there or identify that a challenge was present. After more tries it appears that this dialog displays after the end of the page (instead of being next to the \"I'm not a robot\" area). It took us 3 tries to reach the audio challenge, then once completed it refused it, and after reloading the page we were able to click the checkbox\r\n     *   Essentially, there are issues with reCaptcha in general, which should be made more accessible by Google, but the positioning of the window was odd and may be due to odd scripting.\r\n     *   Also the security progress bar for the password is not very clear, it doesn't announce its purpose and its status is not announced as it changes. When you arrow down after the password field it just announces \"Good\" without any further context\r\n\r\nh3.  Initial setup after registration\r\n\r\n     *   The steps line doesn't say what's the current step\r\n     *   p1 \"Upload an image\" button doesn't announce it's a button\r\n     *   P3 \"Go mobile\" page: no label on the app store/google play icons\r\n\r\nh3.  Dashboard - menu\r\n\r\n     *   The \"my profile\" menu (icon) is announced as gibberish, like \"88c59e4c655e25bb556f1\u2026\". It announces the src of the profile image, as it has no alt text or label.\r\n     *   Pop-up for creating a new page seems broken, the focus is lost in the background and nothing is announced. Navigating with the arrow keys works and moves the focus visually, but nothing is announced.\r\n     *   Spaces switcher not working correctly -- announced as Chevron, it is not announced as expanded or collapsed, and the current page is not clearly announced\r\n\r\nh3.     Navigation (list of pages in the left panel)\r\n\r\n     *   They are all announced as current, not possible to know which one is the currently selected one. In the menu buttons are not announced as collapsed or expanded, and their nesting level is not announced\r\n     *   When opening a page from the navigation, the page loads but user is not informed that the page has loaded -- it should move focus, or notify user that the page is ready to be navigated\r\n\r\nh3.   Reading pages\r\n\r\n     *   Reading pages is working fine, the hierarchy, tables, images that have alt text\u2026 all work fine.\r\n     *   However, confusing that everything is announced as \"clickable\", it is not easily possible to tell the difference between a link and static text\r\n     *   Adding comment/ rich text editor was confusing, there are too many buttons to tab through. Recommend looking at ARIA toolbar pattern to reduce this to one tab stop, for both keyboard & SR users\r\n     *   Search feature working fine, could be grouped better (unclear if the space and date belong to the link above or below)\r\n\r\nh3.   Edit a page\r\n\r\n     *   Not working well, hard to tell the difference between editable area and toolbar\r\n     *   Toolbar buttons not labelled correctly\r\n     *   The style switcher is not announced as a listbox, it says for example \"Heading 2, Link\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Description\r\n\r\nAfter migrating space by space from another Confluence instance, there might be users listed as\u00a0*Former Users*\r\nh3. Cause\r\n\r\nThe root cause of this issue is that the usernames associated with the users on the Server instance do not match the usernames of the same user in Cloud, and so the import system has no way to match the two users up.\r\n\r\nThe problem can be exacerbated if the users have had their cloud usernames changed in between importing spaces.\r\nh3. Fix\r\n\r\nThe long term fix is to user additional fields (such as email address) to match up users. This will take some time to implement.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nNote\r\n\r\nThis bug was discovered as part of this other bug:\u00a0https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFCLOUD-59989",
