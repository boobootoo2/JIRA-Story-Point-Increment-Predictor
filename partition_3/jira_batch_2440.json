This naive approach can lead to information leaking when the value is the same as some other known string, like the organization name for example.\n\nIf you have  {{SECURED_VARIABLE=myorganization}} and your organization is called {{myorganization}}, this will lead to the following output in the build log:\n\n{code}\n#!shell\n\n+ umask 000\n\n+ GIT_LFS_SKIP_SMUDGE=1 git clone --branch=\"test\" --depth 50 https://x-token-auth:$REPOSITORY_OAUTH_ACCESS_TOKEN@bitbucket.org/$SECURED_VARIABLE/project.git $BUILD_DIR ; git reset --hard <hash> ; git remote set-url origin git@bitbucket.org:$SECURED_VARIABLE/project.git\nCloning into &#x27;/opt/atlassian/pipelines/agent/build&#x27;...\nHEAD is now at <hash> <message>.\n\n+ chmod 777 $BUILD_DIR\n{code}\n\nSince the organization name is a known value, you can infer that {{$SECURED_VARIABLE}} is {{myorganization}}.\n\nWhile there&#x27;s no 100% safe way to do this since a lot of the output can be generated by the user, it&#x27;s possible to omit those substitutions in places where the output is 100% generated by Atllassian, such as the repository checkout stage, before the user script even begins.",
