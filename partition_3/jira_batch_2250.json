      "description": "I see the Agile Board's page title includes the name of the board, but for some reason when I open a new tab in Chrome and type 'agile' in the address bar it shows in the autocomplete the URLs of a few boards I use regularly, BUT it doesn't include the board names. The 'title' of the page that's shown after the url in the autocomplete is just 'Agile Board - JIRA', i.e. excluding the board name. This is a very small thing but makes it harder to find the board I want: I either need to remember the ID of the board or choose one randomly and see if it's the right one. Sure, I can then use the Agile menu to find the one I want, but if you could get the board's name appearing in that autocomplete list that'd be fantastic. \r\n\r\nMaybe this is because chrome is displaying the page title when the page loads but before javascript is run - it seems that the title is updated to include the board name only after page load. \r\n\r\n",

This is a BUG.  \r\n\r\n\r\nCloned issue. see below.\r\n\r\nI noticed today that the JIRA Classic project template appears to have disappeared from some Atlassian Cloud instances of JIRA.  Hopefully this is just an oversight and it will be reinstated soon.\r\n\r\nIf the case is that this move was deliberate, then I am opposed to its removal.  Managing JIRA as an administrator, especially at the enterprise level, is complicated by the number of schemes in the JIRA instance.  Having separate workflows, issue type schemes, issue type screen schemes, screen schemes, and screens for every single JIRA project is unmanageable when dealing with a large number of projects.  This is why I have always used the JIRA Classic/Default template since the introduction of Project Templates, as it creates no new schemes.  For a responsible JIRA administrator, applying the correct schemes is significantly less work than replacing and deleting unwanted schemes.",
