Here's a good example of a scenario where this feature is important. \n{quote}\nImagine I want to search for the picture of a black cat. I search for \"black cat\" and probably get no results, because the pictures are not named blackcat.jpg but mycute_cat123.jpg etc. instead. So I try again and just search for \"cat\", now I get 50 results, great. But I have to click on all the attachments to find out, if it really is a picture of a black cat or not. Well, probably there isn't a black cat at all, so I spend minutes checking all the results for nothing. With thumbnails on the other hand, I could just quickly scan the thumbnail results and be done. So yes, the search might render 0.2 seconds faster without thumbnails, but what good is that, if the users task is nearly impossible to complete.{quote}\n\nDue to this, I believe there should be an option for use to disable or enable this feature based on their need.\n\nIt would be good to extend this to files/attachments preview too.",

Some of these could include:\n* Last login date (e.g., show me all users who haven't logged in in 180 days).\n* People who are a member of one group but not another (e.g., who is in \"QA\" but not \"UK-QA\").\n* List all users who can access a specified space (i.e., by virtue of being a member of a certain group which has permission).\n\nIdeally I'd like some sort of way running a query string against the user database. I used to be able to do this using a user macro but since my user base has grown to nearly 2000 users, the operation times out before completion (in any case, a search like this was very inefficient, often taking minutes).\n\nFinally, if possible, I'd then like the ability to perform bulk operations on the results but that's probably a whole different request.",

Java source code is properly generated but JAXB is not able to successfully unmarshal a valid XML file conforming to the XSD. I have provided below the XSD, my conformant XML file, and my Java code used to unmarshal.\n\nMy specific problem is as below. I am using a custom Java class named com.tree.JAXBLeafNode for the element LeafNode in the XSD and have provided corresponding JaxB annotations to NOT generate Java beans for this element. I have also provided a custom XmlAdapter to marshal/unmarshal the element LeafNode. My custom marshal/unmarshaling handles converting the XML attributes appearing in the element LeafNode into some custom Java objects. LeafNode's parent element RootOrInnerNode, however, has the standard confluence-JAXB generated - Java beans. It has a List<JAXBElement<?>> to hold the contained LeafNode elements. It should be noted that, in the XSD, LeafNode's parent element RootOrInnerNode only contains the element AbstractNode as a direct child element and not the element LeafNode itself. LeafNode is rather indirectly rendered as a child of RootOrInnerNode since it is a substitution group for the element AbstractNode. Upon inspection using eclipse's debugger, I discovered that the List<JAXBElement<?>> in RootOrInnerNode contains a  null for the LeafNodes. It appears that my custom XMLAdapter for the element LeafNode is not called, while instantiating its parent element RootOrInnerNode's JAXB bean and hence, the List<JAXBElement<?>> is not populated with the corresponding LeafNodes\n\nI have these constraints upon the XSD and custom Java bean,Adapter and marshal/unmarshall methods, while fixing this error. 1) I cannot change the schema. AbstractNode must exist the way it is in the XSD and both the RootOrInnerNode and LeafNode should have the existing associations with AbstractNode. This is the case since changing the XSD triggers lot bigger changes in several other parts of the project. 2) I must use custom Java beans named com.tree.JAXBLeafNode for the element LeafNode and a custom XMLAdapter since, I expect the binary data anyAttribute namespace==\"##any\" in the LeafNode element and do a lot of custom processing of this data.\n\nWould be of great help if I can obtain a way to generate the right LeafNode objects into the List<JAXBElement<?>> in RootOrInnerNode.",

And when a new div.wiki-content element (a new page) will be opened there will be a untouched counter value.\n\nPlease add a class to the div.wiki-content element that can classify the heading level (h1,h2,..h7) of the page title of the enclosed content (actually it will be enaught to copy the name of the type of the first child of the div.wiki-content > div.pagetitle element).\n\nSomething like this:\n\n<div class=\"wiki-content h1\">\n    <div class=\"pagetitle\" id=\"Main topic\">\n        <h1>Main topic</h1>\n....\n    </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"hidden rendered-page\"></div>\n <div class=\"wiki-content h2\">\n    <div class=\"pagetitle\" id=\"Subpage title\">\n        <h2>Subpage title</h2>\n\nYou can check the difference in this JS Fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/9pJdS/4/ (see the css to point the feature use)",
