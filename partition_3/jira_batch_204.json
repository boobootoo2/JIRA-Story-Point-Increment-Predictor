      "description": "h3. Problem Definition\r\n\r\n    Per documentation at [Ending a Sprint|https://confluence.atlassian.com/agile/jira-agile-user-s-guide/working-with-sprints/ending-a-sprint] , when ending a sprint, any incomplete issues should be moved to the next planned sprint if available. Otherwise, the issues should be moved to the backlog.\r\n\r\n    However, when a project has multiple boards, and a sprint is completed from a board based on a JIRA issue filter, any incomplete issues not visible from that specific board are not moved to the next sprint, and are instead placed in the backlog. Only the incomplete issues visible to that specific board are moved into the next sprint.\r\n\r\n    To reproduce,\r\n#    Create a new project (e.g. TestProject)\r\n#     Add 4 issues to the project, and assign 2 of them with a Labels value of A, and the other 2 with a Labels value of B\r\n#     Add two sprints (e.g. Sprint #1, and Sprint #2), and place one issue with Labels = A and one issue with Labels = B in each.\r\n#     Create and save a new Issue filter (e.g. Filter A): project = TestProject AND labels = A\r\n#     Create a new board (e.g. Board A) in the project from an existing Saved Filter, using Filter A\r\n#     Start Sprint #1 from any board\r\n#     Complete Sprint #1 from Board A\r\n\r\n    Results: The incomplete issue visible in Board A was moved to Sprint #2. However, in the default board, we can see the hidden issue was moved into the Backlog instead of Sprint #2.\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n\r\n    Move all incomplete issues in a sprint, even those not visible in the current Board, to the next sprint when completing the Sprint, assuming there exists a next planned sprint. This will allow for more consistent, predictable behavior.\r\n\r\n    For additional flexibility, provide the user a choice on where incomplete issues (visible and not visible to the current Board) should go. This is similar to the existing open suggestion: https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/GHS-6421\r\n\r\n    If this behavior is not currently documented, update the \"Ending a Sprint\" article to elaborate on this behavior.    \r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\n    Avoid completing sprints from a board where issues in the sprint are not visible.\r\n",

      "description": "Currently Jira doesn't allow you to graphically move issues between swimlanes, because it's said that it can't really tell what modifications are needed for an issue to meet a certain criteria for a swimlane, basically because they can be complex.\r\n\r\nHowever, many times the conditions are not compex at all and they are based just on a one field filter. For example, if you have a swimlane for \"priority = High\" and other for \"priority = Low\", Jira could easily consider the lane as \"switchable\", because the only thing that it would need to do is to set the priority to Low or High depending on the swimlane. It could even detect ANDed conditions, like \"priority = Low and assignee = Peter\". Its obvious that for an issue to be there it has to meet both conditions, and it's obvious for Jira what to do (set priority to Low and assignee to Peter). \r\n\r\nDifferent are the cases where conditions are ORed or lists of values are used, but for many, many of the cases, this could be achieved quite easily.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\nRegards.",

I can\u2019t see any cases where a user would want this.\r\n\r\nThe work around:\r\nWhen needing to move a story from an active sprint on one agile board to an active sprint on another agile board, drag the issue from Board A\u2019s active sprint into Board A\u2019s backlog.\r\n\u2018Move\u2019 issue from Board A\u2019s backlog to Board B\u2019s backlog. \r\nThe drag the issue from Board B\u2019s backlog to Board B\u2019s active sprint. \r\nThis is the only correct way I know of for executing a \u201cmove\u201d of one issue in an active sprint on one Board to another Board without \"linking\" the boards and messing up reporting.\r\n\r\nThe \u201cFix\u201d if you have this issue:\r\nIf the 2 boards have already been \u201clinked\u201d, then you may have to try a few things to decouple them.

This is great but it's still a bit tricky to visualise all the subtask that belong to a parent in this way when the board is busy.\r\n\r\nh5. Suggested Solution\r\nMy thought for an improvement was that when you hover your mouse over either a parent or a subtask then all the other subtasks/parent are highlighted in some way so you can scan across the screen and see which subtasks are in which column for that parent issue alone.\r\n\r\nThe highlighting could be a subtle outlining of the related subtasks and issues or a dimming of the unrelated subtask and issues.\r\n\r\nYou could even have a context option over each to \"Show only related subtasks\" that would provide a kind of dynamic Quick Filter which would just show that parent and subtasks.\r\n\r\n+note+ - this is not a problem when the rows are grouped per issue, but is when they're grouped per assignee.",

      "description": "The switch to Jira Software provides no way for users to create a new project and manually assign screens, schemes, and workflows as was possible in the previous version. Currently, users are forced to select a Jira Software or Jira Business option that will automatically create a new series of screens, schemes, and workflows for the project. This is problematic for users who have created their screens, schemes, and workflows ahead of time and simply wish to assign them to a new project. As it stands, the user can assign their custom screens, schemes, and workflows but must then go through extra steps to delete the unnecessary screens, schemes, and workflows that Jira Software automatically creates based on the options presented upon project creation.  \r\n\r\nWhile users can certainly edit the series of screens, schemes, and workflows automatically created for a new project, problems still exist with that approach. For example, since an active workflow cannot be renames, the process to simply rename the automatically created workflow becomes drawn out i.e. unassign, rename, reassign OR create and assign a new workflow.\r\n\r\nIn short, there should be an option to manually select the screens, schemes, and workflows for a new project and users should not be forced into automatically created options. If a user already has screens, schemes, and workflows made and configured the way they want, then what's the point of forcing them to use pre-made options that they're just going to delete anyway? Re-adding an option to manually assign screens, schemes, and workflows during project creation will go a long way toward catering to a wider range of users and maintains the flexibility that users come to depend on with Jira.",

Problem Definition\r\nAt the moment, some Agile custom fields such Epic Link, Epic Name, Srpint, Rank, etc are *locked*, as they are the main custom field in JIRA Agile, and we would like to prevent the human error of mistakenly deleting or editing them. However, other main custom field such as Story Point, is not locked. When the user is not familiar with the main field in JIRA Agile (since it's listed as custom field), the user could delete it, and lose the data or this field's values, which will be a huge impact for the user's Agile data. Especially if this is highly being referred by the stories in JIRA Agile.\r\n\r\nh5. Suggested Solution\r\nIt would be great if the JIRA Agile custom fields are all locked. So this will be helpful for the user in the following scenarios:\r\n* User would know that these are the automatically created custom fields by JIRA Agile\r\n* These are most likely used by the team while working with JIRA Agile\r\n* Prevent human error of mistakenly deleting it",
