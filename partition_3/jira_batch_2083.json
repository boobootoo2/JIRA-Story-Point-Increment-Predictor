We've noticed that when a user clicks on a question the system navigates them to a different page instead of opening questions in a new window. We see this as a threat to user retention as there is no strong \"link back\" process and no way to edit the page to add a \"tip\". We've noted the \"source\" link option, however, we would have to train 7000 users to remember that step. \n\nWe are requesting an enhancement that would allow Questions to open in a new window. Please advise on the feasibility of this and potential turnaround time.\n\nThank you!",

There was too much ui complexity in it.\n\nThe interface of searching through topics should be improved some more. \n\nThere should be a way to search with multiple topics.   Some topics requires additional properties like product topics.  Topics and grouping or topics should be limiting topics.\n\nSo if I search by \n\nsql-server\n\n I see all questions with this label (like it does now)\n\nIf I search by\n\nsql-server jira (which does not work)\n\nI see all questions with these two labels and all questions with sq-server without any product labels.  I should be able to visually see this distinction as well.\n\nif I search by \n\nconfiguration sql-server  jira\n\nI would like to see all questions with all questions with\njira configuration sql-server\njira configuration\njira sql-server\nconfiguration (with no product label)\nsql-server (with no product label)\n\nAgain I should visually see this distinction on how you want to display the results.\n\nI think showing the various grouping of the labels and allowing the user to select or click the groupings he want to look at might be an interesting approach.\n\nYes, this type of interface breaks down if you have too many topics(labels) but in reality a user will probably enter no more than 4 to 6 labels in the most common cases.  I would not restrict the number either since the interface would only be listing the proper set of combinations and not actually selecting the question themselves.\n\nI like that you are autocompleting the list of topics for a single topic,  there should be a way to do this with multiple topics as well.  Otherwise I would like to see an ordered list of topics that I can browse through and select from.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Is there any way we can have specific labels applied to questions when users create them, so that the questions go to the appropriate topic group.\n\nFor example, if a user is viewing all questions for a particular topic and they ask a question from within that context, could you apply the current topic label to the Question by default?    This feature would make it easier to keep questions organized and wouldn't rely on users having to remember to apply the correct topics to new questions.  If users don't apply curated labels, they won't reach the appropriate set of Watchers and their question will likely go unanswered.",

It was just addictive, it makes you want to participate just for the sake of pushing the cursor upwards. It also displayed your inactivity periods, so you didn't want to look like a slacker and you'd make the effort of answering one or two questions every fortnight. Which is an addiction trigger.\n\nNow it's gone. You might want to check what's user engagement since the transition.\n\nBest of luck Sam,\nAdrien",

In one recent case, I redirected the asker to Bitbucket support, but they categorized the question as \"development-related\", and told them to take it back to Answers (according to policy). However, the question went unanswered for days because staff didn't happen to notice it. In the meantime, they helpfully answered other questions that didn't require their attention.\n\nI imagine this issue would be more useful for Confluence Questions customers, who may often have staff that spend no time monitoring the site except to moderate spam.",

The Unanswered filter is useful for finding questions with 0 answers, but in some cases a question may be truly unanswered even though it has \u201canswers\u201d posted. For example, Paul just responded to many of the unanswered questions with an answer that was just asking if it still needed to be answered. Because of that, these questions no longer show up in the Unanswered filter. We should probably discourage people from doing that, but with this alternate sort order you could look at questions with only 1 \u201canswer\u201d.\nAn alternative (or in addition) would be to make Unanswered (or a new filter) include any questions without a \u201cselected\u201d answer regardless of how many \u201canswers\u201d have been posted and encourage people to choose a selected answer when their questions are answered. Most people don\u2019t seem to select an answer currently though so this might not be good enough by itself\u2026might still need the Number of Answers option.",

The question is just higher on the page. Does the voting change anything visually besides the vote counter? With Atlassian Answers, having the question hold more weight (bigger, bolder font) made sense. And maybe higher voted answers rise to the top of the rank, get a bigger font as well... but having the same weight throughout is visually confusing. The interface does seem nicely simplified.\n\nI'm currently using Confluence and JIRA Service Desk to build our site's support structure and am very interested in your new designs.",

I added a recent questions list with a topic \"visual_statistics\" on my page and both in the preview as in the page after saving it shows a topic that doesn't have a tag \"visual_statistics\", but \"visual_analytics\" (which is a different product).\n\nSee screenshots.\n\nThanks for investigating,\n\nGianni",
