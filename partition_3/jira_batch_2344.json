Your input in the comments helps us understand how this affects you and what you're hoping to accomplish with Bitbucket Data Center.\r\n\r\nWe spend a significant amount of time determining our product investments in Bitbucket Data Center. Unfortunately, we are not planning to address this suggestion in the next 12 months. In the last year, we have resolved many of the highly voted suggestions like Reviewer groups, Pull request templates, capability to enable/disable source branch deletion on merging pull requests and our upcoming roadmap includes a number of other top voted suggestions, including repository archiving. Please check out our [public roadmap|https://www.atlassian.com/roadmap/data-center?product=bitbucket] for more details on the coming soon and future items.\r\n\r\nI understand that this may be disappointing, but it\u2019s important for us to be open, honest, and transparent with our customers. Product feedback is collected from many different sources and is evaluated when planning the product roadmap. You can\u00a0[learn more about our process here|https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/110373/how-does-the-jira-team-use-jira-atlassian-com].\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nImran Khan\r\nProduct Manager - Bitbucket Server and Data Center\r\n{panel}\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe code search shipped with 4.6.0 does not handle punctuation well when indexing code. In order to locate occurrences reliably, it should be improved to allow for search criteria with certain punctuation characters taken into account.\r\n\r\nComments with example searches and example results are very welcome to help us cover the right set of characters.\r\n\r\nAs a workaround it is possible to search for adjacent strings (> 2 characters each) separated by punctuation using phrase syntax. eg to find left_pad you could search for \"left pad\" (including quotes).\r\n\r\nOriginal description:\r\n\r\nHi,\r\nwe have installed the version 4.6.0 of the bitbucket server and will replace the stash soon.\r\nIn the document:\r\n[https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/search-for-code-in-bitbucket-server-814204781.html]\r\nthe options and restrictions of the code search are documented.\r\n\r\nIn our company we have a lot of projects and repositories which means that there is a need to find code for global refactorings in a very exact way that result in a small amount of matches.\r\n\r\nBecause of that need, the following restrictions are not good for the results we get:\r\n # All punctuation characters are removed\r\n # Case is not preserve\r\n # Regular expressions in queries are not supported\r\n\r\nIs there a plan to improve the query posibilities in the next releases?\r\n\r\nOne small improvement might help to minimize matches. If we get a filename: key word beside the ext: key word to restrict our search.\r\n\r\nIs there already such a key word?\r\n\r\nRegards\r\nHarald",

      "description": "We know that there is a 1 minute timeout limitation on the merge page. This causes problem when the merge hook requires more than 1 minute to finish the work therefore we implement something to handle this case. Here is the flow:\r\n# When PR page is loaded, Stash calls the merge hook.\r\n# Merge hook makes a REST call to the backend.\r\n# The backend starts validating config.\r\n# Polling for 40s for the result.\r\n## If validation finishes within 40s, returns result to Stash as soon as we've got the result.\r\n## If validation cannot finish within 40s, return False and veto in merge hook.\r\n## The validation result is cached in our backend.\r\n# At any time, there can be other user opening the same PR page.\r\n# Merge hook is loaded and making the same call to backend.\r\n# Backend determines if this is the same request (same repo, pull request id, from reference, to reference).\r\n# If there is already a job processing this validation, returns False to merge hook and veto.\r\n# If validation result is in cache, returns the result.\r\n\r\nThe problem happens in this way:\r\n# Once the PR page is loaded, user click on Merge (before merge hook got the result).\r\n# Then user click 'Merge' button in the popup attempting to merge (because user does not know the merge hook is still processing).\r\n# The popup closes itself. I guess it triggers the merge hook again because I see another request sending to our backend.\r\n# A triangle with exclamation mark shows the veto message about validating. Merge button disabled.\r\n!snapshot2.png!\r\n# After some seconds, the validation finishes and the triangle disappears itself because validation passed. Merge button becomes enabled.\r\n# Click Merge. Popup comes out with Merge button disabled and the loading icon stale.\r\n!snapshot1.png!\r\n# Close the popup and click Merge again. Same stale popup.\r\n# Refresh the page. Since our backend returns the cached result immediately, we are able to merge by clicking Merge and click Merge in the popup.\r\n\r\nFrom Stash access log, I see it's done by two calls: merge (POST) and automerge (GET). I guess the merge (POST) call is made by the Merge button in popup which tries to get the result from automerge (GET). When this problem happens, the popup never issues automerge (GET) to Stash server. It just pops up and do nothing, showing the stale loading icon. The PR page is able to obtain the latest result by making triangle disappeared and enable the button but the popup is not able to handle that.\r\n\r\n{code}atlassian-stash-access-2016-05-16.1.log:127.0.0.1 | http | o@CFIYL2x1100x9968495x1 | dkunchamwar | 2016-05-16 18:20:31,666 | \"GET /rest/branch-utils/latest/projects/CORE/repos/trading_service-prod/automerge/path HTTP/1.1\" | \"http://stash/projects/CORE/repos/trading_service-prod/pull-requests/366/overview\" \"Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.3;

Cause\r\n\r\nThe reason for this behavior is due to how git handles the {{--follow}} flag, which is what Bitbucket uses to handle renames within the system.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nDisabling the rename tracking functionality globally by adding the following to your {{$BITBUCKET_HOME/shared/bitbucket.properties}} will allow these commits to be seen as expected:\r\n\r\n* {{commit.list.follow.renames=false}}",

      "description": "We recently upgraded from Stash 3.8 to Bitbucket Server 4.5.2. After doing so we noticed a quirk/issue with our JIRA to Bitbucket Server integration:\r\n\r\nIn our Bitbucket Server repository, we had enabled 3 of the 4 branch prefixes for our branching model:\r\n\r\n# Feature, set with branch prefix \"issue/\"\r\n# Hotfix, branch prefix \"patch/\"\r\n# Release, branch prefix \"release/\"\r\n\r\nWith Stash 3.8, if we used JIRA's Stash integration to create a branch from an issue of type \"Bug\" (which does not map to any of the 3 Bitbutcket Server branch types we have configured), Stash's \"Create branch\" screen would simply default to a Branch Type of \"Feature\" and give us the expected branch prefix \"issue/\".\r\n\r\nNow, after we upgraded to Bitbucket Server, if we use the same JIRA integration with Bitbucket Server to create a branch from an issue of type \"Bug\" (which still does not map to any of the 3 Bitbutcket Server branch types we have configured), Bitbucket Server's \"Create branch\" screen would default to a Branch Type of \"Feature\", but it will NOT append the branch prefix \"issue/\" - it won't append anything in this case.\r\n\r\nIf the user toggles the Branch Type dropdown (i.e. even though it shows \"Branch Type\" set to Feature, click the \"Branch Type\" dropdown and select Feature again), then the expected branch prefix \"issue/\" will be appended.\r\n\r\nWe noticed the issue in Bitbucket Server 4.5.2 (because that's what we upgraded to from Stash 3.8), but after some testing trial and error I discovered this issue first cropped up in Bitbucket Server 4.1.6 (or at least, sometime after Bitbucket Server 4.0.1 - which still behaved like Stash 3.8.x, 3.9.x, etc.).\r\n\r\nI've attached a couple of screenshots to illustrate this.\r\n\r\nWe would like the old behavior back (i.e. the pre-Bitbucket Server 4.1.6 behavior).\r\n\r\nOr if we can't get the original behavior, if would could assign the same branch prefix to multiple branch types in Bitbucket Server - so if we could set \"Feature\" and \"Bugfix\" branch types to the same prefix (\"issue/\" in our case), that would also be acceptable.\r\n\r\nBasically we don't need to differentiate between Features and Bugfix branches with different branch prefixes - we prefer them to be under the same prefix.\r\n",

Suggested Solution\r\nThe PID should be moved to a more acceptable location based on the environment that Elasticsearch is being run on.\r\n \r\nh3. Workaround \r\nh5. Linux\r\nChange line 42 of {{start-search.sh}} to change the {{piddir}} to an acceptable folder. \r\nIf running as a service, the {{PIDFILE}} variable in {{/etc/init.d/atlbitbucket_search}} will need to be changed.",

Was expecting /usr/local/bin/git receive-pack /Users/pepoirot/Dev/apps-home/stash-default/data/repositories/51, instead got SSH - git-receive-pack '/project_1/linux.git'\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nThis is caused by the combination of two things:\r\n\r\n# the utilisation of a ThreadLocal in [UtilTimerStack|https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-profiling/src/c244da31635937fbb47cef7da31cfed8760b4b2f/src/main/java/com/atlassian/util/profiling/UtilTimerStack.java?at=atlassian-profiling-1.9#cl-39] to store a snapshot of the current time / memory usage in _atlassian-profiling_:\r\n{code:java}\r\nUtilTimerStack.push(\"foo\");\r\ntry {\r\n// do stuff\r\n} finally {\r\n   UtilTimerStack.pop(\"bar\");\r\n}\r\n{code}\r\n (Thus if the _push()_ and _pop()_ operations do not occur in the same thread, the snapshots don't match and the class logs the _\"Unmatched Timer\"_ error.)\r\n# and the utilisation of the [ProfilingProcessMonitor|https://stash.dev.internal.atlassian.com/projects/STASH/repos/stash/browse/platform/src/main/java/com/atlassian/stash/internal/process/ProfilingProcessMonitor.java?at=refs%2Ftags%2Fstash-parent-2.10.0] in Stash, which invoke the push / pop operations in different threads:\r\n{noformat}\r\n### push ### ssh-scm-request-handler ### SSH - git-receive-pack '/project_1/linux.git'\r\n...\r\n### push ### ssh-scm-request-handler ### Ticket com.atlassian.stash.throttle.ThrottleService.acquireTicket(String)\r\n### pop  ### ssh-scm-request-handler ### Ticket com.atlassian.stash.throttle.ThrottleService.acquireTicket(String)\r\n### push ### ssh-scm-request-handler ### /usr/local/bin/git receive-pack /Users/pepoirot/Dev/apps-home/stash-default/data/repositories/51\r\n### pop  ### ExtProcess - IO Pump:thread-7 ### /usr/local/bin/git receive-pack /Users/pepoirot/Dev/apps-home/stash-default/data/repositories/51\r\n### pop  ### ssh-scm-request-handler ### SSH - git-receive-pack '/project_1/linux.git'\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nAs seen above, the last _push()_ occurs in the _ssh-scm-request-handler_ while the corresponding _pop()_ occurs in one of the process's IO pump in process-utils.\r\n\r\nAfter discussing with [~cofarrell], the problem seems to date back to at least Stash 2.0, when _ProfilingProcessMonitor_ was introduced to [replace the manual call in BaseCommand |https://stash.dev.internal.atlassian.com/projects/STASH/repos/stash/commits/1af15a0ca8748ba5f6aef385c886f88b4d391ff4#spi/src/main/java/com/atlassian/stash/scm/BaseCommand.java].",
