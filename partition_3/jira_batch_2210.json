It appears that at some point after Confluence 2.0 this ability was removed due to security concerns but the documentation was not updated at the time. I ran into this and filed the following bug at http://support.atlassian.com -- CSP-3044.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nI had a call from a Space Administrator today who was trying to modify the custom decorators for a space per these instructions.\n\nhttp://confluence.atlassian.com/display/CONF20/Working+with+Custom+Decorators\n\nHowever, he couldn't view the \"Layout\" link in the \"Look and Feel\" section of the \"Space Administration\" page (he only had 3 items there rather than 4). To test, I created a user, gave it space administration privileges and verified I couldn't see the \"Layout\" link. Interestingly enough, my regular user which has full Confluence Administration privileges (\"Administrate Confluence\" in \"Global Permissions\") could see the \"Layout\" link in \"Space Administration\".\n\nSome further testing showed that the only users who can see the \"Layout\" button in the \"Space Administration\" page are those with full \"Administrate Confluence\" privileges.\n\nSince the documentation above says \"You need to be a space administrator to edit decorator files.\" I'm presuming this is a bug and hope it can be easily/quickly fixed.\n\nI also tried to manually go to the layout link as a space administrator user and was denied with a \"You are not permitted to perform this operation.\" message.\n\nThanks for your help. \n\n~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe response was that \"Unfortunately it is a security risk to allow space administrators to put arbitrary velocity markup in layouts -- they could escalate their priviledges to those of the global administrator.\"\n\nI then noted that the docs were incorrect and asked if this had changed recently....the answer was \"At one time they could. The ideal solution would be to make sure that a 'bad' layout can't produce a security problem, but that's hard. You can raise a feature request for more granular permissions at http://jira.atlassian.com and we will consider it. \".\n\nSo....I'm making a feature request here that Space Administrators could selectively be allowed to edit the Layout files (Velocity files). I'm not very picky as to whether it's a global Confluence preference (i.e. all Space Administrators can edit Layout files) or an extra Space permissions.\n\nThanks.",

Once changes made I am in troubles.\n\n2. Give a label to a point in time (let's call it a view) and do #1 based on the label.\n\n3. Allow seeing under a specific space the set of \"views\" that are available based on labels defined in #2.\n\nBottom line - take a look at source control systems and bring features from there. The more you bring the better. \n\nThat would be an awsome capability.\n",

If an image attachment was not found, it use to just show an missing image box.  Now it shows a red error message.  This looks ugly if you were using the missing image as a place holder.  We have just migrated a bunch of pages that use to look fine with missing images and now look ugly.  For things like this and other similar cases, error handling could be improved.  On one hand you want to show the author problems when they are creating or modifying a page.  On the other hand, we don't want end users who look at pages to see ugly error messages.   Have you considered other options for error handling?\n> 1) mouse over text showing error text ?\n> 2) separate info area that shows error details ?\n> 3) error tab ?\nGenerally speaking, errors that are not that critical and may be left in the text on purpose should present in a way that is ok to look at.  For example, red highlighted area (but no error message).  I think there are examples of this today.  \n",

For example, I'd like to base my section on this site (on the right, one page down):\n\n  http://xooglers.blogspot.com/\n\nI'd hoped that this would do what I wanted:\n\n  {blog-posts:5|content=titles} \n\nbut that renders the titles within a table with multiple columns (Title, Author, Date Posted).\n\nI'd really like to have a stripped down option that just renders the articles in a <ul> with a unique class so that I can style it in CSS. Based on how other macros work, maybe this should be a 'style=ul' option.\n\nI know that the plugins are all open source now so I could go implement this myself, but I'm hoping that this seems useful enough that you'll do it for me. :-) If not, any hints you can give me as to how to write this myself would be gratefully appreciated.\n",

If  there is already an instance (such as in the case of a component) it should be used, otherwise in the case of a macro it could be created and destroyed just for the event calling.\n\nOther implementation ideas welcome! (Feel free to pick holes in my idea too)",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFSERVER-5302].\n  {panel}\n\nAtlassians,\n\nAs per my understanding, right now user management is completely done by confluence administrators.\nHence very simple task like creating user account, adding them to different user groups for any space; can be done by only by confluence administrator.\n\nI was wondering is it possible to delegate this task to Space Administrator as those are right guys to take decision on whom they want to add to their space and if they want to users to specific user-groups. As a Confluence Administrator, I don't want to spend my time in doing these time consuming tasks for hundreds of spaces, when space admins are better suited to do that.\n\nAny idea when such kind of feature will be available ? Please let's know.\n\n{panel}\n*Current* options as suggested by Atlassian [Comment by David Soul on 22nd Oct]:\n\n1. Install the Custom Space User Management (CSUM) Plugin to allow space administrators to manage users at http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/CONFEXT/Custom+Space+User+Management+Plugin\n\n*At last I end up in developing this CSUM plugin (version 1.0). Version 2.0 (currently rc3 release) is much better with many requested features and better UI with very active contributions from Gary, Ren, Andy*\n\n2. Install the Invite Plugin to allow space administrators to invite users by email from http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/CONFEXT/Invite+Plugin\n\n3. Use external user management such as LDAP or Active Directory and allow space administrator to grant users through there\n\n4. Grant site administration rights\n\n5. Grant site admin rights to a specific user and ask space admins to delegate their user administration tasks to this person\n{panel}\n\nthanks,\nRajendra",

[See the corresponding bug report|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFSERVER-5254].\r\n  {panel}\r\n\r\nh3. Issue Summary\r\nIn some cases, it's possible for two labels to be created with the same name (even though we do checks for this). It can occur when there are two parallel requests (via the web or XML-RPC), which try to add the same (non-existent) label. Since they're in separate transactions, it's not possible to see that another session is trying to create the label, so both end up in the DB.\r\n\r\nFor example, new labels can be created via API using the [add labels to content API endpoint|https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/confluence/rest/api-group-content-labels/#api-wiki-rest-api-content-id-label-post]. If users use this API endpoint multiple times and fast enough, and no label exists at the start of the execution of their script, then multiple labels will be created with the same name.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Have a script that calls the above end point very quickly or in parallel for multiple pieces of content and using the same label name.\r\n# Run the script\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nOne label is created and is associated with all content\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nMultiple labels are created with the same name. It seems to be random which content gets which duplicate, but typically one label will have the most associations.\r\n\r\nThis can be confirmed by using the Label List macro and noting that multiple labels are listed with the same name.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\nIf duplicate labels have been created:\r\n# Remove these labels from all content either manually or by utilizing [the remove label from content API endpoint|https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/confluence/rest/api-group-content-labels/#api-wiki-rest-api-content-id-label-label-delete].\r\n# Add the labels back either manually or by utilizing the [add labels to content API endpoint|https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/confluence/rest/api-group-content-labels/#api-wiki-rest-api-content-id-label-post]. Since the label exists by the time these requests are received, only one label will be used this time, regardless of the speed of the API calls.\r\n\r\nThe above process will ensure that all labels have one and only one label, rather than any duplicate label.\r\n\r\nTo prevent this issue from happening in the future, for each new label to be created, make sure that the label exists first (either via UI or one API call), then subsequent calls will use the already created label regardless of the speed at which those calls are created.\r\n\r\nh3. Possible solutions to this\r\n\r\nWrite a periodic task that merges any duplicate labels (and the affected content)\r\nIsolate the sections of the current transaction in the save process, to narrow the window in which this can occur\r\nAdd some sort of read/write filtering to the transaction so the changes can be seen before the transaction ends",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFSERVER-5186].\n  {panel}\n\nThe idea behind space channels is relatively simple in terms of concept, but probably quite a lot of work in terms of implementation.\n\nLabels allow us to easily tag content, effectively categorising it. However, it seems there is still one component missing that would tie up lots of loose ends such as:\n\n* Namespaces\n* Spaces within spaces (eg. for dealing with permissions across blocks of content in a space)\n* Permissions (see above)\n* etc.\n\nNOTE: I know that what follows could essentially be done with multiple spaces, however there are many times when it's not practical or desirable to do so, hence the channels idea.\n\nThe channels idea works as follows:\n\n1. A space admin can create one or more channels (there would likely be a default channel for all content).\n\n2. For each channel, the space admin can select what privileges are assigned to groups/users/anon for that channel - eg. who can edit content in that channel.\n\n3. Ideally, the space admin should also be able to define what macros/templates can be used within a channel. Being able to have an email archive per channel would also be highly useful.\n\nA default channel would be used to deal with old content - eg. when you upgrade to the version of Confluence that has channels, everything gets put in to the default channel for each space (pages, templates, mail archive, space permissions). Due to this default channel, you'd instantly then be able to define what macros can be used in a space.\n\nNow, let's say you want a team (user group) to be able to edit one section of a space and not another - simply create a new channel and assign the privs, etc.\n\nPages would then have a channel drop-down (a page can only be in one channel).  You would obviously need a \"Change channel\" permission somewhere. Any pages created that are attached to a parent page would automatically inherit the parent page's channel - for most users (who cannot \"change channel\") they would be none the wiser as the option would not be available (the applicable channel would merely be displayed as text) = keeps things simple for them.  So, from an editing point of view, there's not too much work involved.\n\nYou would not be able to move pages outside of a given channel - someone with \"change channel\" priv would have to do that for you = nice container allowing orgnaisations to contain content for a given channel within that channel.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, each channel could have it's own mail archive and templates.  The mail archive is particularly interesting as you would then have the ability for teams to work side by side in a space, each with their own archive.\n\nTemplates should be able to be in all channels, one channel or several channels - eg. if you want to share a common template with all channels in a space.\n\nYou could search by channel.  You could export a channel (eg. to Word = great for documentation, etc). You could get an RSS feed for the channel.\n\nBeing able to set permissions and what macros can be used in a channel means that different groups with different experience and privileges/needs can be more effectively \"boxed in\" within a space.\n\nComments?",
