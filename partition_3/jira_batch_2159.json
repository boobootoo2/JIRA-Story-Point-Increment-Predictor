This is apparently a known issue documented [here|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Garbage+Collector+Performance+Issues#GarbageCollectorPerformanceIssues-Use32bitJREifHeap%3C2GB]. \n\nProblem is, that documentation is not-obvious, and customers may not be aware of it until they start hitting into issues, and finally raising support tickets to resolve it. Naturally, if I am using a 64-bit OS, I would of course, download a 64 bit Confluence Installer. (note also that Confluence 64-bit comes pre-defined with low Xmx: 512m)\n\nMy suggestion would be to put a note (to warn customers of such a performance issue with 64bit Installers) in the following areas:\n# The Confluence download page (most important place)\n# https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Confluence+Installation+Guide\n",

However, Atlassian recommends in their documentation to use a NoPrint macro to create content that should not be in an export. \n\nThe export to PDF option is used often for creating customer-facing documentation.  However, not having the noprint doesn't allow a write to keep content together, with some content only pertinent for employees such as configuration, support, or implementation teams. \n\nNot having this requires us to create and maintain separate document which disrupts the flow and can be confusing. \n\nIt would also address the current issue with the NoPrint attribute on the TOC being broken. We use the TOC often to assist with online navigation; but, it is not always appropriate to have this in exported, client-facing documentation.

However, Atlassian recommends in their documentation to create a Page Break macro in order to control page breaks when exporting content to PDF. \n\nThe export to PDF option is used often for creating customer-facing documentation.  Not having this control in order to keep text/tables together, text/images together, and avoid orphan headings, creates extremely unprofessional documentation and not a good representation of the company to the clients. \n\nHaving this macro out of the box for OnDemand users would allow them to use this key value of using the content without having to use a hack that causes frustration and confusion when other users are editing doc and not knowing how to manage the page breaks; it also creates additional space at the top of the page.  The option only available to OnDemand users is to update the CSS to break after a defined header, e.g. h6, and then input text that is h6 and make it white to force a break.",

Right now this isn't a big issue, but lets do it right\u2026\n\nAttached to the issue, is a pic of the issue, and in my mind the quicker solution is to say the inline dialog should display at least 11 child nodes, and if there isn't enough space then shift it up.\n\nOther issues that have been noticed is that scrolling on the page dismisses the inline dialog. As per the ADG spec the inline dialog should be removed only on a click outside or by clicking a second time on the triggering element. (I don't think we are using a timeout to dismiss right now, but if we are lets not do that\u2026)",

In some instances, the exploitation scenario of this kind of bugs on servers is very improbable; for example, *one of these vulnerabilities can only be exploited against a server in the unlikely scenario that the server was allowed to process image files from an untrusted source*.\n\nNow we know we are doing improbable things every day.\n\nThe patch is already out - http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/security/javacpufeb2013-1841061.html but will be updated on 19th Feb.

Currently, if the archive is large and takes a while to unzip, the user sees the message \"Starting...\" for a long time, which can be unsettling. Even if no detailed progress of the unzipping status is shown, simply indicating that the file is being unzipped would have a soothing effect (at least on me).\n- Update the status when processing attachments. Currently, if there are many attachments, the user sees the message \"Entities loaded...\"  for a long time. Similarly to above, I think just indicating that attachments are being processed would be beneficial (as a user, I'd expect this step to take a while if I have many attachments).\n- Update the status during post-import tasks.

For example, if logged into Confluence as a user from Crowd, the Crowd user directory will not be able to be modified. Normally we recommend logging in as the local Confluence admin in order to edit other directories.\n\nHowever, when Crowd SSO is enabled, only users from the Crowd user directory can authenticate. To get around this, administrators will need to edit the seraph-config.xml to use the default Confluence authenticator instead of the Crowd SSO authenticator and restart Confluence in order to log in as the local admin. The application will require another restart to re-enable SSO.\n\nThis improvement request is to investigate if there's a better way to edit the Crowd user directory in Confluence when SSO is enabled.\n\nThe same is true of IIS with NTLM.",

The row will have the _local_ column set to 'T' indicating that it is not a group from LDAP.\n\nThis flag, when set to 'T', apparently keeps the LDAP group of the same name from syncing.\n\n# Shut down Confluence\n# Update the row such that the _local_ column is set to 'F'\n# Start Confluence, which will trigger a sync on startup\n\nPlease note the impact this will have on your user memberships:\n* Local users and groups are not affected\n* LDAP users in the local group will no longer have that membership relationship\n* LDAP users will now belong in the LDAP group of the same name",

[See the corresponding bug report|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFSERVER-28001].\n  {panel}\n\nBefore the last major update (months ago, from what I recall), the search box at the top right of the Confluence page would auto-search and display search results as I typed. We usually title our projects with a case number, followed by description.\n\nEver since that update, that search function hasn't been auto-searching for new cases. Old cases will still appear in the auto-search, but new ones created after that update no longer appear. Instead, the only way I can get to them is to browse through all the project or do a CTRL + F for the case number. I'm surprised this hasn't been fixed, it's been like this ofr months.\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1) From the dashboard, click \"Add Page\"\n2) Give the page whatever name you like and save it.\n3) Type the first few words or a unique word used in the page's title into the search box at the top right of the window.\n4) Notice that it doesn't show up in the auto-search results.\n5) Even if you hit <Enter> to submit the search, no results will be found.",
