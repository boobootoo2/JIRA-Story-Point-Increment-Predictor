Comments are left on random places in the page, and an author would have to scroll through the entire page to find them.  Emails can be sent, but we receive so many emails about so many things - that just isn't a realistic way to track things.  The author needs to have a way to positively confirm that he/she has addressed all comments.  In my mind, I'm envisioning something similar to Microsoft Word's \"Reviewing Pane\".\n\nIdeally, there would be some sort of comment listing.  At a minimum, this should be at a page level, but even better would be for a subset of pages or Space level.  I'm thinking subset of pages because we may have several different documents within a space, with different authors responsible for each.  The ability to select one parent item (document) within a space's page tree and see all comments in that area would be extremely useful to ensuring everything gets addressed.",

Summary\nCreating a user macro with text formatting in Confluence will not work if there is a multiple lines.\n\nh3. How to replicate:\n# Create a user macro like [noprint macro| https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Example+User+Macro+-+NoPrint] (in this example, I have created a redcolor macro)\n#* Define its Template as {code}## @noparams\n<div class=\"redcolor\">$body</div>{code}\n# Define its formatting in both (in this example, formatting is giving the font color red and a font size):\n#* PDF Export Stylesheet\n#* Space Stylesheet\n!Capture.PNG!\n# Call this user macro in a page as so:\n!Capture1.PNG!\n# Export this page to PDF\n\nh3. What is expected:\nPDF export is the same as displayed in Confluence page (because of the same formatting defined in Space stylesheet and PDF Export stylesheet)\n\nh3. What actually happens:\nOnly the user macro that contains 1 lines work. The one with multiple lines does not have formatting anymore:\n!Capture2.PNG!\n\nh3. Causes\nOne line text with the macro, will return the element:\n{code}\n<div class=\"redcolor\">one line</div>\n{code}\nAs you can see, the text \"one line\" is directly enclosed under the element with the class \"redcolor\"\n\nHowever if there are more than one line, the text will be enclosed in the <p> element. \n{code}\n<div class=\"redcolor\">\n<p>one line</p>\n<p>two line</p>\n</div>\n{code}\n\nSomehow, the pdf css is not apply to the element which are not directly enclosed in the element class. \n\nh3. What CSS formattings are affected:\ncolor\nfont-size\n\nh3. Workaround:\nAs a workaround, add the following code so <p> element diretly under the class will be affected by the css\n{code}\n.redcolor p\n{\ncolor:red\n}\n{code}\n\nYou will need to add two css in the pdf css so it will work for both of the scenario:\n!Capture3.PNG!",

Idea\nI think the way [Stack Exchange|http://stackexchange.com/] is handling its user comments is the best way from a user experience perspective. What Stack Exchange provides (and I am pretty sure every developer on this planet knows this) is a two-level comment functionality with a main comment on level 1 and any amount of sub comments to the given main comment on level 2. Level 0 is the question.\n\nh3. New Confluence feature\nIn Confluence, Level 0 is the Confluence page or blog post. Level 1 should be the main comment, level 1 the sub comments.\nIn addition, each confluence user should be able to sort the main comments by date decending or ascending. In this context please refer to [CONF-2587|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONF-2587]. The sorting should have no effect on the sub comments.\n\n*For ascending sort order.*\n>PAGE OR BLOG POST\n>> Main comment 1\n>>> Sub comment 1.1\n>>> Sub comment 1.2\n>>> ...\n>> Main comment 2\n>>> Sub comment 2.1\n>>> Sub comment 2.2\n>>> ...\n...\n\n*For descending sort order.*\n>PAGE OR BLOG POST\n>> Main comment 2\n>>> Sub comment 2.1\n>>> Sub comment 2.2\n>>> ...\n>> Main comment 1\n>>> Sub comment 1.1\n>>> Sub comment 1.2\n>>> ...\n...",

Problem Definition\nCurrently, if a user wants to be able to include a page from a space (Space A) with restrictions to a space (Space B) that doesn't have the same restrictions, only those users with permissions to Space A will see the content, all other users will see a message that the macro is unable to render.\n\nh3. Suggested Solution\nKnowing that too drastic of a change could cause security issues, maybe add the ability for a space or site admin to waive permission checks on a case by case basis in the macro itself (a toggle or checkbox should do the trick). \n\nh3. Workaround \nCopy the page into a space that has fewer restrictions, and then include that page. ",

This probably means that the javascript that render the page list failed when user toggle in between page list.\n\n*Notes:*\n\nThe problem appears when the table is larger than the browser viewport.\n\n*Workaround*\n\nMake sure the value of \"Number of items to display\" is higher than the total of page properties that it will returned. This workaround does not solve the issue in Confluence Cloud.",

It seems I can tag a page to a label or tag a question to a label, but can I do a search against labels that will return me both?  For example, can I search for the label \u201cExcel\u201d and \u201cBusiness Logic\u201d and get back all of the pages and questions that are tagged with either/both?\n2.\tCan I control who can make labels and who can\u2019t?  I want to enforce a certain amount of governance around this and don\u2019t want the labels to devolve into a hairball of everyone making up new labels like high school kids make up new hashtags.\n\nThanks,\nEmir",

Problem Definition\nConfluence Cloud and Server documentation spaces don't seem to be using the same naming conventions. For example, details of deleting attachments in Server are described under [Deleting an Attachment|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/CONF56/Deleting+an+Attachment], while the same topic for Cloud is covered under [Managing Files|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/ConfCloud/Managing+Files]. \n\nThis is a problem because:\n- it makes the Cloud documentation less searchable - the application itself uses the term \"attachments\" and that's what users are likely to search for;\n- it's confusing for users who switch between Cloud and Server and try to find out about the similar functionalities.\n\nh3. Suggested Solution\nUnify the naming conventions between the application and all documentation spaces.",
