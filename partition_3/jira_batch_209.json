      "description": "eWhen planning a sprint via a scrum board in planning mode, the time estimates on sub-tasks are not reflected in their parent issues, OR in the \"workload by assignee\" panel. This causes a lot of unnecessary additional overhead.\r\n\r\nWhen planning a sprint, we like to sketch out about a dozen top-level stories. We then create sub-tasks under those stories, which inherit things like the epic & sprint from their parent. Typically, we only assign estimates to sub-tasks. \r\n\r\nThis allows us to create stories that involve multiple participants, and it allows us to have a quick, high-level understanding of what's contained in a sprint and how everything relates to each other... after all, when there are (conceptually) less than a dozen things going on, it's easy to wrap your head around them.\r\n\r\nThat is the critical constraint: a story may have sub-tasks assigned to different people. For example, we might have a story with sub-tasks like so:\r\n\r\n* Revise internal API Foo (Story)\r\n** Plan API change (Bob, 8h)\r\n** API review & refinement meeting (Bob, 4h)\r\n** API review & refinement meeting (Sheila, 4h)\r\n** API review & refinement meeting (Sam, 4h)\r\n** Update API implementation Bar (Sheila, 16h)\r\n** Update client libraries (Sam, 12h)\r\n\r\nThere is absolutely no way that a top-level estimate on that story is meaningful on its own. It can be useful as a measure of person-hours, but only if that estimate is directly derived from the issue's sub-tasks, and only if the estimates are correctly reflected in each assignee's workload.\r\n\r\nWe've tried totaling up the hours in the sub-tasks and just hacking them into the top-level issues during planning, but that's terrible: it's a total hassle, and it doesn't work for multiple assignees without reorganizing our issues in totally distorted ways to accommodate the tool rather than our team.\r\n\r\nThe best solution we've found so far is to put together a dashboard with Workload Pie gadgets. That's sort of okay, but it requires us to continually switch away from the scrum board during our planning meetings, so it's still sub-optimal.\r\n\r\nI don't know if this behavior is a design decision or simply a bug, but it's causing us a lot of headache. Please fix it. Thanks!",

      "description": "h3. Problem Definition\r\n\r\nWhen using Epics as a Swimlane, if the Epics are from a different project (one that is not covered in the filter of the board), any tasks under that Epic will not show up in the board, even if the task rightfully belong to that board. For example :\r\n\r\n* Given Project A and Project B\r\n* Project A has a Rapid board with a filter that only shows issues in Project A\r\n* Project B has an Epic, called Epic B\r\n* Task A from Project A is linked to Epic B via Epic Link\r\n* In the Rapid board, the swimlanes are configured to be based on Epics\r\n* Even though Task A shows up in the board (in the backlog), it does not show in the Sprint due to the Swimlane settings (and due Epic B being from another project)\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nAlthough it has been explained in [GHS-7286|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/GHS-7286] that it is an expected behavior that the Epic tag is missing in the backlog, it gets more complex in this case as the Task itself is not showing up in the board at all. This should be handled better, perhaps by adding a section called 'External Epics' when viewing the Sprint.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, this can be avoided if the 'Epic Link' field is limited to only show Epics from the selected project, as per - [GHS-12016|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/GHS-12016]\r\n \r\nh3. Workaround \r\nFor now, the only workaround would be to not configure Epics as the Swimlane",

(*Even though this new board doesn't show it at first*)\r\n\r\nThe above scenario is one example of how JIRA Agile is taking into account Future Sprints that are configured in the Sprint field of Epic issue types. \r\n\r\nThis causes unexpected behaviour because that \"incomplete\" Future Sprint is not deleted together with the board when the board's filter is deleted. That Future Sprint then appears unexpectedly on the new board when a sprint on that board is closed. \r\nAnother way for this to happen is when a user manually includes a Future Sprint into the Epic. \r\n\r\n*Workaround*\r\n# Do not configure any Sprints for epics, since epics usually span several sprints anyway.

Expected behavior:\r\nBeing possible to edit any date through the \"Backlog\" view, regardless of manually editing the field or selecting the date in the calendar picker.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual behavior:\r\nField leaves the \"Inline Editing\" mode whenever you open the calendar picker or click on any part of the date to have it changed.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce:\r\n# Create a version in an Agile-enabled project;\r\n# Open the \"Backlog\" view on the project's Board;\r\n# Expand the \"Versions\" sidebar;\r\n# Try to edit any date on the version;\r\n#* Calendar picker\r\n### Opens the pop-up;\r\n### You can select the date, but the field isn't in \"Inline Editing\" mode anymore, therefore no changes are saved;\r\n#* Editing the field itself \r\n### When clicking on any part of the date to edit, the field leaves \"Inline Editing\" mode, therefore not making it possible to modify;\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround:\r\n\r\nh4. #1\r\nEdit versions' dates through the \"Versions\" panel inside the \"Project Administration\" page.\r\n\r\nh4. #2\r\n# Activate \"Inline Editing\" by clicking the date;\r\n# Use \"Delete\" to erase all the date;\r\n# Type in a new date;",

To coninue dragging above the top of the items currently displayed, you must move the mouse upwards until it is above the top of the backlog <div> top of the backlog (e.g. over the search area) \r\n* stop moving the mouse\r\n\r\nExpected: drag continues as long as the mouse position is above the drag area\r\nActual: drag stops until I wiggle the mouse, then drag continues. I assume JIRA is using a mousemove event to trigger dragging, but if there's no mousemove even then dragging stops. \r\n\r\nThis bug means that the only way to drag an issue a long distance through a long backlog is to keep wiggling the mouse back and forth above or below the backlog <div> while you wait, and wait, and wait for 10+ seconds until the dragged issue gets to where you want it to be.  \r\n\r\nThis makes it incredibly frustrating and time-wasting to groom a large backlog. Ever tried wiggling your mouse for 10 seconds at a time and then doing it again and again for 200 tasks while doing a big backlog-prioritization exercise?
