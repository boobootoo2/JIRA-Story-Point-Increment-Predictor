Atlassian Connect 1.0 [was released in March 2014|http://blogs.atlassian.com/2014/03/introducing-atlassian-connect-1-0/], and you can already get access to [more than 50 public add-ons today built using the platform|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/search?application=&category=&cost=&hosting=cloud&marketingLabel=].\r\n \r\nDue to stability and scalability reasons, we will not bundle additional third party add-ons with our Cloud offerings. But you should feel free to contact the vendors of your favourite add-ons to let them know that you would like them to create a Cloud version of the add-on! We will do our best to work together with the vendor to satisfy this request.\r\n \r\nSince we have no plans to bundle additional add-ons in Cloud, we are closing this issue.\r\n \r\nCheers,\r\nBartek\r\nJIRA Product Management\r\nbartek (at) atlassian (dot) com\r\n{panel}\r\n \r\n \r\n*Original request description:*\r\nUsers wish to use the navitabs plugin in their OnDemand hosted environment.\r\n\r\nhttps://plugins.atlassian.com/plugin/details/28632",

Because of [CWD-2752 |https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CWD-2752] this means that when developing a Mac logging into JIRA would not create a SSO token that could also log into the other applications. Mac will use IPv6 for localhost and for some reason reports the local address as ::1%0.\n\nTo work around this for the time being I am going to tell all the apps to use IPv4 in preference to IPv6 by adding -Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true. Unicorn uses IPv4 so this should not be a problem. \n\nWe can remove this hack once all the applications go to or past Crowd Embedded 2.3.5 or Crowd Integration Client 2.3.5.\n\nREF: https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CWD-2752",

      "description": "Hi Atlassian\n\nHave an idea on overall OnDemand admin dashboard organisation. Current OnDemand administration dashboard for an experienced JIRA user looks messed up, ([more details|https://support.atlassian.com/browse/JST-28764]), however I see reasons why it was done this way. But also I see a way to solve this better. \n\nRight now OnDemand admin dashboard is really a merged JIRA, Confluence and other systems dashboards under a set of tabs like *General*, *Issues*, *Wiki*, *Source*. And inside each tab all administration blocks and pages that were nicely structured in the original JIRA system are merged into one big an not effective list. For example having \"User Interface\" under \"Issues\" tab is quite unobvious an if I wouldn't know the original JIRA system well - it would give me hard times to find it.\nAlso notice that all tabs inside the administration completely match the tabs in the top of the page, *Issues*, *Wiki*, *Source*, *Reviews* are also there (except for *General* but it's not a problem).\nSo, the solution is - to implement a similar \"Administration mode\" in the OnDemand as it is in JIRA, when these main tabs will act as switching between the administration parts instead of system parts itself. And a link to \"exit administration\" as it is in JIRA. And below these main tabs you could place usual JIRA and other systems dashboards tabs in same way and structure as it is in standalone JIRA. This way you will both keep the interface consistency between standalone and merged systems and also eliminate need to maintain another completely different interface. \n\nPlease let me know if there is any discussion thread or more details on it elsewhere, I'd like to get more involved.\n\n\nAlex.",

Atlassian Connect 1.0 [was released in March 2014|http://blogs.atlassian.com/2014/03/introducing-atlassian-connect-1-0/], and you can already get access to [more than 50 public add-ons today built using the platform|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/search?application=&category=&cost=&hosting=cloud&marketingLabel=].\r\n \r\nDue to stability and scalability reasons, we will not bundle additional third party add-ons with our Cloud offerings. But you should feel free to contact the vendors of your favourite add-ons to let them know that you would like them to create a Cloud version of the add-on! We will do our best to work together with the vendor to satisfy this request.\r\n \r\nSince we have no plans to bundle additional add-ons in Cloud, we are closing this issue.\r\n \r\nCheers,\r\nBartek\r\nJIRA Product Management\r\nbartek (at) atlassian (dot) com\r\n{panel}\r\n \r\n \r\n*Original request description:*\r\nWe would like to see the following features provided by the jira-enhancer-plugin on the OnDemand platform\r\n\r\nCustom fields of Resolution Date, Resolution User, Closing Date, Closing User, Reopening Counter and Reopening History, Last Reopening Date, Last Reopening User, Issue tab panel of Reopening Histories, Report of User or group histories\r\n",

Atlassian Connect 1.0 [was released in March 2014|http://blogs.atlassian.com/2014/03/introducing-atlassian-connect-1-0/], and you can already get access to [more than 50 public add-ons today built using the platform|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/search?application=&category=&cost=&hosting=cloud&marketingLabel=].\r\n \r\nDue to stability and scalability reasons, we will not bundle additional third party add-ons with our Cloud offerings. But you should feel free to contact the vendors of your favourite add-ons to let them know that you would like them to create a Cloud version of the add-on! We will do our best to work together with the vendor to satisfy this request.\r\n \r\nSince we have no plans to bundle additional add-ons in Cloud, we are closing this issue.\r\n \r\nCheers,\r\nBartek\r\nJIRA Product Management\r\nbartek (at) atlassian (dot) com\r\n{panel}\r\n \r\n \r\n*Original request description:*\r\nI have searched [https://studio.atlassian.com] for this plug-in request so that I can vote on it (as outlined in [http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRASTUDIO/Third-Party+Plugin+Process]) and have been unsuccessful in finding a current issue/request.  \r\n\r\nThere seems to be an existing plug-in already developed [https://plugins.atlassian.com/plugin/details/226] and this is a request to add this to the plug-ins installed onto Jira Studio.",

Atlassian Connect 1.0 [was released in March 2014|http://blogs.atlassian.com/2014/03/introducing-atlassian-connect-1-0/], and you can already get access to [more than 50 public add-ons today built using the platform|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/search?application=&category=&cost=&hosting=cloud&marketingLabel=].\r\n \r\nDue to stability and scalability reasons, we will not bundle additional third party add-ons with our Cloud offerings. But you should feel free to contact the vendors of your favourite add-ons to let them know that you would like them to create a Cloud version of the add-on! We will do our best to work together with the vendor to satisfy this request.\r\n \r\nSince we have no plans to bundle additional add-ons in Cloud, we are closing this issue.\r\n \r\nCheers,\r\nBartek\r\nJIRA Product Management\r\nbartek (at) atlassian (dot) com\r\n{panel}\r\n \r\n \r\n*Original request description:*\r\nA request to bundle the Confluence Checklists Plugin: https://studio.plugins.atlassian.com/wiki/display/CHK/Confluence+Checklists+Plugin",

I know from [this issue|https://studio.atlassian.com/browse/AOD-2496], there are security concerns with the plugin, so I suppose the focus of this feature request is to for the development team to mitigate the XSS attack vector. \n\nI envision a solution that would involve server-side code to filter out the User-HTML-Block whenever a page is viewed by users with elevated privileged. I don't know a whole lot about XSS attacks, but is it not the case that the malicious JavaScript must be executed client-side for the attack to work? If the User-HTML is filtered out, then the JavaScript can't execute. \n\nUltimately, I want to use Custom HTML to include JavaScript snippets from various web services like DISQUS & Google Analytics, and the HTML macro for including raw HTML.\n\nI suppose an alternative solution would be a series of plugins & macros similar to the Widget macro that would render predefined JavaScript snippets. That does solve my raw HTML issue.",

      "description": "See https://support.atlassian.com/browse/JST-27116.\n\nAlthough the SVN importer runs the actual import of an svn repo outside of Java (and thus uses mainly native memory for this), after the repository has been staged, the importer checks that the repository structure matches the expected structure (1 directory for each project, and a trunk/tags/branches path structure for each project). To do this check, the importer gets a full repository file listing by executing \"svnlook tree <path to repo>\" and reading this into memory.\n\nIf the list returned by \"svnlook tree <path to repo>\" is extremely large (only happened to one customer so far with Xmx=512m), jira will OOM. \n\nUnfortunately, there is no easy way to limit the depth of the results returned by \"svnlook tree\" or the equivalent \"svn list\". We only need the depth to two levels to do the checks that we need to do (in DoesRepoMatchProjectStructure.java), but at present we are reading in the whole repository list in order to do so.\n\nIf more customers run into this problem, we can modify the DoesRepoMatchProjectStructure class to:\n  1. run \"svnlook tree <path to repo> -R --depth immediates\" to get the first level directories. Check that each of these exactly match the list of projects.\n  2. in each of the project directories, run \"svnlook tree <path to repo> -R --depth immediates\" and ensure that they have the \"trunk\", \"branches\" and \"tags\" directories.\n\nThis is definitely a bit cumbersome, and may be a bit slower, but it will avoid reading the whole repository list into memory.",
