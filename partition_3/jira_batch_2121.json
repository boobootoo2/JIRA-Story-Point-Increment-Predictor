While a space has no CSS itself, it will use the system-wide CSS. Fine.  \nThough, many space administrators in our Confluence system wanted small CSS additions for their space which did not make sense to include into the system-wide CSS.\nThe current implementation of the CSS requires (at least up to 5.4) to copy the whole system-wide CSS to the space, and then add the additional space-specific customizations.\n\nSuggestions:\n1. I would prefer if the space-specific CSS would simply overwrite (merge with) the system-wide CSS, so we don't need to repeat them in each space. The pages should first read the system CSS, then the space CSS, then apply the combined content to the pages. This would eliminate a lot of redundant content in the space CSS'.\n2. When upgrading from one Confluence release to another, frequently the spelling of CSS has changed. In case they are used in (potentially many) space CSS, all of these CSS need to be updated. In installations with many spaces, this can become a huge amount of work. So I'm looking for an administration tool which allows to add/delete/replace blocks of CSS to all space CSS where certain conditions are met (e..g. the existence of a certain CSS key which has been obsoleted or modified)",

It might be better to do some of these queries separately as they will be PK or index lookups and given the results adapt the remaining query that needs to be done.  This seems slower but if each individual query takes say 1ms then you get a gain of 1500x compared to the current behaviour.\n\n{panel}",

So far reindexing has been going for 3 days and is about 60% of the way through!\n\n*Although you can specify a \"batch size\" for indexing, still each item that is indexed seems to require its own queries to the database.* This results on a much higher load on the database server than is required.\n\nFor example, instead of doing a single query per item that requires indexing, you could fetch batches of data from the database in a single query for 100 items that need to be indexed, reducing the load on the database by 100 and significantly increasing the speed of indexing.\n\nThis really needs to be worked on to boost the time taken for large reindexing tasks (full reindex or where large sets of restricted pages have had permissions modified).\n{quote}",

Thread dumps, GC logs, SQL logging, access logging, etc. Confluence has very minimal logging enabled by default (out of that list only GC logging is enabled by default), and for good reason as log files would greatly increase their included content if all logging options were enabled (as most logging is done in atlassian-confluence.log). Some logging, for example SQL logging, is useless unless configuration files are change and Confluence is restarted (which is a huge inconvenience)\n\nFurther, to gather these logs requires generating a support zip through the Support Tools Plugin in the Confluence admin console (which does not always include the additional GC logging). This process is impossible to perform if Confluence cannot start, and makes gathering necessary information (i.e. configuration files in addition to logs) difficult for support and for the user.\n\nh4. Proposed Solution\n# Add the ability to create a support zip from the command line\n** Accomplished via a script that gathers the same/similar information as a standard support zip\n# Improve SQL logging when enabled from the UI\n** Include trace logging to get the parameters being passed to the query\n** Split this additional logging into its own .log file\n# Fix (or remove) the thread dumps generated via the Confluence UI\n** Currently Confluence does not generate full system thread dumps, and every time a thread dump is needed this article is linked: [Generating Thread Dumps Externally|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Generating+a+Thread+Dump+Externally]\n** Either get the same information as an external thread dump or remove the feature entirely as it is not used by support\n# Enable access logging by default and separate into its own .log file\n** JIRA has this logging enabled by default",

My point is to somehow connect user group with space and then show personalized search results.\n\ne.x.: There is a space `managers` and similar user group `managers`. When user belonging to `managers` group wants to search `duties` first results should be always from `managers` space because results from `leaders` space will be irrelevant for `managers`. Ofc, assuming that both spaces have some contents about `duties`.\n\nThis feature would be extremely useful and effective to work and manage information in Confluence. ",
