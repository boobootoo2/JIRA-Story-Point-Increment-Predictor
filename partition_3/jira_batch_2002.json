The mechanism should work similarly to searching for (and linking to) a page so that when a page is renamed or an anchor is renamed, it will automatically link to all pages using that anchor.\r\n\r\nOne idea is to reuse the Inser Link > Search function so it works for anchors.\r\n * On the Insert Link modal, add a new section called \"Anchors\"\r\n * Reuse Insert Link > Search functionality to allow people to find the correct page.\r\n * On the bottom of modal, change the \"Link Location\" breadcrumbs to \"Page Selected\"\r\n * Add a dropdown that dynamically populates all anchors on the selected page.\r\n * Keep \"Link text\"\r\n\r\nThis way, people can select the correct anchors without copying/pasting them and (especially) trying to figure out how to use anchors on other pages.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n!image-2019-08-03-16-39-04-733.png!",

When tapping the links created by the Table of Contents macro, or, a link pointing to an anchor, if the page has the percent character (%), the page will break with a \"URI malformed\" message.\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Create a new page and make sure to put the percent character on its title (For example, \"Test %\").\r\n # On the page, make sure to add some headers and the Table of Contents macro (so it will create the links to the headers). For the anchor macro, manually create a link pointing to the anchor on the page (or a different one using the percent character).\r\n # Click on the generated links in order to access a specific part of the page (or a different one for the anchor's scenario)\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nThe link should redirect the user to the correct header on the mentioned page, or a different one.\r\nh3.

      "description": "h3. Problem Definition\r\nUsing the Confluence Cloud app for mobile devices, it's not possible to sign into more than one Confluence Cloud site. \r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\nProvide an ability to switch between Cloud instances on the same device. Ideally, this would work by showing all Cloud instances that are associated with the user's Atlassian ID, and there would also be a way to use an account switcher (in the event that the user has more than one Atlassian ID across their Cloud instances.)\r\n\r\nh3. Why this is important\r\nMany of our users use multiple instances of Confluence and each time they'd have to log out and back in if they need to switch instances on their device.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\nIt's currently possible to log out and then back in with your Atlassian ID, where you will be met with a list of sites tied to your Atlassian ID. But it appears there is no way to get back to this screen again after you have selected your site, in case you want to switch sites.\r\n\r\n !Screenshot 2019-07-31 at 14.55.14.png|thumbnail! ",
