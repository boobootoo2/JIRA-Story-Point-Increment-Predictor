As [Bitbucket Server|https://docs.atlassian.com/bitbucket-server/javadoc/7.6.0/api/com/atlassian/bitbucket/repository/Repository.html]\u00a0guarantees the repository name to be unique per project, this constraint impedes the server-to-cloud migration.\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nAllow the users to maintain the uniqueness of repository names per project.\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nNone.

Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Bitbucket Issues seem to be using a Markdown parser.\r\n # When making a commit, add a commit message. When it comes in the commit message screen, the syntax is normal, but if this is lined to an issue, the commit message that comes up in a comments section loses its syntax.\r\n\r\nThe syntax is only maintained if \r\n 1. The users explicitly uses the markdown syntax (if making the changes in the Bitbucket UI commit messages)\r\n 2. If using CLI, pressing Return/Enter twice will generate a new line (in a VI editor)\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nWhen the commit message in the commit screen of the Bitbucket UI shows the Line breaks, then the same should be applicable to the Issues section of Bitbucket UI as well, specifically the comments under the issue.\r\n The issue screen should look similar to the commits screen as below;\r\n\r\n!image-2019-12-03-16-13-47-221.png!\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nThe line breaks are lost in the comments on issues, and hence the information looks jumbled.\r\n !image-2019-12-03-16-14-01-592.png!\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nA workaround is available if the merge is done manually;\r\n \"In Markdown syntax, you need to end a line with 2 spaces for the next line to be registered, for example, here I have two spaces at the end of each line.\r\n If you put the message in a CLI locally, then press enter twice at the end of the line to indicate a line break.\"\r\n\r\n*BUT, this workaround will not work in an environment where merge commits are automater or one where the user does not have control over the formatting of commit. Re-formatting already pushed commit messages and force-pushing them again would create a lot of problems for the users who have already pulled the commits and commited on top of them.*\u00a0\r\n\r\nThere is a feature request in place already to get this up and running, but some immediate workaround is necessary for the customer till the feature request is implemented, Hence raising this as a bug request.\r\n\r\nKindly Assist\r\n Regards\r\n Manu Abraham",
