Summary\n\nWhen using the Page Properties Report macro will not show results if used with a Page Properties macro that has a Page Properties ID that begins with zero (0)\n\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\n\n# Create a page in Confluence and add the *Page Properties* macro\n# Add a table (at least 2 columns) inside the macro (remove the header row and add data in each section of the table)\n# Edit the *Page Properties* macro to add a Page properties ID that begins with \u20180\u2019 (ex. 007)\n# Add a label to the page and save the page\n# Create another page and add the *Page Properties Report* macro\n#* Enter the label from the previous page in the Label section\n#* Expand the *Options* section and enter the Page properties ID from the other page that begins with \u20180\u2019\n#* Save the page\n\nh3. Expected Results\n\nWe would expect that the information from the page properties macro would generate in the page properties report macro.  We can even see the correct information in the preview of the Page Properties Report Macro, but it does not render once saved.\n\nh3. Actual Results\nNo information renders and a message 'No Content Found' is displayed\n \nh3. Notes\nThis issue appears to have began in version 5.8.16.  This was working in Confluence 5.8.5 and 5.8.15.  This is not working in 5.8.16, 5.8.17,5.9.1,5.9.4\n",

Notes\n- Perhaps was as of an update of WebDAV launcher 1.1.0\n- Attempted the same with Open Office, but still receive an error\n- One user has mentioned they can still use the feature but get the error.\n\nh3.Workaround\n- Browsers besides FireFox work fine\n- Partial Workaround:\n-- Edit the WebDav Launcher option within Firefox Extensions and delete the Application Path\n-- This seems to allow the Office Doc to open, but not for subsequent edits. \n\nNote:\n\nThis fix for this issue is released in Confluence 5.9.7.

[See the corresponding bug report|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFSERVER-40621].\n  {panel}\n\nHi guys. \n\nI hope this is the correct project to raise this issue. I was going to raise it against Connect, but that's on EAN and I don't have access right now. Please feel free to move it if required.\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n\n# Create a connect add-on listening to the \"page_updated\" webhook event.\n# Create a page which contains a link to another page.\n# Delete the page containing the link.\n# Edit and rename the other page (which was linked to by the now-deleted page)\n\n*bug* A webhook page_updated event is fired for the deleted page. Whilst this may seem useful, it just causes confusion as requesting the URI for the page returns a 404. \n\nCheers.\n\n~Dave",

If this is deemed a good suggestion could I ask that it's implemented for Jira Cloud.\nHopefully that's clear, cheers and good work!\n- A",

They are supposed to follow the standard for google-docs: \u2318+Shift+8 for bulleted lists and \u2318+Shift+7 for numbered lists. The standard for MS Word bulleted and numbered lists would also be acceptable. Making up your own shortcut keys would only be tolerated if you also provide a way to create new or edit the shortcut keys.\n\nThe source of the problem is the spec which is accurately represented in the documentation. To reproduce the issue you need only try \u2318+Shift+N with a modern browser (like Chrome) to see that this particular shortcut is useless (since that shortcut key is reserved for opening a new private browsing window).",

So that he/she sees that I've added a page or that I wanted him to know about this (and future information) \n\nTherefore it would come in handy that in Edit-modus, you can add a watcher, so when you save the page, the colleague gets informed instantly.\n\nI think it's the best place to add it next to the icons from label/restriction. I think an extra icon, in green or someting, would definately be clear to see. \n\nHope you can have a look into this :)",

Summary\n\nWhen viewing a \u2018Space List\u2019 macro with \u2019Space Scope\u2019 in \u2018Categories\u2019, switching categories is not updating the space lists, always showing the spaces for the first selected category.\n\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\n# Create 2 spaces (say \u2018Space A\u2019 and \u2018Space B\u2019)\n# Add two _different_ categories for each space (Say category \u2018A\u2019 for \u2018Space A\u2019 and \u2018B\u2019 for \u2018Space B)\n#* Also, make sure these spaces only belong to one of these categories\n# Create a page with a \u2018Space List\u2019 macro\n#* When adding the macro, select \u2018category\u2019 in \u2019Scope of spaces\u2019, leave the rest as default\n# Save the page and open it\n# In \u2018View Spaces With Categories\u2019 switch from category \u2018A\u2019 to \u2018B\u2019.\n\nh3. Expected Results\nThe listed spaces should be updated to the ones using category \u2018B\u2019. In this case, \u2018Space A\u2019 should disappear and \u2018Space B\u2019 be shown.\n\nh3.

In case of future macro, since it loads asynchronously, binding occurs multiple times for the expand control which loads first.\n\n*Proposed Fix:*\nConfluence expand macro shall unbound all events before binding to events, so that events already bound to elements will be cleared.
