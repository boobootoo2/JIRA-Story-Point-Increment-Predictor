For a period, we attempted to relax this policy and enabled some plugins to be installable on request.  However, relaxing our plugin policy resulted in a lot of issues, such that the last JIRA Studio upgrade required an additional maintenance period specifically to resolve plugin-related issues.\n\nWe are taking a very aggressive approach to remedying this situation in the next two upcoming releases. First off, we are working to pre-bundle a large set of plugins to ensure that the 95% most popular plugins are already installed and tested. Second, we will be adding a Plugin Manager so you can enable and configure plugins that meet your needs.\n\nIn the meantime, you'll need to raise an improvement request for specific plugins in the JIRA Studio project on http://studio.atlassian.com.\n{quote}\n\nSo, I'm asking if someone can enable the calendar & Gantt plugins (or set it up as a gadget, I don't really mind either way), so can get access to this functionality in our Jira Studio instance?\n\nI'm a big fan of Jira and have installed it in two previous companies.  This time (3rd time) I decided to try Jira Studio, however I'm shocked to see that I can't use these two useful plugins.  This could be a deal-breaker for us, since we have a huge project ($$$) and I just convinced the project manager to use jira because IT HAS THESE TWO PLUGINS.  If I can't get this to happen, it's going to be a real black-mark on the face of me and Jira as a useful project management tool.\n\nPlease help!\n\n",

Atlassian Connect 1.0 [was released in March 2014|http://blogs.atlassian.com/2014/03/introducing-atlassian-connect-1-0/], and you can already get access to [more than 50 public add-ons today built using the platform|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/search?application=&category=&cost=&hosting=cloud&marketingLabel=].\r\n \r\nDue to stability and scalability reasons, we will not bundle additional third party add-ons with our Cloud offerings. But you should feel free to contact the vendors of your favourite add-ons to let them know that you would like them to create a Cloud version of the add-on! We will do our best to work together with the vendor to satisfy this request.\r\n \r\nSince we have no plans to bundle additional add-ons in Cloud, we are closing this issue.\r\n \r\nCheers,\r\nBartek\r\nJIRA Product Management\r\nbartek (at) atlassian (dot) com\r\n{panel}\r\n \r\n \r\n*Original request description:*\r\nCustomer has requested installation of these 2 plugins:\r\n\r\n* [Bamboo Artifactory Plugin|http://wiki.jfrog.org/confluence/display/RTF/Bamboo+Artifactory+Plug-in]\r\n* [Bamboo Sonar Plugin|http://docs.marvelution.com/display/MARVBAMBOOSONAR/Documentation+Home]\r\n",

This also ensures that their subtasks have hours logged against them (that are rolled up into the story totals).
