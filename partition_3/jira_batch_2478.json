Update / 2016-01-29 / @benechols\nWe&#x27;re working on an update that will allow you to sort by last modified and generally make the dashboard more flexible. I&#x27;ll post updates here as I have them.\n\nh3. Update / 2016-02-25 / @benechols\nToday we shipped an update to the dashboard that restores the last updated column, and allows you to sort by any column you want. Your preference will be saved, so you won&#x27;t have to re-sort whenever you return to the page. For more details, check out the blog post. Happy coding!",

Call this a \"proxy account,\" since this \"team\" will have only one member, and exists only to provide functionality to formerly-user repos.\n# User must [manually transfer|BCLOUD-12167] each of their repos from their own/user account to their proxy/team account. Note that users who are most likely to be interested in Projects are users with ... wait for it ... lots of repos.\n# Once a repo is transferred from a user account to her/his proxy/team account, the user effectively has [2 identities|BCLOUD-2323]: \"if [OP] follows a link to my user [account] (like the [ones in Issue comments]) they [won&#x27;t] see my repositories. [OP] would have to know to look under [my user account>Teams].\" If the user also belongs to real/non-proxy teams, the OP will need to \"figure out which team I am using as a user-specific team.\"\n# Transferring a repo from user to team [requires changing the repo URI|https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/change-or-transfer-repository-ownership-289964397.html], which means the user must [change any links to the repo in any documentation|BCLOUD-2323]. This is a _huge_ hit for users who document their code for OP, and the hurt scales with number of repos to transfer.\n\nHence I request that Projects (repo folders) be made available for user accounts (not just team accounts), thus obviating the need to transfer repos to purely-proxy teams.\n\nh3. 2016-01-23 edit by @dbennett\nI&#x27;m going to remove labels from the description and title. We&#x27;ve already had problems mingling the two features on the initial request and there&#x27;s no need for a pro-active complaint about something that&#x27;s not even in design. For those interested in labels take a look at issue BCLOUD-11800 and comment / vote there if you&#x27;d like to influence the direction.",
