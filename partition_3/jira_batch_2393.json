      "description": "h3. Issue Summary\r\nThe problem here is with the target branch search in the Pull Requests page.\r\n\r\nBasically, if you have more than 10 branches that match a pattern, the search will not bring up the branch you are looking for if the name of the branch *is* the pattern itself. \r\nSay you have 15 branches under the staging/* pattern, and one branch simply named staging - Staging will, in some cases, never show up in the target branch search in the PR page.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Create 11 or more branches with a given pattern in its name \r\n # It will not show up in the target branch search, and can never be searched for in the target branch search. This seems to happen only in specific cases though, and at the time of writing, we are unable to identify what causes the branch to not show up only for specific users.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nThe branch will always show as the first result of the target branch search, as it matches the pattern completely\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nThe branch cannot be searched for in the target branch search.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n Currently there is no known workaround for this behavior. A workaround will be added here when available",
