A solution that would be suitable for us, and hopefully for others, would be to offer a burndown chart, which shows under the existing curve a stacked area coloured according to the states of the non-completed issues. One would just have to be able to define a colour for each state in the board configuration and then Jira agile could do the rest. Essentially this amounts to a fusion of a cumulative flow diagram with a burndown chart as shown here using the example created by Steve Lane (three states, A, B and C, and 4 issues with 2, 7, 5 and 3 story points respectfully, progressing through the states from A to Done):\r\n\r\n!char_proposal2.png!\r\n\r\nOriginal request was:\r\n\r\n{noformat}\r\nFollowing from issues GHS-4136 and GHS-4139, I would like to request a variant of the same thing, which hopefully won't be rejected as well :-)\r\nWe would also like to support the burndown of story points but without either linking to real time or editing the story point field. A solution that would be suitable for us, and hopefully sufficiently flexible for others, would be to define partial burndown percentages for the intermediate columns. E.g. one could define an intermediate state/column \"development complete - in testing\" and associate the column with 70% burndown (with \"complete\" in the final column for the usual 100%). This wouldn't be 100% correct but at least more accurate and reflect some progress. If one could define the burndown % for any intermediate column in such a way in the board configuration then users could define as many partial burndown states as they wish for the granularity they seek. Clearly the result is that the burndown chart (and respective reports) would apply the respective partial burndown of the issues' SP as they progress through the different intermediate states.\r\n{noformat}",

There are two statuses mapped to each of the middle for columns (e.g. Ready for Analysis and In Analysis, Ready for Development and In Development, etc.). I am showing the status on the card layout to eliminate ambiguity. But I can't move the card from \"Ready for Analysis\" to \"In Analysis\" with drag and drop.

I could not see any way to setting an issue to a delivered state for the issue owner to either accept of reject.\r\n\r\nThe second point is about the estimation. I understand that user stories use a points based estimation and other issues use a time based estimation. But I would have preferred to have the option to use a points based estimation on issues.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nDeepam Trivedi\r\n\r\n*Reporter*: Deepam Trivedi\r\n*E-mail*: [mailto:deepam@dialoguebydesign.co.uk]",

      "description": "Personally, I love JIRA Agile. However, we also have some projects within our organization that use Pivotal Tracker, and many employees prefer Pivotal Tracker to JIRA Agile. Here are some things that I have heard Pivotal Tracker does better than JIRA Agile, that I think might get more people (at least within our organization) to use JIRA Agile:\r\n\r\n* Separation of backlog vs. icebox. Having everything in the backlog makes it difficult to maintain. Having a concept of an Icebox (features that you don't know are a \"go\" yet) is a major plus. You *can* configure JIRA Agile to use filters to separate out backlog vs. icebox (perhaps using labels), but it is more difficult than it should be. Backlog and icebox tickets should be a built-in concept, rather than something you have to configure to get working right, and then train users to use correctly.\r\n* Velocity calculation: It is not obvious what the velocity for the project is, and the way that velocity is calculated is not very configurable. The velocity for the project should be right in front of everyone on both the planning and current sprint boards. It wouldn't hurt to have a way for you to see more details on the calculation of the velocity, either.\r\n* Future sprint planning. Pivotal Tracker automatically organizes all tickets in the backlog into sprints for you. You can easily drag-and-drop issues in and out of sprints, but PT doesn't force you to manually create each sprint, it just automatically calculates the next several sprints based on the velocity projected for the project. This is a BIG deal in my mind (being a JIRA agile fan) as well.\r\n* Team member strength in velocity calculation is also a big deal. For us, the teams change regularly, and having a way of indicating that we are not at 100% capacity in team strength, and having that affect the velocity projection is really useful.\r\n* Because JIRA supports customizable fields, I think it would be imortant to have a more advanced configuration screen for the boards to allow the admin of a JIRA project to configure the fields that are shown in the issue lines and the issue details screens. Also, all fields that are on the issue details screen should be editable within JIRA Agile. Having to swap from the JIRA Agile screen to the native JIRA edit screen is *not* intuitive.\r\n\r\nThat's all I am aware of for now. I hope these suggestions help make JIRA Agile even better. I would love to continue using it.. But, being one of the only ones, I'm fearful I may not be able to forever unless some of these suggestions are addressed.",

[See the corresponding bug report|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSWCLOUD-11568].\n  {panel}\n\nh4. Summary:\r\nOn the *Plan mode* (Scrum board), under a sprint, there is a \"create issue\" button which will create issue to that particular sprint. The problem happens when there is a required field for issue creation. It will prompt create issue dialog box to enter the required filled, and this steps removes the value of \"Sprint field\" which previously has been assigned.\r\n\r\nh4. Steps to reproduce:\r\n# Go to *JIRA Agile plan mode*\r\n# Refer to the inactive sprint\r\n# Refer to *create issue* option on the bottom of that particular sprint\r\n# Enter the issue summary (sprint is automatically assigned to the particular sprint)\r\n!step1.png|thumbnail!\r\n# Click on \"create issue\" button under that particular sprint\r\n# It will prompt the \"create issue\" dialog to enter the values for required fields\r\n# The value of sprint becomes NULL (empty)\r\n!step2.png|thumbnail!\r\n# This causes the issue to be created in backlog\r\n!step3.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nh4. Expected Behavior\r\nThe value of *Sprint* field should not get removed when it prompts the create issue dialog box\r\n\r\nh4. Additional Information\r\n- Occurs in JIRA 6.3.9 with JIRA Agile 6.6.13\r\n- This does not occur if there is no required field (which will not prompt create issue dialog box\r\n\r\nh4. Workaround\r\nThe workaround would be to reenter the sprint value when the create issue dialog box is being prompted.",

      "description": "I am using Jira on Demand. I tried to bulk edit the sprint (move issues from sprint A to B). I entered the NAME of the sprint in the field shown in the bulk edit dialog. The system crashed with the exception shown below. I later tried it again and entered the sprint id - this worked (and made me very happy ;-)). \r\n\r\nSo actually I see two issues:\r\na) the system should not crash hard, but throw an error message, that my user input is not valid\r\nb) the ui should give me some hint that I may NOT enter the sprint name in this dialog (As far as I can see this is not consistent through the software).\r\n\r\nAn error occurred whilst rendering this message.

It is thus also impossible to drag the parent issue from one column/swimlane to another like we can do with simple issues or subtasks.\r\n\r\nEspecially when trying to see how far we are in the sprint, it would be good to see in which column/swimlane the parent task would fall. \r\nI can imagine an indication like the one on the left hand side of the simple issue blocks (a colored bar, depending on the issue type), but horizontal on the bottom of the bar covering all swimlanes.
