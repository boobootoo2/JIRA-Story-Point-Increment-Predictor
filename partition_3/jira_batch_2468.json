The gentleman who answered suggested that I create a feature request, so that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m doing.\n\nEssentially what I want, is an extension point on the pull request overview (diff view) page for each file which has been changed, where I can optionally override the diff view which bitbucket provides (based on the file extension), and provide my own. This is because I have several binary files in source control which I can represent as text, and I would like the team to be able to see what has changed in these files when reviewing pull requests.\n\nThanks very much!\n\nJamey.",

URLs should not need a marked up carraige return character embedded in it, just my two cents.\n\nSo, the problem is not easily reproduceable however a feature request would be to have more reliable diff links without entity references embedded in them.\n\nSpecifically by way of example it would be nice if the diff URLs were human readable: eg\n\n{code}\nhttps://bitbucket.org/{account}/{repo}/branches/compare/{tag2}:{tag1}#diff\n{code}\n\ninstead of\n\n{code}\nhttps://bitbucket.org/{account}/{repo}/branches/compare/{tag2}%0D{tag1}#diff\n{code}\n\nIn the mail client I use (Mac Mail), I checked a sent email in a thread and the %0D had been stripped completely, leaving a URL of this form:\n\n{code}\nhttps://bitbucket.org/{account}/{repo}/branches/compare/{tag2}{tag1}#diff\n{code}\n\nwhich generated this error message at bitbucket:\n\n{code}\nillegal spec: {tag2}{tag1}\n{code}\n\nIt took quite awhile to figure out what was missing.\n\nA workaround might be for bitbucket&#x27;s front controller to detect this and redirect, though a wide variety of string parsing options would need to be checked for two actual tag/branch on the inbound account and repo in the precedent URI segments.\n\nWe&#x27;re using Mercurial for version control.

When you land on the \"Create a new repository\" screen, you are able to select or create a project as described [here|https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/create-and-grant-access-to-team-repositories-665225545.html#Createandgrantaccesstoteamrepositories-Createarepositoryforyourteam], however this is actually quite difficult to accomplish if you have many projects:\n\nIf you want to add the repository to an existing project, you have to manually scroll through the list until you find it. Even then, the order of said list appears to be in chronological order, whereas if I know the specific name, then it would be more feasible to have the list ordered alphabetically. Better still, a search functionality would be great (much like when you select the language), so you can jump straight to it rather than attempting to scroll through the list manually.\n\nIf you want to create a new project, the button to do so can be found when you scroll down to the bottom of the list. However as the content is loaded in dynamically and then appended, this pushes the button further down, meaning that you have to scroll down again to reach it, but the same thing happens. Only until you reach the very end of the list, you are then able to click it. If you have a lot of projects, then this can take some time to reach. A viable solution to this would be to have the button at the top of the list instead, so there&#x27;s no need to even scroll to reach it.\n\nFinally, if you have accidentally clicked on a project name whilst searching, you have to start all the way back from the beginning of the list. Here, I would expect the list to jump to the position of the selection, but unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t.\n\nIn all, this can be rather frustrating if you have many projects to work with.\n\ntl;dr - selecting/creating a project when creating a repository and setting the owner to a team is annoying. :-)",

Build includes testing + deploy to Artifactory. Furthermore, I have a bunch of components (submodules.)

      "description": "##Description\n\nI wanted to discuss the issue when the pagelen parameter is greater than the maximum allowed for the api endpoint. Currently the behavior is that the endpoint returns a error with the message \"invalid pagelen\". I think the correct behavior here is that it should return the API call with the maximum pagelen allowed by that endpoint, especially since the pagelen is integrated in the response.\n\n##Rationale\n\nHaving the API respond this way makes the endpoint very fragile. Meaning that you create a full break if there is even a small error in the request. This can raise overhead around coding exception cases to work around this. I think that generally the graceful failure route represents the better approach for a public API and allows for features built on top of it to be a lot more resilient.\n\n##Repro\n\nValid: https://bitbucket.org/api/2.0/repositories/jespern/django-piston/pullrequests?pagelen=50\n\nInvalid:h ttps://bitbucket.org/api/2.0/repositories/jespern/django-piston/pullrequests?pagelen=51\n\n##Related\n\nThis was mentioned in an earlier issue BCLOUD-9659, but the resolution proposed was the opposite (increasing max pagelen) and imho, correctly rejected.",

If _is not_ is chosen the joiner must be *and*.\n\nFor these binary filters, the _is_/_is not_ should only be selectable once per attribute, with additional filters on the same attribute forced to be identical to the first. Consider this example: searching for _status closed or status not wontfix_ yields identical results to searching only for _status not wontfix_. If you fix the lack of the *and* joiner, _status closed and status not wontfix_ would yield the same results as _status closed_.\n\nFor non-binary filters having *or* as the default joiner is counter-intuitive at best.",
