As a scrum master, I would like the burndown legend to be moved off the chart so I can see the burndown (or should I just say \"burn\" - not so much \"down\") line no matter how poorly the team is doing.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n !Screen Shot 2017-04-04 at 9.44.50 AM.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\nSee attached a screen shot of three charts laid out side-by-side on a three-column dashboard.

The proposed \"solution\" is to make the display of the detail a USER PREFERENCE that can be enabled or disabled per board (either Kanban or Scrum)\r\n\r\nSimilar to GHS-10182 - however, that request wanted to make it an ADMIN function to disable the detail view per board, which does not fit with a sub-set of users. \r\n\r\nh3. *Workaround*\r\n\r\n{panel:title=Added on 09 Jun 2020 with JIRA 7.13.13: }\r\nTo hide *_Issue Detail View_*, you can add it to your *Administration > System > Announcement banner (under User Interface)*: \r\n{code:html|title=} \r\n<style> \r\ndiv#ghx-detail-view { \r\n     display: none;\r\n}\r\n</style> \r\n{code} \r\n(!)

It would be good \r\nThat query is made 4 times in a create issue action so the impact is high.\r\n\r\nOption 3:\r\nThe big problem in this query is the order by id asc.\r\nRemoving that part of the query improved the performance from 2sec to 0.37 sec.

      "description": "I was asked to investigate performance problems for a customer with a relatively large instance who has provided access to their NewRelic data.  They had taken a profile while the LexoRank balancer was running, and I saw this:\r\n\r\n!LexoRank_01_QueryTime.png!\r\n\r\nAlthough the customer is on MySQL, we see similar poor behaviour of this style of query on our Postgres-based test cluster, which has roughly 279K issues and 5 ranking fields, resulting in nearly 1.4M lexorank rows:\r\n\r\n{code}\r\ncluster=# EXPLAIN UPDATE \"AO_60DB71_LEXORANK\" SET \"LOCK_HASH\"=NULL WHERE \"LOCK_HASH\" = '42';\r\n                               QUERY PLAN\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n Seq Scan on \"AO_60DB71_LEXORANK\"  (cost=0.00..31078.31 rows=1 width=52)\r\n   Filter: ((\"LOCK_HASH\")::text = '42'::text)\r\n(2 rows)\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nA sequential scan and cost of 31078.31 is not acceptable, especially for such a common operation.  This seems to be due to the lack of an {{@Indexed}} annotation on {{LockEntity.getLockHash()}}.  When I manually create this index, the query cost changes significantly as expected:\r\n\r\n{code}\r\ncluster=# CREATE INDEX index_ao_60db71_lex_crf ON \"AO_60DB71_LEXORANK\" (\"LOCK_HASH\");\r\nCREATE INDEX\r\ncluster=# EXPLAIN UPDATE \"AO_60DB71_LEXORANK\" SET \"LOCK_HASH\"=NULL WHERE \"LOCK_HASH\" = '42';                                             QUERY PLAN\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n Index Scan using index_ao_60db71_lex_crf on \"AO_60DB71_LEXORANK\"  (cost=0.00..8.42 rows=1 width=52)\r\n   Index Cond: ((\"LOCK_HASH\")::text = '42'::text)\r\n(2 rows)\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nThis would seem to be a valid workaround; however:\r\n# I'm not sure AO's automatic schema management will ignore the extra index.  Seems like it should, but I'm not sufficiently familiar with AO's behaviour here to know.\r\n# Similarly, this will presumably be fixed in JIRA Agile.  When that happens, the manually created index could get in the way of creating the JIRA Agile-supplied one, and I don't know what the result of that would be.\r\n",

I think that does NOT make any sense.\r\nWe have many (many!) different screens, after the upgrade, we had to go through ALL of them in order to clean all the mess up. Here some reasons why by default adding this field to ALL screens does not make any sense:\r\n* you added the field for example also to screens used for Epics :-( : a Sprint field does not have ANY sense for Epics. We have several other issue types where the sprint field does not have any sense !!!\r\n* in our screens for Stories/Tasks/... we already had the field, but not in the first tab. The upgrade process added it again to the first tab :-( :-(, so the field is there twice now \r\n* our screens are carefully designed, using different tabs where necessary. We try to avoid people have to scroll down, that the order of fields is \"logical\", ... . Just adding a Sprint field as last field on the screen does not help us a lot. Even for screens where the sprint field might be useful, we have to re-organize the field order and location. So your argument of \"helping\" the user does loose most of its value....\r\n\r\nI would like to add : please Atlassian, DO NOT add fields to screens in an upgrade process anymore !!! In general, please DO NOT thouch the user configuration during an upgrade.\r\n\r\n\r\nCheers",

      "description": "When an issue transitions to the same status that it's currently in, the cycle time on the Control Chart report is no longer reported correctly.\r\n\r\nThis can be duplicated with a new Kanban board set up with the \"new project\" option and the default simplified workflow and columns:\r\n\r\n1. Create an issue, wait 5 minutes\r\n2. Move to Selected for Development, wait 5 minutes\r\n3. Move to In Progress, wait 5 minutes\r\n4. Use the regular JIRA interface or the \"more actions\" dialog to select the In Progress transition again, so that the issue transitions to the same state.\r\n5. Move the issue to Done\r\n\r\nOn the Control Chart report, the time spent In Progress is now lost.\r\n\r\nThe steps above aren't likely to happen, but the same thing happens if you have a custom workflow transition to toggle flags or fields on an issue, or if you are using transitions as a \"poor man's field level security\" as explained here: https://confluence.atlassian.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=149834\r\n\r\nNote that after an issue has transitioned through a state once, this problem doesn't seem to occur anymore.\r\n\r\nIn our particular example, we have a transition on our Testing column to allow testers to update status; when they use this transition we lose all the initial time spent testing on the report.  We also have a global, recursive transition to allow limited field editing as described in the link above.  Whenever this is used on an active issue for the first time, it essentially erases all the time spent in that column.  As both these steps are used frequently in our workflow, this makes the control chart basically useless to us.",
