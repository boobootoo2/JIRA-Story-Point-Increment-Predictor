Steps to reproduce:\r\n# Generate an XML backup of a Confluence instance that has Team Calendars (TC) installed\r\n** TC doesn't have to be being used or even have a licence, just be enabled.\r\n** Because TC is installed & enabled on it, the source instance will have a bandana entry in the DB that has\r\n*** a {{bandanacontext}} of \"_CALENDAR_ee65026d81383713d11480a2da8ced1608ea1448\", and\r\n*** a {{bandanakey}} of \"legacySubCalendarsMigrationCutoffDate\".\r\n# Attempt to import this backup into an Confluence-only OnDemand instance using the \"Import site\" feature.\r\n\r\nh4. Expected result \r\n\r\nThe import should complete successfully.\r\n\r\nh4. Actual result\r\n\r\nThe import fails with the following error message:\r\n{quote}Import failed. Check your server logs for more information.\r\n\r\ncom.atlassian.confluence.importexport.ImportExportException: Unable to complete import because the data does not match the constraints in the Confluence schema.\r\n\r\nCause: PSQLException: ERROR: duplicate key value violates unique constraint \"bandana_unique_key\"{quote}\r\n\r\nh4. Workaround\r\n\r\nThe problem seems to centre around this \"legacySubCalendarsMigrationCutoffDate\" {{bandanakey}} when it exists in both the source and destination instances (i.e. if they both have the TC plugin installed, which all OnDemand instances do).\r\n\r\nThe site import will succeed if the following SQL is run on the destination instance immediately before the import:\r\n{code:sql}\r\nDELETE FROM bandana WHERE bandanacontext='_CALENDAR_ee65026d81383713d11480a2da8ced1608ea1448' AND bandanakey='legacySubCalendarsMigrationCutoffDate';\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nHowever, OnDemand customers cannot run arbitrary SQL on their instances, so this is not an acceptable workaround (unless Support is guiding them through the import process).\r\n\r\nThey could probably delete the offending entry from the {{entities.xml}} file inside their backup zip, but I haven't tested this.",

In non-\u00e0 la carte cases, this is fine, as the login screen has some smarts allowing it to identify that although the user has a valid session, they are not authorised to view the page they tried to, and as such a sensible message is displayed.\r\n\r\nIn OnDemand, however, we intercept the redirect to the login page and send them off to Indra. Part of Indra's behaviour is that if someone arrives on the login page _and_ they have a valid session _and_ they have a destination URL in the query string, they will be immediately redirect to the destination URL. This means that they get sent back to the page they couldn't view, still as the user who can't view it, and we lose.\r\n\r\nJIRA gets around this problem by including a {{permissionViolation}} parameter in the query string, allowing us to identify this scenario and no automatically redirect the user to the destination URL. Would it be possible for Confluence to do the same thing as JIRA here?",
