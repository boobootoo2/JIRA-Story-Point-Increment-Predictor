Issue Summary\r\nWhen sending an invitation to an e-mail address that does not have access to Bitbucket yet, to contribute on a workspace, if there isn't a Bitbucket Cloud account associated with that e-mail address, the user will be prompted to create a new account.\r\n\r\nAfter setting up a new account for that e-mail address, the expected behavior would be that the user would also have access to the workspace they've just accepted the invitation to. \r\n\r\nThe issue here is that, when accepting an invitation and you do not have a Bitbucket Cloud account yet, you will not automatically have access to the workspace you were invited to.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Receive an invitation to contribute on a workspace on an e-mail address that you do not have a Bitbucket Cloud account on;\r\n # Accept the invitation;\r\n # Go through the new Bitbucket Cloud account set up process;\r\n # After the account is created, if you go to \"All workspaces\", the workspace you just accepted the invitation to will not be there\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nWhen accepting an invitation as a user that does not have a Bitbucket Cloud account yet, it's expected that you would have access to the workspace you accepted the invitation to.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nAfter accepting the invitation to the workspace as a new Bitbucket Cloud user, you do not have access to the workspace.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\nIf you go to your e-mail and accept the invitation from the same e-mail message a second time, you will be redirected to Bitbucket to complete the invitation acceptance process. After accepting the invitation as an existing Bitbucket user, you will have access to the workspace in question.\r\n",

Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nIn the \"Run pipeline\" dialog, allow users to select multiple pipelines to run.\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nThe only workaround at the moment would be to create a script that uses our API to trigger a pipeline:\r\n\r\n[https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/bitbucket/rest/api-group-pipelines/#api-repositories-workspace-repo-slug-pipelines-post]\r\n\r\nand in that script include X API calls (where X is the number of pipelines you want to trigger), one for each pipeline.",

Usually we deploy locally in staging or development environments because we don't have to be so strict there and it's just faster to run script on pc with 16 Gb RAM than in Bitbucket Pipelines. The problem is to see what is actually deployed right not in staging or development, because when we deploy locally we don't affect Bitbucket Deployments and though they indicate a wrong state when we check them for staging or development.\r\n\r\nMy suggestion is to add a new Api under /deployments path here\r\n\r\nhttps://developer.atlassian.com/bitbucket/api/2/reference/resource/repositories/%7Bworkspace%7D/%7Brepo_slug%7D/deployments\r\n\r\nIt should accept commit hash and maybe optionally release time and create a deployment release under this commit and passed or present time in Bitbucket Deployments.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!",

      "description": "h3. Problem\r\n\r\nWhen adding a list of links, e.g. Jira issues, to a pull request description or comment it will display them incorrectly when the first word(s) of a list item are a link, it will break the rest of the text onto a new line.\r\n\r\nChrome fares somewhat better than Firefox, but still breaks sentences out to multiple paragraphs when there is a link, Firefox will also display the list item as if there were a linebreak immediately preceding the link.\r\nh3. Causes\r\n\r\nThe HTML for noted line items gets transformed to the following (formatting mine):\r\n{code:html}\r\n<li>\r\n\u00a0 <span data-renderer-mark=\"true\">\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 <p data-renderer-start-pos=\"65\">\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 <a\u00a0\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 class=\"sc-imABML jqxwZk\"\u00a0\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 href=\"https://example.com\"\u00a0\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 title=\"https://example.com\"\u00a0\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 data-renderer-mark=\"true\"\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 >\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The quick brown fox\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 </a>\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 </p>\r\n\u00a0 </span>\r\n\u00a0 <p data-renderer-start-pos=\"86\">\u00a0\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 should stop jumping over the dog\r\n\u00a0 </p>\r\n</li> {code}\r\nBy wrapping a paragraph in a span it creates an invalid DOM tree as spans are inline elements that should not contain a block level element. By way of example, adding a {{display: block}} to the span that wraps the paragraph removes the additional space above links seen in Firefox.\r\n\r\nNote too that the text is transformed such that there are 2 paragraphs, this causes an unnecessary break in the sentence that surely wasn't intended by the author.\r\nh3. Steps to reproduce\r\n - Create or visit a pull request\r\n - During creating or editing of the description or comment add several list items with varying number of words (See screenshots)\r\n - Make the first word / only word / first several words of the text a link on some of the list items\r\n - Save the description or comment\r\n - You may need to refresh the page at this point to see the unfortunately rendered items.\r\n\r\n!image-2021-11-24-14-28-08-896.png!!image-2021-11-24-14-28-23-458.png!!image-2021-11-24-14-28-32-134.png!",
