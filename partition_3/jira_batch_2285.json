      "description": "The current state is that at the end of the updateUsers() step the user gets redirected to the Crowd \"AtlassianImporter\" form. The form gets prefilled with the GET parameters provided, including the details (like password) in order to establish a JDBC connection to the JIRA database. Until now, the user just had to hit import since every necessary detail for the form got provided. Crowd recently changed the directory ids to be generated, so it is not possible (in an easy way) for us to pre-select the right directory anymore. Also, sending f.e. the password as a GET parameter exposes a security risk. The reason why the Studio Importer does it that way is because JIRA lacks a secure channel to Crowd. So James' idea is to enable Trusted Apps support for Crowd and provide a REST service for the user import so we can automate that step. The priority for that issue is low compared to the others since it wouldn't save the support team much time.",
