It resembles the old XLS file format which was also a binary file.\nCurrently Office Connector supports only xls and xlsx but do not recognize xslb\n\nh3.

Why this is important\nIt will allow Confluence to store large Excel files because XSLB provides better compression than XML based XSLX format.",

Although a number of us on the Confluence development team use the LastPass chrome extension, our attempts to investigate the root cause of this issue have been hampered by not being able to reproduce it ourselves.\n\nWe have noticed that LastPass' [release notes|https://lastpass.com/upgrade.php?fromwebsite=1&releasenotes=1] for version 4.1.40 mention fixing an issue that _\"impacted a handful of sites\"_.\n\nCould anyone who is still impacted by this issue please check the version of LastPass they have installed in Chrome? Typing {{chrome://extensions}} in your browser's address bar will show the version numbers for extensions you have installed.\n\nIf this issue has persisted for you and you are using LastPass 4.1.40 or later, please reach out to us again via [support.atlassian.com|https://support.atlassian.com/].\n\nThanks,\n Edith\n{panel}\nh3. Summary\n\nSeveral customers with the LastPass extension enabled in Chrome are reporting that they are unable to save Confluence pages, the UI\u00a0returns the error *\"Unable to communicate with server. Saving is not possible at the moment\"*.\n\n!abc.png|thumbnail!\nh3. Steps to reproduce.\n # Try to save a Confluence page in Chrome with the LastPass extension enabled, however, it happens only in specific situations and do not affect all customers.\n\nh3.

Problem Definition\nCurrently there is no way to make a copy of a page and have the copied page retain two things: \n# The page history of the original page\n# The same URL used by the original page\n\nh3. Suggested Solution\nImplement a solution that copies the page history of a page to the new copy and also ensures that all links pointing to the original page are re-routed to the new copy.\n\nh3. Why this is important\nIn certain situations, it is necessary to make a copy of a page to add the content, but the page cannot be copied back due to attachment names changing. \nProviding a way to correctly migrate the data to a new page with page history and little disruption to links would help fix this pain point. \n\nh3. Workaround \nAt this time there is not a workaround. ",

Summary\n\nWhen anonymous access is enabled a record is written to the space_permissions table. \u00a0This record does not include a name in the permgroupname field. \u00a0This causes the following record to be written continuously to the {{atlassian-confluence.log}}:\n{code:java}\nCould not find group configured with USE permission: null{code}\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\n # Start Confluence\n # Enable anonymous access in 'global permissions'\n # Synchronize with LDAP in the User Directories section of the admin console\n\nh3. Expected Results\n\nNo message is written to the logs regarding this newly created group for anonymous access\nh3. Actual Results\n\nThe logs continually show:\n{code:java}\nINFO [http-nio-8090-exec-14] [atlassian.confluence.user.DefaultUserAccessor] getUsersWithConfluenceAccess Could not find group configured with USE permission: null{code}\nh3. Notes\n\nIn the example provided, this message appears almost 59,000 times in the course of 24 hours. \u00a0This is obviously junking up the logs with unnecessary messages. \u00a0We would like either the message not to be written to the logs at all, or add a *permgroupname*\u00a0such as 'anonymous' to the *spacepermissions*\u00a0table.\u00a0\nh3. Workaround\n # You can suppress the message by [Configuring Logging|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Configuring+Logging]\u00a0\n # Adding a name directly to the *spacepermissions*\u00a0group table in the *permgroupnames*\u00a0field. \u00a0This will need to be redone if anonymous access is turned off and back on again or if Confluence is restarted.\n\n\u00a0",

So you have to train yourself to hit Cmd-F, but wait.

When a\u00a0session expires mid-edit, as one types, Synchrony still displays a 'Saving changes' message:\n\n!synchrony_saving.png!\n\nthen replaced by a 'Changes saved' message when one stops typing:\n\n!synchrony_saved.png!\n\nBut this is a filthy lie, as can be seen if one watches the developer console. The changes aren't being saved:\n\n!confedit_errors.png!\n\nWhen one finally clicks 'Update', one just gets a spinner and nothing is saved.\nh2. Steps to Replicate\n # Load up Chrome and edit any page (assuming Synchrony enabled)\n # Hit F12 to open the developer panel, go to the 'Applications' tab and view the page's cookies:\n !conf_cookies.png!\n # Delete the\u00a0JSESSIONID and 'seraph.confluence' cookies to simulate a session timeout with no 'remember me'.\n # Continue editing.\u00a0The editor will keep reporting 'Changes saved' despite obviously being unable to.\n \u00a0\n\nSome Q&A:\nh2. This must be wrong. Doesn't the editor display a warning when it can't save a draft?\n\nConfluence's editor displays a nice 'Error saving draft. No draft has been saved' message if it _loses connection_ with the server. If it merely gets 403 errors, it continues happily pretending to save.\nh2. If this bug is so terrible, why have I never encountered it?\n\nBecause normally developers tick 'Remember me' when logging in. Also, the chances of having an editor open at the point of session expiration (1h) is moderately low.\nh2. Why don't users tick 'Remember me'?\n\nBecause it's unticked by default, and somewhat cryptic to the uninitiated.\n\nAlso, some SSO systems like Okta work by storing users' credentials for them, providing an alternative login screen (e.g. [Okta SWA|https://support.okta.com/help/articles/Knowledge_Article/28328856-Overview-of-Managing-Apps-and-SSO]), and logging in on behalf of users. Okta users in particular never get to set the 'Remember me' checkbox.\nh2. Why isn't 'Remember me' ticked by default?\n\nYou tell me.",

Our users either have to subscribe to all blog posts (which often means they are receiving a lot of unnecessary email notifications and getting frustrated) or they are going to many spaces one at a time to watch each individual blog. It would be really helpful for there to be a quick way for them to choose which space blogs are applicable to them. The Space Directory seems like a great place for them to be able to go down the list and quickly choose which space blogs they are interested in. Perhaps if they could even choose an entire category with one click, that would be really nice. I think this is a feature that would make our users extremely happy. Thank you!",

Problem Definition\n\nThe current implementation of *DEBUG* (or *ALL*) level is set to the class *{{com.atlassian.confluence.mail}}* doesn't log any helpful information for troubleshooting purposes or simple consulting of emails sent by Confluence.\n Here is an example of the logged message when a page is created in a space where the user is a watcher:\n\n\u00a0\n{code:java}\n2016-12-08 11:03:45,957 DEBUG [NotificationSender:thread-2] [confluence.mail.embed.ThreadLocalMimeBodyPartRecorder] record Recorded DataSources with names [page-icon,com.atlassian.confluence.plugins.confluence-email-resources_view-page-email-adg-footer-item_icon,com.atlassian.confluence.plugins.confluence-email-resources_add-comment-to-content-email-adg-footer-item_icon,com.atlassian.confluence.plugins.confluence-like_view-email-adg-content-item_icon,avatar_909dc5ca9d66d2392b9d7bb6d625385f,footer-desktop-logo,footer-mobile-logo].\n 2016-12-08 11:03:46,000 DEBUG [NotificationSender:thread-2] [atlassian.confluence.mail.BotocssMailContentProcessor] process Botocss is about to inject styles in to the email.\n 2016-12-08 11:03:46,041 DEBUG [NotificationSender:thread-2] [atlassian.confluence.mail.BotocssMailContentProcessor] apply Pruning selected styles from the email.\n\n{code}\nIf the user is mentioned or other notifications event is triggered and the email is sent successfully, the same messages are logged. This is very confusing for troubleshooting purposes\u00a0since we cannot determine the action that triggered the email nor the users involved.\nh3. Suggested Solution\n\nThe mail logging system could be implemented as it currently is in JIRA.

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFSERVER-45513].\n  {panel}\n\n*Use case:*\n\nWe allow some external users to access our internal company Confluence. This is done using a LDAP user directory, so new external users are synchronized automatically when they have a special Confluence right. Sometimes we don't grant access to any space but plan to do so later. So some users have access to our Confluence but shouldn't have access to any Space. But if they login, the Welcome screen forces users to watch a Space. It seems to be if they aren't allowed to see any Space, the Welcome screen chooses a random Space for suggestion. The user can't skip the process, so he watches the space he shouldn't be able to see. From now on he can see the space but isn't listed in the permission setting for that Space. So one can't also detect or remove the permission.\n\n\u00a0\n\n*Steps to reproduce:*\n * Have the Welcome screen enabled (for all modules)\n * Add fresh user to Confluence\n * Assign the user to a group without default space permissions (global permissions \"can use\", but not listed under default space permissions)\n * Login as that user\n * Skip intro\n * Skip also next page (thats the personal space page setup? not sure but also not important for this)\n * Check the suggested Space for watching\n * Open that space\n\n\u00a0\n\n*Actual result:*\n * User can see a space\n * User is not listed when checking the space permissions\n\n\u00a0\n\n*Expected result:*\n * 3rd welcome screen is skipped because he can't watch any space\n * User can't see any space\n\n\u00a0\n\nWe had this issue multiple times, I can not guarantee that users see what they are meant to see.\n\n\u00a0\n\n*Workaround for +future situations+:*\n * Skip welcome screen ([https://confluence.atlassian.com/confkb/how-to-skip-the-welcome-action-for-new-users-in-confluence-777016501.html)]\n\n\u00a0\n\n*Workaround for +past situations:+*\n * ???\n\n\u00a0\n\nI need something like:\n * Find out which users can see spaces they shouldn't see\n * Remove their access to those spaces\n\nOur Confluence version is 5.9.8.",

Right now, updates are Created, Updated, or Commented (More or less). Particularly on comments, it would be helpful to be able to distinguish between comments on a page I wrote or in direct response to one of my comments as compared to a comment on a page in a space I'm watching wholly. I'm sure there are more granular levels, but having the emails say \"There is one new comment on a page you wrote\" or \"John Smith responded to your comment\" or \"There is one new comment on a page in a space you're watching\" would be helpful for triaging.",

It thinks it's being friendly but when you use too many words and sell me on something I'm already using, that's not friendly. It's annoying. Plus, it takes forever to get the answers I'm looking for because they are not the primary purpose of the writing.\u00a0\n\nHere's an example from your Pages and Blogs documentation. I went there when I was looking for how to create a page that hangs off a main page. Pages and Blogs sounded like a reasonable place to start. Here's what I got:\n\"When you create any content in Confluence - whether it's taking down some quick [notes from a meeting|https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/meeting-notes-blueprint-329975386.html], writing a [requirements page|https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/product-requirements-blueprint-329975392.html], or letting your teammates know about the company's latest marketing push - you'll either be creating it as a [page|https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/create-and-edit-pages-139476.html] or a [blog post|https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/blog-posts-834222533.html]. You may be shocked to know that this page you're reading now, is, in fact, a Confluence page!\n\nPages and blog posts are the two things that allow you to capture and share information in Confluence, and which one you use depends on what you want to do with your content. If you want the information to last, and possibly evolve over time, then you likely want to create a page; if the information is specific mainly to the current time-frame, and isn't going to change over time, then you'll most likely want to create it as a blog post. These aren't hard-and-fast rules; they're just pointers to give you a place to start.\"\n\nHere's a rewrite that's actually aimed at people who are looking for answers, not friends or marketing garbage.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\"When you create any content in Confluence you are creating a\u00a0[page|https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/create-and-edit-pages-139476.html]\u00a0or a\u00a0[blog post|https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/blog-posts-834222533.html]. \u00a0For instance, the page you're reading now is a Confluence page.\n\nCreate a page when you want the information to last, and possibly evolve over time.\n\nCreate a blog post if the information is time-specific and will not change over time.\n\nThese aren't hard-and-fast rules; they're just pointers to give you a place to start.\"\n\n\u00a0\n\nSee how I did that? I put the answers right where everyone can see them instead of burying it in a torrent of bullshit. Oops! Can I say bullshit?\n\nI just did!\n\nCarl Yorke",

We need a way to script the entire process from scratch all the way up to a working and fully configured Confluence instance. I'm using Ansible for this task, but the same problem exists for all similar tools (Puppet, Chef, Salt, etc).\n\nThe *installation* can be done programmatically. But the *setup* part involves clicking through a wizard web interface to select the installation type, put in the license, configure the database, etc: https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/confluence-setup-guide-135691.html.\nThis prevents proper automation.\n\nI know that Stash exposes a REST API that can be used to automate some of these steps (for instance the license: https://developer.atlassian.com/static/rest/stash/3.11.3/stash-rest.html#idp1739392), but the Confluence REST API doesn't expose anything like this.\n\nSo at this point our devops process is stuck and we need to manually click through a wizard, which is a real pain.\n\nConfluence needs to be able to get deployed without manual intervention.\n\nThis can either be done by providing options during install, for instance using a simple configuration file with license, install type, plugins to include.\n\nOr extend the REST API to handle these.",
