We use compounded news feeds for groups of spaces, and cannot currently use the blog-posts macro for that since the user cannot see which space the news applies to. A simple *showSpace* parameter could take care of this.\n\nAdding a *showDateModified* parameter would help the user see that a blog post has been updated since it was posted. This can of course be seen in RSS feeds for instance, but this way it would even be evident from browsing the blog posts list. Of course some might prefer to have the modified date _in stead of_ the created date. So why not add a *showDateCreated* parameter as well?\n\nFinally, adding a *showLabels* parameter to allow labels _not_ to show in news feeds would make the news layout cleaner. We sometimes use lots of labels but they are only useful in classifying news, not for displaying in the news feed.\n\nCheers!",

Depending on servlet version, the parsing may also be the application responsibility.\n\nWe should:\n* Change the form to be a multipart form\n* Only parse the form data if the user has permissions to edit the page\n* Enforce an admin configurable limit on the post data size for that page.\n* Display an error message to the user when the limit is exceeded (currently it just continues blissfully ignorant of the fact that it doesn't have all the data)",

The left navigation theme was a popular choice for many wiki spaces, but now most users seem to be transitioning well to the new documentation theme.\n\nWe did have one comment though from a user expressing some disappointment that the space search built into the left sidebar of the documentation theme was not a \"live\" search. Through the use of the \"Navigation\" page, many users had added both live search and pagetree, so I can sympathise that they felt there was a small loss of functionality with the new documentation theme.\n\nHowever, we took a look at the velocity template for the documentation theme (doctheme-page.vmd) and have made a small mod so that live search is now offered in place of the regular search. Here's the mod:\n\nBefore (lines 6 to 10):\n\n{noformat}\n            #if (!$params.get(\"mode\").contains(\"edit\"))\n            <content tag=\"tree\">\n            $helper.renderConfluenceMacro(\"{pagetree:root=@home|searchBox=true}\")\n            </content>\n            #end\n\n            After:\n\n            #if (!$params.get(\"mode\").contains(\"edit\"))\n            <content tag=\"tree\">\n            ## CHCH 26/08/10 - Replaced Pagetree search with Live Search\n            $helper.renderConfluenceMacro(\"{livesearch:spaceKey=$spaceKey}\")\n            $helper.renderConfluenceMacro(\"{pagetree:root=@home|searchBox=false}\")\n            </content>\n            #end\n{noformat}\n{quote}",

Specifically, for archival/audit purposes, we want to be able to link to older versions of a page.  This is currently possible, but only at the cost of using an opaque identifier.  This means, to verify that a link points to the right page, you actually have to follow the link, and see the name of the page.\n\nI have two uses for this:\nOn the current version of a page, I want to link to an older version of the same page - for example to indicate the version of a page that was \"approved\".\n\nOn some other page, I want to be able to gather up links to a collection of pages related to some particular subject, and capture the state of those documents at a particular point in time.\n\nBoth of these can be done now, but at the cost of click-through to verify the correct link.  This makes tracking links to older versions of pages far more error prone.  For example, I might easily link to the wrong version of a page, or I might put add a typo, an invalid opaque ID, and not link to anything at all, thus losing the original intent.\n",

It would be nice if {{execute()}} gave you a slightly richer parameters object, that you could do something like:\n\n{code}int foo = params.get(\"foo\", MacroParameterType.INT, Integer.class);{code}\n\nor maybe:\n\n{code}int foo = params.getInt(\"foo\");{code}\n\neither of which would give you a param of the correct type, validated against the declared type in the metadata.  Alternatively, there could be an extra helper method on {{MacroModuleDescriptor}} that you could do the same kind of thing with:\n\n{code}int foo = descriptor.getIntParameter(params, \"foo\");{code}\n",

Some of them were problematic PDFs, and I've voted on CONF-18962 to get those resolved.\nHowever, the vast majority of issues were relating to .xls and .csv files not being properly indexed.\nIn many of the cases the following appeared:\n{noformat}\norg.apache.poi.poifs.filesystem.OfficeXmlFileException: The supplied data appears to be in the Office 2007+ XML. You are calling the part of POI that deals with OLE2 Office Documents. You need to call a different part of POI to process this data (eg XSSF instead of HSSF)\n{noformat}\n,and POI is correct. We use a tool called FlorenceSoft DiffEngineX to carry out diffs between Excel documents, and this inexplicably creates Office 2007 format output, but mistakenly used a .xls (instead of .xlsx) extension.\nI'm not aware of any other tools that make this mistake, but I'm sure we're not the only ones who have content saved with the wrong extension. Considering POI is able to guess that it might be Office 2007 content, perhaps Confluence could capture the error, and try to re-index the documents as Excel 2007? It would be fantastic, and I'd really appreciate it.",

I at least disagree. Take the following example:\n\nWe have 2 administrators, admin1 restricts the page with the the view restriction to himself. This means that admin1 is added to the list of people who are able to view the page, all other users can not see the page except admin2 user (as he is an administrator, but he also cant see the page in the spaces page tree for example). \n\nNow, lets say the admin1 is on holiday and the restricted page needs editing. The admin2 user can not edit the page until he removes the restriction that admin has placed for himself. This is quite simple to do, but a small amount of unnecessary work. \n\nBut what if there were restrictions for 10 people? What if the groups and users are retrieved through LDAP and no logical group can be used, and 10 single restrictions were required? The admin2 user would first have to remove the 10 people from the restrictions, edit the page, then add the 10 people again (since no logical LDAP group can be used) This is totally unnecessary overhaul for the administrators. Administrators should be able to edit the page even though it is restricted to whoever. Of course we could create a LDAP group with those 10 users, but this too is an overhaul that some companies can not afford, and even with this resolution, the admin2 user would first have to remove the restriction, edit the page, then add it again. \n\nI understand from the previous submissions that this is how it is supposed to work, that the user does not accidentally see (i.e. in the spaces pagetree view) or accidentally edit a page (a restricted edit page) that he/she isnt supposed to edit, but the administrator should be on top of this and know the details. \n\nTo help the administrator notice the restriction, as a solution I suggest a new feature, that all restricted pages (view or edit) have a noticeable panel to the administrators that this is a restricted page, either view or edit, without removing the edit function from the page, because this creates unnecessary overhaul, one way or another.",

Many of them use public email addresses.  \n\n\nWhen Conflucene emails a notification of a change. It emails the entire content of the Confluence page. In effect copying what was a secure page and placing it onto the public domain.\n\n\nThere used to be a third party plug-in that provided this functionality but that doesn't work in version 3.3.\n\n\nSch an elementary feature should be part of Confluence especially given how email has become so insecure.\n\n\nIn the ole-days everyone used a company supplied server which they used to access their email that could presumably be made secure but today not all small companies operate like this anymore and allow people use their gmail.com, yahoo.com, etc. email addresses instead.\n\n\nIn this situation, having Confluence send only a link to the content is critical, IMHO",

I've looked in to seeing if Flying Saucer (xhtmlrenderer) supports this and as it turns out they have an example of how this can be accomplished by use of <object>.\n\nIn flying saucer this would be accomplished by implementing a ReplacedElementFactory which captures objects of the type \"image/svg+xml\". The svg could be rendered to a context by an svg library like svgsalamander. The context would then be passed to itext which would render it to pdf.\n\nThere is a ReplacedElementFactory demo which uses svgsalamander to render onto a jpane in the xhtmlrenderer source repository.\n\n",

At the moment, it points to \"www.atlassian.com\". Instead, it should point to this doc page:\nhttp://confluence.atlassian.com/x/A4kpCg\n\nIn addition, the tech writing team will change the above page as follows:\n* Short-term: Add at least the following version and authorship information to the above doc page:\n{quote}Latest version: 1.0.4\nCompatible with: All versions of Firefox, up to and including 3.6.6\nAuthor: Atlassian Pty Ltd\n{quote}\n* As soon as the add-on is hosted at Firefox: Replace the above short-term wording with a link to the add-on's page at Mozilla.",

The new license API supports embedding and extracting arbitrary keys out of the license.  This functionality would be really useful for Studio with Balsamiq and Gliffy licenses.  We currently have deals with Balsamiq and Gliffy that allow us to bundle them with Studio, however, the licenses are maintained separately, which is a pain to maintain.  What we would like to do is add the Balsamiq/Gliffy license as custom properties to the Confluence license in the Studio license, that way there is only one license to maintain.  The Balsamiq developers have indicated they would be happy to support this, and we're assuming Gliffy would be ok too.  We can do this now, except because Confluence is using the legacy license API, there's no way for the Balsamiq plugin to read these custom properties from the license.",

Under Windows 7 with the default Tomcat settings, this plugin cannot be uploaded, which prevents all tests from running. It fails inside the native WinNTFileSystem code while trying to create a temp file under <TOMCAT HOME>/temp, probably due to Windows 7 Windows-on-Windows permissions differences (Tomcat is installed under Program Files, which is protected and files created/modified without elevated privileges are instead written to the c:\\Users\\<USER>\\AppData\\Local\\VirtualStore of the active user).\n\njava.io.IOException: Access is denied\n        at java.io.WinNTFileSystem.createFileExclusively(Native Method)\n        at java.io.File.checkAndCreate(File.java:1345)\n        at java.io.File.createTempFile(File.java:1434)\n\nThe exception itself is a known JDK bug (see http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=6325169) and has been open 5 years now, as it has occurred on various versions of Windows. We should seriously think about detecting this sort of failure and reporting it to the user, or even changing the default install settings of tomcat so it never tries to use a tempdir under Program Files.\n\nA workaround is to pass the JVM arg -Djava.io.tmpdir=c:\\tmp (or some other unprotected dir) to tomcat.
