      "description": "This is a feature request for Bitbucket Pipelines.\r\n\r\nWhen building a release, some artifacts are produced. These artifacts are required in the deployment steps. At the moment these artifacts are retained for 14 days.\r\n\r\nThat means that it is not possible to quickly rollback to a previous version if the release was built more than 14 days ago. Consider the following scenario:\r\n * A release was built and deployed to production 30 days ago. It has been working perfectly fine all this time.\r\n * Today, a new release was built and deployed to production. Unfortunately this release contains some problems and shortly after the deployment the team decides to rollback to the previous version which has been in production for the last 30 days.\r\n * Unfortunately it is not possible to rollback quickly because the necessary artifacts expired 14 days after the initial deployment, even if the release was still deployed in production.\r\n\r\nEven for teams that deploy frequently to production, there may be very good reasons the team may want to pause deployments to production for more than 14 days. For example, this may include holidays, priority changes, complex investigations of issues affecting the pre-prod environments, etc. Or the service may just be in maintenance mode.\r\n\r\nI understand there is a need to purge old artifacts. The suggestion would be to start the counter not when the release is deployed for the first time, but when the release is removed from the last environment. In other words: purge the artifacts 14 days after the release has not been deployed to any environment. If the release is still deployed in some environments (including production), please keep the artifacts around.",

Having this automated in Bitbucket would be beneficial for clients and a differentiator for Bitbucket.\r\n\r\nSide note: GitLab offers Token Hunter:\u00a0[https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2019/12/20/introducing-token-hunter/]",
