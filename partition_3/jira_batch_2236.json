In some of these applications you can create a workaround by manually creating links in the submenu but this is far from ideal and is not possible everywhere. When in the admin area there is a way to switch apps, we would like to see this feature in all the applications as well. In Jira you can customize the list op applications that appear which some people will love but this list does nog appear on all the other applications. We need a unified way to switch between all the applications we are using.\r\n * The look & feel settings have been reduced to 2 colour and a logo. We prefer to have a few more colours but appreciate starting the new Jira experience with a clean slate. However the look & feel settings are not used across all our applications. We like our users to have a unified look & feel across all our applications. We do not need seperate look & feel setting for each application.\u00a0\r\n\r\nIt seems logical to move some setting like navigation, look & feel, admin etc. to the Atlassian Cloud level so they are used over all applications instead of the Jira level.\r\n\r\nAnother thing we woul like to see improved is being able to see our Bitbucket instances and users from the general admin area. This way we can manage application access to Bitbucket from the same place as our other applications. But again moving user management to the Atlassian cloud level would probably be a necessary step.\r\n\r\n-\u00a0",

      "description": "As an Atlassian Cloud customer, I use Jira and Confluence and receive StatusPage alerts. When a service on Atlassian Cloud that I don't use, such as BitBucket, has issues, I do not need to receive StatusPage alerts for that service.\r\n\r\nI would like my StatusPage alerts to take into consideration what services I have enabled on Atlassian Cloud and only send me notification for those services. The benefit would be to reduce the amount of alert email in my inbox that are irrelevant to me.\r\n\r\n*What happened:*\r\n\r\nBitBucket had degraded performance on 9th January 2018 that resulted in hourly notification email being sent to my inbox for 6 hours or so.\r\n\r\n*What I would have expected:*\r\n\r\nAs I do not have BitBucket enabled, I would have expected not to receive those alerts.",
