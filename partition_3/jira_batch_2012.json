      "description": "h3. Summary\r\n\r\nThe bug was found when vendor was testing their macro but this issue affects any macro using \"confluence-content\" parameters. This affects both Cloud and Server. \r\n\r\n_All details here are provided by the vendor_\r\n\r\nReplication steps:\r\n\r\nPreparation (in space SRC):\r\n # Add a macro that takes a page as a parameter to a page A\r\n # Set page C in the current space (SRC) as the value of the parameter\r\n\r\nDifferent variants of the bug:\r\n # Copy-paste the macro:\r\n ## Open editor for the page A\r\n ## Select the macro placeholder in editor and choose copy\r\n ## Open editor for a page B in another space DEST\r\n ## Paste the macro from page A to the editor for page B\r\n ## Save page B\r\n -> the macro does not point to the page SRC:C anymore\r\n -> unless the DEST space has a page with title C the macro breaks (eg \"unable to render \\{include}\r\nThe page could not be found\" is shown)\r\n\r\n # Copy page and change location in editor to new space\r\n ## Open the page A\r\n ## Choose copy\r\n ## In the editor opened for copy of page A, click 'location' (next to breadcrumb)\r\n ## Choose a page in another space (eg DEST) as the new parent\r\n ## Save\r\n -> same problems as in variant A\r\n # Copy page directly to new space (without children)\r\n ## same as B but choose a parent page in different space already in the \"pick location\" dialog opened after clicking on \"copy\"\r\n ## the \"pick location\" dialog is not shown at all on Cloud, so 3rd affects only Server\r\n\r\nh3. Expected\r\n\r\nWhen macro is copied to new space the relative link to a page in its original space is qualified with the original space key (turned into an absolute link)\r\nh3. Actual\r\n\r\nThe link breaks\r\nh3. Affects/Impact\r\n\r\nThis affects any macro saving a page reference to a macro parameter with type \"confluence-content\" (for example \"Include page\" or \"Excerpt include\")\r\n\r\n*Customer Installation Impacts: 1,215*\r\nh3. Notes\r\n- in all cases using a Link to page A works correctly but macro parameters break\r\n- the macro user (or developer) cannot choose to use an absolute link to a page in current space by qualifying with the space key when setting the parameter value. Confluence will automatically (in some cases) turn links to pages in current space to be relative (always using absolute references would also solve the problems with page titles including ':'...)\r\n- the copy operations seem to work correctly when the editor is not involved, so the bug is in handling the macro parameters in \"editor format\" (ie the data-macro-* attributes on the macro placeholder)\r\n- have not tested if this happens also with macros with body, it happens at least for any bodiless macro\r\n- tested on Confluence Cloud, and Confluence 6.0 + 6.12 on Server\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\nNo current workaround. This will be change once a workaround is possible",

Issue Summary\r\nIn Confluence, when a page has a lot of content (e.g. macros, information from macros, attachments and a lot of images), the page will take some time to render, but, indeed, either it will not be rendered, or, a timeout like the following will be displayed:\r\n\r\n{code}\r\nError: GraphQL error: Timeout error querying the remote graphql service.\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # In Confluence, make sure to create a page that will have a lot of content to be rendered. Specific examples could be related to the [User list macro|https://confluence.atlassian.com/confcloud/user-list-macro-724765305.html] when trying to retrieve the users from a (default, mostly) group with a lot of users (like 2000).\r\n # If there are no errors saving the content, try to publish the page.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nThe page should render properly, or, after a while, have the content rendering properly.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nThe page will take a while to load, and eventually, it will fail with a message like above, or, simply not have the content rendering, with only errors from the browser's console.\r\n\r\nh3. Notes\r\n\r\nReports and tests come typically from the following scenarios:\r\n\r\n* Pages using multiple Jira issues macro separately, or, using a JQL that will retrieve a lot of content.\r\n* Using the *user-list* macro with default groups like *confluence-users* when having a lot of users.\r\n* *Blog Posts* macro when using the parameter to show all the content of the blog and having a lot of blogs on the instance\r\n* Multiple \"Excerpt-includes\" macros on the page.\r\n* Multiple \"Expand\" macros on the page\r\n* Content by label macros with a lot of pages to be rendered\r\n\r\nh3.

Steps to Reproduce\r\n# In Confluence, make sure to create a new page using the new/legacy editor to insert a table (using the first row as the header, according to [how the macro is inserted|https://confluence.atlassian.com/confcloud/page-properties-macro-724765240.html#PagePropertiesMacro-AddingthePagePropertiesmacrotoapage]) in order to have multiple information being displayed for the report.\r\n# Create a new page that will be using the new editor and insert the *Page properties report* macro.\r\n# On the macro configuration (tapping to *edit* the same), make sure to tap the *show* button in the *options* part, and then, fill the *Columns to show* field with the name of the previously created table, so it will not include all of them and allow the bug to be triggered.

Summary\r\nI have a macro that needs to store N (which might be really high) references to Confluence pages.\r\n\r\nThe solution I would want to use is to have a macro parameter of type \"confluence-content\" allowing multiple values (\"multiple\"=true)\r\n\r\nNow I get the page references as a list of  'space-key:page-title' entries separated by ',' characters\r\n\r\nHowever, a page title can contain ',' characters, and in this case I cannot correctly split the macro parameter string value to individual page references\r\n\r\nFor example, if I have a page with title \"One, Two, and Three\" and another page with title \"Four\", both in current space, the macro parameter string value could look like:\r\n\"One, Two, and Three,Four\"\r\n-> when parsing the parameter string value, it is not possible to know which ',' are part of titles and which ones should be separators\r\n\r\nOn Confluence Server you can define a custom separator like:\r\n{code}\r\n<parameter name=\"multiRef\" type=\"confluence-content\" multiple=\"true\">\r\n             <option key=\"delimiter\" value=\"-!!!!!-\"/>\r\n</parameter>\r\n{code}\r\ni.e. you can set the delimiter string to some value that is really unlikely to happen inside a page title.\r\n\r\nI would need to do the same on Confluence Cloud but \"delimiter\" parameter is not specified here:\r\nhttps://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/confluence/modules/macro-input-parameter/\r\nand it did not work either when I tested setting it anyway\r\n",

The editor becomes slow when publishing page changes and the copy page operation may also timeout.\r\n\r\nh2. Steps to Replicate\r\nIt is unknown how a page would get into a state where an element is wrapped by multiple _<div class=\"table-wrap\">_ elements, but, this may be a slight variation of the bug described in [CONFSERVER-51834|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFSERVER-51834]. Corrupted pages may contribute to bigger levels of nesting.\r\n\r\nh2. How it Looks Like - How to Diagnose the Issue\r\nIf typing text to a page is a slow operation to you, right click the slowness spot in the page and click on Inspect Element (instructions for Chrome, other browsers may vary a little bit). You shall see something like this:\r\n!Screen Shot 2019-01-10 at 19.19.20.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nThis is just the top of the iceberg.

Workaround\r\nWorking around this issue requires manual efforts and a little bit of HTML knowledge. Instructions below represent one of many possible workarounds. In case of any doubts when following this, [engage Support for assistance|https://support.atlassian.com/contact/].\r\n# Export the slow page as HTML.\r\n## To do so, you must be at least a Space Admin.\r\n## Access Space Settings in the Space which the affected page belongs to.\r\n## Click on Content Tools.\r\n## Click on Export.\r\n## Select HTML and then finish the Export process.\r\n# Clear up nested tags using Chrome Developer Tools.\r\n## You are going to drag and drop the exported HTML Page to an empty Chrome Tab.\r\n## With that done, go to the spot where the slowness happens and click on Inspect Element.\r\n## Now, this is the tricky part. We are going to use the drag and drop feature of the Chrome Developer tools to do so.\r\n## Using below screenshot as a reference, expand as much elements as possible.\r\n!Screen Shot 2019-01-10 at 19.19.20.png|thumbnail!\r\n## As can be seen here, we have tons of _table-wrap_ elements below the _wiki-content_ element.\r\n## The exercise consists of pretty much clicking in the last _table-wrap_ element of the list and dragging it below the _wiki-content element until we have reduced it to an acceptable range of wraps.\r\n## Once that's done, we need to scroll-up to the head element, right click on it and save as HTML.\r\n## You are going to use this HTML to replace the HTML of the page exported earlier.\r\n# Upload the XML Export back to Cloud\r\n## Once that page is saved and had its HTML modified, just zip all elements of the export back into the original zip file.\r\n## We are now going to follow the reverse route and Import that XML into your Confluence Cloud instance.\r\n## To do so, you must be at least a Space Admin.\r\n## Access Space Settings in the Space which the affected page belongs to.\r\n## Click on Content Tools.\r\n## Click on Import.\r\n## Select HTML and then finish the Import process.\r\n## Once that's completed, you will have the worked around page in your instance.\r\n## Just copy it to the space in which it needs to be and the issue shall be solved.\r\n\r\n(!) There's a possibility that some of the formatting is lost, so, get ready to fix part of it if needed. Content though should remain the same.\r\n\r\nh2.
