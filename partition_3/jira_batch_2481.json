      "description": "Hi,\n\nI have a situation where the BitBucket repo is the only place that contains an orphaned commit. Nobody else has a copy of the branch it was on, or of the commit itself. I really need to be able to fetch that commit and it&#x27;s parent commits.\n\nIf there was a way to tag a commit on the server, I could use {{git fetch}} to retrieve it. But unfortunately it is not possible. This is addressed in issue BCLOUD-7399.\n\nAnother way could be to SSH into the server and perform the steps described [here|http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25416003/clone-a-git-repository-and-keep-unreachable-commits#answer-25416117]. Of course this is not possible since I do not maintain the server . Duh. If I could SSH, I could also tag the commit using Git CLI.\n\nIt looks like right now there is absolutely no way for me to retrieve the commit I want, even though I know it&#x27;s exact complete SHA-1, and I can access it&#x27;s BB page in the browser by typing in https://bitbucket.org/<user>/<repo>/commits/<sha-1>.\n\nThis is very disappointing, very frustrating and is probably going to cause waste of several hours of work. Please fix. I really need that commit, and I am sure I&#x27;m not alone.",

It is a waste of time and data traffic to clone the whole thing on your local drive, tag it and push it back !\n\nI have a project that has a public repository and a private one. In private I work on my new ideas and on public one I encourage people to fork it and develop it. I don&#x27;t have any local copy of the public repository and I create pull request from my devel repo to the public one. I can tag the commits in my devel repo but after the pull request is applied the tags are not going to show up in the public repo, so I think having this option would be good.",
