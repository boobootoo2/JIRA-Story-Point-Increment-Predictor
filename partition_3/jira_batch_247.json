If an issue is bogus, I have to first go to the full issue view so I can resolve it.\r\n\r\n4--the tabbed interface is inefficient. \r\n      often i have to flip back & forth between the task description, comments, attachments, and subtasks. I think a single tab with collapsible sections would be much easier to use.\r\n\r\n5--fields on the first tab take too much space. it shouldn't require 90px of vertical space to show 2 dates or 2 people.

Steps to reproduce:\r\n# Set the 'Estimation Statistic' as 'Story Points'\r\n# Create two issues:\r\n** First issue with story point *'1.667'*\r\n** Second issue with story point *'8.33'*\r\n# Create a sprint for those two issues and start the sprint.\r\n# You will see the 'Not started' story points shows '91.00', which it suppose to be '9.997'/'10'\r\n\r\nh4.Diagnose\r\nThis is only happen when the third decimal number is >= '5' for the total story points, e.g. '0.665' or '0.667'. If the total story points as *'9.991'*, everything looks normal. \r\n\r\nHowever, when you start work on issue, let's say move the first issue to 'In Process', then the 'In progress' value will take '1.667' as '1.67' as expected. \r\n!sprint2.JPG|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nh4.
