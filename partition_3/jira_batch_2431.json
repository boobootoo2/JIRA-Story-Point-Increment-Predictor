      "description": "I make use of the three filters to hide pull requests with (My Approval, Open Tasks, Broken Builds)\n\nThese are definitely useful as a dev manager with visibility to many pull requests. One other filter that would be nice is an option to hide PRs that are \"Unwatched\" and perhaps make it checked by default. If someone has explicitly \"unwatched\" a pull request (unsubscribing from emails), it&#x27;s likely the case that it shouldn&#x27;t show up in the dashboard list. Adding approval without giving a full thoughtful review just to get the PR to disappear as an action item on the dashboard is not a good behavior.\n\nI believe this would mirror some nice functionality in GitHub (especially relevant for organization owning members) where the notifications dashboard shows all pull requests for the entire org (since the owner can see all of them), and the unsubscribe action can mark them as PRs that are handled autonomously by a team.\n\nthanks,\\\\\nandrew",

There is a ghost file that I cannot delete nor pull from the repository, and only apears in the webclient.\n\n----\n!3445803445-1.png|thumbnail!\n\n----\n!306186932-2.png|thumbnail!\n\nThe file was deleted in Intellij IDEA and later when I checked if the push was successful, there was a file with no commit and size, like is shown in the images. I tried to fix it by deleting both the project and the respository, wich I did 2 times, and setting them up again (*with the same names*), but the ghost file remained in the repository.\n\nThen I uploaded the project to a repository *with another name*, and there was no ghost file.\n\nMy conclusion is, there is some cache or space asigned to the name of the repository I&#x27;am trying to use, and it got corrupted.",
