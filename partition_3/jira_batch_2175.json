It would be great to be able to specify page watchers when creating a new blog post (just like specifying email recipients). Once the blog is saved, watchers would be notified right away.\n\nI know that users can watch all blogs in a given space, but that is not as convenient because the watcher then can't unsubscribe from the blogs they don't want to track.\n\nThanks and keep up the good work on Confluence.",

Please find a screenshot in attachment. \n\nBut some efforts needed.\n\nFirst, insert into /decorators/global.wmd  code\n{code}\n<content tag=\"tree\">\nsome users macro....\n</content>\n{code}\n\nThis action adds Splitbar to dashboard. But, when we are on Dashboard, Space is undefined. That is why error raising when rendering left menu on Dashboard.\n\nTo fix this, open doctheme.jar/doctheme/decorators/main.wmd\nFind the following code fragment\n{code}\n#if ($!docThemeHelper.getThemeHeader($spaceKey)!=\"\")\n    $!sitemeshPage.getProperty(\"page.theme-header\")\n#end\n{code}\n\nand replace it with:\n{code}\n#if ($spaceKey)\n    #if ($!docThemeHelper.getThemeHeader($spaceKey)!=\"\")\n        $!sitemeshPage.getProperty(\"page.theme-header\")\n    #end\n#end\n{code}\n\n\nSo, we need to make these changes every time when DocTheme updates. It will be nice to fix it and relax.\n\nBy the way, where does doctheme jar file lives after plugin installation? Usually it appears inside atlassian-bundled-plugins.zip in confluence-4.0/confluence/WEB-INF/classes/com/atlassian/confluence/setup.

Right now I can do something like this:\n\n1. Show all content where label = first OR label = second OR label = third\n2. Show all content where label = first AND label = second AND label = third\n\nWhat I would like to do is something like this:\n\n1. Show all content where (label = first AND label = second AND label = third) AND Not label = forth\n\nBasically that would like pages with all of those labels but not pages that include the final label. The use case for this is that we have built a nice page that shows all of our projects tagged with different labels that describe information about those projects such as priority. What I would like is when a label 'archive' is added to a page it will then automatically not show up on the project page. The old labels need to stay on the page for historical purposes.\n\nNote that this was submitted to support via this link: https://support.atlassian.com/browse/CSP-73759",

Instead of showing the value that is displayed in JIRA, it just takes the value straight from the database, and put it in to JIRA Issues macro.  For example: If the number is displaying in JIRA with no decimals, in Confluence it will display a decimal. \n\nh4.Findings\nJIRA is using some vm template to convert the value that is stored in database that makes it easier to be read by end user. However, for JIRA Issues Macro, it doesn't do the same thing, hence, making it difficult to be read by end user.\n\n!issues-macro-1.png|width=400! !issues-macro-2.png|width=400!\n\\\\\n\n!issues-macro-db.png|width=900!

The workaround is this:\n\n# Go to the page that you wish to export, and click \"Edit\"\n# On Chrome, press F12 to bring up the developer Console. (same shortcut key on Firefox as well, only if Firebug is installed as addon)\n# Click on Console\n# Run this command in the Console:\n{code}\ntinyMCE.activeEditor.getContent()\n{code}\n# Copy all of the XHTML content generated by the command\n# Paste it in a text file, and save it as a .html file. \nTo import,\n# Open the .html file in a browser.\n# Copy all contents shown in the browser (Ctrl+A, then Ctrl+C)\n# Create a new page in Confluence\n# Paste the contents into the page.\n\nIt would be nice to at least, auto generate these HTML files with a click of a button, for non tech savvy users.

For example, in a space with the following structure:\n\n* Home\n** Major Branch A\n*** Minor Branch\n** Major Branch B\n\nIf \"Minor Branch\" and \"Major Branch B\" are selected to be exported, \"Major Branch B\" would actually be displayed first in the resulting PDF, since it is at a higher level than the \"Minor Branch\" (2nd versus 3rd). In other words, Confluence looks from the root to the next major branch that is selected, rather than generating the PDF top-down.\n\nWhile this is logical, it may not be the way users expect PDF exports to work. It would be nice to add an option to generate the PDF based on the order displayed within Confluence, despite the pages' hierarchy level.

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFSERVER-24026].\n  {panel}\n\nThere are several related parts to this suggested improvement.\n\nRecommendations:\n1. Treat macros and all special editor objects (images, links, etc) the same - i.e. they would all have a frame.\n\n2. Display all of the associated parameters of the object (macro, image, link, etc) as text in the header of the objects frame not a subset and not with ...\n\n3. Allow the parameters in the frame to be edited as name value pairs and re-interpreted when focus leaves the frame.\n\n4. Treat the text in the frame header like other text and support cursor movement in/out and through it. Include the text in searches.\n\nReasoning (by #):\n1. Currently the new editor doesn't treat everything as equivalent.\n* This results in issues with where the insertion point moves during editing, what is selected, what gets cut or pasted, etc. Treating everything special (i.e. macros, images, links - things with parameters and/or bodies) as a framed object allows everything to be treated as an object, just like a character of text.\n* Providing the frame also now allows you to explicitly see what is inside and outside a special object and allows you to select the object. For example, there is currently no way to select a link. You can select text that is linked, you can select an image that is linked, but you can't select a link.\n\n2. By displaying all parameters on all macros and special objects it becomes obvious how a page is constructed.\n* Entering edit mode should expose all of the hidden information that is not visible when the page is rendered. Currently entering edit mode results in a subset of some parameters being displayed. This leads only to more confusion and requires the user to still having to enter a deeper edit mode (i.e. the macro browser or the special popups) to see the true values to edit. An edit mode within an edit mode is a huge productive hit. \n* A guiding rule should be \"While in edit mode the user will be able to inspect the page and see all the properties effecting how the page renders without needing to do any further activities.\" If this rule was true a majority of the productivity hit of the new editor would be resolved. To do this requires displaying all of the parameters of macros and special objects in their frame. For example, a warning macro's \"show icon\" is not shown in the frames parameters. This means that a users must hunt and peck across many instances if he is trying to identify one needing to be change.\n\n3. A productivity hit of the new editor is the need to enter a sub-edit mode (the macro editor or the special popups) when making a change to a parameter that is already applied to a macro or a link/image.\n* Allowing the name value parameter pairs in the frame to be edited would allow rapid changes to be made with a few keystrokes with no loss of user focus caused by having to visit a dialog.\n* Allowing new parameters to be added into the frame by just typing, for example \"width\" which is an obvious and easily remembered parameter on many macros, would allow common edits to occur quickly.\n* Parameters that could not be parsed after the edit completes (i.e. after focus leaves the frame) could be handled by highlighting or in a similar way to how firebugs lets users change the parameters in the html editor window.\n\n4. The new editor doesn't treat everything the same. All text, in the frame or body should be editable simple by moving up/down/left/right or clicking on it. If immediately above a macro then moving down or right should move you into the macro parameters. Moving to the end of the parameters and past (right arrow repeat) should take you into the body. Pressing down arrow should take you into the parameters, pressing down arrow again should move you into the body. Cut and paste should work within these areas as well as search and replace. To be productive the content, while special, needs to be treated as text. ",
