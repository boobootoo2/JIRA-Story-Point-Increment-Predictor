Summary\r\nCustomers who have customized the Columns in their Jira Issue/Filter Table macros in Confluence have noticed that some columns based on Custom Fields cannot be sorted\r\n\r\nh3. Environment\r\n- Cloud tested with Chrome (Version 64.0.3282.167 (Official Build) (64-bit)) and Firefox (58.0.2)\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Add a Jira Issue Macro to a Confluence Page and Configure the Display Option as a Table including Custom Fields like the Cascading List, Select List (single choice) or Text Field (single line) types\r\n# View the Page and attempt to sort by one of the Custom Field Columns\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nWhen Viewing the Confluence Page, we can sort based on these Custom Fields\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nMousing over the Columns does not allow us to Click on the Column Headers for Some Custom Field Types:\r\nFrom testing it seems like Select List (single choice) or Text Field (single line) Custom Fields are not sortable and show a regular mouse cursor:\r\n!NoSort-SingleChoiceField.png|thumbnail! \r\nWhereas sortable columns are highlighted and can be clicked:\r\n!SortStatus.png|thumbnail! \r\n \r\nh3. Notes\r\nUser and Date Picker Custom Fields along with regular System Fields (Status, Priority, Summary, Description) appear to be sortable without issues\r\nThis appears to be intermittent as customers have reported being able to sort these Custom Fields; may work on an initial page load but not after a refresh\r\n\r\nh3.Workaround\r\n* Sort the Table through the JQL used on the Macro; this will not allow you to change the sort but at least put the order based on the Unsortable Custom Field\r\n* Wait for ~24 hours and check the column again",

I will have to type _my_ to have the label displayed in the list.\r\n\r\nh3.

Although one of those versions is affected by a strange behavior where sometimes it requires users to \"Login and Approve\" in order to view its contents, and after the user login and approves the gadget, the button never goes away. Basically, the difference between both Activity Streams is the URL that it is called upon.\r\n\r\nThe screenshot below describes the situation better:\r\n !Screen Shot 2018-02-13 at 14.22.37.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\nAs you can see above, there are two gadgets for the same functionality, but only one of them works without any issues.

      "description": "I'm a big fan of Confluence and the new design is starting to resonate with me.\r\n\r\nMy biggest suggestion is to improve the collaboration piece for editing docs. We used to use Google Docs and that made it a lot easier to leave/respond/act on comments than we can on Confluence. I realize it may be harder to do versioning but I think there's more you can do here.\r\n\r\nSome ideas on how to improve the editing/collaboration experience:\r\n- When loading a page with comments automatically expand them (similar to Google Docs)\r\n- Somehow see the comments when editing a page so you can address them in the same tab\r\n- Ways of doing quick/minor edits inline without going through the full edit flow - maybe this can be non versioned and non notified as well.\r\n\r\nI'm sure I can think of more ideas and would be glad to share them!",

The only way I have found to add open disc/circle bullets to indented bullet lists is to add the Fancy Bullets macro, which is completely inefficient and time consuming. Hitting tab also just keeps the bullets as a closed disc. A drop down in the Bullet List icon which includes closed disc, open disc, square, etc. options\u00a0(as found in MS Word) seems like an obvious function to add into Confluence editor. I understand that hitting dash and tab adds a square bullet, but there is no simple way to add an open disc bullet.\u00a0 I've searched online but have found no solutions that don't include macros or coding.\u00a0 Please advise.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nThank you for your attention.",
