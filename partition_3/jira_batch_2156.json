This analytics feature is available for our Premium edition users. Here you\u2019ll be able to see details about search terms including their click through rate, total number of searches and number of individual users who are looking for that query, with more functionality coming soon! We\u2019re thrilled to finally close out this long-lived ticket!\u00a0\r\n\r\nDocumentation for this is available here:\u00a0[https://support.atlassian.com/confluence-cloud/docs/view-insights-on-your-site/|https://community.atlassian.com/t5/Confluence-articles/Copy-a-hierarchy-of-pages-in-Confluence-Cloud/ba-p/1439350]\r\n\r\nThank you again for persisting with us on this feature suggestion and for sharing your feedback. For any further improvement suggestions that haven\u2019t been addressed in this change, please open a new ticket so that we can gauge interest and feedback for each request.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nEmily Ditchfield\r\nProduct Manager, Confluence Cloud\r\n{panel}\r\nh4. Request Background\r\n\r\nCurrently, Confluence does not provide the ability to logged search queries run by users. Having this information will allow administrator to compile data such as the necessary content that is not in Confluence yet.\r\n\r\nThis will also help to arrange the information architecture to their behavior and to feed the Synonym plugin.\r\nh4. Potential workarounds\r\n\r\nThis information can be captured as part of access logging through Tomcat Valve ([instructions|https://confluence.atlassian.com/confkb/audit-confluence-using-the-tomcat-valve-component-223216846.html]). The below is an example of what Tomcat's access logging looks like when someone searches for \"Example Search Query\":\r\n{code:java}\r\n[17/Mar/2017:16:37:57 -0500] admin Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_11_4) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/57.0.2987.98 Safari/537.36 0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1 GET GET /confluence/dosearchsite.action?queryString=Example+Search+Query HTTP/1.1 6651 200 http-nio-55912-exec-3\r\n{code}\r\nIf you have this type of logging enabled, either in Tomcat itself or in a reverse proxy, look for \"dosearchsite.action\" and parse out the data after \"queryString=\".",

Confluence does not.\n\n\n+Using wildcards could be a workaround+ only when searching for the first item in a dot-separated string: \"MyClass.MyMethod()\" can be found by querying _MyClass*_, but _*MyMethod()\" won't work (as per CONF-9158).

In the end, the customer would be rejected due to wrong password or missing due to being point to a different domain.\n\nSome solution should be implemented to avoid different user with same username are having conflict on login into Confluence.\n\nCurrent Workaround:\n* Use a different attribute for username such as email during the setup of second directory in Confluence.

Alternately, clicking a link to an attachment could have a popup similar to in the editor, where it gives you the option to either download the file or navigate to the viewfile viewer for it.\n\nThis could potentially be something at the global and/or space default level to enable this mode or not, since some installations/spaces might prefer to have direct links.  Or it could even be an option on the link itself (default action on click = preview/download).\n\n(My apologies if this is a duplicate, I tried searching and didn't find anything that exactly met what I was hoping for).",

When I re-open for editing to check the link, it is gone.\n\nAfter entering a hyperlink in a page and verifying that it works, the link is replaced with \"nofollow\" in <a href> when I save.\nh4. Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Create a page and add a link to a local file.\n(i.e. [file:////server/path/file.txt|file:///server/path/file.txt])\n\n2. Save the page and confirm that the link is working. In page source we can see:\n{code:java}\n<a href=\"file:////server/path/file.txt\" class=\"external-link\" rel=\"nofollow\">file:////server/path/file.txt</a>\n{code}\n3. Edit the page - don't need to actually edit, just enter in edit mode to trigger the bug and then exit.\n\n4. The link doesn't work anymore.

The default is probably 5 to 10 minutes, but some users have set it as small as 30 seconds.\n\nThe office integration uploads the file every time when there is a new time stamp, not only when the content was actually changed by the user. \n\nSo, while the user has the file open for editing for some time and goes to lunch, he has many new versions created in Confluence although nothing has been changed.\n\n\nThis eats up resources, both disk space and network traffic, unnecessarily.\n\nSuggestions:\na) do not upload the auto-recover files at all, but only when the office application has been ended (or the Save button pressed explicitly)\nb) only create a new version if anything has changed in the file. There is no need to create a new version which has no change compared to the previous version. This would be in line with the behavior of saving pages in the editor.   (I don't know whether some bits within the file might have changed due to different time stamp? This would make it a bit difficult)",

If not, please feel free to change the location of this feature request\n\nAccording to our [Atlassian support request|https://support.atlassian.com/browse/CSP-94613?focusedCommentId=3247890&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-3247890] we really like to see an option to change emails and the way they look once for all our Atlassian products (JIRA, Confluence, FishEye) in use.\n\nReferencing to our latest Confluence upgrade and the quote below we'd really like to have the opportunity to change the look & feel of emails triggered by atlassian products to accomplish the company's CI.\n\n{quote}\nRight now, emails are a real distaster because there is no centralized system which deals with emails. So customizations like a modified footer etc. won't work, because there are too many different plugins which trigger email notifications.\n\nAt first step it would be already helpful to just standardise the email look & feel.\n\nFor example:\n@-Mention uses different fonts, different footer than the email for \"page edited\" -> so it has a different look & feel\n* This is a problem with different plugins triggering emails -> those should all user central code parts and include them dynamically as needed.\n\nOne more really frustrating thing is customizing email's look & feel.\n\nThere should really exist the possibility to configure some elements like footer in the admin console of confluence.\n{quote}\n\nAs every company has its own CI - I guess this would be a great improvement for your tools.\n\nCheers Christopher",

For example, if you add two Page Properties macros on a page, one with the label \"risk\" and the other with the label \"status\", both sets of metadata will appear in the Page Properties Report macro for the \"status\" label and for the \"risk: label. This is true even if you have specified just one label in each Page Properties macro. It is the labels on the page that matter, not the labels in the macros.{quote}\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. Create a page with a page properties macro. In that macro, add a table that looks like this:\n|| a | 1 |\n|| b | 2 |\n2. In that macro, give it a label 'prop1'\n3. Add another page property macro on that page, give it the label 'prop2' with the contents:\n|| c | 3 |\n|| d | 4 |\n4. Save the page. Now create a new page in the space.\nIn that new page, create a page properties report macro and give it the label 'prop1'.\n\nOutcome: It reports on BOTH tables a, b, c and d.\n\nThis feature request is so that it only does it for a and b - because I haven't specified the 'prop2' label.

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFSERVER-28759].\n  {panel}\n\nHi guys,\nI really like the lightweight style of Confluence 5. The sidebar is really nice but there is one thing in the sidebar that I doesn't really like - the pagetree navigation. I think it forces me to do more clicks than the pagetree from the documentation theme. Additionally I can't get a nice overview from where I am and what content is around.\nIs there any way to customize the sidebar layout so that I get a \"full weight\" page tree in the sidebar? I don't want to miss the new features so I don't want to change to documentation theme but I also want to keep a nice overview. \nIf not, is there a way to keep the breadcrumbs always expanded (without page1/.../page3) ? Is there a way to prevent the sidebar of hiding childpages (displays only 3 or 4 and than he writes: +5 Pages). This costs additional clicks and I want to prevent it.\nthanks in advance, Riccardo",

The feature could be improved by ignoring those special characters when typing and filtering (as it is for example not so cool to type those on a english keyboard). For example:\n\nWe have a user with the name 'C\u00e9line'. When I do enter know 'Cel' Confluence does not propose me 'C\u00e9line' as it appears that the characters must match exactly. It would be nice that C\u00e9line gets proposed even though I am just entering a normal e instead of the \u00e9.\n\nI am not sure if my proposal is clear but in SQL this is related to the collation.\n\nThanks for listening and have a nice day!",

Implementation of either A or B would be acceptable for me, similar with slightly different advantages each.\n\nRelated issues: https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONF-23884, https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONF-28710",

This seems to have gone away in Confluence 4. Why??\n\nTo get the same behavior, I have to insert a full-size image, wait for it to redraw if I'm on a slow connection, and then type in \"200\" to get the right size.  There isn't even a click to get the former 200 pixel size.\n\nCan we just have the checkbox back, please?",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFSERVER-28720].\n  {panel}\n\nWe heavily use macro \"containers\" like the Numbered Headings plugin, and I noticed that page version comparisons don't seem to present the same \"terse\" delta of changes within a \"container\" that it does with content outside of a container.\n\nFor a decently large page where much of the content is inside a container, targeted changes end up with version comparisons distributed by email that are very hard to skim to understand the often small set of changes.  The same holds for comparisons pulled up in the Confluence web site.\n\nI established a test page for this that included a block of content that was at the top level of the page, a block of content inside an \"Info\" macro, and a block of content inside a NumberedHeadings macro.  After making a targeted change to each block, a version comparison tersely presents the delta for the top content block (that wasn't contained in a macro), while it includes the entirety of the two containers.\n\nIf my memory serves, an older version of Confluence might have had a \"jump to next difference\" set of anchor links on the left hand side, so re-introducing something like that could help mitigate this, but I would also think that it is probably reasonable to just show the same focused delta view within a container.\n\nI created a sample page in a Sandbox wiki space in my install.  I exported that page to the attached SANDBOX-120416-2.xml.zip, and I also attached a screen capture of the page contents itself, and a screen capture of the diff. I just changed the word \"fox\" to \"dog\" in each of its 3 occurrences on the page.\n\n_NOTE: I had originally brought this up under the Atlassian Answers forum, and hence the following thread could be commented on at https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/151202/suggestion-question-about-breakdown-in-terse-version-comparisons as this issue moves through its lifecycle._",

Our users do rely on having the pages created and populated with template data.\n\nDo be clear, for a few specific Jira projects we do want to have a wiki page for each issue. We already have jQuery code that is checking if the page already exists and links it to the jira issue, and if it doesn't exist it can try to create the page. Now there are some problems with this because it seems than with Confluence 4/5 there is not HTTP call that you can make to create a wiki page from a template.",
