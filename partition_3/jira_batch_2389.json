Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nConsidering that this pipeline runs on a merge commit, it would be desirable for some users to have the pipeline triggered when the destination branch changes as well.

Issue Summary\r\n* As per the title, whenever a PR is merged using the fast-forward strategy, you get the following error message when trying to revert it:\r\n{code}\r\nUnable to revert pull request\r\n\r\nThe resulting revert would cause conflicts on one or more files.

However, when installed on a certain workspace, they also gain read access to repos' source code as well. This may not be desirable by end-users who want to use a certain Bitbucket add-on, but without granting source code access to the add-on when it is not needed.\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nProvide more granular OAuth permissions for 'Repositories', e.g. separate permissions for commits, source, etc.\r\n This way, developers of add-ons can restrict the add-on permissions e.g. to commits only, providing better security.",
