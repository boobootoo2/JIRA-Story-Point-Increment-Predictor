      "description": "h3. Summary\r\nThrough the issues below:\r\n- [BSERV-7119|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/BSERV-7119]\r\n- [BSERV-4631|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/BSERV-4631]\r\n\r\nWe implemented a safety mechanism in case Stash/Bitbucket loses connection to an external management system and removes users from its cache.\r\n\r\nThis safety mechanism basically consists of:\r\n- In case Stash/Bitbucket loses connection to an external management system, there is a use case that Embedded Crowd will remove that user/group from its cache\r\n- In the past, we would just go ahead and delete that user and its personal data, groups membership, projects/repo permissions etc\r\n- The safety mechanism we apply is that in case that user returns to the LDAP (or the connection is re-established) and is re-synced, we are able to recover its personal data (SSH keys permissions) as well as permissions (global permission, project permission, repository permissions, branch permissions) because as opposed to removing the data from the database straight away, we keep them flagged for a period of time and run a daily job to remove the data that expired.\r\n- *Problem:* there is a use case that doesn't seem to have been covered, though. If the LDAP user was assigned to a local group in Stash/Bitbucket and this user is removed, this local group membership won't be recovered when the user is re-synced from the LDAP.\r\n- *Impact:* developers on that instance won't be able to push code because they will have become unlicensed due to not being in the local {{stash-users}} group\r\n\r\nh3. Environment\r\n* Stash 3.11.4\r\n* Configure an External Directory LDAP connection\r\n-- Set [LDAP permission as \"Read Only, with Local Groups\"|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/BitbucketServer/Connecting+Bitbucket+Server+to+an+existing+LDAP+directory#ConnectingBitbucketServertoanexistingLDAPdirectory-LDAPpermission]\r\n-- Add {{stash-users}} as \"Default Group Memberships\". Users will be added to this group (which is a local group) when they first log in. This will only be done once per user. These groups will be created if they don't already exist, but adding to {{stash-users}} will be the easiest set up as it already contains [Global permissions|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/STASH/Global+permissions] by default as \"Stash Users\".\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Create a LDAP directory with local group\r\n# Synchronise the users and add them to a local group (i.e {{stash-users}})\r\n# Sync up with Stash with the LDAP configured with local groups where the user automatically gets added to {{stash-users}}\r\n# Login with an LDAP user\r\n# Make sure the user has been added to {{stash-users}}\r\n# Remove the user from LDAP\r\n# Sync up Stash/LDAP\r\n# Add user back to LDAP\r\n# Sync\r\n\r\n{panel}\r\n(i) *In case you deleted your external directory...*\r\n\r\nNotice that if you delete your external directory from Stash/Bitbucket, that behaviour is expected and it is _not_ a bug.\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nUsers previously linked to the {{stash-users}} group should come back to Stash/Bitbucket and get all their previous memberships.\r\n\r\nJust like we currently do for permissions, personal data and memberships, this membership shouldn't be deleted straight away. \r\n\r\nWe should flag them and have them cleaned up later on by the daily job.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nAll of the users from the LDAP directory are removed from the {{stash-users}} local group and become unlicensed. The membership _is not_ restored.\r\n \r\nh3.Workaround\r\n\r\n*Default Group Memberships option is in use:*\r\nThe \"Read Only, with Local Groups\" option allows you to choose a _Default Group Membership_ option which means:\r\n{quote}\r\n_Users, groups and memberships are retrieved from your LDAP server and cannot be modified in Bitbucket. Users from LDAP can be added to groups maintained in Bitbucket's internal directory._\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nThe above is a copy from the application UI. If that's the case for you, in order to restore their licensing status, have the users login to the web interface and they will be added back into {{stash-users}}.\r\n\r\n*Default Group Memberships option is not in use:*\r\n\r\nYou can do that manually using the UI (assign the users to the desired local group). An alternative to do it programmatically using the REST API is described on:\r\n- [Adding 'n' number of users in a Stash group|https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/5703300/adding-n-number-of-users-in-a-stash-group.]\r\n\r\nCheck out [BSERV-4117|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/BSERV-4117] to obtain a list of the users that have been logging in to your instance recently.",

Ie. in the future would we be able to identify with confidence the author of a particular change/commit.\r\n\r\nThis is because Git requires that the user self enter their name and email address in their local Git configuration (which by default is not setup).  There is no \u2018single sign on\u2019 or LDAP integration of the Git tools with any identity authority system.\r\n\r\nThe authorship information specified on the machine is then added to every commit that user makes.\r\n\r\nBy default Stash accepts every commit and does not verify or validate that the user submitting (pushing) the commits is the same person recorded in the commit itself.\r\n\r\nThis raises the possibility that someone could impersonate another person and make a commit under a different name.\r\n\r\nIt would be very hard to determine who the original committer/author was, as no IP address or machine name information is recorded which could be used to trace this.\r\n\r\nIn addition, depending on how locked down a repository is, it is possible for someone (or at least the repository administrator) to go back through commit history to either remove a commit that was made, alter it or change the authorship of a commit.\r\n\r\nThis clearly raises a few concerns from.\r\n\r\nIt therefore seems prudent that some checks are performed on Stash to govern and control this.\r\n\r\nI believe there are some plugins that might help, like the \u201cYet Another Commit Checker\u201d which can validate that the person pushing the changes is the person recorded in the commit.  Although these could also be switched off at the repository level and so circumvented by the administrator and it does not help with the rewriting of history.\r\n\r\nAny plugin would have to work with the Git rebasing mechanism that is being used by teams to bring in changes to their branches.\r\n\r\nAn additional plugin that would help would be one to enforce that all changes undergo a pull request/code review and that all changes are therefore reviewed and approved by the team/gatekeeper prior to committing.",

      "description": "h3. Summary\r\nWhen 3.10.0 was released the logic of branch permissions was changed so that \"Restrictions should always be applied to achieve the most restrictive subset.\" A subsequent bug was created [BSERV-7597|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/BSERV-7597], and the permissions were switched back to the way they were originally. Currently you just need permission from any pattern that matches. If one of the patterns denies permission and another one allows it, access is allowed. \r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Problem\r\nThere are certain cases in which the branch logic that was fixed are necessary. For instance:\r\n\r\nYou have 3 groups of users: \r\n- Contractors: who only are allowed to commit to bugfix branches.\r\n- Developers: who are allowed to write anywhere in the repository, except when a release branch is locked down in preparation for release. \r\n- Admins: Have full permissions and manage release branches.   \r\n\r\nIdeally you would want branch permissions set up so that Admins and Developers have the following branch permissions for read and write: {{release/**}}. \r\n\r\nWhen a branch is frozen for a release a new branch permission would be created for a specific release branch like {{release/2.2.0}} that are assigned to admins only. \r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Workarounds\r\n\r\n# Currently to achieve permissions that are this granular your best option would be to fork a repository within the same project. Contractors can commit to this fork and create pull requests into the original repo. You will only need to set one branch permission on the original repo for the release branch that is frozen and disallow write permission to the original repo for the Contractors. \r\n# Another option would be to manually add branch permissions to your Developers for each release branch like this:\r\n{code}\r\nrelease/2.2.0.0: Admins\r\nmaster: Developers\r\nrelease/2.1.*: Developers\r\nrelease/2.0.*: Developers\r\nrelease/2.3.*: Developers\r\nrelease/1.*: Developers\r\n{code}\r\nThis is not ideal, because branch permissions have to be set every time a branch is created to prevent the contractors from committing to it. \r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Solution:\r\n\r\nA way to toggle the logic used by branch permissions. If the default was to the current setting, long time customers wouldn't be affected by upgrades and those that need granular branch permissions could have it when they need it, on a repository by repository basis.
