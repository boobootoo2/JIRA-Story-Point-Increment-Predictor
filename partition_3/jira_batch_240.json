So our epic burndown chart is not complete because some issues were not assigned to an epic.\r\n\r\nTherefore we need to add closed issues of closed sprints to an epic to have the burndown chart complete.\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nAs according to the [documentation|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/GH/Adding+an+Issue+to+an+Epic], adding issues to Epic requires the issues at least to be visible on the planning board.\r\n\r\nWould like to suggest to enable a field or something similar to bulk edit option to include the filter result into an epic.",

Summary\r\n\r\nWhen attempting to render a board, if the JIRA instance has Issue Types or Statuses that are integers, it will prevent certain issues from being displayed on the board. They are still displayed in the Issue Navigator, however.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n# Create an issue with a Status of \"Open\".\r\n# Save a filter for that issue.\r\n# Create a new board with that filter.\r\n# Verify the issue appears.\r\n# Add a status of \"1\".\r\n# Check the board - the issue will vanished.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nThe issue does not disappear.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nThe issue does not appear on the board.\r\n\r\nh3. Notes\r\n\r\nThis appears to be caused by the JQL builder putting the id of the status (and also issue type) within a string. For example:\r\n\r\n{noformat}\r\n$ 2013-03-01 12:16:22,027 http-bio-8900-exec-4 DEBUG wonderwoman 736x4724x2 7hi14c 172.22.2.187 /rest/greenhopper/1.0/xboard/work/allData.json [issue.search.providers.LuceneSearchProvider] JQL query: {issuekey = \"sfti-825\"} AND ( {fixVersion in unreleasedVersions()} OR {fixVersion is EMPTY} ) AND {status in (\"3\", \"10002\", \"1\", \"10005\", \"4\", \"10009\")}\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nIt should be querying them directly as a the literal integer, ie 1 vs \"1\".",
      "summary": "The JQL builder puts the ID of Status and Issue Types as a string and this can cause no issues to be returned"
