Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Create a Pull request on Bitbucket\r\n # Make sure the user who you would like to add has access to this repository\r\n # Deactivate user's account via Active Directory (for managed account)\r\n # Use the inactive user UUID to update the PR and try to add him as a reviewer\r\n\r\n[https://developer.atlassian.com/bitbucket/api/2/reference/resource/repositories/%7Bworkspace%7D/%7Brepo_slug%7D/pullrequests/%7Bpull_request_id%7D#put]\r\n\r\n\u00a0 \u00a05.

Workaround\r\n\r\nThe workaround for the user is to go Bitbucket UI and check if the user he is trying to add as a reviewer is Active or not.
