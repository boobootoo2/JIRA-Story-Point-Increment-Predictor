I believe the pages were not shown in the \"Pages\" tab because the Space homepage was not set.\n\nErroneously, I subsequently deleted the Space, when it should not have been deleted.\n\nIn future I will check *Space Tools > Content Tools > Reorder Pages* and *Space Tools > Content Tools > Attachments* before I delete a Space. However, I find the three empty tabs very misleading and I think a lot of other users will too.\n\nI had to spend a considerable number of hours with Atlassian Cloud support in order to restore an earlier back-up, export the Space and re-import into Confluence.\n\nI suggest making it more explicit that the Space may not be empty in order to avoid wasting users (and Atlassian's) time.\n\nBest wishes,\n\nGary Bates\n\n\u00a0",

It even reaches that far:\n\nEditor\u00a0A and B are working on the same page. A closes the page without publishing it, but clicks *Keep draft*. If A starts editing the page again, the draft is there, everything is OK. If, on the other hand, B closes\u00a0the page and selects *Discard everyone's changes*, this will alter A's draft as well, removing everything A has worked on.\n\nThere should at least be a way (or automatism) for all other concurrent editors to save their work or either some sort of a voting mechanism.\n\nThere will be nothing more frustrating than working heavily on a page and then get the own work \"destroyed\" (accidentally or on purpose, doesn't matter) by\u00a0another person.\u00a0\n\nI already expressed my concern about this way of doing it while Confluence 6.0 was still in EAP, but sadly you did not listen (at all).\n\nSo... to set Collaborative editing as the new feature of all features (which it is... IMHO), PLEASE, for gods sake, rework the way changes are discarded!",

But the key of working in confluence is to know which macros you can/should use. And that information is hard to see as a new user (or existing one) as the features are \"hidden\" in the +\u00a0-> other macros menu. Also it takes many clicks to get to the correct macro sometimes...\n\nAnd it takes time to get the knowledge on which macros should be used...\n\nSo my suggestion to fix this is to take inspiration from the ribbon used in office. Imaging having a similar menu in confluence where you could group the macros/plugins and having a small image for each macro for example.\n\n!ribbon.png!\n\nBut since you have user data of users: why not also add a menu group bar with the \"top used macros\", trending macros, admin suggested macros aswelll..\n\nAnd also add to the most right in the menu a quick search for macros, which could function just like the Search tool \"Search JIRA admin\" which is used when logging in to\u00a0the administration section of lira.\n\n\u00a0\n\nBy doing the above changes I think the plugin usage in confluence would not only get easier for existing users, but for new users it would boost their confluence usage from the beginning.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0",

Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nMy suggestion is that when a list of label suggestions is presented and the one is selected that it is added automatically. \u00a0This would streamline the process and be more intuitive.\r\n # Click the \"Edit labels\" icon\r\n # Type in the full name or a label OR part of the name\r\n # When presented with a list of suggestions click on the appropriate label\r\n # Click \"Close\"\r\n\r\nOR, better yet... \u00a0Do what JIRA does. \u00a0Offer a drop-down list of labels and a field that supports a reactive list of possible matches. \u00a0When an item is selected it is added to the field automatically. \u00a0The challenge here is that the list of possible labels could be large.\u00a0",

Problem Definition\nRemoving page restrictions on a space is quite time consuming and not user friendly for Confluence administrators especially if there are many restrictions for multiple pages. The user has to click on all locks, preferably in a new tab otherwise they get redirected to a restricted access page, in order to remove all page restrictions to finally get access to the restricted pages.\n\nFor instance, it is an issue during Confluence migration as the new admin will not necessarily have permissions to view all pages and the previous user that has set the restrictions does not exist anymore.\n\nh3. Suggested Solution\nProvide a solution, either as a button in the *Restricted Pages* tab in *Space permissions*, in order to remove all restrictions for one page or all pages at once.\n\nh3. Workaround \nRight-click and open in a new tab when clicking on a lock will allow to stay on the Restricted Pages tab to continue removing all restrictions.

Summary\nUsing some operations are causing vertical spacing between the macros to be stripped out as {{auto-cursor-target}} class is applied.\n\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\nSteps to reproduce:\n# Start creating a newpage\n# Insert a block macro (e.g. the info macro)\n# Insert another macro below the first (e.g. another info macro)\n# In the space between the two macros, add a line break (in the editor DOM there are now two paragraphs between the macros - one with the {{auto-cursor-target}} class and one without)\n# Click on preview and observe that there is vertical spacing between the macros\n# Perform one of the \"user operations\" listed below - do this below the two macros to make the effect clearer to observe (in the editor DOM, both paragraphs between the macros now have the {{auto-cursor-target}} class applied)\n# Click on preview and observe that the vertical spacing between the macros has been stripped out\n\nUser operations known to cause this issue:\n* Wiki autoformatting (e.g. when you type {{h2.}} followed by a space to trigger heading formatting)\n* Cutting content (e.g. via {{cmd + v}} shortcut)\n\nThis issue is only reproducible on instances that do *not* have the collaborative editing feature enabled.\nh3. Expected Results\nThe spaces are not modified\n\nh3. Actual Results\nVertical spacing between the macros were stripped out.\n\nh3.Workaround\nUse operations on the top menu when available, such as selecting a text and making it title, instead of using {{h2.}}.\n\n",

Description\n\nIf it is necessary to have multiple site-admins' in a JIRA instance, *Site-Admin* should be able to control who has the 'Login as User' ability and when it is used a notification could be sent to a group of users.\n\nh3. Example\n\nAdmin user A and admin user B, user A has the ability to 'login as user' they are both in the same *site-admin* group and if admin user A uses this ability an email should be sent to all users inside *site-admin* group.\n\nE.g:\n\nAn example of the message to all users in *site-admin* or *administrators* group. \"User A has impersonated User C using the 'log in as user' feature.\"\n\nh3. Suggestion\n\nImplement a configuration where the 'log in as user' ability could be optional, for users inside *site-admin* and when used trigger an email to all users in *site-admin* group.",

Publish it.\n* Click edit to start a new draft.\n* Go to the attachments screen of the page and delete the attached image\n* Go back to the page and press edit\n\n*Actual behaviour*\n\n* The editor still shows the attachment\n\n*Expected behaviour*\n\n* The editor should show \"Unknown attachment\"\n\nThis happens because the editor format of the page changes even though the page does not get edited. However, Synchrony still has the old editor format.\n\nThis is also true for links and macros. For example, deleting a page that was linked to from another page results in this same behavior, as well as deleting a plug-in while one of its macros is used on a page. The page in edit mode still looks like the macro is present even though in view mode it shows up as \"Unknown macro.\"\n\n*Workaround*\n\nThe workaround is to publish the page if this happens. Publishing the page forces Synchrony to get the new editor format. The editor format will now say correctly \"Unknown attachment\" or \"Unknown macro\" or will point to a non-existent link.

Problem summary \nAccording to https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Page+Restrictions, the Request Access feature works by notifying users who are able to grant restriction access to a page, using this logic in order:\n{quote}\n# The last person to edit the page\n# *All* non-admin users that can set permissions on the page (given that an admin user can always set permissions)\n# The page creator\n# *All* the space administrators\n{quote}\n\nStep 4 is failing. No space admins are notified despite space permission settings. What appears to be happening instead is that a single Confluence superuser (i.e. a member of the \"confluence-administrators\" group) will be notified. If there are more than one user in this group, the first username on this list, sorted alphabetically, will be sent the request access notification. This user does not need to be in a space administrator for the relevant content. In fact, it doesn't matter who is a space admin on that space, as that configuration does not appear to affect the behavior.\n\nh2. Steps to reproduce\n# Set up a Confluence\n# Create 5 users:\n** UserA\n** UserB\n** UserC\n** SuperX - place this user in confluence-administrators group (superuser)\n** SuperY - place this user in confluence-administrators group (superuser)\n# Create a space with UserA, so that this user is automatically a space admin\n# Create a page with UserB within this space\n# Using SuperX, restrict the page so that only SuperX can view it\n# Using UserC, try to view the page by going to the page URL directly. The user cannot see it, and will be asked to request access. Click through.\n\nh2. Expected behavior\nUserA receives the notification, because although he is not the page creator or the last person to edit the page, he is a full space admin and can set page restrictions.\n\nh2. Actual behavior\nSuperX receives the notification, because he is the first superuser alphabetically.\n\nNow rename SuperX to SuperZ, and repeat step 6. Observe that now SuperY is the one who receives the notification, since that is the first superuser alphabetically.\n\nh2. Additional notes\nThere are actually two parts this is issue:\n* Space admins are being ignored in the Request Access logic\n* Only one admin is notified, not all, as detailed in the documentation",
