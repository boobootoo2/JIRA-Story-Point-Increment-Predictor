The ability to control the size of the in-lined ppt slide is important to me, and as far as I can tell, the options to set height and width are independent of each other, and I don't see a way to set just the height or just the width, and have the other dimension automatically scale proportionally. So, I often end up with a distorted image, or having to take the extra steps to manually calculate the correct \"other value.\"\n\nI'm hoping you could have a checkbox to say \"scale proportionally\" or maybe even have an unspecified dimension automatically behave that way if the other dimension is constrained.  Or maybe just do something like for your \"Image\" widget that just has a single \"Resize image to specific width\" field that does proportional scaling.\n\nAlso, I wasn't sure whether this issue should have been tracked under the Office Connector (OFFCONN) JIRA project instead.",

This feature was removed due to observed low feature usage, in addition with our strategic focus to simplify the Confluence user interface and to keep and complex JIRA operations in JIRA. My apologies for the may customers that were quickly impacted by this, we could have done a better job in communicating this and ensuring we had understood your needs with regards to this matter. \n\nSince then we've received a lot of feedback to bring back pagination. Thank you for those of you who provided helpful comments below, and for those customers we have been able to speak to about this. With this in mind, we have concluded the following:\n\n* It is very clear that the current issue limit we have is insufficient and does not meet most of your needs. \n* It is important for you to be able to see _all_ the issues requested \n* We still believe that the use case of navigating 100+ issues within inside Confluence is something that is extremely low and is something which should be done in JIRA. \n* Some of you mentioned of the importance of seeing this also in PDF exports when you share the release notes or pages with customers. \n\nWith that in mind, what will we be doing to address this?\n1. We will look at increasing the limit of the total number of visible issues\n2. In addition, we will look at providing a parameter to configure this.\n*Note:* You will always be limited by the total amount of issues JIRA provides, but [this setting can be changed|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/ONDEMANDKB/Changing+maxResults+Parameter+for+JIRA+REST+API].\n3. We will be looking at also implementing CONF-30114 (sorting) to assist with dealing with larger issue lists in Confluence. \n\nThank you all for your patience in this matter, we will update this issue as we make progress. \n\nSherif Mansour\nConfluence Product Manager\n\nPrevious description: \n{panel}\nThe new JIRA issues macro does not paginate. This feature request is to help us better understand why customers want this. \nIf you are going to comment on this ticket, please provide some understanding for why you want pagination. We removed this feature because we saw very low usage of it. Since then, we've had a few requests to bring it back. \n\nOne way we could solve the majority use case is to increase the default amount of search results displayed. We are a bit hesitant to bring this back as we want to understand what it is that we are missing. If you are embedding 50/100+ issues on a page and want pagination, you probably shouldn't be doing that in Confluence, but rather the JIRA issue navigator - that is why we tell you \"there are xxx more issues, open in JIRA\". \n\nPlease help us understand why you want this and some examples where you really do have lots of issues on a page that you want your end-users to read (if that is the use case)\n{panel} ",

Within each product space, we branch pages off for development, product management, implementation teams, etc. It's very useful for us to have all these various teams in the same umbrella space for the product. However, multiple teams within the space would like to have a blog related to that product and we currently have the ability to create only a single blog for the whole space. I could move all of product management out into a separate space, but they're still going to want to create blogs per product or project. If I create a space for each team for each product or project, our space list will be enormous. Allowing multiple blogs, perhaps by a page branch, within the same space would make Confluence much more useful for us.",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFSERVER-30080].\n  {panel}\n\nBlueprints use web items to appear inside the Create dialog. You can use a condition in this web item to control the visibility of the blueprint. Currently there is only the space (as selected in the Create dialog) and the curent user available in the condition's context.\n\nSince the Create dialog is called in the context of a specific page it would be great to have the current page available in this context.\n\nIn my specific case, I wrote a condition that renders true when a specific macro is being used on the current page.\n\n\n*Workaround*\nMy little hacky workaround is as follows. \n\nFirst of all, the current page's id must be transmitted via the REST request for the web-items. I used this code to override the default request code:\n\n{code:javascript}\nAJS.toInit(function ($) {\n\n    Confluence.Blueprint.Dialog.requestWebItems = function requestWebItems(spaceKey) {\n        Confluence.Blueprint.Dialog.loadedWebitems = Confluence.Blueprint.Dialog.loadedWebitems || {};\n        var data = Confluence.Blueprint.Dialog.loadedWebitems[spaceKey];\n        if (data) {\n            return AJS.$.Deferred().resolveWith(data);\n        }\n        return $.ajax({\n            url: Confluence.getContextPath() + \"/rest/create-dialog/1.0/blueprints/web-items\",\n            dataType: \"json\",\n            data: {\n                spaceKey: spaceKey,\n\n                //////////////////////////////////////\n                //////////////////////////////////////\n                // THIS IS THE NEW PARAMETER /////////\n                currentPageId: AJS.Meta.get('page-id')\n                //////////////////////////////////////\n                //////////////////////////////////////\n            }\n        }).done(function(data) {\n            Confluence.Blueprint.Dialog.loadedWebitems[spaceKey] = data;\n        });\n    };\n});\n{code}\n\nInside my condition I have the following method to get the associated Page object:\n\n{code:java}\n    private Page getCurrentPage() {\n\n        HttpServletRequest request = ServletContextThreadLocal.getRequest();\n\n        long currentPageId = 0L;\n        try {\n            // note: this parameter is only there because of the overridden JavaScript functionality (see blueprint-wizard.js)\n            currentPageId = Integer.parseInt(request.getParameter(PARAM_PAGEID));\n        }\n        catch (Exception e) {\n\n            // page id could not be parsed --> no current page available\n            LOG.warn(\"Error while parsing the current page id\", e);\n            return null;\n        }\n\n        return pageManager.getPage(currentPageId);\n    }\n{code}",

Steps to reproduce\n# In JIRA, create a project with a key of TEST\n# Create one issue under TEST\n# On the Confluence editor, use Insert > JIRA Issue, and set the JQL to \"project=TEST\". Save the macro and page. One issue is shown\n# Create another issue under TEST\n# Refresh the Confluence page. The second issue does not appear until the cache is expired, or if it's flushed manually via Confluence Admin > Cache Statistics\n\nA workaround solution, You can remove the cache by following steps: \n# Go to the page \"Confluence Admin >> Cache Statistics >> Advanced\"\n# Search for the term \"JIRA Issues\". \n# Change the value from \"100\" (default) to \"1\" \n# Click the button \"Adjust Size\" to enable the change. \n\nh4. Other issues\nThis is a related but separate issue from CONF-22845, which addresses the original JIRA Issues macro.",

This requires us to clarify each document or page and report on those classifications.\n\nWe recently added this in our sharepoint instance and are looking to see if Atlassian could support this function in confluence. We were thinking something like page labels but with the following requirements:\n\n1. at the site or space level, require all content, attachments, etc to be classified. Similar to page labels but users can't remove a classification once added.\n2. Report on classifications by type, space, etc.\n3. support for attachments and other elements.\n\nExamples classifications:\nPublic:  Information that is available to the general public and/or is created with the intention for broad distribution outside the company.  This information may be freely disseminated inside and outside the company without exposing the company, its customers or employees to financial loss or embarrassment, or jeopardizing the security of the company\u2019s assets.\n \nInternal:  Information belonging to the company that is created in the normal course of business with the intention of broad, general distribution within (but not outside) the company.  The disclosure, alteration or destruction of such information would create minimal risk of harm to the company, its customers or employees.  Information classified as Internal should not be shared publicly or outside the company, unless there is a legitimate business need.\n \nConfidential:  Information that is sensitive to the company or a third party, such as a customer, and that should only be shared with individuals on a \u201cneed to know\u201d basis, meaning that an individual needs access to the information to perform his or her assigned job functions.  Improper loss, corruption or disclosure of the information could significantly harm or adversely impact the company, its customers or employees or could result in a breach of our legal obligations. \n \nHighly Sensitive:  Information where the unauthorized internal or external access to, alteration or inappropriate destruction of, the information could have a catastrophic impact to the company, its customers or employees.  For this information, data integrity is extremely vital and the highest possible levels of confidentiality, restricted access and security measures are essential. ",

[See the corresponding bug report|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFSERVER-30050].\n  {panel}\n\n{panel:title=Update from Atlassian|borderStyle=solid|borderColor=#3C78B5| titleBGColor=#3C78B5| bgColor=#E7F4FA}\nThis issue has been resolved in Confluence 5.9.8.\n\nThe fix we implemented is in the front end, and stops duplicate user records from displaying anywhere in Confluence - in the People Directory, Shares, or Mentions. The underlying duplicates may still exist in the database, and new duplicates may be created, however these are harmless and can be safely ignored. As of Confluence 5.9.8, you should no longer see duplicate users anywhere in Confluence.\n{panel}\n\nh3. Symptoms\n* Users appear twice in the People Directory, in shares, and mentions\n* Users have two USERINFO records with no 'prevver' value (ie two current records), eg:\n{code}\nselect * from content where contenttype like 'USERINFO' and prevver is null;\n{code}\n(i) USERINFO records that do *not* have an entry in prevver are the currently active records. This is a little counter-intuitive given the name of the field, however older records that are no longer active contain the id of the superseding record in prevver. If prevver is null, the record is considered active.\n\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\n\nThis may not be the only way to have this happen, but doing the following sequence will cause this to happen:\n\n# Create a user in an LDAP server, which you want to test with\n# Set up the LDAP server in Confluence\n# Synchronise\n# Log in as that user and possibly add some extra profile information such as a picture/description\n# Disable the LDAP directory\n# Rename that user in the LDAP server\n# Create a new LDAP directory exactly the same\n# Synchronise\n\nh3. Known Triggers\nThis has been confirmed to occur on upgrade to 5.1.3, and possibly earlier or later versions.\n\nh3. Case Study\n* These 3 users were duplicated as part of the upgrade to 5.1.3 (some irrelevant columns have been removed for ease of reading):\n||contentid||\tcontenttype||\tversion||\tcreator||\tcreationdate||\tlastmodifier||\tlastmoddate||\tprevver||\tcontent_status||\tusername||\n|22217497|\tUSERINFO|\t1|\tan.admin|\t10/05/2013\t|an.admin|\t10/05/2013|\t\t|current|\tUSER1|\n|24248321|\tUSERINFO|\t1|\t\t|7/06/2013\t|\t|7/06/2013|\t\t|current|\tuser1|\n|917505|\tUSERINFO|\t3|\tadmin|\t12/03/2012\t|user2|\t14/12/2012|\t\t|current|\tuser2|\n|24248322|\tUSERINFO|\t1|\t\t|7/06/2013|\t|\t7/06/2013|\t\t|current|\tUSER2|\n|1409789|\tUSERINFO|\t1|\tUSER3|\t29/03/2012|\tUSER3|\t29/03/2012|\t\t|current|\tUSER3|\n|24248323|\tUSERINFO|\t1|\t\t|7/06/2013|\t|\t7/06/2013|\t\t|current|\tuser3|\n\nNB: Note the casing above - the 1st and 3rd records were originally uppercase, the second was originally lowercase.\n\n* All 3 duplicates were created on June 7th. This was in the logs:\n{code}\n2013-06-07 19:40:39,244 INFO [main] [confluence.upgrade.upgradetask.UserIndexingUpgradeTask] doUpgrade Found 3 usernames that need PersonalInformation created.\n{code}\n\n* I originally suspected that the casing of the usernames may have changed, but the users are currently in the original casing in cwd_user (upperfor USER1 and USER3, and lower for user2). \n\n* There was a warning regarding a case change for user2, going back as far as October 2012 (found in old support case) : \n{code}\n2013-06-10 09:22:11,856 WARN [http-8080-40] [atlassian.crowd.directory.DelegatedAuthenticationDirectory] updateLdapUser remote username [ USER2 ] casing differs from local username [ user2 ]. User details will be kept updated, but the username cannot be updated\n{code}\n\n* All 3 users are LDAP user accounts. This is a Delegated Authentication directory, and not a synchronising Connector type.\n\nh3. Diagnosis - is this affecting you?\nFirst, try a content reindex. If this doesn't help, run this query (on any version). If it returns any results, this bug is the cause of your duplicates.\n{code}\nSELECT c.username\n      FROM CONTENT c\n      WHERE\n        contenttype LIKE 'USERINFO'\n        AND prevver is null\n          GROUP BY c.username\n          HAVING count(c.username)>1;\n{code}\nIf this query returns nothing, have a look at CONF-36018 as well.\n\n\nh3. Work Around\n# Stop Confluence\n# Make a [full database and file system backup|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Production+Backup+Strategy]\n# Run this command to find the usernames of affected users - ensure these match what you are seeing in the People Directory before deleting\n{code}\n// FOR CONFLUENCE 5.3 AND ABOVE\nSELECT m.username FROM content c\n JOIN user_mapping m ON c.username = m.user_key\n  WHERE c.username IN\n    (SELECT c.username\n      FROM CONTENT c\n      WHERE\n        contenttype LIKE 'USERINFO'\n        AND prevver is null\n          GROUP BY c.username\n          HAVING count(c.username)>1)\n    GROUP BY m.username;\n\n// FOR CONFLUENCE 5.2 AND BELOW\nSELECT c.username FROM CONTENT c\n  WHERE c.username IN\n    (SELECT c.username\n      FROM CONTENT c\n      WHERE\n        contenttype LIKE 'USERINFO'\n        AND prevver is null\n          GROUP BY c.username\n          HAVING count(c.username)>1)\n    GROUP BY c.username;\n{code}\n# Run this command to delete the duplicate entries (all versions). The row with the higher {{contentid}} will be deleted.\n{code:sql}DELETE FROM CONTENT\nWHERE contentid IN\n    (SELECT DISTINCT c1.contentid AS \"pageid\"\n     FROM CONTENT c1\n     JOIN CONTENT c2 ON c1.username = c2.username\n     WHERE c1.contenttype = 'USERINFO'\n     AND c2.contenttype = 'USERINFO'\n     AND c1.prevver is null \n     AND c2.prevver is null \n     AND c1.contentid > c2.contentid);{code}\n# Restart Confluence.\n# If you are still experiencing problems, have a look at CONF-36018 as well.\n\nNB: If you have any trouble running the delete query because of foreign key constraints on the ATTACHMENT or CONTENT tables, do not remove the entries from that table. Instead, please get in touch with Support and we can help you remove the duplicates, and update the queries to be more robust.",
