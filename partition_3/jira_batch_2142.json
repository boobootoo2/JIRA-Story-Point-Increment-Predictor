Visitors who see these incompletely-displayed PDFs sometimes completely fail to realize that content is missing, which can be disastrous. Or in the case of images, they sometimes believe that we've accidentally forgotten to include images, which makes us seem incompetent and unprofessional at worst, or at the very least not detail-oriented. Hence I've flagged this as a critical issue due to its business impacts, especially when text is missing.",

Having the 'blank page' template live beneath the fold for these spaces is, at the very least, an annoyance.\n{panel}\n*Workaround:*\nCreate a template in the space which nothing in it with a suitable name, e.g. \"Blank Template\", and promote that one. It should show up with the other promoted templates, and users can now create a blank page. \n( On large sites with many spaces it will be cumbersome. But for single spaces and smaller sites it should do the trick until this improvement is implemented. )\n{panel}",

When the page property's value on that other page changes, the incoming link texts should be changed as well.\n\nReal-Life Example: \n\nWe are using Confluence as a requirements specification tool. Every page represents a requirement. Since the navigation tree becomes a little bit unreadable when the title is too long, we are using a short description of the requirement as the title (e.g. \"Send Password Reset Token\"). On the page, we are using the \"Page Properties Macro\" to add some other details to the requirement. One of these properties is a field called \"User Story\" which describes the requirement in one sentence. (e.g. \"As a user, I want to get a password reset token to be able to change my password\")\n\nWhen we are referencing this page/requirement we often have the case that we would like to use the \"User Story\"-value as the link text since this is more detailed.",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFSERVER-32410].\n  {panel}\n\nFrom a product and development planning perspective, I like the idea of being able to write up changes and tasks in a Confluence page and then being able to automatically create tickets based on the content of this page. Which is broadly what this macros does.\n\nHowever, in its current state it will only take the text you highlight in one cell and add this as the Summary to the Jira ticket. And if you select to make multiple tickets, it will then generate tickets using the content of the same cell from the rows below. So you now have several tickets of the same type with only the Summary field populated, and if you need to add Description, Component, FixVersion, Epic, etc fields, then that has to be done manually.\nSo my request is to have the ability to have more fields, included custom fields, added automatically from other columns in the table.\n\nAs an example, consider the following example table with 5 columns, 1 header row, and 3 content rows where \"h\" is the header row, and RC is a cell in a row\n\n| h1 | h2 | h3 | h4| h5|\n|R1C1 | R1C2 | R1C3 | R1C4 | R1C5 |\n|R2C1 | R2C2 | R2C3 | R2C4 | R2C5 |\n|R3C1 | R3C2 | R3C3 | R3C4 | R3C5 | \n\nWith the current version I can highlight R1C1 in the first column and if I select to create multiple tickets I will get three tickets containing Summary \"R1C1\", \"R2C1\", and \"R3C1\" respectively.\n\nWhat I suggested (just an initial thought on how to implement this), would be to:\n1: Allow the user to add additional fields to the form. Imagine I add \"Component\", \"FixVersion\", and \"Epic\"\n2: One _option_ could then be specify in the form field \"Component\" to contain \"$h2\", \"FixVersion\" to contain \"$h3\", and \"Epic\" to contain \"$h5\"\n3: The macro could then be extended to recognise \"$h2\" as column header, and then add the corresponding cell value into this field per ticket.\n4: I would then have tickets containing:\nTicket 1:\n  - Summary: R1C1 \n  - Component: R1C2\n  - FixVersion: R1C3\n  - Epic: R1C5\n\nTicket 2:\n  - Summary: R2C1 \n  - Component: R2C2\n  - FixVersion: R2C3\n  - Epic: R2C5\n\nTicket 3:\n  - Summary: R3C1 \n  - Component: R3C2\n  - FixVersion: R3C3\n  - Epic: R3C5\n\nHope that clarifies. The above example is obviously down to implementation, however the key is to achieve an outcome that allows me to create a more complete ticket based on content from a Confluence table.\n",

While Confluence in general is a great tool for collaboration, it has a serious flaw when it comes to attachments. They can only be handled easily if they are Microsoft Office files AND if you use Microsoft Internet Explorer (Firefox WebDAV plugin is broken on some OSes and generally not exactly under heavy development, as some issues here show). This poses severe restrictions for daily usage in a collaborative environment which can cause serious obstacles regarding productivity and generally frustrates people.\n\nTherefore, I want to make the following suggestion to improve Confluence:\n\nA user should be able to open any attachment via his browser directly within the appropiate application. This should be possible regardless of browser or OS used (at least on a classical desktop OS like Windows, Mac OS X or Linux) and regardless of file type or application involvled (as long as the user has an application installed that can handle a particular file type).",

So this does not allow enough flexibility for grout.  For example, if I wanted to on \"customers\" main page display all attachments labeled \"Contract\" I would have to specify all individual customer subpages in the macro settings.  If new customer if added later I need to go edit the macro to now also display results from the new customer sub page.  If I could specify either parent page, space, or all of confluence I would not have to go back and edit the macro settings.\n\nIn \"space attachments\" macro you can specify what space you want to display attachments from but you can by default filter them down to a specific label.  You can only show ALL attachments and the user must figure out what the label is we are trying to display files for by either sorting the list or filtering themselves.\n\nSo neither solution allows for displaying all files by label for all pages and subpages by specifying parent page, space or all of confluence.\n\nWe are on Confluence 5.4 at the moment.",

I want all attachments uploaded on this page to automatically have \"purchasing\" and \"IT-department\" labels (by default).  This way we can ensure that at minimum we have some high level labeling applied and we can ask the users to manually labels more specific labels such \"invoice\", \"purchase order\", etc. depending on the type of the purchasing document.

However, the decision was to not implement it as of yet.\n\nHowever, there is a section in {{Confluence Admin console > Configuration > Mail Server}} which allows user to configure a POP Mail Server. As of now, this particular feature here is not entirely usable and might create a misunderstanding on user point of view.\n\nIn this case, please assess further the possibility to implement this or perhaps remove it temporarily from this part of Confluence Admin console.\n\nThank you and regards,\nLazuardi",

Specially to documentation. A clear case is when we want to have links to a library reference manual from the examples, like you get with sphinx or doxygen.\n\n- What we would REALLY want is to have this done automatically. For example, any word (likely functions and/or classes) in the source code that matches a page in the space with that name should be shown as a link to it (eg, function \"foo()\" should always be shown as a link to the page titled \"foo\", if it exists).\n\nThe problem we are trying to solve here is how to migrate users off sphinx or doxygen offering them something *at least close* to what they have at the moment.

It also is harder to detect this, since a URL link and a correct page link look exactly the same.\n\nAdd a feature where, when the user puts in a link to a page as a URL link, the link is re-written to a page link (perhaps with an option to override) or the user is at least warned. It shouldn't be too hard to detect when the base URL points back into the wiki.\n\nOther options would include making URL links look different from page links in some way, or a tool that audits links and detects when pages have these bad links and allows them to be fixed from a central location.\n",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFSERVER-32350].\n  {panel}\n\nA feature that I've always found lacking in Confluence is the ability to simply create a new Office document directly from within a confluence page.\nAt present, the only option is to create a new Word, Excel, or PowerPoint file directly within the office application and save it locally to your disk before having to then navigate around and drag it onto a confluence page. But what if users could simply choose a attachment/document template?\nI'd like to see the attachments macro and backend enhanced to support predefined document templates...not just specific to Microsoft documents though.\n\nThe system administrator/space administrator should have the ability to upload empty or templated files into the Admin section of Confluence, with assigned document type name and icon.\nThen, when a user views the attachments macro within a page, the user would be presented with the option to either Upload/Drag an attachment (existing) or Create a new document from the below attachment templates. Please refer to the attached mockup image.\nWhen the user clicks a template icon, they would be prompted for an initial 'filename' (required) and optional Comment and Labels before being presented with a refreshed screen containing the empty attachment. At this point the user would edit the document via their normal means...either Edit in Office, GoEdit or 'Unlock'. If 'Edit in Office' is the standard practise for the organisation, perhaps the named blank document would automatically open as though clicking 'Edit in Office' and lock it for exclusive use.\nImplementing such a feature would not only assist with user acceptance and uptake of Confluence but also save time for those staff who already regularly use it.\n\nSuggested features to include:\n* System Admin - Ability for the system admin to upload template files, icon and name\n* System Admin - Ability to set 'Global attachment templates'\n* System Admin - Ability for Space Admins to set use of 'Global attachment templates' or attachment templates specific to their team..i.e PDF, JPG etc\n* system Admin - Ability to set global method of editing Office documents...such as 'Edit in Office'. This option then identifies if the newly created file with automatically open for use once created.\n* Attachment Macro - When viewed inside a page, macro allows the user to click the attachment template to use. User is prompted for a required Filename. Comments and Labels or optional\n* Attachment Macro Options - Show/Hide  'Attachment Templates'\n* Add dropdown menu - within this menu, provide link to 'Add new attachment from Template' which executes the Attachments macro.\n\nThat's about it really... I hope there's enough detail to understand where I'm going with this. This enhancement should not cost more to your customers and should be covered within a maintenance release.\nFeel free to email for any further clarification.\nthanks\nTim",

Why can I not see my research grant entries?  All I could see is an empty entry screen.   I thought my entries were deleted, so I entered some again, but each time I submitted, all I could see was an empty screen. I became frustrated that I could not see any of the research grant entries and just decided to print the report as is, - but now I see the entries!  The problem is that when I go back to select research grants from the menu, I cannot see my entries, so I cannot correct them.

Simply create a link with a href of \"[base url]/doforgotuserpassword.action?usernameOrEmail=[username]\" and when an administrator clicks it it will send them an email.\n\nThis saves me the hassle of having to email them back with an apology stating that they should do it themselves (or, rather, me having to go to that URL myself).",
