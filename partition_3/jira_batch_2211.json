HTML - The above, when viewed in a browser, should look similar to search results (or possibly blog results showing multiple blogs)\n3.

[See the corresponding bug report|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFSERVER-4867].\n  {panel}\n\nHi,\n\nI'm currently using Jetspeed and spring-portlet. I use a model layer which is handled by Spring and Hibernate : Services, DAOs and BOs. Services can open hibernate sessions to perform database requests. Portlet controllers call services to get the informations back. Everything works great except when I have to get a nested BO inside a BO in a controller.\nFor example :\nIMyService myService = (IMyService) getService (\"MyServiceName\");\nIMyBO myBO = myService.getMyBO(someParameters);\n// At this point myBO is correctly instanciated and all fileds can be accessed.\nIMyOtherBO myOtherBO = myBO.getMyOtherBO();\nString info = myOtherBO.toString(); // Or .getAField()\n//throws a LazyInitializationException : could not initialize proxy - the owning Session was closed;\n\nSo, I tried to configure my PortletModeParameterHandlerMapping with an OpenSessionInViewInterceptor to give myBO a session back.\nIn my xml conf file (like books.xml) :\n<bean name=\"openSessionInViewInterceptor\" class=\"org.springframework.web.portlet.support.hibernate3.OpenSessionInViewInterceptor\">\n<property name=\"sessionFactory\"><ref bean=\"hibernateSessionFactory\"/></property>\n</bean>\n\n<bean id=\"portletModeParameterHandlerMapping\" class=\"org.springframework.web.portlet.handler.PortletModeParameterHandlerMapping\">\n<property name=\"interceptors\">\n<list>\n<ref bean=\"parameterMappingInterceptor\"/>\n<ref bean=\"openSessionInViewInterceptor\"/>\n</list>\n</property>\n<property name=\"portletModeParameterMap\">\n<map>\n<entry key=\"view\">\n<map> ... All my entries views ...\n</map>\n</entry>\n</map>\n</property>\n</bean>\n\nA session is correctly initialized before the render or action call and is correctly closed after.\nThe problem is that the CGLIBLazyInitializer proxy object of myBO doesn't use this session but still persists using the closed session.\nHow can I  force it to use the good session ?\nIs there another solution to my problem ?\n\nThanks in advance,\nRomain\n",

I know there is a link which you can click to open up the web browser and go to page but there are situations where this is impractical (e.g. when reading through 100 notifications in your in-box in the morning and wanting to stay in your mail client) or impossible (e.g. when catching up with your mail notifications while on the train).\n\nMy suggestion is in the case of a comment being a reply-to that confluence appends the current comment thread (omitting the rest of the comments and page content). There are a few areas where this could be improved further:\n\n1. If there are many comments in the thread (eg: 10 deep) it could be cut down to, say the latest 3.\n2. If the past comments are very long and verbose (eg: stack traces) that it could be summarised with either the first 300 characters or somehow detecting and truncating large chunks (like stack traces).\n\nNote that the newly added comment should be shown in its full entirety.",

As I read in some discussions, we can\u00b4t finally use the trackback function because anonymous access is assumed on both sides. Because we don\u00b4t want to open the systems for general access, we ask you to enhance this component with the login feature.\n\nA solution was already described in the Jira issue JRA-5063 (http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRA-5063)\n\nBest regards,\nHeiko Burghardt",

I'm not sure if you are aware of it, but your mail capabilities are the thing that differentiate your product from most other Wiki's...why?  Because in most organisations people can't be bothered to log in and add pages.  However it is easy for people to simply cc emails to the Wiki.  As a result, the mail section of the Wiki is now *FULL* of amazing information.  It would be amazing if an user with editing rights could look at a particular mail and then convert it into a normal wiki page.  This way the wiki can be beautifully maintained and mails can then start to form part of the main body content of a space.  This would be a truly great feature.",

Since the request is not always available to a macro, this is a bad idea. \n\nEg. if a macro like the dynamic task list outputs javascript code, you only want it to output the code once, even though there might be more than one task lists on the page. Therefore we will need to communicate between different macro calls using a boolean flag to detect whether the repeated tags have been outputted already and to skip it.\n\nAllowing to set arbitrary attributes on the renderContext would solve this problem.",

The PermissionCheckDispatcher runs its permission checks by generating a mock xwork action and sending it through the xwork stack for processing. It is picked up by an interceptor that checks if the action is allowed, and then returns. The reason this is so slow is the overhead of the action being passed through the xwork stack. One permission check is okay. When you have 700 spaces listed on one page, 700 permission checks are way to slow.\n\nThe PermissionHelper uses the new Permission delegate system which is much quicker.",

We have a couple of macros whose actions depend on which other plugins are installed - we also have macros who are driven off dynamic configuration (such as allowed / disallowed keywords), and it would be better for us to provide relevant information for the current install rather than outputing verbose (and unnessessary) information to the users who just want to know what they can do right there, right then.\n{quote}\n",

It would be nice to have some keyboard accessibility on there, specifically:\n\nAdd onkeypress attributes to the task status (complete/incomplete icon button) and delete link for each task. The onkeypress handler would do exactly the same as the onclick handler - a very quick way to add keyboard interactivity, at least for javascript enabled browsers.\n\nIn addition, the two links (task status and delete task) should also be given titles - not only will this allow for a more descriptive tooltip to be displayed, but it also aids people with screen readers, braillers, etc. Again, very simple to add.\n\nIn the \"add task\" box, it would be nice if the \"Add Task\" text was defined as a label with an attribute of for=\"newtask\" and then give the input with name task an id=\"newTask\" attrib. This is a very quick way to help people with screen readers, braillers, etc., know what the label relates to and also select the textbox.\n\nThe next bit isn't so simple (and as such is probably better farmed off to a sub-task of this issue) - compatibility with javascript-disabled browsers....\n\nYour <a> tags for setting task status and deleting tasks currently have a href=\"#\" which will obviously do nothing if there is no javascript support. For the task status, could you have the href set to a server side action that toggles the task status as part of a screen refresh? That way, if the user has JS enabled, they use the dynamic way of doing things, if they don't have JS they see the page refresh.\n\nI'm guessing the delete task link would be slightly more complex - it will need a page displaying that asks if the user is sure they want to delete in the middle.\n\nSee also: CONF-4357",
