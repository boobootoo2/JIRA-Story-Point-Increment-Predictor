[See the corresponding bug report|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFSERVER-47674].\n  {panel}\n\nWe have recently worked in moving the [confluence drafts functionality to a plugin|https://stash.atlassian.com/projects/CONF/repos/confluence/pull-requests/3579/overview], but when going through QA we realised we broke the CQ editor.\n\nAfter some investigation, we found this code to be the main suspect:\n\n{code}\n        function fixEditorFocus() {\n            var $editorFrame = $(AJS.Rte.getEditorFrame());\n            $editorFrame.contents().find(\"html\").css(\"height\", \"100%\");\n            $editorFrame.contents().find(\"body\").css(\"min-height\", \"100%\");\n        }\n\n        exports.onReady = function() {\n            enableWhitelistedPlugins();\n            hideUnwantedItems();\n            trackAnalytics();\n            setMacroBrowserWhitelist();\n\n            toolbar.onReady();\n\n            $(function () {\n                fixEditorFocus();\n            });\n        };\n{code}\n\nSo CQ is trying to access the editor \n{code}\nvar $editorFrame = $(AJS.Rte.getEditorFrame());\n{code}\n\nwithout waiting for the editor to be ready. It has worked correctly until now just because the execution order and execution race was smiling to us.\n\nWith the changes to extract confluence drafts to a separate plugin, we started introducing AMD, and must have changed slightly the relative time were the editor gets initialised compared to when the CQ code gets executed. The result is that some times the editor is ready at the point in time where  {{var $editorFrame = $(AJS.Rte.getEditorFrame());}} gets called and sometimes not.\n\nThe fix would be as simple as changing:\n\n{code}\n            $(function () {\n                fixEditorFocus();\n            });\n{code}\n\nfor\n\n{code}\n            AJS.bind(\"rte-ready\", function () {\n                fixEditorFocus();\n            });\n{code}\n\n*But*, I think what we should do is (since the CQ has shown that this fix works pretty well) to move this fix to the editor core and remove it from CQ at all.\n\nThoughts?\n\n[~merickson] lets also have a quick chat today about it to coordinate the release process",
