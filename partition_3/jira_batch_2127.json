BUT, to see where the use case is in relation to the coding ticket right now you need a separate issue or subtask and have to go into JIRA to see the status (and control it there or try to maintain the Confluence page status at the same stage). And, once the coding is done, you may not want anyone changing the use case \"randomly\" so restricting the page as part of the closing of the JIRA coding issue would be useful.",

As a use case, it would be nice to be able to copy content from external websites (e.g. a list of selected MOOC courses) into ALM for sharing with colleagues, but without the View Storage Format to see the syntax for various Confluence macros, I'm limited putting everything into an HTML macro. Keeping things Confluence-centric would be much preferred. Additionally, being able to prototype content in Confluence and look at the XML would make this process considerable easier. \n\nUnfortunately, in my organization, only selected people from our enterprise IT group are Confluence admins (for many good reasons) and access to the [\"View Storage Format\"|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Confluence+Storage+Format] option isn't configurable. Considering the syntax is openly available, I'm not sure why the option is so restricted. Recommend making it available on a group basis or as a profile setting.",

Any help would be much appreciated.\n\n*Issue:* I have a couple of epics and some stories associated with each of them in JIRA. When I created a wiki page in Confluence, I inserted some issues from JIRA using \"JIRA Issue/Filter\" built-in macro to display all the Epics and their respective stories in a table. \nWhile all the other attributes appear correctly +I am not able to get to display, the names of the Epics in the table+. I have included +Epic Name+ and +Epic Link+ both the columns, but Epic Name column in the table is empty, while Epic Link just populates the JIRA Id of the Epic in question.\n\n*Ultimately, I need to display Epic Names in the table and not their ids.* Please suggest how this could be fixed.\n\n+*Also, for your reference, please find the screen shot attached with the ticket*+\n\nh3.Update\n\nThis issue seems to also affect other fields like Version. When user generates a report; instead of showing the version number; it shows the version ID instead.\n\nFor example. \n\n{code}\njira=> select * from projectversion where id = 17718;\n  id   | project | vname | description | sequence | released | archived | url | releasedate | startdate \n-------+---------+-------+-------------+----------+----------+----------+-----+-------------+-----------\n 17718 |   11200 | 1.9   |             |       10 |          |          |     |             | \n(1 row)\n{code}\n\nWhen a report is generated; instead of showing version 1.9 for an issue in a report; it shows 17718 instead.

If it returns any results, this bug is the cause of your duplicates.\n{code}\nSELECT  * FROM user_mapping where lower_username is null;\n{code}\nIf this query returns nothing, have a look at CONF-30050 as well.\n\nNow you need to determine if you have single records or duplicated records, as the workaround you perform will depend on this.\n{code}\nselect u.* from user_mapping u where u.username in (select nullrecord.username from user_mapping nullrecord where lower_username is null) order by u.username;\n{code}\n\nProceed to the appropriate workaround based on whether you see single or duplicated records. If you have both, apply the single records workaround first, then duplicated records.\n\nh3. SINGLE RECORDS Workaround\nSet the lower_username value for single records only. This will not affect nulls for duplicate records.\n{code}\nupdate user_mapping u set lower_username = lower(u.username) where u.lower_username is null and u.username in (select nullrecords.username from user_mapping nullrecords group by nullrecords.username having count(nullrecords.username) = 1);\n{code}\n\nNow run the diagnosis query again to ensure you are no longer affected.\n\nh3. DUPLICATED RECORDS Workaround 1 - if no content has been created by the null user records.\nFirst, try to remove the null values. If there is no content that has been created by the users, this set of queries should work. If you run into any Foreign Key constraint errors during this process, proceed to Workaround 2.\n\nh5.

DUPLICATED RECORDS Workaround 2 - if the null user records have content associated with them.\nh5.Step One: Find the affected users\nFirstly, run the below query, and save the results. You'll need the oldKey and newKey from the results.\n\n{code:sql}\nSELECT \n    user_key AS oldKey,\n    (SELECT \n            user_key\n        FROM\n            user_mapping AS u\n        WHERE\n            lower(u.username) = u.lower_username\n                AND u.username = um.username) AS newKey,\n    um.username,\n    um.lower_username\nFROM\n    user_mapping AS um\nWHERE\n    user_key IN (SELECT \n            user_key\n        FROM\n            user_mapping\n        WHERE\n            (lower(username) != lower_username))\n        OR (lower_username is null)\n{code}\n\nh5.Step Two: Validate your Keys:\nThen, for each faulty user, grab the old and new keys and input them here in place of 'foo' and 'bar'. Firstly, we'll perform a validation just to make sure that we have the correct user. *Only proceed with the fix if the validation query returns exactly two rows - the username you're applying the fix for*:\n\n{code:sql}\nSET @oldKey := 'foo';\nSET @newKey := 'bar';\n\nSELECT *\nFROM user_mapping\nWHERE (user_key = @oldKey AND lower(username) != lower_username) OR (user_key = @newKey AND lower(username) = lower_username)\n{code}\n\nThis query will return two rows. The row where the user names do not match is the oldKey, and the row where they do match is the newKey. Verify that you've got the right key for the given user. You can then use these variables in the following query:\n\nh5.Note about other databases:\nThe scripts in this bug report are for MySQL, however the syntax is identical for other database types - with the exception of setting variables. Below are some examples of how you might adapt these scripts to suit your database type - you may need to adjust them further.\n\n*Microsoft SQL Server*\n{code}\nDECLARE @oldKey varchar(255);\nSET @oldKey = 'foo';\n{code}\n\n*Oracle*\n{code}\nDECLARE\n    oldKey VARCHAR2(255) := 'foo';\n    newKey VARCHAR2(255) := 'bar';\nBEGIN\n    -- add the individual fixes here, and remove the \"@\" symbol\n{code}\n\nh5.Step Three: Individual Fixes\n{code:sql}\n-- Declare Variables:\nSET @oldKey := 'foo';\nSET @newKey := 'bar';\n\n-- TRACKBACKLINKS\nUPDATE TRACKBACKLINKS SET LASTMODIFIER = @newKey WHERE LASTMODIFIER = @oldKey;\nUPDATE TRACKBACKLINKS SET CREATOR = @newKey WHERE CREATOR = @oldKey;\n\n-- SPACES\nUPDATE SPACES SET LASTMODIFIER = @newKey WHERE LASTMODIFIER = @oldKey;\nUPDATE SPACES SET CREATOR = @newKey WHERE CREATOR = @oldKey;\n\n-- SPACE PERMISSIONS\nUPDATE SPACEPERMISSIONS SET LASTMODIFIER = @newKey WHERE LASTMODIFIER = @oldKey;\nUPDATE SPACEPERMISSIONS SET CREATOR = @newKey WHERE CREATOR = @oldKey;\nUPDATE SPACEPERMISSIONS SET PERMUSERNAME = @newKey WHERE PERMUSERNAME = @oldKey;\n\n-- SPACEGROUPS\nUPDATE SPACEGROUPS SET LASTMODIFIER = @newKey WHERE LASTMODIFIER = @oldKey;\nUPDATE SPACEGROUPS SET CREATOR = @newKey WHERE CREATOR = @oldKey;\n\n-- SPACEGROUPPERMISSIONS\nUPDATE SPACEGROUPPERMISSIONS SET PERMUSERNAME = @newKey WHERE PERMUSERNAME = @oldKey;\n\n-- PAGETEMPLATES\nUPDATE PAGETEMPLATES SET LASTMODIFIER = @newKey WHERE LASTMODIFIER = @oldKey;\nUPDATE PAGETEMPLATES SET CREATOR = @newKey WHERE CREATOR = @oldKey;\n\n-- NOTIFICATIONS\nUPDATE NOTIFICATIONS SET LASTMODIFIER = @newKey WHERE LASTMODIFIER = @oldKey;\nUPDATE NOTIFICATIONS SET CREATOR = @newKey WHERE CREATOR = @oldKey;\nUPDATE NOTIFICATIONS SET USERNAME = @newKey WHERE USERNAME = @oldKey;\n\n-- LINKS\nUPDATE LINKS SET LASTMODIFIER = @newKey WHERE LASTMODIFIER = @oldKey;\nUPDATE LINKS SET CREATOR = @newKey WHERE CREATOR = @oldKey;\n\n-- LIKES\nUPDATE LIKES SET USERNAME = @newKey WHERE USERNAME = @oldKey;\n\n-- LABEL\nUPDATE LABEL SET OWNER = @newKey WHERE OWNER = @oldKey;\n\n-- FOLLOW_CONNECTIONS\nUPDATE FOLLOW_CONNECTIONS SET FOLLOWER = @newKey WHERE FOLLOWER = @oldKey;\nUPDATE FOLLOW_CONNECTIONS SET FOLLOWEE = @newKey WHERE FOLLOWEE = @oldKey;\n\n-- EXTRNLINKS\nUPDATE EXTRNLNKS SET CREATOR = @newKey WHERE CREATOR = @oldKey;\nUPDATE EXTRNLNKS SET LASTMODIFIER = @newKey WHERE LASTMODIFIER = @oldKey;\n\n-- CONTENT_PERM\nUPDATE CONTENT_PERM SET CREATOR = @newKey WHERE CREATOR = @oldKey;\nUPDATE CONTENT_PERM SET LASTMODIFIER = @newKey WHERE LASTMODIFIER = @oldKey;\nUPDATE CONTENT_PERM SET USERNAME = @newKey WHERE USERNAME = @oldKey;\n\n-- CONTENT_LABEL\nUPDATE CONTENT_LABEL SET OWNER = @newKey WHERE OWNER = @oldKey;\n\n-- CONTENT\nUPDATE CONTENT SET LASTMODIFIER = @newKey WHERE LASTMODIFIER = @oldKey;\nUPDATE CONTENT SET USERNAME = @newKey WHERE USERNAME = @oldKey;\nUPDATE CONTENT SET CREATOR = @newKey WHERE CREATOR = @oldKey;\n\n-- ATTACHMENTS\nUPDATE ATTACHMENTS SET LASTMODIFIER = @newKey WHERE LASTMODIFIER = @oldKey;\nUPDATE ATTACHMENTS SET CREATOR = @newKey WHERE CREATOR = @oldKey;\n\n-- LOGIN INFO\nDELETE FROM logininfo WHERE USERNAME = @oldKey;\n{code}\n\nh5.Using the mass duplicate fixer\nIf you have a large number of duplicates, you can use the [Mass Duplicate Fixer|^mass-dup-fixer.zip] to generate the SQL required. Using the diagnosis query in Step 2, you can generate a tab delimited list of SQL queries. Save the output of that query in the format {{oldKey<tab>newKey}} is a tab. Name the file {{keypairs.txt}}.\n\nYou'll need python installed to run the script.\n\nExtract mass-dup-fixer.zip to a directory, and place your keypairs.txt file into this directory. Once you've got Python installed, just run path/to/python mass-dup-fixer.py from the directory you extracted everything to.\n\nh5. Step 4: Remove the user records\nNow, go back and run the queries in *DUPLICATED RECORDS Workaround 1* again to remove the user records.\n\nNB: If you are still experiencing problems, have a look at CONF-30050 as well.\n\nh3. Suggestion for fix\nIs it possible to place a null constraint on lower_username? And potentially username as well? Currently there are no null constraints on this table.\nAnother fix that would be ideal is to fix the user indexing upgrade task so that it handles null values gracefully, and performs this operation to remove them.",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFSERVER-35980].\n  {panel}\n\nConfluence's WebDAV is very convenient to work with attachments. Also Confluence provides an ability to edit page content as text file in WebDAV folder.\nAdmins can hide {{URLs}}, {{@versions}}, {{@exports}} using advanced options, described [here|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Configuring+a+WebDAV+client+for+Confluence]. These options make view of WebDAV folder more clear, only folders for pages/spaces and attachments are visible.\n\nBut it is possible to edit pages as text files. Historically, WebDAV server was implemented in Confluence 2.3 (CONF-3431). Confluence pages had content in wiki format, and it was easy for human to open it, understand its content, edit it and save.\nThe main difference between Confluence 2.3 and Confluence 5.6 from this point of view is storage/edit format. Current format is not for manual editing, but for WYSIWYG editing style. And it is hard for user to *edit* these text files, unlike it was with old good plain wiki. Especially for non-tech users. Users became confused when see text files with abracadabra in WebDAV folder.\n\nPlease, add an option to hide these text files from WebDAV view, like ones for {{URLs}}, {{@versions}} and {{@exports}} virtual folders. Additionally, I think, it worths to make this option turned off by default, because most users in most installations anyway can't edit these file directly.\n\nThere are still use cases for showing text files - for example to publish auto-created pages (build tool, report tool, etc) in Confluence. But these cases are not widely used. System admin can turn on described option in its installation. In other cases these files should be hidden.\n\nAdditionally, please, see [this comment|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Configuring+a+WebDAV+client+for+Confluence?focusedCommentId=695238827#comment-695238827].",

Would it be possible for you to build a feature next to the zoom in/out buttons at the bottom of designs that allows you to show the image at 100%? The \"Fit to Page Width\" feature kind of sort of does this; however, if we are looking at an image that is 700 pixels wide and my screen width is 1400 pixels, then all of a sudden we are far too zoomed in, hence the \"zoom to 100%\" request.\n\nAdditionally, would it be possible to adjust my user settings so that when I click from one design to the next, each design remains zoomed in at 100% (or however far I have zoomed in or out), in essence remembering where I left it when I clicked away?",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFSERVER-35903].\n  {panel}\n\nWe are looking forward to live editing within Confluence.  In order to support group editing of meeting notes during our public forums, where anyone around the world may join and we want to encourage everyone to help edit the notes, we'd like to have the option to put the page into an \"edit by default\" state while the meeting is taking place.  Rather than requiring everyone to navigate to the meeting notes _and_ be brave & motivated enough to hit an edit button, we would appreciate the option, while the notes are being taken, for users who navigate to the page (assuming they have edit privileges) to start in the collaborative live editing mode.\n\nOne of the powers of etherpad (and Google Docs) for community note-taking is people are instantly in edit mode as soon as they navigate to the page.  While clicking an edit button may seem trivial, it can represent a real barrier to getting contributions from those who have never edited a wiki page before, are new to the community and uncertain if they should be editing the page, or regular attendees only partially engaged in the meeting.\n\nSo, as live editing comes to Confluence, please consider adding an \"edit by default\" option for pages being actively edited by others.  This could be implemented as a general configuration option (e.g., \"When live editing, newcomers join live editing automatically\") and/or a page-specific option (e.g., \"Newcomers join live edit automatically\" checkbox somewhere near the \"Invite others\" link).",

Invitations is a great option; however, please make collaborative live editing the default behavior when editing.  In other words, invitations should not be required to collaborate.\n\nOur use case is online community meetings where anyone in our community may join.  We can have 10 or 20 attendees, we don't know who is going to show up ahead of time, and we want to encourage everyone who does attend to help with meeting notes.  We are currently using an etherpad instance for notes and copying notes into Confluence after the meeting.  We are hoping  live editing within Confluence can replace etherpad; however, if invitations are required to collaborate, it will not support our ad hoc collaboration.\n\nA natural and intuitive approach would be to allow anyone with privileges to edit the page to join in collaborative editing without an invitation.  Invitations could still be used to send notifications to specific people and edit restrictions on the page could be used to restrict editing. ",
