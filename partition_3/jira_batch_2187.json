This can cause problems when users have feeds that show the last 100 updated pages and request that every 15 minutes. This is resource intensive even if they are simple pages.\n\nAs the amount of content increases in a confluence instance, users who want to keep up with many spaces tend to increase the item limit and shorten the duration between updates so they don't miss out on new pages/blog posts/comments. This is not scaling very well for us.\n\nIt would be nice if there is an option in the feed builder to see \"only give me pages that have changed since I last checked the RSS feed\".

However, floating isnt always the best option and it consumes real estate.\nThis is a real problem when pages contain multiple columns with Word tables in each column.\nWe can live with the float, but only if we can change the text in the button to just say 'Edit' (ie not 'Edit Document') so it consumes less real estate.\nTo achieve our goals, we had to edit the conversion.vm file within the templates folder in the office connector jar archive.\nIt would be very useful if the following settings could be made available in the office connector config page:\n1. Edit text within the 'Edit Document' button\n2. Edit border style settings around office container (dashed, solid, none)\n\nThanks,\n\nSean",

This would help those of us that are familiar with html-syntax to mark up the above example as:\n\n{section}{column}col A{/column}{column}col B{/column}{/section}\n\nI do not suggest systematic enforcement of any kind. This feature would only be a \"crutch\" for those users that choose to use it, with the system tolerant of errors in usage. \n\nAny erroneous markup by improper closing should then cause no problems :{/foo}inside{foo}outside{foo}inside{/foo}\n(except for the user trying to make sense of it)",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFSERVER-18362].\n  {panel}\n\nh1. Situation Overview\nMarketing videos say Confluence could replace your \"old fileshare\". I feel it has significant limitations, though. Users often create hierarchies to structure multiple files. In fileshares, you can create folders and subfolders to do that. In Confluence, users cannot create file hierarchies. Every folder created in WebDAV automatically creates a page and places it into the navigation hierarchy. Often, it's not a page users want to help them store and organize multiple files.\n \nAs Confluence prohibits the creation of pages with the same name by design, navigation entries cannot have the same name. Every organization that documents a repetitive process cannot create pages with the name of the process step. Imagine a company doing projects. In every project, one or multiple offers are exchanged. So every project has an \"Offer\" folder. Maybe the project has multiple phases and concepts and documents are written. Those documents are then saved in the \"Phase 1 - Conception\" folder. Now in Confluence it's not possible to do it this way. The next project's \"Phase 1 - Conception\" folder would collide with the previous project's folder.\n\n+Example - does not work:+\n- Project 1\n-- Offers\n-- Phase 1\n--- Conception\n--- Implementation\n-- Phase 2\n-- [...]\n\n- Project 2\n-- {color:red}Offers (collision){color}\n-- {color:red}Phase 1 (collision){color}\n--- {color:red}Conception (collision){color}\n--- [...]\n\nh1. Additional Thoughts\nOn the other hand, it's not needed to have a page for every folder. What would you write on the \"Offer\" page anyway. Nevertheless you would like to store the offers that went out to the client in a folder. Now imagine if your project's documentation is extensive and has many sub-phases. You just want to store the documents in folders but you don't necessarily need a page in the sub-sub-sub-folder of phase 1. It's enough to describe the project on the main project phase and then just store all available documents and documentation below that one project page.\n\nNow, you LOVE Confluence's indexing feature and would like to be able to search through all your documents attached to your project pages. But you can't import your folder structure as it generates collisions.\n\nh1. Feature Request\nFor these cases and users (including myself and our whole company), I suggest adding a special folder similar to the \"@export\" or \"@versions\" folders there are now. I'll this special folder \"@attachments\" for now.\n\nIn this \"@attachments\" folder, the normal Confluence universe is suspended. Creating a subfolder in \"@attachments\" doesn't create a page. Also, the \"unique name of pages\" limitation could be suspended. Files and folders would behave like in normale fileshares in those \"@attachments\" folders. File versioning would still work, though, as would the full-text search and all the other special benefits and gadgets of Confluence such as rendering Word documents as HTML pages and so on.\n\nGoing to the attachments tab on a Confluence page containing \"@attachments\" would display the contents and enable browsing through the subfolders similar to a file browser. So people could access the files and folders through the browser via the attachments tab as well as via WebDAV.\n\nThis would really get rid of a) fileshares and b) the unique page limitation. In turn it would add the complete benefits of Confluence's powerful file handling features.\n\n+Example - could work:+\n- Project 1 (add your Macros and beloved Confluence features)\n-- @attachments (from here, Confluence's page creation is suspended for folders)\n--- Offers\n--- Phase 1\n---- Offers (it's even possible to have 2 folders with the same name within @attachments)\n---- Conception\n---- Implementation\n--- Phase 2\n--- [...]\n\n- Project 2 (add your Macros and beloved Confluence features)\n-- @attachments\n--- {color:blue}Offers (no conflict, as the @attachments folder mimics fileshare functionality, there can be as many Offer folders as you like, no pages and no navigation will be created in the Confluence navigation menu for folders created inside @attachments){color}\n--- {color:blue}Phase 1{color}\n---- {color:blue}Offers{color}\n---- {color:blue}Conception{color}\n---- {color:blue}Implementation{color}\n--- {color:blue}Phase 2{color}\n---- [...]\n\n\nI assume this would also be the solution for a lot of people voting for sub-spaces as many create spaces due to this unique page name limitation and are looking for a way to organize their overflowing amount of spaces as a consequence.",

Existing procedures are documented in several places:\n\nDatabase Setup For MySQL - Confluence Docs 3.1 - Atlassian Documentation - Confluence.URL\nStart Confluence automatically on Linux & Unix - Confluence Docs 3.1 - Atlassian Documentation - Confluence.URL\nInstalling Confluence Standalone on Unix or Linux - Confluence Docs 3.1 - Atlassian Documentation - Confluence.URL\nRunning Confluence behind Apache - Confluence Docs 3.1 - Atlassian Documentation - Confluence.URL\n\nWe found that the basic instructions were great at helping us get to a rudimentary install http://server:8080/. What is unclear is how best to secure the installation.\n\nFor example, we did:\n\nchown -R confluence.confluence /usr/local/confluence\nchown -R confluence.confluence /usr/local/confluence-data\n\nIt was unclear how to check the CHMOD settings in these folders to be sure they conform to known best-practices for securing a Confluence installation. Some discussion of best-practices would be reassuring.\n\nIn the area of starting Confluence automatically, it should be stressed that creating the script /etc/init.d/confluence, the following issues can occur:\n\nThis sequence of commands starts Confluence as user \"confluence\". When logged as root, do not use /usr/local/confluence/bin/startup.sh as this starts a second instance of Confluence as user \"root\". There are no obvious error messages when this is done, other than the \"startup.sh\" script will change the ownership of certain files so that Confluence will not subsequently start as user \"confluence\" until a series of \"CHOWN -R\" commands are performed on /usr/local/confluence and /usr/local/confluence-data.\n\nchkconfig --add confluence\nchkconfig confluence on\n/etc/init.d/confluence start\n\nProxying using Tomcat does not work on RHEL 5.4. Apache was running under user/group \"apache.apache\" while confluence was running under user \"confluence.confluence\". It's not clear if this is the source of this problem or the ways things should be for good security practice. We're currently stuck with \"http://server:8080/ after weeks of fiddling. There should be discussion about best practices for changing the ports.",

It's written as an OfBiz interceptor that logs not only the SQL query, but the associated stack trace that called it. This allows support to trace back a questionable SQL query to its associated method call.\n\nJIRA's is called LoggingSQLInterceptor which implement org.ofbiz.core.entity.jdbc.interceptors.SQLInterceptor, so Confluence's would need a hibernate equivalent. Looks like there's one available:\n\nhttps://www.hibernate.org/hib_docs/v3/api/org/hibernate/Interceptor.html\n\nIdeally, this could even be added to the Logging and Profiling SQL setting.",

RoboHelp has a feature called conditional text.  You can tag a topic (page) or any text with a conditional tag, then use the conditional build tags in the output (online help or PDF) for different audiences (and hide certain text for certain audiences).  For example, we might have one topic, and we use conditional tags in different parts of the topic for the administrator or end user.  We're reusing topics instead of copying them, and there's less of a chance for error because we're only editing that one topic.\n\nThe problem with the HTMLComment macro and with the Excerpt macro's \"hidden\" parameters is that even anonymous users will be able to see the hidden text in a search.  We need a way to comment out text so that it does not show up in a search.  It would be nice for those with permissions to still be able to search for hidden text, however.",

Since Confluence doesn't show the comments while you are editing a page, I have to edit the page in a different tab/window than the one I'm viewing it in.  This is a PITA, plus it sometimes results in conflicting changes if I leave the computer, come back and start editing the page in multiple windows.\n\nThis simple improvement would result in a big productivity boost for a lot of users.",

I have since found that it doesn't.  In Trac, if you have a page hierarchy like so:\n\n* Page1\n** Page1Child\n* Page2\n** Page2Child\n*** Page2ChildsChild\n\nYou could access Page 2 Child's Child like http://trac/Page2/Page2Child/Page2ChildsChild and Page 1's Child like http://trac/Page1/Page1Child and so on and so forth.  This is very user friendly because the URL actually means something to them.\n\nHowever, in Confluence the page hierarchy as far as URLs is completely flat.  The major reason we want this is because we have multiple projects per space to cut down on the sheer number of spaces we would need.  For example, if we have test reports we'd like to be able to have multiple pages called 'Introduction' in the same space, as long as there wasn't already a page with that name under that *level* of the hierarchy (i.e. the same parent).  Having to name my page 'Project 1.4.6 Test Report Introduction' is a bit extreme, not to mention ugly when you export the page hierarchy to PDF for external consumption, as the table of contents is derived from the page titles.\n\nNow that I think about it, this may be two feature requests...\n\n# The ability to access a page using its hierarchy in the URL and\n# The ability to have multiple pages of the same title in the same space, enforced by parentid.",

The problem is that in Russian keyboard layout numero sign is bound to the same key as number sign in English keyboard layout (Shift+3). To create numbered lists in texts in Russian I need to switch keyboard layout to English and back for every line of bulleted list, which is very annoying. People here almost ignore numbered lists in Confluence because of this issue. There is no such issue with bullet lists, because asterisk is available in both keyboard layouts.\n\nIt would be great to allow both numero '\u2116' and number '#' signs to designate line in a numbered list.",

The use of Unicode is not uncommon anymore, and this problem can be solved in a better way:\n\n1. The preferred solution would be to implement a way to remove diacritic marks from a letter, so you can reduce a string with diacritic marks to a string without diacritic marks. A search string would then not only be compared to a persons name, but also to the reduced version of that name.\n\n2. A work-around would be to create a new user property, besides 'fullname', that can contain alternative spellings of this persons name. Someone called Ren\u00e9 could enter 'Rene' as alternative spelling. A search strings would then not only be compared to a persons name, but also to the alternative spellings of that name.\n\nMore information:\n- My support ticket describing the problem: https://support.atlassian.com/browse/CSP-40233\n- Google demonstrating that you can strip the umlaut: http://www.google.nl/search?q=Dani%C3%ABl\n- A solution in Perl: http://ahinea.com/en/tech/accented-translate.html\n",
