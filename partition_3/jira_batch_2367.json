As the issue hasn't collect votes, watchers, comments, or support cases from many customers during its lifetime, it's very low on our priority list, and will not be fixed in the foreseeable future. That's why we've decided to resolve it as *Timed Out*.\r\n\r\nAlthough we're aware the issue is still important to those of you who were involved in the conversations around it, we want to be clear in managing your expectations. The Bitbucket Server team is focusing on issues that have broad impact and high value, reflected by the number of comments, votes, support cases, and customers interested. Please consult the [Atlassian Bugfix Policy|https://confluence.atlassian.com/support/atlassian-bug-fixing-policy-201294573.html] for more details.\r\n\r\nWe understand how disappointing this decision may be, but we hope you'll appreciate our transparent approach and communication. If you're really passionate about this suggestion, please comment with your case in detail and we'll reconsider. Atlassian will continue to watch this issue for further updates, so please feel free to share your thoughts in the comments.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nImran Khan\r\nProduct Manager - Bitbucket Server and Data Center\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\nPermalink URLs on comments on the Diff tab currently have the form:\r\n\r\n{panel}\r\n.../pull-requests/n/*overview*?commentId=x\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\nIf you use this url in a new browser tab/window, you are taken to the Overview tab where the comment will be highlighted.\r\n\r\nPermalinks should take you back to the tab you took them from.  Maybe on the Diff tab they should go to:\r\n\r\n{panel}\r\n.../pull-requests/n/*diff*?commentId=x\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\nHowever, the above url doesn't seem to highlight the comment in the Diff view, so there is probably also some work to make the diff view accept the query string",

I saw the branch was already named with the issue key and summary (e.g. \"bugfix/IDC-2-issue-summary-goes-here\"), so I committed all my stuff in there without mentioning the issue key again in the commit messages, expecting them to still show up in JIRA's Source Tab because the branch had the issue key in its name \u2013 I thought JIRA was \"smart\" enough to also catch them because of that, which it obviously does not.\r\n\r\nWouldn't it make more sense to treat any commit in such feature branches relevant? Because I think there aren't that many cases in which you'd commit code into a specialized feature branch dedicated to one single JIRA issue that has nothing to do with that feature/linked issue at all. And since programmers are generally lazy, why (remember to!) type the issue key into every single commit message when it's already there, sitting in the branch name where JIRA/Stash could theoretically find it too?\r\nI of course understand that, with a very basic branching scheme where everyone directly commits their stuff to `master`, you'd of course need the key directly in commit messages \u2013 but when using `git-flow` and the like (like me in this case here) it really doesn't make any sense at all.\r\n\r\nAfter all it also would add some consistency, given JIRA's \"Create feature branch\" feature which already prepopulates the branch name field in the form with the issue key per default as well as Stash's specific support for feature branching. Those were the two major points that caused my confusion here leading to the support request - I simply expected JIRA/Stash to work like that because these two features were there.",

As the issue hasn't collect votes, watchers, comments, or support cases from many customers during its lifetime, it's very low on our priority list, and will not be fixed in the foreseeable future. That's why we've decided to resolve it as *Timed Out*.\r\n\r\nAlthough we're aware the issue is still important to those of you who were involved in the conversations around it, we want to be clear in managing your expectations. The Bitbucket Server team is focusing on issues that have broad impact and high value, reflected by the number of comments, votes, support cases, and customers interested. Please consult the [Atlassian Bugfix Policy|https://confluence.atlassian.com/support/atlassian-bug-fixing-policy-201294573.html] for more details.\r\n\r\nWe understand how disappointing this decision may be, but we hope you'll appreciate our transparent approach and communication. If you're really passionate about this suggestion, please comment with your case in detail and we'll reconsider. Atlassian will continue to watch this issue for further updates, so please feel free to share your thoughts in the comments.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nImran Khan\r\nProduct Manager - Bitbucket Server and Data Center\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Stash/JIA integrations are working quite well for us, but one obvious shortfall is the inability for engineers to log work hours on completion of their work, directly from the Resolve Issue dialog, instead it's a \"Edit This in JIRA\" link to the JIRA version of of the Resolve Issue, which has more stuff on it.  \r\n(See attached screenshots).\r\n\r\nWe use Trusted App and OAuth Application Links all round.\r\n\r\nThis is the only part of the developer side of the workflow that doesn't seem quite right for us.",

      "description": "Currently, the only way to remove a pull request from my inbox is to approve it. This is a usability/productivity problem when I have many pull requests in my inbox, some of which I've already reviewed, but not approved, and others that I've not yet reviewed at all. It can be difficult to find which PRs I have not yet seen.\r\n\r\nOther issues (e.g. STASH-2999, STASH-4633) have asked for multiple PR statuses (e.g. complete, disapprove, pending changes). While I support those suggestions, I also see the complexity in creating a design that satisfies many different workflows. I believe that simply decoupling inbox state (in, out) from PR state (not approved, approved), would go a long way to making PRs more manageable, and pose no barrier to more complex solutions in the future.\r\n\r\nRegarding design: Imagine an 'x' next to each PR in your inbox. Clicking an 'x' would remove the PR from the inbox (or alternatively gray out the entry). It would return to the inbox when a new commit is pushed. Otherwise, system behavior would remain unchanged (e.g. email alerts with other reviewers' comments would still be sent).\r\n\r\nThanks for a great product. I believe this suggested enhancement is in the spirit of the product's current feature richness delivered through a parsimonious design. I hope you agree.",

      "description": "If a repository has a handful of open pull requests that all merge into master and the master branch is updated it looks like stash will try to update all of the pull request merge branches simultaneously.

Updating the merge branches shouldn't be able to have this effect.  Some thoughts depending on the implementation could be to:\r\n\r\n1) This background task manager shouldn't spawn off more jobs than something like the number of cpus * 2 at any one time.\r\n\r\n2) Before starting a job should check if it is already invalid (such as if between when it was started and now if the the master branch has been pushed to causing this job to be pointless as it will be overwritten shortly)\r\n\r\n3) Double check the code path that occurs if a merge fails to see if it is more expensive.  In our system we recently had a change to master that caused all pull requests to not be mergeable.  This could very much have just been coincidental.\r\n\r\n4) Perhaps only update the merge branch if someone actually visits the pull request webpage or fetches from the pull-request refs\r\n\r\n5) double check how the merge operation is being run, perhaps there is a cheaper/faster way to do it.",
