In Websphere, In a shared environment, the session IDs are modified to be unique to each JVM, so that each application can get the appropriate requests. Confluence throws this error under that condition. \n\n2).

It would be very useful to show also old versions of an attachment, so that you can insert a link to a specific version of a file.\n\nThe only way to proceed now is to go to attachments page and copy the hard link to the old version desired, then modify the page and paste the link as external link.\n\nThanks for help\n\n(initial question: https://support.atlassian.com/browse/CSP-32044)",

The evaluation makes sure the value get auto html encoded.\nFor example convert\n{code}\n$action.getText(\"title.remove.page\", [$action.getPage().getTitle()])\n{code}\nto\n{code}\n$action.getText(\"title.remove.page\", [\"$action.getPage().getTitle()\"])\n{code}\n\nThe optimal fix would be to not mark those methods as HtmlSafe and instead have no html tags in our i18n messages (namely ConfluenceActionSupport.properties).

Whether both get implemented is probably ultimately not my decision, but imho, the first is more important to address:\n\n1) The +Documentation+ link (on all Macro Browser pages) has no preceding space character, which can lead to problematic word wraps (see attached image).\n\n2) Furthermore, I discussed this with the other T/W's and we thought that the single word +Documentation+ could do with some additional wording to make it consistent with the other context-sensitive documentation links throughout the Confluence UI. The suggestions are as follows (although only the word 'documentation' should be hyperlinked):\n\n* Refer to +documentation+.\n\nor\n\n* More +documentation+.\n\n(In order of preference.)",

Our wiki administrators simply do not have the time to perform all the wiki migrations that are being planned, so the legacy wiki users must be able to use the UWC tool to export content to disk from thier old wiki, and then as a Confluence space administrator, be able to import that content into thier own wiki space.  Confluence is currently THE wiki solution for HP Software R&D and we have deployed a 3-node commerical cluster initially with potential plans to expand the number of nodes later as need requires.  The basic problem is that there is not going to be some full-time wiki/site administrator to help the users with migrating content to the new wiki. If the space administrator can upload the pages into the wiki space, that is exactly the sort of self-service functionality that we need. Anybody who is a site administrator is really not going to have time to do anything other than create the space, assign the space administrators to the space, or add users to groups. Not having the import functionality for the space administrator is a major issue for us.\n{quote}",

Problem\n\nThe current interactions for selecting macros in the macro browser are inconsistent with the interactions planned for implementation in 3.1. To maintain consistent and expected behaviours with the dialogs in Confluence, we either need to change it now for 3.0, or later for 3.1. Luckily it's a small predominantly visual fix.\n\nh3. Solution\n\n- Remove the grey hover effect.\n- Turn the titles and pictures of the macros into clickable links.\n- Give the title an underline on hover.\n- When hovering over the titles and pictures, the mouse cursor should be a hand. Otherwise, it should be the standard arrow cursor.\n- Interactions should be the same just limited to a smaller area - clicking on either the title or picture should take you to the next step.\n\nIf that's unclear, please feel free to ask me some questions.",

Renders links and verifying their validating when loading the page - use of pre-rendered body content, because rendering of wiki pages is quite slow.\n\n{quote}\nWhen I first found out that every page is basically rendered from markup to html every time it is displayed, I got a bad feeling about the efficiency of such an implementation.\n\nHave you ever considered splitting a page internally into static and dynamic fragments. When you think about it, all the basic wiki markup doesn't change dynamically and could be cached. On the other hand, there are macros that must be executed each time a page is rendered and thus can't be cached. But there are also macros that render the same stuff over and over (e.g. {{toc}}, {{noformat}}, {{code}}, etc) and if these had a configuration setting that would tell the renderer that the output can be cached and reused, then you could skip a lot of marco invocations. To make this caching really efficient, the plugins should be able to define the cache expiration policy (never, after X minutes/seconds).\n\nI know that there is the {cache} macro that could do something similar, but that macro must be applied by users (which often don't know or care about these things) and more importantly suffers from a security hole that bypasses Confluence's ACL system and can expose content to users that should not have access to it.\n{quote}",
