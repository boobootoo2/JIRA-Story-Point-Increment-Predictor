      "description": "I am using Sourcetree with Git, for Framemaker files, which are binary files.\u00a0 Framemaker is a desktop publishing software for technical writers. We have a \"book\" file which groups multiple individual Framemaker files together (each of which represents a chapter in the book). Framemaker has a function where you can change some attribute of all of chapters in a book, such as changing the conditions in all the chapters, or updating the page numbering in all of the chapters, or clearing the change bars in all of the chapters. When performing some of these \"group\" actions, each chapter is opened quickly, changed, and then saved again. During this process I get an error message that one of the chapters could not be saved. When I look at the File Status in SourceTree, it shows as a Removed/Deleted file in the Unstaged Files section. I then have to Discard the deletiong and re-do the group action. When I redo the group action, a different file will then get deleted, and so on, over and over again.\r\n\r\nThis is not specific to my laptop - there are 5 writers in our group, and it happens to all of us.\r\n\r\nThis does appear to be specific to either SourceTree or Git, because this only started happening once we started using SourceTree and Git (our files were previously in a Subversion, and we never had this issue).\r\n\r\nIf I move the book and all its chapters OUTSIDE of the Git directory/Sourcetree, and do the same group action, it works fine.\u00a0\r\n\r\nI updated to the latest version of Sourcetree (3.4.5), because I noticed in the release notes that there was a fix for an issue that SORT of sounded like it might have something to do with this (\"Fixed staging modified files with paths longer than 260 characters stages the file as 'Removed'), but updating did not resolve the problem. Also, I checked my file paths, and none are longer than 100 characters.\u00a0",

This does mean that when I'm ready to push to the shared repo I've created quite a few nonsense commits that I'd like to squash away before pushing.\r\n\r\nUsing SourceTree that should be a simple thing, but I keep running into issues where not all selected commits are being squashed together. Let me show some images of what I do using a sample repo with some checkins:\r\n\r\n!https://i.imgur.com/A4HpALJ.png!\r\n\r\nI click the first checking and choose to 'rebase children interactively'\r\n\r\n!https://i.imgur.com/lkPphjS.png!\r\n\r\nA pop will appear with all the checkins:\r\n\r\n!https://i.imgur.com/0yCPcNm.png!\r\n\r\nOn this popup I click the 'fifth' checkin and hit the squash with previous 3 times until the screen looks like this:\r\n\r\n!https://i.imgur.com/HH7zIR3.png!\r\n\r\nAll's fine you'd think, but then when hitting the 'ok' button, this is what I end up with:\r\n\r\n!https://i.imgur.com/KSr1A32.png!\r\n\r\nWhy oh why does it not include the 'Second' commit in the end result? Judging by the looks of the popup you'd think this is included as well. I can do the same thing again to get the second in there, but I just can't fathom why it works this way or how to squash them all in one go:\r\n\r\n\u00a0",
