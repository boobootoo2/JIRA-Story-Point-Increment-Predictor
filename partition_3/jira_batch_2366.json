      "description": "*Problem:*\r\nWhen a cascaded auto merge has conflicts a new PR is created. This sounds fine, but there is a major flaw with it when the target release branches have permissions that restricts access to these branches - which was the main reason why we chose to use Stash in the first place.\r\n\r\nThe current solution in Stash expects the developer to resolve the conflict on the target branch using the suggested procedure in the conflict warning message in the PR. However, when the developer has resolved the conflict he may not be allowed to push his changes - as they are done directly on the target branch (which may have write restrictions).\r\n\r\n*Suggestion:*\r\nTo overcome this the conflict resolution should be done in a branch that developers have write access to and not on the target branch. That branch should then after resolution continue auto merged (like the current cascaded auto merge system does).\r\n\r\nSo, when there are conflicts on a cascaded auto merge Stash should:\r\n\r\n# Create a \"proxy\" branch based on the tip of the target branch.\r\n# Create a PR from the source branch to the proxy branch. \r\n\r\nThe developer then resolves the conflicts on the proxy branch, where they have write access. \r\n\r\nStash should then:\r\n\r\n# Close the proxy merge PR (nothing to merge from source - just like the current automatic merge failure PRs closes when resolved).\r\n# Try to merge the proxy into the target. This will normally just work. If the PR is closed before any other commits has been done on the target branch then this would be a fast forward of the target release branch. If the target release branch has newer commits then in *most* cases the merge would probably be without conflict. In the rare occasions where this conflicts again, then Stash should just create a new conflict PR. \r\n\r\n*Note:*\r\nThis is what we are now doing, but manually and with a little extra pain. When a cascaded auto merge fails, we follow the procedures for fixing the conflict, except we create a proxy branch that we fix the problem in. We then manually create a PR for this. When that merges to the target the automatic merge failure should be clean and dismissed. We sometimes just manually fail this as well.\r\n\r\nI'd suggest that these conflict-branches where created with a prefix to allow for permissions on these separately (i.e. \"conflict/\").",

Balancer can serve requests to hosts from this list only.\r\n\r\nThen Balancer received new hash for one repo, it totally cleanup list on slave hosts and remain only Stash Master in this list. And then in loop, it make checking by REST if Stash Slave contains commit with sha1 in given repository on Slave. If slave does not contain hash, it perform git fetch from Master Stash, until REST return true.\r\n\r\nBalancer have full table of:\r\n{code}\r\nproject1/repo1: sha1_1\r\nproject1/repo2: sha1_2\r\nproject2/repo1: sha1_3\r\n...\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nThe every one host in Balancer reals list must have sha1 in repositories from this table. It can't be added in this list until it not contains commit.\r\n\r\nSo, in result. Developer make push into Master Stash, but read (git fetch) from Stash Balancer. In only few seconds after push Balancer will server request from Master Stash, but after a while, Balancer start serving requests from Stash Slaves also, and it will reduce CPU/NET activity.\r\n\r\nIt usefull especially for CI servers, like Bamboo or Teamcity, where you can have 100500 build agent, each one of them can perform git fetch after big one git push into Stash. Now it totally hangup single Stash instance for big repos (~7GB) and 150 build agents. But with Stash Balancer it will be work more stable.",

If you need to get commits, you may download it by ranges from different servers. Only one thing \u2014 you need protocol support for this.\r\n\r\n1. Client perform git fetch and send their leafs of git tree as sha1 ids.\r\n2. Server calculate deltas, compress and send it back.\r\n\r\nIn stage 2, server can ask connected peers \u2014 \u00abwho can serve this ranges?\u00bb, and each peer tell for fast \u2014 \u00abme, i have ranges: from..to, from..to, etc\u00bb\r\nThen server analyse it and split one request to several (small) deltas, then it send instructions to client in form:\r\n{code}\r\nrange aaa..bbb: first.server.acme.com/project/repo.git\r\nrange ccc..ddd: second.server.acme.com/project/repo.git\r\nrange eee..fff: main.server.acme.com/project/repo.git\r\n...\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nAnd then client make asynch requests to each one server and join results.\r\n\r\nThis make possibility to split Stash instance per several machines. Stash main instance and connected Stash slave git peers. Then Stash get update (git push), it send push to peers by standard git protocol.\r\n\r\nAnd most hard thing \u2014 we need to patch git client to make ability work with two phases fetch \u2014 ask where deltas located, and then download from several servers. Linus will be angry, i suppose :)\r\n\r\nThis ticket is only proposal to discuss. Our team is under edge of one instance of Stash limits.

We know it's been a while since this suggestion was raised and we're sorry to have kept you without a clear answer.\r\n\r\nYour feedback has really helped us better understand the challenges you face being unable to link Bitbucket Server projects with Jira instances. Despite our lack of communication, this problem is actually one of those areas we plan to improve. Right now we've decided to prioritise it on our roadmap.\r\n\r\nThank you again for all your feedback on this suggestion and we look forward to providing you with more updates as we work on the solution.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nAnton Genkin\u00a0| Product Manager - Integrations\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\n*Original description:*\r\nSome of the reasons to provide this functionality:\r\n- If two JIRA instances contain the same project key only the issue in the first instance that is found is displayed.\r\n- Serial search through JIRA instances is not ideal.\r\n- https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/STASH-4805\r\n\r\n",

Low: Information Disclosure CVE-2014-0119\r\n\r\nIn limited circumstances it was possible for a malicious web application to replace the XML parsers used by Tomcat to process XSLTs for the default servlet, JSP documents, tag library descriptors (TLDs) and tag plugin configuration files. The injected XML parser(s) could then bypass the limits imposed on XML external entities and/or have visibility of the XML files processed for other web applications deployed on the same Tomcat instance.\r\n\r\nh5. Important: Denial of Service CVE-2014-0075\r\n\r\nIt was possible to craft a malformed chunk size as part of a chucked request that enabled an unlimited amount of data to be streamed to the server, bypassing the various size limits enforced on a request. This enabled a denial of service attack.\r\n\r\nh5. Important: Information disclosure CVE-2014-0096\r\n\r\nThe default servlet allows web applications to define (at multiple levels) an XSLT to be used to format a directory listing. When running under a security manager, the processing of these was not subject to the same constraints as the web application. This enabled a malicious web application to bypass the file access constraints imposed by the security manager via the use of external XML entities.\r\n\r\nh5. Important: Information disclosure CVE-2014-0099\r\n\r\nThe code used to parse the request content length header did not check for overflow in the result. This exposed a request smuggling vulnerability when Tomcat was located behind a reverse proxy that correctly processed the content length header.\r\n\r\nSee http://tomcat.apache.org/security-7.html#Apache_Tomcat_7.x_vulnerabilities for links to more detailed descriptions.",

Your input in the comments helps us understand how this affects you and what you're hoping to accomplish with Bitbucket Server.\r\n\r\nWe spend a significant amount of time on an ongoing basis to determine our product investments in Bitbucket Server. Unfortunately, we are not currently planning to address this suggestion in the next 12 months. In the last 12 months, we've resolved 10 of the top 30 feature requests, and our upcoming roadmap includes a number of other top voted suggestions, including in-browser editing, improvements to search functionality, better JIRA integration, and providing an even better code review experience.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, we hope that everyone might consider an established 3rd-party add-on - [AsciiDoc for Bitbucket Server|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/org.christiangalsterer.bitbucket.server.bitbucket-asciidoc-plugin/overview]. Our ecosystem is an important aspect of the product, providing flexibility where people want different or additional functionality, and maintaining simplicity where they don't.\r\n\r\nI understand that this may be disappointing, but we believe it\u2019s important for us to be open, honest and transparent with our customers. Product feedback is collected from a number of different sources and is evaluated when planning the product roadmap. You can [learn more about our process here|https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/110373/how-does-the-jira-team-use-jira-atlassian-com].\r\n\r\nNorman Ma\r\n\r\nProduct Manager - Bitbucket Server\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\nCurrently Stash supports Markdown as markup language. It can be used in descriptions/comments and in README file. But other providers like Bitbucket, also offers the possibility to use AsciiDoc format as markup language in README file.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion providing AsciiDoc support will a really improvement/step forward in Stash and its documentation engine because of the richness offered by AsciiDoc language to cite a few options (tables, fashion inner elements, TOC, ...).\r\n\r\nCurrently there is one implementation in Java that convert AsciiDoc content to Html code. The library is called AsciidoctorJ, but also there are implementations for Ruby called Asciidoctor, and even for Javascript which is called Asciidoctor Js. All of them are under the umbrella of Asciidoctor.\r\n\r\nIn case of AsciiDoc format, there are several accepted extensions like .ad, .adoc or .asciidoc, which differs from markdown where the extension is .md.",

As the issue hasn't collect votes, watchers, comments, or support cases from many customers during its lifetime, it's very low on our priority list, and will not be fixed in the foreseeable future. That's why we've decided to resolve it as *Timed Out*.\r\n\r\nAlthough we're aware the issue is still important to those of you who were involved in the conversations around it, we want to be clear in managing your expectations. The Bitbucket Server team is focusing on issues that have broad impact and high value, reflected by the number of comments, votes, support cases, and customers interested. Please consult the [Atlassian Bugfix Policy|https://confluence.atlassian.com/support/atlassian-bug-fixing-policy-201294573.html] for more details.\r\n\r\nWe understand how disappointing this decision may be, but we hope you'll appreciate our transparent approach and communication. If you're really passionate about this suggestion, please comment with your case in detail and we'll reconsider. Atlassian will continue to watch this issue for further updates, so please feel free to share your thoughts in the comments.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nImran Khan\r\nProduct Manager - Bitbucket Server and Data Center\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\nSometimes I want to just fill the screen with the code.

Worse I have to click to open/close it along with the file tree.
