Consider the word \"disclaimer\".  With negative letter spacing the &#x27;c&#x27; and &#x27;l&#x27; characters collide and appear to be the letter &#x27;d&#x27;.  I thought I had created a project called \"disdaimer\".\n\nAnother issue caused by this spacing is that words ending in some characters appear to be chopped off.  For example, the right-most tips of the letter &#x27;x&#x27; is clipped in the word \"box\".\n\nFor both of these examples the words I&#x27;m using were displayed in the repository list, so if you&#x27;re dead set on squishing characters please consider at least removing it for the repo list, but IMO the site text is much easier to read with default letter spacing.\n\nThank you for your consideration.",

      "description": "We are *missing bugs* that reviewers reported in BitBucket Pull Requests -- due to a nuance of this tool.  We like this tool!  But please help us catch _all_ of the bugs we report.\n\nh3. PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:\nDuring a Pull Request (PR), our natural inclination is to review a file from top to bottom.  The Overview page is listed in reverse chronological order of when comments were made, which would be inconvenient for a comprehensive code review with multiple files and reviewers.  So instead of using the overview page, we go straight to the Diff page, and select the files to review in order, using \"Show Diff of &#x27;All changes in this pull request&#x27;\".\n\nUnfortunately, I just learned that that setting does NOT show all the review comments if there are multiple commits.  If some comments are made in a BitBucket Pull Request, then the author uploads corrections for those comments, and then additional comments are made: not all the comments will be displayed.  If we don&#x27;t realize the problem (has happened), we may never review all the comments.  Our expectation was that I would see them all, so the interface was not intuitive enough to help us get it right.\n\nh3. POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS:\nAll the comments are on the Overview page, but that page is not in an efficient format for large reviews.  If it had the ability to change its sort order to \"By File\" in addition to the default \"Reverse Chronological\", we could more easily find the missing information.\n\nAnother option would be to have a Diff view that somehow marked how many unique comments exist on each commit, similar to the red circle with a white number currently employed in the top-right of my screen, that indicates the number of unapproved Pull Requests I have that are outstanding.\n\nAnother option may be to allow comments to be marked as read or resolved, and then display a \"number of comments not read by reviewers\" count so we can make sure it is zero before approving a PR.\n\nAnother option would be to allow a Diff View to accumulate changes and comments from multiple commits.  That sounds technically challenging, though it would be nice.\n\nAnother option may be to carry forward comments with each new commit, until they are marked resolved.  That would be neat, but seems error-prone.\n\nThank you for considering this problem.",

All subsequent builds during that time window need to download dependencies over and over again. That&#x27;s really inefficient.\n\nReasoning for 2 is that instead of forcing downloading the cache every week, why not define a time-to-live for the cache? If there are no builds running for a week, then delete the cache (if you need to free resources).\n\nIf a project is actively building day after day, do not require rebuilding the cache unless there is a good reason to do so.\n\nI guess there is a little controversy between the interests of Atlassian and Bitbucket Pipelines users since Atlassian charges by the minute and users want builds to be as fast as possible.

Problem introduction\nSo the only way to create a TOC for a bitbucket wiki (listing all files of the wiki) is to use teh [creaol syntax|https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/add-a-table-of-contents-to-a-wiki-221451163.html] because markdown and other markup can generate a page-level TOC only.\n\nSo to make a wiki TOC we should use: {{<<toc / 1>>}}.\n\nOur wiki is containing {{Home.wiki}} with {{<<toc / 1>>}} and all other pages are in Markdown.\n\nh1. Problem\nThe [creole TOC marco|https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/macro-reference-for-creole-markup-317195809.html#MacroReferenceforCreoleMarkup-TableofContents] is not very smart. If using  {{<<toc / 1>>}}, it is looking in all markdown files for lines beginning with {{#}} BUT when using alternative markdown heading syntax like {{# H1 title #}} the macro will render a tiitle like this {{H1 title #}} with an extra {{#}} at the end that should be removed as part of the markdown syntax. This is also buggy with comments in fancy code blocks:\n\n{code:{.markdown}}\n```\n# comment\nputs \"ruby code\"\n```\n{code}\n\nh1. Example\nHome.wiki\n\n{code:{.creole}}\n<<toc / 1>>\n{code}\n\nfile.md\n\n{code:{.markdown}}\n# Working H1\n\nbuggy code block :\n\n```\n# buggy comment\nputs \"ruby code\"\n```\n{code}\n\nfile2.md\n\n{code:{.markdown}}\n# buggy H1 #\n\nlorem\n{code}\n\nWill result in:\n\n* Home\n* Working H1\n* buggy H1 #\n* buggy comment\n\nWhere I must have :\n\n* Home\n* Working H1\n* buggy H1",

      "description": "When using BitBucket for large scale teams multiple projects and repositories will get created for various code bases. Each time a new repository is created every group is added to the repository. Since it is not a given that every group needs access and since organizing users into groups is the suggested way of user management this requires admins to go and remove groups after the creation. This in turn sends out notifications that users have been removed from Bitbucket when in fact they have only been removed from a certain repository. This in turn causes emails, slacks and HipChat inquiries as to why their access was removed. This seems like it could be fixed with the simple addition of adding a *Choose Groups to Add* feature in the initial repository creation.\n\nIdea for feature:\n\n* Add a toggle to either include all groups in the repository when it is created or choose groups to add\n* If it is individual groups then allow for the groups to be checked and added into the initial repository creation\n* Add a checkbox to inform or not inform the users when they have been removed from a repository",
