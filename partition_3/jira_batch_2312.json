For instance, what is the difference between the group Atlassian, Atlassian-support, or Atlassian-staff. If a admin is not careful, they may have intended to give permission to Atlassian-staff while intending to choose Atlassian-support without knowing the real difference between the two. But the person they intended to give access to right then now has access, along with a bunch of people they didn\u2019t intend to, possibly impacting licensing and causing a lot of additional work tracking down who gave these extra users access.  Also the group Atlassian still showed at the top in the search results and has to be ignored for each change. This can also happen when two Active Directory hit a namespace collision because the systems are being combined.\r\n\r\nIn this complicated group environment Bitbucket System Admin need to be able to restrict the number of groups available to help Admin to avoid some mistakes. Here are some possible ways to restrict the groups:\r\n * An allow or deny list defined by a regex.\r\n * The Directory domain the group is in. For instance, only allow Bitbucket repository admin to add Internal or Crowd groups and not Active Directory groups.\r\n * A list of groups allow or deny.\r\n * A combination of the above.\r\n\r\nUnintentional mistakes can be avoided if Bitbucket System Admin are able to limit the number of groups Bitbucket Admin are able to choose.",

Issue Summary\r\n\r\nThe group pulled and added from Active Directory is not deleted from the Project Permissions page when the Active directory connector is removed completely. The same group when added back to the Bitbucket again via another External User directory(Delegated Ldap from the same AD) is then able to have the access to the project permission. The same should not happen and the Groups from the Active Directory must be removed when the connector is deleted.\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Add an Active Directory Connector and sync it with Bitbucket\r\n # The Users and Groups are pulled from AD\r\n# A group from AD named *bitbucket-users* are added to Global Permissions and Project permissions\r\n# Remove the Active directory connector from the User Directories page\r\n# The groups are gone from the groups page as expected but are still listed in the Project Permissions.\r\n# Add a Delegated Ldap directory from the same AD \r\n# Login with a user who is part of the  *bitbucket-users* groups in AD.\r\n# If we check on the Project permissions *bitbucket-users* group the users from the Delagated Ldap directory are having the permissions to access the Projects\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nThe Groups should also be removed on the Project permissions when the Active directory connector is removed.\r\nh3.

Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n*Note:* The key to the steps below is that there was a branch called {{feature/story}} (where {{story}} is stored as a file in the git ref data) which was deleted. Then, a branch called {{feature/store/test123}} is created (where {{story}} is now a folder in the git ref data).\r\n\r\n* Create New Project: TEST_PROJECT\r\n* Create New Repository: TEST_REPOSITORY\r\n* Push a simple 'hello world' text file: 'test_file.txt' to the repository with branch: master\r\n* Add project: TEST_PROJECT to a smart mirror sync list\r\n* LOCALLY: Create branch feature/story {{git checkout -b feature/story}}\r\n* PUSH Branch to upstream {{git push --set-upstream origin feature/story}}\r\n* Ensure changes have synchronised to the smart mirror\r\n* STOP Bitbucket Smart Mirror (This is just an easy way to reproduce. Alternatively - introduce short delay between syncs) \r\n* LOCALLY (while mirror is down or during the short delay): Delete feature/story, create a new branch: feature/story/test123 and push to upstream\r\n** {{git checkout master}}\r\n** {{git branch -d feature/story}}\r\n** {{git checkout -b feature/story/test123}}\r\n** {{git push origin --delete feature/story}}\r\n** {{git push --set-upstream origin feature/story/test123}}\r\n* START Bitbucket Smart Mirror\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nThe Smart Mirror should synchronize the branch changes.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nSmart Mirror is unable synchronize any changes to the repository.

Issue Summary\r\n\r\nBitbucket Server 7.4 introduced changes which replace the use of blocking I/O for interacting with {{git http-backend}}, {{git receive-pack}} and {{git upload-pack}} with non-blocking I/O. The new approach appears to have performance issues _unique to Windows_ which makes clones slower than they were with the previous blocking I/O code. _This does not apply to Linux, where speed is unaffected._\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Upgrade to Bitbucket Server 7.4.0 or newer\r\n # Perform a clone over HTTP or SSH\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nClone speeds are at least equal to speeds on 7.3 and prior.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nClone speeds are significantly slower. While exact numbers are hard to pin down, BIO-based hosting appears to be 10x faster than NIO.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nDisable NIO-based hosting for HTTP and SSH. _This is a short-term workaround_ as the ability to switch back to BIO-based hosting will be removed in a future version of Bitbucket Server.
