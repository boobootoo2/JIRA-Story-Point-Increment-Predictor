We are taking actions to solve this scenario as well.\r\n * There is also a handful of sites with\u00a0add-on configurations\u00a0that will need to be manually fixed and Atlassian is contacting the plugin vendors to solve that situation.",

Summary\r\nThe JIRA Issue Macro can contain a JQL query like: {{fixVersion in (\"1.0\", \"1.1\")}}\r\n\r\nIf the macro is inserted with a query like that, or an existing one is edited, by Firefox or IE11, everything from the first double-quote onwards is removed.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to reproduce\r\n# Create a Cloud instance with JIRA and Confluence.\r\n# Create a project in both, create a JIRA issue, then create a Fix Version \"1.0\" in the JIRA project and add that to the new issue.\r\n# Using Firefox (I tested with the latest 49.0.2) or IE11, Create a page in Confluence, go to Insert > JIRA Issue/Filter\r\n# Type {{fixVersion = \"1.0\"}} in the search field, insert the macro, then save the page.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected results\r\nThe JIRA issue macro on the page shows the JIRA issue that was created in Step 2.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual results\r\nConfluence says \"JIRA project doesn't exist or you don't have permission to view it.\"\r\n\r\nUpon clicking the \"View these issues in JIRA\" link, the JQL is {{fixVersion =}} and that's it.\r\n\r\nh3. Notes\r\nThe draft that is saved into the database is being saved wrongly from the outset even before publishing. Running a {{SELECT body FROM bodycontent WHERE contentid = <ID of draft>}} results in this JQL parameter in the storage format:\r\n\r\n{code:xml}\r\n<ac:parameter ac:name=\"jqlQuery\">fixVersion = </ac:parameter>\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nIf you click Edit on the macro before saving, it still shows the full correct JQL search in the UI.\r\n\r\nThis issue occurs regardless of what the query is, it just needs double-quotes in it somewhere.",
