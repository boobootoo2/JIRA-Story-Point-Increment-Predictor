As result SubGit plugin has no information on performed action. Next time the plugin synchronizes Git repository with Subversion server, it resurrects deleted Git branch since its SVN counterpart still presents in the latest revision.\r\n\r\nAs a workaround Stash user has to delete source branch manually as soon as pull request is merged:\r\n{code}\r\ngit push <origin> --delete <branch>\r\n{code}\r\nWe would appreciate if Stash could somehow notify our plugin on source branch deletion when user merges pull request.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance,\r\nSemyon",

Your input in the comments helps us understand how this affects you and what you're hoping to accomplish with Bitbucket Data Center.\r\n\r\nWe spend a significant amount of time determining our product investments in Bitbucket Data Center. Unfortunately, we are not planning to address this suggestion in the next 12 months. In the last year, we have resolved many of the highly voted suggestions like Reviewer groups, Pull request templates, capability to enable/disable source branch deletion on merging pull requests and our upcoming roadmap includes a number of other top voted suggestions, including repository archiving. Please check out our [public roadmap|https://www.atlassian.com/roadmap/data-center?product=bitbucket] for more details on the coming soon and future items.\r\n\r\nI understand that this may be disappointing, but it\u2019s important for us to be open, honest, and transparent with our customers. Product feedback is collected from many different sources and is evaluated when planning the product roadmap. You can\u00a0[learn more about our process here|https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/110373/how-does-the-jira-team-use-jira-atlassian-com].\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nImran Khan\r\nProduct Manager - Bitbucket Data Center & Server\r\n{panel}\r\nWe miss the ability to inspect and update pull requests before actually publishing them to reviewers.\r\n\r\nThis is especially convenient when you have automatically added reviewers on a repository.\r\n\r\nThis is a feature that was much appreciated by developers when we where using ReviewBoard.",

I have another ticket open [ https://ecosystem.atlassian.net/browse/AMPS-1071 ] related the fact that the SDK doesn't let me create Stash plugins later than 2.8.4, although that's slightly moot since I am targeting 2.8.4.\r\n\r\nTo reproduce, create a simple plugin:\r\n\r\n{{atlas-create-stash-plugin}}\r\n\r\nthen create stash-plugin-modules:\r\n\r\n{{atlas-create-stash-plugin-module}}\r\n\r\nSelect '2', for Component Import.

      "description": "*Background*\r\n\r\nWe are currently evaluating whether we could replace Crucible by Stash and its Pull Request feature. So far, Stash's ability to create pull requests in combination with its Branching Model looks very promising.\r\n\r\nHowever, we stumbled upon the following issue:\r\n\r\n*Present Situation*\r\n\r\nCurrently, new commits to a branch (for instance, feature branch) that is involved in an open pull request (for instance, from that feature branch to the main development branch) are _automatically_ added to that open pull request.\r\n\r\n*Feature Request*\r\n\r\nIt should be configurable whether new commits would be automatically added to an open pull request or not.\r\n\r\nIf not, Stash would not automatically add new commits to the open pull request but would put those commits into some queue (or something like that). From there, selected commits could be explicitly added to a new pull request. This would prevent that new aspects which might be introduced by further commits would \"slip\" into existing reviews although those aspects should be discussed in separate reviews.\r\n\r\n*Rationale*\r\n\r\nWe have feature branches that typically live for a couple of days (up to one or even two weeks - they are created via Stories in JIRA Agile). At the same time, we encourage developers to push their daily changes every evening to enable reviewers to give swift feedback on that daily work. This again allows developers to incorporate important feedback as soon as possible (particularly, not only at the end of the Sprint).\r\n\r\nIdeally, the reviewer would approve such an pull request early in the morning; thus, immediately. However, sometimes the review reveals weak spots and the developer would have to make smaller fixes. For such fixing commits, it is absolutely fine to be automatically added to the open pull request - because these commits affect aspects that are already part of the pull request. For comparison: In Crucible, the developer would explicitly add these commits to the ongoing review (via smart commits - how cool is that?).\r\n\r\nBeyond that, frequently there are new commits that add new aspects, too - just because the story is not yet completed and thus being developed in the said feature branch and pull request, respectively. In this case, these commits should _not_ be automatically added to the open pull request. Instead, they should be addressed in a new pull request that would explicitly cover the new aspects. Again, for comparison: In Crucible, such new commits would be added to a new review but not the existing one.",

As the issue hasn't collect votes, watchers, comments, or support cases from many customers during its lifetime, it's very low on our priority list, and will not be fixed in the foreseeable future. That's why we've decided to resolve it as *Timed Out*.\r\n\r\nAlthough we're aware the issue is still important to those of you who were involved in the conversations around it, we want to be clear in managing your expectations. The Bitbucket Server team is focusing on issues that have broad impact and high value, reflected by the number of comments, votes, support cases, and customers interested. Please consult the [Atlassian Bugfix Policy|https://confluence.atlassian.com/support/atlassian-bug-fixing-policy-201294573.html] for more details.\r\n\r\nWe understand how disappointing this decision may be, but we hope you'll appreciate our transparent approach and communication. If you're really passionate about this suggestion, please comment with your case in detail and we'll reconsider. Atlassian will continue to watch this issue for further updates, so please feel free to share your thoughts in the comments.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nImran Khan\r\nProduct Manager - Bitbucket Server and Data Center\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to have a way to compare 2 versions of a document for a pull request.  This way people can comment on lines within the document.\r\n\r\nI understand that this is primarily for code/text based reviews, but we would like to be able to use this workflow to handle document review as well",

Our deliverable projects are large and made up of multiple smaller component projects each with multiple repositories (it all adds up to hundreds of repositories in a final deliverable project).\r\n\r\nIt would be very useful to our developers if they could receive emails on changes being pushed to the server for certain parts of the code that are of especial interest to them. You already have the concept of watching a pull request, it would be nice if this could be extended to allow a user to watch:\r\n\r\n1. A branch - See any pushes to that branch\r\n 2. A repository - See any pushes to that repository on any branch\r\n 3. A project - See any pushes to any branch of any repository in that project.\r\n\r\nA REST API to add and remove yourself as a watcher would also be usefull so we can script setting up watch lists accross entire projects if need be.\r\n\r\nWhile there are some plugins that allow this a lot of the time they require admin permissions to the module to allow you edit the plugins email settings to add and remove users. Watching should only require read permissions to a repository as it doesn't require making any changes.",
