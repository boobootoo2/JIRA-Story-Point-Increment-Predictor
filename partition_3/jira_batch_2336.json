Summary\r\nAfter an application link is defined between two applications, remote events are only sent from one application to the other after the capabilities of the applications have been shared. This discovery happens consistantly while the applications are running. Restarting both applications however, causes a temporary failure because the first discovery attempt will usually fail if the target application doesn't start quickly enough. This is not problematic by itself but the discovery attempts occur with an exponential delay.  \r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Install Bitbucket Server.\r\n# Install Bamboo.\r\n# Set up an application link between Bamboo and Bitbucket Server.\r\n# And a repo in Bamboo.\r\n# Confirm that remote events are getting sent by Bitbucket Server.\r\n# Stop both Bitbucket Server and Bamboo.\r\n# Start Bitbucket Server and then start Bamboo.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nRemote events are sent from Bitbucket Server to Bamboo.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nSince Bamboo isn't available immediately, Bitbucket Server waits to check its capabilities again, which in turn delays remote events. \r\n\r\n\r\nh3.Workaround\r\nFor customers on versions < 4.14.3 set either one of the following system properties will fix the problem:\r\n- {{navlink.failurecache.backoff=2}} \r\n- {{navlink.failurecache.maxExpiryMs=1}} ",

Cause\r\nThe pull request is not up to date with the tip of the *source* branch, or the tip of the *target* branch.\r\nWhen new commits are made to the *source* or the *target*, the pull request should be rescoped - in other words, recalculated to test whether the PR will be successful against the current state of both the *source* and the *target*. Under some rare circumstances, this rescoping might not have happened, meaning that the pull request is out of sync with the state of the *source* or *target* branches, and so attempting to merge from the PR will fail.\r\nThere are a couple of reasons for this to occur:\r\n* New commits being received to branches, and the rescoping of PR's to include the latest commits, is inherently subject to race conditions. Whilst this is a rare occurrence it is possible on very busy repositories for this to happen. Normally this should resolve itself.\r\n* On a clustered instance, where all nodes use Hazelcast to share objects in memory, there are some edge case scenarios where Hazelcast objects may fail to be kept up to date.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n* Wait a minute to allow the PR to be rescoped, then refresh the page and retry merging the PR\r\n* Decline the PR and reopen it to force the PR to be rescoped manually, then merge it\r\n* Restart Bitbucket Server. On a clustered instance, a full cluster shutdown needs to be performed (so all nodes are shut down before restarting any). You should only try this if the issue occurs repeatedly and the above workarounds are not working.",

      "description": "I leveraged SubGit to migrate an internal SVN repository to internal Bitbucket. The migration is successful and all the content is there: branches, tags, & commit history.\r\n\r\nHowever, there seems to be an issue with how the SVN committer id is\u00a0mapped to Bitbucket identities. In the attached image, you see commit history for a repo migrated from SVN. The bottom 5 commits were brought over from the migration - you see that the author is not a\u00a0link and it is id rather than name. The top commit,\u00a0_842aed3344b_, was performed\u00a0after the migration and shows the author as <fname lname> and is a hyperlink to the user's profile.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n----\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nSame as git-svn, SubGit takes a plain text authors file as input. My\u00a0authors file contains a single line:\r\n{code:java}\r\npzm84r = Jourdan West <jourdan.west@gm.com>{code}\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nIt seems that the value on the right side of '=' is not enough to identify a user in Bitbucket. I've tried different variations of adding domain to the left side as follows - nothing works:\r\n{code:java}\r\nNAM\\pzm84r = Jourdan West <jourdan.west@gm.com>{code}\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nIs this an issue with my author's file? If so, how should my author's file look such that the commit author is shown as an id with hyperlink ?\r\n\r\n\u00a0",

      "description": "h3. Background\r\n\r\nProjects that decide to organize the source code of a complex system into different repos usually use the [Git submodule feature|https://git-scm.com/docs/git-submodule] to put the repos together into a system. Any change thus requires more than one branch and pull request:\r\n * one or more feature branches and pull requests in the child repos where the real changes are being made\r\n * a feature branch and pull request in the parent repo, which is changed to reflect the configuration of the system with the new commits in the child repos\r\n\r\nBBS is not currently supporting this use case well, since it doesn't recognize the parent/child relationship of the branches and pull requests.\r\nh3. Solution\r\n * The user can easily create a branch in a child repo via a branch in the parent repo. Example: The user selects a given feature branch in the parent repo in BBS and selects the menu entry \"Create submodule branches\". The result is one or more new branches in the specified child repos. BBS regards these branches as \"submodule branches\" and notes that they are related to the branch in the parent repo. The branch page in the parent repo displays related submodule branches and vice-versa.\r\n * Submodule branches are listed in the pull request for the parent branch and the user can easily create new pull requests in the child repos. Example: Having created a pull request in the parent repo, the user sees the submodule branches and creates pull requests in them from the parent pull request. The branches with new commits are specially marked to make it obvious where pull requests are needed. A convenience option such as \"Create pull requests for submodules\" could create pull requests in all submodule branches that have commits but lack pull requests.\r\n * The resulting pull requests in the child repos are displayed in the parent pull request. The user can thus easily see the related pull requests, as well as their statuses, and conveniently navigate among them. The pull requests in the child repos also show their relationship to the parent pull request, making it convenient to navigate to the parent request.\r\n * The diff section of the parent pull request provides an option to show the actual diffs in the child repos.\r\n * A pull request option is provided that blocks merging a pull request in the parent repo if there are unmerged submodule pull requests.\r\n * The BBS api provides a way to find the parent of a submodule pull request and vice-versa. Same for submodule branches.\r\n\r\nThe GUI could be modelled on the Jira issue/subtask feature.\r\n\r\nh3. Variant Solution\r\n\r\nInstead of having separate pull requests in the child repos, there is just one pull request in the parent repo, covering all the changes. This is probably preferable to the above solution, since it saves the user the trouble of moving between different pull requests and keeps the review in one place.",

Summary\r\nWhen migrating between external user directories that are configured as _Read Only with local groups_, any users that existed in both directories and had custom local groups set will lose those local groups when the old user directory is disabled.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Connect Bitbucket to LDAP and sync a user, let's call her Susan. At this point, Susan should be a member of the default users group, e.g. *bitbucket-users*\r\n# Create a new group in Bitbucket, *bitbucket-local-test*, and add Susan to that group\r\n# Connect Bitbucket to a new ActiveDirectory server, also containing the user _Susan_\r\n# Sync the new directory. At this stage, Susan should be a member of *bitbucket-users*, of your *bitbucket-local-test* group, and of whatever other groups were defined in LDAP and your new ActiveDirectory\r\n# Disconnect the original LDAP server and check Susan's group memberships\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nUsing the above example, Susan should continue to be a member of the *bitbucket-local-test* group. In other words, a user's local groups should be retained, independent of the source user directory\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nSusan's membership to the *bitbucket-local-test* group disappears. Local groups are lost during a migration between external directories.\r\n\r\nh3.Workaround\r\nRe-add the users to their local directories, or manage them fully in the external user directory server and do not use the _Read only with local groups_ setting",

Post upgrade to 4.11.1, we find that this is no longer the behaviour due to bug BSERV-8748. The JIRA Dev Panel now only shows the commits for the parent, and ONLY unique commits for the fork.\r\n\r\nh3. Problem Impact\r\n\r\nThis change to BitBucket affects us by limiting visibility into code deployments.\r\n\r\nIn our workflow with \"legacy\" clients, separate forks exist for the DEV, STAGING, and PROD environments. Before this behavior change, we could see the status of each commit on a per-environment basis directly in the Jira ticket.\r\n\r\nNow that only the first unique commit is shown, the only way for us to know which commits have been merged to which environments is to download the repos and manually grep through the git logs for each individual commit hash.\r\n\r\nWhile this is still workable, this task has gone from taking a couple seconds per ticket to a couple minutes, and is now more error-prone.\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nPerhaps it makes sense to stop the list at a certain (user-configurable) number of forks, or only X forks with the most recent activity, and put the rest behind a \"show more\" button in the JIRA UI.\r\n \r\n",

Problem Definition\r\nLFS in Bitbucket Server currently does not allow files to be stored in an alternate location, thus limiting the size of files to the size of {{BITBUCKET_HOME/shared}}\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\nAllow LFS to use alternate locations.\r\n\r\nh3. Why this is important\r\nTo allow large instances to manage their storage needs without outgrowing a single volume or location, which may be limited by IT's ability to provide one large volume.\r\n \r\nh3. Workaround \r\nNone at this time\r\n\r\n\r\n{panel:title=Update 27-Apr-2017|borderStyle=solid|borderColor=#3c78b5|titleBGColor=#3c78b5|bgColor=#e7f4fa}\r\nThis suggestion was becoming complicated with a number of different use cases and implied solutions. To resolve this I have opened a separate issue for storage of LFS object in Artifactory, and one already exists for S3.\r\n\r\nSo I'd like to focus *this issue* on \"alternate locations\" but still hosted by Bitbucket Server. There are a number of possible solutions that might achieve this, for example: LFS storage being hosted across multiple filesystem mount points.\r\n\r\nFor other \"alternate locations\" please see:\r\n\r\n[BSERV-9125 - Support for AWS S3 storage of LFS files|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/BSERV-9125]\r\n[BSERV-9721 - Support for Artifactory storage of LFS files|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/BSERV-9721]\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\n",

This can mean that if a user is performing long running Git LFS transfers, that the SSH session will be killed during the upload of LFS files.\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\nBitbucket Server could be able to sent keep alive packets to ensure that the ssh session was kept alive without the client having to set up their own keep alive settings.\r\n \r\nh3. Workaround\r\nSet {{ServerAliveInterval}} to a value that is lower than 10 minutes in the relevant config file for your system (~/.ssh/config for OpenSsh systems). If your Bitbucket instance is behind a load balancer, you'll need to set {{ServerAliveInterval}} to less than 10 minutes, or your load balancers' idle timeout. Whichever is lower. \r\n\r\nNote: If using SourceTree, you must change your SSH agent from PuTTY to OpenSSH in order to successfully apply this configuration.
