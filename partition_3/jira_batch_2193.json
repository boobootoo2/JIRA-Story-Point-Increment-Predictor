[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFSERVER-15160].\n  {panel}\n\nFor large confluence installation it is important to have RemoteAPI access to Confluence, but at the same time, it is not desirable to give the remote access to everyone and everywhere. For this reason a new permission that would control access to the remote API is needed. \n\nIt is unimaginable to have Confluence admins of big instances decide who should get the remote api access and for which space. Such a decision should be delegated to the space admins, which are the content owners for the given space and can make a qualified decision about the access via the RemoteAPI for their space.\n\nFor this reason a new space permission is needed. This space permission would be controlled as any other permission via the Space Admin -> Permissions view.\n\nA patch with this functionality was developed against Confluence 2.x and the patch provided is rebased for 2.10.2. Patch was written in a minimalistic way in order to introduce minimal performance penalty and make it easy to port it between different confluence versions.\n\nIn our case we wanted to restrict access to global remote api calls only to confluence admins as well, so we created a patch for that too (attached as remote-api-admin-authorization.patch). It would be nice if this patch was rewritten so that an individual global permission to access these global methods exists too, but this isn't as important for us as having the space permission patch accepted to the confluence source base. I'm attaching both patches just to give you an idea of what we do. It's up to you if you decide to take the admin patch and rewrite it so that a global permission exists as well.\n\nThe order in which patches should be applied to confluence source base is {{remote-api-admin-authorization.patch}} -> {{remote-api-authorization.patch}}.\n",

The fact that Confluence (and evidently other Atlassian applications, as I just discovered while entering this issue and accidentally typed \"Ctrl-B\") overrides these fundamental text editing shortcuts with its own makes it extremely painful to compose large amounts of text in the browser.\n\nIt is so bad that typically I resort to copying the contents of a Confluence page that I am editing into a text editor, edit the text, and then paste it back into the browser. This is because it is incredibly inconvenient when the cursor jumps to another text field or the page navigates away from what I am editing (in the middle of typing), simply because I am trying to use one of the above standard MacOSX text entry shortcuts.\n",

When new users get started with Confluence, they often fail to notice the \"Minor change\" checkbox during page saves. This results in large numbers of email updates being sent to other users, who then complain (often) to me.\n\nA co-worker recently asked if \"minor change\" could be checked by default, but of course that would lead to a different set of problems. As an alternative, I'd like to suggest that you remove the \"minor change\" checkbox completely, and replace it with two separate save buttons labeled \"Save and Notify\" and \"Save without Notification\" or something similar. I believe that this would be easy for users to understand, and would completely solve our \"minor change\" dilemma.",

When I add users or groups to a space and then give permissions, it would be nice if there was an \"All\" button, so I don't have to click all the checkboxes. It's not a big deal if you're just adding one, but if you're adding a bunch, it's a pain in the neck to click all the checkboxes for each user or group when it would be pretty easy to add one All javascript checkbox that would then check all the permissions for that user/group.\n\nThank you.",

I'm sure this matter has been discussed previously, but I didn't find readily a forum posting that summarizes the issues as my wiki users and I see them.\n\nThe problem is that users receive too many email notifications that most people consider unhelpful at best and very annoying at worst. The control mechanisms currently available in Confluence 2.10 are inadequate to control sending email notifications, and \"watch\" options available to users can not make up for this deficiency.\n\nI think we can divide actions and content into new, edited and removed pages, comments, news, and attachments as summarized below:\n\nContent Type \tNew \tEdited \tRemoved\nPage \t- \tX \t-\nComment \t- \t- \t-\nNews \t- \t- \t-\nAttachment \t- \t- \t-\n\n\nThe X shows the only option, as far as I can tell, for preventing sending email notifications.\n\nPer this chart, email notifications are automatically sent out for all combinations EXCEPT for edited pages based on whether users check the \"Minor Change?\" option box. (Searching the Confluence forum for \"minor change\" provides several conversations on this matter back at least to 2006.)\n\nWe find particularly annoying email notifications resulting from removing content. As administrator, I have removed pages, comments, and attachments as inappropriate or obsolete and have almost certainly not wanted to bring attention to that removed content.\n\nWe also believe email notifications about attachments (added, moved, or removed) to be of very low value. Attachments are almost always supporting or described by the page content itself which will be the subject of its own email notification.\n\nMy users and I believe it is past time for Atlassian to provide users and administrators better control in Confluence over sending these email notifications. This includes, but is not limited to, improving the \"Minor Change?\" option with clear option buttons or similar mechanisms as discussed in other forum entries.\n\nI look forward to elaboration of this issue by other users and action by Atlassian on this matter. \n{quote}",

So, they need to have the wiki pages and any relevant attachments in an email so when they get on the plane or train, they can work on the issue. The problem we are having is:\n\nWhen a page is emailed, either from a watch or emailing it from tools, we need to have it include attachments\n\nAre there any solutions?

I can appreciate not wanting to promote the removal of pages, but it is a necessary evil, and should be easier to do. My suggestions are:\n\n1) Prompt to also remove or relocate child pages when deleting a parent. This would be a big improvement on its own.\n2) Have a checkbox somewhere on the \"Browse Pages\" section to allow removing multiple pages in one action. Currently we have to navigate to a page, click \"remove\", confirm, we're redirected to the space homepage..... Rinse and repeat for multiple deletions :-(\n3) Make the process an ajax enabled one, thereby minimising the time spent doing so\n4) somewhere on the \"Browse Pages\" allow us to drag and drop pages onto a trsh can icon",

Confluence does not support VM, but often customers are not aware of this. The particularly sneaky part of this is that many configurations will run fine up to a certain point; the performance problems that can happen are unpredictable. \n\nCONF-11301 is about clarifying when and why performance issues happen with virtual environments. This is a separate request, to detect that the OS is virtual and throw a warning, like the server base URL and XML backup warnings. \n\nI don't know how to detect VM at an OS level - it seems tricky as VM providers don't necessarily provide an easy way to destinguish, at least not a java system property. There are a few forums, like [this|http://stackoverflow.com/questions/154163/detect-virtualized-os-from-an-application].",

When I upgrade on my QA server I can go through the repository and click Test Plugin button and it would test the macros for that plug-in and let me know if it works or fails.

This plugin provides critical functionality that frankly should have been  part of Confluence. Looking at communications from Atlassian staff, it's clear you guys recognize this module's usefulness.\n\nPer http://developer.atlassian.com/jira/browse/META-107, the Metadata plugin is basically unsupported even though it has 81 issues going back 3 years.\n\nEven the CMS Watch found fault with your maintenance of the Metadata module in its 2009 _The Enterprise Social Software & Collaboration Report_: \"several [important] plugins remain unsupported... . For example, the popular Metadata plugin ... is not supported officially, so you might find yourself in a tough spot if the original developer decides to work on something else.\"",
