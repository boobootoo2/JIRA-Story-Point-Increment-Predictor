The problem is, contrary to the built-in sprint event type, our future sprints events are not line-up. Instead, they will stack randomly with other events. During periods where lot's of team members take vacations, the future sprint events will be all over the place. This is far from ideal.

Trying to create a Calendar now results in the following error:\n\nThere was a SQL exception thrown by the Active Objects library: Database: - name:Oracle - version:Oracle Database 11g Enterprise Edition Release 11.1.0.7.0 - 64bit Production With the Partitioning, OLAP, Data Mining and Real Application Testing options - minor version:1 - major version:11 Driver: - name:Oracle JDBC driver - version:11.1.0.7.0-Production java.sql.SQLException: An SQLException was provoked by the following failure: java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: 11\n\nSince about version 4.2 we've not been able to create Calendars. This error message was not previously displayed, the Create Calendar dialog would remain after clicking the button, but the AJAX response was some similar status 500 error message. So at least displaying an error message is a step in the right direction.\n\nI've tried doubling the Java heap space, as that was the only advice I could find to resolve ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.\n\nIn production we reverted to Team Calendars 4.1.4, as this was the last known working version (we evaluated this version and it worked). Since we purchased the product, none of the more recent versions have been working for us so we're sticking with version 4.1.4 and monitoring the situation on our dev server.",

Summary\n\nWhen a user whose name contains double quote characters is an ORGANIZER of an event, when an export to ICS is done, the ORGANIZER line is both improperly quoted, and the wrong length for line folding. The quote gets converted to a HTML entity i.e. &amp;quot; which contains the illegal character semi-colon, and additionally the line length is treated as if it still took up only one character, so it wraps after longer than 75 characters. Note that for unaffected lines Team Calendar also seems to be wrapping at 73 characters instead of 75, which while valid, is not necessary.\n\nAs per the [RFC 2445|https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2445#section-4.8.4.3], a double quote character is actually illegal except for quoting other characters, but additionally a semi-colon is an illegal character for a parameter value unless it's contained in a quote or escaped. It's not possible to escape a double quote as part of the parameter value, which must be why it's converted into a HTML entity.\n\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\n\n# Create a calendar\n# Create an event with an organizer whose name contains at least one double quote character\n# Export the calendar\n\nh3. Expected Results\n\nA valid ICS file\n\nh3. Actual Results\n\nThe file is not valid ICS.\n\nh3.Workaround\n\nManually edit the ICS file, locating the lines containing &amp;quot; and modify the CN to be quoted, then re-do the line folding such that the line does not exceed 75 octets.\n\nFor example the following invalid entry:\n\n{noformat}\nORGANIZER;X-CONF-USERNAME=username;CN=&quot;User Name&quot;:mailto:username@exampl\n e.com\n{noformat}\n\nCan be converted to this valid entry:\n\n{noformat}\nORGANIZER;X-CONF-USERNAME=username;CN=\"&quot;User Name&quot;\":mailto:user\n name@example.com\n{noformat}\n\nAlternatively, if you avoid having any users with names containing a double quote character, then you will not encounter this issue.",
