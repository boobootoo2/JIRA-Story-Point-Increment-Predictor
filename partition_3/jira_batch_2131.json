Confluence would benefit from a way to quickly and easily \"brand\" a space visually.\n\nh5. Work in progress\nI've attached a mockup showing some early thinking we've done. This is _not_ final, but does show you one of our current ideas about how this could work.\n\nYou'd be able to:\n* Apply a banner across the top of the Space Homepage\n* Have it shown in a stylised view at the top of the sidebar\n* Have the option to turn the Space avatar off completely in the sidebar\n\nAs you can see, this gives plenty of room to put much richer branding across the space.\n\nh5. Feedback\nWe'd love to get general feedback on how useful this would be overall and to answer some specific questions:\n* Would you like to see the banner on all pages in the space, or just the home page?\n* Is the opaque stylised treatment applied to the banner acceptable to those with branding guidelines to meet?\n* Would you want to keep the space name or have it turn off along with the space logo?",

Previously in 4.3.7 on clicking of the Users link, it used to opens up the users search screen without doing any search. It navigates to the URL confluence/admin/users/browseusers.action in the browser. \nBut now in 5.5.3, on clicking of the Users link, it is opening up the user search after searching all the users. It is navigating to the URL confluence/admin/users/showallusers.action in the browser.\nI do not want the search to happen on click of Users because it is taking long time to open up the user search page.\nTo change this behavior I tried to modify the viewuser.vm file present inside /confluence/admin/users directory. I changed href=\"browseusers.action\" from href=\"showallusers.action\" but the URL did not get change and the search is happening after the change also.\nIt will be really helpful if anybody can provide pointers for the places where I need to change to modify the URL so that the automatic search will not happen.",

Steps to Reproduce:\n # Set up Confluence and create a user (eg Jessie Jones: jjones)\n # Create a page under a dummy space\n -- Add a \\{noformat} macro to the page - this step is required because the issue only occurs if there is CDATA elsewhere on the page.\n -- Mention jjones.\n # Generate an xml export of the space\n # Delete the space from the instance\n # Open entities.xml and find the userkey for jjones, and modify it so it is different to the userkey in the system. Make sure you modify every occurrance.\n # Import the space back into Confluence\n # You will see that the mentions will be broken:\n !broken_link.png|thumbnail!\n\nh4. Workaround prior to import\n # Open the zip file and edit entities.xml\n # Find all occurrences of {{]] >}} (note the space)\n # Replace with {{]]]]><![CDATA[>}}\n # Import the space\n\nh4. Workaround after import\n\nFor a full update of your instance, see [User mentions appear as Broken link after XML import|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/CONFKB/User+mentions+appear+as+Broken+link+after+XML+import]\n\nFor update of individual entries, read on.\n # Shutdown Confluence B.\n # Run below query against *Confluence A* database:\n{code:java}select * from user_mapping\nwhere username = 'jjones';\n{code}\n(i) Above example is jjones but you will need to use the user name of the user that got the broken mention.\n # Copy the user_key.\n # Now run below query against *Confluence B*\n{code:java}select * from user_mapping\nwhere username = 'jjones';\n{code}\n(i) Above example is jjones but you will need to use the user name of the user that got the broken mention.\n # Copy the user key.\n # At this point we will have two user keys for user jjones, one from *Confluence A* and the other for *Confluence B*.\n # Now Run the following query against *Confluence B* database:\n (!) Backup *Confluence B* before doing the update query\n{code:java}UPDATE BODYCONTENT \nSET BODY = CAST(replace (cast(BODY as nvarchar(max)), 'user key from step 3' , 'user key from step 5') as ntext)\nwhere BODY like '%user key from step 3%';\n{code}\n(i) The above query was designed to MS SQL Server, if you are using other databases like Oracle/Postegres/MySQL as your DBA to adapt the query.\n # Start Confluence B, check for the broken macros again (it should be resolved).\n # If you notice any otehr problems or the macros did not got resolved then shutdown Confluence and rollback your database using the backup taken before the update procedure.\n\nh4. Workaround after import if the original system is not accessible\nNB: This workaround requires the original export file for reference.\n# As an administrator, go to the page and click '...' and View Storage Format. \n# Grab the value of ri:userkey, eg {{ri:userkey=\"40288ac6444668f70144466ab1e70003\"}}\n# Open entities.xml from the export file\n# Search for the userkey. You will find a ConfluenceUserImpl object that looks like this:\n{code} <object class=\"ConfluenceUserImpl\" package=\"com.atlassian.confluence.user\">\n<id name=\"key\"><![CDATA[8a81818556b603360156b603fad80002]]></id>\n<property name=\"name\"><![CDATA[admin]]></property>\n<property name=\"lowerName\"><![CDATA[admin]]></property>\n</object>{code}\n# Inside the name property you will find the username, in this case it is 'admin': {{<property name=\"name\"><![CDATA[admin]]></property>}}\n# Edit the page and change the mention to that username\n\nh4. Notes:\n\nThe reason why this happens it's because the mention macro uses the user_key to make the reference to the target user instead of the username.\n{code:java}<ri:user ri:userkey=\"40288ac6444668f70144466ab1e70003\"/>\n{code}\nDuring the import Confluence will not identify that jjones exist in both instances and that the source user_key needs to be updated with the target user_key.\n\nThis will only happen with Confluence instances on version 5.2.3 and latest since previous versions relies on the username instead of the user_key.",

It it quite useful. We have tested the changes and all works great  (only the checkbox \"Copy Space Layout\" is needed as for pdf settings). \n\nMany thanks for Confluence, guys, it helps us much =)",

We are ending up restarting the server to clear the queue. In certain cases, it is crashing the Wiki.\n\nThanks,\nPavel",

Currently, since the hook is broken, the result link displays the JSON content of diagrams, which is obviously not useful to our users.\n\nThis functionality seems to be missing since Confluence 5.2. Here is a recent Atlassian answer which notes the removal: https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/307952/create-a-search-result-renderer\n\nPlease put this functionality back in, or let us know what the new way to do this is. Thank you!\n\nThe current workaround is to click the gray Confluence page link below the search result description:\n\n !gliffy_diagram_search_result.png! ",
