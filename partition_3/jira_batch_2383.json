Your input in the comments helps us understand how this affects you and what you're hoping to accomplish with Stash.\r\n\r\nThis suggestion is a priority for the Stash development team and is on our roadmap, however we're not able to provide a timeline for when it will be resolved.\r\n\r\nProduct feedback is collected from a number of different sources and is evaluated when planning the product roadmap. You can [learn more about our process here|https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/110373/how-does-the-jira-team-use-jira-atlassian-com].\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nRoger Barnes\r\nProduct Manager - Stash\r\n\r\n{panel}\r\n*Original request description:*\r\n\r\nForcing all merges to a certain branch (except for key people) to go via pull requests is currently possible in branch permissions.\r\n\r\nPull Requests give traceability and the option to comment on code being merged in - in addition, developers can use plugins and merge checks to add additional controls and warnings to the Pull Request page.\r\n\r\nThis means that automated checks can be added as merge checks and the people that can be allowed to merge is greater than those who can push - a pre-receive hook doesn't allow good feedback or warnings to the user (as well as not having the context of the branch being merged in, the author etc), so  allowing only a restricted set of users to push but allowing all to merge a pull request is desirable.",

Your input in the comments helps us understand how this affects you and what you're hoping to accomplish with Bitbucket Server.\r\n\r\nWe spend a significant amount of time on an ongoing basis to determine our product investments in Bitbucket Server. Unfortunately, we are not currently planning to address this suggestion in the next 12 months. In the last 12 months, we've resolved 10 of the top 30 feature requests, and our upcoming roadmap includes a number of other top voted suggestions, including in-browser editing, improvements to search functionality, better JIRA integration, and providing an even better code review experience.\r\n\r\nI understand that this may be disappointing, but we believe it\u2019s important for us to be open, honest and transparent with our customers. Product feedback is collected from a number of different sources and is evaluated when planning the product roadmap. You can [learn more about our process here|https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/110373/how-does-the-jira-team-use-jira-atlassian-com].\r\n\r\nNorman Ma\r\n\r\nProduct Manager - Bitbucket Server\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\n*Original request description*\r\n\r\nWith stash 1.3, the description put into a pull requests only exists in the request.

Your input in the comments helps us understand how this affects you and what you're hoping to accomplish with Bitbucket Server.\r\n\r\nThere's definite interest in offering this functionality; the broader team have had quite a few conversations about it. Unfortunately, at the moment, there are significant technical challenges to overcome for server-side rebases to be viable. We have to keep instances that use pull requests heavily in mind, and the additional load of rebase operations is likely to significantly impact their scalability.\r\n\r\nWhile it's unlikely that we'll be able to address this suggestion in the near future, we will continue to regularly consider how and when we might.\r\n\r\nProduct feedback is collected from a number of different sources and is evaluated when planning the product roadmap. You can [learn more about our process here|https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/110373/how-does-the-jira-team-use-jira-atlassian-com].\r\n\r\nNorman Ma\r\n\r\nProduct Manager - Bitbucket Server\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\n*Original request description*\r\n\r\nAs a Stash user, I would prefer to use a rebase workflow vs. a merge workflow for my Pull Requests.\r\n\r\nThis workflow permits to automatically obtain the following:\r\n* When a PR is being merged:\r\n** Condense (squash/rebase) all the commits in the source branch in a single one and leave that single commit on the branch\r\n** Create a new merge commit on the target branch\r\n\r\nSo for every PR merged the expected outcome will be:\r\n* One commit on the source branch containing *ALL* the changes made on the branch\r\n* One commit on the target branch for the merge itself \r\n\r\nFor more information on rebase workflows, please see:\r\n* [A rebase-based workflow|http://unethicalblogger.com/2010/04/02/a-rebase-based-workflow.html]\r\n* [A Rebase Workflow for Git|http://randyfay.com/content/rebase-workflow-git]\r\n* [A Simple Git Rebase Workflow, Explained|http://mettadore.com/analysis/a-simple-git-rebase-workflow-explained/]\r\n* [A Git Workflow for Agile Teams|http://reinh.com/blog/2009/03/02/a-git-workflow-for-agile-teams.html]\r\n* [Our Git Workflow|http://brandonkonkle.com/blog/2010/apr/28/our-git-workflow/]\r\n\r\nThis is related to STASH-2873.\r\n\r\nJordan Dea-Mattson",

Your input in the comments helps us understand how this affects you and what you're hoping to accomplish with Bitbucket Data Center.\r\n\r\nWe spend a significant amount of time determining our product investments in Bitbucket Data Center. Unfortunately, we are not planning to address this suggestion in the next 12 months. In the last year, we have resolved many of the highly voted suggestions like Reviewer groups, Pull request templates, capability to enable/disable source branch deletion on merging pull requests and our upcoming roadmap includes a number of other top voted suggestions, including repository archiving. Please check out our [public roadmap|https://www.atlassian.com/roadmap/data-center?product=bitbucket] for more details on the coming soon and future items.\r\n\r\nI understand that this may be disappointing, but it\u2019s important for us to be open, honest, and transparent with our customers. Product feedback is collected from many different sources and is evaluated when planning the product roadmap. You can\u00a0[learn more about our process here|https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/110373/how-does-the-jira-team-use-jira-atlassian-com].\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nImran Khan\r\n\r\nProduct Manager - Bitbucket Data Center & Server\r\n{panel}\r\n*Original request description*\r\n\r\nShow activity across repositories in Stash.",

      "description": "Hi mates.\r\n\r\nA customer asked for the following:\r\n\r\n{quote}Stash does not currently have any support for JMX counters. The REST API only exposes very basic statistics and isn't adequate for our monitoring needs. We'd like to request that Stash be instrumented with JMX counters for the following:\r\n\r\n* Total number of projects\r\n* Total number of repositories\r\n* Git pushes and pulls\r\n* Source code size on disk (ideally broken down on the per-project or per-repo basis)\r\n* Event queue size\r\n* Any other relevant metrics that can possibly be included\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nThank you in advance.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n*Douglas Fabretti*\r\n*Atlassian Support*\r\n",
