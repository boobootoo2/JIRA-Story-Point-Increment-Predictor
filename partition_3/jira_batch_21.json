The width of the tabs is a constant (in this version of SourceTree), about 2x as wide as they need to be for my repo names. This causes the tabs to exceed the width of the window, so I need to scroll left/right in order to see all of my tabs, even on a maximized window.\u00a0 If the tabs were only slightly wider than the text they contain, all tabs would fit in the window with no scrolling.\u00a0 The attached screen shot shows the text width as a black bar, and the wasted space as red bars.\r\n\r\nI would think this would be a fairly trivial change, but a descent productivity booster!\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nCarl",

The problem is that even several tags are being deleted, they get back whenever someone is doing a push through SourceTree. We found out that there is an option (\"Push all tags to remote\") that is set to true by default. This is creating a lot of issues in the repo, and it seems that even if it's set to false, after an update of SourceTree, this option is set to true again. This makes it really hard to even know who has this option enabled (as tags do not track who pushed them). Please make this option set to false by default (and keep users selection after a SourceTree update as well).\r\n\r\nThank you.",
