Summary\nEnterprise customers or those with very large spaces are unable to move large page trees successfully. \n\nThis is using the built-in \"move\" function. This doesn't involve the copy page tree plugin at all. \n\nThe customer who experienced this is on 5.8.18. I also tested on 5.9.14 and was able to reproduce the issue in my lab.\n\nh4. Environment\n* Confluence 5.8.18 through 5.9.14\n* I have attached an xml-backup from my 5.9.14 test instance\n\nh4. Steps to Reproduce\n# Create fresh instance\n# Create test space\n# Populate test space with ~60,000 pages\n# Attempt to move entire page tree somewhere \n#* Click the ... > Move > select new parent page > Move\n# Move fails after 3 minutes exactly\n\nh4. Expected Results\nPage tree is moved successfully\n\nh4. Actual Results\nPage tree move fails with error \n{code:borderStyle=solid}\nThe following error(s) occurred:\n* Move failed.

If you use the \"tags\" expansion, the script is not downloaded when adding this content to the DOM (unlike CSS). However, if I create script tags manually, then the scripts are downloading and executed in the order that they finish downloading (which causes javascript errors). It would be great to see documentation for a recommended approach to render content from the content API on the client-side.",

Problem Definition\nCustomer reported that, in Confluence pages, links are distinguished by color only. \n\nConfluence Cloud version does not allow CSS Customization. You are able to change links color (look and feel configuration settings), however, it changes All links within Confluence application, this is only regarding the ones on pages text. \n\nThere is also a best practice, for accessibility, from w3 on how to display links described here: [https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/F73.html]\n\nh3. Suggested Solution\nIt would be better if we add something like underlining or shading, into the style that links are displayed, even better if we make an option to change default link styles (for pages only)\n\nh3. Workaround \nThe only suitable workaround for this would be to manually format links in a way that differs it from the text.\n\n",

Problem Definition\n\nIt is not always clear to users how to edit a file in the Office Connector interface when previewing a file from a Confluence page. In order to edit the file, you must click on {{...}}\u00a0at the top right corner of the page, and then select *Edit in office*. An example of the user experience for editing from the previewer is shown in the screenshot below:\u00a0\n\n!edit_options.png|thumbnail!\n\nAs you can see, the user must first click {{...}} and then the option for \"Edit in office\" appears.\u00a0\n\nIn contrast, when viewing the file from the attachments list, there are buttons that clearly direct the user to edit the file. The options should be similar.\u00a0\nh3. Suggested Solution\n\nAdd an \u201cEdit file\u201d icon directly visible in the file previewer, instead of having it under the {{...}}\u00a0option. This will make it more clear to users that they can edit the file in Confluence.",

The hover color on the Application links, accessed by clicking the 3 bars in the upper left corner, appears to be the same color. So if you hover over 'Configure' it apears as one blue rectangle. (As shown in the attached picture)\n\nThere should be some kind of color switch to maintain the readabillity of the selected link.\n For example you could switch the text (forground) color to white on hover.\n\n\u00a0\n\nKind Regrads,\n\nKevin",

Summary\nLet's say our hierarchy of pages in a page are as such:\n * Parent A (contains ImageA.png and ImageB.png)\n ** Child A (displays ImageA.png that was attached in Parent A)\n ** Child B (displays ImageB.png that was attached in Parent A)\n\nOn pages Child A and Child B, the only way to know that ImageA.png and ImageB.png originated from Parent A is to edit the page and hover over the image. At that point, you'd be able to view which space and page the image came from. A sample is shown below:\n\n !Attachment hover.png|thumbnail! \n\nh4. Suggestion\nThe method mentioned above is very troublesome and difficult for users to identify which page actually has the attachment attached to it. Perhaps Confluence can do one of the following:\n * Automatically link the attachment so clicking on it will immediately redirect users to the original page where the attachment was attached to.\n * Provide a macro which can list out the links to pages whose attachments are displayed on the current page.\n\nAny other implementation method that will allow an easier way of knowing which page provides the attachment would be great.\n\nh4. Workaround\nThis will achieve suggestion #1 above, but has to be manually done.\n # Edit an existing page or create a new page.\n # Insert an attachment from another page into the page from step #1 above.\n # Click on the newly added attachment on the page editor.\n # Click on \"Link\".\n # Search for the page where the attachment came from.\n # Select the page.\n # Click on \"Insert\".\n # Save the page.\n # Click on the attachment to test the URL/page redirection.",

The Note macro uses a symbol that is universally seen as a Caution. Would it be possible to change the name of the macro to Caution instead of Note?\n\nMany tech writers use four main type of notes in their documentation. For an example. please see [Warning and Caution Notes by Sonus|https://support.sonus.net/display/DSCDOC151/About+the+DSC+Platforms+Documentation+Library#AbouttheDSCPlatformsDocumentationLibrary-WarningandCautionNotes]. The change of the name would help improve the use of your marcos and the documentation of the companies that use your product.\n\nThank you,\n\n- Liz",

We should clarify that after upgrading one node, the other nodes are not upgraded but rather _replicated_ from the single upgraded node. Users should not attempt to upgrade the other nodes like they did for the first node, since all nodes share the same DB, which would have already been upgraded.\n\nFor sub-step 5.2 I would also recommend to add \"local\" to the home directory in the first sentence, i.e.:\n{quote}\nCopy the installation directory and local home directory from the first node to the next node.\n{quote}",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFSERVER-43795].\n  {panel}\n\nh3. Problem Definition\nWhile using Share button it's not possible to search for users which are in Confluence user directory (internal or external) if they are not assigned to the group with \"can use permissions\" or do not have \"can use\" permissions assigned individually.\n\nSuch approach is helping to improve user search performance *but* the user can lack this functionality when it's required to share the page in the space with Anonimous access.\n\nh4. Business case\nExample business case configuration:\n* Confluence and JIRA Service Desk. \n* JIRA is used for user management in Confluence\n* JIRA SD customers are synchronized but their group doesn't have \"can use\" permission (in order to reduce user count)\n* JIRA SD is set up for [Serving customers with a knowledge base|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/SERVICEDESKSERVER031/Serving+customers+with+a+knowledge+base]\n\nThe following case has happen:\n# Big number of customers from the same department created support ticket related to the same issue.\n# The support agent decided to write a new KB and share with the customers from that department.\n\n*Expected behavior*\nThe support engineer can use the embed search in Share dialog to identify the group or user who is in the directory but without \"can use\" permissions.\n*Actual behavior*\nThe support engineer is getting an empty search result for groups and users without \"can use\" permissions.\n\nh3. Suggested Solution\nTwo possible solutions available:\n# Include all users and groups from the directory to Share button search (irrelative to \"can use\" permission)\n# Make an option to manually include selected groups without \"can use\" permission from the directory \n \nh3. Workaround \nCurrently no workaround available, just to give the users can use permission.",
