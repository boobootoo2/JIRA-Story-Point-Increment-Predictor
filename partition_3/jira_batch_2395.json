Issue Summary\r\n\r\nIf a user specifies the exact name of a branch, a tag, or a bookmark in their yml file, the pipeline defined for the specific branch should override any more generic expressions that would match that branch.\r\n\r\nThis is not the case when the more generic expression is included in curly brackets.\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Create a Bitbucket Cloud repo\r\n # Create and commit in the repo a bitbucket-pipelines.yml like the following\r\n{code:java}\r\n image: atlassian/default-image:2\r\n\r\n pipelines:\r\n   branches:\r\n     feature/specific-feature:\r\n       - step:\r\n           script:\r\n             - echo \"specific feature pipeline\"\r\n     '{feature/*,testing/*}':\r\n       - step:\r\n           script:\r\n             - echo \"pipeline for all other feature and testing branches\"\r\n {code}\r\n\r\n # Create from Bitbucket UI a branch named *feature/specific-feature*\r\n\r\nh3.

When a developer creates or updates a PR, the trigger builds that PR feature branch and reports the build status in the Bitbucket PR page.\r\n\r\n!image-2021-01-06-16-14-05-532.png|width=509,height=285!\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nWe'd like to see the Bitbucket capability expanded to allow the merge commit to be built. Or the future merge commit, if you will; the combination of code from the feature branch + the code of the target branch. This will help us better validate that the feature branch doesn't contain any breaking changes with the trunk or target branch, prodiving confidence that the PR is ready to be merged.\r\n\r\nFrom Microsoft's documentation on this feature:\r\n\"Each new run builds the latest commit from the source branch of the pull request. This is different from how Azure Pipelines builds pull requests in other repositories (e.g., Azure Repos or GitHub), where it builds the merge commit. *Unfortunately, Bitbucket does not expose information about the merge commit, which contains the merged code between the source and target branches of the pull request.*\"\r\n\r\n[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/repos/bitbucket?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml#pr-triggers]\u00a0",

Our API test provides connectivity to multiple payment gateways via a single API. Most of what we do is call external 3rd party APIs. One of our build steps is to run some 30 API test suites that call out to 30 or so external APIs. The tests make sure we have not broken contracts with those APIs. Unfortunately, there are times here external API are down for maintenance or have bugs of their own. In those situations, we have to manually review the failure. We have no way to mark the test result as acceptable, we are forced to commit code removing that test to move forward.\u00a0\r\n\r\n*Suggestion*\r\n\r\nAdd a button next to a failing build step \"mark as passed\". For us, that is all we need, but I could see people wanting some type of user role required, or for it to only be available for certain steps etc..\r\n\r\nnote\r\n\r\nlooked for this in your backlog and didn't see it I think bamboo had a quarantine feature that was much more advanced but provided the same functionality\r\n\r\n\u00a0",
