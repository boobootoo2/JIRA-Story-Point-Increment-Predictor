Small suggestion though (that would make a big difference): When you mention someone in an inline comment, the e-mail that goes through doesn't show the text you've highlighted to comment on. Although it's great that the page link takes you directly to the comment, it'd be yet another bonus to have the highlighted text excerpted in the e-mail. \n\nThanks!",

Problem Definition\nCurrently, Confluence allows for only one 'User Name Attribute' to be configured for each LDAP\n directory. For example, this is configured to be the *sAMAccountName* by default.  This functionality already exists in other products and allows users some flexibility as to which username they can log in with. \n\nh3. Suggested Solution\nAllow for at least one alternate 'User Name Attribute' (commonly *userPrincipalName* on newer versions of Windows) to be configured for each directory. \n\nh3. Workaround \nNo workaround found.\n\nh3. Notes\nThe following bug might be relevant: [CONF-37275|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONF-37275]. When a 'User Name Attribute' is configured and users already exist in Confluence - if you then change this field to use a different attribute and sync the directory, Confluence will create new users instead of updating the current users.",

Steps to Reproduce\n# Create a page.\n# Insert a Page Properties macro.\n# Save it.\n# Edit the created Page Properties macro.\n\nh3. Actual Results\n# if you have 1000+ pages with Page Properties macro inserted in, you'll need to access each 1000+ page and edit it.\n\nh3.

Problem Definition\nAs an administrator, I would like better logging when an UnknownHostException is thrown in Confluence. Currently the following error is thrown in the Confluence logs and a white screen with no information is displayed in the UI:\n\n{code}ERROR [http-nio-8080-exec-4] [net.sf.ehcache.Cache] <clinit> Unable to set localhost. This prevents creation of a GUID. Cause was: HOST: HOST: unknown error\n -- referer: http://HOST:port/setup/evallicense.action | url: /setup/setupembeddeddb-default.action | userName: anonymous | action: setupembeddeddb-default\njava.net.UnknownHostException: HOST: HOST: unknown error\n\tat java.net.InetAddress.getLocalHost(InetAddress.java:1505){code}\n\nh3. Suggested Solution\nNo web application should ever throw a blank screen on error. A message at that point something like E.G. = \"Cannot validate license against hostname via DNS\" would be to the point. Also, that message could be explicit in the logs, rather than \"an unknown error.\"\n\nBonus: you could consider doing the validation against a call to \"hostname\" rather than handling it as a DNS lookup as shown in [java.net.UnknownHostException exceptions in Confluence log file due to DNS lookups failing|https://confluence.atlassian.com/confkb/java-net-unknownhostexception-exceptions-in-confluence-log-file-due-to-dns-lookups-failing-394465548.html]. \n\nh3.

I noticed that the problem started when I log by IE browser. From the moment all users besides some part disapear from the list and only restart of the machine helps, but information about permissions also after restart disappear and I need to grant access for all users again.\nIn Jira there is no such problem.\n\nKind regards\nArtur Poniedzia\u0142ek",

When a PDF export runs longer than that, the task keeps running on the background but the .pdf generated is not returned to the customer. If another PDF export is triggered, Confluence tries to generate a new PDF, even though it already has one from the last export and again, it wont be downloadable.\n\nThere is also a 30 second retry done automatically by the smart-status timeout page from the client browser that will trigger new PDF exports. Confluence will deny a new PDF export to run with the message:\n{noformat}\njava.lang.IllegalStateException: Too many concurrent exports. 1 is max allowed.\n{noformat}\nbut as soon as the export finishes it will start a new PDF export.\n\nPDF exports that take longer than 1 minute are high CPU tasks. This loop of generating new pdf files can render Cloud sites unusable on certain situations.\n\nh3. Environment\n* Confluence Cloud\n\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\n# Create a Confluence Cloud page with 100 external images from another Cloud site (this will fail to retrieve images for the pdf at the rate of 1 image each second.\n# Export page to PDF\n\nh3. Expected Results\npdf file is downloadable at the end of the process. If it is not, then a new PDF export downloads the previous generated file if the page wasn't modified.\n\nh3. Actual Results\nConfluence generates a pdf indefinitely until the browser is stopped.\nNew PDF exports are rejected but as soon as it completes, it starts a new one when it is automatically requested by the smart-status 30 second refresh.\n\n{{confluence/home/temp}} directory contains multiple .pdf files of the same page\n\nh3. Suggestion\nConfluence could detect that there is a pdf export already in the temp directory for the same unmodified page and transfer that to the browser or provide the option for the customer to decide; in case there is dynamic content on the page and a new pdf export is explicitly requested.\n\nh3.Workaround\n- Use the Space Tools PDF Export Option: as a Space Admin, Space Tools > Content Tools > Export\n",

Summary\n\n- When exporting space(s) the \"promoted\" blueprints settings are lost, and have to mannualy promote them again in the imported space.\n\nh4. Steps to Reproduce\n\n- Promote a blueprint (bundled) in a space.\n- Export the space as XML\n- Import this space\n\nh4. Expected Results\n\n- The promoted blueprint setting remains.\n\nh4. Actual Results\n\n- Missing the promoted blueprint setting.\n\nh4. Workaround\n\n- Promote it again mannually in the imported space.\n- Below you can do it through REST API.\n# We strongly advise to definitely test these on a test/staging instance before applying them to actual prod one.\n# The user credential to be used *must* have admin permission on that space.\n# Providing username/password as plain text as the instruction is not recommended.

Please see that ticket instead.\n\nIn some cases, it is legitimate for the message \"Unknown attachment\" to appear. For example:\n\n* If you upload an attachment to a page and then delete it from the attachments list without removing the macro which references it, the macro will show \"Unknown attachment\".\n* If you upload an attachment on Page-A and then reference it in a macro on Page-B, then delete the original Page-A, then the attachment will also be deleted. This causes the Page-B macro to display \"Unknown attachment\"\n\nIf you observed \"unknown attachment\" after one of these scenarios, this is not a bug, but rather expected behaviour.\n\nIf you observed \"unknown attachment\" by any other scenario, it is likely a bug. If you find a way to reproduce this issue, please let us know by commenting below, with details of how to reproduce the issue and your version of confluence. If you observe something different than an \"unknown attachment\" message but attachments do fail to download, please let us know exactly what you see.

In most of the cases, responisiblity changes or persons come and go. In other cases, pages are created by our support, due to complex imports or similar actions.  \n\nThe impact of page ownership is massive, as you know. We struggle with the archiving plugin for ex, which tends to produce spam to all contributors, if it is not the author who is to be notified.  \n\nBy now, the only supported workaround is recreating the page and moving all subpages, which is complicated and has many  drawbacks (linking for ex). \n\nIt would be very helpful if changing the owner of a page could be a simple task for confluence-administrators, space-admins and the current owners of the pages. \n\nI thank you in advance for your consideration.\n\nBest wishes\n\nMatin\n",

How these two settings operate\nHazelcast is Confluence's distributed caching mechanism. Data will be stored in the cache on one node only, and when other nodes want that data, they contact the node that has it. If no node has it, they query the database. Hazelcast controls the cluster membership. If a node has not communicated with the other nodes in the cluster for the heartbeat period (30s by default), the other nodes will remove it from the cluster. It will then not be able to contact the shared cache until it has successfully rejoined the cluster.\n\n[Cluster safety|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/CONFKB/Recovering+from+a+Data+Center+cluster+split-brain] is a scheduled job that runs on each node in a cluster, every 30s by default. It compares a number in Hazelcast's cache to a number in the database. If the numbers differ, the node will throw a panic event and stop processing. It is intended to ensure that all nodes that are able to communicate with the database, are also communicating with Hazelcast's shared cache, to avoid writing out of date data to the database, and overwriting more recent edits.\n\nh3. Some example configurations\nh5. Uptime over data integrity\n* Change both to 1 minute - this would mean you could have network interruptions or GC pauses up to 1 minute without triggering cluster panics. However, in the rare case that two nodes are no longer communicating, there would be a maximum of a 1 minute interval where the data on each node may be out of sync, and this could cause conflicting data to be written to the database.\n* Leaving the hazelcast timeout at 30 seconds and cluster safety to 10 minutes would allow nodes to be evicted from and rejoin the cluster (eg after a 30s GC or network blip), without a cluster panic occurring. This would mean that the cluster could potentially operate in a 'split brain' scenario where the nodes do not rejoin, for up to 10 minutes before throwing a panic. However, it would give evicted nodes a lot more time to rejoin the cluster gracefully after eviction.\n\nh5. Data integrity over uptime\n* Change both to 15 seconds - this sacrifices uptime for more confidence around data integrity. It means a maximum of 15 seconds where nodes could be out of communication with each other and still writing to the database. It could mean that GCs and network blips over 15 seconds will trigger a cluster panic, so you would run the risk of having more outages.\n* Change the hazelcast timeout to 1 minute and the cluster safety job to 15 seconds - this would mean GCs etc could run for up to 1 minute without nodes being evicted from the cluster. However, once they are evicted, the time they could potentially write to the database is lowered to 15 seconds.",

Summary\nWhen a page has one macro within another macro, let's say a Warning macro within an Info macro, and at least 2 users are editing this page at the same time, and both users save the page, the macro within breaks after the second user saves the page, see screenshot.\n\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\n# Create a page\n# Add an Info macro and within the Info macro add a Warning macro\n# Save the page\n# With one user, edit the page\n# Access this page with another user and also edit the page\n# While both users are editing the page at the same time the first user saves the page, and the second user also saves the page right after\n\nh3. Expected Results\nAfter the second user saves the page, the macro within the other macro, on this case the Warning macro, should still be viewable\nh3. Actual Results\nThe macro within the other macro breaks. A message saying \"Broken macro\" is displayed\n \nh3. Notes\nThere's no need for both users to save the page at the exact same time (instantaneously).\n\nh3.Workaround\nAs a workaround, when a User edits the problem page, the user can add an edit restriction for the page and restrict editing to themselves. This restoration will need to be removed after editing the page. This is a rather tedious workaround, but it will prevent the issue until the problem is resolved.\n\n*NB: In the unlikely event that anyone experiences this issue post 5.10.4, it is because the macros were entered on the page some time ago, before macro ids were used. If this does occur, the workaround is to revert to the old version, then save the page (ensuring no one else is editing it at the same time). Once a single-session save has occurred, the macro will have an id, and the problem will be solved for that page forever.*",
