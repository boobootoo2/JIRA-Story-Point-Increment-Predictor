Summary of Bug\n\nShowing results of JIRA Macro as a table (when the result is only 1 issue) is not possible, even though the macro version is 5.1. This should be possible, as stated in the release statement of this version :\n\nbq. Added the ability to insert issue table when there is none or one issue returned from search query.\n\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\n\n# After linking Confluence with JIRA, try using JIRA Issues Macro\n# Search for something that would only return one result\n# Try showing the results as a table\n\nh3. Additional Findings\n\nThis is only able to be reproduced sometimes. It depends on the query used to find the issues :\n\n* If I search with key = <issuekey>, then the result is not able to be shown as a table\n* If I search with issue = <issuekey>, then the results would still be able to be shown as a table\n* If I search with just the issuekey, then the results is not able to be shown as a table",

In this case, I install Confluence under following folder hierarchy:\n\n{code}/home/confluence\n  |_  current/   = INST_DIR\n  |_  .home/     = HOME_DIR\n  |_  backups/   = Location where old backups are held, everytime I upgrade{code}\n\nIt all works good. When using MySQL as the production RDBMS, I first install {{libmysql-java}} library which fetches JDBC drivers:\n\n{code}sudo apt-get install libmysql-java{code}\n\nThe latest driver is generally linked through {{/usr/share/java/mysql.jar}} file. In all my Atlassian product installations, I just link to that file. For example, in the case of Confluence, I link to that location from {{INST_DIR/confluence/WEB-INF/lib/mysql.jar}}. Generally it works with other Atlassian software, but for some reasons Confluence doesn't like this method.

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFSERVER-31865].\n  {panel}\n\nI've been actively using Confluence for the last 5 years, with peripheral exposure to Confluence admin for the last 2 years.  In that time, I've developed a love/hate relationship with blog posts.\n\nThe love comes from the usefulness of this feature, i.e. managing date-oriented content separately from the page hierarchy.  In addition to the usual blogging uses (i.e. individuals spouting their personal opinions on a variety of topics), blog posts are wonderfully useful to document any date-centric event, such as product release notes or meeting notes...and this is particularly true when coupled with an intelligent labelling strategy and the Blog Posts macro on a related page.  Meeting Notes are especially handy to implement with blog posts, because doing them with pages would mean indefinitely adding items to an ever-growing page hierarchy (especially for daily or weekly meetings).\n\nSadly, the hate comes from how Atlassian continues to lag blog post capabilities behind page capabilities.  Looking at CONF-234, I can see that blog posts have existed in Confluence since Release 1.0.  However, every additional capability has been implemented later than the equivalent capability on pages (in some cases, much, much later!):\n\n* CONF-1307: Add comments (fixed in Release 1.1)\n* CONF-1712: Remote API support (fixed in Release 1.1)\n* CONF-2025: Blog Attachments (fixed in Release 1.4)\n* CONF-3768: Labels for blog posts (fixed in Release 2.0)\n* CONF-1989: Blog version history (fixed in Release 2.1.5)\n* CONF-6599: Display blog labels (fixed in Release 2.2.7)\n* CONF-1576: Rename blog post (fixed in Release 2.6)\n* CONF-12915: Change comment when editing blog post (fixed in Release 3.3)\n* CONF-5307: Include macro supports blog posts (fixed in Release 3.5)\n* CONF-5599: PDF Export support (fixed in Release 5.0)\n* CONF-2455: Move blog post to another space (to be fixed in Release 5.5)\n\nToday, blog posts still:\n\n* can't have permissions set independently of the space permissions (unlike pages)\n* can't be created using templates (or the newer Blueprints)\n* in the most recent releases of Confluence, the date-based navigation features appear to have been *removed*\n** I used to be able to click through the blog a month at a time, with handy title-based links...now, I have to select _Browse_ \\-> _Blog_ in the header bar and scroll through months of blog posts at once (without any navigation links), or click the month in the header of an existing blog post to see that month's blog posts, with no way to move from month to month other than modifying the URL directly!\n\nSo, this \"improvement\" request is my plea for Atlassian to stop hating on blog posts.  Blog posts have just as much utility as Pages, but they're continuously treated as second-class citizens of the Confluence feature set.  Please, please, please bring some equality to Confluence!",

Special highlighting for that might be appropriate.\n- [ABC.DEF.GHI] is another .NET specific notation\n- [ABC.DEF.GHI]::Function() is calling a .NET function (or property, if called without the \"()\"). Highlighting those function or property-stubs separately would be great\n- Functions and their parameters appear to be colored in the same color (\"Select-Object -First\"). I'd much appreciate if those could be varied, so that functions and parameters have similar colors (Example: Functions get a dark blue and parameters a light blue). Powershell code frequently consists of long chains of Function Pipelines with little but functions and their parameters.\n- There is a way in powershell to create a string object across multiple lines: They start with '@\"' and end with '\"@' (without the single hyphens, but with the double ones). This is not supported in the PowerShell highlighter so far.\n\nAll those would be nice-to-have, though hardly worldshaking, features :)",

I hope breaking it down as I have below reads clearly and makes sense.\n\nIn Documentation Theme:\n\nA. With sidebar shown:\n\n1. Selection of recipients dismisses 'Share pages' dialog\n\nSelecting a recipient in the 'Share pages' dialog has the effect of visually dismissing the pop-up dialog. The dialog's state is still 'invoked'; the Share icon looks the same as when the dialog is active and visible. As clicking on the Share pages icon has no effect at this point, to perform the Share or to add more recipients, you have to click somewhere off of the Share pages icon to change its state back to 'uninvoked'.  Then you can again click on the Share pages icon for the dialog to reappear so that you can click the 'Share' button, or add more recipients by looping through the above first.\n\n2. Removal of recipients also toggles content left<>back\n\nClicking the trash icon next to a Share pages recipient shifts content left, cropping off the left portion of the content at the sidebar. Compensating white space appears at the right of the content area. The dialog remains stationary over the added white space while the recipient is effectively removed. At this point, removing another recipient, clicking the Cancel button in the Share pages dialog, or clicking outside the dialog restores the shifted content and white space back to normal layout. \n\n\nB. With sidebar hidden:\n\n1. 'Share pages' dialog uncomfortably flush right.\n\nSee attached share_content_flush for appearance of Share pages dialog when sidebar is hidden in Documentation Theme. The dialog functions properly when the sidebar is hidden; i.e., the problems present when the sidebar is shown, as described above, are no longer present.",

This is a great feature, but this task list requires you to edit the page to add a task. The Dynamic Task List 2 is great as I can dynamically add tasks (per its name). But, any task that is assigned to me does not show up in my Personal Task List. Is there a way to make this happen?\n\nAlso, it doesn't seem like I can easily do a User Reference using the @ sign like in the rest of confluence, is this something that should work.\n\nThis was requested that I add this to support from my Atlassian Answers: https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/136639/dynamic-task-lists-don-t-appear-in-my-personal-task-list",
