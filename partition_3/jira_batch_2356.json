Either have this functionality built in to the repository search bar or have some sort of REST API that does this job. In addition, it would be useful to have a line in the description file of each repository stating the name of the repository. Right now it seems the easiest way to find the repository name from an ID is to query the database with something like this: \r\n\r\n{{SELECT <DB_NAME>.repository.name FROM <DB_NAME>.repository WHERE <DB_NAME>.repository.id = \"<REPO_ID>\";}}\r\n\r\nThe only other way is to search the {{application.xml}} file or each individual repository's settings page for it's location.

However, currently a pull requests visibility is only in the repository where it is created. \r\n\r\nIn our current project, we have multiple repositories and there are times when some of the repositories move together. The number of repos that move together is dependent upon the feature being worked upon and it sometimes is an overhead keeping track of pull request across projects that need to be approved at the same time.\r\n\r\nAn example is that we have a JAVA API , a monitoring codebase and database modules. For a feature that requires changes in all the codebase , we want a mechanism of saying that the pull requests across the 3 repositories can only be merged only when all the 3 pull requests are in merge-ready state(review done, all build and tests pass, no merge conflicts etc)",

I have automatic fork synchronization disabled.\r\n\r\nAccording to the documentation (https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/STASH/Keeping+forks+synchronized), there should be a manual synchronize button in three places:\r\n\r\n1. The Source tab\r\n2. The Commits tab\r\n3. Under Settings -> Fork syncing\r\n\r\nI'm not seeing it in any of those places.\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\n*Actual behaviour:*\r\n{quote}\r\nThe \"Manual Syncing\" option only comes up when the automatic fork syncing is enabled _and_ if upstream and your fork have diverged, so that each has changes that are not in the other.\r\n\r\nThat being said, the manual syncing will only come up in case the automatic syncing encounters that situation. \r\n\r\nTo reproduce, say:\r\n- The auto-syncing is turned off\r\n- You change locally a certain line of a file in the master branch of your upstream and push this change to Stash\r\n- You change locally the same line of the same file on the master branch of the fork and push the change to Stash\r\n- You turn on the auto syncing and the manual option will come up\r\n\r\nAs described on the documentation, Stash makes any fast-forward change where there is no need to merge work and there is no risk of losing changes. The manual syncing comes into picture to add this extra security layer.\r\n{quote}",

The commands suggested in this window are trying to merge sourcebranch to targetbranch and push the merged code (destination branch) directly to destination repo directly. We have enabled another plugin 'PullRequest must Please' plugin to allow everyone to use PR for code pushes.\r\n\r\nLet me know if something wrong here or the suggested workaround to fix it on my stash instance.\r\n\r\nAppreciate for your quick hep on this.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nSrinivas",

A project was previously setup for \"squash\" merge strategy for pull requests (owned by same team that reported the problem the previous week and a half).  We brought Stash down and deleted one line for the \"squash\" merge strategy for the one project (they wanted the default of \"no-ff\").  After restarting, we started our sanity testing in a test project (not the same as the project that we removed the \"squash\" merge strategy for).  We started getting the error above every time on a pull request merge that had a merge commit created and whenever that merge commit is accessed.  This is happening every time now!\r\n\r\nThis appears like it could be related to STASH-6972...
