It would be nice to be able to\u00a0read the items in the stash more quickly.\r\n\r\nProposal one: add a grid system to the stash menu - currently the stash menu seems to store each item as plain text. It would be really nice for me if it was split so that one column had the item number, another had the branch it was created on, and another had the name of the stash.\r\n\r\nProposal two: select multiple stash items at once. Currently you can only select one stash item even when shift/ctrl clicking on another. It would be really cool to select multiple ones and delete them all at once. (I like to let my stash get big and then spring clean it!)\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nXavier\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe image below shows the lack of readability in a large stash:\r\n\r\n!image-2017-11-06-17-30-23-792.png!",
