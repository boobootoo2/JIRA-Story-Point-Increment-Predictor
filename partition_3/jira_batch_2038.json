Summary\r\n\r\nIn the Confluence Editor, If you color-format a line of text and then copy-paste that line of text, the color formatting \"<span>\" will not close until just before the close of the last paragraph. This causes the \"<span>\" tags to stack up and eventually renders the editor useless. Once published, the page displays no immediate symptoms, but when trying to edit, the editor will be impossibly slow and can be impacted such that the draft never loads.\r\n\r\nh3. Environment\r\n(Optional - If Applicable)\r\nCloud.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Create a new page with a line of text and apply a color to the whole line of text and publish.\r\n# Edit the page again and copy the whole line of colored text.\r\n# Paste the line in new lines (as new paragraphs is confirmed to cause the problem, so just use Return and not Shift-Return) repeatedly.\r\n# Eventually, the page will publish on it's own out of nowhere, or you can publish the page after you have 10 - 20 lines pasted.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nThe Storage format contains lines with discreet color formatting, or a single color formatting span is intelligently placed.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nWhen viewing the storage format, you will see all the text is lost in a sea of color formatting span tags, and just before the last ending \"</p>\" tag you will see something like this:\r\n{noformat}\r\n</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>\r\n{noformat}\r\n \r\nh3. Notes\r\nChanging the color formatting of the affected text does not remove the bad spans.\r\n\r\nh3.Workaround\r\nThe only known workaround at this time is to copy and paste the text into an editor that does not support the color, (such as notepad) and then to copy paste out of that editor, back into confluence to remove the color formatting.",
