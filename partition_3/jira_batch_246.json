While this suggestion has gathered significant interest, we're unable to implement all of the excellent suggestions you make. We don't plan to work on this for the foreseeable future. This suggestion will be reviewed in about 12 months time, at which point we\u2019ll consider whether we need to change its status.\r\n\r\nWe hope that you appreciate our candid and transparent communication. You can learn more about our approach to highly voted server suggestions here.\r\n\r\nTo learn more about our recent investments in Jira Server and Data Center, please check our two new dashboards containing [Recently resolved issues|https://jira.atlassian.com/secure/Dashboard.jspa?selectPageId=85597] and [Current work and future plans|https://jira.atlassian.com/secure/Dashboard.jspa?selectPageId=85890].\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\n Jira Server Product Management\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\nWhen using plan mode, I don't see auto-refresh occurring when ranking issues or status changes. \r\n To reproduce:\r\n # Set up JIRA and GH\r\n # Prepare a Project, some test Issues, and a Scrum board\r\n # Verify drag-and drop ranking works\r\n # Clone or duplicate the tab so you have two views of the same board\r\n # Change rank or status of an issue\r\n # Switch to the other window\r\n # No auto-refresh occurs\r\n\r\nTo help remote teams plan, auto refresh would be great addition to the product.",

This confuses people who are trying to learn how it works. Both used the simplified GH workflow.\r\n\r\nh4. More Information\r\nApart from this, the use of Set Resolution should be revised:\r\n# Why do we need Set Resolution in To Do and In Progress?\r\n!setRes.png|thumbnail!\r\n# What's point of Set Resolution? I created a new column (Complete) and tick the option Set Resolution. It's correct that when I move SSP-14 to this column, its resolution is set to Done. So I assume that now I have 4 Done issues (together with the 3 original issues in Done column without a resolution). But when I click on Complete Sprint, I can still see 3 Done vs. 3 Incomplete, which means that SSP-14 is not considered as Done:\r\n!complete.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nSince this kind of settings is not available in other workflows, I wonder why we need this in Agile Simplified Workflow. If only issues in the rightmost column are considered Done, I wonder why Set Resolution is available in all columns.\r\n\r\n(!) Verified in JIRA 6.2.1 with JIRA Agile 6.3.11",

I think previous versions (with JIRA 4.3 if my memory serves me well) was more intuitive. Why Kanban doesn't have a burndown chart? Why can't I create new cards in Kanban board as freely as in classic one? SCRUM board may be good for SCRUM teams, but for others it's enforcing alien methodology. But only SCRUM board has burndown chart... I can't understand reasoning behind such decision.\r\n\r\nI use greenhopper for \"casual projects\" - projects with very limited spare resources. For \"casual project\" to stay alive the only thing is needed - steady progress. Classic boards allow me to plan ahead release of next version and tie it to exact date i.e. next meeting. There are always much more features out there than I can implement with what resources I have now. Burndown chart in classic boards of greenhopper helps me release new version within deadline with all features possible. As long as I'm comfortible with required burndown rate, I can freely plan new features.\r\nAttached is my typical burndown chart for \"casual project\".\r\n\r\nSo long story short, I want to have classic burndown chart in Kanban board.\r\n\"+ New card\" button in kanban board would be nice bonus too.",

Workaround\r\n# Backup the instance to XML.\r\n# Install the XML into a test instance.\r\n# Add any missing Issue Types, such as the Epic, Story & Technical Task (this is actually a sub-task) through the browser GUI.\r\n# Execute the following SQL to identify their IDs in the database:\r\n{code:SQL}\r\nselect id, pname from issuetype where pname in ('Technical Task','Epic','Story');\r\n{code}\r\n(i) Keep track of these as we'll need them later.\r\n# Add a Story Points Custom Field (Number Field), ensuring to set the context to Epic and Story.\r\n# Add it to the appropriate screens (e.g.: default, however this depends upon JIRA's configuration).\r\n# Use the below SQL to identify the ID:\r\n{code:SQL}\r\nselect id from customfield where cfname = 'Story Points';\r\n{code}\r\n# Execute the following SQL to get your GreenHopper property map:\r\n{code:SQL}\r\nselect propertyvalue from propertytext where id = (select id from propertyentry where property_key ='SCRUM_DEFAULT_TEMPLATE_CONFIGURATION');\r\n{code}\r\n# Replace the map with the appropriate Story Points Custom Field and Epic, Story & Technical Task Issue Type. For example:\r\n{code:XML}\r\n<map>\r\n  <entry>\r\n    <string>gh.issue.storypoints</string>\r\n    <string>customfield_18008</string> <!-- Changed -->\r\n  </entry>\r\n  <entry>\r\n    <string>gh.issue.story</string>\r\n    <string>36</string> <!-- Changed -->\r\n  </entry>\r\n  <entry>\r\n    <string>gh.issue.rankingfield</string>\r\n    <string>customfield_10983</string>\r\n  </entry>\r\n  <entry>\r\n    <string>gh.issue.labelfield</string>\r\n    <string>customfield_10982</string>\r\n  </entry>\r\n  <entry>\r\n    <string>FIELDCONFIG_SCHEME_ID</string>\r\n    <long>11141</long>\r\n  </entry>\r\n  <entry>\r\n    <string>gh.issue.task</string>\r\n    <string>3</string> <!-- Changed -->\r\n  </entry>\r\n  <entry>\r\n    <string>gh.issue.epic</string>\r\n    <string>37</string> <!-- Changed -->\r\n  </entry>\r\n  <entry>\r\n    <string>gh.issue.businessvalues</string>\r\n    <string>customfield_10985</string>\r\n  </entry>\r\n  <entry>\r\n    <string>gh.issue.flaggingfield</string>\r\n    <string>customfield_10981</string>\r\n  </entry>\r\n</map>\r\n{code}\r\n(!) Make sure not to include any comments, these are just for reference.\r\n# Stop JIRA.\r\n# Update the map after making the correct changes with the following:\r\n{code:SQL}\r\nupdate propertytext set propertyvalue = <the updated XML> where id = (select id from propertyentry where property_key ='SCRUM_DEFAULT_TEMPLATE_CONFIGURATION');\r\n{code}\r\n# Start JIRA.\r\n# Install the GreenHopper plugin and reindex JIRA.\r\n# Test by creating a new board and verify all is working.",

      "description": "I have seen quite a few issues raised in the Atlassian GreenHopper project related to ranking, and I too have found several bugs and odd behaviors with the new Rapid Boards. One of which in particular was particularly relevant to my reason for creating this issue.\r\n\r\nSince issues are tracked with a single, global ranking field, odd things happen when multiple teams want to prioritize the same piece of work differently. For example, suppose an issue is created to change a piece of common functionality shared by 2 products. Further, suppose a team independent from either product is doing the actual work. The team doing the work really is the one responsible for organizing, prioritizing and tracking the issue on their backlog. However, for planning purposes it is helpful to include the same DI on each of the products backlogs as well to ensure their releases are on schedule. Similarly, the relative importance of that work will likely be different for each of the three teams with respect to the other work on their backlog. Now suppose one team decides that the priority of this issue has changed - perhaps it is more important now so they send it to the top of their backlog. Because the ranking values are global this action indirectly affects the priority of this DI on the other two teams backlogs as well. Even worse there is no notification that this change has been made. The other two teams are left to their own accord to figure out why issue priorities are magically changing on their backlogs, assuming they notice the changes at all.\r\n\r\nThis workflow is suggestive that perhaps rank should not be a property of an issue but rather a property associated with an issue *within the context of a particular backlog*. Perhaps the rank could be relative within a filter (for Kanban workflows), or perhaps relative to specific sprints (for Scrum workflows). I suspect such a change would be quite invasive as it strays from the current design pattern for your tool, but I would think that it models more closely the real-world relationship between work items and teams. A piece of work, generally speaking, does not have one universally acceptable level of importance. Its importance is relative to each person tracking the work.\r\n\r\nFrom a brief examination of some of the \"ranking\" related issues currently existing in your GreenHopper project, there are quite a few people who have tried to introduce \"contextual\" rankings thus working around this problem (with varying results, many causing more problems that they fix it seems), however these seem like a band-aid solutions attempting to circumvent this rather subtle design problem.\r\n\r\nSo, to summarize, I created this DI in part to report a bug with the GreenHopper global ranking mechanism however I suspect that this behavior is by design and a more significant implementation change within the tool would be required to address the issue robustly. This is why I created it with an issue type of Story rather than a bug.",

Testing Notes (!)\n\nQ: What if the view is stale?\nA: We will place the issue according to the currently visible issues, so if they are out of date the issue might appear at the wrong place\n\nQ: What if the viewport is huge or very very small?\nA: Same result as if the viewport is normally sized.\n\nQ: What if the detail view is closed/open?\nA: doesn't affect the logic\n\nQ: What if multiple issues are selected?\nA: We'll place the issue after the last selected issue \n\nQ: What if an epic is selected?\nA: We currently don't have epic selection\n\nQ: What if a quick/instant filter is applied?\nA: See first answer, we'll place it before the first visible issue. In case the selected issue is instant filtered, we still place it after the selected issue\n\nQ: What if your last selected issue is the last issue but it was moved/deleted?\nA: moved: it will be ranked according to the new location. deleted: bad luck, it will be ranked last\n\nQ: Can you fool GH by setting the URL without loading it and creating at the new selection?\nA: no, GH doesn't look at the url, it looks at the internal state (which might come from the url when you hit return in the address bar). Even if it did, this wouldn't be the end of the world.\n\nQ: What if you don't have schedule permission?\nA: We'll silently ignore rank errors, so the issue will end up at the end of the backlog\n\nQ: What if the selection is within an active sprint?\nA: The issue would be added at the top of the backlog\n\nAnswers provided by Michael R and Nikolay",
