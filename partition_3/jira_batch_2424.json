See, [Making a Pull Request - Tutorial|https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/making-a-pull-request], specifically the section titled: \"Gitflow Workflow With Pull Requests\".  It describes exactly, and correctly, how the workflow should work. I can not find this feature anywhere in bitbucket.\n\nIf it exists and I can not find the feature - I apologize, please point me in the right direction.\n\nOtherwise, a more succinct version of my request is:\n\n* When a branch is prefixed with either of the following prefixes it should be merged to master and then develop branch.\n\n** hotfix/\n** release/\n* Should only happen if you have the branching workflow enabled for your repository\n\nPlease feel free to reach out to me with any other questions.",

      "description": "On [October 30th 2018, BitBucket made a blog post|https://bitbucket.org/blog/update-to-outgoing-webhook-ip-addresses] saying that in addition to [the regular IP CIDR whitelist|https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/what-are-the-bitbucket-cloud-ip-addresses-i-should-use-to-configure-my-corporate-firewall-343343385.html] that some webhook requests would come from one of their [(currently) 58 public IPs|https://ip-ranges.atlassian.com/].\n\nConsequently, our webhooks began to fail last week (November 30th) as did [many other users|BCLOUD-17668] with NET_ERR or 403s. We resolved this by adding the full list of *58* public IPs, however, this seems unreasonable. If a request commonly originates from something outside the original list, is that list even meaningful?\n\nAs IPs can and will change (as they have done in the past and [is documented on their firewall page|https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/what-are-the-bitbucket-cloud-ip-addresses-i-should-use-to-configure-my-corporate-firewall-343343385.html]). We can check and maintain 3 or so, but 58 IPs? That&#x27;s painful, unless we write a script maintain firewalls.\n\nEven then it does not seem very secure to have literally dozens of end points we have to white list. Yes we have private/public keys, yes we have passwords, yes we limit ports, but we rather have a small and maintainable IP list (or at the very least one that is not a misleading list).",
