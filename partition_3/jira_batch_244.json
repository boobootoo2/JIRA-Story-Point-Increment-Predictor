Halfway through the sprint, they realize that they need help from another team and remove ABC-123 from their active sprint. The report shows correctly that ABC-123 was removed from the sprint's scope. After \"assigning\" ABC-123 to team Balloon, it disappears from their backlog but also from all of team Rocket's reports.\r\n\r\n*Expected behavior:*\r\nThe issue has to show up in team Rocket's sprint report even though it is no longer in their backlog.

One solution is to mandate that each epic has to include in its name the JIRA project ID - not ideal.\r\n\r\nAny chance of an extension to the EPIC side panel that aggregates epics into a collapsible list of projects?

I know not all teams track hours, so the vissibility of these displays might need to be configurable.\r\n\r\n1) On the Issue Details section (when an Issue is selected on the planning view of the Agile Board) show something similar to the \"Time Tracking\" section of the JIRA Issue page except broken out by sub-task assignee. This would show you at a glance who needs to work on this issue and how much work needs to be done by each person (because not all stories require the whole team).\r\n\r\n2) For each Sprint (and the area above the Sprint Marker before starting a new one) show an aggregate \"Time Tracking\" section that breaks down hour estimates/logged for each assignee.

Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Setup a JIRA instance with Agile/Software installed;\r\n # Navigate to *Administration > System > Look and Feel* and set JIRA to use ISO8601 formatting for date pickers;\r\n # Navigate to an existing or create a new Agile Scrum board;\r\n # Create a version using the sidebar under *Backlog* view or edit an existing sprint.\r\n # Observe that the date pickers will not respect the ISO8601 setting from JIRA;\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nJIRA Software should consistently use the ISO8601 setting if it has been configured in JIRA.\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nJIRA Agile does not apply this setting, as a result the date pickers behave in an inconsistent manner.\r\n (i) This is not affecting the date pickers in the *Releases* page (version 8.12.3)\r\nh3. Notes\r\n\r\nThe original report included the following information:\r\n{quote}This can be seen in two different places:\r\n Administration -> Greenhopper Configuration -> Non Working Days.\r\n Configure Board -> Non Working Days -> Add Date Button\r\n{quote}\r\nh3.

This means that only a single Epic issue type is used for all boards available by default. And due to this configurations, users are not able to create a new Epic issue type, and have different boards to use different Epic. \r\n\r\nIt will be great if GreenHopper allows users to create multiple Epic issue type, and configure the available boards to use specific Epic issue type as required. \r\n\r\nSample use case:\r\n{quote}\r\nIn our (and most likely other users) case we have a combination of hardware and software projects. The two project streams are loosely coupled. For the hardware side, the use of the word \"Epic\" would not feel really natural. Example: 2 Volts power rise within 10 nanoseconds is not an \"Epic\", it is a \"Feature\". On the other hand the software that drives the instrument can use the \"Epic\" terminology. Example: \"Device drivers support power-on sequence and self-test of high-speed power card\".\r\n\r\nTherefore I think it would be great if one could specify per configured board (Kanban or Scrum) which issue type should be considered the \"Top Level Hierarchy\".\r\n{quote}",
