Issue Summary\r\n\r\nIf you impersonate a user and then access Confluence, when you need to switch back to your account, the button to do so performs no action and does not switch the account back.\u00a0\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Impersonate a user;\u00a0\r\n # Click on the \"switch back\" button in the impersonation flag on the top right side of the page;\u00a0\r\n # Notice that it will have no effect, or sometimes it keeps appearing after the switch back to the user.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nThis button should take you back to your account.\u00a0\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nYou keep impersonating the user.\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\n*For instances with both Confluence and Jira:* \r\n* Click on the application navigator button on the top left side of the sidebar and then change the product to Jira. The pop-up to switch back will appear again and you will be able to go out of the impersonated user account.\u00a0\r\n\r\n*For instances with Confluence only:* \r\n* Log out from Confluence and then login back with your user account.\u00a0\r\n* Navigate to <siteurl>/impersonate, which will reset the impersonate function. e.g. acme.atlassian.net/impersonate",

Description\r\nIf this issue already exists, please let me know and I'll be glad to kill this one and vote on that one instead.\r\n\r\nIn the old editor, tables can be set to \"Responsive\" or \"Fixed.\"\u00a0 The latter allows for specific column sizes and it's _almost_ what is currently available in the new Fabric editor.\u00a0 I say almost because the old editor used fixed pixel dimensions for width while the new one uses percentage widths, perhaps in order to scale better on mobile devices.\u00a0 In any case, while the \"pseudo-fixed\" nature of new column widths can be frustrating for many, it is not the issue I want to focus on here.\r\n\r\nThe Responsive version of tables in the old editor allowed for completely dynamic column widths.\u00a0 The columns expanded as necessary to accommodate their contents.\u00a0 Additionally, the table itself was only as wide as necessary to fit the contents of all the cells in all the columns.\u00a0 This is not currently possible in the new Fabric editor's version of tables, and it limits the usefulness of tables (and wastes significant time by requiring manual updates to column widths after updates to content).\r\n\r\nI realize that responsive tables can be performance-degrading in browsers, but this really is a useful feature, especially in smaller tables, where performance isn't as much of an issue.\r\n\r\nFor more discussion on this, see my original post here:\r\n\r\n[https://community.atlassian.com/t5/Confluence-questions/What-happened-to-responsive-table-widths/qaq-p/1020187|https://community.atlassian.com/t5/Confluence-questions/What-happened-to-responsive-table-widths/qaq-p/1020187?utm_source=atlcomm&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=immediate_general_reply&utm_content=topic#U1299618]",

Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Create Confluence page using the new editor.\r\n # Add an attachment macro to the page.\r\n # Publish the page.\r\n # Note that you are not able to sort the table by clicking on its headers.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nUsers can sort the table on the view mode by clicking on the table headers.\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nClicking on the table headers does nothing.\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nThe workaround is to edit the page, edit the attachment macro and then edit the *sort by* and *sort order* fields.",
