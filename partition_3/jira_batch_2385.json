Your input in the comments helps us understand how this affects you and what you're hoping to accomplish with Bitbucket Data Center.\r\n\r\nWe spend a significant amount of time determining our product investments in Bitbucket Data Center. Unfortunately, we are not planning to address this suggestion in the next 12 months. In the last year, we have resolved many of the highly voted suggestions like Reviewer groups, Pull request templates, capability to enable/disable source branch deletion on merging pull requests and our upcoming roadmap includes a number of other top voted suggestions, including repository archiving. Please check out our [public roadmap|https://www.atlassian.com/roadmap/data-center?product=bitbucket] for more details on the coming soon and future items.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, we hope that everyone might consider an established 3rd-party add-on -\u00a0[Categories for Bitbucket|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/de.communardo.plugin.stash-project-categories/overview]. Our ecosystem is an important aspect of the product, providing flexibility where people want different or additional functionality, and maintaining simplicity where they don't.\r\n\r\nI understand that this may be disappointing, but it\u2019s important for us to be open, honest, and transparent with our customers. Product feedback is collected from many different sources and is evaluated when planning the product roadmap. You can\u00a0[learn more about our process here|https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/110373/how-does-the-jira-team-use-jira-atlassian-com].\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nImran Khan\r\n\r\nProduct Manager - Bitbucket Data Center & Server\r\n{panel}\r\n*Original request description*\r\n\r\nwith GIT we need to create more repositories than with subversion, also projects often contain more than one repository. In JIRA you can put projects into categories, it would be nice to be able to do the same thing in Stash, just to keep a better overview and allow people to better relate JIRA and Stash projects.\r\n\r\n(we are running version 1.2.4 which does not exist here. the \"Affects version\" field should be 1.2.4 but Jira does not allow me to do that)",

In Bitbucket Data Center 7.18 we've added HTTP Access Tokens for projects and repositories. More details can be found in the [release notes|https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/bitbucket-data-center-and-server-7-18-release-notes-1087534957.html#BitbucketDataCenterandServer7.18releasenotes-HTTPaccesstokensforprojectsandrepositories] and official [documentation|https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/http-access-tokens-939515499.html].\r\n\r\nFor those who are looking for the OAuth 2.0, please vote fo the ticket - BSERV-13061\r\n\r\nAnton Genkin\r\nProduct Manager\r\n{panel}\r\nh3. Problem Definition\r\n\r\nIt is inconvenient and in some cases not viable from a security standpoint to use password based authentication to access Bitbucket (eg for REST calls from scripts, CI systems and other tooling).\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nProvide the possibility to authenticate via HTTP using a token based mechanism (possibly OAuth).",

      "description": "{panel:title=Atlassian status as of December 2016|borderStyle=solid|borderColor=#3C78B5|titleBGColor=#3C78B5|bgColor=#E7F4FA}\r\nHi everyone,\r\n\r\nThanks to everyone for voting and commenting on this suggestion. Your input in the comments helps us understand how this affects you and what you're hoping to accomplish with Bitbucket Server.\r\n\r\nThis suggestion is currently under consideration by the Bitbucket development team, however we're not able to provide a timeline for when it will be resolved. [Learn more about our process here|https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/110373/how-does-the-jira-team-use-jira-atlassian-com].\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nNorman Ma\r\n\r\nProduct Manager - Bitbucket Server\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\nBriefly:\r\n With Git, users simply \"declare\" their identity within the configuration of the Git client, which ends up being recorded as the \"author\" when commits are made against a repository. However, when pushing to a repository hosted within Stash, the identity used to authenticate to the repository may be different then that identity that was recorded when the commits were made.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, there is no reliable way to verify or be reasonably certain that commit X was actually performed by user Y. The user could simply have declared their identity to be something false. The lack of a reliable audit trail of changes is a significant issue, particularly for corporations.\r\n\r\nOne solution to this issue is to require users to perform signed commits (or in the case of pull requests, only allow pull requests against a signed commit tag). The ability is needed to configure a repository to only allow commits that have been signed and verify that the signature is both valid and trusted. At present, this seems to be the only way to establish a reliable audit trail within Git.\r\n\r\nSome sources for details:\r\n [http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Basics-Tagging]\r\n [http://mikegerwitz.com/docs/git-horror-story.html]\r\n [http://git-blame.blogspot.com/2012/01/using-signed-tag-in-pull-requests.html]",

Your input in the comments helps us understand how this affects you and what you're hoping to accomplish with Bitbucket Server.\r\n\r\nWe spend a significant amount of time on an ongoing basis to determine our product investments in Bitbucket Server. Unfortunately, we are not currently planning to address this suggestion in the next 12 months. In the last 12 months, we've resolved 10 of the top 30 feature requests, and our upcoming roadmap includes a number of other top voted suggestions, including in-browser editing, improvements to search functionality, better JIRA integration, and providing an even better code review experience.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, we hope that everyone might consider an established 3rd-party add-on - [ScriptRunner for Bitbucket Server|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.onresolve.stash.groovy.groovyrunner/server/overview]. Our ecosystem is an important aspect of the product, providing flexibility where people want different or additional functionality, and maintaining simplicity where they don't.\r\n\r\nI understand that this may be disappointing, but we believe it\u2019s important for us to be open, honest and transparent with our customers. Product feedback is collected from a number of different sources and is evaluated when planning the product roadmap.

      "description": "{panel:title=Update from Support}\r\nWe've typically seen this error when users were trying to directly SSH into the Stash server over the SSH service provided by Stash using a Windows client. Stash only supports executing Git operations over SSH and does not allow any other type of SSH access. More information can be found at [dispatch_protocol_error: type 100 seq 8 Error When Connecting via SSH|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/STASHKB/dispatch_protocol_error%3A+type+100+seq+8+Error+When+Connecting+via+SSH].{panel}\r\n\r\nWe are attempting to setup our Jenkins CI server to pull projects from our trial Stash server. Jenkins is installed on a Windows 7 64-bit machine running OpenSSH 4.6p1 client from our Git installation (msysGit 1.7). When attempting to clone a git repository on this machine, we get the following:\r\n\r\n{{$ git clone ssh://git@dc2build:7999/ADD/projectname.git}}\r\n{{Cloning into 'projectname'...}}\r\n{{usage: ssh

This will help us to priorities further development.\r\n----\r\nBitbucket also has several features that help sign and verify commits:\r\n * [Committer Verification hook|https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/bitbucket-server-5-0-release-notes-889528342.html#BitbucketServer5.0releasenotes-Committerverification] which verifies that the committer for each new commit being pushed matches the credentials of the person doing the push.\r\n * [Verify Commit Signature hook|https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/bitbucket-server-5-1-release-notes-902140366.html#BitbucketServer5.1releasenotes-GPGsignedcommits]\u00a0requires GPG-signed commits in order to push. When it is enabled, each new commit or tag must be GPG-signed with a valid key, and that key must be associated with an active user account on the server. Otherwise the push is rejected.\r\n\r\nAnton Genkin\r\n Product Manager Bitbucket Server\r\n{panel}\r\n*Original request description*\r\n\r\nWhen performing a push, the author that is displayed by Stash is just taken from the author in the local git configuration, so essentially another developer can commit code against another developer's name and push it to the server to make it appear like that developer committed the code change.\r\n\r\nIn other words, when performing a push, stash doesn't ensure that the user performing the push is the same user as the GIT comitter. This allowed an authenticated user to push updates that appear to come from a different user by configuring their local GIT client with a different username/email address. I can see we may be able to work around this by implementing a GIT hookthat checks the REMOTE_USER variable exposed by Stash.\r\n\r\nAre there plans to implement this functionality directly into the product to improve security?\r\n\r\nWe need to have complete traceability on the push to the shared repository, is there a way of achieving this with Stash",

For example, creating a user or a group requires a POST request, as expected, but the payload is never examined; instead, all of the user or group's properties must be provided as query parameters. Removing a user from a group is also a POST request, rather than a DELETE request, and takes a JSON payload rather than query parameters.\r\n\r\nIf you are trying to automate user management in Stash using our REST services, you will run into a lot of pain with doing so. Some is documentation-related, but some is caused by the inconsistency of how the API is constructed.",

Your input in the comments helps us understand how this affects you and what you're hoping to accomplish with Bitbucket Data Center.\r\n\r\nWe spend a significant amount of time determining our product investments in Bitbucket Data Center. Unfortunately, we are not planning to address this suggestion in the next 12 months. In the last year, we have resolved many of the highly voted suggestions like Reviewer groups, Pull request templates, capability to enable/disable source branch deletion on merging pull requests and our upcoming roadmap includes a number of other top voted suggestions, including repository archiving. Please check out our [public roadmap|https://www.atlassian.com/roadmap/data-center?product=bitbucket] for more details on the coming soon and future items.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, we hope that everyone might consider an established 3rd-party add-on -\u00a0[Snippets for Bitbucket Server|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.simplenia.stash.plugins.snippets/server/overview]. Our ecosystem is an important aspect of the product, providing flexibility where people want different or additional functionality, and maintaining simplicity where they don't.\r\n\r\nI understand that this may be disappointing, but it\u2019s important for us to be open, honest, and transparent with our customers. Product feedback is collected from many different sources and is evaluated when planning the product roadmap. You can\u00a0[learn more about our process here|https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/110373/how-does-the-jira-team-use-jira-atlassian-com].\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nImran Khan\r\n\r\nProduct Manager - Bitbucket Data Center & Server\r\n{panel}\r\n*Original request description*\r\n\r\nImplement ability to share arbitrary snippets of code with other team members.

Your input in the comments helps us understand how this affects you and what you're hoping to accomplish with Bitbucket Server.\r\n\r\nWe spend a significant amount of time on an ongoing basis to determine our product investments in Bitbucket Server. Unfortunately, we are not currently planning to address this suggestion in the next 12 months. In the last 12 months, we've resolved 10 of the top 30 feature requests, and our upcoming roadmap includes a number of other top voted suggestions, including in-browser editing, improvements to search functionality, better JIRA integration, and providing an even better code review experience.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, we hope that everyone might consider an established 3rd-party add-on - [Activity Streams for Bitbucket Server|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/ch.mibex.stash.rss4stash/overview]. Our ecosystem is an important aspect of the product, providing flexibility where people want different or additional functionality, and maintaining simplicity where they don't.\r\n\r\nI understand that this may be disappointing, but we believe it\u2019s important for us to be open, honest and transparent with our customers. Product feedback is collected from a number of different sources and is evaluated when planning the product roadmap. You can [learn more about our process here|https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/110373/how-does-the-jira-team-use-jira-atlassian-com].\r\n\r\nNorman Ma\r\n\r\nProduct Manager - Bitbucket Server\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\n*Original request description*\r\n\r\nAdd RSS feeds to follow:\r\n* commits of each project\r\n* all commits\r\n* ...\r\nLike in Fisheye.",

      "description": "{panel:title=Atlassian status as of June 2015|borderStyle=solid|borderColor=#3C78B5|titleBGColor=#3C78B5|bgColor=#E7F4FA}\r\n\u2028Thanks for all your votes and comments on this suggestion.\r\n\r\nThis is a good idea and something we would like to see in Stash and FishEye, but at this point we do not currently have any plans to implement this into the products in the near future. We will be sure to update this issue when we have a better idea of when we might start working on it.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, if FishEye and Stash are already integrated, you can [easily add individual Stash Repositories to FishEye|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/FISHEYE/Integrating+FishEye+with+Stash#IntegratingFishEyewithStash-EasilyaddStashrepositoriestoFishEye].\r\n\r\nProduct feedback is collected from a number of different sources and is evaluated when planning the product roadmap. If you would like to know more about how Atlassian Product Management uses customer input during the planning process, please see\u00a0[this post on Atlassian Answers|https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/110373/how-does-the-jira-team-use-jira-atlassian-com] and our [new features policy|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/STASH/New+features+policy]. \r\n\r\nThanks for your patience and we hope you appreciate our open approach to feature requests. \r\nSteve King\r\nProduct Manager - Stash\u2028\u2028{panel}\r\n\r\nh3. Original request description\r\n\r\nI don't really want to have to manually create FishEye projects for every repo in Stash. A way to populate FishEye when a repo is created in Stash would be nice...or at least some very easy way to do it (ideally one that doesn't involve an administrator).\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nUse Fisheye's REST APIs to add repositories and set up their permissions:\r\n\r\n{{/rest-service-fecru/admin/repositories}}\r\n{{/rest-service-fecru/admin/repositories/<repository>/permissions}}\r\n{{/rest-service-fecru/admin/repositories/<repository>/permissions/groups}}\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n\r\n* https://developer.atlassian.com/server/fisheye-crucible/rest-api-guide/\r\n* https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/fecru-rest-examples/src/master/\r\n* https://docs.atlassian.com/fisheye-crucible/latest/wadl/fecru.html\r\n* https://docs.atlassian.com/fisheye-crucible/latest/wadl/fisheye.html\r\n* https://docs.atlassian.com/fisheye-crucible/latest/wadl/crucible.html\r\n",
