This means at the moment that they will directly consume images via their public (HTTP) URL. The problem with using those URLs is that they might not be stable (we don't consider them as part of the API), and they don't provide additional information about the consumed images ahead of requesting them (e.g. dimension). In addition, those resources often get consumed directly, even though they should be considered _static_ for the time of this Confluence version. \n\nIt would be good to have a service which can communicate images which are meant to be part of the API, e.g. spit out the internal (as in filesystem) URLs and public URLs for icons. \n\nPseudo code:\n\n{code}\npublic interface ConfluenceImageResourceService\n{\n    ImageResource urlForIcon(IconType type, UrlMode urlMode);\n}\n{code}\n\nwith \n\n{code}\npublic interface ImageResource\n{\n    URL getUrl();\n    \n    Dimension getDimension();\n}\n{code}\n\nand\n\n{code}\npublic enum IconType\n{\n    PAGE, BLOG, SPACE; // etc ...\n}\n{code}\n\nIf the HTTP URL is requested, the implementation should request the URL via _com.atlassian.plugin.webresource.WebResourceUrlProvider.getStaticResourcePrefix(UrlMode)_ so that the correct caching headers get applied (_com.atlassian.plugin.servlet.ResourceDownloadUtils.addPublicCachingHeaders(HttpServletRequest, HttpServletResponse)_). We would also have to provide a JS client for that service (possibly piggybacking the mapping on the initial response) in order to be used by plugins 3. That JS client should obviously only allow the retrieval of the HTTP URLs.\n",

But the only drawback is that I am always wondering where I am and on which level. In order to discover it, I have to do a lot of clicks up or down to find my way through the structure.\n\nIt would be great if we could have the overall Space structure with a single click. On the screenshot I attached, we can see the whole space structure, and clicking in one of the page brings us directly to that page. Wherever we want to go in the entire space, this will always be a single click!\n\nYou could also show the actual location (the currently selected page) highlighted, like shown on the attachment.\n\nHope you like the idea because that would bring great added value to a great looking Confluence version!",

Unlike the documentation Theme, there is no visual clue indicating if a page has child page(s) or not.\n\nI really like the new sidebar because of the customization we can add, the links, etc...

In order to approximate to [WYSIWYG|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG], the only choice these macros currently have is to use the [EditorImagePlaceholder|https://developer.atlassian.com/display/CONFDEV/Providing+an+Image+as+a+Macro+Placeholder+in+the+Editor] in order to create an image of the rendered output. \n\nThis is suboptimal for several reasons:\n\n* Browsers render HTML/CSS slightly differently, the image output will always be just an approximation\n* There are no good JVM-based HTML/CSS render engines out there, the best bet would be to either use [Flying Saucer|http://code.google.com/p/flying-saucer/] (only supports CSS 2.1) or to ship with one of the Browser's rendering engines (e.g. WebKit wrapped in QtWebKit via [Qt-Jambi |http://qt-jambi.org/]\n\n\nAny solution using this approach will be unnecessarily complex when the goal is to just use the output of the macro in the editor. There is also a CustomHtmlEditorPlaceholder interface available, but the implementation is also restricted to img and object tags.\n\nI've identified the following reasons for why the editor applies these restrictions so far:\n\n* the custom HTML should not be editable, as it gives the user the impression that whatever he puts inside the placeholder will be persisted for the page, but that code is just \"thrown away\"\n* images are single elements without a text node, thus the cursor never jumps in, and drag&drop is easy to implement\n\nAs for the first restriction, imo that should be a decision made by the plugin developer. One possible implementation I envision for this is to utilize TinyMCE's [noneditable|http://www.tinymce.com/tryit/noneditable_content.php] to signalise the user that the content is not editable. Also this plugin has its quirks, if the user somehow gets into the placeholder and starts editing the only effect is that this edit gets lost. If that happens often we can iterate on making the plugin better or even add supplying JS signalising the user that he's in the wrong spot.\n\nAs for the second restriction, it is easy to identify the placeholders root element as it contains all the attributes a normal macro contains in the editor (e.g. data-macro-name), thus Drag&Drop should be relatively easy to implement for that.\n\nI'd suggest modifying the CustomPlaceholderEditorMarshaller to allow custom HTML beyond <img> and <object>. For the old tags it should just behave like it did before, but for anything else it should just make the content not editable with the above mentioned noneditable plugin.",

This is due to architectural/programming decisions by atlassian.\n\nIn the Marketplace there is an extension from k15t.com which provides the functionality for Confluence Users which install the product on their own server.\n\nSo basically it is possible to have duplicate page names as long as the page permalink is unique.\n\nFurther details about the extension which does this functionality is to be found here:\nhttp://www.k15t.com/display/en/2012/11/08/Duplicate+Page+Titles+in+Confluence+for+Everyone\n\nREQUEST:\nAtlassian should add the possibility to have duplicate page names ASAP as we need to have structure with repeating page names like:\n\nDVD Authoring\n  - Overview\n  - Authoring\n  - Testing\n\nBlu-ray Authoring\n  - Overview\n  - Authoring\n  - Testing\n\netc.\n\nAs the On Demand Confluence product does not allow to install extensions from the marketplace, we are dependent solely on Atlassian to put this feature on the roadmap for future versions for the on demand product.\n\nWe think it is important for serious documentation of processes.\n\nThank you and kind regards\n\nSandro Barbieri\n\nREDSMOKE PRODUCTIONS GmbH\nGrabenstrasse 9\n8952 Schlieren\nSWITZERLAND\n\nP: 0041 44 575 22 44\n",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFSERVER-28275].\n  {panel}\n\n{panel:title=Atlassian Status as of 29 September 2014|borderStyle=solid|borderColor=#3C78B5| titleBGColor=#3C78B5| bgColor=#E7F4FA}\nUpdate: please refer to my [comment|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONF-28275?focusedCommentId=648705&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-648705] for the latest status on this ticket.\n----\nThanks for the continued feedback and completing the survey, which helped us understand your pain points with the current design. The majority (84%) of example logos provided were rectangular in shape, so simply preventing the rounding of space logos (as some requested) would not solve the problem for these 84%. Therefore, we have built a new uploader which works for both square and rectangular logos.\n\nWith the current uploader, you can only select a portion of a rectangular logo, e.g.:\n!before.png!\n\nWith the new uploader, you can zoom out and crop \u2018beyond\u2019 the border of the image, allowing you to fit the entire logo in, e.g.: \n!after.png!\n\nThis works for a square logo as well, and allows you to adjust it inside the area that was previously clipped due to the circular mask.\n\nThese changes will be shipping in Confluence 5.6 and in a Confluence OnDemand update in the next few weeks.\n\nThanks again to all for your input and feedback, I'll now be marking this issue as closed.\n\nRegards,\nJohn\nConfluence Product Manager\n{panel}\n\nWith Confluence 5.0, rounding of space logos was introduced and enforced as the only option.\n\nSome logos do not lend themselves to rounding and look quite bad with it. There should be a way to set space logos without modification as before.\n\nh5. Workaround\n\nFor a workaround involving CSS (as well as background on why rounded logos were introduced), please see [this comment|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONF-28275?focusedCommentId=450941&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-450941].",
