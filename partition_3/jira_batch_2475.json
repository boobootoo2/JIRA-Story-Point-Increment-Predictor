Through out the review process multiple fixes can emerge and trying to keep our history clean we rewrite our PR commits. Luckily Bitbucket can handle that and outdated comments can be still found (and Activity tab is a life saver).\\\\\nBut we would like Bitbucket even more friendly in that regard. Some PRs get really big and include multiple commits. It is really hard to keep context of all changes while doing review and it is easier to review commit by commit. The PR page has a \"Commits\" tab showing all commits. When you click on particular commit, you can see the diff and put comments there. The problem is that those comments are not considered to be part of PR and do not show up in Activities tab. If/when PR commits are rewritten to accommodate latests fixes based on other comments, all comments made to particular commit are lost and it is VERY hard to find them.\n\nIt would be nice if when you open commits from PR, they keep track that we are reviewing them as part of PR and thus all comments made there are considered part of PR (thus show up in Activities tab). You could have a special URL to view commit inside PR, e.g. /pull-requests/<PR_id>/<branch_name>/commits/<commit_id> in addition to usual commit URL /commits/<commit_id>.\n\nEven if you do not rewrite Git history it would still be beneficial to see all comments to all commits under Activities tab.",

      "description": "{code}\n In the past few weeks or months, I&#x27;ve been treated like a dog, literally. Whoever decided to invade my space on the web did it in a manner that is unacceptable to any decent human being. There has been nothing but deception, lies, false information, misleading facts, and behavior that makes me sorry I actually am alive in this world with such rude, obnoxious, and low life acting human beings. That may sound harsh, but I mean it 110%. It embarrases the hell out of me to know that anyone would conduct themselves in such an ugly manner. In not the smartest guy, but even the intelligence these people possess is covered up by the crack head acts they choose to do. Sure they may accuse me of being a drug addict and I have been for 18+ years and still possess more intelligence than all but maybe two people and that has to change. The neat thing is that I know exactly how to get that done. In not anybody special, but I can promise these immoral folks my words are going to have more of an impact on their positions more than they think. Even funnier, I know they think I&#x27;m full of it, but I place a bet with any of them that thinks I&#x27;m lying. You messed up BAD. I&#x27;m not even sure what your protocol is but I sure know you didn&#x27;t follow it. No one in their right mind would develop a process so messed up. At least the way you handled things. Did anyone ever once think to apologize? No is the answer I have documented, and that is just disgusting also. If you think what you did was right to a paralyzed human being in any manner, you&#x27;re, sadly, wrong. I checked on that too. You picked the wrong person to treat so unkind and like an idiot. In sorry y&#x27;all, but I&#x27;m not and I&#x27;ll take any of you on in any subject that exists, and you&#x27;ll not win at knowledge and details. YOU DONE WRONG!! I&#x27;ve got more info documented than you can probably think of in three months or more. That does not include names and addresses because I think that is wrong to reveal such things.  Like I said yesterday, would I entertain your crap without having proper things put in place before doing so? If you really think I would, again, you are wrong. Thank you to the two ladies and two dudes that did believe I was more than capable of doing things even I want sure of. May God bless y&#x27;all all the days of your lives for having a warm heart. That&#x27;s all I&#x27;ve got to say. I will not communicate with you unless you send some kind of anonymous letter or something like. I&#x27;m just disappointed in the way you went about things, and I know I didn&#x27;t deserve to be treated in such an awful manner. I forgive you. \n\n                                                          Sincerely,\n                                                               Benjamin Wayne Dawson\n{code}",
