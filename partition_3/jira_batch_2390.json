It's called the .mailmap file, and in recent versions of git it is enabled by default when viewing git log. This .mailmap file is useful for avoiding having to rewrite history in git when someone changes their name, such as when getting married, transitioning gender, or replacing their single-word glam name with \"The Artist Formerly Known As GlamName\".\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n*Suggestion*\r\n\r\nIn the main branch of a repo, if the latest commit has a .mailmap at the root, apply that in all display contexts.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n*But there's an existing feature for this, isn't there?*\r\n\r\nEach user in Bitbucket can set their alternative email addresses to correlate old commits with their active Atlassian account. Unfortunately, the user-level configuration for alternative email addresses requires that an email can be verified. It is often that old commits have \"email addresses\" that are computer names, or email addresses that belong to defunct domains, or just dead email addresses. Without .mailmap functionality, these display identities cannot be correlated with an active Atlassian user.",

The problem is however, what if I only want to deploy to DEV3? My only option is to go DEV1, then DEV2, then DEV3. I can't just click the button for DEV3.\r\n\r\nI would like the option to mark all 5 of those steps as optional, so I can click them in any order to deploy to my chosen environment.\r\n\r\nAnother scenario is the following. Say I have two DEV environments DEV1, DEV2, one STG environment STG1, and one PROD environment PROD1. You cannot do this:\r\n{code:java}\r\n-\u00a0parallel:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n    -\u00a0step:\u00a0*Deploy-dev1\r\n    - step: *Deploy-dev2\r\n    - step: *Deploy-stg1\r\n    - step: *Deploy-prod1{code}\r\nBecause bitbucket-pipelines will not allow you to mix DEV, STG, and PROD steps in a parallel group.
