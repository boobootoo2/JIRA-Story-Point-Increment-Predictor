I\u2019m here to report that we\u2019ve been building and testing this feature internally and it is now ready for primetime. We plan to roll this feature out in a phased manner starting next week (August 31st). You should be getting this feature on your instance in the next 2-3 weeks. Here\u2019s a community post that explains what this feature will look like in the new editor - https://community.atlassian.com/t5/Confluence-articles/The-ability-to-add-version-comments-is-BACK-in-Confluence-Cloud/ba-p/1464221\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\n{panel:title=Status Update 26 June 2020|borderStyle=solid|borderColor=#ebf2f9|titleBGColor=#ebf2f9|bgColor=#ffffff}\r\n\r\nThank you for your interest and patience with this request. I can confirm that we are going to be introducing this feature (permanently) in the new editor. We are going to start working on this in the next few weeks. We will make sure we keep the status of this ticket updated and give you a rough ETA when we have one.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nSai\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\n{panel:title=Status Update 13 March 2020|borderStyle=solid|borderColor=#ebf2f9|titleBGColor=#ebf2f9|bgColor=#ffffff}\r\n\r\nAs we're working through this feature and others, we wanted to address a lot of your concerns as to the future of the new editor and legacy editor.\r\n\r\nPlease read our recent community post here: https://community.atlassian.com/t5/Confluence-Cloud-articles/Change-to-your-content-is-in-your-hands/ba-p/1324476\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nAvinoam\r\n\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\n{panel:title=Atlassian Update \u2013 03-Feb-2020|borderStyle=solid|borderColor=#ebf2f9|titleBGColor=#ebf2f9|bgColor=#ffffff}\r\nHi everyone,\r\n\r\nThank you for your feedback on bringing back the \"What's Changed\" comment box when publishing a page in the new editor. To set the right expectations, in our public editor roadmap here\u00a0[https://confluence.atlassian.com/confcloud/confluence-cloud-editor-roadmap-967314556.html]\u00a0you can see that our focus in the short/medium term is on bringing back some of the key documentation features like linking to an undefined page, linking text to an attachment, linking images etc.\u00a0\r\n\r\nYou are still able to use Page History and Compare Versions to provide more objective and reliable logs of what has been changed. We'll revisit this suggestion once we get through some of the more burning areas of feature gap feedback we've been getting for the new editor. Thank you again for your feedback.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\n\r\nSunny\r\n{panel}\r\nh4. Suggestion\r\n\r\nBring back the \"what's changed\" comment box when publishing to the new editor.\u00a0\r\n\r\nh4. Workaround\r\n\r\nTwo possible ways to add comments when saving changes to a page:\r\n\r\n1) Keep on using the old editor until this feature will be implemented in the new one as well.\r\n\r\n2) Push a change comment to Confluence using REST-API\r\n{code:java}\r\ncurl -u EMAIL-ADDRESS:API-TOKEN -X PUT http://YOUR-INSTANCE.atlassian.net/wiki/rest/api/content/CONTENT_ID -d '{\"type\":\"page\",\"title\":\"NEW TITLE\",\"version\":{\"message\":\"CHANGE COMMENT\", \"number\": 2}, \"space\":{\"key\u201d:\u201dYOURSPACEKEY\u201d}}\u2019 -H 'Content-type: application/json'{code}\r\nh4. Note\r\n\r\nIn order for the above to work, you MUST supply a new title and the next version to be generated (thus, if you are up to version 2, change this to 3, and so on.) The Confluence title can be changed within the UI afterwards.",

When the [older username structure was used|https://confluence.atlassian.com/cloud/blog/2018/06/say-goodbye-to-usernames-in-atlassian-cloud], creating a personal space would have its key as the username used and sometimes, the username could be the whole email for the user.

I\u2019ve been feature leading a stream of work to bring image linking functionality back to the editor in Confluence Cloud. I\u2019m super excited to let you know that it\u2019s now been rolled out to 100% of customers!\r\n\r\nNote: some customers have asked for a slower rollout. If you don\u2019t have it on your instance yet, this is likely why. Hold tight, you\u2019ll receive it in the coming weeks!\r\n\r\nTo add a link to an image, simply select an image in the editor -> click on the link icon in the floating toolbar -> type in your link or use the in-product search dropdown that appears -> press enter to confirm. Voila! You\u2019ve added a link to your image.\r\n\r\nWe hope you love it as much as we do.\r\n\r\nThanks for your feedback. I\u2019m going to close this ticket out now as done.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nPaul | Feature Lead, Atlassian Cloud Editor{panel}\r\nWith the new Fabric Editor, it is no longer possible to add a link to an image, making the image clickable to open link address. This was standard functionality in the old editor.\r\nh3. Environment\r\n\r\nFabric Editor\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Create a new page in Fabric Editor\r\n # Add an image to your new page\r\n # Click on the page in edit mode\r\n # The link icon in the menu is now greyed out\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nWhen I click on the image in the Fabric Editor I expect to be able to click on the link icon in the menu, to add a link.\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nThere is no option to add link to an image. When you click the image in the Fabric Editor the link icon in the menu is greyed out.\r\n\r\nWorkaround\r\n Use an add-on like draw.io or Gliffy to import an image and add link to a transparent box covering the image.",

Summary\r\nWhen attachments like Office files or PDFs have been attached to a page, the user can click on these files to have a preview of the file contents load in the browser. The first time a user opens such a preview it will take Confluence a few seconds to display the preview. The text \"Your preview is on its way\\!\" is displayed at this time.
