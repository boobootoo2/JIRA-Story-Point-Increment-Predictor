When using the option of 'Apply to these projects', the user  is able to select which project can and which project cannot use the Classic Boards. However, it seems that they cannot disable all the projects\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n# Head to the 'GreenHopper Configuration' page in your JIRA Administration\r\n# At the 'Enabled Projects' tab, try to first add all the projects into the 'GreenHopper Projects' list (This is because, by default, the radiobutton 'All Projects' are selected, thus no projects are in the 'GreenHopper Projects' list)\r\n# Then, try to remove all of them\r\n# When  you click on 'Modify' after removing all of them, the list will turn yellow, and nothing will happen. When the screen is refreshed, the projects are back i nthe 'GreenHopper Projects' list\r\n\r\nh3. Additional Info\r\n\r\n* This was tested in GreenHopper 6.2.1 and GreenHopper 6.2.2. \r\n* I've attached a video of how the bug occurs, so that it's more convenient",

      "description": "h3. Issue\r\n\r\nWhen creating an epic and then clicking on the \"Create Issue in Epic\", a clean new issue is created without associating the issue with the Epic. It seems that the button is working just like \"Create a new Issue\".\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n# Create a GreenHopper rapid board;\r\n# In the Epics section (left side of the page), click \"Create Epic\";\r\n# Create a new Epic;\r\n# Click the dropdown arrow right beside (in the left) the Epic name;\r\n# You will see the number of general issue statistics on this Epic and a \"Create issue in epic\" link;\r\n# The default \"Create Issue\" screen will open;\r\n# After creating the issue, you will verify that the issue wasn't associated with the Epic;\r\n# Clicking in the issue to see the detail view will show \"Epic: _None_\";\r\n\r\nh3. Environment clarification\r\n\r\n- This is occurring only in GreenHopper 6.2 versions released so far. Versions released before 6.2 (6.1 and below) are working fine.\r\n- This was working before by default (tested in clean instances with GreenHopper 6.1 and 6.0). The correct screen should be called from default;",

After performing this function, it did not return to the backlog, but was removed entirely from the Rapid Board.\r\n\r\nThis is critical since we truly are unaware of which items are being displayed on the Rapid Boards and which are not. We are working with a 3rd party company on this particular project and collaboration with them through the Rapid Boards is vital.\r\n\r\nAlso note: We have other Issues in the same state, criteria and status but do appear on the Plan Board without issue.\r\n\r\nIf you navigate directly to the issue detail, then click Agile > View on Board, JIRA states \"There are no boards which contain this issue.\"\r\nScreenshot: http://screencast.com/t/lAPBzIOgX\r\n\r\nProject Name: DDB - RMHC Site\r\nProject URL: https://reside.jira.com/browse/DDBS\r\n\r\nIssue ID: DDBS-11\r\nIssue URL: https://reside.jira.com/browse/DDBS-11\r\n\r\nRapid Board name: DDB - RMHC Site\r\nRapid Board URL: https://reside.jira.com/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=64\r\n\r\nBelow is the checklist from the earlier referenced wiki article:\r\n1.

Remove/Add Stories so that the Sprint can be doable\r\n\r\nIt is extremely painful and when the customer is there (face to face planning meeting) is shameful, so usually we can prioritize but defer the final planning and negotiate the final Sprint plan offline with the customer.... not a real agile approach\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

This frequently brings up questions about the teams being on or off track.\r\n\r\n*Imagine the following scenario:*\r\nTeam Rocket committed to burn down 100 story points. Halfway into the sprint, they have already burned down most of the committed story points and some of the team members start to work on other issues of the backlog. Since everything needs to be tracked, they pull them into the active sprint. These scope changes now lead to confusion about if the team is still working on the original commitment or on additional work.\r\n\r\n*There are two options:*\r\n# The team is on track, which means it has burned down most of the original committed stories and everybody should be cheering\r\n# The team is off track, because even though their burndown looks nice, they have been working on stuff that has been pulled in as scope changes and they have not worked on some of the originally committed stories.\r\n\r\nA possible solution could be to render two different graphs, one for the original scope excluding scope changes (yellow) and one containing both  the original scope and the scope changes (red):\r\n\r\n!burndown_ontrack_legend.png!\r\n\r\n_Note: This is a mockup and the actual curve might not be 100% correct._\r\n\r\nWe found ourselves in a situation where we would get nervous calls from our directors asking why our burndowns look so bad and if we can make it while our SCRUM masters were totally satisfied, because the teams had actually a better throughput and pulled in additional work. The other way around, a burndown could look good, but originally committed work had been ignored.\r\n\r\n*This is a real showstopper for us!*",
