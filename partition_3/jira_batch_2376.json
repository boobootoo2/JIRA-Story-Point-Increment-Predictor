An archived project/repo may be hidden from lists and search results by default, indicate its archived status and/or would be read only.\r\n\r\nOne possible workaround for managing the access side of things is to make the whole project readonly, and then use repository permissions to grant additional access to certain repositories, but this means editing all repositories just to reduce access to one.",

Maybe by working together with IntelliJ, the Eclipse Foundation/Eclipse dev team(s), Rational, etc. there might be a way to allow Stash to take advantage of IDE-like code browsing behavior.\r\n\r\nI totally understand that this would be incredibly difficult to implement. It is one of those \"wouldn't it be nice if...\" features to be able to really see what is going on in the code when doing a code review using Stash instead of something like IDea's IDEtalk which isn't git/pull request aware.\r\n\r\nMaybe an easier version of this could be to integrate Stash with an IDE so that you could have a stash plugin in the IDE that would be aware of a pull request in Stash, could clone the repo, copy it, checkout each repo version in each directory so it was pointed at the before/after commit ids, then copy the IDE's project files, reindex for each version in each IDE project, and then you could see each version of the code easily. But, doing it this way would be painful to wait on for the developer; it would be *much* easier to just click on something in the git diff in Stash instead (so the Stash server would handle all of the copying/cloning/checking out/etc. required to allow such behavior).\r\n\r\nSome real \"out of the box\" thinking on this one. ;)",

As the issue hasn't collect votes, watchers, comments, or support cases from many customers during its lifetime, it's very low on our priority list, and will not be fixed in the foreseeable future. That's why we've decided to resolve it as *Timed Out*.\r\n\r\nAlthough we're aware the issue is still important to those of you who were involved in the conversations around it, we want to be clear in managing your expectations. The Bitbucket Server team is focusing on issues that have broad impact and high value, reflected by the number of comments, votes, support cases, and customers interested. Please consult the [Atlassian Bugfix Policy|https://confluence.atlassian.com/support/atlassian-bug-fixing-policy-201294573.html] for more details.\r\n\r\nWe understand how disappointing this decision may be, but we hope you'll appreciate our transparent approach and communication. If you're really passionate about this suggestion, please comment with your case in detail and we'll reconsider. Atlassian will continue to watch this issue for further updates, so please feel free to share your thoughts in the comments.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nImran Khan\r\nProduct Manager - Bitbucket Server and Data Center\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\nAs a user, I'd like to be able to create a pull request without having to navigate to the project.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to have a global pull request button. The pull request dialog includes a drop-down for selecting a project. I'd like that drop down to allow me to select any project (with search functionality probably) so that I could create a pull request from anywhere. It should probably default to the current project if you came from a project page.",

      "description": "{panel:title=Atlassian status as of March 2020|borderStyle=solid|borderColor=#deebff|titleBGColor=#deebff|bgColor=#ffffff}\r\nHi all,\r\n\r\nI'm excited to share that in Bitbucket Server 7.0 we shipped redesigned and optimized pull request page with several improvements you\u2019ve been asking us. Icons in the diff file-tree have much cleaner and contrast design, which was tested on colorblind users. We believe you will find new experience much more satisfying.\r\n\r\nYou can find more information in the Bitbucket Server 7.0\u00a0[release notes|https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/bitbucket-server-7-0-release-notes-990546638.html] and Pull Requests [documentation|https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/review-and-discuss-a-pull-request-808488540.html].\r\n\r\nPlease, don't hesitate to leave feedback on the feature in the comments. This will help us to priorities further development.\r\n\r\nAnton Genkin\r\nProduct Manager Bitbucket Server\r\n{panel}\r\n*Original message*\r\n\r\nUnder the diffs the file structure has color code for files that have been moved, deleted, changed, or added. I believe the colors are green, red, brown, and blue; I have a hard time viewing green, red, and brown, thus out of ease of use, i was hoping for a colorblind mode.",

Nonetheless, there's one BitBucket feature we deeply miss in Stash - AJAX notifications about changes to pull requests, like added/deleted/changed commits, new comments, approval/disapproval. I happened to ask colleagues for approval after they've already done so because I got so used to having been notified by a little AJAX popup in the lower-right corner of the window of the change that happened.\r\n\r\nIdeally everything would be updated without requiring page refresh: comments, approval status etc. but at the very least a notification about what's changed so that we know we have to refresh the page is needed.",

As the issue hasn't collect votes, watchers, comments, or support cases from many customers during its lifetime, it's very low on our priority list, and will not be fixed in the foreseeable future. That's why we've decided to resolve it as *Timed Out*.\r\n\r\nAlthough we're aware the issue is still important to those of you who were involved in the conversations around it, we want to be clear in managing your expectations. The Bitbucket Server team is focusing on issues that have broad impact and high value, reflected by the number of comments, votes, support cases, and customers interested. Please consult the [Atlassian Bugfix Policy|https://confluence.atlassian.com/support/atlassian-bug-fixing-policy-201294573.html] for more details.\r\n\r\nWe understand how disappointing this decision may be, but we hope you'll appreciate our transparent approach and communication. If you're really passionate about this suggestion, please comment with your case in detail and we'll reconsider. Atlassian will continue to watch this issue for further updates, so please feel free to share your thoughts in the comments.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nImran Khan\r\nProduct Manager - Bitbucket Server and Data Center\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\nCurrently when a commit contains modifications to images, it's only possible to directly compare images by content. \r\n\r\nPlease show dimensions (and image depth) for old / new images.",

      "description": "Being able to set permissions a finer levels of entity (Project -> Repo -> Branch) is great, but the Read/Write/Admin levels are too coarse.\r\n\r\nFor instance, in order to fork a repo, a developer needs to have Admin permissions on a Project (in order to create a new repository). But I don't want them to have Admin permission on all Repositories. In addition, if I want to implement an internal 'GitHub', that allows developers to share their code, I can't do this because they need Admin permissions on a Project in order to create a Repo, which would give them power over all Repos.\r\n\r\nSo... can we have the ability to define security roles that allow us to define actions that users and groups can perform?",

We know it's been a while since this suggestion was raised and we're sorry to have kept you without a clear answer.\r\n\r\nYour feedback has really helped us better understand the challenges you face being unable to modify links between commits and  Jira issues. Despite our lack of communication, this problem is actually one of those areas we plan to improve. Right now we've decided to prioritise it on our roadmap.\r\n\r\nThank you again for all your feedback on this suggestion and we look forward to providing you with more updates as we work on the solution.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nAnton Genkin\u00a0| Product Manager - Integrations\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\n*Original request description:*\r\n\r\nIt should be possible to change the link of a STASH commit to a JIRA issue after it has been pushed to the git server. This way, for example, a wrong or missing commit <-> issue link can be modified or added afterwards.",
