There is no easy way to have the information on the plug-in menu, you need to expand one plug-in at a time. Sadly, I have seen many case where it blows up when you do this or you loose all your expanded plugins.\n\n4) Add a button to run a GC (garbage collection) close to the memory and refresh after. \n\n5) Bad vendor for the Social Bookmarking Plugin: ${project.organization.name}\n\n5) 1 to 3 on the Support Utility menu",

However, it's missing the [database setup guides|http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Database+Setup+Guides] in step 5. The setup guides should be cleaned up (made to look professional and checked for quality/accuracy) and integrated into the main path for production installation. Some have children pages for creating a data source in Tomcat, others do not. This should be consistent. These were all made in a haphazard way years ago, even before we had a docs team. The warning at the top of the Oracle guide guide has been there for years - it was the product of an early frustrated developer, I suspect!\n\n   1. The [Any External DB guide|http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Database+Setup+For+Any+External+Database] should be deprecated; it's from before we had supported platforms.\n   2.

SEE: \n* Included Luisa's recent change to the Database Setup For MySQL page: \"Specify/Increase the value for max_allowed_packet {shell> mysqld \\--max_allowed_packet=32M}\n* I have added procedural panels using the panel macro to the Database setup pages.  These pages contain includes and excerpts (extant), but the panel macro may make this content appear inappropriately in other pages to which it is pulled in as an include.\n* The [Configuring an Oracle Datasource in Apache Tomcat|http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/DRAFT+-+Configuring+an+Oracle+Datasource+in+Apache+Tomcat] requires page completion and formatting -- it is currently a series of placeholders headings.  I was uncertain about which content to migrate from the main Oracle DB page, if at all.  The text include is therefore styled to make its appearance felt as an obvious include.\n* The 'Before You Start' points at the beginning of the Confluence Setup Guide are fairly rudimentary -- if retained, they will require reworking.\n* The updated page with all content and formatting changes is at: http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/DRAFT+-+Confluence+Setup+Guide\n* Have checked the online help dependencies -- there are no problems with deleting the [Any External Database|http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Database+Setup+For+Any+External+Database] page.  Agree that the content of this page is redundant and adds to the docs maintenance load.\n* The Database Setup Guides page is redundant and should be deleted IF the DB setup guides are migrated to become children of the Database Configuration page.\n* The 'configuring a dataset' child pages will need to be migrated to the parent DB Configuration page.

After keying in the login details and hit login, it will still redirect the user back to login page. This seems to be that cookies are not accepted by it whereby IE treat Confluence as third party.\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n# Create a html page with the following code:\n#* {code:html}\n<iframe src=\"http://extranet.atlassian.com\" width=\"100%\" height=\"600\" />\n{code}\n# Try to access the page in browser and try to log in using IE 7/8/9\n\n\\\\\nIt would be nice if it is possible to add a P3P header in any Confluence page that set cookies.\n\nUseful reference (pointed by customer): [http://adamyoung.net/IE-Blocking-iFrame-Cookies]",

When working with rss feeds this doesn't seem to work.\n AND-ing means: \"...matches all of the labels...\". If I adapted the logic to the contentbylabel macro I would write 'labels=+hummingbird,+blackbird' (show me all content about hummingbirds and blackbirds - but not content labelled with only one of 'blackbird' or 'hummingbird').\n\nAn analogy to contentbylabel might look something like:\nhttp://my.wiki.org/createrssfeed.action?types=blogpost&...&labelString=%2Bhummingbird,%2Bblackbird&rssType=atom&maxResults...os_authType=basic (URL-encoded + and even - signs)\n\nAnd what would be even more comfortable is the explicit exclusion of labels: Show me all content that provides (at least) the labels \"bear, dog\" but not \"cat\". If I adapted the logic to the contentbylabel macro I would write 'labels=+bird,-hummingbird' (show me all content about birds, but exclude content about hummingbirds.\").\n\nAs I noted I am looking for the label functionality (use of logical operators) in rss feeds (Feed Builder, generated URLs) I know from the contentbylabel macro e.g..\n",

Why rearrange?\n\\\\\nBased on the following documentation, the order of the column in indexing is important:\n\n- [Database Column order|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_(database)#Column_order]\n\nThe upgrade task should also rearrange database indexes which is important to improve the performance of database, please have a look at the following screenshots.\n\n*Upgraded instance*\n\n!conf_3.3.3_upgrade.png!\n\n*Fresh install*\n\n!conf_3.3.3_fresh.png!\n\nh5. Why remove?\n{quote}\nAnother disadvantage is using too many indexes can actually slow your database down\n{quote}\n\nAlso, quoted above from the following link:\n\n- [Introduction to Database Indexes|http://www.interspire.com/content/2006/02/15/introduction-to-database-indexes/]\n\nUpgrade task also should remove indexes that is not required anymore.\n\nCurrently an upgraded Confluence instance, still retains the orders of indexes and also some indexes that are not in use anymore. For example, when we upgrade Confluence 2.8.3 to Confluence 3.3.3, the index {{cl_spacekey_idx}} is still remain in the upgraded instance, but not in fresh install.\n\nRegards,\nHengHwa",

This causes confusion because clicking on the parent in the breadcrumb path does not take the user back to the parent page, but rather the parent page from which the page is located. The back button and breadcrumb path should be in sync such that clicking the parent link in the breadcrumb is the same as hitting the back button. The current implementation breaks that rule. A single page can have many references, so always displaying the main physical link from the space in which the page is located breaks link from the context.\n\nExample:\n\nSpace A/Page A1\nSpace B/Page B1\n\nIf Page B1 links to Page A1 I would expect my breadcrumb to look like this: Dashboard > Space B > Page B1 > Page A1 \nInstead my Breadcrumb becomes this: Dashboard > Space A > Page A1\n\nClicking Space A does not take me to Page B1, but the back button does.",

The old method allowed animation of the content (one frame per mouse click). This was a good way to compare two similar images.\n\nThe 3.3 method requires two clicks to go from one image to the next, and the intervening shrink and grow animations totally defeat the animation and visual comparison of content.\n\n1) Please provide an option to disable the animation of thumbnails. These are slow and distracting from the content on a local network and agonizing on a slow link.\n2) Please provide a way to reposition and resize the expanded view. This should be remembered for the next expanded view use.\nThis allows quicker picking through multiple thumbnails.\n3) Best: go back to the old way, just raise the window each time a new thumbnail is loaded.\n\nI understand that the new method was a response to complaints about popup blockers preventing the old method. We don't see that, though Firefox blocks popups by default. We think think the solution is worse than the problem. Much worse.\n\n*Note*\nDisabling the \"fancybox web resources\" module would workaround this problem, but causes other parts of Confluence to break, such as the Insert Image dialog.",

Considerable functionality relies on this content tag. Eg Doc Theme breaks without it.  Themes choice breaks without it.  \n\nTo exploit it, create a user with html in the login name, then create a personal space as that user. Finally, use a decorator=none request param when viewing a page to see the content tags.\n\nThere are actually a few places that the space key isn't encoded, so removing the ability to pass \"decorator=none\" is probably not a complete fix.",

Page rendering takes a huge performance/lag hit for pages within large spaces that make use of the pagetree and children macros.  This also affects large spaces using the Documentation theme.  The slowness is directly attributed to the way both macros decide which pages should be rendered in the list which is visible to the current user.\n\nGiven that this particular space has 11000 pages, the pagetree macro takes around 2 minutes to render depending on where you are starting within the tree.\n",
