Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Run the API [/2.0/repositories/<workspace>/<repo_slug>/environments/ | https://developer.atlassian.com/bitbucket/api/2/reference/resource/repositories/%7Bworkspace%7D/%7Brepo_slug%7D/environments/] with the following payload\r\n{code}\r\n{\r\n      \"deployment_gate_enabled\": true,\r\n      \"environment_type\": {\r\n        \"type\": \"deployment_environment_type\",\r\n        \"name\": \"Test\",\r\n        \"rank\": 0\r\n      },\r\n      \"name\": \"Test\"\r\n    }\r\n{code}\r\n(i) Repo shouldn't connect to any Jira ITSM project while reproducing the issue\r\n # Navigate to \"Repository Settings>Deployment\" and there's no option for users to toggle off the deployment gating flag\r\n !image-2020-10-27-09-14-06-333.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\"deployment_gating\" flag auto-set as \"*false*\" if the repo is not linked to Jira ITSM project or Jira criteria are not met.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nThe API request able to parse  \"deployment_gate_enabled\" as true, which will block Pipelines build to deploy to the specific deployment environment.\r\nAnd there's no option on UI for users to turn off the feature for the deployment environment.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n* UI: Re-add the deployment environment through UI\r\n* API: Run API to delete the deployment environment, then run POST request the add new deployment environment with the  \"deployment_gate_enabled\" field as \"false\"",

Only the workspaces which have a different Bitbucket user name and Workspace ID in the system are impacted.\r\n\r\nThe condition for this issue to trigger is when the branch permission contains a group in either the \"write access\" or \"merge via pull request\" fields.\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # On a workspace, navigate to the repository > Repository settings > branch permissions\r\n # When adding new branch permission, on the \"Write access\" or \"Merge via pull request\" fields, add a user group\r\n # If you try to save, you will see the following error message:\r\n{code:java}\r\ngroup not found: <groupname>\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nThe branch permissions settings should work, allowing the admin to add a group to the branch permission.\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nThe below error message is thrown when a group is present in the branch permission being added:\r\n{code:java}\r\ngroup not found: <groupname>\r\n{code}\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nThere is no workaround currently available. We will update the ticket with a workaround as soon as available",
