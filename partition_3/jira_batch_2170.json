If the user only edits once or twice during the life of the browser process, then it's okay.  But if you're doing lots of content creation or editing, and therefore using the editor quite a bit, the memory consumption eventually becomes so great that system resources become an issue.\n\nI can demonstrate this problem by going to any page and clicking Edit, then cancelling to leave the editor.  Each time I do this, my Chrome process grows fairly dramatically.   \n\nIn an effort to put some numbers around it, I did some testing and created a spreadsheet, and from that I created a chart (attached).   The chart illustrates memory consumption (in MB) on IE vs Chrome, for successive editing sessions of the exact same page (a simple page that fits \"above the fold\")\n\nThat exercise made me realize that the problem is not _quite_ as bad as I thought, because the memory consumption does seem to level off in Chrome on a simple test, in which the same page is being edited again and again.\n\nIt would take me more time than I have right now to do a comprehensive test of a more realistic scenario, but I can assure you that, when you're editing multiple pages, and using multiple browser windows or tabs, you eventually start to get some amazing memory consumption -- around half a GB for a single process.   This definitely becomes noticeable.  And I'm not talking about hundreds of pages over the course of many hours.  Just a dozen or so pages for an hour or two,  a fairly normal amount of work for an active editor.\n\nThe memory consumption in Chrome is spectacular enough that I was certain this issue would already exist in JIRA.  I looked for one pretty hard, but did not find one.  If this turns out to be a duplicate, I apologize.",

But to improve its usability I lack some features. \n\nI need a switch (button, checkbox, link) that hides finished tasks. I do not want to see them. It would be fine to show only open, only finished and both tasks.\n\nBoth finished and open tasks looks same, they can be distinguised only by the state of their checkboxes. So I propose to put CSS styles for finished tasks and make it by default italic/grey.\n\nThere are many other features, that would boost productivity of this feature. For example add labels to each task, filters by tasks, deadlines .. But for now I will be happy with hiding finished tasks.",

But while a space admin may configure security/permissions based on users identity or group membership, he doesn't have the ability to modify any group. This leads to use alternatives such as:\n - require the wiki main admin to add/remove user to/from groups each time\n - do the thing with individual people instead of groups\n\nI think local groups with space scope would be a nice improvement and would be really usefull. \n",

By having such content/pages heavily labelled anyway and - let's say - these labels are used much often as well (perhaps just in the past) - then we've such labels in our result list even though they are not important enough to appear in that list anymore.\n\nSometimes we rather have an overview of recently heavy used labels, especially as a service-oriented department in our company. I could imagine to have a parameter like {popular-labels:style=heatmap|count=15|timePeriod=Month|value=6}\n\nNote: timePeriod=Month parameter is already available for the {chart} macro (Millisecond to Year), value could be added as well. Indeed we don't need values below days for the {popular labels} macro. :)\n\n\nSame for the {recently-used-labels} macro which also does not allow to limit to a certain time frame.\n\nThanks in advance!",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFSERVER-25464].\n  {panel}\n\nThe editor in 4.2.2 (probably was introduced earlier but our company is just upgrading to 4.x) takes up an excessive amount of vertical space.  I'm calling this a bug since I think it\u2019s a bad UX design and should have been thought through.\n\nThe title bar, toolbar and lower tool/info bar take up about 250 pixels combined.  On a screen where your browser leaves you with 875 vertical pixels of space, the controls for the editor are taking almost 30% of the usable region!!\n\nThe  title bar is especially excessive.  Its uses unnecessarily huge font text.  It should be made smaller so that more room can be left for editable region.\n\nSome improvements / specific issues:\n* Make the title bar a regular size one-line text region (no formatting)\n* Once a table has been added to the document, the table controls in the toolbar are always displayed even if your cursor is not contextually inside of the table.\n* The upper and lower toolbars have a lot of padding above and below the buttons.  This should be reduced to 1-2 pixels.\n* The \"Hint / Last Edited\" bar should be made optional.  \n** Ideally combine the last saved information to the lower toolbar (maybe just add a simple time in the \"save\" button such as \"Save (8:14a)\"\n** Make the hint info completely optional\n* Give user choice of having small toolbar buttons that take up less space\n* Either give the user or the Space Admin option to customize the buttons that appear in the toolbar\n* Move the lower toolbar into the upper toolbar and change the buttons to standard toolbar buttons w/o labels. \n** If you feel its needed you can still offer a pref to have toolbar buttons shown with text or not.  \n** Some apps have a nice 3rd state which shows text on only the buttons which are really deserving of more than a simple icon.\n\nThe design of the editor as it stands now is form over function!!  I hope that the developers see to making changes to make this app more geared to getting work done efficiently instead of fussing over making sure the UI looks \"pretty\".  \n\nUse case (to demonstrate how the current design impedes):\nAs it stands now, if I'm writing a spec and I paste an screenshot in that is 600 pixels high, I don't have any room to view the image and type about it.  All I need is about 10 lines below the image but now I'm forced to open a new window to preview the image while I type.\n\nbtw: I do like how some of the toolbar buttons where combined into multi-function to save space like having the 'insert' and different html controls under that.",

I could not get this to work at all; nor do I see any current way to get a mentioned by Jira issue link in a Confluence page, it only works the other way round\n- the whole paragraph \"Applinks Plugin\" seems to be outdated; I believe this is the actual Application Link feature; but inserting a Confluence page into a Jira issue via [page name] does not create a hotlink; is this now replaced by remote links?\n- activity streams seem to be combined out of the box on a global level but for the project - space level it seems to be important to link project and space together; this is not mentioned in the two pages",
