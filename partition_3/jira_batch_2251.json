As a workaround, you will need to manually open up access through your firewall system to the atlassian.net domain, while the team at webroot is investigating and updating their systems.\r\n\r\nThere is no current timetable from the webroot team for resolution. We would also recommend you contact webroot (http://www.brightcloud.com/about/contactus.php), or your vendor to alert them to this issue.\r\n\r\nWe will continue to update you on the status of this issue as new information is obtained.\r\n\r\nFeel free to contact support with any questions or concerns at https://support.atlassian.com.\r\n\r\nAtlassian OnDemand Team\r\n{panel}",
