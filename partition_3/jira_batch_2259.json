Atlassian Connect 1.0 [was released in March 2014|http://blogs.atlassian.com/2014/03/introducing-atlassian-connect-1-0/], and you can already get access to [more than 50 public add-ons today built using the platform|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/search?application=&category=&cost=&hosting=cloud&marketingLabel=].\r\n \r\nDue to stability and scalability reasons, we will not bundle additional third party add-ons with our Cloud offerings. But you should feel free to contact the vendors of your favourite add-ons to let them know that you would like them to create a Cloud version of the add-on! We will do our best to work together with the vendor to satisfy this request.\r\n \r\nSince we have no plans to bundle additional add-ons in Cloud, we are closing this issue.\r\n \r\nCheers,\r\nBartek\r\nJIRA Product Management\r\nbartek (at) atlassian (dot) com\r\n{panel}\r\n \r\n \r\n*Original request description:*\r\nThis is a request to include the Go2Group synapseRT plugin found at .https://plugins.atlassian.com/plugins/SYNAPSERT",

Atlassian Connect 1.0 [was released in March 2014|http://blogs.atlassian.com/2014/03/introducing-atlassian-connect-1-0/], and you can already get access to [more than 50 public add-ons today built using the platform|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/search?application=&category=&cost=&hosting=cloud&marketingLabel=].\r\n \r\nDue to stability and scalability reasons, we will not bundle additional third party add-ons with our Cloud offerings. But you should feel free to contact the vendors of your favourite add-ons to let them know that you would like them to create a Cloud version of the add-on! We will do our best to work together with the vendor to satisfy this request.\r\n \r\nSince we have no plans to bundle additional add-ons in Cloud, we are closing this issue.\r\n \r\nCheers,\r\nBartek\r\nJIRA Product Management\r\nbartek (at) atlassian (dot) com\r\n{panel}\r\n \r\n \r\n*Original request description:*\r\nPlease bundle the JIRA to JIRA copy plugin for OnDemand\r\n\r\nhttps://plugins.atlassian.com/plugins/com.atlassian.cpji.cpji-jira-plugin",

There are a few use-cases we can't achieve with JQL today.\n\nWe have upcoming major versions, say 4.8.0, where we track our sprint work. We also may do emergency maintenance releases for critical bug fixes during each sprint. Right now on our rapid board I have one swimlane for sprint work which works well as we do fixVersion in (earliestUnreleasedVersion(DSP), earliestUnreleasedVersion(JSCORE)). This requires the ordering of the version to be very specific in the Manage Versions page.\n\nBut if we have a short term maintenance release, say 4.7.3, there is no easy way to display this in a swimlane. I'm forced to use fixVersion = \"4.7.3\" and each time we release, I have to go in and edit each filter to increment the version number.\n\nIt would great if we could somehow categorize versions, or be able to search against the fixVersion field using contains (~) operator so we could have some extra metadata in each version name like \"4.7.3 (staging)\".",

You may need to open up your firewall to allow incoming requests from Tracker integrations (for example, if you have an internal JIRA instance). If this is needed, ask your network administrator to allow the IP addresses of \"api.pivotaltracker.com\" and \"api2.pivotaltracker.com\". However, please note that the IPs assigned to these addresses may change without notice. You can use the commands host api.pivotaltracker.com and host api2.pivotaltracker.com to confirm the current IP addresses.",

      "description": "Hey guys,\n\nA customer reported this behavior when trying to remove a resolution from his OnDemand instance that seems to be a bug. Here's what I did in order to reproduce it:\n\nI've created a resolution in my own OnDemand instance and resolved an issue with it. Then I tried to remove that resolution. Before deleting it, I was warned that there was one issue resolved that needed to be changed. I changed to \"Fixed\". After pressing \"Delete\" I got the stack trace pasted below.\n\nI went back and re-opened the issue that contained that resolution and resolved it with a different one. Then I tried to remove the resolution that now had 0 issues and it was successful.\n\nSo basically something fails when it needs to bulk change issues, but it works when there is no issue with that resolution.\n\nBest regards,\nRicardo Martins\n\n{noformat}com.atlassian.jira.exception.DataAccessException: Failed to remove resolution with id '7'\n\tat

Atlassian Connect 1.0 [was released in March 2014|http://blogs.atlassian.com/2014/03/introducing-atlassian-connect-1-0/], and you can already get access to [more than 50 public add-ons today built using the platform|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/search?application=&category=&cost=&hosting=cloud&marketingLabel=].\r\n \r\nDue to stability and scalability reasons, we will not bundle additional third party add-ons with our Cloud offerings. But you should feel free to contact the vendors of your favourite add-ons to let them know that you would like them to create a Cloud version of the add-on! We will do our best to work together with the vendor to satisfy this request.\r\n \r\nSince we have no plans to bundle additional add-ons in Cloud, we are closing this issue.\r\n \r\nCheers,\r\nBartek\r\nJIRA Product Management\r\nbartek (at) atlassian (dot) com\r\n{panel}\r\n \r\n \r\n*Original request description:*\r\nI just wanted to put in a request for Netsuite integration for OnDemand.\r\nThis could be accomplished by enabling Customware plugin 5186.\r\nhttps://plugins.atlassian.com/plugin/details/5186\r\n\r\nI notice that the Courseware plugin for Salesforce is one that will work with the hosted solution.",
