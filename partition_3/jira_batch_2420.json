Suggested Solution\nGive an option to Team account which can avoid an accidental change such as:\n\n* a config to restrict adding a non-Team member to Users access\n* a config to enforce specifying access only by Group\n\nh2. Workaround\nDo not to give admin access to an uncontrollable number of people in your team, and make sure to specify access by Team group.\\\\\nBesides, consider adding yourself as a watcher to be kept informed as to the state of this feature request moving forward. With that way, if our development team updates the ticket, you&#x27;ll be notified via email.\n\nh2.

Under such a scenario, either a compromised Docker image or tool executed as part of the build process would attempt to commit back to a repository. Without user vigilance, such a change could go unnoticed.\n\nCurrent mitigations include:\n\n* Applying branch restrictions if there is concern about malicious parties attempting to write back to a repository.\n* Cryptographic verification of untrusted third party tools (e.g verifying SHAs/digests of Docker images).\n* Code review process to ensure untrusted tooling is not introduced into the pipeline.\n\nAs it stands, we would suggest verification of any tooling used in a build, as a poisoned tool can already &#x27;steal&#x27; code, credentials stored in env vars, or write back from any system that has credentials available to do so.\n\nFor future work, we could make the git auth proxy &#x27;opt out&#x27; via a configuration option in the bitbucket-pipelines.yml file.

      "description": "Hello,\n\nThis issue is in regards to the new feature in BP that allows pushes back up to a repository without the need for authentication. I believe this creates a big security hole in what was (before this feature was introduced) a more secure system.\n\nFor example, consider a CI workflow where developers merge in PRs from outside developers. Aside from code reviews (which are subject to human error), there would be nothing stopping a malicious outside developer from writing a script that pushes code back up to the repository. Perhaps this could be prevented by locking down the repository with branch permissions (i.e. only allow code in via a PR merge), but then BP cannot use a bot account to do automated pushes.\n\nIt seems to me that the old system -- base64 encoding an SSH key -- while slightly inconvenient, was very secure. With the new HTTP pushing feature, that security is lost for a minor gain in convenience.\n\nIf I&#x27;m missing something here, I&#x27;d REALLY like to know what, because from my POV this is a big step backwards.\n\nFor reference, please see https://community.atlassian.com/t5/Bitbucket-Pipelines-articles/Pushing-back-to-your-repository/ba-p/958407?utm_campaign=mentions_comment&utm_content=topic&utm_medium=email&utm_source=atlcomm\n\n(I have made several comments in the thread regarding this security hole. In particular, I was requesting further discussion, but got no response. I&#x27;m hoping raising the issue here will help.)\n\nThanks,\n\nRyan",

This is SO DUMB.  It should be trivial for Atlassian&#x27;s two factor authentication to forward something during the Bitbucket loading that let&#x27;s me skip two factor the second time.
