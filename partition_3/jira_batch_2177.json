A feature to export only recently added/edited pages. Some methofd to determine what pages are junk and that can be archived and removed from searches and exports.\n\nGoing through thousands of pages manually and delteing the old/unused pages is an extrmely tedious task.\n\nI Logged this feature request because I was informed (after logging a support request) nothing of the sort is available for Confluence at the moment.\n\n\nKind Regards\nHendrik",

The anchor link will typically be declared above or near the headings on this page. \n\nIf you copy and paste a section that includes a heading, it is likely you have also copied an anchor. To know for sure, you can view the HTML source of the page if you are comfortable doing this. \n\nTo reproduce this bug: \n\n# Open the [attached test.htm|^test.htm] file. It has an invisible anchor markup: <a name=\"heading_1\"></a>. Notice the anchor has a start and end element with an empty body. Also notice it is not an empty element: i.e. <a name=\"Search_options />. Any markup containing an anchor like this can be copied and pasted to reproduce this issue. \n# Now paste into a Confluence page\n# Now save the page\n# You should see the heading text and the text after it rendered as a link (with an underline and blue text)\n\n\n",

Summary\n\nThe table's border become invisible after export to a word file, this issue however does not affect Open Office, it only affects user with Microsoft Office. -Thus, Open office can be used as a workaround.- (Unfortunately, the generated files generally don't open correctly in editors other than MS Office, check this: https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONF-26113).\n\nThere's a similar bug for PDF exports:\nhttps://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONF-34390\n\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\nHere is the reproduction procedure: \n# Add a table with wide columns to a new page then save it. (original.png)\n# Export the page to the a word file. \n# On the word file\n\n\nh3. Expected Results\nThe table fits the file correctly.\n\nh3. Actual Results\nThe border of the table become invisible. (export+to+word.doc)\n\nh3.Workaround\n*Partial workaround*\n# Use workaround [here|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONF-34390] to export a PDF file that shows that table correctly\n# Export as PDF\n# Use some PDF to Word converter, like [this one|https://acrobat.adobe.com/us/en/how-to/pdf-to-word-doc-converter.html]",

This is very problematic if the titles of these long-named inclusion pages only differ towards the end of their titles.\n\nFinding out the full name of an included page now requires manual intervention. In Confluence 3.5, you could simply glance at it in Wiki Markup.\n\nTo work around this visual limitation, I've had to rename all the inclusion pages so I can see them at a glance (to work out whether or not they need revising).\n\nIncidentally, expecting a Confluence 4.0 user to simply view the storage format (i.e. XHTML) to see these page names _is not an acceptable workaround_ - especially if you're not going to provide them with a way to edit this XHTML content (in an indented readable format).\n\n*Suggested Solution:*\n\nExtend the length of the macro (displayed in edit mode) to the full width of the edit box.",

Right now we do this by enclosing the patches as a \\{code} section. It would be ideal if we could have a \\{patch} notation to indicate that the enclose text is a patch and confluence will then color code it as per the patch specifications. This is already being done in some of your products like FishEye. Also this an already available feature in other wiki tools like \"trac\".\n\nI am requesting to have a separate \\{patch} macro. This macro would indicate that the enclose section is a of \"unified diff format\" and should be rendered as a patch with the appropriate color codings. As an example, see this page: [http://trac.edgewall.org/attachment/ticket/1359/trac.patch]\n\nThis page is a trac wiki page and displays a patch to the file \"notify.py\". The color codings on this page makes it obvious of what this page is about and gives details about the patch in a very intuitive way.",
