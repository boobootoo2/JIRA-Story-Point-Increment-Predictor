The problems caused by this are documented here: https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/BSERV-9616\r\n\r\nTo fix the problem described in BSERV-9616, as of Bitbucket Server 5.9.0 the .git/config file that Bitbucket Server writes into its temporary worktree includes the following:\r\n{noformat}\r\n[filter \"lfs\"]\r\n\trequired = false\r\n\tprocess =\r\n\tsmudge = git-lfs smudge --skip\r\n{noformat}\r\nThe intention being, any LFS filter configured in the global Git configuration file is overridden.\r\n\r\n*The Regression*\r\n\r\n\u00a0The above mentioned fix for BSERV-9616 breaks systems in the following state:\r\n * Bitbucket Server 5.9.0 - 5.16\r\n * Git version earlier than 2.11.0 installed\r\n * Git LFS client is NOT installed for the user running the Bitbucket Server instance\r\n\r\nThe problem occurs because Git is trying to run the git-lfs command, it however cannot be found.\r\n\r\n*Workaround*\r\n\r\nUpdate Git on the Bitbucket Server instance to 2.11.0 or later",

      "description": "{panel:title=Atlassian status as of July 2020|borderStyle=solid|borderColor=#deebff|titleBGColor=#deebff|bgColor=#ffffff}\r\nHi,\r\n\r\nI'm excited to share that in Bitbucket Server 7.4 we added more control over who can delete repositories. In Bitbucket Data Center admin can go to _Admin Settings -> Global Permissions -> Policies_ to select\u00a0user roles allowed to delete repositories. By default, any repository can be deleted by repository admin, but often due to security or compliance repository deletion should be allowed only to a group of trusted users.\u00a0\r\n\r\n!deleteRepoPolicy.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nYou can find more information in the Bitbucket Server 7.4\u00a0[release notes|https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/bitbucket-server-7-4-release-notes-1013849643.html] and Policies [documentation|https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/global-permissions-776640369.html].\r\n\r\nI'm not closing the ticket for now. Please, leave you feedback in the comments.\r\n\r\nAnton Genkin\r\n Product Manager Bitbucket Server\r\n{panel}\r\n*Original message*\r\n\r\n_*This is cloned from\u00a0BSERV-3839\u00a0, because I have the same issue and I feel this was not properrly addressed at the time and this is still a current issue with Bitbucket 5.x.*_\r\n\r\n*There was a comment in the original ticket that argued this issue was the same as\u00a0\u00a0STASH-3406, which is clearly _NOT_ the case. The latter ticket deals with permission to _create_ repositories in other projects, whereas this ticket deals with permission to\u00a0_delete_\u00a0repositories in a project.*\r\n\r\n*I would therefore be grateful if you would please review carefully the description of the original ticket below:*\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n {color:#205081}TL;DR allow me to enable a flag \"disallow repository deletion\"\r\n \r\n When I try to delete a repository I get the following message\r\n {color}\r\n{quote}{color:#205081}This cannot be undone. All of the repository's contents will be irretrievably lost if they are not also stored elsewhere. All pull requests to this repository will also be deleted.{color}\r\n{quote}\r\n{color:#205081}\r\n This sounds dangerous and something that you don't want many people to be able to do.\r\n \r\n At the same time we want to allow a user to create new repositories.\r\n \r\n The closest thing I can see is to grant the PROJECT_CREATE permission but not the PROJECT_ADMIN permission. When I tried that it turned out that they automatically get the PROJECT_ADMIN permission on a repository that they just created (and thus permission to delete the repository).\r\n \r\n Please allow an option to prevent a user from having permission to delete a repository.\r\n An option to globally disallow repositories from being deleted would also work.{color}\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n*Looking forward to your answer on this issue,*\r\n\r\n*With best regards.*\r\n\r\n\u00a0",

We want to collect metadata about it to drive our other security tooling such as code analyzers or to send an email to the team when a repository has changed over a given threshold to perform a manual code review.\r\n\r\nTo this end, we need to retrieve the repositories that have changes since the last time our automation run. Currently in the server API we can do this by querying every repository for its commits and comparing the date of that commit with what our tool has in its database. This however is really inefficient since we have too many repositories and the number of API requests required is large.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, to inform the tool so it can select the right tests to run, we need to know which language the repository is written on. For our Github Enterprise instance we get this from the API, and it looks like BB Cloud also supports this, but BB server doesn't. I don't see how we could get this information without cloning the repository and analyzing the files, which would be even more cost prohibitive in terms of API requests and bandwidth.\r\n\r\nIt would be great to have these features in the API.

Explanation\r\nThe guide is given as an example, you may change the command on your end to fit your need. This would require you to change the command in *HTTPS* to *SSH*.\r\n\r\nWhile the \"workaround\" exists this dialogue should be updated with the information on how to do this over SSH as well to minimize confusion.",

That means if add-ons invoke particularly slow/heavy operations on the shared executor, it can block pushes.

By default, the system allows 1 threadpool thread per logical CPU (see [Runtime.availableProcessors()|https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Runtime.html#availableProcessors--]).\r\n\r\n(A note about \"Affects Version/s\".
