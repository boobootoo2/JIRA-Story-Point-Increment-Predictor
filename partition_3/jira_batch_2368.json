Your input in the comments helps us understand how this affects you and what you're hoping to accomplish with Bitbucket Server.\r\n\r\nWe spend a significant amount of time on an ongoing basis to determine our product investments in Bitbucket Server. Unfortunately, we are not currently planning to address this suggestion in the next 12 months. In the last 12 months, we've resolved 10 of the top 30 feature requests, and our upcoming roadmap includes a number of other top voted suggestions, including in-browser editing, improvements to search functionality, better JIRA integration, and providing an even better code review experience.\r\n\r\nI understand that this may be disappointing, but we believe it\u2019s important for us to be open, honest and transparent with our customers. Product feedback is collected from a number of different sources and is evaluated when planning the product roadmap. You can [learn more about our process here|https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/110373/how-does-the-jira-team-use-jira-atlassian-com].\r\n\r\nNorman Ma\r\n\r\nProduct Manager - Bitbucket Server\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\nAs a _way more comfortable and straightforward_ alternative to messing around with {{.mailmap}} files, please add the \"Username aliases\" feature in Stash that's already existing in BitBucket.\r\n\r\nImplement this on a per-repository, per-project as well as system-wide level as well as for users' personal repositories. Providing buttons to move a created alias to either of the other levels could ease management of this a lot.\r\n\r\nThis will also actually extend functionality because right now in 2.12.1, Stash apparently ignores globally configured {{.mailmap}} files \u2013 confirmed by Stash support \u2013 but only cares about {{.mailmap}} files inside repos.\r\n\r\nI personally think it's a very bad idea to mix up code and some configuration that has nothing to do with it, so I'd never commit a {{.mailmap}} file directly into a repository. With a mapping feature built into Stash, the configuration would be separate from the repo files. Also, even if Stash cared about globally-set {{.mailmap}} files, bigger organizations with strict permissions could also profit from this since their server admin no longer needs to fumble around with files directly on the command line every time something needs to be changed but can do it in a few clicks in the interface \u2013 or, with Stash's global/project-level permissions, even delegate that to certain other people.\r\n\r\nThe highest priority should be on the system-level aliases, second come project-level and repository-level aliases, then personal user repositories.\r\n\r\nAs for permissions, this scheme might be a good starting point for brainstorming the perfect solution:\r\n - Repository admins may add, edit and delete aliases set up for their repos\r\n - Project admins may add, edit and delete aliases set up for their projects and any repos in those projects\r\n - Stash admins may add, edit and delete aliases set up globally as well as for any project and any repo inside those\r\n - Moving aliases to a different level is possible whenever the user has the permissions needed to manage aliases on the target level, e.g. project admins may move a repo-level alias inside one of their repos to project-level, but repo admins may not do so.\r\n\r\nFor personal user repositories, maybe have a toggle to switch system-level aliases on/off (in user settings, one toggle for all of the user's repos).",

You can look at the activity stream to get some idea, but if the comment is a response to a previous comment, you basically have to scroll through the entire activity log which can be quite long. \r\n\r\nWe often have pull requests that have 20 or more comments. At this point, it become difficult to keep track of.\r\n\r\nI noticed there is now a count of comments for a pull request. It would be nice if there was a similar count of unread comments and some additional indication of unread comments on maybe the diff tab on a per file basis. This functionality is available in Crucible and our team members are used to having this feature. Not having it in Stash makes it difficult to use and some members are at the point they rather use Crucible for reviews.\r\n\r\nThis feature could probably also be expanded to non-pull request comments too (i.e., commit comments).\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nDave Humeniuk ",

Please consult the [Atlassian Bugfix Policy|https://confluence.atlassian.com/support/atlassian-bug-fixing-policy-201294573.html] for more details.\r\n\r\nWe understand how disappointing this decision may be, but we hope you'll appreciate our transparent approach and communication. If you're really passionate about this suggestion, please comment with your case in detail and we'll reconsider.

If you push it, even if you don't author it, you are considered the owner of the changes. The audit log feature for Stash does allow us to capture this information so we can tie the push of particular commits to the Stash authenticated user. The push events, however are classified as low priority so unless we are missing something, we need to set the audit log level to low. This would then capture many events that we are not interested in. From our standpoint and the need for more stringent audit trails, we feel that push events should be classified at more than a 'low' priority.",

Despite our lack of communication, this problem is actually one of those areas we plan to improve in mid-term.\r\n\r\nThank you again for all your feedback on this suggestion and we're looking forward to give you more updates as we work on the solution.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\n Anton Genkin\u00a0| Bitbucket Product Manager\r\n{panel}\r\n*Original message*\r\n\r\nThe stash pull request diff view (both side-by-side and unified) break page search due to their fancy javascript-based scrolling. Only the visible region (plus a bit extra) of the diff is stored in the DOM, so your browser's search can only find stuff in that visible region. This is premature optimization: A web browser can easily hold the entire DOM tree for the diff between multi-thousand line files.\r\n\r\nRelated to this: a number of our developers have had issues with diffs not scrolling properly.",

Your input in the comments helps us understand how this affects you and what you're hoping to accomplish with Bitbucket Data Center.\r\n\r\nWe spend a significant amount of time determining our product investments in Bitbucket Data Center. Unfortunately, we are not planning to address this suggestion in the next 12 months. In the last year, we have resolved many of the highly voted suggestions like Reviewer groups, Pull request templates, capability to enable/disable source branch deletion on merging pull requests and our upcoming roadmap includes a number of other top voted suggestions, including repository archiving. Check out our [public roadmap|https://www.atlassian.com/roadmap/data-center?product=bitbucket] for more details on the coming soon and future items.\r\n\r\nI understand that this may be disappointing, but it\u2019s important for us to be open, honest, and transparent with our customers. Product feedback is collected from many different sources and is evaluated when planning the product roadmap. You can\u00a0[learn more about our process here|https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/110373/how-does-the-jira-team-use-jira-atlassian-com].\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nImran Khan\r\nProduct Manager - Bitbucket Data Center & Server\r\n{panel}\r\nSome complicated projects are setup across many repositories and it can be both cumbersome and error-inducing to manually submit and merge Pull Requests(PR). Somehow allowing for a single entry point for PRs at a project level would be a huge boon for larger projects.\r\n\r\n-When a PR is created, check to see if PR should also be created in other repositories of project.\r\n-When merging, merge related PRs in project.\r\n\r\nOther systems enforce same branch name for linking PRs together. Obviously only checking for open PRs, not closed, nor merged.",

As the issue hasn't collect votes, watchers, comments, or support cases from many customers during its lifetime, it's very low on our priority list, and will not be fixed in the foreseeable future. That's why we've decided to resolve it as *Timed Out*.\r\n\r\nAlthough we're aware the issue is still important to those of you who were involved in the conversations around it, we want to be clear in managing your expectations. The Bitbucket Server team is focusing on issues that have broad impact and high value, reflected by the number of comments, votes, support cases, and customers interested. Please consult the [Atlassian Bugfix Policy|https://confluence.atlassian.com/support/atlassian-bug-fixing-policy-201294573.html] for more details.\r\n\r\nWe understand how disappointing this decision may be, but we hope you'll appreciate our transparent approach and communication. If you're really passionate about this suggestion, please comment with your case in detail and we'll reconsider. Atlassian will continue to watch this issue for further updates, so please feel free to share your thoughts in the comments.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nImran Khan\r\nProduct Manager - Bitbucket Server and Data Center\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\nCurrently our development team leaders are shunning Access Keys and are using \"users\" in Stash to allow access to outside systems (Bamboo, Fisheye, Wally etc...).\r\n\r\nTheir argument is that by including these users in a \"development-agents\" group in Stash, it makes it much easier to manage the access that these system accounts have. i.e. when you create a new project, just add the \"development-agents\" group as a \"read-only\" user and you are set.\r\n\r\nThe alternative in this situation would be to add each access key with read-only access to the project.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, they point out that in the situation where access needs to be revoked for a particular system account, the user simply needs to be removed from the \"development-agents\" group. Whereas in the case that we had been using \"Access Keys\" we would have to get each Proejct Administrator to remove the access key from the Project and/or repository.\r\n\r\nThis last one is somewhat mitigated with the latest feature in 2.12.1 which shows where an access key is being used, prior to deletion.\r\n\r\nAs such, could you please put in a mechanism to be able to \"group\" access keys, so that they can be more easily managed.",

Your input in the comments helps us understand how this affects you and what you're hoping to accomplish with Bitbucket Data Center.\r\n\r\nWe spend a significant amount of time determining our product investments in Bitbucket Data Center. Unfortunately, we are not planning to address this suggestion in the next 12 months. In the last year, we have resolved many of the highly voted suggestions like Reviewer groups, Pull request templates, capability to enable/disable source branch deletion on merging pull requests and our upcoming roadmap includes a number of other top voted suggestions, including repository archiving. Please check out our [public roadmap|https://www.atlassian.com/roadmap/data-center?product=bitbucket] for more details on the coming soon and future items.\r\n\r\nI understand that this may be disappointing, but it\u2019s important for us to be open, honest, and transparent with our customers. Product feedback is collected from many different sources and is evaluated when planning the product roadmap. You can\u00a0[learn more about our process here|https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/110373/how-does-the-jira-team-use-jira-atlassian-com].\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nImran Khan\r\n\r\nProduct Manager - Bitbucket Data Center & Server\r\n{panel}\r\n*Original request description*\r\n\r\nThis is a follow up to issue -STASH-3314- that was closed. In that issue Jens Schumacher said that the reason why multiline comments were not added is because in Crucible it was very hard to select actual code, with what I agree, but I would like to suggest an improvement.\r\n\r\nWhy not make it that way that when you select code, it regulary selects text as it is now in Stash, but if you would like to leave a comment on multiple lines, you click on the line numbers on the left of the code. This would make it the best of both worlds.",

Or maybe you have incorporated these checks that I do into Stash?)\r\n\r\nIt would be great to see Developer Release Notes for new versions that would mention the breaking API changes.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\nIgor\r\n",

Cause\r\n\r\nThis issue affects all versions of Stash from 2.5.0 through the just released 2.12.0. It is 100% MySQL-specific, and should not affect customers using any other database.\r\n\r\nh4. Solution\r\n\r\nUpgrade to the indicated fix releases.\r\n\r\nh4. Workaround\r\n\r\nExactly because of this issue and [STASH-4701|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/STASH-4701], we recommend that customers with larger instances (you can consider that 500+ licenses) move off MySQL (you can see the warning we placed on [Connecting Stash to MySQL|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/STASH/Connecting+Stash+to+MySQL]). Therefore, if you can move to an alternative database (for example, PostgreSQL) in case you don't want to upgrade now, that'd also solve this issue for you.\r\n\r\nLeaving as-is will cause you performance issues as well as Pull Requests misbehaviour while merging. For instance:\r\n{quote}\r\n(...)the following error more and more frequently when trying to merge a PR from the Stash UI (happening on multiple repos): \"New changes were pushed to master in project/repo while the merge was being performed. Please retry the merge.\"\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nThe good news is that Stash makes it really easy for you to migrate databases. All you have to do is:\r\n\r\n- *Preparation:* configure a PostgreSQL db (it can be any other [supported databases|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/STASH/Supported+platforms]) as described on [Connecting Stash to PostgreSQL|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/STASH/Connecting+Stash+to+PostgreSQL]\r\n- *Migration:* migrate your instance data over to PostgreSQL as described on [Connecting Stash to an external database|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/STASH/Connecting+Stash+to+an+external+database]\r\n{quote}\r\n*To run the Database Migration Wizard:*\r\n\r\n# Log in to Stash.\r\n# In the administration area, click Database (under 'Settings').\r\n# Click Migrate database and follow the instructions for running the migration.\r\n{quote}\r\n",
