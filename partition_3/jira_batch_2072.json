When you click on an event in team calendars the detail box pops up and shows the description and gives you the option to edit the event. Next to the edit link there could be a link that says \"Add to Outlook\" that would export the event into a file and would make it easy to add to the person's personal event. Then we could leverage outlook's reminder functionality and the event will be right in their personal calendar.\n\nThanks for all the hard work and hope this one gets in there!\n-Aaron",

Problem summary\nThere are certain functions in Team Calendars that relies on the Base URL to be set correctly in order to work. If the user connects to Confluence/Team Calendars using a URL that is different from what is set in Confluence Admin > General Configurations > Base URL, some of the functionalities might be broken.\n\nThe problem is that when users run into a base URL mismatch problem, they are not presented with any useful information to hint that the URL is the cause. Consequently, this makes it difficult for administrators to troubleshoot the problem. This improvement request is for Team Calendars to display a more useful error when there's a base URL mismatch.\n\nh3. Examples\nDepending on your Confluence/TC version, you may encounter vague errors such as the ones described in this KB:\nhttps://confluence.atlassian.com/display/CONFKB/Team+Calendars+Shows+Nondescript+Error+Box+or+%27No+Transport%27+Error\n\nIf you are using Team Calendars 4 or above, and have integrated with JIRA, trying to add JIRA events with a mismatched base URL will result in the necessary JIRA fields not showing up. Clicking \"OK\" also will do nothing. Compare the following screenshots for details:\n* When the correct base URL is used: [^righturl.png]\n* When the wrong base URL is used: [^wrongurl.png]",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFSERVER-50259].\n  {panel}\n\nCurrent behavior of Team Calendar when displaying the {{List View}} is as follow:\n* Take today as 10th Feb 2014\n* List View will display events from this date up to the next 30 days which will be until 11th Mar 2014. So on and so forth.\n* Refer to {{teamcalendar_current.png}} for more details\n\nThis might be quite confusing for customer whenever they wanted to view events only from current month since it will include the events from the following month.\n\nCustomer proposes an improvement request as follows:\n* Take today as 10 Feb 2014\n* List View should display event for the whole February instead. E.g. 1st - 28th Feb 2014.\n* Past events between 1st to 9th Feb 2014 should be greyed out to show that they are already passed.\n* Refer to {{teamcalendar_proposed.png}} for more details\n\nPlease assess the possibility to implement this on the Team Calendar's List View.\n\nThank you and regards,\nLazuardi",

We cannot get user buy-in when the supporting documentation is \nseemingly half finished.\n______________\n\nAdditional information: I am really disappointed in the quality of the Team Calendars user documentation and find it exasperating to only ever find clear answers by trawling through other users comments to establish the full limits and limitations of Team Calendars.\n\nA couple of examples: \n\n1. The only way I ever found out that you could not change colours of events / have multiple different events split by colour was from other user experiences.. Sadly this is one of many similar situations I have faced and ultimately is seen as a blocker for expanding team calendar usage across my organisation. \n\n2. The inherent difficulty in working with calendars is well known however as a user who may be looking to purchase your product I would hope that there would be more information relating to Subscribing to and Exporting team calendars. Not every confluence user is a master of this and the existing information on the following pages is not enough. Nothing is ever mentioned about receiving notifications in Outlook for upcoming events or what happens if I change my event in Team Calendars (or Outlook) - is it auto updated in the other tool? Basically, simple functional information is missing or at least highly unclear.\n\nThe product is not your average plugin (content and price wise) but a lot more than that and it deserves the right level of accompanying user documentation",

We think it makes more sense if only the people that have delete permission on the page would have the permission to delete responses. Only the \"Space Admins\" and \"Confluence Admins\" keep the \"Remove pages\" permission in our Confluence instance and we would like to keep the same permission for deleting the responses for events as well. Just our feedback. No big deal if you guys don't agree:)\n\nThanks\nAdhip",

Currently, if you make any mistake ( by accident), the only way to change that is to delete the response and add another response. This is not a huge deal to do but we thought having the edit option to correct your response sounds more reasonable. Only the responder should have that option though not everyone.\n\nThanks\nAdhip",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFSERVER-50214].\n  {panel}\n\nIn evaluating Team Calendars for our confluence instance I was very excited to see the option to import JIRA versions into the calendar. I even found a reference to this feature in another improvement  https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/TEAMCAL-417 however, when I tied it out it did not work for me.\n\nWhat I want to do is using the \"Start Date\" and \"Release Date\" in jira for versions have that show up as a range bar in Team Calendars. Today only the Release Date shows up. \n\nI was told that this can be done via Agile which I tested and found it could do this. In addition to that I found that creating a custom issue type can do the same. However, I pefer and I think it is beneficial to users if there was only one place in JIRA to update a versions dates. In both the Agile and the issue type workaround a user would have to update the dates in more then one location. If this feature were implemented not only would users not \"have to\" buy Agile but it can be administered in one location in JIRA.\n\nIt seem fairly straight forward that the fields are in JIRA already and the functionality of Team Calendars is there but the option to put these together is lacking.",

If the release has already passed, this wording doesn't make sense:\n!http://cl.ly/image/2b09182s2n1P/Image%202013.11.04%208%3A48%3A06%20AM.png!\n because the release has already shipped.\n\nCan I suggest the following:\n1. If the release is coming up (the current date < release date) the wording stays the same as what it is today\n2. If the release date has passed and the version is not released, we keep the same wording\n3. If the date has passed AND the version is released - we change the wording to be the date by it'self. So \"Due 3 days ago\" changes to \"12 Aug, 2013\" \n\nWe already have knowledge if a version has been released or not because we show a different icon if it is released\n",

And so I have to edit the event again. That is really a bad behaviour for end user \n\n*Actual*\n* add texts here\n\n*Expected*\n* We should have a checkbox like \"Only update the fields I edit\".

Team Calendars almost fits the bill but there are a couple of things missing:\n\n1.  If a team member is double booked in two calendars, there should be an alert about it either to change the schedule or ignore.\n2.  The ability to dynamically create calendar views based on previously created calendars.  For example:  if a team member has personal schedule which outlines his or her week and where they're going to be, then it would be great if an entire department schedule could be dynamically created from the various members who are going to be working in a particular department on a particular day.  Kind of like a \"view\" in a relational database.  As a non-profit organization in which the members wear many hats over the course of a week, this is a real challenge to schedule and thus far we haven't found any software which can do this, but Confluence by nature seems like it could do this very well if the time was put into it.",
