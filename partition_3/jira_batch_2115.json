Summary\nIn-line Comments and Resolved Comments are imported with a Space Export, but throw a 500 error when the REST call is made for rendering the Page. This has been replicated with space exports from Confluence Cloud and Confluence Server.\n\nh3. Environment\n* Confluence Cloud\n* Confluence Server 5.7, 5.8.18 or 5.9.4.\n* The Space has Resolved in-line comments\n\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\n# Go to a Space and a Page within that Space. Add two in-line comments and resolve one of them.\n# Do a full XML export of the Space\n# Import the Space export into a new instance (either same version or same major version)\n# Notice the import completes successfully, but the in-line and resolved comments are not displayed even though they are present in the {{entities.xml}} file and database.\n\nh3. Expected Results\nIn-line comments are displayed.\n\nh3. Actual Results\nThe in-line comments are imported into the database, however the {{user_key}} is not mapped correctly from the old instance to the new instance. \n\nh3. Workaround\n{color:red}SQL manipulation in the database is not supported.

Steps to Reproduce\n# Delete the service-desk-agents group in user management\n# Create a new user in user management\n# Give the new user Confluence Application Access\n# Log into Confluence as new user\n\nh3. Expected Results\nUser can login and use confluence\n\nh3.

Different R&D groups are expressing interested in using Confluence.  We are curious about best practices, advise, or considerations that Atlassian support can offer as we look into expanding usage of confluence.  For example:\n\n* How does having multiple confluence instances plugged into one JIRA instance impact usability?  Administration? Performance?\n* Is there some limit that is recommended?  \n* Are there best practices for organizing spaces or handling administration for a large organization that might be available for us to consider?\n* Are there licensing cost implications for various instances?\n\nI look forward to feedback.  We have a few meetings planned in the next couple weeks and this input will be important for our discussion.\n\nThanks,\nLinda",

Problem Definition\n\nLooking for a way to show the Parent Space of a Page when a user is Mentioned on the Page or when it is Shared with them.\n\nIn the current Email Notification:\nThe Subject indicates that User Mentioned or Shared a Page with You\nThe Body contains the Page's title (which is clickable) \nThere is no indication of where this Page exists within Confluence\n\nAn email received from a Comment or a Page Edit shows a Breadcrumb in the Email Subject:\n{noformat} [Confluence] Parent Space > Page{noformat}\n\nh3. Suggested Solution\n \nWould like to see a Breadcrumb of where this Page exists within a Space\n-Also allow an Admin the ability to customize the Email Notifications sent to their Users through the Web Console-\nThere is an unsupported option to Edit the Confluence Mail Templates however it requires File System Access (unavailable to Cloud Customers).\n\nh3. Workaround \nServer Only  - [Customizing the Email Templates|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Customising+the+eMail+Templates]",

Feature Summary\n\nSupport Asciidoctor-backed AsciiDoc in:\n\n* the WYSIWYG editor,\n* through Stash (see https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/STASH-4769)\n* through the API directly. \n\nThe unicorns and rainbows solution I'm looking for here is to:\n\n* Write my docs in AsciiDoc\n* Version Control docs files in Stash\n* Push directly to a confluence node using a \"Publish\" button. (OH YEAH)\n\nBut I'd honestly just settle for native AsciiDoc (Asciidoctor tooling) support in Stash and the API so I can push easily.\n\nh2. Challenge\n\nFor me, the way I\"m using the Atlassian solution suite is using Stash and AsciiDoc together with Confluence to achieve that elusive writing Zen. That, and I want to single-source my content as much as possible for reuse among the documents I'm writing, and then push the end result to Confluence as a static page.  \n\nThe problem is my Zen is being interrupted when I try to push AsciiDoc into Confluence.\n\nIn short: I can't. :(\n\nh2. Attempted Workarounds\n\nAs there is no support natively at the moment, I need to use 3rd party Ruby tools to attempt to push content in, but these tools are not really working out (due to enhancements required to these tools - bugs raised).\n\nWhen that fails, I need to transform my AsciiDoc files using Asciidoctor and then try to push the HTML directly into the code view of the Editing Window. The problem with that is due to the admonition macros and other rich content stuff Confluence uses, the beautiful Foundation styles and eye-pleasing Admonition blocks are changed to the Confluence style, and look amateurish. Which makes me look amateurish as a Technical Writer.\n\nOne of my DevOps guys has offered to create a buildbox that houses all the Ruby stuff I need to push static HTML into Confluence and listens on Stash Commit Hooks, but that seems overly complex when it would be better to just support AsciiDoc alongside Markdown.\n\nh2. Final Summary\n\nMost professional TechComms professionals will tell you that separating content from presentation is the way to writing Zen. Probe Technical Writers further and they'll probably start talking about ways they use a VCS to control their documentation and manage content reuse.\n\nAsciiDoc is the type of language that Tech Writers use when they are faced with creating complex douments. Many Markdown syntax items (such as admonitions) are a kludge-fest to get working compared to AsciiDoc, and having to do this make Tech Writers stabby and makes their teeth itch.\n\nPlease, help Tech Writers work efficiently and effectively using the Atlassian stack of products in a writing language that supports their advanced writing needs.",

During the configuration, admin has lock himself/herself out in the screen and received this error message:\n!after-move-JIRA-directory-to-the-top-order.png|thumbnail!\n\nBy lock out, I meant quite literally shutting the door behind you with the key inside. That can happen easily. In the [documentation|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Connecting+to+Crowd+or+JIRA+for+User+Management#ConnectingtoCrowdorJIRAforUserManagement-ConnectingConfluencetoJIRAforUserManagement], there is no instruction regarding creating {{confluence-administrators}} group in JIRA as a first step. \n\nSo, once connected and positioned at the top of the directory list, no-one will have access to confluence any longer - not even the default administrator account. The default administrator account is called admin. An account by the same name also exists in JIRA, but that account is not in the {{confluence-administrators}}} group either. Hence you managed to lock yourself out.\n\nAnother thing, after log out and login, the admin user do not have {{confluence-administrator}} permission.\n\n*Workaround*\nFollow this [guideline|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Restore+Passwords+To+Recover+Admin+User+Rights#RestorePasswordsToRecoverAdminUserRights-Step3.PuttheInternalDirectoryinFirstPosition] or upgrade Confluence to 5.8.8 version.\n\n*Suggestions*\n\nUpdate the documentation and teach user to used the right steps.",

You need to actually \"click\" insert for the anchor link to properly save. However this seems inefficient and I think most average users would have an expectation to be able to create the link successfully simply by typing the anchor name and then hitting the enter key on their keyboard as it is faster to do this as well.\n\nThanks,\nJade (ex-employee)",

Currently, there is no easy way to inactivate users in bulk within the the user interface of Confluence. The only methods to do this are through the SOAP API through add-ons such as [Confluence CLI|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/org.swift.confluence.cli] or non-marketplace solutions such as [Bulk disable users for JIRA and Confluence|http://www.tieto.com/industries/telecom/tietos-solutions-network-equipment-providers/tietos-solutions-network-equipment-providers-rd-efficiency-excellence/development-platform-service/atlassian-services/atlassian-plugins] which are not Confluence Admin-friendly, but rather require some additional efforts to run correctly, and are prone to error by a Confluence Admin.\n\nThe pain point here is that many Premier clients who previously had *unlimited* licenses are now having to police their licensing to fit within the Data Center licensing limits, some are struggling to inactivate thousands of users and other objects which were sync'd across through LDAP sync and now count against their Datacenter license count. \n\nWhen moving from 10000 users down to 2000 users, a manual solution is not effective at inactivating users (one at a time). Having to buy a third-party add-on to then spend more money to get to Datacenter with fewer users is a hard sell to a client that is intending to expand their use of Confluence and makes the process painful and should be addressed as this is a major blocker on upgrade and expansion of Data Center.\n\nIf we offered a method to paginate through users and set them to inactive through a checkbox on the UI, we could help alleviate the pain of the migration",

Summary\nIn Confluence Cloud, when a *JIRA Issues Macro* is used to add an issue in JIRA, the description field is not being rendered properly. As per the documentation on *[JIRA Issues Macro|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/ConfCloud/JIRA+Issues+Macro]*:\n\nbq. Formatted fields from JIRA can be displayed in Confluence if you set up a Confluence-to-JIRA application link. Otherwise, such formatted fields will be escaped within the output of the JIRA issues macro.\n\nIf the instance has both JIRA and Confluence, the application links are set by default.\n\nh3. Steps to reproduce:\n# Check the *Application Links* between JIRA and Confluence to make sure they are correctly set\n# Create a new page in Confluence\n# Fill in the header of the page with the title\n# In the table enter several example lines in a table as below\n# Save the page\n# Highlight the first *Summary* entry in the table and click the *Create JIRA issue* symbol above the highlighted words\n# At the pop-up, select a _Project_ and _Issue Type_.\n# Click the suggestion (i) to _Create 2 issues from this table_\n# Click *Create*\n\n{panel:title=Test Table}\n|| Summary || Description || \n| Test abc | Test description\n* aaa\n* bbb\n* ccc\n* ddd |\n| Test abc2 | Test description\n* aaa2\n* bbb2\n* ccc2\n* ddd2 |\n{panel}\n\nExpected Behaviour:\nFor the *Description* field in the created JIRA Issues to be rendered properly, in this case with bullet points.\n\nCurrent Behaviour:\n*Description* field data will all be in one line without bullets\n\nh3. *Workaround*\nManually edit the *Description* field to reflect the formatting.

Problem\nAdministrators sometimes need to [rebuild the ancestor table|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Rebuilding+the+Ancestor+Table]. This process has no progress report on the UI, moreover by default it does not log anything.\n\nThis is problematic, as in many cases the reverse-proxy used in front of Confluence will timeout the client request, however this does not terminate the java thread processing the rebuild. So problems to tackle here:\n- Progress bar on the admin UI to report the status \n-- Preferably putting the task as a one-time scheduled job, so that if the proxy times out, the status can still be monitored\n- Log the start and the end of the process\n-- Consider logging the percentage of the progress\n\nh4. Workaround\n- You can [enable debug logging|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Configuring+Logging] for the class {{com.atlassian.confluence.pages.ancestors}}, which then will show the progress with the following format: {noformat}\n2015-08-14 10:27:12,883 DEBUG [http-nio-8090-exec-1] [confluence.admin.actions.ConfigureLog4jAction] add New logger [ com.atlassian.confluence.pages.ancestors ] saved\n2015-08-14 10:27:30,997 INFO [http-nio-8090-exec-9] [confluence.pages.ancestors.HibernatePageAncestorManager] clearAncestorsCollectionCache Clearing ancestors cache ...\n2015-08-14 10:27:30,998 INFO [http-nio-8090-exec-9] [confluence.pages.ancestors.HibernatePageAncestorManager] clearAncestorsCollectionCache Ancestors cache cleared.\n2015-08-14 10:27:31,000 INFO [http-nio-8090-exec-9] [confluence.pages.ancestors.HibernatePageAncestorManager] rebuild updating Learn the wonders of autoconvert (step 7 of 9)[98305] (1/9)\n2015-08-14 10:27:31,001 INFO [http-nio-8090-exec-9] [confluence.pages.ancestors.HibernatePageAncestorManager] rebuild updating Lay out your page (step 6 of 9)[98306] (2/9)\n2015-08-14 10:27:31,001 INFO [http-nio-8090-exec-9] [confluence.pages.ancestors.HibernatePageAncestorManager] rebuild updating Prettify the page with an image (step 4 of 9)[98307] (3/9)\n2015-08-14 10:27:31,002 INFO [http-nio-8090-exec-9] [confluence.pages.ancestors.HibernatePageAncestorManager] rebuild updating Tell people what you think in a comment (step 8 of 9)[98308] (4/9)\n2015-08-14 10:27:31,002 INFO [http-nio-8090-exec-9] [confluence.pages.ancestors.HibernatePageAncestorManager] rebuild updating Get serious with a table (step 5 of 9)[98309] (5/9)\n2015-08-14 10:27:31,002 INFO [http-nio-8090-exec-9] [confluence.pages.ancestors.HibernatePageAncestorManager] rebuild updating What is Confluence?

Improvement\nLock the top bar (also incorrectly - in Confluence parlance - referred to by users as menu bar or navigation bar or header) for continuous access to menus, navigation buttons, search field, etc.\nh3. Current Status\nThe top bar is not fixed and thus menus, navigation buttons, etc. are no longer immediately accessible when vertically scrolling to read content. \nh3. Use Case\nIf I am reading a comment and want to view another page (either simultaneously in another window or separately in another tab) +without losing my current place+, I need direct and constant access to the top bar. Otherwise, by scrolling up or using shortcuts to access the top navigation bar, my current location in the page is lost and I must scroll down again to the previous location.\n*Typical example:*\nWhile reading the comments on a page, you find one that you are sure was discussed in a meeting, the notes of which are in another Space. The _Home_ or _Pos1_ key will generally take you back to the top of a page, while the shortcut _GG_ puts the focus in the search field. Unfortunately, all of these cause you to lose your position on the current page. As such, you can not use the top bar components (buttons, search field, etc) to open another browser tab/window without losing the current page position. This is particularly inconvenient for quickly viewing two or more Confluence pages simultaneously.\nh3. Related Cases\n[CONF-38219] addresses the same issue, but was ambiguously described and taken to be a suggestion for creating a special page template.\n[JRA-27758]\nJRA-21963\n",

Perhaps the lines would be visible only when the comment box gets moused over.\nAs comments are mapped at the paragraph level, and as a single paragraph may have multiple comments, this scheme may get tangled quickly\n\nAn alternative would be:\n* _Based on the fact that the (very) pale blue megaphone icon indicates a paragraph has a comment associated with it._\n* each comment box has some unique identifier at its top, say, a serial (index) number.   The # would be displayed about as visibly as the commenter's name.\n* either overlay the (very) pale blue megaphone with the comment identifier, or, display the comment identifier associated with the  (v)PBM _when it gets moused-over.)\n\nHere's my use case:\n* I'm commenting on a document.\n* A lot.\n* I made a long comment at para. 5.\n* Then I made comments at paras 6, 8, & 9.   Strangely, the para 5 comment continues to float below (further down the page) as I create these new comments, getting further & further away from its home paragraph.\n* I edited the para 5 comment to note that it relates to para 5.\n* After the change to the para 5 comment, *_it_* now aligns with para 5.   The para 6, 8, & 9 comments, however, remain _above_ the para 5 comment, so now _they_ are super displaced from their relevant texts.\nI'm hoping this comment disordering issue has already been addressed.\nThe issue of easily associating comments with their paragraphs remains, and is particularly painful when many comments are present.\n\nI'm working in Firefox, and I've saved the page in .maff, mhtml and \"as complete webpage\" formats.   I will attach 1 or all to this ticket, in case it might benefit you.  That's why I'm indicating \"Security Level\" != \"None\"",
