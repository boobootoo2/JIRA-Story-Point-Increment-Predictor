[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFSERVER-27130].\n  {panel}\n\nOne of the most powerful aspects of Confluence is its email notification of new and changed content. This topic has been discussed in Confluence forums since at least 2006, but no significant action has been taken by Atlassian except for renaming the \"Minor change\" box to \"Notify watchers.\" I still haven't seen any posting that summarizes the issues as my wiki users and I see them. Since this is the \"Ask a question\" forum, mine is: what is it going to take for Atlassian to address this very long standing issue?\n\nThe problem is that users receive too many email notifications that most people consider unhelpful at best and very annoying at worst. The control mechanisms currently available in Confluence are inadequate to control sending email notifications, and \"watch\" options available to users can not make up for this deficiency.\n\nWe can divide actions and content into new, edited and removed pages, comments, news, and attachments as summarized below:\n\n\nContent Type\tNew\tEdited\tRemoved\nPage\t-\tX\t-\nComment\t-\t-\t-\nNews/blog\t-\t-\t-\nAttachment\t-\t-\t-\n\n\nThe X shows the only option, as far as I can tell, for preventing sending email notifications.\n\nPer this chart, email notifications are automatically sent out for ALL combinations EXCEPT for edited pages based on whether users check the \"Notify watchers\" option box. This same box could easily be made available for editing comments and blog entries and adding or removing attachments. (Searching Confluence forums for \"minor change\" provides several conversations on this matter back at least to 2006.) \n\nWe find particularly annoying email notifications resulting from removing or moving content. As administrator, I have removed pages, comments, and attachments as inappropriate or obsolete and have almost certainly not wanted to bring attention to that removed content. I also move pages, frequently to archival folders, and the only way to prevent email alerting messages from blasting users is to turn off the email function as an administrator. Using WebDAV to move or remove entries generates email blizzards.\n\nWe also believe email notifications about attachments (added, moved, or removed) to be of very low value. Attachments are almost always supporting or described by the page content itself which will be the subject of its own email notification.\n\nMy users and I believe it is past time for Atlassian to provide users and administrators better control in Confluence over sending these email notifications. This includes, but is not limited to, improving the \"Notify watchers\" option with clear option buttons or similar mechanisms as discussed in other forum entries.\n\nI look forward to elaboration of this issue by other users and action by Atlassian on this matter.",

Because this encoding is reversible, a page's content ID can be found directly from the link by Confluence without a database lookup.\n\nUnfortunately the (fairly common) scenario of migrating from self-hosted Confluence to Confluence OnDemand requires space imports, which means all content gets new IDs. This invalidates the 'tiny' part of all the tiny links someone may have used in other systems to link to their wiki content. If they had used non-tiny links, they could simply change the base URL part of the links, but now even that will not be sufficient to get the old links working again.\n\nThis is a missed opportunity to make tiny links resilient. The tiny part of the link should be hashed and stored in the database in such a way that it comes across with a space import.",

For Adhoc Workflows Tasks it is only occasionally that we would want to prevent a user from completing a task without being on the page the task is created in.  i.e some users use tasks for compliance reasons etc that wouldn't be happy if users can complete without viewing the page.  For approvals however most use cases would expect that a user is on the page that requires approval. Hence being able to stop the linked task from being completed from within workbox would allow us to show a user all their items in a single place, but enforce navigating to the page to complete/remove the items from the list. \n\nIf you are a plugin developer and you've got other use cases, please comment on this issue and let us know!",

That is an expected behaviour. In fact, it's always the _best practice_ to shutdown an application the database is connected to before creating backup/dump to guarantee it's data consistency and/or integrity.\n\nApparently, we didn't warn this in our documentation, particularly this page: https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Production+Backup+Strategy\n\nI've just did a quick edit [here|https://confluence.atlassian.com/pages/diffpages.action?pageId=38797389&originalId=308609383]. Please feel free to review and edit it.\n\nThis issue is a request to do the same change in the previous Confluence version spaces as they're locked for editing. I think we only need to do it for version 3.4 - 4.3 (CONF34 to CONF43 Spaces) as 3.3 and lower are already EOL-ed, but I'll leave it that to you guys.",
