Problem Definition\n\nCurrently, iPython notebooks can be converted to HTML and subsequently copied/pasted as source into the Editor, but images break on Preview and Save.  \n\nh3. Suggested Solution\n \nProvide a macro that would  render code and markdown found in iPython notebooks. The code snippets would also be numbered as they are in iPython notebooks.\n\nh3. Workaround \n# Create a html folder in your <confluence-install>\\confluence folder.\n# Convert the iPython notebook to HTML and save the file to the <confluence-install>\\confluence folder. \n# Create a Confluence page and insert a HTML macro.\n# Use an iFrame to display to the notebook, by using something like:{code}\n<iframe src=\"http://localhost:8541/confluence/html/example notebook.html\" width=\"800\" height=\"500\"></iframe>{code}\n\n*or* \n\nUse the 3rd party plugin: https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/ch.mibex.confluence.ipython-notebook (only available for Confluence Cloud).

Problem Definition\nCurrently, if you try to add more than 20 labels at a time in Confluence, you get an error there is a limit. There's no way to change the limit for administrators, and the error simply wipes the list of labels already entered.\nThis makes it difficult for users that now need to re-enter all of the labels.\n\n!Screen Shot 2015-10-30 at 12.00.21.jpg!\n!Screen Shot 2015-10-30 at 12.00.25.jpg!\n\nh3. Suggested Solution\n* Change Confluence so that there is no limit\n* Provide admins a way to change the limit\n* Save the current labels entered so when an error occurs, the user still has a chance to remove extra labels and not have to type them all over again.\n \nh3. Workaround \nEnter only 20 labels at a time.",

The indicator needs to be visible at all times, irrespective of my cursor position on the page.\n\nScenario: Quite often the user comes back to edit a confluence page after a time gap (say after lunch, or logging onto your machine first thing in the morning), and continues to edit a confluence page that was left in edit mode, there is no indicator to tell whether or not the user is still logged in to Confluence. Its only when the user hits \"Save\" button that the notification message is presented, prompting to log-in again... thereby losing the changes. This is a frustrating user experience.\n\nSuggestion: Have a floating \"Login-status indicator\" that turns red or green based on the current log-in status. In case of an inactivity-time-out when the user is logged out by default, turn the indicator red so the user is signalled to log-in again before continuing to edit.",

[See the corresponding bug report|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFSERVER-39681].\n  {panel}\n\nViewing a page with more than 16 independent JIRA table macros can cause Confluence Cloud to not respond for two minutes, due to database connection contention/starvation. This is due to changes in the macro deployed on 26 Oct, which load tables of JIRA issues via AJAX rather than including them in the page rendering.\n\nh3. Steps to reproduce\n\n# Set up an instance (e.g. Cloud) with 16 database connections, and at least 50 HTTP threads.\n# Create a page with 16+ JIRA table macros, all with different data\n# View the page\n# The page will load, but subsequent requests will not load until the JIRA macros time out after 2 minutes. A thread dump taken on the instance will show the \"Jira macros executor\" threads blocked waiting for a database connection:\n\n{noformat}\nJira macros executor:thread-1\" #163 daemon prio=5 os_prio=0 tid=0x0e5fd800 nid=0x338c in Object.wait() [0x2a388000]\n   java.lang.Thread.State: TIMED_WAITING (on object monitor)\n\tat java.lang.Object.wait(Native Method)\n\tat org.apache.tomcat.dbcp.pool.impl.GenericObjectPool.borrowObject(GenericObjectPool.java:1123)\n\t- locked <0x861964a0> (a org.apache.tomcat.dbcp.pool.impl.GenericObjectPool$Latch)\n{noformat}\n\nIn the situation where all the database connections are currently leased out to request threads, all JIRA table AJAX requests block on the JIRA macro executor threads which are blocked waiting for a database connection. The result is database connection starvation for all requests until the macro executor thread times out (2 minutes).\n\nh3. Workarounds\n\nThere are two possible workarounds, which can be and have been implemented by our support team upon request:\n\n# Disable the JIRA macro\n# Change the HTTP/database connection pool sizes from 200/16 to 16/24 and restart the instance.\n\nOver the last week, Atlassian has been proactively monitoring customer logs for any instances of the problem and applying the workaround #2 to these customer instances.\n\nh3. Fix\n\nThe Atlassian team is currently rolling out a fix to Confluence Cloud. The fix consists of an updated version of the JIRA macro that reverts the new AJAX functionality and therefore does not exhibit this problem. This rollout will be completed on Wed 4 Nov 2015, with a short outage for Confluence at the appropriate maintenance time for each geo.\n\nNote that prior to 26 Oct, this macro often resulted in individual page timeouts on pages containing 10+ JIRA macros, and this less-than-ideal behaviour will reoccur after the macro is reverted. However, these timeouts only affected individual pages and not other requests to the system.\n\nIf you continue to experience problems with the JIRA macro or pages timing out in your instance, please [raise a support case|https://support.atlassian.com] and we will investigate further.\n\nh3. Support notes\n\nSupport team, for proper problem diagnosis, please capture:\n\n* thread dumps while the instance is non-responsive, and\n* the content of affected pages.\n\nIf the problem is caused by this bug, the thread dump will show the JIRA macro processing threads blocked as described above. Other problems can exhibit the same symptoms of non-responsiveness, and it's important that we get the thread dump so we can fix all the root causes that result in this outcome.",

Problem Definition\nThe current bundled Java version has a bug that will always fail to make a connection when trying to use Secure LDAP,  [JDK-8135194|https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8135194]. \n\nSpecifically, the way Socket.createSocket() is used results in an SSLSocket without the hostname set in it.  This results in use of an IP address to make the connection and since this is no longer allowed the connection fails.  We have reported this problem to Oracle and also forwarded the information to the Java security dev list: http://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/security-dev/2015-September/012845.html .\n\nBecause of this _*existing LDAPS connections are broken*_ and users from that user directory are unable to login including non-local administrators.\n\nThis will affect any customer using secure LDAP that upgrades the JVM.  Secure LDAP is very common to protect passwords on the internal network, particularly in enterprise environments.  This is exacerbated by Confluence 5.8.8 which ships with Java 1.8.0u51.\n\nh3. Suggested Resolution\nBundle Java 8u65 with Confluence installer versions.",

However, when editing a wiki page on Confluence, these keyboard shortcuts are overridden to apply different formatting rules. (This is grief-inducing.)\n\nAfter accidentally hitting Cmd-1 and applying the wrong formatting to a newly-typed line of text, if I press Cmd-Z to undo that formatting change, it will actually undo the text entry. So I then have to either manually adjust the formatting myself or retype the line. (This is immensely frustrating, even more so than the Cmd-1 override itself.)\n\nAccording to your priority definitions this is \"minor\", but it's such an annoyance that it makes me really _hate_ editing Confluence pages, even though I love the rest of the software.",

Problem\nThe use case is that there are multiple (and typically large) code blocks inside the expand macro. Since all of the code blocks aren't needed to be seen, the user typically has the collapsible code block inside of the expand macro. Apparently this setup used to work at some point, but the macro hasn't been behaving properly.\n\nSo the end goal is to have an expand macros, with multiple collapsible code blocks nested inside of it. The expected behavior is that a user can expand the expand macro, then expand a code block that is listed under it and see the information in that code block. \n\nThe current behavior is that a user expands the expand macro, then clicks to expand a code block. Immediately after clicking the option to expand the code block, the expand macro automatically collapses itself. This causes the user to have to re-expand it to try to see the code block. Then, if they need to click on another code block, the expand macro auto collapses itself again. The cycle is then repeated.\n\nPreviously, this functionality worked within the macro, not sure why the regression has occurred (post upgrade from 5.4.4 to 5.8.13).\n\nh5. Workaround\nWorkaround exists to have the user nest an expand macro inside another expand macro and put the non-expandable code macro inside of the second level of expand macro. This does what the user is trying to do, but given that in the past the code macro inside of the expand macro did work.",

Each individual user can, however, decide to use the  \u201cShow changed content\u201d email notification setting and hence cause a security breach. Disabling the email notifications altogether would obviously be a quick remedy but the email notification feature as such is needed in order to maximise the flexibility of the offered communication alternatives.\n\nSuggested solutions:\n1.) The admin should have the option to disable the \u201cShow changed content\u201d-setting in the email notification settings of all users and - should someone already have set it to \"on\" - reset the selection to \u201coff\u201d for all users. The default value of the  \u201cShow changed content\u201d-setting should be \u201coff\u201d, when new users are created.\n\n2.) The ability to have page content sent by email could be limited on the space level or on the page level:\nOn space level:\n- an additional choice could be added to space properties for indicating if sending of any page content within that space should be inhibited\nOn page level:\n- a certain label could be defined in the general settings (per default e.g. \u201csensitive-no-email\u201d), which could then be used on pages, the content of which should not be sent per mail (default e.g. \u201csensitive_no_email\u201d). The existence of this label would cause the email notification logic to omit the page content from the sent mail, replacing it with a notification text like \u201csensitive page content was omitted from this message\u201d\n",

Now, I understand the creator of the page may have changed his setting to not allow others to delete the attachments. But, for the attachments that I own. I would like to have a feature to be able to perform a delete.\n\nThis is fairly challenging feature request. Please try to implement it. \n\nThanks,\nRohit",

In my opinion communication is much more important than knowing that some random page has changed. If someone wanted to share some new knowledge, or some procedure has changed, I'd expect him/her to communicate that, in some blog post, or a comment at the least. I am not going to do a revision comparison on each page that was changed to find out such hidden messages.\n\nSo can there be more focus on communication ((micro)blog posts and comments) on the dashboard? I would appreciate a Google+ or Facebook-ish feed very much.\n\nI know about HipChat, but it seems not organized in conversations/threads (only in rooms), and it seems more about instant communication than about reading and responding when you have time.\n\nIf something like this is already available (for example as an add-on) for Cloud, then I'd be very interested to hear. 'Blue, enterprise social network' seems interesting but it's not available for Cloud so haven't even had a chance to evaluate it.",

If you put a link to a page inside a space that you do not have the *view* permissions, it will be redirected to a \"Page not Found\" message. If the user does not have the permissions to view the space, the links will still be displayed and once you click, a page not found. \n\nThis is a request to change the documentation or check if this is a bug that can be fixed in the system. \n\nHowever, this could be also a request to remove this function from the system, if it was supposed to be implemented. The reason would be that removing/hiding links could affect on the proposal of the page. \n\nFor example, if the link is tied to a word in a text, if it would not be displayed for the user, it could affect on reading the text, once it would be missing some words. It could be kept only for direct links, in example, only pasting the page URL to a page without having it tied to a word. :)",

Currently, I can usually do this by surrounding the content to be floated with a pair of HTML macros (one with something like <div style=\"float:right; max-width:30%\"> and the other with the closing </div>), but that's a somewhat clunky workaround, especially for several cases on the same page.  Having a couple of properties (float, max-width) directly on the panel/toc/info/etc. macros would be much simpler and less cluttered.  (E.g., \\{info:float=right|max-width=30%\\}.)\r\n\r\nAnd, no, using columns is not an acceptable workaround (no wrapping).",

[See the corresponding bug report|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFSERVER-39542].\n  {panel}\n\nThis was the post I wanted to add: \n\"Question:\nHow do I assign a ticket based on the reporter and custom user picker field?\n\nWe use JIRA issues to request any change to a user's account (new users, dept. transfers, etc.) . One of the fields required is a user picker field for the user's manager. Sometimes the manager himself will put in a ticket or someone will put the ticket in on his behalf. The goal is to auto assign the issue to IT if the reporter is equal to the user selected in the Manager user picker field, but the issue should be assigned to the user in the Manager field for issue approval if the reporter isn't the manager. I'm not sure how to accomplish this.\nIn a nutshell:\n1-Reporter creates a User Account ticket and fills in all fields, including the user's manager\n2 - a. Assign to IT if the reporter = user's manager\n     b. Assign to user's manager if the reporter is someone different so that the manager can approve the request\nAny advice on this?\"",
