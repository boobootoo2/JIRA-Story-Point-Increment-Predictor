Prior to today it seemed like the average startup time was around 8 or 9 seconds.  Currently the startup time over 60 seconds which is a 750%+ increase.  This increase in startup time is not specific to a single repository and happens on new pipelines as well as other pipeline builds that have previously run successfully.  The same Cassandra image version is being used between prior working builds and current slow builds.  Multiple coworkers at my company are reporting the same issue.\n\nIf there are no changes to the repository, build pipeline, or images, this seems like it might be a symptom of another issue.\n\n*Steps to reproduce:*\n\n# Define the Cassandra service in one of your build steps\n# Monitor the \"cassandra\" tab and watch the timestamps as Cassandra is starting up\n\n*Expected result:*\n\nThe Cassandra service should setup in a relatively predictable amount of time between builds (not varying by 750%+).",

I got it caching but then as I kept tweaking the Dockerfile, I noticed it stopped caching. First I checked locally with docker on my mac (fairly recent version of docker) that:\n\n* if I built twice in a row, the second run found cache for all layers\n* if I built once, then modified some file in our source tree, the cache was invalidated at the correct step (the on that adds most of the source)\n\nI then confirmed that if I rebuilt my branch with that dockerfile multiple times in pipelines that it wasn&#x27;t using cache. It showed that it was downloading the cache during the \"Build setup\" phase but then at the end it didn&#x27;t upload any new  cache and the layers were all rebuilt.\n\nI then deleted the Docker cache in the web UI:\n\n!2382649172-Screen%20Shot%202018-06-01%20at%2010.53.55%20AM.png|thumbnail!\n\nThen I ran the build twice again and it cached properly.\n\nSo it appears that the docker cache is very static -- that is, it isn&#x27;t extracting all layers built by the current run of docker build and _adding_ them to the existing cache. It only uploads any cache for future use if there was no cache to start.\n\nIs this a correct description of how caching works? If so, is there any plan to fix this? That is not how docker caches when you run your own build server with its own docker daemon.\n\nThe major issue here is if a developer modifies the Dockerfile (even adding comments to a line can invalidate a step!) then the cache becomes useless, extending our build time. Not all developers are going to remember to go delete the cache manually when they merge such changes to master.",

However, we have some issues with it.\n\nh1. Issues\n# *[Repositories can&#x27;t be in more than one project|https://community.atlassian.com/t5/Bitbucket-questions/Can-a-repository-belong-to-multiple-projects/qaq-p/356072].*\n\n## *Suggestion:* allow repos to be in multiple projects.\n## *Usecase:* we are migrating our CI over to bitbucket pipelines. It&#x27;d be great to have a projects to track all repos that don&#x27;t have bitbucket pipelines. That way it&#x27;d be easy to track our progress and see what repos still need to be updated. However, that would mean we can&#x27;t have those repos be in any other project, which is an issue for us since we already use projects to group certain types of repo together, for example, all of our puppet repos are grouped together in a project.\n# *You can&#x27;t remove a repository from a project without deleting it or moving it to a different project.*\n\n## *Suggestion:* allow repos to be removed from projects and exist outside any project\n## *Usecase:* human error. I&#x27;ve added repos to a project on error, only to find I can&#x27;t undo that mistake. I can only move the repo to another project or delete the repo. There are some repos that just don&#x27;t belong in any project. It should be possible to remove them from a project without deleting them.\n# *You can&#x27;t delete a project without deleting or moving all the repositories it contains.*\n\n## *Suggestion:* allow projects to be deleted or archived without moving or deleting every repo in the project\n## *Usecase:* In some cases a project can be completely finished but the repos should still exist after the project is completed. For example. maybe your org needs to do a large scale audit of every repo that has a production instance. It would make sense to group them together using a project. You could argue that you could add the repos at the start and remove them one by one as you go through the audit. However, if there is a final sign off stage by higher management, as there usually is with audits, it&#x27;d make sense to leave all repos in the project until that sign off has been done, and then delete the project but *not the repos* once the process is complete.\n\nI know this seems like a lot of requests, but I think all of these could be satisfied with minimal changes, by making it so that projects contain links to repos, rather than direct copyies.\n\nThanks for reading.",

If I adjust its {{font-size}} to 14px, it looks the same size  as the normal text.\n\nOn Chrome 66 on the same OS, rendering appears closer to what macOS Firefox does, which has the text all approximately the same size.\n\nDespite being in the minority, it seems like Firefox/Linux&#x27;s behavior is actually correct, in that it&#x27;s displaying 12px text as smaller than 14px...",

It mostly works well, but there are some improvements to be made as detailed in other issues that have already been logged.\n\nWe also use HipChat on every project, and it&#x27;s Bitbucket integration.\n\nThe problem is now that we use Deployments & Environments, the HipChat notifications are a lot less useful:\n\n!4000589152-HipChat.png|thumbnail!\n\nSure we can see master branch building, but there&#x27;s no context about which environment we&#x27;re building to.\n\nThis wasn&#x27;t a problem before Deployments arrived, as we used distinct branches for each environment and just merged code from branch to branch:\n\n!1038992819-HipChat2.png|thumbnail!\n\nAs you can see, this was far more useful.\n\nSo, please add to the HipChat integration so that it tells use which Deployments are running & which Environments are being built to. Thanks!",

      "description": "Hi,\n\nThere is a bug that occurs with third-party applications if a user had had an application installed before, then revoked the access to it, and then install the application again.\n\nActually, I am from the StiltSoft team. We are an Atlassian Marketplace vendor and developer of the [File Viewer|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1214164/file-viewer-for-bitbucket-cloud%3Fhosting%3Dcloud%26tab%3Doverview] add-on. The following are steps on how to reproduce the problem based on the example of this add-on:\n\n* Install the File Viewer for Bitbucket Cloud add-on (Account settings - Find integrations).\n* Open a [page|https://bitbucket.org/alexkuznetsov/demo-repo/src/dc6e80a236914c055173498a44d9e9c6f5baf642/csv/%3Fat%3Dmaster] with a file to open it via File Viewer. You will be prompted to grant access to your repositories for the add-on: !334733767-bb2.png|thumbnail!\n* Go to the OAuth page (Account settings - OAuth).\n* There is a record in the table that the add-on has been authorized to interact with my repositories: !206699593-bb1.png|thumbnail!\n* Click the Revoke link in the table and uninstall the add-on.\n* There is no record in the table.\n* Install File Viewer again.\n* Open a page with a file to open it via File Viewer. The \"Grant access\" dialog will not open. You cannot see the file on the page. There will be an &#x27;Access denied&#x27; exception: !756283572-bb3.png|thumbnail!\n* Go to the OAuth page. There will not be any mention of the add-on\n\nThe only way to fix it is to make a HTTP request at this URL (in a separate tab, for instance):\\\\\nhttps://bitbucket.org/site/oauth2/authorize?client_id={client-id}&response_type=token.\n\nWe are using [AP.request API|https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/bitbucket/jsapi/request/] which is part of [Bitbucket Cloud JavaScript API|https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/bitbucket/about-the-javascript-api/]\n\nI would expect AP.request to detect revoked token and I will be shown the \"Grant access\" dialog in which I can authorize the application for using my repositories.\n\nHere is our initial request to Bitbucket Cloud Support https://getsupport.atlassian.com/servicedesk/customer/portal/11/BBS-78600\n\nBest regards,\\\\\nDmitry Zagorovsky",
