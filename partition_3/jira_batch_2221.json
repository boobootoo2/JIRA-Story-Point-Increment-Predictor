Example:\r\n\r\n{code:xml}\r\n<methodContext name=\"trivial\" regexp=\".*\" maxStatements=\"1\"/>\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nHowever, customer reported a problem that it excludes methods containing inline classes, for instance:\r\n\r\n{code:java}\r\n// the getListener() method has only one statement: \"return <object>;\"\r\n// if you use <methodContext name=\"trivial\" regexp=\".*\" maxStatements=\"1\">\r\n// then the whole code block will be filtered-out, including the actionPerformed() method\r\nActionListener getListener() {\r\n   return new ActionListener() {\r\n       public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {\r\n           System.out.println(\"statement #1\");\r\n           System.out.println(\"statement #2\");\r\n       }\r\n   }; \r\n}\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nIn the case above ActionListener() is an inner class so it has their own metrics. And because of fact that context filters are \"cumulative\" (so that whenever any code pattern is matched, then the whole block is excluded), the whole getListener() method is filtered-out, including inner class.\r\n\r\n*Solution:*\r\n\r\nWe cannot change existing metrics (without breaking backward compatibility) and we cannot change the way how blocks are excluded (it would make no sense). But we can create new metrics called: cumulativeComplexity and cumulativeStatements. It would work as follows:\r\n\r\n * for every interface, class, enum or method find all inner classes, interfaces, enums or methods (*)\r\n ** this can be checked by matching occupied code regions (on a database level during metric calculation - preferred) or during instrumentation (code parser)\r\n * calculate cumulativeComplexity and cumulativeStatements by adding cumulative value from all inner objects to current entity complexity/statements value\r\n * add maxCumulativeComplexity / maxCumulativeStatments to Ant clover-setup/clover-instr and Maven clover2:setup / clover2:instr goals\r\n ** html reports would probably remain unchanged (just grey-out)\r\n\r\n(*) yes we should make code more flexible in order to make it ready to support code constructs like default methods in Java8 interfaces or Scala's functions inside functions etc \r\n",

Currently it always runs all tests. \r\n\r\n*Tricky part in Ant:*\r\n\r\n1) Ant <junit><batchtest> batchtest collects the included resources from any number of nested Resource Collections. It then generates a test class name for each resource that ends in .java or .class. It means that *.groovy files will be ignored. However, we could use *.class files, for example:\r\n\r\n{code:xml}\r\n<fileset dir=\"${build.dir}\">\r\n    <include name=\"**/*Test.class\"/>\r\n</fileset>\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nThen we can run both groovy and java unit tests from Ant. \r\n\r\n2) But then if we try to use *.class inclusion pattern with <clover-optimized-testset>, for instance:\r\n\r\n{code:xml}\r\n<clover-optimized-testset>\r\n    <fileset dir=\"${build.dir}\">\r\n        <include name=\"**/*Test.class\"/>\r\n    </fileset>\r\n</clover-optimized-testset>\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nthen Clover (BaseCloverOptimizedTestSelector + BaseCloverOptimizedType) will try to \"guess\" source file name by renaming Foo.class to Foo.java. As a consequence it is unable to find Foo.groovy file...\r\n\r\n*Tricky part in Maven:*\r\n\r\nt.b.d.\r\n\r\n*Tricky part with TestSuites:*\r\n\r\nKnown problem. Clover does not optimize TestSuites.

However, design decisions are not only about \"Do we want to have this feature?\" but also \"Is this a best feature we can implement using our available resources?\". We want to invest our time in making your lives (and code!) better. The fact that Google are building their Android IDE based on IntelliJ IDEA, which has a built-in coverage tool, means that you can measure code coverage for your Android apps, in an environment supported by Google. Therefore, we decided to not implement Clover for Android in the near future. Beginning of Clover 4.1 release, we will remove all documentation related to Clover for Android prototype and close the related issues.\r\n{panel}\r\n",

Possible implementation:\r\n\r\n1) for static fields (class scope)\r\n\r\nAll static fields are being initialized when class is loaded by classloader.

By clicking \"Flatten packages\" we can see statistics for a package without subpackages. See idea1.png. \r\n\r\nIn HTML report we can see aggregated coverage only for the whole project. When we click on a certain package, we see statistics gathered only from classes from given package and not its subpackages. See html1.png and html2.png.\r\n\r\nThe expected behaviour is as follows:\r\n\r\n1) When we click on the \"Coverage\" link in top-left frame in HTML report, the functionality shall be as it is now. I.e. it should open in the right (main) frame a list of packages, a statistics panel in the top-right corner will show stats for whole project, clicking on a package on the list will open a package details frame with stats in top-right corner for the package only.\r\n\r\n2) When we click on the \"Coverage (Aggregate)\" link in top-left frame, it will open in right frame list of package and a statistics panel for whole project (as it is now). But when user clicks on a package from list it will open a different package details frame with aggregated stats in top-right corner for the package and all subpackages.\r\n\r\n3) A stats panel \r\n  for option 1 shall have a label like \"Statistics for package (without subpackages) <package name>\" and \r\n  for option 2 like \"Statistics for package (with subpackages) <package name>\"\r\n\r\n4) A stats panel should have a link \"show with subpackages\" / \"show without subpackages\" for easy switch between reports.\r\n\r\nSee html3.png\r\n\r\n\r\n*Update:*\r\n\r\nIn new HTML report introduced in Clover 4, a package-level page could look this way:\r\n\r\n[^clover4-adg-package.png]\r\n\r\nso that toggle buttons would be similar to those a project-level page:\r\n\r\n[^clover4-adg-project.png]\r\n\r\n",

      "description": "The various filtering options (statement contexts, method contexts, exclusions, etc) do not seem to be applied consistently across the various clover2 maven goals: clover2:clover, clover2:check: clover2:log.  The discrepancies between clover2:clover and clover2:check essentially render clover2:check useless as it cannot be relied upon for accurate threshold reporting.\r\n\r\nThe attached maven project demonstrates the following use cases:\r\n1. A method covered by tests\r\n2. A method not covered by tests\r\n3. A property method excluded via the property method context\r\n4. A constructor method excluded via the constructor method context\r\n5. A method filtered using a custom method context\r\n6. A statement filtered using a custom statement context\r\n7. A file filtered using the \"exclusion\" configuration option\r\n\r\nIn order to execute the example, unzip the attached zip file and run the following:\r\n\r\nmvn clean clover2:setup test clover2:aggregate clover2:clover clover2:check clover2:log\r\n\r\nThings to note:\r\n\r\nClover2:clover generates correctly.  Coverage is at 50% and 71.4% of the code is correctly filtered out.  \r\n\r\nClover2:check reports coverage at 66.7%.  Now in this case clover2:check is reporting coverage higher than clover2:clover.  I'm not sure how it's getting there, but in my production examples the opposite tends to be the case:  clover2:check reports lower coverage than clover2:clover.\r\n\r\nClover2:log reports coverage at 33.3%:\r\n\r\n[INFO] Clover Coverage Report\r\nCoverage Timestamp: Fri Mar 02 12:26:09 EST 2012\r\n\r\nCoverage Overview -\r\nCoverage:-\r\n      Methods: 2/7 (28.6%)\r\n   Statements: 4/12 (33.3%)\r\n     Branches: 1/2 (50%)\r\n        Total: 33.3%\r\nComplexity:-\r\n   Avg Method: 1.1428572\r\n      Density: 0.6666667\r\n        Total: 8\r\n\r\nIf I change my maven execution to the following:\r\n\r\nmvn clean clover2:instrument test clover2:aggregate clover2:clover clover2:check clover2:log\r\n\r\nwhere clover2:setup is swapped out for clover2:instrument, the coverage check matches the report: 50%.\r\n\r\nAs you can see, none of these tools seems to be reporting the same thing.  You might say \"Leo, why not use clover2:instrument so at least clover2:clover and clover:2check\" match?  Well, there's a problem with clover2:instrument as well:  http://forums.atlassian.com/thread.jspa?threadID=22387\r\n\r\nI've been using clover for some time now (~5+ years).  Your main competitive advantage over the other guys (jacoco, cobertura, emma, etc) is your advanced filtering and reporting capabilities.  The frustrating thing is that in these 5 years none of these features have ever seemed to work consistently across maven goals nor in integration with other tools like STS and Sonar.\r\n\r\nPlease make it a priority to ensure that these features are enabled consistently and tested for as part of every release.  You know, ensure you have proper code coverage on your code coverage product.  :P\r\n\r\nPlease feel free to integrate my example project into your automated regression suite!\r\n\r\nThanks!",
