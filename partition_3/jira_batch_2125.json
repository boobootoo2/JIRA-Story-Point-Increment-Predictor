I want to return content from pages by using CQL parameters. This would be useful.\n\nYou could match on labels, creation time, space, attachments, whether it has children, etc.\n\nYou could match on some of the attributes here:\nhttps://developer.atlassian.com/static/javadoc/confluence/latest/reference/com/atlassian/confluence/pages/Page.html\n\n\nI ran into the need when I wanted to include all of the pages of the children of a parent essentially the cross between the page include and the children include macros. However there were so many pages it would be very tedious to do so with page includes.\n\n I started writing a macro for it, but I don't think we should need to make our own macros to do something so simple.  The Macro I was writing nearly works, but it doesn't include the macros that are on the pages of the children, so all panels and other stuff are lost essentially.\n\nEven that however, was a workaround for what I really needed.\n\nWhat I really needed was to include the content of all children of a certain parents who matched a certain creation date. So I could have 1 dynamic page, whose content changed day to day based on which pages matched the creation date parameters. A shift log that would always have content from  a time-span of 24-0 hours ago.\n\nNow if CQL worked with the page include macro, then that would solve my issue. ",

Unlike Jira or Crowd, Confluence will not prompt any warning to the user if the chosen database contains any contents in it.

Please see that ticket instead.\n\nWe found out that some of our Confluence pages have \"unknown attachments\". There are multiple pages that shows \"unknown attachments\". \nHere are some details:\n- Attachment images are still there and can be viewed in some pages, but some other page attachments are gone and also not visible in the page.\n- This is not true for all. Some pages have no attachment images at all, but the images are visible with in the page.\n- Workaround is to re-add the attachment image to the macro but since we don't know how many pages are effected, it would be better if there is a fix to apply.\n- We are not sure if it is caused by moving pages within or another space, but this issue is now found in many other spaces.\n\nConfluence version: 5.4.4\n\n*Note* This issue was resolved in favour of CONF-41067, which has much more clarity.

In the release version you added a set of new events, fired by Backbone, which gives us a chance to fix the layout - Thank you! \n\nBut events are sometimes lazy and inline styles aren't such a good way - so I just like to ask you, if it's possible to change this implementation in using a css class on the body like \"has-inline-comments-panel\" or something else, where the padding is connected to. \n\nThis will make the integration of the inline commenting more easy. \n\nThank you \nOliver Straesser\n\n[1] https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/net.getunik.confluence.skin.core\n\n\n",

Those requirements have linked issues such as Stories, describing different scenarios to be implemented, and Testcases whereby the for implementation is to be tested. From what I gather trying out the macro, and searching the web, there is no way to differentiate between different kind of links in the column for that or am I missing something?\n\nAlso, see attached screenshot..\n\nThe ideal thing would be to be able to split the links into one column showing the Stories and another showing Testcases. As of now is is a mixture of different kind of links whereby the user has to open the linked issues in order to find out wether it is a Testcase or a Story.
