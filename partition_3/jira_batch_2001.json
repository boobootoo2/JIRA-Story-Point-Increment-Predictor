Issue Summary\r\nIn Confluence, the user can work with the ability to assign tasks to different users by using the *action item/task* function, so the same triggers a notification that a task has been assigned to the user.

Steps to Reproduce\r\n(info) Prior to starting the steps, make sure that existing action items/tasks are already associated with users, so it can be displayed on the Task Report macro.\r\n \r\n# Create/edit a page using any editor version.\r\n# On the page, add the *Task report* macro.\r\n# Configure the parameters to make sure that valid tasks will be displayed on the page.\r\n# Publish the page\r\n\r\nh3.

Thank you for your feedback on resizing images by pixel in the new editor. The new editor optimizes for making sure images look good on all screen sizes, but your feedback helping us understand that the current resizing options may not provide enough flexibility for content creation. As a result, we are going to evaluate your feature request and consider enhancing the resizing options for images.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, here's how you can resize images in the product today:\r\n\r\nAfter adding an image to your page, its starting width is the same as the content area.\u00a0\r\n\r\nTo resize an image,\u00a0\r\n # Select it. Image handles will appear on each side.\r\n # Hover over a handle, select it, and drag it out from the middle or in toward the center to change the image size.\u00a0\r\n\r\nImages snap to the grid that appears offering you eight image sizes providing a responsive experience for page viewers regardless of device.\r\n\r\nThanks again for your feedback,\u00a0\r\n\r\nSam\u00a0\u00a0\r\n{panel}\r\n{panel:title=Status Update 13 March 2020\u00a0}\r\nAs we're working through this feature and others, we wanted to address a lot of your concerns as to the future of the new editor and legacy editor.\r\n\r\nPlease read our recent community post here: [https://community.atlassian.com/t5/Confluence-Cloud-articles/Change-to-your-content-is-in-your-hands/ba-p/1324476]\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n Avinoam\r\n{panel}\r\nh3. Description\r\n\r\nResizing images by pixel has been removed in the new editor. There are many times when precision documentation calls for precise image sizes, down to the pixel.\u00a0\r\n\r\nAdditionally:\u00a0The TinyMCE editor allowed to scale images to a percentage of their size.\r\n\r\n\u00a0",

There is already a user-level config you can set to default new pages to be full-width\r\n\r\nYou can update it under the user settings.

For these users, they would prefer that new pages default to the full-width rather than the fixed width format.\r\n\r\nFor this, I would like to propose either a global or space setting that will default the new blank pages to using the full width rather than the current default fixed width. This would allow the users to choose a default that is sensible for them.",

      "description": "h3. Issue Summary\r\nSince August 8th, a specific onboarding/walkthrough is being launched for users. It seems that it happens one time only. It will consist of three purple pop-ups, having the first one like the example below:\r\n\r\n !walkthrough.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nHowever, under a specific condition, if the user access the page by using an external link (e.g. a linked page in a Jira case, or, a page shared through email) and the same is under a large page tree (that avoids the *Pages* part to be displayed on the sidebar), the pop-ups for the onboarding will not be displayed and the content will be all greyed out, without giving the users an option to proceed or close it to continue editing pages.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Have a new user to be tested in order to trigger the walkthrough\r\n# Make sure to share a page located inside a sidebar with a large number of pages, so it will not have the *Pages* part displayed on the beginning of the page tree in the sidebar.\r\n# Have the user accessing the link and being redirected to Confluence.\r\n\r\n(!) As an important detail, only one customer mentioned about accessing through external sources, while the others confirmed that it is simply happening by trying to access pages. Both or only a single condition from these ones might be causing it.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nThe walkthrough pop-ups should be displayed.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nThe screen gets greyed out and a highlight in the *Pages* part is displayed in the middle of the sidebar.\r\n\r\nh3. Notes\r\n\r\n* The issue is not reproducible if you access the pages normally, or, a short page tree in the sidebar.\r\n* The issue does not happen again if the user has already gone through the walkthrough. A feature flag might be needed to reproduce it.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\nHave the user manually accessing Confluence's dashboard (https://instance.atlassian.net/wiki) and then, go through a page in order to trigger the walkthrough/onboarding and finish it.
