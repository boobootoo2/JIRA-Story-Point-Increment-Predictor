      "description": "It is currently a bit of a hassle to switch which Repository you are in. For example, to switch from one to another, a user must click on the bitbucket home page,, then the repositories button, and then the repository that they want to switch to. When viewing one of the pages for a Repository, Bitbucket should (ex: https://bitbucket.org/[group]/[repository]/[src, pull-requests, etc]/) allow the user to easily switch the repository they are in by turning the button in the top left of the screen (that shows the Repository&#x27;s Icon and Name) into a quick select (dropdown/type-ahead) that displays all of the repositories that the logged in user has access to.\n\nSelecting one of the other Repos would take that user to the same page that they are on of corresponding repository. So, for example, if the user is in Repo1&#x27;s Pull Requests page and they switch to Repo2 using this new feature, they would be taken to the Pull Requests page of Repo2. For simplicity, if they were viewing a page that only exists on that repo, take them to  a base page (ex: They&#x27;re viewing a PR and switch, just take them to the list of PRs for the other repo) or just the {{/src}} page. To maintain some of the functionality of the Repository button currently has, clicking on the icon could take the user back to the {{[repo]/src}} page.\n\nAttached is a picture of the current button that would be turned into the Repo Selector.",

However, the only existing issues I can find that sound similar are to do with multistage builds. The build is failing some time after the {{apt-get autoremove}} in the following:\r\n{code:java}\r\n# Copy requirements in\r\nCOPY ./requirements.txt /app/\r\nCOPY requirements/ /app/requirements/\r\n\r\nWORKDIR /app\r\n# Install dependencies and requirements\r\n\r\nRUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y pkg-config git build-essential python-dev \\\r\n&& pip install --upgrade pip \\\r\n&& pip install --upgrade setuptools \\\r\n&& pip install -r requirements/server.txt \\\r\n&& rm -rf requirements/dependencies \\\r\n&& apt-get remove -y build-essential git pkg-config \\\r\n&& apt-get autoremove -y \\\r\n&& rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*\r\n\r\n# Copy the rest of the app\r\nCOPY . /app/\r\n\r\n# Custom system config\r\nCOPY server/ /\r\n{code}\r\n\u00a0\r\n----\r\n*(on)\u00a0Additional Information*\r\n\r\nIdentifying the right owner of the file/folders being exchanged between Docker containers that result in the error \"Container ID cannot be mapped to a host ID\" during a pipeline run?\r\n{panel}\r\n(i)\u00a0This is important in resolving related issues, as once the file(s)/folder(s) are identified. Their ownership can be changed to 'root' in order to avoid the resulting error.\r\n\r\nExample error: _\"Container ID 165569 cannot be mapped to a host ID_\" we can make an initial conclusion that the container ID\u00a0*165569*\u00a0is unable to map with the host ID. It is important to get the right user ID on the host\u00a0container from the child container ID\u00a0*165569*\u00a0pointing to. Steps below help to find the same:\r\n----\r\nDocker user namespace configurations are stored within the following two files '/etc/subuid' and '/etc/subgid', which looks as follows on Bitbucket Pipelines:\r\n{code:java}\r\npipelines:100000:65536\r\n{code}\r\nFor instance, with \"*pipelines:100000:65536*\" it means that user\u00a0*pipelines*\u00a0can use 65536 user ids starting at 100000.\u00a0Now a user ID 165569\u00a0on a host container would refer to\u00a0*165569 - (100000+65536) = 33*\r\n\r\nAfter getting the host user ID, you can use the following command to find all the files that belong to it:\r\n{code:java}\r\nRUN find / -uid 33 -ls\r\n{code}\r\nIdeally, for a multi-stage build and DinD setup, the easiest trick to make everything working is by changing the ownership of the folder to\u00a0*root*\u00a0that is failing to get copied to the child container:\r\n{code:java}\r\nchown -R root:root file/folder{code}\r\n{panel}",

On 27th September 2018, we rolled out a change to enable user namespace remapping in our docker in docker daemon we provide to users as part of a steps execution to harden the security of pipelines.\n\n\nhttps://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/infrastructure-changes-in-bitbucket-pipelines-872135046.html\n\nThe first thing to mention is that we were not aware of this change, it just happened and broke our code pipelines for several projects.\n\nWe&#x27;re using {{docker run [...]}} and mounting volumes because we want to maintain a consistent way to build our code. [Ideally the same way a developer builds the code in their laptop is the same way we build in CI.|https://medium.com/magnetcoop/using-docker-compose-in-bitbucket-pipelines-81ead8cf0153]\n\nFor that we&#x27;re also using custom [caches for maven|https://medium.com/magnetcoop/caching-dependencies-in-bitbucket-pipelines-when-running-a-dockerized-build-44c66732597d] artifacts.\n\nWith the new changes related to user namespace remapping the custom cache setup broke. A container spawned from a {{docker run}} command in a step can write to the _host_ folder, but when you enable the custom cache definition it breaks due to permissions.\n\nYou can find the minimum failing test case in this repository:\n\n* https://bitbucket.org/magnet-coop/pipeline-cache-debug\n\nYou&#x27;ll find a successful build (just pulling the deps and printing the owner and content of the cached dependencies) on build number [14|https://bitbucket.org/magnet-coop/pipeline-cache-debug/addon/pipelines/home#%21/results/14].

NPM for example, when something fails gives you the following message (copied from a failed pipeline)\n\n{code}\nnpm ERR! A complete log of this run can be found in:\nnpm ERR!     /root/.npm/_logs/2018-10-09T07_52_02_345Z-debug.log\n{code}\n\nIt will be extremely valuable to read those logs and see the actual source of the problem with great detail.\n\nI understand that supporting all the build tools on the market is an impossible task, so maybe you could accept this information on {{bitbucket-pipelines.yml}} file.\n\nThanks and regards.",
