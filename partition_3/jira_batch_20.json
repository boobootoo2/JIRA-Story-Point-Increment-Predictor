I think that having the most appropriate action hidden under the Actions menu is a usability issue, and my suggestion for improving usability would be to either replace the Merge button with a highlighted Continue Rebase button, or have a new button in the same the same menu bar that only exists during a rebase.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nAlso, a button to Abort a rebase would be good. Aborting a rebase is conceptually different from Discard, especially when autostash is in use.\u00a0 Discard means to remove all working copy modifications, while rebase abort with autostash restores working copy modifications (to the state it was in before rebase was attempted)\r\n\r\n\u00a0",

Recently, SourceTree will not authenticate correctly with GitHub. Although my GitHub credentials are saved in the SourceTree authentication settings, whenever I try to push to or pull from a GitHub repository, a \"GitHub Login\" window appears and asks me to enter my username and password. Even if I type the information correctly, SourceTree displays an error:\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n{noformat}\r\nfatal: HttpRequestException encountered.\r\n An error occurred while sending the request.\r\nremote: Invalid username or password.\r\n{noformat}\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nHowever, I can log into GitHub using the same username and password in a browser. If I try to push or pull using the Git terminal, it shows the \"{color:#333333}GitHub Login{color}\" dialog and fails when I enter my information. Then it asks for a username in the terminal, then displays an OpenSSH password prompt. After I enter my password in the OpenSSH prompt, it does connect successfully. However, this approach only works in the terminal, and SourceTree does not detect changes made from the terminal - so if I push or pull, SourceTree doesn't realize it.\r\n\r\nI have tried deleting my saved GitHub account information from SourceTree. I can remove GitHub from the sections \"Accounts\" and \"Git Saved Paswords\". However, once I remove GitHub from \"Git Saved Passwords\", it appears under \"Rest Saved Passwords\" and cannot be removed.\r\n\r\nI've tried re-adding GitHub using both OAuth and Basic auth, and in both cases SourceTree reports \"Authentication OK\" from the settings dialog, but my issue persists - SourceTree always shows me the login prompt when I try to push or pull and always says that I typed in the password incorrectly even when I type it in correctly.\r\n\r\nAgain, I can log in through the browser or through Git terminal; I haven't forgotten my password and don't have trouble typing it in correctly.\r\n\r\n\u00a0",

Go to Working Copy on the left panel\r\n 2. From the top left drop down select \"All files\"\r\n 3. In the Unstaged files, select one file\r\n 4. On the top right panel, search for a file that doesn't match the file selected at step 3\r\n 5. Select a file from the search result and right click it\r\n *Problem:* \"Log Selected\" and other options related to individual files are grayed out\r\n 6. Clear the search and you will observe that both files selected (individually) at steps 3 and 5 are selected together\r\n\r\n*Conclusion:*\r\n It seems that when making a search, the previous selection is still kept in the background (probably the non-matching files are hidden but their select attribute is not cleared).\r\n This means that when right clicking, you will see only options valid for a multiple file selection, even though in the view there is only one file selected.",
