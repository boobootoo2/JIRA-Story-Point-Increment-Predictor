According to\u00a0[https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=829224]\u00a0and\u00a0[https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=826615], this bug is resolved in Chrome 67.0.3387.0. Target stable release for Chrome 67 is May 29 ([https://www.chromium.org/developers/calendar]).\r\n\r\nWe have confirmed the bug is fixed in current [Canary|https://www.google.co.jp/chrome/browser/canary.html] version (67.0.3390.0).\r\n{panel}\r\nh3. Summary\r\n\r\nJapanese IME normally enters multiple letter combination entry state to express consonant+vowel letter such as \"k\" + \"i\" = \"\u304d\", however the first consonant letter ( \"k\", in this example) is auto-committed in the Confluence editor, so the Japanese IME cannot enter the combination entry.\r\n\r\n !First consonant letter auto-committed on Japanese IME.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\nh3. Environment\r\n\r\nClient that runs the browser is\r\n * Windows and macOS\r\n * Chrome (Tested with ver. 65.0.3325.162)\r\n * Microsoft IME (Japanese) , Google Japanese IME, and Mac IME (Japanese)  (This means this occurs in any IME.)\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Create a blank page and add elements as below.\r\n # Add a table.\r\n # Set IME to Japanese.\r\n # Type two letters in a cell (Consonant + Vowel)\r\n e.g.) Type \"k\"(Consonant) + \"i\"(Vowel).\r\n # Type No.4 letters again in a cell next to the No.4 cell\r\n e.g.) Type \"k\"(Consonant) + \"i\"(Vowel).\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\n\"k\" + \"i\" should be always converted to \"\u304d\". (\"ki\" = \"\u304d\" in Japanese)\r\n[Firefox.mov|https://jira.atlassian.com/secure/attachment/311190/Firefox.mov]\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\n\"k\" + \"i\" becomes \"k\u3044\". The initial consonant letter is auto-committed. (\"i\" = \"\u3044\" in Japanese)\r\n[GoogleIME.mov|https://jira.atlassian.com/secure/attachment/311188/GoogleIME.mov]\r\n[MicrosoftIME.mov|https://jira.atlassian.com/secure/attachment/311189/MicrosoftIME.mov]\r\n\r\nh3. Notes\r\n * Please note this symptom is different from the issue CONFSERVER-54326 because it reports that first letter is \"ignored\" while the letter is \"auto-committed\" in this case.\r\n * This occurs only at the Chrome environment, and IE11 also has another issue(Cannot type double byte characters in Section through IE11). Firefox works fine.\r\n * As long as crawling the web and testing, this is apparently coming from a common malfunction of Chrome v65.x, however it is suspected any implementation on the Confluence is triggering the malfunctioning.\r\n * Evidences for the above statement are as below.     \r\n ** This has not occurred on Chrome v63.x and prior.\r\n ** There are related articles outside Atlassian product,\r\n *** [Latest Chrome 65 update breaks start of CJK IME input \u00b7 Issue #2009 \u00b7 quilljs/quill \u00b7 GitHub|https://github.com/quilljs/quill/issues/2009]\r\n *** [576573 - Japanese IME: First character is auto-committed on office extensions - chromium - Monorail|https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=576573] (This is a bit old report, however still opened.)\r\n ***  [Google Groups \u2013 Chrome 65 \u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30c7\u30fc\u30c8\u5f8c Slack \u3067\u4e00\u6587\u5b57\u76ee\u304c\u610f\u56f3\u305b\u305a\u78ba\u5b9a\u3055\u308c\u308b\u554f\u984c\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066|https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/chrome-ja/toeoosmoBdo]\r\n\r\n\r\nh3.
