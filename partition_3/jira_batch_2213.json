The blog issue is noted elsewhere, but I wanted to record the suggestion of having a notion of anchoring the mail in a certain space.\n\nAlso, for enterprise use, it would be best if we could have a single email account for confluence, and it would have configuration rules (like procmail) that determines where to post the web mail archive. \n\nFor example, we would set up one account on the mail server, and subscribe it to a number of mailing lists of interest. It would be able to distinguish between mailing lists.\n\nRight now you pretty much need to set up a pop account per mailing list in order to really partition it (or I'm missing something). ",

I would like to be able to add my own fields (text, textarea, select boxes, drop downs, and more) that are very key to help us run our design sessions offline.  We can show the customer a design on our confluence page and have areas for them to interact and provide comments using text boxes, text areas, and other form elements on an individual question basis.\n\n\nFor example:\nFeedback needed.\n!image1!\n1. What is your overall impression of this panel?\n[Text area]\n\n!image 2!\n2. Does this panel meet your needs? [Yes/No - drop down], if no [Why? text box]\n\n",

Now things brings additional complexity because you now have to worry about what version you want to download (which can be specific for each)\n** I sugges that we put check boxes in front of each attachment with the ability to select all or individual and a download button (design on the fly here) \nThen the user would get to select a version for each attachment they have selected or stick to the defaults of the most current version.\n\nYou could also use this method to delete versions of attachments (i saw this request in another issue)",

Currently one could just forward the entire url e.g. /confluence/display/<space>/<page> to the Confluence app however it would be nice if <domain>/<page> could be the URL instead.\n\nI have managed to get some of the way along with the following Apache rewrite, using mod_jk2 to forward to Tomcat with Confluence installed as /. I have a mapping file to translate the domain name into a space key.\n\nRewriteEngine on\n# Set map to convert to lowercase\nRewriteMap       lowercase      int:tolower\n# Set map type and path\nRewriteMap   vhost              txt:/etc/apache2/maps/vhost\n# HTTP_HOST not blank\n#RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST}  !^$\n# Convert HTTP_HOST to lowercase\nRewriteCond  ${lowercase:%{HTTP_HOST}|NONE}  ^((dev|stage)\\.)?(.+)$\n# Search for host in vhost map\nRewriteCond  ${vhost:%3}  ^(.*)$\n# Prefix path with vhost search result and set environment variable \"VHOST\"\nRewriteRule  ^(.*)$   $1  [E=VHOST:${lowercase:%{HTTP_HOST}},E=SPACE:%1]\n\nRewriteRule  ^/display/\\w+(/?.*)        $1      [R,L]\nRewriteRule  ^/display/(~.*)    /user/$1        [R,L]\nRewriteRule  ^/$                        /Home\nRewriteRule  ^/(styles/.*)$   /$1?spaceKey=%{ENV:SPACE}  [QSA,PT,L]\nRewriteRule  ^/user/(~.*)$ /display/$1 [PT,L]\nRewriteRule  ^/(decorators|pages|images|spaces|download|x|rpc|admin)(/(.*))?$ /$1/$3 [PT,L]\nRewriteRule  ^/(.*\\.action.*)$ /$1 [PT,L]\n#RewriteRule  ^(/display/%{ENV:SPACE})?/(.*)$   /display/%{ENV:SPACE}/$2  [PT,L]\nRewriteRule  ^/(.*)$   /display/%{ENV:SPACE}/$1  [PT,L]\n\nIt would be nice if this could be done a little cleaner e.g. pass the space key as a querystring parameter to every request or prefix every URI with the space key e.g.\n/display/Home?spaceKey=<space>   or\n/<space>/display/Home    or\n/styles/<space>/Home   ",

It splits the query up into words based on letter characters, and ignores all symbols in the request.

However, a dot that's not followed by whitespace is considered part of a token.\r\n* Splits words at hyphens, unless there's a number in the token, in which case the whole token is interpreted as a product number and is not split.\r\n* Recognizes email addresses and internet hostnames as one token.\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nAn example of the grammar for this tokenizer can be viewed here: [StandardTokenizerImpl.jflex|https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/lucene/dev/branches/branch_3x/lucene/src/java/org/apache/lucene/analysis/standard/StandardTokenizerImpl.jflex].",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFSERVER-3028].\n  {panel}\n\nIf you try to use Confluence to build a community outside of an business organization (imagine a big Open Source project of people all over the place), there's no integrated way with Confluence to be able to send messages to other specific Confluence users.  Having an integrated system means people can protect their privacy and you don't need to maintain yourself some page of contact information which would require people to leave the application.\n\nHere's how I'd envision it being implemented featurewise:\n* You click on an envelope by a person's name (on anything they've written/modified/etc) or from their Confluence profile page to send them a private message.\n* When a person logs in, their Dashboard should mention that they have new messages with a link to view their mailbox.\n* There should also be some sort of status-dependent icon at the top right (where the history/profile/print etc icons) are that gives a link to your mailbox.  If you have mail, the icon looks obviously different than if your mail is all read.\n* If the person is subscribed to notifications for the site overall, that should include a summary of any new mailbox messages.\n* It might also be nice to have a separate, independent notification of new messages.  That is, you don't need to subscribe to the site notification, you can just opt to be e-mailed (if you've provided an address) a notification that you have a new private message in Confluence.\n* A user can access their mailbox from the icon mentioned earlier (top right of the screen) or from the profile page or from the Dashboard.\n* Once in the mailbox, they are presented with a list of mail messages, ordered by date sent, with some sort of indicator for read/unread, message title, and from information.  Thread visualization/grouping might be nice.    It might also be nice to have checkboxes beside each message (with a select/unselect all!) where you can do mass deletions from this screen.\n* When a user clicks on a message to read it, they have some message options: reply, reply with quote, delete, forward to external e-mail address. These work as you would expect.\n* The administration screen should have some configuration options for how many messages a user can have or how much space they can take up or how long they're kept around for.  You might need parameters for more than one of these and the mailboxes are pruned nightly depending on which one they're closest to at the time or something.  Not sure about the logistics here, but I'm sure something is needed to keep it from ballooning horrendously.\n\nI imagine this could be implemented maybe as some kind of plug-in, but I'm not sure.  I think many of the tools you need to do this sort of thing are probably already written because:\n- there is already a way to write content and format it\n- there is already a mechanism for threading messages, etc.\n- there is already sme kind of GUI for looking at mail messages and managing them (although I haven't used this myself)\n\n\n\n",

Particularly for choosing parent pages, sometimes it's easier to find an appropriate parent if you can see the full hierachy of pages. Not being able to do this can get a little frustrating (for me at least!), it has to be said.\n\nWould it be possible to add another 'tab' to the 'Choose a page' screen which displays the page hierachy (with a drop-down to choose which space to view, probably) and allows the user to select this way?\n\nThanks,\n\nPaul",

This could be represented as a separate search type 'Issues' that the user could opt out in the search. If there we multiple Jira setups connected to Confluence then there should be an option like the 'Select space' to search in. Users could selected either all or some Jiras to search from. Additionally, there could then be more configuration options for the Jira searches (Jira search options: projects, issue types etc.).\r\n\r\nThis way all information would be accessible and searchable from Confluence. It would be a lot easier to find the information that users are searching for since then there would really be just one place to search from.\r\n\r\nSee: [http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DISC/Integrate+Confluence+Search+to+Jira+Search]\r\n\r\nThis could be done over the remote api as well JIRA:JIRA XML-RPC API Spec ([http://confluence.atlassian.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=1035]) and\r\n [[http://confluence.atlassian.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=1035&focusedCommentId=43490#comment-43490]\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n{panel:title=Atlassian Status as of June 20, 2020|borderStyle=solid|borderColor=#000000|titleBGColor=#9ed4ed|bgColor=#ffffff}\r\nHi All,\r\n\r\nThanks for all the comments. Seems like there\u2019s definitely a lot of interest for this capability. \u2028 Over the next few months, we are embarking to improve search where it matters. As users of Atlassian products (sometimes more than just one), it becomes imperative to be working with these tools and searching content that resides therein\u2014being able to make sense of it all, while moving work ahead.\u2028\r\n\r\nWe would like to invite you to participate in our Search improvement Early Access Program (EAP) & be part of early research and provide us with valuable feedback to improve search. By doing so, you help shape the future of Atlassian product capabilities.\u2028\r\n\r\nIf you're interested, please sign up here:\u00a0[https://surveys.atlassian.com/jfe/form/SV_6XpkNZ9pBcbuU8l]\u00a0.\u00a0\r\n \u00a0\r\n\r\nVidhu Sharma\r\n Senior Product Manager | Search Platform.\r\n{panel}\r\n\u00a0\r\n{panel:title=Atlassian Status as of June 27, 2019|borderStyle=solid|borderColor=#3c78b5|titleBGColor=#3c78b5|bgColor=#e7f4fa}\r\nThanks for your suggestions and feedback on this issue. We agree that being able to search the content of linked Jira Macros is something that would be useful.\r\n\r\nThis, and in general the capability to do cross product search, is something we would like to implement, but don't have any plans for this at the moment. We will update this issue as we make further progress on it.\r\n\r\nAlice Wang\r\n Senior Development Team Lead\r\n{panel}\r\n\u00a0",

However, most of the directories I could think of have a mix of documents, presentations, PDFs, or text files. Importing a directory with a mix of these is not useful.  It would be great if the import could be made more intelligent by creating pages for certain extensions (txt) and allowing other extensions (doc, pdf, prs, xls, ...) to be imported as attachments.  What page would the attachments belong to?  Perhaps all on the same page named after the directory it came from? Perhaps a user specified page? Perhaps each attachment is its own page with the name taken from the file like the current support?  The last option is probably the most flexible and easier to start with.",

I would like to be able to:\n\n1. Hide comments from some user groups. So a separate view permission for comments would be needed.\n\n2. Hide all but the page text from the anonymous users.
