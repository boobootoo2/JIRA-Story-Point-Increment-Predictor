Problem description\n\nIt seems that regular events are inheriting permissions from JIRA events inside a Team Calendar.\n\nh6. Steps to reproduce\n\n# Create a new Calendar in Confluence and two events of type: Event and JIRA Issue Dates. \n# Configure the \"JIRA Issue Dates\" event to use a JIRA filter that is restricted to your user. \n# Create a few events in the Calendar just to populate it (for testing purposes).\n# Access Confluence with a different user (that's it's not the owner of the JIRA filter) and go to Team Calendars. \n# Click \"Add Existing Calendar\" and add the calendar created previously.\n\nh6. What should be happening\nYou should be able to see regular events within the Calendar but not the ones related to JIRA (because the JIRA filter is restricted to the user that set up the Calendar in the first place).\n\nh6. What is currently happening\nYou see nothing. No events are displayed at all. Plus, it appears that the Calendar doesn't contain any events, if you look at the calendar name at the right, you'll see no events under its name. *However*, if you create a new event (of any type) inside the calendar, suddenly, all regular events start showing up (once again, the ones you should be able to see in the first place and not the ones related to JIRA), and if you delete the event you just created, all events continue to appear in the calendar, but if you remove and re-add the calendar, the problem happens again, no events at all.",

Problem Summary    \nSometimes watchers of a page containing an embedded calendar will receive notifications if a completely different calendar has been updated\n\nh2. Details\nWhen a user updates a calendar (i.e. adds a new event), it seems that Team Calendars will look for pages (via Lucene index) that have the calendar embedded by searching for the calendarId. Watchers of all these pages will then receive a notification email from Team Calendars.\n\nThe problem is that the calendarId search is not accurate. Consider the following Confluence search:\n{code}\nembeddedSubCalendarId:83ded06a-f3ce-4639-a431-a807c9926fc9\n{code}\nInstead of searching for that entire unbroken string, it seems that Lucene is breaking this into smaller pieces, delimitated by the hyphen. This can be demonstrated by trial-and-error or via an utility like [Luke|http://www.semanticmetadata.net/2013/04/11/luke-4-2-binaries] to examine the index:\n\n!use_the_force.png|height=300px!  \n\n\nAs a result, pages that embed completely different calendars that happen to match any of the pieces will come back in the search, and watchers of those pages will receive an unintended notification. \n\nh2. Steps to reproduce\nI tested this with Confluence 5.4.1 + Team Calendars 4.1.4 \n\n# Create 2 calendars, Calendar A and Calendar B, and make note of their calendarId values (Grab it from Down arrow > Share/embed)\n# Create a page and embed Calendar A onto it. Make note of the pageId (Edit the page and grab it from the URL)\n# Add a user who is not watching any of the calendars as a Watcher of this page\n# In the database, locate those page contents in the BODYCONTENT table, and replace part of the Id of Calendar A with a part of Calendar B. The result will be an invalid calendarId, but that's fine for the purposes of this test. I used MySQL to test, your query may vary:\n{code:sql}\nUPDATE BODYCONTENT\nSET body = REPLACE(body, '<part_of_calendar_a>', '<part_of_calendar_b>')\nWHERE contentid = '<pageId>';\n{code}\n# Rebuild index (Confluence Admin > Content Indexing)\n# Add an event to Calendar B\n\nh4. Expected result\nPage watcher in step 3 will not receive a notification\n\nh4. Actual result\nPage watcher in step 3 receives notification, because the test page contains part of the Id of Calendar B.",
      "summary": "Team Calendars erroneously sends out notification emails to users not watching it"

If you try to create an event then set a repeat for that event and try to enter an 'until' end date for that repeat event. When you click in the until entry box - it does not access the calendar date picker (i.e it does not pull up the date picker calendar so you can pick the date that the repeat will stop).\n\nThis is the same for any repeat setting you pick. \n\nAs a workaround you can still enter the date as a sting of numbers, with the day first. But would be great if you could fix this minor issue. \n\nThanks,\nDaniel \n",

I can add new calendars without issue, but when I add the Team Calendar macro to a page and then in the macro try and add a new calendar by searching for it, nothing shows up. I have view access on all the calendars I am trying to add, so that should not be causing the problem. \n\nI can not find the calendars from the Team Calendar Macro and I can't search from my personal calendar page either - both searches come back blank, as if the Calendars do not exist, however for the new calendar can be seen on my personal calendar page (but if I delete it here, I still cant find it from the search option here for adding new calendars).\n\nThis seems to be happening only for new calendars, all the older calendars I added a long time ago are working and showing up. \n\nPlease help, I cant use the calendars at all, if I or anyone else can not add the calendars we have created anywhere. \n\nThanks,\nDaniel",
