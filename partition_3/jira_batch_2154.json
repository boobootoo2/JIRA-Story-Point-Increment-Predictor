With the current interface, labeling the images accordingly would take approximately five minutes, whereas a bulk editor might allow this to be done within seconds.",

Proposed Solution\n\nProvide a field for administrators to restrict group(s) from JIRA or Crowd to be synchronized. If this fields able to understand lucene syntax (for example) it would be helpful. So administrators can restrict multiple groups in one sentence such as:\n\n{code}jira_*, administrators{code}\n\nThe above syntax mentioned means Confluence will not sync any groups that start with {{jira_}} and {{administrators}} groups.",

We would like to log the currently authenticated user in the logs of apache, instead of having 5 different tomcat valve logs with that information.\n\nWould you please add this information in a response header - obviously, for simplicity, the same header name across all Atlassian apps would be welcome.\n\nThank you\n--\nIssa",

Links to people's profiles are fine, but \"Continue reading\", for example, doesn't do anything (in fact, the \"a\" tag doesn't have an \"href\" attribute).\n\nP.S.: I understand that this problem seems to rely on Zimbra's side, however, this doesn't seem to occur with any other e-mails from Confluence.

Those problems unfortunately started to repeat.\n\nThose are the steps that I've done:\n1. Wrote \"Logback configuration\" section with code block (formatting in attachment).\n2. Save the document.\n3. Edit and add upper section with another code block (different formatting) + some No Format block (I'm not sure if it's connected, but I think it's worth mention)\n4. Save\n\nNow all code blocks (as you can see in attachment) have the same formatting as last code block. I'm also not 100% sure if this formatting is inherited from last code block or just randomly.\n\nI hope it's reproducible and can be fixed easily.\n\nConfluence: 5.1\nCode Macro Plugin:\t2.0.19\n\nLet me know if you need anythnig else.",

I had contacted support to see if there were any easy way to do this and it  seems like the only way to achieve this function at the moment is to install the source editor add-on and modify the HTML code. I tried and it works. However, this is not a feasible solution to ask to non-technical people. We have about 50% non-technical people in our Company and we can not ask them to follow this route. It would be nice if there was a feature similar to other macros where you could just select the height and the width on a percentage scale.\n\nThanks\nAdhip",

Currently we copy the notes out of Jira, and paste them into confluence manually.  As you can imagine, with constant changes in Jira this is difficult to maintain.\n\nI was looking into the macro feature in confluence as described in:\n\nhttps://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/JIRA+Issues+Macro#JIRAIssuesMacro-restrictedviewing\n\nThe problem we have is that our customers do not have access to Jira, so I noticed the section: \u201cDisplaying Issues which have Restricted Viewing (Not applicable to Confluence OnDemand.)\u201d.  The page does not mention a solution for OnDemand customers like us.\n\nAfter contacting the atlassian support team, I was advised there's currently no easier way to achieve what we're trying to do, and to raise this new feature request.",

The _ClientAbortException_ is implementation specific, but the part writing to the _OutputStream_ could still stand in its isolated try-catch examining if the root cause is a _SocketException_ of that type and thus ignore it.\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n\n1. Put a breakpoint on l216 of the ImageFilterServlet (ImageEffectsPlugin 1.1.4)\n2. Open the _Prettify the page with an image (step 4 of 9)_ page of the demo space in the editor, select one of the images and click on _Properties_ in the property panel\n3.

Though the mind-mapping software suite is intended for use by academics, I argue that in this Information Age, who does not need help keeping track of all the details which constitute the Truth of the matter?\n\nSome notes on Truth:\nThe Google Search is one of the best general purpose providers of truth on the internet. However, the algorithm suffers from certain issues, particularly regarding the quantity of cross-links generated as a result of human behavior (e.g. painful experiences with sub-par technology vs. technology which \"just works\").\n\nWikipedia has largely addressed the need to consolidate certain [Google] Searches for truth into a reviewed, standardized, human-readable layout, thus augmenting our ability to understand and comprehend the unknown or unfamiliar. Wikipedia suffers from the inability to test Truth propositions, and so has policies which remove Primary authors from the allowable citation pool in preference to Journalists, or Secondary Sources, who may someday cover the material so that mortals may understand it (or something--I have yet to hear a sensible explanation for this policy).\n\nBoth tools may be used easily as consumers, with some difficulty as a producer. However, there is a yet a lot to be desired in the gap between knowing and creating. For instance, take GitHub and BitBucket. Those are social tools for creation of software. Now extend those ideas to logic, personal preferences, and what we do as human beings, and we ought to see some computer augmentation of our abilities to discern fact from fiction.",

Sadly, it was a total accident that I found that out (I was trying to type a comment and hadn't focussed the field). I never bothered to try it because the only visible piece of UI in workbox is a link to go \"back to notifications\".\n\nI'd like to see you guys implement some forward/backward arrows in workbox, similar to how GMail does it. That way, you will solve three problems:\n\n* Visibility and affordance of the feature,\n* mouse users will be able to do something better than \"back to notifications\", and\n* you can educate people what the keyboard shortcuts are (via tooltips on the buttons).\n\n ",

Problem\nAfter inserting a link to an anchor in a page, Confluence seems to be truncating part the resulting URL, making the link useless. \nFor example, a link to an anchor named \"section two\" would be rendered as \n{noformat}\nhttps://<account>.atlassian.net/wiki/display/<spaceKey>/<page>#<page>-sectiontw\n{noformat}\n(note the missing \"o\" letter at the end of the link).\nThe issue seems to be intermittent.\n\nh4. Steps to Reproduce\n# Create a new page\n# Create a numeric list with titles that will eventually be links.  (such as: 1. link one, 2. link two, etc.)\n# Create 4 h3 headers with some text, below the numbered list (\"section 1\", \"section 2\", etc.)\n# Above each h3, insert anchors (\"section one\", \"section two\", \"section three\", etc.)\n# For each of the items in the enumerated list at the top, highlight the text and click the link icon.\n# For the link, use the corresponding anchor that was just created (i.e., \"#section one\" or \"#section two\").\n# Save the page.\n\nh4. Expected Result\nLinks would point to the anchors correctly\n\nh4. Actual Result\nSome of the links are not rendered properly\n\nh4.

Word 2010 only writes the Transitional type of ISO 29500. It looks like Word 2013 could be either Transitional or Strict. See:\nhttp://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd797428.aspx\nBut in theory Strict is supposed to be a subset of Transitional. So if a Transitional document created by Word 2010 works, you'd think that a Strict one would work too. However, it seems that when they standardized Strict they also made a change to namespaces. That is probably the key to fixing this. For more info see: http://blogs.msdn.com/b/dmahugh/archive/2010/04/06/office-s-support-for-iso-iec-29500-strict.aspx\nAlso http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_Open_XML#Compatibility_between_versions states:\n\"Applications able to read documents compliant to ECMA-376 edition 1 will regard ISO/IEC 29500-4 Transitional documents containing ISO 8601 dates as corrupt.\"\n\n.docx from 2010 displays normally\n",
