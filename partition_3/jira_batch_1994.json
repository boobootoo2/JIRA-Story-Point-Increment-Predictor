Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Log in to Atlassian services using SSO via SAML\r\n # Wait for the session to timeout\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n * The session times out gracefully and users are redirected to Atlassian account the login page(or the IdP login page)\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n * After the session times out, the users are not redirected to the login page when accessing Cloud URLs\r\n * Sometimes, end-users are getting an 'HTTP Status 403 - Forbidden' error\r\n !Screen Shot 2019-11-13 at 9.53.12 am.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nh3. Notes\r\n * At this point, it's unconfirmed whether or not end-users should be redirected to the requested page, but should be possible\r\n * Testing had shown that if SSO via SAML is not configured, then users are redirected to the Atlassian account login page as expected\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\nOption 1 :  Clear browser site data for Atlassian services - e.g. for Chrome: chrome://settings/siteData, filter and clear the site data for Atlassian sites\r\nOption 2 : Login via https://start.atlassian.com/ and then access the Confluence site.

Issue Summary\r\n\r\nWhen pasting single digit decimal numbers into the new editor (either from an external source or even from the old editor), the 1st digit is replaced with a numbered list.\r\nh4. Example\r\n{quote}1.5 -> 1. 5\r\n\r\n3.6 -> 1. 6\r\n\r\n5.7 -> 1. 7\r\n{quote}\r\nClicking off the\u00a0*Numbered List* button in the editor does\u00a0_not_ correct the issue. It will simply remove the numbered list and leave only the digits after the decimal.\u00a0\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # \u00a0Create a page in the new editor\r\n # Create a page in the old editor\r\n # Make a list of single decimal digits (e.g. 4.5, 2.7, 3.6, etc.) (Does not need to be a list, can be a single number.)\r\n # Copy the numbers, and paste them into the page on the new editor.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nNumbers should be pasted without formatting into a numbered list.\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nThe numbers will automatically be converted into a numbered list.\r\nh4. Old Editor:\r\n\r\n!old-editor.png|width=314,height=238!\r\nh4. New Editor:\r\n\r\n!new-editor.png|width=213,height=149!\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nPasting directly into a code snippet does retain the original values. In addition, copying from a raw text editor also appears to work.\r\n\r\nh3. Notes\r\n\r\n* Many users may report this as an issue with copying and pasting tables from Excel, or tables from pages that are using the Old Editor.\r\n* I can confirm that the issue persists without pasting from a table or list. You could paste a single number and it will still auto-convert.\r\n* Pasting without formatting (e.g. CMD+SHIFT+OPTION+V on macOS) does\u00a0_not_ work to avoid the formatting.\r\n* Clicking off on Numbered List only will remove the numbered list, but will not correct the issue (i.e. 5.7 which has been changed to 1. 7 will only revert back to 7)\r\n* Attempted to disable auto-formatting in personal editor settings, but no change.\r\n\r\n\u00a0",

Suggested Solution\r\nAP.request() calls made from Connect macros shown in the JSD customer portal to be allowed using the same unlicensed Confluence behaviour that applied for GET requests.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\nVendors can make the POST requests from their application server, rather than using {{AP.request()}} to make an impersonated request from the client-side.\r\n\r\nh3. Notes\r\nThe current solution for unlicensed users viewing Confluence content, including macros, from the Jira Service Desk customer portal strictly allows only read access to Confluence.
