Starting with [Bitbucket Server and Data Center 7.3|https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/bitbucket-server-7-3-release-notes-1005327661.html], the delete source branch after merging option will now be *selected by default* when you merge a pull request. If this isn\u2019t your preferred setting, you can change it and we\u2019ll remember your choice for next time (using browser's local storage).\r\n\r\nSome of you in comments had requested an admin setting or branch pattern based setting for deleting branches post merge - it is not on our roadmap, please create a seperate suggestion for it. If you need to delete branches in bulk, then please provide your feedback on this suggestion - https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/BSERV-4142\r\n\r\nEdit 12-June-20: There is bug due to which preference is not stored in the local storage and it will be fixed soon. You can track it here\u00a0https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/BSERV-12407 \u00a0\r\n\r\nEdit 19-June-20: The issue related to preference not being stored in local storage has been fixed in 7.3.1\u00a0https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/BSERV-12407\u00a0\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n Imran Khan\r\n Product Manager - Bitbucket Server\r\n{panel}\r\n*Original request description*\u00a0\r\n\r\nCustomers might end up having a lot of dead branches laying around in Stash / Bitbucket Server because developers who do merges do not always check the \"Delete source branch after merging\" option. \r\n There should be a way to configure Stash / Bitbucket Server to enable the \"delete branch\" option for all pull requests as the default, in order to force developers to uncheck the option if they actually wanted to keep the branch.\r\n\r\nActually, it would be better to configure the option based on branch name patterns. For example branches named \"releases/*\" the default would be to NOT delete the branch.",

      "description": "h2. About \"garbage collection\" and Git LFS objects\r\n\r\nOperations like removing a branch or rewriting history in Git, _might_ generate unreferenced objects. The same might happen for \"Git LFS\" objects. Whilst \"Git\" has {{git gc}} which, amongst other actions, removes unreferenced objects, \"Git LFS\" doesn't implement a similar process and, due to its nature, a considerable disk space might be taken up on its \"content server\" for teams whose Git workflow fits into this description.\r\n\r\nh2. Why Bitbucket server does not implement that and the problem in more details\r\nThe main issue with \"Git LFS\" is that the specification does not describe \"garbage collection\". This is why we didn't implement it in the first place. When we wrote Git LFS we thought about that and it all boils down to how \"Git LFS\" works. Unlike \"Git\", its nature is of a centralised \"Git LFS store\" with its files in the commit history being checked out on demand by the developers as the files which depend on Git LFS simply contain instructions on how to fetch the \"Large File\" from the server.\r\n\r\nTo put that in perspective, let's think about 2 developers (A and B) who checked out a \"Git LFS\" repository. The Developer A does some work off a certain branch (that was originally Developer's B branch) and is working on a feature locally. Turns out that developer B decided to delete the branch that Developer A had branched off. That means that, if we were to garbage collect \"Git LFS\" objects on the server, we could potentially be breaking Developer's A work as we would have to remove all the objects from the aforementioned branch, leaving Developer A without access to those objects when attempting to checkout a previous commit on the branch, for example. On Git, that wouldn't be a problem as everyone has a full copy of the repository (i.e. when each commit on the branch pulls all the files down - there is no such concept as \"go to the content server and give me a certain file\"). See our [Git LFS Tutorial|https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/git-lfs/] for a more detailed explanation on \"Git LFS\".\r\n\r\nThe second main reason is another complicating factor as to how our application is architected around Forks.\r\n\r\nh2. Why would customers benefit from this?\r\n\r\nAt the moment there is no way to perform that (apart from very complicated and unsupported manual operations) but customers whose workflows might generate many unreferenced \"Git LFS\" objects could benefit from that in the future even though every \"Git LFS\" garbage collection will be a risky operation.",

      "description": "I am currently using Bitbucket Server 4.7.1 and git 2.8. In this version of Bitbucket Server pull requests are being blocked by certain submodule modifications that git can't handle when using the no fast forward strategy.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\nLet's say I create a submodule in a repo on the master branch and then in a later commit use the {{git mv}} command to move that submodule to a different file path. If I then attempt to merge my moved submodule via pull request into the master branch the pull request will be blocked saying that there is a merge conflict. This is because the background merge uses the {{no-ff}} option when computing the trial merge. If I perform the merge locally, git elects to use a fast forward merge strategy and the merge is able to complete successfully. In other words, using the {{--no-ff}} option is causing the merge with the submodule change to fail. The workaround is to perform the merge locally and then push to the target branch, effectively ruining our pull request only workflow.\r\n\r\nIn Bitbucket Server 4.9 the merge strategy capabilities have been updated to allow a user to choose which merge strategy to use when performing the merge. This makes it possible to use the fast forward strategy when merging a pull request with an above described submodule change and merge the pull request successfully. However, and here is the suggestion for future improvement, the background trial merge does not use the default merge strategy defined for the repository. This means that even though the default merge strategy is fast forward, the user will see a message like {{Bitbucket Server could not create the merge diff for this pull request}} because the background merge still uses the {{--no-ff}} strategy and now the user will have to bravely attempt the merge not sure if it will succeed or if they're doing the right thing. I think it would be great if the default merge strategy was the one used for the background merge. If would also be nice if git could handle submodule moves in a non-fast forward fashion but I'll take that up with the git people themselves.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nEdit: there seems to be a bug in JIRA that isn't letting me type {{--no-ff}} easily, fyi.",

      "description": "When installing the new version of *Bitbucket server 4.10* it requires an Elasticsearch cluster to enable the code search functionality. \r\n\r\nWe pointed our Bitbucket server to a shared *Elasticsearch 2.3.2* cluster. There is a slight issue with changing one of the settings your docs required us to change globally in a shared Elasticsearch environment. It is the dynamic mapper setting *index.mapper.dynamic* to be set to false. \r\n\r\nDoc: https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/install-and-configure-a-remote-elasticsearch-instance-815577748.html\r\n\r\nYour docs ask to turn it off globally in *elasticsearch.yml*. We can't do this on our shared Elasticsearch cluster because other indexes require it to be on by default and on is the default setting. \r\n\r\nIt is possible to configure this setting at the index level instead of globally, other apps like marvel do this for us to. So as a workaround we changed the *index.mapper.dynamic* setting via the Elasticsearch API on the bitbucket-search-v1 index.\r\n\r\nI really feel Bitbucket server could do this for us when creating the index. This has the benefit of not making changes at a global scope making it more friendly for shared Elasticsearch environments. \r\n\r\nAnother benefit is it would makes it easier for us to automate the deployment of Bitbucket server into a shared Elasticsearch environment.\r\n\r\nBelow is the API call I had to make in order configure the index. If Bitbucket server just passed this setting during index creating we wouldn't need to do this.\r\n\r\n{code:java}\r\ncurl -u es_admin -XPUT 'https://elk.acme.com:9200/bitbucket-search-v1/_settings' -d '{\r\n    \"settings\" : {\r\n      \"index\" : {\r\n          \"mapper\" : {\r\n            \"dynamic\" : \"false\"\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}'\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nThank you very much for your time. Have a great weekend.\r\n",

I'd like to know if we could have an option to order it as 3 numbers separated by a separator (a point, in that case), so that 6.10.0 is placed right after 6.9.8. \r\n\r\nI believe this is a minor feature, although would bring visual accuracy for the tag overview in BitBucket.\r\n\r\nThank you very much !",

Despite Bitbucket Data Center supporting Oracle. databases, at the moment we don't plan to add _official_ support for Oracle RAC.
