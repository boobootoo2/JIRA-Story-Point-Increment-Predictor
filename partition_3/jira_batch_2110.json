Problem Definition\nCurrently, if the Confluence indexer attempts to index an attachment that for one reason or another cannot be indexed a multitude of bad things can happen (bad Confluence performance, indexing task never finishing, etc). The only way to prevent this is to disable the indexing of attachments by following the instructions at [How to disable indexing of attachments|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/CONFKB/How+to+disable+indexing+of+attachments] and then rebuilding the indexes from scratch.\n\nh3. Suggested Solution\nMake the indexer a little smarter, and if it encounters an attachment that will not index multiple times (3-5?) then quarantine the attachment to prevent the index from trying to read it. This will allow other attachments to be indexed. Additionally it might be helpful for a list of quarantined attachments.",

It suffers form the key hole problem and provides information overload. \n\nWhenever I am editing a page I am surrounded with borders, banners, buttons and other useless crap that gets in the way of what I want to do. I understand you have a \"terms of service\" that requires that HUGE \"Powered by Atlassian\" banner at the bottom, and you think it is *cool* (or something ) to have huge top banners, and big empty blue button bars and whatever else your designers want for theme or \"image.\"  But please consider the people using your software and find a way to reduce the noise and provide a clean, minimal interface for people who are stuck using your app.\n\nYou are going to get me to evangelize your product more if it suits my needs that you will be blasting \"Powered by Atlassian\" in my face all the time.  In fact, that banner does more harm than good for me.\n\nThanks,\n-Andrew",

And so clicking the link will open the file in read-only mode, but in order to edit the file the Office application will prompt the user to enable editing, and once the user does so it will attempt to fetch the file from the Confluence server but _without proper credentials_, which results in the Office application reloading with the contents of the Confluence log in screen. \n\nCreating a separate \"Download\" link (for the attachments screen) or button (for the attachments macro) and grouping it with the other links or buttons may be better for usability.\n\nh3.

Problem Definition\nAs a Confluence admin, I would like the Livesearch Macro's autocomplete to suggest results after a couple of letters and not after typing the first word of my search.\n\nh5. Example:\n# Create a test space named *TEST*\n# Create a parent root page called *Contacts*\n# Create various sub-pages under the *Contacts* page with names \n** *UserA Test, UserB Test, UserC Test* and add a label named contactlabel\n# Add a *Livesearch* macro to the root page Contacts\n# Use the *Restrict to this Space Key* property to restrict it to the current space\n# Use the *Restrict to label(s)* property to restrict it to the contactlabel label.\n# Go to the *Contacts* page and search for *UserA Test*\n# Notice the suggestion only comes up after typing the compete first word UserA. This can be misleading as end user's believe there are no results when typing only the first couple of letters (e.g. Use)\n\n\nh3. Suggested Solution\n Suggested results may be displayed after typing the first few letters of the search term and not the first complete word.\n\nh3. Workaround \nNone so far",

That means that anybody who edits the page has to remember what each color means and what word should be used for each status. Further, there can be inconsistent use of colors on a single page. I want the statuses to be set up so that the page creator can predefine the color/status messages at the start.\n\nSecond I'd like to see the status color/message to be changeable without going into edit mode.\n\nTo sum it all up, perhaps the best way to implement these two suggestions is to make the word and color combinations editable from the edit mode.

Although many times some of the content on the page should not be shared publicly. \n\nIt'd be fantastic if there were a way to easily select content on a page that should not be included in the export function. I know there's a way to edit the CSS display property of a macro, but it turns out, there's no macro that's not widely used for other content/displays normal formatting that we can use for this. It's also more time consuming to use a macro/doesn't display in a clean manner.\n\nSomething simple such as highlighting words would even be great. Anything is appreciated. ",

Workaround\nWork around this problem by first restoring the site backup into 5.6 ([link to the archives|https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence/download-archives/]), then re-create the backup. Doing this will \"fix\" the backup file to contain the correct set of fields, and therefore, can be restored into 5.7 or later (including cloud instances).\n\nh2. Detailed Description\nimporting a site backup made from pre-5.0 (pre user-rename) into 5.7 or later fails, if there are content restrictions set. You will see an error ({{Error while importing backup: property does not exist: userName}}). \n\ni think caused by commits made for https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONF-35969 , which removed the handling for old fields that have been removed/changed for user-rename. \n\n\nException thrown in the logs:\n\n{noformat}\nERROR [Long running task: Importing data]

Problem Definition\n\nCurrently the only option we have to enable or disable the Membership Aggregation in Confluence is by running a REST call to disable/enable it, as described in [Managing Multiple Directories|https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/managing-multiple-directories-229838494.html#ManagingMultipleDirectories-NonAggregatingMembership]:\n{code}\n# To GET the current setting\ncurl -H 'Accept: application/json' -u <username> <base-url>/rest/crowd/latest/application\n\n# To PUT the setting\ncurl -H 'Content-type: application/json' -X PUT -d '{\"membershipAggregationEnabled\":true}' -u <username> <base-url>/rest/crowd/latest/application\n{code}\n\nh3. Suggested Solution\n\nGive administrators the ability to tell Confluence to use a non-aggregating membership scheme in the directory configuration UI so they don't need to use a REST call.\n\nh3. Workaround \n\nUse the [API Browser plugin|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.atlassian.labs.rest-api-browser] to perform the call and disable it.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n",
