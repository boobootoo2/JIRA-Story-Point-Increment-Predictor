Issue Summary\r\n\r\nSometimes recent commits that exist on the remote repository are not visible in the website, in the 'Commits' page of the repo.\r\n\r\nThis impacts users' ability to open Pull requests: if a user wants to open a PR for an affected branch, they won't be able to, as no commits will show for this branch.\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nThere are no steps to reproduce this, this issue rarely occurs in some repos\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nUsers have reported that pushing another commit or a new branch to the repo, solves the issue.\r\n\r\nYou can also contact Bitbucket Cloud Support ([https://support.atlassian.com/contact/#/]) to fix the issue for your repository.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\nh3. Update (October 2021):\r\n\r\nWe have found the race condition that was responsible for this issue. While we couldn't fully eliminate it in the short-term we were able to significantly reduce its probability. Additionally, we have implemented it in such a way that we can easily fine-tune the parameters of the fix based on the customer impact. Please let us know here if you continue to be impacted by this issue and in the meantime please refer to the Workaround section above to unblock your workflow.\r\nFor a long-term solution we have recently kicked off a project to fix the issue fully, but this is a larger project and will take us some time to complete.",

Older versions (3.1.x on Windows) will simply throw a \"This is not a valid source path / URL\" error in Sourcetree. The current version of Sourcetree for Windows will first ask you to add an SSH key to Pageant to connect to the repo via SSH. If you reject this dialog, another will appear saying no SSH keys were configured, and then you get the \"This is not a valid source path / URL\" error as before.\r\n\r\n*Requested behavior*\r\n\r\nAllow the user to choose on the branch post-creation page whether to use an SSH URL or an HTTPS URL for Sourcetree, similar to the selector on the Clone Repository dialog. Alternatively, maybe convert the SSH URL into an HTTPS URL on the fly if Sourcetree detects a URL that uses a different protocol from the one used to set up the repo in Sourcetree.\r\n\r\n*Background*\r\n\r\nI needed to add an SSH key to my Bitbucket account to allow passwordless logins in one of my build pipelines. However, elsewhere I am quite happy with my current account login-based setup, and don't really want to set up SSH keys on all the machines I access Bitbucket from.\r\n\r\nHowever, as soon as you set up an SSH key in Bitbucket Cloud, it automatically assumes you want to use SSH URLs for everything. This means any Sourcetree installs I have that still use account logins to access private repos will no longer work when I click the \"Check out in Sourcetree\" button.\r\n\r\nThe current workarounds appear to be either\r\n * set up every machine that needs access via my account with its own SSH key;\r\n * copy the SSH key to all machines that need it;\r\n * stop using the \"Check out in Sourcetree\" button and resort to standard git commands",
