This should be fixed in the plugin repository; maybe with an 'Installed Plugins' as the first tab, and an 'Available Plugins' as the 2nd (IDEA style)\nIf we did this we could drop the 'Plugins' part.

We are passing meta-data values to other pages. However, when running a metadata-report, it shows all results with a particular label (or specificy MaxRestults=30). Suppose we have 3000 pages total that we are calling, and we only show 30 in the report, then it will show 30, and nobody will know the other 2970 even exist.\n\nSo if you look at the contentbylabel macro, it says \"Showing 1-30 out of 3000\", so you know the other 3000 exist. \n\nTo take it one step further, it would be spectacular if it were possible to get this message on meta-data report AND get some arrows for pagination, so it keep me on the same screen and using Ajax (or something similar) allow us to click arrows to see the next 30 results. Similar to the jira-issues macro.\n\nGood USE CASE: Teams at a company want to use Scaffolding and Metadata for project or action tracking. At the end of those projects or actions, they ddon't want them to populate in the table anymore (because they are old), but they don't want to delete them either. They all want an archive of everything they do for future reference. Like many company's the users don't have great adoption with utilizing the labels (nor the knowledge of how the macros interact with the labels), so it's not a simple fix of the end users changing the labels.

I acknowledge the fact that some attachments may be accessed by external websites (and so shouldn't be removed) but in our case this is not the case and I suspect in most cases attachments that are not referenced on Confluence really are orphans.

Heading F\n{code}\n# Export the space to PDF\n\nIn the resultant PDF:\n\n* \"Home\" is displayed as the prime heading (h1)\n* \"Heading A\" is displayed as h2, \"Heading B\" is displayed as h3, and so on\n* However, \"Child\" (the child page title) is displayed as h2 (not h1), \"Heading D\" is displayed as h3 and so on <-- this is the limitation\n\nIn other words, you can see that on the first page the headings are increased by one:\n\n||Wiki||PDF||\n|Page Title|h1|\n| \"h1.\"|h2|\n| \"h2.\"|h3|\n|...|...|\n\nFrom the second (child page) on, headings are increased by two:\n||Wiki||PDF||\n|Page Title| h2|\n|\"h1.\"|h3|\n|\"h2.\"|h4|\n|...|...|\n\n\nBecause of this reason it's not possible to do a senseful page numbering with css counters. If the headings would be shifted on all pages in the same way, this would be no problem.\n\nA suggestion would be that Page Titles always get h1 in the PDF export and the content headings are always only shifted by 1. Additionally (to keep the possibility to define something like a title page with the very first page title), the very first page title could get something like <h1 class=\"very_first_page_title\">.",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFSERVER-16472].\n  {panel}\n\nI've been using Confluence every day for a year now and just now learned that you can select multiple users at the same time when applying page restrictions. Wow...what a time saver! For the past year I have been wasting a lot of time by:\n\n# clicking on \"choose users\" to open a new window\n# searching on the name of the user I want to add\n# checking the box next to the user in the search results\n# clicking on \"Save as\n# repeating for every user I want to add\n\nI wonder if other users out there have encountered the same waste of time without realising that they can add multiple users at the same time by typing in a comma-separated list of usernames into the  _Enter user/group name(s)_ box and clicking _Add_.\n\nThe problem as I see it is twofold:\n# The _Enter user/group name(s)_ doesn't do quicksearch on names like it does in JIRA. This requires me to know the actual Confluence username\n# The Restrictions section of the page encourages me to click on the \"Choose Users\" tab (perhaps because it's prominent in the UI or perhaps because I don't know usernames). The problem with _Choose Users_ is that it doesn't allow you to choose multiple users.\n\nIf we added quicksearch to the user _Enter user/group names(s)_ field it would DRASTICALLY improve the experience. \n\n*How it works in JIRA*\n!http://img.skitch.com/20090724-q1ga6ab83hscrbefnm96u2ycjt.png!\n\n*How it works in Confluence*\n!http://img.skitch.com/20090724-t4ei7jppqyhmuy66ybp3hi2rgm.png!",
