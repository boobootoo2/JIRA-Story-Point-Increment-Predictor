Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Navigate to an Issue and load the issue\r\n # From the har file we could notice some slowness when javascript resources loaded from the frontend and CloudFront.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nNavigating to an issue should render quickly by optimizing the javascript resource loaded from the frontend and CloudFront and should be consistent as that page is being cached.\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nOpening an issue tends to be slow, in some case it might take from *10 seconds* or *> 10 second* for a page that already caches from the browser during a hard reload and cacheless reload.\r\nh3. Notes\r\n\r\nDue to the slowness in rendering the Javascript resources from frontend/CloudFront, the slowness is actually the same across the issue view (new and old). In most case, here we could see some latency when the browser retrieving the javascript resources particular from the endpoint below:\r\n * [https://jira-frontend-prod-eu-2.eu-central-1.prod.public.atl-paas.net/]\r\n * [https://cloudfront.net|/]\r\n\r\nSo in this situation, the On load event can jump to 9.82 seconds to load a page with 21.1MB which is not really optimal in this case since the time to retrieve the javascript prolonged and this caused some latency from the frontend/CloudFront in parsing resources and the time primarily spent in downloading and parsing JS resources.\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nCurrently, there is no known workaround for this behavior. A workaround will be added here when available\r\n\r\n",

Issue Summary\r\n\r\nThis is a very specific issue, so please, make sure to read all the description.\r\n\r\nWhen we export a space that has pages on the new editor, containing Gliffy/Draw.io diagrams, from an instance that has both editing experiences to an instance that has only the new editor, the diagrams get broken with a 404 error.\r\nh3. Environment\r\n * Cloud\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # On the instance with both editing experiences (instance *A*), create a page using the new editor on a space and add a Gliffy/Draw.io diagram;\r\n # After publishing the page, go to *Space Settings > Content Tools > Export* and export the page we created to XML;\r\n # On the instance with the new editing experience (instance *B*), go to *Settings > Import Spaces* and upload the .zip file from *A*;\r\n # After importing the space to *B*, access the page we added the diagram.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nThe diagrams are shown on the imported page.\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nThe diagrams get broken, showing a 404 error.\r\nh3.

Issue Summary\r\n\r\nWhile in collaborative editing, when the user tries to type in an action item in firefox, if the a second editor is in the same action item, the cursor vanishes for the first editor and it is no longer possible to type. However if the first editor attempts to type in a part of some text in the action item, before the collaborative icon from the second editor in the page, he is able to type.\r\n The bug happens when the first editor is trying to type after the collaborative icon is on, the cursor vanishes.\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Open any page and try to edit it with someone else (or open two tabs of the same page in edit mode) in firefox browser\r\n # Insert an action item and click outside the action item\r\n # With the second edit page open, click on the action item to put the collaborative edit icon there\r\n # Go back to the first edit page and click on the action item right after the collaborative edit icon from the second editor\r\n # Type any text\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nYou are able to keep editing and typing any text after the collaborative edit icon in firefox.\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nNot able to type any text after the collaborative edit icon and the cursor vanishes after clicking in the action item, if you are using firefox.\r\nh3. Notes\r\n\r\nTest made in firefox version 69.0.1 and 69.0.2 (last updated version)\r\nWhen the first editor using firefox tries to click after the collaborative edit icon in the action item, if there is any text there already, after several clicks, the texts selects, but still unable to type any text.\r\n Same issue happens in the decision macro and all panels (info, error, note, success and warning).\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nAs working as expected in Chrome, change browser.",

Within a week of us rolling out Confluence at my company, people have started asking for it.  \n\nI am aware of the CONF-1210, CONF-7045, and CONF-6947 marked \"Will not fix,\" but this is a simple feature found in competing products which users find useful and I wanted to open it again and get votes behind it.\n\nThe {link-to} macro doesn't do this for external links so it doesn't satisfy this requirement.\n\n{panel:title=Atlassian Status as of September 19, 2016|borderStyle=solid|borderColor=#3C78B5| titleBGColor=#3C78B5| bgColor=#E7F4FA} \nHi everyone, \n\nThank you for your ongoing feedback on this issue. On behalf of the Confluence team I would like to apologize for the changing status of this request. After many hours of discussion with design and product management, and after some engineering prototyping and testing, we have decided to close this issue as we do not plan to release this feature.\n\nWe aim to make our users' experience as friction-free as possible, and although being able to control the ways of opening links would be useful to many of you, it could easily lead to an inconsistent experience for users.\n\nIf your use of Confluence is in fact enhanced by opening particular links in a new window/tab then please consider using one of the existing solutions from our Marketplace (unfortunately they're not available for Cloud instances): \n\n* [ServiceRocket Linking Plugin|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/net.customware.confluence.plugin.linking]\n* [External Link Add-on|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/ch.bitvoodoo.confluence.plugins.externallinks]\n\nCheers,\n\nAdam Barnes\nConfluence Product Manager\n{panel}",
