      "description": "h3. Issue Summary\r\n\r\nThere is a known performance degradation for the customers using Windows with Google Chrome major version 92 and the CrowdStrike agent installed ([https://www.crowdstrike.com/]). We believe this is caused by a bug in the CrowdStrike agent which causes Chrome to have significantly reduced performance - resulting in reduced performance for some websites, including Jira Cloud. The observed regression varies between\u00a03 and 8 seconds for page load times depending on the hardware and software being used. it is our understanding that Crowdstrike plans to release a fix sometime in September.\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Load a Atlassian Cloud application (Jira or Confluence) and observe a noticeable performance degradation\r\n # Validate if user has the following in their environment:\r\n ## Google Chrome 92 (major version)\r\n ## Windows OS\r\n ## CrowdStrike agent\r\n\r\nTo identify if you have the CrowdStrike agent installed you can check if you have {{CrowdStrike Windows Sensor}} installed on your machine. Command-line can also be used to check if the agent is running with the command {{sc query CSFalconService}}\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n - Atlassian Cloud performance should not be impacted due to any Chrome browser update.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n - We are experiencing longer loading times in Atlassian Cloud apps.\r\n\r\nh3. Notes\r\n - This is also the bug on Chrome - [https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1238289]\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n - Please use an alternate browser other than Chrome version 92. We recommend Firefox and Safari\r\n\r\n - Upgrade your Chrome browser from version 92 to version 93 (latest).",

The sandbox feature is now available to\u00a0all Premium and Enterprise customers. This means that you will now have the ability to:\r\n # Create (an empty) sandbox\r\n # Delete a sandbox\r\n # Copy production data into your sandbox*\r\n\r\n*There are some known caveats with what we do/do not copy. Please refer to our [official documentation|https://confluence.atlassian.com/cloud/manage-sandboxes-1019402392.html].\r\n\r\nWe expect that providing fully capable sandbox environments will be a multi-step journey. Please refer to the sub-tasks for the features we're working on and/or considering. We will continue to share updates on this ticket as soon as features are available. Don't hesitate to contact me directly if you have questions at [mtse@atlassian.com|mailto:mtse@atlassian.com].\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n Matt Tse\r\n Senior Product Manager, Atlassian\r\n{panel}\r\nh2. What is a sandbox?\r\n\r\nA sandbox is an isolated environment where admins & developers safely test applications and extensions and preview new features without impacting the production environment.\r\n\r\nFor more about sandboxes, please check out our [official documentation|https://confluence.atlassian.com/cloud/manage-sandboxes-1019402392.html].",
