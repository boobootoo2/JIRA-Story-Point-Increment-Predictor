We have removed it from our pipelines config file, but the environment still remains on the Deployments page.\n\nWould it be possible to hide a deployment environment if that environment is no longer in the Pipelines config? Or maybe have a setting that allows certain environments to be hidden?\n\nThat would be great, as currently our test environment is just reporting the same old Pipelines run that was last \"deployed\" to it and no longer gets updated.",

      "description": "Hello!\n\nWhen we download an archive of the repository, at least as a zip file, the special characters in filenames (files and directories), metadata, are incorrectly decoded on Windows (at least the build 16299.125), but are fine on Linux (my OS, Manjaro Linux, with UTF-8 encoding) and Mac (from what Yana Bazulina said).\n\nFor example, if the repository contains these 2 files: \"test d\u02bcapostrophe sp\u00e9ciale\" and \"r\u00e9sultat\", the basic extractor (not 7-zip, it seems) will show: \"test d\u2569\u255dapostrophe sp\u251c\u00aeciale\" and \"r\u251c\u00aesultat\".\n\nIt seems it is because the basic extractor (the one used when you right-click on a file from an Explorer window and select \"Extract All...\") follows exactly the norm (https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/digformatspecs/APPNOTE%2820120901%29_Version_6.3.3.txt, APPENDIX D - Language Encoding (EFS)): if the 11th bit is not set, it will be seen as a cp437 encoding, rather than UTF-8.\n\nI cannot change that client-side, and I cannot force users to change their extractor, so the only way seems to modify some parameters on your default zip archive. :-)\n\nNote that Linux and Github zip files don&#x27;t seem to have this problem either, and their 11th is set.\n\nThank you for your work.",
