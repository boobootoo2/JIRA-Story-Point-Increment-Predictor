This is okay as at the time of the database backup the repository was unknown. But sadly this repository exists in the stash_home filesystem. First nobody knows BUT:\r\nIf you now try to create a new Repository on this restored system you get an error: stash says the reppsitory \"repoID\" (it's the repo-id-number) would exist... Looking into the filesystem you will see this repo existing...\r\n\r\nI came to the conclusion that Stash iterates by 1 when creating a new repository... \r\nI'd like to ask you to improve that by checking first if a repo with the next iteration already exists and suggest to create a new repository with one more iteration. Also put a big warning that it seems there is a \"ghost-repository\"\r\nthis would not paralyze our users from creatign repositories when having a huge stash-instance later :)\r\n\r\nYou can imageine that there is obviously the same counter when deleting a repository within that timespan.\r\n\r\nMaybe as a spanning view I'd suggest to store some metainformation (which stash-project, wich repo-name) inside the bulk-repository  on the filesystem. (I'll look for an open issue for that or open another one later)\r\n\r\nThanks!",

      "description": "In the repository list when you scroll to the bottom it automatically loads in the next \"page\" of results.  This is all well and good: it makes the initial load fast and the pages come in quickly as you scroll.\r\n\r\nThe problem we've noticed is that you can scroll the page to the point where the last entry is on screen and the footer partially visible without triggering the load of the next page (the scrollbar is just a sliver above the bottom).  This makes it look like the the list has finished loading when it hasn't.\r\n\r\nIdeally the load should start when the last entry in the current list comes on screen (some sort of visibility trigger perhaps) rather than the scrollbar being right at the bottom.  That said even a \"X more repositories, scroll down to load\" message after the last entry in the way the \"no more repositories\" entry shows up once you've reached the real bottom would be an improvement.\r\n\r\nOur concern is that someone unfamiliar with the project and Stash may not even realise another notch down on the mouse wheel could cause more repos to appear.\r\n\r\nNot a big issue, at all, but we thought it worth raising.\r\n\r\nThis same issue may affect other infinite scroll pages, but I haven't looked at them in detail.",

As the issue hasn't collect votes, watchers, comments, or support cases from many customers during its lifetime, it's very low on our priority list, and will not be fixed in the foreseeable future. That's why we've decided to resolve it as *Timed Out*.\r\n\r\nAlthough we're aware the issue is still important to those of you who were involved in the conversations around it, we want to be clear in managing your expectations. The Bitbucket Server team is focusing on issues that have broad impact and high value, reflected by the number of comments, votes, support cases, and customers interested. Please consult the [Atlassian Bugfix Policy|https://confluence.atlassian.com/support/atlassian-bug-fixing-policy-201294573.html] for more details.\r\n\r\nWe understand how disappointing this decision may be, but we hope you'll appreciate our transparent approach and communication. If you're really passionate about this suggestion, please comment with your case in detail and we'll reconsider. Atlassian will continue to watch this issue for further updates, so please feel free to share your thoughts in the comments.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nImran Khan\r\nProduct Manager - Bitbucket Server and Data Center\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\nWhile reviewing the Stash documentation I spotted the Stash Backup Client in the best practices for backups. I love the idea, but I'm not wild about having a SuperAdmin's credentials inside a crontab file on the server.  \r\n\r\nI wanted to throw out a request that a dedicated backup user be created that is restricted from actual logins and allowed read-only access to the critical bits.\r\n\r\nIt is superb that you guys have taken this important step into account and built in an integrated approach that can be bolted on by those who need it to take care of such a critical task.",

I'm guessing that's not possible but I don't actually know.\r\n* Show the _END_ of the list on load and have a _Show Older PRs_ control at the top of the list.

      "description": "h2. Background\r\nh3. Clean History?\r\nIn our team we want a git version history which contains one commit for each Jira ID, i.e. one commit for each feature (further referred to as clean history..).\r\n\r\nh2. Collaboration on Changes\r\nWhen a developer wants to make a change to the main line code the developer will push a new branch to the stash server with the Jira ID of the feature. The developer then goes to the stash interface and creates a pull request for this branch.\r\n\r\nAnother person on the team will review the code. Ideally there will be some discussion about the change and some improvements will be suggested.\r\n\r\n\r\nh2. Iteration on Changes\r\nI am going to explain two possible workflows on iteration on changes and explain the issue with each.\r\n\r\nh3. Workflow 1\r\nTaking on board the suggested improvements from the review process, the developer makes a *new commit* and *pushes this commit* to the same branch. Thus creating a second commit on that branch.\r\n\r\nThis process continues until all parties are happy with the change and the branch is merged with the mainline.\r\n\r\nh4. Issue\r\nWhen the merge happens, all of the individual commits are visible on the mainline branch plus one 'merge' commit i.e. we don't have one commit for each feature.\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Workflow 2\r\nTaking on board the suggested improvements, the developer *amends the existing commit* and then *force pushes the change* to the existing branch on stash.\r\n\r\nThis process continues until all parties are happy with the change and the branch is merged with the mainline.\r\n\r\nh4. Issue\r\nWhen the developer does a force, he/she runs the risk of accidentally overwriting another branch or pushing a corrupted history.\r\n\r\nh2. Summary\r\nWe need some way to iterate on changes during the review process while maintaining a clean history. On top of this we do not want to use the --force flag in git because it could corrupt branches on the stash server.",

As the issue hasn't collect votes, watchers, comments, or support cases from many customers during its lifetime, it's very low on our priority list, and will not be fixed in the foreseeable future. That's why we've decided to resolve it as *Timed Out*.\r\n\r\nAlthough we're aware the issue is still important to those of you who were involved in the conversations around it, we want to be clear in managing your expectations. The Bitbucket Server team is focusing on issues that have broad impact and high value, reflected by the number of comments, votes, support cases, and customers interested. Please consult the [Atlassian Bugfix Policy|https://confluence.atlassian.com/support/atlassian-bug-fixing-policy-201294573.html] for more details.\r\n\r\nWe understand how disappointing this decision may be, but we hope you'll appreciate our transparent approach and communication. If you're really passionate about this suggestion, please comment with your case in detail and we'll reconsider. Atlassian will continue to watch this issue for further updates, so please feel free to share your thoughts in the comments.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nImran Khan\r\nProduct Manager - Bitbucket Server and Data Center\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\nWe have a feature request for Stash we would like to:\r\n\r\nAllow onsite System Administrators to override/extend the PermissionSrvice in the Stash API to restrict access to projects/repositories based on session attributes e.g. from a users X.509  cilent certifiecate.

The only problem is that we are not able to use the automation and would want a more manually control-able alternative/complement.\r\n\r\nOnce that the pull request is accepted a list of potential target branches could be suggested and flagged by the user in order to start the merge on those selected branches.\r\n\r\nWe would want the manual control because:\r\n* We usually apply fixes on a branch of the master branch which we would integrate using a pull request (on the master). After that the developer merges the branch to other release branches.\r\n* We do not always apply a fix on all release branches - sometimes we apply it on branch 1 and 3 but not 2.\r\n* We want to decide on a case by case basis if the merge back is needed for the particular fix.\r\n\r\nWould something like this be acceptable in the product?",

Your input in the comments helps us understand how this affects you and what you're hoping to accomplish with Bitbucket Server.\r\n\r\nWe spend a significant amount of time on an ongoing basis to determine our product investments in Bitbucket Server. Unfortunately, we are not currently planning to address this suggestion in the next 12 months. In the last 12 months, we've resolved 10 of the top 30 feature requests, and our upcoming roadmap includes a number of other top voted suggestions, including in-browser editing, improvements to search functionality, better JIRA integration, and providing an even better code review experience.\r\n\r\nI understand that this may be disappointing, but we believe it\u2019s important for us to be open, honest and transparent with our customers. Product feedback is collected from a number of different sources and is evaluated when planning the product roadmap. You can [learn more about our process here|https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/110373/how-does-the-jira-team-use-jira-atlassian-com].\r\n\r\nNorman Ma\r\n\r\nProduct Manager - Bitbucket Server\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\nOur team is thoroughly enjoying the new branching features in Stash 2.8 along with the JIRA 6.1 integration, but there is one little issue...\r\n\r\nWe follow a Github-style feature-branch workflow, where master is considered \"production-ready\", and all changes are handled in branches that are eventually merged back in.  The issue we're having is that while \"bugfix\" and \"feature\" work for many instances, and \"custom\" handles the rest, we'd like to enforce project-specific branch types (For example \"client/\" for billable client customizations...)\r\n\r\nWould be nice if there was a way to define custom types/prefixes in the repo settings, and have them show up under \"Branch Type\" when creating a new branch.",
