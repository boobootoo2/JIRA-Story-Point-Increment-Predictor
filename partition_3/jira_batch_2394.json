This allows the usage of IAM Users through ACCESS_KEY_ID and ACCESS_SECRET_KEY.\r\n\r\nThis leads to some disadvantages such as:\r\n\r\n1- It forces the user to share long-term access keys.\r\n2- It prevents your users from using what's called \"keys rotation\" - a security mechanism that changes credentials to resources that are defined by the user.\r\n3- It prevents your users from controlling who really uses these keys.\r\n\r\nThe advantages of using IAM Roles improves the sections above:\r\n1- Role-based authentication is session-based credentials rather than long-term.\r\n2- It allows your users to rotate keys, meaning that even if the keys\r\nare compromised, it's only temporary until they are replaced.\r\n3- It allows your users to define which entities are allowed to use the role (e.g. a bitbucket role / AWS account which is associated with bitbucket / etc.).\r\n\r\nAs a suggestion, the setup between your user and a pipeline can be as follows:\r\n\r\n1- Bitbucket creates on its behalf an AWS IAM Entity (IAM User / IAM\r\nRole / etc.), and shares the ARN (ARN is the \"amazon identifier\"\r\nfor this IAM entity) and maybe another thing which is called \"external_id\"\r\nin amazon terms.\r\n2- Your users create an IAM Role, which allows only the entity from\r\nstep (1) to assume it.\r\n3- Your users also attaches the desired permissions to their Role -\r\naccess to services such as ECS / ECR / Lambda to perform deployments, for\r\nexample.\r\n4- In the bitbucket-pipelines.yml file, instead of giving the\r\naccess-key and secret-key (even if they are secured-variables), the user provides their IAM-Role ARN.\r\n5- Bitbucket can now use this IAM-Role in order to perform requests on\r\nbehalf of your user, and yet no party needs to share any secrets with the\r\nother.",

Defining some environment variables inside bitbucket-pipelines.yml for any step would be really useful for writing re-usable steps when using YAML anchors.\r\n\r\nIn our use case, we have a monorepo that contains frontend code, backend code, iac code etc. and we use build flags to build multiple applications from the same source code and deploy each of them to separate cloud environments, all from the same branch. Because there's no easy way to re-use our step definitions, there's a lot of duplication in the pipelines configuration that could be easily reduced if we could pass env variables to steps.\r\n\r\nHere's a simplified example and a suggestion for syntax:\r\n{code:java}\r\nimage: atlassian/default-image:2\r\n\r\ndefinitions:\r\n  steps:\r\n    - step: &build\r\n        name: build\r\n        script:\r\n          - ./install\r\n          - ./lint\r\n          - ./test\r\n          - ./build $BUILD_TARGET\r\n\r\npipelines:\r\n  default:\r\n    - step:\r\n        name: Build (target 1)\r\n        env:\r\n          - BUILD_TARGET: 'build-target-1'\r\n        <<: *build\r\n    - step:\r\n        name: Build (target 2)\r\n        env:\r\n          - BUILD_TARGET: 'build-target-2'\r\n        <<: *build\r\n{code}\r\n\u00a0",

I will paraphrase the same arguments stated for Bitbucket Server.\r\nh3. Problem Definition\r\n\r\nA user needs to clone a large repository. If a user needs to work in a certain subdirectory of the repository, they are required to clone the entire repository. When a repository is large (Example: 1GB+) it can take some time to clone files that may not be required.\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nSince Git 2.18, Git protocol v2 has introduced the --filter flag to enable [partial clones|https://github.com/git/git/blob/v2.19.0/Documentation/technical/partial-clone.txt]\r\n\r\nThis will allow users to clone specific subdirectories of a repository only.\r\nh3. Why this is important\r\n\r\nThis will increase cloning performance on large repositories.",

The largest size a commit message would be before it would be truncated is 50, diminishing functionality on the new PR experience\r\nIf the commit message has more than 30 characters, the commit message will be truncated to display only the first 30 characters (20 characters if the sidebar is not collapsed).\r\n\r\nThis bug is to change this behavior to be like the old PR experience, where it was capable of displaying up to 50 characters, taking advantage of screen space.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Navigate to a PR on the new PR experience.\r\n2. You will be able to notice that the commits shown on the commits dropdown which have more than 30 characters will be truncated.\r\n\r\nWorkarounds:\r\nThe workaround for this is to hover your mouse over the commit message in order to display the entire message.",
