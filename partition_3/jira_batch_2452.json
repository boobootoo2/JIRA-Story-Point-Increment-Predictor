This often results in a large number of emails for users, and sometimes users don&#x27;t want to receive notifications for all those events.\n\nh3. Suggested Solution\nAllow users to select what Pull request events they want to subscribe to, for example:\n\n* A reviewer is added\n* A comment is added\n* A comment is edited\n* A comment is replied to\n* A commit is made to the source branch\n* A pull request is opened\n* The pull request is approved\n* The pull request is merged\n* The pull request is declined",

If I typed company-confidential information in the comment then now this other user has it that should not have that information.\n\nInstead I should get an error when I am on my corporate private repository so I know to go change it to \"@sisaacs\" who is \"Shane Isaacs\" that DOES have access to our repository.\n\nJIRA handles this properly and just leaves \"@shane\" as literal text without sending a notification instead of resolving it to a user outside of our organization.",
