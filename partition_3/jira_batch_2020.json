Summary\r\nAdd a new module or a capability to extend the space home pages and add byline there like the other pages or an icon that vendor apps can integrate with\r\n\r\nh3. Background\r\nVendor's byline links customers and sales to a page. These links provide context (what customer/sale is this page about) and link the page to the customer/sale profile (what pages are linked to this customer/sale).\r\nWhen a user creates a contract, for example, it could be useful to link it to the customer that is involved in the contract.\r\n\r\nWhy do our customers need it on the homepage?\r\n# Some users want to link a whole space to a customer/sale.\r\n# Space home pages are just like any other pages for some users. They look and behave the same and can therefor have the same purpose. Many spaces start with an overview of involved people. This can include customers.\r\n\r\nSince bylines are not available on the space home, vendor could use another integration point. In this case it's important to be able to distinguish space home from regular pages. (we don't want to build an integration for spaces and have it available on regular pages)\r\n\r\nNot only could we allow them to link whole spaces to customers. We could also give them an overview of all pages that are linked to customers/sales and which customers/sales they are linked to.\r\n\r\nSo basically an overview of all the linked data in the space.\r\nRelated articles:\r\n- https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/confluence/lesson-1-introduction-to-the-byline/",
