I think some of the frustration I read in the comments on them is because people are experiencing what we are experiencing and the request to address this is getting confused with other issues with the Issue Detail View. \r\n\r\nWe don't use/need Issue Detail View. When we click on a card, we want to see the View Issue screen. As is today, clicking on the card or link on card, goes to Issue Detail View. Then we have to click on link there to get to View Issue screen. This is an extra step that we have to do hundreds of times a day. \r\n\r\nThe current board option \"Hide detail view / Show detail view\" *+opens and closes+* the Issue Detail View side panel, but it doesn't *+turn on and off+* the Issue Detail View. Enable it to be turned off so people who don't use it don't have to hop through it to get to the Issue View they do use. The ability to get to the View Issue screen with ctrl+click in another tab doesn't help because it's still another step to the View Issue screen. \r\n\r\nFrom clicking on issues from filter results, we're trained to expect issue keys to take us to the View Issue screen. We want that behavior to be consistent every time we click on an issue key. If someone doesn't like/use the Issue Detail View, getting sent there is very annoying.  \r\n\r\n(on) *What if clicking on the card, opens Issue Detail View, and clicking on the issue key, as it does everywhere else, opens the View Issue screen.*\r\n* Good GUI uses consistent behavior\r\n* The issue keys, as they do across Atlassian products, go to the View Issue screen\r\n* The card, as a feature of Agile Boards, goes to the Issue Detail View, a view which also is a feature of Agile Boards",

      "description": "This suggestion is related to the limited Smart Commits available between Svn/Git, Fisheye, and JIRA.  Although Smart Commits can edit the workflow status, comments, and time spent on Issues- they cannot edit other fields within an Issue.  Editing other fields is often required when changing an Issue's workflow status, such as assigning a Fix Version or Tester to the Issue.\r\n\r\nMy suggestion is to allow special commands/syntax to be placed into an Issue's comment and affect some change onto that Issue (like clicking Edit and manually changing fields).  This way, the Smart Commit \"#comment\" could be used to place a command such as \"#assignfixversion-amq5.1.4\" into the JIRA comment.  JIRA would then see this and edit the Issue assigning the Fix Version as AMQ5.1.4.  Other possibilities could be #rename, #changeassignee, #changecomponent, etc.\r\n\r\nSmart Commits save some time but not when you still have to go into JIRA and update certain Issue fields manually during the development process.  If JIRA could execute commands straight from it's Issue Comments- we could get around the limited scope of the Smart Commits by using them to input those commands to the Comment.   ",

There also isn't a great way to see the impact of Story Points size to actual effect on your cycle time (e.g. a \"1\" might take 3d, and \"5\" might take 2w).\r\n\r\nThese two things would be very helpful:\r\n- A new Velocity Segmentation report where we can look across the history of the done work in the project and hone in on specific timeframes, with Story Points adding up on the fly.  I could see this being part of either the Control Chart or Cumulative Flow very easily (Flow makes more sense). \r\n-- Very few Kanban teams enjoy consistent and similar sized work to lean exclusively on a Control Chart.  Velocity in conjunction with the Control Chart helps get a better understanding of flow.\r\n- Matrix of Story Point values as filters in the Control Chart by default (no need to make quick filters for them)",

It says that this call should work:\r\n\r\nGET /rest/agile/1.0/board\r\n\r\nbut neither it (results in 404 error) nor any guessed-at variation of this call works on our server. For example, the call <server>/rest/greenhopper/1.0/board results in:\r\n\r\n<status>\r\n<status-code>404</status-code>\r\n<message>\r\nnull for uri: http://jira.roguewave.com/rest/greenhopper/1.0/board\r\n</message>\r\n</status>\r\n\r\nCould you take pity on us and post the api and greenhopper documentation for server 6.x somewhere? I know your preferred solution would be for us to upgrade to the current JIRA version, but developers do not always have control of such things, which upper managers see more in terms of time/effort/cost.\r\n\r\nMany thanks for whatever help you can give.",

The upgrade script doesn't tell you this, and if you run the script, it causes the JIRA install to essentially be corrupt, requiring you to uninstall JIRA completely, as far as I can tell from the community answers.\r\n\r\nCompounding the issue, it is very difficult to locate the 6.4 installer on the website now, which is required to remedy the problem. Try locating it with Google or on the Atlassian home page.\r\n\r\nFor more information and a screenshot of the error see the support question:\r\n[https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/37039777/migrating-6.4-to-7.0-while-on-deprecated-hsql-on-linux-error-message-says-to-start-jira-7.0-but-does-not-state-how-to-do-this]\r\n\r\n\r\n*Expected result:*\r\n\r\nJIRA upgrade script should fail early with an error saying you must first migrate your database before migrating to 7.1",

      "description": "Hi,\r\n\r\nWe have noticed something strange. When creating a new issue via the 'Create' button there is a small pup-up window in the right top corner showing for a few secunds with a link to the newly created issue.\r\n\r\nHowever this pup-up does not show if I have previously searched for an issue via the Quick Search field in the right top corner. The search results show, and if I then create a new issue via the 'Create' button it does not show and I have to search for the new issue or wait for the JIRA notification email for 'Created issue'.\r\n\r\nHowever if I have searched for issues via Issues-> Search for issues. And create a new issue, the pop-up shows as I shall.\r\n\r\nCan you reproduce? Any idea why it is like this?\r\n\r\nThank you in advance,\r\n\r\nBest Regards Karin Dahlberg",
