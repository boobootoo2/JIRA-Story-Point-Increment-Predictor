Scenario\r\n\r\nI'm watching a page in Confluence, so basically every update made to that page is going to generate a notification to me. At certain point, me (or any other user) add an attachment to that page, named *Bruno Rosa Test & Atlassian Support.xls*. If I navigate to the page and click the attachment, I'm able to download it without any problems. However, I'm not going to be able to do the same through the notification that Confluence sent about \"adding the attachment to the page\":\r\n\r\n!confluence-notification.png!\r\n\r\nClicking on the link to the attachment inside the email directs to a login page. Once authenticated, I should be able to download the attachment, instead I get a *Page Not Found* error:\r\n\r\n!page-not-found.png!\r\n\r\nThis is happening because the URL is wrong. Copying the URL from the link inside the email content I get:\r\n\r\n{noformat}\r\nhttps://brosa-test.atlassian.net/wiki/download/attachments/524299/Bruno%20Rosa%20Test%20%26%20Atlassian%20Support.xls?version=1&modificationDate=1412800037199&api=v2&src=mail&src.mail.timestamp=1412800037235&src.mail.notification=com.atlassian.confluence.plugins.confluence-content-notifications-plugin%3Aattachment-created-notification&src.mail.recipient=ff80808148f15a580148f15a84ad0001\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nWhich is *correct*! However, when I'm directed to the login page (to authenticate before downloading the file), this is the URL appearing in the address box:\r\n\r\n{noformat}\r\nhttps://brosa-test.atlassian.net/login?dest-url=/wiki%2Fdownload%2Fattachments%2F524299%2FBruno+Rosa+Test+&permission-violation=true\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nNotice that the name of the file after the *Bruno Rosa Test* part is gone from the URL - the *& Atlassian Support.xls* is gone. Of course that once we authenticate, the download fails and we get the *Page Not Found* error - the URL at this point is (after authenticating):\r\n\r\n{noformat}\r\nhttps://brosa-test.atlassian.net/wiki/download/attachments/524299/Bruno+Rosa+Test+\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nIf I re-do all the steps using a file named *Bruno Rosa Test Atlassian Support.xls*, everything works fine.\r\n\r\nh4.

      "description": "This issue is regarding the cdsframework account's OnDemand service with JIRA and Confluence. Default application access is Confluence only for new users. When the new user creates their account from an invite they get assigned access to the Confluence application and the _jira-users_ group and not the confluence-users group as expected. This is causing a lot of issues as new users sign up and they have no access to the site resources until an administrator goes in and manually fixes the group assignments.\r\n\r\nI hope this is just a configuration issue but I have been through the docs and the admin interface and can see no way to address the problem.\r\n\r\nAccording to the following link, the user should be granted access to the '[product]-users' group when granted access to an application product of the OnDemand service (in this case Confluence, which is occurring as a result of the configured default application access) but that is _not_ happening.\r\n\r\nhttps://confluence.atlassian.com/display/AOD/Default+Groups+and+Permissions+in+Atlassian+OnDemand\r\n\r\nThanks for your time.\r\n",

      "description": "I work for a company where we pull users via LDAP based on their email addresses. So, I do not have the option to follow Atlassian recommendation of not using email addresses as ids. In fact, I have been asked by management to change the value of the Username label to say \"Email Address\" in both, web and mobile apps.\r\n\r\nIf this was JIRA, it would be very simple:\r\nWeb: \r\n/data/jira/atlassian-jira/WEB-INF/classes/com/atlassian/jira/web/action/JiraWebActionSupport.properties\r\nMobile:\r\nmobile-1.7.jar/jira/i18n.properties\r\n\r\nBut Confluence has a different setup. Tracing the class properties I saw they are packed in the following lib jar file:\r\n\r\n/data/confluence/confluence/WEB-INF/lib/confluence-5.6.4.jar\r\n\r\nIf unpacking that jar, we see this file:\r\ncom/atlassian/confluence/core/ConfluenceActionSupport.properties\r\n\r\nThe lines are:\r\n183 username.name=Username\r\n4726 username.accesskey=Username\r\n\r\nHERE IS THE BUG:\r\n\r\n1) - If we change 4726 username.accesskey=Username to 4726 username.accesskey=Email Address then the web app and mobile app in landscape style reflect the change. But the mobile app in portrait style does not.\r\n2) - If we also change line 183, then both, web app and mobile app will reflect the change. However, if we go to browse the User section in the dashboard as administrators we will see that the label for \"Username\" in the All Users table has been affected too, which makes no sense.\r\n\r\nQUESTION:\r\n\r\n1) - Can you separate the attributes of mobile labels from web labels just as you did in JIRA?\r\n\r\n2) - If I want to fix the mobile app in portrait style (without spending another day unpacking jars) where exactly can I go an switch username.name to username.accesskey ? I need this only for the login page. I haven't tried yet but it would be nice if Atlassian can provide an accurate answer and I don't have to shoot darts and break the app.\r\n\r\n ",
