[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFSERVER-22272].\n  {panel}\n\nh4. The problem\n\nOften, when creating a new page about a topic, related pages exist but the author has not thought of looking up (or has not found) related pages and blogposts before starting to write a new page. This has several negative consequences for the wiki content as a whole:\n* Existing content is not utilized to save time when writing new pages\n* New documentation does not take into account existing documentation\n* Lessons are not being learned about projects and processes as much as could be\n* Duplicate or conflicting information enters the wiki, which makes searching slower and more difficult\n* Old, inaccurate content may cause loss of productivity or even damage business when obsolete processes and instructions are followed\n* The volume of content grows faster than it has to and makes managing both the content and the system more time-consuming and resource-intensive\n\nOn a related note, sometimes blog posts inadvertently become pages when people make a \"hot topic\" news item but don't know that a page exists for it or forget to link to it. The blog post is updated 100 times with attachments, comments, tables and so on until it becomes one of the most viewed \"pages\" of the wiki. And it can't be moved. Or converted. Or made a part of the page hierarchy in any way.\n\nIt is difficult to alleviate this problem by simply \"educating staff\" when time and money is short, new employees keep entering the user base, and people generally have too little time to do proper research before creating a new page.\n\nh4. The solution\n\nWhen creating a new page, it would be useful to see which pages already exist that relate to the current page somehow. If other pages already exists that describe the topic, the user could review them. Perhaps a new page does not have to created in the first place but existing documentation can be updated instead. Or perhaps parts of the new page don't have to be written at all because they have already been described elsewhere and the user can instead link to existing documentation.\n\nh4. The benefits\n\nThe central benefit here is that users become *aware* of existing, related content and can take it into account better when creating new content. This has several positive implications for the usability and manageability of the system as a whole:\n* The overall usability of the wiki soars thanks to better linking, fewer pages, and less conflicting information.\n* Management becomes much easier in the long run because there is less content to manage.\n* Wikignomes (like me) save hundreds of hours annually in time when they don't have to constantly merge pages, archive pages, link pages, move comments, convert blogs to pages, remind authors to check existing documentation before they create content...\n\nh4. How it works\n\nI'm thinking of a robot much like Hercules, the Atlassian support robot that looks through log files and suggests existing Jira issues based on the error messages found.\n\nThe way it would work in my view is that after entering the title for a page and moving the focus away from the title field, Confluence would search for pages that are *similarly named or labeled* and show related pages in a sidebar on the right. The suggestions would have two purposes:\n# \"Similarly named pages exist. Did you mean to edit one of these pages?\"\n# \"These pages seem to relate to the page you are currently writing. Consider linking to one or several of these pages if they are relevant to the page you are writing.\"\n\nWhile I'm at it, this same feature would be awesome in JIRA. :)",

Similarly, if there's a spontaneous breakage in the background tasks in performance test run, we'll never know. To address this, we should:\n# Add failure tracking in all quartz tasks, worker threads, and any other thread that gets created that aren't servlet threads,\n# Add a way to turn these failures into test failures. This could be a post acceptance test target (eg 100_check_workers) to query confluence for any failures and fail the build if it detects some, or it could be a test-specific handler that turns any unexpected failure into a johnson event.\n# Add functestrpc hooks for pausing and resuming failure tracking in these threads, to allow us to avoid spurious failures. We could make the hooks specific to each kind of worker we create, so turning off indexing errors won't turn off email notification errors, etc.\n# Add calls in tests that directly cause failures in these background tasks to suspend tracking while they break things, so that we don't mix up their (expected) failures with real problems.\n\nSo we can commit this change early and figure out if this could give us usable results, consider adding a temporary build profile that alone runs the new verifier.",

Something that the default confluence theme provides but our Theme Builder plugin doesn't. This was the case with a couple of previous bugs relating to the 3.1 features.\n\n due to the minified DnD Javascript code, it is very difficult to find out what is missing or needed. Please could you assist in the resolution of this bug by providing the un-minified JavaScript code for the Drag'n'Drop feature?\n\n\nMany Thanks,\n\nRobin Crorie\nAdaptavist Support Engineer\n\nhttp://www.adaptavist.com\nrcrorie@adaptavist.com\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Feel free to direct me \nelsewhere, but unfortunately these customers have been unhappy for \nmonths now, and I have not been taking good enough care of things.\n\nThanks,\n\nGary\n",

The \\{jiraissues\\} macro is great for viewing an issue list, but it can't be used as input to other macros like \\{chart\\}. I know \\{gadget\\} can display JIRA charts, but a user came up with an interesting scenario that can't currently be achieved.\n\n- Data resides in 2 systems: test results in a SQL db, and issues in JIRA\n- The user wants to combine queries from both systems in a single chart\n\nI could see this working in this way:\n\n\\{chart\\}\n  \\{csv:url=JIRA CVS URL\\}\n  \\{sql\\}SELECT...\\{sql\\}\n\\{chart\\}\n\nBut the csv URL is not retrieved as the user viewing the page, which is why the trusted connection needs to be used. We don't want to allow SQL access to JIRA because it circumvents security restrictions. We also won't allow the use of user credentials in the JIRA URL, for obvious reasons.\n\nI have tried:\n\\{chart\\}\n  \\{jiraissues:renderMode=static\\}\n\\{chart\\}\n\nbut the chart macro doesn't seem to be able to interpret the data returned by jiraissues.

I run into this frequently when pasting info from email into our Wiki.\n\nBelow is described a workaround.  My ask is that confluence implement the ability to fix the html.  Since Firefox is so popular, my hope is this will be worth doing.\n\nWorkaround:\n\nTurns out that Mozilla HTML rendering engine has a bug in how it renders HTML as described in the inserted post below.  Confluence has issues rendering this html.\n\nI also found a fix.  The same program has implemented ability to fix the nested lists.  I can copy the HTML into this program, run its \"Clean HTML\" program and then paste into Confluence and it renders correctly.   Unfortunately a bit of effort just to paste something into Confluence but at least I know how to deal with it now.\n\nOnce you have pasted into Confluence, there does not seem to be a way to fix this from the HTML that Confluence has.  It modifies it enough that the program can no longer fix the lists.\n\nBlueGriffon is available here: http://bluegriffon.org/pages/Download\n-------\n\nPost from bluegriffon@googlegroups.com:\n\nOn 2/2/11 12:25 PM, \"Keith S.\" wrote:\n\nOn Jan 26, 10:05 pm, Daniel Glazman  wrote:\nLe 26/01/11 23:47, Keith S. a crit :\n\n> Hi there,\n\n> I just downloaded BlueGriffon today (0.8.1 nightly), as I'm looking\n> for a good, simple WYSIWIG editor to recommend to the people in my\n> office who INSIST on using MS Word, despite my pleas not to.\n\n> One thing I noticed -- which is an issue for me, because I have tools\n> that depend on this -- is that you are not generating your nested\n> lists correctly.

I usually edit 5-10 pages a day. that means in a month it goes around 200 pages into drafts.

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFSERVER-21952].\n  {panel}\n\nThis feature request is related to support ticket https://support.atlassian.com/browse/CSP-58347  After contacting Atlassian Support on behalf of our client for this issue, I was told Lucene index customization is currently not supported and was asked to submit a feature request instead.  \n\nh2. Business Use Case\n\nOur client wishes to use Confluence as a partner portal, to delegate spaces to their partners. This seems like a very common user case, and leveraging one of the core space distribution benefits of Confluence spaces.\n\nHowever, since their partners are OEM manufacturers, and possibly competitors, it is logical that they do not want the names of the users to be visible to each other. We have suppressed the Profile Directory without problem, but since user names are indexed by Lucene, removing them from the index is not working (despite our code efforts to do so, as described below).\n\nh2. Abstract\n\nWe are in the process of implementing a user requirement to exclude all user information from Confluence search.  The approach we took is removing Personal Information from the Lucene index using an [extractor module|http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/CONFDEV/Extractor+Module].\n\nWe've found from logging that the document appears to be removed from the index, but the search results persist.  Worse, having updated a user's profile, and reindexed, we have index locking errors amongst other things.\n\n\nh2. Detail\n\nThe *Index Limiter plugin* has been written for the single purpose of removing personal information from the Lucene index.\n\nThe purpose of this is to remove:\n# username links from the rich text editor (RTE)\n# username results from \"quicksearch\"\n# user details/profile from the search results page e.g. /dosearchsite.action?queryString=admin\n\n*I've attempted the unindexing in 2 parts*\n# *Invalidating the fields:* Using an extractor module (source in svn) to invalidate the values in these fields: \"type\",\"email\", \"fullName\", \"title\", \"username\" within the Lucene documents of type {{PersonalInformation.CONTENT_TYPE}} -- _The_ {{{_}addFields()_}} _method in the extractor_\n# *Remove all personal information from the Lucene index:* Remove all Lucene Documents with handle startswith com.atlassian.confluence.user.PersonalInformation -- _The_ {{{_}unIndex()_}} _method in the extractor_\n\n\nh3. Results\n\n{panel:bgColor=#FFFFCE}After installing the Index Limiter plugin, run a complete reindex in Confluence Admin to trigger removal of the personalInformation data from Lucene{panel}\n\n\nh4. 1.
