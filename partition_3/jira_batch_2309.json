The change involved adding some extra checks to determine if the mapping function modifies this map during computation, but also picks up the concurrent modification that happens in CachingRepositoryHookScmHelper.

      "description": "When OpenSSH 8.8, released Sep-2021, the \"ssh-rsa\" public key signature algorithm that depends on SHA-1 has been disabled by default:\r\n\r\n{quote}\r\nThis release disables RSA signatures using the SHA-1 hash algorithm by default. This change has been made as the SHA-1 hash algorithm is cryptographically broken, and it is possible to create chosen-prefix hash collisions for <USD$50K [1]\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nAs a result a user using a version of Git that depends on OpenSSH 8.8, if they use an ssh-rsa keypair, will see failures of any hosting operation over SSH, for example:\r\n\r\n{noformat}\r\ngit clone ssh://git@stash.example.com:7997/stash/stash.git\r\nCloning into 'stash'...\r\ngit@stash.example.com: Permission denied (publickey).\r\nfatal: Could not read from remote repository.\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nAnd as OpenSSH 8.8+ is rolled out to the various operating systems the majority of Bitbucket Server users may be impacted by this problem.\r\n\r\nThere are a number of solutions or workarounds a user can use, and I'll list them in the \"workarounds\" section below. Here I propose implementing [RFC 8332|https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8332] such that the use of RSA based keys can continue with SHA-256 and SHA-512 used instead of SHA-1.\r\n\r\nRFC 8332 permits, should both server and client support it, the user's existing ssh-rsa keys to be signed with either SHA-256 and SHA-512, this is known as rsa-sha2-256 and rsa-sha2-512. The OpenSSH 8.8 release notes actually call this out:\r\n\r\n{quote}\r\nFor most users, this change should be invisible and there is no need to replace ssh-rsa keys. OpenSSH has supported RFC8332\r\nRSA/SHA-256/512 signatures since release 7.2 and existing ssh-rsa keys will automatically use the stronger algorithm where possible.\r\n{quote}\r\nHowever unfortunately [Apache Mina SSHD does not currently support this|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SSHD-1216], and as such Bitbucket Server does not support this. More specifically, it supports rsa-sha2-256 and rsa-sha2-512 however doesn\u2019t implement the \"server-sig-algs\" extension required to notify the client of the additional signature algorithms.\r\n\r\n*Host Key Impact*\r\nThe above discussion is referring to the SSH key pair that the client generates, however Bitbucket Server instances also have a key pair that is generated when it is first installed (or more specifically when SSH is first used). This key (the public key part) is provided to the client whenever the client makes an SSH connection, so is just as vulnerable to impact of deprecations as the clients key pair.\r\n\r\nPrior to Bitbucket Server 6.6 Bitbucket Server supported neither rsa-sha2-256 nor rsa-sha2-512, only the original ssh-rsa SHA-1 algorithm was supported. As a result, even if users were to use an ECDSA or EC25519 based key, the host key validation would fail with OpenSSH 8.8+. Specifically requests will fail like so:\r\n{noformat}\r\ndebug2: host key algorithms: ssh-rsa\r\n..\r\ndebug1: kex: host key algorithm: (no match)\r\nUnable to negotiate with 192.168.0.1 port 7999: no matching host key type found. Their offer: ssh-rsa\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nThis was because the SSH server implementation Bitbucket Server uses, Apache Mina SSHD, did not support anything else. That changed in version 2.3.0: [SSHD-895 - Add support for RSA + SHA-256/512 signatures|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SSHD-895]\r\n\r\nBitbucket Server 6.6 was the first version to use Apache Mina SSHD 2.3.0, and since then is able to provide a host key via either rsa-sha2-512, rsa-sha2-256 or ssh-rsa. With modern versions of OpenSSH clients it will prefer the SHA-2 based signature and respond like so:\r\n{noformat}\r\ndebug1: kex: host key algorithm: rsa-sha2-512\r\n{noformat}\r\nThis is considered secure and is not deprecated by OpenSSH.\r\n\r\nh2. Workarounds\r\n\r\n*Move to a different key type*\r\nIn addition to RSA, Bitbucket Server also supports ECDSA and ED25519 based keys. These keys are not impacted by the deprecation in OpenSSH 8.8. The current version of the [Creating SSH keys|https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/creating-ssh-keys-776639788.html] documentation provides instruction for generating an ED25519 key.\r\n\r\n*Re-enable the disabled signature algorithm*\r\nThe OpenSSH 8.8 release notes provide instruction to re-enable the disabled signing algorithm:\r\n\r\n{noformat}\r\nFor example, the following stanza in ~/.ssh/config will enable\r\nRSA/SHA1 for host and user authentication for a single destination host:\r\n\r\nHost old-host\r\n    HostkeyAlgorithms +ssh-rsa\r\n    PubkeyAcceptedAlgorithms +ssh-rsa\r\n\r\nWe recommend enabling RSA/SHA1 only as a stopgap measure until legacy\r\nimplementations can be upgraded or reconfigured with another key type\r\n(such as ECDSA or Ed25519).\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\n*Use HTTP/S*\r\nThe HTTP protocol is not impacted; users already using HTTP for Git will be unaffected. This change can be as simple as changing the remote:\r\n{noformat}\r\n$ git remote set-url origin https://stash.example.com/scm/myproject/myrepo.git\r\n{noformat}",

We now see an extension to this use-case when other teams need to use this repo as well in their CI/CD.\r\n\r\nEven though the huge repo is in the farm these other teams might fetch it from the primary, which takes us back to square 1 to some extent since the farm is \"inheriting\" the permission setup in the primary.\r\n\r\nInforming the other teams about the existence of the synchronized repo is the obvious way to avoid this but in a rapidly growing org this will be overseen and un-necessary load will be added to the primary instance.\r\n\r\nMy suggestion is therefore to add an optional permission level for the Mirror farm for repos that are synchronized. Default value can be to inherit but there should be an option to tweak this to restrict the repo located in the primary to e.g. the owning team only and allow the repo in the Mirror to other teams as well.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\n// Svante",

After hooks are unpacked, the system does a check for stale files that might be left over in the directory and prunes them.\r\n\r\nWhen the shared home is on NFS, it's possible for hook files to become visible before their attributes, like their modification timestamp, have been written. When that happens, it results in the system deleting the hooks it just unpacked. Since the hooks are removed, {{git}} processes like {{git http-backend}} and {{git receive-pack}} that are supposed to trigger hooks don't, leading to a range of knock-on issues.\r\n\r\nNote: This behavior has _not_ been observed on non-NFS filesystems, where file and attribute creation are atomic. Additionally, earlier versions of Bitbucket Data Center/Server did not unpack hooks the same way, or to the same location, and are not susceptible to this issue.\r\n\r\nh3.

However this is not accurate for the database or the shared storage.  Add a comment that mentions these exceptions to the Supported Platforms page\r\n\r\n- Smart Mirrors must use the internal database only.

While there is some intra-node communication in a Mirror Farm, each node of the farm must NOT use shared disk storage.\r\n-- Using NFS at all is strongly discouraged and local disk only is the expectation\r\n\r\nConsider reminders in section \"1.

      "description": "h3. Issue Summary\r\n\r\nWhen a repository fork is created Bitbucket runs the command {{git clone --bare --shared...}}. By default commands executed are subject to the following two timeouts:\r\n\r\nAn idle timeout that configures how long the command is allowed to run without producing any output:\r\n{noformat}\r\nprocess.timeout.idle=60\r\n{noformat}\r\nBy default a process that has not produced any output (on stdout/stderr) or consumed any input (on stdin) for 60 seconds will be terminated.\r\n\r\nAdditionally a process execution timeout exists. This configures a hard upper limit on how long the command is allowed to run even if it is producing output.\r\n{noformat}\r\nprocess.timeout.execution=120\r\n{noformat}\r\nBy default a process will be terminated after 120 second.\r\n\r\nIn the case of fork creation, if it were to run too long we'd expect it to be terminated after (by default) 120 seconds. However because the command does not produce output as it is processing certain things (e.g. lots of refs) the system will assume the process is idle after 60 seconds and will terminate it.\r\n\r\nTo fix this we should look at not doing idle detection for the fork command, and instead just rely on the execution timeout. This will result in the command being terminated after (by default) 120 seconds, and not 60 seconds.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nThis problem was identified on a customer system where fork creation was slow due to a large number of tags & branches (~30,000). The problem is exacerbated by filesystem performance, and is going to be more common with NFS based storage where I/O latencies are typically between 200us to 1ms.\r\n\r\n # Host Bitbucket on slow storage (e.g. use a slow NFS server - AWS EFS is a good option to reproduce this)\r\n # Create a repository with many (e.g. 30,000) branches or tags\r\n # Use the Bitbucket UI to fork the repository\r\n\r\nI've tested this on 6.10 (as the oldest supported version currently) however the issue goes back further than that.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nFork process will be terminated after 120 seconds if it has not completed\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nFork process will be terminated after 60 seconds if it has not completed\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nIn the {{bitbucket.properties}} file increase the idle timeout to match the process execution timeout\r\n{noformat}\r\nprocess.timeout.idle=${process.timeout.execution}\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nSomewhat unrelated to the problem this bug describes, but.... in cases where it takes longer than 120 seconds it may be *also* necessary to increase the {{process.timeout.execution}}, for example:\r\n\r\n{noformat}\r\nprocess.timeout.execution=300\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nThis should however not be set arbitrarily high as it is a system protection mechanism and is designed to protect the system for unexpectedly long running processes confusing resources. In the case of the scenario described above, with large numbers of refs and slow NFS, a much better solution is to improve NFS performance and/or decrease the number of refs by deleting some branches or tags.",

      "description": "h3. Issue Summary\r\n\r\nThe participant selectors (either author or reviewer) on Pull Request page can exhaust DB connections. When finding either by author or reviewer, for each character typed a REST request is made. When subsequent characters are typed outstanding requests are cancelled, however this doesn't actually interrupt/cancel the operation on the server. As a result large numbers of concurrent request can be in flight.\r\n\r\nThis problem was seen on stash.a.c and on a few occasions has been the dominant cause of DB connection exhaustion. We should investigate:\r\n- Adding some debouncing\r\n- The efficiency of the query being executed\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Go to the Pull Request list page (/projects/<proj>/repos/<repo>/pull-requests)\r\n # Type a long strong, character at a time. For example \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\"\r\n\r\nTaking the above to an extreme (longer string) or if the database is slow can result in database connection exhaustion as for each character typed a GET request is made to /rest/api/latest/projects/<proj>/repos/<repo>/participants\r\n\r\nI've tested this on 7.14, but expect perhaps as far back as 7.0 would exhibit the same problem.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nThe participant selector is less prone to consume large numbers of database connections.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nLarge numbers of database connections are consumed. In the worse case connection exhaustion and:\r\n\r\n{noformat}\r\njava.sql.SQLTransientConnectionException: bitbucket - Connection is not available, request timed out after 15000ms\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nh3.
