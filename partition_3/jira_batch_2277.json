This causes extra effort for Support, since the current process, to just take the customer's file as it is and change the paths later, won't work anymore. \n\nCurrent workaround: Open XML file, search for OSPropertyEntry elements with propertyKey jira.path.attachments.use.default.directory and jira.path.index.use.default.directory, copy the value of the id attribute and search for the corresponding OSPropertyNumber elements with that id. Change their value from 0 to 1.\n\nThe task here is to support this fallback for the Studio importer as well.\n\n",

Atlassian Connect 1.0 [was released in March 2014|http://blogs.atlassian.com/2014/03/introducing-atlassian-connect-1-0/], and you can already get access to [more than 50 public add-ons today built using the platform|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/search?application=&category=&cost=&hosting=cloud&marketingLabel=].\r\n \r\nDue to stability and scalability reasons, we will not bundle additional third party add-ons with our Cloud offerings. But you should feel free to contact the vendors of your favourite add-ons to let them know that you would like them to create a Cloud version of the add-on! We will do our best to work together with the vendor to satisfy this request.\r\n \r\nSince we have no plans to bundle additional add-ons in Cloud, we are closing this issue.\r\n \r\nCheers,\r\nBartek\r\nJIRA Product Management\r\nbartek (at) atlassian (dot) com\r\n{panel}\r\n \r\n \r\n*Original request description:*\r\nRequest to bundle [Subversion JIRA plugin|https://studio.plugins.atlassian.com/wiki/display/SVN/Subversion+JIRA+plugin] into OnDemand.\r\n\r\nA plugin to integrate JIRA with Subversion.This plugin displays Subversion commit info in a tab on the associated JIRA issue. To link a commit to a JIRA issue, the commit's text must contain the issue key (eg. \"This commit fixes TST-123\u2009\"). \r\n\r\nRelated issues:\r\n- https://support.atlassian.com/browse/JST-14367\r\n\r\n",

      "description": "On unicorn, it will sometimes be necessary to start up a large number of instances on a server at the same time. This creates substantial load on the system, and causes applications to start up quite slowly, sometimes slow enough to trigger the plugin dependency resolution timeout in the plugin system. Most of the time this will cause the applications to start up in an unusable state.\n\nAttached are two log files, one where the atlassian template renderer failed to load within the timeout, causing many other plugins to fail to load ([^jira.log]), and the other where the atlassian notifier plugin fails to load, which causes the studio crowd plugin to fail to load ([^crowd.log]).\n\nInstead of continuing to start up in a broken state, the application should abort startup if a plugin fails to load. This way some sort of automatic recovery on unicorn could be implemented.\n\nThe workaround for this is to increase the plugin load timeout by using the jvm parameter {{-Datlassian.plugins.enable.wait=<seconds>}}.\n\nRelated links:\n* [http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRAKB/JIRA+Plugin+System+Timeout+due+to+'Timeout+While+Waiting+for+Plugin+to+Enable']\n* [http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/CONFKB/Plugins+are+Disabled+at+Startup+and+Various+Timeout+Errors+Appear+in+the+Logs+After+Startup]",

Atlassian Connect 1.0 [was released in March 2014|http://blogs.atlassian.com/2014/03/introducing-atlassian-connect-1-0/], and you can already get access to [more than 50 public add-ons today built using the platform|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/search?application=&category=&cost=&hosting=cloud&marketingLabel=].\r\n \r\nDue to stability and scalability reasons, we will not bundle additional third party add-ons with our Cloud offerings. But you should feel free to contact the vendors of your favourite add-ons to let them know that you would like them to create a Cloud version of the add-on! We will do our best to work together with the vendor to satisfy this request.\r\n \r\nSince we have no plans to bundle additional add-ons in Cloud, we are closing this issue.\r\n \r\nCheers,\r\nBartek\r\nJIRA Product Management\r\nbartek (at) atlassian (dot) com\r\n{panel}\r\n \r\n \r\n*Original request description:*\r\nWe would like the following plugin available as a standard one for jir Studio.\r\n\r\nIt would be hugely useful in creating recurring tasks.\r\n\r\nhttps://plugins.atlassian.com/plugin/details/28036\r\n",

      "description": "{panel:title=Status Update - July 2019|borderStyle=solid|borderColor=#cccccc|titleBGColor=#3572b0}\r\nAs announced at the last Atlassian Summit in April 2019, we have now expanded the global cloud footprint of the Atlassian Cloud to the following geographical regions:\r\n * EU (Frankfurt, Dublin - announced in May 2017)\r\n * APAC (Sydney, Singapore)\r\n * US (east, west)\r\n\r\nNew customers signing up to Jira and Confluence Cloud will be automatically provisioned into to the region closest to the customer. As usage patterns for that customer change, we will automatically move customer data to their region of best fit, to optimise overall product performance. From\u00a0[this blog:|https://www.atlassian.com/blog/platform/reach-for-the-cloud]\r\n{quote}We\u2019ve also improved the performance of our cloud products by doubling the number of AWS regions we support around the world. We started with the US (East and West Coast) and Dublin, then quickly expanded to include Sydney and Singapore. Most recently, we launched an AWS region in Frankfurt to improve performance for our European customers. Not only does this reduce latency and improve performance for our customers in these regions, but it also will soon enable us to offer a choice of data locality for our customers.\r\n{quote}\r\nFor more details please see:\r\n - [https://www.atlassian.com/blog/platform/reach-for-the-cloud]\r\n - [https://www.atlassian.com/trust/infrastructure]\r\n\r\nWith this update, we'll be closing this ticket as Resolved. We understand that certain customers will have more specific requests for regions not explicitly covered above, and we will track those requests under separate tickets.\r\n\r\nCheers\r\nNuwan\r\nAtlassian Product Management{panel}\r\n\r\n{panel:title=Status Update - June 2017|borderStyle=solid|borderColor=#cccccc|titleBGColor=#3572b0}\r\nAs announced at the last Atlassian Summit, a first European data-center (located in Ireland) is now available.\r\n\r\nYou can Sign-up for our public beta offering and be one of the first customers to have their data hosted in Europe by going to: [https://www.atlassian.com/trust/infrastructure]\r\n{quote}Atlassian cloud infrastructure expands to Europe\r\n Today, more than 75% of new Atlassian customers start with one of our cloud products, which means our cloud infrastructure must be up to the task. We are happy to announce that our cloud hosting infrastructure is going global, starting with the launch of a new European region in Ireland. After migration to this new infrastructure, our European cloud customers will experience improved performance and reduced latency.\r\n We know data privacy, security, and compliance are extremely important to our customers, and we are investing heavily in all of these areas. To reinforce this effort, we\u2019ve made a foundational change in our cloud platform over the last year and are now using AWS to host our services. This enables us to offer an increased variety of cloud deployment regions, with strong performance and local failover options.\r\n But this is just a start. We\u2019ll continue to add new cloud hosting regions around the world. If you are an existing JIRA and Confluence cloud customer and you are interested in migrating your data to Europe, you can [sign-up today|https://www.atlassian.com/trust/infrastructure].\r\n{quote}\r\nFor more details please see:\r\n - [https://www.atlassian.com/blog/announcements/a-defining-moment-for-global-teamwork]\r\n - [https://www.atlassian.com/trust/infrastructure]\r\n - [http://www.computerworlduk.com/cloud-computing/atlassian-launches-first-data-centre-in-europe-as-part-of-global-expansion-3658427/]{panel}\r\n\u00a0\r\nh3. \u00a0Original description:\r\n\r\nVarious EU, Russia and AU customers have expressed interest in the availability of Atlassian OnDemand instances hosted outside of the US. The main issue with the US hosted services is\r\n\r\n1) Network speed to/from locations across the pond. \r\n 2) Blocked content by China and Russia's national firewall\r\n\r\nThis ticket is simply to help gauge the overall interest.",

Firstly, the warning message should have an \"Are you completely sure?\" popup given there is no way to recover a deleted project. Also, it would be useful to display counts for the various items being deleted: n number of issues, x number of wiki pages, r bytes of source code. Finally, why not prompt the user to reassign issues, wiki pages, and source code. That way you could delete a project, but keep the wiki pages or issues or source if you want. It'd be a very nice convenience as well as a further safeguard against permanent loss of data.",

Atlassian Connect 1.0 [was released in March 2014|http://blogs.atlassian.com/2014/03/introducing-atlassian-connect-1-0/], and you can already get access to [more than 50 public add-ons today built using the platform|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/search?application=&category=&cost=&hosting=cloud&marketingLabel=].\r\n \r\nDue to stability and scalability reasons, we will not bundle additional third party add-ons with our Cloud offerings. But you should feel free to contact the vendors of your favourite add-ons to let them know that you would like them to create a Cloud version of the add-on! We will do our best to work together with the vendor to satisfy this request.\r\n \r\nSince we have no plans to bundle additional add-ons in Cloud, we are closing this issue.\r\n \r\nCheers,\r\nBartek\r\nJIRA Product Management\r\nbartek (at) atlassian (dot) com\r\n{panel}\r\n \r\n \r\n*Original request description:*\r\nInstall web seuqence diagram plugin for confluence. http://www.websequencediagrams.com/embedding.html\r\n\r\nSimple to use and rather nice light weight way of depicting execution paths using sequence diagrams. \r\n\r\n",
