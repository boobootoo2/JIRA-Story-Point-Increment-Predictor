When a check-in occurs the build finishes the first step (which has to be automatic), this marks the build as successful even though subsequent steps have not been attempted. This is problematic when a pull request is started as we also have a branch permission set to require a successful build. The trivial build with only the first step complete satisfies the successful build rule making the rule effectively useless.\n\nExpected Result: The successful build rule is not satisfied until a paused or incomplete build is fully complete.\n\n* This is done for 2 main reasons. 1. We wish to encourage regular check-in but also not use up build minutes. 2. The build uses external limited resources so we also limit concurrent builds by making it a deployment (this is a hack but there is no other way to limit concurrent builds using pipelines).",

This look to be an attempt to emulate the widely used PR workflow used with git branches. The problem is that HG branches are _NOT_ the equivalent of git branches, rather bookmarks are, this is clearly stated in [https://www.mercurial-scm.org/wiki/Bookmarks](Link URL).\n\nThis means our mercurial workflow is borked when using BB, as we rely on bookmarks as opposed to heavy weight branches. This manifests itself as automatic updating of an outstanding pull request to a master repo whenever _any_ bookmark on the same branch is pushed to the source repo. This is not helpful behaviour and continually causes us problems and is near impossible to work around without adding in extra staging repos. And no we aren&#x27;t going to use mercurial branches, they suck in comparison with bookmarks, we&#x27;d go to git first, which we don&#x27;t want to do.\n\nTo get the equivalent workflow for a git repo, pull requests need to be issued against hg bookmarks as well as hg branches.

      "description": "Hi,\n\nwe have a pretty standard workflow in Bitbucket using Hg. We have a master repo in bit bucket and everyone working on that project has their own private fork of that repo in bitbucket that they use for work in progress. We typically using mercurial bookmarks to track our work. When some work is complete, a dev issues a pull request to the master repo, that&#x27;s reviewed and merged/rejected. All good. However, if the dev pushes a second changeset to their private repo before an outstanding pull to the master repo is accepted, that outstanding pull request is automatically updated to include the new changeset. It also does this silently and the dev doing the pull request is not notified.\n\nThis is beyond annoying. Is there a way to stop bitbucket pull requests automatically updating for mercurial? If not, could you please put that in as an option we can turn on. This has caused several problems for us.\n\nthanks\n\nBruno",
