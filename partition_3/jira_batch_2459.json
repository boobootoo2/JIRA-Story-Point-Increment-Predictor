Why on earth would they return a single date and the one you choose isn&#x27;t the {{author date}}?\n\nThis is the difference ([source|https://alexpeattie.com/blog/working-with-dates-in-git]):\n\nbq. As the Pro Git Book explains: The author is the person who originally wrote the work, whereas the committer is the person who last applied the work. So if, for instance, you send in a patch to a project, the author date will be when you made the original commit but the committer date will be when the patch was applied.\n\n\nWhy is this important? because all modern devs don&#x27;t push commits until they&#x27;re ready. Usually any dev just commits changes atomically and then pushes them end of day or week or every few hours.\n\nThe problem is right now the stats shows people with over 60 commits per day when in reality they are distributed among several days.\n\nHow long will it take you guys to return both dates?",

The main reason being that Confluence breaks up the workflow a little bit, and it&#x27;s not comfortably accessible.\n\nThe feature I&#x27;d like to add is adding a more user-friendly WYSIWIG option, that a user could just type text with formatting -- just as they do in Confluence, but in BitBucket&#x27;s Wiki section. We have some team members that don&#x27;t know Markdown, and it would be a bit of a chore to have them switch to using it.",

I can&#x27;t even {{CTRL+F}} to find it since the feed lazy loads. So, I end up mashing {{END}} until I hit the bottom of the feed. Then I {{CTRL+F}} to find a comment. But if replying to a comment or editing one made its whole thread appear at the top of the feed, I could spend more time actually reviewing prs instead of managing them.\n\nIf I add a comment on someone else&#x27;s pr, I have to send them a link to the comment when they&#x27;ve forgotten about it. If the feed were sorted by recent activity, though, I could just reply to my own comment (e.g. \"Reminder to look at this.\"), which would make that whole thread appear at the top of overview feed.",
