to a PR, we iterate all existing participants and search by their name attribute and resolve participants by a given role and set of the user name. Successful resolution yields the participant entity to the result set. In case if one or more participants can't be resolved, then it throws _InvalidPullRequestReviewersException_ and throws the below error in the Bitbucket UI.\r\n\r\nThe current error message \"_Errors encountered while adding some reviewers to this pull request_\" seems misleading and needs a change to include a better error in the UI so that users can better understand what the problem is.\r\n\r\n*Support Replication:*\r\n We are able to replicate the issue by adding invalid users to the reviewer's list during PR.\r\n The error pops up while editing the PR and once we remove the invalid user the operation is successful.\r\n",

This shows you the commit subject, a snippet of the rest of the commit message, and has a link to view the contents of the commit (with the commit hash as the text of the link). Clicking this link takes you to the \"diff\" view for that commit. However, none of these shows you the *full commit message*.\r\n\r\nThe closest thing we have right now is hovering over the commit line in the \"commits\" view, which shows the full commit message in a little hover message. However, this is difficult to read, does not display any markdown formatting, and wraps the lines somewhere around 58 characters (at least on my machine).\r\n\r\nMany people, including myself, consider the commit message to be as vital a part of the pull request as the content of the pull request. However, today, if I want a nice view of the commit message, I have to click the \"Commits\" button on the left sidebar, choose the branch the pull request is based from, then click the commit.\r\n\r\nCan we either A) show the full commit message in the \"diff\" view of the pull request \"mode\" or B) add a button to the \"commits\" view in the pull request \"mode\" to navigate to the regular \"commits\" mode view of that commit?\r\n\r\nSomething to this effect would be greatly appreciated.",

This causes actions which use this output to timeout and fail (e.g. loading the commits page in the UI).\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Push a commit (or commits) with extremely long commit messages (millions of characters, hundreds of thousands of lines) to a repository in Bitbucket Server.\r\n # Attempt to perform an action that causes Bitbucket Server to run a {{git rev-list}} command over those commits (e.g. viewing the commits page in the UI for that repository).\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nThe {{git rev-list}} command completes quickly (~seconds, or less), and the associated action (e.g. viewing the commits page in the UI) completes successfully without any problems.\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nThe {{git rev-list}} command takes an excessive amount of time to complete (multiple minutes). This will lead to for example REST requests timings out (so the UI for the commits page will show a 500 error after waiting for the commits).\r\n\r\nThe below exception is thrown in the {{bitbucket.log}} file:\r\n{noformat}\r\nc.a.b.i.p.nu.NioNuProcessHandler [/opt/git/bin/git rev-list --format=%H%x02%P%x02%aN%x02%aE%x02%at%x02%cN%x02%cE%x02%ct%n%B%n%x03END%x04 --no-min-parents --stdin --]: Dropping callback invocation (Canceled: false; Timed out: true)\r\nc.a.b.i.p.nu.NioNuProcessHandler [/opt/git/bin/git rev-list --format=%H%x02%P%x02%aN%x02%aE%x02%at%x02%cN%x02%cE%x02%ct%n%B%n%x03END%x04 --no-min-parents --stdin --]: Dropping callback invocation (Canceled: false; Timed out: true)\r\nc.a.b.i.p.nu.NioNuProcessHandler [/opt/git/bin/git rev-list --format=%H%x02%P%x02%aN%x02%aE%x02%at%x02%cN%x02%cE%x02%ct%n%B%n%x03END%x04 --no-min-parents --stdin --]: Dropping callback invocation (Canceled: false; Timed out: true)\r\nc.a.s.i.w.HandlerExceptionResolverImpl An error occurred while executing an external process: process timed out\r\ncom.atlassian.bitbucket.ServerException: An error occurred while executing an external process: process timed out\r\n\tat com.atlassian.bitbucket.scm.git.command.GitCommandExitHandler.evaluateThrowable(GitCommandExitHandler.java:120)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.bitbucket.scm.git.command.GitCommandExitHandler.onError(GitCommandExitHandler.java:208)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.stash.internal.scm.git.command.revlist.RevCoreExitHandler.onError(RevCoreExitHandler.java:55)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.bitbucket.scm.DefaultCommandExitHandler.onExit(DefaultCommandExitHandler.java:32)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.bitbucket.internal.process.nu.NioNuProcessHandler.callExitHandler(NioNuProcessHandler.java:285)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.bitbucket.internal.process.nu.NioNuProcessHandler.finish(NioNuProcessHandler.java:326)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.bitbucket.internal.process.nu.NioNuProcessHandler.onExit(NioNuProcessHandler.java:123)\r\n\tat com.zaxxer.nuprocess.internal.BasePosixProcess.onExit(BasePosixProcess.java:319)\r\n\tat com.zaxxer.nuprocess.linux.ProcessEpoll.handleExit(ProcessEpoll.java:375)\r\n\tat com.zaxxer.nuprocess.linux.ProcessEpoll.cleanupProcess(ProcessEpoll.java:334)\r\n\tat com.zaxxer.nuprocess.linux.ProcessEpoll.process(ProcessEpoll.java:272)\r\n\tat com.zaxxer.nuprocess.internal.BaseEventProcessor.run(BaseEventProcessor.java:81)\r\n\tat com.zaxxer.nuprocess.linux.ProcessEpoll.run(ProcessEpoll.java:188)\r\n\tat com.zaxxer.nuprocess.linux.LinuxProcess.run(LinuxProcess.java:114)\r\n\tat com.zaxxer.nuprocess.linux.LinProcessFactory.runProcess(LinProcessFactory.java:50)\r\n\tat com.zaxxer.nuprocess.NuProcessBuilder.run(NuProcessBuilder.java:273)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.bitbucket.internal.process.nu.NuNioProcessHelper.run(NuNioProcessHelper.java:75)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.bitbucket.internal.process.NioCommand.call(NioCommand.java:52)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.stash.internal.commit.DefaultCommitService.getCommits(DefaultCommitService.java:450)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.stash.internal.commit.DefaultCommitService.getCommits(DefaultCommitService.java:175)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.stash.internal.web.repos.RepositoryController.getCommits(RepositoryController.java:218)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.applinks.core.rest.context.ContextFilter.doFilter(ContextFilter.java:24)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.applinks.core.rest.context.ContextFilter.doFilter(ContextFilter.java:24)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.applinks.core.rest.context.ContextFilter.doFilter(ContextFilter.java:24)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.applinks.core.rest.context.ContextFilter.doFilter(ContextFilter.java:24)\r\n\tat com.atlassian.applinks.core.rest.context.ContextFilter.doFilter(ContextFilter.java:24)\r\n        ...\r\nCaused by: com.atlassian.utils.process.ProcessTimeoutException: process timed out\r\n\tat com.atlassian.bitbucket.internal.process.nu.NioNuProcessHandler.callExitHandler(NioNuProcessHandler.java:269)\r\n\t... 52 common frames omitted\r\n{noformat}\r\nh3.

Issue Summary\r\n\r\nWhen a user's group memberships are updated on login for a delegated user directory, using the \"Synchronize group memberships\" option, the following method is called:\r\n\r\n{code}\r\ncom.atlassian.crowd.directory.DelegatedAuthenticationDirectory.importGroupsAndMemberships\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nThis results in {{insert}} and {{delete}} operations that invalidate the group membership Hibernate query cache. The entire group membership query cache is invalidated, for all users. This results in any subsequent user->group membership queries going directly to the database until the cache is repopulated. With frequent group membership modifications, the high frequency of these cache invalidations significantly increases database load.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n# Login as user A who has no memberships to be updated. Note the number of selects to the following tables:\r\n{code}\r\ncwd_membership\r\ncwd_group\r\ncwd_user\r\n{code}\r\n# Login as user B, who has a large number of group memberships to update, and confirm memberships are updated for this user.\r\n# Login again as user A. Note again the number of selects performed on the Crowd tables.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nDatabase performance when \"Synchronize group memberships\" is enabled should be similar to when it is disabled.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nDatabase performance is substantially worse with \"Synchronize group memberships\" enabled, due to the high frequency of cache invalidation.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n\r\nCurrently there is no known workaround for this behavior. A workaround will be added here when available.",
