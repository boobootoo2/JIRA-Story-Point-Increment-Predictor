For example, if there is a bookmark master, we can not create a pull request from this bookmark (which is what we want) so we cannot see the message {{There are no changes to be pulled}}. The problem is then that the bookmark master is not updated and doesn&#x27;t follow the tip of the default branch of the main repository._\n\n_We would really need such master (or @) bookmark following the tip of the default branch of the main repository to easily update the cloned repositories to this point to start a new work._",

The act of creating a pull request could be considered the creating user approving his code (why would they create the PR otherwise?).\n\nTaking into account that some people might have a use for this (from my perspective) odd behavior, I would suggest to make this configurable, somewhere near the required number of approvals field in the branch permissions page.\n\nAs a workaround we&#x27;re currently requiring 2 approvals on PR&#x27;s, and asking users to immediately approve their PR after they&#x27;ve created it, but explaining that to a developer is really hard...",
