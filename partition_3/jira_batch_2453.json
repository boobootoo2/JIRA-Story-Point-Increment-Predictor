The branches are based on our versioning scheme (specifically the branch names are 11.4, 11.5, 11.6, and 11.7). In order to not have to add new rules for every version I set the branch permissions pattern to 11.? to match both cases (recognizing that higher than 11.9 will not work since ? only matches a single character). I apply the permissions as shown in the screenshot, but my user (an admin to the repository) is still able to create a pull request and merge it without any approvals as shown. Using 11.* works perfectly fine, but catches additional branches we don&#x27;t want it to lock down. It seems that the ? wildcard character doesn&#x27;t work as the documentation describes for branch permissions. https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/branch-permission-patterns-776639814.html",

Configuration:\nI am running an instance of Bitbucket v5.3.1 in a Docker container using the image published to the atlassian Docker Hub account:\n\nhttps://hub.docker.com/r/atlassian/bitbucket-server/\n\nThis is run behind a [Caddy|https://caddyserver.com/] reverse proxy that handles HTTPS encryption.\n\nh3. Issue:\nWhen trying to search, I get the error message: \"Search is currently unavailable\". Looking at my server settings in the administration panel, the Test button under the Search section would say that there was an authentication problem.\n\nh3. Resolution:\nI ran Bitbucket&#x27;s log analyzer which noticed the problem with search and referred me to this troubleshooting page:\n\nhttps://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserverkb/troubleshooting-steps-for-bitbucket-server-code-search-827125334.html\n\nFollowing the troubleshooting page, I first verified that Elasticsearch was starting and that my username and password were correct. Diving deeper, one of the steps is to check that you can connect to port 7992 locally, and to verify the Elasticsearch configuration is valid. The sample configuration was:\n\n{code}\n[root@mybbs search]# cat elasticsearch.yml\ncluster.name: bitbucket_search\nnode:\n  name: bitbucket_bundled\n  local: true\n\nnetwork.host: _localhost_\n\ndiscovery.zen.ping.multicast.enabled: false\n\naction.auto_create_index: false\nindex.mapper.dynamic: false\nhttp.port: 7992\n{code}\n\nMy configuration matched the example except for an extra line at the end:\n\n{code}\ntransport.tcp.port: 7993\n{code}\n\nI could not find anywhere in the setup documentation that mentioned openning port 7993. After mapping this port to the host machine and restarting the container running Bitbucket, search worked again and no longer shows up as an issue in the log analyzer.",

      "description": "I like the idea of enabling Automatic Merge of on release branches back to the main development branch, but in practice I find that it does not work as well as I had hoped.\n\nThe problem is that I will create a release branch off of our main development branch, and will make a few tweaks to the build configuration files, specific to the release under preparation. Some time later, I may commit a bug fix, which I also want committed back into my main development branch. I have enabled the automatic merge feature, but when I commit and merge my bug fix through a pull request, it opens a new Pull request merging the entire release branch back into my development branch. This means all the configuration changes that were made to prepare the release branch are now getting targeted into the main development branch, which could cause issues with clobbering over a release (through mvn site-deploy) if gone uncaught.\n\nPerhaps it is an issue with the way our code is organized, but I feel like we can&#x27;t be the only team hitting this type of issue?\n\nIt seems like one possibility, would be to open a new Pull Request that cherry-picks just the commits that were part of the bug fix pull request.\n\nLikewise, sometimes you know that the commit going into a release branch cannot be merged as-is back to the development branch, so it would be great to be able to deselect specific branches from having a PR opened. For example, say you have a bug fix pull request targeting release/1.2.0, and the result of the Automatic Merge is that it will trickle down into release/1.2.1, release/1.3.0, and master:\n\n{code}\n#!text\n\nrelease/1.2.0 (target of PR)\n|-- release/1.2.1\n|--|-- release/1.3.0\n|--|--|-- master\n{code}\n\nYou can see all these branches in the Pull Request Merge dialog when Automatic Merges are enabled, but there is no way to de-select release/1.3.0 and master branches from obtaining the fix. In some cases you may be dealing with a bug fix that was only applicable for a couple of releases.",
