If bitbutcket ever had an SVG on the page for any reason this error would re-appear.\n\nIt&#x27;s also worth making this dimming optional, such that an error in this function does not prevent the page from being used at all.

      "description": "This relates to the [blog post|https://blog.bitbucket.org/2011/05/13/dress-up-your-repository-with-a-readme/] made by @jespern.\n\nh2. Big Picture\nLooking to write technical documentation that references variables defined in external files and have the dereferenced values interpolated/woven into an output document format. When the output document is rendered as HTML for a BitBucket project page, for example, the variable references should be substituted with values from those definition files.\n\n----\nh2. Replicate\nConsider the following Markdown (e.g., {{README.md}}):\n\n{code}\n![Logo]($application.directory.images$/logo.png)\n$application.title$\n===\n$application.description$\n![Screenshot]($application.directory.images$/screenshot.png)\n{code}\n\nAlong with the following standalone variable definition file:\n\n{code}\napplication:\n  title: Application\n  directory:\n    images: images\n  description: $application.title$ is almost as amazing as BitBucket.\n{code}\n\nUsing YAML as the variable definition source is arbitrary. A factory design pattern based on some criteria (such as the file name extension) would allow definitions in JSON, TOML, XML, or any other machine-readable format.\n\nh2. Expected Results\n{code}\n![Logo](images/logo.png)\nApplication\n===\nApplication is almost as amazing as BitBucket.\n![Screenshot](images/screenshot.png)\n{code}\n\nh2. Actual Results\nNo substitution is preformed, so the {{README.md}} file is displayed as:\n\n{code}\n![Logo]($application.directory.images$/logo.png)\n$application.title$\n===\n$application.description$\n![Screenshot]($application.directory.images$/screenshot.png)\n{code}\n\n----\nh2. Additional Details\nPrior to the markdown (e.g., {{README.md}}) being rendered into HTML for display, another link in the [process chain|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain-of-responsibility_pattern] performs a simple [Aho-Corasick|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aho%25E2%2580%2593Corasick_algorithm] substitution for the interpolated variable values within the document. The document is then rendered into HTML as normal.\n\nPart of the problem is that the variables must be able to reference other variables, with a variable interpolator to extract the correct dereferenced value (see {{$application.description$}}, above).\n\n----\nh2. Variable Name Delimiters\nAnother issue is that it should be possible to define the variable delimiters and separators, such as:\n\n* {{{{ application.title }}}} -- {{{{}} and {{}}}} with a {{.}} separator;\n* {{$application.title$}} -- {{$}} and {{$}} with a {{.}} separator; or\n* optionally,  {{`r#x( v$application$title )`}} -- {{`r#x( v$}} and {{)`}} with a {{$}} separator, which would be useful for evaluating inline R statements, evaluated using [knitr|https://yihui.name/knitr/].\n\n----\nh2. Not a Template Language\nWhat is being proposed is not another template language, but two related ideas.\n\nFirst, variable substitution for arbitrary definitions using a dot-separated notation and recursive interpolation. Second, the ability to set a prefix and suffix delimiter used for finding and replacing variables with a [resolved value map|https://github.com/DaveJarvis/scrivenvar/blob/master/src/main/java/com/scrivenvar/definition/yaml/YamlParser.java#L185].\n\nI&#x27;ve developed both of these in Java. The first is about [19 lines of code|https://bitbucket.org/djarvis/yamlp/src/master/src/main/java/com/whitemagicsoftware/yamlp/Main.java%3Ffileviewer%3Dfile-view-default#Main.java-231]. The second requires a kind of [variable decorator pattern|https://github.com/DaveJarvis/scrivenvar/tree/master/src/main/java/com/scrivenvar/decorators], which is also fairly trivial in terms of LoC (fewer than 50 lines).\n\nCode that deals with variable substitution sometimes hard-codes variable delimiters in multiple places, which is a violation of DRY. Using a constants is better practice, but still violates DRY when those constants are referenced in multiple places, rather than being constructed dynamically using a factory pattern based on some arbitrary criteria (such as a file name extension).",

We had two branches with open PR&#x27;s to merge into another feature branch. Unfortunately these branches show on this page that they have no PR.\n\nThis is easy to recreate. Create branch 1 with PR to merge into develop. Create branch 2 with PR to merge into branch 1. Look at branches page. It will show PR only for branch 1.\n\nThis is just the basic branches page and the URL is like this:\\\\\nhttps://bitbucket.org/companyname/repositoryname/branches/?search=feature\n\nWe initially submitted this to Bitbucket Cloud Support and Atlassian responded that the design of the Branch View page is to only show Pull Requests to merge into the main branch.  In our opinion, this is not an acceptable resolution. If we set the main branch to anything but develop then it will display all of the other feature branches as not having a PR. Why would we only want to see branches without a PR to develop? The page says branches without a PR but that&#x27;s not what it is. Instead it is \"branches without a PR directly to the main branch\" which is not particularly useful. Why would anyone want to tacitly ignore PRs merging to non-default branches?\n\nAtlassian suggested that we post this here \"to allow our developers who would be in a better position to advise on this matter as well as for you to engage in a discussion and forward your opinions and thoughts.\"",

What currently works\n* Pull request merge dialog contains a dropdown that can be used to choose between having a merge commit and just squashing all your commits on top of the destination.\n* The default commit message changes based on how one wants to do the merge. In the case of squash merges, we use a combination of the commit messages of all the commits being squashed. Obviously, the user should probably edit this commit message, but the default is a good start.\n\nh3. Known missing functionality\n* -The merge dialog in the branch details page, branch list page and compare page does not yet support squashing. These will be rolled out in the coming weeks.- (done)\n* -Mercurial support for squash merges is planned, but will be implemented after all the merge dialogs are fixed.- (we&#x27;re planning on supporting obsolescence markers for this, so it&#x27;ll be split into a separate beta feature later).\n* -API support is missing.-\n* -Public documentation has not been updated yet (obviously this should be the last task).-",
