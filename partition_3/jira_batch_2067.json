This means that a single user can be involved in many projects. I have also set up confluence as their document repo, and added team calendars as well. Its a 5 user pilot currently. One thing from team calendar, which this issue appears to address, but could go a little further, is the requirement to specify a project. If we could specify a saved filter in JIRA rather than a project we could see multiple projects with a single add. Some intelligence to add different colours for all projects would be nice too{quote}",

Support answers the same questions every week explaining the difference in the new TC. Customers typically go to a page and try to Insert Macro > Team Calendar and then try to create the calendar on the fly on that specific page. Then when support directs the customer to the documentation mentioned above, customers still don't get it.\n\nI would recommend adding an informative message to the box to insert macro > team calendar with something like:\n\n(i) If you have not yet created the calendar you are trying to add to this page, navigate to User Menu > Calendar > Add Calendar and create the calendar first. You can then insert a macro on this page referencing the target calendar. \n\nWhile some customers understand the new process, I would say at least 5-10 tickets a week are created to address this or the question is asked in conjunction with an existing support request. It is time consuming to explain the same thing over and over and I don't believe our documentation does a good job explaining how to create a calendar. 'Adding a Calendar' should be one of the first sections in the docs since this would be the first thing users do when using TC for the first time.\n\n",

For example, an organizer might create an event calendar for a conference which is scheduled several months into the future, such as January 2013. The lead organizer might want to create a wiki page where other planners can view the latest schedule for the conference, and contribute to its updates. It would be easier for everyone to show the month of the conference on this wiki page by default, instead of showing the current, empty month, and requiring organizers to manually scroll to the correct month each time they load the page.\n\nThanks for considering it!",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFSERVER-51054].\n  {panel}\n\nWhen I render a team calendar in a page using the Team Calendars macro, the color scheme for that calendar is inherited from (and can only be changed by) the creator of the calendar. This is a poor implementation choice because it requires that I know who created the calendar if I want the color scheme changed. That's usually not practical. \n\nOne useful approach would be to allow the calendar macro to accept a color parameter. \n\n",

This issue can prolly be broken up into sub issues - but I will leave that up to someone else to do. \n\nI really love what jira and confluence has done to our workflow but at the same time it has also hurt our workflow with simple, yet missing, features.\n\n1: Reminders. It is ultimately important that people get reminded about an events if a reminder is setup in a calendar. Many people are mobile now days and subscribe to the team calendars or a personal calendar. For instance I am out of the office in meetings all the time and with the new team calendars I never get reminded of my next meeting. This is quite annoying as it is something that I rely on a daily basis. Why such a simple and powerful feature is missing escapes me.\n\n2: Making changes to the calendar. Again being mobile quite a bit I may have a client call and want to change their appointment to another time. I have my phone subscribed - but I can't make changes in my phones calendar and therefore I have to resort to going to the website and putting in my login information etc and making the change. This adds time and unnecessary steps.\n\n3: Adding the time to the fields is a bit cumbersome sometimes. When I enter time into the team calendars I always have to remember to type it in properly in military time. When in other systems a simple drop down of time broken up in 15 minute blocks I can easily select from.\n\nThese 3 above are so utterly important - not just to use (who come from using Google Calendar) but I am almost certain for many other people as well.\n\nI hope that these get implemented soon.",
