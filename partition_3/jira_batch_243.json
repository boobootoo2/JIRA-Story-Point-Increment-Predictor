Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n# Make sure the 'Scheduling Permissions' checkbox is unchecked\r\n# Remove the user from the 'Schedule Issues' project permission\r\n# Ensure the user has 'Resolve Issues' permission\r\n# Go to the Classic Planning Board, and try to change the version of a card\r\n\r\nA video has been attached for easier replication\r\n\r\nh3.
