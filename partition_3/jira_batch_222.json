This is good, because I know what will happen to this issue.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, this breaks when the issue cannot be transitioned to some of the statuses of the column: If there is only one target status left, that status is no longer shown. In this case, it is incredibly hard to predict to which status the item will transition to. E.g. in our fairly normal workflow, it is for example not possible to stop progress on an item which you are not assigned to. \r\n\r\nThe customers would want to be able to transition the issues over the workflow using board without the need to have in mind a complex workflow.\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\nA workaround is to pick a workflow which allows all transitions (or even using the Jira Agile Simplified Workflow), but since our \"global issue tracking project\" is centrally managed, this is not something I can influence.\r\n\r\nSo, I'd expect that the target status is always shown when dragging items to a column with multiple statuses. Optionally, the target statuses could also simply always be shown. Another option would be to also show statues to which one cannot transition (e.g. in red) and display an explanation if someone should drop the item there. \r\n",

The board works perfectly except when I have a limited number of issues showing (i.e. when users select certain quickfilters). When there only 1 or 2 issues on the board it is seemingly impossible to drag and drop into the transitions that appear at the top or the bottom of the status column. I have workarounds so can deal with without abandoning the board but it's not great for users. \r\n\r\nI have raised this with the JIRA consultants working with us here in Australia (Atlassian partner - Service Rocket) and they suspect it is a bug in JIRA. This is why I'm raising it here.",

For example, for whatever statistic type is chosen for a Pie Chart gadget, we would like the ability to show the total story points for each type instead of issue counts. Or for the Two Dimensional Filter Statistics gadget, there should be an option to show the data in terms of story points instead of issue counts. The idea is to show data in terms of a story point budget.\r\n\r\nIn Jira Agile, even if the estimation statistic for a board is set to Story Points, there's no agile report that can show the data we're looking for.

What it means is that when you click on the _Agile_ tab, nothing happens:\r\n!agile_1.JPG|thumbnail!\r\n\r\n* To double check on this, we navigated to the *Manage add-ons* page but we can confirm that JIRA Agile is not installed:\r\n!agile_2.JPG|thumbnail!\r\n\r\n* We proceed to download and install the latest JIRA Agile 6.3.8.1:\r\n!agile_3.JPG|thumbnail!\r\n\r\n* This is where it gets interesting. As we can see in the screen shot, we have 2 _Agile_ tabs. The one on the *left* links is the broken tab and the one on the *right* points to the correct link:\r\n!agile_4.JPG|thumbnail!\r\n\r\n* After that, we proceed to uninstall JIRA Agile from the instance:\r\n!agile_5.JPG|thumbnail!\r\n\r\n* Both _Agile_ tabs are not present in the menu anymore:\r\n!agile_6.JPG|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nh5. Update\r\nApparently JIRA 6.2 rc1 introduces a system plugin called *JIRA Agile Marketing Plugin* which displays the Agile tab after the installation is completed:\r\n!agile_marketing.JPG|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nIf this plugin is disabled, the \"broken\" Agile tab will not appear. Perhaps there should be a clearer indication that this is exclusively a marketing plugin rather than the Agile plugin itself so that there is no confusion for JIRA Agile users.",

      "description": "h5. Background\r\nAs of now, the [Report mode|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/AGILE/Using+Report+Mode] in JIRA Agile shows the *Status Report* section (excluding Burndown Chart) as the following:\r\n* Completed Issues\r\n* Incomplete Issues\r\n\r\n!version_report.JPG|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nThis explains why the progress of the reports (Sprint. Version, and Epic) are tracked by the two options, either the issue is resolved / completed or it is not (not by the actual progress of the issue)\r\n\r\nUnlike Burndown Chart, it shows the complete progress of each issue that belongs the particular sprint, allowing users to track the changes in the Estimation:\r\n!burndown_chart.JPG|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nThe _Remaining Estimate and Time Spent_ in *Time Tracking* will only be taken into consideration for [Burndown Chart|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/AGILE/Viewing+the+Burndown+Chart] only.\r\n!estimation.JPG|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nh5. Expectation\r\nHow the reports should work is that:\r\n* The Version and Epic reports should reflect the _Remaining Estimate_. Why? Because the [estimated amount of work remaining|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/AGILE/Viewing+the+Version+Report] is directly provided in the Remaining Estimate.\r\n* The progress shown in the Version and Epic in the Plan mode reflects the _Remaining Estimate_ of the associated issues.\r\n* The Sprint report shows the _Remaining Estimate_ in addition to (or instead of) _Original Time Estimate_ in the Issues Not Completed section. The rationale behind knowing how much time the developer estimate remains is helpful to know when you are bumping issues from one sprint to another.\r\n\r\nThere is a current open request which is still *Open* but this is confined to Version Report only:\r\n* [Allow Version Report to show velocity based on Remaining time|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/GHS-8510]\r\n\r\nIn a nutshell, the *Remaining Time Estimate and Time Spent* should also be implemented as an option in other reports as well.",

      "description": "The VCI project has 4 Agile Boards that correspond to the Issue field \u201cRelease Vehicle\u201d as shown below.  All four board are differentiate by filters associated with them, they are extremely simple.  \r\nProject = VCI AND \u201cRelease Vehicle\u201d = <Release Vehicle> ORDER BY Rank ASC.\r\n\r\nWe have four expected values for \u201cRelease Vehicle\u201d\r\n\u2022\tUnallocated\r\n\u2022\tMajor Release\r\n\u2022\tTech Release\r\n\u2022\tHotfix\r\nAll new issues by default go to the Unallocated Release Vehicle and in turn to the Unallocated Agile Board/Backlog as configured by the JIRA team.  The Rank value is working properly (ranking to bottom of backlog) when the issue is created from the Unallocated Agile Board page or any JIRA page other than our other 3 Agile Boards.  When the issue is created while the user is viewing the VCI Major Release, Tech Release or Hotfix Agile Boards, the issue goes to the Unallocated Agile Board but has a rank value from the Agile Board the user is viewing.  This seems like a bug.  Also when issues are moved between boards, they are not ranked to the bottom of the new board, they maintain the rank from the previous board.  This is probably by design.\r\n\r\nTwo critical requests/questions to preserve integrity of Agile Boards backlog ranking for VCI project:\r\n* Can we configure the system such that if we are creating an issue for the VCI project while viewing an Agile Board other than VCI - Unallocated, it always gets ranked to the end of the VCI \u2013 Unallocated Agile Board (874)?\r\n* When we change the Release Vehicle of an issue, for example from Unallocated to Major Release, the issue carries over with the rank from the Unallocated (previous) Agile Board, causing it to be ranked inappropriately.  The desired behavior is for it to show up at the end of the backlog it\u2019s moved to.  In this example the issue may have had a rank of 222133 in the Unallocated Agile Board, and when moved to the Major Release Agile Board it will maintain rank 222133, when that rank places it towards the top of the Major Release Agile Board.\r\n \r\nRegards,\r\nAmit Singh",

      "description": "After upgrading JIRA Agile from 6.3.6.1 to 6.3.7 we had lost all sprint information. That's very-very SAD, but true.\r\n\r\nI had found similar issues with previous versions of JIRA Agile (GHS) and JIRA (user complains). *Noone of these issues were solved by finding bugs in GHS and _fixing_ them*. Please see [one|https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/114918/sprints-lost-after-jira-update] and [another one|https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/223279/sprints-lost-after-jira-update].\r\n\r\nI checked what was the fixed in 6.3.7 (what is the difference with 6.3.6.1), but seems [two tickets only|https://jira.atlassian.com/issues/?jql=project%20%3D%20GHS%20AND%20issuetype%20in%20(Bug%2C%20Story)%20AND%20resolution%20%3D%20Fixed%20AND%20fixVersion%20%3D%20%226.3.7%22%20AND%20status%20in%20(Resolved%2C%20Closed)%20ORDER%20BY%20priority%20DESC%2C%20key%20DESC%20%20%20]. But one ticket may be important - GHS-6927. Can it affect on that behaviour?\r\n\r\n(Just for info: we have no any duplicate custom fields; our JIRA is v6.1.5 and we using it a lot of monthes; previous GHS updates were successfull, without any problems).\r\n\r\nAs I remember, I updated GHS at 07 Feb 2014 at 22:14 using \"Manage Add-ons\" function of JIRA. When updating process working it \"crashed\" with some error (technical details were not written on screen). After that \"JIRA Agile\" menu was not shown in header. So I had restarted JIRA (stopped it and started).\r\n\r\nOr maybe another plugin may affect? For example, a fix for JIRA Gantt Chart - [JRAGANTT-235|http://www.jiraproject.com/jira/browse/JRAGANTT-235]? (This plugin was updated before updating JIRA Agile)\r\n\r\nWhat I have found in logs about JIRA Agile?\r\n# Update process (through UPM) of Grantt Chart Plugin [22:12] and then - JIRA Agile (GreenHopper) [22:14] - *see attach jira-atlassian.log* (there is some errors/crash of JIRA Agile - GreenHopper and information about updating custom fields)\r\n# Details of using/upgrade JIRA Agile (GreenHopper) - *see attached atlassian-greenhopper.log*\r\n\r\nProbably important info:\r\n\r\n{noformat}\r\n2014-02-07 22:15:29,043 JiraTaskExectionThread-1 ERROR xx 1335x28405x1 1sywz86 192.168.0.102 /secure/admin/jira/IndexReIndex.jspa [jira.issue.managers.DefaultCustomFieldManager] Could not load custom field type plugin with key 'com.pyxis.greenhopper.jira:gh-epic-color'.
