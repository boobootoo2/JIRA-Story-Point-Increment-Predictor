      "description": "Hi there,\n\nWe are currently utilizing Pipelines for our various environment builds (develop, test, prod). When a specific chunk of logic in our pipeline&#x27;s custom scripts fails, we fallback to rollback logic that reverts the repository back to HEAD~1 and pushing those changes to the repo, effectively undoing the merged branch.\n\nUnfortunately, when we rollback develop, test, or prod, we are re-committing back into the branch we just rolled back from. We can certainly early out in the newly triggered pipelines build, but we are forced to either show failure or success.\n\nIt would be nice to have some way to add a custom script that runs before pipelines kicks off, allowing one you early out and not even show pipelines in the portal.",

I read through the documentation, and had not realized that it was user name and not e-mail address alias that should be used.  After a few days I figured it out.

      "description": "I really like the \"edit online\" feature for minor changes. But when I was using it recently, I made a very small change but noticed that it changed _other_ parts of the file, parts I did not modify directly.\n\nReproduction steps:\n\n* Create a file with UTF-8 character \"\u00b1\" (hex 0xC2B1) outside of Bitbucket&#x27;s online editor.\n* Edit it online in Bitbucket and make a change elsewhere in the file.\n* Save it, and the character will be re-encoded as hex 0xB1 which is invalid UTF-8. I assume Bitbucket is treating the file as being in some other encoding. UTF-8 is not an exotic or rare encoding -- everywhere I&#x27;ve worked it has been the default, so I would expect Bitbucket to handle it properly.\n\nI have a public repository where I reproduced the bug. Here is the commit where the unwanted change happened:\n\nhttps://bitbucket.org/stephenrosenthal/online-edit-special-characters-test/commits/304ddb158965a489f6675865ca2bff32c3de6d65\n\nThanks!",
