The way the stages work makes this really nice because you HAVE to successfully deploy to staging before you even get the choice to deploy to production.\n\nHowever, we have multiple development environments and at present if we had multiple manual deployment stages for each development environment we would have to go through each one in order, ideally I would like to select a manual stage I would like to run and not have to go through previous manual stages to get there.\n\nA nice a logical way of doing this would be if you had multiple manual stages inside a parallel container, it would allow you run any of the manual stages in that group, completely unlinked from one another.",
