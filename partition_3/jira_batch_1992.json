Based on my observation, the following issues can be found:\r\n * The CSS are batched together, but single line comments (i.e., {{// comments}}) are not removed, so there are parts of the css where it's invalid. The whole minified CSS is a single line, so everything after the single line comment is commented out.\r\n * Some styles are being returned in LESS format instead of regular CSS.
