In case dev prefers linear history, the rebase approach is preferred. By doing this, comments that have already been made on the PR are now disconnected. It&#x27;s clear why this happens; there&#x27;s presumably a lookup between comments and commit sha1s and that get&#x27;s broken by the rebase/push -f (the same thing happens on github). Though because of the orientation of the approach those comments, which may well be important to the review are relegated to the \"activity\" tab where is gets buried in all the other screeds that get put there.",

Suggested Solution\nWhen a user accepts an invitation sent to an Email alias of their account, show a message  when they accept this invitation:\n\n# informing them that the invitation should be sent to the primary email of their account instead\n# also add in the message that alternatively, they can create a new Bitbucket account with the email alias",

Since introducing {{semantic-release}}, my {{release}} branch is named just that, _release_, without any other identifiers, as it comes clean from {{develop}} and gets deployed to staging environment.\n\nAs I now usually just create the release branch as {{release}}, I have noticed an weird error. If I delete the branch through the checkbox in a \"release to master\" PR, if I later create a new {{release}} branch, the comparison and PR tools do not detect that the new {{release}} branch has new code. It seems that it keeps a \"cached\" version of the old release branch and does not allow me to go on.\n\nTo work around the issue, I have to either create release branches with different names just because, or I have to forcefully delete the newly create release branch and re-create it. It then seems to \"clean up the cache\" and allow me to go on.\n\nI have added screenshots showing the clear difference between {{release}} and {{master}} branches in the commit section, and then failure to show the difference in the PR and compare tools.",

I am currently migrating all of our CI tooling from Jenkins to Bitbucket pipelines.\n\nThis particular repository uses Git LFS. I enabled the clone with Git LFS using the clone section of the pipeline. Here is my valid pipeline:\n\n{code}\nimage: zhughes3/ubuntu-ruby-node:latest\n\nclone:\n  lfs: true\n\npipelines:\n  custom:\n    manual:\n      - step:\n          script:\n            - pwd\n            - ls -al\n  branches: \n    develop:\n      - step:\n          script:\n            - pwd\n            - ls -al\n    release/*:\n      - step:\n          script:\n            - pwd\n            - ls -al\n{code}\n\nHere is the output from the Pipeline:\n\n{code}\n+ umask 000\n+ git clone -n https://x-token-auth:$REPOSITORY_OAUTH_ACCESS_TOKEN@bitbucket.org/$BITBUCKET_REPO_FULL_NAME.git $BUILD_DIR\nCloning into &amp;#39;/opt/atlassian/pipelines/agent/build&amp;#39;...\n+ git checkout 974062f284292a880b1d58c0278ffae1770cbf60\nDownloading B2C-Templates/iamtemplates/images/brand.png (8.7 KB)\nError downloading object: B2C-Templates/iamtemplates/images/brand.png (89e49e8): Smudge error: Error downloading B2C-Templates/iamtemplates/images/brand.png (89e49e8324d505aa0edb96593e241378b727c699efa99ffe4a305aef857c9e5f): [89e49e8324d505aa0edb96593e241378b727c699efa99ffe4a305aef857c9e5f] Object does not exist on the server: [404] Object does not exist on the server\nErrors logged to /opt/atlassian/pipelines/agent/build/.git/lfs/logs/20190722T161835.702758305.log\nUse `git lfs logs last` to view the log.\nerror: external filter &amp;#39;git-lfs filter-process&amp;#39; failed\nfatal: B2C-Templates/iamtemplates/images/brand.png: smudge filter lfs failed\n{code}\n\nWe had seen the same exact issue in Jenkins. To fix this, we had to enable a setting to manually run a {{git lfs pull &amp;lt;GIT_ORIGIN&amp;gt;}} after doing the {{git checkout <TAG>}} . How do I perform a {{git lfs pull}} in the above pipeline?\n\nAlso, I initially set the {{clone -> lfs: true}} after finding this [article|https://bitbucket.org/blog/git-lfs-now-available-bitbucket-pipelines]. In it, it talks about manually &-#34~~;include an appropriate Git client in your build image, and pull with SSH authentication to retrieve the files.&~~#34-; How would I do this if the pipeline automatically tries to clone the repository that the {{bitbucket-pipelines.yml}} file lives in?",
