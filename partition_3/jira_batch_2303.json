      "description": "Change some documentation links in the JIRA Studio and Confluence Hosted doc spaces on CAC, because of the upcoming Confluence 2.8 release. This is not a big task :) but needs to be coordinated with the Confluence 2.8 docs.\n\nWhen?\n* Tuesday 25 March. (We plan to declare the Confluence DOC space a 2.8 beta on Tuesday 25 March.)\n\nReason:\n* When Confluence 2.8 is released, the new Confluence UI will be quite different from the 2.8 UI.\n* This means that the Confluence docs (in space DOC on CAC) will reflect the new UI.\n* But the Hosted products will not migrate to Confluence 2.8 for a while.\n* The docs for Studio and Hosted contain summary/overview pages and then link to the main Confluence docs for further information. Currently, these links all point to the DOC space.\n\nTo do:\n* Change the links on the JIRASTUDIO Home page (http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRASTUDIO) and on any other affected pages in the User Guide etc: Instead of pointing to the DOC space, they should point to the CONF27 space.\n* Our ALLDOCS space (http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/ALLDOCS) must guide the Hosted and Studio users to download the 2.7 docs not the 2.8 docs. (PDF, XML and HTML versions.)\n\nNOTE: Space CONF27 already exists but is currently hidden. Will unveil when DOC space goes to 2.8 beta.\nhttp://confluence.atlassian.com/display/CONF27\n",

However if we're billing per user, customers might not want that.\n\nProbably we need to bounce the email back to the sender, with an explanation and instructions to contact the Studio admin.  This would require some new functionality added to the JIRA FileService.\n\nA variation on this is to bounce the email directly to the Studio admin. This would require porting MailServer's 'forwardEmail' support to FileService, and somehow arranging for the forwardEmail parameter value to be set. ",
