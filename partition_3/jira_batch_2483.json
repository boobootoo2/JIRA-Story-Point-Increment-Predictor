      "description": "Hello,\n\nsince the deprecation of POST or Pull Request POST services in bitbucket is impossible to find out from the payload which files where changed with the last commits. Originally you could retrieve this information from payload commits -> files array\n\nExample:\n\n----\nh2. \"files\":[\\\\\n{\\\\\n\"type\":\"modified\",\\\\\n\"file\":\"CHANGELOG\"\\\\\n},\\\\\n{\\\\\n\"type\":\"modified\",\\\\\n\"file\":\"README.md\"\\\\\n}\\\\\n],\nSince this service is deprecated there is not an alternative way to get this data. The new repo:push payload doesn&#x27;t have this information anymore nor other type of payloads.\n\nAlso there is no API equivalent call to retrieve only the file changed by the commit SHA1. Possible workaround would be to use the GET https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/{owner}/{repo_slug}/diff/{spec} API call and to parse the result looking for file changed, but it&#x27;s a hacky solution.\n\nHaving a feature like that can benefit automation tools and services which trigger certain action based on the files changes. Having this data as part of the payload avoid the need of having git / git library inspecting the repository itself for this information.",

      "description": "Hello,\n\nIs there any way in the new API 2.0 or Web-hooks components to get *a list of the files which were actually added/modified/deleted* in a commit (or in all commits which were pushed)?\n\nThe reason I&#x27;m asking is because I need to know how I can modify my [BitBucket Sync|https://bitbucket.org/alixandru/bitbucket-sync] project to work with the new API. BitBucket Sync is a lightweight PHP script, designed to run on a web-server, which can deploy repository files to the web-server as they are pushed to specific branches. Think of it as a super-lightweight CI server, which uses nothing but hooks and API calls to keep an web-site updated with what&#x27;s in the BitBucket repository.\n\nNow, a few words about how this script works: in order to reduce deployment time and bandwidth, the script copies over (from BitBucket to the web-server)* *only* those files which were ADDED and UPDATED* (instead of getting a zip with the entire repository content at each push).\n\nIn order for this to work, the script needs to know the list of files changed in each commit; and this information, unfortunately, is not available anymore in the new API.\n\nIs there any chance to include this piece of info in the new Web-hooks? If not, is there (or will there be) any API call to give me this info? Without it, the BitBucket Sync script would be pointless...\n\nLet me know if you need more information.\n\nThanks in advance!\\\\\nAlex\n\n----\nThe BitBucket Sync script can be accessed here: https://bitbucket.org/alixandru/bitbucket-sync\\\\\nDiscussion about this has also been started here: https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/BITBUCKET/Event+Payloads?focusedCommentId=774045711&#comment-774045711",

      "description": "It seems that with the fix for BCLOUD-6315, path-absolute links that used to resolve now are translated into broken links. For example, I used to link to issues in other projects like so: See [Setuptools 230|/pypa/setuptools/issues/230]. If that had been rendered by Bitbucket months ago, it would have resolved to the issue in the bitbucket project. Today, it resolves as a file in the source tree for project in which the issue was filed.\n\nI see that [at least one other person found the change problemmatic|BCLOUD-6315].\n\nI admit that the server-relative, path-absolute links may have been an incidental function that worked only because it relied on the browser&#x27;s link resolution convention (where path-absolute links are resolved server-relative). I suspect few users ever knew this function existed, and even fewer used it.\n\nHowever, the effect is that many of the comments I&#x27;ve made are now broken.\n\nI am mostly filing this report to create a record of the issue. It would be helpful if Bitbucket could run a report of posts (issue descriptions, wikis, and comments), preferably indexed by the user who made them, that make server-relative path references before the change was made. Then, I could go through the report and correct those comments. Even better would be to proactively re-write them with absolute HREFs.\n\nI acknowledge that might be a lot of work with a small payoff, so if you choose to close this as won&#x27;t fix, I understand, and I&#x27;ll correct the broken links as I encounter them.",

      "description": "Hi,\n\nBitbucket incorrectly calculates the number of users to charge you for. This is happening for me; but I will give an example of how it can happen to anyone.\n\n# I was invited to join a team, and then fork one of the repositories\n# As part of the standard review process, I am required to add-in a group which that team controls. It contains 3 members (I am well within my 5 user count).\n# work continues\n# They add additional people, bringing the number in the team *that they control* to 3000.\n\nWho should pay for those extra 3000 users? The currently bitbucket algorithm believes that _I_ should.\n\nI think the algorithm to determine users should be fairly simple:\n\n{code}\ndef users_chargable_on_repo(repo):\n    to_charge = count_direct_users(repo)\n    to_charge += count_users_within_groups_created_by_repo_forker(repo)\n{code}\n\nAnd then obviously you would tally up all users across all repos and then put into a set (so they aren&#x27;t duplicated), giving you a total number to charge.\n\nIn my case the number should be 2. Which is under the 5 free threshold.\n\nIf you are able to give me a (rough) outline of the current algorithm and\\\\\nsome test cases, I am sure I could easily come up with a correct solution\\\\\nfor you.\n\nAs you can imagine, I am highly motivated to fix this billing problem.\n\nThanks,\\\\\nAnand",

Tell your team in case they want to try it out too.\r\n\r\n!Screenshot 2020-03-03 15.57.48.png|thumbnail!\r\n\r\nNext time you accidentally push large files to Bitbucket, follow the [user guide|https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/reduce-repository-size-321848262.html] to reset the branch to just before the large commit. When you force push that refs-only change, the Labs feature will automatically run GC to immediately remove the large commit.\r\n\r\nThis should bring your Bitbucket repo below the size limit, allowing you to push commits again without having to raise a support request. Anyone else using the same repo who has pulled the large commit will need to create a fresh clone.\r\n\r\nNote that this won't work if your repo goes over 5GB.
