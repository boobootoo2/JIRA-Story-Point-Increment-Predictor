This can be useful for grabbing smaller subsets of large repositories at specific commits.\n\nSince allowReachableSHA1InWant only allows access to commits reachable from at least one ref, it&#x27;s not exposing any commits to which a remote client would not already have access; it just means they can fetch such commits directly, rather than having to fetch a ref (which may include a significant amount of unnecessary data in the resulting pack) and then checkout the desired commit.\n\nThis option will be specially useful to us to speed up the build in Bitbucket Pipelines.",

For example, it means I can only implement rules for the develop branch and those rules are the same if it is a feature branch or a release-x.y.z branches that should be merged.\n\nI would like to have a method for the developers to easily do the safe merges from stable branches to the lesser stable branches without having to go through pull requests and all of the merge checks.\n\nLink to the relevant repository: https://bitbucket.org/mirrobots/mir",

I&#x27;m still able to find the branch I&#x27;ve created a PR for when creating it and telling it to close the branch after merge (and code review).

Still no button at the bottom left. Seems like Jira knows about Bitbucket, but bitbucket doesnt.\n\nThat bugs me a lot even tho its a dumb problem.\n\nP.S.

I recently forked the repo to give it a dedicated repository for public releases, and Pipelines is telling me that the syntax is not valid because dev does not have the required script key. It absolutely does, and the engine that runs pipelines has no issue discovering it through the yml alias.\n\nHowever, whatever is authenticating the bitbucket-pipelines.yml before it has run at all is not parsing the yml correctly, and is apparently incapable of determining correct aliasing. This seems to only occur on a new repo that has not run pipelines at all yet, but detects a pipelines file.\n\nThis has caused problems getting my branches out of sync between the development master branch and the release master branch, because the site will not allow the repo to have ssh keys set without pipelines being configured when a pipelines file is present.\n\n*Relevant Uri Path:*\n\n_(only fires on an initial visit for a new repo that already has a pipelines file as outlined above)_\\\\\nhttps://bitbucket.org/projectname/reponame/addon/pipelines/home#!/getting-started\n\n*Repo where issue was noticed:*\n\nhttps://bitbucket.org/oroborosframework/oroboros-core-releases\n\n*Steps to reproduce:*\n\n* Clone an existing repo locally\n* Edit the bitbucket-pipelines.yml as shown above, so the *step* key is aliased between two branches.\n* Push the repo to a new empty repository on Bitbucket Cloud\n* Visit the Pipelines tab.
