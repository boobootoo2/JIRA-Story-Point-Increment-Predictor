Symptoms\n\nWhen a page name contains a special character, this character is included in the ID of any anchors on the page. When generating the URL for such anchors, Confluence is encoding any text to the right of the \\# using HTML entity escaping, but for this link to work, it must use URL encoding. This also happens if an anchor name contains a special character.\n\nFor example the apostrophe character:\n\n* The URL is currently replacing it with &#39;\n* The URL should be replacing it instead with %27 like it does on the left side of the \\#\n* The anchor is showing up correctly in the page source, as the apostrophe is not encoded inside the id attribute\n\nNote that whilst using special characters in an ID is [prohibited in XML|http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/#NT-NameStartChar] and thus XHTML, it's [perfectly fine for HTML5|http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/elements.html#the-id-attribute], which is used by Confluence, so any special characters do not need to be encoded inside the id attribute.\n\nh4. Steps to reproduce:\n\n1. Create a page named \"User's Resources\"\n2. Add an anchor to it, say \"shares\", a link to the anchor in the same page (or any other) and save\n3. Click the link\n4. No redirect is made (or if the link is in a different page, redirect is made only to the page, not the anchor)\n\nThis is the link:\n{code}<confluence_instance>/display/<space_name>/User%27s+Resources#User&#39;sResources-shares{code}\n\nThis behavior happens because of the special character used in the title - If the page is renamed without it, everything works.\n\nh4. Workaround\n\nIf this is caused by the page name, the only workaround is to rename that page to not have a special character.\n\nIf this is caused by the anchor name, you can work around this by manually URL-escaping the special character in the \"Link\" value in \"Advanced\" when creating the link.",

Like many websites on the internet, there is often a [Read on] or [Read More] link provided directly underneath of excerpt of the blog.\nCould you please add a [Read on] link, or something to that affect, directly underneath any blog posts that aren't fully displayed when in excerpt view? I feel this feature will provide that extra bit of guideance for end users to ensure they're reading the full blog post.\nPlease see the attachment .png mockup to see what I mean. Note the [Read on] placed directly after the blog post.\nthank you\nTim",

In confluence a lot of things are relying on bandana including core things like plugins state. When we made bandana caching persister fully transactional then we were getting plugin inconsistent states and other test failures across our builds. Decision was to leave it `as is` since other products (like jira) do not provide transactional caches anyway (like confluence does) anyway and values in caches will be poisoned on transaction failure.\n\nIf you still need transactional aware key->value storage you can use raw bandana manager (not wrapped with cached) and wrap it with transactional cache. It still will work for plugin code, it's just transactional bandana doesn't work for core confluence features.\n\n----\n*Side thought*\nGiven that transactional bandana manager is problem for confluence core we might just exposed two beans - one for plugin devs(transactional) and one for confluence core (non-transactional).",

Thank you for your patience and enthusiasm with this issue.  As always, feedback welcome. \n\nThanks, \nNatasha\n\n{panel}\n\nAs a Confluence user, it would be interesting to have the ability to see the the tasks you have assigned to other users.\nIt would be then helpful to have a \"nudge\" feature or some way to request an update to the task\n\nIf you are going to comment on this issue, we'd love to hear about your use cases so we can better understand how we can make this better",

I don't say this following example is everyday problem but *it will* rise *negative* attitude from users, towards the application.\n\nLet's see now.. ah yes, let's now think that we are trying to create a \"*how to*\" -documentation that looks *some what* professional. \n\n# Now you are in the point of creating *a step by step* list and you start to write the list open: \n{code}\n1. Browse there and do this\n   <Picture of the step possibly>\n2. Browse here and do that\n   a. This Section: Does many things and they are opened more below\n      * This button, will make world a happy place\n      * This button, will blow up the moon\n      * This button, will make you rich\n   <First braking point>\n   b. Configuration\n      * Here is the default values\n      <2x4 table>\n   <Second breaking point>\n{code}\n# In the *first braking point*: \n## You try to switch back to *numbered list* the counting starts again and it *won't let you* to change the \"*a.*\" to \"*b.*\". *Every time* you try it *reverts* back to \"*a.*\"\n## Now you are *getting frustrated*, and you put your cursor *end of* \"*This button, will make you rich*\" bullet and press *Enter* 3 times. It will *separate* the bullet-ed list from the numbered list. But yeah.. you can always \"*fix*\" this by *removing* the extra line so no biggie.. But then you *select* the \"*b. Configuration*\" numbered list and *BOOM!!* the extra line is there *again*?\n## *By now* you are a bit giddy about the whole thing, but at the same time a bit angry/sad. You think: *Maybe just forget* the whole making the how-to documentation then you *remember* that you where a \"*wiki-markup guru*\" and make the list by /+insert -> *wiki-markup*.\n{code}\n# Browse here and do that\n## This Section: Does many things and they are opened more below\n*** This button, will make world a happy place\n*** This button, will blow up the moon\n*** This button, will make you rich\n## Configuration\n*** Here is the default values\n{code} \n## *Boom!* *Voila*, you jump in *happiness* that you just created *good looking* list by *remembering wiki-markup*!\n# And now you *happily* move on to the *Second breaking point*\n## You start by creating a table \"*Table*\" -> You *select 2x4 table*, *WOOSH!* That was quick.. oh wait what's that bullet in front of the table? I'll just remove it so it looks more professional. Oh there is an extra line also let's delete that as well. Now let's punch up the numbers.. *done!* .. good everything *seems* ok.. now let's *continue* the numbered list so the next should bee... \"*c.*\" alright.. *Press enter* after the table, hmm.. ok? it brought you an *empty line*. Let's just try to *out-dent* the line. \\*Click\\* AARHG it out-dented the *bullet* that was *above* the table and it converted it to *numbered list*!?\n## And you *spend hours*(which you could have used to make the page complete)of *fixing* a *single* document when you *finally* realize that you could just do it with *wiki markup*.\n\nh2. Solution suggestion\nI really don't \"know\" the *solution* but when *using lists* in *rich-text* it really raises *few gray hairs*. *AND* if you didn't *use* pre *Confluence 4.0* or didn't know wiki-markup.. You just *couldn't* do decent looking lists.",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFSERVER-26575].\n  {panel}\n\nOne of the most powerful aspects of Confluence is its email notification of new and changed content. This topic has been discussed in Confluence forums since at least 2006, but no significant action has been taken by Atlassian except for renaming the \"Minor change\" box to \"Notify watchers.\" I still haven't seen any posting that summarizes the issues as my wiki users and I see them. This is an update to http://forums.atlassian.com/thread.jspa?messageID=257301891.\n\nThe problem is that users receive too many email notifications that most people consider unhelpful at best and very annoying at worst. The control mechanisms currently available in Confluence are inadequate to control sending email notifications, and \"watch\" options available to users can not make up for this deficiency.\n\nWe can divide actions and content into new, edited and removed pages, comments, news, and attachments as summarized below:\n\nContent Type\tNew\tEdited\tRemoved\nPage\t-\tX\t-\nComment\t-\t-\t-\nNews/blog\t-\t-\t-\nAttachment\t-\t-\t-\n\n\nThe X shows the only option, as far as I can tell, for preventing sending email notifications.\n\nPer this chart, email notifications are automatically sent out for ALL combinations EXCEPT for edited pages based on whether users check the \"Notify watchers\" option box. This same box could easily be made available for editing comments and blog entries and adding or removing attachments. (Searching Confluence forums for \"minor change\" provides several conversations on this matter back at least to 2006.) \n\nWe find particularly annoying email notifications resulting from removing or moving content. As administrator, I have removed pages, comments, and attachments as inappropriate or obsolete and have almost certainly not wanted to bring attention to that removed content. I also move pages, frequently to archival folders, and the only way to prevent email alerting messages from blasting users is to turn off the email function as an administrator. Using WebDAV to move or remove entries generates email blizzards.\n\nWe also believe email notifications about attachments (added, moved, or removed) to be of very low value. Attachments are almost always supporting or described by the page content itself which will be the subject of its own email notification.\n\nMy users and I believe it is past time for Atlassian to provide users and administrators better control in Confluence over sending these email notifications. This includes, but is not limited to, improving the \"Notify watchers\" option with clear option buttons or similar mechanisms as discussed in other forum entries.\n\nI look forward to elaboration of this issue by other users and action by Atlassian on this matter.",
