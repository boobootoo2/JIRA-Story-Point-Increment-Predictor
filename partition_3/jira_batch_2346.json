Problem:\r\nAs a user, when I change the 'url' field in my repositories .gitmodules file to be relative, rather than absolute, the link to the associated submodule within the Bitbucket source view page is no longer active and is replaced by a text representation. Attached screenshots, and here is a diff as an example of the .gitmodules change to stimulate the issue:\r\n\r\n [submodule \"communis\"]\r\n \tpath = communis\r\n-\turl = git@bitbucket.org:kanetoadstudios/communis.git\r\n+\turl = ../communis.git\r\n\r\nh1. Suggested solution:\r\nWhatever parses the .gitmodules file, for the purposes of presenting the user with a link to the associated submodule, should be modified to understand relative paths and behave in the same way as it would if the 'url' field was absolute.\r\n\r\nNOTE: If there is a problem resolving the relative link, the current operation is acceptable, but I don't believe there is a problem in the case I'm reporting as git performs a recursive clone quite happily with the relative url I supplied.

      "description": "h3. Summary\r\n\r\nUnder some rare conditions (for example, unusual activity on the {{/plugins/servlet/oauth/request-token}} endpoint), threads may become deadlocked in database queries involving the {{plugin_setting}} table.  This deadlock ties up connections to the database and increases the likelihood that further threads will also become deadlocked.  In extreme cases, threads may no longer be able to obtain connections from the DB connection pool, and the instance may require restarting. \r\n\r\nh3. Symptoms\r\n\r\nIf affected, the number of open connections to the database does not return to 0 even when idle, but increases monotonically.  It is possible to monitor the number of open database connections in Stash or Bitbucket Server directly using the following JMX beans:\r\n\r\n * Stash 3.8 to 3.11, {{com.jolbox.bonecp.BoneCP.TotalLeased}} as described in https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/STASH0311/Enabling+JMX+counters+for+performance+monitoring\r\n * Bitbucket Server 4.0 or higher, {{com.zaxxer.hikari.Pool (bitbucket).ActiveConnections}} as described in https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/enabling-jmx-counters-for-performance-monitoring-776640189.html\r\n\r\nIf affected, a Stash instance may remain up for a while (days or longer) with no adverse effects except for a mildly elevated number of open database connections.  But once deadlocked, the risk of further threads becoming deadlocked on the same resource increases.  If very many threads become deadlocked, the DB connection pool (with 80 connections by default) may run out and the instance will require restarting.\r\n\r\nAn analysis of the open transactions on the database (for example, with {{select \\* from pg_stat_activity order by xact_start;}} in PostgreSQL) while Stash is affected by this issue will show a number of (possibly very old) connections stuck in queries on the {{plugin_setting}} table, for example:\r\n\r\n{noformat}\r\ndelete from plugin_setting where id=$1\r\nupdate plugin_setting set key_name=$1, namespace=$2, key_value=$3 where id=$4\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nThread dumps of Stash taken while affected by this issue may also contain many threads blocked with {{com.atlassian.stash.internal.plugin.CachingPluginSettings}} classes mentioned in the stack traces.\r\n\r\nh3. Workarounds\r\n\r\n1. Avoid integrations which make frequent requests on the {{/plugins/servlet/oauth/request-token}} endpoint.  Atlassian products generally only make requests to this endpoint once every few hours, but third party integrations may make such requests more frequently.  You can check your {{atlassian-stash-access-\\*.log}} or {{atlassian-bitbucket-access-\\*.log}} files to find such activity. \r\n2. Avoid plugins that perform {{PluginSettings}} API calls in large transactions.  Note that the bundled Atlassian OAuth Plugin can perform very many {{PluginSettings}} API calls under some conditions, see the related issue https://ecosystem.atlassian.net/browse/OAUTH-321.\r\n3. Stash 3.11.6 contains a mitigation that makes this deadlock exceedingly unlikely to occur. (See BSERV-8522)\r\n4. If affected, forcibly terminating very old transactions stuck on queries on the {{plugin_setting}} table at the database level may clear the deadlock without requiring Stash or Bitbucket Server to be restarted. \r\n\r\nh3. Solution\r\n\r\nBitbucket Server 4.1.0 contains a solution that prevents the deadlock from occurring. \r\n",

I will add comments. The author will then reply to the comments make changes and push them up to BitBucket. Then I'll review and make more comments. Rinse/repeat. Each time I re-review, I have to go through all the changes I've already seen in the off-chance that I've missed something.\r\n\r\nProposal: I would love to mark individual changes and/or entire files as having been approved/read. If further updates to the pull request don't affect those changes/files, then rather than seeing the red/green difference, perhaps they show up as some other color (grey?). This would allow me to easily focus on the new changes to the pull request since I last viewed it.\r\n\r\nI posted this wish to my team HipChat and it was met with a resounding yes!

Summary\r\nThe REST resource:\r\n{noformat}\r\n/REST/API/1.0/PROJECTS/{PROJECTKEY}/PERMISSIONS/{PERMISSION}/ALL\r\n{noformat}\r\ndescribed at https://developer.atlassian.com/static/rest/bitbucket-server/4.4.1/bitbucket-rest.html#idp3014512 returns an empty response in case it succeeds.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\nCall the REST resource with the following command:\r\n{noformat}\r\ncurl -u username:password -H \"Content-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8\" -X POST  http://hostname:7990/rest/api/1.0/projects/PROJECTKEY/permissions/PROJECT_WRITE/all?allow=true\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nAs stated in documentation, in case of code {{204}} the resource should return the following json response:\r\n{noformat}\r\n{\r\n    \"permitted\": true\r\n}\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\nNothing is returned.\r\n\r\nh3.Workaround\r\n*Interactive Shell*\r\nIn case the REST resource is called in an interactive shell it is possible to enable verbose output using options {{-v}} or to show the response HTTP header by using option {{-i}} in this way the request will show, among the other info, the HTTP response code to understand if the call was successful.\r\n\r\nExample output with {{-v}}:\r\n{noformat}\r\n* Hostname was NOT found in DNS cache\r\n*   Trying 127.0.0.1...\r\n* Connected to localhost (127.0.0.1) port 7990 (#0)\r\n* Server auth using Basic with user 'daniele'\r\n> POST /rest/api/1.0/projects/PROA/permissions/PROJECT_WRITE/all?allow=true HTTP/1.1\r\n> Authorization: Basic ZGFuaWVsZTpkYW5pZWxl\r\n> User-Agent: curl/7.35.0\r\n> Host: localhost:7990\r\n> Accept: application/json\r\n> Content-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8\r\n> \r\n< HTTP/1.1 204 No Content\r\n* Server Apache-Coyote/1.1 is not blacklisted\r\n< Server: Apache-Coyote/1.1\r\n< X-AREQUESTID: @ZWY32Kx964x2352x0\r\n< X-ASEN: SEN-3426565\r\n< X-AUSERID: 1\r\n< X-AUSERNAME: daniele\r\n< Cache-Control: no-cache, no-transform\r\n< Vary: X-AUSERNAME\r\n< Vary: X-AUSERID\r\n< Vary: Cookie\r\n< X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff\r\n< Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8\r\n< Date: Mon, 07 Mar 2016 15:04:08 GMT\r\n< \r\n* Connection #0 to host localhost left intact\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nExample output with {{-i}}:\r\n{noformat}\r\nHTTP/1.1 204 No Content\r\nServer: Apache-Coyote/1.1\r\nX-AREQUESTID: @ZWY32Kx965x2353x0\r\nX-ASEN: SEN-3426565\r\nX-AUSERID: 1\r\nX-AUSERNAME: daniele\r\nCache-Control: no-cache, no-transform\r\nVary: X-AUSERNAME\r\nVary: X-AUSERID\r\nVary: Cookie\r\nX-Content-Type-Options: nosniff\r\nContent-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8\r\nDate: Mon, 07 Mar 2016 15:05:17 GMT\r\n{noformat}\r\n \r\n*Shell Scripts*\r\nIn case the command is called via script and the only interesting output is the HTTP response code is possible to filter the output using the following command:\r\n{noformat}\r\ncurl -s -o /dev/null -I -w \"%{http_code}\\n\" -u username:password -H \"Content-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8\" -X POST  http://hostname:7990/rest/api/1.0/projects/PROJECTKEY/permissions/PROJECT_WRITE/all?allow=true\r\n{noformat}\r\nThat will show as output only {{204}} (in case of successful request)",

      "description": "Hi,\r\nAlways when I try to embed images into Markdown (.md) files in Bitbucket Server, the resulting layout in the generated HTML page differs quite a lot from most other Markdown presentations. The biggest issue is that Bitbucket Server adds padding, margin and border CSS styles to the images, which is not done in most other Markdown renderers (e.g. MarkdownPad2 or GitHub).\r\nI attached a screenshot with the Bitbucket Server generated HTML and the HTML generated by the MarkdownPad 2 editor that I use to create the files, side by side.\r\nLeft is the Bitbucket Server version of the generated HTML/CSS. Right is the MarkdownPad exported HTML/CSS.\r\nOn the left side (Bitbucket Server) all the images are offset and use a border because of the CSS properties that are applied. This disrupts the expected layout of the images in the markdown a lot, you can see the expected layout quite nicely on the right side.\r\nFor a fix I used the chrome dev tools to set padding, margin and border = 0 in the Bitbucket HTML and it fixed the layout of the image that I tried it on (see example in the screenshot),\r\nCan you please fix the styling of the HTML that is generated by Markdown in Bitbucket Server ... also some other styles look a lot different from e.g. GitHub Markdown in comparison. For example the headings (h1-h6) in GitHub Markdown seem to use a bold font style, where the Bitbucket style does not ... so more consistency with the common Markdown look across all Markdown elements in Bitbucket Server would be nice and improve the reading experience imo.\r\n\r\nThanks",

In stress tests we are finding that 10 GBytes is very easy to fill up with logs and SCM cache files, leading to a poor initial experience. \r\n\r\nWe should increase the root volume size from 10 GBytes to something a bit more realistic, like 50 GBytes.

However, this setting will apply universally to all operations, regardless of their resource usage and run time.\r\n\r\nh4. Proposed solution\r\nThere are multiple ways to tackle this and also multiple aspects to consider. \r\n\r\nh5. Scale automatically\r\nIdeally Bitbucket could dynamically scale, say one could set the cap for CPU and memory utilization percentage and depending on the server load it would queue incoming requests instead of trying to serve them, once those pre-defined limits are reached - scaling down the concurrent operations on-the-fly.\r\n\r\nh5. Adjust concurrency per-operation-type\r\nThe current setting only allows tuning the concurrency for all operations, although there are less expensive operations that could be executed, without seriously impacting performance. The idea is to have a per-operation setting for concurrency and define number of concurrent clones, pushes, etc separately.\r\n\r\nh5. Make concurrency adjustable runtime\r\nNow you need to adjust such concurrency settings in {{bitbucket.properties}} then restart the instance for the setting to take effect. This is something that would be best to tune runtime through the administration UI.\r\n",
