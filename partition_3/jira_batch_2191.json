Now, you have the option to either publish the page directly as a blog or publish as a page now and then convert it to a blog later.

The most advanced features (\"orphans\", etc) are at the top, the rarely-used ones are in the middle, and the most practical ones (RSS, Watch, PDF export) are at the bottom, more or less. The main page real estate is used by the description.  Some functions like converting to personal space are only visible in edit mode (wtf!?), and you also only see the default page in edit mode (it should be displayed in view mode at least).  And it is UGLY.\n\nIt will be impossible to make it much worse, so let's try to make it nicer. For example by promoting the most important features. we could for example move the main actions to the right and give them larger buttons, and a brief textual description, so they are more obvious. We should probably rename the menu item from \"advanced\" to something like \"space actions\", and then have a little \"advanced\" tab inside the screen. I don't think that \"watching a space\" or getting a RSS feed should remain hidden away in an \"advanced\" tab these days anymore. We need to promote them!",

I guess it'd be much better to give distinct names for such operations (getPage and getPageById for example).\n\nFor testing please use SvcUtil.exe from .NET FW 3. not wsdl.exe from .NET 2.0 (which is almost depricated).\n\nFor the wsdl from above SvcUtil creates the following code (C#). Please notice two method getPage and getPage1. It's impossible to call a service via getPage1 method because server side doesn't know such method.\nSo in general the result client .net code is much more complex than it could be (notice wrappers and messagecontracts). I can understand that you guys from another world (Java), but it'd be nice to have good interoperability with Confluence on .NET platform, wouldn't it?\n\nThe result code (excepts):\n        //

So if a CAC page is renamed, and the relevant help-paths.properties file isn't updated, customers could click a 'Help' link and end up at a non-existent page (or receive a a suggestion for the renamed page, which is better, but still won't look very professional).\n\n(The tech writers do watch all the CAC documentation spaces, but this isn't completely failsafe as people can easily check the \"Minor Update\" box.)\n\nThis use-case may perhaps be too specific to be useful to most customers; but it would help the Atlassian tech writers sleep easier :)",

For example:\n{code:none}\n{flowchart}\nYksi -> Kaksi -> Kolme -> Yksi;\n{flowchart}\n{code}\n\nIs converted to this just by clicking Rich Text Editor tab:\n{code:none}\n{flowchart}\nYksi \\-> Kaksi \\-> Kolme \\-> Yksi;\n{flowchart}\n{code}\n\nwhich, of course, spoils the diagram and that, in turn, makes the Rich Text Editor next to unusable (in our case, anyway).\n\nFortunately, there is a simple solution to this. I suggest that you improve Rich Text Editor by adding some filtering capabilities there so that certain macros will be bypassed by Rich Text Editor. This filter could be a simple list where a Confluence admin can add all the macros to be bypassed. Or maybe the list should contain macros that can be handled by the Rich Text Editor. But to put it simply, there should be a way to manage what Rich Text Editor is allowed to \"edit\".",

Problem\n\nDiscovered during user sessions... \"The Add Table dialog is hard and slow for me to use.\"\n\n- When entering letters into the row and column fields and clicking \"OK\", blank space is inserted into the editor. An error message would be more useful.\n- Some users would find it faster and easier if they could select a number rather than type it in.\n- \"First Row is Heading\" label is grammatically incorrect and too long.\n\nh3. Solution\n\nUsing the new lightbox style (e.g. macro browser), implement something like this:\n\n!insert_table.png|thumbnail!\n\nThis will align the dialog with the current direction and make it less confusing for the confused users.\n\nIf someone wants to do something _FANTASTIC_ for _FUN_, Microsoft Word 2004 has a pretty good implementation for inserting dialogs. But it's probably a time consuming implementation and one not worth the time (which is why I haven't proposed it as the primary solution).",

I suspect this is not an uncommon activity.\n\nIt was actually a bit tricky, because I couldn't just search and replace, because the terms I wanted to change are used in different ways, only some of which I wanted to change.\n\nFor example, sometimes Confluence is used to mean \"this website\", and sometimes it is used to mean \"the software\".\n\nWhere it was used to mean the website, I've tried to change it.  Where it is used to mean the software, I've tried not to change it.\n\n\"Page\" also has multiple meanings.  Sometimes it means any confluence page, including blogposts.  Sometimes it means a confluence page, excluding blogposts.  Sometimes it means any web page, confluence or not.\n\nAnd of course, I had to be careful only to change to the right of each \"=\" sign.\n\nIt would have been much easier to make the changes I wanted if, at the top of ConfluenceActionSupport.properties, there had been a block that said \n\nconfluence_software=Confluence\nconfluence_site=Confluence\nconfluence_space=space\nconfluence_regular_page=page\nconfluence_any_page=page\nconfluence_blogpost=blogpost\nconfluence_dashboard=...\n\nAnd them, if references to page were qualified as ${confluence_regular_page}, or some such.\n\nIt would mean that I would only have to make the changes I want in a few places, and better still, it would mean that I wouldn't have to work out which ones to change and which ones to leave.",

In this case we will probably get reuse from this code in production, but other test JS methods should _not_ go in the production scripts.\n\nWe need a way to make helper methods available to our Selenium tests, this would best be achieved with a Confluence plugin. \n",

When I add the movie to the page as an attachment, the player controls are not shown, so the movie just loops and loops, and cannot be paused or replayed as the user needs.  The only way it works is to link to the content on our Adobe Connect site, but that opens in a new window, so it's not as elegant as I would like for our users.

This raises the problem that the bundled macro notation help will be less polished or even inaccurate.\n\nThis issue includes the use of aliases in the Macro Browser, where a macro opened with one name (e.g. 'nl') will be saved as another ('nolink'), or where an old \"uber\" macro name like 'viewfile' is directed to a more specific macro like 'viewdoc'.\n\nAs the Macro Browser links directly to the CAC docs it makes sense for CAC to be the \"source of truth\" and for the notation guide to follow. We need to find a way to do this without merely replicating the CAC text (and its i18ns).\n\nIn the short term, we could simply point users to the Macro Browser or CAC for problem notation guide entries.

They now get this text in the UI when moving a page:\n\n{quote}You can not move this page to another space because you do not have permission to remove pages from this space.\nYou can move the highlighted page by dragging it to a new position in the tree.\n{quote}\n\nThis first line is unhelpful and confusing. It should only show the second line, as before.\n\nStephen agrees with this. The fact that they do not have permission is implied by the fact that the UI does not give them the option to choose a space. This is analogous to a user who does not have edit permission on a page - they simply do not see the 'Edit' button - there is no text to explain why they cannot see it.\n\n",

This is because the view attachments page renders a list of all attachments on a page as well as all its versions (its versions are just added a class hidden and the arrow to display them just toggles this class).\n\nWe should either load the previous version only when the user clicks on the arrow by an AJAX call, or even provide a paginated view of such a large number of versions. \n\nIf if the attachment does not have version in the tens of thousands, but does have a significant amount, it will cause the attachments page rendering time to degrade badly. \n\nThus this solution should not only consider prevent the OOME but also keeping the page load time scalable.
