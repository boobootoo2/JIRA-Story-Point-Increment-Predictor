Please help. This is important to us.\n\n\n*Original Question:*\n\nWe are using Atlassian Confluence 5.8.8.\nI have been using the Include Page Macro a lot and it's essential to our documentation model.\nNow we have started using multiple spaces and it is not working for me.\nI created a New Space and created several documents within that space. On my master document page, I tried to use include page macro and it only finds pages from our original space, not New Space.\nIt does not see any pages from the New Space. \nOther macros I've tried to use seem to work. Just not that one. I created another space and the same thing happens there.\nWhat I've tried:\n\u2022\tI have played around with titles of the pages, permissions, different pages, etc.  \n\u2022\tI've tried using the space key/space/colon for the New Space. That didn't work.\n\u2022\tI tried a work-around I read about to insert a page I could access and edit it. That didn't work.\nThank you for any suggestions to solve this problem. It's huge for us.\n________________________________________\n*Nic's  answer:*\n\nTo use pages from other spaces, you have to specify the target page's space key.\nE.g. for a page called \"Stuff to include\" in a space keyed with NIC, you need to tell the macro NIC:Stuff to Include\nNote that the space key is case sensitive.\nIf that is not working, then can you describe what happens when you save a macro with such a macro embedded in it?\n\n________________________________________\n*The response I want to give him:*\n\nI am trying to use the macro include a page that is in the same space as the master document (New Space) and it's only finding pages in another space (Original Space).  \nSo one of the troubleshooting things I tried in desperation was treating the current space (New Space) like it was another space. It was just a shot it the dark.  \n\nEverything works great in the Original Space. We create original documents and include pages in them all they time. The content appears in the master document seamlessly. We love the way it works. I just need it to also work within New Space.\n\nThank you for any help you can give me.\n",

However, the page is always opened at the top, independently from the part of the page you were viewing before (in viewing mode). For large pages this is very cumbersome, since you have to scroll all the way down in the editing view when you were viewing the end of the page before. Moreover, if there are a lot of macros on the page, the similarity between edit mode and viewing mode is often quite low, which only makes the searching to the right spot in the editing view even more time consuming.\n\nI suggest following improvement:\n* When pressing 'e': in the editing mode jump directly to the text line which was displayed at the top of the browser screen in the viewing mode.\n* If the \"double-click to edit\" functionality is provided: jump to the line where the double-click occured.\n\n",

Additionally, if the WebDAV Launcher add-on is not installed, you are not prompted to install it.\n\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\n# Open a vanilla Firefox\n# Go to a Confluence page with an Office Document\n# Click Edit in Office (or go to Tools - Attachments and try to edit in office from there)\n#- You *should* be prompted to install the WebDAV connector at this point, according to [this document|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Installing+the+Firefox+Add-On+for+the+Office+Connector], but you are not.\n# Install the add-on manually\n# Try to edit the document again\n#- Still, nothing happens, as thought the button or link has no action attached.\n\nh3. Workaround\nThis behaviour occurs because the WebDAV Launcher has not been configured. You will need to install the connector manually, then configure it following [this document|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Installing+the+Firefox+Add-On+for+the+Office+Connector]. You will then be able to Edit in Office through Firefox.\n\nh3. Hopes and Dreams\nThe behaviour of the WebDAV connector could be improved, to show an error or warning if the add on has not been configured. Our documentation indicates that the user will be taken to the download location if the add-on is not installed, so this should also occur.",

Thus, one of the best collaboration features of Confluence can't be used. \nRegarding ROI of fixing this for the growing Apple/OSX/Mac user base...  I don't know if you've scoped the effort level to resolve this? On the plus side, some customer's may be will to pay for a 'feature' to resolve it.

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFSERVER-39187].\n  {panel}\n\nHello,\n\nI'v noticed that when importing word documents, the table that office connector imports to a Confluence page uses <td> and \"class=highlight\" E.g\n{code:HTML}<td class=\"highlight\">{code} \n\nIs it possible to get doc import to use the correct method of tagging header cells? \n\nHeader cells on the first column E.g\n{code:HTML}\n<tr>\n\t<th>Header cell</th>\n\t<td>Normal cell</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n\t<th>Header cell</th>\n\t<td>Normal cell</td>\n</tr>\n{code}\n\nHeader on the first row E.G\n{code:HTML}\n<tr>\n\t<th>Header cell</th>\n\t<th>Header cell</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n\t<td>Normal cell</td>\n\t<td>Normal cell</td>\n</tr>\n{code}\n\nThis would be great improvement because Scroll Office Word export uses <th> as header row when exporting documents. And when creating a new table within Confluence the format in the first row and the first column is <th> if they are highlighted.\n\nBut when importing a word the format is <td> with \"class=highlight\". Clearing all formatting and applying the header row or the header column doesn't change the HTML tags.\n\nBest regards\nPatrick\n",

As we often have really big manuals this makes totally sense. After importing some test manuals we noticed that unfortunately the order of the subtopics created out of the headings in word is just alphabetical! There is no way to get the old structure back. For example you have a document with three headings.\n\nDocumentname = My Thesis\nTOC\n1. Introduction\n2. Main Part\n3. End\n\nFrom this results in Confluence:\nA page \"My thesis\" with the TOC shown above\nand the three children introduction, main part and end. In the side bar and the child macro those topics get shown in an alphabetical order. That means I get as list\n\n* End\n* Introduction\n* Main Part\n\nThat makes navigating with the sidebar basically useless. Therefore I ideally would suggest two options:\n1. Allow importing the number of the numbered heading from word to the title of the page so sorting works out automatically\n\n2. Allow chronological sorting as kind of work around to show at least the correct order of pages",

Summary\nWhen using the office connector and editing/updating a document, the page 'modified date' does not update after the change.  This is a request to update the 'modified date' of the Confluence Page when an office document is edited.\n\nh2. Steps to Reproduce\n* Log into Confluence with Firefox or Internet Explorer\n* Create a new page and 'edit' it.\n* Create a test Office (excel was what I used) document with test data and copy the document to the new page while in 'edit' mode.\n* Save the page\n* (You will need to wait a few minutes so the 'last modified date' is a few minutes previous)\n* Click 'Edit Document'\n* Make a change to the test office document\n* Save the document\n\nh2. Expected Result\nThe page 'date modified' will be updated when the office document is saved\n\nh2. Actual Result\nThe page 'date modified' is unchanged after saving the office document.\n\nh2. Environment\nWindows 7\nFirefox and Internet Explorer\nConfluence 5.4.2 (I believe this is all versions)\n\nh2. Other Notes\nWe are aware that the 'date modified' on the attachments page does get updated when a change is made.  This request is to update the Confluence page 'date modified' to reflect this information as well.",
