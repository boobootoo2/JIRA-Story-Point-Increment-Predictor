As expected, the {{Merge}} button is disabled while the approval requirement has not been met; however, when a developer hovers over the disabled button the tooltip says:\r\n\r\nbq. This pull request can't be merged automatically.\r\n\r\nThis leads some of our users to believe that the state of the source branch is not compatible with the target branch and that they need to take some action like rebasing or committing their own merge to the PR branch.  It is not necessarily obvious that the reason has nothing to do with the code or the state of the repository; this confusion may be greater in users coming from a different tool (i.e. GitHub) that does not offer approval requirements.  Even if they understand that there is such a requirement, the phrasing of the tooltip makes them think that _even if_ the pull request were approved that it still would not be in a state that allowed an automatic merge.\r\n\r\nThe caution icon to the left of the button correctly explains exactly which requirements are unmet, but it is not immediately obvious to some users that they can hover over (or click!) that icon.  Please change the tooltip on the {{Merge}} button to be more specific based on the actual conditions _or_ have it instruct the user to click the caution triangle icon for details.",

Today, Jira has the concept of version, but the version capability in Jira cannot be associated with Stash (git). I want the Jira issues in the release to be reflected in Jira in a release field which comes from Stash/git.

      "description": "I'm writing an internal plugin to enforce that all tags are annotated (among other things).\r\n\r\nTo do this, I need to call 'git cat-file -t HASH' and look at the result - 'tag' means its an annotated tag and 'commit' means that its an unannotated tag, pointing to a real commit.\r\n\r\nGitCommandFactory.type() looks like it would do what I want, however it doesn't work for this case:\r\n\r\ntype() takes a TypeCommandParamenters object. TypeCommandParameters' path attribute is @Nullable, so its optional, but the actual implementation of the two-arg form of object in DefaultCatFileBuilder treats a null path as an empty string, so the code calls 'git cat-file -t HASH:', which (with the colon) is interpreted by git as looking for the type of the root of the repo, which is always going to be 'directory'.\r\n\r\nTrying to use GitCommandBuilderFactory directly (with the one-arg version of 'object') also doesn't work - TypeCatFileOutputHandler uses GitObjectType.fromObjectType to map from the cat-file string return (eg 'commit') to the ContentTreeNode.Type enum. However, while GitObjectType knows about the 'tag' type, the enum only defines the 'tag' key, without a value, so TypeCatFileOutputHander ends up returning null for a tag (and ContentTreeNode.Type.SUBMODULE for a lightweight tag....)\r\n\r\nThe workaround is to replace calling:\r\n\r\n{code}\r\ngitCommandFactory.type(repository, TypeCommandParameters.Builder().changesetId(refChange.getToHash()).build()\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n{code}\r\ngitCommandBuilderFactory.builder(repository).catFile().type().object(refChange.getToHash()).build(new TypeCatFileOutputHandler()).call()\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nwith\r\n\r\n{code}\r\ngitCommandBuilderFactory.builder(repository).catFile().type().object(refChange.getToHash()).build(new CommandOutputHandler<String>() {\r\n    private final StringOutputHandler outputHandler = new StringOutputHandler();\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    public void complete() throws ProcessException {\r\n        outputHandler.complete();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    public String getOutput() {\r\n        String objectType = StringUtils.chomp(outputHandler.getOutput());\r\n\r\n        return objectType;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    public void process(InputStream output) throws ProcessException {\r\n        outputHandler.process(output);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    public void setWatchdog(Watchdog watchdog) {\r\n        outputHandler.setWatchdog(watchdog);\r\n    }\r\n                    }).call();\r\n{code}\r\n\r\n(replacing the String with a proper Enum)\r\n\r\nTo reproduce, set up a post-receive hook that calls the above and prints out the results, and compare:\r\n\r\n{{git tag unannotated; git push --tags}}\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n{{git tag -a -m 'annotated tag' annotated; git push --tags}}\r\n\r\n(The comments in GitObjectType are also wrong - 'tag' can only be an annotated, possibly signed, tag, not a lightweight tag, and 'commit' just points to a commit object, which may not be a submodule)",

As the issue hasn't collect votes, watchers, comments, or support cases from many customers during its lifetime, it's very low on our priority list, and will not be fixed in the foreseeable future. That's why we've decided to resolve it as *Timed Out*.\r\n\r\nAlthough we're aware the issue is still important to those of you who were involved in the conversations around it, we want to be clear in managing your expectations. The Bitbucket Server team is focusing on issues that have broad impact and high value, reflected by the number of comments, votes, support cases, and customers interested. Please consult the [Atlassian Bugfix Policy|https://confluence.atlassian.com/support/atlassian-bug-fixing-policy-201294573.html] for more details.\r\n\r\nWe understand how disappointing this decision may be, but we hope you'll appreciate our transparent approach and communication. If you're really passionate about this suggestion, please comment with your case in detail and we'll reconsider. Atlassian will continue to watch this issue for further updates, so please feel free to share your thoughts in the comments.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nImran Khan\r\nProduct Manager - Bitbucket Server and Data Center\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\nWhen you create an empty repository, Stash displays a helpful page with instructions on how to use git to get started.  Our developers have asked for the ability to see this page even when they do not have an empty repository for reference purposes.

See the attached screenshot.  The file is listed correctly in the 'Changed files' list but the Diff pane shows the icon with 'The contents for this file have not changed'.  If you go to a source view of the file directly from its branch and and use the 'Diff to previous' button with the history that works fine ... so the changes expected are definitely in the repository.\r\n\r\nThe root of the problem seems to be, and this can be seen from the screenshot, is that although in the 'Changed files' list the filename is correct, in the header bar for the 'Diff' pane its extension has gone missing!  If you click on the 'raw file' icon this confirms that it is trying to look for the file minus its extension.  This only seems to affect .F90 files and not .f90 ... so the capital F seems to be important but can't think why. This makes reviewing changes to .F90 files very tricky.\r\n\r\nThis wasn't an issue in 2.12.0 the last version we had before upgrading to 3.1.0.

And still I have no easy way to navigate to this repository. I have to come back to the repository, go to my profile, than find the repository based on the name. This is not straightforward.\r\n\r\nI would like the fork button to be smarter, and offer me to browse my existing fork if I have one in my personal project. I like the way github does it : it displays the list of organizations (i.e. projects) where I can create repositories, and if the corresponding org. already contains a fork of the repository, then it offers to browse it instead of creating a new one.\r\n\r\nIt would be great if it could be implemented that way in Stash.",

As the issue hasn't collect votes, watchers, comments, or support cases from many customers during its lifetime, it's very low on our priority list, and will not be fixed in the foreseeable future. That's why we've decided to resolve it as *Timed Out*.\r\n\r\nAlthough we're aware the issue is still important to those of you who were involved in the conversations around it, we want to be clear in managing your expectations. The Bitbucket Server team is focusing on issues that have broad impact and high value, reflected by the number of comments, votes, support cases, and customers interested. Please consult the [Atlassian Bugfix Policy|https://confluence.atlassian.com/support/atlassian-bug-fixing-policy-201294573.html] for more details.\r\n\r\nWe understand how disappointing this decision may be, but we hope you'll appreciate our transparent approach and communication. If you're really passionate about this suggestion, please comment with your case in detail and we'll reconsider. Atlassian will continue to watch this issue for further updates, so please feel free to share your thoughts in the comments.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nImran Khan\r\nProduct Manager - Bitbucket Server and Data Center\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\nDear Stash support team,\r\n\r\nwe have a request from our users to provide sharing buttons like in Confluence for Stash. They want to share repositories, code snippets and pull requests with their colleagues. Is there a possibility to do this? If not, could you please create an internal wish list entry from this?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nJ\u00fcrgen\r\n",

The page will not hijack browser search dialog anymore, which will add comfort to your code review experience. \r\n\r\nYou can find more information in the Bitbucket Server 7.0\u00a0[release notes|https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/bitbucket-server-7-0-release-notes-990546638.html] and Pull Requests [documentation|https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/review-and-discuss-a-pull-request-808488540.html].\r\n\r\nPlease, don't hesitate to leave feedback on the feature in the comments. This will help us to priorities further development.\r\n\r\nAnton Genkin\r\n Product Manager Bitbucket Server\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\n*Original message*\r\n\r\nIt wouldn't be horrible except that in my browser, ctrl+f allows me to press enter to cycle between the N matches that are on the page. Pressing enter in stash's ctrl+f closes the find window and doesn't scroll to the next match.\r\n\r\nIs outputting the full file at a given commit hash then overlaying the diff a significant performance issue? Can we make it work for files up to a certain reasonable size, and only incur the poor UX if your file is over a certain length?",
