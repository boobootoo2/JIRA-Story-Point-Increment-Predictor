Modules are built in parallel, while files in a single module are compiled sequentially. \r\n\r\nClover expects that at least a single file is instrumented sequentially (the FileInto getCoverageMask which returns bitmask based on index range), so that the clover database contains continuous range of indexes for code elements from a single file. It means that we need to synchronize per file. It should not be a problem that subsequent files in database are from different modules. \r\n\r\npossible solutions:\r\n\r\n1) simple lock per whole file in some synchronized block; drawback: turns parallel build into single-threaded one.\r\n\r\n2) batch operations, like first instrument whole file using relative indexes, next lock database and store information about whole file, database would return base offset value; still in sychronized block but locked for shorter amount of time;\r\n\r\n3) change clover.db structure so that elements could be registered in any order; change FileInfo getCoverageMask function (and related); check for any data structures which needs to be made thread-safe;\r\n",

Otherwise it gets \"ClassNotFoundException com_cenqua_clover/CoverageRecorder\" error. There are over 6'000 views on answers.atlassian.com about this problem (it's #1 on the list)\r\n\r\n*Solution:*\r\n\r\nCreate a possiblity to automatically or manually embed clover-runtime.jar into produced JAR/WAR/EAR artifacts. \r\n\r\n*Tasks:*\r\n\r\n1) (/) Restructure Clover modules and find exact set of runtime classes, create clover-runtime.jar artifact out of it (will be published on Maven Central). Such subset was already found for Clover-for-Android, but it does not have classes for Distributed Coverage feature. See linked issue. \r\n\r\n2) Create Ant task like <clover-embed-runtime-jar targetJar=\"my.jar\"/> which will allow to manually put runtime classes into it.\r\n\r\n3) Check if it would be possible to intercept all <jar/> calls as well and do it automatically. Add option to disable this automatic integration and/or to specify regular expression pattern which jars shall be enhanced.\r\n\r\n4) Create Maven goal like clover2:embed-runtime-jar with <targetJar> property.\r\n\r\n5) Check how to automatically embed Clover runtime classes. Possibilities:\r\n * extract clover-runtime.jar into target/classes or target/classes-clover\r\n * scan build reactor, intercept packaging tasks like maven-ear-plugin, maven-jar-plugin, maven-rar-plugin, maven-war-plugin, maven-assembly-plugin\r\n * modify maven project at runtime and add clover:clover-runtime dependency\r\n\r\n6) Eclipse integration - we already have -Xbootclasspath for \"Run with Clover as...\" but it's not enough if user has web application for example. Extract clover-runtime.jar into project's build folder so that other packaging tools could automatically pick these classes. Add pre-build or post-clean event handler to make sure that these classes will be still present after rebuild. Add some option in Window > Preferences or Project > Properties for this.\r\n\r\n7) IDEA integration - put these classes into out/production and out/test. Add option in File > Settings > Project Settings or File > Settings > IDE Settings for this.\r\n\r\n8) Grails integration - t.b.d.",

      "description": "Moved from: https://studio.plugins.atlassian.com/browse/CLMVN-147\r\n=====================================\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to the Clover Maven plugin architecture, the custom maven lifecycle initiated by the clover plugin at instrumentation goal ends with the install goal.\r\n\r\nI believe this is incorrect as the install goal will publish into the local maven repository the artifact built in that custom lifecycle. The artifact - <project_name>-<version>-clover.jar - is built from the instrumented code, something we really don't want installed into our local repositories. And especially we don't want this artifact to be resolved as a dependency to any project.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, this causes problems in classpath resource scanning when using multimodule projects. Let's consider three projects with the following dependency structure:\r\n\r\n  *  Project C\r\n  **      Project B\r\n  ***          Project A\r\n  **      Project A\r\n\r\nProject C has two dependencies, Project B and Project A. Project B has Project A as dependency - as a result, Project A is resolved as a transitive dependency to Project C.\r\nProject A dependency is listed explicitly as a dependency to Project C since - per best practices in expressing dependencies - Project C uses resources explicitly from Project A (and B both).\r\n\r\nWhen running clover2:instrument goal for Project C, the classpath seen during test has Project A artifacts twice:\r\n\r\n    Project_A-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT -clover.jar <- unexpected!\r\n    Project_A-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar\r\n    As a result, during execution of tests for Project C, scanning classpath renders duplicated resources - as indicates the failure of the WrapperTest.testResources test. This is a problem especially in environments where these resources are processed in a cumulative non-idempotent way - like JPA persistent contexts are.\r\n\r\nUnrelated to this problem, but I find odd - to say the least - that even though there are test failures, the clover2:instrument goal declares the build was successful (see the log attached).\r\n\r\nPlease find attached the tests to reproduce the problem - the three projects discussed above, along with the log file of executing the build with clover instrumentation.\r\n\r\n=========\r\n\r\n Petter M\u00e5hl\u00e9n added a comment - 22/Aug/12 4:22 AM\r\n\r\nTo add to this issue, we're having a problem where for some reason, compilation of the Clover-instrumented source fails when trying to build project C in the example above. This is intermittent or perhaps platform-dependent, and the error is that the compiler is unable to find a constructor that definitely exists in the uninstrumented code, and as far as I can tell in the instrumented code as well. Deleting the -clover.jar file from the local Maven repository means that compilation succeeds.\r\n",

The Log task includes the coverage of your test classes as well, whereas the Check task will not.\r\nYou can check this by excluding all your test classes from instrumentation.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nNick\r\n\r\n========= \r\n\r\nGr\u00e9gory Joseph added a comment - 10/Oct/11 2:29 AM\r\n\r\nHi Nick,\r\n\r\nThanks for the heads up. That also explains why the difference is bigger when we have more tests\r\n\r\nThis is perhaps not the best place for discussing this (let me know), but what are the use cases for instrumenting test classes ? When would I be interested - in checking how much my tests are covered... by other tests ? (I can see it would be useful when writing a test framework, but other than that ?)\r\n\r\n=========\r\n\r\n Gr\u00e9gory Joseph added a comment - 14/Oct/11 3:54 AM - edited\r\n\r\nNick,\r\n\r\n<includesTestSourceRoots>false</includesTestSourceRoots> seems to do the trick indeed, but as per the doc, it disables the reporting of per-test coverage.\r\n\r\nThe reason we're using the log goal in the first place, is because the check goal does not output the current coverage when it passes. It does output a few things, but then just mentions \"passed\" - while it does output the current coverage when it fails. As far as I'm concerned, if it would just output the current coverage, I'd just ditch the call to log. I'd suggest this:\r\n\r\nCurrent messages:\r\n\r\n    Coverage check PASSED\r\n    Total coverage of 34.3% did not meet target of 50%\r\n\r\nProposed messages:\r\n\r\n    Total coverage of 34.3% successfully met target of 50%\r\n    Total coverage of 34.3% did not meet target of 50%\r\n\r\n\r\n=========\r\n\r\n Gr\u00e9gory Joseph added a comment - 03/Nov/11 9:59 AM\r\n\r\nAnother discrepancy I've noticed, is that the :log goal doesn't use the contextFilter. That's also quite a burden, since we'd like our dev to look at the log, and raise the bar (i.e the targetThreshold) if they see the coverage has increased. WDYT ?\r\n\r\n=========\r\n\r\n Nick Pellow added a comment - 09/Nov/11 7:29 PM\r\n\r\nHi Gregory,\r\n\r\nI like your idea of improving the Clover logging in the Clover Check task.\r\nI have created https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CLOV-1036 for this, however can't give you an exact release date just yet.\r\nI could potentially get you a development build containing a fix for the improved logging in clover:check though. Let me know if you are interested.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nNick\r\n\r\n=========\r\n\r\n Gr\u00e9gory Joseph added a comment - 10/Nov/11 1:59 AM - edited\r\n\r\nThanks !\r\nI'll follow the issue, but a non-generally available build wouldn't really at this point, since I'm working on our build infrastructure for the whole team. Of course I'll be happy to give it a spin if you want me to check it'd work for us.\r\n\r\n=========\r\n\r\n Marek Parfianowicz added a comment - 23/Jan/13 12:11 AM\r\n\r\nI believe that it was solved in https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CLOV-1064 (3.1.6 release).\r\n\r\n",

When the ear tries to create the application.xml (as per the INFO - INFO ear:generate-application-xml above) the Modules are checked against the local repository and both the unclovered version and the clovered version are found and so the error is reported.\r\n\r\nThis can be fixed by specifying a classifier in the Modules section for the ear, but means that you must create two poms (or use complicated profiles), one with the classifier set to clover and one set to the empty string. This is a pain and hard to maintain.\r\n\r\nThe patch I have posted resolves this and along with MCLOVER-82 allows for the creation of a true cloverized ear, using cloverized jars.\"\r\n",

Cf http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/MCLOVER-70 and http://www.mail-archive.com/users@maven.apache.org/msg85358.html.\r\n\r\nBelow a copy of the message. I am not sure if the problem comes from clover or maven.\r\n\r\nclover:instrument forked lifecyle modified project artifacts list do not get propagated to the WAR/EAR mojos. Is this expected ?\r\n\r\nJerome Lacoste\r\nWed, 21 May 2008 11:10:25 -0700\r\n\r\nClovered EAR / WAR artifacts lacks clovered versions of transitive\r\ndependencies. Cf: http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/MCLOVER-70. This\r\nissue still exists in the maven clover plugin 3.7 from atlassian.\r\nWe've tested maven 2.0.6 and 2.0.9.\r\n\r\nThe issue is caused apparently as the clover plugins tries to modify\r\nthe project artifacts list in a forked lifecycle, but the change is\r\nnot propagated to the mojos executed later on. My understanding is\r\nthat the way clover tries to achieve this is not possible, as the\r\nforked lifecycle ends before the war/ear mojos are executed.\r\n\r\nCan someone confirm this reasoning, and maybe provide an alternative\r\nsolution to this problem ?\r\n\r\nDetails:\r\n*******\r\nThe clover instrument mojo forks its own lifecycle. This lifecyle then\r\ntriggers the clover instrumentInternal after the validate phase. In\r\nthis forked lifecycle, the instrumentInternal mojo is bound to the\r\ninstall phase.\r\n\r\nIn\r\nhttp://svn.atlassian.com/svn/public/contrib/clover/maven-clover-plugin/trunk/src/main/java/com/atlassian/maven/plugin/clover/CloverInstrumentMojo.java\r\n\r\n    @goal instrument\r\n    @execute phase=\"install\" lifecycle=\"clover\"\r\n\r\nThen\r\nhttp://svn.atlassian.com/svn/public/contrib/clover/maven-clover-plugin/trunk/src/main/resources/META-INF/maven/lifecycle.xml\r\n\r\n<lifecycle>\r\n<id>clover</id>\r\n<phases>\r\n<phase>\r\n<id>validate</id>\r\n\r\n<executions><execution><goals><goal>instrumentInternal</goal></goals></execution></executions>\r\n\r\nSo when we run clover:instrument as part of a WAR project we see the\r\nfollowing things happening.\r\n\r\nINFO clover:instrument\r\n...\r\nINFO clover:instrumentInternal\r\n...\r\nINFO resources:resources\r\n...\r\n....\r\nINFO war:war\r\n\r\nAs part of clover:instrumentInternal, clover tries to override the\r\nproject artifacts and dependency artifacts.\r\nThis is done here:\r\n\r\nhttp://svn.atlassian.com/svn/public/contrib/clover/maven-clover-plugin/trunk/src/main/java/com/atlassian/maven/plugin/clover/CloverInstrumentInternalMojo.java\r\n\r\n    @goal instrumentInternal\r\n    @phase validate\r\n    @requiresDependencyResolution test\r\n\r\nprivate void swizzleCloverDependencies()\r\n{ getProject().setDependencyArtifacts( swizzleCloverDependencies( getProject().getDependencyArtifacts() ) ); getProject().setArtifacts( swizzleCloverDependencies( getProject().getArtifacts() ) ); }\r\n\r\nAccording to the debug logs, the swizzleCloverDependencies does the\r\nthing properly:\r\n\r\nINFO clover:instrumentInternal\r\n...\r\nDEBUG] Clover source root\r\nC:\\b2bdev\\projects\\helloWorld\\webapp\\src\\test\\java\r\nDEBUG Clover List of dependency artifacts after changes:\r\nDEBUG Clover Artifact junit:junit:jar:3.8.1, scope = test\r\nDEBUG Clover Artifact com.cenqua.clover:clover:jar:2.1.0,\r\nscope = compile\r\nDEBUG Clover Artifact com.test.helloworld:app:jar:clover:1.0,\r\nscope = compile\r\nDEBUG Clover List of artifacts after changes:\r\nDEBUG Clover Artifact junit:junit:jar:3.8.1, scope = test\r\nDEBUG Clover Artifact com.test.helloworld:app1:jar:clover:1.0,\r\nscope = compile\r\nDEBUG Clover Artifact com.test.helloworld:app:jar:clover:1.0,\r\nscope = compile\r\nDEBUG Configuring mojo\r\n'org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-resources-plugin:2.2:resources' -->\r\n\r\nThe problem is when the war mojo is invoked later on, the list of\r\nartifacts is still the old one. I.e. we miss some clovered artifacts.\r\n\r\nDid the forked life cycle stop after the execution of the\r\ninstrumentInternal mojo and did the changes setArtifacts() get lost ?\r\n\r\nOr should I expect maven to appropriately pass the appropriate\r\nartifacts to the war mojo, as invoked as part of this special lifecyle\r\n?\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nJerome\r\n\r\n=====\r\n\r\n Jerome Lacoste added a comment - 22/May/08 10:19 PM\r\n\r\nCLMVN-25 and CLMVN-6 have the same root cause. CLMWN-25 seems to have some interesting findings.\r\n\r\nhttp://studio.plugins.atlassian.com/browse/CLMVN-25?focusedCommentId=16756#action_16756\r\n\r\n=====\r\n\r\n Jerome Lacoste added a comment - 25/May/08 2:58 PM\r\n\r\nI managed to hack maven to work, but this is in an unsupported way. It required to modify the project interface and inject code from clover plugin.\r\n\r\nSee http://www.mail-archive.com/dev@maven.apache.org/msg74636.html for details. I will see if I can get a proper solution in maven, but I doubt that this will be done in the 2.0.x timeframe.\r\n\r\n=======\r\n\r\n Jerome Lacoste added a comment - 25/May/08 11:57 PM\r\n\r\nHere's the issue I created for maven: http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/MNG-3595\r\n\r\nThis patch is definitively not going to be accepted as is. Not sure if this is going to get fixed in a 2.0.x time frame.\r\n\r\n=======\r\n\r\n Jerome Lacoste added a comment - 14/Nov/09 3:09 AM\r\n\r\nIt looks like I had forgotten to attach this. I haven't verified that this is the proper version of the patch but it should give you an idea of what to do it if doesn't work.\r\n\r\nThis was made on top of the 3.7 version of the maven-clover-plugin\r\n\r\nNot sure how relevant this is wrt maven-clover2-plugin.\r\n\r\n=======\r\n\r\n Nick Pellow added a comment - 15/Nov/09 5:01 PM\r\n\r\nThanks, Jerome.\r\nIt could also be worth pinging the maven development list about this. They could ensure your patch works for the upcoming maven 3.x stream of work?\r\n\r\n",

I had two systems that had this problem. After I upgraded to 3.0.4 the problem went away on one of the systems. The other system, however, continued to get the error. I have discovered that the difference is the content of the local cache (~/.m2/repository). On the working system there is something in the local repository cache that makes things work. When I delete the repository cache and force the system to rebuild then the system that once worked begins to fail with 3.0.4.\r\n\r\n========\r\n\r\n Chris Council added a comment - 17/Dec/10 3:08 PM\r\n\r\nWe had the same issue.

You need to add a dependency to the 3.0.5-SNAPSHOT and upload the jar to your repo. The change i made has nothing to do with the _maven.repositories file. That file is an internal maven file and should exist.\r\n\r\nYou need to do this:\r\n1) mvn deploy the jar with the pom to your repo\r\n2) add a dependency to it in your pom\r\n3) clean your local repo, ie. delete .m2/repository\r\n4) run your build\r\n\r\n=======\r\n\r\n Nick Pellow added a comment - 11/Apr/11 5:01 PM\r\n\r\nHi Jeff,\r\n\r\nThanks for the patch! I hope to try this out today and if it runs well, will go for a release.\r\n\r\nDo you know if the patch is backward compatible with Maven 2.x ?\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nNick\r\n\r\n=======\r\n\r\n jeff melching added a comment - 11/Apr/11 6:26 PM\r\n\r\nI haven't tried it on a maven 2.x build, but I would think that it would work there too, since I didnt' do anything specific to maven 3.\r\n\r\n=======\r\n\r\n Nick Pellow added a comment - 12/Apr/11 9:00 PM\r\n\r\nHi Jeff,\r\n\r\nI've applied your patch and deployed maven-clover2-plugin:3.0.5 to our public repo.\r\nhttps://maven.atlassian.com/content/groups/public/com/atlassian/maven/plugins/maven-clover2-plugin/3.0.5/\r\n\r\nI tested with both Maven2 and Maven3, and couldn't see any problems.\r\n\r\nGreat work on getting that patch done.\r\nI have alos deployed 3.0.5 to our centralsync repository, so hopefully it arrives at maven central soon.\r\n\r\nBest Regards,\r\nNick\r\n\r\n======\r\n\r\nThis appears to be back again in 3.1.0.\r\n\r\n[ERROR] Failed to execute goal com.atlassian.maven.plugins:maven-clover2-plugin:3.1.0:instrumentInternal (default) on \r\nproject myproject: Could not resolve the clover artifact ( com.cenqua.clover:clover:jar:3.1.0 ) in the \r\nlocalRepository: file:///home/abc/.m2/repository/: Could not find artifact com.cenqua.clover:clover:jar:3.1.0\r\n\r\n=======\r\n\r\n John Kilmer added a comment - 17/Jun/11 7:29 AM\r\n\r\nReopening due to regression.\r\n\r\n=======\r\n\r\n EJ Ciramella added a comment - 29/Jul/11 7:00 AM\r\n\r\nI've seen this same issue with mvn 3.0.3 and every version of clover from 3.0.5 on through trunk (which is 3.1.1-SNAPSHOT currently).\r\n\r\nWe've had to totally disable this so our builds can/will pass.\r\n\r\nI haven't taken a deep dive into the source code at this point, but when you run clover in conjunction with a \"deploy\" it fails, but when you use a goal that does everything but deploy, it works fine (so mvn verify works but mvn deploy fails).

It parses the resources loaded to obtain a unique identifier for the resource. Because the maven 2 clover mojo is putting the instrumented and uninstrumented jars in the test classpath, my tests are breaking when the duplicate resource identifier is discovered. Basically, the identifiers are added to a hash map, however if the identifier already exists an exception is thrown.\r\n\r\n    This is a bug catching mechanism that can not be removed.\r\n\r\n===================\r\n\r\nNick Pellow added a comment - 25/May/08 11:41 PM \r\n\r\nAfter investigating this with James, it is currently not possible for the Clover plugin to correctly remove the non-clovered dependencies from the classpath.\r\n\r\nWe are currently investigating the ramifications of removing the forked lifecycle from the maven clover plugin which should fix the problem you are having.\r\n\r\nIs it possible to have two builds - one with clover which does not do the duplicate resource check, and another which does?\r\n\r\nI am sorry I can not be helpful at this stage.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nNick\r\n\r\n==================\r\n\r\nNick Pellow added a comment - 03/Feb/09 1:29 AM - edited\r\n\r\nJust a quick status update:\r\nI am currently discussing this issue on the maven developers mailing list: http://www.nabble.com/classified-artifact-resolution-td21784916.html . Hopefully we can find a good solution or work around.\r\n\r\nThis appears to occur because Maven considers classified artifacts distinct to non-classified artifacts.\r\n\r\n==================\r\n\r\n Nick Pellow added a comment - 09/Feb/09 5:57 PM\r\n\r\nIt has been reported that by reviewing all sub-module dependencies and tightening each scope as far as possible or removing unused dependencies can help remove this problem.\r\n\r\n==================\r\n\r\nNick Pellow added a comment - 03/Mar/09 10:57 PM\r\n\r\nThere has been no progress made on this apart from the investigation and work around mentioned above.\r\nAt this stage, it looks as though there is not a lot the maven-clover2-plugin can do to prevent such errors.\r\n",

Instantiate either PerTestRecorder or GrowablePerTestRecorder depending on whether FixedSizeReorder or GrowableRecorder is used. \r\n\r\nSee also CLOV-1189 problem related with Grails, where such recorder will be also needed (but used in conjunction with FixedSizeRecorder).\r\n",
