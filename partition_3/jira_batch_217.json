      "description": "We have been using and depend on version hierarchy for as long as we've used Jira/Greenhopper/Agile (about 3 years now). It continues to work for now but I keep seeing references saying the Classic Board is going away. The only thing we still use on the Classic Board is defining the version hierarchy as we add new versions. I typically get a page timeout when I navigate to the Classic Board so I can only assume it's seldom used.\r\n\r\nI'll explain our release cycle to give context. We release a major product version every 4 months (version 21 is active and 22 is under development). Each product version cycle contains about six 2 week feature sprints, several hardening sprints, release/upgrade for customer instances, and then about 4 to 7 patches to production instances until that major version gets replaced with next major version. We have a unique minor version number for each of these builds/releases that is a child to the major version number.\r\n\r\nWithout version hierarchy, a whole bunch of our filters that reference parent versions will stop working and become impractical. In other words, these queries would need to reference many versions instead of just the parent version. In addition, we often target issues first to a major release and subsequently to a child version (release build) as the more detail planning occurs. Without the version hierarchy, this practice will most likely become overly complex and no longer work. Yes, we do use Agile boards but mostly for high level enhancement/feature planning and not for all the defects and other gritty details.\r\n\r\nIs the version hierarchy capability and behavior going to be migrated to core Jira? still part of Agile?  Now that sprints and fixVersion have been separated it seems logical to move it to core Jira. I sure hope version hierarchy doesn't just disappear one day when Atlassian puts a new release out to AOD.\r\n\r\nI've dug through the documentation (and Answers) and all I see is statements saying the Classic Board is going away. That's fine as long as the current version hierarchy behavior continues to be supported. Can I get a definitive answer as to the product plans related to this.",

Note that {{rankLength}} values should not be approaching 255 (the maximum column size)\r\n# {code:sql}SELECT 'ROWS_IN_BUCKET_0', \"FIELD_ID\", coalesce(COUNT(1), 0) AS rows_in_bucket FROM \"AO_60DB71_LEXORANK\" WHERE \"RANK\" LIKE '0|%' GROUP BY \"FIELD_ID\"\r\nUNION\r\nSELECT 'ROWS_IN_BUCKET_1', \"FIELD_ID\", coalesce(COUNT(1), 0) AS rows_in_bucket FROM \"AO_60DB71_LEXORANK\" WHERE \"RANK\" LIKE '1|%' GROUP BY \"FIELD_ID\"\r\nUNION\r\nSELECT 'ROWS_IN_BUCKET_2', \"FIELD_ID\", coalesce(COUNT(1), 0) AS rows_in_bucket FROM \"AO_60DB71_LEXORANK\" WHERE \"RANK\" LIKE '2|%' GROUP BY \"FIELD_ID\" ORDER BY \"FIELD_ID\";{code}\r\nThis query will show the bucket distribution of rank values. If there are ranks in different buckets for a certain rank field and the maximum {{rankLength}} of the previous query is approaching 255 for the same rank field, then the system is close to rank exhaustion and will start generating ranks larger than the max column size thus triggering the SQL exception.\r\n\r\n\r\nh4.Workaround:\r\n\r\nThis will involve some manual database modification, please contact support while providing the information below:\r\n# the result of the following SQL\r\n{code:sql}\r\nSELECT * FROM \"AO_60DB71_LEXORANK\";\r\n{code}\r\n# latest [JIRA support zip|http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Getting+Help#GettingHelp-CreatingaSupportZip]\r\n# (If possible) a copy of an XML backup of your database (_Administration > Backup System_).

      "description": "h3. Summary\r\nIssues from distinct projects and agile boards have issues appearing on one another's sprint. Distinct means, the boards don't share any similar filter criteria (in this case JIRA projects) and thus, no similar sprints to plan for.\r\nCreating a fresh sprint in one board, leads to issues in the other board belonging to the same sprint. It is unclear yet, which the prerequisites are for the appearance and it seems rather arbitrary at the moment.\r\nThe Consequence, yet, is that the users (administrators) of the one board creating the sprint are unable to close it eventually. An error message is shown, they don't have the permissions to do that, because they are not administrators of the project on the second board with the suddently appearing sprint.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to reproduce\r\n* Have two boards A and B with distinct filters (multiple projects on one board, single project on another board, but not the same!)\r\n* Create a sprint on board A\r\n* Assign issues to the sprint\r\n* Start Sprint\r\n* At an unknown point in time (during sprint of 2 Weeks), the sprint from board A appears on board B having issues from board B assigned to it\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n* Sprints from idependent boards (different JIRA projects) only appear on their respective boards \r\n* Sprints from idependent boards (different JIRA projects) only contain issues explicitly assigned to them\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n* Sprint from board A appears on board B having issues from board B assigned to it\r\n* In the history of the issues on board B, not a single mention says, they have ever been assigned a sprint\r\n* Ending the sprint in board A causes an ending in board B with a sprint report\r\n\r\nh3. Notes\r\n* I could ensure no issue has been cloned from one to another project\r\n* The issues on board B have been created far before the existence (over 1 year) of the sprint in board A\r\n* First time I noticed this, I assumed a misconfiguration, however, we had this issue now several times, suspiciously on the same board constellation - so maybe this is a unique situation\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n* Workaround is to grant admin rights on the projects presented, however, this is a very dirty one and it does not prevent the sprint artifact creation on board B",

https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/GHKB/Issues+are+not+appearing+in+GreenHopper+Rapid+Boards but the \"Spring\" field is locked so I can't verify things like its \"Search Template\".\r\n\r\nWhat

However, some users have usernames containing spaces (e.g. \"big doggie\").  Clicking on these users causes the search to fail with the following error:\r\n\r\n{{Error in the JQL Query: Expecting either 'OR' or 'AND' but got 'doggie'. (line 1, character 16)}}\r\n\r\nThe query in the search box is:\r\n\r\n{{assignee=big doggie AND Sprint=18}}\r\n\r\nand the URL leading to that page is:\r\n\r\nhttps://whatever.atlassian.net/secure/IssueNavigator.jspa?reset=true&jqlQuery=assignee=big%20doggie%20AND%20Sprint=18\r\n\r\nThe issue is probably easily solvable by changing the URL to always include quotes around the {{assignee}} parameter, e.g. {{assignee=%22big%20doggie%22}} or whatever.  You guys may have some other considerations that make that unfeasible, though.\r\n\r\nThe specific version of JIRA is JIRA v6.4-OD-02-003\r\n\r\nThanks!",

      "description": "It is naturally expected that if you don't have \"Parallel Sprints\" enabled, it should be impossible to have Multiple Active sprints showing up on the same board. However, this is not the case. There is a reproducible scenario, in which multiple active sprints will appear in a JIRA Agile board eventhough Parallel Sprints are not turned on, and this could cause some confusion for users.\r\n\r\n*Steps to reproduce*\r\n* Ensure Parallel Sprints are turned off on your JIRA Agile instance\r\n* Configure two boards, one a subset of the other, but both pointing to the same project:\r\n**  Board A's filter could be: \"Project = XYZ ORDER BY Rank ASC\"\r\n** Board B's filter could be: \"Project = XYZ AND issuetype = bug ORDER BY Rank ASC\"\r\n* Start a sprint on Board A, made of stories/tasks but not including any issues of bug issuetype (It is important to not include any issuetype bug to the first sprint in Board A at this point so you dont automatically start a sprint in Board B whose filter includes the bug issuetype)\r\n* At this point Board A has one active sprint, and board B has none.\r\n* Now start a sprint in Board B.\r\n\r\n*Result*\r\n* The Sprint started in Board B is also added to Board A which already has one active sprint. Causing multiple active sprints in Board A.\r\n\r\n*Remarks*\r\n* It is recommended that each Project have it's own JIRA Agile board, and this scenario will not come up under this configuration. However, certain customer's usecases may cause them to have different teams sharing a project, while each team has their own board (https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/GHS-5410 - Again, the recommended usage here is to ensure that each team's board returns a unique set of issues - otherwise you would experience this issue at some point and the results may not be desirable)\r\n* I have not raised this as a bug, because the behavior is not necessarily incorrect (although it's confusing). The configuration of both board's filters suggests that Board A is a Parent Board for Board B, which causes sprints from the child board to show in the parent.\r\n* Why is this confusing? Well, for most users, this result is not what they intended at all. Users of Board B for instance may be unaware that there is another board with configuration as Board A. Even if they are aware, they may not be thinking that their action of starting a sprint in their board has started a sprint on someone else's board.\r\n\r\n*Suggestion*\r\n I guess this scenario can be handled better by JIRA Agile, if atleast a message at the top of Board A automatically shows up whenever this scenario has led to multiple active sprints. Explaining to all board users, how they came across the other active sprints (perhaps mentioning who started the sprint or from which board they were started). Even something as simple as the following will help:\r\nbq. \"You are currently having multiple active sprints on this board. This may be because you have other boards whose filters are a subset of this board's filter, active sprints from those other boards will automatically show up here.\"",

I have Scrum teams that each have a _primary_ pillar, but that can perform work on any pillar during any sprint based on the company's goals at any given time. \r\n\r\nEach scrum team, while potentially working on the same application as a different team, is it's own stand-alone body, complete with DB Devs, App Devs, QA-Testers, DevOps, and Product Owners.\r\n\r\nThe problem I have is, since teams aren't isolated to Pillars, we generally have a larger unified backlog that serves the whole department, and we use quick filters to show pillar specific tasks if a team is only going to work within a specific pillar.\r\n\r\nI have a unique sprint for each team, in order to track velocity, capacity, and success on an individual team level. This is because they estimate on within their own team.  Thus, Velocity should be unique among teams.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, Since each scrum board must include issues from every Pillar (i.e. Jira Project) since a team can work within any of them, the Velocity report shows ALL sprints, rather than just the ones for the Team I'm interested in.\r\n\r\nI currently have no way to \"tie sprints together\".   I *could* filter each board by a ticket field, but this would mean I need to manage that field for _every_ ticket.  ANNOYING.  Thus, the Sprint label would simply this process.\r\n ",

Current behaviour\r\n\r\nWhen a ticket from Project A is linked to a sprint and is then moved from JIRA Project A to JIRA project B, the sprint is duplicated in project's B Agile board. Many users would like the sprint field to be cleared out or at least to be notified  by the system that this issue is going to occur if he proceeds with this operation.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected behaviour\r\n\r\nOption 1: Allow the users to configure in JIRA Agile if they want the sprint field to be cleared when the issue is moved to another project that is not filtered by the board, or if they want to keep the existing behaviour to duplicate the sprint in the new board as well.\r\n\r\nOption 2: Keep the existing behaviour but always notify the user that the sprint is going to be duplicated, so the users are not taken by surprise when sprints appear in different boards.",
