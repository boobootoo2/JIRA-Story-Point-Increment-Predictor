Calendars with a related space are easier to find and use.Find out why, and set related spaces.\u201d\n\nAs a normal user, this is really confusing: you unambiguously told Confluence that you wanted to see that calendar but it refuses to display it. Worse, the \u201cFind out why\u201d link doesn't tell you why the calendar cannot be displayed, listing only a bunch of features which many people either do not need or would only know whether they need after being allowed to see the calendar in the first place. Finally, if you don't already know the name of the most appropriate space there's no way to create one or see a list of the existing ones.\n\nAs an aside, there's a missing apostrophe in the English text: \u201cWatch \u2013 When you watch a space, youre automatically watching its calendars\u201d",

If the style-tag is present on a page, the edit-bar remains at the top of the page. This means that any page having a macro that has a style-tag will not have the popup-edit bar, instead it will have the old behavior, leading to what may be considered an inconsequent behavior across the Confluence-instance.\nhttps://maven.atlassian.com/content/repositories/atlassian-public/com/atlassian/confluence/plugins/confluence-fixed-headers/1.2.8/ in the file: confluence-fixed-header.js:\n\n{code}\n// CONFDEV-36692 do not active if custom CSS is detected\nif ($('#main-content').find('style').length > 0)\n{ 3\treturn; 4\t}\n{code}\n\n*Steps to replicate*\n\n1.

Very often, our production files have thru numbering. For example, our PCB filenames start with a number. Years ago, we had PCB001... and now we are somewhere at PCB300. Numbering PCB files (and many other file types) is a common practice among hardware vendors.\n\nSince files are numbered, it is convenient to keep them all in a single space. For example, we would store all PCB files in the PCB FILES space. Anyone looking to create a new PCB would first check the space, find out what the last number was, and increment this number by one for his next project.\n\nOf course, filenames do not just contain numbers. We also add comments that make it clear what product each file is related to. For example:\n\nPCB100-DS202 (meaning that \"DS202\" is the name of the related product).\n\nOK, so we have all our PCB files listed in the PCB FILES space... but we also have separate spaces dedicated to each product. \"DS202\" has its own space. A typical product page has sections for different aspects of this product's design -- PCB files, ECNs (Engineering Change Hotes), CAD files, 2D renders, and so on.\n\nSo here is what I want, and this is EASILY achievable in SharePoint, but I can't seem to find a similar feature in Confluence. Can we get a macro or a feature that would allow us to query files in one space and show the results (with filtering) in another space?.\n\nFor example, I should be able to create a macro that fetches all files from the PCB FILES space that contain \"DS202\" in their filename. The marco would then display the list of such files with clickable links (for download).\n\nI feel the ability to create such referential file lists would greatly expand the capabilities of your system. \n\nThank you for reading.\n\n  \n\n",

Problem\nThe plugin exports its service package, so the DefaultInlineTaskService is available to other plugins. However, the com.atlassian.confluence.plugins.tasklist.search package which contains the SearchTaskParameters class is not. Since the class is not available, it is not possible to use the method InlineTaskService.searchTasks. \n\nh5.

However, on long pages with many separate sections, and multiple section column-layout variations there is no way to expand and collapse one entire (say, 2 or 3-column) section itself.\n\nTo get the same effect, the Expand macro would need to be added to a 'single-column section', encapsulating multiple Column macros each containing the panels (or content) that would naturally display in separate sections (in the 'Edit' page view).\n\nThis becomes important when it would be helpful to collapse (multi-column) sections when viewing a page - but also retain the same visual layout where many team members also are editing content on that page.  The whole Expand, Column, Panel/Content formatting makes the Edit view a mess and difficult for some to easily locate content they need to edit!",

Problem Definition\nAs a Confluence administrator, I would like to have additional sorting options in the Page Tree Macro that allow more flexibility while sorting. Things to consider:\n\nh3. Suggested Solution\nCurrent options are:\n\nbitwise \u2014 sort alphabetically, for example: title1, title10, title2.\ncreation \u2014 sort by date of creation.\nmodified \u2014 sort by order of date last modified.\nnatural \u2014 sort in 'natural' alphabetical order, for example: title1, title2, title10.\nposition \u2014 sort by the default Confluence sorting rules. If your pages have been ordered manually, this sort will respect the defined order. Otherwise the pages will be displayed in the 'natural' alphabetical order, such as: title1, title2, title10.\n\nThings to consider: \n# Allow to sort/filter by labels\n# Add some filtering options to the macro\n",

Steps to reproduce\n# On a given page, add a comment including an image\n# Add a second comment with a unrelated image, but with the same filename\n\nh2. Expected behavior\nThe original comment will reference the original image, while the new comment displays the new image\n\nh2. Actual behavior\nBecause both images have the same filename, Confluence creates a new version of the original image. As a result, both new and old comments now display the new image, thereby losing the attachment's context.\n\nh2. Additional notes\n* This is also true of attachments uploaded via any other mechanism (Page Editor, drag and drop, More Actions > Attachments, etc)\n* This behavior is not restricted to images. All attachments will behave this way\n* This is common for filenames that are generic, e.g. \"logo.png\" or \"screenshot.jpg\"\n\nh2. Propose solutions\n* *Proposal 1*: In comments, specifically refer to attachments by their specific version, rather than always the latest version\n* *Proposal 2*: Warn the user during upload if an attachment filename already exists on the page. We can additionally offer an option to rename the file or to continue and create a new version of the existing file",
