Change theme, eg. to Atlassian\u2019s Documentation theme or in our case, to our own custom theme. Global Colour Scheme has been replaced by either Theme Colour Scheme (Documentation theme) or Custom Colour Scheme (own custom theme).\n\n3. Switch back to Default theme. The colour scheme won\u2019t revert back to Global Colour scheme but stays the same as after previous step.\n\nI think it\u2019s not a bug in a theme, since it doesn\u2019t matter if the other theme is Atlassian\u2019s Documentation Theme or our own custom theme. \n\nThis is not a major issue, but could be very confusing if individual space admins will just want to try a different theme for a moment but want to change back to original.

A lot of these decisions can take time to make. To encourage people to keep on top of them I send out an E-mail on a regular basis, but it would be ideal if this was automated.\n\nI am guessing the nature of a decision register page means it is not particularly structured, i.e. it is just a regular page with some pre-selected markup? A temporary workaround could be to use the REST API I guess to pull this info out, I just don't know if there would be anything that would distinguish a decision register page from any other page.\n\nThanks\nMichael",

A common convention has been to provide the ability to indicate in some convenient manner, when defining the link, that it should open in a new browser page without closing the one that the link is presented in. In other products this has been accomplished by allowing the user to select an option to have the link open in a new window or a new tab (I don't really care which). This request is to have that ability made natively available (not via some 3rd party plugin) within Confluence. \nThe resulting user experience is that when the user clicks the link that the author has provided, the target of the link will open in a different browser tab or window (don't really care which) than the one in which the link was clicked.\n\nThere have been similar requests (see CONF-11194 and a veritable trail of tears therein) which perhaps were confusing in the manner in which the request was made.",

Especially so if we've taken the additional effort to customize the link text associated with the people link. It's particularly jarring that the additional {{.user-mention}} styling does not appear when editing - or even previewing - the page. \n\nThe only two workarounds are to circumvent the user mention system entirely (using a web link to the user's space) or to override the {{.user-mention}} CSS (however, the CSS has no distinction between customized and uncustomized link text).\n\n",

The closest we have found to doing this is the Page_Properties macro which if looked at closely has enabled key_value pairs to be entered in per page.\n\nWe would like Atalassian to enhance Page_Properties to behave like page Labels. So when a Page_Property Row is created the first column would search known Labels, allowing autocompletion. When the second column (the value) is entered then autocompletion would occur for that key_value. All keys and their corresponding value sets could then be managed as Labels are currently managed. The Page_Properties_Reporting layer would be enhanced to allow export/import via Excel or restful interfaces.\n\n(Note: in the document attached I've used the term 'Tag' instead of 'Label'\n\n\n",

Thank you for your feedback around having the ability to use an Assignee field when creating a Jira issue in Confluence. While we don't have an immediate plan to implement this feature, we will be evaluating this feature in the longer term. You can check our [public roadmap|https://www.atlassian.com/roadmap/cloud?selectedProduct=confluence] to see what we're working on. \r\n\r\nBest,\r\nLennon\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\n{panel:bgColor=#e7f4fa}\r\n*NOTE:* This suggestion is for *Confluence Cloud*. Using *Confluence Server*? [See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFSERVER-34024].\r\n{panel}\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nAs you can see below, we don't have an assignee field when we create a *JIRA issue* from Confluence. This is useful when we're working mainly in Confluence. When you create an issue from Confluence into JIRA, currently you cannot set or assign the created ticket from Confluence side. Therefore, to set the assignee, it's necessary to go to JIRA, open the newly created issue and then set the assignee from there. This is true when creating an issue through the Jira Issues Macro directly on the page or when highlighting text. \r\n !Create New Issue in Confluence.png!\r\n !Create.png!",

I would prefere a role based model.\n\nThis model would alow to define roles on the space similar to project roles in JIRA. You could then add user and groups to the roles (again just like in JIRA).\nGiving the roles meaningfull names would allow for more crear restrictions like:\n* Restrict view to \"technical writer\", \"developer\" and \"customer\"\n* Restrict edit to \"technical writer\"\n\nIt would make setting restrictions more easy for normal user as they could use are meaning full role name to restrict there pages instead of figuring out witch group would be the right choice. (You could also use good names for groups to support this.)\n\nThis would also make changes in the restrictions more easy, as you could change youst witch user and groups have witch role instead of changeing alle ristrictions in the space.",

However, the mobile version of your wiki doesn't support what we need to do and even the desktop version on the iPad (tested in both safari and chrome) won't allow people simple and complete markup access. Saw on the forum the same problem previously reported but the mobile version wouldn't even let me leave a comment!\n\nThis bug may keep us from continuing to use this wiki solution. Please help.\n\nHere's the comment. I noticed it wasn't addressed by Atlassian on the forum either:\n\n\nJustin Kelly\nseriously Scott Farquhar [Atlassian] Mike Cannon-Brookes lack of a sane mobile interface is really hurting our drive to implement confluence in our organisation (few thousand employees). on the 'desktop' we love it but on mobile everyone is just laughing at it\n\nits a wiki - i just want to view and edit pages - like the normal desktop site\n\neverything described in the above page is not what we want/need in a mobile wiki\n\ni don't care about social stuff, or blogs, or most popular - our people just want to view and edit their wikis!!!\n\n \n\n\u20223 people like thisApr 17, 2014",
