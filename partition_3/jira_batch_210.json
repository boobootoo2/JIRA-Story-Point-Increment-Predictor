For example, placement options could include: \r\n* first line - left \r\n* first line - right\r\n* second line - left\r\n* second line - right\r\n\r\nAnd so on. I'm sure there are other ways to define placement. But this kind of customization is definitely a lower priority than fixing the 2-line thing.

Now at 1100 boards we still are in a good position to find and remove obsolete inactive boards but we see a tendency that creating boards is getting out of hand in a near future.\r\n\r\nWe suggest that only Project Administrators should have the permission to create a board.\r\nAlso we suggest that the naming field when copying a board should be empty and not state \"Copy of...\". This will force the board to the proper naming.\r\n\r\nAlso I suggest that when a Project Administrator creates a new board it should be \"Private\" by default which would mean that it should not show for all other Project Administrators unless it is shared to a specific group/role or project (just the same way as when creating a filter).\r\n\r\nWe had the same problem with stuctures created by anyone when we installed the Structure plugin. We suggested the same permission change to ALM Works and they implemented this in the next release which was a very good solution.\r\n\r\n ",
