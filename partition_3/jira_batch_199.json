      "description": "When having an agile board with multiple statuses (transitions) in a column, the order of the statuses when drag-and-dropping, follows the \"random\" order for which the transitions where created.\r\n\r\nThe order should follow either the order specified under *configure board->columns* or the opsbar-sequence defined in the workflow transitions. Properbly it makes most sense with the opsbar-sequence, as it is actually transitions showing and not statuses. But it would be nice if it could be configured on the board and not in the workflow.\r\n\r\nAs it is now, the only way to change the order of the statuses, is by deleting the transitions in the workflow, and creating them again in the correct order. Which basically means creating the workflow all over again.\r\n\r\nI have attached screenshots of the actually behaviour on the board, the board config and the workflow transitions. The opsbar-sequence is *Ready for test=10*, *Resolve=40* and *Close=60*.",

Will not update systematically as JQL filter will need to be changed everything new Epic is added to Feature 1. \r\n\r\nAnother possible workaround would be for the end user to create a multi-project agile board governed by epic swimlanes. Create board title Feature 1 and manually configure the board filter to contains all 20 Epics in Feature 1. Will not automatically update when you create additional Epics for Feature 1 as the JQL board configuration will need to be adjusted",

See attached screenshot.\r\n- Under Cumulative Flow diagram, the number visualized on the diagram is clearly \"14\" - see attached screenshot.\r\n\r\nThe expected number visualized on the board should be 7, because we clearly have 7 issues in development status in this project (also proved by the JQL query).\r\nI can replicate this issue on other boards, projects and statuses.

He doesn't even have Browse Issues rights, so project B and its issues are essentially invisible\r\n# User 2 is project admin in project B, but not on project A\r\n# User 1 uses a Scrum board and starts a sprint\r\n# User 2 reports an issue in project B. That issue's Create screen contains the Sprint field, but User 2 makes a mistakes: He manually types in the wrong sprint, and inadvertantly add that new issue to the sprint for project A\r\n# User 1 attempts to close his sprint, but is met with a problem: He's not admin of project B. Since he doesn't even have Browse Issue rights, he's not allowed to see the name of the project this intruder issue belongs to. \r\n# User 1 is smart and goes in Issues and filters for issues belonging to his sprint, but since he has no Browse Issues rights, he doesn't see the issue that's out of place.\r\n# At this point, a JIRA admin has to get involved and must track down the problem. User 1 could not have found the problem, and user 2 couldn't have known about it until he was closing his own sprint and noticed the absence of an issue there.\r\n\r\nIf user 1 had been project admin on project B as well, the sprint would have closed without errors, but this would have been a worse outcome. User 2 would have had an issue disappear from his backlog because it would be part of a closed sprint, and user 1 would have weird sprint reports.\r\n\r\nI see how this would be tricky to prevent. You would need a condition that \"only issues that pass the filter for the board that created the sprint can be added to a sprint\". Still, this seems like a huge problem area.\r\n\r\n",

If one of these code reviews is open, then the JIRA issue shouldn't be transitioned.\r\nHowever, there is an issue (in my opinion) for it: What happens when a linked code review is at Draft, Abandoned or Summarized state? What it seems is that there is a code change committed against the ticket and its Crucible code review is created but is on Draft state. At the JIRA ticket side, there are transitions that shouldn't appear because of the code review is not closed regardless of being reviewed or not.\r\n\r\nIs there a way that at JIRA workflow transition, set a condition that the ticket shouldn't be transitioned when at least one of the code reviews is open, draft, abandoned, or summarized.\r\n\r\nThanks",
