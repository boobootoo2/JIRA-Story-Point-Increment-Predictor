They happen to not understand in full the interaction design side. With good interaction you don&#x27;t need cute design, especially for the nerd customers we are, albeit it&#x27;s a plus.\n\nUsually the issues like the one I&#x27;m having arise from interaction design done by a good engineer that knows a lot about the underlying applications.\\\\\nSuch designs give for granted a number of knowledge bits that are obvious for the engineer but not for the newcomers (like me).\\\\\nAs nerds we should be able to dive into the engineer&#x27;s mind (we are like-minded), but I&#x27;m failing to do so.

If I select the build BCLOUD-9 and click re-run it generates a build BCLOUD-11 which goes through test, staging, etc. This is problematic because the build artifacts are associated with build BCLOUD-9 and are actually readily stored & available in S3 in our case. A build BCLOUD-11 would a) take time and b) recreate the artifacts from scratch, thus, it would not be really a rollback.\n\nGiven how BB Deployments is built on top of BB Pipelines, I guess what would be needed is to be able to re-run a specific step.\n\n(raised with @aneita via email)",

As a workaround I created a \"dummy step\" before the parallel build steps just to enable the manual trigger, but this creates an overhead because nothing is done inside this \"dummy step\".\n\nCould you enable the {{trigger: manual}} property inside parallel steps so it&#x27;s faster?

For the moment, we cannot use bitbucket pipelines to automate deployments since the existing triggers are not working for us.\\\\\nAll these functions are grouped in the same repo(s) :\n\n* It is not practical to have a repository per function since it will be a hell to set up for new recruits\n* Nor is it practical to have a branch per function since a feature may affect more than one function at once.\n* Tags don&#x27;t work either since there is no way to filter what needs to be deployed and what stays still\n* Custom triggers may work but it is not much different than manual commands we use right now to deploy\n\nSince functions count in our projects grows constantly, it would be nicer if deployments are handled automatically.\n\nAlso, combining path and branch triggers would be ideal for deploying into multiple environments.\n\nAre there plans for an additional trigger that does the job or something similar to help with serverless development ?",

      "description": "The F# language lets you treat any operator as a function by enclosing it in parentheses; this allows you to add the items of a list by using {{List.reduce (+)}}. (Of course, {{List.sum}} already exists for this purpose). However, when that operator is the multiplication operator {{*}}, the syntax highlighting in the source browser mistakes the {{(*}} sequence for the opening of a multi-line comment (which in F# is enclosed between {{(*}} and {{*)}} and can be nested). There&#x27;s a special rule in the F# parser that says that the sequence {{(*)}} is not a comment-opener followed by a right parenthesis, but is instead the multiplication operator between parentheses.\n\nTo demonstrate of the issue, here are two lines of code that multiply all the items of a list together and print its output.\n\n{code:fsharp}\nlet product lst = lst |> List.reduce (*)\nprintfn \"%d\" (product [1; 2; 3; 4; 5])  // Prints 120\n{code}\n\nWhen I preview this code in the issue tracker, the syntax highlighting in the issue tracker gets it right: the second line is not highlighted as a comment. But if you [look at the same source code in a file in the source browser|https://bitbucket.org/rmunn/repro-syntax-highlighting/src/master/repro.fsx], the highlighting is wrong, and it shows the second line as a comment.\n\nScreenshot showing correct highlighting in issue tracker:\n\n!2492034545-correct.png|thumbnail!\n\nScreenshot showing incorrect highlighting in source browser:\n\n!2101611419-incorrect.png|thumbnail!",

Instead, the next field contains this url:\n\n{code}\n#!python\n\nhttps://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories?sort=-updated_on&after=2017-11-10T13%3A40%3A17.624877%2B00%3A00&role=member\n{code}\n\nThis way i can only request one page, unless i build the next url myself.",
