If you are hosting Bitbucket on Windows the below described mitigation (i.e. jvm.options updates) should be applied manually and the Elasticsearch service should be restarted.\r\n * This patch only effects the bundled Elasticsearch. If you are running a separate Elasticsearch instance (for example because Bitbucket is running in a multi-node cluster), you should consult [Elastic security advisory ESA-2021-31|https://discuss.elastic.co/t/apache-log4j2-remote-code-execution-rce-vulnerability-cve-2021-44228-esa-2021-31/291476] to determine if any action is required to mitigate CVE-2021-44228{panel}\r\nBitbucket Server and Data Center include a bundled Elasticsearch, this may or not be used depending on how Bitbucket is configured.

There are however some changes that should be made to eliminate any concern:\r\n\r\n*Remove log4j-core*\r\n\r\nBitbucket versions 7.12 to 7.19 include the log4j-core jar. This component is unused, however it is the vulnerable software and thus its presence may cause concern. This jar file was inadvertently added during an upgrade of a dependency which it itself lists it as a dependency (it is not actually a runtime dependency of this library either).\r\n\r\n*Update log4j-api to 2.16.0*\r\n\r\nBitbucket does use the log4j-api to permit plugins to log via log4j style APIs, with the log events then being handled by Bitbucket's logging framework, slf4j and Logback. The log4j-api library is not a vulnerable component, however its relation to log4j-core may cause concern so it would be prudent to update it to the fixed version, 2.16.0.\r\n\r\n*IMPORTANT NOTE:* Bitbucket also bundles Elasticsearch which also includes a copy of the log4j dependencies, and it actually depends on them. The above mentioned changes only apply to the Bitbucket application itself, for Elasticsearch please see https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/BSERV-13088",

case.\r\n\r\nThe root cause is a change introduced in 7.12. Also, in Bitbucket 7.16, the implementation of {{GrantedPermissionVoterProvider}} was replaced with a new implementation in order to improve performance problems seen (e.g. BSERV-12166). In 7.16.0, 7.17.0 and 7.17.1 both implementations exist and it is possible to switch to the old implementation. However in 7.18.0 only the new implementation exists.\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n * The issue can be worked around by restricting the number of repositories a user has explicit permissions to (the issue was observed when a user was granted permissions to ~1.2k repositories explicitly). One of the ways to do this is to roll up a user's permissions from the repository to the project level.\r\n * For Bitbucket 7.16 and 7.17, the issue may be mitigated by setting the following property in {{bitbucket.properties}} and restarting Bitbucket DC nodes:\r\n\r\n{noformat}\r\ndark-features.permissions.cache-all-groups=false{noformat}",

      "description": "Hello,\r\n\r\nI'm currently in the process of using the Bitbucket Server Backup Client to migrate our server instance onto a new host with a new backend database, per the documentation here: [https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/bitbucket-server-backup-client-776640064.html#BitbucketServerBackupClient-RestoringBitbucketServertouseanewlycreatedDB]\r\n\r\nHowever, there's a bit of a workflow issue with the way the Client performs validation - it only seems to validate the database setup *after* unpacking the *.tar file from the previous backup process into the Bitbucket home directory.\r\n\r\nThis wouldn't be a problem if I only had a small backup, but my *.tar file is over 120Gb which takes about 2 hours to decompress before it reports a simple configuration issue with my MS SQL Server database. (The issues are legitimate, and I'm happy it tells me what I need to do to fix it, but I'd rather get told *before* the 2 hour wait for the decompress step).\r\n\r\nSo far I've had to wait about to 2 hours hours each time (see timestamps) before I'm told the following:\r\n\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n2021-11-10 10:52:58,244 INFO Initializing\r\n2021-11-10 10:52:59,611 INFO Unpacking bitbucket-08-11-2021.tar to /data02/app/bitbucket-home\r\n2021-11-10 12:45:57,054 INFO Validating database before restore\r\n2021-11-10 12:46:11,939 WARN UTF8 support cannot be checked for the connected database\r\n2021-11-10 12:46:12,621 ERROR bitbucket-08-11-2021.tar could not be restored\r\ncom.atlassian.bitbucket.internal.backup.client.RestoreException: The target database contains tables whose names collide with Bitbucket's tables. {*}Please migrate to a clean, empty database{*}.

The final indignity here is that I have to delete the home directory again (which takes about 15-20 minutes due to the size) before running the restore again, otherwise I get this error:\r\n\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n2021-11-10 10:27:23,811 INFO Initializing\r\n2021-11-10 10:27:25,507 ERROR bitbucket-08-11-2021.tar could not be restored\r\ncom.atlassian.bitbucket.internal.backup.client.RestoreException: The configured BITBUCKET_HOME /data02/app/bitbucket-home is not empty.

Restoring directly over an existing home directory is not supported.\r\n\r\n----------------\r\n\r\nThe fix seems pretty simple - just swap the order of these instructions:\r\n\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n2021-11-10 13:39:29,052 INFO Unpacking bitbucket-08-11-2021.tar to /data02/app/bitbucket-home\r\n2021-11-10 15:32:56,216 INFO Validating database before restore\r\n\r\n----------------\r\n\r\nso they run as:\r\n\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n2021-11-10 15:32:56,216 INFO Validating database before restore\r\n2021-11-10 13:39:29,052 INFO Unpacking bitbucket-08-11-2021.tar to /data02/app/bitbucket-home\r\n----------------\r\n\r\nwhich won't really make much difference for small databases, but for my scenario it would massively improve the user experience as I'd get much faster feedback on problems with my database config.\r\n\r\nHope this helps,\r\n\r\nMike",

      "description": "Large file diffs in the new 7.x pull request interface have some fairly drastic performance issues. On a high end machine using the latest browsers, scrolling and adding a comment should not result in the tapping out of multiple CPU cores.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nIn 6.x the file viewer used CodeMirror, which allowed for dynamic rendering of content. By this, I mean that it essentially had the ability to display files of \"any\" length, because it would only render portions of the file at any given time. This would allow most machines and browsers to handle scrolling and any other event that would be necessary without destroying performance and producing horrible tearing/lagging.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nIn 7.x the interface was redesigned to simply output every line deemed \"relevant\" to the diff in the DOM. For small files, this actually seems reasonable. You get to implement some feature requests that have been around for a while (like BSERV-4942), and dramatically simplify the amount of code required to render a diff. However, this interface very quickly breaks down once the lines add up. As more and more elements are added to the DOM, the browsers begin to struggle to keep up (something that your developers have already noted, since there is now a warning message about performance once you reach a fairly low threshold of reviewable lines).\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nAt my company, we regularly have very large files (some over 30k lines long, and some that are testing files that are even larger than that) that need to be reviewed for changes. With 6.x, these files could be reviewed fully without issue in every browser we use (Safari, Chrome, FireFox). In 7.x, many of these files can't even be viewed due to hard cutoff limits imposed (that you cannot overwrite) and many others just bog down the browser so much that it becomes unusable and not feasible to review the code (a \"new\" file that is 5,000 lines long, for example, kills performance in Safari so much that typing in a comment produces a lag of about 1 second per character on a top of the line macbook pro). A 5,000 line file is not that large and should be capable of being reviewed without such performance degradation.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nMy suggestion would be to bring back (or at least implement once a file reaches some line count threshold) the dynamic line rendering so that large files can once again be reviewed.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nAttached you'll find an example of a 161,915 line file being rendered in a browser diff tool with no glitching or tearing. This was from a script I wrote to dynamically render just the content in the viewport. Obviously this example is a simple demonstration and there are many more things happening in BitBucket's diff tool, but a diff tool should be capable of handling the things people actually need to diff.",
