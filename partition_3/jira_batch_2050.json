Suggested Solution\nPlease shows the Page Tree sidebar on Space view.\n\nh3. Why this is important\n* To reduce the time and effort\n** If we leave the space, we will lose the page tree and then have to go through several clicks to get back to it - which we didn't have to do before. \n\n----\n{panel:title=Original Request}\nThe page tree should be displayed at the left side right after entering the space. The dashboard overview also should be displayed because it contains important information for the space. The space navigator is not important.\n\nAfter Confluence layout changed to Single Page App it's not possible to see the Page tree and the Dashboard overview at the same time, as long as they are in different tabs in the Space front page. Also, the page tree opens on the left side only when you're accessing a page.\n{panel}\n\u00a0",

This is from a bug in JDK PNGImageReader class.  Generally, it appears that this class is not hardened against bad input.\r\n\r\nOne workaround suggested by [~gtanczyk] is to pass ignoreMetadata = true to setImage() in scaleDown()   (StreamRendererThumbnailGenerator.java), which in most circumstances will skip processing of the metadata blocks. I don't know what impact this will have on rendering actual thumbnails - from what I can see, the metadata isn't used at all, except for the PLTE chunk.\r\n\r\nAn alternate idea would be to create a Stream wrapper which performs validation on the input Stream, and sends scrubbed / corrected data to the PNGImageReader (or throws an exception if it's REALLY bad)\r\n\r\nThird idea would be do all image processing internally instead of using imageio, so bugs in the image parser can be fixed.",
