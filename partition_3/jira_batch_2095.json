Besides Confluence inbuilt emoticons, we noticed it happening when there are macros of the [Talk for Confluence|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.stiltsoft.confluence.talk.confluence-talk-plugin/server/overview] add-on on the page. Talk macros are rendered as icons, which makes it similar to the case with emoticons.\n\nCould you look into this issue and improve the behavior of the new editor?\n\nKind regards,\n\nKaterina Kolina",

Actual Results\n\nThe extension is installed, but when you click on Edit in Office again it asks to install the extension again. You can then repeat the loop until you get bored enough to stop. See the video below:\n [^firefox51_webdav_install_loop.mov]\nh3. Notes\n * This currently is only affected in the latest release of Firefox (51)\n * Currently verified in Windows 7\n\nh3. Workaround\n # Use a different browser/version\n ** Use Edit in Office in Internet Explorer\n ** Uninstall Firefox 51, install [Firefox 50.1|https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/firefox/releases/50.1.0/], disable autoupdate\n # Disable autostart:\n ## Go to \"about:config\" in firefox address bar\n ## Search \"browser.tabs.remote.autostart\"\n ## Double click the entry to make the value false.\u00a0If you see \"browser.tabs.remote.autostart.x\" entries, make them false too.\n ## Restart firefox\n ## Go to \"about:support\" and make sure the value of \"Multiprocess Windows\" is \"0/1 (Disabled)\"\n\nh3. Notes for the fix\n * You don't have to upgrade to 6.0.7 or 6.1.0. The fix is just the firefox add-on and it is backward compatible.\n * The new version hosted by Mozilla\u00a0is still under review and there is no timeline for when it will be public. Thus you can not install it using standard update of Firefox at this moment.\n * To get it installed:\n ** You can download it from [here|https://update.atlassian.com/office-connector/URLLauncher/latest/webdavloader.xpi]\u00a0and manually install it\u00a0\n ** Or you can remove the existing add-on from Firefox and then confluence will prompt the installation.\n\n\u00a0",

Problem definition:\nWhen you create a JIRA macro and put in a search filter, you are not allowed to hit insert until you hit the search button. When you update an existing JIRA macro's search filter, the tool does not stop you from hitting the Insert button if you have not hit the search button.\nIf you update an existing JIRA macro's search filter and hit the Insert button without hitting the search button first, the changes are not retained, however, If you update an existing JIRA macro's search filter and first hit the search button followed by the Insert button, the changes ARE retained.\n\nh3. Suggestion:\nThus, this can cause confusion between the users. Make the Insert button be disabled until the search button is clicked when the search filter criteria is edited in the same way as it is disabled when initially creating a new JIRA macro so that people do not fall into the same \"trap\" or insert a warning that if they hit Insert without searching before, it will not update the filter.\n",

This is probably a limitation of the PDF box library, where only the static HTML and CSS code is rendered in exported PDFs.\n\nh3.

Why this is important\n\nThis would be useful for customers that want to add the current date or any other dynamic content in exported documents.\n\nh3.

Environment\n\n* Confluence 1000.847.1 (Cloud), Confluence 6.0.3 (Server)\n* Chrome 55.0.2883.95\n* macOS Sierra\n\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\n\nh4. Scenario1\n# Copy a PDF file in Finder.app\n# Open a Confluence page in edit mode\n# Press {{Cmd + V}} in the Confluence page\n\nh4. Scenario2\n# Open Terminal.app\n# Execute the following commands\n{code}\n$ defaults write com.apple.screencapture type pdf\n$ killall SystemUIServer\n{code}\n# Press {{Command + Control + Shift + 3}} to capture a screenshot into the clipboard\n# Open a Confluence page in edit mode\n# Press {{Cmd + C}} in the Confluence page\n\nh3. Expected Results\n\nThe paste from the clipboard should work correctly in the both scenario.\n\nh3. Actual Results\n\nh4. Scenario1\n\nThe PDF wasn't attached to the page and the filename is just pasted as a text.\n\nh4. Scenario2\n\nThe paste failed silently.\nIf we monitor the step in developer tools, we can see the following JavaScript error.\n\n{code}\ndollar.js:1 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'size' of null\n    at Object.pasteFromEvent (dollar.js:1)\n    at Object.onPaste (dollar.js:1)\n    at Editor.<anonymous> (dollar.js:1)\n    at Dispatcher.dispatch (dollar.js:1)\n    at b (dollar.js:1)\n    at DOMUtils.<anonymous> (dollar.js:1)\n    at HTMLBodyElement.e (dollar.js:1)\n{code}\n\nWhen it comes to some of third-party apps, they try to store images as PDF when copying them into clipboard.\nThat's why these scenario should be also considered.\n\nh3. Notes\n\nThis problem might be caused by [this browser's spec|https://w3c.github.io/clipboard-apis/#reading-from-clipboard].\nEven though we don't support pasting PDF from clipboard, it would be more user friendly if Confluence could show some error on the UI.\n\nh3.Workaround\n\nUse the other browsers instead.",

Scenario\n\nTwo users are editing a newly created page, whereby user A created the page and passed the URL {{<base-url>/pages/resumedraft.action?draftId=xxxxx&draftShareId=xxxxx}}\u00a0to user B.\nh5. Outcome #1\n\nIf user A closes the editor (as the creator of the page draft), user B will not be able to publish the changes or close the editor.\nh5. Outcome #2\n\nIf user B closes the editor, the user gets an error in the top-right corner of the editor that says, \"There were errors discarding your draft. An unknown error has occurred. Please check your logs.\"\nh3. Steps to reproduce\n # Login as user A in a browser and login as user B in incognito browser.\n # As user A, create a new page.\n # Copy paste the link in incognito browser so user B can join the editing session.\n # Add some text.\n\nh5. For outcome #1\n # Get user A to click on 'Close' and 'Discard everyone's changes'.\n # Afterwards, get user B to try to publish the page.\n\nh5. For outcome #2:\n # Get user B to click on 'Close' and 'Discard everyone's changes'.\n\nh3. Expected Results\n\nFor both outcome #1 and #2, the page should be able to be discarded or saved depending on the user's option.\nh3. Actual Results\nh5. For outcome #1:\n\nThe page just loads, but nothing happens. This is what we see in the browser console:\n\n!Outcome 1.png|thumbnail!\nh5. For outcome #2:\n\nWe see the following error in the editor:\n\n!Outcome 2.png|thumbnail!",

You'll still receive immediate notifications for the most important things, like mentions and new pages.\n{quote}\nsee [Confluence 5.10 Release Notes|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Confluence+5.10+Release+Notes] for more details.\nHowever, this impacts only pages edits and not attachments updates. Every change made to page attachments is being automatically sent in an email.\n\nh3. Suggested Solution\nExtend the page edits notification algorithm to the attachment-related notifications as well\n ",
