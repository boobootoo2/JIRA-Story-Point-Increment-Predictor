For information on how to activate collaborative editing: [https://confluence.atlassian.com/confcloud/collaborative-editing-828790374.html]\n\nFor Server customers, *collaborative editing is now released in Confleunce 6.0!*\u00a0Head to the\u00a0[release notes|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Confluence+6.0+Release+Notes]\u00a0for the full low down on Confluence 6.0.\n\nThanks for your feedback and support.\n\nConfluence Product Management\n{panel}\n\u2014\n\nWhen User A is editing a page and User B attempts to edit the same page, User B should receive a waiting screen notification while User A receives a real-time prompt to either begin a collaborative editing session, or reject User B's edit request and allow them to view updates in 'watch' mode instead.\n\nIf User A selects a collaborative editing session, both User A and User B will switch to a shared screen mode where all text changes are shared. Any text that is entered or changed will be reflected on all user's screens, with the user who made the most recent change having priority. During collaborative editing, a small page chat window is added to the screen across all participants so that they can chat about updates. This chat log is linked to the page version on save and accessible from the page history in the same way as update comments are shown. It should also be indexed.\n\nAny users who are in a collaborative editing session may switch to 'watch' mode at any time, where they no longer have the ability to make page updates but can still see the edits made in real time. Both watchers and editors can always communicate with each other via page chat. This allows users who were rejected from making edits to communicate with the current page editor.\n\nIf a minimum connection speed is required to collaboratively edit, the session should check this for any client attempting to join a collaborative session and automatically deny the session if the test is failed. As more users request to join a concurrent editing session, join requests should start showing a soft limit warning when performance goes below a certain threshold, followed by hard limit automatic rejection at the point at which editing performance would be seriously affected.\n\nThis request may be useful in combination with sectional editing, where a user can select to edit only one section of a document, so the implementation should take into account that sectional editing may be implemented in future.\n\nThis request may be useful in combination with notes to indicate when any users are editing a page. This note could be an AJAX notification that appears within a minute of it being edited for all users viewing that page.",

And when the plugin repository showed all green, I thought I was done. \n \nTurns out that the Builder plugin requires an up-to-date version of the \"Page Information Tools\" plugin.    Except I guess the version I had was so old, it was reporting as \"Unknown Version\".   But... it was too subtle for me to see it until I was pointed right at it.  \n \nMy request then, is to have any plugin with 'Uknown version' cause that row, or that Status column to highlight with a color, to make it stand out as being potentially problematic.    Green means good,  yellow means update, red should mean 'look at this - problem here'. \n \n",

We've tried to avoid adding more settings to the product (we've already got plenty!) and our solution for this, which we are confident reaches the same outcome is that we will now remember your last preference for \"Notify watchers\". So once you've un-checked it, will remember that until preference on any page until you change it back (and visa versa).\r\n\r\nFor Cloud customers, this will be available the next Confluence release. For Server customers we hope to deliver this to you in our next major version (Confluence 5.8) within the next couple of months.\r\n\r\nWe are still determined to tackle the overarching problem around reducing the amount of email you receive in Confluence. This is in our long-term roadmap (we're exploring things like digest emails etc...) and will be continuing to make an effort to improve this in the future.\r\n\r\nWe're grateful for such an engaged customer community, your awesome ideas and feedback. \r\nCheers from the Confluence Team!\r\n{quote}\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\nit would be handy if 'minor change' box could be selected by default when available via a given page's edit tab.  \r\n\r\none possibility is to have this option available somewhere in a logged in user's preferences.  alternatively, whilst editing, near the 'rich text' and 'wiki markup' tabs, there is a clickable 'make rich text default' or 'make wiki markup default' (which was very handy, by the way) -- what if there was also a link by the 'minor change?' box to 'make minor change default'?\r\n\r\ni make many small pages to various pages, and more often than not, i perceive my changes as not necessary to send out notifications.\r\n\r\nThis would include the request to provide the ability to disable the *notify watcher* globally.

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFSERVER-8246].\n  {panel}\n\nWe are starting to archive more email into Confluence, and suddenly hit upon an unfortunate limitation. Currently, you can add multiple pop accounts to a space, but there is no way to view the mail to each account separately. So the heavy flow accounts completely swamp all the others. The alternative which we've been using is to create a space per account, but we are starting to see that this doesn't scale very well.\n\nSome thoughts:\n* if more than one account is archived to a space, then the account name should be shown as a sortable column\n* if more than one account is shown, it would be good to have a summary page listing the accounts, where clicking on an account would show just its email\n* similarly when searching it should be possible to see which account the email was going to\n* I would also like to see the account name in the URL so that it is clearer what you are looking at\n\nIt would also help if the main mail page looked more like a page in the space:\n\ne.g.\n\nhttp://wiki.progress.com/display/sup/mail/\n\nnot:\n\nhttp://wiki.progress.com/spaces/viewmailarchive.action?key=sup\n\nApologies if this has been added since 2.2.2.

But you can't even do that, as the classes for the plugin havent been loaded at confluence start up, so you get a class not found error.\n\nSo the nasty solution I came up with is this - get the spring app context, and inject my attachment manager in place of the file based attachment manager. This only works because the delegating attachment manager looks up the file based attachment manager every call, rather than having it injected at startup time.\nThis involves quite a lot of down casting of the app context and (ahem) a couple of calls to private methods.\n\nSo my question is - is there a better way to do this without the hack? I guess I need either a plugin point in the attachment sub system, or a more generalised method of replacing confluence components.",

Such details are only available on a page-by-page basis.\n\nI'd like to see a way that would let you view a list of all pages that have changed just by selecting a date, and drilling into them you'd see the version changes between current the version just prior to that date.\n\nAdditionally, it'd be nice to allow us to provide changes in a space export. Exporting a space means taking all content offline, either to hand off to someone in physical version or someone who does not have Confluence access. The problem is that for successive exports you don't know what changed without drilling into the space details (for me: going in Recently Updated, drilling into each page, finding the version prior to the date you exported it, and clicking to see the changes, then printing to PDF).\n\nif this were up to me, I would include a checkbox on the Space export page asking me if I wanted to export Revisions as well. Unchecked by default. Next to it would be a date selector (disabled when Revision checkbox is not checked), which I could use to select a date. if checked, the export would then provide the version changes following each page's most current content -- similar to how the RSS feed displays changes (see attached).

Administrators frequently ask how to remove one or more users so they can add new users without having to increase the number allowed by their licence.  Currently we tell them to effectively deactivate those users by removing the \"Use Confluence\" permission from them, both directly and via their inclusion in groups. http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Removing+a+User\n\nThe problem that many many administrators then face is that the number of users actively using the system is somehow cached.  (I believe it's their membership of groups that is the problem but I haven't checked).\n\nThis means that in order to add new users, they must:\n\n1) remove permissions from existing users\n2) wait a while (or clear the caches from the cache statistics page).\n3) add new users.\n\n\n",

A Feature native to confluence would be much appreciated",

No matter how fast Confluence becomes working on the local machine is always going to be faster.  So having something like TiddlyWiki is very useful.  However, the problem immediately becomes how to synchronize work done in Tiddlywiki across multiple machines.\n\nWhat would be really cool is to come up with a plugin/modified Tiddlywiki, whatever it takes to make it so that you could use Tiddlywiki locally and have it automatically save up to a configured Confluence wiki.  Or even better, make a TiddlyWiki clone that uses Confluence's markup language.\n\nThink of it sort of like \"Confluence-Lite\" or something.  Heck, this could even be a nice way to deal with disconnected Confluence wiki content management.\n\nAnyway, just an idea as I stumbled around looking for a nice server side solution for Tiddlywiki to sync it up on multiple machines.",

However, you have to infer by the content what the intention / use of the label is for.  Does 'conf' mean confluence or configuration or something else entirely? Is it a list of articles that are about confluence? refer to confluence? articles that should be moved to the confluence space, or need to be updated when confluence is change? Probably all of the above.\n\nIt would be excellent to have a 'wiki section at the top of the LABELS tab for a space, where the labelled content is shown, where you can describe the purpose of the label and perhaps provided guidance and contact info for the labels owner.\n\nThis is more relevant for some labels than others. chemistry, draft or featured-article labels might all have different meanings to different people and it's important to have a tool by which to explain these things.\n\nOne hack implementation we've done is to create a 'labels' space, with a page name there equivalent to each label we want to document. Then we hacked the page LABELS UI to simply dynamically generate an {include:labels:labelname} and also an {include:labels:spacekey labelname} to get the space specific labels. Then we put a link to [labels:spacekey labelname] and [labels:labelname] so people knew where to go to update the info.  All this was displayed on the page you get when you click on [//label/mylabel] or [//label/spacekey/mylabel].\n\n(likewise, i've recommended doing similar embeding of wik content in the UI  for user macros and the notation guide, in other Jira requests).\n\nThanks",

This often does not flow well in natural reading of paragraphs, and when pages are moves from one space to another, sometimes massive numbers of alias that were not originally created need to be updated.\n\nThe most common alias for [key:title] is [Title|key:title], which I type 100 times a day.\n\nIf we were to leave the space in the text, most commonly it's the 'space name' not the key, that we need rendered.\n\nRecommend:\n\n- Make the default rendering of [key:title] just show \"Title\". in the default hover text, indicate that it will be linking to a separate space. \n- People can always override this by typing [key:title|key:title] in the rare cases they want to see the key.\n\n- create a configuration item \"Show space keys for inter-space links by default\". Default to 'true' for backward compatibility.\n\n*note* allegedly, this request was fixed in 2.7.1\n",

If confluence provided a $rootcontext variable to the macros, which was loaded from a standard 'root' or 'context' parameter, it would enforce standardization.\n\nOther candidates for standardized 'global' parameters can be found on a page in the confluence extensions section, written by either Guy Fraser or David Peterson, but I couldn't find it right now. I'll list a few here:\n\npages - takes a well-written query language that allows macros to simply recieve a list of pages on which to perform their action (such as a $pages collection), but without each macro having to re-invent or re-implement a (different) query language. It could take:\n- list of specific pages, or space:pages, with a standard delimiter ( ; ? )\n- wildcards or regular expressions to indicate a group of pages by name\n- perhaps keywords or symbols like @children, @parent of the current page\n- space key designations\n- as the 'parser' changes or becomes more sophisticated, existing macros woudl all benefit from these changes because they simply use the $pages collection.\n\nlabels - same as above: sets $pages to a set of pages that satify a 'label query', with () for nesting and some operators for and/or/not ( + , ! )\n\nscope - descendents, ancestors, space, site, children, parent, self - specifies dynamic scope relative to the 'pages' option, or might be incorporated in the pages query language\n\nquery - uses the built in query language, i.e \"title:My Page* AND author:james\") to retrieve a set of pages for the macro's operation\n\nstyle - specify a direct CSS style for this tag. These could then, in theory, be filterd by a per site configuration for all macros\ncss - specify a css class. likewise, could then be manipulated / translate site-wide for all macros\n\noutput - wiki / table / html / text (specified how output sould be rendered in page context after macro returns results)\ninput - wiki / table / html / text (specified how input should be rendered before passed to $body for macro plugin)\n\nThere are no doubt others that could be used. This request is for Atlassian to put in place the framework to support these 'global macro parameters'.\n\nThanks.\n\n\n",
