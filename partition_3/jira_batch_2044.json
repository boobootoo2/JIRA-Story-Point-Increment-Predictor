After performing a few tests, we could see some interesting points which will be referred to below. An interesting approach would be to display the spaces either in Newest to Oldest, or Alphabetically for the sake of user experience while looking onto it. \r\n\r\nh3.Steps to Create the All Spaces Dashboard\r\nThis Dashboard appears only for Anonymous Users that are not logged onto the instance, thus to make them appear the steps below are required:\r\n# Create a Space\r\n# In *Space Permissions*, allow *View* permission for Anonymous Users\r\n# Access the Site as an Anonymous user.\r\n\r\nFor the sake of the explanation, I've created four spaces listed below:\r\n- *A Space* by the Space Key *ASP*\r\n- *B Space* by the Space Key *BSP*\r\n- *C Space* by the Space Key *CSP*\r\n- *D Space* by the Space Key *DSP*\r\n\r\nh5.Permissions Added, now what?\r\nAfter setting the permission onto the space, when acessing the Site as an Anonymous user here is the result on the Sidebar:\r\n !allspaces.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\nThe Spaces as seen below are sorted alphabetically. Now, let's edit the *D Space* (the last one in the list), and we can actually see, that the list is sorted by Modification Date as you can see from the screenshot below after modifying a page on the space:\r\n !moddate.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\nh3.Behavior\r\nIf the sorting is made by modification date, the spaces should remain as they are, with the latest edited space first, and so on. But, if you refresh the page, you can see that the *D Space* that was modified last, actually returns to the end of the list, as the screenshot below:\r\n !endoflist.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\nThe behavior is consistent and can be replicated by following the steps described above.\r\n\r\nh3.The Request\r\nIt would be nice to have a way to set how the list will be sorted, or even a documentation on the behavior of the functionality.

Problem Definition\r\nWhen you're viewing a page and another user makes a change on this page, like adding a comment to the page, a little pop-up modal appears on the top right corner of the page informing the user that another user has made a change on this page, and in this modal there's a \"_Reload_\" link for the user to reload the page to see change, however when this reload link is clicked the page simply refreshes itself but there's no indication of what was the change the other user made, so it's hard to know for sure what the change was.\r\nSay there are many users commenting on the page at the same time, how can we tell what is the change each user made that triggered the pop-up modal to appear?\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\nWhen the page refreshes it should go straight to the point of the change, say scroll to the comment that was added and also highlight it for the user to be sure what was the change that was made.\r\nh3. Why this is important\r\nSo we can keep track of the changes and most importantly the order of the changes, since the other of the changes are key to keep things in context.",

As a result, a page buried in the tree somewhere won't show up even if it has no incoming links.\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested Solution\r\n* Show a flat list of all pages in the wiki.\r\nHave three columns:\r\nIn page hierarchy (checked or unchecked)\r\n# of incoming links\r\n# of outgoing links\r\nAllow filtering on any of those columns, so I can show, for example, only pages not in the page hierarchy, or only pages with 0 incoming links.\r\nAllow sorting on any of those columns, so I can show the pages with the fewest incoming links (which are thus hard to find) or the pages with the fewest outgoing links (the most dead-end pages).\r\n\r\n{quote}\r\nThe biggest navigation problems in a wiki are caused by pages that are hard to find, and pages that are dead ends.

Please check it out and help us spread the word to your team.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the page tree in the sidebar, we\u2019re also working on some other navigation improvements and would love to partner with you to make sure they\u2019re meeting your needs.
