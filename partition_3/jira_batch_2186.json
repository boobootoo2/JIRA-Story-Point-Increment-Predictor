Previously we had an unsupported document which described how to run Confluence with a policy that restricted some access on the filesystem, but not much else:\n\nhttp://confluence.atlassian.com/display/CONF29/Java+Policy+Security+with+Confluence\nhttp://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DISC/Java+Policy+Security+with+Confluence (currently locked as Obsolete)\n\nIt would be good if this document was extended to limit functionality further, and tested properly so it could be supported by Atlassian for use in production. It could provide a good way for the administrator to limit the powers available to plugins and provide a layer of security when installing new plugins.\n\nAnother related issue is CONF-20287, restricting the ability to upload plugins through the web interface.\n",

Confluence does not have built-in arrows, so they just use {{-->}} which is displayed as -->, but these \"fake\" arrows look really bad.\n\nTherefore, it would be great if Confluence had a feature to convert these \"fake\" arrows into real arrow symbols. Confluence already does something similar with dashed where {{\\-\\-}} and {{\\-\\-\\-}} is converted into the real dashes.\n\nAs a workaround, I created a user macro {{\\{rarr\\}}} that creates the HTML entity {{&rarr;}}, but it is not very intuitive for users to use {{\\{rarr\\}}} instead of {{-->}}.\n\nI really hope that a feature like this could be added to Confluence because it would be a nice improvement for \"every day usability\". :-)",

They need to be cleaned up and pulled together into a cohesive guide.\n\nExisting docs:\n* http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/CONFDEV/Language+Module\n* http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/CONFDEV/Creating+A+New+Confluence+Translation\n* http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/CONFDEV/Updating+A+Confluence+Translation\n* http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/CONFDEV/Translations+for+the+Rich+Text+Editor\n* http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DISC/Translations+for+Confluence+Releases\n* http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DISC/Confluence+3.2+Translations\n* http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DISC/Language+Pack+Translations\n\nTasks:\n* Create a single 'Creating a Language Pack' doc\n(i) Properties are not all implemented in ConfluenceActionSupport_KEY.properties anymore (although it can be done this way), rather each bundled plugin has it's own properties file now that is referenced as a resource in the atlassian-plugin.xml, e.g. 'tinymce_fr_FR.properties'\n(i) The recommended process for creating a language pack should be to take an existing language pack, update it with their own translations and repackage it. Unfortunately there is no existing English language pack, so it may be difficult to determine what each of the key-value properties relates to. The only way to figure this out is by downloading the plugin (e.g. TinyMCE plugin) and checking the i18n property file or by trial and error (e.g. sticking values in the key and seeing what changes). \n(i) Even better would be to update the example language pack (en_AU.zip) file on the http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/CONFDEV/Creating+A+New+Confluence+Translation by downloading each of the plugins and copying the data from the properties file of each plugin into the example language pack. Developers could then use this as a base.\n=> (!) Use http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/CONFDEV/Language+Module as the base and merge in content from http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/CONFDEV/Creating+A+New+Confluence+Translation\n** Describe structure of the atlassian-plugin.xml file.\n(i) dashboard-macros plugin = semi-core functionality, such as 'Recently Updated', macrosadvanced = macro browser, macrofallback = not a plugin, corresponds to macrofallback.properties\n** 'Language Pack Overview' section - Remove the blurb \n** 'Language Pack Overview' section - In the table, the ConfluenceActionSupport Properties file only covers the translation of Confluence core. Add text to mention this and add a table entry to cover the i18n.properties files for each of the plugin resources with Confluence, e.g. i18n-tinymce, i18n-linkbrowser, i18n-jiraissues, etc... (see atlassian-plugin.xml in attached french translation for full list)\n** 'ConfluenceACtionSupport Properties File' section --- The Java Properties file contains key value pairs for each string in Confluence _Core_ and each string in every plugin...\n** From http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/CONFDEV/Creating+A+New+Confluence+Translation Step 9 --- Replace with Java instructions: 'jar -cvf' (requires JDK)\n** From http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/CONFDEV/Creating+A+New+Confluence+Translation Step 10 --- Can replace with inclusion from 'Installing a Language Pack' doc\n=> (!) Deprecate http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/CONFDEV/Creating+A+New+Confluence+Translation\n\n* Change http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DISC/Language+Pack+Translations into a community translations page\n=> (!) Remove content on installation of a plugin, however leave the list of community translations.\n=> (!) Remove content on developing a language pack. Link to it instead.\n=> (!) Remove 'Translations of the Rich Text Editor' section.\nNB: Process for submitting a language pack is correct.\n\n* Review http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/CONFDEV/Translations+for+the+Rich+Text+Editor\nThe content in this can probably be pulled into the new 'Creating a Language Pack' doc. The instructions are correct, but they are not specific to the RTE. \n=> (!) Cut out intro blurb.\n=> (!) Pull content into 'Creating a Language Pack' doc\n=> (!) Deprecate?\n\n* Update http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/CONFDEV/Updating+A+Confluence+Translation\n=> (!) Needs investigation. Most likely just delete this page entirely.\n",

At the same time as the wiki evolves the names of pages change frequently, including the names of pages were attachments reside. Also the file names of attachments can change, while the contents is \"conceptually\" the same (such as new versions of the same document usually has new file names). Currently, every time i change the name of the page that includes the attachment, it breaks the \"hard coded\" links to attachments everywhere else on the wiki. Also, whenever, i upload a new version of an attachment, i need to make first make sure that it has the file name of the already uploaded file -- although outside of the wiki, this may not be the case anymore. A way to create a symbolic name for a local URL would be most helpful. \n\nFor example:\n\nInstead of: !1.3. Meta models^tmp116.jpg!\n\nIt should be possible to indicate the following:\n\nOn the 1.3. Meta models page:\n{alias meta-models}\n\nOn a different page it should then be possible to refer to the attachment as follows:\nmeta-models^tmp116.jpg\n\n\nIdeally, when uploading an image it should also be possible to create an alias. For example:\n\nthe image tmp116.jpg should have the alias: agent-meta-model\n\nthe full link to the attachment should then be:\n\nmeta-models^agent-meta-model\n\nSuch an approach would allow changing the name of pages and the name of attachments, as they get uploaded, while preserving the functionality of all links to them in the wiki.\n\nIf such an alias features is implemented, then one issue to consider is centralized management of alias to URLs/attachments, which could be done instead or in addition to managing of alias within relevant pages.",

Problem\n\nWhen Confluence indexes page content for searches, it doesn't resolve the content of these inclusions into the page first. Hence, when the user attempts to search for a page based on a term that's actually part of an inclusion's content, then the page that 'hosts' the inclusion will not show up in the search results.\n\nAs far as the user is concerned, those terms _are_ on the page when they view it. It's not until the user looks at the page's Wiki Markup when they'll realise that the content is only being referenced via an inclusion macro (and why the search didn't retrieve the 'host' page).\n\nIt's often more useful to see _the names/titles_ of these 'host' pages in search results, rather than those of the actual 'inclusion pages' themselves, since 'inclusion pages' (and titles) are typically out of context.\n\nh4. Solution\n\nTo improve Confluence's search efficacy, Confluence could provide an admin console option to makes it resolve the content of all \\{include\\} and \\{excerpt-include\\} macros first, before it indexes the whole page content.\n\nIf Confluence could resolve all inclusions before indexing whole page content, this will provide the following benefits:\n* If a user searches for text contained within \\{include\\} or \\{excerpt-include\\} macros, the names (and links) of pages that include this content will appear in the search results, rather than just the 'inclusion pages' further down the list of search results.\n\\\\ \\\\\n* If a space uses the new 'Documentation Theme' and a user searches for text contained within \\{include\\} or \\{excerpt-include\\} macros using the search box in the TOC column (for example, any one of our product documentation spaces on [CAC|http://confluence.atlassian.com/]), the pages that include this content will appear in the search results, rather than not at all.\n\\\\ \\\\\n*Why would these searches show no results?*\n\\\\ \\\\\nThe Documentation Theme requires a 'root page' within the space (from which the TOC is generated) to be set. When you start viewing pages within the space, the search box in the TOC column (by design) will only search pages contained within the 'root page' hierarchy. 'Inclusion pages', however, are typically kept outside this hierarchy to prevent them appearing in the TOC. Hence, if you use this Documentation Theme search box to look for terms contained within an 'inclusion page', you're likely to get no results.",

For now, I've disabled it by disabling the Activity Stream Plugin--we have over 1000 users, and it isn't acceptable for our server to be jammed up for a minute every time someone loads this gadget.\n\nI looked on your website for some inforamtion, and found none.  It looks like anything that was there was removed  (google reports a link to the plugins.atlassian.com, but searching for the plugin there turns up nothing).  The web link from the plugin repository similarly leads to a dead end.  Searching on your doc site turns up a description of the gadget, but nothing else.\n\nThis is an important gadget (for Jira dashboards), and we'd like to be able to use it.  I'm told that the initial release of the Jira activity stream gadget had a similar problem that was soon fixed.  Can the same fix be applied for Confluence?  Can we get information on the plans for this feature?",

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFSERVER-18844].\n  {panel}\n\nWe are using the Comalatech Workflow plugin. When a page contains a link to a page that gets its title changed, (meaning the linked page's title is changed and the source page updates the link name automatically), the page throws itself into the Content Developer state. This causes the content developers to have to go into the page and push it through the workflow again. More importantly, when this link is updated automatically in the page, the system records the last action taken on the page. For example, if I changed the page title, when the page updates its own link, the system records that a user updated the page title again, even though they did not touch the page. So incorrect revision history is being recorded.\n\nSo what I am seeing is that the actions taken by the Confluence application are causing the issues not the workflow plugin itself.\n\nI originally created this issue as a bug here: https://support.atlassian.com/browse/CSP-43605?page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel",

Problem Definition:\nCurrently if their are wildcard searches, we could exceed the maxClauseCount and this is a limitation of lucene. Instead of finishing the search, the following error is thrown:\n{code:borderStyle=solid}2010-02-16 17:56:43,996 WARN [http-8080-Processor8] [search.v2.lucene.LuceneSearcherImpl] search Error encounterd in lucene search: maxClauseCount is set to 1024\n -- referer: http://example.com:8080/dosearchsite.action?queryString=item+-blah.*&where=conf_all&type=&lastModified=&contributor=&contributorUsername= | url: /dosearchsite.action | userName: USERNAME | action: dosearchsite{code}\n\nThis is especially prevalent if Confluence has a number of auto generated pages. For example if you have a wildcard search with more than 1024 pages, it will exceed the max clause count of 1024. \n\nh2. Suggested Resolution\nIf we could pass a system property to change the maxClauseCount, we would be able to avoid these issues for some customers who have an idea of what they need to set their maxClauseCount to.
