But everytime I need to go to codedeploy settings & need to adjust settings.\n\n*Need to implement like under code deploy settings user can able to add \"N\" number of AWS Deploy Applications*\n\nAssume: There are 2 Applications in aws code deploy say 1. cicd_prod_app, 2. cicd_preprod_app.\n\nSo in bitbucket under settings It has show Application name, S3 bucket name, Branch with addmore option. So user can add his another application, another s3bucket and another branch. Like wise can able to add N number of applications along with S3buckets & branch name.\n\nIn bitbucket Im using multiple branches like production, preproduction, testing, staging etc..\\\\\nSo when code is pushed to preproduction branch the application cicd_preprod_app need to be trigger & deploy the code to my preprod server. similarly to production.\n\nor\n\nAfter merging code to any branch, When user manually click on *Deploy to AWS* link, It has to show a radio button with list of applications which we configured under settings.\\\\\nso the user will select his appropriate application & Deployment Group and will click on submit\n\nThanks & Regards,\\\\\nSandeep Vanam",
