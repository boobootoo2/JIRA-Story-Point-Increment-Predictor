Another thing that may or may not be needed is a FreeMarker version of the Velocity decorator servlet.

      "description": "The new unified administration menu certainly looks prettier, but it is a usability disaster. Performing everyday JIRA administration tasks now requires almost twice the number of mouse clicks and server roundtrips.\n\nThere are two general problems I see:\n\n1) All the menu items are closed by default, meaning that:\n - Users now have to decipher JIRA's top-level menu names, which often bear little relation to what they contain. Eg. to get to permission schemes you click 'Global Settings', not 'Permissions', and 'Workflows' are in 'Global Settings' but 'Workflow Schemes' are in 'Schemes'.\n -  Menus can no longer be quickly navigated to by keyboard searching.\n - Clicking on a menu section requires a roundrip to the server, and closes the old section. it's like 1999 all over again.  Opening a section also opens the first page in that section. Thus clicking 'Global Settings' opens.. the 'Project Role Browser' page - confusing when all you want to do is see the menu items.\n\n2) The JIRA 'projects' admin screen now lives under the 'General' tab, not the 'Issues' tab. Doing any administrative task in JIRA requires frequent trips to the projects admin page.  This means that one has to keep switch tabs to get anything done. It also leads to menu inconsistencies, eg. if you click on a project, then click 'Edit' to edit its permission scheme, you're still in the 'General' tab.  However if you navigate to the same permission scheme via Issues -> Schemes -> Permission Schemes -> Edit, you're in the 'Issues' tab. \n",
