In this case, the blame hook still sends a notification.\r\n\r\nIdeally, it would notice that the commits being merged to master were in a PR against a different target branch, and be okay with them being manually merged to master without a corresponding PR.",

But, when an issue is added to an already open pull request, the same trigger won't fire, and the issue doesn't automatically transition.\r\n\r\nConsider a situation in which there is a \"development\" and \"testing\" states in JIRA, and there is a trigger that whenever a pull request is opened, all issues for that pull request should move from development to testing.\r\n\r\nSo:\r\n- I create a branch with DIS-1, and DIS-2, and then open a pull request on that branch.\r\n- DIS-1 and DIS-2 are moved to \"testing\" in JIRA.\r\n- QA finds a bug an opens DIS-3 issue in JIRA on the bug.\r\n- I go back and fix it in the branch with the open pull request, and I note the DIS-3 JIRA key in the commit, and I push.\r\n\r\nBehavior I'd expect: Because DIS-3 is now part of an open pull request, it should transition to \"testing\"\r\nWhat actually happens: The issue only makes it to development, because while the commit trigger happened to move the issue from open to development, the pull request created trigger did not fire on the issue to move it from in development to in testing.\r\n\r\nLogically, the reason this is happening is because the commit was not actually part of a pull request creation event... But... For usage, it might make sense to fire the pull request creation event triggers for an issue that just got moved into an already active pull request.\r\n\r\nAt least for this component, it's a big deal because it means we're still spending chunks of time in JIRA moving issue that got missed by automatic issue transitioning.",

In fact, most of our devs get so annoyed by this that we use a greasemonkey script to override your CSS and set it to 100% so it looks normal.\r\n\r\nA lot of developers now are using large monitors, more specifically 27-30\" so you guys need to make this element fit appropriately. I have attached an example of this before and after so you can understand what I mean.\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/VPfRqA8.png\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/cVADT7Y.png\r\n\r\nPlease look into this issue to resolve this.
