THE PROCESS COMPLETES SUCCESSFULLY IN CHROME.  I DID NOT TEST SAFARI or IE.\r\n* I have validated my credentials by logging in successfully via the web UI.\r\n* I have has several other people try to login with their credentials and they fail in the same spot in the create project dialog.\r\n* I am running this instance of JIRA on my dev workstation.  I am using the final 6.0 bits from WAC.  I am running JIRA using a valid eval license.\r\n* I am able to obtain a eval license for GH by using the \"Try It\" button in UPM.  Note that the UPM Try It button does not talk to the same login REST resource as the create project dialog does.  It redirects the user to the my.atlassian.com site.\r\n\r\nIt is unclear to me whether this is an issue with the id.atlassian.com REST end point or whether it is a problem with the \"GH Marketing plugin\" in JIRA.  \r\n\r\n*Diagnosis so far*\r\n* In FF the ajax request to the login resource at id.atlassian.com has an empty request body.  This is why we are getting back 403 from id.atlassian.com.  the request body is NOT empty in chrome.\r\n",

Epics can be prioritized in the Product Backlog, along with all the other Product Backlog Items.\r\n\r\nA _theme_ is a coherent set of user stories -- Often the resulting user stories from an epic. You can't prioritize a theme per se, because its Product Backlog Items may not necessarily be in a consecutive order.\r\n\r\nGreenHopper is mixing the two concepts, leading to the following issues:\r\n# You can't prioritize an epic (the issue type) in the Product Backlog. They don't even show up in the Product Backlog.\r\n# The \"epic\" functionality is in some aspects confusing and cumbersome, because it mainly deals with themes, while also assuming that epic = theme. One consequence is having a redundant \"Epic Status\" field that users must somehow keep in sync with the \"Status\" field. \r\n# You get a separate pseudo backlog for \"epics\", which allows you to prioritize them. This doesn't mean anything in Scrum.\r\n\r\nOlder versions of JIRA/GreenHopper used to get these two things right, albeit with an interface that wasn't as helpful as the new Rapid Boards: Themes were a type of label and epics could be prioritized.",
